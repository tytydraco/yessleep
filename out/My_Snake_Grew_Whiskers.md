I’ll start off by saying, no I didn’t buy her from the back of a van. There was no mystical salesman telling me not to get her wet or expose her to bright light. I went to the pet store, picked her out and took her home. Simple and standard. 

She was about 1.5 feet when I got her, definitely not small but far from the larger end of the spectrum. A shy, quiet, and very relaxed albino python. She was tangled amongst her two siblings when I met her, all three of them hiding in the shadowy side of the tank. The salesman gently extracted her and coiled her around my arm, and she didn’t budge. She just curled herself into whatever position she found most comfortable and according to the guy, fell asleep. I named her Bella and took her home that day.

She was mostly the same when we got home, quiet and content. I set her tank up immediately and got her settled into her new home. She slowly made her way into the corner of the tank and coiled up in the shadow of the corner. I assumed she went to sleep, but without eyelids it’s always been hard for me to tell. I left her with a bowl of water and a dead mouse. By then it was late, and I went to bed, leaving her to her own devices. When I woke up though, she hadn’t moved. And the mouse still lay dead where I had left it. I assumed she had been fed at the pet store before I bought her and removed the mouse, deciding to leave her for the day. 

A few days later I tried the same thing. Dead mouse, no cigar. I tried a few days after that, but it was still the same. Two weeks later I was worried, she hadn’t eaten anything. I had already picked up the phone to call the store and ask someone for advice when the idea hit me. *What if she didn’t want pre killed mice?*

Generally, as a rule it is said that you shouldn’t feed a snake a live mouse, since the mouse can fight back and possibly injure the snake. But at this point I was desperate. I had assumed her quiet and subdued nature was just her personality, if she had one, but this was different. I knew I had a few un-killed mice, so why not try it. If anything happened, I could’ve just grabbed the mouse and stopped it from harming her. Worth a shot. 

She had left her corner before the mouse was in her enclosure, eyeing both me and it through the glass as I approached. I placed the mouse in the opposite corner of the tank and watched. 

The mouse sat in its corner, its ears twitching and alert to any slight rustle or hint of danger. Bella moved slowly, hiding behind the tree branch in her enclosure as she approached. Then, before I could even register it happening, she darted out into the open, her mouth opening wide as a black bile-like substance shot from the back of her throat towards the mouse. The mouse turned to spring away, but not fast enough as it was covered in the black liquid. I could hear the tiniest gurgling squeal of pain burbling up from under the black substance. It began to foam, a slow sizzling froth, each bubble becoming slightly redder than the last. Despite the cage being closed I could smell it. A foul, swallowing odour like sour milk and burnt hair. 

That I’m no expert but I knew that definitely is not typical of the species, especially considering pythons are non-venomous. I gagged as the smell forced its way through the room and down from my throat to my lungs. Backing away from the living room, one hand pinched over my nostrils I quickly slipped my shoes on and headed out. Calling the pet store was already the plan beforehand but now I had to ask in person. Either I had to return her, or I had to buy more mice. 

The store owner said he had “never heard of something like that”. But he also told me she might have been “some strange crossbreed” since they hadn’t bred her but bought her and her siblings from someone. And he said I’d paid for her so if I wanted to keep her, she was mine. I left the store with multiple mice, none of them dead. 

By the time I had returned home the mouse had become a pile of pulsing pink and grey flesh, and as far as I could tell, I had walked in just as Bella began to consume it. The smell had since dissipated, being 10x weaker but had somehow permeated every corner of my apartment. I dropped one more mouse into the cage with her and left the room, shutting the door behind me, not wanting to have to experience the smell or sight again that day. 

Soon I began feeding her mice every day, sometimes two a day when the whim struck me. Supposedly she was meant to be eating around once a week at her size, but she was always hungry it seemed. The smell disappeared, at least to my nose shortly after it started, and after a while the sight of puréed mouse became just another part of the day. I never noticed until reflecting on it now, but she never left any faecal matter, which I suppose explains her rapid weight gain. Within the span of a month, she’d doubled in size and shortly after that she was closing in on becoming too big for the tank I got her. 

I had had to run by the pet store again in order to buy the largest tank they had, which I was less than pleased about. It was hopefully future proof, since Bella appeared not to be a typical python, and I had to move her from on my shelf to on the floor, her new home taking up an unfortunate amount of floor space. Her insatiable hunger had already been draining my wallet faster than anticipated, but the vivarium was also far from cheap. Thankfully I was able to sell the other tank back to the store for a little money, after I had thoroughly cleaned the blood spatters of mouse remains off the walls and floor.

It was around this time that I noticed her face. Every now and then I would take her out of her tank, hold her, let her chill on the sofa with me or whatever else. It was hard to see at first, and I felt it before I saw it. As she slowly dragged herself across my arm, around her nostrils had grown small, almost invisible hairs. I could feel a whisper of them as her face bumped up against the back of my hand every now and then. A week later, they had grown out, and thickened to roughly a quarter inch long and white as the scales they grew between. There were times she would slither off and disappear behind the sofa or some other piece of furniture, though the door stayed closed for safety. Still there were a few times, I found bubbling piles of undigested flesh in some corners of the room, and once or twice in other parts of the house. 

A following month later she was approaching 6 feet in length and was now over the width of my forearm. I’d fed her the usual live prey, before heading g out that night to meet up with my friend, Evelyn. The eventuality occurred where she ended up returning home with me for a few more drinks after we had been kicked out of the bar we had been at. Her reaction to Bella was far from what I had been expecting. Disgust or fear are usually the typical responses I had grown accustomed to, but fascination was a new one. What took me even more by surprise was her request to hold Bella. 

Bella was always very docile, unless you were a mouse, so I didn’t see the harm in it. By now she was a hefty creature, pure muscle and bone, so I had to lay her across Evelyn’s shoulders and lead her up to her arm. As slow as always, she slid her way across Evelyn’s arm and towards her hand as Evelyn giggled at the sensation.  
“She’s so warm, I didn’t think snakes were warm.” Evelyn said as she looked up at me.   
I shrugged and we both turned back to look at Bella, who had by now inconspicuously slid up to Evelyn’s hand and sunk her thumb into her mouth. Evelyn’s face crinkled as she looked back at me concerned, “uhh… is she supposed to be…”  
“I… I don’t know she’s never…”  
“She’s not biting me but…”, either way it was obvious Evelyn was no longer comfortable. I stepped closer, preparing to remove Bella from her arm as Bella began to gag.

Evelyn winced as a thick black fluid began to appear as it seeped out from behind Bella’s lips. Thirty seconds later and Evelyn was shakily, but sternly asking me to remove Bella from her arm. I dug my fingers into her arm trying to pry Bella free, but she wrapped around tighter, her body becoming a steel cable that couldn’t be moved. Evelyn began to cry, pleading with me God or anyone to help her as a familiar bubbling began to appear around the base of her thumb. Bella had coiled herself tighter round Evelyn’s arm, causing the points of exposed skin to turn a bright red and then blue as her blood-flow ceased. I tried digging my fingers into Bella’s mouth to pry her off that way, but as her lips loosened the frothing black bile spilled over onto my fingertips and the white-hot burning that followed forced me to pull my hands away. 

Evelyn was screaming, her free hand tugging desperately at Bella’s tight wound midsection but to no avail. Bella’s grip on her arm only getting tighter and tighter, forcing her arm as straight as it would go as she began to slide her mouth deeper onto Evelyn’s hand, her entire thumb up to her wrist having disappeared into the hungry void that swallowed it. There was a soft crunching, followed by a very audible crack as Evelyn’s arm folded back onto itself, the bright white spike of her humerus poking out into the open air from her now misshapen elbow. 

Bella hadn’t expected the sudden change in Evelyn’s arm and loosened her grip, flopping onto the floor with her mouth still wrapped around Evelyn’s thumb. I grabbed Bella’s body and yanked hard, tearing her free from Evelyn’s arm. She landed in a coiled pile in the corner from me throwing her out of the way, but she didn’t stay like that for long, quickly finding her bearings and lunging back at Evelyn. I grabbed Evelyn by the arm and pulled her out the way, running out the living room door and slamming it behind us. Evelyn was crying, gripping her limp broken arm to her chest. Her hand at the end of her dangling forearm was beginning to bubble and hiss as the flesh of her thumb slowly turned to liquid.“Hold the door closed!” I told her as I disappeared round the corner to the kitchen. 

She pushed her good shoulder into the door, leaning against it as tears streaked down her cheeks. She screamed as a heavy thud rung out from behind the door. I returned shortly after with a chair to wedge under the door handle, but as Evelyn moved away from the door there was another disgusting thud against the door which forced it to swing open. I rammed my shoulder into the door, slamming it shut. But as I did Bella’s tail shot through the door, holding it open. I kicked the door as hard as I could, clamping down on the tip of her tail. There was a fizzy squeal of pain from behind the door as Bella used every foot of her muscular stature to try and pull her tail out of the door. The tip of her tail began to tear slowly with a dry sucking sound reminiscent to the sound of tearing velcro. The door closed with a lurch, leaving the last two inches of Bella slowly flowing and gyrating on the floor next to us. I forced the chair under the door handle and kicked the tip of Bella’s tail away as it wormed its way towards Evelyn. It could’ve been the adrenaline that had been consistently overloading my brain for the past five minutes but could’ve sworn it looked like it was growing, even in few seconds between it being severed. In the brief glance I saw it, it looked as tho the severed end was growing a thumb.

The alcohol hadn’t left my system yet but at that point I didn’t care. We climbed into the car and I raced us to the nearest hospital. Evelyn’s racing heart and mind couldn’t comprehend the pain anymore and she finally passed out in the passenger seat. She didn’t wake for the hospital, and I had to carry her into the ER. They took her from me, and I was left on a cold chair in waiting room for hours, but I didn’t mind. The only other choice was returning home to Bella. I was awoken in the late hours of the morning by a nurse, gently shaking me awake. She led me through the halls of a hospital to a quiet room where a barely awake Evelyn lay. I don’t know how else to describe it other than that she looked awful. Her eyes were sunken, and her skin was as white as the one who had attacked her. Her arm was wrapped tightly in a large, suspended cast that stretched from her shoulder to her wrist. Her hand was free, but barely, wrapped tightly in gauze.

The nurse told me her arm had been bound and cast to treat her obviously broken elbow. It would take months of recovery, but her arm should hopefully return to something reminiscent of full function eventually. Her hand, however, wasn’t as fortunate in its circumstance. Her thumb had suffered fourth degree chemical burns and had thus required amputation. She’d been given morphine pumped through her free arm, but I could tell by the look on her face that it wasn’t enough.

I tried to give her a reassuring smile, but it faltered almost immediately and all I could say was, “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.”  
“It’s still not the worst date I’ve been on.” She said, smiling weakly.   
I let out a small laugh, but it didn’t last. She lay back on her pillow and closed her eyes. “Going back to sleep?”She nodded before falling quiet. She’s still asleep now, and I’m sitting in the room with only the slow beep of her EKG machine to keep me comfort. I’ll have to go home eventually but when is yet to be determined. The best-case scenario would be that Bella is still locked in the living room. Maybe I could starve her out, but I get a feeling that it would be a fruitless endeavour. Alternatively, she could have broken out and be anywhere, either in the house or if not, anywhere else. If she can sink her teeth into anything in the area, she’ll have the ability to grow, and I don’t know what limits to her size exist. At the moment I don’t plan on leaving the hospital, you can call me a coward, but I honestly don’t care. I can’t stay here forever though, I know I’ll have to return eventually. We’ll see.
