Maybe it was all a bad, molar-grinding dream. But there it was. Out damned spot and I was dreaming of clearing customs in points unknown.

How did it begin? It began with…

***Exhaustion.***

I had been ground down like the tooth that had the root canal. Except the pain. That pain was back.

That excruciating, delicately exquisite pain that made me think my brain might be hosting the 2024 bacteriological Olympics.

"Couldn’t the dentist just amputate my head?" I remember thinking, as I waited for my morning sugary coffee to kick in.

*And then, the unimaginably horrific happened.*

Blood began to fill the sink.

I felt a wave of adrenaline flood my system. Root canal nightmares flashed before my eyes.

Jesus, all I was trying to do was waterpik the Mexican breakfast burrito debris from under the crown.

Dr. Hooperova had instructed, “Floss that post. Even if it bleeds.”

But this? This, was no flossing accident. This was something else entirely.

There was a gum splitting pain. I gripped the sink. I could actually hear it echo off the porcelain tiles.

I saw my knuckles turn the same off-white color. My pulse quickened.

There was a clink. It was my metal crown landing in the sink. And then I felt it. It came in fast and hard like SWAT.

A new bloody tooth. And not just one. All of them.

My front bridge. Clank. Blood. Gum splitting pain. And in real-time, a new tooth.

A little different though. And, the molars weren’t the same. A little too pointy. And I was craving a cheeseburger. Rare.

The thing was, I was vegan.

***What a difference a week makes.***

“Yeah, they’ll stop bullying everybody at work by the time you get your third set of teeth,” my wife, Vera mocked.

I had been going through many years of writing code in a hostile work environment and, it had, apparently, led me to grind my teeth like an angry gorilla when I was in the land of nod.

“You should just quit your job,” Vera said for the zillionth time. Thing was this was high paying and I knew these devils. And I was no longer as young as springtime.  

“Just quit,” she droned on. “You’ll never change anything. Nothing. People just suck.”

I didn’t share Vera’s dark world-view but she hadn’t always been that way. Or, at least not before we had exchanged vows. And the knitting began. Incessant knitting. Even right after sex. And the drinking. She had taken to carrying a peanut butter jar of vodka with her wherever she went.

“Problem with you, John, is you’re a worm.”

The argument had grown monotonous years ago. But I had realized that Vera just wanted to get my goat. Vera never missed an opportunity to needle me. About being bald. Old. Short. Poor. Name it. As above; so below.

And at work it was no better.

“I don’t think you can do the job, Mr. Smith," my manager, Rudy, said.

“It’s not the 80s anymore. I bet it’s a memory leak. I’m telling Henry you couldn’t do the job.”

This had been going on for years. Rudy bullying and undermining everybody’s work to Henry, our CTO. I cannot imagine how many consultants Rudy had burned through.

So, I had taken to grinding me teeth, and one thing led to another, and my dentist of 34 years, I fondly called, Vlad the Impaler, and all six foot six inches of him looked up at my X-RAYs and then back in my I am sure scared face. I was regretting every candy bar, every pint of ice cream, every sugary drink, cake, pie and croissant I had ever consume.

“You need a root canal. But I cannot do it. I will send you somewhere.”

And so; he did. Let’s call the Root Canal specialist Dr. Hooperova.  

“I have sucked out blood and pus and put the medicine in. Come back in two weeks and we will finish.”

When all was said and done Vlad the Impaler had shaved the sad remnants of my bum tooth into a post and then a week or so put in a crown. And then, one week later he passed from this life. Suddenly.

I cried when I heard. I had been with Vlad since 23.

And then there was pain. Dental pain. Blood and tears. I was sweating.

And just like that, after a brief text exchange, Dr. Hooperova was my new dentist.

Dr. Hooperova, who had, incidentally, twenty-years ago, been Vlad’s assistant. Her new office was fancy digs dug deep in hipster Brooklyn, facing the Manhattan skyline, with all the brashness of an entitled trust fund brat. I looked out at the skyline, wondering how many humans had devoted their lives to this monument? The monument of what? Freedom? I breathed deep as I thought my left eye was going to explode from the throbbing pain.

Anything to distract from the wreckage my incessant nocturnal grinding and then Dr. Hooperova was in.

“You know about the grinding and bone loss.”

I nodded.

“There’s only one thing we can maybe do at this point.”

“What?” I asked timidly.

“There is a new procedure in trials. I can get you in, I think.”

“Trial for what?”

She told me. I shook my head in disbelief. Then I grabbed my jaw in belief. The pain was real. I was ready to try anything.

Two Weeks Later

The sink was filled in less than an hour with the remnants of my adult teeth, bridge work and all. Blood. Pus from the bum post. And, in it’s stead, were new porcelain shiny teeth. A little too shiny perhaps? A little too pointy for sure. But what an improvement. And no more pain.

I texted Dr. Hooperova.

“Hi. It’s John Smith. I can’t believe it worked. I feel amazing! Please make an appointment. I want to show you.”

Three days later no response. I tried calling but it just went to generic voice mail.

I went down to Hipsterville. Where there had just been, The Hooperova Dental Group, there was now a small, apparently IT office suite with a placard that read, “AI Love You”.

I wanted a steak. I took the G across the river and found myself an hour later in a famous steak house eating steak tartare. But one course was not satisfying my newfound hunger for flesh.

“More, please,” I said, all thoughts of modern dentistry behind me. Well, maybe just one thought left; “How could one small injection give Mr. Smith his third set of teeth?”

As I worked my way through my fourth serving of steak tartare with blood gravy two men approached my table. They were dressed in single breasted black suits. You know, the kind with skinny legs. And they both had long pointy black shoes. White button-down Oxford collars. Black skinny ties: like the kind The Beatles wore before they went all hippy.

“Want to sit down?” I said after they had already taken the seats to my left and right.

“Mr. Smith, there’s the small matter of the balance due on your dental procedure.”

And then they smiled. Like sharks.

And they told me I was going to be starting a new job. I am not sure how to talk about that. But I can tell you that every few weeks I keep getting that gum splitting pain. And I am having trouble sleeping. I’m, I’m gonna have to stop for now. Maybe, maybe forever.

This hunger pain. It's getting more painful. And, I am weirdly, growing accustomed to the sight of my grimacing face slowly filling the bathroom sink with bloody used sharks' teeth; every few weeks like clockwork. Even as the job I've been assigned by the men in black duck suits, may or may not be, adversely influencing world events. 

I remember it sometimes in my dreams. The grinding. But now it's more of a gnashing. 

I keep having flashbacks of things yet to be. Sometimes I am coding. Other times it's darker dreams. Pressure to release. I get such headaches.

It's harder to think straight, too. Like brain fog. And even harder, harder to remember Vera.

Vera, what has become of you? I just remember the pain. The gum splitting pain.

Anybody know a good dentist?
