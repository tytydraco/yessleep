Maybe it was all a bad, molar-grinding dream. But there it was. Out damned spot and I was dreaming of clearing customs in points unknown.

How did it begin? It began with…

***Exhaustion.***

I had been ground down like the tooth that had the root canal. Things were different now. That pain was back.

That excruciating, delicately exquisite pain that made me think my brain might be hosting the 2024 bacteriological Olympics.

"Couldn’t the dentist just amputate my head?" I remember thinking, as I waited for my morning sugary coffee to kick in.

*And then, the unimaginably horrific happened.*

Blood began to fill the sink.

I felt a wave of adrenaline flood my system. Root canal nightmares flashed before my eyes.

Jesus, all I was trying to do was waterpik the Mexican breakfast burrito debris from under the crown.

Dr. Hooperova had instructed, “Floss that post. Even if it bleeds.”

But this? This was no flossing accident. This was something else entirely.

There was a gum splitting pain. I gripped the sink. I could actually hear the rending of gummy flesh echoing off the porcelain tiles.

I saw my knuckles turn that same off-white color. My pulse quickened.

There was a clink. It was my metal crown landing in the sink. And then I felt it. The cutting pain came in hard and fast like SWAT.

It was a new bloody tooth.

And not just one. Within minutes it was, well, *all of them.*

My front bridge. Clank.

Blood spurting, dripping down my chin. Streaking the medicine chest's mirror.

More gum splitting pain. And in real-time, yet another new tooth.

These noobs were a little different though. For starters, the molars weren’t the same. A little too pointy. And I was craving a cheeseburger. Rare.

The thing was, I was vegan.

***What a difference a week makes.***

“Yeah, they’ll stop bullying everybody at work by the time you get your third set of teeth,” my wife, Vera mocked.

I had been going through many years of writing code in a hostile work environment and, it had, apparently, led me to grind my teeth like an angry gorilla when I was in the land of nod.

“You should just quit your job,” Vera said for the zillionth time. Thing was this was high paying, and I knew these devils. And I was no longer as young as springtime.  

“Just quit,” she droned on. “You’ll never change anything. Nothing. People just suck.”

I didn’t share Vera’s dark worldview, but she hadn’t always been that way. Or at least not before we had exchanged vows. And the knitting began. Incessant knitting. Even right after sex. And the drinking. She had taken to carrying a peanut butter jar of vodka with her wherever she went.

“Problem with you, John, is you’re a worm.”

The argument had grown monotonous years ago. But I had realized that Vera just wanted to get my goat. Vera never missed an opportunity to needle me. About being bald. Old. Short. Poor. Name it.

***And at work it was no better. As above, so below.***

“I don’t think you can do the job, Mr. Smith," my manager, Rudy, said.

“It’s not the 80s anymore. I bet it’s a memory leak. I’m telling Henry you couldn’t do the job.”

This had been going on for years. Rudy bullying and undermining everybody’s work to Henry, our CTO. I cannot imagine how many consultants Rudy had burned through.

So, I had taken to grinding my teeth, and one thing, as it often does, led to another, and my dentist of 34 years, whom, I fondly referred to as Vlad the Impaler, all 6'6" of him was hard at work.

Vlad looked up at my X-RAYs, those long magnifying glasses perched on his big nose. Then his gaze landed directly on my, I am sure, scared-shitless face.

The face that wore my shame and regret for every candy bar, every pint of ice cream, every sugary coffee drink, cake, pie and croissant I had ever consumed in my stressed the fuck out life.

“You need a root canal. But I cannot do it. I will send you somewhere. I will save your life.”

And so; he did. Let’s call the Root Canal specialist Dr. Hooperova.  

She said, “I have sucked out blood and pus and put the medicine in. Come back in two weeks and we will finish.”

When all was said and done Dr. Hooperova had sent me back to Vlad the Impaler; the operation a success.

Vlad had shaved the sad remnants of my bum tooth into a post, and then, a week or so later put in a steel crown. He had bobbled it, and I almost swallowed it, but we worked together as a team and, just like that, my dental nightmare was over.

Or, so I thought.

One week later, calling for my regular cleaning:

Dr. Vlad the Impaler had passed from this life. Suddenly.

I cried when his assistant, Alla, told me his heart had just stopped. I had been with Vlad since I was 23. Within a week his office was closed as if he'd never been there, fighting the good fight the last 40 years.

And within days, well, then there was a new pain to interrupt my grief.

*Dental pain. Blood and tears filled my sink. I was sweating, too.*

And just like that, after a brief text exchange, Dr. Hooperova was officially my new dentist.

Dr. Hooperova, who had, incidentally, twenty-years ago, been Vlad’s assistant.

Her new office was fancy digs dug deep in hipster Brooklyn. Panoramic views facing the Manhattan skyline, with all the brashness of an entitled trust fund brat.

I looked out at the skyline, wondering how many humans had devoted their lives to this monument...

The monument of what, though? Technology? Mastery of nature? Freedom?

I breathed deep as I thought my left eye was going to explode from the throbbing pain in my jaw.

I thought of comic books, women, baseball; anything to distract from the dental damnation my incessant nocturnal grinding had led me to.

And then, then the good doctor was in.

“You know about the grinding and bone loss,” Dr. Hooperova said plainly.

I nodded.

“There’s only one thing we can maybe do at this point I am afraid.”

“What?” I asked timidly, imagining the worst. A toothless sad depressed me; forever.

“There is a new procedure in trials. I can get you in, I think.”

*“Trial for what?”*

She told me. I shook my head in disbelief. Then I grabbed my jaw in belief. The pain was real. I was ready to try anything.

***Two Weeks Later***

The sink was filled, in less than an hour, with the remnants of my adult teeth, bridge work and all.

Blood. Pus from the bum post. And, in it’s stead, were new porcelain shiny teeth. A little too shiny perhaps? A little too pointy for sure. But what an improvement. And no more pain.

I texted Dr. Hooperova with gleeful fingers. I wanted fried chicken. Ham. Salami. Tongue.

“Hi. It’s John Smith. I can’t believe it worked!! I feel amazing! Please make an appointment for tomorrow. I want to show you.”

*Three days later and still no response. I tried calling direct but it just went to generic voice mail.*

I went down to Hipsterville. Where there had only last week existed, The Hooperova Dental Group, there was now a small, apparently IT office suite sporting a gold placard that read, “AI Love You”.

I was annoyed but also hungry. Really hungry.

I wanted a steak. I took the G across the river and found myself an hour later in a famous steak house eating steak tartare. But one course was not satisfying my newfound hunger for flesh.

“More, please,” I said, all thoughts of modern dentistry behind me. Well, maybe just one thought left; “How could one small injection give Mr. Smith his third set of teeth?”

As I worked my way through my fourth serving of steak tartare with blood gravy two men approached my table. They were dressed in single breasted black suits. You know, the kind with skinny legs. And they both had long pointy black shoes. White button-down Oxford collars. Black skinny ties: like the kind The Beatles wore before they went all hippy. They looked like angry ducks.

“Want to sit down?” I said, *after* they had already taken the seats, both to my left and right.

“Mr. Smith, there’s the small matter of the balance due on your dental procedure.”

And then they smiled. Like sharks. I smelled blood.

They then informed me, matter-of-factly, that I would soon be starting a new job. My old job was no longer going to be an issue nor would money.

I am not sure how to talk about the new job. Not that I am scared but more like I cannot remember things like I used to.

But I can tell you that every few weeks I keep getting that gum splitting pain. And I am also having trouble sleeping. I’m, I’m gonna have to stop writing for now. The headache is back and I want mahi mahi.

This hunger pain is no game. I also find myself growing weirdly accustomed to the sight of my grimacing face in the medicine chest door mirror; slowly filling the bathroom sink with bloody used sharks' teeth. Every three weeks like clockwork.

Even as the job I've been assigned by the men in black duck suits, may or may not be, adversely influencing world events. I remember it sometimes in fits and starts in my dreams. The grinding, well now, now it's more of a gnashing. And I have been swimming at night. I thought at first tiring myself out might help with the insomnia, but now, now I just swim back and forth in the pool at the club.

Back and forth as if... As if I had been doing it my whole life. Thing is before a week ago I couldn't swim. You see, as  boy I almost drowned in Woodstock, NY, when my hippy parents were tripping on acid and I went wading in the moss covered rocks right into the deep end.

I find swimming is more peaceful at night. I had tried it in the day but the smells and all the spastic human motion kept giving me headaches. And hunger for steak. Rare. Very rare.

I also keep having flashbacks of things yet to be. 

Sometimes I am coding. 

Other times the dreams are much darker. I only remember the feeling of this pressure, like something needs to be released, but what? I can't say, rightly.

I get such headaches.

It's harder to think straight, too. Like brain fog. And even harder, harder to remember Vera.

Vera, what has become of you? I just remember the pain. The gum splitting pain.

Anybody know a good dentist?
