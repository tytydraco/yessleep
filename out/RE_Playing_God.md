Dear Professor Goldman,

Experiment #7 has been a resounding success.  
I have learned from the failures of #6 and transported the stem cells to the dish using a sterile scalpel, so there was no chance of cross-contamination. Thank you again for the increased supply of 09-476, it has been vital to test larger doses if we wish to fully grasp its potential.  
Report is as follows:

\- Stem cells implanted in a 0.4 mol/dm^(3) solution of 09-476  
\- Cells enlarged in mass by a factor of 2 after exactly 15.3 hours  
\- Muscle tissue detected after 32 hours

I really feel confident about this one.

Dr Henrik Lars, PhD

  
**Professor Brynn Goldman - 18/03/XX**

Dr Henrik,

That's a pleasure to hear! I'm glad we managed to convince the panel to bring in that new shipment. Number seven already feels like a prime candidate for further experimentation.  
Did you notice any corrosion with an increased concentration of 09-476? I'm concerned that it will negatively affect the growth of the cells.

I've allowed for more funding to be directed towards this project. Use it wisely. This could be our golden goose.

Best of luck,  
Prof Brynn Goldman

  
**Dr Henrik Lars - 30/03/XX**

Dear Professor,

Experiment #7 has grown to almost 4 grams. It is entirely comprised of muscle fiber and stem cells, the latter already multiplying as I type. It has absorbed almost an entire syringe of 09-476. I am putting in a request for more, as well as a second batch of cells to replicate #7. In a few days, it will be ready for preliminary testing.

It has shown to be mildly resistant to high temperatures - I accidentally increased the heat of the lab whilst I was on lunch by 2 degrees Kelvin and it showed no signs of degradation.

This is more than a revolutionary new drug, Professor. I feel like I am on the brink of a scientific breakthrough.

Dr Henrik

  
**Professor Brynn Goldman - 08/04/XX**

Dr Henrik,

I'm delighted to hear that experiment number seven has been so informative. I agree with you, this has the potential to be a very interesting research task. Unfortunately, I have to disagree with the idea of your "scientific breakthrough". What you have cultivated is nothing more than a set of cells, it is not sentient or conscious. Please try to stick to the original project. It's what we're getting paid for after all.

Also - I've had a complaint from Floor Two that one of their barrels of synthetic amniotic fluid has gone missing. It's quite important to them. Now I'm not saying you did it, per se, but the security cameras did pick up somebody matching your physique rolling a barrel into a lift in the early hours of the morning a couple days ago. If you happen to know anything about it, they'd be very forgiving if it could be returned.

Thank you,  
Prof Brynn Goldman

  
**Dr Henrik Lars - 22/04/XX**

Professor,

Experiments #8-12 are going very well. I am watching their progress with great interest. I request a few more samples of 09-476.

Experiment #7 is extraordinary. It has grown to the size of a foetus. In fact, it has taken the form of one. Analysis shows that it is behaving exactly like one, too, only growing at an enhanced rate due to the introduction of more concentrated 09-476. This is utterly remarkable. I have spent the day glancing at it while researching papers that might discuss something like this - I have found nothing. #7 is truly unique.

I have placed it in a tank in the centre of my laboratory. It requires very little care, no nutrients at all other than 09-476. It will not respond to stimuli at the minute, so I cannot claim that it holds any developmental cognitive function. Although, one time, I could have sworn it tilted its head toward me.

Please inform Floor Two that I will be needing more synthetic fluid. I am sure that they will understand how vital this experiment is when it is explained to them.

Dr Henrik

  
**Professor Brynn Goldman - 24/04/XX**

Dr Henrik.

This changes things.  
If you're cultivating a foetus down there, you'll need some more staff. I'll send some junior researchers to assist with Number 7's development.  
I agree, this is quite remarkable, but it has been done before. The most interesting part's the fact that it doesn't need to eat - how does it survive? Does it breathe? Does it think?

Please keep me updated, Henrik.  
Prof Brynn Goldman

  
**Dr Henrik Lars - 05/05/XX**

Professor,

I was right. It is life. #7 has begun to move certain limbs within its tank. It has now grown to the size of a newborn, yet it shows no signs of the same basic intelligence. Its skin is pale and translucent - I can note the lack of basic organ development. It is hollow.

I have attempted to test certain responses, such as tapping on the tank or playing auditory stimuli. It has stirred slightly each time. Once, it placed a fleshy hand to the glass. I will not leave the laboratory this week. I will sleep under my desk, just in case there are any updates. The rate at which it is developing is incredible.

Dr Henrik

  
**Public University Announcement - 08/05/XX**

Students and Faculty,

We apologise for the recent power cut. The mains have been repaired and power should be redirected to the rest of the University as soon as possible.

Thank you for your patience!  
Cardiff

  
**Dr Henrik Lars - 09/05/XX**

Professor,

What the hell happened?! A power outage? When I'm involved in research this important?

There was no emergency power routed to my laboratory. #7 has suffered a catastrophic loss in muscle mass and size. I will be needing more 09-476 immediately. The space heaters and ventilation that provided #7 with the warmth and air it needs were switched off overnight, on the one day that I chose to go back to my home. I had to listen to it burbling when I walked back in the following morning. It sounded like screaming.

I attempted to email you on the day of the outage to notify you that #7 required more tissue to rebuild what had been damaged by the outage. You did not respond, so I spliced parts of my own calf tissue to implant in #7. I am fine. I will regrow.

This may take months to rebuild.

Dr Henrik

  
**Professor Brynn Goldman - 10/05/XX**

Henrik,

You did what?! You implanted part of your own body into an experimental homunculi because you thought it looked weak?!

This is really, really worrying Henrik. You're treating the thing like it's your own child, for god's sake! If I didn't understand how groundbreaking this thing was I'd shut it down. I mean - the ethical violations alone could destroy everything I've built here! And what if you start relying on it, huh? I don't want to have to send you to fucking grief counselling if Number Seven kicks the bucket.

This had better not get out to the rest of the University. I'm already telling the board that you're doing experiments on actual IVF foetuses just to keep rival institutions from stealing the data.

God, I swear if you don't give me something incredible.

Prof Brynn Goldman

  
**Dr Henrik Lars - 16/05/XX**

Professor,

I have something incredible. #7 was successfully transported out of his tank today. He has grown to be the size of a toddler, and he looks like one too. I believe the cells I transplanted have mixed with his DNA - he looks remarkably like I did when I was around 3 or 4. He has begun to take tentative steps, and although he cannot support his bodyweight nor open his eyes, he seems to have an understanding of the world around him. When lying on my desk, as he is now, he will pick up objects for mere moments before dropping them.

This is a conscious human! I have made something that no person living has been able to make!

I am requesting an expansion to my laboratory.

Dr Henrik

  
**Dr Henrik Lars - 30/06/XX**

Professor,

\#7 has begun to say his first words. I lectured him on 09-476 today as part of his pre-schooling, and while he was perched upon the chair he muttered "Henrik" under his breath. He seems just like me - his eyes are the same shade of green and his hair is an identical russet colour. He is an inquisitive sort, he enjoys playing with the lego bricks I have placed in the laboratory. His designs are quite hard to understand but I believe he is simply making shapes at the minute. Some of them look quite like animals, however, which I have had to pluck from his mouth to ensure he does not choke.

Sometimes I see a glimmer of intellect behind his pupils, some flashing moment of self-actualisation. It is strange - for a second it is like a wildly intelligent creature lurks behind the facade of a boy.

Might childcare be an option? Supervised, of course. I wish to see how #7 grows when moulded by a mother-like figure. I have suggested some names in a list attached. They will obviously have to sign NDAs.

Dr Henrik

  
**Professor Brynn Goldman - 01/07/XX**

Henrik.

The results from Number Seven's check-up came back.  
The thing has no organs. None. Still.  
How in god's name does it survive?

I've looked over your nanny suggestions. Funnily enough, they all share a striking resemblance to your mother. Coincidence?

Prof Brynn Goldman

  
**Professor Brynn Goldman - 12/07/XX**

We found Number Seven in the cafeteria today, Henrik.

I thought you said it couldn't eat yet? I explicitly remember you telling me last week that it had problems with swallowing, in my opinion due to its lack of digestive system.

Well, one of the dinner ladies found it curled up in the back of the kitchen, surrounded by raw beef. It'd been eating it by the packetful before, I assume, it got too full and fell asleep. Sandra thought it'd killed someone, it was covered in blood and mince.

We cannot sustain a creature like this by ourselves. You definitely can't do it alone. I think we should ask for help.

Prof Brynn Goldman

  
**Dr Henrik Lars - 13/07/XX**

NO.

\#7 consuming the beef was not some kind of warning - it was a blessing. Now we can try and understand how something like him respires, defecates, consumes. He must have some kind of system that we are not seeing with our current technology. But this is not a sign that we are in over our heads, rather it is proof that we are on the right track. Could #7 have learned that the cafeteria was a place for food if he did not study hard from the nanny? Could he have opened the packaging without careful demonstration of how his limbs function? Could he have done any of this if we had not carefully cultivated his upbringing? No! He is as much my experiment as he is yours.

If we were to give him to the Government, they would simply dissect him. But there is so much more we can learn! We have made one of the most incredible discoveries in human history, and you want to hand him over? Think of the awards, Brynn. The Nobel Prize we will undoubtedly be entitled to, the recognition, the money! This  and more is waiting for us if only we can complete the experiment. By my calculations, as long as I keep feeding him 09-476 he should be at teenager stage in a few months, then we can really learn.

Regardless, I have spoken to him and he said he's sorry.

Dr Henrik

  
**Professor Brynn Goldman - 14/07/XXX**

Henrik.

Stop giving it 09-476.

Prof Brynn Goldman

  
**Dr Henrik Lars - 02/08/XXX**

Professor,

I was in an awful place last night. #7 had grown terribly sick from some flu he picked up around the laboratory. He has been sniffling and coughing all throughout the day, and his skin has returned to that translucent glow it had when he was in the tank. His eyes have gone milky. His teeth have started to rot in his gums. I could scarcely sleep. I fear that he is growing sicker by the hour, and I cannot risk him getting worse or else the experiment may be in jeopardy.

As such, I have transplanted considerably more of my own cells into his body yet again. I do not know what they do - I can see them disappear the moment they enter his interior. He seems healthier now, and he has smiled for the first time in half a week.

I felt the need to inform you in the off chance that another researcher complained about #7's appearance. He has been very upset at the way the other staff members have been treating him. They look away when he walks past, they shoot him disparaging glances when he tries to talk to them. I have explained that he is simply curious, but many fail to understand how good-natured #7 truly is. We both would appreciate if there was some kind of meeting where all this was aired out.

Dr Henrik

  
**Professor Brynn Goldman - 02/08/XX**

Dr Henrik,

The other researchers have been complaining because the way Number Seven acts is, quite frankly, creepy. It's been known to follow staff members as they go about their day, and stare at them when they conduct business or experiments. One professor told me that Number Seven attempted to consume a tissue sample she had been studying when she turned to investigate a slammed door behind her. He's fast, Henrik. Very fast. I've seen him race across an entire floor in a matter of minutes.

The most worrying incident came from yesterday. Dr Lombard was on her way home when she discovered Number Seven had stowed away in the boot of her car. It'd kept so unfathomably quiet that she only realised when she'd actually pulled up on her driveway and opened the door. You didn't even notice it was gone, when it came back to your lab you were looking at some data on your computer. This is really unacceptable, Henrik.

I suggest Number Seven stays in your lab from now on.

Prof Brynn Goldman

  
**Public University Announcement - 10/08/XX**

Students and Faculty,

As many of you know, Jimmy the Spaniel has been missing from campus for several hours. His last known whereabouts were in Alexandra Gardens. If you've spotted Jimmy, please tell your nearest member of staff.

Thank you,  
Cardiff

  
**Dr Henrik Lars - 16/08/XX**

Professor,

How many times do I have to say that #7 had no involvement in the dog's disappearance?  
Again, he was with me all day on the 10th, helping me prepare slides for analysis. He has become very very weak in the last few days, the last thing he needs is some kind of witch hunt from the rest of the department.

Dr Henrik

  
**Professor Brynn Goldman - 17/08/XX**

Henrik, we both know the bones found in the supply wardrobe were from Jimmy. It had his collar wrapped around the skull like some kind of trophy, for god's sake.

There's nothing else in this facility that can strip a living thing of flesh in the way that Number Seven can. I asked you to keep him in your lab. I'm gonna brush this thing under the rug for now, but I want a breakthrough on how Number Seven digests pretty soon. This can't all be for nothing.

  
**Dr Henrik Lars - 20/08/XX**

Professor,

\#7 has been almost corpse-like for the past week. He has snuck into a corner of my lab and refuses to come out. Not even 09-476 will entice him any more. I can scarcely see him in the shadows, he blends in so well. It's very strange to look at him like this. He is, for want of a better word, my doppelganger, and it is like watching myself succumb to an unknown illness.

I am requesting him to be given a full medical examination by the University clinic. No researchers, nobody who knows about his origin. I want an unbiased report.

Dr Henrik

  
**Professor Brynn Goldman - 22/08/XX**

Dr Henrik,

I can't even begin to fathom how stupid that idea is. *It's hollow*. What's a med student going to do with that?! Not to mention how strange it'd be when a scientist walks in with his disgusting, rotting twin brother.

Not happening. Find another way to make your sick creation well again.

I'm really reconsidering covering this up. The Nobel Prize might not be worth it.  
Prof Brynn Goldman

  
**Dr Henrik Lars - 25/08/XX \[UNSENT - LEFT IN DRAFTS\]**

Professor,

I have found the reason as to why #7 kept falling sick. He needs a supply of cells to maintain its body. 09-476 isn't cutting it anymore. I tried to give him some more of my calf muscle, but he couldn't even muster up the strength to take it from my hand.

So, as a last resort, I amputated my own arm. I calculated that it has a perfect theoretical number of cells, enough to more than make up for the deficiency over the last few weeks. I bit down on some rubber, injected myself with a considerable amount of morphine and took a sterile hacksaw to my arm, just below the shoulder. It was tricky work, It has been a long time since I have had to do exercise that exerting. Thankfully, I had #7 cheering me on from my side. He helped me pick the best part of my arm to cut, and the perfect amount of force I needed to ensure a clean severing. This is undoubtedly proof that his biology education is far surpassing that of a normal child. While I was sawing, I couldn't help but notice that he had grown to be almost identical to me. No longer was he a teenager, but a grown man. In fact, he had already begun to grow the same stubble that I now have upon my chin. Remarkable!

After I finished with my procedure, I handed the arm to #7. He was delighted, he thanked me profusely and walked to the corner to begin absorbing it. I decided to watch, as the morphine was wearing off and I needed something to distract me from the pain. #7 went at my arm with abandon, making his way from the top down to the hand. He neglected the bones, still, but he slurped up the tendons and muscle with a smile on his face. I felt like a proud parent. He threw my humerus to one side when he had finished, and started working on the fingers and forearm. I believe he holds some of the same tendencies as me - he saved the fingers for last, much like how I save the arms for last on a gingerbread man.

After he had consumed all the meat on my arm, he thanked me with an amazing smile. He seemed to look better already, the colour had certainly returned to his face. I shall continue on as normal.

Dr Henrik

  
**Dr Henrik Lars - 25/08/XX \[SENT\]**

Professor,

I have mangled my arm in a machine and been treated in A&E, yet I am now an amputee. This may hinder my work.

Dr Henrik

  
**Professor Brynn Goldman - 09/09/XX**

Dr Henrik,

Some people have said they've seen you around campus, but I've got reason to believe that it's actually Number Seven. The second arm's a real giveaway. Why are you just letting it roam free? Do you know how much damage that could cause to the project if people suddenly spot you, with a stump where that arm should be? You have to keep it on a leash. It looks too much like you. It's even begun to talk like you.

Prof Brynn Goldman

  
**Public University Announcement - 14/09/XX**

We are saddened to announce the disappearance of Marcus Oliver Grey, a student of Biochemistry at the University. Marcus was last seen around Cardiff Central Station at the hours of 11pm. Any information on Marcus' whereabouts should be forwarded to Cardiff Police. What follows is a statement from his mother.

"Please. I know my darling is out there somewhere. His family misses him. His sister and brothers miss him. Please, if anyone knows anything, you have to tell someone. He needs to be back home with us."

  
**Professor Brynn Goldman - 17/09/XX**

Henrik.

Do you know anything about the boy?  
You have to say something if you do.  
This is not a dog. I can't just cover this up.

Prof Brynn Goldman

  
**Dr Henrik Lars - 17/09/XX**

He needed the food.

  
**Professor Brynn Goldman - 17/09/XX**

Oh fuck. Henrik, please tell me Marcus is okay.

  
**Dr Henrik Lars - 17/09/XX**

What we are doing is bigger than some student. This is the most earth-shattering experiment ever studied. A few more months and he'll be complete. Have some faith, Professor.

  
**Public University Announcement - 19/09/XX**

It is with a heavy heart that we tell of the passing of Marcus Oliver Grey. His body was found by police at lunchtime today.

Marcus was a lively and happy boy who wanted to create a cure for his father's rare condition. He had hoped that Cardiff would provide the best place to do that. He will be sorely missed by everyone at the University, not least his friends Matty and Lilith. He is survived by his two brothers and sister, as well as his father and mother.

Please forward any messages of consolation or gifts to his family at 119 Glenroy Street.

  
**Professor Brynn Goldman - 19/09/XX**

Henrik.

They found his bones, Henrik. His bones. Washed up in the bay. Did Number Seven throw them in there? Has it learnt to cover its tracks?

A boy is dead. This experiment is over.

Prof Brynn Goldman

  
**Dr Henrik Lars - 20/09/XX**

Professor Goldman,

It's a real shame. I'd thought this would be our big break. Still, immolation is probably the best course of action. Number Seven was put down an hour ago. You should've heard how it screamed. The lab has been destroyed. You'll find its body in the soot.

Ah well, onwards and upwards. I've been developing a way to transplant 09-476 into live wombs to try and prevent miscarriages. It's more aligned with our original objective. I feel like we can make a real difference, Brynn.

All the best,  
Dr Henrik Lars
