When I (18nb) was younger; early teens; I was forced to stay with my abusive dad for some weekends. I hated it. The house was located in the middle of no-ware, at the foot of Dartmoor national park. There was only one neighboring house but it had been abandoned for a few years now. The owners having left due to a fight with my dad. I was truly isolated. I don't want to dwell on the past so I will only tell you a brief summary of what happened leading up to the time I saw it.

In and attempt to toughen me up, one night my dad decided to leave me in in the woods and let me find my own way home. It was a journey i had made before in the day but not in the dark. That particular night there was thick cloud cover obscuring any light from the moon. I remember hearing the sound of my dads quad bike fading into the distance as he left me there. Alone.

After I had gotten control of my emotions I started walking, the leaves crunching under my feet with every step. It was simple, i only had to follow the trail and I would end up back at my dads house. There was nothing to be scared of. As I walked there was a noise, like the static of a TV. The crickets chirps filled my ears giving me company as i carried on down the path. It wasn't until I stopped for a short period that I heard it, foot steps in unison with my own. In a panic I looked around and could see nothing apart from the tall birch trees that stood all around me. I continued on, deciding to believe it was my imagination but then it started again. An echo of every foot step I made. leaves crunching under something else's foot.

I ran until I had no breath left in my lunges, through bushes and over fallen tress. Over my own pants of exhaustion I hadn't realized the static of the crickets stop. As i regained my stamina I looked back to see two eyes nested in a clearing. they looked at me unmoved and emotionless. I was frozen in fear. Then its head moved in a sort of nodding manner and out came a sound. It was a deep but short chirp, almost like a cough. As it vocalized the chirp became complex, gaining syllables. I'm sure that it was trying to say something, however I was too stunned to make out anything. until I heard it said my name. 

As i backed up making sure not to lose the whereabouts of it. The creature stepped forwards reviling its head to me, it was like an owl. clocked in white feathers forming dished around large black eyes. as it moved closer its head bobbed up and down, assessing me. The haze obscured any true form but i could tell it was large. I knew I was almost at the road so i just kept stepping back. my feet flowing the tier tracks of the quad bike. with every step I took it reciprocated. never getting closer but just maintaining the distance.

"Hello?" I called out. but it said nothing. As i waited for a response my concentration went and I stumbled, taking my eyes of the creature just for a moment to find my footing. As I look back up it gained distance, perhaps a meter or so.

"Hello" It said, devoid of emotion, mimicking me. I could now see long wings that hung close to its chest. The wings were tipped with claws and its mouth was full of needle like teeth. Its legs moved slowly making every step seem calculated. 

The heel of my foot touched the tarmac of the road. I had made it. Not long to go before I'm inside. as I back onto the road the creature stopped and tilted its head at me as if it was confused. It had stopped gaining ground. my steps became quicker and eventually I was clear of the woods and the bird. I turned and sprinted up towards the house. and like that it was over. 

I never told my dad about what happened out of fear he would send me back out there. I will never forget that night as I often relive it in my dreams and I wont forgive my dad for abandoning me in those woods.
