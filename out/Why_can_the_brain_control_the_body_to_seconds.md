⚠️⚠️⚠️Involves Curse Transmission⚠️⚠️⚠️

A few years ago, I stumbled upon a horror story post while scrolling through an app. One particular story caught my attention, but since it was the Ghost Festival in mid-July, I hesitated. However, being a self-proclaimed staunch materialist, I couldn’t resist reading the story at dusk. The ending was unexpectedly open-ended, similar to the cursed transmission concept from that recent Taiwanese horror movie, Incantation.

The plot was roughly as follows: "I" am a psychologist, and recently, a patient came to me for insomnia treatment. He told me that a friend of his had died after having nightmares for several consecutive days, and ever since, he himself had started having nightmares. His friend would wake up terrified at exactly 4:18 every morning, and he began waking up at 4:19 for several consecutive days. I diagnosed this as a psychological issue, and after a few days, he said he had found a Taoist priest and stopped coming for therapy. I scoffed at this.

A few days later, I started having a terrifying nightmare myself, waking up at exactly 4:20 for several days. I became frightened and did some digging, discovering that the patient had died the day before my nightmares began.

The story concluded with, "I" found the Taoist priest and learned that it was indeed a curse. The curse was passed on whenever someone recounted the nightmares to another person. Anyone who had heard the story would become the next in line to experience nightmares and eventually die after the previous person’s death. The final line was, "Now, it's your turn."

Reading the ending left me feeling sick to my stomach. After all, who wants to be cursed inexplicably during the Ghost Festival? Moreover, the story was written in a standard first-person perspective, adding an intense sense of realism. I could only comfort myself by repeating, "Materialism, materialism, materialism."

That night, I had a nightmare so terrifying that I still remember the fear vividly years later. It wasn't a typical jump-scare kind of horror; it was a more psychological and realistic terror. I recall standing at the edge of a hotel staircase, looking down at a murderer coming up the stairs, staring at me. I tried to scream for help in my dream, but no sound came out, even though my mouth was open. I kept trying to scream desperately. Suddenly, I woke up, with my mouth open as if I were shouting, but no sound was coming out. For a brief moment after waking up, I was completely voiceless.

That was scary enough, but even more terrifying was the thought of the curse from the horror story I read that day. My phone was right next to my pillow, and I hesitated about whether to check the time. I’m not sure how long I hesitated—maybe just a second.

But when I finally gathered the courage to pick up my phone, the time displayed was exactly 4:21. I remember breaking out in a cold sweat immediately, quickly turning on various comedy shows to ease the fear of that moment. Thankfully, I only had that nightmare once and only woke up at that time on that one occasion.

Reflecting on it later, what scared me even more was that, excluding supernatural factors, I woke up at precisely 4:21. Was this exact timing due to my subconscious? If so, does this mean that, to some extent, the subconscious can control the brain and body to such a degree?
Time is obviously artificially set, why can the subconscious mind of the brain be accurate to the second?
