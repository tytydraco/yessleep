This is a short story about Norbert
Norbert is an honest Christian man. His family served in the military, he lives in Washington DC, he had an equally Christian wife with 3 kids and dog, he pays his taxes on time, he has a handsomely paying job, the perfect American family.

One night Norbert was chilling in his bed, reading his bible when 65 semi trucks ran directly into his house, demolishing it. Norbert gets up from the rubble to see that his house, his kids, his dog, and his wife are dead. Norbert cannot simply comprehend any of this. Its 9:00 at night and he’s found himself into the worst possible situation of all time. He’s internally bleeding, has a concussion, 2 broken arms and an absolutely disfigured face. Norbert cannot even let out a single cry, a single word when he hears the emergency sirens go off. Norbert would look up to see what was happening but due ti his face disfigurement, he’s now blind as his eyeballs have been crushed by his skull. There is a high gigantic towering beast  that’s at least 2,000,000 meters tall. This beast is destroying the city of Washington DC, including the White House. This monstrous creature sees Norbert bumbling around the rubble of his house like a blind idiot, picks him up, and throws him into the sky as absolute full force. Norbert is soaring across the air at Mach 15 wind speeds. The wind force actually lifts his skull a bit so norbert can see, and he is absolutely terrified. Within the span of 3 minutes, Norbert has circled the earth 4 times about to reach speeds of Mach 27 and shows no signs of stopping. Norbert’s skin is staring to rip off and as he is hoping and wishing this was all a dream, he gets a reality check and hits the Effel Tower in Paris at full force. The entire structure is bent to an unrepairable degree, and Norbert actually went through the structure, unto 3 buildings and finally stopped moving after crashing into a car. Norbert passes out.

One year later…

Norbert is alive, and hates it. He has no arms, no legs, no eyes, is deaf, lost his sense of touch and is numb from the neck down. His insurance label couldn’t fix all the damages done to his house, so he’s homeless. The France government has charged Norbert with destruction of property and vandalism to a historical landmark, so he’s sitting in a prison cell for 500 years, the three buildings he crashed into were all homes and everyone in those homes died instantly so their families sued Norbert and his family. They lost the case too, so Norbert’s entire family is in debt. He also got sued by the guy who’s car he crashed into, so he’s at least 50 million dollars in debt by himself. The giant towering monster has mind erasing abilities, so nobody except Norbert knows what really happened that night. As far as everyone else knows, he’s the reason Washington DC is destroyed. Norbert’s entire family has been deported to European concentration camps to work off their debt, which by their rate, don’t be done for the next couple 13 years or so. His family has vowed to disown Norbert when they’re done with their sentence. This is the life Norbert has to live with and he’s just gonna have to deal with it. His heart is still in good condition and he was only 33 years old when the trucks ran into his house, so he’s got a lot of time to reflex on his actions.
