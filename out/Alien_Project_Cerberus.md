***Personal Log, Entry 01:*** *Jacob, Chief Engineer. Time... time is 04:37 station standard time, first cycle after the activation of 'Cerberus' protocol. I... I'm safe. I think. I've barricaded myself in the main workshop of Gamma sector. The doors, those massive titanium doors, I've welded them shut with a plasma cutter. All four sides. I flooded every seam with molten metal until the cutter started sputtering from overheating. Until it was... permanent.*

*It's quiet outside now. But just a moment ago... God, just a moment ago it was all one big scream. It all started in Lab 3. Specimen 7. Those damn spores from Drill Site Delta that were supposed to be our greatest discovery. And they were. We discovered a new way to die.*

*I saw it on the monitors before the main power went out. Lenka... our biologist... was leaning over a microscope. Then came the sound. Not a scream. The sound of cracking glass and something... wet. Fast. Before she could even turn, the alarm sirens were already wailing. Red lights pulsed, turning the familiar, sterile corridors into a throbbing gullet of hell. Cerberus protocol. Automatic quarantine. The reinforced concrete bulkheads slid shut with a deafening screech. I heard the shouts of people trapped in the hallways. I saw Dr. Evans on camera, pounding his fists on the bulkhead that separated him from the escape pod. And then... then I saw a shadow behind him. It wasn't a human shadow. It moved too fast, unnaturally.*

*Vrána, the head of security, was screaming at me over the intercom. "Novák, get to the workshop! Now! Weld yourself in and don't even breathe! We'll hold them off!" He sounded... terrified. I had never heard Vrána terrified before. He was an old hardass who'd survived the riots on the Titan mines. But this... there was pure horror in his voice. And I listened to him. While he and his people were buying time with their lives, I am here, safe. The shots from their pulse rifles have long since faded. Now, all that's left is... this humming. And the beat of my own, cowardly heart.*

**\*Time jump.\***

**Voice:** *Log Entry 14. Fifth cycle. I've conducted a full inventory. It's part of my routine. Routine is good. Routine keeps the mind in check. So: 48 standard protein bars. Each one lasts for one cycle. The water recycler is functioning at 87%, but the filter will need maintenance, and I don't have the spare parts for it. The workshop's emergency batteries... according to my calculations, they'll last another 200 cycles, if I limit all non-essential power consumption. Which means I spend most of my time in the dark.*

*I've welded the service shafts shut as well. I welded the grilles directly to the frames. It's just sheet metal, I know. But it's something. A barrier. A psychological barrier. Vrána would tell me I'm being paranoid. But Vrána is dead. His voice no longer screams in the intercom. In fact... no one screams in the intercom anymore.*

*The silence is the worst enemy. When you've spent your whole life surrounded by the noise of machines, the hum of ventilation, the chatter of colleagues in the mess hall... this absolute silence is physically painful. It puts a pressure on the eardrums. Every time I swallow, it sounds like a gunshot. Every movement, like an avalanche. I'm starting to hear sounds that aren't there. Or maybe they are.*

*A few hours ago. In the deepest darkness. I heard it. A scrape. A single, distant scrape of metal on metal. It could have been the station. Metal contracts in the cold. A perfectly logical explanation. My mind, the mind of an engineer, clings to logic like a drowning man to a straw. But my body... my body reacted to it. The hair on the back of my neck stood up. And ever since then, I've been listening. Waiting for the next scrape. And I'm terrified I'm going to hear it.*

**\*Time jump.\***

*Log Entry 42. Fifteenth cycle. It's not just a single scrape anymore. They are sounds. They're in the walls. In the floor. In the ceiling. In the ventilation shafts. My old kingdom. I knew them by heart. Every joint, every junction. Now, it's their highway. They move in there. It's not random. There's a rhythm to it. Methodical, patient. Sometimes it's scraping, other times a quiet, slick clicking. Like a wet claw being dragged across steel.*

*Sleep is a luxury. When I try for it, I close my eyes and I see them. Well, I don't see them. I just imagine them. My mind, fed by scraps from security cameras and sounds from the intercom, creates images. Images that would make Hieronymus Bosch weep. Elongated, gleaming heads. The absence of eyes. And those teeth. Silver, needle-like...*

*Yesterday, I dared. I have limited access to the central data core from my terminal. Most systems are offline, but some recording buffers remained active before everything collapsed. I found a recording from camera 3B, the corridor near the medical bay. The recording is only 47 seconds long. I see Petr, one of the geologists. He's running. Desperately trying to open the door to the infirmary. It's locked. He's banging on it. Screaming. There's no sound. And then, in the corner of the screen, near the ceiling, something moves. It's not a shadow. It's... a thing. Black, organic, and yet mechanical. It moves with a fluidity that defies physics. It descends the wall like a spider from a nightmare. Petr doesn't notice it. Until the last second. He turns. His eyes widen. And the recording ends. Static.*

*I sat and stared at that static for about an hour. And the whole time, I kept repeating one thing to myself: At that moment, I was just two corridors away from him. With a plasma cutter in my hand. But I wasn't welding his door to save him. I was welding my own, to hide.*

**\*Another time jump.\***

*Log Entry 98. Thirty-fifth cycle. It's raining today. Well, not here. It never rains here. But on Earth, back home... it must be May now. May was Ema's favorite month. Everything was in bloom. She always said the air smelled like a promise. Like the beginning of something new.*

*I have her photo in front of me. It's leaning against the monitor. She's smiling in it. It's a photo from our last vacation. We're standing on a cliff above the sea. The wind is messing up her hair and she's laughing, so genuinely, so purely. I remember that day. Every detail. The smell of the salt air. The warmth of the sun on my skin. The sound of the waves crashing against the rocks below. I told her about this mission. About Archimedes station. About the chance to be a part of history. She was proud of me, but I could see the fear in her eyes. "Three years is a long time, Jacob," she said. "Don't forget me." "Never," I replied. "How could I forget the sun?"*

*Now all I have is this artificial light from the monitor. And her photo. Sometimes I talk to her. I tell her about my day. What I ate. Which systems I checked. That the sounds in the walls are quieter today. I lie to her, of course. I don't want her to be scared. Even if she's just a photograph. Maybe... maybe I've finally gone truly mad. Maybe I'm talking to ghosts and memories because I have nothing else left.*

*I miss the rain, Ema. I miss the feeling of cold drops on my face. Here, there's only recycled, sterile air and the smell of ozone and fear.*

**\*Time jump\***

**Voice:** *Log Entry 153. Sixty-fifth cycle. It happened. It came for me. It wasn't a trick, it wasn't a dream. It was real.*

*I was working on the water recycler. The filter was almost clogged and I was trying to clean it without damaging it. I was focused. And in the silence... the silence shattered. A deafening blow against the door. The entire workshop shook. I dropped my tools. Froze. And then another blow. The metal groaned as if it were in agony. I saw the massive titanium plate bend inward, right in the middle. Hairline fractures appeared around my welds. Another blow. And another. Rhythmic, brutal, full of immense power.*

*I crawled on the floor to the terminal and watched the door's integrity on the diagnostic screen. 80%. 70%. 60%. That weld I was so proud of was giving way. A thin gap appeared between the door and the frame. No wider than a finger. And in that gap... darkness. And then something gleamed in that darkness. Two rows of silver, glistening teeth. And I smelled it. A scent. An acrid, organic smell of rot and burnt sugar. It shrieked. The sound didn't just come through the gap, it went through my entire body. A sound that tore at the nerves.*

*I don't know what came over me. Cowardice? Insanity? I grabbed a canister of liquid nitrogen that I use for cooling components. I dragged myself to the door and emptied it right into the gap. The sound that followed was even worse. A shriek filled with pain and fury. And then silence. The blows stopped.*

*For a whole cycle, I just sat there, leaning against the opposite wall, staring at the door. At that small, black gap. I waited. But nothing happened. It left. But I know it will be back. It knows I'm here now. It knows a way in.*

**\*Time jumps\***

*Log Entry 218. Ninety-fifth cycle. There was a gift waiting for me this morning. Sleep is no longer my friend. It's just a series of short, feverish escapes into nightmares. When I woke up, it was lying on the floor, just a short distance from the door. Pushed through the small gap near the floor that I had provisionally sealed after the attack. A small, metal object.*

*It took me an hour to dare to crawl towards it. It's a dog tag. Vrána's dog tag. Josef Vrána, ID 734-Alpha. There's no blood on it. It's not scratched. It's clean. As if someone... placed it there. Carefully. Deliberately.*

*This broke me more than the blows against the door. It's not just a dumb, brute force. It's not just an animal. It thinks. It's intelligent. It knows what I did. It knows who Vrána was. And now it's playing with me. It's a message. A message that says: 'We can get to you whenever we want. But it's not time yet. We're not done with you yet.'*

*I've started talking to the voices in the walls. I ask them what they want. Sometimes they answer me. They whisper words I don't understand. Sometimes I hear Lenka laughing. But it's a cold laugh. A laugh that chills the blood.*

**\*Final Entry\***

*This is the last entry. The number doesn't matter anymore. Neither does the time. The air filtration light on the main panel turned red a moment ago. The hum of the emergency systems is fading. Soon, there will be silence. And darkness. Absolute. And then, I will no longer be alone.*

*I'm sitting at the desk. In front of me is Ema's photo, and next to it... next to it lies the gun. Vrána's VP70. I found it in a locker I had previously overlooked. Heavy. Cold. There's one bullet in it. One final argument in a debate with the universe.*

*I'm not afraid anymore. Fear is an emotion for the living. For those who have hope. I have nothing left. Only exhaustion. So deep I can feel it in my bones. In my soul. I'm just an echo of the man I once was.*

*I went through all my logs. I listened to my own voice change. From fear to determination. From hope to madness. From madness to this... calm. It was a long way down.*

*I know what they do. I heard it from the infirmary before the audio failed. The sound of a ribcage breaking... from the inside. No. I will not leave them that trophy. This body is not their incubator. My death will be my own. Quiet. Fast. A final act of defiance. The last spark of free will in this endless darkness.*

*Ema... my love. If there's something after this, I'll wait for you there. I'll be sitting on our cliff, waiting to smell the rain and see your smile. Forgive me for not making it. Forgive me for not coming home.*

*This is for you. For those who might find this one day. Destroy this rock. Burn it from existence. Let nothing survive. Nothing. This evil... this evil learns. And it is patient.*

**\*The voice breaks into a quiet, broken whisper.\***

*They're coming. I can hear them. They're not in the walls anymore. They're in the corridor. The clicking is louder. I can feel the door vibrating... I miss the sun...*

**\*A deep breath. A long, tense pause. The only sounds are the fading hum and a quickening heartbeat.\***

**\*A sudden, loud, definitive GUNSHOT that instantly cuts off all sound. It's followed by the sound of a heavy body falling to the floor and something metal clattering away.\***

**\*Silence. Absolute, dead silence. For ten long, infinite seconds.\***

**\*Suddenly, a sharp crackle of static comes from the main communication console, which sparks and coughs to life. The voice that comes from it is unexpectedly clear, strong, and full of professional hope.\***

**Voice from the radio:** "...day... I repeat, Mayday, this is Rescue Vessel *Odysseus*! We've picked up your old distress beacon, we finally managed to break through the atmospheric ion interference! Do you copy, Archimedes station! We are in orbit, descent module is on its way! We'll be at your position in twenty minutes! I repeat, help is on the way! Do you read us, Archimedes? Over!"

**(A beep sounds from the radio, followed by the hiss of it waiting for a reply.)**

**Voice from the radio (after a moment, more urgent, a hint of concern in it):** "Archimedes station, do you read? Is anyone there? Jacob, are you there? We have you on the crew manifest. Hang on, we're coming for you. Please, respond..."

**\*The voice from the radio fades but doesn't disappear, mixing with the static. And into this sound of hope and despair, a new sound begins to creep in. Quiet, methodical. Scraping. Directly on the welded door. The metal screeches softly, as if a claw is slowly, patiently, pushing its way into the gap.\***

**The end.**
