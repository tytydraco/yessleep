It was my birthday, and I was really looking forward to travelling out of town with my wife and celebrating with a couple of friends. We had booked ourselves into a 4 star hotel located at the border of a small time a couple hours east of where we lived.

When we arrived, the lady at the desk checked us in. It was a two story hotel, and my wife and I had a room on the second floor. As we were headed towards our rooms, she smiled at us and wished us luck. I found this a little strange, but brushed it off and said goodnight to our friends.

Once we had settled in, we were about to go to sleep when we heard some banging on the wall next to us. It wasn't too loud, just more of a dull thud. It still bothered my wife, though, because she's a very light sleeper. I told her to try and ignore it, since it would probably go away soon. The problem was, it didn't. It got louder and more frequent, until my wife decided to call reception and ask them to get the resident next to us to tone it down. The lady at reception replied that there was no one in the room next to us.

At this point, I too was getting a little annoyed. There was clearly someone there, and they weren't being very considerate. My wife decided to go tell them to tone it down. Suddenly, the banging stopped. I waited ten minutes for my wife to come back, but she didn't return. Then, suddenly, I heard her scream, followed by the loudest bang of all.

Now, not only was I annoyed, but I was also feeling pretty terrified. I knew it was stupid, but I was too afraid to call out for my wife, so I dialled her number. I was unnerved to hear the words *"The number you have dialled is no longer in existence."*

I knew what I had to do next. I needed to go into the room. I needed to find my wife. Slowly I stood up and forced myself out of the room. I knocked on the door of the place next to us, and it slowly creaked open. "Hello?", I called out. "I think my wife's here. Shannon?" No answer. I moved my eyes towards the window, and I almost screamed. A dark sillhouette was lit up by the moons light. I couldn't tell what the shape was, but it didn't look human. I screamed and flicked on the light to see........ nothing. No Shannon. No silhouette. Nothing.

I ran down to reception, but there was no one there. I went to my friends rooms, knocking frantically at each door, but no one answered. My breath hitched as I remembered the receptionists last words. "Good luck."

I pulled out my phone to get the police. Something was seriously wrong. When I reached for it in my pocket, however, it was gone. I heard a noise on the gravel behind me and I whirled round, only to feel a sharp pain in my back. The last thing I heard before everything went back was a strange hissing noise, followed by a deep, throaty chuckle. 

When I awoke, I was on the road in the middle of nowhere. My wife wasn't there. My friends weren't there. I don't know where I am. I don't know how I got here. I don't know who's after me. I just know that I have to find my wife, and my friends. Then, I have to get them and run.
