In all the world there are thousands of creatures. Most of ones you probably know about, but there are some creatures that we do not speak about. Things that are many think to be better left forgotten. I want to make sure some of these creatures are not forgotten; for if we do not learn from the past, we are doomed to repeat it.

The first story I will tell you is from my early work, when I was inexperienced in this field. This was the first time I was allowed to go out into the field alone. It was meant to be a normal circuit around the park. It's not around the entire park of course. That would take way to damn long. Just a quick 30 miles. These circuits normally take all day, but they are pretty uneventful. You're main objective is to hit the spots that people use as camp sites to make sure no one is on the reserve who shouldn't be. People aren't allowed to camp on the reserve for the most part because of the types of wildlife that lives here. 

  
I was about half way through my circuit, coming up on another site, when I encountered it for the first time. Because I wasn't experienced I didn't know what to call it at the time, but I asked one of the older guys at the reserve and was told they're called lapsprings. Lapsprings look similar to a giant horny frog. They normally get 1'-1 1/2' tall. The main difference between a lapspring and a normal frog, aside from the size, is (as you could imagine) they're behavior. Instead of being in the water for the majority of their lives, they act like tree frogs. Crawling up to the tops of trees and using their tongues to catch birds that fly by; they get their name from what they do do when they get into the water. The lapspring slides into the water and consumes a truly massive amount of water, to the point where the animal swells to nearly three times it normal size. From what the researchers at the reserve have figured out, it does this as a defense mechanism to make predators think it's bigger than it actually is, and it uses the water as a projectile if the predator isn't warded off by the size of the creature.

  
When I came across the lapspring it was in the process of consuming water at the river that ran next to the camp site. Seeing a giant toad was not what I'd expected on my first day out by myself. I'd encountered some odd creatures up to this point, going out with more experienced rangers, but we'd never come across one of these things. I sat there on the four wheeler for a good two minutes watching the lapspring suck up water from the river when I heard a noise that sounded like a high pitched shriek from a bird, but it sounded louder than any bird I'd ever heard before and much higher pitched. Considering the strange creature I had just seen, the lapspring, I decided that whatever made that noise was something I wanted to far far away from. I quickly revved the engine of the four wheeler and sped off towards the next camp site. 

  
The rest of my circuit was pretty uneventful. I saw a few deer resting near a camp site, the four wheeler scared the off unintentionally. I came across a group of teenagers spoking weed on a camp site closer to the office on the reserve that I had to tell to leave. They, being dumbass teenagers high as fuck, wanted to argue with me that they had permission to be there, but after I told them there this area had a large population of predators, including grizzly bears, they decided to leave. I didn't tell them about the much more concerning creatures that hunted the bears, however. When I made it back to the office I told Gonz√°lez about what I saw and he explained what the lapspring was. He wasn't sure what made the shrieking sound, however, because there were a few giant birds that lived in the reserve and a couple other creatures that made similar sounds. He didn't elaborate on what those other things were at the time, but I found out a couple years later. He said "You should be glad you got out of there as quick as ya did. Pretty much everything that makes noises like that is a predator, and even if the noise maker didn't get ya, the lapspring probably would have." I didn't go out on another circuit for another month after that because I had to fly back home for a funeral. My cousin had passed away in a car crash and my parents insisted I needed to attend the funeral, even though I'd only met him once and didn't really know the guy. Not saying I didn't care that he died, but I mean who really wants to take a flight half way across the country to attend a funeral for someone you didn't know?

  
Anyway, that's off topic and I think that's about all I had to say today. I've been wanting to tell these stories for a while now and just discovered this subreddit a couple weeks ago. Y'all got some crazy stories on here, and I thought mine would fit. But for now I hope y'all have a wonderful morning, day, or night, and this is to be continued.
