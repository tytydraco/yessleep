The first thing I noticed was his hair. It was a deep, dark, crimson red. It stood out against the painting’s faded colors like a splash of dried blood.

The rest of him was just as beautiful. He was slender, with long, elegant hands. His skin might have once been marble white, but the paint had become sallow with age. His face had the “angelic” features Renaissance artists loved- high cheekbones and a perfect cupid’s bow. His eyes were not just striking- they were captivating. Impossibly wide and eerily dark. Those eyes, I would later realize, always had a look of profound sadness.

As I walked through the gallery, I found that he was in other paintings. In the older ones, he was lurking in the background: cowering from falling rubble during the fall of Rome, or lounging on the grass in a Bacchanal. In the later ones, he became the subject: Ganymede offering a jeweled goblet to Jupiter, or Saint Michael with his sword held high and his wings splayed wide.

I asked Dr. Clark about him. He gave a good-natured chuckle. “We call him ‘Il Rosso,’” he explained, “Selvaggio didn’t always credit his models, so the boy’s name was lost to history. He’s like the Venetian Mona Lisa.”

He ended his speech with one of his warm smiles. Doctor Ernest Clark looked every bit the genius he was: tall, broad-shouldered, a salt-and-pepper beard, wire-rimmed glasses. He was one of the most renowned art historians in the country, and the very last word in Renaissance Italian artwork.

I turned away so he wouldn’t see my excited grin. Three weeks in and I still couldn’t believe I’d landed this internship. Not to brag, but it was notoriously competitive. Before, I was just some art history student from a small-town college in Jersey. Now, I was at New York City’s largest art museum, helping the legendary Dr. Clark with the greatest achievement of his career. Dozens of Selvaggio’s paintings would be collected, restored, and available for public viewing for the first time in over 100 years. 

The gallery was set to open in two weeks. Dr. Clark and I were supervising its preparations. While we supervised, workers bustled around us trying to put everything in order.

Dr. Clark suddenly rushed forward. “Careful with that! Make sure it’s not in direct sunlight!” The workers groaned and tried to adjust the huge portrait.

I also moved forward to look at the painting. I’m only five feet tall, so I had to crane my neck up to see it. The painting showed Il Rosso as Saint Sebastian. He was nearly naked, tied to a tree and stuck all around with arrows. His red hair framed his face like a halo. He was staring directly at the viewer. 

“I could research him,” I said, “There has to be a record of him, somewhere. I could solve the mystery. I could make it my thesis!” I felt my excitement growing with every word.

“That sounds like an interesting research project,” Dr. Clark said. “And I’ll give you any help you need. Though I should warn you, Effie- many have tried to track this kid down. And many have failed.”

I tried to sound as confident as Dr. Clark always did. “I should at least learn *something* new.”

I stared harder at Il Rosso, matching his gaze as if accepting a challenge. Close up, I could see there were tears in his eyes.



As soon as I got to my apartment- really, my cousin’s apartment that I was subletting for the semester- I started researching. First step: the most academic of all sources, Google. I didn’t find much. Most articles just listed Il Rosso’s paintings- twelve in all- which, until now, were scattered around the world. Some tried to speculate on his identity, but had no real leads. The general consensus seemed to be that he was no one important. Not important enough for a name.

After a few hours, I moved onto academic databases. They weren’t much better. According to these articles, Il Rosso could have been anyone from a nobleman to a beautiful beggar plucked from the streets. Authors were more interested in discussing his impact on Selvaggio’s art, not who he was.

I didn’t plan on giving up. There had to be at least one clue, one thread I could follow. It wasn’t just an ambitious research project. There was something about Il Rosso that compelled me. Images of his red hair flashed at the corners of my vision. His dark eyes seemed to watch me until the moment I went to sleep. *Find me,* he seemed to say. *See. Me.*



It started out small, at first. I would hear footsteps around my apartment, though I lived alone. Small items would seem to move around when I wasn’t looking. I’d see flashes of movement in mirrors, only to turn around and see nothing. Typical haunting signs, I know. But things like that are easy to ignore. Stress, forgetfulness, suggestibility. All cause slips of the mind that mean nothing.

Two days later, I realized something was wrong. I was thumbing through a book about the painter Toulouse-Lautrec when I saw Il Rosso again. He was in one of the paintings, tucked away in the back of a café. He hadn’t been there before- a quick Google search of the original painting proved it. Hell, that was painted 300 years after Il Rosso would have lived! Yet he was in my book, a smear of vermillion paint serving as hair, two spots of black for his eyes.

Trembling, I dropped the book and picked up another. Then another. Somehow, he was in all of them! Everywhere from ancient frescoes to vintage magazine illustrations. I swear I even saw him in a comic book. Later I would even see him in other paintings at the museum. In all of them, he was looking directly at me. *Look at me. SEE. ME.*

It only got worse from there. I was walking through the crowded streets of Manhattan when I bumped into someone. After making sure I wasn’t pickpocketed, I looked up at the man to apologize. My stomach dropped. He may have been bundled up in a coat and scarf like everyone else, but I knew who he was. I felt a chill run through my body that had nothing to do with the windy fall day. I tried to speak but my mouth was too dry. He didn’t speak, either. He just stared. Then he was swept away by the crowd.

I began seeing him in more places. Sitting in a coffee shop, walking around the museum. He never spoke, but his eyes would follow me across the room. I even saw him in the elevator of my apartment building. In the confined space, his gaze became suffocating. Looking directly into his eyes made me dizzy. I felt the strong urge to reach out and touch him, to see if he was really there. But the elevator stopped, someone else stepped in, and when I looked back, he was gone.

When I returned to my apartment, I found my journal lying open, a note written inside. It was in Italian, so I’ll do my best to translate here:

*Miss Effie Briones-*

*I’m so glad you’re taking an interest in me. I promise that soon, all will be revealed.* 

*Il Rosso*

Heart pounding, I ripped out the page and threw it away. This had to be a prank, right? Except I lived alone, my door had been locked, and no one except Dr. Clark knew about my research project. 

There were no other explanations- Il Rosso was haunting me. My investigation had somehow invited him into this world, into my life. But what did he want? What was he planning to reveal? All I could do was keep researching. Finding something, anything, about him might lead me to an answer. But all I got were dead ends. 



A few days before the gallery opening, Dr. Clark asked me how my research process was going.

“Not great,” I replied. I made a show of poking around his cluttered office so I wouldn’t have to meet his eyes. “Most scholarly articles just talk about Selvaggio’s creative process. Nothing about Il Rosso himself.”

Dr. Clark shrugged, still filling out paperwork. “What can I say? Selvaggio was the genius. Il Rosso was just the face.”

I felt myself beginning to scowl. I loved Dr. Clark, but something about his flippant tone bothered me. “This kid modeled for the greatest artist of his day, in twelve different paintings, and then vanished off the face of the earth?”

Dr. Clark had stopped writing. “Some have speculated that the boy’s modeling ruined his reputation. That his family abandoned him, he had to change his name, maybe even flee Venice.”

I whirled around, face burning. “And Selvaggio was just okay with that?” I demanded. “Everyone just dumped this kid when he was no longer useful? How do you think *he* felt?”

Dr. Clark’s face darkened. For a second I thought I’d gone too far. My cheeks burned. Why was I so angry? Maybe because I could feel Il Rosso’s presence, like he was hiding between the crowded shelves. The observer who would always hear but never reply.

Instead Dr. Clark said, “I’m sure Il Rosso knew what he was risking. Sometimes great art requires sacrifice.” He returned to his papers in a way that suggested dismissal.

As I showed myself out, I grabbed a copy of the exhibit’s brochure. The back cover had Selvaggio’s painting *Abraham and Isaac*. A middle-aged man was shoving Il Rosso to the ground, face-first, holding a knife to his throat. Il Rosso’s beautiful face was contorted in a silent scream. 

When I returned to my apartment I found another note.

*Miss Effie Briones-*

*Thank you for defending me earlier today. Sometimes I am so lonely it becomes unbearable. I can’t wait for you to become my newest friend.*

*Il Rosso*

I felt my gut twist. I snapped my head around, searching for him in the darkest corners of the room. I couldn’t see him, but I knew he was still there. And I didn’t want to wait around to see what it meant to become his “friend.”



I gave up on the internet and databases, and started visiting the New York Public Library. Every night after leaving the museum, I would spend hours in the library’s dimly lit, musty upper rooms. I would have a table to myself, my only light being a tiny desk lamp and the glow of other buildings through the window. It was pretty eerie, but I’d grown to dread returning to my apartment.

Two nights before the gallery opening, I found my answer. Or, at least, a semblance of one. It was in a book retelling old legends and folktales of Venice. The book was so old the binding was practically falling apart, the pages yellow and stiff. The story was written in Italian, so I’ll translate and summarize it here.

*The Curse of Il Rosso*

*The painter Selvaggio was one of the greatest in the city. The rich and powerful adored his skilled and sensual paintings. But there was one thing he was missing- a proper muse. A rare beauty would elevate his work to new heights.*

*He found one in a youth who became known as “Il Rosso:” a captivating young man with red hair. The young man’s origins are a mystery, but Selvaggio soon became obsessed. He moved the boy into his artist’s studio and started using him as a model.*

*With Il Rosso as a subject, Selvaggio created some of the greatest paintings of his career. He made twelve in all, each more beautiful than the last. But with each painting Selvaggio’s obsession became darker. He became terrified that Il Rosso’s beauty would fade. Selvaggio could not stand the thought of the youth getting older, and his looks being marred by time. So one night, while Il Rosso slept, Selvaggio crept into his room and smothered him to death with a pillow. That way, Il Rosso would be eternally young and beautiful.*

*Since then, it has been said that the twelve paintings have been cursed. Some have said that Il Rosso’s spirit has been split twelvefold, trapped in each of the paintings. When they are united, he gains the ability to reach into our world. He haunts the individuals who are the most captivated by him, and some have said that he drives them mad. Eventually, the person will disappear, never to be seen again.*

This had to be it. Three weeks ago, I would have dismissed it as a weird old fairy tale. But it made too much sense. I was the one captivated by him. I was obsessed with finding out who he was. And now he was haunting me. He said he was lonely and needed a friend. He mistook my curiosity for desire, and now he was planning to take me away.

I needed to talk to Dr. Clark. The whole thing sounded insane, but he was the only one who might have been able to understand. 

My first impulse was to call him immediately. But aside from the late hour, there was too much of a risk of him getting freaked out and hanging up. I had to wait until we could talk in person and alone.



The next day was the final day before the gallery opening. Despite our two weeks of work, we were still ridiculously busy. By the time I got Dr. Clark alone, it was late at night, long after the other workers had gone home. We were taking a final stroll through the gallery, making sure everything was perfect. 

I wasn’t quite sure how to broach the subject. Things had been icier between us since our argument the other day. But tonight he seemed to be in a good mood- all warm smiles and witty remarks. His demeanor made me optimistic.

I wound up telling him everything- my research, the haunting, and finally, my discovery in the library. Shockingly, he didn’t freak out or question my sanity. He didn’t even seem that surprised. In contrast, I got more and more breathless with every sentence. I felt like an enormous clock was hanging from my neck, each tick bringing me closer to doom. Finally, I cried, “You have to help me to stop him!”

I stared up at him pleadingly, blood pulsing in my ears. Dr. Clark remained impassive. Eerily so, like he felt nothing at all. All he said was, “It’s too late.”

“What?” I gasped. 

“Il Rosso has chosen you. Once he’s picked someone– his new ‘friend,’ as he calls them, there’s nothing we can do to stop him.”

I backed away as if I’d been scalded. “Wait- you *knew?* You knew about the curse?”

He smiled bitterly. “Of course I did. I’m an expert on Selvaggio, after all.”

There was an avalanche of questions tumbling from my brain to my lips, but only one came out. “What will happen to me?”

Dr. Clark led me to one of the paintings. *The Fall of Rome*. “See that dark-haired woman?”

I did. She was a pretty woman with olive skin and full lips. She huddled next to Il Rosso as they cowered from falling rubble. 

“The twelve paintings were displayed together for a short period in the 1780s. There was a maid at the gallery who became obsessed with Il Rosso. One day, she vanished. That same day, this woman appeared.”

He led me to another painting, featuring merry-faced musicians. He pointed to a middle-aged man holding a mandolin. “He was an assistant to a coal baron in the 1890s. The baron used much of his fortune to hunt down every Il Rosso painting. But the assistant disappeared shortly after completing the private collection.”

Dr. Clark turned to me. My mouth hung open in horror, but he didn’t seem to notice. “You could say that Il Rosso demands… payment for his services. Maybe he gets lonely. Maybe he’s out for revenge. But every time twelve are collected, he takes someone.” Dr. Clark peered down at my trembling frame. “We art historians have to keep him happy. Give him someone who doesn’t matter.”

I choked out, “But- but this is insane! How many people have been stolen? Those paintings should be destroyed!” 

Dr. Clark laughed- a sharp, barking sound. “Really, Effie? I thought you were an art historian! These paintings are priceless.”

“Why bring them together, then? Why put someone’s life at risk? Why *me?*” My voice broke on the final word. I suddenly felt so tiny, so pathetic. So expendable.

He sighed. “As I said before, Effie. Sometimes great art requires sacrifice.”

*“You bastard!”* I screamed, lunging at him. I didn’t know what I planned to do- just attack and escape. But with ease he swept me aside. My head hit the wall, and I crumpled to the floor like a rag doll. Pain exploded in my skull, and for a split second everything went completely black. When I came to, I could see Dr. Clark looming over me. He was twice my size, easily. I didn’t stand a chance.

As I struggled to my feet, I noticed something. One of the paintings was empty. It was once a solo portrait of Il Rosso dressed up as Bacchus. And the painting next to it, of the musicians- there was an empty space where Il Rosso used to be. I stumbled away from Dr. Clark, towards the door, when a figure stopped me in my tracks.

It was tall and thin, rippling and wobbling like a mirage. No- like an oily liquid trying desperately to hold its shape. Paint dripped off the creature and into red and gold puddles on the floor. I couldn’t see its face- the yellowed paint was so intense, so vibrant, that it felt like looking into the sun. Its hair formed a crimson halo around its head. 

Dr. Clark came up behind me. “He’s ready for you. Don’t make this any harder than it needs to be.”

Il Rosso grabbed my wrist, yellow-white oil seeping into my sleeve. With a scream I shook his arm off and rushed past him, bolting out the door.

I ran through the museum, screaming for help. It was completely empty. True, it was well after closing time, but there weren’t even security guards. I ran so fast my lungs screamed with pain, but I should still hear them behind me- Dr. Clark’s heavy footsteps, and horrible squelching sounds from Il Rosso. I reached the front doors only to find them locked. I had no choice but to retreat further into the museum.

I ran into the basement, only to find that I was utterly lost. I could still hear those monsters behind me, meaning I was now trapped. I burst through a door that turned out to be a bathroom. At first I thought I’d been cornered- until I saw the window. It was high up, almost at the ceiling, opening just a few inches above the street. It would have been too small for Dr. Clark to fit through, but I could probably make it. 

I locked myself in the stall below and stood on the toilet to reach it. Just then the bathroom door slammed open. I could see Il Rosso’s paint running down the bathroom tiles.

Thank God, the window unlocked from the inside. I undid the latch and cranked it open. Somehow, I managed to haul myself up and halfway through. My hands scrambled for purchase on the flat pavement.

I felt something grab my ankle. It was too solid to be Il Rosso- it had to be Dr. Clark. He probably crawled under the stall door while I was distracted. I swiveled myself around and braced my hands against the outside wall, trying to push myself out instead. 

Dr. Clark was panting and red in the face. “There’s no point in running from Il Rosso,” he said through gritted teeth, “He’ll always get what he wants.”

I glanced at that bright, melting abomination, and the monster pulling me towards it. I felt a sudden burst of hatred burn through me like a blast of lightning. “You want a new friend?” I shouted at Il Rosso, “Well, here he is!” I used my free leg to kick Dr. Clark in the face. His glasses broke on impact, and he fell backwards with a scream. I pushed myself out the window and crawled backwards onto the street.

I couldn’t see much from that tiny window. But it looked like Il Rosso was holding Dr. Clark by the ankles and dragging him across the floor. Dr. Clark was pleading with him- first to go after me instead, then offering other people to sacrifice, then just for mercy. I couldn’t tell if the red stains on his suit were paint or his own blood. They finally disappeared through the door, which slammed shut behind them.

I don’t remember much from the rest of the night. I vaguely remember taking a cab back to my apartment and limping to bed. In my dreams I was screaming, trying to claw my way out of a pit of golden oil and blood.



I was jolted awake the next morning by my phone ringing. It was a frantic call from the museum director. Apparently, Dr. Clark hadn’t shown up to prep for that day’s opening, and wasn’t answering his phone. So, I slipped gloves over my scraped-up hands, chugged a ginger ale to fight my nausea, and went to the opening. Partially out of obligation and partially out of curiosity. 

The opening went pretty smoothly, even if Dr. Clark wasn’t there. Il Rosso was back in all of his paintings. They looked untouched, except for one- *Jesus in the Temple*. It was always a chaotic image, showing Jesus chasing out the merchants corrupting a holy place. One of the merchants hadn’t been there before: a middle-aged man with a salt-and-pepper beard. He was wide-eyed, his mouth open in a scream.

When I got home I had a new note.

*Miss Effie Briones-* 

*Thank you for giving me a new friend. I am no longer so lonely. I owe you a great favor now.* 

*Il Rosso*

I had a sense this was not a favor I wanted to call in anytime soon. 

Within a few days it became clear that Dr. Clark was truly missing. The NYPD asked me a lot of questions, as I was the last person to see him alive. I told them that we finished up prepping for the exhibit that night, and I left the museum before he did. Weirdly enough, there apparently *were* security guards placed there that night- but none of them remembered anything unusual. Security camera footage from that night was entirely static. Dr. Clark’s unsolved disappearance was a huge disappointment to the field of art history. But then the exhibition was completed, Selvaggio’s paintings were scattered again, and the world moved on. 



And me? I’m back at my small-town college in Jersey. I still haven’t lost my passion for art history. But when people offer me condolences for my mentor’s disappearance, I never know what to say. I can’t tell whether I should still hate him, or feel guilty for my hand in his terrible fate.

My feelings for Il Rosso are even more complicated. After all that, I still don’t know anything about him. I don’t know who his family was, or how he met Selvaggio. I don’t know if his murderer was ever brought to justice. I never even learned his name. In spite of all he’s done, I can’t help but feel sorry for him. His beautiful face literally wound up being the death of him. And now his soul was split apart and trapped, in the very paintings that led to his murder. He became a footnote to history. I wonder if the emotions I read in his eyes- sadness, despair, loneliness- were Selvaggio’s invention, or the result of hundreds of years of pain. 

I’m posting as a warning. I’m reluctant to trust the art history community- who knows how many other people knew about Il Rosso, and brought him sacrifices? But maybe, just maybe, those of you reading will learn the right lesson. Don’t unite the Il Rosso paintings. Keep them as far away from each other as possible. Don’t look into his story- he might target you next. And if you manage to get ahold of one of his paintings, destroy it.  Great art be damned.

This brings me to today. I was flipping through one of my textbooks when I saw him again. This time, he was lingering in the background of a Victorian ball. Even in the crowded scene, the red hair and dark eyes were unmistakable. But this time, he was smiling.
