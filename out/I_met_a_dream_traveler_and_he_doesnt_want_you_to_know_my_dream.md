Trigger warning: >!cannibalism, gore, general body horror!<

I’m a pretty unusual girl, in a lot of ways. For one, I’m a transhumanist, transgender furry. I won’t beat around the bush: if i had the chance to, I would probably become an anthropomorphic animal if given the chance. I’m also incredibly clingy person, due to a number of events I’ve had in my life.

I tell you these things mostly because I’m still trying to understand what I’ve had, and what I’ve done, in the dream I’m about to describe to you all.

I won’t beat around the bush: yes, I’ve met a person claiming to have been a dream traveler. I occasionally see these people in my dreams, and I cannot say whether they’re actually real or just a random part of my psyche. Regardless, this one was a rather old man, with greying hair, somewhat resembling king Magnifico from disney’s wish. His name, or at least what he went by, was “The Dream-Master”.

The Dream-Master, like many I’ve met before him, was a rather polite person, more joyous than anything else. He had a fixation on dreams, and how they were windows into a person’s perspective of the world and their greatest desires, or however he worded it. The main point is that he wanted to give me a gift: he approached me at the beginning of my dream, and offered to record it into a physical film. That way, I could share it with my family and loved ones. Then, I began having my dream.

Before I describe the contents of this dream, I need to make an important disclaimer. For reasons I will explain later, I am not supposed to share this dream to anyone. While I have dabbled with various spiritualities, I would not consider myself personally a believer of the supernatural. I do not truly know if the Dream-Master is a real person, nor do I know if any of this truly has any weight. If it did have weight, however, I do not know what will become of you from this reading. I have told this story before to some people, though not as in-detail, and have yet to see negative consequences, but if you believe curses are real, it would be best to stop reading here for your own safety.

If you are still here, the dream I had went as follows:

I was in the woods, enjoying a stroll across the wilderness. The trees were somewhat withered, and had no leaves, making it seems like I was in late autumn or early winter. I kept walking, going on and on for hours. At some point, I had left the trail, going straight into the deep woods to sate my curiosity. 

Night came, and as I marched onwards with a flashlight in my hand, I had heard a scream nearby me. As I shined my flashlight towards the source of the noise, I had seen nothing but a tree. The unsettling part was the feathers of the tree, for on its branches it had possessed a human mouth. Not only that, but all the plant-life around it as well. Everything had random human features, from eyes, to mouths, to even patches of human flesh and skin. The worst part was that every mouth these plants had were screaming in pain, until all around me was a cacophony of yelling.

For whatever reason, I did not mind this, and continued on. If only the plants with human body parts was the worst this cursed patch of the forest had for me. I continued on for even longer, until eventually I hit a clearing. There were no trees here, but symbols were all around objects in the clearing. This was some sort of ritual spot, and before I could realize this an unseen spirit had rushed me, and forced itself into me. 

As I was possessed, I had felt a deep sense of clinginess and dysphoria. I felt like I not only needed to be in another form, but I needed those I loved to be part of me. The spirit now inside me offered a solution, so long as I did what it had wanted. My memory over my dream becomes hazy at this point, but I still remember the visions of what I had done to appease the dark being.

Past this point, the dream becomes more iffy, and my memory becomes more difficult. The dream was like flashes of various scenes, as if I was “skipping” points of my experience. I remember talking to my mum, encouraging her to walk into the woods with me. It then cuts to me butchering and eating her corpse in the very clearing I was possessed in. I then had the same thing happen with my sibling, my boyfriend, multiple people I care about. Every time I consumed their flesh, I could hear their voice in my head, as if their mind had become a part of my own.

As this happened, I began to change as well. The more people I sacrificed, the less human I looked, like I was metamorphosing into something new. When the last sacrifice was made, and the spirit possessing me was satisfied, I had became something completely alien. I looked like some sort of dog, but completely made out of human skin. I wasn’t even hairless, there was shape of the fur, but it was all just one mass of skin, along with my eyes, my teeth, the inside of my mouth. I had stayed completely still, until with one movement I clawed at my face, and began peeling the skin off…

It was at this point the nightmare had ended, and I had visited the Dream-Master again. He looked much less joyful now, more terrified as he stared at me. He said one thing to me, the very reason my desire to write this had started in the first place: “Nobody other than you and I should ever know the contents of this dream”.

Immediately afterwards, I woke up, and was left with this message. As said previously, I’m not a spiritual person, but I can’t help but think back to this dream often. I don’t know if the Dream-Master was real, or just a part of my imagination, but if he was… what does that mean for the dream itself? Does this dream have any actual significance as a curse, or a sign? I’ve talked about it before, and nothing has happened so far, but my worry still gets the better of me.

Along with that, I’ve tried psychoanalyzing the dream itself. I don’t think it was a coincidence that I turned into a dog-like creature at the end of it, nor do I think it was that all my loved ones became a part of me forever. Could the dream be an attempt at saying something about my personal being? I’m not sure.

Regardless of who the Dream-master is, if this story is cursed, or what it may mean, the experience still kinda freaks me out to this day. If anyone else has had similar experiences as me, I would love to hear them, I’m just hoping there’s no danger in spreading this information, like my instincts are telling me there is.
