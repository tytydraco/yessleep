“As we walked the halls of the asylum, we saw pain unfiltered, unadulterated pain. What pain this building held before it was shut down for the death of so many unnamed and forgotten inmates. Inmates imprisoned by their own families unable to cope with their disabilities.” Tom recited into his phone, with the self importance only a self proclaimed author could have. As if he was telling the most important story in the world, but it wasn’t a story. It would’ve been better suited for the Halloween special for a history podcast than a book.

We were walking down the hall of an abandoned asylum. On All Hallows Eve If we couldn’t be any more cliché. It was Tom’s idea to do a little urban exploring for Halloween this year. The part he didn’t tell me was that he needed something to write a new book about, he was too proud to say that he had no ideas though. “Why don’t we do something fun and exciting? We’ve been to every haunted house in a 100 mile radius! We’ve watched every horror movie, hell most of em we quote to each other as we are watching them.” Tom said with his begging pouty face that he knew always made me melt. That’s how I found myself in this dark damp asylum listening to Tom’s very audible internal monologue.

“If that’s not the start of a best seller I don’t know what is!” Tom said as he mashed pause on his phone for the moment.

“You know this place wasn’t actually shut down for any kind of suspicious reason other than lack of funding right?” I asked sounding a little more judgy than I intended.

“Yes, I did research the same as you babe, but it’s a decent guess that horrible shit happened here when it was operating. It’s not like the mid fifties we’re prime time for mental health care. No, doubt lobotomies, electro shock therapy, and daily beatings were a common treatment in here as in any other ‘lunatic asylum’ during its time.” Tom stated with a gleam in his eye that reminded me about his passion and curiosity for the history of places like this. I nod my head to confirm he’s probably right.

As we walked and let that thought hang in the air I fumbled to get my gawdy oversized flashlight out of my backpack side pocket. Hoping Tom didn’t see the struggle, he had made several comments about the size of my flashlight while I bought it, and continued to make these comments every time I brought it out. I think he was secretly jealous.

“Besides, if my books were ‘They walked into an asylum that’s definitely not haunted because nothing exciting ever happened there and they are simply going to scare theirselves into thinking they see a ghost.’ It wouldn’t be a very good book then would it?” Tom said in a comical fake narrator voice.

Trying to hide my chuckles I replied “Okay, okay. I get your point. You can’t deny the prose though.”

“Well that’s because I’m an impeccable writer, anything I write would be just as entrancing to read.” Tom gives me a playful look. “Why do you think you are dating me after all? It’s clearly my expansive vocabulary and flawless grammar!” Wiggling his eyebrows as he said it  in a look that he thought was cute but was more like Sherlock Holmes unraveling a mystery.

“You’ve got some other traits I enjoy mister, don’t sell yourself short. It takes more than some fancy words and pristine comma placement to get me in an asylum.” I say as I pull him towards me.

“What does it take to get you in an asylum hallway?” Tom said with a grin and a kiss. “I think I want you ri-“

“Oh do you see this room? It would be perfect for my book. The scalpel on the operating table and the chairs facing it!” Tom exclaims as he runs into the room with childlike glee. That’s what I get for dating a writer I suppose, cock blocked by his “writers brain” as Tom called it. I called it having the attention span of a fish. He would start a sentence then get a thought in his head and he’s off writing in his head before ink ever desecrated the page, and there he goes.

“When standing in the operating room or treatment room as they were more keen to call it, I feel the history of this place. The history of pain and suffering, people begging for help and being answered with violence and ignorance. A silver table that could tell you stories horrible enough to bring tears to the most stone hearted. Stories of children barely beginning life, being forced to have operations under the guise that it would help them.” He said looking off in the distance as if he were thinking of the most thought provoking and traumatic memories available for this monologue.

He pauses the recording again and looks at me, “Sorry, what were we talking about?” He asks in such an earnest expression I can’t help but laugh. “We were talking about how big of a ring you are gonna get me after you make a fortune of this book you are writing.” I say as smile and give him my puppy dog eyes. “Yeah okay babe. I’ll tell ya what if this book ends up being a best seller you can pick out any ring you want.” “Really! How much does it take to qualify as a best seller?” I ask with too much enthusiasm knowing he’s fucking with me. “That’s the whole point sweetie a lot more than I’m probably going to.” He says laughing. “How many did the last one sell?” I ask. Tom’s eyes flicker with that sad look he gets when he gets ready to put himself through the emotional ringer. “About 300 maybe.” He spits out as he turns and walks off leaving me staring at the silver table.

I follow him out trying figure out a way to change the topic onto something more cheery. I walk down the hallway looking for something to ask a question on, one thing Tom always loved was educating the less knowledgeable. “So there aren’t any spooky Halloween stories about this place?” I ask knowing that will get his mind off whatever he’s bullying himself over in his head. “Yeah actually but I can’t quite remember it. I mean there’s all kinds of stories about ghosts in the windows and specters roaming the halls, but honestly if you have a haunted asylum and don’t have those stories what are you even doing?” Tom asks sarcastically, “I’d say that means your town is pretty unimaginative.”

“Exactly right! This place breeds stories like that because you can look at it and it just gives you that vibe.” Tom says gesturing to the hallway surrounding us. “I mean it’s almost impossible to not think ghosts are gonna get you when you walk in here, right?” Tom asked

“I mean yeah it’s an old abandoned asylum I’m not gonna lie and say it’s not creepy, but I think if you went into an abandoned McDonald’s it would be creepy too. These places are supposed to be full of people and noise not emptiness and dust.” I said.

“Always the skeptic huh babe?” Tom replied rolling his eyes at me, he’d always been more of a believer than I. “Sorry babe but your never gonna convince me that everyone’s spirits are still wandering around looking for peace. It’s just not how things work in my head.”

“And how does it work in your head?” Tom asked. “Well I guess my thing is there are a lot more people that don’t have unfinished business or vengeance to exact. What do they do go to heaven? And if you have unfinished business you stay on earth, why though? That only means that the people who were satisfied with their life can get into heaven? It just doesn’t make sense to me T…” stopping mid sentence I grab Tom and pull him into a room shooting off the hallway! Tom starts to talk but I cover his mouth and put my finger to my mouth as a warning. We aren’t alone.

We sit in the silence for a second when Tom gets impatient. “What? Did you see something?” He whispers. I did see something but I don’t know what I saw, it looked like a hand curling around the corner of the hallway wall. We were a little ways away from it but I’m certain I saw something. Not being able to think of the words in the moment to explain that I nod my head slowly.

“Well what was it? A crackhead?” Tom asked more curious than concerned.

“I don’t know it looked like a hand was on the corner of hallway.”

Tom snickers, “I appreciate you trying to get me in the spirit of the place sweetie, but it’s atmospheric enough without fake ghosts.”

“I’m not joking Tom I really saw something at the end of the hallway!” I reply with a twinge of irritation rising in me. What did he think I was doing trying to come up with a story for his book?

“Okay sure babe, but if someone is up there we should probably see who it is.” Tom said casually his voice returning to his normal volume.

“Why the hell would we need to see who it is? I do not want to get stabbed by a homeless man today, do you?”

“Because they might be hurt or need help.”

I swear sometimes Tom honestly thought he was in one of his books where he had plot armor. I know that his heart was in the “right” place but that was possibly one of the stupidest ideas I’d heard in my life.

“Why would someone who is hurt or need help be in here? Why would someone be in here anyway is the better question? Let’s just go we’ve seen a few rooms and I’m thoroughly creeped out, so mission accomplished!”

“Yeah you might be right sweetie it might be best to let the crackheads have the run of the place.” Tom said realizing the insanity of what he had said.

We both stood up and eased our heads around the corner trying to see if the coast was clear, we decided it was. We ease out in the hallway and start quietly making our way towards the exit on the opposite end from the corner I had seen the hand.

Twenty feet, we made it twenty feet from the door and then we heard it. A man’s scream paralyzed us, not a clear scream it sounded like he was convulsing as he screamed. Like he was mid seizure and screaming. And it was loud so loud that I would’ve thought it came from a speaker over our heads.

When it finally stopped only seconds after it began we looked at each other, “What the fuck?” Is what I said but my voice didn’t work, my lips were dry and sticky. If only Tom’s voice showed the same absence.

“We have to go check that out right? I mean who ever that was they definitely aren’t okay!” Tom said as he turned to go back down the hall. Having no desire to go back into that place I stood still weighing out the options in my head.

_“The pros of leaving are we aren’t in any danger, we get to go home and forget about this whole night, and we don’t have to find out who made that noise. The cons of leaving are… a guilty conscience, possibly leaving someone to die in pain.”_

I would like to that I wanted to go back in and make sure everything was okay inside but…

“Tom we need to get the fuck out of here right now. There’s no way I’m going back in there to find where that came from!” It came out of my mouth without hesitation no debating necessary.

Tom stopped and looked back “Go wait in the car then. I’m going to see if they need my help.” He started back down the hall.

“Wait this isn’t one of your books you aren’t the hero, why don’t we call the cops?” I whispered at him.

“Trespassing sweetie it’s a crime, and I don’t want to call them if it’s nothing and they arrest us. If you would like to go to jail then sure go out get in the car and call.” He said even toned but with a look that said that was the end of the discussion.

“Fine but if you aren’t back in 5 minutes I’m calling the cops!” I felt like shit as I said it. Like a coward who had been exposed. I didn’t even like the horror stuff like he did, I did all of this stuff for him and his books. I’m not getting murdered so he can have a good experience to write about! Fuck him if that’s what he wants.

I walked out of the hall towards the car, opened the door, sat down and locked the door behind me. Then I waited. Five minutes, ten minutes, at fifteen I started trying to call the cops. To no one’s surprise there was no phone service. If he’s not back by 11:45 I’m leaving to get help, I told myself thank God I kept the keys in my backpack.

After thirty minutes right as I started to swap seats to crank the car, I saw him. It was Tom coming out of the asylum! He was moving slow and stiff like he twisted his ankle.

“Hey are you okay?” I asked “What was the noise? Was there someone in there?”

He kept walking towards with no answer.

“Tom quit fucking with me, I’m sorry I didn’t go back in with you but what was it, I want to know!” I said trying not to give away the twinge of fear I was starting to feel. He was getting close now still making no sign or even hint that he had heard me. Then a horrible thought hit me.

_What if it’s not Tom? It’s dark all you can see is it’s a person. What if this is the screaming man? What if it’s who made the man scream?_

Panicking I turned and looked for my flashlight in my pack, trying to find it before the figure reached me. I had about sixty seconds before he was on me. Unzipping my pack I reached in my hand shooting to where the flashlight should be. I felt a hand on my shoulder latch on and start pulling me back. Flash light in hand I mash at the button on the hilt.

Light exploded blinding me for a brief second before I saw it. It was Tom, his eyes were dim and unfocused, he didn’t look like he even knew what was happening or what he was doing. That’s when I realized it wasn’t Tom, not the same Tom that I had left in that place. Tom had a huge bloody chunk out of his head showing off way too much of his skull. Then his hand found my arm, it was ice cold like a corpse, maybe that’s what he was now. He had a hell of a grip in those hands, he latched on and started dragging me back to that damned building!

Stumbling and trying to get my footing I slapped at the thing with no avail. Until I felt the flash light still in my fist. I planted my feet in to the ground enough to put as much room between the thing and me as possible and swung!

The sound was a resounding thud! The flash light connected to Tom’s head hard enough to break his exposed skull into pieces. Tom staggered his hand let go of my arm and he dropped to the ground, flash light still in his head exposing the gore of the man I loved. Now with the light it looked like his neck had been broke.

After that I don’t know what happened, I don’t remember anything. I can guess I got in my car a drove myself home to my, our apartment, since I woke up there a day later. It’s all an empty space in my head however.

I don’t know what happened in that place or what took Tom but I know I won’t be going back.
