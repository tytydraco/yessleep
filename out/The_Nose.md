I was a big astronomy nerd so I bought a telescope and set it up next to a large window in my house. I'd use it to look at various stars and galaxies. One day however, when my buddy Joe was over for beers, I decided to adjust it so I could see closer stuff around my neighborhood.

It was daytime - late afternoon in fact, and I was scanning the cars waiting at a nearby light. I knew some of these folks. They all came home from work about the same time.

"Oh my God!" I said. "You gotta see this woman."

Joe looked over at me from the sofa. "What the hell? Peeping Tom now?"

"No man. Just look." He walked over and I pointed out which car. He looked into the eyepiece and soon found the woman.

"God damn!" he said. She's into that shnoze of hers up to the second knuckle!"

"I know. I didn't even know that was possible! Must be one hell of a booger she's chasing!" We busted out laughing so hard our eyes watered.

"Guess what else?" I asked. "She lives next door. I know her."

Joe grinned. "You gonna mention it to her?"

"No man. But she's coming over in a couple of days for a dinner party my wife is throwing. Gonna be hard to keep from laughing. Why don't you come? I need someone to talk to while my wife tries to impress her friends."

Joe nodded. "Yeah, I'll be there. Be funny if she starts digging into that giant nose of hers again at the party."

The day came and my wife had the house ready. She loves planning stuff like this and so I don't even bother to try to help. It's her show. She wants it that way.

This particular party was to start with Hors d'oeuvres in the living room with wine or beer, then a modest dinner, followed by drinks in the den with music provided by a small three piece jazz ensemble whom she had hired from Craig's List. If anyone wanted to smoke, there were ashtrays set up just outside the den in the backyard.

The woman with the penchant for nose picking was named Sheila Glaston. She was about 40 and lived alone. She worked as an accountant for a law firm somewhere downtown. I'd seen her one time in her backyard expelling phlegm from her nose by pinching off one side with her finger and blowing out the other side like some redneck might do while digging a ditch somewhere.

It was about 7:15 when she rang the bell. I answered and took her coat and hung it up in a nearby closet. Most of the other guests were there already chatting it up in the living room.

Joe noticed her come in and made eye contact with me. He put his hand over his mouth as if to stifle a laugh.

She seemed normal enough. She hadn't grabbed a tissue or touched her nose at all. I told Joe we were most likely not going to get a repeat performance, especially in front of a crowd. "Oh well," I told him, "I guess we'll have to look elsewhere for our next laugh."

Just then, Sheila sauntered over towards us. She recognized me and approached with a drink in her hand.

"Lovely home you have here," she said. But it was strange, as she said it the sound and the air wasn't solely coming out of her mouth. Oh my God, she's a nose talker, I thought.

I glanced at Joe who had a mouth full of beer. His cheeks were bulging as he tried to hold back a burst of laughter. His eyes were watering and a few drops of beer were seeping out from between his lips and draining down his face out from under his hand which he had firmly placed over his mouth. His face was turning red. Any moment he was going to blast the carpet with Milwaukee's Best.

I lightly pulled Sheila's shoulder to rotate her away from Joe, lest she notice and pointed to our new kitchen cabinets in the next room. I walked her in there to have a look.

I peeked back at Joe to assess the situation. He'd managed to run outside without a spill. I could see him through the window when he finally let the beer loose onto some bushes I had back there.

Sheila was busy looking in the oven when I returned my attention to her.

"Hnnn," she said as nasally as before. "Looks like one of those new models. I prefer the older ovens myself." She finished her wine and slowly rotated the glass by the stem in her hand. "I don't normally drink but this is very good wine. Mind if I have another?" she asked.

"Help yourself. It's all on the table in the living room," I replied.

A few minutes later Joe called me aside. "Bro, I just saw that woman getting some wine. She grabbed a straw off the table."

"Who drinks wine out of a straw?" I asked.

"Nobody. But people use straws to sniff up drugs," he replied.

"Oh," I said, "that's not good."

Joe pointed towards the far side of the house. "She went into the garage."

"I got a security camera in there," I said. "Let's see what she's up to."

I led him into my bedroom and opened up my walk-in closet. Inside I had some equipment set up. All of my security cameras fed into a computer which I could us to record or just observe.

I turned on the camera in the garage and we watched on the monitor as Sheila placed he straw into the glass, submerging one end into the red fluid.

What she did next justified our eavesdropping, which I admit had made me feel a little guilty up to that point. She put the end of the straw up her nose, pinched off the other nostril, and drank the rest of the wine through her nose.

Joe just looked at me confused. "What the hell?"

"I have no idea what the hell that's all about. I'm at a loss," I said.

"You'd think that would be painful," he said. "Even a little water up your nose hurts pretty bad."

"Yeah," I replied, "there's something wrong with her. We better keep an eye on her the rest of the night."

Everything else seemed normal about her until dinner was served. Joe and I sat next to each other. We could see Sheila well from where were were as she was seated at the far end of the table.

I didn't have to worry about preparing or serving dinner because my wife was playing cook and waiter as well as host. She wanted it that way. I'd gotten in her way before trying to help so she told me to just act like a guest and if she needed me for something she'd let me know. This was perfect because I could observe Sheila uninterrupted.

Joe and I watched her like a hawk during dinner. Everything seemed normal except I swear I thought I saw a single pea get sucked up into her nose from the spoon when she brought it to her mouth. I couldn't be sure because it happened so fast. I asked Joe about it later and he said he didn't see it.

It couldn't be, I thought, it's impossible. The wine at least is feasible but actual food? How? Is it still there lodged in her nasal cavity or did it make it all the way into her throat?

After dinner we all headed for the den where the Jazz band was already set up. The lights were slightly dim and the drinks were flowing. If I hadn't been so distracted by The Nose, I'd have really enjoyed it. My wife knew how to entertain guests with class.

Anyway, Sheila grabbed a spot on the sofa so I sat next to her to get a closer look. Maybe that pea would get dislodged after a few drinks and come shooting out of her nose. The suspense and curiosity were killing me. Joe sat in a chair on the other side of her so that between the two of us we'd have both nostrils covered.

The band sounded great. Soft Jazz classics. They had a drummer who played with brushes, a stand up Bass player, and a guitarist who occasionally sang. All the guests were really enjoying it.

They did a rendition of Hoagy Carmichael's "Am I Blue", featured in the Bogart film To Have and Have Not. As soon as they started Sheila got excited. "Oh, I know this one," she said.

About halfway through the first verse I heard a faint whistle sound. What the hell is that? I asked myself. I looked around and listened. It seemed to start and stop at regular intervals. No one else seemed to hear it. Then it dawned on me. It was The Nose making a whistling sound every time Sheila exhaled through it.

I bet it was being caused by air trying to push it's way past that pea from dinner, I thought. Then something extraordinary happened. The whistling sound began changing in pitch to match the melody of the song. Her nose was singing along!

She was swaying her head slowly back and forth with the beat and taking swigs of her wine the whole time. Totally oblivious to it. You'd think she'd be embarrassed and head to the bathroom to clean the thing out or something.

It stopped after the song was over.

She kept drinking heavily and stayed late after everyone else had filtered out. By the time the band had packed up and left she was passed out on the sofa with her head tilted back like she was staring at the ceiling. Other than her, only Joe and myself remained in the room. My wife was busy cleaning up in the other room leaving us with the task of waking her and sending her on her way back home.

It was quiet in that post party kind of way. Joe motioned me to shake her to try to wake her up. I was trying to decide where on her body to touch her to make the attempt and right when I had settled on her shoulder, a strange voice could be heard.

"Wine," it said in a slightly muted tone. We both froze. Joe and I just stared at her face as the voice spoke again. "Wine," it repeated.

I had been looking right at her face and I swear her mouth hadn't opened or even twitched as the voice called out. But the voice was definitely coming from her face. In fact, the only part of her face that moved at all was her left nostril which seemed to close and open as if mouthing the word.

I started to laugh at the absurdity of it as Joe moved in closer to try to verify what he had heard. As he did the nostril started speaking again.

"What, ya deaf? Gimmie another god damn glass of wine Sparky!" it commanded.

At this Joe and I both took a step back away from her while hyper focusing on her nostril in case it spoke again. It did.

"Listen you two stooges. Pick up the bottle, pour it in the glass, get a straw, put the straw in the wine, then put the other end of the straw in my mouth. Think you can handle that or do you need me to go over it again real slow for ya?"

Joe's face was contorted in wild confusion. His mouth hung open and he tried to speak. "Whaaat thuuuh..."

I thought it must be some kind of trick. I wasn't going to play this game. No sir. So I decided to call the Nose's bluff. "Yeah right. Who ever heard of talking nose?" I asked.

At this the nostril began to flap wildly as if in anger and it responded. "Why you! If I wasn't so drunk... just wait til I get get up off this couch."

"You'll do what? You're just a nose. Or a recording device. Nice trick Sheila." I laughed.

"Sheila is passed out you ignorant moron," it snapped. "When she's unconscious or asleep I have total control over her body. I'm just a little drunk but let me try to get up."

Sheila's left arm flopped over to the side as if being controlled like a puppet from above. Her head started bobbing forward as if trying to hold itself up. Sheila's eyes remained closed the whole time.

"When I get up I'm gonna kill both of you shitstains," it threatened.

"Okay Sheila, this isn't funny anymore," I said. "Joke was a good one but now you're getting rude. You need to get up and go on home."

Sheila now pushed her way up off the sofa and managed to get on her feet. She wobbled a bit but steadied herself with her hands on the sofa. Her head remained tilted back and her nostrils were facing forward like two little black eyes on top of her head.

"Now you listen to me bird brain. How could she talk through her nose like this?" I had no answer. Her head turned to the side as if looking at Joe. "You, freakboy. Give me the bottle of wine before I bitchslap your disgusting face."

Joe complied in sheer astonishment. He put the bottle in her hand. She lifted it up as if to take a swig, but instead of putting it up to her mouth, she poured the crimson liquid right up her nose! She finished off the bottle, put her arm down to her side, let out a belch through her nose, and then stumbled slightly to her right.

"Oh that hit the spot," it said.

Joe was totally confused. "What the hell is this?" he asked.

Sheila then swung the empty bottle up and cracked Joe in the head with it causing him to fall to the floor.

"Shut your fat mouth bitch!" it said. Then it turned it's head as if to look at me. "As for you cupcake. You still think I'm Sheila? You wanna tangle hotpants? How 'bout it? You wanna lock?"

I backed away thinking Sheila was some kind of multiple personality psychopath. The thing started to walk towards me slowly as it continued it's barrage of insults and while it did, the Nose began to change. It got really red and started pulsating. I swear as it spoke it started to grow in size.

"You know something? You always were a stupid little man. Mowing your lawn with your headphones on. What you listen to on that thing, Tiny Tim? I bet you do. Always waving at Sheila with that goofy grin on your face like a god damn fool. Wearing those short bus shirts. You pissed me off Blockshoe. And now you gotta pay."

By then the Nose had grown to about the size of a grapefruit and had darkened into a gray color. As it spoke, little sharp teeth had emerged around the inside rim of each nostril.

Joe had stood up behind it and had removed his belt which he was about to use to strangle it. The Nose had sensed he was there I guess because it reached out and grabbed Joe by the throat and shoved it's nostrils up to his neck where they bit into his flesh letting loose a cascade of red down his neck.

I lurched forward intending to restrain the body, but a long, thin, slimy tentacle protruded out of one of the nostrils and wrapped around my neck. It lifted me off the floor and slammed me up against the wall where it held me while it seemed to finish drinking Joe's blood from his neck wounds.

I was trembling in absolute horror and fright as Joe slid to the floor and The Nose turned it's attention back to me. The Nose was now the size of a human head and the teeth had grown to match.

"You freaken wussie!" it said. "You can't even defend yourself against a woman. What kind of man are you anyway?"

Just then I had an idea. I replied with confidence. "I'm the kind of man who can buy wine." It paused. "I can even stash some for you in your yard for after Sheila goes to sleep at night."

"Oh?" it said. "She'll never hafta know?"

"That's right," I replied. "It'll be our secret."

"Now that's more like it Sparky. I think we got a deal. Put it under the bushes on the side of the house. She never looks there. You're gettin' smart cookie." It lightly slapped my cheek. "Imagine that."

It set me down and lurched out of the house like a Zombie. I checked up on Joe and he was still alive.

It was hard coming up with an excuse as to how he got injured but I did. He spent a couple of days in the hospital where they had to give him blood. I didn't hear from him for over a week.

I'd started leaving a bottle a night under the bush and everything seemed to return to normal. Then one day I got a call from Joe with some shocking news. He had felt sorry for Sheila, decided to try to help her, and the two were now dating.

I told him he was crazy. The Nose might kill him if she fell alseep while he was there. He said he loved Sheila and was willing to take the risk.

Then one night the phone rang and it was The Nose. "I just wanted to say something," it started.

Just then I heard Joe in the background. "No, just hang up. Don't bring him into it." Then I heard a loud slap sound followed by The Nose yelling at him.

"Shut up bitch!" it said. Then it addressed me again. "Sorry about that. Anyway, what I wanted to say was that I'm sorry about the other night. You know that isn't really me. I'm really nice. It was just too much wine. You know I been thinking about you lately."

I hung up the phone, packed my bags, convinced my wife to get in the car, and we got the hell out of there and never went back. We had a moving company get our stuff and bring it to us, and a realtor sell the house for us. We left no forwarding address and settled on the other side of the country.

About four months later I saw on the News that Joe had been arrested for murdering Sheila. I went to see him in prison one day and he told me he was doing okay and that they had a great support group in there for battered husbands.
