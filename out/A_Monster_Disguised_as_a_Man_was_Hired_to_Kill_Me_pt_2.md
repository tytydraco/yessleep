I woke up with three silhouettes surrounding me in my hospital room, so of course I tried to scream, who the fuck wouldn’t? Nothing came out, but I kept trying and trying and trying. My heart started banging so hard that it felt like drums were going off in my chest and head. My legs were shaking so much that my blankets fell off my bed. Then they started to circle me. It looked like they were holding hands or some shit, and just circling me, laughing and laughing. I had to cover my ears, but the noise didn’t drown out at all.

Then they froze and became one again as the silhouettes turned to a single human, the same human I had seen in my brother’s apartment. This time, though, his suit was a dark gray. 

“Hello, Carlo. I know they don’t allow visitors at night in the hospital. They have so many studies that say a quiet environment with proper rest can really foster healing! I want to be considerate to others, so I’ve dampened the sound in this room, you could say! No one can hear me or you right now.” 

I stared at this creature, his slicked back hair glistening under the lights in the room. He took out his handkerchief from his breast pocket and offered it to me, pointing at the dried blood around where they stuck my IV in. they had some trouble finding my veins. I didn’t reach out, I just stared. He shrugged and put the handkerchief back. It still was stained with dust and blood from my brother’s apartment. 

“You’re scared, I get it. But I’m not done yet, you still have time, Carlo!” 

I looked at this monster and was finally able to utter a phrase: “What the fuck are you?” 

The monster chuckled and let out a sigh. “Whatever the fuck I’m paid to be!” 

“Why are you toying and fucking around with me? Why not get it the fuck over with?” I asked. 

The monster grinned, revealing his sharp teeth to me. “Well, it’s more fun this way. I’m very expensive and don’t get hired by you thugs often. And plus, what’re you gonna do? Realize I’m taking too long and find a way rat me out, huh? Think you have a chance to save yourself? Who the fuck would believe you? Where would you go? You’re a fugitive and I can find you anywhere, so don’t get any cute ideas!”

I slouched back in my bed, but winced in pain from my back stitches. 

The monster thought this was funny and laughed. He pulled out a scalpel from a jetted pocket inside his blazer. “I see your stitches still hurt. Lemme help you out there!” The fucker pinned me down by my face and cut down my arms. I started howling in pain, but nothing came out. The monster flipped me over, tore open my gown, cut along my stitches, and began ripping them out. I continued trying to scream, but there was still no noise. The monster flipped me again onto my back, causing me to feel a sharp, hot pain near my shoulders. As blood poured out, I began to have a warm, wet feeling all along my back. 

I blacked out, again. Two days later, I woke up after another blood transfusion. I got yelled at by the surgeon for ripping my stitches out. Don’t know why I’m getting the blame, but what the fuck would I tell them? A man with superpowers, sharp teeth, and a color changing suit did it? The monster was right, who the fuck would believe me? 

The doc wanted to keep me for observation, and also told me that some men came by to talk to me, said they were from the FBI. Had a warrant and everything. I checked out a couple days later against the doc’s advice, but I couldn’t talk to the feds. Who the fuck would believe me, anyway? 

Once I was out of the hospital I had nowhere to go, so I decided to walk back to the apartment for God-knows-what, only to see caution tape and cops outside the building and people on the fire escape. 

Outside on the fire escape were the two feds I recognized, the ones I spoke to a few weeks ago. Before they could see me, I slipped away. I realized where I had to go to figure shit out, I needed to go back to Brooklyn and talk to the boss directly. I’m sure he’d kill me on sight, but that would be the death I need. I can’t take this torture anymore, being beaten down and toyed with like some piece of fucking meat by this goddamned monster. 

I went down to the Amtrak station and used a fake credit card to get a ticket. A couple hours later my train to Penn Station came, and as I sat down in the empty train car, a familiar face sat across from me. 

“Looks like it’s just you and me, Carlo!” said the monster. He still took the shape of the human, his slicked back hair, pale white skin, and a clean, fitted three piece suit. This time it was bright green. 

“Get the FUCK away from me!” I screamed as he stood in front of me. I began to back away and run to the door of the train car, but it looked like it was welded shut. 

“Where the fuck are you running to? Back to New York? They hate you there, you rat fuck!” The Monster began to laugh as he grabbed me and threw me across the cart. I got up and tried opening the other door, but that was also welded shut. What the fuck was going on here? I looked around quick, every possible exit was welded shut. “I see you’ve noticed my craftsmanship, Carlo. I did it quickly, I wanna make sure you see this!” 

The monster picked me up, opened his mouth all the way, and dropped me in his mouth. I felt like I was falling for days, then woke up in the middle of a sidewalk. I looked up and saw the sky was red, the sun was not there, and the building I was in front of was one that no longer existed: the apartment building I grew up in.
