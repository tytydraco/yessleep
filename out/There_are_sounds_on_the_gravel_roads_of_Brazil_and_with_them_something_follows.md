[Part 1]

I’m so glad I have found a place such as this so I can share something with people who can, maybe, help me ease a sense of dread that has been creeping the back of my neck whenever my hands grip the steering wheel of my car heading a road, either at night or day. 

I should start apologizing in advance for any typos or mistakes since, as you may have inferred by the title, I’m not a native English speaker. I’m a Brazilian guy in my mid-thirties who happens to like… or, better yet… used to like to travel by car a lot. It goes without saying that in recent years, traveling by car has become the main option for people who live a hard working life to earn money and can save enough for a trip, since leisure options in Brazil are seriously impaired by the economic situation of our country. Many can say even that is a privilege. Well, not anymore, but I’ll get there soon, I promise. 

Before, though, I must add a little personal information. The thing is… even when traveling by plane became affordable during the mid 00’s, when an economic boom lifted dozens of millions from poverty to middle class, I was still a road trip guy. Much of that comes from the fact that my parents have never married each other, with my mother leaving my father having barely healed from a c-section. My father was heartbroken by that and with much persistence, was able to let my mother share custody: she would be with us during school time and he would be us during vacations. And that’s the moment when hitting the road became a significant part of my years.

I also happen to have an extremely good memory, with lively memories as old as when I was two. Many of them revolve 1000km+, 2000km+, hell, even 3000km+- and I’m sorry for using the metric system, americans- road trips that could go on for a whole week before me and my father even reached our destination. He would always say the road was a destination in itself and one day I would put to good use his knowledge on what to do behind the wheel, another forecoming of what I’m about to share with you, guys. I was 5 when my father started putting me on his lap while driving to let me learn how to drive with a stick. I was 12 when he started teaching me how to drive, lessons taken on an ‘82 white kombi worned out from having been driven for over 200k km. Since none of those were actually legal, all those experiences took place on roads where you wouldn’t meet a single soul for dozens, maybe hundreds of kilometers. 

Given that Brazil is as big as a continent, it’s not unusual for a main road in Brazil to cross the 1000km mark in length, with adjacent roads intertwining thousands of small villages who, otherwise, would only be able to be reached by a riverboat or, I don’t know, horses, maybe. The building of these roads came with no small amount of murmurs from villagers, constructors and travelers who would spread all kinds of creepy rumors about the great wild landscapes they were invading which, according to them, were not empty of… things. There was never ONE specific thing: aliens were a favorite, with sights of lights in the sky being actually no big deal since probably the 80’s, with a special rise to fame during the 90’s. And before and after that people would claim to see all sorts of cryptids when traveling by horseback, cars, trucks or boats. Most of these cryptids have always belonged to Brazilian folklore, such as werewolves, ghosts of dead women, river sirens and other less known beings. Modern days have brought the arrival of a whole new batch of terror tales: chupacabra attacks, giant prehistoric boas. The thing that ties all these things together is that those were sightings. And, with the omnipresence of smartphones ravaging our country, sightings could be easily proven with any recorded video. There were some, but always blurred and too far away enough to scream FAKE at them even if watched by the most gullible idiot. And, trust me, there’s an endless amount of those here. So, sightings became less and less regular, many of those cryptids going back to being legends of our folklore. Emphasis on many, for at least some of them having survived by a small but significant change: there were no sightings anymore. But there were hearings.

Which leads me to the situations that culminated in this plea for help. My father died many years ago of dementia. He lived his late years in a city 1200km from where I live, a small countryside city near the border of the states of São Paulo and Paraná. To get to that place I would have to: 1- take a plane trip to São Paulo, the city, and drive half a day on privatized roads littered with very expensive tolls; 2- take a VERY expensive plane to a city in Paraná and drive two hours on another privatized road, paying 1/10 of a minimum wage in tolls or; 3- drive from my city to his city with the knowledge he taught me on how to avoid tolls, road that were very unsafe for a less experienced driver. Or so I thought. It was during those last years of my father that not only memories were unlocked, but those hearings became a mix of obsession and terror for me. Earning the salary of a teacher I could not afford to be with him in his final years by choosing any option other than number 3. And, what for some could be called a privilege, has been keeping me up nights at bay years after my father was long gone, since I’ve been dealing with his will and also have been needing to travel over and over on those damn roads.

Of course the first time I heard something and registered happened the day dementia took over my father. He had a caretaker in the early stages of dementia who would make sure he would take his meds properly. He was fine, besides a couple of incidents while trying to drive to my siblings' city in Paraná. He would black out, according to him. I now have my own theories. With his dementia creeping in further and further, even if slowly, he started to become a religious person, something odd since he had always been a very layman person himself. Most specifically: he became a spiritist. He would talk for hours about reincarnation and believing in otherworldly beings reaching out to us either to help us or… else. I couldn't bother, being a strong atheist myself, but out of respect to him I would listen and nod to anything he would say in those years. But something inside of me started to rot and I started to hate it and blame it on his disease. Being raised in a catholic house and leaving religion behind me had put me in an insensitive skeptical place I can’t afford to go back, cause even if spiritualism can’t touch on what’s out there, it sure has met… something.

It took one trip from his caretaker for all things to go downhill. When my older brother called and told me my father was in the brink of dying, having been found alone and unconscious at home with his blood pressure spiking by a neighbor, the caretaker nowhere to be found, I did the only reasonable thing I could do: I told the principal of the school I teach my situation, packed a couple of bags and headed straight south to meet them at the hospital my father was on ICU. That was the last time I took a road remembering my catholic upbringing and doing the sign of the cross before turning the car keys in the engine. 

There’s something oddly eerie, though undeniably fantastic, about the roads and dirt roads of the states of Goiás and Minas Gerais. When you avoid the main roads and take twists and turns on adjacent roads there’s a vastness of emptiness where no cell phone reception goes for hundreds of kilometers, let alone the relieving sigh of a person. The radio still works, though, at least local roads, usually belonging to a church. I would turn them on just to distract myself from the worrying thoughts that any responsible, but slightly anxious driver has while taking roads less traveled nowadays by people than by wild animals. That specific day, though, a minister of a church started talking about a part revelations and it struck to me not on my ears, but in the lizard part of my brain: he started reading Daniel 5. Right in the beginning my surroundings became blurry and all that existed was the inside of my car. And right at the beginning, as soon as he got to “As they drank the wine, they praised the gods of gold and silver, of bronze, iron, wood and stone. Suddenly the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall, near the lampstand in the royal palace. The king watched the hand as it wrote. His face turned pale and he was so frightened that his legs became weak and his knees were knocking.” his voice gave way to static, but it wasn’t coming to the speakers. It was in my brain. I probably had driven a couple dozen miles on autopilot when a song snapped me from my daze. It was Nick Cave’s Red Right Hand, an odd choice of a song to be played by a radio in bumfuck nowhere, Minas Gerais. I lit up a cigarette, shaking, and stopped the car. Bad decision.

Dusk was starting and I stopped next to an incredibly worn out fence, probably from a farm that belonged to a man so filthy rich he didn’t even know it was his, so nobody was taking care of it. I was still almost 90km from the border of Minas Gerais and São Paulo and the nearest city was over 140km from the border. Out there, with the light of the sun dawning on me and my car, the wind was rustling the tall grass growing wildly. At first those rustling sounds were pretty calming. But with the dimness of the sunlight the sense of emptiness of that place started to creep inside of me. For the second time in just minutes, my lizard brain was engulfed by noise, the white noise of wind rustling through tall grass. This time though, I don’t know why, or how, I could feel a presence. It wasn’t calming, but malevolent. Ancient. The road was half asphalt, half gravel, long being forgotten by the government. I could feel it on the gravel. I could… hear it there. And it could read me back. It could read my thoughts. And it was lusting after and starving for the ever growing fear creeping in my mind. 

Instinctively I moved my thoughts to a more pressing issue: my father at the ICU. Only then I noticed that the gravel around me stopped shaking, which was alarming cause I failed to notice it started to pop up like water poured on a scorching pan around me. A gulf of… air, probably, rushed to the grass behind me so fast it bent the tallest of the leaves. It made me shiver and run straight to my car. As I sat on the driver seat, fear coming back, I could hear the sounds of gravel knockin the engines under my car. I turned it on and that fucking song started blasting at the speakers. I switched it of. That song has always creeped me out. I turned on the headlights and started thinking about my father again. In those thoughts I could find a pretty reasonable explanation for everything: my nerves were cracking under the possibility of losing him. Promising myself to not stop until I got to the next city, I pressed the accelerator and started driving.

It was only at night that the lights of the city became visible. I had to drive carefully, which also means slowly, on that sloppy road, If I wanted to get there with my car in one piece. And myself, for that matter. The asphalt morphing to gravel and back to asphalt could be a deadly slippery trap for a car over 80km/hour. I made those 200km in no less than 3 hours. When I was about to get there, I needed to pee, something I was able to ignore to the point of my bladder hurting while focusing only on the road. The last 10km where a shortcut: a dirt road through a sugar cane field inside a farm. There were still workers leaving the farm, so I decided to stop there and relieve myself, not caring that it would cover my sneakers and part of my pants in pee mud. A truck passed by me, leaving in complete darkness, but with a sky I could gaze for hours. My father used to talk to me about constellations and that warming thought crossed my mind while I was looking up as I always do while taking a leak. To less informed, this is not a wise decision in the wild, as poisonous animals are more active at night and nasty snakes can feel threatened but a 6’0 size monkey peeing near them - and sorry for non-Americans for not using the metric system. 

All of a sudden it was cold. And all of a sudden it had passed 3:34 hours. It was 5 past ten. I took a 3:30 hour leak. The tips of fingers were numb from the cold, as was another tip in my body that was exposed to the cold and dry wind of Brazilian winter in São Paulo at night. The dryness of the air, even amidst acres of sugar cane fields, was about to shut my throat completely. I had never needed water like this before. I came back to my car thinking only about drinking water and, as my thirst was quenched, something else started to fill me in: that lust and that hunger I felt 200km ago. My throat closed immediately, full of water, which made some of it go to my lungs and most of it straight to the inside of the windshield and the dashboard of my car. I was coughing in pain, my vision blurred and I saw dots of light blinking as my eyes recollected what was around me. And there, in the windshield, in the dashboard, where there was water, there were… hand prints. Inhuman, deformed, twisted and claw-ey hand prints being clearly visible where the water had splashed. It couldn’t be blamed on pareidolia since they all looked the same right and left hands, fingers coming to my direction. I turned the keys on the engine so hard it was amazed I didn’t break them and the lights hit a mist that just wasn’t there seconds ago. A foul stench akin to the ammonia people use to feed young sugar cane smeared the inside of my car as the mist creeped in. As it became more and more foul, my brain started again to register that presence, now in the form of a noise. A humming noise, old as wind through the ships of an abandoned church, but… menacing. Lustful. And starving. 

I have never felt fear like that before. I pressed the accelerator like I was on a perfect road, not a dirt road full of bumps and uneven parts of it caused by the coming and going of trucks full of workers and stacks of sugar cane. Somehow, the car managed to get to the main road without bending a rim. I made the mistake of getting on the road without looking if a car was coming. A car wasn’t. A truck was. I wasn’t smashed to a pulp by a hair’s distance, but my car still shook enough to lose stability and leave the road. The truck driver stopped the car and get off the truck swearing at the top of his lungs. The lust came again. Red right hand started playing inside my car. The truck driver noticed. He asked if she was ok. I didn’t reply but my face did enough that the driver asked me, now afraid, with his hands, to come over. As I got closer to him, he asked me again if she was ok, now pointing at my car. I refused to look and asked who. He flinched his eyes, opened his mouth and told me to leave that road. I asked again who. He only said “her” and got up in his truck, leaving in a hurry. When the truck lights hit me I turned to my car, which was now bathed in light, just enough time to see the fading of a shape with floating long hair, inhuman deformed twisted claw-ey hands pressing the windshield, no face features. It was fleeting enough to be passed by as a side effect of the scare from almost dying and the lights of the truck hitting my eyes, but the driver also saw something when it was pitch dark.

There was reception and I’m not proud to say I called insurance and asked for a winch. On the road, I refused to get into my car. My father came into my mind briefly, which made me feel like a coward, but the insurance company told me I would only have to wait 40 minutes for the winch. Those 40 minutes were filled with that humming noise, which crept above the crickets, birds and other night animals. Their noises became sparser and sparser by the minute, as if the wild life there, including plants, knew there was something there they should avoid keeping me company. And I could feel its intention growing stronger inside of me, feasting on the uneasiness that seeped deep into the core of my very being. I couldn’t be happier if my father himself came to my rescue when I saw the winch coming. We small talked and I still remember his words about how those words at night could be a treacherous place to be stranded on. Behind his voice the old church humming noise became a thud. That nasty hand caressing the hair of the driver. That was enough to get the last ounce of energy I had and I fell asleep all the 40 minutes drive to São José Dos Campos. A gush of fresh air filled my lungs. I now knew it couldn’t reach me in the city. At least not the big city. I slept in my car, feeling no presence of whatever that… thing… was. 

Thousands of accidents happen every year on the roads of Brazil. I don’t know exactly why, but I have a feeling something is feeding on it. But I’ll have to leave more to later, since I have to hit the road to talk to my siblings about our father’s inheritance.
