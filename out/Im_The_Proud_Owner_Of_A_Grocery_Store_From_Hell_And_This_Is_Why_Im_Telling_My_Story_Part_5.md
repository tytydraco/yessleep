(Part 5)

Maybe I should have been paying more attention to what I had ahead of me, instead of the nightmare I had left behind. I couldn’t stop thinking about Sheriff Paulson, how he looked as though he had only disappeared a few days ago, even though almost thirty years had passed since he’d gone missing. I couldn’t stop thinking about the vein-like tendrils that had emerged from the wall to consume him. I couldn’t stop thinking about how this place–or part of it, anyway–was somehow *alive.* 

Sweat streamed down my forehead; my shirt was already soaked. The air had gotten warmer…thicker somehow…and it felt like no matter how heavily I breathed, it just wasn’t enough. It was impossible to tell whether the ‘pipes’ and ‘wires’ that I was dodging were organic or mechanical, but it was clear that pretty soon the path would be too tangled to move forward. I glanced left and right, but the other passages looked even narrower. 

I took another deep breath that felt far too shallow. It was time to consider turning back. As I turned around, however, I realized that going back was no longer an option. The gruesome tubes that lined the walls were rearranging themselves, creating a flesh-colored web to block my path. I had a knife to hack through them with…*in my pack*, which I’d lost in the fight with Sheriff Paulson and his murderous shotgun. I stopped moving and forced myself to think.

When I had come across the staircase a few hours before, all of my thoughts had been focused on finding some kind of structure that led to somewhere else. Likewise, Sheriff Paulson had clearly felt trapped and threatened by his surroundings. *Could it be that the place was feeding on my fear, my claustrophobia?* If I could concentrate my thoughts on something else…

An image flashed through my head. My grandfather, holding my hand while we walked through the aisles of Pop’s. We had just been fishing on a humid summer morning, and I was starving. Grandpa Eddie was telling me that we could split a carton of any ice cream I wanted–so long as I didn’t tell mom. I fixated on that memory as I moved forward, recoiling at the touch of the sticky touch of the strands that blocked my path. 

It wasn’t enough. Maybe I just couldn’t keep my mind off of the slowly-constricting tunnel around me; maybe I had been wrong all along, and my fears and fantasies played no role at all in shaping the impossible space around me. One it swallowed me up–just like it had swallowed Sheriff Paulson, Grandpa Eddie, and who knew how many others–none of it would matter, anyway. The strands were too thick to push through now, and with every passing second, the tunnel became just a tiny bit tighter. It was going to crush me to death. 

I shut my eyes and accepted my fate. If I was going to die, at least I wanted to do it with a beautiful thought in mind. 

*A summer day. Fishing with Grandpa Eddie. Ice cream, any flavor I wanted–*

I gave one final push. The wall gave way: as constricting as it was, it had only been a thin membrane, one which resealed itself the moment I was through. I was back in the freezer aisle! Something squirmed in the distance, where before the endless rows of refrigerators had disappeared into darkness. There was a wall there now…but it was moving. I tensed up, ready for anything–

Except for what appeared. 

An eye opened in the wall. It was grotesquely large, over five times my own size, yet I recognized it. *It was my grandfather’s!* It watched me for a long moment, its expression unreadable, then vanished.

I was too stunned to move–until I realized what the appearance of the wall meant. There might be an end to this place after all! If I could focus all my thoughts on the store–not on escape, not on terror, just on walking through its aisles one more time–

*Beep...beep.* 

I had spent so long on the other side that at first I didn’t recognize the sound of the automatic checkout. 

An old woman in the dairy section dropped the block of cheese she was holding as I passed, and she wasn’t the only one who was staring. I realized how I must look: filthy, bruised, and bleeding, with a two-day growth of beard on my face and terror in my eyes. I could hear casual conversations and muzak playing softly from the speakers. The products on the shelves, the overhead lights, the length of the aisles…they were all normal, safe…or so I thought. Was there really any way to know whether I had actually returned to where I’d come from, or whether I was just lost in yet another pocket dimension inside of Pop’s Grocery?

I didn’t have an answer then; I still don’t. All I can do is stick to the plan and try to live my life as best I can. After I cleaned myself up in the bathroom, I went to the Manager’s Office and wrote a brief speech–with the door open, of course. In it, I outlined the importance of not being alone in Pop’s Grocery, of leaving doors open, of staying focused on reality when fear began to change it: all of the lessons I’d learned during my three nearly-fatal explorations.

The younger employees rolled their eyes when I announced the new store policies, but Irene nodded approvingly. The subtle warnings she’d tried to give her coworkers over the years were finally being made official.  I hoped it would be enough. 

Until now, those instructions to my employees were the closest I came to telling anyone about what I underwent on the ‘other side’ of Pop’s Grocery. I’m still not sure whether telling my story is the right thing to do. I can’t shake the feeling that the forces present in places like Pop’s are sentient somehow. Maybe it wants the store to be successful, to increase its chances of catching prey. Maybe it let me go knowing that I would share my experience, potentially luring in other foolish explorers. 

That’s a chance that I’ll have to take. 

I need the world to know that the hungry places exist. I need people to be aware that there worlds hidden beneath the surface of this one, worlds that thrive on fear and pain–
