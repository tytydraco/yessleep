I live the best part of my life online. It’s a sign of the times we live in, I guess. There are the mundane humdrum happenings that occur in our lives offline- the boring day to day droll occurrences that one can usually set their watch to, and then there’s the amazing things that we are lucky enough to witness via the screen usually glued to our hands. There’s no comparison, really. Content curated by professionals who are successful enough to have millions of followers watching every video and upvoting every hilarious meme, versus boring work and the strained relationship with our folks and loved ones? YouTube and social media wins that one in a landslide victory, in my opinion. Candy, or vegetables?

My job painting apartments is menial, lots of repetition. The only real variation is that every other apartment is mirrored opposite the ones next to it. Kitchen on the right, bathroom on the left in this one. Bathroom on the right, kitchen on the left in that one. Over and over again, ad infinitum. I dip the roller in paint, and apply it to a section of wall, dip the roller, apply it to another section of wall, over and over and over again until it’s quitting time. If I finish an apartment before it’s time to get off, there are plenty of others to move on to. Every… single… day. Six days a week. 

Repetition is half of the formula to insanity, I say. One of, if not the ONLY thing that helps in keeping me sane is a decent signal on my phone and a single bluetooth earbud. Having some sort of dialog- whether that be listening to an entertaining YouTuber doing a let’s play, to channels that narrate Creepypastas- I find helps in the passage of time while working. It helps my mind wander while my body goes on autopilot, thus finding an hour long story by one of my favorite channels that I haven’t heard yet is like a gift from the content gods. 

One of the longest work days I can remember was the day that my earbud fell out and landed directly in my paint bucket. I cursed the universe as I watched it sink. It happened early in the day too, so I was forced to weather the remaining six hours with nothing but my own thoughts and the sound of my paint roller smearing on the walls. I had lost the other earbud somewhere months ago, so it’s not like I had a spare one charging somewhere, and by the end of the day I resolved it by buying two brand new pairs so if something like that ever happened again, I’d have no less than three backups. 

I decided to treat myself, buying a cutting edge and top of the line brand. When one uses a product for most of the day, every day, it helps to buy quality, because it’s not just at work that I use them. When I’m driving, washing dishes at home or doing household chores, or just grinding out levels on a video game, there’s always some audio going on in my ear. Listening to podcasts while I’m folding laundry, reviews for new games and movies while I’m walking the dog, ten interesting facts about \*insert topic here\* while I’m eating dinner. It just helps me get through my day. And my nights too, falling asleep listening to spooky stories has gotten to the point where if I forget to charge my phone or earbuds and one of them dies before I fall asleep, I might as well get back up for a bit while the battery charges. 

It may sound weird to some people, trying to follow a narrative while also trying to fall asleep seems like it would be counterintuitive, but just like how some people need a fan or a TV going, there are thousands of us falling asleep to a soothing voice telling a macabre tale every night. Probably millions, given how the technology has evolved in prior years. 

When I received an email saying I’d won a chance to test out the next step of that evolution, I ignored it. I hadn’t signed up for any contest or sweepstakes that I was aware of. Probably just spam, I thought. When the physical letter showed up in my mail stating the same, I took it a little more seriously, but eventually chalked it up to the spammers just being persistent. More junk mail. They got my email and were able to find an address that matched it, probably not that hard to do considering how many sites I’ve used that email to sign up for over the years. I was well aware that people leave a digital footprint, along with a treasure trove of data for advertisers and scammers alike. I always just chalked it up to the price of admission as I dropped the letter in my trash bin without even opening it. After a few weeks, all of my brushing off and ignoring what I thought was a scam culminated with a knock at my door.

“Why hello, sir. We represent ToxiCorp, and we understand that you recently purchased our product- two pairs of our Premium Earbuds?” the gentlemen asked. He was an older fellow, wearing thick coke bottle glasses and sandals. Before I could even answer though, he went on. “We’ve attempted to contact you via mail in regards to your most wisest of purchases. First off, we at the Toxi Corporation would like to sincerely thank you! And also congratulate you! You’ve won our annual November-a-thon giveaway!” he finished, taking an overdue and long breath.

That was how I found out that it wasn’t just spam. They had gotten my information when I had registered the product for the warranty, and unbeknownst to me, had thrown my name in the hat for their contest. The prizes I had to choose from included $500 cash, or free ToxiCorp earbuds for life, which included a free upgrade every time they put out a new product. While the cash offer was tempting, I decided that the latter offer would get me more bang for my buck. High end earbuds, like those made by ToxiCorp, weren’t cheap afterall. Plus, being able to upgrade and try out the latest models for free made it, in my eyes, the better of the two options.

I agreed, and after signing a plethora of documentation, not all of which I could understand and much less even read, he was on his way. Later that week they contacted me via phone about my first upgrade. It turns out, while the two pairs I had recently bought were the most expensive that my local retailer had to offer, they were by far not the most expensive and functional ones that the company offered. That first upgrade was like night and day compared to the so-called ‘top of the line’ ones I had purchased. The sound was crisper, they had better bass, a longer battery life, a further range for the bluetooth, everything about them was superior.

Then, still very much pleased with my upgraded earbuds, they contacted me about their newest pair. This pair upgraded everything, along with having noise canceling and the ability to make phone calls via a small mic inside of the earbud.

And it kept going, every month there was a new upgraded version that blew the latest one out of the water with better clarity and added functionality. My daily distractions of listening to content at work was never better. Gone were the days of bringing my phone with me from room to room as I painted, the bluetooth had crystal clear connectivity anywhere in the apartment. Hell, I could leave my phone charging in my car outside and the signal would pick up through spans of parking lots and brick walls. The snug form fitting cushion in my ear ensured that they never fell out on accident, yet wasn’t intrusive. I could go on and on, singing praise for the innovation and quality that the good people at ToxiCorp were doing with their wide line of audio products. Until that is, they hit me with their latest upgrade.

I should have known something was off when they asked me to come to their R&D department for this latest upgrade. All I was told was that this newest iteration was still in the ‘experimental’ stage of development. Previously, they had always simply mailed the newest model straight to me. I simply chalked up this break in protocol to the fact that this one was still in the prototype stage. I had already decided that whatever it was, I wanted it. I was even excited that they decided to include me in testing whatever it was that they had cooked up. Boy, was I stupid.

I arrived at their facility and was greeted by their team of engineers. They led me to a small lobby and gave me refreshments while I waited, and that was the last thing I remembered. When I woke up, I was in a recovery room with bright fluorescent lights blinding me, and a litany of rhythmically beeping medical machines monitoring my vitals. I felt groggy as hell, and as I reached up to feel why the side of my head was throbbing I felt swollen flesh molding around stitches above and behind my right ear. They said that the nausea accompanied by the dizziness I felt was normal, and conducive to the operation they performed in and around my inner ear.

I was PISSED. When my complaints and threats finally summoned the head researcher, the very same old man who had come to my door to tell me I was a ‘winner’ walked into the room.

“What the hell!? How did I get here, and what the fuck is all this about some ‘procedure’!?” I yelled. “Did you people drug me? What kind of sick operation are you people running here?”

The old man merely smiled. “Nothing that you didn’t agree to. You gave us express permission when you signed our agreement.”

“Like hell I did!” I yelled. He produced a small remote and pointed it at me, pressing a button as I continued to yell. “¡Déjame salir de aquí y llamo a mi abogado!” I threatened. What the hell? I had yelled that in english, I clearly said “Let me out of here and I’m calling my lawyer,” and I had heard the english version in my other ear, but in my right ear, the ear that was throbbing and had been operated on, I heard what I assumed was spanish.

The scientist seemed pleased at the utter confusion that sank into my facial features. “Do you speak spanish?” he asked, grinning from ear to ear. He had really said “Habla espanol?”, I heard it with my untainted ear, but I also heard the english translation clear as day with the other.

I’ll admit, even though I was still utterly pissed about the situation, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little amazed.

“What… what else can it do?” I asked, my anger subsiding slightly.

His grin grew even wider. He came closer to show me the remote. It was something akin to an old iPod looking thing. He scrolled through a plethora of menus until he selected one labeled ‘Enhance Audio’. He then pointed it in the direction of two nurses conversing behind the other side of a large glass viewing window on the other side of the room. As soon as the remote was pointing in their direction, I could hear them.

“I can’t believe that prick stood you up like that, girl!” one said.

“He’s a loser anyway, I heard from Jenny that he isn’t even all that well endowed, if you know what I mean…” the other said, holding up her pinky finger which sent both of them into a giggling fit.

“Can you hear them? How clear is the audio?” the old man asked, pulling out a clipboard and pen seemingly from nowhere.

We ran a gauntlet of tests, trying out different features and modes, dialing in and fine tuning the settings. By the time we were finished, I wasn’t even all that mad anymore. I mean, I was still a little peeved. I had been tricked and drugged and operated on without my consent, I don’t care what the gibberish in my contract said, I felt violated. BUT… after all was said and done, I couldn’t help but feel like the benefits that the new implanted device offered were more than worth some shady and underhanded practices. I was kept in their facility for a couple of days for observation and more tests, compensated for my lost wages at my job, and given a prescription to fill- something to help with the pain while my body healed. They claimed it was ‘an astounding success!’, leaving me to wonder what would have happened if they had failed?

I went about my life, checking in with them via phone once a week, which I could now call and answer by merely thinking about it, thanks to their device. I could understand hundreds of  spoken languages, I could hear conversations happening through brick walls with crystal clarity, and if it ever got too much I could always just lower the settings, even mute certain frequencies. Despite their underhanded techniques and the violation of my own body, my rage in them had subsided and became some more like a perturbed annoyance. They had drugged and operated me without my knowing consent, sure, but I was beginning to come around. Hell, I would have even said I came out like a thief, definitely better off than I had been.

Then, I began having the dreams. 

My dreams since they had installed this thing in my head have been so vivid. Dreams that seem so real, almost like I was awake, but not in control. Like watching yourself sleepwalk. I have vague memories and impressions when I wake up, remnants of whatever cycles my subconscious mind rolls through when I’m out. In one, I only remember being told by some authority figure that I needed to go out to the corner store and buy a certain brand of potato chips. My socks were wet when I woke up the next morning, and my blood chilled when I stepped outside only to notice that it had indeed rained the night before. When I checked my bank statement, there had been a purchase at 2:46 AM for the amount of $3.46 that I didn’t remember. Hell, I had been asleep at that time. So I WAS sleepwalking, along with sleep purchasing and god only knows what else.

They kept happening. Always single mindedly compelled to complete some seemingly menial or meaningless task. I tried sleeping pills, when that didn’t work I tried caffeine pills to stay awake. When I eventually did crash and pass out they continued. I even tried getting blind drunk, and while I don’t remember having any vivid dreams or sleepwalking episodes, my bank account and transaction history begged to differ. I guess I was just too blackout drunk to remember, but it hadn’t stopped me.

Last night was the most surreal one yet. I went to this bench out at the park a couple of blocks away. When I got there, I reached beneath it, obtaining the gun that I somehow knew would be there. That’s when everything became fuzzy. I try and try to remember what else happened, but it’s a blur of blue and scarlet. When I heard there had been a shooting that killed 2 people down the street from my place, I could see their faces in my mind before the police released the photos of the victims. They had been a couple, out for a late night rendezvous. A man of average looks and build and his sweetheart, who’s blue eyes burned holes into my soul through the TV screen as they glared at me accusingly. For an instant when their photos were on the screen, I remembered seeing those blue eyes looking at me, pleading and full of fear, and then… a scarlet plume of blood as the bullet mangled her beautiful face beyond recognition…

That was when the realization finally hit home for me. I did it. I killed that couple. Somehow, in a nocturnal venture in my slumber, I had murdered them. I thought I was going crazy! That’s not me, not something I would ever in the slightest consider, much less actually do. A piece of me died that day- my innocence, I think. 

I did what any decent human being in my situation would do, I resolved to turn myself in. If somehow I was becoming some crazed maniac in my sleep, the smartest thing to do would be to turn myself in, lest I somehow manage to harm more innocent people.

I went out for a good steak dinner, probably the last decent meal I’d ever get to eat before my last meal on death row someday. It was the most delicious meal I ever remember eating. I savored every little bite. Finished with my meal, I tipped several hundred dollars to my waitress- my last good deed that I knew would never make up for the harm I had caused, the lives I had taken. I took a cab to the police station, ready to own up and meet my fate. That’s when I heard it. A voice echoing minutely in my ear.

“Don’t do it,” it said. And suddenly, I found that I couldn’t. I stood there for a long time, trying to take that step up to the door, the voice repeating the command incessantly. It commanded and I obeyed. Its hooked tendrils were sunk in deep, and I was compelled to do as it said. That voice was familiar, I realized. It was the same voice that had greeted me when I opened my door that day. The same voice I heard after the surgical implant was unwillingly installed, trespassing in my brain. The same voice of the head of research and development. The friendly voice of ToxiCorp.
