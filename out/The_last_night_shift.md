Whenever I was in college I used to work at a gas station down the road from my apartment, I only worked the night shift as I wanted time for myself after 8 hours of boring courses, I was getting paid under minium wage, and everything was normal about the gas station, it was just the walk home as I worked from 22:00pm to 4:00am a 6 hour shift, the only reason I worked there was to have some extra money on top of the money my mum sent me every month. The apartment room was shared between me, my friend and his girlfriend, obviously they shared 1 of the 2 bedrooms available and I slept alone every night or slowly that would become almost never sleeping, as 1 day I heard a wierd noise coming from outside my room, now at first I didn't think much of it I just thought it was either my friend or his girlfriend but one night I was alone for the night as they went out for a late night party and I chose not to go as I was never really a party type person I prefered being by myself most of the time as I was never a out going person and would usually keep to myself, but when I heard this noise I regretted not going out because I was scared shitless now realizing that there was something else out there, so I left my bedroom to investigate the noise only to find nothing and eventually the noise stopped, I didn't sleep that entire night, the next day I told them about and they both said they hear it and thought it was me but after telling them we were all confused and a little frightened but we didn't think to much of it at the time. 

Until one night when I was walking back to the apartment I started to hear the noise outside and that really creeped me out, that noise it's almost undescrible, a low pitched scrapping almost sound but also being a high pitched scream at the exact same time I cannot really describe the noise but it was terrifying, I tried my best to ignore it but it sounded like it was getting closer everytime eventually I texted my boss that I was too scared to come to work because of this but he told me to stop making up nonsense excuses and he said to me he also wanted a to have a chat at work to me about something tomorrow. So I went to work and he told me

"About that nois-" he said as the lights went out and he dragged me into the camera room.

"Shit! stay quiet..." he whispered to me

"Wh-" I said before he cut me off to shut up.

Then he went out of the camera room and left me alone in it and after he went out he never came back I sat about one hour in that room never leaving until I got bored and got up and slowly peeped open the door and ran out the building as fast as I could and starting sprinting to the apartment completley forgeting about my boss and wether he was dead or alive, as I rush up the stairs to apartment room I could see that the door was slightly creeped open and I know very well that the door is locked everytime I leave or come back as my friend or his girlfriend never leave when I'm back from my shift, I walked up to the door slowly and I peek into the room and my eyes get filled with red, blood red, I quickly open the door to see blood splattered on the floor, up the wall, and on the ceiling I rush into my friends room to find nothing a clean room, I check my room and it's the exact same, until I realize that this wasn't my apartment, or infact a apartment but infact a old mental asyulm, the reason it was so close to my apartment block was because it was built before the apartment block and it wasn't my first time acidentally wandering into there, I left immediantly and went back to my apartment and went to my room.

I was standing right outside the door and pulled down on the handle and it was left unlocked I was actually scared this time knowing it was my apartment room I swing open the door to find a wierd looking white, skinny, long, tall, strong creature dancing around the room with my friend and his girlfriend in its sharp hands with their blood spraying around the room I left before it could see me and I rushed to the nearest police station and told them what had happened, I was sent to a therapist and I've been at a therapist for 5 years now, I've only now grown the courage to share this story online.
