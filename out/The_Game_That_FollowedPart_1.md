It started as any other late night on Discord—me, scrolling through endless pings and catching up on messages. Then, a direct message popped up. It was from Marcus, a guy I barely talked to in our group. His message was short, strange:

>

Attached was an `.exe` file with no name, just a string of random numbers. It felt like a prank or a virus waiting to happen, but curiosity—and boredom—got the better of me.

I downloaded it.

The game opened to a blank screen. No menu, no title, no options—just darkness and the sound of faint breathing. A text faded in:

The scene loaded slowly, pixelated shapes forming what looked like a decrepit village surrounded by dense woods. It was a first-person perspective, the kind you’d expect from a poorly made indie horror game. My character held a dull knife in one hand and a lantern in the other, its light flickering like it could die any second.

There were no instructions, no objectives. Just the sound of my character's footsteps crunching on gravel.

And then, the whispers began.

Low, guttural murmurs in a language I didn’t understand. I thought it was ambient noise, but they got louder whenever I turned around. My heart raced—this wasn’t like any cheap horror game I’d played before. The atmosphere felt... personal.

I walked into a house, the door creaking loudly. Inside, the air felt suffocating. There were photos on the walls—blurry at first, but as I moved closer, I froze.

They were photos of me.

Pictures from my room, my walks, even from earlier that night at my desk.

I tried to quit the game, but the screen froze. Then, my Discord pinged. I alt-tabbed, and it was Marcus again.

I tried to reply, but my keyboard didn’t work. The game forced itself back into focus, and the screen flashed a new message:

>

The sound of something heavy dragging across the ground filled my headphones. I turned my character around and saw it—a grotesque figure, stitched together from human parts, crawling toward me. Its face... It wasn’t human. It looked like a warped version of Marcus.

I ran. Through the village, into the woods, all the while hearing that thing’s guttural laughter chasing me. The game’s breathing matched mine, in sync with every gasp I let out in real life.

And then, I died.

The screen went black.

Discord pinged again.

That’s when my screen flashed. For a split second, I saw *myself* sitting at my desk—on the game screen.

But it wasn’t my reflection.

It was me. And someone was standing behind me.

I whipped around, but no one was there. Just the dark, empty room.

I closed Discord and powered off my PC. My heart was pounding, and I couldn’t shake the feeling I was being watched.

The next day, I woke up to find Marcus had left our server. His account was deleted. No one else in the group had heard from him, and his phone went straight to voicemail.

But the worst part?

When I logged back into Discord that night, there was a new server in my list, one I didn’t remember joining.

Its name?

Inside was just me, and a single user:

The chat blinked.
