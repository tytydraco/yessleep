In what I would find out later was the passing of years, 5 to be exact, I would be a full-time resident of this [room](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/14g2bpp/this_is_how_i_was_born_and_i_was_made_to_kill_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1). The room would stay empty and quiet and still, the only activity being when one or two of the giants would come to feed, bathe, and observe me for a moment as I ate and bathed. Meal visits were done 5 times a day and baths were every other day.

Food was something else that was a strange concept to me for so long now was food, meals and so-called "gourmet feasts". I've heard so many times about how certain foods are regarded as "The most delicious thing on the planet" or "gifts from God" and whatnot. For me, "feasts" were mere small bowls of this liquid like grain or mush that I could remember feeling really thick and hard to swallow. The stuff was gray and lifeless in color, much like the room and just like every other room I'd ever seen up to that point.

It had no taste, either, which is of course why taste was something I never understood before either. Of all the things it couldn't do, though, I will give it as much credit to say that it does do well to fill your stomach after only one bowl. One small bowlful, not any bigger than the palm of your hand, and you wouldn't want to eat again for at least another 2 to three hours, depending of course on the amount of exercise and whatnot.

For me, though comparatively little in regards to normal exercise practices, I was able to occupy myself by trying to move on my own. At first, it was simply to move myself toward the light at the foot of my bed. I remember wanting so bad to be able to reach out for the light, be able to dance in it with all the "little mes". I started by training myself to stay upright and begin crawling for it. This, in itself, took a while to master as my muscles had not developed before then.

When I did master this and I was able to actually make it to the edge of the bed, the next step was to build the muscles in my legs to stand and walk the rest of the way toward the light. This, of course, took the longest to get the hang of, not at all helped by the heavy nodes, all bearing down on top of me or the giants who, with every visit to my room, would always find me either in the floor or trying to inch myself off of the bed and into the floor, and they'd always put me back to the top of the bed where I started. I would kick and scream, wanting so desperately for them to leave me alone, but it all fell on deaf ears.

Each night I failed to start walking was ended with me crying myself to sleep, which must've angered either the giants or the God being, because there were many times I remember having an electric buzz pass through the nodes, which would both silence and somewhat comatose me. I want to say that I was about a year and half or perhaps beginning my second year of life that I finally started walking around on my own. Once more, I learned that making noise, trying to cry out, would earn me an unforgiving jolt of electricity to pass through my body. Still though, no matter how much my efforts were hindered by anyone or thing, I was determined to get to the light.To get to freedom.

It was one day, after about an hour following my last meal visit, the third for that day, I believe, that I made it off the bed like I had just about every time before, and when I slowly released my grip from the bed, I was able to stand. My legs shook for a moment, but they didn't fold. Without wasting another second, I started hobbling for the light. I'd made it this far, and I wasn't about to fall now.That first step hit the floor hard, resulting in an echoing THUD while I swung my other foot out. When I did, though, I found something else about myself and the other children. We're invertebrates, which I learned later meant I essentially had no spine. Because of this, as soon as my other leg caused my momentum to shift forward, I ended up folding myself in half horizontally like I was made of paper. Even this, however, didn't hinder my progress forward and I continued sort of slump-staggering toward the light.

The "little mes" grew larger and larger with each step forward. I could see their smiles widen as I drew nearer and nearer. Their arms stretched wider and wider, reaching out for me, ready to welcome me in their play. With a push from my left leg behind me, I thrust myself forward like a missile right into the... into the...

Into the wall.

Aside from pain and shock, I remember my first thoughts following this to be of confusion. I was still in my room. I wasn't in a vibrant red glow and there were no "little mes" dancing around. There was no dancing or happy faces greeting me. Instead, all there was was the small depression in the wall where my head struck. The light itself wasn't even shining anymore, as in my desperate escape attempt, I'd crashed headfirst into the actual light itself, crushing it to the point that it looked similar to the crushed soda cans I've seen occasionally littering the ground outside.

For a moment, I just sat and stared, my brain not yet having registered the full extent of what had just happened. Then it sank in that I hadn't reached the freedom I'd so desperately strove for and I became inconsolable. My screams echoed not only throughout the confines of my room, but the halls outside as well. I could feel spasms in my arms and legs, jolts of adrenaline, trying to force them to take action, to take up whatever I could take hold of and sling it across the room. When my screams became loud enough, I could feel the electricity shooting through my body from the nodes, but it made absolutely no difference.

My dreams of attaining happiness had just been smashed along with the light. The grief I felt was, in every way, unmatched. Hope was gone for me. I had one chance, one singular hope to be free, to be happy, and it was all a lie. Ironically, this lie would set itself as the standard of life for me. Freedom is only an illusion, and happiness in it is only a lie.

My temper flared so much that I even felt the nodes bending, crumpling like tin cans. What force was being exerted upon them that was causing them to do this, either by me or anything else, I didn't know, nor could I have cared if I'd actually tried. Finally, one of the nodes managed to crush completely and pop right off of my head. Two or three others followed in close succession. The electrical pulsing within the nodes spiked, but all this did was fuel my tantrum all the more.

Nothing was stopping me from letting out every minute ounce of pent up grief, anger, confusion, and unfiltered misery I felt, trapped in that room, alone, with absolutely no comprehension of who or what I, or anybody or anything even was. It wasn't long, either, before I noticed the room beginning to shake again. This time, it all felt natural to me.

I felt like this was what was supposed to be happening, if that makes any sense. I realized that the only way I could feel powerful, the only way I could "Feel free" in a sense was to exert this tremendous force upon my surroundings and whoever was unfortunate enough at the time to be a part of it. At one point, the shaking got so violent that the lamp hanging over my bed was thrown across the room. Not only that, but the smashed remains of the light were also lifted into the air where each individual shattered remnant was then hurled with speed to various points of the room like they were bullets.

More of this began to happen when the walls began shaking, with small chunks being shaken off of them as though they were shedding an old layer of skin. Those chunks would then be lifted and tossed around the room, lodging themselves into parts of the room. Eventually, it'd be my bed that would be lifted into the air. This wasn't easy to do, however, as even in my manic state at the time, because of just how big and heavy the bed itself was, it was a huge strain on my body, physically, to lift it that I might as well have been trying to lift it by hand. Strain or not, though, I managed to make it happen and when I did, I caused it to crash straight through the door to the room itself.

It punched straight through the door, taking it and most of the wall with it, and sending it flying a little over halfway down the corridor leading to my room. That was when my tantrum finally ceased altogether. In front of me now was an opening. A way out. a path to freedom.

You might think that after what'd occurred only a moment ago, that I'd be a tad hesitant to try making another move like this, but you'd be mistaken. Though it was small, a ray of hope found itself reignited within me and I took off once more, clumsily slinking my way through, out of the room and into the dark, abysmal hallway. The hallway itself felt cramped, somehow even more so than the room I was living in, and as dark as it was, a palatable air of tension hung so thick in the air that breathing actually became somewhat difficult for me.

There was no stopping me, though. In spite of the difficulty breathing, in spite of the fact that I couldn't see where I was going or what laid ahead, in spite of the fact that I didn't even fully understand why I so desperately needed to escape, and in spite of the fact that I'd already established the difficulty I had in mobility, I kept going. I was going to make it out of there; out of that room and into... well, into who knew where.

I was just about to the point where the door landed when I heard alarms sounding off all throughout the hallway around me. In the seconds following this, what was once a dark cavernous corridor was instantly bathed in a startlingly abrupt and blinding crimson light. I froze in place while my heart did its damnedest to punch straight through my chest. Amidst the chaos, I could hear the heavy tramping of boots making a beeline for the hallway. This was it, I knew it.My escape was once again going to be ruined. I was going to be caught and taken back to my room, probably being fitted with bigger, heavier, and more painful nodes. I couldn't take this, I couldn't let them have me, not now, not when I was SO CLOSE!

I closed my eyes. My head was already vibrating from pressure, almost full to bursting. My mouth dropped open and from the pit of my stomach, I released a powerful howl that caused the walls around me to begin crumbling. I don't just mean chipping away like the walls of my room either, no, I mean actually breaking down, coming apart at the very foundation of the building itself. Boulder sized chunks I saw raining down from the ceiling.

From ahead, I watched a doorway swing wide open and in stepped four giants, all of them shouting "There he is, Get him!"

They charged for me and I howled again. The hallway shook again, causing meteors of debris to rain down on top of them. One chunk was exceptionally large and ended up flattening one of the party. The others, though slowed down by the chaos, continued ambling toward me. I tried howling again, but it seemed that I'd exerted too much of whatever force it was enabling me to cause all of this because all I was able to produce was a hoarse gasping noise.

They soon caught up to me and snatched me off of the floor. Like with my howling, my attempts at trying to fight my way out of their restraint was pitiful at best. I remember hearing one of them bark to the other, "Get Abba down here! He needs to see this!"

The giant held me with his arms outstretched away from him, like if I was any closer to him, he'd risk catching some sort of disease or something to that effect. I was a worm, wiggling, writhing and squirming in his arms, fighting tooth and claw to in a feeble attempt to free myself before they could do whatever it was I feared they planned to do with me. I finally ceased, though, when I heard the by now distinct sound of the God being's feet hammering against the floor of the hallway.

That, I think, was the first time I'd actually looked upon the God being's face. Up to that point, I'd only ever seen his stocky outline, being completely clothed in shadow, but here, despite how dark it was in  the hallway, his face, all of it, save for the small section of the left hand part of his face which which was still covered, was revealed to me. I'll admit, too, that he didn't look anything like I was expecting-- not that I actually knew what the hell I was supposed to expect, either. I can remember how before, I would imagine the God being being something elevated, something elemental, immaterial. I had imagined him being something of a force, beyond the laws of nature.Yet, he stood before me now, grinning, looking just like all of the other giants standing around me.

He was a flesh and blood creature, same as the others and, at least in this way, the same as myself and the children. "Well now, ain't you just the little troublemaker?" he said in a voice that I will swear to this day, had a demented, gleeful chuckle laced with it. "What're you doin' out of your room, huh little guy?"

My mouth hung open but I couldn't say anything. Staring into the God being's eyes was maddening. My eyes were stuck to his and his were piercing mine, penetrating them and driving straight down into my mind and soul. He was reading me, inside and out, and there wasn't a single thing I could do to make him stop. It slowly got even stranger though when the screams, which for at least a year and a half had been largely subdued, if not silent altogether, suddenly blasted from the forefront of my mind.

Somehow, I knew deep down that, whatever was causing this sudden flare-up, wasn't coming from me. I couldn't yet tell who or what, but I knew it wasn't my doing. This only lasted about a minute (even if, for the longest time, I believed that it lasted for an eternity, like I had with everything else) before they once more went silent and, with his toothy grin now stretched almost unnaturally across his face, the God being turned around and began walking away down the hallway. No sooner than I watched the darkness of the hallway engulf him once more, my eyelids dropped quicker than if I had attached lead weights to them.

I was gone then. By all accounts, I believed I was dead. Well, maybe...

You'll probably understand by this point that yes, Death wasn't something I had any knowledge of. The word alone was as foreign to me as freedom was when I found that I couldn't dance in the light. Obviously, I'd seen death before, namely with the two giants and the child from the room before, but I didn't know THAT was what it was. I guess the simplest way to put it was that I thought what'd happened to them was something that was supposed to happen; a routine sort of thing like consuming food and water.

When I woke up again, that would be the day in which this all changed. I awoke first in my room, now with the dim lamp above my head being the only light and a slab of wood nailed to the frame of the entry replacing the door. I had thought the room was cramped and oppressive before, but this was something else, something more, something worse. Now, not only was it cramped, not only was it quiet, but it was hopeless.

I could actually feel it, too, the sheer cloud of emptiness that hung over the room. It was poisonous, the feeling, worming its way into my head and down throughout my body until, eventually, I started feeling hollow as well. My head was a blank canvas then, void of either thought or emotion. I wanted nothing, for I felt nothing.

Understanding life for me was simple now: I am alone. Surrounded, but alone, nonetheless. Freedom, individuality, happiness, and/or fellowship were all lies to me, not that any of them had any real meaning to me to begin with back then.

At some point, another loud, screeching alarm echoed throughout the room, which was followed then by two giants barging into my room and seizing me from my bed. I didn't try to struggle, but regardless, they opted to implement the use of some sort of prosthetic attachment to lift me up instead of their hands. This device was a small crane-like machine that appeared to be attached to the giant's waist, with the crane itself reaching up and over the wearer's back like the tail of a scorpion.

Its grip around my tiny waist was cold, calloused, and all around unforgiving. The tiny metal teeth in its pincers dug into my skin from the instant it took hold of me, to the moment it finally let me go, back into the dome shaped room with the pit. This time, the room was far better lit, with there now being torches mounted across just about every square inch of the actual room across the ceiling.

The pit was a great big wooden circle with the aforementioned red star painted in the center of it, taking up about 1/3 of the total space all around on the inside. I was seated at the lower right point of the star, with four other children seated around the other points respectively. They all twisted their little heads to look all about the room with bug eyes. I'd have probably done the same, too, if it weren't for the fact that my shadow-- and this time it was mine-- was standing just behind the child at the northernmost facing point of the star.

It raised its hand again to point around the ceiling. I looked up, but couldn't see anything save for the torches. I'll admit, by this point, this little game of charades was starting to make me nervous. What was it pointing to?

Before I had a chance to try examining it further, though, another alarm blared, startling the five of us children. Our attention was focused at the front of the room, behind where I was sitting by the voice of  the God being. His booming voice shook through each of the five of us as he said, "Welcome, little ones. Today is a big day for you all. Today, we will begin the first step in fulfilling your destiny."

About two or three deep red colored lights blinked to life around the circle. The children's eyes all doubled in size at this. I continued looking forward, trying to see just where the God being's voice was coming from. My shadow, which had not disappeared like the last few times, stood in front of the wall just a few yards away from me, pointing upward. I was tempted not to look up this time, having already begun letting frustration with this build, but I could see from his, now widened, almost bulging white slitted eyes, that this time was serious. Something up there was necessary for me to see.

My eyes went upward and this time, I found what it was he was pointing to. About five or six feet above the floor level, there was what appeared to be a window with a black shape sitting, looking out through it. His voice boomed again:"I want to say to you all just how proud of you I am. You've all grown so much, and your skills have developed nicely. I cannot wait to see just how much. Now, to begin, we will have two of you stand where you are currently seated."

For almost fifteen seconds, nothing happened. None of us moved and no other lights clicked on. I almost thought for a second that he was referring to someone or something else, until suddenly, two giants walked into the room, stomped over to the pit, and jerked two of the other children off the ground and to their feet.

"Excellent. Now, the rest of you may remain seated while your brothers display a taste of their skills."The two standing children, both of which were shaking, looking around the room, at the rest of us, and at each other will swelled eyes. One of them, I saw, tried to squirm to sit back down, but the giant's hold on his arms was suffocating. His mouth opened, and I'm sure he wanted to scream or cry, but I also think he, like me, realized at that point that doing any such thing would only result in further torment.

"I want you two to use any and all abilities at your disposal to duel one another. The match will end when only one of you is left standing. Aaand..." Silence settled in the room for only a second before he said "Begin!" followed by the banging of a gong. The two faced each other, but wouldn't move.My own heart began racing, anticipating for what would happen next. Of course, just what was the biggest mystery to me, and from the way the two were looking at each other, the same was just as true for them-- if not far more so. I tried moving, perhaps to move a bit closer to the "action", only to find I couldn't. My rear was fused somehow with the ground beneath me.

I looked at the two others around me, seeing that they hadn't moved either. One of the two in the middle dared to try and move out of the circle, only to find that an invisible wall of some sort was impeding either of them from escaping. The other child, seeing this, must've realized something, too, because he fell onto the floor and curled into a fetal position.

"Come, come, there's no need to be afraid. This is what you were born for, all of you." One of the giants came into the pit and stuck the tip of this long stick or spear into the circle, poking the one that tried to leave in the stomach. Immediately after it touched him, the child jumped back, shrieking. The shriek shook through the room, not quite as violently as if he were wailing, but still enough for it to be felt by myself and the others.

This seemed to trigger something in the other one as well because I watched him uncurl himself and rise to his feet again, glaring coldly at his brother. This one then unleashed an earth-shaking howl of his own. His caused not only the dome room itself to shake, but it caused the pit to almost uproot from the ground completely, causing the other one to fall.

"There we are." exclaimed the voice of the God being. "Now this should be interesting."The first one stomped his foot, which resulted in the pit actually uprooting from the ground at the right hand corner, lifting it up and tossing his brother through the air. It looked like he would've been launched straight into the wall behind the rest of us, but as soon as his body reached the border of their little arena, his body was ricocheted off the invisible barrier and sent crashing right back down onto the floor.

Without so much as another second being wasted, as soon as his body impacted on the ground, the other child, the menacer, released another deafening screech, blasting him back against the barrier again. The victim slid down and when he reached the ground, his head and neck went limp. About ten to twenty seconds went by with nothing happening. Me and the other children, I remember, leaned in close, waiting to see the other one get back up, perhaps retaliate, but no. His body was motionless."Excellent show there." the God being's voice boomed. "Yes, you've done well. Linman, Corvitz, retrieve the fallen one. His death has shown us much, as will that of the others."

The giants began approaching the pit. When they came to the edge of it, the child's limp body fell back, all four of his stubs sprawling out across the ground. One of them took up his body by his leg and carried him away. Like earlier, when they held him, they did so in a way that made sure his lifeless body was as far away from him as possible.

The other two children began cooing, likely curious as to what just happened. I was once again an exception to this. They didn't understand, nor should they have, but somehow... Somehow I did.Connections, I think, between what'd happened earlier with the two giants and this, were drawn in my head. They'd spoken, I could remember, of death. I couldn't have defined it at the time, but now...

Now I knew.

With this came a sense of numbness. A resetting of my brain, if you will. It had become clear to me now that I very well could end up just like the child that was dragged out gracelessly. I would be dead and then... and then...

Well... I didn't know after that. Honestly, I still don't, though I'm not sure anyone really does. I've heard about the existences of afterlifes; Heaven and Hell, Purgatory and Paradise, Aasgard and Helheim, all of them. But none of them, I don't think, are indicative at all of reality. Again, despite everything I'd seen in life-- and, in a way, beyond-- I still can't really tell you what is true as far as that goes.I was the only one that seemed to realize this, though, and so I was the only one who remained quiet while the other giant came and collected the four of us and sat us all into the cart we were in before. The God being's voice blasted one last time, saying, "Go and rest, Little ones. Tomorrow, we will begin the next match."

We were then rolled out of the domed room and into the darkened hallway again. From there, we were each escorted to our rooms respectively. I sat alone then, in my room, pondering in the dark about what was to come the next morning. So many different thoughts went through my head, I remember, that I can't even really begin to list them here. Suffice to say, above all else, I was scared. I think, too, that was the first time I'd ever experienced the sensation of true fear. The way my heart constantly hammered against my small, fragile chest, the way in which I couldn't lay down because I felt that, if I did, I may not rise again.

This I hated most of all, the feeling d come to know as vulnerability. The fact that I knew what it was; death, and the fact that I knew that it would happen to me, one way or another, and at the same time couldn't help myself but to do everything I could to resist it. Perhaps it's better do say that I hated the awareness I had of this, of the fact that I couldn't do anything about it even if I tried.

None of the other children seemed to know of or understand this. They had no clue what death was or the natural fear of it. Being frank, I'd almost be willing to bet that the two children dueling didn't know either until it happened, where then only I would see this all for what it truly was: murder. But then, why am I the one that has to see this?

*"... We expect great things from you."*

The God being's voice was a scathing tease echoing through my mind. What "great things" were apparently expected of me? What's "great" about murder? Why was I special?

Why do I have to be the only one that can [see](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/14ikywu/this_was_how_i_was_born_and_i_was_made_to_kill_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)?
