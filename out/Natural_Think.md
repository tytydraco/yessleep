*Imagine if the water you drank could change your life?

&#x200B;

*Imagine if the water you drank helped you sleep better, lose weight and change your life for the better?*

&#x200B;

*Imagine if you didn’t have to ingest lead, bacteria, chlorine and fluoride with every glass?*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It really did sound too good to be true… Maybe if someone else had said it to me, I wouldn’t have believed it. But this was from Annie. She and I had been friends since we were kids and I couldn’t remember a time when I hadn’t had her in my life. I trusted her more than I’d trust some members of my own family. Granted, Annie and I hadn’t spoken in about a year or so when she messaged me out of the blue. There wasn’t any bad blood between us or anything. Last time we met up, things had gone great. We’d gone out for dinner, chatted about our lives, and caught up, then happily went our separate ways again, promising to keep in touch.

&#x200B;

Then we simply just… Hadn’t. Or more accurately, I hadn’t. She’d messaged me a few times but I’d never been all that talkative. No real rhyme or reason for it. I figured she didn’t take any offense. I’ve never been the most social of people and Annie knew that. Besides, life is just difficult sometimes. Things get in the way. You lose track of people. That’s just how it is. Once you hit your late twenties, it gets harder to keep your friends around. You sink deeper and deeper into your own little isolated bubble. You get stuck on the hamster wheel of ‘*Wake up, go to work, go home, eat dinner, sleep*.’ and making time for anything else becomes a chore.  I suppose the pandemic hasn’t helped much either. It was easier being social when I could dip out with friends after work, or hell just go and catch a movie by myself and zone out for a few hours, away from the stresses of my life. I could break up the monotony a little more that way. It shakes me up a little bit to think about what my life was like back in 2019 when I could at least take my time commuting home, visit restaurants I’ve never been to before, go out of my way to grab dinner with a friend and stuff like that. Then, in 2020 and 2021, everything just went by in a blur and the only evidence I have that time passed is the simple fact that I’m older and more miserable than ever before…

&#x200B;

I’m rambling. I know. I guess… Just looking back at Annie’s message, it’s so obvious that I knew better than this. She probably knew better than this! But, I suppose that even complete horseshit can sound good when it’s from the mouth of someone you trust and you’re in a crappy headspace during a crappy point in your life.

&#x200B;

I’d been pretty low for the better part of the past several months when she reached out to me. So, I was honestly just happy to hear from a friend. We’d been chatting for a few days and catching up before she dropped the Natural Think bombshell on me. Looking at it, part of me knew that it was a canned sales pitch. She’d probably just copy and pasted it from whoever had gotten her into this. I should have known better… But, like I’ve said before, it was Annie and I trusted her. Honestly she probably could’ve asked me if I wanted to meet her for a bleach drinking competition and I just might’ve just said yes to it. Plus, I’d be lying if I said the empty promises of better health weren’t nice to hear. Some people are just born healthy… I wasn’t one of them. I’ve spent my fair share of time in and out of the hospital and it’s never exactly been fun. Anything that promises me a shot at better health might just be worth it. So I figured, what did I have to lose aside from money, right? In the end, I don’t suppose there’s any amount of trying to explain this away that can justify it. I turned off my common sense and let myself get sucked in by wishful thinking and empty promises.

&#x200B;

My Natural Think filter arrived in the mail about a week after I signed up. I’ll admit, I wasn’t entirely sure what I was expecting. Annie had made it very clear that this wasn’t a water ionizer or anything like that. She called it a *‘Wasserverstärker’* or something. Don’t ask me how to pronounce that or what (if anything) it means.

The product itself looked more like one of those filters you put on your tap to improve the water quality, although a little bulkier and metallic. The box it came in unfortunately only had instructions in what looked like German but I managed to set it up just fine using the pictures provided.When I first turned it on, it took a few seconds for the water to come out and it tasted… Off. Not the way the water from my tap usually tastes. It had a slight ozone taste to it, and made my tongue feel a little odd. It almost felt as if it numbed my mouth a little bit, like it was cold but not in a normal way, kinda like touching a gel cooled pillow. It’s hard to accurately describe. It didn’t bother me that much. There are brands of bottled water that I can’t even drink due to the chemical taste you get from them and the unusual taste of the water from the Natural Think filter wasn’t anywhere close to that. But it was still different.

&#x200B;

Not good or bad. Just… Different. But different was supposed to be good, right? If this filter did half of what Annie claimed it did and really was enhancing the water, of course it would taste a little bit different, right? I don’t know. Maybe I was just trying to justify the fact that I’d spent five hundred dollars on a *‘Medical Grade Water Filter.’* Annie had insisted that I’d love this thing so much that I’d jump at the opportunity to get in on the ground floor and start my own business with the company, and I guess I wanted to believe her. I wanted her to be right.

&#x200B;

Looking back at it, I still can’t say with complete certainty if she was or not. My life didn’t exactly change overnight but after a few days, I did start to see a difference.

&#x200B;

I’ve always had trouble sleeping, ever since I was a kid. My brain doesn’t really shut off at night. Some nights, I just can’t wind down until I feel like I’ve met some arbitrary goal or alternatively, I just don’t want to have to wake up and deal with the anxieties of tomorrow.

&#x200B;

A couple of days after installing the Natural Think filter though, I woke up from the best sleep I’d had in years, feeling refreshed for a change. I didn’t even think about the filter. I just got up, got ready, had breakfast and went into my home office to start the day. Considering how my usual routine is to get up ten minutes before I’m due to start work, curse God and drag myself (sometimes still wrapped in a blanket) into my kitchen for a coffee before starting the day; This was an improvement.

&#x200B;

Maybe it was having a good night's sleep for a change, but my anxiety started to feel a little more manageable too. By which I mean, my mind didn’t overclock itself to the point of stress the same way it had a few days prior over every little email.

&#x200B;

All of my problems didn’t just vanish. The anxiety was still there. I still felt tired in the morning but… Well. They weren’t as bad and I just genuinely felt a little bit better. Not a lot better. But better all the same.

&#x200B;

By that weekend, I started to wonder if maybe the water filter actually did work after all. That Saturday, I went out for a short walk in the park. It was actually kinda nice! My body didn’t feel so sore, I didn’t sleep until noon. I just felt… Well. Good. Which is a huge change for me!

&#x200B;

On Sunday, I was bored so I just… texted my friend Amber and asked if she wanted to hang out. We ordered takeout and just hung out on the couch all night, watching some movies and chatting. I’m usually not the social type, but I felt a little more energized. It was incredible!

&#x200B;

When Monday rolled around, I felt kinda energized. I’d slept okay. I didn’t feel like I’d let the weekend slip through my fingers. Sure, I could still feel a little bit of that lingering anxiety gnawing at the back of my mind but it was just easier to dismiss it and focus on the things I needed to focus on. Looking back on that week, I think I was more productive than I’ve been since the pandemic started since I didn’t feel this heavy weight on my shoulders all day! It was… It was liberating!

&#x200B;

And… That’s when I first saw one.

&#x200B;

I don’t know what it was. I don’t know what to call it. But it was there, in my house. Sometime around 1 in the afternoon, I’d shut off my monitors to go for lunch when I saw it reflected in one of my screens. Something vaguely shaped like a man, standing in the doorway to my office. I turned around, thinking that someone was there but I just saw the open door and the empty hallway. Nothing else.

&#x200B;

I remember that I just sort of stared at it for a moment, before shaking my head and dismissing it.

*‘Get it together, Jordan…’*

&#x200B;

I brushed it off just as quickly as I’d seen it. Sometimes, your mind just plays tricks on you. You see things that aren’t there out of the corner of your eye, perfectly normal, right? I got up, went to the kitchen and heated up some leftovers from last night. And if I thought I saw movement out of the corner of my eye at any point… I never did anything about it. I didn’t look over. It was just my mind playing tricks on me.

&#x200B;

That had to be it…

&#x200B;

Only that wasn’t it…

&#x200B;

I was getting ready for bed when I saw another one. I was just in the shower, freshening up before bed when I noticed something standing on the other side of the curtain. It was tall, dark and vaguely shaped like a man. But through the curtain I couldn’t make out any clear details of it. All I could see was that there was a person standing in my bathroom. A person whose head moved ever so slightly to look in my direction and then…

&#x200B;

Nothing.

&#x200B;

I blinked. My hands were shaking. There was no other sound save for the hiss of the shower and the gurgle of water circling the drain. Reluctantly, I pulled back the curtain and stuck my head out… Still nothing. No sign that anyone was in the bathroom but me.

&#x200B;

I knew what I’d seen, though… The flickering movements out of the corner of my eye had been easy to brush off, as had the figure reflected in my screen but this… I couldn’t brush this off. Not by a long shot.

&#x200B;

I didn’t know what was going on. But I’d never been so afraid while inside my own home.

&#x200B;

I didn’t sleep much that night… I stayed up late, scouring the internet for answers. I came upon tales of shadow people, or ghosts that sort of matched what I thought I might’ve seen but… Well, none of them really managed to explain why they were showing up or what to do with them and it was hard sorting out what was a true account and what was complete bullshit that someone had made up for attention. Maybe it was all bullshit? Maybe it wasn’t… Maybe, maybe, maybe… Too many maybe’s. Not enough answers…

&#x200B;

When I got the ping on my laptop from someone messaging me, I was so on edge that I almost jumped out of my skin. I was a little relieved to see that it was just Annie though.

&#x200B;

**Annie:** *Burning the midnight oil, hun?*

&#x200B;

I guessed she couldn’t sleep either. After letting some of the tension drain from my shoulders, I typed out a response.

&#x200B;

**Jordan:** *Yup. Can’t sleep. You?*

&#x200B;

**Annie:** *Was out late. Not tired yet. Everything alright?*

&#x200B;

**Jordan:** *Haha, yeah. Just jumping at shadows. Maybe I should adopt a cat or something, lol.*

&#x200B;

**Annie:** *Ooh, you’ve seeing them?*

&#x200B;

**Jordan:** *Cats?*

&#x200B;

**Annie:** *Shadows.*

&#x200B;

I felt my heart suddenly jolt inside my chest… Shadows. What was she talking about? Before I could type a reply, I noticed that she was already typing. I just waited to see what she might say. I can’t exactly say that it made sense.

&#x200B;

**Annie:** *You’ll see them after a while. Don’t worry. This is natural. Part of the process of ‘waking up’ is seeing what everyone else misses. You don’t need to worry about them! They won’t hurt you!*

&#x200B;

*‘This is insane…’* I remember thinking to myself and yet… I still felt the sensation of invisible eyes on me. Like someone else that I couldn’t see was inside the room. I tried to think up a response to type. For a moment, I started to wonder if Annie was playing some sort of prank on me. I watched the screen, waiting for her to tell me that this was all a messed up joke but…

&#x200B;

No…

&#x200B;

Nothing…

&#x200B;

**Annie:** *So, how are you liking the filter? Sleeping better? Didn’t I tell you!*

&#x200B;

She just kept talking… As if she hadn’t just told me that seeing fucking shadow people was a normal and natural side effect of drinking filtered water! I didn’t know what to say…

&#x200B;

I left her on read and then I closed my laptop. I wondered if any of this would make sense in the morning. It didn’t.

&#x200B;

I saw another figure the next morning when I opened my eyes. Just for a moment. It was there, standing at the end of my bed, close to the window. I don’t think it was even looking at me. It almost seemed to be looking outside. It was gone as I blinked the sleep from my eyes.

&#x200B;

I read over my conversation with Annie again over breakfast, trying to digest what she’d told me. I could’ve sworn I still caught glimpses of movement out of the corner of my eye every now and then but they were gone when I tried to look directly at them. I even thought for a moment I saw the shadow of a man behind me, reflected in my TV…

&#x200B;

It was crazy… It had to be crazy but…

&#x200B;

What other explanation was there for the things I was seeing? Maybe it was the water? Maybe…

&#x200B;

As the next few days crept by, I noticed more and more glimpses of figures out of the corner of my eye. They never stayed for long. Just long enough for me to notice them, then they were gone again. When you see the reflection of a man behind you, and see shapes in the darkness around your bed enough times, you begin to accept that it might not just be your imagination playing tricks on you. Maybe there’s something else there.

&#x200B;

For what it’s worth, the shadowy figures I saw never really seemed to *do* anything. They just sort of *were*. Silent, faceless specters standing idle in the background.

&#x200B;

The internet offered me little information on what they were and when I finally decided to ask Annie about them again, she didn’t offer me much beyond what she’d already said.

&#x200B;

*“Part of the process of ‘waking up’ is seeing what everyone else misses. You don’t need to worry about them! They won’t hurt you!”*

&#x200B;

Was it normal?

&#x200B;

I ended up googling Natural Think and all I turned up was a fairly generic website that I’d already visited. It didn’t mention anything about what I’d been seeing. In fact, none of the sources I mentioned said a thing about shadow people. I guess it wasn’t considered a primary selling point. Maybe it should’ve been a red flag that I just… accepted this, as well as I did. In hindsight, I’m really not sure what else I could’ve done. Begging other people to see them probably would’ve just made it seem like I’d gone crazy, cooped up in my apartment and they weren’t exactly causing any trouble… I was also sleeping a hell of a lot better than ever and my anxiety was barely even an afterthought. I was doing great and the only thing I’d done differently was start using the Natural Think water filter. Maybe this was normal… Maybe this was okay…

&#x200B;

It had to be, right?

&#x200B;

A little over two weeks after I started with Natural Think, I told Annie that I wanted in. Shadow people aside, I genuinely did feel better and yes I realize how much of a red flag that sentence probably is.

&#x200B;

I paid the membership fee and signed up for the online sales training. I started going through it after my regular work hours. I figured I’d give it a shot, see if I could make it work. Maybe I’d make some money off this little side hustle. Stranger things have happened, right?

&#x200B;

The more I thought about it, the more it started to seem like a good idea… Although I suppose there were a few little oddities I noticed, that I probably should’ve paid a lot more attention to.

&#x200B;

My days were already flying by. I kept busy so zoning out during my work days was nothing new. Granted, I’ve never looked back at my To Do list and noticed I didn’t remember completing half of it. But I figured it was better not to look a gift horse in the mouth. The work was done, everything looked to be in order. No cause for alarm, right? The biggest indicator that something was off came when I finally messaged Annie about joining up with Natural Think… Or… When I finally opened up the chat to message Annie about joining up.

&#x200B;

I didn’t recognize the most recent messages between us. I scrolled up, reading through them and thought maybe I had a vague recollection of them… But I honestly wasn’t sure. The conversation was about three hours old, and I’d asked her about joining up with Natural Think… I just… I didn’t fully remember doing it. Wouldn’t I remember something like that?

&#x200B;

Maybe I wouldn’t?

&#x200B;

It was… Surreal. I’ve never lost time before… Ever. I’ve zoned out, sure. But I’d never been doing something one moment, only to look up and realize that several hours had passed and I couldn’t remember a single thing I’d done in them! This should’ve bothered me more than it did… But I remember just shrugging it all off as if it was no big deal. In my mind, it wasn’t a big deal at the time. I’d simply just ‘forgotten.’ People forget all the time, right? The mind can’t be expected to remember every trivial little detail about the day. I was busy and I felt *fine*. I felt great and if I didn’t remember a couple of hours while I was busy, well… So what.

&#x200B;

I was fine. Everything was fine… Everything was fine…Then it wasn’t.

&#x200B;

It was maybe a month or two after I’d signed on with Natural Think? It’s hard to say. Time was… Weird. It all starts to blur together. I’d made a couple of sales, mostly to some friends who noted I looked a bit healthier and seemed more lively. I swore up and down that this was the real deal. Or… The chat logs indicate that I did. I don’t actually remember some of those conversations but I have the logs.

&#x200B;

Amber had asked me if I wanted to grab dinner with her and a couple other mutual friends of ours after work. She’d asked me before but I usually said no. I usually had so little energy at the end of the day that I couldn’t make myself leave the house. But I remember that I felt great. Good enough to go out, at least.

&#x200B;

I met them down at a little pizza place downtown. It’s a bit more on the upscale side, but they’ve got the best pizza I’ve ever had. I hadn’t actually been there in a couple of years, so it was nice to see them open again. Aside from my one dinner with Amber, I hadn’t really gone out and seen anyone in a couple of months. My friends were at a table near the back. I could see the reflections of shadows in the window behind them, scattered about the restaurant. They lingered when I stared although when I tried to focus on them, they seemed to fade away ever so slightly.

&#x200B;

We shot the shit for a bit, catching up. I hadn’t seen a few of these guys since before everything got locked down and a few of them barely looked like the people they’d been before the world had gone to shit but it was still good to finally see them again! I remember that at one point, the waiter came over to take our drink orders. I told them I was fine, I had a water bottle from home. They gave me a look that was just a little bit annoyed, but I just brushed it off. They weren’t going to understand.

&#x200B;

“Seriously? A water bottle from home?” Amber teased.

“It’s filtered!” I said, “I’ve got this new filter. It’s great! I mean like, seriously incredible. You ever heard of Natural Think?”

&#x200B;

Her brow furrowed slightly.

“What’s that? Like Brita or something?”

“No, it like makes the water better for you. Seriously, it’s great.”

&#x200B;

Amber didn’t look convinced, but she’d opened up this particular topic of discussion and I’d make a believer of her yet.

“Here. You want to give it a shot?” I opened my water bottle and poured some of the contents into an empty glass. “Just try it. It does have a bit of a different taste at first. But I promise, I’ve been sleeping better ever since I started this stuff. I honestly don’t remember the last time I felt this good!”

&#x200B;

Amber picked up the glass and looked down at it. I saw her face contort into a mask of sheer disgust as she retched, as if she’d just taken a whiff of pureed dogshit.

“Oh God… Jordan, it *stinks*!

&#x200B;

Stinks?

&#x200B;

I looked down at the water. It looked fine to me. It was a little foamy, sure and it did have a slight smell to it but it was fine! Just a side effect of the filtration process. One of our other friends leaned in to take a sniff of the water glass, only to recoil.

“Jesus! What the hell is in that? It reeks!”

“It’s just water!” I tried to assure them, “It’s fine, honestly!”

“Jordan, don’t you smell that? That’s disgusting!”

&#x200B;

I didn’t understand… The water was fine! I shrugged it off before picking up the glass and downing it. Amber winced in disgust.

“It’s perfectly fine.” I said, but nobody looked convinced.

And then…

“Jordan? Jordan!”

&#x200B;

Amber had suddenly gotten closer to me. I didn’t remember her moving. She snapped her fingers in front of my face. The waiter was standing near us, looking concerned. One of my friends had his phone in his hand as if he was poised to call for help.

“Jordan?” Amber asked again, “Jordan, what happened?”

“Nothing… I…”

“You just stopped moving! You weren’t even talking and your nose…”

&#x200B;

My nose? I reached up and felt blood trickling out of my left nostril. A bright red stain had appeared on the tablecloth that Amber had hastily tried to clean up. She looked over towards my other friend.

“Call a doctor.”

“I’m fine…” I assured her, “It’s fine… We should order…”

“Jordan, you just spaced out for like fifteen minutes!”

&#x200B;

There was real concern in her voice. I blinked slowly, before shaking my head. No… No, I was fine… I…

&#x200B;

“I need a drink, that’s all. Where’s my water bottle…?” I looked around for it but didn’t see it. “Where’s my bottle?”

Amber didn’t answer.

“What the hell have you been drinking?” She asked, putting her hands on my cheeks to get me to look at her. I brushed her off of me.

“I’m fine!” I said, “Where’s my water?”

“We got rid of the fucking water, Jordan!”

“But I need that!”

&#x200B;

I pushed her off of me and looked around, hoping that would somehow magically return my bottle to me. No luck… But as I scanned the restaurant, I caught a glimpse of shadows in the windows. Dark figures watching us at the table. Not just standing around.

&#x200B;

Staring directly at us.

&#x200B;

Watching us.

&#x200B;

They’d never done that before. They’d never shown more than a fleeting interest in me before… Something was wrong… Something was very wrong…

“I-I’ve got to go…” I stammered, “I’m sorry. I need to go.”

“Wait, Jordan!”

&#x200B;

Amber tried to put a hand on my shoulder but I pulled away from her and made for the door. One of the waiters tried to get in my way but I ducked past them and went right out onto the street. I felt fine! I felt absolutely fine! Nothing was wrong with me! They were just overreacting… They had to just be overreacting, right?

&#x200B;

I tried to walk through the events of what had happened since I got to the restaurant but… The more I thought about it, the less I was sure I remembered. Come to think of it, I didn’t even remember driving myself to the restaurant…

&#x200B;

I only vaguely remembered who else had been at the table, even though I was sure I’d talked to them. No… I was second guessing myself. Maybe I shouldn’t have gone out. Maybe I just needed a rest. Yeah. That was it. A rest.

&#x200B;

I crossed the street towards the parking lot I’d left my car in and got in. I could see Amber coming towards me but I didn’t want to deal with her. She broke into a run as I keyed the engine but by the time she reached my car, I was gone. I was fine. She was overreacting, that was all… I was going to go home, lay down and sleep this off. Everything would be fine.

&#x200B;

It didn’t take me too long to get out of downtown and make it onto some of the rural roads leading back home. It was getting dark, but that was fine. I felt fine… I don’t know if the same could be said of the figures I saw in the darkness, though.

&#x200B;

They seemed to linger in the shadows, hiding beside trees and in fields. Their eyeless heads were turned towards me, watching me. Even though they had no features there was something… Something wrong with the way they looked at me. Almost as if they were glaring. Upset somehow…

&#x200B;

No. No, no. Now I was overreacting! I was just upset from that fiasco at the restaurant and I was projecting that onto them. Everything was fine…

&#x200B;

My cell phone rang. It was probably Amber. I ignored it… I didn’t want to listen to her telling me that something was wrong just because I got a little nosebleed. People get nosebleeds all the time, it’s normal. I was fine… I was fine…

&#x200B;

I checked my rearview mirror. I saw the shadow of something in my back seat. I didn’t think too much of it. Annie had said that I was awake so of course I was seeing more of them… It was fine. My eyes moved back onto the road. I could see dark shapes ahead of me, standing on the asphalt but my headlights didn’t seem to illuminate them. No matter how close, they still seemed so dark and…

&#x200B;

My body hurt. My cars engine was still running but the car wasn’t moving. I had a headache. Had my head just been resting against the steering wheel, I didn’t remember? My windshield was cracked. It took me a few moments to realize what my headlights were illuminating. But after a moment, it dawned on me.

&#x200B;

I wasn’t on the road anymore. That tangled mess in front of me was what used to be a wire fence and beyond that, I only saw empty farmland…

&#x200B;

Well, that and shadows.

&#x200B;

A lot of shadows.

&#x200B;

I blinked and opened my car door. My legs were wobbly. Had I just crashed? I didn’t remember the crash? When did I crash? I looked back towards the car. I could see shadows standing behind it, avoiding my headlights. My engine was still running. I’d forgotten to take my keys out. That was fine… I was fine…

&#x200B;

I took a few more steps toward the car before noticing that the shadows seemed to be closer than they were before. They didn’t seem to move and yet they were closer…

&#x200B;

I stared at them, blinking slowly. There was a coppery taste in my mouth. I felt dizzy. My legs hurt. My head hurt. They were looking at me. Even without eyes they were looking at me. And they were getting closer.

&#x200B;

Annie said not to worry about them… They’d always been harmless and yet in that moment, something in my gut told me they didn’t seem so harmless. They were getting closer. Closer… Closer…

&#x200B;

I felt something brush my arm and turned to see one of them looming over me, a dark hand reaching out towards me. I screamed and pulled away, stumbling drunkenly towards more of the shadow things. I felt hands brush against my body. Closing around my arms and clamping down on my shoulders.

&#x200B;

Annie said they wouldn’t hurt me… But these ice cold hands that pulled me towards them said otherwise.

&#x200B;

I struggled, frantically pulling myself out of their grasp. I flailed my arms, trying to hit them but I only felt my limbs pass through thin air. The shadows eased back slightly as I squirmed out of their icy grip and started running, stumbling and tripping on unsteady legs as I got away from my car. Away from the shadows.

&#x200B;

I was fine… I was fine… No… No, I wasn’t fine!

&#x200B;

Tears streamed down my cheeks as I stumbled away from them. My sneakers scraped against the asphalt of the road. The shadows kept getting closer, silently creeping toward me. I could see more of them in front of me. The ones I’d just escaped were coming from behind me and I could see others closing in from the sides. They had me surrounded and they were closing in.

“No…” I croaked through tears and snot, “No… Please…” But they didn’t listen. I don’t even know if they heard me.

The cold hands gripped my shoulders. They closed around my arms. I didn’t have the energy to scream as I felt cold arms wrapping me tight and start to pull me away from the road. I struggled, tried to pull away again but for every icy cold grip I slipped out of, ten more seized me. They grabbed my legs, my shirt, my hair… They grabbed every part of me they could as they began to pull me into the darkness.

&#x200B;

I kept fighting. I kept squirming and then…

&#x200B;

Then I saw the shadows pull back. I saw lights, coming closer to me.

&#x200B;

With one last burst of energy, I pulled myself out of the cold grasp of the shadows and stumbled towards the oncoming light. Through the tears in my eyes, I couldn’t make out what it was… Not until I saw the terrified look on the face of the driver in the moment before his car barreled into me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The Doctor tells me that if that car had been going a little bit faster, I’d be dead. He’s probably right.

&#x200B;

I don’t remember going to the hospital, or the surgery. Maybe that’s a good thing. What I do remember is waking up in a hospital bed, hooked up to machines and barely aware of where I was. I’m not sure how much of my disorientation was from the crash and how much was from the detox. According to the doctor, my blood samples turned up some interesting results. He doesn’t know what kind of drugs I was being dosed with, but he attributes that as the cause of my episode at the restaurant, as well as my previous lost time.

&#x200B;

Amber’s been here for me… She’s visited me a lot in the hospital. She’s honestly been pretty good about all this. She’s been to my apartment to get the Natural Think filter and brought it to the hospital. My Doctor said he’s since turned it over to the police. I don’t know what they found yet… I don’t know if I want to know.

&#x200B;

What I do know is that whatever was in that filter… It messed with my head and now that I’m free of it, I feel… Not exactly better…But more myself. I can still smell that harsh chemical smell in my sink… Amber said it’s what the water I brought to the restaurant smelled like. I suspect that the filter made the dosage of whatever chemical it was adding to the water stronger over time, hence the smell. At first, it was so low that I barely noticed it. Then as I got used to it, my brain just sort of filtered it out and dismissed it as normal. Considering the state I was in, that doesn’t surprise me.

&#x200B;

My memories of the months I was on Natural Think are hazy. Things blur together. I’ve recollected everything as best I can but there are still more gaps in my memory than I’m comfortable with. I can’t imagine how much time I’m missing, or how much I can’t remember. I don’t think anything really worrying happened before the incident at the restaurant… But that’s just it. I wouldn’t remember it if it did. Was that the first episode I’d had, or was it just the first one that someone else saw? The likelihood of the latter *terrifies* me.

&#x200B;

If I’m lucky, I’ll make a full recovery and given all that’s happened, that’s probably the best silver lining I can hope for.

&#x200B;

But there’s a lot of things that still don’t sit right with me…

&#x200B;

For starters, I haven’t been able to find anything on Natural Think since I got my head clear. I’ve got the messages that Annie sent me, sure and I’ve got the ones I sent to some of my friends. The police have the filter. But any trace of them on the internet appears to have vanished. Every link I had is dead now. I even tried looking on a Wayback Machine but nothing was ever archived. It’s all just vanished.

&#x200B;

I spoke to the friends I sold to. They can corroborate my story that there was a website but according to them, they never actually got their filters. I guess they’re luckier than I was. Secondly, there’s the matter of Annie…

&#x200B;

I asked Amber to get in touch with her after the accident when she didn’t respond to any of my messages. She came back a few days later having found a news article from Vancouver about a woman being found dead in the harbor a couple of weeks back.

&#x200B;

I confirmed it with her family… It’s Annie.

&#x200B;

Police ruled her death a suicide.

&#x200B;

I’m not so sure.

&#x200B;

Because lastly… There’s the shadows.

&#x200B;

I’ve seen less and less of them as whatever was in that water has slowly left my system. But I haven’t stopped seeing them completely.

&#x200B;

It’s been almost a month since the accident. A month since I last drank that water… And I can still see them. They’re faint. I only ever see them for a few moments at a time in reflections and out of the corner of my eye, like I did when this first started. But they’re there. I haven’t told Amber about them… I’m not sure how to bring up the subject. I don’t even know if she’ll believe me, or just write it off as a lingering effect of the drugs. And maybe that’s just what it is. A residual effect from the drugs in the water. Maybe it will go away in time. I just need to be patient.

&#x200B;

But when I’m lying in bed, I swear I can feel a cold hand touching me… Not grabbing me, but just touching me. Reminding me of its presence. Sometimes I open my eyes and for a moment, I see a shadow in my room, standing over my bed. I hope to God it’s just in my head… I hope to God that it’s just the drugs. But I’m not sure.

&#x200B;

Annie said that: *‘Part of the process of ‘waking up’ is seeing what everyone else misses.’*

&#x200B;

I can’t help but wonder, what if there was some truth to that[?](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/)
