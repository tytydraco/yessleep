One of my earliest fears that persisted until adulthood is fire. Now, I understand that it’s human nature to fear fire in some capacity, but my fear of fire is heightened greatly from just a simple cautious approach to open flame. As a kid, I was always scared of fire. As an adult, I staunchly refused to ever have to personally deal with it. I won’t light a candle in my home. Sure, I’ll smoke, but only if someone pre-lights the cigarette for me. However, that’s just silly stuff. The real fear I have is shown in other aspects. For example, I once burned something in the microwave and then unplugged the microwave and refused to use it for several days until I stopped being afraid of it exploding. Stoves and ovens make me nervous as well. I’m an extremely careful cook. But, the fear just gets more and more illogical. I’ve mistaken many common noises for fire alarms. This includes the tap dripping, my cat playing with a jingley toy, and a car alarm outside. It’s like I’m hyper vigilant. At any second, there could be a fire. I’ve walked around my home sniffing like a damn hound dog to make sure none of my outlets have a smoky smell. 

There’s a sickening feeling of dreadful emptiness when I come across the aftermath of a fire. Whether it be a house in shambles or just some blackened logs in a campsite fire pit, I can’t help but feel like an awful destruction took place. Fire consumes all. Its primal hunger to destroy is never satiated.

Never in my life had I experienced a real fire emergency. In school, there were fire drills. They were fun. It took me out of class for fifteen or twenty minutes. Friends of mine have had summer fires in their backyards. I would place myself a considerable distance away from the fire, but I did enjoy the occasional roasted marshmallow. Actually, jiffy pop is one of my favourite treats! Just that… I can’t make it myself.

Above, you can see that I plainly and clearly state that I had never experienced a real fire emergency. That’s true, up until the point at which this story takes place. For 23 years, I never came face to face with my biggest fear in an uncontrolled setting. Only a couple weeks shy of my 24th birthday, my lucky streak of evading fire ended abruptly. It’s a night that I won’t ever forget.

In the early evening of a normal day in mid October, I bussed myself downtown to meet up with some friends for patio drinks. For October, the weather was still fairly warm. Even so, we knew that our patio drinking would be coming to an end soon and wouldn’t open back up until May of the following year. Winter patio drinks aren’t a thing.

I got off my bus after it pulled into the bus station. The patio my friends liked was only a short walk away from the station. I had to cross a road, then cross another road, then turn left, then cut through a back alley, and I was there. It was a routine I’d performed dozens of times. A quick, mindless trip. 

My phone buzzed. I squinted as the light of the screen lit up my face.

Hey G. Burgundy’s is full. We’re at Dizzy Wine Bar instead. Meet us there. 

“Meet us there.” Well, pals, I already frickin’ went to Burgundy’s! But they were right. Every seat at every table on Burgundy’s patio was filled. 

Annoyed by the faults in my evening plans, I decided to retrace my steps and walk to the new wine bar where my friends were. I had never walked there from the bus station before but my guess was that the walk would take me around 20 minutes. If I got lost, I’d just call on my good ol’ pal Google Maps.

I never made it to Dizzy Wine Bar.

The walk started out fine. It was already dark out but the lights of downtown led my way. The brisk air ever so subtly hurt the skin of my cheeks and nose. Ah, patio season really was coming to a close.

Only a couple of minutes into my walk, a flickering caught my eye. Glancing down confirmed it. A tiny flame, flickering on the sand and gravel of the back alley I was walking through. Someone dropped their cigarette on the ground. It was still lit. Such a tiny flame didn’t spook me much, but I did extinguish it by stomping it into the ground. Afterwards, I took a quick look at the bottom of my shoe. Not even a mark. The walk could continue.

The next block over, a flickering, slightly more apparent than the last, caught my eye again. This time, the end of a twig-like tree branch was the source. I blew it out. One single spin of smoke twirled up into the air and dissipated the higher it got. Weird that I had come across two lit flames. I assured myself there wouldn’t be any more fires and again, continued on my way.

I was wrong. I came across at least five or six more instances. Each fire was slightly bigger than the last. I was getting nervous at this point. I saw flames on bushes, in the road, and even on someone's head. He was smoking a cigarette and the top of his beanie was lit as well. He didn’t even seem to notice. Just walking along like nothing was wrong. Walking along like the top of his head was not on literal fire.

The guy, still smoking, started to whistle a bit. I recognized the tune and heard the lyrics in my head. I fell into a burning ring of fire. I went down, down, down and the flames went higher. And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire...

Okay, I seriously gotta tell this guy his beanie is on fire. Just walking and whistling and completely oblivious. Dude was on the other side of the road across from me and had taken a left. I lost him briefly when he went behind a dollar store. I had to do a quick jog after him, completely abandoning my route to the wine bar.

I attempted to chase him down. Somehow, in the brief moment that it took him to take only a few steps behind the dollar store and out of my field of vision was enough for him to completely disappear. I looked left and right. Even looked straight up into the sky for some reason. But he was gone.

Okay, not my problem anymore. Time to go meet my friends.

Then, I heard the whistling again. It took me a moment to figure out which direction it was coming from but I recognized the whistling to be that of the same man. He even began softly singing. Love is a burning thing and it makes a fiery ring…

Guess he must’ve had that song stuck in his head. I was trying to decide which direction he had gone in by listening to his song. It sounded like it was to the left of me, then to the right, then right in my ear, then from the rooftops. His voice was everywhere and it was getting around at inhuman speed. I was starting to feel disoriented. 

A street lamp went out. Then, the street lamp parallel to that one went out. The lights inside the dollar store went out. It was suddenly very dark. Feeling creeped out, I started running, hoping that I’d run right up to the wine bar patio, jump the fence, and sit down with my friends. Then, the hostess would ask me if I wanted a drink and I would order a red sangria. My friends and I would ‘cheers’ and everything would be light and fun.

As I ran, I caught sight of beanie dude again. The small flame on the top of his hat had grown and now his entire beanie was on fire. Still he whistled and walked, hands in his pockets, oblivious.

“HEY!” I shouted after him.

He didn’t look back. I shouted again. Still, he whistled and walked, occasionally humming, paying no attention to me.

I picked up my pace. Now sprinting, my heart beat wildly as I attempted to catch up to him. How in the hell had he moved so fast?

Nearly at his heels, I yelled again, wheezing and out of breath. Dude finally responded to me just as he walked up a fire exit staircase and opened a window. He gave me a friendly smile and a wave. Just a friendly greeting. Dude! Your entire head is about to be engulfed in flame! He stepped inside and shut the window behind him.

I should do a little bit of explaining here so that this next part makes sense. The building he had gone into was a small, abandoned condominium which I believe originally had 5 suites total. The upstairs suites had those winding black rail staircases leading from their back window to the ground below. It wasn’t intended to be a day-to-day method of entering and exiting. The suites had nice doors in the front. These staircases were meant to be used in emergencies, ie, a fire. Beanie dude climbed up a staircase, pulled a sliding window up, let himself through the window, then pulled it closed when he got in. I wasn’t afraid of getting caught breaking and entering. I mean, these condos were no longer lived in.

I raced up the steps. This next part is mostly weird because of how I didn’t realize it was weird at the time. As I approached the window, it opened itself, sliding upwards and creating an opening large enough for me to jump through. No one had opened it. It literally just did that on its own.

And then it abruptly snapped shut behind me. I realized my mistake instantly and tried with all my might to open the window and jump back out.

Inside, the abandoned suite and all of its abandoned, ratty furniture were lit bright red and orange by immense flames. Smoke filled the air. Flames creeped up the wall onto the ceiling. I heard wood cracking as the flames tore it apart. My worst fear. There it was.

Screaming, probably even crying, I banged on the window, frustrated that it had seized up and trapped me inside. The window would not open.

The other way out would be through the door at the front. I was in survival mode. I was searching for any exit feasible. I tore myself off of the cool glass of the window and flipped myself around, praying that the way to the front door would be safe.

For some reason, the first thing that comes to mind when I try to explain this part is fish. Imagine fish, a bunch of them, all swimming independently in a pond. Then, imagine that all the fish suddenly swim into the middle of the pond and instead of seeing a bunch of little fish, you now see one big fish in the middle where they all collected. That’s what the fire did. All the flames, big and small, gathered in the middle. I watched the fire in front of me grow taller and taller and I fell to the floor, watching helplessly. 

There is no way to describe this next part other than just plainly telling you what happened.

As the fire grew taller, it started to loom over me. Two fiery arms sprouted out from the sides, fingers intact. The fingers grew longer and turned into terrible hooked claws, sharp with flames. A smoky mouth and two eyes appeared to the point where this fire now resembled a living creature. The hands reached towards me. I looked up into the eyes of this beast, swirling and smoky, and its mouth widened. From somewhere deep within, a ginormous yelling and growling shocked me to my very core.

“RRRRRAAAAAHHHHHHHHRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!” it said.

I fell backwards and smashed my head on the window which was apparently enough to bust the glass. I jumped out of the window, then jumped off the fire escape from the top step, landed harshly on the concrete, sprained my ankle, and ran. 

You ever tried to run with a sprained ankle? You ever even tried to walk with a sprained ankle?

It didn’t last long. I ran just far enough to completely wind myself and make my chest hurt. I wheezed in pain, exhaustion, and fear. I fell to the sidewalk in a heap. Above me, the street lamp turned on. Then, the one across from it also turned on. Gathering myself, I sat on the curb. I now realized that my ankle was in pain. 

There were luckily no burns on my body. I got eight stitches on my head hobbled around on crutches for a while. After a few days on crutches, I was starting to whine and complain. I hated this new cripple life, even if it was only temporary.

In good spirits, my buddy chuckled at my complaints.

“Don’t worry,” he said, “when you’re done with the crutches, you can use ‘em as firewood!”

My other friends laughed heartily. I felt like I was going to faint.
