I’ve always been a writer. Not professionally—just small stories, personal projects, things I never expected anyone to read. Most of them live and die in my notes app, unfinished ideas that flicker out as quickly as they come.

But this time was different.

Last week, I started writing a story about a man I’d never met. He came to me in a dream—tall, pale, unsettling. His presence lingered in my mind when I woke up. Something about him felt real.

I wrote him into existence.

I described his sharp features, the deep lines around his mouth, the way his too-wide eyes never seemed to blink. In my story, he was an observer. Someone who appeared in the background of photos, security footage, even reflections—always watching, but never interacting.

I gave him a name: Daniel Holloway.

It was meant to be a horror concept, nothing more. A slow-burn paranoia piece. The kind of thing I liked writing late at night when the world felt quiet and eerie.

But then things started happening.

Day 3

The first time I noticed something was off, it was subtle.

I was scrolling through my phone, looking at old photos, when I saw something that made my stomach twist.

In the reflection of a window behind me, there was a man.

Too far to make out clearly, but something about his posture, his outline, felt eerily familiar.

I told myself I was imagining things. A trick of the light. A random passerby caught at just the right angle.

That night, I dreamed about him again. This time, he was closer.

Watching me through my bedroom window.

I woke up in a panic, heart pounding. The dream had been vivid—too vivid.

But I wasn’t afraid. Not yet.

Day 5

The next morning, I sat at my desk, ready to write. But when I opened my document, my hands froze on the keyboard.

A new sentence had appeared at the bottom of the page:

“You see me now.”

I didn’t write that.

I stared at the words, my breath shallow. Maybe I had typed it in my sleep? Maybe I was just tired, forgetting things?

I deleted the sentence and tried to move on.

That was the night my door unlocked itself.

I live alone. I always double-check my locks before bed. But at 3 AM, I woke up to the sound of my front door clicking open.

My stomach dropped.

I grabbed the baseball bat I kept under my bed and crept to the entrance, my heart hammering against my ribs. The door was open about an inch, swaying slightly as if someone had just nudged it.

I forced myself to peek outside.

Nothing.

Just the quiet street, the dim glow of the streetlights.

But I swear, for a second, I felt someone watching me.

Day 6

I decided to stop writing.

I don’t know why I thought that would fix things, but something inside me whispered that if I let the story go, if I just ignored it, maybe all of this would stop.

It didn’t.

That evening, I got a text from an unknown number.

“Why did you stop?”

I stared at my screen, my skin crawling.

I didn’t respond. I blocked the number.

An hour later, a second text came through—from a different number.

“Keep going.”

I turned my phone off.

But it didn’t matter.

Because when I turned around, I saw something that wasn’t there before.

On my kitchen counter, where I was sure there had been nothing just moments ago, sat a printed copy of my story.

And on the last page, a handwritten note:

“You need to finish it.”

Day 7

At 3:33 AM, my doorbell rang.

I wasn’t expecting anyone.

Through the peephole, I saw him.

Standing perfectly still.

Dressed exactly as I had written him.

Daniel Holloway.

I backed away, my breath caught in my throat. My phone buzzed in my pocket. A new text. No number.

“Let me in.”

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe.

The doorbell rang again.

Then again.

Then again.

A slow, rhythmic pattern. Not impatient, not frantic—just a steady knock, knock, knock.

I don’t know how long I stood there, frozen. Eventually, the knocking stopped. When I finally worked up the courage to check the peephole again… he was gone.

But there was something on my doorstep.

Another printed copy of my story.

Except this time, there was more.

New paragraphs. Sentences I had never written.

He’s inside the house now.

I whipped around so fast I nearly lost my balance. My chest felt like it had caved in. My eyes darted to every corner of the room, my ears straining to hear something—anything.

Silence.

But it didn’t feel like I was alone.

My hands shook as I picked up the story, flipping through the pages. The last line made my blood run cold.

“You shouldn’t have stopped.”

I haven’t written since. I haven’t slept since.

I don’t know what to do.

Because I made a mistake.

I should have never written his name.
