I’ve hunted that patch of timber for most of my life.

Not the romantic version. The real one. Permission slips, a rusted gate with a chain everyone pretends works, and a stand I built out of pressure-treated boards that are starting to warp because I never sealed the ends right.

It’s mixed hardwood and an old pine plantation behind a hay field. A creek on the far side, cattails in the low spots. The kind of place deer cut through when the wind is right and the acorns are down.

That morning the wind was wrong.

Not wrong for hunting. Wrong like the air didn’t want to move at all.

Late-season cold had the metal of my rifle biting through my gloves. I climbed up before first light, settled in, and did the usual: phone off, thermos out, breathe slow.

Except the woods didn’t do their part.

No squirrel shuffle in the leaves. No woodpecker. No geese overhead. Even the creek sounded muted, like it was running under a lid.

Quiet can be nice. This wasn’t nice. It felt held, like something was listening and everything else already knew to shut up.

Around 6:40, I heard the first sound.

Not a snap.

A drag.

Slow and steady. The sound of something heavy being pulled through damp leaves.

It came from my right, deeper in the pines. I leaned forward, careful not to bump the rail, and tried to catch movement between trunks.

Nothing.

The dragging stopped.

I waited.

Then it started again, closer, the rhythm unchanged. Drag… drag… drag. Like a rope sliding across ground.

I tried to talk myself into “deer with a bad leg.” I’ve seen them hobble. I’ve seen them survive broadheads and busted shoulders. Deer are stubborn like that.

Still, this didn’t sound like a limp. It sounded like something being hauled.

The sky lightened until the trees took shape. My breath came out in thin white pulls. I was watching the creek line when another noise cut in, low and quick.

A click pattern.

Light, rhythmic. Not birds. Not squirrels. It came from the ground.

Tick-tick… tick… tick-tick.

Then it stopped, like whoever made it was checking how far it carried.

I didn’t move. My legs were already going numb in that slow stand way, and I didn’t care.

A little after seven, something finally stepped out into the narrow strip of open ground along the creek.

A buck. Eight-point. Not a monster, but solid. Thick neck, decent antler mass. The kind you’d be happy with on a normal day.

It stood there for a long second, head angled like it was listening to something I couldn’t hear.

Then it took one step.

And dragged its left hind leg behind it.

Not a normal drag. The hoof didn’t lift at all. It carved a straight line through the leaves like someone had pulled a stick.

The leg itself looked wrong. Not just injured—wrong. The joint didn’t sit where it should. The angle was off, like the limb had been put back on without caring how it fit.

The buck turned its head.

Its eyes were flat. Too dark. No depth. Like painted glass.

I should’ve let it walk. I know that now. But sitting in that frozen silence, watching something finally step out, my brain did what brains do. It tried to make it normal.

It’s hurt. Put it down clean.

So I brought the rifle up and settled the crosshairs behind the shoulder.

The buck stopped.

Then it looked up.

Not a casual glance. Not scanning the tree line.

It looked right at my stand.

At me.

I squeezed the trigger.

The shot cracked and rolled out across the field. Recoil thumped my shoulder. In the scope I saw the buck jerk hard, then fold.

It went down like it had been unplugged.

For a split second, relief hit me. The clean-shot relief. The end of tension.

Then the woods went emptier.

Not just quiet—hollow. Like every small animal sound got vacuumed out at once.

I watched the buck through the scope, waiting for the chest to stop moving.

Its head lifted.

Slowly. Smoothly. Controlled.

Not the panicked lift of a wounded animal. More like something testing the body’s hinges.

Its mouth opened a little.

That clicking started again, louder.

Tick-tick… tick… tick-tick.

It didn’t sound like teeth chattering. It sounded wet. Throaty. Like something inside the neck was working.

Then the buck stood.

It pushed up on three legs. The dragged leg came up last, stiff, and set down sideways as if the joint above it didn’t exist.

It swayed once, steadied, and turned toward the creek.

Drag. Drag.

Like the shot didn’t matter.

I lowered the rifle a fraction, trying to keep my brain from skipping. Maybe I’d missed. Maybe recoil made me think I hit. But I watched it drop. I saw the impact.

I tracked it again, looking hard for blood.

There was none.

Not on the leaves. Not on its side. Not a drop.

Just a neat, dark puncture in the fur where my bullet should’ve opened it up.

A clean little hole.

Too clean.

The buck reached the creek bank and paused half in shadow, half in pale morning light.

Then it looked back at me again.

And it blinked.

A slow, full-lid blink, deliberate, like someone answering a question without words.

My hands went cold around the stock.

The buck slid down into the cattails. The reeds swallowed it. The dragging sound continued for a few seconds, then stopped.

I sat there like an idiot, rifle still shouldered, waiting for the world to turn normal again.

That’s when I felt movement behind me.

Not on the ground.

On the tree.

A subtle vibration through the trunk. My platform shivered once, like weight shifting against bark.

Then I heard a scrape directly below my boots.

Slow. Upward. Like something pulling itself along the tree.

I leaned over and looked between the boards.

Fifteen feet down, the base of the oak was shadowed. Leaves. Old sticks. Nothing obvious.

Then something pale slid into view on the far side of the trunk.

A limb.

Too long. Too thin. Jointed wrong. Skin slick in patches like something that spent most of its life wet.

It touched the bark and climbed.

Not grabbing like a bear. Not hopping like a squirrel.

It stuck and pulled, quiet and efficient, the scrape matching the motion.

A wet inhale sounded close—too close—like something breathing through a throat full of water.

The tree shivered again.

And the buck’s clicking returned, but not from the creek.

From the pines behind me.

Tick-tick… tick… tick-tick.

A signal.

Something answered from below the stand. A deeper clack, like two hard surfaces meeting.

My “safe height” stopped feeling safe.

I went for the ladder.

I climbed down fast, boots slipping on the metal rungs, hands clumsy from cold and the sudden rush in my head.

Halfway down, something hit the stand above me. The whole structure rattled. A board creaked like it might crack.

I looked up without meaning to.

A shape was perched on the platform.

Hunched low, like it didn’t want to silhouette itself against the sky. Narrow body. Ribs visible under slick skin. A head long and flat like a lizard’s, but heavier at the jaw, wrong in the proportions.

It tilted its head slowly, curious.

Then it dropped off the platform toward the trunk.

I didn’t wait.

I jumped the last five feet.

I hit hard, knees buckling, pain snapping up my shin. Leaves puffed around my boots.

I ran.

Toward the field because the truck was there and because open ground feels safer even when it isn’t.

Behind me, that scrape on bark sped up, then stopped.

Then came a different sound—low and quick—like something moving over the ground on too many points of contact. Not footsteps. A sliding gallop.

I burst into the field edge. Frozen ruts grabbed my boots. The truck sat near the gate, two hundred yards away, and it might as well have been across a river.

I sprinted.

Halfway there the air behind me got dense, like something big moved into my wake. A shadow crossed the ground beside me.

I didn’t look.

Something raked my back.

Sharp points tore through my jacket and into skin.

Pain flashed white. My breath cut off. My legs stumbled.

I hit the dirt, palms burning, and slid in frozen mud. My rifle skittered away.

I rolled onto my side and saw it in full.

Out in the open, and it didn’t care.

Long, low, built for speed. Skin ridged like plates in places, stretched thin in others. Along its sides were folds that opened and closed with each breath—wet, dark red, like gills. When it shifted, smaller limbs tucked under its chest flashed into view, then disappeared again, helping it move in short, brutal bursts.

Its head was flat and triangular, jaw hinging wider than it should. Teeth weren’t clean rows like a wolf. They were thin spikes set back like a fish’s, made for holding and not letting go. Saliva threaded between them and dotted the dirt.

It clicked once.

Then it repeated the buck’s pattern.

Tick-tick… tick… tick-tick.

Like it was mocking what it had already set in motion.

And from the tree line behind it, the dragging sound returned—slow, steady—followed by cattails rustling where cattails shouldn’t have been in a field.

The buck was coming out.

The deer was never the prize. It was a flag.

I grabbed the rifle and dragged it to me. Dirt packed into the action. I worked the bolt hard, jammed a round in, and aimed at the creature’s head.

It didn’t flinch.

It lowered itself slightly, like a cat about to spring. The gill-folds pulsed.

I fired.

The bullet hit it square in the chest.

It jerked—barely—a muscle twitch. No stumble. No panic. It opened its mouth wider and pushed out a wet, vibrating rasp, like air forced through a pipe full of water.

Then it launched.

It covered the distance in a blur. Weight hit my legs, knocked them out. I slammed into dirt, the world tilting.

Something hooked into my shoulder—claw or tooth, I don’t know—anchoring me.

I screamed and swung the rifle like a club. The stock cracked against something hard. The creature’s head snapped sideways. Its jaws clamped onto the barrel.

Metal groaned under pressure. I felt vibration through the gun like it was biting through my bones.

I kicked hard, heel connecting with its side where those wet folds moved. It twitched and released with a popping sound.

I rolled and tried to get up.

It raked my back again, deeper. Hot lines opened across my ribs. My shirt stuck immediately.

I staggered toward the truck anyway, half running, half falling.

This time it followed at a walk.

It didn’t need to sprint. It knew what it had done to me.

In my peripheral vision the buck finally stepped into the field, dragging that wrong leg, head bobbing like something tugged on a string attached to its spine.

The two of them clicked in overlapping rhythms.

A conversation.

I fumbled the keys out of my pocket with fingers that didn’t want to work. Dropped them once. Found them in the dirt with numb hands and luck.

I yanked the driver’s door open.

The creature hit the side of the truck. Not hard enough to flip it. Hard enough to dent. The whole vehicle rocked.

Its face pressed close to the window.

Up close, the eye was wrong in a way my brain keeps replaying. No clear pupil. Just a dark, wet surface with a faint oil-sheen.

It clicked right against the glass.

The truck cranked slow because it’s old and because cold had it by the throat. For half a second nothing happened and my mind went straight to the dumbest, simplest ending: a dead battery.

Then the engine caught.

I slammed it into reverse and floored it. Tires spun, grabbed, sprayed frozen dirt.

The creature slid back a step—didn’t fall, just gave me space.

I swung the truck around and punched for the gate.

In the mirror, it walked after me a few paces and stopped. The buck stood in the field, dragging, watching my taillights.

They didn’t chase.

They didn’t need to.

It didn’t feel like they’d “failed” to kill me. It felt like I’d been tested.

I drove straight to the ER because my back was wet and my shirt was glued to me. Every bump on the road made the scratches flare.

In triage, I lied.

I told them I slipped climbing down and caught my back on old barbed wire at the field edge. I said it fast, like if I didn’t slow down, nobody would ask me to make it make sense.

The nurse didn’t believe the story, not fully, but she didn’t argue. She cut my shirt off and the air on my skin made me see white.

Five long rakes down my right side, parallel, deep enough to show pink beneath. Smaller punctures near my shoulder like something had hooked in and held.

“Animal?” she asked, already reaching for a saline bottle.

“I didn’t see it,” I said. That was true. And it wasn’t.

She asked if I wanted them to call anyone. Police. Animal control. Fish and wildlife. Whoever you call when you show up bleeding and you’re not making eye contact.

I shook my head too fast. “No. Please. I just want it cleaned.”

They cleaned it. Stitched what needed stitches. Antibiotics. Tetanus. The boring medical stuff that keeps you alive.

They asked if it was a bear.

I said I didn’t see a bear.

Two days later, I went back in daylight with my cousin because I needed my rifle, and because I needed to prove to myself there was a rational explanation hiding in plain sight.

We found the rifle in the field with the stock snapped and dirt packed into the action.

We found my boot prints and the long slide where I’d hit the ground.

We found the stand still strapped to the oak.

But at the base of the tree, in the mud, we found the drag mark.

And beside it, a pattern of impressions like the edge of a shovel pressed into the ground in repeating lines, moving in a straight path toward the creek.

My cousin stared at it for a long time without talking.

Neither of us said the word deer.

We left.

That night, I hung my torn jacket on a chair because I couldn’t bring myself to put it back in the closet. The back was shredded where the claws had found me. Dried blood had turned the lining stiff.

I slept in short, stupid bursts, waking every time I shifted and my back pulled.

Sometime after 2 a.m., my dog stood in the hallway staring at the front door.

Not barking. Not growling.

Just staring like he’d been called.

I got up and listened.

At first, nothing.

Then a sound from the porch.

Not footsteps.

A slow drag across wood, like something being pulled.

Then that same small, deliberate pattern—faint, but unmistakable—coming through the door like someone tapping two pebbles together just outside.

Tick-tick… tick… tick-tick.

I didn’t open the door.

I didn’t even get close.

I stood there in the dark, holding my breath, while my dog kept staring.

And then, very softly, something scraped along the bottom edge of my front door, like a blunt nail testing the seal.

In the morning, I found proof that made my stomach drop.

Three shallow gouges in the porch board directly in front of my door, parallel and evenly spaced, like someone had dragged the edge of a tool across it.

And pressed into the dried mud on my doormat was a straight line—clean and smooth—like a hoof that never lifted had been pulled, once, in a single patient drag.

No tracks leading away.

Just that mark, aimed at my threshold.
