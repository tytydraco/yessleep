 it was 3:05 AM and I put down my cup of coffee and  picked up my phone while my leg shaked anxiously. i opened snapchat to see  “Delivered 2 days” on my main drug dealers  snapchat profile.  i look down and see the same thing under all of my backup drug dealers snapchat profiles.  “Fuck!” i shouted out loud,  knowing that my stash had run out a few hours ago. I was desperate, i couldn’t bear the thought of going through withdrawals. the whole situation was very odd. why did all of my drug dealers go silent 2 days ago? i put down my phone and was about to reach for another sip of my coffee when i heard my phone Ding 10 times in a row from notifications. i instantly picked up my phone and looked at the notifications. they were from all of my friends who knew that i used. each message said the same exact thing: 

“ yo if ur looking for some 🧊 💨  hit up my boy @pablosells3737 on snapchat 💯 “

“What the fuck?”i  said out loud to myself. 
i decided to look past the bizarreness and open snapchat. i typed the username and hit “add friend”. i was about to place my phone down when i  got a notification. “Pablo added you back! Say Hi” followed
 by another notification that read: “Pablo is typing…” followed by “Pablo sent a chat!” 
I clicked on the notification and the chat conservation opened up. i saw his message that read “Yo i have an ounce of crystal for you, i’m on my way right now. how does 40$ sound?” 


“What the fuck?   how is he on his way if he doesn’t know my address? and only 40$ for an entire ounce of crystal? is this guy out of his mind?” i thought. 
it seemed way to good to be true, and extremely sketchy at that. but my addict mind didn’t care about that. i didn’t care if this was sketchy or risky, all i cared about was getting my hands on the substance i loved but  also hated. “Alright, sounds good.” i responded. a notification popped up saying that my childhood best-friend who i occasionally talked to had sent me a chat.  i clicked on it to see  this strange message containing an interesting set of rules. 

“Hey man, i know it’s been a while. listen, i don’t have much time. i don’t have time to explain anything, i’m sorry, but this list of rules can possibly  help you make it through the transaction safely. 

1. you must treat him like a human. Pablo is not human, he’s also not alien. Pablo is beyond human comprehension, but you must treat him like a human. he doesn’t like it when you don’t. 
2.  Do not cancel the order. if you already responded to his first message, (which i know you did) , there is no turning back. if you cancel the order he will envelope your mind with horrors beyond your perception. 
3.   BE. ON. TIME. this is the most important rule. he will arrive at the park in your neighborhood at exactly 3:43:32 AM. it’s best  to arrive early, because if you are even a nano second late to arrive there, it’s over for you. 
4. Do not make eye contact with the person in the passenger seat of Pablo’s vehicle. 
5. you must Give him a vial of Human blood. it is his favorite pleasure. 
6. The Being in the back seat will try to start conversation with you. do not engage or give it any reaction. completely ignore it.  
7.  Make sure the money you hand him is folded in half. this is a very important rule, if you don’t do this, serious consequences will follow. 
8.  do not give pablo any type of thanks. simply take the substance. 
9. immediately turn around so your back is facing pablo. close your eyes and count to 30. during this time the being, the passenger,  and pablo  will simultaneously try to get any type of verbal sound out of you. Do not give in. stay completely silent for the 30 seconds. 
10. Walk home as fast as you can and never look behind you. once you make it in the front door you are safe. 
11. Block Pablo on snapchat, and block every single friend that reccomended Pablo to you. after this, you are done with the transaction. congratulations. “
