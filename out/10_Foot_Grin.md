I’m losing my mind. I know it. I’ve been reading posts here for the last few hours hoping someone has an answer. But I can’t tell if I am still hallucinating or if I am in real danger.



My name is Simon, and 6 days ago, I quit taking Adderall cold turkey. I knew the risks. I had been taking it for 14 years, since I was 5, and my doctor at my mother’s prompting wouldn’t help me ween off of it.

I did my research, and I knew the risk of stopping cold turkey. I KNEW. I saw the potential for psychosis, heart issues, and even death. I just figured they were unlikely outcomes and side effects, like with taking any kind of medication. I was wrong.



The first couple of days were fairly normal to any time I had ever forgotten my pills, or just ran out and couldn’t get them filled. Extreme hunger, foggy brain, no will power, extreme fatigue ect.. But yesterday; the 5th day, I started seeing things. At first it was only in the dark, I’d see faces, bodies, and anything that had a humanoid shape really took form. 



What made this worse is we just moved as a family right as I turned 19. We moved in with my uncle, who had just bought this large Victorian house that was 3 stories tall, and had a large unfinished basement. I am completely unfamiliar with the house and its various rooms and sounds. So, when I see something, it is usually pretty startling. I do my best to ignore and not engage with anything I see, because I read that engaging with hallucinations is a great way to lose touch with the real world and spiral into madness.



Now you are caught up to today, which other than debilitating fatigue, being in and out of a restless sleep, the daytime was hardly eventful. Nothing out of the ordinary from others experiences of withdrawal until around 8pm tonight. It’s winter and it’s already dark outside. With the shadows and darkness came the faces, and this time a voice. Barely a whisper at first, so much so that I wasn’t even sure I heard anything at all. My bedroom is really one giant room I share with my two younger brothers, but it has a wall that can be pulled across, separating us into separate rooms. When it first occurred, I swore I heard my name being called. I looked up over at my brothers, Will and Silas; both of them wearing headphones, faces lit up only by the lights of their phone screens. Faces and various amorphous beings floating around them.



I just kinda put it out of my mind until I heard soft footsteps, quickly running down the hall. Thinking it could have been my mother (although weird because I definitely heard Simon, and my mom and family all call me Sim) I got up, opened the door into the hall and peered out into the dark. Down the long dark hallway, I could see the soft light of the water dispenser on the fridge, but little else. Confused because this was the direction the footsteps had been in, I stepped out into the hallway towards the kitchen. 



“Mom”? I called out, my voice echoing down the hall. No answer. I shuffled my way through the hallway, hands sliding along the walls feeling for a light switch. I really ought to do a better job of committing their placements to memory. I got maybe 10 feet down the hallway, about halfway to the kitchen when I saw it. A figure a little different than the rest. I couldn’t really tell its limbs apart from the rest of the dark background, but could vaguely see that it was around 10 ft tall, its mouth spread into a wide grinning smile, and its eyes which were a bright fluorescent white. 



I froze in my tracks. My blood is pounding in my ears. It began moving towards me, not walking, but unfurling itself with long lanky steps, like a spider stretching across the floor. Its mouth opened, showing jagged teeth spanning all the way to the back of its mouth. A scream erupted out of it so loud it made the floor vibrate. Covering my ears, wincing in pain, I began walking backwards, my hands still tracing the walls, feeling, hoping for a light switch. Still believing the light would save me, bring me back to reality. The monster reached the archway and its legs began to stretch out, lowering its body to fit into the lowered ceiling of the hallway. I gave up on finding a light switch and quickly turned around running back towards my room, seeing the light coming from underneath the door. As I reached the door and turned the knob I could hear it’s soft and quick footsteps rapidly approaching me. I wrenched the door open and slammed it shut behind me.



Both my brothers looked up at me with wide eyes, taking off their headphones. 



“Can you maybe not slam the doors in the middle of the night? Mom and everyone else is asleep” asked Will quietly.



“Also turn that light off” added Silas.



“Did either of you hear that? Feel that?” I said in between heavy breaths, bracing myself against the door.



“The only thing I heard was you being an ass” retorted Silas, putting his headphones on.



I turned my gaze to Will, hoping for at least something from him, but all I got was an inquisitive worried stare that lasted for a few seconds before he too put his headphones back on and resumed watching his phone.



No? Just me? “Well fuck me then I guess” I muttered under my breath. I stayed braced against the door for a few moments longer. Wondering whether or not my 135lbs and a door would have been enough to stop that abomination from my nightmares anyways.



I regained my composure, turned on my tv before I shut out the light, jumped into my bed, and closed my eyes. My head was throbbing and I felt like I had just run a marathon. I took some deep breaths and tried to think. What the hell was that? 



The rest of these hallucinations didn’t have real forms. They quickly moved in and out of existence in front of my eyes. They weren’t really scary, and I had been adjusting to the fact that if it was dark and I turned my head, I was going to see something.



But this?! What was that… Am I crazy? Even as I type this under my blanket with my laptop, I can hear my name being called softly. This time though, I can tell, it’s coming from right outside the door.



Alright. I'm signing off. Concentrating to type this out was a feat of willpower I truly did not believe I have right now. If anyone has anything... ideas, experiences.. please. Reach out. Comment. If anything else happens, I'm sure you'll hear from me again.
