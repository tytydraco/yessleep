I pray you read this with care, for it may save your life. This man was once my friend, until he transformed into something beyond comprehension.

It all began on the 24th of March in 2023. Dante's birthday had passed just days before, so we decided to celebrate with a few drinks and good times. The group consisted of five guys, including myself. Dante, in particular, was curious about LSD and had managed to get his hands on some.

As the night progressed, Dante began to experiment with the hallucinogenic drug. At first, nothing seemed out of the ordinary, but slowly, his behavior became increasingly bizarre. His eyes fixed on an empty wall, and his face twisted into an unsettling smirk.

Dante's behavior escalated into a frenzy of shrieks and screams. He sprung up from his chair and ran to the bathroom. He shoved toothbrushes into his ears, causing blood to flow from them. Then, he cut his own mouth and charged towards us with a terrifying grin.

Before I could react, Dante had killed three of my friends with inhuman speed and precision. I had to act fast to survive, so I impaled him with a broken bottle as he leaped towards me. Dante fell to the ground, dead. But little did I know the damage had already been done.

That night, I dreamed of him. But it wasn't the Dante I knew; it was something else entirely. His eyes were lifeless, his skin pale, and his movements jerky and unnatural. I sensed that if I moved, I would perish, so I remained still until I woke.

Days turned into weeks, and the more I tried to convince myself that it was all in my head, the more I realized that I was being stalked by something beyond comprehension. I would hear whispers in the dead of night, footsteps pacing the floors of my home, and every time I would catch a glimpse of him, his eyes would bore into my soul, sending chills down my spine.

As time passed, the haunting became more intense, and I could feel his presence closing in on me. I began to lose my mind, and with every passing day, I could feel my sanity slipping away. Sleep is a luxury I didn’t have for the fear of him kept me awake, and even my waking hours were spent in a constant state of fear. I haven’t slept since the first time seeing him in my dream.

In a desperate attempt to rid myself of this nightmare, I turned to occult rituals and ancient texts. I performed every exorcism and cleansing ritual known to man, but nothing seemed to work. The entity that was once my friend had become something far more sinister, something beyond human comprehension.

And so, I have resigned myself to my fate. I know that the end is near, and that my final moments will be spent in agony, consumed by the darkness that has plagued me for these past two weeks. But if there is one thing I can do before I go, it is to warn others of the dangers that lurk in the shadows, to urge them to stay away from the temptations of the unknown, for once you cross that threshold, there may be no turning back.

If you've encountered this man in your dreams, heed my warning. Lock your doors, keep the lights on, and do not fall asleep. If you do, be ready to wake yourself up or stay perfectly still, for he will hunt you down and claim your life.
