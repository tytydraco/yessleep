I hate being late. The taxi I had hailed from my front door while still pulling on my shoes and holding a piece of toast in my teeth, was now no quicker than my usual ride by bike. The irony of this did nothing to warm me. I am answerable to a supervisor and even though my balance of credit with the company is largely good it wasn’t “up-for-promotion” good. More “not-getting-the-sack” good. I withdrew a tissue from my pocket and wiped butter from my fingers. I leaned forward to talk to the driver.  
“What is it? Why have we stopped?”  
The driver turned round. “Just have. Traffic problems somewhere. Can’t turn around, neither. Traffic’s backed up behind me.”  
I waited another seven and a half minutes then disembarked and paid the driver. I considered trotting but already, at a quarter past eight, it was oppressively hot and muggy. The sun, undefeated by a morning haze, threatened another blistering day; the sixth in sequence.  
“This is it, enjoy it while it lasts.” I told myself. “This is the great British summer.”  
I turned into Lime Tree Walk and found the street choked with police cars. Officers strung yellow tape around some posts. On foot I could get past, though just.  
I recognised an elderly woman standing at her gate watching the movement of police. Despite being in a rush, I stopped.  
“Mrs. Mower?”  
She was wearing the same floral pinafore dress that I had seen her in a small boy. I reasoned, years ago, that she may have bought a job lot of them in sixties as they never seemed to fade or become threadbare.  
She turned to face me, scowled as she tried to recognise me and put her hand to her mouth.  
“Little Merrill Wilkins!”  
Little? I was now in my forties and considerably overweight.  
“Yes. It’s me. I was cutting through to get to my office. Traffic’s too bad around here, so it’s Shank’s pony I fear.”  
I gestured to the police who were spilling in and out of a house on the opposite side of the road.  
“What all this?”  
“Someone’s dead. Murdered I heard.”  
I looked back at the house and shuddered. Maybe it was how close to home this was that shook me, but I knew my visceral reaction was from childhood. The day when we all disembarked from the school bus and little Eric Peters ran behind the bus to cross the road, into the path of a car. It wasn’t just watching his tiny frame being flung across the road that had seared my memory, but Teresa Adams screaming until she vomited, Eric’s mother on the far side of the road, falling to her knees and screaming at her sudden, irredeemable loss. It was only natural that violent death was now a nemesis to my mental health. Choking back bile, I croaked, “Who? Who is it – was it?”  
“That flash man, Sinclair, something Sinclair. With the flash car. Look.”  
I looked at the Jaguar parked opposite. Again, I was speared by a cold needle of something. Fear? Apprehension? I felt weak and dizzy.  
“Are you all right, Merrill?”  
“I don’t know. I mean, yes. Just shocked I suppose. Here in suburban London. How was he killed?”  
“The woman who cleans for him; her boy said it was a club, one those used by Americans in that game.”  
A baseball bat. I nodded and saying goodbye continued to my office. No longer so anxious about my possible tardiness as the feeling which overwhelmed me when I had heard about Sinclair. Such things, I reasoned, brought home one’s mortality; a graphic reminder of just how fragile life was and is. It poked at my being with red hot fingers. I would being seeing my psychiatrist later and maybe he would help.  
I looked up at the hazy blue sky where bolsters of black cloud sat waiting on the horizon; maybe not the day I thought it would be after all. After the rain the sun, after the sun the rain. This is the way of life. Reciting to myself fragments of the hymn, I broke into a trot.  
Once in my office I quickly searched out our local radio station on the internet and plugging the headphones into the jack socket, listened to the streamed music and chat from the station. Maybe more detail would clear things up for me. Maybe details would provide some relief from having been in the proximity of such violence.  
There was nothing on the news, and web sites for local papers gave nothing more away. The police sometimes kept their cards very close to their chests.

The day wore on, I thought more about the murder and how Dr. Waltham could placate my disquiet. In an odd method of fusing the wildly opposing opinions of himself and the medical profession, I saw myself as a genuinely ailing hypochondriac and so in the main viewed my visits with the good doctor as a sop to my condition; a band-aid on a broken limb. I supposed the visits were probably doing me good, I wasn’t able to tell, but now with a tangible and real feeling of doom engulfing me, I needed the comfort of a listening ear. Badly.

Despite the air-conditioning in the office, I began to sweat. In the bathroom, I looked at my tongue in the mirror then pulling down my lower lid, examined his eye.  
“I don’t even know what I am looking for.” I admitted to himself.  
Placing fingers inexpertly on my pulse I counted my life’s rhythm until again I admitted that I didn’t know what was normal.  
“Sinclair.” I said to the mirror. Life was terribly cheap. No! Not true. It’s expensive, hard to hang onto. Death? There’s plenty to go round. One each. No pushing, no shoving, form an orderly and you will get served in due time – and guess what folks, it’s free! Now, *that’s* cheap.

Waltham’s surgery was on the top floor of a converted town house. The staircase was old and wooden, and the hallway had a permanent smell of polish about it. Reaching the stop stair, I took out my phone and logged a preamble to my visit using a memo recorder. I always did this; it’s what I do. Time, date, intention, all recorded. I put the phone back in my jacket pocket and knocked gently on the door.

Waltham had no secretary but enforced with some vigour the need to knock and wait for invitation. The office was distinctly different to the hallway. Money and style had been poured liberally into the room and spoke of efficiency, ability and ultimately, cure and rehabilitation.

“How’s things, Merrill?”  
“I need to talk to you Doctor. Badly. I want to tell you about today. A man was murdered and I guess it’s spooked me. I mean, I have been that close to violent death before. It’s just that this event roused those memories.”  
Waltham held his hands up.  
“Whoah! Slow down. In fact, lie down, will you?”  
Waltham went to the window and looked out at the gathering black clouds, drew the drapes against them and sat at his desk again. The room was quiet. After a few moments, Waltham said: “Tell me all about it.”  
“It’s nothing really, well nothing I can put my finger on. Could it be my childhood again? You said that a lot of my problems probably go back that.”  
“We’ll find out.” A long pause then: “I’m counting backwards, quite slowly from ten to one. And as I count you will start to relax.”  
His voice, though soothing and melodious in its instruction, was nonetheless firm and authoritative.  
Eventually I slept a waking slumber and the doctor continued talking.  
“I am going to help you now. I am going to help you to remember and then to forget and put the unpleasant things behind you.”  
Then quite suddenly I slept deeply and heard nothing.  
When I awoke the doctor was looking out of the window into the street. I sat up and rubbed my eyes. “How was that doctor?”  
“It was very revealing,” he replied without turning from the window, “we need to concentrate on a few areas of your psyche. You are a deeply troubled child in a man’s body.”  
This made sense to me.  
“I think a storm is coming,” the doctor observed.

He was right. I looked from the window of my living room. I observed the children making their way home from school, pulled along anxiously their mothers as the threat of a deluge increased. And talking of mothers, my own would want the daily update from her damaged boy. I took the phone from my jacket, now hanging on the back of the door. To my surprise I found that I had left the memo recorder on.  
I spent several minutes looking at the phone. I didn’t want to play back the results of my own therapy but then again, I did. I thought of it in horrid fascination. What was I saying to the doctor? Did I really want to know? I made myself a cup of tea and sitting on the couch, played back my recording. Time, date, intention as per normal, small talk and introduction leading to the point where I blacked out.  
“Can you hear me, Merrill?” He evidently waited for a response, but I don’t appear to have given one.  
“The murder you heard about today – it frightens you, doesn’t it?”  
“Yes.”  
“There’s nothing to be afraid of – you are quite all right. No one is going to harm you. Do you understand? Good. Now, let’s talk about nicer things. More down-to-earth things: last night – what did you eat? What can you remember about it?”  
“A take-away from the chippy. Steak and kidney pie and chips. Pie was three pounds fifty, adult portion of chips, one pound sixty. No salt or vinegar. Curry sauce, ninety pence. Small wooden chip fork. Curry sauce spilt down my windcheater and chinos. Some splashed on my shoes.”  
“What did you do with those clothes?”  
“I burnt them.”  
“All of them?”  
“All of them.”  
“I see. Now tell me about the thing you saw this morning. The thing that’s upset you.”  
“Sinclair?”  
“Yes, Merrill, Mr. Sinclair.”  
“Nothing. I don’t know him.”  
“Are you sure you don’t know him? You cannot lie to me, you know that don’t you?”  
“I knew a Sinclair. Mr. Sinclair. The wife thief and marriage wrecker. Evil Sinclair.”  
“Ah! That’s the one,” there was a lengthy pause then: “you didn’t only burn your clothes because of the curry sauce, did you?”  
“No.”  
I could hear on the recording Waltham walking around as he considered this. There was something very ironic here that we had patient/doctor confidentiality.  
“Do you travel, Merrill?”  
Again, I don’t appear to have responded.  
“Merrill, have you ever been abroad?”  
“Yes. Day trip with the school. Calais, France and back.”  
“Have you ever flown in a plane?”  
“No.”  
“I think it might be good for you. Broaden your horizons. See a bit of the world. What do you think?”  
“I don’t know.”  
After a long pause doctor Waltham continued “My wife, Mrs Waltham, is an eminent doctor and gifted oncologist. I never told you that, did I?”  
Again, no reply.  
“You see, Merrill, my wife, Mrs Waltham – cheating lover of the late Mr. Sinclair – is going to a seminar in Lucerne in four months time. That gives you plenty of time to get yourself a passport. A baseball bat will be out of the question this time so I will make other arrangements. Do you understand?”

I let the phone fall onto the couch and stood slowly. The streets were now full of people making their way home from work. The bulging black clouds in the sky made good on their promise and burst in a torrent onto the people below.
