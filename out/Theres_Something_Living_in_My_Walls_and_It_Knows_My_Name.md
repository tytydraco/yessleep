Hey Reddit. I’m not sure where else to post this. I haven’t slept in three nights. I feel like I’m losing my mind. I don’t want to call the cops because they’ll think I’m crazy, and if I’m wrong… well, I don’t know what’s worse anymore.

Let me back up.

I live alone in a small, one-bedroom house just outside Asheville, North Carolina. It’s nothing fancy—just an old rental from the 60s with thin walls and creaky floors, the kind of place that shifts and groans when the wind picks up. I moved here in January after my divorce. Quiet place, surrounded by woods, good for writing and being alone with my thoughts—or so I thought.

The weirdness started two weeks ago.

I was brushing my teeth one night when I heard something behind the bathroom wall. Not pipes. Not the usual settling. It sounded… deliberate. Like fingers drumming slowly across wood. Five taps. Then silence. I stood there, toothbrush in hand, staring at the wall, trying to convince myself it was just some old plumbing acting up.

But the tapping came back the next night.

Same spot. Same rhythm. Five taps. Then nothing.

It happened again the night after that. And then I started hearing whispers.

Now before you write this off as sleep deprivation or overactive imagination—I did too. The first time I heard it, I was in bed. The sound came from the vent near my headboard. Faint, almost like wind. But it wasn’t wind. It was a voice. Whispers. Garbled words I couldn’t make out… except for one.

**“Eli.”**

That’s my name.

I sat up so fast I nearly fell out of bed. I didn’t sleep at all that night. I just sat there, staring at the vent, heart pounding.

The next morning, I called the landlord. Told him I thought there might be some kind of animal in the walls. He didn’t seem concerned.

“These old houses,” he said. “Squirrels, maybe. Mice if you’re unlucky.”

He promised to send someone to check, but no one came.

And the noises got worse.

Now it’s happening during the day. Soft scratching behind the walls. Tapping on the glass when I pass a window—even when the blinds are down. One afternoon, I swear to God, I heard breathing coming from under the kitchen sink.

I opened the cabinet.

Nothing.

But everything smelled… off. Like rot and mildew and something else. Something sweet and sour, like meat left out in the sun.

Then last Friday… I found the note.

It was on my pillow.

Just a scrap of lined paper, torn at the edges. No envelope. No sign of forced entry. Just four words in shaky, childlike handwriting:

**“I live in here.”**

I vomited in the bathroom. I called the landlord again. No answer. Called him three more times. Left voicemails. Nothing.

Then I installed cameras. One in the living room, one in the bedroom, and one facing the hallway. All motion-activated, all hooked up to my phone.

Saturday night was quiet.

Too quiet.

No tapping. No whispers. I almost let myself believe it was over. That maybe I was just cracking from stress.

But around 3:17 a.m., my phone buzzed. Motion detected in the hallway.

I opened the app.

The footage was only ten seconds long.

And in those ten seconds, I saw **something** crawl out of the vent in the ceiling.

It didn’t move like a person. It dragged itself—limbs too long, joints bending the wrong way. Pale, wet skin. No hair. And its face—

Jesus, I don’t know how to describe it. Like a man wearing someone else’s face over his own, stretched too tight. The eyes were completely black. No lids. Just open, bulging, and staring directly into the bedroom camera before the clip ended.

I tore the vent off the wall that morning. There was nothing inside.

I haven’t slept since.

The cameras now go off constantly. Always around 3 a.m. But when I play the footage, it's blank. Just static. Once, I swear I saw a flash of a face in the static—just for a frame—but when I rewind, it’s gone.

Yesterday, someone knocked on my door.

I didn’t answer.

I watched through the peephole.

It was a man in a maintenance uniform. No logo. Just standing there, not moving. I waited for him to knock again or say something.

But he didn’t.

He just stood there. For over an hour. Then he turned and walked into the woods behind the house.

I’m writing this from the floor of my bedroom. All the lights are on. Every vent is covered. I have a knife next to me, even though I know it won’t do shit. I’m not dealing with something human.

And tonight… it spoke again.

Clearer this time. Not from the vent.

From **inside the wall**, behind my bed.

It said:

**“Why’d you block the door, Eli? I was almost out.”**

If I don’t post tomorrow, assume it got me.

Please… if anyone has heard of anything like this, message me.

I don’t think I’m alone in this house anymore.

And I don’t think **I ever was**.
