   I'm sorry I didn't continue with what happened to me; it's just that what I witnessed was so grotesque that I couldn't process it. Also, these past few days, strange things have been happening. But after I turned my gaze towards the guard...  
  
   Something seemed out of place, and a feeling of unease overcame me. In the corner of my peripheral vision, I noticed a change in the mannequin. A shiver ran through me when I realized that its limbs had changed positions.  
  
   With my attention divided between the guard and the mannequin, I approached the plastic figure. I extended my arms and lifted it, and that's when the sensation turned grotesque. The mannequin, which should have been stiff and cold, felt oddly heavy in my arms. But what surprised me the most was the texture of its skin: smooth and warm, like that of a human.  
  
   A shiver of disgust and repulsion ran down my spine. My mind struggled to process what I was experiencing. How could a mannequin have such a realistic texture? My instinct told me to let go of that lifeless thing, but an inexplicable force compelled me to hold onto it.  
  
   Amidst my confusion, I noticed that the mannequin seemed to move slightly in my arms. It wasn't a sudden jolt or a abrupt movement, but a subtle sway, as if it were breathing. A wave of nausea washed over me, and my gloves seemed to stick to the mannequin's skin, as if they didn't want to let go. The air grew heavier, and a mixture of contradictory emotions clouded my mind.  
  
   My eyes finally left the guard and returned to the mannequin. In an instant, the illusion faded. The mannequin returned to its lifeless form, with its hands extended forward as if pointing with invisible plastic daggers. The scene felt like a nightmare that had ensnared me, distorting my perception of reality.  
  
A chill of horror swept through my body as I confronted the grotesque truth. My mind struggled to comprehend what I had witnessed, while my instinct urged me to flee from this nightmare. 

   I stepped back, distancing myself from both the mysterious mannequin and the guard with hands in an attacking stance. Each step felt slow and heavy, as if I were battling against an invisible force trying to hold me in this distorted world.  
  
   After the unsettling experience with the mannequin and the mysterious guard, a sense of paranoia gripped me. I knew I had to follow the rules, even if they seemed absurd. One of the rules, rule number 11, echoed in my mind: "Do not let the mannequins follow you with their gaze." Although the previous experience had been more about the mannequin's hands, I felt uncomfortable with its changing figure.  
  
   I had no choice but to comply with rule 10, which stated: "If a mannequin follows you with its gaze, take it to the elevator and wait for the doors to close." Even though this sounded absurd and almost impossible to believe, the urgency of following the rules and avoiding any further grotesque experiences compelled me to do so.  
  
   Holding the mannequin in my arms, I headed towards the elevator. The sensation of its smooth, warm skin still lingered in my mind, but I forced myself not to dwell on it. The lights flickered more intensely in the hallway, and the shadows seemed to come to life, twisting unusually on the walls.  
  
Upon reaching the elevator, the doors opened with a gentle mechanical buzz. Keeping my gaze fixed on the interior of the elevator...  
  
   As I kept my gaze fixed on the elevator, the mysterious guard arrived in silence, emerging from the shadows like an ominous figure. We didn't exchange words or glances; I simply knew that he had come to fulfill the strange and macabre task that the rules demanded.  
  
   Without warning, the guard extended his hands towards the mannequin. It was clear that he wasn't wearing gloves. Although a part of me wanted to warn him about the rules and the grotesque experiences that had occurred, something about his determined demeanor stopped me.  
  
   The mysterious guard took the mannequin with bare hands and carefully placed it inside the elevator. His movements were precise and methodical, as if he were familiar with the process. Once the mannequin was in place, the guard pressed the button marked "-4" without hesitation.  
  
   The elevator doors began to close slowly, and a sense of anxiety and anticipation filled the air. It was as if the guard knew what he was doing, but I was still tormented by the grotesque images and terrifying experiences I had lived through.  
  
   Finally, with a mechanical sound, the doors closed completely. I watched in silence as the elevator began to descend to floor -4. I didn't know what to expect or what effect leaving the mannequin there would have, but I had followed the rules, and the guard seemed to be following an incomprehensible pattern as well.  
  
As the elevator descended, the tension in the air grew. The lights on the elevator panel blinked occasionally, and it felt as if I were being drawn into a distorted reality. The shadows on the walls seemed to come to life, twisting and forming figures that defied logic.  
  
   Finally, the elevator stopped with a slight jolt. The doors began to open slowly, revealing a deep and penetrating darkness on floor -4. A gust of cold air blew from within, sending a shiver down my spine.  
  
   The mannequin lay on the floor of floor -4, motionless and silent. The mysterious guard was nowhere to be seen. A sense of unease persisted, as if I were on the threshold of something unfathomable.  
  
   Without taking my eyes off the elevator's interior, I pressed the button to close the doors. The process was slow and agonizing, and in that moment, I felt as if something was watching me from the darkness of floor -4. An inaudible whisper filled the air, as if distant voices were trying to communicate with me.  
  
   Finally, the doors closed completely, and the elevator began to ascend. Relief washed over me as I left behind floor -4 and its impenetrable darkness. The feeling of oppression gradually subsided, but I knew I could never forget what I had experienced.  
  
   Following the rules to the letter, the mysterious guard disappeared once the mannequin was placed inside the elevator and headed to floor -4. Although there was a sense of relief from no longer having to deal with his presence, the grotesque experiences and the rules themselves continued to fill my mind with unease.  
  
   After closing the elevator doors, I stepped away, avoiding looking directly at the mannequins in the stores as I walked down the hallway. The shopping center was engulfed in a chilling twilight as I turned off the lights one by one, following the instructions of rule 7.  
  
   However, as I continued my rounds, a disturbing thought took hold of me. I remembered that the mannequin I had taken to the elevator was in a display right in front of me when I arrived in this area. I avoided looking at the mannequins, but to my misfortune, I had forgotten to note which store it was in. A sense of anxiety began to grow within me.  
  
   My mind struggled to recall if I had properly followed rule 7 by turning off the lights, losing track of the order of light shutdowns and not remembering how I should turn them off correctly. My attention shifted to  
  
the dark area at the end of the hallway, an area I had intentionally avoided. However, I wasn't sure if I had already visited all the stores and fulfilled the rule.  
  
   The feeling of unease grew as my thoughts became entangled in a confusing mix of rules and pathways. My mind was divided between the need to follow the rules and the desire to escape the anxiety that was starting to overwhelm me.  
  
   Trying to regain my composure, I decided to retrace my steps and check the stores I had avoided. The shadows seemed to move strangely as I walked down the hallway, intensifying the feeling of unease. Finally, I reached the store where I remembered leaving the mannequin.  
  
   However, as I looked through the display window, I realized with horror that the mannequin was no longer there. My heart began to race, and anxiety turned into a visceral fear. I had made a mistake by forgetting to properly follow rule 7, and now I didn't know where the mannequin was.  
  
   Immediately, I wondered if the correct order of turning off the lights had an influence on what happened to the mannequins, and I remembered what the sinister voice had said, *"None of these people will leave here alive.*"  
  
The darkness seemed to close in around me as I tried to find clues about what had happened. The hallways and shadows seemed to move strangely, distorting my perception. My mind was in chaos as I tried to remember if I had turned off all the lights correctly.  
  
   The feeling that something was watching me from the shadows intensified, and the inaudible murmur seemed to increase in volume. My pulse quickened as paranoia took over me. I had lost control of the situation and the rules I was supposed to follow.  
  
   Amidst the confusion, the sound of the nearby opening elevator startled me. I turned towards it, only to be faced with the mannequin that I had taken to floor -4. Its hands, shaped like plastic daggers, seemed to be extending slightly forward, as if it was about to advance.  
  
   I couldn't believe it. Where was the guard? Why had it returned? Could it be that not properly turning off the lights had consequences?  
  
   I heard footsteps behind me and braced myself for the worst...
