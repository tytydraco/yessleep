The first day back to school after summer break is always a strange mix of excitement and dread. The smell of fresh textbooks, the glossy sheen of waxed floors, and the palpable anxiety hanging in the air made my stomach churn as I walked through the gates of Oakwood High. 

Little did I know this particular year would haunt me forever.

As I made my way through the corridor, I noticed a crowd gathered outside the classroom. My curiosity piqued, and I edged closer, my heart thumping louder in my chest. It wasn’t long before I saw her—the new substitute teacher.

She stood at the front of the room, tall and thin, her skin a shade too pale, almost translucent. Her stark white hair framed a gaunt face with eyes that shimmered unnervingly. Her flowing black dress seemed out of place, as if she had stepped from another time entirely.

“Class,” she began in a smooth, commanding voice, “I’m Ms. Alaric, and I’ll be your substitute teacher for the foreseeable future. It’s finally good to be back home after all these years”

 Her presence sent a shiver down my spine, though I couldn’t explain why. It was as if the room itself held its breath in her presence. Something was terribly off about her.

Oddly, everyone else seemed utterly enchanted by her—almost as if they were drawn to her in ways they couldn’t explain. There was a fragrant, mesmerizing scent that surrounded her, almost like jasmine, and people seemed to gravitate toward it without realizing. 

Except for me. The smell that intoxicated everyone else hit me like a wall of garlic, pungent and foul. Every time she passed by, I had to resist the urge to gag. No one else seemed to notice.

However, I have to admit, the first few weeks under Ms. Alaric felt like a dream. Her lessons were mesmerizing, almost hypnotic, and I found myself oddly captivated, unable to look away. 

But then, things started to change—slowly at first, like a ripple beneath the surface.

It began with my classmates. 

One by one, they transformed. Matt, the class clown who was always cracking jokes and stirring up trouble, suddenly became silent. He sat at his desk quietly, hunched over, scribbling frantically in his notebook. When I asked him what he was working on, his eyes glazed over, and he whispered, "It’s important, Ashley. You wouldn’t understand." He didn’t look up again.

Then there was Jessica, the sharp-witted overachiever who used to challenge every rule. She became disturbingly compliant, no longer questioning anything. In fact, she seemed to worship Ms. Alaric.

 “You’re just not seeing the bigger picture, Ash,” she’d tell me with a cryptic smile, her eyes glowing with unsettling adoration.

More students started acting strangely. Their behavior shifted in unnatural ways. I felt increasingly isolated, like I was the only person left who hadn’t... changed. 

And things got worse. Simple arguments soon turned into brutal fights. 

I watched in horror as a group of my classmates attacked Sam, a quiet kid, just because he disagreed with something Ms. Alaric said. 

Their faces were twisted with rage, fists flying, while Ms. Alaric stood back, watching with cold satisfaction. 

When the incident was brought to the principal, he barely reacted. The students were given detention, but no real action was taken. It was as if Ms. Alaric’s influence had extended to the entire school—students, teachers, even the janitor. Everyone seemed to fall under her spell, practically worshiping her as she strolled through the hallways. 

It felt like the whole school had fallen into her control, except for me. I was the only one still… who continue to be me. But why? Why wasn’t I affected like the others? I couldn’t figure it out.

As the days wore on, it wasn’t just their behavior that changed—it was their appearance too. My classmates began to look… wrong. Their skin grew pale and waxy, their eyes vacant and unnaturally wide. 

I remember catching Angela in the bathroom mirror. Her fingernails had become freakishly long, and her once-bright blue eyes bulged unnaturally. She looked more like a corpse than a living person. 

“Why are you staring, Ashley?” she asked me in a voice too sweet, as her nails began to scrape down her face. Blood streaked across her cheeks, but she didn’t stop. She just smiled.

I bolted from the restroom, my heart pounding away in my chest. 

But the real horror began a week later when students started disappearing from school, one by one.

It started with Ms. Alaric asking, “Who’s ready to volunteer for an exciting project after school hours?” 

Almost everyone raised their hand, but she chose Matt, who looked super thrilled. That was the last I ever saw of him—he didn’t show up the next day. 

And it happened again, the following week when another student would vanish, and no one seemed to care. Not their classmates, not even their parents. 

Matt’s family never filed a police report or even came to the school to ask about their only son’s disappearance.

I was the only one who found this disturbing. And it terrified me.

Determined to uncover the truth, I spent hours digging through old school records in the library. 

I remembered Ms. Alaric saying on the first day, “It’s good to be back in this school after so many years.” That meant she had to have been a student here once, or maybe even a teacher.

 I reasoned there must be records of her somewhere. This school was ancient, so I started poring through the yearbooks, which went back decades.

And then I found it. My skin prickled with goose bumps right away when I saw her picture.

In the 1986 yearbook, there was Ms. Alaric—only she hadn’t aged a day. She was standing among students, looking exactly the same as she does now. The same hairstyle, the same clothes. No sign of aging, not even after nearly 40 years.

What chilled me to the bone was the name under her picture. It wasn’t Ms. Alaric. It was Pamela.

Panicking, I tore the page from the yearbook, but just then, I heard a voice behind me, icy and calm.

“What are you doing, Ashley?” Ms. Alaric stood in the doorway, her expression unreadable.

I froze. My mouth opened, but no words came out.

“Curiosity can be dangerous,” she said softly, a sinister smile curling her lips.

I bolted from the room, not daring to look back. Her laughter echoed in my ears as I ran as if my life depended on it. 

I next went straight to the police station where my Uncle Henry worked as an officer. I showed him the evidence and tried to explain what had been happening. 

He listened patiently, but I could tell he was skeptical—until I showed him the page from the yearbook. When he ran a background check, he found out that Ms. Alaric, had gone missing in 1986. She disappeared during a trek in the Appalachian Mountains and was never heard from again. Armed with this new information, Uncle Henry promised to investigate further.

The next day, Uncle Henry arrived at the school with another officer. I watched from a distance as they questioned Ms. Alaric in the hallway. 

The conversation grew heated, and soon tempers began to fly.

Suddenly, my uncle removed his gun from his holster and shot his colleague point blank in the face.

 I gasped, frozen in stunned silence as I watched the officer’s body slowly crumple to the floor. 

Uncle Henry’s expression was blank, like he was under a spell, and he walked toward me, gun in hand, like I was now the enemy.

He grabbed my wrist and dragged me to where Ms. Alaric stood. The students gathered around, their vacant eyes fixed on me, waiting for her command. I’d never been so terrified in my life.

As I stood mere inches from her, the stench from her body hit me like a wave of rot. My head drooped as I tried to control my fear. 

Slowly, I raised my gaze to meet hers. Her eyes were locked on me, unblinking. “You don’t have to fight this, Ashley,” she whispered. “Look at everyone else—see how happy they are. You could have that too. Just let go.”

That’s when I felt it—the cool metal of the amulet pressing against my skin. 

My grandmother’s amulet. She had always said it was a talisman, passed down through our family of gypsies with great healing powers, a safeguard against evil - she would often tell me.

 I’d worn it for years, a simple piece of my heritage, never fully understanding its power until now. My fingers instinctively closed around it, gripping it tightly as if it were my last lifeline.

The moment I did, Ms. Alaric flinched. A look of discomfort passed across her face, her unnerving confidence faltering for the first time. Her eyes narrowed as she noticed the talisman. “What… what is that?” she hissed, her voice no longer soothing but sharp and angry.

I didn’t know why, but I squeezed the amulet harder, feeling its warmth against my palm. Ms. Alaric winced again, and I could see her fingers trembling as she clutched her head. 

She staggered back a step, as though an invisible force had struck her.

“You don’t control me,” I said, my voice growing bolder as I took a step forward. Her eyes widened with fear—a fear I hadn’t seen in her before. I ripped the necklace from my neck and brandished it in front of her, holding it up like a shield. 

Ms. Alaric recoiled, her once steady composure now crumbling.

“No!” she shrieked, her voice filled with a primal panic. 

She stumbled to the floor, her body writhing in agony as tendrils of black smoke began to seep from her skin. They twisted and writhed, as though something dark and ancient was being torn from her very essence. Her pale, ghostly form convulsed on the floor, and I could hear the sickening sound of her bones cracking.

The students behind her began to stir, their eyes blinking, coming back to themselves, as if waking from a terrible dream. 

Uncle Henry’s grip slackened, and he stumbled back in horror, realizing what he had done. Ms. Alaric’s body continued to thrash until, finally, with a piercing scream, she collapsed to the floor, lifeless. 

Her skin shrivelled and decayed, revealing the corpse of a woman who had clearly died decades ago.

The hallway fell eerily silent. The students, once entranced by her, now looked around in confusion, dazed and frightened. Uncle Henry dropped to his knees beside his colleague’s body, devastated by what he had done. His sobs echoed in the hall, a painful reminder of the horrors we had all endured.

The police later searched Ms. Alaric’s house. They uncovered fresh graves in the backyard, the bodies of the missing students—Matt, Jessica, and others—buried beneath the soil. The story made headlines, a macabre sensation in our small town, but no explanation could ever truly capture the evil we had faced.

I still have sleepless nights. Sometimes I wake, heart pounding, expecting to see Ms. Alaric standing in the corner of my room, her cold eyes fixed on me. But even in those moments of terror, I clutch my grandmother’s amulet and remind myself that it’s over. For now, at least, it’s over.
