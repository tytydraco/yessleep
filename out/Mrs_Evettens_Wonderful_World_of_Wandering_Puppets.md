When I was 6 years old I would attend a puppet show every single Friday night at 7 pm. The show was held by a mysterious old lady named Mrs. Evetten, at the local theatre where plays would be held. I heard about the show through a flyer I found posted in the city, which hosted a rag tag crew of puppets that I felt compelled to learn their story.  Mrs. Evetten had no helpers, yet somehow controlled and voiced all of the puppets. Whenever kids would ask how she did this, she simply told the kids that the puppets were alive, that she only needed to host the show and they did the rest. The shows were mainly wholesome, teaching kids good qualities and ethics, but every once in a while one of the puppets would seem to malfunction; they seemed to go off script and begin to target children in the crowd, asking them rather personal questions which would result in Mrs. Evetten interjecting. The puppets consisted of the leader (a man in a top hat), a cowgirl, a ballerina, a spaceman, a zombie, and a wizard, as well as random regular people puppets. The themed puppets served as the main cast, and almost every show ended the same, with a valuable lesson learned by one of the regular puppets, and us in the crowd. I attended these shows ritualistically, until the very last one.

Mrs. Evetten was nowhere in sight on the night of the final show, but the show started normally as her voice was heard setting the scene. On this particular night, the ‘man in the top hat’ puppet singled me out, during one of these bizarre malfunctions. He asked me my name, age, where I went to school; Mrs. Evetten no where to be seen, as she usually broke this chatter up and kept the show going. He then asked me to come onto the stage, something that shocked everyone as this has never happened before. As I traversed through the crowd to get onto the stage, the top hat puppet instructed me to enter backstage, and to come up to the front, but when I did so, the crowd before me faded out, now just empty chairs in my view. Suddenly puppets rose from the empty chairs, cheering and clapping as they watched me on stage. The top hat puppet then played out an act, where I was the lesson learner, but none of it made any sense. Quickly two police puppets arrested me, and took me back stage, and lead me into an all grey cinderblock room. I sat there for what seemed to be hours, until the door eventually popped open, staying ajar. I made my way out of the cold grey room, but what I discovered next absolutely haunts me to this day. 

The top hat puppet sat there, with a cold grey arm extending from his opening, but came from a body not in view. He went on to explain to me the rules of the show, that I would never see my family again, and tons of other dark cruel things I can’t seem to remember properly, but knew the things he was saying were horrible. He had me venturing through similar grey cinderblock rooms, showing me puppets in chains and cages, some even being tortured, and from every puppets opening stemmed a cold grey arm, bodies of said arms all swarmed in shadows. He showed me what happens if you don’t listen, if you break the rules of the show. He lead me into another cold room, where dozens of cold grey arms grabbed me in. Eventually I’d be rescued by real police officers, and I never got an explanation of these events other than I got lost. What’s even more weird, is that my parents and other towns folk never heard of Mrs. Evetten’s show. There were never Friday night puppet shows, and the night I went missing my parents told me I left the house during a bout of sleep walking, getting lost in an old abandoned theatre where I was finally found, spouting stories of this puppet show that never existed. 

I’m telling you all of this, as 20 years have passed since these events, but I’ve been experiencing things lately. I keep seeing puppets in everything, sometimes it’s a movie, other times a commercial. I even keep running into people in public who have a puppet with them…  this has happened more than once. Lastly, a few days ago I received a letter with no return address. It was the flyer I saw as a kid, the flyer that lead me to Mrs. Evetten’s Wonderful World of Wandering Puppets. With it, a note, addressed to me. It reads: “Hello old friend! We weren’t done you know? It took me some time, but I’ve found you. Please, come to the show this Friday so we can finish. You won’t want to miss it.” Today is Friday.
