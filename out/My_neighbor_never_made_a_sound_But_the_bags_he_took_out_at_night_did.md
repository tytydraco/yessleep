I never thought I’d write this down, but I need to get it out before it drives me insane. What happened wasn’t some ghost story or urban legend—it was real, brutal, and too close for comfort.

I live alone in a pretty quiet building. Nothing fancy, no big crowds or parties—just me and the usual humdrum life. There’s this one neighbor, an older guy. We barely talked, just polite nods in the hallway. He was the kind of person who kept to himself, always locked inside his apartment. Sometimes, I’d catch a glimpse of him staring out the window late at night, but he never said a word.

One night, I was up late working. Around 2 AM, I heard a weird scraping noise from his unit. Like metal dragged across the floor. At first, I thought it was some furniture moving or repairs, but it kept going, getting louder, more frantic. I tried ignoring it, but curiosity got the better of me.

I peeked through the peephole—his door was slightly cracked open. The scraping stopped. I was about to knock when a sharp, wet thud hit the floor inside. My heart froze. I could swear I heard a low, guttural groan—like someone struggling to breathe.

I called the building’s maintenance, told them what I heard, but they brushed it off. "Probably just him, he’s harmless," they said.

The next morning, I noticed something off. The hallway near his door smelled awful—like rotting meat mixed with chemicals. It was faint, but enough to make me gag.

I went to check the mailboxes downstairs. His key was stuck in the lock, like he’d left in a hurry or forgot. I reported it again, but no one did anything.

Days later, I finally had enough. I called the police anonymously and told them about the noises and the smell. When they forced the door open, what they found still haunts me.

His apartment was a nightmare. The walls were smeared with dried blood and strange symbols scratched into the plaster. In the corner, there was a makeshift table with tools that looked like they belonged in a horror movie—scalpels, saws, clamps—all stained dark red. On the floor, I won’t lie, were body parts. Human. I still can’t erase that image.

Turns out, he was kidnapping people—strangers, drifters—he kept them captive to "study" them. The victims’ remains were hidden in false compartments behind the walls. The scraping noise I heard? Him trying to move the bodies around in the dead of night.

The police said they found evidence he’d been doing this for years, covering it up perfectly. Nobody suspected a thing because he was so quiet, so invisible.

I can’t sleep in my apartment anymore. Every creak, every shadow, feels like he’s still here watching. The worst part? They never found his last victim. They think they’re still hidden somewhere inside those walls.

I don’t know how to explain it, but if you ever hear strange noises late at night, and it smells like death lingering in the air—don’t ignore it. Some monsters don’t scream or fight. They just sit quietly, waiting for their next move.

After the police stormed the place, the building emptied out fast. Most of the tenants left within a week. I stayed—I don’t know why. Maybe it was guilt. Maybe I wanted answers.

But the nightmares didn’t stop.

I’d wake up gasping, drenched in sweat, hearing that same metallic scraping echoing through the walls. Even after the unit was sealed off, I swore I heard movement—faint shuffling, like someone dragging their feet just behind the drywall.

One night, maybe three weeks later, I got drunk enough to knock on the sealed door. I laughed to myself. It was stupid. I turned around to head back—but then I heard it.

A voice. Hoarse, barely audible.

**"Help...please..."**

My blood ran cold. I pressed my ear to the door. Silence. Then again—**a weak knock** from inside.

I ran back to my apartment and just sat there shaking. I didn’t call the cops. I didn’t want them to think I was cracking up. But that night, I couldn’t sleep. Around 4 AM, I made a decision I regret every second now—I broke in.

I had a spare key from when I used to help him with his mail. I don’t know why I still had it, but I did. The cops had duct-taped the lock and bolted the door shut, but nothing a claw hammer couldn’t rip through.

The stench hit me like a punch. Rot, iron, chemicals, something...wrong. I covered my face and stepped inside. The crime scene tape still hung like streamers, but what caught my eye was the floor—fresh drag marks in the dust. Something, **or someone**, had been moved recently.

I followed them. They led to the bedroom closet.

That closet had a false back. The cops missed it.

Behind the plaster wall was a narrow crawlspace. Pitch black. The drag marks went inside.

I crawled in, phone flashlight in hand. It smelled worse in there—wet, warm, **alive**. The space opened into a small concrete room—unfinished and hidden deep between the walls. That's where I found her.

Or what was **left** of her.

A woman. Half-naked, wrists bound in wire, flesh shredded like she’d been carved piece by piece. Her left eye was missing. Her lips were sewn shut with thread that cut into her skin. She was still breathing—barely. She saw me and made a sound I can’t describe. Pain. Rage. Relief. I screamed for help and scrambled out, called emergency services with shaking hands.

She survived. They say barely. She'd been there **for at least a month.**

But here’s the twist—**she wasn’t the last victim. I was.**

Two nights later, I woke up on the floor of my own apartment.

The power was out. My door was locked from the inside. There were **pictures** taped to my walls—photos of me sleeping, brushing my teeth, showering. Hundreds. All taken from inside my apartment.

In one of them, I was wide-eyed, staring at the camera. I have no memory of that moment.

There was a note tucked under my bed, written in neat block letters:

"You should’ve left it alone. I was done. Now I’m not."

The police swept the place again. Nothing. No cameras, no fingerprints, no forced entry. They think it was some sick prank, maybe a copycat. But I know it was him.

He never left. He was watching the whole time. Maybe hiding in the walls. Maybe under the floorboards. Maybe right behind me.

I moved out the next day.

Sometimes, I still wake up with fresh scratches on my back. Deep, like nails—or a scalpel. Sometimes, I smell that metallic rot, even in a new city. Sometimes, I hear the dragging.

And every time, I wonder if he’s still playing.

Maybe next time, he won’t let me wake up.

I don’t know who else he’s watching. I don’t know if I’ll survive next time. But if you hear dragging sounds at night—*don’t open the door.*
