Transcript of radio broadcast dated June 5^(th), 2043:

<Crackling static, followed by high-pitched squeal.>

Voice 1: Does it still work, Alex?

Voice 2: It looks like. All lights green. I can't believe it, Mitch!

Voice 1: Neither can I. Hey wait, are we on air right now?

Voice 2: <Inaudible.>

<Audio cuts.>

<Audio resumes.>

Voice 1: Hello, hello everybody hearing the sound of my voice. My name is Mitchell and I will be your humble host this long, lonely night. I am currently broadcasting live to all of you from the edge of the Painted Hills. Before I explain the exact purpose of this little... Interruption, I want you all to meet my technical advisor, Adam. Say hello, Adam.

Voice 2: Hello, everyone.

Mitch: Perfect. Now. As some of you know, just about eighteen years ago, there was a supposed Geothermal event in this area that allegedly caused the evacuation of everyone from here in Kimberly, down into Vale and all the way West into Redmond. For some reason, however, there has been no official Governmental response either locally or Federally. People have been grieving lost loved ones. More have went missing, presumably to search for those lost, or at least their remains.

That brings me to why we are here. Myself and Adam, along with this trusty, kind of rusty, portable broadcast station are going to venture into the Quarantine Zone, and live, on-air, finally, after nearly two decades, expose the truth. But first, a short break while we load some necessary supplies and begin our journey.

<Audio cuts.>

<Audio resumes.>

<Low rumble and humming can be heard in background.>

Mitch: Good morning again, radioland. We are officially on the road south. My destination is the town of Vale itself. Veterans of the theories might already know why, but with brevity for those of you who don't AH -

<Unintelligible shouting.>

Sorry about that folks, hit a hell of a pothole. Anyway. As I was saying. Many believe that Vale itself was the start of whatever happened. We still have some miles, so I am going to get myself something to eat, and we will be back when we get outside of Civilization.

<Audio cuts. Regular programming resumes for nearly two hours.>

<Interruption of signal begins again.>

Mitch: We are back, humanity, and let me tell you something. It has been at least twenty minutes since we passed another vehicle in either direction or an occupied building. The structures seem to be mostly standing at this point. Seeing them is both comforting and a little bit sad. I'm just glad we brought enough fuel and water for a few days. I haven't seen so much as a bird in the sky since we crossed the boundary to the orange zone.

That's right, folks, we are officially out of bounds, just about twenty miles from the Quarantine Line. We are going to make our final planned stop, so I will catch you all in the morning. I don't think either of us will be sleeping much after this. Honestly, I just hope that we can get to the bottom of all of this. If it's as bad as the official reports suggested, then I am sure I will have to cut this short. I'm not out here trying to get us hurt.

<Audio cuts. Regular programming resumes for nearly seven hours.>

<Interruption resumes.>

Mitch: We are getting ready to head into the town of Vale, radioland. There is nothing outside these windows but old storefronts and rocks. Just like the birds, all of the local wildlife seems to have fled alongside the humans. I haven't seen so much as a dead skunk or jackrabbit, never mind a living insect. This place is so quiet when the motor isn't running. It's unsettling. I think I just saw the sign marking the Vale city limits. This place is unmoving, even if we are not.

It's almost time to set up our repeater here so that we can continue to bring you along during our investigation. I will say that the supposed sandstorms that dominate this region are remarkably absent so far. We're pulling into the ruins of the old motel now. I just hope that a couple of the rooms and the generators are solid. If so, we are going to start setting up our equipment and get some food before the sun sets. So far, there's nothing additional to report, so I will power down until the morning.

<Audio cuts. Regular programming resumes for forty-five minutes.>

<Audio resumes. A burst of static and then an echoing footstep.>

Alex: Hello radioland. This is Mitchell's trusty technician Alex, conducting our first... <garbled words and static> of the mobile equipment, and it all seems to be working, so I am going to hand the microphone back to our host.

<Shuffling and grunting, echoed, but unintelligible words.>

Mitch: Welcome back to the show, folks. It is three in the afternoon and hot here in the abandoned town of Vale. Still haven't experienced one sandstorm in our time here. I swear I heard an animal a while ago, but when I looked I couldn't spot it. I'm going to try to move further down main street and... <Interference.> Maybe I will find an answer in the old hospital. < The host begins moving, footsteps and heavy respiration intercutting his words. >

Mitch: This is so creepy. Most of the storefronts here are in decent shape, though clearly need paint and some other minor repairs. The air is fresh and clean. There are still clothes on racks and products on shelves. <The sound of Mitch's footsteps changes, the man clearly walking on a wooden surface.>

I wonder... < A faint clatter and then creaking can be heard. > The door was unlocked. I am currently inside the ruins of an gas station. This is the first damaged building I have seen, and even that could be simple neglect. It's stuffy and claustrophobic inside.. < Distortion, cut through with what sounds like overlapping broadcasts from throughout time. Old timey music. The roar of a crowd.> I didn't find anything unusual in the building. I probably shouldn't be surprised. It's pretty typical of an abandoned town, I guess.

The Post Office doors are standing open, almost as if they are inviting me inside, so I'm going to do just that... < Broadcast fades into silence for seven seconds. > Okay, for the first time, I am feeling something more than just disappointment. It looks like they cleared all of the equipment and mail out of here during the evacuation. This place feels like a mausoleum. The echoes don't help. I think I have had about < fade out > I can take.

I'm heading back to the base camp for the evening. Just because I don't feel like I am in danger, we all know that walking around in unfamiliar terrain after dark isn't wise. I'm signing off for the night, radioland. Sleep well.

<Audio cuts. Regular programming resumes for seven hours exactly.>

< Audio resumes. >

<Shuffling and grunting can be heard.>

Mitch: Good morning, everyone. We are ready to head further into the town to investigate some of the dwellings here in Vale. We are walking up a side street, and it's so strange. Cars in near perfect, untouched condition except for one half buried under a termite eaten carport here on the corner. Some of them are half packed with people's belongings and others are empty.

Alex: < Muffled, distant. > I found a place that looks decent if you want to follow me.

Mitch: I think we found a place. Bear with us for a moment please.

<There are a few moments of shuffling, grunting, and then some banging and clattering.>

Mitch: I thought you said the damn door was < grunt > unlocked. < Grunting and shuffling. > We are officially the first people to step foot into this home in at least eighteen years, and you can certainly tell. The bookshelves are coated in dust. Lots of old fantasy novels and various figurines and other decorative items. There are pictures of a family on the walls. They look nice, but most do from the outside.

I think we should split up. Alex, you stay down here, and I'll head upstairs.

Alex: <Muffled by distance.> Is that really a good idea? I mean we don't know how solid the floors up there are.

Mitch: I'll be fine, just keep your eyes and ears open for anything suspicious. < Faint sound of soles echoing on bare wood can be heard a moment later.> Okay, so let's see what we can find up here. It's a bit darker, but I don't think I need a flashlight. All of the doors lining the hall are closed. Kind of weird. < Rattling and creaking. > Looks like a bathroom. I'm tempted to look in the medicine cabinet, but to be honest, that still feels like an invasion of privacy. < The door closes. Fade out for nearly four seconds. >

The rest of the rooms up here are what I expected. Just bedrooms. I was hoping to find a lead at the post office. Maybe we should try the...

<A loud bang is heard, far away from the mic.>

Mitch: Al, was that you?

<For a moment there is dead air.>

Mitch: Alex!

<Alex's voice can barely be heard. Mitch starts to run, feet thundering down the stairs. There are a lingering few seconds of silence and then the host begins to laugh, there is some commotion and the voices fade into the distance, barely audible.>

Mitch: I'm back. Alex knocked over a dish hutch in the kitchen. The dishes inside are a lost cause. We are going to check out the garage and tomorrow, I am going to find a way into the courthouse. If I am going to find answers at all it will either be there or at the survey site. We'll be moving out of Vale in that direction tomorrow evening, and my plan is to take you all with us. We've planted a few repeaters already, and will continue to do so. I'm going to shut down for now, maybe hit some other houses, see if I can find running water.

<Audio cuts for nearly three hours.>

Alex: Hello, radioland. Mitch left me alone here at the motel while he ran for water. I thought I heard someone else outside the window a few minutes ago but when I looked, the parking lot was empty. I decided that maybe talking to you guys for a while might calm my nerves. So, here I am, hunched over the microphone in our dark, quiet room that we have designated as our base camp. I'm not sure if Mitchell gave the disclaimer or not, but we are not only dropping repeaters but signage along our route, just in case something happens.

Look for the bright orange arrows. <The sound of glass shattering in the distance can be heard, and Alex can be heard standing up and walking away from the microphone.> I think one of the windows on the room next door got broken somehow. <The man's voice is just barely audible, a moment later the door can be heard opening. A sudden buzzing rhythm fills the room, almost loud enough to be painful when listening to the recording.>

Alex: Cicadas? Or are those crickets? Ladies and gentlemen of radioland for the first time since we got near this place, I am hearing signs of life. <Just as quickly as it started, the sound stops. Just a few seconds later, Mitch can be heard re-entering the room. There is a hushed conversation too far from the microphone to be heard.>

<Audio cuts for forty-five minutes.>

< Audio Resumes. >

Mitch: I'm back folks, and you are not going to believe what I am going to say. This just got swarmed by the biggest herd of insects I have ever seen. I need a moment to collect my thoughts. We'll be right back.

<Audio cuts. Regular programming resumes for twenty minutes.>

<Audio resumes.>

Mitch: Welcome back to our investigation. As you all know I left Alex here at base camp, and I went to the courthouse as well as scavenging for fresh water. I found it. I also brought back some interesting forms that I found in one of the offices of the courthouse. Alex is looking through them right now, trying to sort out the relevant information. I will be back in the morning.

<Audio cuts. Regular programming resumes for eight hours.>

<Audio resumes.>

Mitch: Good morning, people of radioland. Alex has informed me that he doesn't think we should share our findings until we have solid answers, but being that I am the one who re-built and paid for our equipment, and fuel, and everything else thus far, have decided to tell you what we know. What we do know is that three weeks before the incident out here there was a research team digging out in the depths of the badlands, cutting into an uncharted piece of the fossil bed that seemed to suggest there might be a hot spring or possibly an undiscovered tar pit in the area. There are requests here for equipment and armed security as well as for an entomologist.

Some of the papers mention a camp near the drill site, so I think we are going to load up and head out there the afternoon. I already packed up the backpack transmitter. As for that buzzing sound. There was a massive cloud of every flying insects I have ever seen in my life that moved through the area, A line of all kinds of other things. Ants, beetles, scorpions and spiders. No larger animals, not even birds trying to take advantage of the massive swarm. I did see a rat a while later, but it didn't look healthy. To be honest, I am getting a little bit nervous.

I will be back on air after we get back on the road, probably just before we drop the repeater, or maybe after. I have to go help Alex get the rest of our crap loaded up. Talk to you soon, radioland.

<Audio cuts. End of reel one.>
