As I swung open the door to the emergency room, with panic in my eyes. My mind went back to work just half an hour ago.
…
It had started off as a normal day. Me getting up at 6am to get ready for work. My wife hadn’t been feeling all too well the last couple of days but it wasn’t too bad, she was still able to go to work. This morning however as I kissed her goodbye, she just let out a groan and. Kept her eyes closed, just telling me to leave her alone.

I had thought nothing of it as I left the house and went off to work. As usual, it was a boring drive to work, surprisingly the traffic was light and I had hit all green lights. So I made it to work a little earlier than usual. It put me in good spirits. 

I grabbed somebody bland office coffee and went to my desk and sat down. I was IT help desk  for a large corporation that will stay anonymous. As I put the head set on my head I heard the phone start to ring, my day officially starting.
….
I breathed in lungfuls of air as my eyes scanned around the emergency room, my mind im suddenly a blank. I briefly wasn’t sure what to do until my eyes landed on the emergency room front desk. 

I hurried over to the desk, my eyes filled with panic. Today had been going so good, why oh why had this been happening. When I reached the desk I placed my hands on top of it and looked at the brunet nurse behind the counter. 

I asked for my my wife, trying to keep the panic out of my voice but failing. A sad look came over the nurses face, telling me she had been brought in 2 hours ago. 

She picked up the phone and paged the emergency room doctor to come to the front desk
…
I pressed the end button on the computer, ending the phone call. I took off my headset and placed it on the table. 4 hours had passed since the start of my shift, the morning had just flown by. One call had come in after another, keeping me busy. 

Finally it was time for lunch! Management didn’t allow us to use our personal phone while we were working so I had stashed it in my pocket and hadn’t looked at it since I started my work day. 

As I stretched and got up out of my seat, I took out my phone and headed to the lunch room to grab some lunch…

**You have 20 missed calls.**

I froze in place, Lucy behind me nearly walking right into me. She complained, but I barely heard her. I looked and looked at my messages

7:30am Christina: I am having sever cramps. I can’t go into work today.

8:30am Christina: I am vomiting something might be wrong…

930am there is blood everywhere! Where are you Mike! 

Several calls and messages had been left on my phone, after going through them the last one was from the hospital saying Christina had been admitted and was currently in surgery and that he needed to come immediately.

This was an half an hour ago
…
I sat down in the waiting room chair, nearly hyperventilating at this point. It seemed like hours had passed since the nurse had called for the doctor. 

Finally I saw a doctor come into the waiting room, him asking for Mike. 

I sprang up to my feet and hurried over to him. Eagerly waiting to find out what was happening to Christina.

When I finally approached him he looked at me sadly and my heart dropped, I knew what he was going to say. 

I am sorry, he said. But your wife had a miscarriage. 

I was not one to get emotional, but when I had heard those words, my heart dropped, I nearly fell to the floor. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. We had tried to have a baby for years and when Christina announced she was pregnant we were both ecstatic. 

We had names already picked out for our baby girl. She was going to be name Abigail. The nursery had already been painted and decorated. Everything was set up, only 3 months left to go in the pregnancy.
…
I quickly told my boos that I had an emergency and that I needed to leave. I didn’t really hear his answer, and I really didn’t care. I ran out of the office and got to my car in record time. I started to car and sped out of the parking lot. 

I sped all the way to the hospital, calling my wife’s phone over and over again. Only getting her voicemail each and everytime, I am pretty sure I went through a couple of red lights and am surprised I wasn’t stopped for speeding. I just had the worst feeling in the pit of my stomach knowing that when I got to the hospital that the news was not going to be good. 

My tires screeched as I pulled up to the emergency room waiting area, turned off the engine and ran up to the doors of the hospital.
…
After i had finally calmed down enough, the doctor told me that she had just come out of the recovery room and was now resting in a regular room and that I was able to see her. 

The walk to the room was not very long, but with each step, time seemed to stretch, seconds seemed to take minutes, minutes seemed to take hours. When I finally reached the door, my hand hovered over the door handle. I could hear the sounds of weeping on the other side. 

I finally worked up the courage and opened the door. Christina’s back was towards me, and as I entered the room, she didn’t even turn to look at me. I approached the bed my hands hovering in the air above her body, unsure what to do next.
