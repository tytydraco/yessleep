Most stories you hear about the Vietnam War are biased; not from politics but of point of view. You see, only the winners get to tell the stories. They will tell you heroic tales on the battlefield. This is not one of those stories. I am writing this down so that someday someone will know the story I have been too afraid to tell even my own family.

  
When you think of the Vietnam War, most people see images of grainy, intense color video of soldiers fighting in the war. My story is not like that. I fought a different war in Vietnam. Most Americans don’t realize that there was not just a civil war between North and South but also inside Vietnam. President Kennedy had President Diem assassinated; there were other coups and counter coups. Even us gangsters were involved. Officially, anyone who was a part of the triad was technically a soldier. I never fought a Commie; I fought in the streets of Saigon. We were the Dragon Triad, and I was the second in command to the Leader. We were feared by our enemies, and people paid us for protection. The Leader just took on a new project, taking over the Cathay Casino.

  
It was owned by a small-time crew—the Jeweler. He emerged from jail, and in a few years, he had all the city’s officials wrapped around his finger. The Leader said that money can do a lot, but it can’t buy respect and honor. I organized my little brothers and took over the Cathay Casino at midnight. We wanted to keep the prize; we needed the customers and the casino in one piece. I set up my men and everything went smoothly.  We had muscled other triads before, the Jeweler was no match for us.

  
I set up the office.  The Boss wanted to make this his new headquarters.  This was part of the boss’s bigger plan to settle down.  He was going to set up a study room for his daughter.  I was in charge of her during the transition.  Everything was going to plan until that night.

  
I went to the Boss’s new office. I could overlook the whole operation there, witnessing the unique ambiance of the casino below. The live singers belted out the latest tunes, and American GIs, seeking respite from the war, drank and gambled away their last dollars during their R&R. The rich and the politicians reveled in the opulence of the casino, a stark contrast to the ongoing war outside. "No wonder the Jeweler loved this place so much."

  
“I still do love my place.”

  
The Jeweler strolled in casually, adorned in a suit and tie, cigarette smoke announcing his entrance. Questions swirled in my mind. How did he enter? Who had the audacity to walk in when the Dragons had just seized control? It wasn’t legal, but in the unwritten laws of the street, he should have known that such intrusion wasn't allowed. My hand reached for my gun, but before I could threaten him, my arm was paralyzed.

  
“I think it's time for your boss to get here; I have unfinished business with him.” In his hand, he held a cloth figurine. Upon closer inspection, it seemed as though someone had taken my photo and placed it on the doll. He held the figurine with the hand bent, compelling me to go to the phone and pick it up.

  
“Call him,” he ordered. I didn’t even question; I did as I was told. 

“The Jeweler is here; he needs to talk right away.” My thought process was warped, and my actions were instinctual.  But in the back of my mind I thought of the boss’s daughter.  One backward glance and I could see her just over my shoulder.  I had to protect her from this maniac.

  
“You are the soldier, I am the business man, hardly a maniac.”  

  
Shit not even my thoughts are safe.  Just then the Dragon boss came in.  He looked for his daughter and yelled at me for not protecting her.  She ran to him with a shiver.  She just knew her father was business man, he didn't know about his dark side.  His words meant nothing seeing the Jeweler able to control the situation and see the panic I couldn’t hide.  

The Jeweler summoned one of his employees as if nothing happened.  “Bring the Dragon Boss some cognac, that should calm his nerves.  Also make sure the little girl is entertained while we discuss business.  I want you to make sure that girl is taken care of.”  With that, the maître d' went on his way perfunctorily.

The Boss spoke up ,“Now that I see your face, I know you. You’re that kid that the police made eat the cockroach.  Then you learned black magic from Old Boon from Thailand in jail.”  


“You are more right than wrong.  I was that kid but now I am a man.  I learned the jewel business from Old Boon, but I don’t use black magic.  I use merits, right now you are in my debts, This is what we need to discuss.  Also, why don’t you sit also your boss may need your assistance” Just then I was able to move.  Up until that point I was faced down with my arm in the air, paralyzed.

  
“Be happy you’re seated your little brothers didn’t fair as well as you did.  I’m a business man let’s get down to business.  I built this casino as way to make money.  This is how I square my accounts, pay my debts.  Currently my finances are a mess, you have my casino.  With it I can’t run my jewelry operations.  You see, with the Cathay Casino money I can pay off officials to keep the jewelry business running.  You soldiers are wasteful, paying with blood and bullets are bad for business.”

  
“You know nothing of honor, what type of man doesn’t fight?”

  
“One who wants to live.  Your soldiers are no longer alive.  That is the cost you pay for taking what is mine.  What honor is in that?”

  
What I didn’t know then but know now is that bodies of our soldiers were mangled up.  With a flick of his little figurines the victims would suffer nefarious deaths.  Their faces told stories that their lips were never able to say.

  
“I am sorry for my actions as my little triad brother as witness I hand back all that I took from you.”  The Boss bowing to the Jeweler seemed to have no effect on him.

  
“I appreciate the gesture but your debts are not squared away.  Nothing would stop you from making sure I am not finished off when I am not watching.  Dragon leader, you have killed before with no remorse.  I was just a victim I cannot afford another chance.”

  
I knew the tactic the Jeweler was doing and it  was a cruel one.  You make the victim pick his own punishment.  We did this to the junior Triad members.  This keep people in line this way because unbridled fear is a better weapon than bullets.

  
“On behalf of the Dragon Triad I offer you our hostess bar in Section 5 and control of port in Section 4.”

  
“Dragon Boss that is very generous but that is not the collateral I was really looking for.  I don’t need control of these activities.  These vices are the ones that make the authorities upset.  If i get into the activities you do like killing and drugs are bad for my business.  but  I have the solution here.”

  
The Jeweler pulled out two additional blank figurines with Thai writing on them, He placed them on the palm of his left hand and the figurines stood by themselves.  In front of our eyes we saw the figurines take on two images.  The first one took the striking appearance of the boss.  And the second took the appearance of the daughter.

  
“I had more time to craft these I hope their appearance does you justice.”

  
“You leave my daughter out of it, you little…”

  
“Dragon Boss, negotiations are going well and almost finished.  It would be to your benefit for them to conclude  favorably.”

  
Just then the Boss clutched his heart.  However, much pain he was experiencing, he knew the situation could have been worse.

  
“This is my collateral, as long as you no longer threaten my interests, I will have no reason to use these.”

  
With that he placed the figurines in his breast pocket and pushed his cigarette into the ashtray. Business was complete.

  
The word of the street is that nothing happened.  We never talked about it to our men.  The Boss planned for the Cathay Casino to be his retirement, and he was right.  He took off for America right after this incident.  His daughter and family are safe.  When friends or acquaintances ask if I fought in the war, I don’t even bother  to answer. They think my silence is about some battle, some death I saw.  I saw pure evil manipulate me like puppet.  Not even my thoughts were safe.  I haven't even spoken to the Boss.  But sometimes I lie awake and  night wondering if the figurines will be used by the Jeweler again.
