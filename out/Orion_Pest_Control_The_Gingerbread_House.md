While I'm home dealing with pneumonia, I'm bored as all get out, so I think it'd be a good time to tell yinz about my first experience with the atypical. Sorry in advance if this update seems a bit short or disjointed. I blame the Nyquil. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U)

This story is partially secondhand. I was a little kid at the time, just six years old, so I only remember bits and pieces. For most of my life, I'd actually thought that I'd dreamt this until I casually brought up the ‘weird childhood dream’ to my Mom last Thanksgiving. 

She’d gotten a strange expression on her face, not saying anything until I pushed her. She asked me what I remembered. When I told her, she frowned, saying that I hadn't been dreaming. 

This happened roughly a week after the sperm donor shot up that gas station. Grandma was letting us stay with her for as long as we needed. 

Mom explained that back then, she had been in shock, not knowing how to go forward. Between the shooting, trying to get back into the workforce after years of being a stay-at-home mom, the harassment, and mentally unpacking all of the years of mistreatment she'd dealt with in her marriage, I honestly don't know how she did it. 

The only time I'd ever seen her break down was when she first got that phone call from the police. With the exception of that moment, she hid it all so well, but she must've been drowning. 

Grandma was a blessing, though. I vaguely remember spending more time with her, being whisked out to the garden whenever my mother would need time to herself. It was during this time that my Grandma told me stories about the Neighbors. How they love fresh cream and sweets. How they are helpful and kind sometimes, mischievous or even downright evil at others. For whatever reason, I was always extremely curious about the malicious Neighbors, even though those stories frightened me. Guess some things never change. Grandma actually had to talk me out of leaving cream for the Nuckelavee on the grounds that ‘maybe it'd be nice if it just got treated like the nice Neighbors?’

Yeah… that's not how it works. Listen, I was only six, okay? Six-year-olds aren't exactly beacons of wisdom. 

If yinz don't know what a Nuckelavee is, just know that it’s a particularly vicious Neighbor that has been known to destroy entire towns with minimal effort by bringing about epidemics and drought. Thankfully, their ideal habit is near the sea, so Orion shouldn't have to worry about it (not that we're equipped to deal with something like that, anyway.) At least, I hope not. Those of you who live in coastal regions should avoid the beach at night during the summer months, just to be safe. 

But anyways, on the day this incident ocurred, Grandma had to go to a doctor’s appointment, leaving Mom and I alone together. 

She and I were playing hide and seek in the garden. Something yinz need to understand is that Grandma's garden was the envy of everyone in her neighborhood. It stretched for acres, filled with stunning flowers in one section, homegrown veggies and herbs in the other. She never confirmed it, but I wouldn't be surprised if this delightful garden became as magical as it did without a little help from some of the kinder Neighbors that Grandma left cream out for. 

In essence, this garden was huge. Mom said that it had taken her almost five minutes to find me behind a particularly buxom cluster of orchids. When it became her turn to hide, she'd selected the rose bushes. Mom waited for a minute or two after she heard me run around a bit, then pretended to sneeze so I would have a hint. 

Imagine being so bad at hide and seek your mother feels the need to cheat. Embarrassing. I know I was only six, but, *good lord.* I must've been even worse than most six-year-olds because even with the fake sneeze, I never showed up. 

She heard singing then. It came from the field behind Grandma's house, the voice as scratchy and cold as dying leaves being crunched underfoot. At the time, she hadn't expected anything atypical, but hearing the song had terrified her nonetheless, thinking that some human intruder was making a move on her young child. 

Mom quietly followed it, something telling her that calling my name would be a *bad idea.* She couldn't see where I'd run off to, but she could hear that damned singing. She also remembered that the wind was howling, blowing in the same direction as the song. I have to wonder if my grandmother's Neighbors were guiding her. 

Once she crossed from the field into the treeline, Mom smelled sugar. Lots of it. She located a frosted, pink heart-shaped cookie on the ground. She'd thought that it had sprinkles on it until they squirmed. Maggots. Mom does even worse around worms and worm-like creatures than I do, which meant that she wasn't crying already, she was probably near tears after that discovery.  

As she followed the wind and the song, she saw more treats along the ground. Some had small teeth marks in them, like they'd been bitten into by children, then discarded. At this point, she'd thought it was still some run of the mill child predator, using sugary confections to lure her daughter into the forest. But what type of predator would take the time to bake and decorate this many cookies and cakes for just one child? And to leave them in a perfect path into the woods that could easily be traced? 

It was getting strange. The singing was growing louder. The smell of sugar and freshly baked goods was getting stronger. She'd said that this is the reason why she never ate sweets. After this experience, the smell of confections would immediately bring her back to the time she'd almost lost me. 

Mom eventually came upon a house made entirely of gingerbread. 

She couldn't believe what she was seeing. Was she going crazy? Had she finally snapped? Was this all just a bizarre, stress-induced nightmare? The wind grew louder, as if urging her to snap out of it.  

Peppermint stepping stones led up to the door, somewhat melted from the summer heat, bearing various footprints. Misshapen gumdrops and chocolate chips decorated the sides, the entire house lined with warped, white frosting. The entire structure buzzed with flies.

One of the gingerbread house's windows was open. Mom crept up to it despite everything within her telling her that the candy house was dangerous. Careful not to disturb the melting white frosting on the windowsill, she peeked inside. 

I was hunched over the kitchen table, head down with frosting and crumbs on my face, fast asleep with a pile of cookies in front of me. Meanwhile, the gingerbread house’s owner was bent over in front of an oversized oven. As the appliance's door squeaked open, the scent of cooking meat accompanied the smells of sugar. Mom couldn't see what was in the oven from around the swell of the homeowner’s back. It moved in odd, jerky motions, reminding her of the twitchiness of an insect. 

In an owlish motion, its head turned backwards as its song continued, grinning at me as I slept. It had the face of a skeleton, covered in bubbling melted wax that was meant to resemble skin. 

What's interesting is that in my ‘dream,’ the owner of the gingerbread house looked a lot like Grandma, just a bit taller and thinner with hair made of licorice whips. And her voice had been as sweet as the treats she'd fed me. The house had been warm and inviting, a sharp contrast from my mother's recollection, though I'm inclined to believe that what my mom had seen had been the truth.  

Mom ducked down out of sight, covering her mouth to keep herself quiet. She was wracking her brain, trying to figure out how to get to me without *that thing* catching her, too. 

What had Grandma told her about Neighbors like this? *They never stop craving.* Mom remembered that these old Neighbors are ravenous. It wouldn't pass up the opportunity to snag another meal, even if it already had one in its possession. 

Mom crawled to the back of the house. Using her fingernails, she dug at the gingerbread exterior, pulling out chunks of cookie and one of the gumdrops that decorated the walls. She tossed the gumdrop as far as she could. The wind changed direction, carrying it even farther than it would have flown normally. My mother said that she could've sworn that she heard a faint giggle carried along that powerful breeze. 

But she didn’t have time to focus on that. Mom ducked around the other side as the door opened. There was another childish laugh in the direction of where Mom had thrown the gumdrop. The owner of the gingerbread house followed it, moving in eager, hopping steps as it kept up its rasping song.  

Once the thing was far enough, Mom crept into the house through the open door. Something crunched under her foot. Bones. The chocolate tile floor was littered with small bones. As she picked me up, she made the mistake of looking at what the thing had pulled out of its oven. She told me that she had to bite her tongue to keep from screaming as she carried me out of the gingerbread house.  

As she told me this story, she admitted that for years afterwards, she'd had nightmares that I'd been the one in that oven. 

With blood in her mouth, Mom followed the trail of treats back to the field. There was an outraged cry from behind her as the owner of the gingerbread house discovered that it had been tricked. Mom began to run faster. 

A small voice in the wind urged her to hurry, assuring her that we'd be safe if we could get back to Grandma's garden. 

The shrill screeching got closer, much quicker than Mom had expected. How could something that emaciated move so fast? She held me closer, hiding my face in her shoulder in case I woke up from whatever spell that thing had put me under, not daring to look back out of fear that it would slow her down. 

Heat seared her back, making her sweat. She'd learn later that the thing had scratched her and that what she'd actually felt running down her spine had been blood. It had tried to grab the back of her shirt, but by some miracle, couldn't quite get the grip it needed. 

It let out another shriek of rage as she stumbled into the garden, its chase stopping the moment she passed the orchids. She kept going through the back door until she collapsed onto the carpet, holding me as she sobbed. 

Grandma apparently came home to find Mom still hugging me as I slept, too afraid to let me go out of fear that I'd disappear again. Grandma had to patch up my mom's injuries while she held on to me. I do vaguely remember waking up in her arms, both of them looking at me with tears in their eyes. Back then, I hadn't understood and thought that they were just upset that I'd slept for so long. 

After telling this story, Mom informed me that Grandma and one of her ‘friends from the garden’ had gone into the woods to find the house only to discover that it had vanished, along with the trail of maggot-infested treats. There was nothing left of it, not even a residual crumb. 

I wonder if the gingerbread house is still out there. It must be. Since hearing all of this, I've been keeping an eye out on any news of missing children. It hasn't appeared to have taken an interest in this area so far, but I imagine it's only a matter of time. Evil really seems to be drawn to Pennsylvania. 

Speaking of evil, the mechanic and I have come to an understanding. That is, if you can call ‘mutually assured destruction’ an understanding. Before I get into that, I have some brief updates on my coworkers in regards to this situation. 

When it comes to Victor and Reyna, they both have opted not to name him outright, at least for now. The boss knows that naming the Huntsman would bind them together once again, and after his servitude he wants to distance himself as much as possible. Completely understandable. 

After having the mechanic dig around in her head, Reyna similarly wants nothing to do with him. When he'd flipped through my mind, I had only seen small, but painful snapshots of my past. Meanwhile, he'd made her relive her most awful memories as if they were happening all over again, most likely to punish her for hiding the ledger. It did a number on her. 

On a tangentially related note, Reyna has begun to go to therapy, the experience making her realize that she can't avoid addressing her trauma anymore. While it's horrible that being tortured was the spark for this, I think it would be good for her overall. 

So for now, that leaves the mechanic as my sole responsibility. 

The prick dropped by my apartment unannounced the other day at the beginning of my week of recovery. 

He had the nerve to look me up and down and say, “You look like death warmed over.” 

Without thinking, I retorted, “Whose fault is that?” 

The grumpy old fucker next door pounded on the wall. Apparently, talking at a completely normal volume is too loud. 

The mechanic briefly side-eyed my neighbor's door in irritation, then met my gaze. Even though he couldn't get into my head with the hagstone, it still felt too vulnerable to maintain direct eye contact with him. I focused on his chest instead.

Sounding slightly impatient, he asked, “You gonna invite me in?”

Truthfully, I think I’d feel safer inviting Dracula in than him. But what I said was, “Now isn't the best time.”

The old bastard next to me stomped over and cracked open his door, griping about how he was trying to sleep and I had a lot of nerve inviting ‘strange men’ over at this time of night. It was 8pm. The sun hadn't even set yet. 

Unfortunately for him, he made the mistake of looking the mechanic in the eye. 

The mechanic’s smile was deceptively friendly, “We all know you ain't sleepin’, ol’ timer. But don't you worry, I won't tell your ex-wife as long as you leave us to our business, alright?”

The old man turned bright red and silently retreated back into his apartment, the door clicking shut. I don't know what the mechanic was referring to, but judging by the old geezer’s reaction, I’d love to keep it that way.  

Once we were alone, the mechanic raised an eyebrow at me, leaning against my door frame. “It ain't exactly private out here.”

“It's not much more private in here.” I replied in a hushed tone.

“He'll know better than to eavesdrop now.” With a smirk, he suddenly raised his voice, “Ain't that right, ol’ timer?”

Without saying a word, the old man stormed out, keys in hand, and darted to his car. The mechanic snickered as the nosy fucker departed. 

*Well, he's definitely going to bitch to my landlord tomorrow.*

“You seriously think I'm going to let you in after that?” I asked. 

While I didn't like the guy, the last thing I needed was more drama. 

Completely casually, the mechanic replied, “He thinks we're about to fuck and wanted to listen in. I did you a favor. You can return it by lettin’ me in.”

Cool. Wonderful. On that note, I'm also looking for a new apartment on account that my neighbor is a creep. Because I don't have enough on my plate. 

Disgusted and mortified, I broke the salt line just enough for him to get through, then moved to stand by where I had the fire poker propped against the wall. Even with the advantage of knowing his name, there's not a doubt in my mind that he's still dangerous. 

The mechanic made himself comfortable on my couch. He had apparently recovered from the shock of being identified, appearing almost as collected as he normally was. I say ‘almost’ because he looked at me differently than he used to. 

Before, he'd had this superiority about him, as if I should be grateful that he'd noticed me enough to want to devour me. Now, I could see that he truly despised me. I'd never had someone look at me with such pure hatred before. 

Not wanting to provoke him, I politely asked, “What did you want to discuss?”

“I wanna know where we stand,” He started. “Should I be ready to fly my happy ass back to Annwn? And can I count on you to not fuck with the Hunt's affairs?”

“You can stay. Your name will be one of Orion's secrets.” I assured him. “In return, all that I ask is that you and the other Hunters under your command don't interfere with Orion's duties. Does that sound fair to you?”

Something I should've clarified to yinz in my last update was that Iolo isn't his real name. In fact, Nessa isn't mine. His is some old Welsh name that only a few hundred people have today. But rest assured, if he ever crosses the line, yinz will see the real one. 

The smirk returned, “Gotta say, you've gotten brazen since I first met you, especially now. Can't decide if I love it or hate it.”

“I just want things to calm down. We both have work to attend to and this feud doesn't serve either of us.”

“Hm. Gotta disagree with you there, puppydog.” Iolo leaned back in his seat, crossing his legs to rest the ankle of one upon the knee of the other. “It serves me well enough. Harvesting the souls of the wicked and the weak is simple work. So simple it's mind-numbin’. Gotta rough ‘em up a bit just to keep things somewhat interesting, ya know? Least now, I got somethin’ to strive for.”

He then explained that he wasn't going to be as aggressive as he had been, given that he couldn't do anything about me at the moment. What I gleaned from that was that this wasn't over and it probably never would be. 

I voiced my thoughts aloud, “You're never really going to give up on taking my soul, are you?”

He smiled, “Afraid not, pup. Like I said the other day, you're stuck with me.”

In the past, mouthing off to him hasn't boded well for me. If I were smart, I'd learn my lesson and keep up the politeness permanently. However, when he said that with that fucking grin on his face, it really hit me that I was most likely never going to be free of this bastard. To top it off, I was emotionally and physically exhausted and the cause of that exhaustion was sitting on my fucking couch, right in front of me. 

I really should have known better than to get shitty with him, but it was like a dam had broken. I was *done.* “And you have to live with the knowledge that ‘some rat catcher from Pennsylvania,’ as you put it, was the one to name you. That's gotta be embarrassing.”

While that grin didn't disappear, I could tell that I'd hit a sore spot. “I think I made up my mind on whether I love or hate your new attitude.”

“Hate me all you want. You're stuck with me, too, and you have no one but yourself to blame for it.”

He said with a small laugh, “Oh, I'm well aware that it's my own damn fault that I ended up here. Shoulda just denied your offer and kept with what I was doing. It's definitely not a mistake I plan on repeating.”

“That sounds like a threat.”

“Nope, just a confession.” He replied mildly, eyes narrowed. 

I'd expected him to be more hostile after my outbursts. He was definitely annoyed, but not nearly as much as he had been in the past when I'd let him have it. Maybe he finally pulled that stick out of his ass. Doubtful, but one can dream.

He got up to leave, saying, “Most humans aren't worth hating. Generally speaking,  y’all just kinda blend together. You'd be the first exception I've found in a while.”

Oddly enough, I think that was supposed to be a compliment, but I'm not sure.  

After that unpleasant visit, I started looking into what could be done for the Weeper. 

How Weepers come into this world varies depending on region. Given that the one that helped me is the first to converse with an Orion employee beyond screaming, singing, or crying, we are unsure which accounts are the most accurate. Right now, I'm thinking that once I get well enough to meet with her again, the first step should be to ask her. It might give me a clue on how to proceed. 

I have a temporary idea of how to help her, but nothing permanent yet. Since I'm not sure if this temporary fix will even work, I won't describe it here just yet. No sense in elaborating on a potentially faulty method. 

I do warn yinz that one of the rituals regarding Weepers is strange, to put it lightly, and I’m a bit reluctant to post it. But apparently, this ritual has worked for some people, so… it merits at least some mention. 

In Scottish tales, Weepers were thought to be women who died during childbirth, dooming them to an afterlife of grieving until the day comes that her life would've ended normally. As such, some Scotsman got the brilliant idea to sneak up on a Weeper and suckle on her breast to trick her into thinking he was her lost baby. Yes, really. What's even worse is that this allegedly worked. The Weeper not only told him how to avoid his own death, but offered him a wish. 

I have *so many questions.* Who discovered this and why was *that* their first instinct? And most importantly *...why?* Just why? 

The Irish interpretation of Weepers is a bit different. They are said not to be the spirits of expecting mothers who passed before their time, but to be keening women who failed their duties, thus cursing them to spend an eternity atoning for it. For reference, keening women played a big role in ancient Irish funerary traditions, their vocalizations thought to protect the spirits of the dead until they could reach their final resting place. 

No matter which way you spin it, Weepers are thought to be cursed. Let's pray that the way she became trapped in that river was the Irish way. I'm bisexual and all, but getting up in the Weeper’s business like that without at least taking her to dinner first seems just *a bit* too forward. 

While we're on the subject of Weepers, I think it would also be good to tell yinz about one of the few calls we’ve had about them. This happened just last year and I'll preface this story by saying that this is, sadly, one of those calls that doesn't have a happy ending. 

Like I said in a previous post, Weepers generally aren't malevolent towards humans, however they can be dangerous if provoked. One of the ways that this can occur is if their laundering duties are interrupted. For this reason, if yinz ever happen upon a Weeper, don't try to take back any of the clothes that she's working on, even if it's your favorite garment. Even if it's designer. An angered Weeper is a force to be reckoned with. 

Banging and ear-splitting shrieks could be heard from the other end of the line as the client tried and failed to stay calm, “So, I saw some girl swimming around in the pond with a bunch of bloody clothes, including my brother's shirt that I got him for Christmas. I got freaked out and when she wasn't looking I just… took it! And now she's outside my house and I don't know what to do and…”

I kept my voice gentle, “Do you have a pair of iron tongs? Or anything else made of iron that you could use to reach out to her?”

“Um… I-I don't think so! Is the shirt the only thing she wants?”

“Yes, but in order to safely return it-”

The woman anxiously interrupted, “If I throw it out to her, will that stop this?”

“*No!* Ma’am it's not safe to reach out to her without iron, so please wait, and I’ll be right there! Line all of your doors and windows with salt and wait for me, alright? I'll be quick, I promise!”

She gave me her address. I hauled ass, managing to get there in less than ten minutes, though during the drive, I had the sense that it still didn't feel fast enough. 

When I arrived, I was horrified to discover that the client hadn't listened. 

The Weeper was nowhere in sight. A disembodied arm, detached messily from the elbow, sat on the front porch, palm up. 

I ran in to see that the client was still alive, but barely. Her eyes were vacant, face sweaty, skin a sickly shade of gray. I took off my jacket and tied it around what was left of her arm to stop the blood, then called 911. 

She died during the ambulance ride. Unfortunately, that wasn't the end of the tragedy. 

The client had mentioned that the Weeper had been washing not just her brother's shirt, but others. Even though we'd searched for the Weeper after the EMTs took the client away, we couldn't find the mournful Neighbor anywhere. The following day, the roof collapsed at one of the local churches, killing the congregation inside. The client's brother was in attendance. 

When I say what I'm about to say, I want to make it clear I'm not blaming the client for anything that happened. She'd been scared. She'd had no idea about anything that was going to happen. I just wish that she would've waited. She could still be alive right now. We could've learned about the collapse before it happened. Nobody had to die. 

I'm not sure if the Weeper that chased the client is the same Weeper that I'm working with. Considering that the one I know can't leave the river, I believe that this was a different one. So now I have to wonder, why was one of them capable of following the client to the suburbs while the other can only go as far as the river bank? 

In summary, there are just a lot of unanswered questions. Like I said, she is the only one to speak to us, so I have to wonder how many gaps there are in our records. Maybe she is different than other Weepers in some way. Or I just want to believe she's different. The only thing that I know for sure is that I can't develop a treatment plan until I learn about how she came to be trapped in that river. 

There is one other thing that I worry about when it comes to resolving her situation: the mechanic. It always goes back to him, doesn't it? 

The Weeper has already saved me from Iolo once before, so it won't be hard for him to narrow down who translated the ledger. So not only do I have to try to free her, I also have to make sure he doesn't try to retaliate against her in any way. She'd said herself that the Hunters can be just as cruel to other Neighbors as they are to humans. While Iolo didn't mention the Weeper during our impromptu meeting, I know that he hasn't forgotten about her. 

At the time of writing this, I'm getting to the end of that Z-Pak. My back and shoulders still ache, but it's faint. Slowly, but surely, I'm getting better. Once I get well enough, I can figure all of this out. Maybe. I'll try to figure it out, anyway. But in the meantime, a Nyquil nap is calling my [name](https://www.reddit.com/r/atypicalpests/s/kvnRWF2wFv). 

Update: [Shockingly enough, my first week back at work wasn't peaceful. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/CynRJlwopB)
