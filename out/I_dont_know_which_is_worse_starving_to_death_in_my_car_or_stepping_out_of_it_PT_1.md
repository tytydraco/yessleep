My name is Jack. This post is going to act as both a warning and a eulogy because I know that realistically I'm going to be dead in my car in a few days. I want at least one person to not go through what I've been through for the past... week? Days? I can't tell anymore; the fog never seems to rise or clear up.

I remember when this started. It was around the beginning of January, I think the 9th. I had already been on the road ever since mid December and I couldn't stop because it was my job.

I work as a reporter for the Daily Sun in my hometown in South Carolina, and my current piece has been roadside attractions across the United States. I thought it was a fluff-piece for filling out newspapers back when I got assigned it, and I still think the same thing now. I don't think the head of the department had something against me; it was probably just because I was one of the only people who actually had a license.

Rachel, my girlfriend, understood why I went even though she begged me to stay home, but money’s money.

My life had taken a dull routine. I drove from a small town to a small town, each one blending together after a while. Sometimes I stopped because I saw a billboard advertising a house that was upside down or the world's largest (blank). There were a lot of the world's largest versions of already existing objects; after a while it stopped being impressive. Woah, a large cashew. Fuck me.

I'd ask the proprietor some softball questions I had written down in my notebook before the start of the trip and take down their responses, and then I'd go back on the road for days on end. I either slept in motels or in my car if I couldn't get some money from my boss.

A lot of the roads had cracked tarmac, and during the night towns were illuminated via neon lights advertising bars and diners. Sometimes I went into the diners for a coffee to keep me awake while driving, but most of the time I just drank myself stupid and woke up in my motel room.

I think the low point of my trip came right before I made it into Hawthorne's Ridge. It was a black building on the side of a highway that seemed to stretch for hundreds of miles with nothing on each side except for grass, which was damp because of rainfall and snow melting.

(The billboard a few miles back was very colorful, so there was no way in hell I would've missed it.)

The interior was like a museum of sorts, each exhibit found by the fictional character "Crazy Larry" who wore all his clothes backwards. Most of the exhibits were obviously fake horseshit that would've been at home at a P.T. Barnum freak show.

Like a baby who somehow had the arms and legs of a fully grown man. Hell, one of the exhibits was just a shattered glass cage. There was a sign that said:

‘This creature I found in the mines earlier in my career; it’s completely blind because it spent its entire life underground and it hates the light. The current location of it is unknown... but maybe it's under your bed with a smiley face underneath it, as if to prove that it was just a joke. You wouldn't want to scare potential gift shop customers after all.

Around the end, there was a glass case that had an "alien" — obviously made of papier-mâché — who had supposedly crash-landed on earth while driving around in his flying saucer.

Normally, I would've been a little pissed at the owner because the sham cost a total of 15 bucks per person with a gift shop to boot, but I just felt numb when I gave him the questions I asked so many other people during the road trip.

“What inspired you to make this? Did it take long? Did you have help? What are some tips you have for inspiring entrepreneurs?”

I drove for an entire day and stopped when I reached Hawthorne's Ridge because my car had almost run out of gas. I didn't know it when I first entered it, but with the beautiful power of hindsight, I now know that I entered my final resting place.

I remember everything about my arrival. I keep playing it over and over again in my head for days on end, wishing I just took another direction. My next roadside attraction was supposedly the biggest toilet in America, and I figured I'd be able to cut time and get some gas if I went through Hawthorne's Ridge. Even though the towns blended together, it was better than the endless stretch of road surrounded by absolutely nothing but grass. The most excitement I had in days was seeing a long crack in the road which seemed to go on for a mile across the secondary roads. I wondered what had caused such a thing, ruling out rational ideas like wear-and-tear from cars constantly going over it.

When I entered the town, I was gliding along the roads in my car. On the radio, a man with a buttery voice was singing the question: "Baby, can you dig your man?" accompanied by a choir of women harmonizing the line "he's a righteous man!" This was followed by the man asking, "Tell me, baby, can you dig your man?" My backseat was a mess of empty fast food wrappers and boxes, and the passenger seat was taken up with filled notebooks from various interviews I’d held with attraction owners. A few minutes into the town, the radio suddenly turned to static, which drew my attention to the town itself. The overwhelming fog caused me to turn on my headlights. There was a surprising lack of trees. It just seemed like buildings went on forever, side-to-side, all the way to the exit.

I cruised through, searching for a gas station without much success. I saw a children's playground that was completely deserted. The playground equipment had lost all the vibrancy it once had. The slide was a washed-out red, and I could see parts where the paint had come off, leaving massive grey marks. I got out of my car and walked over toward the playground. It reminded me of home. My rose-colored glasses were very much on, remembering the playground from my hometown, with the sky a perfect blue, the grass a vibrant green, and the sun blaring down comfortably. Everything here, however, looked like a ghost town—as if everyone had packed up and left.

Looking back, this should’ve been a sign to turn tail. Not only because of hindsight but because the shoe prints on the sand floor were primarily adult-sized.

I finally found a Texaco station that had its own island isolated from the compacted buildings. By God, I was happy because I was honestly really tired of driving. I parked near a pump and walked toward a booth but stopped when I saw letters painted on the glass door. "Don't come in - Sit in the car and wait for service." Strange. I felt as though things like that were relics from the 1960s, nothing more than a leftover piece of the past. I also noticed a sign nailed into the wooden frame of the glass door: "OPENING TIMES, THURSDAY: 6:30 AM - 11 PM." I checked my phone: 90%, and saw that the time was 4 AM. I was surprised I had been driving for so long without getting tired, and it almost felt like getting reminded of it made me realize how exhausted I was. It was like realizing you're breathing and suddenly making it a manual effort instead of an automatic one.

With nothing else to do, I started walking back to my car. The late hour explained the lack of people walking around, although it wasn't completely desolate. I noticed a sign of life—a motorcycle lying down in a heap next to a gas pump. When I got back into the car, I looked over my notes again, a deep-seated habit I developed as a reporter, before resting my head against the dashboard and trying to sleep.

I woke up to a loud knock on my left. I jolted awake, always a light sleeper, and saw a mean-looking face staring at me. I remember he had long black hair, which practically looked like the mane of a lion, and a long beard to match. He wore a leather jacket that seemed too big for him, and his rings were constantly shifting on his fingers. I almost had a mini heart attack when I realized it was the owner of the Texaco and that I'd been loitering there for who knows how long. I checked my phone again, and it had gone down to 92%, now showing 5 AM. I thought maybe the sign was off, but that was odd, because it looked much newer compared to the rustic appearance of the station.

When I stepped out of the car, I was thoroughly intimidated by the man in the leather jacket, even though I was almost a head taller than him. There was something in his dark eyes that suggested a mix of both fury and paranoia, as they were constantly shifting and sizing me up. We stood in silence for a moment, the fog swirling around us. I reached into my pocket, pulled out a 10 and a 5-dollar bill, and hovered them in front of the man. Normally, I would’ve just handed him the money, but the fog made it difficult to see his body. I asked him to fill my car up, not bothering with the "please" because he scared the hell out of me when I woke up. But he just shook his head. He seemed to be particularly focused on my eyes when he finally spoke with a rough voice: “You ain’t one of them, are you?”

Before I could answer, the man ran a finger down my tie and muttered to himself, maybe with a bit of joy: “I’m not seeing things, that’s for sure.” I instinctively jumped backward when the man touched me out of fear, but I was only able to get a few inches before bumping into the side of my car. The old red Buick shook from my weight being put onto it, and I could feel a dull pain slowly building in my back.

I stared at the man, who was looking off into the distance. I kept thinking of worst-case scenarios, like him reaching into his pocket and sticking me with a switchblade knife. We stood there, what felt like hours, but I mustered up the courage to ask, "Wh.. What is wrong with you? One of them? What does that mean??" The man didn’t turn to me when I spoke, but he did respond. "One of them." He pointed diagonally, and at first, I couldn’t make anything out. But as my eyes adjusted to the fog, I saw a dark figure standing in what seemed to be the middle of the road. Its arms were planted firmly at its side, and I couldn’t see its chest or shoulders moving as if it wasn’t breathing. I thought the man had planted a mannequin there, but that raised more questions. I remember thinking dismally that I had just come across the town crazy when he finally turned to me and extended his hand. "My name’s Caine. You’re gonna be in for a shock when I tell you everything."

I didn’t know what to say but shook his hand out of politeness and introduced myself. He started walking, and I instinctively followed him, eyeing the motorcycle lying on its side next to a gas pump like a discarded corpse. I wondered why we weren’t driving it. I assumed it belonged to Caine because of his outfit. He looked like he belonged in a dive bar with similarly dressed men. There was even an emblem on the back of his jacket—a skull with its mouth ajar, and a green python baring its fangs coming from one of its empty eye sockets. Above it were faded letters: "The Hollow Sons." I asked Caine about it, and he said, "Yep, I’m the founder of the Hollow Sons. We were hella active over in Nevada." He glanced back at the motorcycle and added, "That’s mine, but I don’t think it’d be too safe driving around here... Not much medical attention going around, you feel me?"

As we walked, we passed the figure standing in the middle of the road. At first, I thought it was a mannequin because of its stillness, but when I got closer, it became clear that it was human. The man appeared to be in his mid-50s, balding, with a thick grey mustache on his upper lip. His skin was far from smooth and flawless like a mannequin’s; it was marked by blemishes and scratches. His eyes were unsettling—empty sockets with dusty marbles instead of eyeballs, staring straight ahead with a neutral expression.

Caine kept his head down as we walked past the still man, but I couldn’t help but keep my gaze on him for a moment. When I turned away, I had the eerie feeling that the man was staring right at me. I assumed he had turned around, but when I glanced back, he was in the exact same position I had left him. I tried to shake the feeling off, but as I walked on, I felt something watching me again. This time, I just decided to ignore it.

We arrived at a large building made of faded glass, with the words "Helen’s" written on top in red, light enough to be considered pink. I expected it to be a hospital, but upon entering, I was greeted by the familiar ding of a supermarket. There were only a few aisles, filled with essentials and non-name brand items. It reminded me of the ma-and-pa store I used to visit as a kid with my girlfriend, Rachel. We would beg our parents for money, and they’d oblige, as long as we bought them cigarettes. It was a different time, so the old woman behind the counter wouldn’t say anything about it.

Caine went to a shelf, grabbed a bag of oats, and began eating them dry. I stared at him, dumbfounded—not just by how he was eating the oats, but by the fact that nobody seemed to care. I looked around and saw there was no one behind the counter. A horrible odor of rot permeated the glass building. Caine noticed my confusion and tossed something at me. It was a can of processed peas. I was about to open it when I saw the expiration date stamped on the top of the can: EXP: 11/2/1954.

I looked up at Caine, expecting him to laugh it off as a joke, but instead, his face remained solemn and stony, just like when I first met him at the car. "No sense in beating around the bush," he said. "There’s something seriously wrong with this town." He paused, seemingly collecting his thoughts. "I think there’s something in it affecting the people. They show no reactions to me whatsoever. They just stand there, staring. If you get too close, they reach out and touch you, but they’re slow as hell, so it’s easy to dodge them. And I feel like something’s been wrong here for a while. The food’s been out of date for years, and the way people dress is weird. Some men and women wear suits and long dresses like it’s the 1950s—breadwinners and their doting housewives. Just the other day, I saw a woman in a training bra and leggings with an AirPod in her ear. They all look like they’re from different time periods, but they all share the same blank stare and stillness. It’s like they’re statues."

I shook my head in disbelief. I felt like I was in a daze, mostly because of how tired I was. I noticed the dark bags under my eyes and the stubble across my face, which was dangerously close to becoming a beard in the reflection of the supermarket glass. The more I listened to Caine talk about the town filled with "statue people" stuck in time, while eating dry oats, the more I realized that he wasn’t someone to be intimidated by. If my father had seen me docilely listening to this bona-fide freak, he would’ve smacked me upside the head and told me to "use my head for once." Looking back, I feel stupid. I actually told Caine to his face that he was probably just drunk and to leave me alone. If I had left Helen’s after that, I probably wouldn’t be able to type this post now.

"Did you see anyone about?" Caine suddenly asked. His eyes were locked on me, and I felt uncomfortable. It wasn’t like the stare of the man from the road. There was red-hot passion behind Caine’s dark eyes. It felt like the question was one of the most serious things imaginable. "No," I replied, trying to stay calm. "But last time I checked, it was only around 5 AM. Do you normally see people at—"

I started to get frustrated, feeling like I was talking to a child who kept asking stupid questions. "Why the hell am I even arguing with you?! You’re probably just some junkie making stuff up to scare me. I’m a reporter, I know how to spot BS. If you wanted an interview, you could’ve just asked me directly—"

I turned back toward the automatic door but stopped dead in my tracks when I saw a woman with greying hair in a bright sundress standing just inside. Her eyes were locked straight ahead, right through me, and her mouth was agape. I could see blackness—like there was nothing behind her lips. I assumed she was an employee or the store owner, but she just stood there, frozen in place. I didn’t see her exhale, but the glass fogged around her mouth, and I turned back to Caine, who looked pleased. It seemed he was enjoying my discomfort, probably because I was positively shitting myself at the sight of her.

“Let’s say we wait here for a few hours. If the usual people come in; people buying groceries and such, you are right. I’m just a right old loon. If nobody comes, you're gonna have to trust me on this one.”
There was a smirk underneath his thick black beard, which was already starting to grey around the edges. He knew he was going to be proven right after all. He took a wooden crate that likely stored food from a bygone era and patted it, indicating for me to sit on it as he sat on his own crate. I did so because I wanted to make distance between myself and the woman, even though she was outside.
We sat in silence for a few minutes before Caine began to speak. He asked me about myself; he said it with a rapidness that must’ve come from weeks of isolation. Weeks of isolation in a town filled with those things.


I told him about the fluff piece I was working on about roadside attractions. He hung onto every word I said and nodded his head. When I complained about missing Rachel and how tedious the work was, he asked me:
“Why did you not just say no? Ask someone else to do it?”
There wasn’t any condescension in his tone of voice when he spoke, like he had come up with the obvious solution I was too stupid to realize. It was a genuine question brought on by investment and curiosity.
I remember what I said.
“I took the job because of Rachel. We’ve known each other since we were…” I paused, making it seem like I was trying to recollect how long we’d been in each other’s lives even though it was engraved in my memory. “Since we were 8. My dad and her dad worked in the same office, and we lived on the same street, so they organized a playdate because we were both pretty shy back then.” Just talking about it brought back warm memories; a smile grew across my face without me even knowing.


“We spent every waking moment together. We watched the same movies, played in the creek behind our house, and we even attended the same elementary school.”
I reached into my pocket and lit a cigarette. I offered Caine one, and he shook his head.
“Keep on going.”
Thinking about Rachel was stressful, so the cigarette was definitely doing a good job at calming me down. I continued.
“Everything changed when her dad got a promotion when we were 12, and she had to move. We didn’t really have any way of talking, so we thought it was the last time she’d ever talk to me. She said goodbye and kissed me; I only saw her as a friend up until that point, but that kiss made me realize just how much I liked her. She was perfect.”
I felt uncomfortable, stood up, and looked out the glass walls. The woman was still standing there, but now her face and hands were pressed directly against the glass. Drool was running down it. Her dusty marble eyes were focused directly on us. I wanted to exit the conversation by using the excuse of “checking outside,” but that was no longer an option.


Caine must’ve sensed my discomfort because he said softly:
“Listen, if you don’t want to say it, you don’t have to. I was just trying to make conversation to pass the time.”
I felt as if telling him had become more of an obligation at that point because I had gone so far, so I decided to keep going.
“I moved on. Rachel probably moved on as well. We met in college 12 years later; I was taking a course in journalism and she was doing economics. When I heard the lecturer call out her name, I remember springing up and looking across the room… And I recognized her almost instantly. She really was beautiful, Caine. Still is. I approached her after the class, and she was shocked to see me, but she seemed happy. We got to talking over coffee; she had just gotten out of a relationship. I saw this as an opportunity and asked for a second date under the guise of going for a drink. We kissed on the third date and were officially a couple on the fourth.”


I looked at Caine. His arms were crossed, but there was a wide smile across his face as he said:
“Ain’t you a real Romeo and Juliet.”
I laughed at his comment. Laughing was good. It distracted me from the part that was coming next, albeit momentarily.
“We dated for years. I was planning on asking her to marry me right about now; her birthday is today… But a few weeks back, she said she was pregnant. I told her that it was amazing, but deep down, I was terrified. My dad was a real piece of work; he always got on my ass about things. He barely said good things about me, either to my face or behind my back. He cheated on my mom when I was 20 with some girl who was barely older than me; now he’s like some shadow looming over the family during dinners.”
I sighed. I was embarrassed because I was telling what was practically a complete stranger some of my deepest secrets. I guess it was because I was keeping them locked in me during the entirety of the roadside attraction report. I took it to get away from Rachel and my unborn baby because I was worried about ending up exactly like my father.


He stared at me. I could sense judging, and I felt even worse about telling him, but he just nodded his head.
“I tried to run away from my life as well. That’s why I’m here in the first place.”
I sat back down on the crate and looked at him intently. I told him to tell me more. He spoke solemnly:
“I was the man of the house. My dad ran away when I was only 2, so I never knew anything about him, but that didn’t stop aunts and uncles from telling me I was the spitting image of him. My mother miscarried; another boy, so I was practically the light of her life. Even though I’ve always been the dumbest in class, she never scolded me. No sir.”
He reached to his left—where the shelf of non-perishables was. He took down a bottle of vodka, uncapped it, and took a hearty swig from it. He reached his hand out and offered me a sip, and I accepted. I already had a drinking habit ever since I turned 21, but the road trip made it 10 times worse. The feel of the liquid warming my throat felt so comforting.


“I dropped out when I was 16. I got a job at the lumberyard and saved up to buy my own bike…” His eyes glittered. “It’s the same bike lying over there at the gas station. I drove around the desert plains without a care in the world, a lot of my friends from high school already loved motorcycles, so when we could all afford bikes, we drove together. After a while, we were practically a gang, hence—” He turned around to show me the Hollow Sons emblem on the back of his leather jacket.
“It was great at first. We just rode around and rode… But then some upcoming politician came to me specifically. He was campaigning for state senator, and he wanted ‘hired muscle’ for his rallies. He offered a lot of money for a few of us to just stand by him and push away people who got too close to him. One time, a person pulled a knife, and I beat the shit out of him. There wasn’t a better feeling…”
He coughed. His dark eyes weren’t looking at me, instead, they were trained on the ground. His hands interlocked together, and he appeared smaller because he leaned forward.


“And then he asked us to do some more. He wanted us to ‘teach people,’ which was basically just a fancy way of saying roughing up his competition. I felt terrible doing it because they did nothing wrong, but what was I meant to do? Turn down money? But then… He told me to kill someone. It was some older politician who was ahead of him in the polls. I remember sneaking in all easy-like because he lived in one of the nicer neighborhoods, so the doors were unlocked. I was looking down at him, sleeping, and I couldn’t bring myself to do it. All I could think of was how that was someone’s son. Someone’s uncle. Maybe even someone’s father. I stepped backwards, ready to just leave, but there was a loud floorboard and he woke up. It was like we had some type of staring contest. It ended when his wife woke up and she ran for a phone.”


“She saw the emblem on the back of my jacket, so it was very easy for them to find out who I was. In just a few days, my face was all over town, and my gang hated me. I didn’t want to get arrested, so I just rode out of town. Out of Nevada. I kept on driving without knowing where I was even going. I just kept on going east until I ended up here.”


He drank the vodka again. I couldn’t tell if his eyes starting to redden was because of the alcohol or because he was stifling back tears. You may think it’s unrealistic for us to tell such stories upon only meeting a few hours ago, but please remember the situation we were in. We were practically some of the only conscious things in that town, he was ungodly lonely and we were both going through our own shit. I think, deep down, what we both wanted at that point was emotional connection from anyone. I got off the crate and placed a hand on his shoulder. I was never the most intimate person, so it was all that I could think of. I said “I understand how you feel, man. We all carry sins, it doesn’t matter the size. All that matters is that we make it through them.” The truth was I did understand how he felt. We were both running from things, and now that we were in Hawthorne’s Ridge we couldn’t run anymore. He smiled at me.

Hours passed and we started to joke around, talking about past experiences, when I checked my phone. It was somehow 4pm. I told Caine and looked around for the woman who was standing at the glass, she was nowhere to be seen. I told Caine I was going to look outside and he tossed me his flashlight because of the fog being “A real bitch to see through.” I went through the automatic doors, greeted by the familiar ding, and looked around me. Across from me was a line of storefronts with a vintage quality to them because of the faded signage, and to my left and right was a sidewalk and more buildings stuck side-by-side. Tucked in the middle of the buildings was a rough road with badly cracked tarmac. And there was nobody in sight. No cars passing by, nobody walking past or into the store. I shined my flashlight in various different directions and the only sign of life was the same bald man from earlier who was still standing in the middle road, staring at nothing and completely still. I felt sick to my stomach. Caine was right. I re-entered the store backwards because I had the paranoid thought of someone or something running up from behind me and hurting me somehow.

Caine must’ve seen the look on my face because he discarded his empty vodka bottle which shattered on the ground and he approached me. “Do you believe me now, Jack?” “...Wh.. Where is everyone..?” “All over the place. They usually change spots when I’m not looking.” “What the hell is wrong with that man on the road? Or that woman who was staring at me through the glass?” “Follow me, I’ll tell you on the way to the hotel.” He took his flashlight back and led the way North. I followed him.

“..So how long have you been here for?” He turned his head to look at me, as if asking such a question opened up a deep wound. His response was very matter-of-fact, not bothering with any additions to keep a conversation going. “3 weeks. I’ve been surviving entirely off of non-perishables and they’ve been running out quickly. I used to be a fat piece of shit-” That explained why his clothes looked so large on him and why the rings on his fingers were so loose. His leather jacket swayed from side to side with each step, the emblem of the skull seeming to stare directly at me. He reached into his pocket, took out a brown wallet and opened it. He flashed a picture of himself at me. In the picture I recognised his long black and beard, without any interruptions of grey, and Caine looked way larger. He was standing next to an old woman with curly white hair whom I assumed was her mother. Comparing the Caine from the past to the Caine to now was like night and day. His physique was skeletal.

We walked in silence. I had so many questions flooding in about the town, I was thinking to myself on how I could ask them without just spitting out a word vomit of tangentially related questions. Suddenly he spoke. “You saved my life, you know..” My eyes perked up when he said that. I was about to ask how so when he continued. “I got sloppy. I was walking down the street and I didn’t recognise him; the bald man from earlier. He touched me. It was like… I was a mug, and him touching me caused the porcelain to crack around the bottom. All of my memories, emotions, thoughts, they slowly left my head. Everything was going black. The only reason it stopped was because the thing touching me lost focus when you came driving in…” He stopped and turned to face me. “I think everyone else here wasn’t as lucky. There were no distractions from them; instead everything about them was drained. Leaving just empty husks.” The story seemed to explain whatever was happening, but I still had questions.

“But if everyone here is hollow, how do they move? How do they even touch people?” “I think there’s something controlling their empty bodies. When things were fading to black I kept on seeing this.. Thing. It had multiple of everything; eyes, arms, legs, all compacted into one large pale blob. I’m guessing that it eats a person’s.. Soul? Essence? And then it puppets the empty body around.” I said nothing. The more we walked on, the more terrified I felt because of hindsight. I was close to one of those hollow people, and apparently I was close to becoming one if I let it touch me?? The air was cool and there was a damp smell all over the town, but despite that I could feel myself sweating profusely. We walked past the empty playground and I was reminded of Rachel and the baby, so I began to walk a little bit faster.


We arrived at the hotel, although it looked more like a cabin from the outside because it was made entirely of wood. Caine entered and walked straight against the left side of the wall. I found out it was because on the right was a check-in desk, and behind it was another hollow person. This one looked like someone from one of the spaghetti westerns I used to watch as a kid because he had a curly moustache, glasses, and a waistcoat.

I walked up creaky wooden stairs and was greeted by three rooms. Two of the doors were shut, and one was fully open. I saw Caine in the room closest to the left and entered, walking over the shag-green carpet. The room was small. There were two single beds on opposite ends, and I could see a separate room attached, leading to a bathroom. I was standing in the doorway when Caine looked up at me.

“Lock the door, Jack.” I looked behind me and saw the door had a chain bolt. I slid it shut and closed the door. I walked around the small room and was shocked when I glimpsed inside the bathroom. Inside was an entire armoury’s worth of guns, a few red cans of gasoline, and a singular rope. I looked over at Caine, who was lounging on the left bed.

“...Yep, you’ve found what I’m gonna use to kill myself with if I don’t get out of here soon.” He chuckled at his own dark joke but stopped when I didn’t respond. “When I came here three weeks ago, all this stuff was already in the bathroom. I’m guessing somebody else was in our exact situation, and now they’ve been turned hollow… It’s a real shame, man.”

I walked over to the free bed, sat on the edge, and leaned my elbows on my knees, looking directly at Caine. “What’s stopping us from just leaving?”

Caine looked at me. “Do you think I didn’t try that? I tried riding my bike out of here on the very first day. It’s like I was on a treadmill. No matter how much I drove, the exit seemed to get farther and farther. Eventually, it was like a circle, because I just ended up here again. It’s like there was something underneath the ground shifting.”

“So we’re just stuck here,” I said. The words hung heavy. The hope I had of leaving seemed to dissipate quickly.

“You don’t know that. I tried with a motorcycle, but maybe it’d be different with a car. Your car.” He stretched on the bed and looked up at the ceiling.

“Let’s try and drive out of here tomorrow, okay? I’m tired as hell right now, and I’m guessing you are too based on those bags under your eyes.”

He was right. I was having trouble keeping my eyes open. I laid down on the bed and closed my eyes. Before I could drift off, I vaguely heard Caine telling me goodnight, and I think I weakly told him the same.

I woke up to pure darkness. There was a part of me that wished the whole experience was just one long nightmare after I had too much to drink or ate too much fast food, but when I turned to my side, I saw Caine sleeping peacefully in his own single bed. I reached for my phone and saw it was 2 am. I wondered why I had woken up in the first place, but that was answered by the sound filling my ears.

They were subtle at first, but after a while, I picked up on creaking. They weren’t just the sounds of an old house; they sounded deliberate, as if a person was walking around. I tried to ignore them, closed my eyes, and tried to force sleep, but I was too stressed out by the creaking. It stopped after a certain point, and I remember my breathing becoming less tense before picking up again when the knocking began at the door. It was slow.

I looked at Caine again, and he was still fast asleep. I got up silently and walked toward the door, the slow knocking being the only thing I could hear. I stood at the door for half an hour; the knocking never ceased. I was trying to build up the courage to open it, hoping it was just a normal person subconsciously making me want to open the door.

I grasped the golden doorknob and twisted it. Because of the chain bolt, the door only opened a few inches, but I could still see the person behind it. She had fair skin and black hair tied up into a bun. She was wearing a casual blouse and shorts. The pupils of her eyes were expanded beyond her irises, leaving only dark windows which I could see my reflection in. The whites of her eyes were misty, much like the fog outside.

She slowly reached her arm through the gap in the door and tried to touch me, but I instinctively moved backwards. She kept reaching regardless. I went to wake up Caine when the woman spoke.

Her voice was way too deep and had a fuzzy static quality to it. There was an even deeper voice that followed the original voice, like an echo or maybe the puppetmaster who was giving her voice in the first place. When the hollow woman spoke, she didn’t move her mouth. Instead, the sound just came from her open mouth, as if there was a radio at the back of her throat. The voice was raspy as it said:

“Come… Outside… Jack… Please… We want you… Both of you…”

I said nothing, just backed away in terror. After a few moments, a guttural moan came from the woman as she began to undo the chain bolt. In a panic, I shouted Caine’s name, who stirred awake and was clearly confused. He looked at me, and I wordlessly pointed at the door desperately because I could barely speak.

He finally understood what was happening when the door swung open, and the woman began to slowly walk in. Even her movements were unnatural, like a puppet on a string being guided along a stage. In one swift motion, Caine leapt from his bed, got a shotgun from the bathroom, loaded it, walked over toward the woman, and hit her with the butt of the gun barrel. She fell down on her back, and Caine walked past her.

Before she could get up, he shot her face, which was obliterated by the shotgun. Her head had transformed into a mess of blood, fractured skull, and brain matter. The blank eyes were somehow still staring at me, even when the woman’s head had been blown off. The blood was beginning to stain the green carpet purple as he walked back into the room, shut the door, and locked it.

I began to splutter, terrified because I had never seen a person actually die up until that point. I screamed at Caine:

“What the FUCK! YOU JUST KILLED SOMEONE, I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU COULDN’T!”

I had fallen down and was leaning against the foot of my bed, staring at the door. Caine walked over toward me and slapped my face, hard.

“That thing isn’t human anymore, remember? The creature that’s behind this town’s corruption drained all the residents and passerby of their lives. I just killed a puppet. Nothing else. If I did nothing, we would’ve been turned in our sleep.”

Caine got back into bed.

“Go back to sleep, Jack. We’ve got a big day ahead tomorrow.”

Despite his reasons for shooting the woman, I could hear the unease in Caine’s voice. I got into my bed feeling light, and my sleep was fragmented. Memories of the woman’s head disappearing in an explosion of blood and viscera kept coming back to me.

As I write this post now in my car, I can feel my hands shaking and my eyes beginning to become heavy. I feel weak. I haven’t eaten in days, I think weeks. I’m able to feel my ribcage right now, and my clothes feel too heavy on me. I’m going to post what happened the next day when I wake up; that may be tomorrow, that may be in a few days. I can’t tell. I feel too weak and tired.
