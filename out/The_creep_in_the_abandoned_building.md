This happened a few days back, I went out drinking with a friend but for some reason this night I was wired to say the least, I had way to much energy so I dipped out after a few I wanted to go explore and see something different, experience something different away from the boring normality.

As I was walking home I knew that there was an abandoned mill on the way and I plucked up the courage to go inside.

As I entered the old wood floors creeked loudly and echoed through the old decripid building, I took my phone out and switched on the torch, 50% battery, can't stay too long *whispered through my brain*

As the room lit up the age of the building began to show, the wallpaper peeling off at the top and draped down, the old wooden floor cracked and dirty from the ages, the windows smashed and cracked by people wholobbed stones at them for fun but the whole atmosphere felt heavy like it was pulling on my shoulders.

Even though there were a few warning signs my drunken mind told me everything was ok your just overreacting go deeper and explore.

I proceeded further into the building as I walked around I began to feel enthralled by the history of the building wondering what it must have been like back in the 1960s bustling with activity.

I went room to room just enjoying my little adventure, I managed to make it to the sixth floor of the building but the seventh was inaccessible due to corrosion and time taking the stairs.

As I approached the last room I thought I heard a bustling sound of something moving but being drunk I shrugged it off and continued forwards until I peered around the door frame and saw him in the corner, an old man sat in the corner, disheveled, unwashed and obviously homeless it wasn't until he shifted his body weight because of my torch that alerted me to the facthe was eating another person, raw.

As he turned around his face and hands were covered in fresh blood and he just smiled "more food for me!"

My adrenaline kicked in I turned and started running, I ran down the corridor and jumped the hurdles, I ran as fast as I could as I could hear him just behind me cackling and grunting the words "more food, more food, more food for me"

After about 5 minutes of running like hell I was finally on the ground floor I hearded towards the door I ran outside and down the street, I only stopped due to hearing a loud "lucky fuck" at that point I called the police and they turned up around 15 minutes later at this point due to being drunk and tired I decided to go home as soon as my head hit my pillow I was out.

The next day I woke up and turned on the news, that's when I saw him, his mugshot was a dirty old, deshelved man with a huge grin that tore into my soul, he was sentenced to life but the news stated that he may have escaped on the way to prison due to some inept guards.
