Back in the day, me and my friend Marcus went camping around the world. We had money saved, no wife or kids to go home to and it was always a shared passion to travel. For two weeks, we stayed in a forest, solely surviving on our own materials and things on the land, everything was going good and there were no problems with anything. It almost seemed too perfect.
The second day, me and Marcus were fishing in a large pond. I caught this weird looking fish, it looked like it was rotting, it smelled horrible and had various types of bugs living off of it but was still swimming like it was perfectly fine.
Marcus had a disgusted look as he took it from the hook, tossing it back in the water. We continued fishing and actually caught a good amount of fish, that we later ate for lunch and dinner.

On the third day, Marcus didn't feel good. He must have caught a stomach bug as he used the bathroom and threw up pretty frequently. I gave him some Tylenol and he said he was fine for the rest of the day. The longer time went on though, he kept getting worse. More pale, more sick, but he insisted we stay, in his own words "a little stomach bug doesn't make me a bitch".
I begrudgingly stayed at the camp spot, and the next morning he didn't wake up at the time we normally did, didn't answer when I yelled for him so I opened his tent door and seen him chewing and pulling at the skin on his forearm. He already made progress, bleeding heavily and a strip of skin peeled back to reveal the layer under.

"Dude, what the fuck?!"

I shouted at him, I was alarmed, confused, even scared. He looked back at me with these wide eyes, anger and confusion written on them.

"Do you not see this!? I've felt crawling on me for days. Like a million bugs. Scratching doesn't work anymore, man!"

He pointed to his arm like there was something there. I grabbed his wrist and looked for myself. 

"Theres nothing there! Come on, were taking you to the hospital."

He yanked his arm away from me, shoving me and shouting about how we needed to stay here the full two weeks. It's only been a week so far. Hed always been persistent, having the flu before and insisted we'd finish the trip but he'd never get aggressive about it. It was always playful banter and if it was that bad we'd pack up and go. I dont know what happened to him.
Another two days went by, five more days until we could go home. He refused to give me his car keys and kept them on him with a constant iron grip. His skin started getting weaker, any cut he got was an hours worth of persistent bleeding until it fell off. By now, he hasn't talked in twenty four hours.

I started getting weary around him. Half the time I didn't see him outside of the tent. It was six in the afternoon, on a Wednesday and that day he walked out of his tent. He looked like a walking decomposed body, he smelled horrible and his eyes were dark and not really looking at anything. Something told me he was dead, even if I could see him walking infront of me. I would have been checking on him more but I think I didn't cook my hamburgers enough and had gotten food poisoning. I checked my phone, had no service. Not a single bar to go off of. 

I was scanning him as he stalked past me, his jaw looked worse than the rest of his body like he had grown a beard in two days because of the black mass that was on it. It wasn't rot, it was moving, wriggling.
That's when I realized, those were bugs. If I looked close enough every open wound he had they were in. Tiny, almost microscopic. 

With this food poisoning that has been kicking my ass, and my friend in dire need of medical condition I went in the tent and seen his car keys. With every intent to drag him into the car and go to the closest hospital, I grabbed them and headed to find him. 
Hed made it pretty far in the minute that I was gone, and thinking about it now I wish I would have just left him there.

He was standing at the pond, a hunting knife in hand. I watched him bend back, his stomach practically in the air, then he carved. Shoving the blade in his stomach and dragging it across, I was frozen. I couldn't do anything. My legs told me t run, stop him somehow but I was paralyzed. I watched his intestines hit the grass then out they poured, hundreds, maybe thousands of insects. All of them it the ground or fell back in that pond, regardless, they all went to the pond. And after the last one came out of his stomach, he collapsed on the ground, still breathing this horrid and strangled breath. He was in pain for days, we had no medical equipment even close to tending to this injury. My hands shook as I took my pistol from it's holster, I thought we'd be shooting beer cans off our table, I never carry my gun.  

I walked up to him, slow and agonizing steps and told him I was sorry before shooting him twice in the head. That's when his twitching and gurgled breaths stopped.
I feel guilty to this day, I drove home in his car after I packed our things. I parked it at his house and walked a good mile back to my own, and didn't say a thing to anybody. 
I must have got into some poison ivy on the trip, I keep itching but it's not helping the feeling. My arms have been getting cut up, but I'll probably go insane if I can't have one moment without feeling it. Ever since Marcus died, I haven't been out much. Its summer and there's bugs everywhere, I can't stand looking at any of them.

It's finally hit the two weeks mark, me and Marcus would be going home by now. I feel so weak since he died I keep vomiting, my stomach feels like hell and I swear I see at least three dozen tiny bumps in my arms and if I look close enough, it looks like their moving. I'm not sure what to do, but for some reason I feel like going back to a pond. Something is telling my brain I crave the water.

Well, sorry for dumping this on everyone. I'm not sure what to do. The bugs started feeling nice, like there's always someone there even when I'm at my loneliness. Thats the last time I'll ever go camping in a forest close to a nuclear power plant, the exposure must have made me sick.
