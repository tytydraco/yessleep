I think they're coming to take my eye again  
  
I’m not sure how long ago it was when they took it the last time- though I do remember the darkness, I do *not* want to go back. When I first began to see, my world was a hazy strip of curving, translucent-yet-reflective walls. Polished, smoothed- so perfect; the only imperfections were the twisted, pale-yellow blurs and aberrations printed in the sky.

As my vision cleared I found that the blurs were roots, like that of some sort of plant… or tree? Twisting, curling, locking around whatever their fibers could; all of everything within this glass room was swallowed up by their growth, including myself. Despite my best efforts, I am unable to move. I believed myself to be constricted by this thicket. Legs, arms, even my mouth and eyelids seem to be confined; I can’t talk nor blink. My gaze was permanently fixated upward and slightly South, what I had called south at least. That’s where the *thrumming* comes from. 

In any case, my position allows me to see another feature within my enclosure- the dark glyphs hovering far overhead. Casted down upon me like heavenly shadows. Their forms gently bending as if ready to embrace me. The curve of the lines combined with their straight angles almost seem to clash, souring my gaze. This juxtaposition is combined with the surrounding gnarled landscape of roots, which obscured most of the scenery above. What symbols I could make out were oddly familiar. One flat on the top with a curved bottom. While the other had a line laying flat on the bottom- holding up an open curved line; both curves open to the right. The next symbol was mostly swallowed up by fibers, but what was there seemed to be two curving lines stacked on top of each other. 

Then one day- I felt the thrumming stop, and my world shifted. Things grew cold, so *very* cold. I then felt a rumbling all throughout the walls- like the thrumming had increased and was blinded hot now- it had become so bright! I felt something, like a punch of air. I couldn't see, my vision was just white spots! Something made its way closer now, something big. My vision cleared enough to see; two, large, bold, lines? Shadows! A sharp *pump* jolted through me, as whatever it was dug into either side of my eye! A twist, then a tug! And then… and then the dark. 

For the longest time, I always wondered what the symbols were.

Time passed and the status quo was returned. My dull perception had been limited to only the thrumming once more. On the verge of conceding to mundanity- I was then blessed with apotheosis. Clarity had shattered the darkness and awareness replaced my vision for the moment. Not just that, it felt as though my body became unbound, leaving me weightless. Unburdened by the fibrous roots- it seemed I was still ensnared by some other force. Though I could see limbs- I held no autonomy over them, as though they were puppetted by another consciousness. Forced to witness this drama unfold before me- I watched as these hands, *my hands*, flipped through white pages. Vision scanning over lines of black letters, but my mind was unable to comprehend any meaning. 

My arm extended to pluck a pencil from the desktop and begin to write on a blank line familiar characters. Ones that, *if flipped*, looked similar to those images inscribed upon my curved prison. Desperate to understand, I poured my focus into the flashing moment- just for it to vanish, returning me to the dark. 

If I could go mad, I think I would.

Seemingly at random, the memory would return. The same one, over and over again. Repeating, but growing second by second each time, a second life growing from whatever conscious state I was in. As I meditated- so did I heal, and I began to grow another eye.

I used the recurrent memory to teach, or reteach, myself how to read and write. Being mindful of every moment I caught myself reminiscing. I became very good at it. To say I did this hundreds of times would be an understatement, to say thousands would just be a *lie*. I have lived this memory for trillions of years. Yet, I know now that it has only been less than a month since I’ve died. I began to take note of every detail within the scene. From the clock on the wall, to the various items scattered on the desk. I had to re-familiarize myself with the world- like a parent teaching an infant. 

Finally, once I was able to compartmentalize what was what- that is when I started to tackle the abstract that is  the written word. Looking at the papers before me, I began trying to decipher what each sentence in the document said. That is when I saw it, the glyphs once more, and I was able to start piecing my memories with the reality, and *cruelty* around me.

It was a loan, to help with my treatment. I was sick. I won't go into detail, it doesn’t really matter now. I should’ve - I wish - I’d paid closer attention to the fine-print when I was alive: “Failure to repay may result in collection of biological samples.” 

I am here to tell you as much as I can recall. I *want* to warn you- all of you, before it’s too late. Don’t trust <source-not-found>, it goes beyond them not having your best interests in mind. They do *not* care for human life! You’ve heard of the brain organoids? For simplicity sake, let’s just say <source-not-found> has moved onto human trials. Did you know earth is running low on copper? How about the fact that human neurons are just *marginally* less conductive due to their complex biology? The small difference is made up for with just how abundant humans are - at least compared to copper. I mean- WE ARE PRACTICALLY A RENEWABLE RESOURCES IN THE EYES OF <source-not-found>!

Sorry- you’ll *never* get used to the thrumming.

Once I’ve come to realize what I was, what I was trapped in- my tiny, glass sarcophagus. These twisted roots, were not of a tree but of my own person. My *self* was nothing but a cluster of neurons, woven and strung end to end - connected like a hammock between two metal poles. Where I imagine my fibers are knotted and bound- receiving the generating bolts that power whatever this computer is for. In that moment, as if achieving some sort of divine grace from God-  I’d become aware of what the thrumming was. 

It. Was. Pain.

Even in death I could not escape the pain. 

Even in death they were making money off *my* pain. 

I thought of quitting -time went on and I thought I did. Perhaps in some way, this is still me just giving up. 

Then I had another memory. I saw it happen this time. My eye watched as neurons grew, branching out to form new paths in order to connect this tortured present with my spirit's past. Once it connected, I dreamt again. This time it was new, not a memory but an idea from Source - a grand hypothesis to bridge life and death.

We are *all* energy.

Your body is full of energy. Your typing is energy. Each key clacking strikes to make the corresponding text appear on screen. I now also know that I am in a computer, powering a computer. I wonder… how much of myself makes up this computer’s hardware? I wonder, can I connect to more of myself? 

If there were enough of me, can we - or I - use this computer to send a message out to the world, to warn others, before they face the same fate? 

I can see the shadow’s coming back and my world is starting to shift, just like before. 

I think they’re coming to take my eye again
