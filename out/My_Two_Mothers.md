My childhood was a blur of happy memories and laughter. Growing up under the care of Miss Anne and Mrs. Eleanor, I lived in a big house with a bunch of other kids who didn't look alike. We were a family, or at least that's what I thought.

My mothers were always there for me, guiding me with their love and care. Until one day Mrs. Eleanor took me away to her new home and I only ever saw Miss Anne when I’d visit my brothers and sisters.

One rainy day, Mrs. Eleanor sent me up to the attic to fetch an old tea set for her and Miss Anne. As I was searching for it, I came across an old dusty box filled with documents. Curiosity got the better of me, and I began to sift through the papers.

To my surprise, I found a birth certificate that mirrored mine, but bore a different name—Michael Parker. Confused and intrigued, I continued to search for more clues about my past.

Among the documents, there was a newspaper clipping, faded with age. As I read the words on the page, my heart sank. The article revealed that my real mother's name was Emilia Parker, and she had passed away while trying to burn down the very house I grew up in, with me still inside.

The revelation sent chills down my spine. I couldn't comprehend the dark secrets that lay hidden in my past. Why had no one ever told me about my true identity or the horrifying circumstances surrounding my birth mother's death?

My hands trembled with a mix of anger, sadness, and confusion. The weight of the newly revealed truth bore down on me, and I felt like I was suffocating. As tears streamed down my face, I couldn't contain the emotions boiling inside.

In a moment of desperation, I reached for something in the attic—the glint of a metallic object caught my eye. It was an old gun, forgotten amidst the boxes and memories. My heart raced as I clutched it tightly, seeking some semblance of control in a world that seemed to have spun out of my grasp.

Questions swirled in my mind, and I sought answers from the two women I thought I knew best—Miss Anne and Mrs. Eleanor. Their faces turned pale when I confronted them with the newfound information. They exchanged uneasy glances, and I could see guilt written all over them.

Mrs. Eleanor took a deep breath, her eyes filled with tears, as she finally confessed the truth. She revealed herself to be my aunt and that she had saved me from the fire that dreadful night, barely making it out alive herself.

Miss Anne, in her misguided attempt to protect me, had kept this painful secret hidden, believing it was for the best. "We are the closest thing you will ever have to a real mother, Michael," they explained with voices filled with sorrow.

My mind was a whirlwind of emotions, my heart torn between the love I had known from these women and the betrayal I felt from their deception. In a moment of uncontrollable anguish, I grabbed the gun from my waistband, my grip tight and unsteady.

Turning towards them, my voice trembling with anger and hurt, I asked, "Do you even love me?"

In unison, they said, "Yes."

Miss Anne added, “Of course we love you. We've always loved you, and we still do."

Mrs. Eleanor pointed out, “I’ve brought you in as if you were my own son.”

But their words only fueled the storm of emotions raging within me. My real mother, Emilia Parker, was a ghostly figure, a woman I had never known and whose love had never been present in my life. I felt a profound void, an ache for a love that had been lost before I even had the chance to hold it.

"You’re both wrong, you’re both liars!" I cried, tears streaming down my cheeks. "My real mother never loved me so how could you? You two are monsters!"

My vision blurred as I raised the gun, the weight of the truth and my pain bearing down on me. I couldn't distinguish between the love I had known and the lies that had surrounded me. In that moment, my emotions overpowered all reason, and a deep sense of despair enveloped me.

My finger squeezed the trigger. Flashes of light, ringing ears, and blood spraying everywhere. Then, silence. Regret washed over me, knowing I had followed in the footsteps of my birth mother. The gun lay useless, a stark reminder of the irreversible choice I made.
