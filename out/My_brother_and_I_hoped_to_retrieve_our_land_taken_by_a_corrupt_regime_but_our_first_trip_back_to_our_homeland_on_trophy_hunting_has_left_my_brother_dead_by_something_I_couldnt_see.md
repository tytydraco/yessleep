I was standing next to my brother at the door, waiting for our important guest to arrive. The air was tense as the deputy prime minister, Strong, entered the room. He sat down on the velvet chairs with a smooth movement, his perfect suit and a smug smile making him look powerful.

He came closer to us and said as if he was doing us a favour. "Good morning," he said, his voice full of arrogance. "I have news that the new government coalition has decided to fix a past wrong."

I didn't say anything, but my brother, Clyde, looked out the window as Strong's black car with the government flag parked on the grass. The NUP, who used to be heroes, had become tyrants, taking away our farm, our history, and our life.

Strong opened a folder and took out some papers that meant more than they looked. "Your original land titles," he said, giving them to Clyde. The papers had the names of our ancestors, with official stamps and signatures from presidents.

"These are yours. You can have your land back," Strong repeated. I felt my anger change into a careful hope.

&#x200B;

As I was feeling confused, Strong told us something else. "We have a program for controlling the rhino population. Right now, there are too many and maybe some new trophies could make you like us more."

I was shocked by what he said, but Clyde was happy right away. He got up from his chair and wanted to shake Strong's hand, forgetting what they had done for a moment. After all, our family had been the first to find the rhinos.

&#x200B;

"Do you think we will forget everything?", I asked

"No, it's been said that this place is haunted, and nobody wants it.", Strong said with a sneer.

&#x200B;

Clyde looked at me and hoped I would agree. I felt many things—anger, disgust, fear, temptation, curiosity, and a hidden sense of pride.

Clyde dismissed my concerns. "We've never been there. It's foolish to presume we understand the situation," he countered confidently.

As we strolled, Clyde showcased the artifacts our family had preserved since our forced exile, over to slouched frame of Strong. The centrepiece was the preserved skull white rhino my grandfather had hunted—the supposed last remnant of the species.

I decided to join Clyde on the expedition, only to protect him from the chance something would happen, as we explored the mysterious family estate that he had inherited. But as soon as we landed in the remote wilderness, I felt something was off. The guide who greeted us, Eric, was a short and ugly man who spoke with a strange accent. He said he would take us to the manor, which was still in good condition. I didn't trust him at all.

We followed him through the dense bush, but I noticed that he kept looking around nervously. He seemed to be afraid of something. I sniffed the air, trying to catch any scent that might explain his behaviour. But all I smelled was the damp earth, the trees, and the wild animal dungs.

Then we reached a clearing, where the manor stood. It was a large and imposing building, made of stone and rosewood. It looked old and dark, but also majestic and elegant. I could see why my master was excited to see it. He said it was his family's legacy.

But as we approached the gate, I heard a low growl from behind us. I turned around and saw the huge dog that had remained along us, turn bare its teeth and snarl towards a clearing beside us. Eric screamed and hoped to calm his dog, trying to scare it off. But it didn't flinch. It lunged at us and for a moment stood in midair before yelping in pain, as it fell violently onto the ground. Eric soon ran over to the dog, and grabbed it as he escorted us quickly over to the Manor.

“Is it rabid? It looked like it went crazy.”, Clyde mentioned.

“No, no…I apologise, but I might not be able to join you tomorrow for the hunt.”, The guide mentioned.

I attempted to get more about it, but the guide hurried off as soon as he opened the cranky front door, and had expressed a gratitude we returned. The house was a mess of disorder furniture and water stains on the windows. I noticed some of the wooden furniture was warped and cracked, as if someone had spilled water on it by accident.

“This looks good.”, Clyde explained.

I felt a surge of guilt as we left the house before dawn. I had been forced to carry my father’s shotgun and had our guns ready and our eyes peeled for any sign of anything alive. Clyde said he looked over the land on google earth and knew the area well, as he led us to a ridge that he said was full of game. We followed him through a dense patch of veldt, where the thorny branches scratched our arms and legs. When we came out on the other side, we saw a vast field of wild grass, waving gently in the breeze. As we walked into the open, we heard a loud rustling noise to our right, not far from where we were. We looked over and saw the bushes shaking violently, as if something was struggling inside them.

&#x200B;

"'Maybe we should start with something smaller, like whatever hiding in that bush,' Clyde said. “I wish I had brought a larger rifle.”

“Maybe we should wait for the guide to return. We don’t know where that white rhino is anyway.”, I explained.

Clyde, who had stopped and was intently watching the agitated grass, said nothing, but had cocked both barrels of the dated family heirloom, and was holding it in readiness to aim. I thought he had gotten overly excited like a little boy in a morbid game.

"What are you aiming at?”, I asked.

He seemed to sense my confusion, and he whispered in a low voice: 'Something’s wrong.’

On instinct I laughed, as I momentarily felt a surge of panic, and I looked around frantically, trying to spot any sign of the creature. But there was nothing, nothing but the silent veldt and the eerie movement of the grass. How could we fight something we couldn't see? How could we escape something that could track us without a sound?

I could not take my eyes off the moving grass, as if they were drawn by some invisible force. I felt a cold sweat on my forehead, and a shiver ran through my spine. I gripped my rifle tightly, ready to fire at any moment. But what was I aiming at?

I heard Clyde curse under his breath, and I followed his gaze. The grass were now closer to us, only a few yards away. They were bending and flattening as if something heavy was passing over them. Something that was coming straight for us.

&#x200B;

'Get ready!' Clyde shouted, raising his rifle. 'It's here!'

&#x200B;

I felt a sudden blow to my back, and I fell to the ground, losing my grip on my gun. I barely had time to register what was happening when I heard Clyde's agonized scream, mixed with other sounds that made my blood run cold. They were animalistic, ferocious, like a pack of wolves tearing into their prey. I felt a chill down my spine.

I got up as fast as I could and looked at where Clyde had been standing. The sight that met my eyes was something I wish I could erase from my memory. He was about thirty yards away, on his knees, his head tilted back at an unnatural angle, his hat gone, his hair dishevelled, and his body jerking violently in all directions. His right arm was raised, but it seemed to be missing a hand, and his left arm was nowhere to be seen, only appearing briefly now and then.

He was during a struggle that I couldn't understand. He was changing positions rapidly, as if he was being overpowered by some invisible force. I could only catch glimpses of him at times, as if he was fading in and out of existence. And all the while, he was shouting and swearing, his voice drowned out by the deafening noise of anger and madness that I can't even put into words.

I was paralyzed for a moment, then I dropped my gun and ran toward him, thinking he was having a seizure or something. But by the time I got to him, everything went quiet. No more noises, no more movements. I then noticed the grass around Clyde swaying, as if something was moving through it, heading toward the edge of the woods.

I followed it with my eyes until it reached the woods, then I looked back at Clyde. He was still. Lifeless. I left without the Rhino, and I have been haunted ever since by what happened that day.
