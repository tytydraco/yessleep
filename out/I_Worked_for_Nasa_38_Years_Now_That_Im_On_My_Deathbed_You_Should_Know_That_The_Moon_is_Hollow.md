I don’t have long.

My lungs feel like wet paper bags, and the morphine isn’t enough anymore. My daughter said Reddit might help get this off my chest. So here we are.

My name is Gerald Cain. I worked at NASA from 1973 to 2011. Thirty-eight years of silence. Thirty-eight years of pretending I didn’t hear what I heard, didn’t see what I saw.

But I did.

God help me, I did.

In 1976, we launched a series of seismographs on the Moon as part of the final stages of the Apollo program. Publicly, these were framed as studies of “moonquakes” to better understand lunar tectonics.

Internally, we were trying to answer a much different question: Why did the Moon ring like a bell?

You can Google that phrase. It’s real. Apollo 12’s Lunar Module was deliberately crashed into the surface. The shockwaves reverberated for over an hour. Not like an impact. More like… resonance.

Like it was hollow.

We joked about it at first. “Giant alien gong!” someone said in Mission Control. But the laughter didn’t last. Not when the data started coming in from the deep-penetrating radar. Not when we saw the anomalies.

There were pockets — symmetrical voids, miles beneath the crust. Geometric structures. Echo patterns that suggested metal. Not ore — alloy.

That’s when the rules changed. New security clearances. New eyes on the data — not just from NASA. People from the DoD. From black-budget agencies that didn’t have acronyms. If you were curious, you were reassigned. Or gone.

I kept my mouth shut. I had a family.

In 1984, I was granted Level Q clearance under the Artemis Protocol. That’s where I saw it: the internal memo dated March 1972. Top Secret. Signed by von Braun himself.

“The object in lunar orbit is not a satellite in the traditional sense. It is a construct — origin unknown — artificially placed. Estimated to be at least one billion years old.”

They didn’t think the Moon was just hollow. They thought it was a shell. A housing unit. A camouflaged structure. Something parked in our orbit.

A vessel. A ship. A station. Pick your word.

In 1998, during the Clementine mission, we conducted thermal imaging across the lunar South Pole. There was a reading — 173 kilometers beneath the surface. A perfect octagonal heat signature. Pulsing. Slowly. Like a heartbeat.

We sent drones.

None came back.

There’s something inside the Moon. Something old. Something that waits.

And here’s the part that keeps me from sleeping — the part that makes me reach for the morphine even now:

In 2009, we launched LCROSS to crash into the Moon’s south pole. The mission was publicly declared a success. But that wasn’t the point of the impact.

The point was to knock.

And we got an answer.

A low-frequency pulse. Barely audible. But deep enough it triggered sensors in our oceans.

Sonar buoys picked it up. Deep in the Pacific. As if something answered from beneath the Earth’s crust.

A call… and a response.

Two voices.

Talking.
