First, this isn’t a diary.  
This isn’t me nostalgically looking back.  
This is a warning. If you’ve got any sense at all, learn from it.

I don’t know how I walked away from that night. Maybe I was absurdly lucky. Maybe I acted smart. Maybe God wanted me alive. What happened didn’t stay in one night. It spread through my life. It carved itself into my brain deeper than you can imagine.

August 2007.

I was a philosophy student at university. I had dreams — the kind of life you picture just before you fall asleep. I wasn’t an angel, but I had a decent heart. I was into music. I played on streets and in bars sometimes, sang my own songs. Mostly I was like everyone else my age: normal. So one night I did what most people would do and went to a bar.

At least I thought it would be normal.

The girl who brought me there might not have known what kind of hole she was pushing me into. Maybe she didn’t know who she was handing me over to. Maybe she was part of it. I never called her again. I never cared.

Let's start with Clara Denwis.

It was an August evening that still felt like the sun. Clara and I had arranged to meet at school. We were supposed to meet at The Moon Bar. I was where she said I should be, when she said I should be. She had an aura more potent than the strongest drug. Call it charm, call it magnetism. I was under its spell. Around her I felt drunk without a sip. She sat on one of the tall bar stools; I sat opposite. She ordered drinks for us without asking if I wanted one, and I didn’t object. She kept talking, laughing, touching me. I listened, nodded, laughed along — even if I didn’t find half her stories funny. It was like she had cursed me. If she’d stayed forever, I’d have stayed with her. But after a few hours I was actually drunk.

Then things went to hell.

My brain was shaking off the alcohol. I hadn’t even opened my eyes, but I was almost certain I would wake up in the same bed as Clara.

I didn’t.

When I opened my eyes, everything was still dark. A weak, wavering light leaked from somewhere — nothing like the bar. It lit up dust motes and part of the wall. When the light touched my back I tried to move. Reality hit me like a bullet.

I couldn’t move.

I could wiggle my hands, but when I tried to bring my arms forward something was stopping me. When I tried to spread my legs, ropes tangled around them. The ropes wrapped me like a python.

—What the hell is this?"

It had to be a dream. Impossible. Maybe sleep paralysis. Maybe I was still drunk and hallucinating. I hung between dream and reality and no matter which way I moved I felt stuck.

Voices.

As my ears fought back into the room’s soundscape, I heard things: metallic clinks, the rasp of two irons scraping, the sound of someone sharpening a blade. Breath — fast, ragged. A ripping throat. At first I thought the voice was mine; it was too high for me.

It came from behind a stone wall.

Someone was breathing like they’d just run a 100-meter sprint. If I hadn’t been tied down I’d have gone to check. The sounds shifted into moans, then crying, then angry grunts.

—Die, you piece of shit!" said a voice.

I was sure it was a woman. A terrible thought struck me: was it Clara? Was she hurt? 

—Get away from me!"

The voice came again, louder, more threatening; beneath the threat there was fear. The woman in the next room was scared of whatever was coming for her.

Then — the scream. That scream.

How many of you have felt real, pure pain? A paper cut or a scraped knee are nothing compared to it. Pure pain shows you your true face. It kills you slowly, like poison to the roots of a plant: it withers you not instantly but over time. If you ask how a human can show that through a voice, I’ll tell you:

Completely.

When the woman shrieked I felt a terror in my veins I can’t describe. My heart raced, my eyes filled, adrenaline locked my limbs. You need to live it to get it. I hope with every fiber I never have to.

When the scream softened for a second into something human, sobs joined it — that inner, gut-wrenching crying that’s the side effect of pure pain. I felt guilty for the person causing the sound, as if I should feel worse for them than for myself.

—No more..." the woman whimpered.

Then the scream came again, animalistic, like an animal’s final breath. I had to do something. I started feeling the ropes, searching for a knot. I tried to move my arms in strange ways to loosen them.

When the sounds cut off I froze.

A scream that loud stopping instantly felt unreal. The woman must have fainted. Or…

—Focus, Rick, focus on getting out."

I closed my eyes and went back to my hands. But new sounds came — not the woman, now a horn-like male voice, talking. Then another male voice, higher. 

—Is it done? 

Yes. This one’s weak.

 —There’s a new one waiting in the next room. 

—I hope this next one holds up better. 

—Don’t worry, you’ll be in ecstasy.

Fear crushed over me like fog. I was frozen — like something left in a freezer. My veins screamed. Cold sweat ran into my eyes. Those words were a sledgehammer in my head. Next room… the next room…

The door opened with the stickiness of long-unused hinges. A large man walked in. He wore an apron — no, it wasn’t red, it was green, but it was caked in blood. There was a simple bird symbol on it. I didn’t recognize it then, but now I’d seen it in a few philosophy books. He held a saw; its serrated teeth made me vomit when I saw them. There were strips of skin clinging to it, yellowed and bloodied, sometimes even bits of lips or eyebrows. I felt disgust eclipse fear. The man seemed a thousand miles away as he walked toward me but didn’t get any closer. He turned to a bench beside him. Only then did I realize I was tearing at the ropes. I dug my nails into rope so hard they bled. My body had lost control. Absolute fear took over my brain.

—Do you scream loud?"

My heart hammered so loud I couldn’t hear him.

—What?

—Scream loud, I said. Like the one in the next room."

He looked at me and laughed. His eyes measured me, like he was deciding which part to cut first.

—Are you going to kill me?" 

When he turned his full face to me I saw the scalpel. It glinted like it couldn’t wait to sink into my skin.

—No. But when we’re done you’ll beg me to cut your throat."

His breath smelled like rot and he grinned.

The first strike.

The first is always the worst. For a body that can’t take pain, the first blow is lethal. If you survive the first, you may somehow survive the rest. He cut my calf and for a few minutes my vision blurred. I don’t remember if I screamed. Maybe I did. Maybe after the second cut, maybe during my skin was peeled like an orange rind.  Time stretches and warps in pain; seconds feel like years. I don’t know how long he kept this up. But I remember his face when he stopped. He looked at me and I saw how madness had changed him, not pity or mercy, but bloodthirst and rage.

The second strike.

When pain becomes constant it turns into a narcotic. I noticed my head dimming, lights going out. Maybe he noticed and punched me hard to pull me back.

—Come on, rat, we just started."

His fist was a rock. I tasted my tongue under my teeth. Blood filled my mouth. I spat; then another punch sent blood spraying across his chest.

—You filthy rat."

He went to the bench, wiped his face with a cloth he rinsed at the sink. He didn’t take his eyes off me. He stared as if I were some miserable creature to be stepped on, a useless carcass. Hate. Bitterness. Then curiosity rose in me despite the fear.

—Why are you doing this?"

He left the room.

I thought for a moment that the man would call him in and we’d be set free. But his intention changed. He came back holding a metal bucket full of water. Before I could say anything he poured it over me. The cold water stole my breath; my scream came with it. The temperature change was violent — sometimes burning, sometimes freezing my skin. But it dulled the pain enough to keep me coherent. He wanted me sober.

He picked up a pair of pliers. I can’t give you the precise feeling. Think of the thousand times in a thriller when the killer appears before the final cut — multiply that scene by a thousand. He came closer, I thrashed and screamed but the ropes held like ship lines. His breath reeked. He came closer with the pliers poised to pull a tooth. I begged.

—Please… please don’t!"

The third strike.

When the pliers clamped the tooth, my scream matched the woman’s from the next room. I think everyone at the peak of pain reacts the same way. That pure agony I’d described? This was it. Maybe for some people the skin being peeled is worse. Pain is personal. When he finished, he laughed. It wasn’t a laugh you hear in everyday life; it was something from a far darker place. He stepped back to inspect his work like an artist. I couldn’t close my jaw; blood filled my lungs with each breath. He stuffed a cloth into my mouth.

—Bite it. We don’t want you bleeding out" he said, proud as if he’d told the world’s funniest joke.

Then he slammed the door and the last thing I heard before fading was his whistle down the corridor.

Escape.

When the daylight seeped in again my eyes opened to the same darkness. I told myself I couldn’t escape  until a plan formed. The chair I’d been tied to wasn’t bolted to the floor. I could scoot it. I jumped and in a long, exhausting effort I reached the bench two or three meters away. A scalpel lay there. If I could reach it I could cut the ropes. My fingertips grazed it. I rose onto my toes, weight on my toes and the chair supporting me. Footsteps approached. The man was coming back. I pushed myself further. The scalpel fell out of reach. I kept going. The second the chair tipped the scalpel slid and I dropped it. The footsteps were right there.

He opened the door and the light hit the room. I saw him run.

I grabbed the scalpel and he lunged for me.

He was so tall I couldn’t see his face.

 —What are you doing, rat?"

He yanked me to my feet with such force my body went floppy.

 —Shall we continue our entertainment?"

He raised the pliers and pulled my hair, my larynx pressed against the chair. I couldn’t speak. He shoved a cloth into my mouth and I screamed around it.

—Stop!"

I needed a lie.

—Your methods are interesting. Did you invent these yourself?"

I know. I blurted  a stupid question, sure, but I wasn’t exactly interviewing a psychopathic torturer every day. He loosened his grip and took a step back, like I’d made him curious.

—Really? he said."

—Y-yes. How did you learn this?"

He stepped away and began prattling about his crimes like a proud schoolboy. He’d started with his sister when he was seventeen and later spent ten years for killing a homeless man. He bragged that the place had been around since World War II, that members got a tattoo on the arm, the same bird symbol as on the apron. He said they had “subscriptions” for people to be slaughtered on a monthly or yearly basis. He boasted he was one of the more honored members. He prattled for thirty minutes and then got bored of talking.

—Back to business, rat."

I hadn’t finished cutting the ropes. I needed a bit more time, only a few minutes.

—What does the symbol mean?"

—No more questions, rat."

He moved in slow motion with the pliers and I waited for him to bring them to my mouth. I had to act. In an instant I plunged the scalpel into his throat. He didn’t realize what hit him. As he tried to pull it out I held on and he gasped and fought for air. In that moment, his death was the last thing on my mind. I freed my feet, grabbed a knife from the bench and slammed the door behind me.

—burn in hell, scum." I said as I left."

I limped through corridors that reeked like an abattoir  filth and blood everywhere. Fluorescent lights lit the hall at intervals and I had no idea where I was. The girl from the next room flashed into my mind. I opened her door hoping she was alive. She was silent.

Forever silent.

More doors lined the corridor. Some had iron-barred windows where I could see inside; others were solid. Screams poured from many rooms — different voices, different cries, all of one thing: pain. The sound of tools, flesh tearing from bone, bones snapping, organs exposed. I couldn’t stand it and fled. The people here didn’t just love violence; they had an almost artistic style to it.

This was hell on earth.

At the corridor’s end there was a turn to the right. I moved closer and felt a chill on my wrist. A hand reached under the door and grabbed my leg. I kicked but it held like a clamp. I bent and took the hand.

—Help me, help me, help me…" 

 A woman’s voice, but not the voice of someone alive; it sounded taped and repeating. I said I was sorry.

—If I get out I’ll bring help, I promised."

The hand loosened and I pulled my leg away. Then a scream — the longest I’d ever heard — filled my ears. I knew when I got help the girl would be dead.

Most of the people in those rooms would not be found alive.

I turned right. The corridor looked like any normal service corridor  cafeteria, maintenance, security, staff rooms. At the end there was a large garage-type door. That had to be the exit. I ran to it but it was locked. I checked rooms for keys; footsteps drummed behind me. I had to move.

Back in the corridor with the torture rooms I saw a short, squat man struggling with bloody gloves. He hadn’t seen me. I was trapped. I waited until he turned the corner. He hadn’t noticed me, still fighting with the gloves. I wrapped my arm around his throat and held a knife to it. He didn’t scream or show fear. He slowly raised his hands. Then a man and a woman in suits turned the corner and saw us.

—One more step and his throat gets cut."

The suited man did something that ruined my plan: he pulled out a Glock.

—Looks like we have a runaway" The woman said. Neither of them seemed surprised. The guy I held even smiled. I was the one panicked.

—Give me the keys to the outside door.!" I demanded, trying to sound confident though I was barely keeping it together.

—Or else?"

—Or else your client dies."

—Drück fester." said the man laughing in German. My German was rusty but I got the gist: press harder.

He came closer. I was bleeding from a scabbed leg and couldn’t keep my balance. My head pounded. One more strike and I would drop the knife. Tears streamed down my face from the pressure.

—Why are you doing this to us?"

They didn’t answer. They knew I was weak; there was no fear in them.

Then everything happened at once.

I shoved the guy I was holding at the man with the gun. He was clumsy or surprised; the gun fired and the bullet hit the floor. I leapt onto him to grab the weapon; in the scuffle my knife slashed his belly. He clutched himself and dropped the gun. The woman tried to intervene and kicked me behind the knee, sending me down. We wrestled and the gun fell between us. I lunged; she grabbed my leg. She must have taken my knife because when I reached for the gun she shoved a blade into the top of my right hand. I screamed, writhing in pain. She took the gun, pulled the knife out and then kicked me in the ribs with her stiletto. I felt one of my ribs crack. She stood over me, gun to my chest.

—It's over she said, wiping blood from her nose. Any of people in there had no mercy. So ıt was meanless to beg for it. I closed my eyes and braced for the bullet.

She didn’t shoot.

I opened my eyes cautiously. She pulled the trigger, it clicked. The gun was empty. I took my chance and tripped her. She fell onto her hip. I crawled to the knife that lay a meter from me and plunged it into her chest before she could get up. Her eyes widened, then glazed over. I pulled the knife free and crawled to the man who clutched his belly. He backed away in fear as I advanced, and I held the knife to his throat.

—Where are the keys?"

—Technical maintenance room. The key’s in my pocket."

He fumbled his pockets and found a ring of keys.

—Which one?" I said, shaking him. He pointed with his left hand to a small key among them. Then he looked into my eyes, wondering if I’d kill him. I could have, and self-defense would have justified it. 

But I wasn’t a guy like that.

I ran to the maintenance room. The door opened easily. A wall of keys hung there, all labeled “outside door.” I grabbed one and ran back as footsteps echoed behind me. At the outside door my hands shook so badly I couldn’t fit the key in. 

—Come on, come on, come on…

Click.

I pushed the door with all my weight and ran as fast as I could. Outside it rained. The smell of earth and grass mixed with rain into something almost sweet and it briefly pierced the armor of pain on me. Blood and filth washed away into the rain. I felt the taste of freedom.

But then I stepped wrong with my injured leg and fell into the wet mud. The pain brought me back full force.

I wasn’t safe yet.

I ran past abandoned factories. The rain stopped but the sky stayed dark. No streetlights; only moonlight guided me. Ahead was a forest. If those dogs followed me into the trees, I was dead. My only choice was the trees. The pines swallowed what little moon there was. Strange rustles came from the dark I couldn’t see. I was soaked, bleeding, cut — a beacon for any wild animal. A new kind of dread wrapped me, not the predictable terror from the cult but something more ambiguous, like the dark itself.

I walked for hours. I don’t know how long. Rain, blood, and exhaustion sapped me. I was freezing; I might get pneumonia. A part of me wanted to give up and die where I lay.

Then I saw a flicker through the bushes: orange-red, then amber, then gold. Fire. Civilization. I sprinted toward it, each step searing my wounds, blood leaving marks on the ground. I collapsed a few meters short. I remember teenagers around a campfire, roasting marshmallows, laughing. One girl stared at me like she’d seen a ghost and nudged her friend. They pointed and screamed.

—Please help...", I croaked.

Then I must have passed out.

I woke up in a hospital. A nurse was adjusting my IV.

—Mr. Andrew, you’re awake, she said. The doctor will be here.

I was in a blue hospital gown. Machines pulsed my heart. A tall, gaunt doctor entered — hollow-cheeked, quiet.

—Mr. Andrew, how nice that you woke, he said while peering at the notes.

—Where am I? I asked.

—You’re at hospital. You’ve been in a coma for two weeks.

I raised an eyebrow.

—Who brought me here?

—Some kids were camping and found you. They called 911. It’s a miracle you woke."

—Why do you say miracle? I asked.

He explained my state when they found me: I’d lost nearly 1.5 liters of blood. I had a seven-centimeter wound on my thigh that somehow hadn’t gotten infected, my femur and pelvis were fractured. Some nerves in my hand were severed; my index and ring fingers would remain paralyzed. My cheekbone was broken, I’d had a head injury, I’d had about thirty stitches and other things. The doctor used Latin terms I didn’t bother to follow.

—Can I call my mother?"

—Police will take your statement. After that, you can request it. Take care." he said and left.

As he left I saw someone standing in the doorway, one of my philosophy lecturers from university, Paul Holmes. He tipped his head in a doctorlike greeting. Then he came in.

—How are you, Rick?”  
—I’m fine, Mr. Holmes. It’s good to see you.”  
—I was very sorry about what happened,” he said, but it sounded like just something polite to say.  
—Mr. Holmes, it’s very kind of you to visit… but how did you know when I’d wake up?”

He placed his hand on my chest.  
—I’ve been watching you since you arrived, kid. Tell me what do you remember about that place?”

I looked at him without answering. He was just a teacher who came in for a few hours of my class each week. Why had he been standing over me for two weeks?

—Well… I don’t remember much,” I said. But then something occurred to me. I’d been in a coma since I got here, so I hadn’t told anyone what I went through.  
—What do you mean by ‘that place’?”

As I tried to sit up in bed, Mr. Holmes pressed his hand a little harder on my chest.  
—Forget about all that. You just rest,” he said, and walked from the bedside toward the door.  As he opened it I thought I saw something  maybe I was still under the spell of what I’d endured. His arm had a mark.

It wasn’t a burn. It was a tattoo... a bird-shaped tattoo.
