I wish Iâ€™d never watched that video.

Here's the context of the video, if you are interested.
2 children 1 Metal Stake is a real video that can now be found on the dark web that was published in 2006 or 2007 (I can't remember) and was not heard of until 20018. The music makes it sound good, but the video is worse than good. In the video, there were some men wearing orangish clothes who walked into a basement and abused children. Boys and girls maybe, I don't know, couldn't differentiate. They were all wearing skirts, or, should I say, ripped skirts, and they brutally whipped them and began to pour some sort of liquid all over them. Seeing their reaction, it was sticky, so they shoved them in a cage, where they started doing abusive stuff to them. I don't know if I can even say any of the stuff they did. After that, more men started rushing in, holding knives,glass shards, axes, etc., and brutally cutting them up and peeing on them. The screaming and pain of the children can be heard and felt through the screen, while some of the men were laughing. Then, after a few rounds of torture, only six were left. The men took the children and threw four of them into a cage housing many crocodiles, leaving two to see the brutal show. The crocodiles ripped the private parts of the children, breaking their limbs slowly, giving them a worthless death, and I could see the last two witnessing the brutal deaths of the four. Tears came to my eyes after watching their deaths and the emotionless faces of the two. After that, a black screen popped up with a message saying:

Ready for the show?
*A bell rang, and after the screen faded, there were two chairs.

The chairs were not empty; two small bodies were on them. At first, I couldn't recognize them, but when the camera got closer to the two bodies, I realized that they were the last two children.

I could see their glittery eyes, full of innocence. Then another bell rang, and a series of texts started appearing.

YOU TELL THEM OBLIGE
THEY SING, THEY DANCE, THEY FLAP THEIR WINGS TO THEIR MASTER.
THEY SHALL KNOW HOW TO PLEASE THEIR MASTER.
Are you ready to see them, please, their master?

I couldn't move. I could only see the screen. I couldn't even move my head or eyes; I could only see the screen and the torture. I could hear the cry of the children, even though the music hides the cries. Tears kept on dripping from my eyes. A man with a COD skeleton mask came forward and started poking the eyes of the children with a metal stake. When I saw that, I quickly rushed to the bathroom, puckering on the floor. I couldn't look at my laptop screen; I could only hear the phrase.

What happened, Mike?
When I heard my name, I got so scared and frightened that I almost fainted.

The original video was 2 hours long and without music, but the video you will find is just two minutes, and there is a strange hip-hop music that covers everything except the sounds of the tortures and the pleading. In the original video, there were also scenes of work and whip beating before the video started. The video, though published in 2006 or 2007, the video looked like a 1990s video which faded from the surface web and became a snuff movie of the dark web. The video also contained r word . Anyway, this was the description of the video, but seriously, don't watch it.
