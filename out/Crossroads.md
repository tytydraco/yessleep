I met a man at the crossroads. He was standing there, as if waiting for me, his figure half-shrouded in the fading light. Without a word, he gave me a golden pen.

At the time, I didn’t think much of it. In a small town like mine, strange encounters are nothing new. We get our fair share of oddballs wandering the streets, each one adding to the odd tapestry of the place. It wasn’t my first run-in with one of them, but something about this man felt different. He had an air about him—something unsettling, but I couldn’t quite put my finger on it.

On Tuesday, I went to the supply store to pick up equipment and materials for my extermination business. Yeah, I know—glamorous, right? But it puts food on the table, even though I’m not hungry most days.

I greeted the store owner like always. He handed me the usual: rat traps, poison, and black tarps for fumigation. I pulled out my checkbook to pay but realized I didn’t have anything to write with. At least, I thought I didn’t.

I patted my pockets, one after the other, when my hand brushed against something cold on the counter. The golden pen.

“Must’ve taken it out already,” I said, forcing a chuckle. “The fumes must be getting to me.”

I picked it up and began to write, but halfway through, I realized I had written my bank account number wrong. I tore out another check and tried again. Same problem. My hands shook as I scribbled and rewrote, over and over. The numbers never came out right.

By the time I ran out of checks, I felt a deep unease gnawing at the back of my mind.

“Hey, mind if I bring cash tomorrow?” I asked.

“Sure,” the shopkeeper said with a grin. “Not like you can run. Town’s too small for that.”

I grabbed my supplies and headed to my first job—a familiar, abandoned house.

The place was a wreck, worse than I remembered. Dust clung to every surface, and rodent droppings littered the floor.

I’d spent plenty of nights here in my younger days, drinking cheap beer on worn-out couches with my friends. Things were simpler back then. We grew apart as we got older. Haven’t seen them in years.

“God, this place is dusty,” I muttered, stepping over a collapsed beam.

The realtor wanted it cleared out for a family planning renovations next month. From the looks of it, no amount of traps or poison would fix this infestation. I might as well have brought a shotgun.

After finishing the job, I loaded my truck. The realtor showed up just as I was packing. He wore a crisp suit and rimless glasses.

“Here’s your invoice,” I said, reaching for my receipt book. But once again, I had no pen.

Or so I thought.

The golden pen sat snugly in my breast pocket. I pulled it out and started writing. The ink flowed smoothly—deep red, almost luminous in the sunlight. I frowned.

“Was the ink always red?”

The pen glided across the paper like it had a will of its own. The red lines twisted into intricate shapes. Time seemed to stretch and warp. By the time I looked up, I was staring at a drawing.

A crossroads.

“Hey, man, can I borrow a pen?” I asked the realtor, my voice shaky.

“Sure. But don’t lose it. That’s my good pen.”

I reached for it, but my hand trembled violently. My chest tightened, and the world blurred.

“Have you been getting high on your own supply?” the realtor sneered.

His words faded as everything went black.

I woke up in the hospital.

The doctors said it was an iron deficiency, but I wasn’t convinced. They discharged me a few hours later, handing me my belongings.

As I got dressed, my jacket slipped from my grasp. I crouched to pick it up when I saw the golden pen.

“Why the hell am I so worked up over a pen? I need a girlfriend,” I muttered.

A card fell from my jacket pocket.

In elegant, burgundy script, it read: “I get jealous.”

I recoiled. Was this from the strip club? My usual girl wasn’t there last time—should I have just left?

Shaking it off, I shoved the card back into my pocket and headed out. I took the bus, remembering that I owed the shopkeeper money. After stopping at an ATM and withdrawing the cash, I walked the few blocks to his shop.

“Hey, man, I brought the money from yesterday,” I said, feeling a bit guilty. Leaving without paying wasn’t something I usually did.

“Oh, hey! No, it’s fine. You don’t have to give me anything,” the shopkeeper replied casually.

“What? Why? I mean, I know I’ve been coming here a while, but business is business.”

He grinned, an odd glint in his eye. “Yesterday, my wife locked up. She found a couple of checks you’d written and took them to the bank this morning. She cashed them all—they were valid.”

My first thought was relief. Thank God. I’d started to think the fumes from work were rotting my brain.

But then my second thought spilled out. “But the numbers on those checks—they weren’t from my account.”

The shopkeeper shrugged. “Well, sometimes happy accidents happen,” he said with a wink.

I left the store with my mind spinning. How could the checks work if the numbers weren’t mine?

Then panic hit me. Shit. My truck must still be at that abandoned house.

I hurried to the nearest bus stop, got off near the old street, and saw my truck still parked in front of the house. The keys were sitting on the driver’s seat, and next to them lay a pair of rimless glasses and a piece of paper.

At first, I thought nothing of it—I pick up all sorts of random things during jobs, and this house was getting torn down anyway. Memories of the beers and laughter I’d once shared here with my friends made me hesitate. Those days were long gone, but the weight of nostalgia lingered.

I picked up the paper. It felt damp. Flipping it over, my hand came away stained with a dark red liquid. I froze. Written on the top, in a style that could only be described as hellish, were the words:

“I Get Angry.”

A sinking feeling gripped me. My breath hitched. What happened yesterday?

I opened the truck’s glove compartment and saw the golden pen lying there, soaked in red ink. Using the paper, I picked it up carefully and shoved it back inside. Slamming the compartment shut, I muttered, “I need some rest.”

When I got home, I kicked off my boots and took a long, scalding shower. The day had been a mess, but at least my home felt like a safe space—my escape from the world. I grabbed a beer and collapsed on the couch.

As I set the bottle on the side table, it tipped over, spilling everywhere. Cursing, I jumped up for paper towels.

When I came back, I saw it.

The golden pen.

It lay on the couch, soaked in red ink mixed with beer.

“What the fuck?” My voice wavered. “I put it in the glove compartment!”

To the left of it, faint but unmistakable, a single word was carved into the couch’s fabric:

“WRITE.”

My chest tightened as the TV blared on suddenly, the news anchor’s voice cutting through the silence:

“Local realtor found dead with multiple stab wounds. Police are still searching for the suspect.”

The words hit me like a freight train. My head spun as the pieces clicked into place. I wanted to vomit.

I looked up.

Thousands of words covered the ceiling, sprawling from one end to the other:

“WRITE.”
“WRITE.”
“WRITE. WRITE. WRITE. WRITE.”

I turned slowly, my heart pounding. The walls, the floors, even the drapes—everything was covered in the same word.

I ran for the door, but each step felt heavier than the last. By the time I reached the handle, my limbs were leaden. I collapsed.

On the floor, just inches from my face, was the pen and an old diary I used to use for booking appointments.

As I reached out to push them away, a searing pain shot through my wrist. I recoiled, horrified, as blood began to flow. Written in jagged lines across my skin was the same word:

“WRITE.”

“FINE!” I screamed, grabbing the pen. “Fine! Just leave me the fuck alone!”

I pressed the pen to the diary, trembling. “WRITE WHAT? WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!”

The pen moved.

It wasn’t me—I swear it wasn’t me. My hand was a puppet, blood smearing the pages as it dragged lines across them. The ink glistened, and I followed the shapes it carved.

The lines opened, deepened. They became canyons. I was falling—spiraling deeper and deeper into them.

And then I saw it.

I saw everything.

The beginning. The end. The darkness of the human heart.

I felt the pain of a brother’s skull cracking under his sibling’s hand, the raw hatred in the attacker’s soul. I felt a mother’s anguish as she lost her child, her heart breaking so completely that even death felt like relief. I felt the noose tighten, heard the chair scrape, and the snap of her neck.

I saw fires consuming cities. Floods washing away entire lives. The screams of the dying merged into an endless wail. Bodies contorted, twisted, mangled beyond recognition. The hatred of mankind boiled over, unstoppable.

The Earth glowed briefly, then dimmed, and a light shot into the sky, leaving the world cold and empty.

The loneliness of eternity wrapped around me like a shroud.

And then I was back.

The pen was in my hand.

I stared at it, shaking, as realization crept over me.

I met a man at the crossroads, and I gave him a golden pen.
