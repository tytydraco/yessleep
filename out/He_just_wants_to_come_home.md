My brother died when he was young. I was 19 and he was only 8 when cancer had stripped away any precious time we had with him. I know it's kind of cliche to say but he truly was full of joy and life so he was never down about anything. When we found out we tried to make him as comfortable as possible at the hospital but all he talked about was wanting to go home. He got so frail that I knew taking him home would be a death sentence, but staying here would do no better. One day, after I got home from work and while I was thinking about what to do, I found out he was gone.

I never got to really say goodbye to him, never got to hold him that one last time, and never got to take him home. I was so angry at everyone, my parents, my sister, but I was most angry at myself. I mean, how could I not be there for him? Would it have been so hard to take a little extra time? No. But it was no use now, it wouldn't bring him back no matter how much I wanted it. His funeral was the only thing left we could do for him.

That's when the nightmares started. I'd find myself in my kitchen doing nothing in particular. There he'd be staring in the window, skin cold as ice. There was fresh snow on the ground and he had some on his head and shoulders, like he's already been out there for a while. He didn't say anything but he just gave me this mournful look that beat me in the chest with guilt and left me breathless. My head kept yelling to let him in but my legs refused to move. And he just keeps looking at me with the most longingly sad eyes. Then I'd wake up in a pool of sweat.

I wish the nightmares were the worst of it but I'm not lucky enough for that. Early in the morning, before the sun would come up, there would be scratching just outside my room. Every day. The first few times I heard it, it was no louder than a mouse, then it would grow angrier and more frantic until it sounded like someone digging at the wall with a knife. But when I got to the room adjacent to mine I would find no damage to any of the walls.

I decided to put a camera up. The first couple days it caught nothing but the sun rising and setting in the window. Then after about a week, I was checking the sped up footage I saw something that made my heart drop and my hair stand up. Just outside the corner of the window was a huge sad bloodshot eye staring in. It wasn't staring at the camera, it was staring at ME. It could see me through the camera, I knew it, so I slammed the laptop closed so hard I ended up cracking the screen. I removed the cameras after that.

Eventually, everyday at the same time of 2:22 pm, the front door would open and slam shut, like someone had just come home. At first I thought it was totally random but then I remembered that my brother would get home from school every day at the exact same time. Again, when I would check nothing would be out of the ordinary. Finally, on late nights, right before I'd drift to sleep, I'd hear a soft weeping. The kind of weeping that a mother would have for a lost child that would quietly echo in my ears. I'd look and look and find nothing but darkness. That's when I realized it was coming from outside. My guilt grew as I understood that this thing that I was terrified of was my own brother.

A person can only live like this for so long. As if the guilt wasn't enough, he has to constantly remind me of my failure as a big brother, never allowing me to rest. But I deserved it. When he was alive he asked for such a simple thing and I couldn't give it to him. I just kept praying that he would get better, hoping one day I'd walk in and he'd be there running to my open arms. That never happened, and he would remind me every day 

So, as often as I could I'd kneel at his fresh grave and beg for forgiveness. I tell him that he can come home if he wants, tell him he can finally rest but he never answered. I know it's too late, but I needed him to hear me. After one particularly difficult day, I went to his grave and prayed again. An unseemingly special prayer.

That night, the nightmare was different. Just as always I come home to the house empty, and him standing outside the window. He begins to give me that look when I feel my legs working beneath me. I slowly walk up to the front door and open it wide, allowing him to come in. He walks up our stone steps for the last time. At this point in the dream tears are streaming down my face, half blinding me, as I pick him up into an embrace.

His cold skin and frosty hair sting me but I refuse to let go, I was determined to stay there with him, to help him. We sat there hugging for what felt like forever and also no time at all, and he warmed up. He looks like he did before, happy and full of life. He just wanted to come inside. He just wanted to come home and I was the only one stopping him. I cried on his shoulder begging for forgiveness and I begged him to never leave me again. 

When he spoke it was so good to hear his voice again. He spoke clearly and simply and it warmed the whole room. He told me that It was okay, that he forgave me, and that only made me cry and hold harder. Slowly he began slipping away and when I woke up that morning it took me a few minutes to soak in all I witnessed. That's when I realized there was no more scratching. The door never swung open and closed that day either, and I never heard soft weeping at night again. My brother was finally at peace, and in turn, so was I.

I never had that dream again despite my best efforts. I never stopped thinking about him, and I never stopped thinking about my mistakes. He was just a kid and there was nothing we could have done for him. He knew that, but all he wanted to do was come home, to come inside and warm up. I love you Leo and I hope to see you again some day.
