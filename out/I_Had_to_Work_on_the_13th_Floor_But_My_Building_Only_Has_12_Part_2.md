If you haven’t read Part 1, [read it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kr8ws9/i_had_to_work_on_the_13th_floor_but_my_building/) . I’m not going to repeat all of that again. Especially because what happened in the last hours was even worse. To be honest, I didn’t expect so many people to respond or interact with the post (and I hope no one from work is reading this either). Some of you showed a lot of interest, one of the comments even said: “You passed the first test. The second awaits.” Well, congratulations, I guess you were right… I think.

As I told you, there was another envelope on my desk. I was uneasy about what I’d find in it or where it would take me, but let’s be honest: what choice did I have? I don’t exactly know who’s sending these, but despite all the weirdness, if it’s someone from management, I’d have to obey — at least until I’m ready to end up on the street. I stood up, looking around, suspicious of everything, and then picked it up.

The paper was bright. So bright it hurt my eyes. I opened it silently and peeked inside. There were three items:

An old news article, printed on yellowing newspaper paper, with crease marks and a strange smell of dampness.

**1 - The headline:**

“Employee dies in south zone building: elevator shut down.”  
The article talked about someone named Frida Manford, newly hired, who died after an elevator accident. Nothing more.  
The strangest detail: the building’s name at the time wasn’t the current one — it was “Edifício Vehrner.”

**2 - A black-and-white photo, grainy, with a handwritten date: “04/12/1998.”**  
The image shows what seems to be the same company lobby… but different. The signage, the uniforms, even the furniture. All displaced in time.  
There was a woman in the center of the photo. It was hard to make her out, but she seemed familiar to me somehow.

**3 - A technical map of the building, like blueprints used by civil engineers.**  
Drawn arrows pointed to the underground levels. In the lower corner, handwritten:

“S1 – Beware the light. They don’t like it.”

I stared at the paper for a long time. What was this? Honestly, I’ve already ruled out the possibility of it being some kind of elaborate prank or something like that. The photo, the name, all of it was hammering my head until, in a flash, it hit me: when I entered the elevator — the time everything went weird and I found that strange reality — the HR lady I had never seen before… her name tag said Frida, it was her in that photo from the envelope. But how could that be possible?

I tried to hide the panic by pretending to type something when, looking to the side, I almost jumped seeing Leonel leaning against the wall of my cubicle, staring at me. He simply said:

“This building is old… but it has a good memory. It remembers who talks too much.”

Before I could say anything, he was already back at his desk, as if he’d never stopped there. Right, now I was definitely panicking. I went to the bathroom to wash my face and try to calm down. The faucet made a repetitive sound, too metallic, rhythmic like an old machine. And I swear that behind that buzzing I heard… scratching? Short rasps, like something dragging through the pipes. This whole conspiracy is making me paranoid.

I tried to focus on work and luckily, it worked. I filled out clipboards, files, answered some emails until, at the end of the afternoon, a message forwarded collectively arrived in my inbox. Subject:

**\[NOTICE\] – Preventive elevator maintenance**

The body of the message was dry, clinical:

“We inform you that the elevators will be temporarily out of service until the end of the week. Infrastructure Management appreciates your understanding.”

No contact. No clear deadline.  
No one seemed surprised.  
Sandra, the colleague at the desk next to mine, gave a plastic smile and commented:

“Oh, elevator down? Occupational hazard, right?”

The way she said it… gave me chills. As if she had rehearsed that line a thousand times. As if her mouth was just an audio player. That smile looked like a doll’s, until it suddenly fell away and she went back to typing on her computer. Right after that, my watch beeped. 12:00, lunch time.

I wanted to use that break to go down to S1. Even though it’s not on the maps, we always knew there was access through the emergency stairs. I decided to try my luck and walked stealthily to their door and gave it a little “push.” Curiously, that day they were unlocked.

Going down the company’s levels is strange. You never realize how many floors there really are.  
After the T, the numbers stopped making sense.  
S-4.  
S-3.  
S-2.

The walls got damper. The air, denser. The sound of my footsteps, more muffled, as if the concrete itself was swallowing the noise.

And then, after a flight of stairs that seemed hand-shaped, with uneven, tighter steps, and a slightly crooked curve, I saw the door.

A large S1 painted in black, faded.  
No doorknob. Just an old iron latch, covered in dust and scratch marks. Yes, scratch marks.

I hesitated.  
But I was already there. I opened it slowly.

The first thing I noticed was the smell. A sour and rotten smell, like meat left in a basement on a hot day. I covered my nose with a cloth as I walked inside. The second thing was the sound.  
Or rather… the absence of it.  
No lamp buzzing. No dripping. No echo from my steps. It was like walking inside thick velvet. The corridor walls were peeling. Some spots showed exposed concrete, with what looked like… roots coming out of the cracks. But they were dry roots. Gray.  
Dead?

There was a room at the end of the hallway. The door was slightly open.  
I pushed it. The place looked like a records archive, yes — but not abandoned.  
Organized. Impeccable. Lit by fluorescent lights that were too white, emitting no sound at all. It was like being inside a doctor’s office or a library — only at the bottom of the world.

At the entrance, a desk. On it, an envelope like the one I had received, and inside it, only one sheet: “Observe in silence.”

I obeyed.

I walked among tall shelves with boxes of documents. There was the smell of old paper and something else: rust, very strong. After that corridor of files, the space opened up, like a clearing in a corporate forest.

It was a small space. In the center, three chairs arranged in a circle.  
And one of them was occupied.

A man, in a beige suit, legs crossed, looked at me as if he already knew who I was and had been waiting for me. His face…  
I can’t describe it well. It’s like trying to remember a dream. You know you saw it, but you can’t draw it, can’t add content to the form.

“You’re early,” he said looking at his watch, his voice slightly hoarse.

I didn’t reply. He pointed to the chair in front of him, as if it were obvious that it was mine. I sat down.

He looked at his wristwatch once more.  
“One is missing.”

We stayed silent for a while. Too long.  
Then, without lifting his eyes, he said:

“Did you read the report? The one that was in the envelope?”

I nodded.

“So you saw her name. Frida.”

“I did,” I replied, dryly.

“Curious, isn’t it? How a name disappears from so many people’s memories at once. How we’re just numbers to these guys. You work here for years, give your blood, and in the end, dying for the job, this is what you get: a headline in the paper. What a great reward, huh?”  
He smiled.

I wanted to get up and leave.  
But I couldn’t. My legs were heavy. The air, thick.

That’s when the light flickered.  
Only once.

The man looked up at the ceiling. Then at me.

“This isn’t good. When it flickers three times… don’t open your eyes.”

“What?”

But he had already gotten up. Picked something off the floor I couldn’t make out, slipped it into his pocket, walked to the door and said:

“If you manage to get out by yourself, go straight up. Don’t talk to anyone.”  
He looked at me one last time.  
“Especially not to Leonel.”

And left.

The lights flickered again, twice this time.

I stood up with a jolt. The chair fell. I ran to the records corridor. The drawers were now all torn open, as if invisible hands had rifled through them.  
Papers on the floor. Some with names crossed out. One of them, clear as day:

“Temporary Employee – M#####”

My name.

The light flickered a third time and that’s when I shut my eyes. In the dark, I heard footsteps. Not exactly footsteps. They made a different “toc, toc” sound, more like… hooves. And then, a breath near my ear. It was warm, animal-like, almost aroused. A strange hand brushed against my neck, sliding down to my shoulder. Then whispers. Tongues I didn’t understand.  
And one voice, clear:

“You shouldn’t have come down before the time.”

The hand on my shoulder tightened, like claws. I felt it pierce my flesh and started to run in panic. I don’t know how I found the strength to break free from that grip, and I can only thank the adrenaline in my blood, both for that and for numbing the pain and ignoring the blood now running down my suit. I ran up nearly out of breath. Slammed into the emergency door. I could feel the impact of that thing hitting it hard from the other side, but it couldn’t open it. I kept running until I reached my floor. It was lit as always. I was afraid of how they would react, but no one even looked at me. Everyone acted normally, as if I wasn’t there.

I went back to my cubicle. Leonel walked by with a folder of reports. Dropped one on my desk without even glancing at me.

Inside, a single sheet:

"S3 – The third will not come."

I’m finishing writing this now and my shift is almost over. I really don’t know what I’m supposed to do, who this third person is (I suppose the one the man in S1 was waiting for, the one meant to take that other chair). I know a nine-to-five job can be a killer, but I didn’t think it would be this literal...
