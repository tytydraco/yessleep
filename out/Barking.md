l could never sleep at night. 

My sleeping problems began when I was eight. It went a little something like, my dad made me watch The Hills Have Eyes, alone, with the lights off, because I had been a little too much of an antagonist in school. That’s when the bad dreams began—I always thought those cannibalistic mutants would come from under the bed, or out of the closet and devour me in the darkness. From that day forward, I basically never slept the same, and it was a new, terrible thought every night that kept me awake, banishing the prospect of a good night’s rest completely. And even now, 19 years later, everything remains the same. 

  Two days before today, I couldn’t sleep because I was thinking about my ex-girlfriend, Naya, and about how badly things ended between us. 

  Yesterday, I couldn’t sleep because I knew that today, I would be closing on the purchase of my new home. 

  Tonight, I can’t sleep because I’m on an air mattress, in a 1,400 square foot home, with no furniture, no amenities, just me and my thoughts.  And my neighbor’s dog. He’s been barking all damn night, and i’m really hoping his owner shuts him up soon. I have work in the morning, which i’m absolutely not looking forward to, because I have to be up and out of the door in 6 hours. God. 

  The next morning, I went to work and got bitched at by my manager for being late, like usual, and I contemplate whether I want to make today my final day, the same way I do almost every day, but the bills won’t pay themselves. I left work at 4:43 P.M., and stopped to grab a coffee and banana-nut muffin before making it to the house. I talked to the Italian girl, Claudia, who always works the drive-thru. I’m almost positive that she likes me, but my recent breakup has me feeling reclusive—I say a few shy words and speed off, beelining through the streets to make it home.  

 As I pull into the driveway, I see my new neighbors standing outside—a white middle aged couple who look like they’re going on a date, in the way that older people do. You know, nice collared shirt and slacks for the man, floral dress for the lady. The guy is about 6’3, 200 pounds, graying blonde hair, side part, goatee; the woman is almost the exact opposite, maybe 5’3, auburn hair, 125 pounds soaking wet. She’s wearing glasses and he isn’t. Their dog, a pitbull, the one who finally stopped barking last night at 1 A.M., sits behind their fence sniffing pockets of humid air. I glance at them quickly, noticing that they’re already looking at me, and I extend a friendly wave to them. In return, they muster confused, but warmhearted waves. 
 
  I speak to them as I step out of the car, swallowing the last of my banana-nut muffin.
“Hey guys, nice to meet you! I’m Charles.” 
  
  The guy says with the savvy of someone who’s done this a lot, “Hey, how do you do there friend? I’m Andrew, and this is my wife Annette.” 
 
  Annette gestures a friendly wave, but doesn’t say much. I mainly have a pleasant conversation with Andrew, who seems like he usually does most of the talking. We first discuss the neighborhood, the people in it, and I get the vibe that I made the right choice choosing this neighborhood. Everything is pristine, the people are friendly and wave as they pass by, it’s really a nice neighborhood. After further discussing a plethora of other obscure topics, none at all truly important, we prepare to bid each other farewell. I shake the hand of Annette, and then Andy, who’s told me to call him Andy, as everybody else does. We share goodbyes, and I begin up my driveway. 
  Their dog continues its gaze upon me, not diverting its focus once since I spoke to its owners. 

  After I finish the leftover pizza that’s been in the fridge since yesterday, I unwind on the air mattress, fresh out of the shower. There’s no point in getting dressed, no one is here with me. I scroll through YouTube first, then Instagram, then Twitter. I open Reddit and read a few r/relationshipadvice posts, my focus diverted every few seconds by white noise, some car passing outside, and Andy and Annette’s dog barking. Tonight he was howling more than barking, in the way that a dog who wants a treat would. I blow it off, and after an hour, I’m asleep. 

  𝐀 𝐅𝐄𝐖 𝐖𝐄𝐄𝐊𝐒 𝐏𝐀𝐒𝐒, and I’m outside cutting my grass with the new lawnmower I bought, after the neighborhood kids tried to over-charge me 200 dollars to cut just the front side. Refusing to conform, I figured it best to do it all myself. Only twenty minutes in, i’m drenched in sweat, and full of fatigue.

  I’m done cutting the grass around dusk, and I’m beat, dripping sweat like I just ran a marathon. The sun’s finally dipping, but it still screwed me over all day, and I’m kicking myself for not handing those kids 200 bucks to deal with this mess. I’m dragging the mower back to the garage when I notice Rusty—Andy and Annette’s pitbull—parked by their front steps, leash trailing in the dirt. He’s staring at me, same as always, those dark eyes glued to every step, not blinking once. I mutter, “Dog, you’re too damn nosy,” and shake it off, but that look’s sticking to me like humidity.

  It’s 11 p.m., and I’m restless as hell. Couldn’t sleep, so I’m out here pacing my yard, the night thick and sticky, crickets screaming like they’re in my head. Should’ve stayed inside, but my nerves are shot. I’m mid-lap when I spot Rusty again, sitting by their front steps. Leash dragging in the dirt, staring at me like he’s been doing since I moved in two months ago. Those dark eyes glint under the streetlight, and it’s still creepy as hell. I mutter, “Dog, it’s too late for this,” but my hands are clammy for no reason.

  I head back to my porch, grab a beer from the fridge—no furniture yet, just that air mattress and me trying to keep it together. I’m sipping, letting the cold numb me, when Rusty starts up—not barking, but this low, broken whine that stabs through the dark. I glance over; he’s at their back door now, clawing at it like he’s possessed, paws shredding the wood. He stops, stares at me, whines again—high and frantic—and noses the door open, slipping inside. 

  My chest’s pounding. Something’s wrong, and it’s loud in my head.

  I should stay put. Finish my beer, act like I’m deaf. But that whine’s got me paranoid, like he’s screaming my name. I set the bottle down, creep across the yard, checking their driveway—Andy’s truck’s gone, Annette’s car too. Out somewhere, I guess. The back door’s hanging open, and Rusty’s already in there, scratching like a lunatic. 

  I hesitate, heart slamming against my ribs. This is dumb—breaking in’s illegal, wrong, could get me locked up or worse—but my mind’s racing, telling me they’re watching, even though they’re not here. I slip inside, and the air’s thick, sour, like death’s been simmering.

  Rusty’s at a hallway closet, ripping at the floorboards, whining so hard he’s shaking. I whisper, “What’s your problem, man?” and yank the door open, palms sweaty. The boards are loose—one pops up under his claws—and a wet, rancid stench punches me: dirt, rot, blood gone thick and old. I grab my phone, flick the flashlight on, and shine it down, hands trembling bad. It’s a crawlspace, tight and black, and Rusty’s nudging me in, tail wagging slow like a countdown. I crawl through, every nerve screaming to run, knowing I’m crossing a line. The beam hits dirt, then—holy shit—a hand, skeletal, sticking out, clutching a badge. A cop’s badge, scratched with “𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏.” Another body, a leg, twisted up, half-eaten. Bodies, buried shallow, skin peeled back, teeth marks everywhere.

  I gag, lurch back, but Rusty’s blocking me, whining louder, like, 𝐘𝐨𝐮’𝐫𝐞 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐝𝐨𝐧𝐞. I shine the light deeper, and it’s a shotgun blast to the soul. 

Four women, chained in the back, starved to nothing, barely breathing. One’s got a scar on her cheek—her face was on the news last year, missing cop from downtown, begging for tips. Another’s got braids, half-ripped out—gas station girl, vanished six months back, her mom crying on TV. My head’s spinning—I know them, I’ve seen their faces, prayed they’d be found. The third’s got her own fingers in her mouth, chewing, blood dripping; the fourth’s holding a skull—human, fresh, eye socket still wet—and rasps, “They made us… eat the rest…” A Polaroid’s nailed to the wall: me, asleep on my air mattress, taken from above, dated tonight, with “𝐘𝐨𝐮’𝐫𝐞 𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞” scrawled in blood.

  I choke, scramble out, tripping over Rusty, who’s panting hard, muzzle soaked red—fresh, dripping, like he’s been feasting. My paranoia’s screaming—they’ve been watching me, they knew I’d come, this is a trap. I stumble through their house, hit the basement stairs by the kitchen—Rusty’s already there, clawing at a locked hatch. It pops open, and a scream—raw, dying—cuts out. I shine my light down: the four women, chained to a pile of bones, dozens of skulls, some with hair, some with flesh, a whole graveyard stacked neat. The cop’s clawing her chain, eyes locked on me, whispering, “They’re here…” I bolt out the back, crash into my house, lock the door—hands shaking so bad I drop my phone three times—and grab it, dialing 911, stammering about bodies, the news girls, Rusty, the skulls, my voice cracking as I check every shadow, every corner.
  
  Then I hear it—gravel crunching, slow and deliberate, like they’re taunting me. I peek out my window, breath stuck. Andy’s truck rolls in, headlights off, Annette’s car trailing. They step out, dark hoodies up, too calm, too quiet. Andy’s got a shovel, Annette’s got a bag—bulging, leaking red onto the driveway, a hand slipping out, badge glinting. Rusty’s at their steps, howling, jaws dripping blood, a braid hanging from his teeth—braid girl’s braid. They don’t rush, don’t glance my way—just head to their back door, keys jangling slow, deliberate. The lock clicks open, loud as a gunshot, and the basement hatch bangs—chains clanking, a scream choking off into silence. 

  My phone’s ringing 911, still no answer, as their door swings wide, Rusty’s barking tearing through the night. A shadow—tall, evil—stretches across their porch, holding something that glints like a knife, turning slow toward my house.
