If you attend a church, and you've been seeing new people come in during the past few services, than I urge you to be careful. You see I noticed something recently and my endless curiosity caused me to dig into it, far deeper than I, or anyone else ever should have. All this took place in three events, so here's what I found, hopefully you can do some good with it.

Thr first event occured In the middle of December, Around this time I noticed a new girl start to attend services at my church. This is not uncommon for December as many people who are inspired by the Christmas season start to attend December services. However this time it was different. I had seen this girl before.

Despite my acute shyness I went up to talk to her, I wish I could say it was because I was being a Christian. While that played a part in it, it was actually more because she was incredibly gorgeous. We had a nice conversation and she was incredibly friendly, She had politely introduced herself as Kaylie Elizabeth. However things took a turn close to the end. As we said goodbye to each other, she smiled at me and said two words, "Kill Yourself", before walking away. This caught me off guard because at no time during our conversation had she shown me any sign that she was unhappy with the conversation. 

Still I chalked it up to some unpleasantness for a while, Until people started dying. In the two weeks that followed, at least fourteen of our church members had died, either in tragic accidents or by suicide. In every Service, Memorial, Midnight Virgil that followed, she was there. 

My curiosity got the better of me and I decided to try and find out what would make so many people from the same church, take their lives at the same time. Which lead me to the second event. 

Although this event occurred in 1967, I only found out about a few days ago. In seven days the church of Divine hope went from over a hundred members to just twelve and all of those who had survived blamed it on just one girl.

From what I could put together, the young woman arrived at the church on Sunday the Second of July 1967.  On that day members of the church had gathered for their Sunday Service which was not out of the ordinary at all. According to one of the survivors, the name of the New Girl was Tessa Mery.

She sat in the back, attentively listened to the service and greeted the pastor as she went out. After the service she made small talk with other members, before finally leaving.

The Tuesday right after Tessa once again showed up at the church, this time it was for the evening prayer meeting.

She once again sat in the back and as they waited for the pastor to come and she once again made small talk with other members. Since it was a Tuesday evening meeting it was not out of the ordinary that less people were present. However even some of the regulars were missing, people who never missed a service in there life, was gone. 

The pastor, who found this strange, gave a shorter sermon than usual and hurriedly left the church to go about his own business. A few of the members who would survive what would happen in the coming days say they spoke to Tessa that night, However according to them it was the biggest mistake they had made.

Tessa had told multiple people to kill themselves, all this while in the middle of cheery and heartfelt conversations. 

When the pastor made house calls to his devoted members the next morning he was met with gruesome sites. A number of them had committed suicide and even more had died in tragic accidents. 

The following Thursday a candlelight prayer was held for those who had died tragically. However now even less people had showed up. On Friday morning more gruesome discoveries were made and the churches congregation shrunk. 

The next Sunday Service was canceled in favor of a mass funeral and of the over one hundred people who made up the congregation, only twelve were left.  The church was closed soon after, the twelve survivors went to other churches and Tessa Mery was never seen again. However there was a reason for that.

The third event occurred last night and it's the reason why I'm writing this. My curiosity did not want to let go of the situation, so I dug deeper looking for any other tragic events that occurred in 1967 and I may have found one.

One Week before Tessa Mery showed up at Divine Hope, three towns over, a tragic car accident occurred. On Sunday the the twenty fifth of June 1967, a young woman crashed into a barrier and drove her car off a cliff. That young woman was Tessa Mery. Her body was found two weeks later on Sunday the the ninth of July 1967.

She had died one week before she had shown up at the church and while that confused me for the briefest second, it lit sparks in my mind soon after. I now knew where I had seen Kaylie Elizabeth. She was a suspected drawing victim from a few towns over that had never been found. Only she had gone missing some time in November.

This morning I received news of more people who had been found dead and at first I wasn't sure what to do about it. However now I know, I had often heard sermons on false spirits entering the church and enticing the congregation, taking them away from God. Unfortunately only the most confident in their faith could resist them. However now I think that these spirits are stealing the bodies of the dead, the bodies that have not been recovered yet.

I need to confront Kaylie, or at least what's using her body.
