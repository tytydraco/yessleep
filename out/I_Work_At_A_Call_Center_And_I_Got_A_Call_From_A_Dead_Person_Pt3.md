Hello, My name is Eric and a week ago, while I was at work I received a ghost call. Normally in my line of work a "Ghost call" is dead air or someone who calls with no sound or doesn't know you're there. If you haven't read the first two entries I recommend it so you can catch up. Here's the link to the first of the series.

Now, I appreciate all of you for supporting me on this journey so far and It's been a terrifying ride. I did end up finding out where Terry works. He was 1 state away in a small town and owned a small Family-owned tool/construction store. I haven't removed the ring from my hand since the other day. I've been hearing Mary's cries for help faintly still but when I find out where Terry is she could see it too. Her anger was fire and her passion and rage blended together in a cacophony of crying and screaming. Her emotion was powerful and moving as I was taken through her life again. Seeing her past in her most painful moment.  
  
Mary woke in pain and sickness. Looking down at her soon-to-be-born baby she noticed her bed and nightgown were soaked. Today was the day they would be delivering the child and even though she was sick she was happy that her baby would be coming to this earth. A culmination of the love shared between Mary and Terry when it was at its earliest stages. Mary woke up her husband and urged him to get up and take her to the hospital. Tears of happiness and pain flowed like a river as her husband drove through town quickly to get to the hospital.  
  
When they arrived the pains were becoming more and more extreme. I could feel it all... the cramps felt like my entire lower half was constricted and strained. It felt like when my liver ruptured after a fight I had a few years ago but the pain isn't going away it's constant. She was put on a bed and immediately served while Terry stayed back to file paperwork. When she got to the room she was already crowning and the nurses on the scene helped her push the baby out. When the boy finally arrived she named him Kevin... after her grandfather. Covered in sweat and being lightheaded from the pain and experience she was handed the child and held him close to her heart. His cries were strong and healthy as the nurses took him back to clean him off and weigh him she would pass out.  
She dreamed of a happy life with her new family watching her boy grow up. Learning how to ride a bike, how to fish... Her potential life was full of happy moments.  
  
It was bittersweet as she was awoken out of her slumber by her husband crying. It wasn't tears of joy but of sorrow and pain. He was broken holding their son in his arms desperately wanting the corpse to come to life. Pleading with god and begging to trade his life for his sons. The prayers fell on deaf ears... I felt Mary's heart sink and a pain deep in her chest was expanding and the heat of her sadness covered her whole body breaking her out in a sweat. She sobbed and sobbed alongside Terry holding their child together. The lifeless, cold body reminded them that this world is cruel to even the best of people.  
This was the start of their separation.  
  
Terry and Mary were never the same...Mary went the route of getting a hobby. She knitted and crocheted to pass the time and deal with the unfathomable pain of losing a child. Terry on the other had worked overtime every day and got into drinking. He fell hard into that hole and couldn't return from it. A deep pain plagued them both and while Mary slowly healed Terry on the other hand fell into deeper despair. Blamed the world for his misfortune, blamed God, blamed Mary... He never saw her as an equal since that day. He assumed she was cursed by a demon but she stayed strong thinking her love and care would change his view but nothing broke through the alcohol-fueled depravity he was going through.  
  
I snapped out of her vision tears were running down my face like a salty stream. I felt her pain and loneliness. Mary deserved better... she was loving and kind till the day she died and even now she didn't feel hatred toward Terry only disappointment. I stood up and packed a bag to travel to that small town to meet Terry and have him confront his sins.  
  
I arrived in the small town. It was one strip of a road known as the main street with his store nestled in the bottom corner of the town. It was across the street from a crematorium and a gas station. It felt like this town was frozen in time as the architecture was very old but kept in great condition. The main street was filled with little shops and corner stores like boutiques and hobby shops. When I arrived at the store and stepped out the air was unseasonably cold and the air had the faint smell of fresh dough and coffee. The store itself was all white with a green banner saying "Terry's Tool Shed". The store front was glass displaying all kinds of small farm and home tools like hammers, shovels, wheelbarrows, and even small shopping carts.  
  
I walked into the store. It was warm and inviting but I couldn't shake the anxiety I was getting today. It was as if I was something was pushing on my chest with an unbearable amount of weight. I was grasping my chest when I heard a faint voice call out. "Welcome newcomer. Are you new to town?" The old man asked with a raspy voice. He was only about 5'10 and maybe 200 pounds. He was wearing a flannel long-sleeve shirt with overalls. His smile was warming but hiding pain as if it hurt for him to be there.  
  
Me: "Yeah, I was in the town visiting a relative and I am looking for some gardening tools. His old spade is worn down and doesn't quite cut through the dirt anymore" I said holding my arm. "  
  
Terry: "Young man I can help you. Follow me they are right over here." He walked slowly to the corner of the store while speaking. "So, how do you like this little ole town? I want to retire here but with inflation, it's almost impossible. Plus this store is my baby." He spoke and walked somberly to the back of the store.  
  
Me: "Yes, It's quite beautiful. The buildings are all well kept and it smells like warm bread. It's actually quite delightful" I said with honesty but without thinking I needed to confirm this was the guy before I confronted him further.  
  
Terry: "That's one appeal why I moved here too. My late wife La'noire moved here because it reminded her of her home in France. She was a beautiful woman with a pretty soul. I was broken after my first wife went missing. I grieved for almost a year before we moved." he said with such confidence you could swear he was telling the truth.  
  
Me: "She sounds lovely. Do you save any pictures of her?" I asked politely with a smile on my face.  
Terry: "I keep one in my wallet at all times. Here look at her I am so proud to call her mine" He said with an upbeat tone.  
  
As he handed me the photo I noticed the blonde hair and scar under her cheek. The hairs on my arm were raised as I saw her kill Mary and I felt the pain she felt. The loneliness, pain, and fear were all coming back to Mary and me as we looked at the face of evil. This was Terry...THE Terry that took Mary's life and the woman who helped. I was terrified but also...excited. My adrenaline was rushing and I knew what I must do.  
  
Me: "My wife passed too and all I have left is this ring." I showed the ring on my hand and slid it off and onto my hand presenting it. "So I understand your pain, Terry"  
  
Terry: "That's so sad... this is a beautiful ring... It ... It looks like" He froze in fear as he read the inscription of the ring. He was holding Mary's ring.  
  
The doors of the store locked and the lights began to flicker... The old man looked at me in abject horror as he knew I knew what he had done.  
  
Me: "Mary is stuck... help her." I said with a tear running down my face. All the pain Mary has suffered and all the torment of being trapped in that well. All the pain she had when she was betrayed by her soul mate. It all became clear and visible.  
  
He backed away bumping and knocking over a row of brooms. I stood still as the lights flickered more and more until they shut off. He screamed and cried for help...  
  
Terry: "Help me! I'm stuck in here with this mad man" He would yell at the top of his lungs.  
  
Suddenly, a floodlight lit up without any power going to it and pointed toward the bathroom. I could hear running water and the smell of rusty iron permeated through the air. Something was slapping on the door to the bathroom. It was wet and smelled of mildew and rust. The rhythm became faster and faster, harder and harder until it gave way and creaked open. We both stared into the abyss of the bathroom and watched as Mary stepped out covered in blood in a white nightgown. Her long hair was dripping wet on her back mixing with the blood coming from her head. She stepped unnaturally toward Terry slowly. Terry got on his knees and started praying to god and holding a cross in his hands.  
  
Mary tried to laugh as she approached him. Her body cracked and snapped as she moved. She stood in front of the old man that Terry became and I felt her rage build up. All the lights shut off and I couldn't see anything. I could hear Mary attacking Terry. The gargled screams were being stifled by the sounds of tearing flesh and blood splatter. At one point I heard a snap and the screams stopped but she continued. The gnashing of her teeth tearing into him was loud with the occasional snapping of muscles akin to the sound of a rubber band snapping after being stretched to the point of breaking.  
  
The noise stopped and the lights flickered back on. Terry was gone but Mary was still there. She stood there beautifully in a perfect white dress. Where she was once wet now stands dry and her hair shows its full volume. She approached me and smiled while crying tears of joy. She's no longer stuck... Before I left I looked back and she was holding her baby and was walking upstairs to a bright doorway. It's a one-story building... When I got home I kept the ring. It's silent now... Even the phone number is out of order... I... saved someone from eternal torment. I feel happy for once in a long time... Well, readers... keep in mind love is eternal in one way or another.  
  
I love you all -Eric
