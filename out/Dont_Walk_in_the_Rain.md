4 months ago, Sunday used to be my favorite day of the week. It was the one day I had that wasn’t swallowed up by work, chores, or some other monotonous commitment. Back then, I'd use the day to escape my cage of a house. If I had time to make the drive, I’d spend my hours on all manner of outdoor activities, from rock climbing to backpacking. I grew up in a heavily wooded region in Washington and developed a deep love for nature. After college, I moved to the east coast for work. To my dismay, the most practical option for housing was a crowded city, which meant the end for most of my outdoor excursions. I couldn’t stand it at first, all those people crammed together in buildings, buses, and trains like sardines. But my favorite thing in the world was my garden; my small, peaceful sanctuary of nature in the middle of this bustling city. On the days I had to myself, I’d spend most of my time looking after my plants and pretending I was anywhere else.

Those are the days I miss the most. I haven’t even stepped outside all these 4 long months. I know what's out there, even if I don’t dare to look through my boarded windows. My tiny one story house, which had already felt claustrophobic, now feels like a dim prison cell. I use lights, and electricity in general, as little as possible. I want this place to look as abandoned as I possibly can make it.

I’ve taken up reading as my new hobby. If I am to be separated from my ties to nature, I’ll at least try to experience the outside world through stories. But more often than not, this only makes me yearn for what I can't have, like a starving man watching a cooking show. Sometimes I wonder if this is worth it, to preserve myself. I wonder if it would be better to just step outside and let whatever fate awaits me run its course. But I never dared to act on these thoughts before.

Reluctantly, I began to get myself ready for a day I don’t need to be ready for. Keeping a routine helps me retain some sense of normalcy and sanity. Just as I finished getting dressed, the pitter-patter of rain sprinkling against my roof was interrupted by three quick knocks. My stomach dropped and beads of sweat formed on my brow. 

As much as I hate thinking about it, the rain always reminds me of the day I began living this way. Like I mentioned, I had started a new job in the city as a civil engineer. My parents had put me through college and I wanted to make them proud with my high paying career. But in truth, I wasn’t a fan of it. In fact, I despised my work. I spent all of my time in an office building, the glaring fluorescent lights and bone dry air wearing on my mind like a stream eroding a stone. What’s worse, my job was to expand the city, further constructing my own prison of concrete and fiberglass. As time went on, I grew to hate my coworkers for the same reason. Before I knew it, my social life had crumbled into dust. This has been going on for almost 2 years, my life spiraling into a cruel rotation from my run down house to my cubicle and back again.

All those months ago, on a Tuesday morning, the forecast had called for heavy showers. I didn’t mind at the time. Even the traffic that would inevitably result from the downpour only meant more time away from working in that prison. Sure enough, the sun had begun to rise, revealing a blanket of dark gray obscuring the blue sky. Traffic was particularly bad on that day, so I switched on my radio hoping to take my mind away from the horrible destination that awaited me at the end of this road. I flipped through the stations, finding nothing but the sound of static. After a few minutes of this, the rain had begun to fall, battering my windshield with force. I can’t explain it, but sound became unbearable. Every raindrop sounded like a canon, the radio static was like Niagara Falls in my ears. Even my engine was unbearably loud. I needed silence, and it’s not like traffic was moving anyway. So I switched off my car and stepped outside, figuring air would help.

 For a moment, it did, until the rain and radio static were replaced by a new symphony of disorder. Car alarms, honking, yelling, and screaming filled the air as the people around me abandoned their vehicles. They fled desperately through the highway like rats in a maze. My head swiveled back and forth, trying to locate the source of this panic. The torrent of people forced their way past me, knocking me on my back as they ran. Laying flat on the asphalt filled me with the same horror that drove the people around me from the road like scattering roaches. 

At first, I thought I had hit my head too hard. But the fleeing crowd dashed my hopeful excuse. Peering down at the Earth from a hole in the gray storm clouds was a face. A massive, pale, gaunt face topped with long filthy black hair. It had sunken, unblinking eyes and a huge grin. Whatever it was peeked out from the clouds with the same eager anticipation of a child playing a game, as if relishing the suspense of being seen. I could see its bony hands grasping the edges of the clouds like the corners of a blanket as it stared down at us. 

I staggered up to my feet, turning and throwing myself into the river of people. I needed to get inside but the highway was too high up to jump off of. So, like the rest, I ran against what had previously been the flow of traffic towards the nearest exit. Before I could reach it, I felt the people behind me grow more desperate, pushing against the crowd in front of them. People and animals become less distinguishable in times of intense panic. I watched as the crowd trampled over the people ahead of them. Disregarding them to save themselves. 

I turned back to see what was happening, and the same animalistic panic flooded me, too. Unlike them, however, the sight froze me in my tracks. The monster had stuck one impossibly long, slender arm down from the clouds. It groped and grabbed at the highway clumsily, until its fingers found what must have been the unluckiest man in the world. It pulled him up through the air as he kicked, screamed, and bit desperately to free himself. I don’t know whether to label his success as fortunate or unfortunate. Regardless, his capture released him. But at this point he was far too high in the air to survive the drop. I saw him plummet through the air and slam into the road. The smiling being wasted no time in finding another victim. This time, an older woman. Though she struggled, she was unable to break the grip that it had on her. It pulled her up through the clouds, never to be seen again. 

In my horrified daze, I hadn’t noticed that I’d become an obstacle to the fleeing crowd. A burly man pushed me over, allowing the crowd to flow over me. Before I was trampled to death, I managed to roll under a large, dark green Jeep Wrangler in the middle lane. I waited there until the screams began to die down and the rush of feet flying by me dwindled to nothing. Even beyond that, I didn’t dare to move from my hiding place. Starving to death under this car would be a better fate than whatever awaited me above those clouds. As the sun went down, the rain began to die down. I stayed throughout the night, until the sun began to rise again. At this point, I had gathered the courage to peak out from under the car. I prayed silently that I wouldn’t be greeted by that awful grin, and I wasn’t. The sky was clear and the roads were quiet.

Luckily, the traffic the day before had ensured that I didn't get far in my commute. I walked down the highway, passing several bodies of people who had either been trampled or dropped from the air. I couldn’t tell and I didn’t want to look. I made it home and immediately checked my phone to see what was happening. But I couldn’t find anything. Not one report or news story or article covering this impossibly horrific event. I texted my mom, praying that her and my dad were safe. She responded a few minutes later, asking if I was alright. I called her and shakily explained to her what had happened, only to be met with an awkward pause and a long sigh. She asked me about work stress, about my personal life and suggested I consider therapy. I was dumbfounded. I had just witnessed the most unexplainable horror since the Old Testament and no one knew a thing about it. 

It made no sense at first, but I think it does now. Like I said, that was 4 months ago and it’s been happening since. Every time it rains, the same thing repeats. Sometimes it’s only one of them, other times it's more. After the third time, people in my city began to worship these things. Cults formed around them believing these things to be gods, angels, or even Christ returning to scoop up his chosen and personally bring them to Heaven. They must see being taken as an honor. When it rains, they openly go about their day, accepting their fates gladly as the hands of the monsters take them away over the clouds. I don’t care what they are, when I looked into that face, I saw death. I refuse to be taken by them. But I think this goes further than just my city. That's the only reason I can think of that this isn’t making the news. Someone high up, or even the whole system, has to be working to prevent the world from knowing about this. Whether they’re a part of these sick cults or if they have some other motivation, I don't know.

I've barricaded myself in as best I can, surviving off of the food I have in my kitchen and stored in my basement. I’ve always been somewhat of a hoarder when it comes to food, and this only justifies my behavior to myself. But my stockpile is nearly up and I’ll be forced either to starve or risk being taken by these lunatics to be their next sacrifice. I’ve asked for help with my phone, but no one takes my pleas seriously. I can’t contact the police, they’re part of this. If I’m going to get out of this, it will be on my own. 

This morning, there was a knock on my door. I silently checked and saw one of my old coworkers. An older man with grey hair and a beer belly. He had to be part of a cult, he wouldn’t be outside otherwise. It had been drizzling for the past three days. I grabbed a knife from my kitchen, hid it behind my back and went to open the door for him.

He was saying something as I closed the door. Asking about where I’ve been or something similar. I wasn’t paying attention. His words sounded like distant, muffled murmurs. As soon as I closed the door behind me, I jammed the knife into his throat. He clung to it, gasping and coughing up thick red blood. Within seconds, he collapsed onto my floor. But he must have told someone about me, about where he was going that morning. Someone had remembered I existed, despite my disconnection from them, despite my best attempts to be invisible to the outside world. Because two police officers now stand at my door. This only confirms my theory. Everyone in this town either worships them, hides, or is taken. I don’t know what to do. I’ve written this on my phone after I killed the old man. My choices are to run, and risk being grabbed up by the monsters, or to be taken by the police, which will have a similar result. Someone needs to know what’s happened. I don’t know how widespread this is, but something needs to be done. 

I can see the faces outside from the cracks in my boarded up windows. They're looking down at the Earth with the same sick grin. They're looking for me. Regardless of what happens to me, I hope I can save at least some others. Get far away from others. Stock up as much food and water as you can. And no matter what, never go out in the rain.
