I don't know when you will read this but I was out one day and I had 1 friend with me. First I went to the mall, it was raining that day and the weather was very gloomy, but the rain stopped at noon, so I thought I'd take a walk on the beach since it stopped raining. I left the mall with my friend, got on the tram and went to the beach. 

We got off at a stop and started walking on the beach. We were chatting with my friend while we were walking, then 3 young people between the ages of 21-22 came to us and asked for cigarettes, we said we don't have it. Then someone asked for money, we said we don't have money. Then we asked the young people their age and their answer was: Our age does not matter, if you want to fight, come. We were shocked by this answer and could not say anything. 

Then someone took a knife out of his pocket and gave them phones, wallets, everything else, or we can't get you out of here alive. Then the other two took the knife out of his pocket. Me and my friend were very stressed and we gave the kids a small amount of money to calm down and waited for them to calm down but it was not at all what we expected and they asked for more by threatening with a knife in their hand. Then I couldn't resist and punched one of them, the person I punched fell to the ground and I took the knife to the other two and said "Don't come close" but my friend was so scared and couldn't go. do nothing. Then the other two came, and although I avoided the blade swings, I could do nothing against the two of them and meanwhile the third stood up. So I gave everything in my pocket, my phone, my wallet to the young people or they would have killed me, and my friend gave everything. We called the police right after the incident and the police arrived at the scene in about 10 minutes. 

When the police came, we went to the police station to testify and told the story. Then we described the appearance of the people who attacked us, and the police said that there were 2 reports that week with these people, even their outfits. So it wasn't the first crime of those who attacked us, they committed a crime even the week of the incident. The police said they would take care of the incident and we returned home with everything stolen. The next day, the police called us to testify again and they asked for information about the stolen phones and wallets, and we said everything. Then we went back to our homes. Afterwards, there was no sound from the police and the incident was closed. What happened was our stolen goods, we spent a lot of money to buy new ones, we had to deal with the bank and phone operator for the stolen phone and the credit card in the wallet. As a result, my friend developed agoraphobia to a large extent, but I was not psychologically affected by this event, but my friend was. And so the event ended. Anyway, thank you all for reading.
