They buckled at the knees and collapsed into the damp, weathered seats. Laughter burst out from both; they weren’t new to this after all. But somehow they were never quite prepared for the impact of the faster lifts. They reached up and pulled the safety bar down as they lifted with a rush into the air.

"That’s got to be the worst one we’ve had, bloody hell."

"On this resort, for sure. I’ve had worse in Méribel… or maybe Courchevel."

"Show off"

Anna stuck out her tongue in response. It was true she’d been on many trips with her family around the popular resorts, until a twisted ankle prompted her mother to put her own skiing days to an end, out of fear that worse injuries could derail a sublime retirement of hiking the National trails. After that, the yearly trips had stopped altogether. But despite a gap of nearly twelve years, on her first day back she’d hit the slopes with the same fearless abandon as her teenage self. This time, it was with Mads by her side, a friend who’d been a constant in her life since their school years. Five days into the trip, the pair knew most of the routes by heart.

They sat in companionable silence. The steel wire overhead creaked, each chair trembling slightly as it rumbled through the sheaves. After a week of rough winds and sleet, the air was finally still. The soft blanket of snow rose and fell beneath them, tall black firs jutting through. The pistes had been left far behind, but a few daring snowboarders had carved fading paths through the gentle hillocks. Here, they could see for miles around, the clear valley spread out like a map beneath them. In the distance ahead, empty chairs dissolved into a sheet of cloud. Mads shivered.

"Cold isn’t it? I thought being pelted in the face with snow was rough but I’m not looking forward to going into that."

Anna nodded, "Yeah, but we’ve done everything else. I want to get the full set."

Mads grimaced, then said with a grin, "Well if you want to come up again and do the black too, I’ll cheer you on from that cafe at the bottom. Even take a video if you like."

"By myself? In this visibility? I’m not saying no, but my mum would kill me if she found out. And knowing me, I’d tell her."

They rumbled through another tower. The air around began to dampen. Mads’ wide blue eyes shone paler, reflecting the enveloping cloud. Droplets of water fell from the bar overhead, one hitting the back of Anna’s neck and she shuddered in displeasure. Their gloves and jackets were soon coated with a film of condensation. The cold grew more biting.

Anna craned around. No one was behind them. She couldn't see further than five chairs back now, but even before, she’d not noticed anyone else taking this lift. This early in the season, in an area known for unreliable snow, they’d been delighted to have most of the slopes to themselves. This resort was something of a hidden gem that they’d heard about through word of mouth. It seemed that only locals came here to ski; they hadn’t heard a British accent since arriving a week before.

"It’s quieter than I thought it’d be. Even for this place."

Mads considered, "Not everyone is up for skiing through a cloud, especially if they live in the village and can just wait for a clearer day." She paused, then raised her eyebrows cartoonishly and said with mock gravity, "Or maybe they know something we don’t."

Anna flexed her fingers; the tips were stinging and would soon turn numb. Her toes felt stiff in her hired boots and she wriggled them, keen to get her circulation going before they began their descent.

"What’s that over there?"

Anna looked up and saw Mads pointing with her pole far over to the right. Their chair was now moving through a narrow valley and the blanketed ground rose up on each side. There were no faded tracks here. On top of a ridge ahead, a black shape showed indistinctly through the fog.

"Don’t know. A person?"

"I don’t think so. Who’d be standing around up here?"

"A rock?"

"Maybe, bit tall though. You’d think a rock that tall would get knocked or blown over eventually."

"Maybe it’s a sculpture or something and it’s fixed down. An Easter egg as a reward for observant folk like us. Or it’s just part of the mountain."

They drew level and the shape became clearer. It stood out from the irregular smattering of tall firs, vaguely human in size and form, though thin, enrobed in a soft darkness. The blurred outline fluttered gently in the breeze.

As they moved ahead, the two women turned their heads, their eyes fixed on the shape. It seemed to return their gaze without moving. Anna felt a spike of fear and fixed her eyes on the chair ahead, saying with an attempt at a steady voice:

"It’s nothing, just a rock. No one could be-"

Mads rapped her on the arm.

"Anna, look! It’s moving!"

She whipped round. Dimly through the fog, she saw the shape gliding along the ridge. It passed slowly between trees, heading downwards into the narrow gulley. Each woman stared, breath caught in their throats, hearing nothing but the faint wind whistling through their ears. The shape moved on, sinking down into the valley before it too became lost in the thick whiteness of cloud.

"Jesus," Mads breathed, "What was that?"

"Christ knows, some mad trekker. Who would come for a forest stroll up here at this time of year?"

"Thank God it was going away from us." Her blue eyes were wider than ever.

Anna checked her watch. "I feel like we’ve been on this thing forever. How much longer?"

Mads looked up to check their chair number. "We’re 5, that’s 81 coming the other way, so a while yet."

"Have we got to pass by here on our way down?"

Mads dug into her jacket pocket and retrieved a crumpled map. She breathed out in relief. "No, the piste runs right out round the edge of the mountain. We’ll be well away from here."

"Okay, that’s something. I don’t want to hang around at the top, it’s so remote. Let’s just head straight back down. I don’t think I’ll be coming back up here again. The black run can wait."

Mads gave a shuddery laugh, "Don’t blame you. Wouldn’t let you come back up here anyway. I’d break your skis first."

"They’re hired!"

"Eh, we’ve got insurance."

They lapsed into another silence. The cloud around them remained thick, unyielding. Anna stretched her fingers again; the stinging was receding and numbness was setting in. During the crisis of fear, she’d unknowingly gripped the safety bar, the cold of the metal seeping through her damp gloves and freezing her hands.

After suffering a lifelong lack of circulation to her extremities, she had finally taken the step of securing a prescription for Nifedipine from her GP, and picked it up the next day. It was only while stepping onto the plane that she recalled the white paper packet sitting on her kitchen counter, ready to be packed. She had slapped her forehead and laughed about her forgetfulness to Mads, who reassured her that exercise, a warm pair of gloves and thick socks would be enough. And for the most part they had been, but against the damp air and thrilling cold, she was struggling.

Her feet likewise were fast losing sensation. Anna felt an ache deepening around her calves. \*Too tight\*, she thought. She bent over the bar and reached down to loosen one of the many buckles.

The world lurched forward. Through the mist, a black maw in a featureless white face bored into her. Cloaked in blackness, the figure drifted along beneath them, precisely, deliberately, not drawing ahead or falling behind. The gaze from eyes that weren’t there remained fixed. Barely over the whistling wind, she heard a moan of dry, cracked breath heaving in and out.

She screamed, unable to take her eyes from that gaping void. Mads jolted and looked down. The effect was immediate. She let out a yell and clutched her hands to her face. One ski pole toppled off the chair, landing stuck nearly vertical in the snow. The creature didn’t pause. It glided beneath them, looking up, watching. Waiting.

"It’s fucking following us!" Mads cried out, "I knew it was something wrong!"

Anna couldn’t breathe. Her mind filled with the singularity of that abyss.

"What the fuck do we do? Throw something at it?"

Mads grabbed her remaining pole and, with force, threw it directly down. The pole hit on target, piercing the sinewy flesh of the creature's cheek. It let out a coarse howl, its gaping mouth stretching wider, its black sockets boring deeper. But it didn’t stop. Anna felt malice like a physical force from below flood through her, filling her heart with hatred. The thing screamed into her head. It wanted them. They were destined for that abyss.

Mads grabbed another pole from Anna’s lap. Anna snapped back to her senses.

"No! If we have to fight that thing on the ground, we’ll need those. We don’t know what it'll do."

She looked up at the chairs. 28, 27, 26 were passing. They were nearing the end. Their chair was slowly ascending to a greater height before its descent to the terminal. The thing, barely visible fifty feet below, glided on. It was patient.

"What the fuck do we do then? We’re sitting ducks. It knows we have to come down."

\*23, 22, 21.\*

Anna’s mind raced. "I’ll jump. It thinks we’re going to come down helpless at the end, so let’s not give it that chance. I’ll fucking crush it."

"From up here? You’ll break your neck!"

"I won’t. And if I’m going out, I’m taking that thing with me."

"Alright. Screw it. Let’s do it."

\*19, 18, 17.\*

The chair rumbled through sheaves and began its final descent.

"Together then?"

"Together." Mads half grimaced, half-grinned. "Always thought we’d die old ladies in some care home, but this works too."

With frozen hands they lifted the safety bar. The steep mountainside swayed far below, the black figure drifting forward to the terminal.

They locked eyes and gripped hands,

"Three, two, one-"

They dropped.



\*



Anna blinked. Whiteness was everywhere. Despite the freezing numbness that seized most of her body, pain seared up her right leg like she’d never felt. She attempted to lift her head.

"Anna! Are you there?"

With some effort, Anna twisted her neck towards the sound of the muffled voice. Mads was sprawled a few feet away, face down, skis akimbo.

"Yeah I’m here. I’m okay.’ Her leg flamed anew. ‘Well sort of."

Mads grunted through a faceful of snow, "My arm's stuck under me, I think it’s broken. Hang on."

She shifted and with a small cry, wrenched herself out of the deep drift. "Oh Jesus. Is it gone? Did we get it?"

Anna pushed herself up. Mercifully her arms and ribs seemed to be intact. "I think so. I don’t see anything."

"What was that thing? Did we hallucinate it?"

Anna squinted through the snow. Far overhead, the sun was fighting to break through the clouds. "Christ knows."

"\*Allo! Allo?\*"

A figure was half-running, half-sliding down the mountain. He reached them gasping for breath. It was the chair lift operator.

"English?" He asked.

"How could you tell?" Mads quipped, attempting a smile through a wince as she clutched her arm.

"I saw you drop, what were you thinking?" He demanded with a thick French accent.

"Just thought it’d be a laugh."

Anna’s head was swimming, waves of nausea rolling over her. "She’s joking. Can you get us the medic?"

"\*Bien sur\*. I call them now." He took out his phone and began dialling.

"Airlifted down a mountain. That’s a new one."

"You got our insurance right?"

Mads paused. "I thought you sorted our insurance."

Anna paled. "Are you fucking kidding me."

Mads collapsed in laughter, then howled and gripped her arm again.

"Serves you right."
