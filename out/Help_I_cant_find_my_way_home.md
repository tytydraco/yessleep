 

It’s been a few days now, and I’ve hit a roadblock. Metaphorically speaking and literally. We have tried everything to get back home, but something keeps happening. This is my last ditch effort. If you’re reading this, please send me some help. 

Let me explain, to the best of my abilities. While I have a connection of course. Sunday, me and a friend, let’s call him Angus, left Rural Indiana to go on a road trip. My idea of course. He had just graduated college and I thought ‘what a perfect time for a vacation.’. 

Me and Angus have known eachother since diapers. Despite being practically brothers, we haven’t really seen eachother in years. Not only would this be a little celebration for my boy, but we could get closer again. Back to the way it used to be.

“Lewis, I won’t tell you twice, I am not sleeping in a fuckin tent.” Angus groaned at me as I threw some of our shit in the bed of my truck.

“And you call yourself a man? Do you know how much money you’d save? Guess that doesn’t matter to some soon-to-be accountant.” I jokingly scoffed.

“Yeah well, I’d rather keep my balls for an extra $100.”

“Who’s taking your balls? Sure as hell ain't me.” I shot him an eyebrow and he laughed.

”Snakes.” 

“You got me there Angus.” I scratched my head and stood back to stare at the truck. It was filled to the brim with every necessity known to man. You got your highway toilet paper, emergency snack pack, sunset lawn chairs. What else could you need? A cold case of beer and a dream will keep me from running on e.

“You want me to drive, mister educated? I’m not too fond of maps.” My hands were held up as I inched toward the drivers side of my truck. Angus rolled his eyes and took off his hat.  

“Gps and phones do exist.”

“No sir, no can do. This is a tech-free journey.” I groaned before plopping my ass into the truck.

“Yeah there is no way in Hell.” Angus shook his head before setting himself in the passenger’s seat. I grimaced at his reluctance. This would be a sure way for the two of us to connect. He couldn’t shut me out if he was bored. In hindsight, I thank god he was so adamant against my technophobic nature. I wouldn’t be able to write this if he’d listened to me. 

We ended up leaving his apartment at 6 o’clock sharp. The sun was barely peeking through over the horizon, and I was still sleepy as can be. I turned the radio on, trying to mask my drowsiness.

Some guy was yapping about the weather, and I thought that’d sure as hell knock me out even more.

“How have you been?” Angus's voice spooked me and I looked over to him.

“I’ve seen better days.” I laughed, staring ahead and tapping the wheel in front of me. Angus only nodded, looking out the window. 

“And you?”

“Good. Just nervous is all.”

“Why’s that?” I asked.

“Not ready to get out in the real world I guess. Working 9-5’s, and never getting time to myself.” I understood that sentiment. I popped fresh out of high school and ended up working at some factory that makes pop cans. It’s tiring as hell, and some days that’s all I got the energy to do. It’s a wonder that I managed to get free time with Angus.

We drove on the interstate for some time, eventually me and Angus got out of that weird awkward groove. It was like old times. We joked here and there, trying to pass the time where we could. After who knows how long, I was getting tired of driving, and Angus didn’t feel like taking over. Lazy motherfucker. His trip I guess. We stopped at some motel 6, and it seemed less than welcoming.

“Do we have to stop here?” Angus asked as I pulled into the parking lot.

“I have been driving for 12 goddamn hours. I am not waiting for the next place to stop.” I groaned. 

“Come on man, it looks sketchy.” He sighed as he chewed on his bottom lip.

“Oh come on. We won’t be lonely sleeping. Surely they’ve got some welcoming critters.” I joked, nudging him with an elbow.

“Lewis, I’m serious. I don’t have a good feeling about this place.” And he was sure as hell right. I would try and play off the feeling, but man, as I stared at that welcome sign, my stomach just dropped. It looked like a scene from Jeepers Creepers or some shit. Just as I was about to pull out, I noticed my gas was nearly empty. 

“Lewis, seriously?” Angus pinched the bridge of his nose as he stared at the gauge.

“We just went to the gas station!” I defended throwing my hands up.

“And did you fill it up?” He shot daggers at me.

“What? No, I asked you to!”

“No you didn’t!”

“Yeah I’m pretty sure I did.”

“No, Lewis you fucking-“ A knock on the window caused us both to nearly fly out of our seats. I looked to Lewis, who looked at me and shrugged. My attention turned to my window, and I saw a young woman, waiting on the other side of the glass.
Her finger pointed downwards, as she instructed me to roll the window down. I manually cranked the glass and waited for the woman to speak.

“You boys having any trouble?” She asked, chomping on some indescribable piece of gum. Smelled like green apple at the time.

“Well, ma’am do you-“ I was cut off by Angus.

“Who’s asking?” She laughed at his response before tucking a strand of hair behind her ear.

“Saw you two having a screaming match in the car, and most people don’t stop here by choice. Plus your license plate is from Indiana. Long way from home.” Something about the woman was slightly off-putting. Though, she looked nice. Her hair was neatly put up in a bun, she had some waitressing uniform on. Something’s just off about a woman interrupting a car full of screaming men. Or maybe I’m wrong.

“Is there a gas station nearby?” I finally asked, causing Angus to elbow me.

“Well, not for another mile or so. Just straight down that road.” She pointed her finger south.

“We are runnin on low.” I laughed smacking the steering wheel.

“You should be more prepared next time.” She joked with a smile. 

“I wouldn’t try getting to the gas station tonight. Some real weirdos like to hang out around here.” She warned as she leaned her body on the frame of my truck.

“Is that a threat or a warning?” Angus asked.

“A warning. Check out the motel. I know the guy running it. See you around. Tell him June sent ya.” She was walking away, waving a hand goodbye. I turned to Angus and made a face.

“What the hell was that?” 

“She was creepy.” Angus shuddered.

“ ‘you should be more prepared’ what the hell kinda shit is that.” I stated, letting out a huff.

“I don’t wanna go into that motel.”

“Me neither. Don’t really wanna try my luck with the gas station either.” Angus chewed on his lip as he looked out to the sky.

“Sun’s not setting for a little bit. I say we push our luck.” 

“You sure?”

“Yeah, fuck it.” I nodded and opened my middle console. Inside sat a lengthy hunting knife that I always keep in my back pocket.

“Jeez man. Where’s my defense?”

“You didn’t bring anything for a damn roadtrip?” I scoffed and he frowned.

“No.”

“What about bears!”

“Do you think bears are gonna be scared of a hunting knife?” 

“I think they may feel at least threatened.” I scoffed digging further into the console. 

“Here.” I handed Angus a pocket knife and he sighed.

“Good enough.” We both got out of the truck, and I headed to the trunk to grab an extra gas canister. In that sense, I did come prepared. We both started walking toward the direction the woman pointed, and noticed something strange. There was not a soul in sight.

“Where is everyone?”

“Maybe they heard about the night weirdos.” Angus joked.

“Yeah or maybe we’re the weirdos.” I laughed. We continued walking before a gas station finally came into view. The woman wasn’t lying. It was decrepit, and looked as if it smelt like mildew. I turned to stare at Angus for confirmation, and he simply nodded. We would pay, get our shit, and get going. Angus and I walked up to the gas pumps and immediately the grin on my face was wiped. Cash only, pay inside.

“What options do we have?” Angus asked as he ran a hand through his hair.

“Not much it seems.” I stated, as I made my way to the inside of the gas station. Upon entry, everything seemed normal. There were snacks, lotto tickets, cigarettes, you name it, they had it. It seemed like your average gas station. We both grabbed some road snacks and headed toward the checkout. But, no one was there.

“Hello?” I yelled, looking around. Angus shifted on his feet nervously and I noticed a bell on the counter. ‘Ring me!’ and so I did. Nothing happened, and no one came. I didn’t feel like stealing, but this was a last ditch effort. I leaned over the counter, looking to see how the pump handling worked.

“What do you think you’re doing?” A voice boomed.

“I’m sorry, sir, we just needed some gas. Desperately.” I tried laughing off my crime.

“Were you going to steal?” The man scoffed, stomping towards us.

“No, no. I was gonna leave some cash, right here.” I pointed at the counter and the man simply grimaced at me. 

“How much.”

“What?” 

“I said how much! I gotta get home!” The large man scolded us.

“$20 on 1.”

“Get your shit and leave.” I paid for all of our things, and we both rushed to the gas tank.

“What was that about?” Angus asked.

“Fuck if I know. Let’s get the hell out of here.” I instructed. The two of us filled the gas canister up. I got stuck holding it, while he managed the food. Our pace had quickened after the incident with the man. I was on edge, and knowing Angus, he was even more so. We borderline sprinted back to the motel. I was fearful that my truck would be taken, or at least the things in the back. To both of our surprise, everything was intact. By the time the truck’s gas was filled it was pitch-black out. I was exhausted at this point, and didn’t feel like I could manage a vehicle. Angus was in the same boat. 

“Let’s just stay here.” I offered. Which caused Angus to shake his head.

“No way, Lewis. I’m not staying there.” 

“What’s the alternative? Sleeping in the truck?”

“That’s not a bad idea.” He scoffed.

“Fine. Fuck it. We’ll sleep in here.” So, I locked the car doors, put up some shielding on the front windshield, and we both tried sleeping. Angus knocked out almost immediately. I, on the other hand, was fighting the good fight. Everytime my eyes fluttered shut, my anxiety pinched me awake. Something wouldn’t let me sleep. I stared out my window, and everything looked the same. Everything except… a person. They stood tall, next to a lamp post. I only watched, quick to not make any sudden movement. Its body was illuminated by the light, as it paced back and forth. The silhouette was hard to make. Presumably, it was a towering man, keeping himself occupied. The way it trudged forward was unsettling. Like it was on watch.
I continued to stare at the shadow, hoping it wouldn’t notice me and Angus’s presence. That is. Until Angus let out the most earth-shattering fucking sneeze this side of Texas. 

“Jesus.” I whispered, turning to look at the man. His mouth was agape and his eyes shut tight. He was getting the best sleep of his life. I focused my attention back out the window, only to find the man was gone. 

“Shit.” The handles to my truck were being pulled on, aggressively. I couldn’t find the culprit, moving my head around nearly 360. Finally my eyes met with something… somebody… banging on Angus’s door, who was none the wiser. The person seemed like a shadow. I couldn’t tell if it was the lack of lighting or just what he looked like. Before rushing to turn the ignition, my eyes felt drawn back to the motel. I saw her. That woman. June. She was behind one of the windows, holding up a finger in front of her lips. June was right about the weirdos.

Why wouldn’t she be right about this? A smile set upon her face as she noticed my hand leaving the ignition. The shadow eventually gave up, focusing his attention on the rattling of a nearby trash can. It was only a few minutes later, that I felt myself drifting off to sleep. I don’t know how I managed, but I did.

Me and Angus both woke up at the same time, around noon. I explained to him what I saw, and he wrote me off as crazy. 

“You just needed some sleep.” He reasoned, popping his back.

“No… no Angus this was real. We gotta get outta here.” I stated.

“I mean, I sure as hell agree with that. This place is creepy.” I let out a sigh and shook my head. Something was wrong with this place. I turned the truck on, and began to drive. I didn’t care if I had everything. I didn’t care if Angus wanted to stop at some gift-shop. I didn’t care if he wanted to keep on going west. I’m taking us home. Kansas aint all it’s chalked up to be. Flat as a board, but filled to the brim with weirdos it seems. It aint winning a first-place prize on first impressions. We drove for awhile. Well, I drove for awhile. Angus jack-assed on his phone. 

It was nearly five hours when I noticed that the flatness of the highway was still present.
The road signs had been changing, but the road wasn’t.

“Hey Angus.”

“Hmm?”

“Doesn’t that house look the same as the last?” I pointed to an old-farmhouse off in the distance.

“Yeah kinda. That’s funny.” He smiled, turning his attention back to the phone.

“We going the right way?” I ask.

“Yeah GPS says we’re on the right road.” 

“How much longer?”

“Says about 7 hours till we’re back in Indiana.” Angus was bummed at first that I was adamant to head home. But he understood. The ‘vibes’ were off, and shit just felt weird. I promised I’d buy him a big ol’ pack of beer and as many strippers as he wanted. He said he’d pass on the beer. His loss. It was beginning to be evening again, and god I aint ever felt fear like I did when that sun set. When I watched it fall into the landscape, I felt so much dread deep in the pits of my belly. Surely Angus was feeling it too. I wanted to stop, but where could I? Corn, corn, and more corn filled my eyes. My body waved back-and-forth, as my drowsiness ensued.

“Hey, there’s a place to stop up ahead.” Angus assured me pointing to a rest-stop. A rest-stop all the way out here? That just don’t make sense…

“Not stopping.” I groaned.

“Lewis, you’re about to keel over.” 

“Then you drive.” I barked.

“I’m tired too.”

“Imagine how I feel!” He let out a sigh and I smacked the steering wheel.

“Goddamnit Angus.” 

“Let’s just stop. I’m sure it’s fine. You were just seeing shit earlier.”

“Seeing shit? Angus, I was hearing it, fucking feeling it. This ain't right. Why are we still in corn fields for fuck sakes. Somethings wrong.” Angus only shook his head at my outburst. He told me to pull into the rest stop, he was gonna call someone. So, we did. I sat in the truck as he got out, and paced back and forth. The phone was stuck to his head as he waited for someone to answer. I watched him as he stood, illuminated under the lamppost.

The night was deep, no one was around, and it seemed that Angus wasn’t getting any answers. He angrily grabbed his hair, letting out a frustrated groan. I furrowed my brows, and looked down at the wheel. This was my fault. I got us lost, or something. This entire trip was ruined. I just wanted a good time out with my friend. I missed him. It’s been so damn long since either one of us actually enjoyed life. Cherished it. Angus, forgive me. Angus? 

My eyes darted around the parking lot. Where had Angus gone? I immediately grabbed my blade, shoving it into my pocket.

“Angus?” I spoke, walking around the stop. No one was out there. You couldn’t hear a fucking thing. Not even crickets. That is, until a quiet groan rang out. My head darted around frantically. Was that Angus? I ran into the rest-stop, stopping to try and locate the sound.

“Lewis.” A pinched voice spoke. Which way. Fuck.

“Angus?” He said my name again and I immediately ran for the women’s restroom. My knife was unsheathed in my hand, and I bolted into the bathroom. 

“Lew…” he groaned. I stopped in my tracks, and my stomach dropped. Blood. Thick, wet, and dark dripped into the drain in the middle of the room. The stench of it burned my nose, as I slowly walked towards the sound of Angus. The light of the bathroom flickered above me, and I felt sweat pooling above my lip. The blood was coming from the second stall, fast, and steady.

“You alright Angus?” I asked. He only groaned. His groan. It. Fuck it turned into a low hum. Almost like a growl. I inched closer to the stall, hand almost pressed against the door. What was that sound? Lips smacked together and I could hear something borderline slimy? It was hard to distinguish. Angus let out a soft moan, as a crunch erupted into the air. I stepped back. I grimaced at both the sounds and the smell.

“Lewis?” I heard, coming from outside. My stomach dropped. The sounds stopped, and something fell to the floor. My eyes looked down, only to see a chunk of flesh, sliding toward me. I bolted. My legs pounded into the ground and I slammed the bathroom door shut behind me.

“Nope. Nope. Nope. Fuck. Fuck.” I huffed as I continued running. Angus stood near the car with a pained confused look. I unlocked the truck.

“Get in the goddamn truck!” I screamed and Lewis stared at me with wide eyes. He threw himself in the passenger seat and I nearly flew to get inside. Didn’t even buckle my seatbelt. Angus locked the doors and I jammed the keys into the ignition. 

“What’s going on?” Lewis asked, gripping his arm.

“Shut the hell up!” I yelled, pushing the car’s gas. I could tell, by the look on Angus’s face that he saw what I was running from. I didn’t get a good look at it, but I know sure as hell, it wasn’t pretty. My eyes looked over to Angus as we continued driving. He was gripping his left arm tight. I couldn’t see in the dark, but I think there was a cloth being held to it.

“What happened?” I asked, still out of breath.

“An animal bit me.” He answered groggily.

“The fuck you mean animal? Oh dammit Angus. Is it bad?” I asked, trying to keep focused on the road.

“Yeah.” He whispered, and I could hear tears choking him.

“Hey. Calm down, I’ll pull over, I got a first-aid kit somewhere up here.” I assured and he just cried.

“No.” He stated.

“You’ll fucking bleed out. And on my, may I add, new seat covers.” I tried lightening the mood but he was inconsolable.

“No one picked up.” 

“What do you mean?”

“I tried calling everyone I knew. No one answered.” He began to hiccup and I felt like shit.

“Maybe bad service?”

“I had 5 bars. I called 911. All the lines are busy.” At that notion, I went quiet. After a few minutes, I found a clear shoulder, and ended up pulling over. I turned the overhead light on, and focused on Angus. 

“Just be quiet. Okay?” I instructed, and Angus nodded. The first-aid kit was fortunately filled to the brim, I guess I deemed it necessary. I removed the cloth from his wound and grimaced. It was bad. I don’t know how he hadn’t already passed out. He stuffed the wound in a way that stopped the bleeding, but it was big. The tissue was exposed, and at that point I didn’t know if stitches would do anything. Angus covered his eyes, laying back and giving me free-reign. I’m gonna be straight. I don’t know shit about wounds, and what the hell I’m supposed to do with them.

This seemed thick and deep, so I wondered if gauze would be a good option, just for the time-being, till I can get help? I tried cleaning it, but he nearly screamed. After trying to disinfect the wound, I mimicked what he did with the cloth, and wrapped it tight with even more gauze. It stopped the bleeding for the most part, but I could tell it hurt like a bitch. 

This all happened yesterday evening. Now, it’s nearing nighttime again and I pulled the car over near some gas station. No one’s inside, I haven’t seen another person since that June girl. Angus is asleep next to me, he’s really fucking sick. His face is all pale, he’s sweaty, and won’t stop coughing. I don’t know what to do at this point. We keep driving, but all we find are cornfields and random buildings. I feel like we passed by the motel again, but I may be wrong. I think Angus might die… Hell, I think I might die. I tried calling people, anyone, but no one will answer. This is my last-ditch effort to try and find some help. I don’t even know if this’ll post, or if anyone will see it.

I’m stuck somewhere in Kansas, and I can’t find my way home.
