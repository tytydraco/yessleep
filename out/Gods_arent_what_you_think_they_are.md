Hi, let me refer myself as John, right now I am being watched by beings that are outside the rules and laws of this world these are the consequences of my actions, those eyes watch each and every second of my life, day and night except on the 3rd day from a full moon and this post here is my only way to warn everyone about the reality they would never even dream of, this post will be a long one so I will divide it into parts this part will be an Introduction and the start of my journey.

**Introduction:**  
Gods are not what you think they are, based on where you are from you might have a God or many of them but the reality lies in the work divinity, every being who possess certain level of divinity are classified as gods, they can be classified into two types, that is the gods who are born with divinity and the second are those who acquired divinity through any means,  
God who are born with divinity are part of **Archikos** faction while those who acquired divinity are from **Metagene** faction, as you might have already guessed it Archikos faction gods have an advantage when it comes to the way they use their divinity as they are born with it and every aspect of their being is meant to be used with divinity, 

While Metagene faction have to face challenges here it is not entirely a disadvantage as they start using divinity they started to evolve it in many ways for example some Humans/animals who attained divinity treated it like blood in our bodies and stored it in their hearts they circulated divinity through their blood it is considered as one of the best ways one can attain the level to call themselves gods but it is not as easy as it sounds and our blood vessels and muscles are not build to contain divinity there are many instances where humans who want to attain godhood turned into a puddle of flesh and blood so how can one solve this issue, is there a way? if yes, then did someone successfully used it to attain that level? and the answer is **YES.**

These differences lead to a civil war among **Archikos** & **Metagene** in which neither of the factions had a clear victory, both suffered damages high and low, after which they formed a council of gods comprising both the factions this council was called **Synélefsi Theón**  translated to **Assembly of Gods,** as a part of this peace pact **Metagene** accepted to remove all traces of the way to attain Godhood form their places of origin, so majority of the records are either destroyed or stored in some remote corner of this universe, can anyone human or non-human find the traces of such records?

I am john, an archeologist and a historian I started on this journey to find what it means to attain god hood, to find if there is someone or something who have done that, This journey started by a small story or should I say a legend, The Japanese legend of the koi fish tells the story of how these fish swim upstream and, when they reach the top of the river they transform into powerful dragons. This transformation is does not happen spontaneously, however. The koi fish must swim against the current.  
My search led me and my team of 12 to a Sanskrit book **देवत्वस्य आसुरीमार्गः** which can roughly be translated to >!The demonic path to divinity!<\*\*,\*\* this book has 7 paths to attain such divinity and 5 gruesome steps to make the attained divinity your own, these 7 paths state 7 different ways of attaining the divinity.

One such method is by **Flesh Power,** also known as >!भक्षक - The Devourer!<\*\*,\*\* In this path user strengthens their own body to the point they could sustain the divinity, a simple solution for the main problem but how can a man strengthen his flesh power to such a degree, a human can never have such strong flesh power even they start exercising from the day they were born that is what we thought until that day - it was a normal day for us, we were decoding the text from the book we found and came to know of the gods and their factions, while we were busy with our work an old beggar who was passing by saw us with the book and came towards us, he looked frail around 60years maybe, looking straight into my eyes he just pointed towards northwest and said behind that hill these is a temple go there and you will find your answers, we lot were confused I asked who he was and what he was talking about and he said that place is where everything began and has every answer, he left after saying that, so here we are going to the temple to find out more about what lies ahead,

this is it for this part I know you guys have a lot of doubts and questions but right now I am not in a position to answer all of them I am bound by the rules of Casuality right now, I will try to answer as many questions as possible, If you felt like this is too much to read then you are not alone, wait for the next parts to know what happened at the temple which made me what I am today.
