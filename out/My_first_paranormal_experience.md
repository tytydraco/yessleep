Back when I was 12 I was obsessed with ghosts and decided to make a homemade ouija board from an old sketchbook cover, paint markers, and a shot glass. Although it was the most ghetto board I had ever seen I had high hopes to make contact with the dead. I was home alone for the night and thought this was the perfect time because I knew if my mom had caught me I would've got my ass beat. She liked to pretend she didn't believe in ghosts but would throw a fit if she knew I was doing something like this.

I proceeded to make a circle out of candles in my bedroom and sit in the middle with my board placing my fingers on the shot glass. I followed all the directions and asked multiple questions but was left disappointed when I got no answers and saw no sign of movement. Thinking my board was a total failure I didn't bother saying goodbye. I blew out the candles and tidied up getting ready for bed, leaving the bathroom light on because I was afraid of the dark and could see into the bathroom from my bed if I looked through the mirror reflection in my hallway.

I was asleep for a few hours until my cat woke me up by hissing and groaning around 1:00 am. I could hear her but I couldn't see her. I rubbed my eyes and scanned over my room trying to find out what she was hissing at. I couldn't see my cat but as I was looking around I noticed movement in the bathroom, paralyzed with fear I stared into the mirror. A girl with long black curly hair was standing there brushing her hair. She was ripping the brush through her hair quickly and aggressively. I felt my heart drop into my stomach and knew something was off but I assumed my mom had just come home early from an apparent rough night. I hesitantly got out of bed and started slowly and quietly walking towards the washroom, as I turned the corner the hairbrush fell on the floor and the shower curtains rattled for a second as if they shot closed.

As I was going to open the curtain and check it out, my cat snuck up behind me and began hissing again, nearly giving me a heart attack. I was petrified and ran outside pounding on my neighbor/friend's door to let me in, there was no way I was sleeping alone in that house so she let me stay the night there. I never found out what was behind that curtain. I've kept the ouija board with me to this day, locked away in my attic space… I've heard way too many horror stories of what happens to people once they get rid of their board for me to make that mistake. I’ve never felt completely alone since that night. I’m 20 now and still feel as if someone watches me sleep.
