I don't go to Yellowstone.  Well, at least not since 2001.  I know what you might be thinking.  Why avoid a place for over 20 years when there's no evidence of it erupting? I mean, there's plenty of things to do in the National Park.  Plenty of sites to see, including the ever so famous Old Faithful, and even some bears and other wildlife to view and snap shots of for family albums you'll spend over an hour scrapbooking.   


But for me my vow to never enter that place again started when I took a road trip with a college friend.  We had both finished our second year and wanted to start off our summer driving to Malibu all the way from Jersey.  We had seen way too many advertisements for it and thought it would be a good chance to maybe meet some girls and check out a few food stands. Corny as it sounds.  We were young and didn't really have a plan. But we did make enough time to map out where our relatives were from Point A to Point B. We would be visiting my relatives first in Ohio and his relatives second in Wyoming. Then after a resting point in Nevada, we would do a straight shot to California. And probably dunk ourselves in the water from all the sweat that accumulated in the car.   


Well least to say we were exhausted from exiting Ohio and tag teaming each other to take the wheel in order to get to Wyoming. After a mutual decision, we both agreed to rent a cabin and do some sight seeing for a few days before marching back to my 1990 Toyota Corolla to head to his relatives for some half cooked peach pie or something like that.  I can't really remember what dish my friend detested but he told me to just be polite and discretely get rid of it since his grandma was sweet and didn't know any better when she baked it.   


What I did remember is him mentioning the kill zone.   


"Yeah, it's this place where if you die only 12 people living in it can act as a jury for whoever wacked you.  It takes forever to process a case," he said excitedly as he was packing up more gear and snacks to head on a trail we picked.  I had provided bear mace in my provisions and tucked it away where I could reach it in my pocket while we talked, and I just shook my head at this.   


"There's no way this can be real," I tittered.  He was always into trivia.  When he wasn't reading Nietzsche in Russian or talking about the rock formations of what we passed on our trip, he was reciting trivia to me.   


He swore up and down it was and said, "No really!  That's one reason why people go missing up here! My mom tells me all the time not to go alone while visiting Yellowstone!"   


"Are you sure she just didn't want you to fall into a hot spring?" I laughed, not taking him seriously.   


"You know what, Jack? There's some spooky shit around here. There's a reason our families tell us to stick together instead of just wandering off around Yellowstone."   


"Yeah, okay.  Well, we need to head off if we want a good start on this trail so."   


"Fine, whatever," he just said, looking disappointed.   


We had decided to pick the trail next to Mammoth Mountain and I know my friend wanted to explore the area around where the hot springs were along with whatever else we could find.  We set off in the car and picked a spot to park next to our trail.  Once on the hike he kept looking around on occasion and told me bears come around here and to keep an eye out for them.  I just chuckled and brushed it off as borderline paranoia.   


When we got to the halfway point that's when he wandered off and gestured with his hand for me to follow him.    


"Are you kidding?  These trails are marked for a reason."   


"Come on," he said, "it won't take too long. It's just what a friend showed me last time we went up here. I promise we'll be back on the trail before you know it."   


I scoffed, "Whatever, man.  I just don't want to be the one to tell your parents you found your way into a hot spring."   


He just laughed and looked at me like I was in for some big surprise at the end.  He was right though.  It didn't take long for him to show me what it was.  It was about 30 minutes in that he showed me a big hunk of metal that appeared rusted and deteriorated next to a squirrel that looked like it had just decided to fall asleep and never wake up.   


There wasn't much else to take in. The area in this patch of dried  grass was quiet. Not a bird chirped. The sun lit the backs of the trees and the earth for that moment was still.  It almost could appear peaceful.   


If it wasn't for the smell.   


"Urgh, God. What is that?" I coughed, covering my nose. The smell still crept in, permeating my nostrils with that awful stench. It smelled like burning iron, like pus, like being next to a vat of disposable chemicals. I almost felt sick.  Like I wanted to throw up.   


My friend could be so strange.  He just offered his extra mask he had brought and started to put one on himself.   


"I wanted to bring you here to get your opinion. You're studying this stuff, right?" he asked.   


My eyes were starting to sting, like how you get when you're too close to onions.  And I got a really strange feeling about this place like we weren't supposed to be here. The air felt electric.  Like my skin was tingling and getting exposed to something unseen but harmful to us both.   


"I get what you're getting at, but we don't even have the right equipment to study it. I just think we need to go, man."   


He just sighed and looked at me sad.   


"Well, at least you're somewhat confirming it."   


It was then we heard someone talking from a distance.  Something in a different language I wasn't fluent in.  I could only make bits and pieces of the words while my friend froze like a deer trapped on a cliff next to a mountain lion.   


"Jack," he said slowly, "when I give you the signal, you need to run."  He put his hand up and made it into a thumbs up, then slowly put it down.   


"What?" I whispered, trying to suppress the growing panic in my voice. "What do you mean?  Let's just go!"   


"My friend never made it out, Jack. They did the same to him that they're going to do to me. They're debating if I'll join them, but I don't want to."   


"You have a family though! Let's just leave!" I pleaded.   


"Exactly. And I'm not going to be a part of this. I know what they're planning to do. They're going to shoot me since I'll say no but they'll leave it at that. They won't go further."   


I just stood there rooted. I couldn't go.   


"They're not here yet," I begged. "Let's just - "   


There was the crack of some twigs on the ground that sounded closer. About 50 feet away. Then the sound of someone unfurling plastic could be heard.   


"Don't come back here. And if you meet my family say New Zealand nice and tell them I love them."   


He put his hand up in a thumbs up signal.   


I bolted as fast as I could.  What took 30 minutes turned into ten and it wasn't until I was firmly at the beginning of the trail that I ripped off my mask and I wheezed. I didn't even care how I looked, but thankfully I was to myself in that moment.  I shuddered and knew whatever I encountered had been the death of him and I let out a small sob before crawling into my Carolla.   


I turned on my engine and drove out of there like a bat out of hell. The cabin we had stayed at had a telephone where I then called the police, stumbling over sentences to tell them what I could.  I told them I lost my friend on the trail where we had encountered some guys who did something to him and told them exactly where that trail was.  They told me to wait where I was and I would be questioned about it.  After some very frustrating interrogating practically painting me as the culprit, they sent a search party 17 hours later.  After 8 hours, they found the clearing.  They said there was no remnants of metal or my friend. Just a dead squirrel laying on top a patch of dried grass next to a small campfire.   


"Squirrels die all the time, son.  It doesn't mean there's anything abnormal about the area.  Sorry to hear about your friend though," one of them had said to me.   


"Might have fallen into a geyser," another one joked before being told to shut it by the rest.   


"Sorry about him, son.  He has no manners.  But for your own safety please don't wander off the path.  People disappear all the time because of that. Hot springs will boil you up in less than a minute, and the acidic pool will dissolve you.  There'll be nothing left."   


They left soon after.  Chalked it up to a missing person's case.   


I just sat in silence. It wasn't until the next morning I had the courage to step out.   


When I gathered up and packed my remaining things to put in the car, that's when I saw it on the passenger seat of my Toyota Corolla.  It was a hunter's knife, placed neatly on the seat and it shined menacingly back at me.  It reeked of alcohol.  I shook while trying to put my keys in the ignition and swerved onto the main road, leaving the cabin alone with its silence.   


The moment I arrived at my friend's house in Wyoming I told them everything I knew.  I told them about New Zealand out of respect for him and that he wanted them to know he loved them.  They just sighed and thanked me for the information.  I haven't contacted them since and I think they preferred it that way.   


I never made it to Malibu, nor do I intend to head that out west again.  I instead took the south route home and headed up north from Georgia.  On my way home, right at the border of Wyoming, I stopped at a gas station.  That's when I heard a chuckle as I filled my tank.   


"Putcha," a woman said softly right next to a man beside her.  It sounded like she was calling him "dear" or "sweetheart", but something was off about it.     


They walked by my car and he chuckled, "Hot spring." They then broke into giggles and something about it set me off.  That whatever was left of my friend,  there wouldn't be a body.   


I couldn't get out of there faster.  I became a hermit and kept to my studies far away from that place.  But it didn't matter.  Whoever realized I don't pry tried to taunt me in my purgatory.  They sent an anonymous letter addressed to me that an eruption could start at Yellowstone with the help of nuclear bombs. I just crumpled it up and it remained in my hand until I regained my senses and placed it on my desk.  It is now that I realize I have a bound contract with my silence.  It sounds so strange when you first imagine it. But it's only when you get sucked into the madness that you can see it for what it truly is.  Whatever you want to chalk this up as, I don't go to Yellowstone.  Not anymore.
