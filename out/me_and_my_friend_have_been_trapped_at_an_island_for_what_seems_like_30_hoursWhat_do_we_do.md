After grieving.We Sat there.Thinking what do we do?.We heard Something in the water.We ran with the rocks again.It Was A huge Tuna.We threw rocks at it and killed it.It's Remains Came to the beach.Me and my friend were happier than ever.We cooked and ate it.  
  
We had a plan after that.One sleeps.Other Guards.We changed every 1-4 hours.We finally got some sleep.We wondered if the time had moved.We checked our phones.Which were at small battery percentage.The time Said: 00:04.we yelled out loud."DAMN IT".We were mad and Very violent Because.What seemed like 15 hours of guarding/sleeping.Hasn't even been a minute.  
  
When we stopped.Something Grabbed the bones of the tuna fish.WE both hid in our cabins.We looked out the doors.It was a weird White Standing creature.It's teeth were Unimaginably Sharp.Its Mouth Around 6 inches open.Its eyes Looking directly at my friends Cabin.It screamed so loud we had to cover our ears.because of my hard movement which im known for.It heard me.It Ran so fast it looked like It just teleported.It was looking and looking at my cabin.Until it rushed trough the door.I hid Down and because it was still dark.It couldnt see me.  
  
It Looked around until Ive had enough and Hit it with two rocks i hid.Right in both eyes.It started Screaming and having Heavy movement.Wobbling etc.  
  
As the creature screamed and writhed in pain, I seized the opportunity to gather my wits and devise a plan. Despite its agony, the creature seemed resilient and dangerous. I knew that I had to act swiftly to protect myself and my friend.  
  
With the creature temporarily incapacitated, I whispered urgently to my friend to stay hidden and quiet. I crept towards the creature, careful not to make any noise that could alert it to my presence. Its piercing screams filled the air, making it difficult to focus, but I remained determined.  
  
Searching the cabin quickly, I grabbed anything I could use as a weaponâ€”a sturdy wooden chair leg, a broken broom handle, and a pocket knife. Equipped with these makeshift tools, I steeled myself for the confrontation ahead.  
  
As the creature continued its frenzied movements, I positioned myself strategically, ensuring I had a clear line of sight and escape. Taking a deep breath, I mustered all my courage and charged at the creature, striking it repeatedly with the chair leg. Its screams grew louder and more desperate, but I pressed on, fueled by a mix of fear and adrenaline.  
  
With each blow, the creature weakened, and I noticed its movements becoming slower and more sluggish. Determined to incapacitate it further, I lunged forward and stabbed at its exposed flank with the pocket knife. A gush of dark, viscous fluid oozed from the wound, and the creature let out a final, blood-curdling cry before collapsing to the floor.  
  
Breathing heavily, I stepped back, my heart pounding in my chest. The cabin fell into an eerie silence, broken only by the sound of my own ragged breaths. The creature lay motionless before me, its white form now stained with its own dark blood.  
  
I cautiously approached my friend's cabin, where they had remained hidden throughout the ordeal. They emerged, eyes wide with fear, but relief washed over their face as they saw me standing there, seemingly unharmed.  
  
"We need to get out of here," I said, my voice trembling slightly. "We can't stay in these cabins any longer. It's not safe."  
  
Agreeing without hesitation, we quickly gathered our belongings and made our way towards the beach. The night air was thick with an oppressive darkness, making it difficult to see more than a few feet ahead. We relied on our instincts and the distant sound of crashing waves to guide us towards the shore.  
  
Once we reached the beach, we took a moment to catch our breath and assess our situation. The creature, though temporarily defeated, still lingered in our thoughts. We knew we couldn't stay on the island any longer. We needed to find a way to escape.
