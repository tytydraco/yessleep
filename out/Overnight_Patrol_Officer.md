I do not know who else to talk to so I’ve come to you reddit. Roughly a year ago I graduated from police academy and started my first employment in Scottsdale, AZ. I stayed there for about 6 months and then I was transferred to a station in Pima County, where I has practically the same hours as my previous station. About a week ago is was moved to night shift witch wasn’t too hard to adjust to because I live alone. Most of the time I was parked outside of a waste management facility running plates and doing the occasional speeding ticket. I never really talk to anyone much at the station, I like to clock in get my hours in and go home.

One night I was requested to aid in a car-chase, I was pretty stoked because this had never happened before and felt like I was in an action scene from one in 60 seconds. One of my colleagues set out a spike strip to blow his tires, here’s a link to more info on that: [https://www.kold.com/2024/01/19/homicide-suspect-caught-tucson-area/](https://www.kold.com/2024/01/19/homicide-suspect-caught-tucson-area/). When I went home later that day I found 2 gunshot wounds to my sternum. I was very confused because I did not feel any injury at all. 

I must have had too much to drink before work because I kept seeing really weird things that I still can’t quite put together and no cars on the road. But as soon as I go home I’m just fine. It’s almost as if I leave a part of me behind every time I clock in and pick up a new one. Now every time I leave for work and go to my usual station, alone made you, about halfway through my workday, suddenly I have a partner in my passenger seat. Ive never seen this guy at the office and now he is just randomly cracking jokes in my car. His name tag said Erik Hite, I know that name from somewhere but I couldn’t put my finger on it. Same thing happened every day I went into work, you get used to it after awhile. One distinct feature I connect to him is he is not up to date on most things. He said that he was exited for the release of Iron Man 2 which confused and put me off quite a bit.

I asked around at the office if anyone has seen him around before and all of them ignored me and not even acknowledge me, I don’t know if this is some kind of prank or something and if it is its not a good one. The next day when I went into work I noticed he too, had apparent gunshot wounds. When I asked him about them he was confused at the question and said “what do you mean gunshot wounds? I’m as healthy as I’ve ever been!” I knew that he wasn’t messing with me by the way that he said it. Is he in the same situation as I am but just doesn’t realize the gunshot wounds? Or is he in denial of the whole situation?

Earlier this month is got in contact with someone who claimed to be the wife of Erik, Nohemy Hite. I started talking with her over Facebook about her husband, one thing that really weirded me out was that she always used past tense while talking about her husband. This is all the info I have for people guys right now, I will post an update once I find out more. It would be much appreciated if you good people could do more research on the mysterious people I have cited, since I still have an actual life so and I don’t have much spare time for research. All help is appreciated, until next time and you’re never out of the fight.
