I would like to share about my grandpa Kikong and a tale of him back in the day as told by my mom when I was 10. I never got the chance to listen to grandpa tell his stories in person that much, I'm afraid. I wish I had but he sadly took his final breath back in 2009. He had no regrets when he did, I hope, that's why I'm not too sad writing this.

What's so interesting about my grandpa, you ask? Well, not so much. Just that he used to be an "Albularyo" or "Shaman", the closest thing it translates to in English. We pronounce it by saying "Al-boo-lar-yo" altogether.



**What is an Albularyo?**

Being an albularyo in the Philippines came with immense responsibility. These albularyos used ancient methods and natural remedies passed down through generations instead of conventional medicine. There were even stories of individuals who sought help from medical specialists with little to no success, only to be fully healed by their local albularyo using methods like: The "Breath of Life" that claims to resurrect a recently dead person; A disgusting concoction of herbs and odd ingredients imbued with a spell which is supposed to be good for you; Or sometimes just a simple massage which may or may not involve calling the spirits of nature to help sort out whatever energy you have out of whack.

To put simply, a Filipino version of a druid or a warlock with a kind heart, often asking little to no compensation after helping people out in ways they can in their community. Traditionally, most albularyos were men. In the patriarchal society of early Philippines, men were often seen as the heads of families and community leaders. Since the role of the albularyo involved not only healing but also spiritual authority, leadership, and decision-making, it was more often filled by men, who were traditionally seen as fitting those roles.

Now, here’s where things get even more interesting, they are somewhat the "Witcher" of the Philippines. Funny as it may sound but I had at least 10 playthroughs of the game and I DEFINITELY see the comparison of an albularyo to a witcher. Yes, albularyos are the ones to be called if there's something spooky in the neighborhood. Your Witcher with no expectation for coin rather a chicken Adobo and steaming bowl of rice, if you will. Grandpa used to deal with ghosts, exorcisms and such, but he mainly focused on hunting "Aswangs" or the Filipino version of Skinwalkers. To pronounce it, simply say "ass" and "wang" coherently. There you go.



**Aswang, the Filipino Skinwalker?**

“Jusko, your lolo was very very obsessed with them!” my mom used to always say when aswangs were the topic of conversations over dinner. Lolo is grandpa by the way.

"Aswangs are very deadly" my mom always say. Emphasis on the "are" since some Filipinos still believe it to be real, my mom included. Aswangs, the type my grandpa used to hunt, can take a form of a cat or wild boar to covertly stalk their prey, children mostly. Most ultimately crave for human flesh but some prefer raw animal meat, for humanitarian purposes, I suppose.

It is said that some can be born an aswang OR turned into one through a grotesque ritual where an aswang decides to pass on their life essence, in the form of a small dark chick produced from their throat, to a victim who might be asleep or to forcefully jam it into their throat. The aswang who passed on their life essence slowly withers away while the to-be aswang undergoes a "metamorphosis" of some sorts to become a diabolical monstrosity. One symptom of the metamorphosis is you'll feel the irresistible urge to fly or climb up a tree at night. Especially, when the moon is at its brightest.

And just like a hardcore Witcher, my grandpa had his own set of "tools" for dealing with them. His most trusted weapons? A fucking bronze dagger, a vial of sacred oil known as "\_lana\_", and a sacred cloth inscribed with Latin prayers or spells of his choice (He had different ones depending on the situation). I really wish I knew more, but those are the ones I heard about the most of. The bronze dagger, in particular, is central to one of my mom’s stories of grandpa. She said that in one time of her life, it served a crucial role in protecting her from an attacking aswang when she was just a child.



**The Bronze Dagger Meets The Boar**

When my mom was young, she and her family used to live in this village called a "barrio" out in the country, far from the city. Just to picture out this barrio for you in the late 60s—Most houses were made of wood and bamboo, some of the richer houses were made of stone and brick; Roads within this barrio were still dirt and gravel; Wild variety of trees and grasses surround the place; And finally, no streetlights or even electricity! The only light they would see at night is either the moonlight or a gas lamp, or maybe a candle. It was a place full of relatively poor to below middle class people so what did you expect?

My grandpa used to work as a bus conductor that runs to and from the city. After every shift, my mom would wait for him at their tiny office nestled in the bus terminal. She would bring him homemade snacks or a full-on meal. She adored him so much, but not as much as grandpa adores her. Mom is the youngest daughter, before my uncle who's the youngest in the family. She was my grandpa's little angel, stress-reliever, his little miracle.

A short diversion to a wholesome story outlining why my mom is his little "miracle". When my mom was born, she was severely malnourished out from the womb and grandma was given the sad news by her midwife that she'll die within the week after birth. Her whole family prayed for her health every single day, every single hour, every single minute. They didn't want to lose her. Eventually, my mom got better from there and grew up to be healthy though a bit short due to the ordeal from birth. She said that years later, my aunts told her that grandpa did something to supplement their prayers, they never knew what. Might be a spell, a sacrifice, or a deal with whatever elemental he called for. We'll never know.

Okay—now back to my grandpa adoring my mom so much. She said he would never fail to smile every time she sees my mom after work. He would first give her a hug, carry her in his arms, then munch on the snacks she brought him. They would then walk home and talk about the interesting parts of their day. This was the routine they did every single evening.

A part of their route is vast dark forest my mom feared at sun down. She would head to the bus terminal walking through this forest in the sunset which felt harmless and some kids would even play in it. But the it terrifyingly morphs into this sinister place at night, especially when the moon light hits the tall trees' branches casting odd shadows on the ground. She was forbidden by grandpa to walk alone in this forest in the dark of night. Even if she needed to. Grandpa knew what was lurking these woods.

Every time they would walk in this forest, my grandpa would slightly unsheathe his trusty bronze dagger strapped to the left of his waist, placed inside his pants rather outside. It was old with age but not a sight of rust. He would never use it for anything else, only for "special" purposes. It is believed that only a dagger made of bronze can penetrate an aswang's skin or even hurt it. Mom said he would only fully pull it out if it heats up, meaning an aswang is nearby, stalking. Mom is deathly frightened of this forest but feels the safest with grandpa by her side but the sight of him threatened and clutching his bronze dagger, gives her the shivers up to this day. The primal instinct of a parent to protect their young is truly no joke.

One unfortunate night, grandpa's bronze dagger heats up in an instant signifying that an aswang is very near, 20 feet at least. In half a second, he pulls it out, looking around ready to stab or throw, while his left arm around my mom. "Show yourself, devil spawn!" He screams gutturally. "I know you've been following us. Leave us or get a taste of my dagger." Not a hint of fear in his voice my mom said. His face threatening due his slight berserk state, looking at all directions fearing it might strike from behind as aswangs were said to do.

My mom saw grandpa swiftly spin 180 degrees then throwing the dagger with such force that she felt the jolt in his whole body. She never got a glimpse of the aswang but the sound it made was audible. After the dagger struck the aswang, it made a very loud scream that sounded to be a wild boar. Then, she heard it fall from a high place signifying it was strangely up a branch while it stalked them. An orchestra of dried leaves crackling, branches snapping, and a loud thud was heard when it hit the ground below. She expected it to grumble as boars do but saw something chilling—she saw a \_silhouette of a somewhat humanoid figure\_ clutching its side briefly standing up then quickly running away deeper into the forest.

Grandpa nonchalantly walks to where it fell and said "**Fucking scum.**" He then knelt down to pick up his bloody bronze dagger just to feel if it's hot. "Dad, there maybe \_more\_ of them around." Mom says to him shakily. "Dagger's cold, sweetheart. No more of them. Let's get you home." He says with a calm voice. Then they go on home with safely and had a lovely dinner with the family.

The next morning, a neighbor knocks on their door and then asks for my grandpa's help.
