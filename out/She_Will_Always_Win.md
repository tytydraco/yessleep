It’s a very glamorous occasion today.

The first grand place in my first grand tour. Woo-hoo.

“Do you need anything?” My agent says.

No, I say. Just reassurance is enough in itself.

I play the guitar as well as I can. I came from the bottom. That’s my motto. I argue that that’s every rapper’s motto, though, but my agent insists that the people love a good rags-to-riches story because it improves relatability in celebrity life and blah-blah-blah.

The only issue with the tour is that my nemesis, a hip-hop soprano named Sticks and Stones, is here. That’s her stage name. It doesn’t even make any sense; her iconography is mainly inspired by the galaxy. Stars. Planets. 

My name is Stones and Sticks.

She says her name comes from her powerful rags-to-riches story.

Mine, I had told the journalists, was more complicated.

Every night I sleep. I possess. I have dreams about stones, spears, and sticks being thrown at me. Other times I’m standing on a stool, limping, being hit by thrown, angry tomatoes. When they hit hard enough against a surface—me—they explode into a million pulpy pieces that run down my thin-woven gray shirt and, most times, into my mouth. It always gets into my mouth. And there is always a man standing on his throne, looking down at me, disappointed, disappointed with his blue eyes.

Then, I jump off the stool. It ends.

I’m preparing myself to go to sleep in a Hilton Hotel room, the kind with massive coffee makers that dispense into styrofoam cups that my agent insists that it’s clean. I know that he did his job, because everything reeks of bleach here. He knows that I hate dirty things and weak materials. 

I hop onto the mattress and place my head against the pillow. The sheets wrap me in an overwhelming cloak of fluff that I know has been washed with the Bulky setting. Those devices are still as foreign to me as my dreams.

I have to sleep face down in order to not get sleep paralysis.

Today I have to sleep face up because if I don’t the air-conditioning will hit my sore Achilles’ heel. It’s always been like that, but this time I decide if I want to perform well tomorrow I need rest.

I look at the clock. My neck is fine enough. It’s midnight.

I forgot to lock the door.

I don’t even try to move in my paralysis anymore. It’s hopeless. Instead I lay there and enjoy the ride, trying to remember song lyrics from old shows that I have to rehearse with no-name dancers tomorrow.



*Edges of light echo across the caverns*

*A man walks into a tavern*

*Everything, one to another*

*Can we ever forgive the Mother?*



Each and every ending of each line in the chorus is drawn out. 

Someone open3s the door. Someone comes in.



*Our soulless creator*

*Forgotten, abandoned*

*We’ve all been a baker*

*We’ve been everything's maker (oooh, yeeeah. . .)*



The only source of light is the city lights. The curtains are closed\*,\* anyway. I can’t see the figure’s face other than an earring in the shape of a star that is hooked around her ear.

She says, “Tomorrow.”

I try to follow along in my lyrics. I try to think about the movie they want to make about me, and how my songs have supposedly redefined the next generation of philosophy and metaphysics.

She says, “You will not win.”

Shut up.

She says, “Did those tomatoes taste good?”

I stop. You got that from an interview, I say.

She says, “How does it feel?”

I say, what’s ‘it’?

“Stop lying.”

No, seriously. What?

“The tribe. Our tribes.”

Can you please leave?

“Your mom used to be an archaelogist.”

No. She was a historian.

“Yes, but she was also a housewife.”

I say, every mom is a housewife.

“Yes, but yours took the children to school.” She clears her throat. “The schoolhouse, I mean.”

I say, You got that from an interview. What did my dad used to do?

“Your dad used to hunt.”

Mine didn’t. Couldn’t. Not possible.

“Your dad also used to fight the Union. The Jewish. The Americans.”

Please leave. You’re scaring me.

“My dad fought the Confederates. The Nazis. The Vietnamese.”

She says, “He also fought the people in rock makeup. He killed bison and made us rich.”

She says, “Your dad signed false treaties and unknowingly gave the land over to the Americans, causing land disruptions.”

She leans forward. I will win.

“It was very hard to catch you. You used to be a good thief. But God condemns burglary.

“He condemns everything you do.”

I lick my lips and watch her as her blue eyes sparkle in the vague moonlight.

“Same job. Different day. I have to shred my guitar and hit the high notes on the microphone to incapacitate you instead of using a good arrow shot.”

She picks up my right foot. I have to hold in a screech as the air-conditioning blows against it.

“Have a good day,” she says. She walks away. I’m even more motivated. I will study  harder.



*I went around here and there*

*Going, chopping, killing bear*

*I came up from the rags*



I stop. I can’t go on any longer.

Instead, I dig into my pillow and tears flow from my eyes. I take a good hard whiff at the pillow. 

I know my agent will be mad, but I also had an itch that someone up there was very pleased.

Today was a very glamorous occasion.
