That night, I walked out of the small Sheriff’s office with a few answers but many more questions. 

Reverend John had been found dead in his office on a Sunday morning two months ago; when the few loyal parishioners who regularly attended his weekly services found him absent from his sermon, they’d made their way to the back office, horrified to find his shredded body strewn across the floor. Emerson and his deputy assumed, as I had, a small-scale bombing; but the particulars made no sense. 

Firstly, there was no one in town who had any grievance with Reverend John or his family. As unkempt and dwindling as his small church was, many in Penuel Crossing admired the man for his renowned kindness and honesty. Secondly, although the planks were charred and blown apart, the officers had found no trace of an explosive device or an accelerant. Theories had ranged from a freak lightning strike to a meteorite hitting him through the open window, but no evidence could be found besides the damage and the body itself. It had, for obvious reasons, been a closed casket funeral.

I also confirmed with Emerson that Ellen and Micah were indeed his surviving family, and asked for their address to pay them a visit.

The next evening, a Saturday rife with dust and wind, I crossed the highway and began walking through the winding dirt roads towards their house. From afar, I could see that the small homestead was in almost as rough of a shape as the chapel had been. As I approached, I was startled by the sound of Ellen’s voice calling out to me from behind, from the swaying stalks of wheat that billowed off into the horizon.

“Peter! What’re you doing here, can I help you with something?”

The young woman emerged from the field, wiping her dusted gloves off on her ragged overalls.

“Hello, Ellen. I wanted to come by and apologize for my stand-offishness yesterday. I hadn’t realized at the time that John was your husband. Please forgive my ignorance and my lack of condolence.”

“Oh, please, it’s no worry. I figured they hadn’t told you he’d been married, and I should’ve been more clear who I was anyhow. I appreciate you coming by though, I really do. It’s been lonely here, just Micah and I lately. Please, can I invite you in for dinner? Soup should be ready by now, and we’ve got plenty.”

I followed her up the steps, dusting my feet off on the doormat before following her inside. “Of course, I’d be delighted.”

I waited in the entryway while Ellen retrieved her son from the living room where he was playing. She beckoned me to the kitchen to sit down, and the two of us talked over our food for a long while.

I asked her how long they’d lived in Penuel Crossing, and if they intended to stay now that her husband had gone. Ellen explained to me that she’d lived there all of her life, as her parents had before her. Her late husband, on the other hand, had likewise been assigned to the church about six years ago, fresh out of seminary just like I was. The pastor whom he’d replaced hadn’t died, just retired. After he’d been preaching at the church for a few months, John became close to Ellen and the two of them were married a year later, with Micah being born a few years after that.

She explained that she’d never lived alone before. She had lived with her parents until she was 22, with a friend until she’d gotten married at 24, and with her husband until the last couple of months. “I know I’ve got Micah, but you can’t talk with a toddler the same as an adult. It’s lonely.”

“I’m sorry to hear that, m’aam, I truly am. If it helps, I’d love to come by and join you for dinner a few times a week, especially if your cooking is always this good.”

Ellen blushed. “We’d be happy to have you, Peter. Thank you.”

There were another several minutes of quiet before I asked her another question.

“I don’t suppose you’ve seen Nolan anywhere in town in the last few days? I wanted to speak to him some more about his, er, interesting biblical ideas.”

She looked quizzically at me. “Nolan?”

“Big fella. Rough face, bushy beard, big coat. He’s a newcomer in town, got here the day before I showed up. I figured, with the town bein’ so small and him being there when they found the McBride kid, he’d have made his introductions to everyone already. Last I heard saw him, he was going to speak with Emerson about the death.”

She sat back in her chair. “I think I know who you’re talking about, yeah. Saw him that day, just didn’t know his name. No, I haven’t seen him. He a friend of yours?”

“No ma’am, I hardly know him. If you do see him though, would you send him my way? I’m staying at the hotel for the time being, and during the day I think I’ll be working out of their lobby until Emerson can help me get the office at the chapel… um… cleaned out.”

By the time the awkwardness had abated and either party felt comfortable enough to stand and end their meal, it was dark outside. She walked me to the door, and thanked me once again for visiting. I walked along the long dirt trail back to the middle of town, my path ahead bathed in silky moonlight. 

As I walked, I heard a faint rustling in the fields a ways away. I turned to look, and saw a figure standing in the middle of the wheat. I froze; the figure wasn’t too far from where the child’s body had been found. Was it Nolan?

I crouched low, ducking behind the wall of grain, just high enough to still look over at the man, still unmoving in the fields ahead. After several minutes, I was able to see another figure moving through the fields, coming from the direction of the highway. Their movement was clumsy and stumbling, as though they weren’t accustomed to walking through the tall stalks. As the pair met, they began speaking, and I could faintly hear their voices. The approaching figure was a woman, her voice dull and rather irritated. I couldn’t make out the man’s voice. After a short and indiscernible exchange, the male figure appeared to hand the woman what looked like a stack of bills, and the two made their way towards the highway.

I silently followed, keeping to the dirt path and moving as slowly as I could as not to make any noise. As the pair stepped into the faint streetlight, I got a better look at them. The man, although not Nolan as I had thought, was another man I recognized, his red and sweating neck stuffed into a tight collared shirt- Clark. The woman, at most half his age, was wrapped up in a short red dress, far too tight. She wore tall heels and wore her hair in an obnoxiously poofy style. 

I breathed a sigh of relief. Although I was entirely disapproving of what Clark was doing, it seemed as though he had been in the fields to illicit an affair, not to commit murder. A mortal sin nonetheless, but one that could be corrected. I watched with dismay as the pair hastily crossed the interstate, entering the small hotel.

-

When I’d returned to my hotel room that night, I was further frustrated to discover that evidently, Clark and his solicited fling had checked into the room immediately next to my own. Even as soon as I stepped through his door, I heard the sounds of their sinful exertion through the already painfully thin walls. After several minutes, the noise stopped, and I was hopeful that I’d be able to sleep in peace. Unfortunately for me, not too long later, the activity behind his headboard resumed. It continued like this for nearly half an hour before I made the decision to make a noise complaint to the front desk.

I put my shoes back on, throwing an angry glance towards Clark’s room and making note of the room number for the front desk- room 8. The attendant in the small lobby was a young man with sunken eyes, reading a pornographic magazine under the half-lit lights. He turned his gaze up to me, as I was already leaning against the counter, tapping my finger impatiently. 

“Can I help you, sir?”

“Hi, yes, if I can, I’d like to make a noi-“

I was interrupted by the young man scoffing at me. “Noise complaint, right? Room 8 gets one every Saturday. Clark and that girl are in there like clockwork. He’ll check in for the night but they’re just going to be in there for an hour. I wish I could help you out, but you’re not the first person to complain about them, and you definitely won’t be the last.”

Just then, a tremendous noise came from down the hallway, an echoing crash accompanied by what sounded, for just a moment, like the roar of machinery. The walls and floor of the shoddily-constructed hotel shook, dust pouring through the cracks in the ceiling. Then, as immediately as the noise had begun, it was over, in less than a second. It was shortly followed by a guttural scream, one so piecing and panicked that I felt my stomach drop. I looked over to the clerk, who was already standing up with keys in hand.

What few other guests there were peered out from their doors as we ran towards room number eight. The screaming from the room had not stopped, but had softened, turning into a choking, wailing sob. The clerk struggled with the keys for a moment before realizing that something was pressing against the door from the other side. With my help, we managed to push open the stuck door.

The room inside was utterly demolished. Furniture of all sorts laid in myriad pieces, splinters of wood and cushioning torn and strewn about, blocking the door. The wall that had once been far end with the window was now little more than a gaping hole, planks and broken glass strewn outwards into the parking lot ahead.

In the far corner of the room, the young woman sat screaming, wrapping herself in a once-white sheet now entirely soaked in fresh blood. One leg sat exposed, or at least what was once a leg; now, everything below the knee was a shredded mess of mangled skin, muscle, and bone. Her foot, entirely flattened and still bleeding, clung on only by a few stringy tendons. 

I rushed over to help her, but tripped over something in the frayed mess on the floor, narrowly catching myself from falling headfirst into a pile of sharply broken wood. I turned to see what he’d tripped over, uncovering it from the similarly-bloodied sheets strewn over and around what was once a bed. When the sheet was haphazardly removed and I could finally see who lie beneath, I could hardly stop myself from vomiting.

Clark’s body was entirely destroyed. Beneath the shredded linen, skewered with furniture shards and box springs, his corpse so fresh that spurts of blood still pumped from the hundreds of torn wounds. Every limb was tucked at impossible angles around the upper torso, which itself was twisted and folded nearly in half. His midsection was flattened entirely, his entrails haphazardly squeezing out from either side of him and tangled in the mess. The skin on his stomach was blackened and tight. I stepped away from the body once more to aid the young woman. I couldn’t bear to look at Clark’s shattered form any longer; he looked like roadkill.

By the time Sheriff Emerson arrived, the young clerk and I had wrapped the woman’s leg in a bedsheet to stop the bleeding, and had cleared much of the drywall and rubble out of the way to make a path for a stretcher. 

“We don’t have paramedics here,” the sheriff explained. “I went ahead and called the nearest city, but they’re a forty-five minute drive out, maybe forty if they hurry. What the hell happened here?“

I surveyed the scene, finally letting his shock subside and his curiosity take over.

“Looks like a truck, or something big at least, ran down the wall and ran over them both. By the state of Clark, looks like he might’ve been dragged through the rubble by the tires…”

Emerson squinted, rubbing the stubble on his chin with his knobby hands. “I thought so too at first, but look. Look at the wall.”

My attention once more rose to the wall, trying to make sense of whatever detail the sheriff had gleaned from its demolished beams and scattered drywall chunks. I was about to say that I didn’t understand the sheriff’s meaning, when the realization struck me: all of the debris from the wall itself was cast outside of the hotel, not inwards. I looked back up at the Emerson, who was already giving me a look that said “you see what I mean?”

“But that’s… that doesn’t make any sense. I can see the tire marks, there had to have been a truck!”

“I know. But whatever tore up the room didn’t come from outside, it came from in here, breaking down the wall as it went.”

We traced the trail of rubble and tire marks with our eyes. There was a clear “start” point inside the room, several feet from the door. They continued on, carving valleys in the piles of splintered wood and in Clark’s body, until they finally made their way outside. There, as suddenly as they’d begun inside, the marks of burnt rubber disappeared.

We stepped through the shattered wall into the cool night air.

“Peter, have you seen Nolan since I questioned him Monday?”

“No sir, I have not. By now, I’d assumed he’d already skipped town.”

“I thought so too, but I saw him on the way here. He didn’t respond when I called out to him.”

“Where was he?”

“Between here and the Ellen’s house. He seemed… odd. Looked like he had a lot on his mind, just staring out into the fields. With how suspicious he’s been, he’s a suspect now; I hope you understand, him being your friend and all.”

I let out a sigh. “I assure you, the man is not my friend. We’ve met only twice now, that’s it. I barely know him!”

Somewhere off in the distance, a bird cawed out in the fields, and the pair of us turned our heads to look. Against the shrouded sky, barely visible in the dimmed street lights, several crows flew out of the fields, disturbed by something large hunched out near the edge by the highway.

“Hey, you! You in the fields! Who’s there?” Emerson shined his flashlight out towards the source of the rustling. In the dim light, two glistening eyes stared back at me and the Sheriff, before standing up tall and swiftly turning to run into the fields. Nolan.

“There he goes!” Emerson shouted, and the two of us took off in pursuit.

Within seconds, Nolan’s large frame vanished into the swaying darkness of the fields, swallowed by the shifting walls of wheat. Only the heady rhythm of his footsteps gave any indication where he was going, fading and reappearing as the stalks bent and swayed. Emerson barreled ahead with his flashlight high, the pale beam searching erratically across the grain. I followed close behind, the brittle stalks snapping against my coat as I pushed through. Every so often, we caught a glimpse of movement ahead; always just a glance of a bobbing head or a hunched frame, fleeting before it sank back into golden shadows of the fields. Nolan was always just far enough ahead to stay out of sight.

My lungs burned, each breath labored against the cold, dry air. I slowed, letting Emerson pull several yards ahead, the sheriff’s flashlight bobbing the blackness getting further and further away. The beam jumped from side to side, searching for something to anchor to.

As my breath returned, I took a deep breath through my nose. I almost choked on a sharp and acrid scent cutting through the smell of dust and dry stalks. I froze mid-breath, nostrils flaring. That same harsh chemical tang I had smelled the night they found the child, rising from dry soil that should smell like barley and dust. The air felt suddenly heavier, thicker, as if I were breathing through wet cloth.

I opened my mouth to call to Emerson, but stopped. Ahead of me, the sheriff’s stride broke. Emerson pitched forward, vanishing into the wheat as if the earth itself had swallowed him. One moment he was there; the next, gone. His flashlight tumbled into the grain, the beam swinging wildly once before also cutting out, leaving only darkness and the faint rustle of disturbed stalks.

“Emerson, you alright?”

There was no response. 

I steadily walked ahead, expecting to stumble over Emerson’s fainted body in the wheat, but there was nothing. After a few moments alone in the dark, my eyes adjusted to see something just ahead in the dimming moonlight; the green tractor, half-sunk into the ground. Beside it, silent and still, stood Nolan. His hands were in his pockets as he stared at the soil with an unsettling focus.

I approached nervously. 

“It… it was you, wasn’t it? You really did murder that poor child and bury him out here.”

Nolan stood still, his large silhouette stark against the pale grain. I could now see what his eyes were locked onto; the disturbed hole in the ground, the hole that he’d instructed the other men to dig in order to pull the body out of the soil.

I spoke once more. “Clark was right, wasn’t he? You killed the boy and tried to bury him out here. Then- then tonight you killed Clark so he wouldn’t talk. I don’t know how you did it, but you did.”

Nolan sighed.

“I’m not responsible for those deaths. I know how it looks, Peter, but there’s an… inevitability to this place. A certainty in death, even if it wasn’t certain just yet. Does it matter, Peter? If it’s going to happen then, does it matter if it happens now? Or all at once?”

I stepped forward. “Do you hear yourself? Do you hear how insane you sound? Sheriff! Emerson, where’d you go!?”

Emerson, if he was still present, remained silent. 

Nolan sighed. “Help should be coming soon enough, but Emerson is gone. It’s just you and me. Soon it’ll just be you. I’m not here to hurt anyone, I promise you, but I needed to watch it happen.”

I took another step forward. “‘Watch it happen’? What, so you didn’t kill them, but you did know they were going to die and didn’t do anything? Why?”

“Because I can’t. I just can’t. If I step in, I have to leave. I wish it wasn’t that way, but it is.“

I could not contain my anger any longer. With a shout, I charged Nolan, slamming into him hard enough to drive us both into the stalks. The wheat thrashed and snapped beneath us as we slammed the ground. Nolan’s hands came up fast, one locking around my shoulder, the other bracing against my chest, trying to shove me away. I swung back, clawing for leverage, my breath hot and ragged as I screamed.

“How did you do it?! How did you kill Clark?”

We rolled through the dirt, each trying to get the upper hand. Nolan moved with a measured strength, every shift of his weight deliberate, but I was all fury and momentum, fueled by pure conviction. The grain bent and broke under us, the ground uneven beneath our boots. Once, Nolan tried to twist away, but I latched onto his coat, dragging him back down with a grunt. Nolan groaned.

“Peter! Stop this! I’m not the enemy!”

My knee drove into Nolan’s ribs; Nolan grunted, wrenching himself free just long enough to shove me off balance. I came right back at him, knocking the wind from Nolan’s lungs. In the dim moonlight, our shadows tangled like one shape, thrashing in the field.

Finally, with a surge of strength, Nolan hooked his boot against my hip and kicked, sending me stumbling backward into the wheat. I landed hard, the air bursting from my chest.

“Stop this! You need to trust me, Peter.”

I groaned, clutching his bruised side. “I… I can’t. I don’t.”

As I lunged forward once more, the chemical scent overpowered me, sharp and stinging in my nostrils. My next step, intended to plant firmly on solid ground, gave way entirely, my leg plunging downward. The earth seemed to dissolve beneath me, the dry stalks vanishing into nothing. In an instant, I was swallowed whole, falling into frigid water. The shock stole the breath from my lungs in a searing gasp as icy currents closed over my head, gripping my body firmly. It was as if the water had risen from nowhere, summoned from the dry soil to swallow me whole. 

The darkness of the sky above was replaced by a blinding light, a shining white that peered from above the surface, burning through the wavering ceiling of the water. I kicked upward toward it, arms straining, but my heavy coat and shoes prevented me from ascending as I sunk deeper. My movements slowed, each one more difficult than the last, until I could feel the water seeping into me, filling my lungs and pressing against my ribs. I sunk further beneath the surface, my consciousness slipping with every second as panic pounded through my heart.

Dancing above me, mixed in the swirling caustics, I saw a shifting, radiant form; vast, luminous shapes folding and unfolding like wings made of light itself. It bent and shimmered with the slow ebbing of the water, casting shadows that rippled like a kaleidoscope. Countless glimmers traced perfect, impossible arcs around it, moving with a circular precision my mind could not follow, the sight gnawing at the edges of thought as the last of my awareness slipped away.

Without warning, a hand plunged into the water; a rough, scarred hand. Nolan’s hand. It reached out, grabbing me by the collar and pulling me out of the icy water and back into the dry darkness of the ground.

I sat, rubbing the stinging wetness out of my eyes and coughing up water, before trying and failing to regain my composure. There was no water, save for that soaking my clothes, and Nolan was nowhere to be seen. Neither was Emerson.

As I coughed up the last of the water, the edges of his vision became fuzzy, growing darker while my head throbbed with pain. As I lost consciousness, I swore I heard a familiar voice calling out to me, the voice of Ellen.

-

When I awoke the next day in the hospital, Ellen was by my side. She looked tired, her hair pulled back hastily, and there was dirt on the cuffs of her sleeves. She told me that Nolan had visited her that evening, not long after I’d left. He had told her plainly that something bad was going to happen to me out in the fields that night, and that she needed to be there to help me. There was no further explanation given, and he left. 

When she’d found me unconscious among the wheat, she’d run for help, flagging down the ambulance that had just arrived to pick up the mangled prostitute. She had insisted, to the point of argument, that they could surely make room for a nearly drowned man. They never found Emerson. 

I thanked her for her kindness and for saving my life. I also told her, with great regret, that I would not be able to attend the dinners she’d so warmly invited me to. After everything, I would be leaving Penuel Crossing, and he had no intention of ever returning.

It was thirty years later when I did return, though. For her funeral.

On the day before the burial last week, I found myself driving into a city that had devoured the town I once knew. A new interstate cut through the land where the wheat used to sway, and the air smelled faintly of asphalt and exhaust instead of dust and sun-warmed grain. As the intersection site between the two interstates, Penuel Crossing had naturally grown tenfold. The endless amber fields had been scraped away, replaced by glassy office buildings, chain restaurants, and neat grids of cheap apartments. I had to search his memory to place where her old house had stood, now somewhere beneath a parking lot.

I checked into a large hotel, not far from where that sunken tractor might’ve been thirty years prior. The young clerk behind the counter was aloof, reminding me uncomfortably of the one from that night so long ago. The boy barely looked up from his newspaper as he handed over the keycard to my room.

I asked if he could borrow the newspaper for just a moment, as the headline caught my eye. The article wrote about several unsecured propane tanks that had tumbled from a truck on a construction site the week prior, and had ruptured in the empty lot, where an old local church had recently been demolished. No one was reported injured, though the article mentioned unexplainable traces of blood and splintered wood found at the scene.

I returned the paper, pocketed the room key and began my walk to the elevator. Halfway down the corridor, a sharp, familiar scent curled into my nostrils. It stopped me in his tracks. I knew the scent by name now, though all those years ago it had been only a strange, stinging note in the air. Chlorine.

Drawn by it, I followed the smell until I found its source: a glass door leading to the small indoor pool. A worker in overalls was finishing up his work, skimming the pale blue water with a long-handled net. The room was bright and sterile, echoing faintly under the hum of the overhead lights. I lingered by the doorway, even after the worker had left. 

I watched, eyes fixed on the empty pool and the blinding, glittering lights it reflected. I looked on, transfixed, as something stirred beneath the water, for just a moment before the water went still once more. Several stalks of wheat bubbled to the surface.
