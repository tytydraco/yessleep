" *I don't know what to do...The noise isn't stopping!..."*

"*Wait, I'm-I'm coming! Hang on!"*

"*It's...It's...It's getting louder! The thumping and banging is increasing!"*

\*\*\*

Okay, first up and all! I understand the doubts people may have with...with paranormal experiences, but sometimes I'm sure you can tell the difference between false and true, right ? So I decided to share this...It's not one of my own experiences, it's my friend's. But I know she tell truths, she just isn't the type of person to lie...

Well, it all started when my friend's parents were going to a funeral. They left her behind with her grandmother, because they thought she wasn't going to come to the funeral, as well. But hours on and so later, her grandma also got ready and went to visit the funeral, meaning she was left alone in the house. My friend told me hoe she just watched TV, ate something, and then brushed her teeth, because it was already night that time, and feel asleep in her bedroom.

After sometimes, there was some loud banging noise on the door. It was so loud that my friend ( who is a deep-sleeper) woke and startled by the noise. At first she though it was probably her parents and grandmother, being back from the funeral. But then she realized, that her parents told her they wouldn't be back 'till midnight.

Now, that gave her a real scare. Who was at the door? She didn't get up from her bed and go check on the door, she just hid under her covers. (I mean, I get her.) The banging seemed to get heavier and louder at ever second. She described to me as being " on the edge of her life". It must have been that scary...But what happened later on was even more disturbing...

Suddenly, that terrifying banging that made you feel like it was the devil at the door, suddenly just...just stopped? It just stopped and became quiet. My friend started calming down, but she was still breathing hard. She thought about maybe texting her friend over.

*"Hey...uh...can you come over?"*

*" Why? Are you okay?"*

*"Uhhh....it's nothing. Just feeling little lonely?"*

*" Alright, then. I'll come over in a sec!"*

*" Thanks! Bye-"*

**CRASH!**

Something in the kitchen...fell? My friend sat right up under the covers. Suddenly there was booming and knocking on the kitchen windows! At the same time, the thumping on the door returned.

Each crashing and banging felt like they were tearing her ears apart. It was that loud. My friend said she had a recall back to the day she said that *" Oh, come on! paranormal and ghost stuff are nothin' ! So like, if you do hear or see something weird or.. you know out of place, just know it's your imagination or just the hallucinations."* But at the same time, after the end of her recall, she wondered why it just suddenly out of nowhere decide to enter her head, just right now? Just right now at this terrifying moment? This moment which seemed scarier and more alive than any imagination? When this moment seemed to real for any hallucinations?

And she knew it was not her friend banging on the door, because she just texted her if she was at the door and already came, But her friend's reply was " No."

The banging felt like going on for an eternity...

What happened next was unknown, at least, it was to me. But my friend said that all she remembered was waking up to her parents and grandmother's voice, sign that they were home. She also described it as a " safe feeling..." the weird type...one that feltlike it'll protect you from all evil.

She also mentioned that after her parents were home, all that banging and knocking were never to be heard again...
