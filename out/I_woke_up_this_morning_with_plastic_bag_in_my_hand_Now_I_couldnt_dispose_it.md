I woke up this morning tired, heavy, and strangely unhappy. No reason I could name. Then I noticed something clutched in my right hand.

A plastic bag.

Its handle bit into my fingers, damp with something sticky. A faint trail of red dripped onto the floorboards. My breath caught.

I did not know how it got there. Maybe someone slipped it into my hand as a prank. Maybe not.

Curiosity gnawed at me. I told myself I would only take a quick peek, then move on.

But the moment I looked inside, a chill shot through me. I cannot tell you what I saw. Not because I do not want to, but because you might judge me.

So I thought, maybe I could just leave it somewhere. Dump it by the roadside and let the utility crew deal with it. Problem solved. Or so I told myself.

I searched for an isolated spot, the perfect place to abandon my burden. My shoes left faint smears where the drops hit the pavement. I did not want it. I wanted it gone.

I tried to bury it. I pushed it into the dirt, tucked it behind a bush where no one would look. Out of sight, yes—but not gone. Hidden.

But just as I turned to leave, a man appeared. His eyes locked on the plastic bag with disgust.

“Isn’t this yours?” he asked, voice sharp.

“Err, no! Of course not,” I snapped back, guilt spilling through the cracks.

“I saw you walking here with that bag. It is yours!” His tone was pure accusation.

His face twisted as he peeked inside. Then he lurched forward and vomited.

“Neighbors! Look! This man is dumping his filth! Disgusting! A sinner!” he shouted, pointing at me like I had been caught red-handed.

I panicked.

Instinct took over. I dug frantically into the soil, ripping the bag free and bolted. Drops of blood spattered the ground behind me, marking every step. My heart pounded as if the sound itself were an alarm, screaming my guilt across the street. I did not look back. I did not want to hear another word from him, or see the disgust etched on his face.

All I knew was I had to get away, the bag swinging at my side, binding me to it in ways I couldn’t untangle. What’s inside the bag? I won’t tell.

Not yet. Not anyone.

Good thing I ran. If I had stayed, his voice would have drawn a crowd and I would have been trapped.

I kept moving, faster, until the street swallowed me whole. The bag swung at my side, light yet impossibly heavy. I thought I saw droplets falling from its corner, dark stains hitting the pavement, but when I turned to check, the street behind me was clean.

Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was leaving a trail. That someone could follow me, step by step, straight to the bag.

I wanted to throw it away. Drop it in the gutter. Shove it into a trash bin. But my grip wouldn’t release. My fingers locked tight, as if the bag had wound itself into my nerves. The guilt and fear that someone may recognize it… again.

It didn’t feel like I was carrying it anymore. It felt like it was carrying me.

Somewhere deep inside, I knew this wasn’t something I could simply discard. It had to be dealt with. Carefully. Properly. If I fail, it might return.

I needed help. Someone I could trust.

So I went to my friends. I told them what I could, though not everything. I begged them to help me get rid of it, begged them to take it from me, if only for a moment. Their eyes shifted as I spoke. Some glanced at my hand, at the plastic glistening in the light, as if they saw what was seeping through. Others avoided looking at me entirely.

No one answered.

And in that silence, I understood.

They weren’t seeing me anymore. They were seeing the bag.

Sadness pressed down on me. None of them could help. Their silence was louder than words. But maybe… maybe there was still one I could trust. A friend above all friends.

I went to his place. The gate loomed in front of me, tall and closed. I stepped forward and knocked, the plastic bag still clutched in my hand.

The gate creaked open. He appeared with a wide smile, arms outstretched. He pulled me into a hug, warm and unguarded. He was genuinely happy to see me.

For a moment, I almost believed the bag was gone. As he hugged me, the plastic bag brushed against him. A faint smear of red marked his shirt where it touched. He pulled back, eyes narrowing.

“What’s that?” he asked.

“This,” I said, lifting the bag. My hand shook slightly, and I saw fresh drops of blood trail down the plastic. “This is why I came. I need your help to get rid of it.”

He leaned closer, squinting, as if the bag itself was breathing. I held it tight, unwilling to let him see. But then I forced myself to trust. With trembling fingers, I loosened the knot and pulled it open just enough.

The moment he saw inside, his face blanched. He staggered a step back, disgust twisting across his features. Then he turned away, almost violently, refusing to let me read his expression.

He didn’t want me to know what he saw.

He leaned out, scanning the street to his left, then to his right, as if making sure no one was watching. His voice dropped low.

“Sorry, man. I can’t help you.”

Before I could answer, he slipped back inside, and the gate clanged shut between us. The sound echoed in the empty street, final and absolute.

What’s inside the bag that makes them recoil, that turns friends into strangers? I won’t tell. Not yet. Not anyone.

I stood there, head down and cried. Not loud, not wailing, just a slow collapse I couldn’t stop. The gate was closed, the street empty, and the bag still hung heavy at my side. Their silence had been bad enough. His refusal cut deeper.

I couldn’t believe it. I had come clinging to the last thread of trust, and even that was gone. Now it was just me and the bag.

I had to keep moving. My chest felt like stone. Each step dragged me deeper into the endless road. The bag swung at my side, its weight pulling harder. Fresh droplets streaked down its corner, pattering softly on the pavement.

It was heavier now, not just in weight but in meaning, as if it fed on the eyes that followed me. The whispers in my mind were louder than any sound outside. They think I did this. They think I killed. They think it’s mine to bear. And with each thought, the guilt gnawed at me, sharp and unrelenting, eating me alive from the inside, twisting my stomach, clenching my chest.

Houses blurred past. Faces flickered in windows, on porches, behind curtains. Some eyes narrowed in disgust, others lingered with pity, a few turned away too quickly, afraid of catching whatever curse I carried.

Strangers crossed my path. At first, they barely noticed me. But when their eyes fell on the bag, everything shifted. Mothers pulled children closer, whispering. Men stiffened, glancing at me and looking away. Teens froze, stared too long, then scattered.

No one said a word. But I felt it. The thought hanging in the air like a shadow. They saw me, and in their minds, I was something monstrous. I hadn’t done it. I knew that. But every step, every look, every silence made me feel guilty anyway, as if the world itself was forcing me to confess.

Then a woman appeared at her gate. Her eyes were wide and hard, filled with a rage I couldn’t name. She shouted, “Stay away from us and take that filth somewhere else!”

A handful of dung clung to her fingers, a few stray droplets flicking toward me. They didn’t hit me, but I could feel her accusation as if it were a tangible force. Her gaze didn’t waver. She didn’t see me as a person anymore. The thing inside the plastic bag made real, guilty in her eyes.

I ran. The street stretched endlessly, shadows whispering their verdict. The weight of their judgment pressed into me harder than the bag itself, gnawing at my gut, twisting my chest. Every step was a confession I hadn’t made. Every heartbeat reminded me that I was misunderstood, hunted by my own guilt and by their imagined truth.

How can I explain that I didn’t commit this crime? No one wants to hear me. No one will listen.

Fresh droplets of blood still fell from the plastic bag. I watched them, a mix of disgust, hatred, and hopelessness tightening in my chest.

What’s inside the bag? I’m sorry. I can’t let you know. Not yet. Not anyone.

I kept walking, letting my feet drag me forward, praying they would carry me to someone I could still trust.

Then I reached a corner. My chest tightened. I broke into a near-run, almost excited, almost afraid, as if the turn itself might hold an answer.

I scanned the road—left, right, everywhere.

And there, on the left side, an elderly man moved with quiet grace. His steps were slow, unhurried, yet steady, as though the world couldn’t shake him.

Something about him pulled at me. He looked familiar, not just to my eyes but to something deeper. For the first time in a long while, the weight on my hand felt a little less heavy.

I moved toward him, slow steps, hesitant, afraid that even this moment might betray me.

“Excuse me,” I whispered, my voice almost breaking. The elderly man turned his head with deliberate care, his eyes meeting mine. For a heartbeat, the world fell silent.

And then it hit me. Recognition. Relief flooding through my chest.

“Grandpa?” I breathed, the word slipping out like a long-locked secret, a release I didn’t know I’d been holding.

Tears slipped before I could stop them. Seeing him there, real, familiar, safe, was like a crack of light in the dark. For the first time, I felt a fragile relief. Someone I could trust. A family.

“What’s wrong, son?” Grandpa’s voice was gentle, steady, the kind that had soothed me once before.

My hand trembled as I lifted the bag for him to see. The plastic crinkled, streaked with red. From a tiny tear at the bottom, fresh droplets slid down and pattered onto the ground between us.

“I need help,” I said, my voice breaking, almost crying. “I need help getting rid of this.”

Grandpa’s eyes rested on me, gentle, filled with compassion that cut deeper than anger ever could.

“I’m sorry,” he said softly. “I can’t help you with that.” The words shattered me. My chest caved in, my throat burned. My last thread of hope snapped, and I felt hollow. I wanted to scream, to tear the air apart, but all I could do was collapse to my knees, sobs breaking loose like a dam.

The bag thudded to the ground beside me, leaking steadily, each drop marking my defeat.

Grandpa didn’t flinch. He just stood there, watching me with that same calm, unshaken gentleness, as if he could see through the mess of me and still choose to love me anyway.

Then, after what felt like forever, his voice came again, quiet but steady.

“But I know someone who can help you.”

For a moment, relief washed over me. A spark of hope.

I held onto it as I walked toward the house Grandpa had pointed me to, gripping it like a fragile thread. Each step felt uncertain, my chest tightening with the thought—what if they turned me away too? What if this hope was just another cruel trick?

The house stood waiting at the end of the path. Modest, yet quietly elegant, as if it carried dignity without needing to boast.

I hesitated, then lifted my hand and knocked on the door.

The door creaked open.

A couple stood before me, warm smiles lighting their faces. For a second, their kindness almost disarmed me.

I lowered my eyes, suddenly shy under their gaze. “Grandpa… told me to come here. For help.”

Their smiles faltered. They glanced at each other, confusion flickering between them, as though they weren’t sure what I meant—or whether they wanted to know.

“This is where they’ll reject me,” I thought.

My hand trembled as I raised the plastic bag, blood dripping steadily from its corner. I kept my head low. “Because of this,” I whispered, bracing myself for the sting of their rejection.

Silence stretched, heavy and suffocating.

I didn’t need to wait for their words. I already knew. I’d been through this before. I turned slightly, ready to step back into the night, ready to carry the weight alone again.

Then, softly but firmly, a voice cut through.

“Come inside.”

I stepped inside. For a moment, it felt like someone was finally ready to listen. Or maybe I was fooling myself, walking straight into another silence, another rejection dressed as kindness.

But grandpa had said they could help me. So maybe I’d give them the benefit of the doubt. Deep down, I wanted to believe it. I wanted to believe they might actually help me this time, for real. But part of me whispered it could just be another false hope waiting to collapse.

Sit here,” they said, motioning me toward a chair by the table.

“Tell us everything.”

Their voices were calm, steady, almost too gentle. I hesitated, words catching in my throat, but they leaned closer, their eyes holding mine. There was no judgment there—at least not yet. Just patience. Assurance. A quiet promise that, maybe this time, I could trust.

And I told them everything. From the moment I woke with the bag in my hand, to the stares, the refusals, the shame that led me here. At first, my words stumbled, hesitant, broken. But as their silence held steady, something shifted. Slowly, they gained my trust, and I let it all out.

When I was done, the room was quiet.

Then one of them finally spoke.

‘Let’s go,’ they said. ‘We’ll help you dispose of it.

My head raised with hope.

“We know a place.” the couple said.

We carried our tools. Shovels, mostly. The kind meant for digging, for burying.

The couple led me to the place they had chosen. An empty field, ringed by rusted iron wire, its edges swallowed by waist-high grass swaying in the wind. The road ran close beside it. Not hidden, not secret. Just an exposed stretch of land where anyone passing by could see.

The thought unsettled me. My chest tightened at the risk. But I followed anyway, because the couple walked with a calm certainty. They moved as though they knew what they were doing, as though I could finally trust someone to help me carry this burden.

We have arrived at the place.

We dug into the earth as if we were preparing a grave. The hole widened, deepened, its shape eerily like the ones I had seen at funerals. Each shovelful of soil felt heavier than it should have, as though the ground itself resisted.

While we worked, footsteps echoed along the roadside. A passerby. My pulse spiked, panic clawing up my throat. I froze, shovel in hand, praying they would keep walking, that their eyes would not fall on me… or the bag.

But the couple didn’t hide. They lifted their heads and smiled.

“How are you doing?” the man called out warmly, as if this were nothing more than tending a garden.

The passerby slowed, curiosity in their voice. “Hey, what are you doing there?”

My stomach dropped. The fear that had followed me all this way surged again. I wanted to vanish.

“Nah, we’re just helping this poor man,” the husband replied easily, his tone light, almost casual.

The words hung in the air, strangely comforting. For once, I wasn’t alone.

The passerby’s gaze flicked to the hole, then to me, then to the bag. My breath locked in my chest, waiting for the judgment, the accusation, the shout that always came. Instead, he only nodded.

“Alright. Just take care out here. Those tools are sharp.” And then he walked on, unbothered, his footsteps fading into the road’s hum.

I stood there stunned, shovel trembling in my hands. I couldn’t believe what I had just witnessed. No disgust. No suspicion. Just… normal.

It wasn’t me he trusted—it was them. The couple. Their presence made the bag invisible, made me invisible. For the first time, I felt the shield of someone else’s trust. But we weren’t done. Together, we continued to dig deeper…

We kept digging, the shovels biting deeper into the earth until the hole sank six feet down. When I finally stood at its edge and looked in, it felt bottomless, like it could swallow everything I carried inside me.

For the first time in a long while, I felt a flicker of hope. Maybe even redemption. This hole wasn’t just for the bag—it was for the weight I had been dragging all this time.

The couple smiled gently, their eyes steady on mine. With a small nod, they signaled for me to let go.

I looked down at the plastic bag. It sagged with its hideous weight, the thin film stretched and stained dark, glistening in the dim light. Fresh streaks of blood still slipped from a tear at the bottom, dripping slow and deliberate into the dirt. The sight of it made my stomach turn. It reeked of everything I hated—everything I wanted gone.

Without hesitation, I hurled the bag into the hole. It landed with a sickening splatter, blood spraying against the raw earth. The plastic tore open on impact, and the thing inside spilled out, twisted and exposed, glistening in the shallow light. The sight clawed at me, forcing bile to rise in my throat.

After I did that, I felt lighter. The crushing weight I had carried for so long was gone. My chest loosened, my steps steadied, and for the first time in what felt like forever, I could breathe. The heaviness had bled out with the bag, leaving me hollow, yet strangely free.

We exchanged glances, unspoken but steady, and began covering the hole with mud and earth. Shovel after shovel, the grave slowly disappeared beneath the soil.

When the mound had risen about two feet, the ground shifted in a strange, quiet way. Then, without warning, water began to rise from beneath, clear and pure, bubbling up as though the earth itself had decided to open a vein. It filled the bottom of the hole and kept rising until it stood two feet high, calm and glimmering, turning what looked like a grave into a pool of crystal.

We stood in awe, watching the water shimmer in the hole. Then our eyes met, and we shared quiet smiles, as if the sight itself was a sign of success.

Without wasting time, we continued shoveling, layering the earth back into the grave until only the last two feet remained. With one final effort, I hurled the last clump of soil in. A wave of relief swept through me. The weight, the shame, the burden—it was gone.

At last, I am—

Free.

I stepped back, putting three meters between myself and the hole, while the couple stayed behind, pressing the earth flat, sealing it for good.

I turned my back to the grave and lifted my gaze toward the sky. The heavens stretched wide and bright, their beauty almost unreal. A weightless feeling washed over me, as though I were finally unchained.

I closed my eyes, lifted my hands, and let the sunlight pour over my face. For the first time in so long, I felt alive.

By the way, you’ve been wondering what was inside the plastic bag, haven’t you? It was—

The chopped remains of someone I once loved.
