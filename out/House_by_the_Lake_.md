I was looking at the bungalow that would be our home for the next 3 months. My wife Marci found this property on AirBnB and took a real liking to it.

Even with the recent renovations, the bungalow had this old-world charm to it. It was probably built many years ago and far removed from the buzz of city life.

This beautiful home was on a secure strip of vacant land adjacent to a small lake.

The closest neighbors were at least a mile away. If not for the constant chirping of birds, the eerie quietness of the pace would have gone unchallenged.

And yet, the thick canopy of trees and the scent of earthy soil immediately appealed to my senses.

Perhaps, this will be the perfect antidote to my writer's block. The local ambiance could actually help me in my work as a horror story writer.

The house had a large backyard and was packed with different kinds of trees. My 7-year-old daughter girl Stella shrieked excitedly when she saw an old swing and started running toward it.

Stella is the light of my life. Marcy and I had been childless even after 10 years of matrimony, and that was beginning to put stress on our marriage.

Marci grew up an orphan, and her unhappy childhood saw her run from one foster home to the next. She always felt she had so much love to give and wanted to have a large family.

So when Stella arrived, my little girl not only saved my marriage - but also helped us develop a deep bond as a family.

As I saw her going back and forth on the swing, my eyes kept returning to an old well in the far-end corner of the property. I began to walk towards it.

When I got there, I placed my hand on the wall of the well and slowly leaned forward to take a peak. It was dark, deep, and emanating some kind of odor.

A weird sensation began to run through me, and I could feel the hair on the back of my neck stand up.

I could feel some inexplicable force working its way toward me. I felt drawn inwards as I stared into a dark abyss.

Suddenly I heard a ' Thud' sound and snapped back to my senses. I turned back to see what the commotion was.

My daughter had fallen from the swing and began to cry. Her cries pierced through the air, which made the birds scatter.

Marci and I went running toward Stella and helped her get back up. She had scraped both her knees from the fall and was bleeding. We patched up the wound as best as possible with some first aid.

Stella was still sobbing, gulping small breaths of air, even as the bleeding had finally stopped. Then Marci quickly put her moon-shaped locket around her daughter's neck. It seemed to do the trick. The crying stopped, and she began to fidget with it.

The locket was the only remaining link to Marci's past. She would clutch at it in times of stress, happiness, or grief. And then rock back and forth, holding onto it while getting lost in her thoughts.

We decided to take Stella to a doctor as a precautionary measure. As I turned around, my heart skipped a beat when I saw an old man standing in front of us.

He was in his overalls and had a look of shock on his face as he stared at Stella transfixed. He kept looking at the locket around her neck.

Going by his appearance, I assumed he was the caretaker.

I walked up to him, quickly introduced ourselves, and asked if a medical facility was nearby.

"There is a local clinic two miles east of here. They should be able to help you," he said.

I thanked him, and we quickly got into the car. The caretaker still in shock kept staring at Stella until we were out of sight.

Once we got her treated at the hospital, we stopped by a driveway for dinner.

There were a lot of things that were going on in my mind -

A suspicious-looking caretaker.

A water well that gives off weird vibes,

And a large house located in the middle of nowhere that is now beginning to look ominous! Something was really off!

Anyways, by the time we returned to the house, it was already late, and Stella had fallen asleep.

The caretaker was standing by the entrance. I could see that he wanted to speak with me.

Well, I had some questions to ask him myself!

But we were all exhausted, and I just wanted to turn in for the night. So I told him that we could speak tomorrow, and he reluctantly nodded.

I carried my girl inside and gently put her to bed.

Marci and I got to our room, and I finally lay down on the bed and fell asleep almost immediately.

When I woke up, it was still dark, but I could hear a muffled sound coming from outside the room. I closed my eyes and hoped the noise would go away.

But it kept ringing in my ears and refused to die down.

I got off the bed, opened the door, and walked toward the living room. As I got closer, I could see a pale white figure near the foot of a staircase, hunched over, back turned toward me.

Fear began to grip me.

I realized the muffled sounds were actually from a woman sobbing. She then turned to face me, and I froze in my tracks. I was looking at a ghost.

Pearly white tears ran down her face as she sat there cradling the lifeless body of my little girl in her arms!!!

My eyes suddenly opened, and I sat up straight in my bed. Huge beads of sweat were running down my face.

"Was that a dream? Was I dreaming all this while?"

I stumbled across the room to get to Stella. I ran through the corridor and opened the door to her room.

And there she was.

Safe and sound, sleeping peacefully - just like I had remembered the previous night.

I leaned against the door and heaved a huge sigh of relief.

And then, once again, the images from the dream ran through my head, this time in more vivid detail.

The pale white ghost sat by the steps; my dead daughter's head was resting on her knees, and she was rocking back and forth, weeping softly.

Her face though ashen white, looked vaguely familiar. And in her right hand, she was clutching a moon-shaped locket!

'Oh my God, Marci…'

In all that panic, I had completely forgotten to check in on her. I doubled back to our room, half hoping this was again a dream.

But when I entered the room, my heart sank.

Marci was missing. I went to check in the bathroom; she wasn't there either.

Just as I was about to exit the room, I looked across the window and froze in complete fear. Marci was there out in the backyard, slowly walking towards the well.

And standing next to her was the ghost who had appeared in my dream!

The ghost gestured frantically at Marci, looking to gain her attention somehow. So that she could stop her in her tracks.

But Marci looked like she was in some sort of trance; she was utterly oblivious to her surroundings and continued to march forward.

I could not believe what was happening. My mind and body were completely paralyzed with shock and fear.

Then the ghost stood right before her to stop her from moving forward. She waved her arms desperately, signaling Marci to stop.

But Marci just passed through her like a mist of air and she let out a wail of desperation.

It was at this point our eyes locked into each other. The ghost was looking at me while I was still standing by the bedroom window - transfixed.

She was Marci's dead mother. I had no doubt. She pointed her finger at me and signaled me to come and save her daughter.

Marci had already reached the edge of the well.

I ran as fast as my legs could carry. By the time I got to the backyard, Marci had already climbed the well’s wall.

I debated whether to call out her name and forcefully yank her off the ledge.

Instead, I slowed down carefully as I got closer to the well. I didn't want to startle her, which could cause her to lose her footing.

When I got within earshot of her, I caught a glimpse of Marci's face. She looked like she was possessed.

I slowly whispered her name. "Marci….."

She could not hear me or feel my presence even though I was just a few feet away.

Her gaze was fixated downwards at the depths of whatever lay beneath that evil well.

I haven't yet had time to process my own experiences on what happened to me the previous day.

I could only imagine the hypnotic effect it would weave on Marci. She defintely has some familial connection to this place.

And then, to my horror, I saw her step forward when she moved her leg. I lunged at her, wrapped my arms around her waist, and quickly dragged her off that ledge with all my might.

We landed on the grassy floor with a loud thud. I had managed to intervene in just the nick of time. I hugged my wife tightly out of gratitude.

"Alex, where are we?"

My wife had come back to her senses.

"What are we doing here in the middle of the night?" she asked.

I suddenly remembered about the ghost and looked around for her. She was standing 5 feet away, looking at the two of us. I could sense the look of relief on her face as well.

"Are you related to Marci?" I asked her. She nodded her head.

"Whom are you talking to? What is going on?" asked Marci, bewildered and in a state of shock.

I pointed to her mother.

"What? I can only see a well. Can't see anything else?"

I realized I was the only one who could see the ghost. The ghost seemed to sense this too and looked crestfallen.

I took Marci back to our room and waited until she fell asleep. I had a tough time convincing her that all this was due to fatigue and sleeplessness.

When I got out of the room, I saw the ghost standing by the door.

"Are you her mother?" I asked directly. She nodded back, teary-eyed. It must be killing her that her own daughter is unable to see her. No pun intended.

She then gestured for me to follow her. She glided through the corridor to reach a bookshelf in the living room. She pointed towards a large brown-colored book. I found an old newspaper clipping in between one of the pages.

When I read through its contents, I felt sick to my stomach.

The clipping had a photo of the Givens family. I immediately recognized Marci, who was around 4 years old in the picture. She was sitting on her mom's lap, wearing the moon-shaped locket. Behind them was a burly-looking man with a thick mustache

Marci's mother's name was Emily, and she was married to Mr Givens who was not only a wealthy banker but also an alcoholic. He used to regularly beat his wife.

Emily, trapped in an abusive loveless marriage, found solace in another man. And Marci was

born out of that affair. Emily kept this secret hidden, but Robert found out when Marci turned 6.

Just to spite Emily, he decided to throw Marci into the well. The ensuing altercation resulted in the deaths of both Mr Givens and Emily.

The police, the next day, found both bodies in the well while Marci was lying unconscious on the floor nearby.

Marci was later admitted to an orphanage, where she slowly lost all memory of her family. Her only remaining link to her past was the locket.

I looked up at the ghost of Emily, myself feeling a choke full of emotion. She smiled back at me.

A thought then struck me.

I asked, "Who is Marci's real father?"

She pointed to a small building across the window. It was the caretaker's quarters!

I later learned that the caretaker first worked as a teacher in a nearby school during the time of the affair. When he learned of their deaths, he looked everywhere for Marci, hoping to be a part of her life.

But the trail had gone cold. I guess that is why he eventually worked as a caretaker in the same bungalow as some form of atonement.

The question in front of me is, what do I do with all this new information about Marci's old life?

Marci has finally found happiness after a long time. She lovingly embraced motherhood, and our little family could not be happier.

So how do I introduce her dead mother to her, who is now living as a ghost?

Whom Marci can't see, but I can!

Or, how do I explain to her about her father, who is why she grew up an orphan in the first place because he TRIED TO KILL HER!!

And when is it ok for me to reveal the caretaker - whom she met only yesterday - is the person who is actually her Real Dad?

Will all this help her heal?

Or will it unearth hidden traumas tucked away in the deepest, most remote parts of her brain?

So the question that is still going through my mind is …

"What…. do I…. do?!"
