I don’t know how much time I have before the reception goes out again, so I’m typing as fast as I can. If you’re reading this and you work for the EPA or FEMA, or hell, even the CDC, you need to send someone else out here.

For context, my name’s Daniel. I’m a compliance tech for an environmental lab out of Boston, Massachusetts. Most of the time, it’s boring. Just paperwork, field kits, writing the occasional stern email about arsenic levels in somebody’s backyard well. Until this week, the weirdest thing I’d dealt with on the job was a raccoon nesting in a chlorination pump.

Then I got sent to Bellwater, Louisiana.

All I know is someone submitted a water sample to the state lab. There’s no paperwork, no contact info, just a test vial in a padded envelope labelled "Bellwater, LA". When the lab results came back, the report looked like a prank. Thallium. Cadmium. Lead. Goddamn perchlorates.

I still don’t really know why a compliance tech from Boston got sent to handle it. The official explanation was that the state kicked it to their regional office, who passed it to the environmental services contractor they use for out-of-bounds cases. That contractor flagged my lab, and my lab flagged me. I guess I was the only one with an open travel window and the certifications to handle toxic material on-site. Congratulations, Daniel. Enjoy the swamp.

The trip down here was uneventful. Flew into Baton Rouge, rented a truck, loaded up my field kit, and drove the five hours south. The road into Bellwater stopped being a road somewhere around hour three where it became a strip of asphalt barely wide enough for my tires, half-swallowed by swamp on both sides. I passed exactly one other vehicle the whole drive, and it was an overturned boat trailer that looked like it had been there awhile.

When I finally hit the town limits, I almost missed the sign. It was nailed to a rotted fencepost leaning at a 45 degree angle reading *"WELCOME TO BELLWATER – POP ???"*

I don’t even know how to describe Bellwater.

There aren’t streets so much as ruts in the ground, some half-paved, others just gravel and tire tracks between rotting buildings. One house is missing a wall entirely. Just open to the elements, with an armchair still facing a TV that has no screen. And the air here is thicker than I was ready for. Not just hot but *wet*. I could feel the sweat on the back of my knees before I even parked.

I checked into the *Driftwood Inn*. I use the word “inn” generously. It’s a cinderblock box with eight rooms, all numbered out of order, and a faded coke machine out front. The woman behind the counter didn’t ask for ID. Didn’t ask for anything. She just looked at me, smiled, and slid over a key.

“Enjoy your stay.”

The first thing I noticed when I got to my room was the damp. Even with the AC on full blast, the walls are wet, and the whole room smells like mildew. When I first opened the bathroom door to take a piss I found a roach floating belly-up in the toilet. A good omen, I guess.

After that, I didn’t bother unpacking. Just took the field kit and set out to get some initial samples from the water treatment plant before sunset.

Except there wasn’t one.

Google Maps had it located about a quarter mile past the church, near what apparently used to be a shipping yard, but when I followed the path down there, all I found was a chainlink fence wrapped in vines and a rusty sign that said *“NO TRESPASSING".* Behind it was a concrete structure half submerged in the swamp.

It clearly hadn’t been operational in decades, so I gave up and walked back into town, hoping someone could point me toward whatever they were using now for water treatment. That’s when I found the diner.

When I pushed open the door, everyone inside looked up at once. Full stop. Forks mid-air, chewing paused, eyes locked on me like I’d just burst in holding a gun and wearing a ski mask. Even the ceiling fan seemed to slow down.

Then, just as fast, it all resumed. Chewing, murmuring. One man tipped his hat. Another muttered, “Evening.”

A waitress approached with a notepad.

“Don’t get many visitors this time of year,” she said. “Or… any time of year.”

She smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes.

I ordered coffee, mostly out of awkwardness, and asked if there was someone I could talk to about the town’s water system. She raised an eyebrow.

“We keep it local.”

“Right… but is there a plant, or some kind of filtration…?”

“Clyde takes care of it.”

“Clyde?”

She nodded toward a man at the counter wearing a John Deere hat.

I asked if I could speak to him. She hesitated.

“He don’t talk much. But you can try.”

When I approached, he didn’t look up from his plate.

“Heard you do water treatment?” I said.

“Sometimes.”

“I’m here to do a compliance check. Just need to know where the town gets its drinking water now.”

He finally looked at me. His eyes were the color of silt. Not quite brown, not quite gray… and cloudy.

“We pump it from the well,” he said after a long pause. His voice was low and thick, like it hadn’t been used in a while. “Got a natural aquifer under the ridge. Real deep.”

“No filtration?”

“We boil it when it needs boiling.”

“Do you do regular testing?”

He scratched his chin. His fingernails were cracked and rimmed with something dark.

“Nah. No need. Water’s clean. Always has been.”

That was all he gave me. Then he turned back to his plate and started eating like I’d never spoken.

I returned to my table, where the coffee I’d ordered was already waiting for me.

I took a sip and nearly gagged.

It tasted like it had been left to stew in a thermos full of pennies. I set it down, fighting the instinct to recoil, and forced my expression back into something neutral. The last thing I wanted was to stand out more than I already did.

I pulled out my phone to double check the information I’d been given, but the reception was shit. Just one flickering bar, enough to tease me with loading screens that never finished.

Out of habit, or nerves, or maybe just needing something to do with my hands, I took another sip of coffee.

Same metallic tang.

Looking back, I feel like an idiot for swallowing any of it at all, but at the time, it was automatic. That weird social pressure to blend in. So swallowed it down without thinking, trying to look like I belonged.

It took ten full minutes for me to reload the satellite view of Bellwater, but finally I found a building labelled “*Bellwater Municipal Building*.” I figured if there was any documentation at all, it’d be there. Unfortunately, by then I’d finished the coffee. I left a five on the table and walked.

I found the municipal building at the end of a dirt road that sloped slightly downhill. It was a squat brick square and the paint was peeling in long, curled strips. The American flag out front had faded to pink.

As I approached, the door creaked open and a woman stepped out. Mid-forties maybe, in a button-up blouse. She stopped when she saw me, her smile flickering to life.

“Well, hey there,” she said cheerily. “You’re not from around here.”

I smiled thinly. “Just here on a compliance check. Water safety.”

“Oh, of course!” she said, as if we were old friends. “Well it’s been a while since we had a visit. Years, maybe!”

She hadn’t blinked yet. Not once.

“So… you work here?” I asked.

“Mmmhm,” she nodded. “I help keep things tidy. Records, forms, y'know. Bellwater’s not a big place, so we all wear a few hats.”

Her face caught the fading light as she turned slightly, and I stopped short. Her skin was gray. Not all over, but in patches, spreading up her neck like bruises under the skin.

She noticed me looking, and her smile got tighter. “Long day,” she said. “Humidity gets to you. Makes everything feel heavier, doesn’t it?”

“Yeah,” I nodded quickly. “It does.”

“I was just about to lock up, actually,” she continued. “Ready to enjoy my weekend.”

“Right, well I uh, I just need to look at any documentation you’ve got on water treatment,” I told her. “Records, complaints, maintenance logs. Anything.”

She hesitated just long enough to make me think she was weighing something behind her cloudy eyes.

“Oh, sure,” she said, her voice turning syrupy again. “Well, if you want to check the archives, the basement’s your best bet. Through the back. Just let yourself in. Door sticks a little.”

“You’re okay with me just…?”

“Oh, go right ahead! Ain't got nothin’ to hide. Water’s clean. Always has been.”

She smiled again before she turned and walked off toward the lot. I stood there a moment, watching her go. The back of her blouse was damp. Soaked, actually.

I waited until she was gone before I walked around to the back of the building. She hadn’t been lying about the door sticking. I had to shoulder it open, and when it finally gave, the musty air that hit me was like a punch in the face. Damp paper. Mold. Something chemical underneath it all.

I used my phone as a flashlight. The basement was a maze of warped shelves, rusted filing cabinets, and damp boxes. After some wandering, I found a cabinet labeled *PUBLIC WORKS*. It shrieked when I pulled it open. Most of the documents inside were the usual nonsense. Repair logs, notes about cracked pipes, bills for chlorine deliveries that stopped after 2003. All exactly the kind of boring municipal record keeping I’d seen a hundred times before.

But tucked in the very back of the drawer was a black binder with no label. Inside, most of the pages were blacked out. Not redacted with marker though, these had been photocopied that way. Whole paragraphs scrubbed into oblivion.

I thumbed through it slowly.

One of the pages was a scanned letter from Louisiana State Public Health, dated August 1998. What I could read said:

*“…following the incident at Bellwater Elementary, further testing is strongly recommended. Hair loss, skin lesions, and behavioral shifts in affected minors cannot be ruled as coincidental…”*

Behind it was a newspaper clipping from the *Bellwater Weekly*, same year.

*“Third Drowning in Two Weeks: Locals Mourn Another Loss”*

I turned the page to find a letter addressed to Mayor T.H. Ennis, written in looping cursive on yellowing lined paper.

*“I understand your desire to keep this quiet, but something is wrong with the water. The smell’s getting stronger and it burns my skin when I wash. My boy’s teeth are coming in wrong. He hasn’t been right since the school reopened. Please. I know what they told you. I know what they paid you. But if you don’t shut it off, more kids are gonna end up in the swamp.”*

I stood there with the binder in my hands, the taste of rust creeping back into my mouth.

This wasn’t just poor filtration. It wasn’t just neglect. There was something wrong here, something that had been wrong for decades. There was a reason the water treatment plant had been abandoned. A reason the records were blacked out. A reason someone had sent that test vial to the state lab without a name.

This was a goddamn coverup and I was standing in the middle of it.

That’s when I heard the footsteps. *Wet* footsteps. Slow. Heavy. Coming from above me.

I killed my light and backed into the corner between two collapsed shelves.

“…shouldn’t have let him in,” a low voice muttered. Clyde.

“Oh, hush,” said a woman. Bright and cheery. The clerk from earlier. “It’s not like there’s anything left to see. Everything’s been taken.”

“We don’t know what he’s been told,” Clyde snapped.

There was a long silence. Then the unmistakable sound of metal scraping against metal. I held my breath as the basement door creaked open, every hair on my body standing up at once.

Their footsteps hit the floor, slow and deliberate, squelching with each step. A flashlight beam cut through the dark, sweeping across the floor. I pressed myself deeper into the shadows,

They started talking again, but now their voices were low. I couldn’t make out a word of it. Then I heard Clyde.

“…he finished the whole damn mug.”

The woman laughed softly.

My stomach turned. I felt the coffee crawl back up my throat like it was trying to escape. The taste was still there in my gums, under my tongue, slick against the back of my throat. That acidic, metallic tang.

I nearly vomited right then and there.

Their footsteps circled closer. I could hear Clyde muttering again.

“He’s not here."

“Then we’d best get back,” the woman said. “It’s almost dark.”

The footsteps retreated, back up the stairs. The door creaked. Then closed.

I didn’t move for a solid two minutes. Even then, I waited until I couldn’t hear anything, not even the scuttling of whatever lived in the corners of that basement.

Only then did I crawl out and make a break for the door.

By the time I made it back to the inn, the taste of rust and copper in my mouth was unbearable, like I’d been chewing on an old pipe. I was desperate for something to wash it out, anything *not* from the tap.

I made a beeline for the Coke machine out front. Fed a crumpled bill into the machine. Nothing happened. I pressed the button again. Nothing.

I leaned closer, squinting through the cloudy glass to see if there was anything inside, and that’s when I nearly jumped out of my skin.

The front desk woman was standing right behind me. I hadn’t heard her come out. Didn’t even hear the door open.

She smiled. “Out of order. But there’s complimentary tea and coffee in your room. Instant. Real nice.”

I nodded slowly. Didn’t say a word. Just turned and walked back to my room.

Once inside, I locked the door. Then I pushed the dresser in front of it for good measure.

I tried to log into my work system using the VPN on my phone to see if I could access any documentation, internal memos, *anything.* But the portal wouldn’t load. The browser just spun and spun. When it timed out, I switched to chrome and tried googling Bellwater.

Nothing.

Well not *nothing*, but nothing *right*. A few towns by that name in other states. One in Florida, one in Georgia. No images. No wiki. No population data. Just the google maps pin.

I tried calling my supervisor back at the lab but got no answer. Tried the state line, the regional EPA desk, FEMA’s automated reporting line. Nothing. Everyone’s out of office and it’s Friday, which means I won’t hear back from *anyone* until Monday at the earliest.

I tried calling 911. It didn’t even ring.

My throat’s sore now. Dry and raw like the burn that comes right before a fever hits.

I have no idea what I’ve been exposed to, but if you’re reading this, send help. This is way, *way* above my paygrade and Bellwater isn’t just some forgotten swamp town. It’s hiding something. And whatever it is… it’s in the water.
