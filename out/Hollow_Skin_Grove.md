“So why is it called ‘Hollow Skin Grove’?” Eli finally began a few minutes into our hike.

“I don’t know,” Heather returned, “Probably named after a type of tree that grows around here or something.”

“What? That’s a lame answer—what do you mean you don’t know? Isn’t it your job to research the locations before we check them out?”

“Well, yeah, but the location names aren’t always the important part. Just because an area is *allegedly* haunted doesn’t mean it’ll be named after the legend.”

“Um, yeah, it does. That’s like 90% of haunted locations. Goatman’s Bridge, Amityville House, Gettysburg battlefield.”

“Okay, well, Goatman’s Bridge is a nickname given to *Alton Bridge—*it was named something else before it was ‘haunted’. Same thing with the Queen Mary. The boat isn’t actually haunted by the queen, dude.”

“Look, all I’m saying is that ‘Hollow Skin Grove’ definitely sounds like a location based on a local legend more than the local flora.”

Heather shrugged, “I don’t know what to tell ya’. When I looked into it, all that came up was mentions of it in online forums, and nobody had seemed to actually *walk* all the way out to the place to confirm what it was. It was all inconsistent accounts from locals about strange noises and figures in the woods. Nothing to link the name to.”

“Hang on,” Eli snickered, slowing his pace and placing a hand to his head, “You’re telling me that we’re walking *miles* out into possibly gator-infested bayous on the word of ‘inconsistent accounts’?”

“Look, Eli, we’re already scraping the bottom of the barrel here. We’ve hit all the big ones that we can afford to drive to, so unless you want to start funding plane tickets out of state, this is the best we get.”

My friend put his arms up in defeat, then crossed them with a smirk, “Alright, fine, fine. I’m just saying, we already drove 3 hours to get here, so it’d better be worth it. What’s one of these so-called ‘accounts’? Convince me.”

I saw a slight smirk appear on Heather’s lips, eager to finally flex her knowledge, “Well, like I said, there was a lot of the usual stuff. People hearing noises late at night; Screams, moans, *ghoulish wails*—standard ghost fare.” She mocked, wiggling her fingers, “But the thing that got me was the disappearances.”

“Ah. One of *these* spots.” Jackson finally queued in with a chuckle, “How many this time?”

“Allegedly? Quite a few. I didn’t look into records and stuff for authenticity, but there were a few people who claimed it and gave names, so there has to be merit. A lot of decent-sized towns surrounding this area, so it’s not unbelievable that the population could get lost out here.”

Jackson kept his hands stuffed in the pockets behind his overalls, but adjusted his shoulders nervously, “I mean, isn’t it possible that they just sort of… got stuck in the swamp somewhere? Fell into the water and a gator got them?”

That caused Eli to stop in his tracks, “Oh, come on, Heather, really? Is that what we’re walking into? I am *not* wading into the bog if—”

“Okay, would you two chill with the gators?” Heather rolled her eyes, “This area is clear; there haven’t been wildlife reports on crocs in a long time—I made sure of all that. You think I’d want to be out here if that were the case?”

“Hey, don’t lump me in with Eli!” Jackson chuckled, “I was simply pointing out the possibility that *maybe* those wails and vanishings were not so paranormal.”

“Always healthy to have a stick in the mud along for the ride on our paranormal hunting crew,” I quipped at him with a smug look, “Keeps us grounded.”

He flipped me off.

“Well, if y’all would let me finish my debrief, I could probably diffuse any skepticism you may be having,” Heather teasingly huffed.

“Right, right, carry on,” I urged her. I had already heard the tale that I knew she was about to tell when she’d texted me about the spot, but I was eager to hear it again.

“Thank you, Shel’,” she gleamed showily before setting her face back to its ominous glare, “So there’s all these disappearances, right? And that’s creepy enough—but get this. There’s this guy on one forum—and this area is super low-key, mind you; not the kind of place that people would actively just make shit up over like other urban spots. This guy comes in with this story about how he’s out in the woods fishing, right? It’s secluded, it's peaceful, and there seems to be a decent amount of fish, so he hangs around for a while and gets carried away till the sun sets to about where it is now.”

I can feel the hot, humid air around us chill a bit as Jackson, Eli and I look at the sky that Heather gestures to. The sun’s nearly set below the fingers of the surrounding trees, casting the world in that silvery blue haze that comes with twilight. That scarce hour between the hushing of birds and the waking of crickets.

A limbo where the comfort of day meets the unknown of night.

My excitement grew as Heather continued, “Now, according to him, he’s a rugged redneck type—the kind that doesn’t scare easy and certainly doesn’t fear the dark. But he says that as the lights start to dim, he starts gettin’ this eerie feeling. The air starts to smell rancid. And not like the usual swamp stench; he said it was pure rot. Dead fish and hot old meat. So he’s standing there on the shoreline near the water, starting to get a chill up his spine, and he’s finally about to leave but then—he hears a slosh across the way.”

Heather stuck her boot out to a spot where enough water pooled to make a puddle and dragged her foot roughly through it, acquainting our ears with the same sound the man must have heard.

“He looks up, and there among the trunks of the willows and water oaks that are sticking out of the bayou, he sees this man.”

“Oh shit…” Eli mutters, a tinge of excitement to his tone.

“He says from what he can make out, the guy looks normal; average size, plain build, hair not too long like he’s wild or something. But the thing that stands out about him is his skin. The dude is pale as hell and completely naked, just standing in the middle of a swamp before nightfall.”

“Oh, hell no,” I chuckled, the anticipation building in my chest. I already knew the payoff, and Heather knew that I did, but she indulged me anyway.

“Oh, it gets worse. Because the guy isn’t even moving. He’s just standing there still as a statue, staring, sopping wet, with his eyes open wide and mouth hanging in a silent scream.”

“What the fuck…” Jackson gasped.

“The guy who posted the story said that he just stands there, not moving, too shocked by what he’s looking at. He says the guy doesn’t move either. At least, not for some time. He just stands there with his arms out like this.”

Heather demonstrated by lifting her arms slightly from her sides and letting them hover there. Inhumanly. Uncomfortably.

“He said that as he stood frozen eyeing the stranger down and waiting for him to make a move, he focused in on his face, and that’s when he noticed it. He hadn’t seen it before because of the weird lighting and the distance, but the man in the water—his eyes were black like coal. Just two dark pools boring deep into him.”

Heather came to a complete stop in her leading, turning to face us with an expression to mirror the one flickering against the back of our eyes.

“He said as soon as he noticed it, and the flag finally went off to run, the man out in the swamp crouched down, sinking himself into the water until he disappeared. He said the last thing he saw as he snatched up his rod and ran, was bubbles on the surface slowly gargling toward him.”

We’d all been so invested in her story that we hadn’t even realized we’d reached the end of the walking trail, so all of us jumped a bit as Heather backed up without looking, sloshing into the water of the bayou until it rose to her knees.

With an innocent smirk, she said, “Well, come on in! The rest of the way we move by pond!”

Eli, Jackson and I all looked at one another, and with varying degrees of confidence, checked our waders, then sloshed in after her.

And there it was. With the finale of Heather’s masterful storytelling, I felt it. That shiver up my spine. That anxiety in my gut. That sweet, *sweet* adrenaline of fear that only the unknown could bring.

It was the high we all chased. It was the reason we did what we did. A lot of people wouldn’t fancy the idea of willingly going somewhere they thought might be haunted, but me? I lived for it. Ever since I was a kid, I was fascinated by ghost stories and urban legends. Things that people couldn’t explain or places that’s origins were borderline unknown.

There’s a special rush with the unexplained that you just don’t get anywhere else. A nagging itch that begs you to scratch it as you uncover more and more truths. That’s what always drove me into places like this. Dark forests and abandoned houses. Places so mysterious and dripping with potential that an entire county could make up cultures built around them.

But it’s always a double-edged sword. That mystery is great, yeah, but it only takes you so far. Most of the time, you get there, and after a few hours, the case is closed.

It’s all made up.

The forest really is just dark, and that’s all that it is. And that abandoned house? The detached footsteps you were warned of and ghostly groans tend to just be its old wooden joints creaking and popping.

The payoff is never as good as the buildup, and though years of running the same routine had yielded minimal results, it never stopped me from pursuing more. Because at the end of the day, the high was worth the hangover. It was fun to explore and freak yourself out with friends for an hour or two because at least the memories that followed outweighed the letdown of the lack of anything real.

I think deep down though, even though I often told myself that, I truly did one day hope to find a pot of gold at the end of that rainbow. Something real and tangible to show I wasn’t silly for chasing childhood campfire tales. Something truly paranormal to scratch that insatiable itch once and for all, whose mystery I could chase until the end of time.

Looking back now, I feel foolish for ever wishing for such a thing. For ever thinking that finding such a horror would bring anything good…

Our hike through the water began slow and careful, moving through the murk so as not to slosh any into our overalls. We’d borrowed the gear from Eli’s dad, and aside from wanting to keep dry ourselves, we really didn’t want to return it waterlogged.

“Shelby, can you pass the GPS?” Heather asked, leaning back, “As much as I’d like to pretend I studied the map by heart, we’re gonna get turned around fast with all the water.”

“What’s up with all this anyway? I thought you said there was a walking path?” Eli asked.

“Apparently there is, but the summer rains flood the bayou and bring the levels up. Someone on the forums who came out here said the place is more worth coming like this anyway—adds to the creep factor.”

“I hope so,” Jackson snickered, “This has to be one of the most intensive treks we’ve done so far.”

“It’ll be worth it, I bet,” I chimed in, “I’ve got a good feeling about this one.”

I really did.

Maybe it was all that prep and extra effort that made it feel like more of a grand adventure, but as the sun set lower in the sky and the space between the trees grew from that hazy blue to a dark, foreboding black, my heart thrummed faster. Deeper into the bog we went, further away from civilization and more into an unknown that so few other people had dared to travel.

Us though? We were going all the way. That was the plan, at least. Where so many other people had chickened out and never made it to the grove itself, we had the intention of getting to the clearing and seeing if we’d really find the mysterious man of the bayou.

Solid proof that all our searching wasn’t in vain.

We were grizzled veterans at this by now, and we weren’t going to be deterred.

Then again, maybe a grizzled veteran would have turned back. Maybe they would have seen the signs and got out of that swamp as fast as possible. Maybe it was so many years of that nagging itch that drove us deeper into those woods against our better judgement.

I didn’t start to feel it until the twine.

We had been moving for around half an hour, Heather guiding fearlessly in the front. Eli was behind her, then me, then Jackson heading up the rear. We’d flicked our flashlights on now that the swamp had become a dark maze of moss-tangled stumps and algae-ridden pools.

I held my breath each time I swept mine through the trees, caught in the middle of both the desire and fear of spotting a man nestled among the dark bark. He never appeared though, no matter how deep we went, and there wasn’t a noise out of place save the occasional heron song to join the chorus of cricket chirps.

That changed when suddenly, Eli went tumbling forward in front of me, nearly toppling into the murky basin if not for Heather’s back to catch himself on.

“Whoa—Eli!” She scoffed as water sloshed up behind her, sprinkling her back and pouring a bit down her waders.

She was mad, but once she saw the state of our friend, she stopped complaining. It was clear he got it worse. All of us tried to be sensitive, but we couldn’t help but crack snickers as Eli stood back up, water dripping down his face and shirt as he glared unamused.

Eventually our chuckles broke him down, and he started to giggle too, “Yeah, yeah, laugh it up. It was bound to happen to one of us eventually. There was no way we made it out of here dry.”

“Of course it happens to you too, man,” Jackson shook his head, “You good? What’d you even trip over?”

“I think a root or something. Whatever it was hooked my foot good.”

“Maybe it was this,” I offered, shining my light in the space between him and I. Up from the depths, a thin line of string had surfaced. We all gathered to look and saw that it was just simple twine. Coarse hairs tangled together and bound to make a rope just thicker than a plastic straw.

Heather reached out an pulled it up with a finger. We had gloves on, so none of us had qualms about touching it, but she still couldn’t hide her disgust as the string dripped with pond scum and algae. Beneath it, we could barely make out the fibrous bright white the twine once was.

“This looks man made,” Heather noted.

“You *did* say this was a walk path,” Jackson replied, grabbing one end and tugging. At first, we thought the string was simply loose, but as he pulled, more emerged from the water, going taught somewhere beneath the surface near a tree, like it was tied to the stump. “If this is a flood area, they probably strung these up to make sure people could still find the trail.”

“I guess that would make sense,” I nodded.

Eli hesitated a moment before responding, “Either that, or it was a fence to warn to keep out.”

That sent another chill across the air, this one much stronger than the last. It was night now, and though Heather’s recount was scary, nothing was more exciting than being closer to the grove, possibly finding the border that warned there was no going back.

Still, even though I bought the boys’ theories, something about the string put me off. It was unusually low to the ground for a guiding line, and though it could have slipped, it was also white. Wouldn’t something for safety be a more fluorescent color like yellow or orange?

Heather didn’t help ease the feeling as she spoke, tugging the coil tight again and tracing it with her eyes between GPS glances.

“Well, my money is on Jackson. The rope leads along the same path we need to walk.”

“That’s good to know. If we get lost from your terrible navigation, we can use this to get back.” Eli smirked.

Heather flipped him off before turning forward and continuing on, the rope still in her hand as a railing. Everyone laughed at the interaction and moved on, but I couldn’t give more than a courtesy chuckle.

The rope on the abandoned path in the middle of nowhere that *rarely anyone ever walked* led along the same path we were on. And while maybe Eli was right about getting back, to me, it felt more like it was beckoning us forward.

From that point on, the twine became our new GPS. Before, Heather had to stop now and then to orient us, but with the rope, it was always winding onward in the exact path toward Hollow Skin. Maybe Jackson was right, but the longer the rope ran, and the more stumps we found it lassoed to, the less it sat right with me.

If this trail was really so obscure and unknown, why would someone take the time to hang lines up around it? We’d been down roads far more traveled with fewer safety precautions.

Still, I didn’t say anything yet. Nobody else seemed bothered by the occurrence, so I left it be, lest I amp up the fear too early into the journey.

Turns out, I didn’t have to.

Our second omen to turn back came another 10 minutes later. We heard our first abnormal noise.

Eli and Heather were small-talking about the surrounding trees, pointing out a few bark-less types that could be considered ‘hollow skinned’.

“How is that ‘hollow skin’?” Eli snorted, “It would have to be a tree with all bark and no trunk; not the other way around.”

“Whatever! People name things weirdly all the time. Why do we call it a *driveway* when it’s where we park?”

Eli ignored that excuse and looked around, “These trees are pretty weird though. They look like regular oaks so why do so many have their bark missing?”

“Maybe termites? Or something about this area makes it rot off.” Heather fake gasped, then turned back and slapped his shoulder to a halt, “Maybe the skin falls to the ground and becomes—get this… *hollow*.”

“Boooo,” Eli scoffed

Jackson and I just sat listening to their bickering with amused grins, the only other noise being the ambience of our sloshing and the nocturnal fauna.

Then, it wailed out.

It was distant, yet too close for comfort; somewhere just off in the trees beyond our flashlight beams. A shrill, raspy whine. It was low and crackly at first, but slowly whinnied out to a steady tune after a moment. Like somebody slowly scraped at an untuned violin string.

 It was impossible that we imagined it because the forest heard it too. The symphony of the night went hushed around us, and our sloshing stopped.

All flashlights shot in its direction, and the four of us held perfectly still, not even rippling the water pressed against our pants. We stood that way for what could have been an hour, and the whole time I don’t think I heard a single person take a breath.

But then water sloshed from behind a tree.

At that, I let out a yelp, and Eli swore under his breath. All of us pivoted in the water and took a few steps back, but with the murk pushing back against us, we didn’t make it far. Whatever was coming at us was much faster, and we didn’t stand a chance. In the chaos, Heather finally managed to shine her beam in its direction to get a clear view of our attacker, and—

An offended river otter squinted its eyes as we rudely blinded it before ducking away from us and submerging in the water. All of us stopped our frantic thrashing and panted before turning inward to make eye contact. In our wild sprint, we’d all joined Eli among the wet and waterlogged.

Slowly, we broke into laughter.

“Alright, that may be the most terrified I’ve ever been on one of these expeditions,” Jackson chuckled, “That scared the piss out of me.”

“Literally,” Eli said, looking down, “you all may want to clear away.”

“Shut up,” Heather splashed him, wiping her own face and sighing, “God, when people said they heard things out here, I thought for sure it was just gonna be owls or some shit. What the hell was that?”

“There’s no way it was the otter,” I chuckled nervously. I was amused by the whole situation myself, but admittedly, I was still pretty freaked. “It came from way past it.”

“It could have been a bird call,” Jackson pondered, looking back to the shadows we’d heard the sound from, “There are some animals that sound creepy like that. Hell, even mountain lions at night sound like women screaming.”

“Maybe,” Eli agreed, “but whatever it is, I don’t think I care to find out. Was that a good enough fill for this trip? We all got a good kick of adrenaline and we’re soaking wet, so I think that’s a win in my book.”

Finally, having an out, I jumped in, “Yeah, honestly, even if that was an animal, I don’t know if it’s one we want to see; not if it sounded like that. I think I could chalk that up to ghost proof and be happy.”

“What? Seriously?” Heather scoffed, “Guys, we’ve already hiked for an hour! The glade isn’t much further; we may as well go the rest of the way! I thought the whole goal was to do what everyone else couldn’t, remember?”

Eli made a face, “Heather. Did you not just hear that? There’s no way you want to go closer to whatever that was. I was just going along with the animal thing to keep from freaking, but it was not natural.”

“It kind of sounded mechanical,” Jackson said, “like an instrument.”

“Okay, and so what?” Heather shrugged with a smile, trying to not seem too eager, “I thought the whole reason we did these trips was to find the paranormal, and now that we’ve finally got something truly weird, we just want to run?”

“Well, the real paranormal is a lot freakier than convincing ourselves we heard something,” Eli said.

Heather kept her face high for a moment, trying her best to still win us over with confidence, but when she saw that nobody was biting, not even me, she broke with a sigh, “Well, I’m still going to go. It can’t be more than 5 more minutes of walking.”

Sticking the GPS out, she handed it to Eli.

He shook his head, “Uh, Heather, no way.”

“What? I’ll be fine! I can just follow the rope back! I’ll be right behind you guys by the time you get back to the car.”

“No. Nuh-uh. I know what you’re doing,” Eli threatened.

She cocked her head, “What am I doing?”

“You know that if you go alone, we’re not going to let you.”

“No, seriously, I want you guys to go back to the car! I don’t want you to be miserable out here if you’re done—I just really want to know what’s up with this place.”

Heather’s eyes fell on me as she said that, and suddenly guilt weighed heavy in my stomach. I sensed she was being genuine, so I shouldn’t have felt bad if I wanted to leave, but it wasn’t that.

Like I said, Heather was ride or die—she’d followed me into more places than I could count, and all of it was for nothing. Now, here we were with something that actually had potential—something I’d looked for my entire life—and I was running from its literal call to adventure.

What kind of friend would I have been if I’d made Heather go at it alone?

“I’ll come too,” I spoke softly, a smile turning at my lips.

“Well, I guess we all go then,” Jackson jumped in, “We aren’t just gonna let you two get lost out here.”

Heather tried to protest, “No, guys seriously, I don’t want you to—”

“Yeah, yeah, so noble—thanks for the offer. Come on, ladies,” Eli sighed, brushing past us and following the GPS he now held in his hand.

Heather turned back at me with a beaming smile, then quickly faced forward, tagging close behind a grinning Eli.

I was happy they were smiling in that moment. Jackson and I were too.

I think it was the last moment that any of us ever did…

As we approached the glade, patches of land once again became visible among the oaks. They were mainly plateaus of mud and shrubs—nothing stable enough to walk on, but it was at least nice to see land again.

Eli was leading now since he had the GPS, but the string was still our guide. Its slimy, slick coat gunked our gloves as we tugged along it, shining our beams in every direction to make sure nothing caught us off guard again.

As we moved, that squeal on the horizon kept looping in my head like a bad song, making my skin crawl and itch the closer we got to its source. I imagined how much more chilling it would have been to hear it from the distance we now stood—only a few yards from the grove.

Ahead, I could see it. The trees got denser a dozen yards ahead, then beyond, opened up into a small pond the size of a neighborhood cul-de-sac. The trees had been ominous with our lights dancing between them, but somehow the open space was even more foreboding.

The still, algae-topped water could hide anything below, and with the fisherman’s story still fresh in my mind , I kept thinking about that pale, naked man with soulless eyes rising from the depths.

Before we reached it, however, there was one more stop. One final chance for us to turn around.

Protruding from the water a few yards in front of us, our flashlights skimmed across a small island of muck and pond scum; a plot of land just barely gasping above the surrounding flood.

The rope led straight onto the platform, but there was no tree that it was tied around this time. Instead, it roped onto something nestled among the shrubs that contrasted the dark muck harshly. As we approached with caution, I tried to make out what it was, but something paused our progress.

“Ow—shit!” Eli suddenly blurted.

We all hesitated behind him, and our heads popped out of line to see what the hold up was.

“You good, man?” Jackson called.

“Yeah, there was just a huge-ass thorn caught on the rope that stuck me. Punched straight through my glove.”

We broke formation and sloshed forward, gathering around to investigate. Eli held his hand beneath the beam of his light until one of us offered our own, to which he plucked out the pale barb that had stuck into his hand. It was a milky white, and straight like a needle.

I furrowed my brow, finding the color and shape odd for a thorn bush, then turned to check the spot in the twine that he’d got bit by.

“Oh shit…” I gasped, running my beam along the rope.

The whole thing was covered in them. They weren’t all as big as the one that got Eli, but beneath the mud and grime that had been coating the string, I finally saw them. Tiny little barbs frayed from their binding.

At first I thought the twine was just old and tattered, but the closer I looked, the more I noticed it was by design. The quills all furled out in the direction we’d come from, and as I checked my glove, I noticed there were several that had caught the latex but not been able to puncture. My breaths grew rapid as I hastily plucked them out and threw them away from me.

Eli and Jackson turned to see what I saw, then grew worried looks on their faces. Eli tugged lose his glove and looked down at his palm to find that the spot where he’d been pricked was already turning red and inflamed.

The three of us were so confused and horrified that we hadn’t even noticed that Heather had strayed a few feet away. Before any of us could commentate on the matter, she called out with utter distress in her voice.

“Oh, my God…”

The three of us turned to her, then looked past where she was looking. On the island, the pale objects in the bushes were finally visible.

Bones. More specifically, a ribcage. They were far too large to be a humans, but bones were bones nonetheless. Almost in a trance, we all sloshed closer, our collective hearts banging the same, dread-filled drum.

It was a cow, large and half stuck in the mud. Its legs had sunk beneath the murk as it collapsed onto its side, leaving only its top half exposed. Its neck ran in a jumbled mess of parts to where its skull lay half peering out at us, but all of that was only the parts that we could confidently make out.

Because while it was clearly a cow's skeleton, something was horribly, *horribly* wrong with it.

Scraps of flesh and fur still clung to bits and pieces of it, as well as a strange spongy, red meat, porous with holes and glistening in our lights. Its bones in places along the ribcage had seemingly grown outward, fusing together at spots to make solid bridges, almost like a barrel of bone and marrow.

All of that maybe could have been explained away by strange decomposition conditions or a birth defect, but what we couldn’t deny was what covered the rest of it.

Along its femurs and spinal cords were strange bubbles in the bone. Bumps like the burls on a tree. Half its skull was unrecognizable this way, a cloud of strange lumps like its face had boiled into a froth, then hardened.

Bubbles was a very intentional word choice, because that’s exactly what they were. Certain parts of the bone had cracked and fallen away, showing that the lumps were hollow. It was as if the beast liquefied, then hardened in a matter of moments.

None of us had any words, and none of us could move. Only stare down at the abhorrent thing glued to the swamp floor beneath our feet. I remember as we all tried to process what we were seeing, I could only muster one single, horrifying thought.

A body this decayed would have certainly been sunken beneath the water during the flood.

That meant it was fresh, and somehow still missing its skin.

“How… How did a cow get out here?” Heather muttered, “Why does it look like that?”

Jackson tried to bring us back down with logic. His comforting form of denial. Still, the frantic shudder in his breath betrayed his words, “I-It must have been a pasture cow that wandered off from a nearby field. The swamp gasses—maybe it fucked with its decomposition—”

“Swamp gasses?” Heather laughed with no humor to her tone, “Jackson, you’d need *nuclear waste* to do that to a body—what the fuck is this?!”

“I don’t know,” I cut in, “but we’ve seen enough. We need to leave. Now.”

Heather looked down at the body, with wide eyes and shallow breath, nodding in agreement. Seeing her go from so adamant to continue to downright petrified only compounded my fear; I had never seen the girl so afraid in my entire life. If even she felt something was wrong, then something was undoubtedly wrong.

Finally, we were all in agreement to leave, but even though we’d taken that last chance…

It was too late.

A sloshing from the clearing ahead made us all jump and stagger back, whipping our beams up into the shadow. The sprawling pool before us ignited beneath the ghastly white beams of our flashlights, and there it emerged.

A pale figure wearing no clothes, mouth agape and dark sockets staring holes through us.

The man from the story hadn’t done the horror justice. Its skin was loose and haggard on its skeleton, like it was nothing more than a cheap rubber suit, and its hair was greasy and foul. Its feet were still hidden below the water, but its fingers were nothing more than limp, dangling flaps that dripped marsh water as it slowly rose from the pond. It wasn’t until I noticed the dark spots on various parts of its form that I realized its true nature.

Dark spots like its sockets.

They weren’t marks or black, soulless eyes; they were holes. Holes in a suit of skin stretched up on some unseen skeleton rising out of the water. Its open mouth and sunken brow suddenly looked less like a haunting wail and more like a horrified scream frozen in time. A cry for help that never came.

As its feet crested the water—those awful, flayed feet that flapped loosely in the night breeze—I saw what was holding it up. A mountain of that spongy red meat soaked in mud and algae, a tangle of white, curved bone winding up and disappearing in its hollow puppet. Pale, worming tendrils waved from the holes in the crimson flesh, not dissimilar to the ones on the rope we’d been holding, and my stomach turned over in my gut.

That wasn’t the end, though.

In the fraction of a moment that I was able to take all of that in, more bubbles began to froth in the clearing around us. From the water rose even more suits of skin, all with the same desperate, wailing expression gasping at their face. Men, women—animals of every kind that were stretched in abnormal ways, as if whatever was holding them up didn’t quite know what to make of their various forms.

I prayed that the smaller human suits I saw weren’t what I believed them to be…

None of us screamed or made a sound. We just turned to run. The water had never felt thicker as we splashed into it, making a break back the way we’d come. I turned over my shoulder, horrified that I might see the figures gliding through the swamp after us, but instead I saw something worse.

Eli wasn’t moving.

He was still perched on the island, staring vacantly off into the bog. I could see by his posture that he wasn’t sharing the same fear that we were. In fact, he looked almost calm.

“Eli, let’s move!” I shouted, my voice breaking with utter terror. Still, it scared me more that he didn’t move. He didn’t even flinch.

I knew then and there that something was wrong. Whatever was in that water had him already, and it was too late. Still, I began charging back. We couldn’t leave him. Not here. Not with these *things.*

My boots sloshed out of the water back onto the mud just in time to see the full horror set before me; dozens of bodies conglomerated together, flies flocking and buzzing in and out of their holes like some sick sort of hive.

Then, in the middle of them, one last body bubbled up.

It wasn’t human this time, nor animal. It was pure, incomprehensible flesh. A mountain of soaking meat filled with excited white worms that squirmed and danced in the hot swamp air. Spines and large ribs stuck out from its serpentine mass that’s stiffness had been stolen—they seemed to shift and writhe beneath my flashlight like tentacles, snapping straight at random and releasing harsh *‘Clacks!’*

From its center spread large blankets of red tissue, almost like petals on a flower, and they too seemed to jitter and vibrate in the air like it was alive. Its head was nowhere at all, just a large, gaping pit plunging into a darkness of its body, a darkness that several pale ropes ran into.

The string that we’d been following went taut, and from the water arose even more, running off into the woods in every direction.

I felt mad looking at the creature, my brain hardly fathoming that something so horrifying might exist. Unable to bear it any longer, I reached out for Eli’s hand.

“Eli, please! Let’s go!”

My palm gripped around his hand—the one that had been pricked with the thorn—and my body went numb as it crumpled in my grasp. The skin wadded in on itself like I was grabbing a latex glove filled with water, and inside I could feel hard bits floating around like chunks in a stew.

Bile would have risen to my throat if it could, my swirling brain unable to take anymore, but I was shocked numb as Eli turned back to me, his face vacant and blank, and his eyes pouring blood.

Behind him, the vile flower of flesh and bone released a sound from its pit that vibrated my teeth and made my head pound. A sound like a coarse violin string being scraped.

Eli turned back to it, as if in a trance, then began moving closer into the water, his skin sagging as he went. I could barely move as tears streamed down my cheeks, the image of my friend sinking below the murk etching into my memory for the rest of my days.

A harsh yank from my right brought me back down to reality, and I turned to see Heather tugging me along, her own face slick with tears and snot. She called out to me, but I couldn’t hear her. The world had gone silent. Still, her expression demanded loudly without sound, and my body followed it instinctively.

*‘Run.’*

So we did. I don’t know how long or how fast, but we simply ran. Eli had the GPS which meant we had no clue which way we were going, but it didn’t matter. So long as it was away from that thing at the heart of the glade, it didn’t matter.

My legs had been aching from the miles of water we’d already pushed through, but they were in a whole new pain as they pumped to their absolute limit. It felt like running in a dream; that slow, painful slosh away from something out to tear us limb from limb. Even if the thing wasn’t giving a proper chase (which none of us dared to look back and check) there was still the ropes.

Each spear of our legs into the water was a heart pounding gamble. Each push forward was filled with dread that we might feel the prickly tongues of the living flesh catch our guts and turn us into the same living soup that it had to Eli.

His name hurt to think. It hurt even more with each step we ran away from him, leaving him to whatever fate had swallowed him whole.

I don’t remember when I blacked out, or for how long, but when I woke up, it was to a flurry of family, doctors, and police. Apparently the three of us had been found collapsed on the side of a road near the swamp's edge, covered in blood and rambling incoherently. None of us remembered this, too exhausted to even think past that point.

Once we were checked over and released from medical care, it was straight to the police. They asked us what had happened and where Eli was, but we didn’t have a good answer for them. There was none to either question.

We tried to tell the truth. We knew how it sounded and we knew how they would react, but it was worth a shot. The concerned looks and skeptical glances between the officers told us all we needed to know.

There was one thing I noticed, however—a look on the sheriff's face when I brought up the name ‘Hollow Skin Grove’. It was recognition. It was a small flicker of fear. As quickly as I noticed it, however, the man smoothed it away to never return. Still, as I talked, I could sense it behind his gaze. Something deeper than skepticism.

Whether my insight was correct or not, it didn’t matter. Our story was never entertained, and in the end, the whole thing was ruled as group mania. A hallucination induced by a collective panic we’d gotten while lost in the swamp.

And Eli?

Searches were conducted over the next few weeks, but of course, a body was never found; not that I believe in the efforts that were claimed to have been made. When his parents kept pushing that they search until at least a corpse turned up, the police finally released an official statement.

An alligator.

A rogue gator had migrated north and found its way into the county, settling in the swamp and yanking unsuspecting hikers into the murk. They were convincing about it too; even hauled the corpse of a gator they must have shot down south up and paraded it out of the forest to back their story.

I like to think that Eli would have found it all funny if he were still here. He ended up being right about the crocs all along.

He’s not here though, and of course, none of us are laughing.

Jackson hasn’t been able to get out of bed for the last few months. I’m pretty much the same. Heather blames herself for what happened, of course—how could she not? Still, I don’t fault her too much. Even if it was her who urged us to keep going, we had no idea what was sleeping in those waters. What horror was lying beneath the pond.

We do now though. We know far too much. I suppose that’s why I’m writing this. Because unlike the others, we did what we had set out to do.

We went to the end of Hollow Skin Grove and found out what was there.

So despite what you see about it hushed whispers on forums and in the quiet corners of the internet, I’m begging you:

If you’re a thrill seeker like we once were, don’t go to Hollow Skin Grove. I assure you; whatever it is you’ll find there is more horror than you ever want to witness.
