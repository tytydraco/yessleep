Our town is a sleepy place, nestled along shoreline and mountains with a population just over four digits. Folks here treat each other like family, whether that be helping out with yard work or bringing freshly baked goods to poor ol’ Maurice who couldn't get out of bed.

My parents weren't particularly strict growing up. So long as my sister and I finished our dinner, did our homework and went to bed by nightfall, all would be right with the world. Maybe it's just nostalgia, but when I look back at my childhood and remember playing outside with the neighborhood kids, or just staying inside to watch cartoons, I can't help but cherish those memories.

Mom and dad only pressed hard on one strange rule: do not go outside when there was fog. I always thought it had something to do with keeping us from getting lost. Stories and rumors would circulate about kids disappearing during thick blankets of fog rolling in, with some suggesting that voices would lead them out into the sea to drown.

“I am worried about you getting lost, dear, but the voices are just made-up folklore to scare kids so don't worry!”

That's what mom would always tell me when I asked about it. Dad wouldn't even give me the time of day, just a curious look as if the man didn't have the slightest clue what I was talking about. In any case, my sister and I never left the house during foggy weather. That led to a lot of boring winter days when cold fronts would roll in and carry cloaks of white from the ocean.

<—————>

I never understood the strange rule until one dreary morning. My sister had fallen asleep with her bedroom window open, a fact my parents were distraught by when a dense blanket of fog rolled in the next morning. They made a frenzy of phone calls, but didn't seem to find the answer they were looking for.

Something about my sister changed after that. Her bright, cheerful smile was permanently replaced with a sunken frown. She barely spoke, electing to do so in a hushed tone when absolutely necessary. For an eight year old girl, she acted like a woman who had lost everything and gave up on life. One year after the fog changed her, she vanished without a trace.

Following her disappearance, the fog would bring a lingering sense of anxiety and dread whenever it came. I wouldn't even look out the window on cold mornings, knowing our beautiful view of the ocean would be robbed by that unsettling void of white clouds. Every time I asked why the fog took my sister away, mom had the same thing to say:

“You wouldn't understand. Just stay away and don't listen to any voices when it comes.”

Aging into my late teens, there were numerous stories of misfortune and people disappearing that would be linked to the fog cursing our town. A kid I went to school with disobeyed his parents and walked over to his girlfriend’s house on a foggy night. Word spread he fell into deep depression not long after and later ended his own life. Ol’ Maurice died of a stroke just a day after someone forgot to close her kitchen window before a misty morning. Visitors who came during the fog would find great misfortune, suffering unexpected car problems, getting lost on the back roads or being involved in fatal accidents in some cases.

One day, I worked up the courage to ask my dad a question which had long lingered in my mind:

“What do the voices say to people?”

Setting his newspaper down, he reclined in his chair and cast a long, sorrowful gaze at the fireplace.

“I've never heard them, so I wouldn't know. I tried to ask your sister the same thing, though. She would just look at me with those sad, distant brown eyes… like she wanted to tell me, but couldn't bear to live with the truth.”

Later that night, fog rolled in and I caught my dad staring out of our living room windows. Pressing his hand against the glass, I heard him chant my sister's name in a hushed whisper:

“Aria, Aria, Aria…”

“Dad, what are you doing?”

Spinning around, the man's brow raised more than I had ever seen before. Shock dissolved off his face as he clenched his fist and frowned.

“Son, get back in bed, okay? It's not safe right now, you know that!”

“Then why are YOU out here if it isn't safe?”

“I'm just… I'm just trying to mourn the loss of your sister, okay? It's the anniversary of her death and I just—”

“Wait, death? I thought she was just missing!”

Wiping a single tear from his face, he walked over and planted a firm hand on my shoulder.

“Eight year old girls can't survive on their own this long, JJ. It's healthier to accept that she's dead and has been for a long time. Now, back to bed, okay? The forecast shows a foggy morning, so no school tomorrow.”

<—————>

Later that year, my dad started drinking a lot more than usual. I knew he'd succumb as an alcoholic when I awoke one night to him beating my mom without mercy. To escape his wrath, she ran off into the night and sheltered in the old, abandoned lighthouse at the edge of town. Fog choked the land the next day, leaving me to organize a frantic search party in the hope she'd still be alive and untouched by our town’s curse.

It didn't take us long to find her standing on the sandy shores, staring out into the boundless waves. I crashed into her with a hug, relieved she wasn't dead. One look at her, though, and I knew the fog had gotten to her. Sunken eyes, listless movement and meek words were enough to let everyone in the search party know that she was pretty much doomed.

Kneeling beside her bed the following night, I caressed her cheek and tried to warm her heart with the biggest smile I could muster. Rolling her head on the pillow, she looked past me with defeated eyes and mumbled something almost incoherent:

“You asked me once about the voices, didn't you, dear?”

“I did, mom. What have they done to you?”

Closing her eyes, she rolled her head away and allowed the faintest smile to play on her face.

“Truth, JJ. What they've done to me is the truth.”

“I don't understand, mom. What are you talking about?”

She remained silent—not just for the night—but forevermore as death claimed her in her sleep. Some part of me suspected my father had exposed himself to the fog as well, since he spent the following months sealed away and drunk in his dim room. The man refused to say a word to me, even when I got my first job and moved out.

Renting a tiny room in a run-down apartment complex on the other side of town wasn't exactly my dream, but it sure as hell beat living at home with dad and the awful memories plaguing that house. Old friends from school would drop by, hang out and offer their condolences.

<—————>

One night, the fog happened to roll in at the end of my shift. The boss waved us into the back room and let us crash for the night in a bunch of sleeping bags he had set up. Being the new kid, he took me aside and confirmed a few details:

“Alright, JJ. I'm sure you already know, but keep the windows and front doors shut until the sun comes back. I'll see if I can get you guys the day off tomorrow since you're stuck here for the night, okay?”

Maybe it was trying to sleep in an unfamiliar setting, but I couldn't catch an ounce of rest that night. All I could do was force my eyes shut and occasionally stare off into the choking white mist illuminated by our store's lights. Around three in the morning, I saw the vague silhouette of a person hobbling across the storefront, slowly making their way through the fog.

Shooting up, I shook my co-worker nearest to me awake and tried to explain what I saw, but she pushed me off and went back to sleep. Looking back outside, the figure was nowhere to be seen.

I brought it up with my boss the next morning, but it didn't lead to any answers. Our store cameras couldn't see a damn thing with the fog and nobody had been reported missing recently, so what I saw was quietly swept under the rug.

<—————>

An idea popped into my head at work one evening, which motivated me to buy some audio recording equipment. Yet, when a concerned neighbor saw me haul the equipment into my tiny apartment, he ran over with hands raised and began to protest:

“Hang on there, JJ! You aren't trying to record the voices, are you?”

“Well, yeah, actually I am. I want to know what they're saying without it… y’know, cursing my mind or whatever.”

“What makes you think an audio clip is going to change anything, man? We don't know if recording it makes it safe to listen to!”

“Well, I'm going to try, David. I need to at least try to understand what happened to my mom and sister.”

Working through his judgemental glare, I began setting up the audio recording devices around my front door. Just a few days later, more fog would rise from the sea and descend over our unfortunate town. Patiently, I waited inside and passed the dreary weather with hot chocolate and old re-runs of my favorite TV shows.

Hooking the recording devices to my desktop, I looked over the long audio file and found several spikes indicating the devices had picked something up. Fearing what David said might be true, I took one extra precaution and lowered the pitch on the audio file, hoping it might spare me from whatever mind altering effect the voices would inflict.

Most of the audio was irrelevant. Distant dogs barking, the upstairs neighbors closing their interior doors and traces of my own television almost led me to believe there was nothing there. One unassuming sound captured my attention, however. Around midnight, a warbled breath muffled something almost directly into the microphone. It didn't sound like any comprehensible language, rather a choking voice struggling to speak through an episode of anaphylactic shock.

Nobody in town took the recording seriously. Those not afraid to actually listen quickly assumed it was my voice and that I was just pulling their leg. Taking another risk, I restored the audio file back to its original pitch and listened again. Nothing remarkable came from the effort.

<—————>

Over the following days, I would record various sounds which didn't quite make sense. If I had to describe some of them, I'd say it sounded like someone choking on a ball of viscous slime or making weird mouth noises with goo dripping out of their throats. One stood out among the rest.

When altered to a higher pitch and slowed down, one particular recording sounded like it was repeating the same few words over and over:

“Guiding… Light… Guiding… Light…”

Asking around town about the curious phrase, most people shrugged it off or gave a half serious answer. As a last resort, I visited my dad and asked what he thought. Through his drunken speech, he gave a surprisingly insightful answer:

“Might be referring to the lighthouse, I dunno kiddo. That's where you found your mother, remember?”

Following the vague lead, I paid a visit to the library and began scouring through old records and long forgotten documents. The lighthouse went dark in the late 1990’s as ships became more modern. It underwent an upgrade way back in late 60’s, when automation phased out the need for a lighthouse keeper.

During my investigation, a curious detail became apparent: strange disappearances began popping up when the lighthouse underwent automation, with a severe spike happening right after it went dark. Sifting through pages of weather report data, the disappearances were linked to increased levels of fog and decreased visibility.

<—————>

Taking a trip down to the lighthouse on a clear Sunday morning, I observed nothing immediately remarkable about the dilapidated three-story building. An old dirt trail snaked off from the main road, connecting to the front door which faced an overgrown and poorly maintained yard. Standing over a jagged face of rocks on an elevated rise about a hundred feet above the ocean, I could picture a time when bright beams would shine forth and cut through the coldest, darkest nights.

I assumed accessing the inside of that lighthouse would be an entire ordeal, since it appeared to be fenced off with a tall barbed wire gate and had plenty of “no trespassing” signs posted around. Yet, just when I turned to leave, a sheriff pulled up in his patrol car and stepped out.

“Mornin’ JJ, what brings you out this way?”

“Just thinking about my mom. How did she get into that lighthouse if it's all fenced off?”

Walking up beside me, the man took off his hat and shrugged.

“Hard to say, but that old buildin’ doesn't offer much shelter from the elements. It might hurt to hear this, but I suspect the fog got to her while she was in there.”

“Would it be okay if I took a peek? I know it's technically trespassing on private government property, but…”

Looking over, the sheriff regarded me with a pitiful expression and shook his head.

“Oh, I suppose only because your mother spent her last sane night there, I'll let you sneak in if you can find an opening. Just don't be stealing or damaging anything, yeah?”

I gave the officer a smile and kind nod before approaching the fence. Walking around the perimeter for a bit, I spotted a sizable hole rusted into the fence near the far back corner where the roaring waves crashed audibly against the cliffs. Squeezing my way in with ease, I approached the lighthouse and swung open the old iron door on its noisy hinges.

<—————>

The bottom floor of the place was a complete mess and reeked of mildew. Stacks upon stacks of rotting wooden crates were lined up against the wall, with an old fireplace being the only suggestion that someone might have once inhabited the space. Anchored to the far wall, a rusted metal ladder ascended to the upper floors.

Taking a peek at the second level, I observed a worn out sextant facing a grime caked window. A small desk occupied the corner, with a single piece of paper perched near the edge.

The top floor was mostly just mechanical clockwork devices I didn't understand, with dangling wires and a single breaker box hanging from the wall. An old red landline phone sat on the floor, disconnected from the line and strung out as if someone had thrown the device.

Returning to the second floor, I walked over to the desk and inspected the paper. Layers of grime and deterioration rendered the letters difficult to read, but after inspecting the message multiple times, I could understand bits and pieces:

“Capsized off the coast… guiding light for the voices… heard them on the phone… need to communicate on the full moon… faith protects the mind.”

Discovering that little piece of paper gave me the reassurance I needed. I knew then the lighthouse had some profound connection to the cursed fog, the voices and our town’s many disappearances. All I needed to do next was piece the puzzle together.
