[PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k9ph04/i_found_glowing_mushrooms_on_my_run_part_1/)

*I’ve never had a dream this vivid and real!* I thought. *What was mixed in my drink yesterday!?* I groaned as I pushed myself out of the bed to go drink some water from the kitchen and pee. I planned on getting an hour of sleep before I started my work for the day. As I made my way back to the bed, my gaze fell upon the mushrooms, they were glowing now, brighter than ever. The pulsating bioluminescence reflected on the white walls of my bedroom. My heartbeat grew faster, almost syncing with the flowing glow. Faster, as the glow grew brighter.

I went closer to the fungi, the glow now brighter than ever before. Illuminating the entire room with fluorescent green, blue and yellow lights. I saw that the stump had grown, not by a few millimeters in length, but grown large enough to sprawl out of the pot and on to the shelf, sticking to it like normally roots of a tree would, spreading out, as if ready for more growth. On this stump, grew more mushrooms. Big, round and glowing. Then, as if sensing my presence, all of them, at once, released the same, glowing spores out in the air.

Scores of glowing spores surrounded me at once. The air felt familiar now, hot, humid, putrid, just like in the dream. The smell of rot and decay engulfed me. Only now, I wasn’t bothered by it. It felt pleasant, relaxing, gratifying. The sweet aroma gave me a sense of tranquility I had never felt before. As if every muscle in my body was relaxed. My breathing became calmer, in sync with the bioluminescence. The peace I felt was otherworldly. I never wanted to snap out of the trance the mushrooms put me in. I don’t remember going back to bed.

I don’t know when I woke up, but when I did, I had no urgency to go back to work. It was as if the world had slowed down for me. Everything seemed to be in slow motion. My instinct was intact enough for me to realize that this was wrong, that something was up. But it was like my mind had never known stress. Calmness had engulfed me. The sweet aroma emanating from the mushrooms was soothing every cell in my body. I yearned to go back into the dream world. A part of me had the urgency to open my laptop and start working, but the rest of me just wanted to sleep.

I finally and reluctantly switched on my laptop. Browsed through the dozens of pending e-mails and opened tickets under my name, only to switch it back off and gaze at the magnificent fungi adorning my shelf. The spores still filled the air, like glowing dust across my room. They covered me, from head to toe. In the mirror, I saw the glowing version of myself, calm, at peace, as if every worry from the world had disappeared. I breathed in the fragrance and closed my eyes. I went to bed, hoping to go back to the dream world, that now, felt more like a home I always wanted.

And indeed, soon I found myself back there. I realized that it was not the ground that was sticky, but the hyphae-like vegetative growth sprouting out of my feet trying to make its way underground. Soft, cotton like growth from my soles was trying to make its way into the wet, green, moldy ground. And with every step, I felt stronger, as if I derived nourishment from the ground.

I observed the vast expanse of space above the giant mushroom trees. Glowing, fluorescent sky, nothing like the one back on earth. There were no stars, but the spores gave an impression of millions of illuminated celestial bodies floating around the horizon, as far as I could see.

As the growth from my feet spread, I felt myself slowing down, my own body entwining with the fibers already buried deep under the ground. Each time they touched, it was like a new thread stitching me to something larger, something vast. Then, the voices began—whispers layered upon whispers, countless, overlapping, impossible to follow.

I strained to focus, but there were too many. Then, just as suddenly as they had come, the voices fell silent. A severing. A loss.

And yet, I didn’t feel fear. The longer I stayed, the more I felt I belonged here. The strange calmness wrapped itself around me, deeper than before. It wasn’t just nature I was connecting with; it was something older, something that had long forgotten what it meant to be individual. The sweet aroma grew stronger, drowning my senses in a thick, soothing haze. I could feel them calling to me—not just to join them, but to *become* them. To be a part of the network. I felt. Included.

I was annoyed when I woke up. My alarm had somehow managed to sever the fiber tethering me to the colony. I did not want to be back in this body. This mere sack of flesh, blood, bones and organs. A primitive mind, trapped behind eyes and mouth—tools for imitation, not true communion. The network here is fake and materialistic, behind a screen on a computer or a cell phone, where I can see pictures and read posts, but they are hollow for I cannot interpret the thoughts of those that post them. I don’t feel connected here. No one calls out to me here.

The spores surrounding my room immediately put me at ease, pulling me back into the trance I craved. The only thing left was the yearning to return to the colony. Work was insignificant now. Earth had become nothing more than a warehouse for my body, while my mind lived elsewhere - lived *with* them.

The stump had grown even further, sprawling across the shelf and spilling onto the floor. The mushrooms had multiplied—hundreds of them now sprouted from the thick, pulsing root. My walls, once bare and sterile, were now beautifully molding, giving my thriving colony a textured, organic backdrop. I could see the hyphae from each mushroom now, their fibers intertwining and stretching across the walls. Black mold bloomed around them, framing the latticework in a living, breathing masterpiece. It was perfect.

It was perfect, but I no longer wished to be there. The colony was my home and that’s where I longed to be. I took a deep breath of the sweet spore-nectar and drifted back to my stupor.

Back home in the colony, the hyphae had now grown long enough to intertwine with the fibers existing beneath the moldy surface. They were woven together, holding me firm and immobile in my place. But at this point, movement was no longer needed. I was connected to the mycorrhizal network, the web. I was now not just a part of the colony; I was the colony.

I could now hear them all—the countless whispers that once seemed chaotic now wove themselves into a single, coherent chorus. They were the voices of the Earthlings, hundreds, thousands of pilgrims like me who had found their way into this promised land. I could hear them reminiscing over their old lives, voices filled with gratitude for being freed from their mundane existence and insignificant worries. Each one gave thanks to the colony, to the great web, for consuming them, for giving them purpose beyond themselves.

On Earth, I woke up for one last time. A loud thud on my door had jolted me back into this vessel. The mushrooms had now consumed my house, growing over every surface, even over me. My body glowed with their bioluminescence, as if preparing to launch what remained of me into the greater web back home.  
Soon, I thought. Soon, I will be home forever.  
Through the haze, I heard faint voices from the Earthlings outside:  
“It’s been smelling like this for days, officer!”  
“Police! Open up!”  
I laughed, a rattling sound as the last air escaped my lungs. As my body slumped, empty at last, I left this alien planet behind. I had returned to the colony — the land of eternal peace.
