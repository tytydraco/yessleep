As a child, I used to walk along the Seine River, holding my parents’ hands. They looked at me with kindness and spoke to me softly. But my thoughts often wandered.

  


"Dad, Mom, can you hear that song?"

  


My father frowned. My mother said:

  


"Sweetie, it's in your head. We've already told you." 

  


And yet I trusted my senses. I may have had a vivid imagination, but this song was real. It wasn't a harmonious melody. It was a dark, pulsing litany, a cryptic whisper that drifted through the air, heard only by those with keen ears. It came from the ground. It rose from the manhole covers. 

  


Sometimes curiosity overcame fear, if only for a moment. So when my parents weren't looking, I’d kneel down and press my ear to the ground to better catch the muffled words. Then I would listen...

  


\*\*\*

  


*You call this place Paris. We don't call it anything. There’s nothing special about it. It is unworthy of a name. Beneath the city, your struggles are stripped of all meaning. In the catacombs, all bones taste the same.* 

  


*To you, Paris is love and longing, storms and drizzle. For us, it is a maze of chasms and tunnels, repulsive to you, but a refuge to us. It is our maze.*

  


*And in this maze, we are the monster. A monster with ten million eyes that glow in the dark.*

  


\*\*\*

  


As a child, I always wanted a little dog. I would have named him Snoopy and loved him with all my heart. Every day, I pestered my parents to buy me one. But we had neither the space nor the means. In our dilapidated building, our cramped apartment was no place for Snoopy.

  


But my parents wanted to see me happy. One day, when I came home from school, I found them at the front door, with gleeful smiles. Dad had his hands behind his back.

  


"Here."

  


He handed me a cardboard box with holes in the sides. It was way too small for a dog. I could hear scratching coming from inside.

  


"Look inside."

  


Warily, I lifted the lid and peeked inside the box.

  


"A rat! Yuck! I wanted a dog!"

  


"But son, we already discussed this. We can't have a dog. But a little rodent doesn't take up any space, and it will cost us less."

  


It was always like this. I wouldn't be getting any new shoes. I'd have to keep my threadbare sneakers for a long time, it would cost them less. By that logic, I would have a rat instead of Snoopy.

  


As if she had heard my thoughts, Mom added: 

  


"We did some research, you know. They're very intelligent animals, and they're affectionate too. You'll learn to love it."

  


I glanced at the box again, but this time curiosity had been replaced by disgust. The rat stared at me with its beady eyes. It stood up on its hind legs, its whiskers twitching. Why not, after all, I thought to myself. I'll call it Snoopy.

  


Over the next few days, I got to know him. He was really smart. He liked being on my shoulder, he loved watermelon and the heavy metal I blasted in my room, much to my parents' despair. He didn't like silence and hated my sister. It didn't matter much, there was always noise in the house, and the feeling was mutual.

  


And then, in the evening, lying on my bed, I would sometimes let him out of his cage. He would nestle in the crook of my shoulder and, once again, I would hear the song...

  


\*\*\*

  


*You hate us, draped in your pride. We, your children! To hear you talk, we are filthy and vile, vicious and cruel, we who dare to share your city. When we come out of our hiding places at night, you look down on us and turn away.*

  


*What have we done to deserve such contempt? You feed us the leftovers from your feasts. You shelter us in your narrow tunnels and damp caves. We do not hate you. On the contrary, we believe we live in harmony with you. In fact, we pity your pompous displays and hollow debates.* 

  


*You are no better than us. But unlike you, we know our place.*

  


\*\*\*

  


"Excellent work, once again."

  


My teacher handed back my test with a satisfied smile. I wore a triumphant grin. I was starting to get used to compliments.

  


At first, I didn't understand how my classmates could be so mediocre. Were they not capable of thinking? Didn't the answers seem as clear to them as they did to me? Then I came to realize that their narrow minds were nothing like mine. They stumbled over things that were obvious to me. 

  


The ones I found most amusing, or most tragic, were the serious students. Not those who were incapable because they didn't even try, but, on the contrary, those who threw all their strength into the battle and still came out defeated.

  


They were just… limited. Doomed to jobs that matched their small minds. Condemned to bland relationships, and to lives so unremarkable they would fade without a trace.



But I was better than them. I had to be. I would achieve greatness. Soon, at the end of my senior year, I would go to college and leave my idiotic peers wallowing in their own mire. I would leave behind this mediocre high school that was crawling with rats.

  


\*\*\*

  


*You keep going on about how reasonable and rational you are. And your reason, invincible and absolute, justifies violence, excuses all excesses. Who are the true beasts? Are we the ones who destroy everything we touch?*

  


*In truth, for us, you are the Beast.*

  


\*\*\*

  


"Here's my favorite bookworm again!"

  


I liked the librarian. She was a large, cheerful woman with small, laughing eyes set deep in their greasy sockets.

  


"If you only knew how happy it makes me to see a young man like you here all the time! My son never gets off his phone..."

  


I wasn’t really listening. I liked her, but she didn't really interest me. What did was the heavy pile of books I had placed on her desk.

  


"Applied chemistry... Hey, you're not here to joke around! My son only reads manga, when he actually reads anything..."

  


Her son seemed like a complete idiot. Then again, when you're the son of a librarian, you're not likely to be anything special.

  


But I was different, I was sure of it. Getting into university only confirmed it. I was soon going to leave my rotten apartment building and its stinking hallway. I was going to make money and become someone.

  


But to do that, I had to read. Rich kids have everything they need to succeed. They go to the best schools and have the best private tutors. 

  


All I had was rage. I was furious at being a nobody and living like an animal. I deserved better than that. I wasn't condemned to wait for the end of the month. But to do that, I had to read.

  


Books hold so much knowledge. Everything humanity has ever learned. But not everything can be found in books. There is a litany, a secret never written — until now. And the lyrics go…

  


\*\*\*

  


*We know no glory. You like to show off, but we prefer to hide. The light blinds us, the noise deafens us.* 

  


*We prefer silence, barely disturbed by the lapping of the sewers. In this silence, in this darkness, our senses are more acute, we are more lucid.* 

  


*We are the forgotten masters of this world beneath yours. Here, nothing disturbs our work.* 

  


\*\*\*

  


*Inappropriate formula.*

  


I carefully noted my observations in my notebook.

  


*Subject No. 138 is reacting poorly to the product.* 

  


That was putting it mildly: the rat was writhing in pain, whimpering softly. It hated me.

  


The formula I was testing was a new compound for an expensive lipstick that was both phosphorescent and waterproof — for pool parties, of all things. It was absurd, but it paid well. I would have liked a job with more meaning, that made me feel truly useful. But for now, I was content with this one.

  


In fact, I had done pretty well for myself. I had become a scientist, joining the ranks of those who knew all the secrets. I was just a beginner, but I could already see the brilliant career that awaited me, rewarding all my efforts.



  

I glanced at the cage. The rat had stopped whimpering and was lying sprawled on the floor. I felt sorry for it. It reminded me of Snoopy. But pity didn't pay rent. Mechanically, I sprayed a new substance on it. 

  


In agony, the rat writhed pitifully. If it could speak in human tongues, it would beg for its torment to end. Between its teeth, its whimpers became a song. A song that the indifferent human on the other side of the wall had long since forgotten. In its last moments, the rat whispered…

  


\*\*\*

  


*Feverishly, you built mountains, drained seas and blackened the sky. Every marvel bears its horror. So that your sinister work would not collapse, you build its mirror underground. This is our world.* 

  


*You created us, and when you’ll grow tired, we will rise.*

  


\*\*\*

  


"You're fired!"

  


I stood frozen, arms limp. It was true, I had screwed up. One of the cages was poorly secured, and, of course, a rat had escaped. Of course, it had happened when the CEO of the company, the Great Feathered Chief, as we liked to call him, was visiting the laboratory with his wife, an obese woman clearly bored out of her mind. 

  


I explained my work to them, but of course they didn't understand a thing. It was all staged, a show. The big boss, in his immense magnanimity, came to bestow his blessing on the little lab technician, under the satisfied gaze of the lab director. 

  


But the little lab technician had noticed, out of the corner of his eye, that something was wrong. Cage No. 3 was empty, the door ajar. Too late. Subject No. 227 climbed up the leg of the CEO's wife, who began to scream.

  


"Michael!" Michael was the CEO. "Do something!" The husband was paralyzed: he had never 

learned how to handle such a situation during his marketing studies. 

  


I still remember his wife's screams; she sounded like a pig being slaughtered. She looked a lot like a pig, actually. The rat continued its race, slipped under her loose dress, and bit her thigh. She looked ready to faint: 

  


"MICHAEL! I'm going to die of leptospirosis!"

  


With that, she actually fainted and fell heavily to the floor. The rat, a little dazed, slipped between our legs and disappeared. The CEO glared at me. The lab director had taken three cautious steps back, as if that would spare him. And the next day, I found myself in his office. 

  


He continued his tirade. I wasn't really listening.

  


"Do you think the company can afford to keep dead weight like you around? There was one day when there couldn't be a single mistake! One day! And you screwed up!"

  


I knew that. I had already thought about it myself. Not content with firing me, the director was taking advantage of the opportunity to humiliate me. Fine. 

  


"Do you have any idea of the consequences of your negligence? The CEO has threatened to close the lab!"

  


I didn't care anymore about the decisions of the Great Feathered Chief.

  


"You're a loser! A nobody! You're no better than your precious rats!"

  


I smirked slightly. I had to admit that the director had a way with words.

  


"And that makes you laugh? Get out of here!"

  


Without a word, I turned on my heel and slammed the door of his office.

  


In a corner, someone had been watching the scene. It was subject No. 227. He didn't quite understand what had happened. Human stories are obscure to those of his species. He only knew the stories of rats. And those stories say…

  


\*\*\*

  


*We know neither joy nor sorrow. You cling to them to feel alive. That is what your world is: a cell lined with mirrors, whose reflections feed your delusions of grandeur.*

  


\*\*\*

  


Elena had left me. I always knew she was only there for the money. At first, she comforted me. She let me cry on her shoulder. 

  


"The director is an idiot anyway. With your resume, you'll find a job in no time."

  


And then, with every rejection, I felt her gaze harden, her caresses fade, my motivation wane. Our love was slipping through my fingers. It wasn't for lack of trying to find a job, but it seemed that the world no longer needed chemists. 

  


I was given the same excuses every time. You're too young, you don't have enough experience, there are candidates with better qualifications. That first job in the lab was my only chance to shine, and subject No. 227 had ruined everything.

  


I missed Elena. I poured another drink. My booze-fueled nightmares made me forget so much, but a glimmer remained. A melody that never stopped playing...

  


\*\*\*

  


*We don't know love. When one of us dies, it's because deep down, they deserved it. No one mourned him. Another will soon take his place. That's the way it is.*

  


\*\*\*

  


Drink, drink, and drink some more. Drink to forget the shame, to numb the soul and defeat the mind. I drank to fall asleep, not knowing what broken dreams awaited me on the other side. 

  


The sunrises all looked the same. I stopped counting them. Each week that passed widened a hole in my resume that was becoming increasingly difficult to justify. The sun continued its course, the months flew by, and next to my dirty mattress, the bottles piled up. These were my meager savings that I was drinking away. I preferred not to think about it.

  


Sometimes I told myself I would stop drinking. To celebrate this sudden burst of motivation, I opened one last bottle. The last one, I promised myself. But inevitably, that last bottle was the first of many more as I kept drowning myself. 

  


\*\*\*

  


*We love to dance. We dance to your ruin, we dance to your downfall. It's a frenzied dance that you know nothing about, but it's there, close by, right under your feet. It accompanies our song, which itself becomes cloaked in dark lyrics...*

  


*Here falls the crown*

*Here sinks the throne*

*And down under, in the deeps*

*The king shivers as the light dims.*

  


*Oh, how we love to dance!*

  


\*\*\*

  


Two burly men carried away my desk beneath the bailiff’s stern gaze. It was the way things had to be. I had to repay the creditor who had enabled me, for a time, to pay the grocer who supplied me with spirits. 

  


I felt only emptiness and disgust. Above all, disgust at my inglorious fate. At the same time, the world owed me nothing. When the sun rose, it knew nothing of my pain. When it set, it was deaf to my cries.

  


I found myself alone in my empty apartment, which I could no longer afford to pay for. I didn’t even feel thirsty anymore. I needed something else to numb my senses. Music, perhaps... ?

  


\*\*\*

  


*We don't own anything. Each of us is content with our four legs and claws, and our millions of brothers and sisters.*

  


*Because we own nothing, we hoard nothing but the number of our kin, which grows day by day. Soon, twenty million eyes will stare at you from the abyss.*

  


\*\*\*

  


"Hmmmff!"

  


As usual, I don't understand a word Crackito says.

  


Crackito is my crackhead buddy. At least, that's what I call him. He probably has a name, but with his toothless mouth, he can no longer say it. I like him. He shares my pain under the bridges of Paris. 

  


It all happened so fast. Without the lab, without Elena, without a roof, and without a penny to my name, I'm holed up in the shadow of a bridge. A bit like a rat.

  


All I have left is this notebook. Writing demands nothing. All you have to do is talk to the paper.

So here I am, writing down my bland existence. While I'm at it, I'll add the lyrics to the song.

  


I know it is insane. A feverish dream I've held onto for too long. A melody that has foretold my downfall since childhood. But it’s so beautiful, this song without verses or rhymes, without a chorus or refrain. I know it's real, even if only I can hear it. It no longer frightens me. I have learned to love it. And today, it lulls me to sleep...

  


\*\*\*

  


*We have no laws. We do not need them. Our only creed is that of the multitude, of the formless legion that swarms in the sewers. Alone, our fangs and claws are powerless. Together, slowly but surely, we are gnawing away at the foundations of your empire.* 

  


*We have no masters. Sometimes we have kings, when some of us, too stupid, too greedy, argue and fight. They get their tails tangled up and become bound together in their vice. Panicked, they try to escape. They pull and they run out of breath, but their efforts are in vain and the knot tightens. Then, obese and weak, the king wastes away, his pitiful reign ending in a feast. At his own expense.*

  


*We have no god. Perhaps God created us, perhaps He cares about us. We prefer to think that He has forgotten us — and we, in our tunnels, far from His light, have learned to ignore Heaven.*

  


\*\*\*

  


The Seine River calls me. Its surface is shiny, mesmerizing, slightly rippled by opposing currents. It hums a low, familiar tune…

  


I see above me the tangle of bridges that line it. I imagine them passing over my head. The *Pont des Arts*, the *Pont Royal*, the *Pont de la Concorde*. The city is so beautiful at night. So many famous people have walked on its cobblestones. I am not one of them. 

  


The song grows louder. I wish I could hear it better. I can’t resist much longer. 

I’ve transcribed the contents of my notebook for you. I don’t really know why. Rereading it, I remember so many things.

  


I remember my mother's voice, the evenings of my childhood spent bored, playing with the few toys my parents had been able to give me.

  


I remember Snoopy, who brought me some comfort. I remember the evenings spent watching him, the rat in his cage. And the human in his.

  


I remember the lab and the daily torture I inflicted on my subjects. They must be laughing now, seeing me here. Maybe they're dancing.



 

I remember the bailiff who took everything from me, with the same indifference I showed my lab rats.

  


I remember the words of the song. They used to terrify me. I tried for a long time to ignore them, to forget them, to silence them. 

  


But today, the song is louder than ever. I feel like I understand it now. It wants me to follow it into the Seine. It tells me I have no choice. I have to join my kin. 

  


\*\*\*

  


*We are not a model, let alone a metaphor. We are like you, minus the frills. You are nothing but well-groomed rats. We are what you refuse to be, out of pride or blindness.*

  


*You created us in your image.*

  


\*\*\*

  


Tomorrow, no one will notice me. Among the rats.
