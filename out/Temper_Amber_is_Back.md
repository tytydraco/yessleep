When I was at my sixteen years, my father insisted that I aditioned to a local show, a Disney but very, very low budget. I didn't contest, because I loved that kind of stuff at my younger age. At that show, the main protagonist was an animatronic called Temper Amber. Every episode followed a very clear pattern: We (me and the other kids at the show) would mess with her in multiple ways, until she threw a tantrum and we would apologize and play with her. 

As you may noticed, it didn't last much. It was a really limited channel. But the scary thing about the show is how badly everyone would treat Amber. The kids were often very stressed because they wouldn't want to record, or would rather do other thing instead, so they would discount it on the poor thing every now and then. 

And because she was programmed to undestand everything (they made her comprehend every type of negative action over her), the staff could often hear her crying and sobbing because they forgot to turn it off while the child threw their tantrum.

Also, the staff didnt spoke much about that and would just brush it off when it happened, but they would often find semen in her metal parts. It increased the metal rusting so much, one of the mainly reasons of the end of the show were because her repairing was so expensive (let alone the good amount of lawsuits because of child neglect and physical abuse in their families).

Years later, during the pandemic, someone reached to me and asked if I wanted to record something with Amber. I needed the money, because my dad got COVID and it wasn't backing down, no matter what the doctors did, so I said yes. I know it wasn't good to have an 6 feet tall animatronic at my home, but since I lived alone with my cat, it only bothered me.

I recorded the video, it exploded at YouTube. It remained a series, where we would talk about the neglect she suffered and saw others suffer. She learned that our producer and the main staff were in jail and cried in relief (her keeper mentioned some changes in her program, so it would be more interesting for the viewer). 

My cat would often sleep on top of her head, purring because of the bot's temperature before being used. 

About the video, it didnt last long until my emails were flooded in men requesting if I would rent her. It wasnt my intention to give her at first, but my dad needed the money, so I did it. I would clean her as soon as I could, and tried to rent her the less as possible. She would cry when being back again, how those men were horrible to her. 

One day, I went to grab some water while I was recording, I didnt noticed her walking and she stepped on my cat. She emoted as if heard a snap, the poor thing had its organs splashed to all sides. Once I cleaned everything while crying, I told her what happened and she cried too. 

Today, a guy dropped her off at my house earlier than usual and seemed pissed off. When approached, I noticed an massive wound in his cheek. "Your porn doll made this. I woudn't rent her if I knew she did to people. Also, wash her for once, for God's sake." He left, and I had to take her inside. 

"I heard, Amber, I'm so sorry. It won't happen again, I promise." I prepared myself for her sobbing, but instead she lifted her eyes on me. "I wasn't sleeping. I heard everything."

She didnt spoke much since then. I'm afraid its better if I check on her original keeper to see how to turn her off for good once my dad is good. But for now, she's locked in my basement with multiple cameras on her. She's just standing at them. 

Might give you guys some updates, I just need second thoughts on all of this.
