The time on Sonya's dash pulsed 10:45, bathing her trembling fingers in a blue glow. She eased her car into a space next to a picnic table, its rustic brown wood awash in moonlight.

Just as they'd planned, she'd arrived at the meeting place on the east side of the parking lot of Maplewood Park and allowed her gaze to drift at random across the shadowed grounds until she spotted him. There, beneath the ancient oak's twisted branches, a figure waited. Moonlight carved out his silhouette like a paper cutout against the night sky.

Sonya's heart wasn't merely beating; it was leaping in her chest like a caged bird. The same way it always did during late-night conversations with Klause.

The Starsky social media platform became their digital sanctuary, where many late-night conversations unfolded beneath the glow of phone screens. But this was different. The virtual world was about to collide with flesh and blood, and somewhere in the back of her mind, a tiny voice whispered that everything would change tonight.

As she stepped out of the car, a momentary wave of dizziness swept over her, forcing her to brace herself against the cool metal frame. Her mind raced to her nightly routine—had she missed her meds? She searched her pocket with trembling fingers until they brushed against a familiar plastic bottle. Relief flooded through her as she retrieved it. Still, that relief quickly turned bittersweet as she tilted the container, watching the final pill tumble into her waiting palm. The thought of an empty pill bottle niggled at her, and she reminded herself to ask her mom about getting a refill in the morning.

With practiced grace, she flicked her wrist up, aiming for her open mouth - a trick she'd done many times before without missing. But tonight was different. Her usually flawless coordination failed miserably, whether it was the strange lightheadedness or the electric nervousness tingling through her veins at the thought of meeting Klause for the first time.

The moment stretched out like honey dripping from a spoon, and she watched, almost in slow motion, as her target slipped away.

It rebounded from the side of her mouth and plummeted to the pavement, landing in the sewer drain. She gazed wistfully at the gated drain, then shifted her eyes towards the moon's serene glow; she took a deep breath and whispered a silent prayer to the night that everything would be okay.

He stepped out of the shadows, moving toward her with purpose. Bright lights glared down from the street lamps, revealing a pale boy who was also seventeen like her. His dark brown eyes held a glint of mystery, and a crop of dark hair hung down seductively, partially covering the right eye. The photos only captured half of his allure. He flashed a brilliant smile that would easily make the top ten list of the most gorgeous smiles on record. She felt sure that she was in danger of falling head over heels.  Her pulse quickened, but she steadied herself with deep, measured breaths.

"Hey, I'm glad you could make it." Klause nodded and walked toward the picnic table.

"Hi, yeah, me too," she added nervously and sat down facing him.

There was something disarming about his easy manner and charm. Still, underneath it all—like a shadow glimpsed from the corner of your eye— there was something different in his movements—as if he existed on a wavelength just slightly out of sync with reality.

Sonya felt the warning prickle at the base of her skull. Still, she pushed the feeling away, telling herself she was just being paranoid. He was, after all, gorgeous enough to make anyone nervous.

"So, listen. I have to tell you something." He slid onto the seat beside her, his right arm casually draping across the table behind her back – close, but not quite touching. His cologne wrapped around her like an invisible mist, dark and dangerous and absolutely perfect. She could feel her heart stuttering in her chest as she breathed in the intoxicating scent, letting it fill her lungs until she felt dizzy. Without warning, her leg started its telltale bounce – that frustrating nervous tic that always betrayed her emotions at the worst possible moments. Heat rushed to her cheeks as she pressed her palm against her thigh, willing the trembling to stop. Now, trapped in this electrically charged moment, she waited breathlessly for whatever he would say next.

As though distracted, he paused before continuing. "Look...I wasn't frank before." His voice took on a smooth, seductive tone, reminding her of sitting a Belgian chocolate on the center of her tongue. Soft, sweet, and impossible to resist. It sent delicious shivers through her body.

"Really? What's that?" Her voice ran high, and she immediately cleared her throat to disguise its pitch. Inside, she was shivering like a leaf. She braced herself.

"I'm not really who I said I was." A mischievous grin turned up at the corners of his mouth.

His mysterious brown eyes suddenly changed. Shadows of dark secrets danced like flames behind them. Pale, veined lines appeared beneath his complexion and around his mouth as he snarled.

Sharp incisors extended like pointed daggers beneath his upturned lip.

She slid to the ground, trembling with fear and awe. The wooziness took hold, stronger than before. This time, it was accompanied by a pulling and tightening sensation inside her body. She collapsed. The world began to spin out of control and turn dark, but the sound of wicked laughter dragged her, kicking and screaming, back to reality again.

"This was too easy, you know." He laughed. His image came in and out of focus, and she let her eyes fall to the two black boots spaced shoulder-width apart, a foot from her head.

"I must say, I'm a little disappointed." He crouched down next to her and clasped his hands. "I mean, you're not even trying to run." Her lack of response to his drastic change in demeanor diminished his enthusiasm for the game of cat and mouse.

"Is something wrong?" Clause eyed her like a predator coldly surveying it's prey. She was unmoving yet seemed to be trembling, just out of sight beneath her black hoodie. It wasn't that cold tonight. He looked down at the attractive girl, huddled into the fetal position and realized this wasn't going to be much fun at all when the prey wasn't able to remain conscious long enough to enjoy the fun, painful death he had planned for her.

"Alright, have it your way."

He brushed the hair off her neck, lightly grazing her skin. It was hot to the touch. His breath hitched in his throat as recognition dawned. "Werewolf?" he whispered, his voice a mixture of awe and disbelief. He shook his head, dark hair falling across his forehead. "But that's impossible—you're extinct!"  He pulled back, startled. Two yellow eyes glared up at him like mid-summer moons behind strands of hair that became short and coarse like gray fur.

A deep rumbling rose in her chest. Clawed hands shot up and locked Klause's neck in a vice grip, a second later tossing him several feet through the air into the trunk of a maple tree, impaling him on a branch that jutted out like a wooden stake. Leaves scattered everywhere. He shook his head and struggled to regain his bearings, clasping the bloodied wood protruding through his abdomen. Without pause, she sprung to her feet and finished the change. Slurping, sucking sounds, like thick stew boiling on a hot stove, made his stomach wretch as he watched with morbid fascination, unable to tear his eyes away. Low guttural sounds erupted in her throat as her wild eyes bored into his, evoking fear. An emotion he had rarely experienced in all of his one hundred years since he had been turned.

Jowls rippled and pulled back over sharp canine teeth. A guttural growl and jaw snapping sent saliva splashing over his black cashmere sweater. He looked down reproachfully and snarled. "You tramp! Look what you did to my sweater!" His fangs extended further out, and in a sudden fury, he snapped and clawed at her.

Crimson liquid stained the earth, but nature would soon take care of that. Storm clouds gathered overhead and would soon wash away not just blood but the darkness of mortal sins. The air crackled with that peculiar energy that always preceded a storm, as if the sky held its breath in angst.

Feeling spent, she drove to Woodsville Cemetery in the early morning hours to bury the vampire's remains, wearing only a torn slip and a coat. Her face and hair were covered in dry blood and dirt, but her mind was wracked with too many thoughts to care. Clouds gathered overhead. The first raindrops began to spatter on her windshield, but

she hardly noticed as she drove.

By the time she got home, it had turned into a downpour. She slipped her jacket over her head and ran behind the house to enter through the back door. She paused at the threshold and listened, but the house

was empty and still. She glanced around the small square kitchen and saw a paper half-folded with scrawled writing propped up on the table. She grabbed it and read:

Hey Hunny,

This morning, we're visiting Grandma and Grandpa at the cabin. We picked up our prescriptions; yours is on your dresser.

Please remember to take them. Remember what happened the last time you forgot!

Love,

Mom & Dad XoX
