Dad didn’t teach me much in the Life Skills department. His wise words to me were, “*Get a Job*” and “*NEVER hit or rape a woman*.” and “*Don’t kill anybody*.”  Which is great advice but doesn’t teach me anything I need to know, like how to do Taxes. I suppose it just never occurred to him in his exhaustion. He was a single father my whole life.

Mom died the day I was born. I don’t think he ever got over it, her pictures still filled the house. Though I had never met the woman I did, over the years, develop a fondness for her in the pictures. I kept one in my bedroom so that if I had nightmares I could just look at it and feel better. Somehow despite not being religious, I just felt that she was watching over me and making sure I was okay. 

Once dad got super drunk when I was about ten years old. He started remembering mom and how much he loved her and then he told me the story about the day she died. He said she was sitting up on the gurney and the nurse in blue scrubs brought me over to her wrapped in a white blanket with the red and blue stripes, they seem to be pretty universal in hospitals. The nurse placed me in moms arms gently and stepped away to give her more privacy to look at me while she did her nurse thing. 

Dad stepped up beside mom to look at my little face, I had my eyes closed according to him, so I appeared to be sleeping. Mom stared down at me and then turned her face up to dad to smile at him. He said in less than a second her blue eyes shot wide and rolled to the back of her skull leaving them white. Her smile turned into an odd snarl of sorts as her lips curled on themselves and left her baring her teeth at him like a wild animal. Her head jolted forward as if shocked then jolted back crashing her onto the gurney and dad instinctively grabbed for me. The nurses rushed to help and the doctor came back but it was over. He said her eyes never returned but her mouth relaxed and seemed almost smiling again. He said he never forgot that face, both the snarl and the smile.

He said he stood by holding me and watching, wondering what had happened. The doctor explained to dad that she had a brain aneurysm that had ruptured and caused her to have a hemorrhagic stroke. She had seized and become paralyzed and then unconscious all at once, ultimately dying. It was a rare complication and the fact that mom was unaware of her aneurysm in the first place did not help. The doctor said even if she had known it probably wouldn’t have changed anything. 

Dad did a great job raising me. We were best friends but I respected him and listened. He had to work a lot to provide for us so I spent a lot of time at home alone. I was allowed to go over to friends houses but I was a little bit of a loner. I liked to read and write and draw in the quiet of the house. Dad felt guilty, I could tell but I tried to reassure him that I was fine with it. 

I never went to bed hungry. My shoes were never too small. I never wondered where I would lay my head at night. I always saw my dad in the stands when I joined the Band for awhile. My dad was amazing and always there for me. He just failed to teach me certain things that I now need to know as a twenty-one year old adult on my own. Unfortunately two months ago, before I could even ask for help, I watched him die.

Just like my dad couldn’t get over my moms death, I can’t get over his. I hoped I could seal it off in a box in my dark memories. My brain is like a room with filing cabinets and everything has a place. Yet I still venture in to find the memory laying on the desk in the middle of my mind's room. Maybe one day I will be able to forget it but then again it’s not everyday you see your father skinned by rats. 

Mentally I am at full capacity for shit. I can’t handle anymore trauma and stress. Do you understand how hard it is to plan an open casket for a corpse with no face? I never thought it would be so difficult and of course, dad said he had to have an open casket, so I had no choice. I loved and respected and admired him. Whatever he wanted for his funeral he got. Luckily he prepaid for a lot, some stuff I had to pay for myself like the flowers and the food afterwards at my house because his was considered “uninhabitable”. 

I thought once the funeral was over and everyone went home, aunts and uncles from out of town I mean, things would settle and I might settle myself into life without parents. Of course I still needed to figure out taxes, but now I was on my own. So really I couldn’t settle because I now had to stress over figuring out adulting without any guide. I know some people never have help and I am so sorry they have to figure it out but I had my dad, then I just didn’t.

I think the stress is getting to me. I think I am seeing things. I don’t really know what else it could be but a possible mental breakdown.

I was sitting on my couch cheek in hand, sort of dozing off I might add, while watching tv. Out the corner of my right eye I saw a shadow pass through my dimly lit kitchen. Even though it was a shadow it resembled my long dead mother. I jerked to attention as my brain made that connection and stared into my kitchen. There was nothing there.  

The only light came from my tv which was pointed in a way towards my kitchen. I did this so that when I cooked or cleaned I could watch something. I shook my head and sighed to myself. I clicked my phone to see the time was 9:06pm and set it back down on the coffee table. I was being crazy, nothing was there I probably dozed off. The tv must have cast a shadow. 

I got up and went to my freezer, grabbing my southern comfort out and took three big shots before returning it to my freezer. This would help me sleep and maybe chase any bad dreams away. Lately I had been reliving my dads death but not all at once, more like glimpses of it and out of order so a puzzle to be put together. I did not want to do this puzzle. I found that alcohol allowed me a deeper blank sleep. 

The warmth of the drink spread through my chest as I walked back through my living room. I paused to switch off my tv leaving my house in complete darkness. I stared ahead until my eyes focused enough to see the hallway outline and then proceeded to my bedroom where I simply sank into bed. I did not bother to get under my blanket. I fluffed my pillow and laid my head down. Exhaustion took me almost instantly. 

I jerked awake and instinctively reached for my phone on my nightstand. “Fuck, left it on the coffee table.” I grumbled out loud to myself. My voice, though just above a whisper, sounded loud in my otherwise quiet room. 

I sat up on the edge of my bed so I could go get my phone and see what time it was. Glancing at my window I could see a little sliver of light trying to shine through. My back popped as I stood up and I laughed in my head at the voice that said I was getting old at just twenty-one. Other people my age joked about it but I wondered if older people were offended by it? Or do they simply joke about it too? Do we all just joke about getting old as we get older?

I stumbled my way to the coffee table and grabbed the phone. 6:56am it read and I walked over to my window to look out. I had expected more sunlight for the time on my phone, but maybe it was storming. I pulled back the curtain and peered outside. It was still dark, night time. My porch light cast a dim glow across the yard. Something small scampered away from the light into the trees beside my house.

I leaned back and clicked my phone again, 9:57pm it said. My brain stopped processing for a moment and I stood perplexed, staring at my phone. How had I gotten the time so wrong before? What was going on with me? 

I dropped my curtain and went back to bed. In bed I stared at the numbers on my phone screen, watching the minutes tick by. Maybe the alcohol and sleep had messed me up, that had to be it. I closed my eyes and hoped I would sleep through the night peacefully. 

I slept through without an issue thankfully. My phone buzzed next to me in bed and I looked to find a reminder that, Wednesday September 4th 2024, I had an appointment with the people who deemed my dads house “uninhabitable”. They were supposed to do a walk through and tell me what needs to be fixed and if it was possible to fix. 

I moved out when I was 18 and had been living in my little trailer since. Dad seemed fine and I visited the house plenty of times. He never changed anything about it and he was always a pretty clean guy. That’s why his death and this housing issue bothered me so much. I never once saw a rat the entire time I lived and grew up there. 

The house now belonged to me so I would have to decide to salvage and keep or sell it. It was my childhood home but it was kind of old and run down. I just wasn’t sure yet on what I wanted but really a lot hinged on whatever they said about it today. 

I got up finally, took a shower and tried to find decent clothes to wear. I figured I should probably just wear jeans and a gray t-shirt instead of my white douchebag shirt and black shorts. It was a more adult and serious meeting after all. Plus the officer from that night would be there.

My dad had also left me his 1999 Chevy Silverado which was now parked next to my little 1994 Pontiac Grand Prix. His truck was a deep earthy green while my car was a washed out blue. I decided to use his truck because it felt more adultish. I need to be an adult now because I had nobody else. For once I wished I were more social and had friends to call upon. I had coworkers but I kept work at work so I never made any friends out of them. 

We had to meet at the local code enforcement department. I had never heard of it before and had to google maps my way to it. It was a small building right off the main highway into town. If you didn’t gps it or already know of it’s existence you would pass it up thinking it was a house with glass front doors. They didn’t even have a sign, except a piece of paper taped to the door. 

Inside there was a lady at a desk, she was staring me down as I walked into the door which made me uncomfortable. I slowly approached her as if she might be rabid waiting for her to say something. Finally she stood as I stepped up to the desk.

*“Hi, Mr.Cuttmoore I assume?”* She asked though sounded sure of herself. I nodded and she began to walk away from her desk towards a hallway to the right.

*“Follow me, please.”* She said, noticing I had not moved yet. I made my way around the desk and followed her down the hallway as instructed. 

At the end of the short hallway was a door. She did not pause or knock, just simply opened it and walked in. I fell back a little but followed her in. Without a word she walked right past me and back out the door, closing it as she went. The whole interaction felt rude and uncomfortable but I bit my tongue and turned to face the three people in the room. 

They sat at a business table, the kind that has like twenty chairs on each side. At the end of the table was one of the men who had told me my dads house was inhabitable, I had forgotten his name. The officer from that night sat next to him, I also did not remember his name. The other man however I had never met before otherwise I had completely forgotten him.

*“Glad you could make it, Mr.Cuttmoore!”* The officer said with too much enthusiasm.

*“Yeah, I don’t think I had much choice.”* They laughed at that and I smiled and relaxed a little bit. 

*“So, please don’t take offense guys, but I don’t remember your names at all.”* I shuffled my feet and looked down.

*“Totally understandable, kid. It was a rough night with your dad. Doubt I’d remember names either… Officer: Mike Yuri but call me Mike not Yuri.”*

The man at the end of the table, who wore a gray business suit and a red tie, piped up, *“James Durran, and that is my assistant Kanen Hugh. Call me James and he goes by Hugh”* He gestured at the other guy, who also wore a gray business suit but instead a green tie, and was now scratching away with a pen on a notebook. 

*“So what’s the report on the house?”* I didn’t know what else to ask so I figured I’d get straight to it.

*“Well, obviously I can’t give you much detail since it’s still under active crime. The cause of death, as reported by the doctors and autopsy say the rats. We are unsure of how it happened though as you report your father was an abled body man and should have been able to escape that fate. Tox screens are clear too. The medical examiner also says there were not head injuries or anything of that nature to limit your father from moving. Unfortunately the infestation remains and did limit our ability to gather evidence. We are done now with the scene.”* Officer Mike looked relieved about that and I wondered how bad it must be.

*“We have the house marked off with the crime scene tape. The top portion of the house is basically perfect and up to code on everything. It is the basement with the infestation that is uninhabitable. You must have a pest control specialist get a handle on the rat infestation. It is possible there are bugs too but the rats would eat them so until they are gone we can’t be sure. Once the infestation is gone we can inspect again and address any issues after that. Do you understand, Mr.Cuttmoore?”*

*“Felix, call me Felix, and yes I think so.”* I didn’t care for the use of my last name. I know it’s an adult thing but it just didn’t sit right with me.

*“Alright, Felix. You have 30 days to contact pest control and begin the process of eliminating the infestation. Otherwise we may have to seize and condemn the property.”* Hugh said, standing up and handing me a piece of paper. The paper stated the same thing he had just told me and I simply nodded. I realized I had not sat down once during this conversation and wondered if I was considered rude for that. 

I realized the meeting was over and turned towards the door where the woman from before now stood again. I followed her back down the hallway and waved goodbye as I passed her desk. I didn’t turn to see if she waved back, instead I went straight to my dads truck and climbed in. 

I opened google and searched up exterminators in my area and called the first one that popped up. As soon as they started asking questions I knew I had to go by my dads house because I did not have any information other than there are a shit ton of rats in the basement. 

So, I went home. 

I know that I need to go and get the information but I just feel like I am not in the place yet, mentally. I need to sleep on it, maybe drink on it. A few drinks probably wouldn’t hurt just to get me through the night. Alcohol also makes you feel more invincible so maybe it can convince me to face the basement again.

I started writing this out as more of a note to myself. A document of the weird stuff so I can remind myself it’s nothing or possibly just document my slow descent into a mental breakdown because dad didn’t teach me taxes haha. He was going to this next tax season, feels like a cruel joke that life would prevent that. 

I had a weird night though and now I am debating on posting this somewhere on the internet to get some advice. I guess if you’re reading this then, Hi I’m Felix and this is the weird night I had plus my mad ramblings…

At home I decided to heat up ramen noodles and chill on the couch. I clicked on the first movie I saw and proceeded to ignore it entirely while my brain did its rewind of the last few weeks of my life. I allowed my brain to think of my dads death but minus the details, that I was not ready to look at and face. 

I went to check on him last monday because he missed my calls the week before. Usually he called back within a few hours so when days went by I knew something wasn’t right. I waited thinking maybe his phone had messed up and he had to get a new one. It always took him a few days to get used to them after switching. 

I checked and then I was sitting in a funeral home Wednesday signing paperwork and going over what he wanted and making calls to his family who never had much to do with him or me in the first place. I hated every second of it. I wanted to just walk out and go home, turn my phone off and sleep until it was all a bad dream. 

I was able to take time off work but I only have a few more days and then I have to return or lose my job. I have a little savings, the trailer is mine, I could probably just live for a while but then what? My girlfriend Elizabeth, well ex, went off to college, maybe I could go be with her? Maybe if I apologized and admitted I was wrong she would take me back and help me out. 

As if on cue with my thoughts I heard a noise in my bedroom. I stood spilling my ramen by accident, and walked slowly to my hallway. My girlfriend always made this weird thud with her feet when she got out of bed and I swear it sounded just like it. My bedroom door was shut and I had no memory of doing it. It made me uneasy but quietly I walked towards it. Turning the knob, my hands were now a little shaky, someone was in my home without my knowledge after all.

I pushed the door open and peered inside. Nobody. Not a single person or thing was in my room other than my normal belongings. My bed still lay unmade from this morning, my dirty clothes balled up in the corner because I never remember to grab a basket from the store. My nightstand with its lamp still turned on because I never shut it off except for at bedtime and sometimes I’ll sleep with it on. 

My laptop that I am currently on, sitting on my desk closed as usual. Everything is undisturbed except me. I swear I heard it, but I guess maybe since I attributed it to my girlfriend and was thinking about her at the same time, maybe my brain did a funny joke on me? 

I would have just left it at that if that was all that happened.

After this incident I decided that maybe it was time to start consuming some of the alcohol I had planned to drink to help me sleep before having to go over to my fathers the next day. I started with three big shots of southern comfort and threw on my spotify playlist to just listen to. Next I grabbed the vodka I had, some knock off brand with a red label and filled a glass with it and sunny D. It didn’t take me long to finish it off and I poured one more. 

To some that may seem like a lot, while others think it’s nothing. For me it was a lot. By the time I finished the second glass and gave myself two more shots of southern comfort I couldn’t see straight, let alone think of anything. I just kind of chilled on the couch with my music playing and let my mind be free of all its stress. Taxes weren’t a big deal and I’d either figure it out or go to prison haha. Maybe my girlfriend would take me back and do them for me, she was always good with numbers. She used to sit with Sudoku puzzles for hours.

Somewhere in my sudden fearless alcohol induced haze, I fell asleep. 

A loud bang woke me up in the middle of the night. I was still drunk so getting my bearings took longer than it should have. The banging was my backdoor which was odd because I rarely took the chain lock off. The wind was causing it to bang open and almost closed. I stumbled over and pulled it to but when I did I heard the most sobering disturbing thing in my life. 

A shrill squeaky shreek echoed through my home. It seemed that it was my name being called but in the most pain-filled and high pitched way possible, “Feeeeeeeelixx, Feeeeeeeeeeliiixx.”

 For a moment I couldn’t figure out where it was coming from and then I realized it was towards my bedroom. I paused wondering if I should go look or call the cops and have them handle it. The alcohol in me said to just go check it out. 

Following the sound that never seemed to stop to even breathe, I found myself in front of my closet door. While the squeal had not quieted it had changed to more of an,

 "*EEEEELLLLLIIIIIIIKK*"

 My heart pounded in my chest as I reached out to grab the door. Whatever awaited me would not be good. I couldn't help but have a bunch of monsters run through my head. A pink eyeless blob with teeth. A dark shadow that reached from hell to rip me down. A gremlin with razor blades for teeth and claws that would scratch my eyes out the second I looked. A pile of flying super strength rats ready to eat me alive like my dad.

I was terrified to open that door, but now I was an adult. I had no choice anymore; my safety net was gone, and I was the only one here. I had to face it, no matter what.

It was a field mouse caught in one of the traps I had in my closet. Its squeal sounded so close to my name that I knew I had to shut it up or go crazy thinking it was a talking animal. I pulled the trap back and let it out. I knew it’s back or legs were broken, and it would die soon but it made the sound stop. 

It laid there on my closet floor, breathing fast and looking so helpless. I kind of felt bad, this little guy was just trying to get by in his life and one mistake later he’s dying. I could put him out of his misery but that would mean I had to physically harm him like smash his head in. 

My partially drunk idea was to set him up in a shoe box with a cap of water and I guess let him go peacefully that way. I didn’t want to cause him anymore pain and suffering and I figured by morning he would be gone. 

Except, he’s still here, even moving around some in the box. He’s quiet but still breathing fast, nibbled on a cracker when I put it in his box.  Now my sober mind is spinning. **What do I do with him? How did my door get unlocked and opened? Why did it sound like he was squeaking my name? How is he even still alive? Why am I suddenly seeing shadows and hearing weird sounds in my home? How do I face the basement in my dad's home?**
