It is currently 12:17 am when I’m writing this. I have been awake for almost twenty-four hours straight because of my daughter’s imaginary friend. I am afraid that if I try to sleep now, I might not wake up. I’m not being kept awake by anxiety, or some nightmare… this is more disturbing… this is real. Fuck… I’m getting ahead of myself… let me back up a bit.

 I’ll start from the beginning.

My name is John… a single dad who does his best to provide for his small family. My wife died just over four years ago while giving birth to our only daughter, Emma. The hole she left has been almost too deep to fill. Some days, I ask myself why I keep moving forward until I see my daughter’s bright, smiling face. That makes it all worth it.

We live in a modest one-story house in rural Oregon. It isn’t much, but it keeps a roof over our heads, especially with my meager salary. As a struggling writer, that’s about all I can ask for nowadays. About two weeks ago, something strange started happening… or at least that’s when I noticed it.

It was a Tuesday. I had just arrived home from making a quick grocery run to the supermarket across the street. Emma is very mature for being 4 years old and doesn’t mind too much when I have to run out for five minutes. We live in a pretty nice neighborhood anyway, so I’m not worried about anything happening, especially when I can see my house from the store windows. I put the groceries away, picked up the dirty clothes that lay strewn about on the floor, and then made my way into the kitchen. I tossed some Hot Pockets into the microwave, pretending it was a legitimate dinner, and then went to find Emma.

I had to look around a little more than normal for her, which surprised me. She wasn’t in the living room watching TV like usual.

“Emma.” I called out, “Emma, honey. Where are you?”

I walked down the hallway toward her bedroom, figuring maybe she got tired and went to take a nap. As I approached the door, the air got extremely cold. Even though the heat was on, it felt like a freezer door had been opened in her room, blowing a cold breeze into the hallway.

As I approached the door, I could see that it was slightly cracked, only the slightest sliver of light pressing through. I grabbed the door handle, but before I could push it open, I heard a whisper. It was Emma’s voice… it sounded like she was talking to someone. I quietly pushed the door open, trying not to disturb her. She was sitting on the floor next to her closet, leaning toward it as if she were whispering to someone inside.

At first, I assumed she was just lost in her own little world, talking to an imaginary friend. Like most kids her age, she has a very active imagination. She has tea parties with her stuffed animals, draws monsters with googly eyes, and more often than not, pulls me in so she can practice her makeup skills. I figured this was just another one of her friends who was pretending to live in her closet. I stepped into the room and prepared to call her to dinner. Before I could get her name out of my mouth to grab her attention, she stopped whispering… listening for a response from the closet.

She listened intently, pushing her ear against the door. This was new. It seemed harmless, and yet… disturbing. I stood watching, waiting to see the outcome. She nodded her head as if agreeing with the non-existent person behind the door before whispering back in response. This wasn’t just childish banter… she was having a legitimate conversation.

“Why don’t you like the sunlight?” She asked, pausing and pushing her ear to the closet door.

She waited a moment and then turned to whisper back.

“Oh… that’s sad.”

She paused a few seconds longer… grimacing with discontent.

“Don’t worry, I won’t tell Daddy.”

A chill ran down my spine as she spoke that final sentence. The words she spoke were so unnerving. I had never heard her talk like that before. I knocked softly and stepped into the center of the room, interrupting her conversation.

“Emma, honey? Who are you talking to?” I asked, trying to push what I heard out of my mind.

The unsettled feeling left as quickly as it came. I chalked it up to just her active imagination. She turned to look at me and smiled hesitantly, like I had interrupted an important meeting.

“Mr. Long,” she said.

I smiled and crouched down next to her.

“Oh yeah? Is Mr. Long one of your friends who lives in the closet?” I asked, trying to rationalize it. “He’s like Mr. Bear and Mr. Duck, right?”

She looked at me like I was an idiot. Her face scrunched in confusion as she answered my question.

“No. He’s too big to fit in there,” She said matter-of-factly as if I should have already known that.

I admit, something about the way she said that didn’t sound playful or childish. It sounded so sincere… so haunting for some reason. Before I could respond, she continued to describe Mr. Long.

“He’s really tall and he has long arms that touch the floor, even when he stands up.” She explained, now smiling again. “His fingers wiggle like spaghetti noodles and tickle my toes when I’m asleep.”

She giggled and looked up at me with a face full of such happiness that I almost couldn’t perceive how disturbing her description was.

“He lives in the wall with his friend. She’s really nice.” She said, before scooting closer to the closet door.

“What?” I thought to myself. There can’t be another one. It was unsettling enough to think about an imaginary friend tickling my daughter’s feet at night... but now he lives inside the walls with another girl…? I looked down at her, holding a slight grin, hoping that it was no more than just her wild imagination. A few moments of silence followed, letting the thought sink further and further into my brain.

She looked up at me as if I understood. I smiled, holding my concern at bay. I wasn’t so sure that I enjoyed hearing about Mr. Long and his friend in the wall, but kids have creepy imaginations. I figured it was just a phase and that it would pass. I gave her the “That’s awesome, sweetheart” line I always used when she told me something I didn’t understand before kissing her forehead and helping her to her feet.

“Alright, honey, it’s time to eat,” I said, pulling her away from the closet door. “I’m sure Mr. Long needs to eat, too.”

She smiled, looking at me.

“He doesn’t eat,” she said. “Mr. Long just likes to watch.”

I laughed it off, hugged her, and picked her up to carry her to the dinner table. I tried not to think about the conversation, but something about it kept pressing its way back into my mind. It was strange. Her answers were so odd and somewhat disturbing. I ended up letting it go for the sake of her happiness… and my sanity.

That Thursday night was a rough one. I had been writing all day, straining my eyes so badly that my head screamed at me to stop. I finally closed the laptop and decided to relax on the couch for a bit to watch a documentary. I had put Emma to bed a couple of hours prior, making sure that she was settled in for the night. As a single dad, I always have a baby monitor on the coffee table just in case something happens. I know that she probably doesn’t need it, but it makes me feel better to have it. I had fallen asleep on the couch when I heard it crackle to life. Usually, it is filled with soft static or her steady breathing as she sleeps. This time, however, it was filled with whispers. I sat up straight and looked at my phone. It was 2:46 am… There was no reason for her to be awake at this hour.

At first, I thought she was talking in her sleep. It was a stretch, being that she had never done that before, but I figured it was possible. I picked up the monitor and held it up to my ear. I could hear her voice, speaking softly, followed by a pause. For the first couple of pauses, I couldn’t hear anything. It was on the third or fourth pause when I heard another voice fill the silence. This one was definitely not Emma. It was low and raspy… not a child’s voice. I turned up the volume, thinking it was just a speaker anomaly.

“…not ready yet…” (static) “…soon. Be patient…” the voice muttered.

“But I want to play now,” Emma responded quickly. “She said she wants me to come in.”

I had heard enough. I jumped up from the couch and rushed down the hall to her bedroom. The door was standing wide open. My concern level skyrocketed. I knew I had closed it when I put her to bed. I slowly peered around the doorframe, scanning the entranceway to her room. Her nightlight was flickering like it was struggling to stay alive. Emma was lying on her side, thumb in her mouth, eyes half-closed. All of her stuffed animals were lined up on the edge of her bed, facing the closet like they were an audience waiting for the show.

I looked over to the closet door. It was slightly open… darkness covering every inch in an inky black curtain.

“Emma,” I whispered, stepping toward the bed. “Are you okay, honey?”

She nodded without looking at me, still barely holding her eyes open.

“The girl in the wall says that the dark feels good.” She said sleepily. “She wants to come play.”

Her voice was flat. She wasn’t scared; she was more… dejected.

I walked over to the closet and pulled the door open all the way. As the door swung open, knocking against the wall, I nervously scanned the darkness of the closet. Aside from her clothes, shoes, and a pink laundry basket, there was nothing of note inside. I couldn’t physically see anything… but I could smell something. The inside of the closet smelled awful. It was sharp and repulsive, making me gag almost immediately. The best description I can give is that it smelled like a mix between wet earth and something sour… like spoiled milk or rotten meat.

I slammed the closet door shut. An angry voice rose from behind me.

“Daddy!”

Concerned by the tone, I spun around to look at Emma.

“Don’t do that,” Emma said, sitting straight up in bed… eyes now wide open and staring at me. “He doesn’t like the door closed.”

That was the first time that I ever felt fear from something that my daughter said to me. It didn’t make sense. This situation was so far from the norm that I could not mentally comprehend any of it. I tried to ask Emma about what happened, but she lay back down and acted like she was going to sleep. Every attempt to question her was met with her pulling away from me and groaning in discontent. I eventually gave up, thinking that the next day, I would get to the bottom of this, no matter what I had to do.

The next day, I was met with a coldness from Emma. My intrusion into her conversation with her friend made her angry. I made her breakfast and put on her favorite cartoons before I sat down to write. She didn’t say as many as two words to me the entire morning. The day ticked by like normal, only with more silence. I finished my work and formulated a plan for what I would do that night. I put Emma in a bath and went to my room to grab the tools for my plan. I had an old GoPro camera that I used when I rode dirt bikes. I figured it would be perfect for what I wanted to do.

While she bathed, I set up the camera in her room. I used a blanket, along with a couple of shirts, to hide it on her dresser where she couldn’t see it. I made sure to angle it so that I could see her bed and the closet all in one shot. I put her to bed, tucked her in, and kissed her goodnight. I pretended to adjust her bed’s comforter, watching her movements. I was waiting to see if she would notice the camera. She never looked in its direction as she rolled over on her side and fell asleep right away. I walked out of her room and gently pulled the door closed. I hoped that the next day would reveal the answers to all of my questions.

I waited until Emma came out to play in the living room the next morning before I went in to get the camera. As I walked into the room, the closet door was again open with the same wet, rotting smell emanating from it. I reviewed the footage on my laptop as she watched cartoons. Most of it was harmless… mostly Emma tossing and turning in bed. I fast-forwarded the footage to a point that caught my eye. At 2:19 am, over about two seconds, her closet door slowly creaked open. From the darkness, a long, black figure slithered into frame.

The figure slid out of the closet like it didn’t have bones, almost like a snake worming its way upright. It was tall and thin with arms that slid across the floor as it moved. As the figure grew to its full length, the camera shook, as if it were pushed or touched by something before going black. Shocked, I paused it and rewound. I watched over and over as the figure slithered from the darkness and stood over Emma, imposing its devious intentions. I wanted it to be a trick of the light or maybe my mind playing tricks on me… but it wasn’t. Every time I watched it, the same unsettling scene played out.

It wasn’t my imagination. Something dark and ominous was in the room with her that night. Something that calls itself… Mr. Long.
