Have you ever been pottering around your house, and out of the corner of your eye thought you'd seen someone, only for them to disappear once you look? It's not uncommon, most people experience the phenomenon at least a couple of times in their lives. An optician might tell you that it's just dust in your eye, or that your cornea is refracting the light in a weird way because you're overtired or something. Your eccentric grandma might tell you it's a ghost. Either way, as soon as you turn to look at it... it's gone. But have you ever noticed one, kept looking straight ahead, and they *don't* disappear? That's what started happening to me. And I can tell you that your eccentric Grandma might just be right.

I'll start at the beginning.

**Saturday**

It was around a month ago. I had just turned 21 and managed to move out of my parents house. I'd finally saved up for a deposit after a year-long stretch of night shifts scrubbing hospital floors. In hindsight, I should have stayed home for a while longer. I had used almost all of my savings on the deposit and what little I had left was spent on cheap but durable furniture to get me started.

I moved into a ground-floor apartment early that morning. I didn't know why but the rent was cheap. Way cheaper than it should have been. I never thought to ask why. The landlord was an older gentleman. He shook my hand, gave me the keys, and then went on his way. The apartment was close to my work and in a reasonable state, so I assumed nothing and carried on. My parents were kind enough to help me move my stuff in, and much to everyone's surprise, my younger brother Stephen was there to lend a hand too. I hardly saw him anymore, not since he finished school anyway. He was always in his room, gaming. His skin was pale and he had a slight dent on the top of his head where his headphones sat. I love him but man is he lazy.

I offered to buy him lunch but he politely refused.

"Pizza?" I kept asking.

I asked so many times because truthfully I wanted pizza, but couldn't finish a big one on my own. Eventually, he relented. My dad decided he wanted one too, so I asked if he could make the phone call while me and Stephen finished bringing in the boxes from the moving truck.

"Where does this one go?" Stephen asked.

He held a medium-sized cardboard box that was filled with cleaning products. On the side, I'd written 'Under the sink' in black marker.

"Take a guess, Einstein." I replied.

When he saw the writing, he laughed. He did things like that sometimes. Miss the obvious. I watched as he opened the cupboard beneath the boiler instead and dropped the box onto the shelf. He pushed the box inside until he struck something. The box hung out a little, but rather than pull it out and try again he gave it a little kick. To be fair, the box did slide in, but he also dented the metal tin that I used to store my washing machine powder. For that, and the fact that he got the wrong cupboard altogether, I took an extra slice of the pizza we were sharing when it arrived a half hour later.

**Sunday**

I had managed to take a week-long holiday off work so I could unpack properly and get settled in. I had all the essentials: clothes, packets of ramen, my microwave, my TV, my computer, and my bed. I had a long way to go, but it was a start. Sometime around midday I had just polished off a bowl of noodles and sank back into the one and only chair I owned when I saw a black spec in the corner of my eye. I turned, but it was nothing. One of the aforementioned instances that everyone experiences from time to time. After a minute or so, it happened again. Once again, when I looked, there was nothing.

The rest of the day went by as planned. TV, snacks, and then a few hours of gaming before I crashed at around 3 am.

**Monday**

I didn't sleep too well. I had a headache that lasted all night. I didn't remember my dreams. I woke up to the sound of my phone vibrating its way across the floor by my bed. When I answered it was Stephen.

"What's up?" I asked.

"It's almost 11, are you up yet? I've been calling for an hour." he said.

I groaned and stretched. My head was aching. I had definitely stayed up too late and was to suffer for it apparently.

"I'm up... I'm up. What's going on?" I asked.

"Listen... I'm going over to Andy's later, and I might have told him that you could score us some weed."

"What?!"

I remember that I was really angry when he said that. I wasn't sure why... I'd bought weed for him before. I guess I just thought that Stephen was trying to take advantage of me now that I had my own place, and that if I bought him weed now it would become a regular thing, which I definitely didn't want.

"I wish you'd asked!" I said, annoyed.

"Sorry man... but could you?..."

"I'll... I'll call you later. My head's pounding and I've just woken up."

"Oh... okay."

It might seem odd that I felt a little bad for being annoyed at him. After all, what kind of brother would I be if I bought him weed all the time? But still, when he hung up I didn't feel too good about it.

As I stood up I stretched and felt a little dizzy. Oversleeping always made me feel bad, but luckily it didn't last too long. I threw on my shoes and my clothes from the night before and quickly popped out for some breakfast. There was a small caf√© on the corner that had a coffee and bagel combo deal until midday. I really didn't feel like making anything and I figured the walk would do me some good. It did.

When I got back, I sat in my chair and ate my bagel, and then I flicked through my phone as I sipped at the coffee. I was halfway done when I saw the black shape in the corner of my eye again. It was quick, drawing my attention instantly as I flicked my head around.

Did I have flies? Perhaps Stephen had dropped some pizza crust somewhere and I hadn't noticed. I didn't think so though, I would have noticed... I think.

I got up to investigate, but no, no pizza crust. No food rubbish at all. I looked around, and there were no flies either. I wasn't a suspicious person, but something didn't feel right. I figured I was just homesick, and left it at that.

My headache lasted all day.

**Tuesday**

I had been shopping early in the morning and bought as much medicine as I was allowed. It was the most stubborn headache I'd ever had, and it sucked. Being out in the fresh air seemed to help a little.

When I got back to my apartment, I decided to finish unpacking. I'd left a few boxes after the first few ones I figured were essential. They were nothing super important. Clothes, books, a few board games... there was even a box with baseball trading cards in it.

As I started on the clothes, I saw the damn black shape again. This time, however, I didn't look right at it. I stared straight ahead and waited.

I had considered the idea that it might have been one of those little things that float around in your eye. I wish it had been. I didn't move. I stared straight ahead. The black shape did move, however. In a slow gliding motion, the shape moved to the left. I turned quickly, and even went to investigate where I'd seen the shape. There was nothing, once again.

"Hello?" I called out.

There was no reply. But of course, there wasn't. I felt like an idiot, laughed, and then returned to the clothes.

**Tuesday Night**

I sat in my chair, working my way through the tablets and a bottle of lemonade I'd bought earlier when I suddenly remembered; I hadn't called Stephen back.

I tried calling him but he didn't answer. I think I tried for a good ten minutes. I don't know why but I started to worry. He never went that long without calling back. I began to imagine the worst. Had he tried to buy weed from somebody else? Someone dangerous? Was he mad at me? Not knowing was killing me.

I genuinely believed that when I had moved out and gotten my own place that I'd be okay, but I was half a week in and inexplicably anxious. I worked myself down and decided to text Stephen instead. I began to type and for the fifth time I saw that damn black shape in the corner of my eye. It was closer than it had been before, practically in the room. It made me jump and I couldn't help but look at it. Like always it disappeared.

"Hello?" I called out.

Silence.

When I looked back at my phone the black shape had immediately returned to my peripheral vision.

I knew there was something wrong. I didn't look. I didn't dare. I froze completely and stared straight ahead. The black shape began to move. Slowly at first, the blackness took the shape of a person. It glided to the left, and became a shadow on the wall.

I couldn't help myself. I looked. I looked but it was gone. I felt cold. Not by some drop in temperature, but by fear.

I didn't sleep much that night.

**Wednesday**

"Stephen, I've been trying to call you. Call me back when you can, okay? Bye."

I left a voicemail at around lunchtime. I still hadn't heard from him. It really wasn't like him to ignore me. I was getting worried.

My parents house was a few miles away, but it was only a 10-minute ride on the bus. I'd talk to Stephen face to face. He couldn't ignore me then. As I was fastening my shoelace the medicine I had taken was starting to do its thing, and once again, the familiar shape returned.

My heart was pounding. I was not a superstitious person. I didn't believe in ghosts. But after that day I did.

Like before I kept my gaze fixed firmly ahead. The black shape took steps towards me. I was shaking. A cold sweat began beneath my eyes and in the small of my back. I was visibly shaking.

The shadow crept towards me in absolute silence, taking the rough shape of a woman. I'm not afraid to say that I lost control of myself. As my jeans darkened, the pale face of a woman emerged from the shadow that carried her, and she knelt beside me, drawing closer to me with each passing second before whispering into my ear.

"Get... out..."

I absolutely lost it. I ran out of my apartment screaming. Across the road, there was a path that led between two buildings, emerging onto a park on the other side. I ran straight through, panting hard as though I was being chased. I glanced back for a moment as I ran. When I turned I saw for the briefest of moments the silhouette of a branch before it struck me across the forehead.

I fell, dizzy and sickened. When I awoke, I was in my apartment, lying on my back on the floor.

I wasn't awake for long.

**Thursday**

When I woke up it was dark. I didn't know what day or time it was at first. The apartment seemed unfamiliar. Strange even.

How had I got back? I still haven't figured that one out. But back I was. My head was pounding, and there was something stuck to my forehead. When I rubbed it, it reddened my fingers. It was dried blood. I looked around slowly in the dark. I was alone. I pulled myself up and fumbled for the light switch. I couldn't find it. I knew where it was but I couldn't find it. I heard, or rather, I thought I heard something behind me. I did not turn around. I couldn't turn around.

My jeans were stuck to my leg. The skin of my thighs was raw. I could see the door. It wasn't far. I knew I could make it out. My legs ached as I staggered through the kitchen. My head was swimming and I felt more sick than I'd ever been before.

The door handle was gone. I remember I had started to cry. What was going on? What was happening to me? In the dark of my kitchen, I fumbled around in the night that had invaded the room. Even there, in the black of night, the shape returned and was darker still than all around it. I looked right at it this time. I didn't want to see.

I distinctly remember falling onto my back as the spectral white face of that woman materialised before me in the cold dark shroud that was her body. Her footsteps fell without sound as she approached. Expressionless and altogether dead.

"Get... out... while you... can..." she whispered.

My eyes met hers, and she remained.

I screamed and fell into a complete and all-encompassing darkness.

**Sunday**

I woke up sometime around 3 pm in the hospital where I work. My parents were there, and Stephen was too. My head was throbbing beneath the bandage that had been placed upon it. My throat was sore, and my back was aching.

"They gave you stitches." said Stephen.

I smiled.

"Funny way of saying hello." I managed.

"Well... hello... I guess." Stephen said with a small grin.

"I tried to call you..." I groaned, "I was gonna get a bus... come see you."

"I lost my phone."

"What?"

"At Andy's. I lost my phone."

I sighed. Partly relieved that he hadn't fallen victim to some drug dealer, partly disappointed in myself that I worried needlessly.

I spoke at length with my family. They told me how they came for a surprise visit and found me on the floor, unconscious. I'd been there almost a full day when they found me. I don't know how I'm alive, to be honest. I told them I had felt dizzy and slipped. I didn't tell them what I'd really seen. How could I? I wasn't sure what I could say that wouldn't make me sound absolutely insane. I told them only that I didn't think the apartment was right for me, and almost one week later I was discharged from the hospital and re-packing my things in the apartment. I felt sick just being back there. I didn't see the lady again, luckily. We were in and out in less than an hour, and I've been back home for a fortnight now.

**Today**

I've been trying to find out anything I can about the lady, but I haven't had much luck. There are so many death records going back hundreds of years. She could have been anyone.

I said I didn't believe in ghosts, and I suppose a big part of me thinks that it must have been a hallucination or maybe the coffee and bagel was spiked or something... but another part of me knows what I saw.

Whether I do or don't believe, it doesn't matter. Whether you do or don't, that's up to you. All I can say is this;

The next time you think you've seen something in the corner of your eye. Don't look.
