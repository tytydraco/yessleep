“I cannot believe I let you talk me into doing this”

I only spared a glance at Ray as we tore down the coastal highway towards the sea lion caves, the wind blowing straight off from off the Pacific buffeting the car around like it was a toy. “I mean, you call me up in the middle of the damn night, making me get out of bed to meet you at some hole in the wall diner, only to tell me that you met some homeless dude down at the docks, who, after telling you a bit about what *he* says has been taking the homeless, *then* got grabbed by one and dragged underwater, and then proceeded to chase you off the docks yourself?” He snorted. “Oh, wait, I’m sorry, you said *a group* of them chased you off the dock”

I could see him shoot me a glance as he kept his hands tight on the steering wheel of his cruiser. “No offense, Nate, but do you have any idea of how absolutely *insane* you sound right now?” I drew in a deep breath, then let it out slowly. “Look, you sent the other officers down to the docks, and they found the blood, didn’t they?” I asked. “Sure, they found blood, but for I know, that could be from a fish that got gutted or something” he said. He began to say more, but I cut him off. “For fuck’s sake, Ray! We’ve known each other for *how* many years now?! Have you ever known me to tell you something that wasn’t truthful? That I wasn’t absolutely sure about?” I saw him set his jaw tightly. I could tell he didn’t want to believe my story. But it seemed he was slowly fighting himself on that.

“No” he finally said, and chose to stay silent for the rest of the drive. I was grateful for it. I already felt on edge about going where we were. *We’re going straight into the lion’s den, both figuratively AND literally*. In my head, I couldn’t help but replay my last two encounters with the creatures. Flashes of the blur in the pipe, the laughter, along with claws snatching the poor man and trying to do the same to me danced behind my eyelids as I closed them. I opened them again as I felt the car begin to slow, seeing the sign ease by on our right. *Visit the famous Sea Lion caves! See the majestic creatures lounging and playing!* And then, almost plastered over the main lettering with a temporary banner: *Sorry, we’re closed for the season! Will reopen in late April!*

Ray brought the car to a halt, putting it in park and looking out at the stone steps which led down to the cave system next to the darkened visitor’s center, framed in the headlights. He looked at me with a hard expression. “Well, we’re here” he said slowly, “I just pray for once you *are* nuts or pulling my leg” I said nothing, only unbuckled my seatbelt and pushed open the passenger door. My nostrils were immediately invaded by the cloying smell of the ocean which lay a few hundred feet below us, and the biting wind made me happy I kept my thick jacket on. I heard the driver’s door slam and spared a look back; Ray had popped the trunk to his cruiser and was currently moving back towards it. He pushed it all the way open, reaching inside and fumbling about for a few moments.

He came up a moment later, holding what had been hooked to the back of the trunk lid: a police issued twelve gauge shotgun. I could see the flashlight mounted underneath the pump, which he flicked on, casting a bright white light onto the ground. “You have anything to defend yourself, *if* necessary?” he asked me. In response, I raised my coat, showing him the pistol still holstered to my hip. “Of course, nearly forgot about that” he muttered, hooking a belt which contained additional shells onto his own waist and slamming the trunk shut. “Alright, come on. Remember, we do one, and only one sweep of the caves. I’m going to let dispatch know where I am. And, if we *do* happen to find anything down there, we don’t play hero, got it? We get our asses back up here and call for backup” He narrowed his eyes at me. “Got it?” he repeated.

“Got it” I said. After a moment of scrutiny, he nodded, then turned and began to lead the way across the empty parking lot. Another fog bank was beginning to come in; I could see the first white tendrils rising from the cliff ahead, snaking in like a Kraken’s tentacles to ensnare the very ground we tread on. I made sure my own flashlight was hooked safely to my own belt, then followed my friend as he began to make his way down the rather steep stone steps, carved into the side of the cliff itself. We said nothing as we passed by an empty wooden stand which, during the tourist season held pamphlets. The further we went, the steeper the steps seemed to get. I’d never visited the caves myself before, so everything was new and alien to me. All I could hear was the massive *crash* the ocean waves made as they slammed into the side of the cliff, amplified through the opening to the caves in front of us. The blare of the foghorn came, louder than I was used to, seeing as how the lighthouse stood only a mile from where we were.

Then it all became muted as we entered the caves themselves. The metal railing set into the side of the path was the only thing keeping anyone from plunging straight down to the bottom of the caves and the water which rushed in to them. *Glad they’re here, honestly* I thought. I could hear a loud dripping sound somewhere above our heads, and the steps began to feel more slimy and harder to stay upright on as we wound our way down. Thankfully, though, the feeling of eyes on me I’d had during both encounters wasn’t washing over me now. *They must still be out down near town*. It meant we had a little time to explore, though I didn’t know how long. Finally, the steps dropped out and turned into a level path.

But as I rounded the last corner, I found myself slamming into the back of Ray. I nearly went sprawling backwards onto my ass, and my nose throbbed painfully where it’d collided with his shoulder. “Ray, what the hell, man?” I hissed at him as I rubbed it. But he said nothing. “Ray?” I asked again. He still didn’t respond. I felt a chill run up my spine. This was not the way Ray usually behaved. If you asked him a question, even in a stressful situation, the man would always answer you. I know, since he’d saved my bacon multiple times before when I’d let my journalistic side get me in over my head.

I leaned around him, flicking on my own flashlight and aiming it in the vague direction where his shotgun mounted one pointed. And froze. “Oh, god” I said quietly. Caught directly in the beam of both of our lights was the head of a sea lion. A very, very *dead* sea lion. And I knew that, since it was quite literally *just* a head, decapitated from the rest of its body. To make the morbid scene even worse, it had been jammed down onto one of the railing’s poles, the poor creature’s mouth pulled back to reveal its sharp teeth. *Almost like some kind of crude warning to stay out*. 

I gently reached out and put my hand on Ray’s shoulder. He almost jumped for a second, then seemed to regain his composure. “Okay, I didn’t expect *that*” he said evenly, but I could see his eyes now held a little apprehension. Ray was a huge ocean lover, part of the reason he’d moved to the coast, and to see the sea lion, an animal he loved butchered and used like an ancient tribe’s warning must’ve really got under his skin. His eyes hardened, and he nodded at me. “We go slow from here out” he whispered. I nodded, and then we slowly moved on, past the head. We began to pass more decapitated animal heads as we drew closer to the very bottom of the cave, where I knew there was a large viewing platform down onto where the sea lions would normally lay.

I had drawn my pistol, holding the Beretta tightly in my right hand as I shone the flashlight around with my left. Even though the cave felt empty, it still held an almost threatening atmosphere. Along with a building sense of dread, which was beginning to well up in my gut as we approached the platform. Finally, we stepped onto the platform itself; in reality it was just a large, rather flat rock formation which had been encircled with a rather tall railing. The roar of the ocean was almost deafening in here, and every time it came in, I felt the stinging sensation of cold seawater splash my face. 

Thankfully, we saw no more sea lion heads on the railing posts here. In my head, I’d almost imagined that every post down here would have one mounted on it. Instead, all I saw were the dark shape of the rocks on the other side of it, and the even darker shape of the ocean as it rushed in and out below us. I let out a deep breath, then turned to Ray. “Well, I’m hoping by *that* lovely little spectacle we witnessed coming down here that you might believe me a little more by now, huh?” I said, my voice echoing in the large, open area. He kept his back to me, looking out towards the hole which led out to the open ocean. But I saw him nod his head. “While I’m not sure if I’m ready to believe that some kind of *Creature from the Black Lagoon* or *Humanoids from the Deep* monsters are behind it, yeah, I can believe you saw *something*, and we found his, their, whoever’s hideout where they’ve been” 

I’d been about to reply to him, when something dripped down onto my shoulder. I’d had the condensation which must’ve rose to the roof of the caves drip down onto me a few times on our descent, but this felt…*different*. It felt thicker, almost sticky in a way, and I tucked the pistol into the crook of my arm and reached out to touch whatever had dropped onto me with my fingers. I felt my heart begin to race in my chest as I pulled my fingers back and shined the beam of the flashlight on them. The dark red color was unmistakable. *Blood*. I swallowed hard, wiping my fingers on my jacket and snatching the Beretta back into a hand which now shook slightly. “Uh…R-Ray?” I asked, my shaking voice betraying the fear I began to feel envelop me. 

“What?” he whispered, turning to look at me. But as he did, I saw his eyes slide from my face, to the area on my shoulder where the..blood had dropped. And then they slid to something just over my right shoulder. I saw his face pale, his eyes growing about as wide as a human’s possibly could. A huge shiver went down my spine, as I felt like a character in a horror movie, who’d had something behind him the entire time and never realized it. *Oh, fuck my life; I really don’t want to turn around*. But I forced myself to, after moving forward a few steps first. And I’m pretty sure my face became as pale as the man’s standing beside me.

Neither one of us had shot a look at the back wall as we’d walked onto the viewing platform. Both of us had been too focused on the rocks and water in front of us, and too preoccupied in our own minds by the grotesque display of sea lion heads we’d seen. But compared to the sight before us, those might as well be freaking Christmas ornaments. There were decapitated heads mounted on the poles of the back wall railing here, alright. But they weren’t animal heads. I could see the fear plastered on every man and woman’s face; the mouths of a few of them were frozen open in an eternal scream, and the glassy eyes were wide and unseeing.

There were at least ten or twelve human heads there, and as I raised my gaze, along with my flashlight, I saw more perched on the small, rocky outcroppings going up to the ceiling. Where…*Oh, good Lord, almighty,* I could see…bodies. The headless bodies were above us, almost too many to count. They’d been hung by the ankles, using a strange, kelp like rope. I could see massive bites taken out of some, and others looked like a Neanderthal had strung them up and rubbed salt to preserve them for later. As I lowered my gaze, one face stood out to me, and I nearly threw up. The face of the man I’d spoken to, not even an hour and a half ago, the one who’d been dragged into the ocean, stared back at me. I could tell he’d died screaming. I pointed. “That-that’s the guy I spoke to tonight” I managed out. I saw Ray’s gaze flicker to the face, then back towards the horrific scene in front and above us. “Okay, this is the point where we get out of here and radio for backup” he said.

I nodded, beginning to move for the steps, when a feeling, *the* feeling, washed over me. The feeling of being observed was back, and my spine felt like it had chills continuously shooting up it. “Ohhh, fuck” I almost moaned out. “What?” Ray demanded, his grip growing tighter on the shotgun. I shot him a look, one which I know had to be filled with absolute dread and fear. I swallowed hard, then finally answered. “We’re not alone in here anymore”

As I finished my sentence, the sound which, having only heard once would already haunt my dreams for the rest of my life, came from behind us. The laugh, one which sounded like it was being done through a mouth of seawater, one which sounded like whatever was making it had just heard a hilarious joke. It was joined by a second, then a third, until the cave was awash with the sickening sound of sinister laughter. I slowly turned, realizing we’d left our backs open to the space beyond the railing. To the opening to the *sea*.

Even without aiming the flashlight, I knew they were there. Because I’d been right when I swore I’d seen red, glowing eyes staring at me from the water by the docks. I could see at least four or five pairs of them, staring at us from the dark. Ray spun around, aiming his shotgun towards them, and as the first reached up the grab the railing with the black claw I’d come to know far too well, I finally saw the creatures completely.

When Ray had made his crack about them resembling something out of an old B-horror movie, I don’t think he’d planned on being right. The closest comparison I can make would be similar to the monster on the poster for *Humanoids from the Deep*. They all had a humanoid shape to them, a large, slightly misshapen head adorning their shoulders. In the flashlight’s beams, the red glow of their eyes seemed to turn into an inky blackness. Black, fish like scales covered every square inch of their bodies, and seaweed and kelp clung to them as well. They almost seemed to wear it the same way a sniper would wear a ghillie suit made of leaves or twigs to escape the eye of his targets. The dominating feature on their faces was their mouths, one which stretched far too wide and large. They were filled with razor sharp, shark like teeth which reflected in the lights, and each curved up in the most nefarious and wicked grins I’d ever seen on any living being’s face. Black claws stuck out from both their hands and feet, looking just as sharp.

I saw all of this in what felt like minutes, but was, in reality only seconds. The first of them began to haul itself up and over the railing. That was when I felt Ray shove me from the side. “Time to go, Nate!” he shouted. I didn’t waste time playing the hero, aiming my gun and trying to take them all down. I’d seen far too many horror movies to know where *that* gets you. Instead, I turned and booked it for the bottom of the steep steps back up to the top of the cliff, away from the nightmare the normally happy cave system had once been. Behind me came two loud *booms* from Ray’s shotgun as he fired. I reached the bottom step and, resisting the urge to simply sprint up them, turned and aimed both my gun and flashlight back towards where I’d come.

Ray’s panicked and terrified face flashed into the light as he dashed towards me. Behind him, I saw the creature which had climbed over the railing first dashing behind him. Two huge gunshot wounds took up its chest, but it kept coming. I forced my hand still, concentrating on my aim as Ray ducked out of it. Without hesitating, I emptied the entire clip. Normally, my aim is always somewhat off; I can hit a decent general area, but I’d never do well in a sharpshooter competition. Now, though, for the first time in my life, my aim was completely on point. Almost all of the twelve or thirteen rounds slammed into the creature’s head, with one going through one of the eyes. It stopped, as did seemingly all the rest behind it. For a moment, it glowered at me with its remaining eye, and then it crumpled into a head on the ground. Dead.

For a moment, a feeling of triumph surged through me. *Take that, you scaly son of a bitch!* I screamed in my head. But it was chased away as a collection of roars; roars of absolute fury assaulted my ears. I felt the biggest feeling of fear and dread yet course through me. *Oh, shit. You just made them mad, Nate*. Before I could think of anything else, Ray began shoving me up the stairs. “GO!” he ordered, and I moved, ejecting the spent magazine and slapping in a new one as I did. The cave began to shudder with the impact of the creatures as they began their rage fueled charge at us. We weren’t simply prey to them anymore. We’d killed one of their own, and had thoroughly pissed them off. They were coming for revenge now.

I slipped slightly on the steps as I led the way up. Looking up, I could barely see the opening, the night sky dotted with stars seeming like a guiding light. “Keep going!” Ray shouted, firing again. I couldn’t see the stairs below us anymore, but I could only imagine the creatures were jamming themselves onto it in pursuit of us. Suddenly, a squawk of static came from the radio on Ray’s belt. Just faintly over the roar of the creatures, I heard a man’s voice yell out, cut off by the static coming from the interference the rocky walls of the cave had on the radio. “Ray…me up….back…people here…retreat…” Looking up again, I saw flashing lights splashing the upper walls of the cave. *Thank you, God, the cavalry’s here!*

That’s when something shot out of the darkness from my right. Tendrils of pain shot through my right arm, and I went sprawling forwards, slamming my head into one of the railing’s poles. I tried climbing to my feet, pulling on my right arm as the pain seemed to intensify. And I screamed. Coming out of the darkness was one of the monstrosity’s claws. One which had locked around my arm, the claws sinking into my skin and drawing blood. I saw the glowing red eyes appear from where it disappeared to. The claw shook me like a rag doll, and I felt the Beretta torn from my grip, seeing it disappear into the blackness. I still held my flashlight in my free hand, and I shone it forwards, revealing the creature which clung to the railing.

It had somehow climbed the sheer cliff face up to me, cutting off my escape and lying in wait. The grin on the creature was gone: instead, a look of absolute hatred shone from its black eyes. For a moment, I thought it would pull itself up and over the railing. Instead, and to my horror, it began to pull me towards it, *over* the railing. “Ray! Help me!” I screamed out. I could still here the thunder of his shotgun just below me, but I didn’t hear him respond. I screamed again. “Ray!” The shotgun stopped firing, replaced by an echoing silence. I shot another look at the creature which had me in its clutches. Now it *was* smiling again, the most evil and malicious smile I’d ever seen. It began to laugh its horrible laugh, then pulled on my arm again. I dropped the flashlight, reaching out and locking my fingers into the railing mounted on the opposite side of the steps. But I knew it was a fight I couldn’t win. Tears began to fall from my eyes as my arm was pulled on harder, the pain surging through me from it becoming almost unbearable. I opened my mouth and screamed as I closed my eyes, not for Ray this time, or anyone else, but simply to make what I thought would be the final sound I would on this earth.

The thunder of the gunshot so close to my head sent a painful ringing through my eardrums, almost deafening me. Instantly, I felt the claw loosen and let go of me, and I fell into a heap on the mossy stone. A new collective roar came from below as I felt myself pulled to my feet. I opened my eyes to see Ray, who had put my good arm over his shoulder. I could see a large slash in one of his thighs. He didn’t look at me, only ahead at the lights above. “Move your ass if you want to see the sunrise tomorrow!” he ordered. I didn’t hesitate. I moved my legs as fast as I could, my damaged arm dangling at my side. Together, and with the sounds of our pursuers growing ever closer, we dashed up the slowly spiraling steps.

As we reached the second to last level, I looked up and winced at the flashlight shone in my face. At the multiple lights, actually. Dozens of serious faces stared down at us. One, an older man with grey hair and a mustache, motioned to us. “Come on, get up here!” he shouted. We didn’t need any encouragement, though. Neither one of us stopped for a second, even though I could tell by the sounds that the creatures had stopped chasing us. As we stepped out into the night, I saw at least four or five black SUVs with flashing lights coming from behind their windshields packed into the rather small parking lot. I saw a rather large cargo van behind them with its rear doors wide open. There were at least a dozen highly armed men in the lot, each of them holding military style shotguns and rifles. I noted as a man reached out to grab me from Ray that they didn’t have any police patches or insignias of any kind on their uniforms.

As I was helped to the van, which turned out to have a medical station in it, I cast a glance behind me and saw the grey haired man and about seven or eight men head down into the caves. “Tell-tell them to watch themselves!” I said weakly, my head beginning to feel dizzy from the blood loss from my arm. The man helping me gave out a soft, almost amused snort. “Don’t worry, son” he said gently as he sat me down on the back bumper, “They know what they’re doing”

Ray sat down on the other side of me, and as the man tended to both of our wounds, putting a patch on my arm which he said would hold until I got to a hospital, and the same for Ray’s leg, we both stared out at the entrance, waiting to see who, or *what*, would emerge. After about ten or fifteen minutes, the men reappeared. The grey haired man handed his rifle to another, then strode across the parking lot to us. “You boys are damn lucky to have survived, you know” he said gravely, “You’re some of the only ones that have after seeing them that close”

I shot the man a look. “You mean you *know* about those things?” I asked him. He nodded. “We’ve known about them for a very long time, son” he answered. “We’ve been tracking them from here, to the east and west coasts of North America, to Europe, Africa, hell, pretty much every coastline in the world” I saw Ray raise an eyebrow. The man’s gaze seemed to harden as he looked from Ray to me. “I understand you’re a journalist, am I right?” he asked, gesturing to me. After a moment, I nodded. He nodded as well, then locked eyes with me. “Well, I’m afraid to tell you, that you’re not going to be printing a story about this. You’re not going to be saying *anything* about this”

I felt my jaw drop open. “Are-are you kidding me?!” I almost shouted, “People need to be warned about these fucking things, they *need* to know!” The man’s eyes almost seemed to harden more. “I *said*, you’re not going to be saying or printing *anything* about what you’ve seen" He narrowed his eyes. "*Ever*” he declared. The message was clear, along with the less than implied threat which lay behind his green eyes. I was staring into the eyes of someone who, if I seemed like I’d make trouble for them, could easily make me disappear. I felt a sense of rage boil up inside me, but I held my tongue, shooting daggers at the man instead. After a few moments of the staring match, he turned to Ray. “And you’re not going to say anything either, Detective” he said simply. I expected Ray to protest, but instead, and to my surprise, he simply nodded, looking for all the world like everything had drained out of him.

“Good” the man said, turning away, “We’ll see each other again once you recover in the hospital. Some of my men will take you there now, and one will return your cruiser to your precinct, Detective. For now, we’re done here” And with that, he walked away, back towards the steps. Ray and I were led to one of the black SUVs and helped inside. As it started up and began to turn around, I looked back one final time. I saw two men hauling a stretcher out from the steps. I couldn’t see what they had on it completely, due to the white sheet covering it. But I saw the black scaled arm, with the claw spilling out over the side.

We were taken to the hospital, where the men escorting us told the nurse’s on duty we’d been in an accident. The nurses didn’t bother questioning *what* kind of accident it had been, only rushed us both to be seen by doctors. I was taken to surgery, where I had my torn open arm inspected and put back together. The surgeon on duty said I was lucky; I would keep my arm, and eventually get all use of it back. I found out later Ray’s injury hadn’t been as bad as mine was. He simply had his leg stitched up, and was kept overnight for observation.

We were visited by the grey haired man, flanked by two of his cronies the next day, as he had said. He never gave me a chance to speak, not caring what I had to say. In a very serious, almost deadly voice, he told me that the group he worked for would pay for my hospital bills, along with compensation, which he told me was for “helping them finally obtain a specimen” He also made it perfectly clear again that, if I breathed a word of what I’d seen, that there would be dire consequences for doing sore. I had paper after paper placed on the food tray in front of me, all of which I was forced to sign against my will, saying I wouldn’t say anything before they left.

Which I’m breaking now by telling you. Seriously, I don’t really care what happens to me after posting this. Yes, I fully admit I’m afraid of what’s going to happen to me when I post it, but my sense of duty is stronger. I’m a journalist. I have a duty to the public to tell them about the truth. About anything that may pose a danger to them. Even if they don’t believe me.

And I’m pretty sure you won’t. After all, there were no news reports, local or otherwise about the creatures. Or the vanished homeless people. There was nothing said about what Ray and I had seen down in the sea lion caves. Hell, from what I hear, they’re due to open in a few weeks for tourists. The thought of happy people, families, children traipsing through an area where all that horror was so little time ago. It makes me feel sick and shiver.

I’ve seen Ray once since then. He wouldn’t tell me much, only that all the files from the case had been taken. Old Fred and the woman’s deaths had been labeled as murders from other homeless, something done for money or drugs. The case had been permanently closed. He also told me that the chief had been acting odd ever since, ordering him to never mention the case again. “I’m leaving town” he confided in me as we sat in a bar, my arm in a sling as we drank. “I’m transferring to somewhere far away from here. I just. I can’t bear being here anymore” He locked eyes with me as he paid for both our drinks and stood to leave. “I suggest you do the same”

So, that’s what I’m doing. I’m packing a few bags, and calling my landlord to tell him I’m leaving. I’ll tell him to throw away or sell my furniture. I’ve already withdrawn a large amount of money from my bank account, courtesy of the grey haired man and whoever he works for, whether it’s the government, or someone else. And I’m going to get into my car and go. I’m going to try and disappear, somewhere far away from the sea. I can’t stand being near it anymore. Not after learning what lurks below the waves.

But not before I warn you. Like I said, I don’t care what happens once I get the word out. You need to know. You *all* need to know. Those *things* seem to have moved on from this town. There’s been no further disappearances since that night. I can only assume they’ve moved on somewhere else, somewhere far away from here.

I realize I can’t discourage you from staying away from the ocean. That’s almost completely impossible. The ocean is far too vital to humanity's survival. But, I can warn you this: Stay away from the beaches and the shorelines at night. It doesn’t matter whether you live in the US, or anywhere else. Stay inside, lock your doors and windows, and draw your curtains.

Because if you go out there, you may attract the attention of something you really don’t want to have on you. Something which hunts along just about every coast in the world. You may see glowing red eyes staring at you from the darkness. And you may hear that vile, horrific laughter, something I hear every night in my dreams, chasing me from sleep to bolt upright, covered in sweat.

And it may just be the last sound you ever hear.
