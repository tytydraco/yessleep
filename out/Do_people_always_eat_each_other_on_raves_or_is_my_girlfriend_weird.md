 

My girlfriend is quite different from me. She's what you would call  an alt-chick. Wears super revealing clothes, always in black, however on the contrary she  likes to do super colorful make up. One that I don't like at all sometimes. She has a lip piercing and one on her eyebrow as well. I don't mind that. Both of them are kinda hot, cause she has this very grey eyes and piercing really underlines it. She listens to techno, all the time. I'm not kidding, she always has that one Bluetooth earphone in her ear. We met on a discord server not a long time ago and hit it off right away. We meet sometimes at my house, or just go on dates. Me on the other hand am the absolute opposite. I hate going out, it's always best for me to just chill home and game. Now thing is that there is this even that took place, which always rubs me the weird way, maybe hearing a third person opinion can really help clear things up for me, if this is a regular thing that's done in the raver community, or should I be worried?

Anyways everything was going smoothly, until that day..

"Hey, so do you want to meet my friends?"

As always it just came out of nowhere, just like most of the ideas from her, she would just gaze at me and randomly come up with a suggestion, that's why I thought she was super fun.

"Yeah of course I do, honestly, I thought you would never ask."

"Awesome, we can just go ahead today."

That suggestion was a bit weird, cause it was almost midnight, she would hang out at my place at night as well, but like going out to meet her new friends at this time, or even worse, having them over wasn't what I really wanted.

"hey don't look at me like that." Her eyes started gazing me again. "I mean all of them are planning to go on this event, there already at the place, I was thinking we could go as well, plus it's a huge event for techno lovers."

I had my second thoughts about this as well. I mean I'm a pretty simple dude, who spends most of his time at the computer gaming, rave? I really didn't know if I wanted to go to a place like that.

"Hey let's just give it a try, if you won't like it, we can leave, I don't want to force you to do something. I Just want you to meet my friends."

She was really cute, so cute I could not resist her offer, so the next thing I knew I was standing in the line of this not so fancy looking club, which was underground and on top of that line was huge. People in the line looked super creepy too. But nobody was bothering us so I was just fine. Come to think of it nothing was unusual at that point. People weren't even creepy; they were just unconventional? After what felt like an eternity, we were finally in.

Now this is the part where it got a bit weird. Music was really loud, lighting too and there were so many people, I felt really lost, my girlfriend was the one leading me on, finally we got to the spot where her friends were sitting down on large leather sofas, here music wasn't as loud, and you could have an actual conversation. Her friends were cool I give you that. piercings, tattoos, colorful hair, make up a bit unconventional clothes. It was more like a group of friends, boys and girls both. I couldn't make out their faces well because of slight darkness but they all seemed fine.

"Shall we start?"

After a small exchange of conversation, one of the boys spoke up and started passing out something, he was being secretive and finally I looked at the little paper piece in my girl's hand.

"It's going to be an adventure; will you ride it with me?"

She smiled and I don't know why but I nodded, it was weird, because I've never tried drugs in my life, I have no idea why I agreed, I didn't want to seem as a dork? Because I didn't want to upset my girlfriend? Because I wanted to feel what it's like to be high? Or maybe because of her grey eyes, which were almost hypnotizing?"

She put the paper tab on her tongue and started kissing me, first I felt weirded out that her friends were watching, but she was really into the kiss, plus my girlfriend is very fucking hot and hard to resist so I just played along as well. We've never kissed like that before, she was putting her all into it, pushing her tongue into my mouth and I could feel the tab in there as well. Our tongues were melting into each other and she wasn't stopping, her slender fingers where sliding in my hair and I could feel all of her on my body it was crazy. I slipped my gaze to others and the weird part is that most of them were making out as well. For a second she stopped kissing me and stared into my eyes.

"Let's go somewhere private."

Damn that's all I wanted to hear. She held my hand and was my guide. All of a sudden I felt like the music around me sounded different. It was weird as if I was feeling the music. I started to feel cold, but sweat was coming down my body at the same time. As we ran into the bathroom I managed to see myself in the mirror at the sink.. my pupils... were so big.. it looked as if I had pitch black eyes. My heart started to beat faster. She just went into one of the empty cabins and pushed me inside as well.  
We started to kiss. But it was different this time. I felt all of her. my heart was beating even faster, as if I could feel her touch a lot stronger, as if I felt her in a completely different way than I have ever felt her. But all of a sudden I felt really uncomfortable, my lips started to feel weird.

"Hey stop."

But she wasn't stopping, I tried to push her away, but she was very firm, so finally I yanked her off of me and that's when I felt really weird. As if everything was morphing and changing shape in front of me but I could still make out that her lips were covered with red liquid. It took me a moment to process what was the uncomfortable feeling on my lip, I felt with my finger that something wet was there as well.

"God, you taste so good. I want more!"

She just screamed it out and what creeped me out the most were her eyes. From my favorite grey they were turning into crimson red. It took me a minute to realize what was going on. She was on me again and now the uncomfortable feeling started to feel on my neck, where she was kissing me. I felt strange light headed. And that's when I felt the sharp pain at my neck. Something snapped in my head and I pushed her away real hard this time, the pressure made her to hit the door and open it up. As she was laying on the ground I looked at the mirror in front of me and I felt really strange.

As if the pale person covered in crimson wasn't me at all. As if I was looking at a completely different person. The music was becoming heavier and heavier, I heard words, but I couldn't make out what they meant. The music had a strange feeling as if it was trying to charm me as well. But that's when the pain in my neck woke me up once again. It seemed that she bit me?

I just couldn't move, the music was becoming heavier and heavier, I felt as if I was being dragged somewhere down, I didn't want to move at all, I just wanted to let the feeling drag me down. But that's when I saw my girl getting up from the floor. She was covered in my blood, her red eyes where shining at me, but what creeped me out even more was her smile. I could see two sharp teeth glimmer out of her mouth.

"Just give in, come on, let me taste you one more time!"

That's when it clicked, I needed to run away. I turned around and stormed out of the bathroom, But I could feel she was running after me, I ran as fast as I could, in the club lights have shifted from colorful to red and I could see, even though everything was morphing in my eyes, I could clearly see people biting on other people, I could clearly see blood, .as I ran I even got to the leather sofas my girl's friends where hanging out on. I Just saw the weirdest thing there. All of them where naked and doing...weird things to each other.

"Hey did it kick in? Just don't resist it, it's gonna start being awesome!"

Yelled out the guy who passed us the tab from the start, his lips here covered in blood as he was holding what seemed like a dead naked girl at his chest.

"What the hell is going on?"

I just screamed out. But he kept on laughing, exposing his white fangs covered in blood. And the people around him... All of them held in their hands what felt like corpses, or just half dead people, covered in blood as well.

I felt like something was at the edge of my throat, I just couldn't run anymore, I just leaned at the wall and threw everything that I ate that day up. As I was vomiting, I started to feel a bit better, I could think straight, but the rush of adrenaline still made my heartbeat faster. 

"Do you need help?"

All I could do was nod.

"People are dying here."

I yelled out as fast as I could and looked at my rescuer. It was a girl, I couldn't make out, but she looked pretty and concerned.

"You look really bad. First time? I think we need to get you out of here."

"Please, you need to hurry.."

She just held my hand and guided me outside. I ran as fast as I could. Thankfully I was finally able to sober up. I ran into my house and locked the door.   
Ever since then my girlfriend has been texting me non-stop, saying that this is all normal. That people on raves do it all the time. That I'm just acting out too much. She even came over, I didn't open the door, cause I'm feeling really scared. My food supply is running out, so I'll be needing to go out soon. I'm kind of scared of seeing her. On the other hand, maybe I am just acting out too much, I don't know, maybe you guys can help me out here, do this kind of things are really okay to happen at the rave clubs? maybe I am overreacting.   


Either way I'm gonna need to go out to buy some food and I think she is waiting outside my door, what do I do?
