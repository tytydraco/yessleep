This is gonna be the Best Halloween Ever! Grandma went out to buy extra candy – it’s a quick jaunt, and I’m okay being left alone – she’ll be back in fifteen minutes. Twenty, tops.
 
Now’s my chance! I grab a chair and put it directly underneath the entrance to the attic. I stand on my tip-toes, but can’t reach, so I grab a broom and pry it open; then I jump, grab hold, and lift myself into the attic, which is way more difficult than expected. But I did it! I'm terribly excited. And nervous. What's up here? No one speaks of Grandma's attic. Ever.
 
Sudden darkness surprises me. I reach for my phone, and curse my stupidity. My phone is on the coffee table. I’d go back and get it, but there isn’t enough time. Plus, the chair tipped over, so getting down means jumping, which will hurt. Meh, I’ll worry about that when the time comes. First things first, time to explore.

The heat up here is tremendous, the air thick and stale; the floorboards creak as I creep around, looking for a light switch.  Something squeaks, startling me, and I fall face-first into a giant cobweb. 

“Ah, crap!” I shout, which is dumb. I just swallowed a mouthful of web. Gagging and coughing, I wipe the icky stuff from my mouth.
 
As my eyes adjust, I get anxious. The entire attic is filled with cobwebs, and not the normal kind, these are huge and elaborate. Veiny like my grandma’s hands. I try moving, but the web holds its grip, sticking to me like superglue. Again, I reach for my non-existent phone and curse my stupidity.

“No worries,” I tell myself, near-panic, “Grandma should be home soon.”
 
I wait for what seems an eternity. She really should be home by now. Without my phone, I have no idea how much time has passed. It feels like hours, but probably mere minutes. Growing more and more impatient, I give it everything I’ve got, trying desperately to free myself, but I get further entangled. 

“This is nuts.” 

My mind turns against me. Maybe the spiderweb is alive. Maybe it’s lonely, trapped inside this attic all these years, and I’m its prisoner. It’s probably hungry. I look up and groan. Dangling above me is the scariest spider I’ve ever seen, big as a tarantula, huge and hairy and hideous. Its beady black eyes stare into mine, daring me to move, its orange-black tentacles teasing me as it scuttles about. 
 
I hate spiders. Always have. When I was six or seven, my older sister hid one in my sandwich, and I ate it. Everyone teased and called me Spider Boy. Now this? If my bratty sister finds out, she’ll tell everyone, and I’ll be the laughing stock at school.
 
Again I try freeing myself, thrashing and flailing my skinny arms, but nothing works. By now, my entire body is entwined. This makes zero sense; I may be small, but still. I try again, only this time slowly and meticulously. I’ll wiggle my way free. That outta work. 

It doesn’t.
 
When is Grandma getting home? Surely, it’s been a half hour by now, but I can’t tell for sure. Not having my phone sucks. What did I do to deserve this? I mean, trapped in a spider web? Who heard of such a thing?
        	
Something heavy lands on my head: The giant spider. 

“AAAHH!” 

Frantic, I swat it away.

“OUCH!” 

It bit my hand. I can only hope it isn’t venomous. Without my phone, I can’t check. As I flounder about, the thing flies off and lands next to me. We have a stare-off; one I’m destined to lose. 
 
The heat is getting to me, my armpits are soaked. I wipe my forehead, which is a mistake. I’m covered in thick, ropy web. “This sucks,” I complain. “There must be a way to free myself.”
 
Straight ahead is a large trunk covered in cobwebs, beside it, a busted ironing board; boxes and boxes of books line the slanted walls. On a small table in the corner is a bunch of fancy tea cups with blue patterns on them; like everything else, they’re coated in cobwebs. 

Strange noises. 

“On no. Please no.”
 
Spiders. 

Crawling out of every crevasse, tap, tap, tapping their tiny toes – or whatever it is they walk on – as they go. Yuck. I hate spiders. Have I said that already? Cuz it’s really, really true. Adrenaline arrives like cavalry, giving me super powers. 
 
“It’s now or never.” 
 
Fists clenched, screaming like an idiot, I charge, freeing myself, and end up smashing into the table with the tea cups; cups explode, my skinny body slips and falls, and everything goes dark. 

I must’ve passed out. My head hurts. My body feels like a dumb truck. Before I can open my eyes, I feel something crawling across my face. 

"Oh God, no."

My eyes snap open.
 
“AAAHH!” 
 
A cluster of creepy spiders are crawling across me. And I’m snagged. The web is holding me hostage. Stupid spiderweb. I’m freaking out. The spiders are gonna eat me!  This is ridiculous. Where the hell is Grandma?
 
A thought arrives: Maybe she’s home! 
 
“Help!” I shout, hoping she’ll hear me. “I’m trapped inside a spiderweb!” 
 
Nothing.
 
The shrillness of my voice shocks me. So do the spiders. Like soldiers, they're preparing for battle. Tap, tap tap, they march across the dusty attic floor, attacking me. Hundreds of them, maybe more, creeping along my pant legs, crawling inside my T-shirt. I feel them in my hair. And I’m stuck! Can't move. I’m more terrified than I’ve even been in my life. I really don’t wanna touch one. I might get bit again.
 
Panicking, I look around, desperate to free myself. "Aha!" The broken tea cups! I stretch out my hand. Not the one with the bite, my other. It isn’t as strong, but beggars can’t be choosers.
 
My little fingers inch closer, stretching as far as humanly possible. Almost there. Soooo close. Meanwhile, the biggest spider in the world is scurrying up my arm, trying to stop me. It’s surprisingly heavy. And ugly. With tremendous effort, I snatch a shard. It’s sharp, and I don’t wanna cut myself. Using the sharp end, I slice and carve and cut the rope-like web. There’s so much of it! It's taking longer than it should. 
 
SNAP. The final thread give way. 

"I did it!" I leap to my feet, careful not to snag myself again, then I go on a squashing spree. Phew! Killing spiders is a daunting task. Growing weary, I tiptoe towards the exit. I look down and frown; the chair is gone. I forgot.

The house shakes. The front door slams. 

“Toby? You home?”
 
“Dad?”
 
Is it really him?
 
“Up here!” I cry. 
 
My father’s worried-sick face greets me. Looking up, he says, “What did you get yourself into now?”
 
He helps me down and cleans me off, then tells me how he’s been texting for nearly an hour. Turns out, Grandma was in a car accident. She’s fine, only minor scrapes and bruises, but her car is totaled. All I can do is jabber on and on. I’m still frantic. My hand is sore, but that's the least of my worries. My father is holding something. A bag. When I see what's inside, I go into shock. 
 
"Oh, no. Please, no." 
 
Is this some kind of sick joke? Must be. If so, I don’t like it. Not one bit. He hands me my costume, but I refuse to take it. No. Freakin’. Way.
 
“I knew you’d like it,” he says, ruffling my hair, which is still coated in cobwebs. 
 
“I’m staying inside tonight,” I pout.
 
“What? Why?” The shock on his face is as real as my swollen right hand.

Then it hits me. This is no joke. 
 
“No way I’m wearing that costume!” 
 
My father frowns, the worry on his face worsening. A ping of guilt rips through my heart, but I’m adamant. Nothing will change my mind. Period. 

“Why?” he asks, eyes pleading.

I choke up. I hate seeing him looking so sad. I gulp.
