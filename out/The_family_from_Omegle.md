Hey guys, first of all this story isn’t mine. I saw it at a small blog around 2009, and at the time I investigated untill I could talk to the author, Fred, who at the time sent me proofs (videos, printscreens, phone records) that this story is real. I could find it in a couple Brazilian blogs searching about it, but I clearly remember seen it in first hand. 


I will translate the whole text from Portuguese, so I am sorry if my English is not conventional or if I mislead one word or two. I am far away of being a terror fan, but this one story scared the sh1t out of me so I could remember it ten years later.


So, I will stop talking and tell the f*cking history now:

It was 2:30am and since he couldn’t sleep, Fred was using the internet. At that night, he decided to use Omegle. To those who don’t know: Omegle is a website where you can talk to random strangers over the camera, the site will pick anyone in the world to talk to you.
Fred was looking for someone interesting to talk to, so finally that someone appeared. Apparently, was a man, sat backwards to the camera. He was wearing a black hat at a empty room, with a very weak lighting.



Fred said was a joke:
“Hey man, the camera is at the other side!”
So the guy turned back to the camera, but Fred couldn’t see his face because he was wearing a bizarre mask, maybe made by plaster or wax, with two big eyes with big pupiles, and a smiley mouth maybe painted by lipstick.



Fred started talking with the stranger, telling him that the mask was pretty scary (duh) and asking why he choose not to show his face (he thought it was a prank, a fetish or something like that). But the man said nothing, he was static in front of the camera. The only thing he did was tilt his head to the left or to the right. 
His audio was a weird noise, like there was a ventilator next to the microphone or something.


As he didn’t interact, Fred turned the chat off to look to someone else to talk. The page showed that the chat looked for another random stranger, but it went back to the same guy with the mask. Now, he was closer to the camera and the noise was louder.
“You, again?” said Fred.
Then, the masked man started typing:
“LET IN.”
Fred, as a joke, said:
“Only if you bring marijuana”
But the stranger continued:
“WE ARE FAMILY LUIZEL MAHKER UYHLA MAHKER SARA MAHKER SYLVIA MAHKER STRENIO MAHKER MAHKER MAHKER MAHKER MAHKER”


Fred asked: “Okay, where you guys from?” without asking the question, he just continued:
“WE ARE A FAMILY LUIZEL MAHKER UYHLA MAHKER SARA MAHKER SYLVIA MAHKER STRENIO MAHKER MAHKER MAHKER MAHKER MAHKER LET US IN LET US IN LET US IN LET US IN LET US IN LET US IN”


After that, the man started to answer with random numbers, maybe phone numbers, maybe geographic coordinates, maybe hours and minutes or dates, Fred couldn’t distinguish, so he asked for the meaning of those numbers. But the stranger didn’t stop, and continued sending numbers, at the same time writing “LET US IN” and “WE ARE FAMILY LUIZEL MAHKER UYHLA MAHKER SARA MAHKER SYLVIA MAHKER STRENIO MAHKER MAHKER MAHKER MAHKER MAHKER LET US IN LET US IN”



The weirdest thing of it all is that meanwhile somebody was texting, the masked guy wouldn’t move at all. Fred thought maybe it was a recording (nowadays I would be sure it was a bot lol) and didn’t care much.
Fred started to have fun with that conversation, thinking that, maybe it was a prank, and Fred also knew the other users of that site would’ve looking for sexting and as he was bored, he kept talking to the stranger, encouraging that weird and totally random conversation. Out of the blue, the guy stopped answering the chat and started looking straight to the camera.



So, Fred cellphone started ringing, the caller ID was showing a enormous number with a area code which wasn’t Brazilian.
Kinda scared, Fred thought it was better not to answer (here in Brazil we are very used to random numbers calling us lol) and thought it was nothing. But started ringing again and again, so he choose to answer just to tell the caller to stop bothering him. When he answered no one said nothing, and he heard a kind of instrumental lullaby. 


“What is that? Who the fuck is this?” he asked.
The sound was pretty scary. After some seconds, the noise changed to a old country song, with people tap dancing, clapping and screaming “Hey!”. At that time Fred thought he was insane. After that, a voice who was like from a old 80’s comercial, kind of nasal and stuffy started to say a foreign language, and after that a very similar voice spoke in Portuguese: “The show will start!” followed by applause with a circus sound in the background. So a interference noise started and the call went off.


Soon after, the masked man reconnected to the chat: “LET IT IN”.
Fred started to get scared. At first, he even thought it might be some funny guy playing a joke.
“Man, this isn’t funny. Enough with the clowning, that’s it.”
But the masked man only replied:
“WE ARE FAMILY LUIZEL MAHKER UYHLA MAHKER SARA MAHKER SYLVIA MAHKER STRENIO MAHKER MAHKER MAHKER MAHKER MAHKER LET IT IN LET IT IN”
Fred's cell phone rang again, he answered it and it was the same number, the same strange call. 

When the call ended, the screen went black for a few seconds and then suddenly came back. But the masked man was no longer in the chat. Now, Fred saw the image of a dark street, with only lampposts and some houses visible. The image began to move, as if the person filming had started walking down the street.


Fred then realized that it was the street where his house was. When the image began to approach his house, Fred ran into the living room, slowly opened the window and looked out the window that faced the street. So, the footage reached the front of his house. But Fred saw nothing, absolutely nothing and no one on the street. 


The street was deserted and silent. A zoom in gave a close-up of Fred's frightened face in the window, so Fred quickly closed the window (this also appeared in the image) and after checking that the street door was securely locked, he ran back to his room and locked the front door. room inside, terrified.


Then suddenly the man with the mask appeared in the image again and typed:
“LET IT IN LET IT IN LET IT IN LET IT IN LET IT IN LET IT IN”.
Then Fred replied that he would call the police, and the man remained there for a few more minutes, filming his house.


Startled, Fred disconnected from the chat and left Omegle. He looked for a logical explanation for it, but found none. He had thought it might be a joke from someone who knew him, but that would be a very unlikely hypothesis. 


How would it be possible for an acquaintance to log onto Omegle at the same time as him and find him among thousands of people online all over the world? How could this person come to your house without disconnecting the internet and filming his house, without Fred seeing anyone on the street? So what would that be? A hacker? Or was it a ghost using technology to haunt people? Fred never believed in ghosts, but it was all very strange and he couldn't find a rational explanation for what was happening.


He then decided to research those geographic coordinates that the masked man had sent him, and after throwing them into Google Maps, he discovered that they led to an empty plot of land in Russia.


A few minutes later, Fred received a friend request on Facebook from a certain Luizel Mahker. Upon seeing this name, Fred felt a chill and immediately refused the request. Then, trying to find out something about the mysterious man, Fred visited his profile. The profile photo was of the same man from Omegle, with the same black hat and the same sinister mask, but it was an old photo. The profile said it was from Russia, but it looked like a fake profile. There were no posts, just some old photos. They were photos of girls next to the masked man. 


There were also old photos of women with children and babies and some captions in Russian, which translated into Portuguese said:
“Mother Uyhla” and “Grandma Mahker”.
Suddenly, Fred received an inbox message from the same Luizel Mahker saying:
“LET’S GO IN WE’RE FAMILY”.
Fred immediately blocked Luizel Mahker's profile.


And that’s all the story. There’s versions where Fred’s dead and a bunch of stuff just to get more people scared. It’s not true. I talked to the guy and he was pretty much alive.
