I kissed her lips and her eyes met mine. Her eyes were a unique shade of blue I could swim in all day. 

“Isn’t she lovely” a fire lit within my soul as Stevie wonder sang out some truth from the speakers of a DJ in dress clothes. 

“I’ll be right back” I gave her a smile and looked back as she walked back to her friends . I wanted to never leave the moment but nature called.

I walked in the bathroom and seen a bunch of other boys dressed in their tuxes combing their hair, giving themselves pep talks, hearing some talking about how tonight is the night they get laid. 

Chad walked in and patted me on the back.

“I see your old man let you borrow his mustang. What year model is it?”

“1969.” 

“It sure is nice. Bet Elizabeth felt nice In it.” He patted my back again “see you later, tiger.” 

He walked out and I was wiping my hands off with paper towels. I looked one last time in the mirror before I went back out to look for my Cinderella. But something weird happened.

I walked out of the bathroom and everyone was gone. No one was in the room  besides me. Cups were on the ground, some confetti, lights were still moving but no music. All the teachers were gone too. My stomach felt like it had knots. 

I went back in the bathroom, there was a few guys in there when I left. It was completely empty too. 

There was no way I was being pranked. There wasn’t windows in the bathroom and there was no way a whole senior class could get out in the time it took for me to take a whizz. 

I walked back out and heard footsteps. I seen a man walking to one of the tables, sipping on a cup of punch. He looked up at me. It was Principal Pack. 

“Sit down, kid.” 

I froze in fear. I looked around as if I could find some sort of escape

“Now, kid.” He grunted.

I walked over to him and looked over my shoulder. I just felt like something was going to attack me. 

He pushed another cup forward.

“Drink it.” 

I looked down at the punch cup and everything in me told me not to do it. 

“I said drink it!” His eyes turned pitch black and it sounded like four other voices blended in with his. 

I picked up the cup and stared it down. I felt like maybe, just maybe I could run.

“I’ll pop your head like a fucking pimple if you don’t. You and everyone you love.”

I pushed back the cup and gulped down the punch in two big swallows. It tasted normal. He let out a chuckle. 

“Let me make this clear to you kid, let me make this very clear. You shit head kids love to make my life Hell. And you do especially. I know it was you who did the senior pranks. You’re the one who sprayed liquid ass spray in my office, threw toilet paper on my car, and it’s finally gonna bite you in the butt. Enjoy your night.”

He clapped his hands and I was in the bathroom again. I walked out and seen Elizabeth with her back turned to her friends. 

“Hey, gorgeous. How about another dance?”

A deep and scary voice replied “I’d love that.” 

She turned around and looked different. Her eyes were bright purple, skin was peeled. Maggots were crawling out of her mouth and nose. 

I let out a scream and fell over. I looked around and people were staring at me. She reached down.

“What’s going on?” 

I pushed myself up and took off running. I spent the night crying in the car. I knew she was embarrassed. I left her alone at prom. I loved her, I knew we were meant to be. 

The next Monday at school, she came up to me in the hallway and tapped my shoulder.

I turned around and this time it looked like her face was melting and wings sprawled out of her back.

“What you did this weekend was really messed up.” 

I let out another loud scream.

“This isn’t funny,” she put her arms on me and I felt a burning sensation. It felt like I was on fire. I grabbed my math book and smacked her with it. :she began sobbing and told me that we were through.

Some guy seen what I did and I got my ass kicked. I looked up after a teacher pulled him off me and I seen Principal Pack standing back with his cup of coffee. He smiled at me and took a big gulp. 

I got suspended, no one really liked me after that. Elizabeth lost all feelings for me. I wrote her a letter and explained what happened but she never believed me.

I came back and asked him in his office what could I do to reverse whatever he did. He began to laugh and punched himself in the eye a couple times. He called the resource officer and told him that I assaulted him. I got expelled and sent to juvie. 

It’s probably been ten years. I checked her Facebook recently and seen she has a fiancé and life is great for her. She finally owns a local coffee shop that she always talked about. She looked lovely in her pictures. 

I stopped outside her shop and peeked in to see if anything has changed, nothing has.


It really breaks my heart. I don’t know what to do.
