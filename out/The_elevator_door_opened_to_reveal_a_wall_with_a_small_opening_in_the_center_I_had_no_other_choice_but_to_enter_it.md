I entered the elevator alone, exhausted and ready to go home. After spending the past few hours doing overtime to finish all my paperwork, I wanted nothing more than to plop on my bed and rest.

My trip home was supposed to be uneventful, just like any other night. However, as I stood there in the elevator and watched the numbers on the display go down, I was surprised to see it go past the ground floor and continue its descent.

Initially I wasn’t too concerned. It was just a minor inconvenience. At least, that’s what I thought at first. Being in a faulty elevator was not good, but I thought that the worst that could happen was for it to head to the basement floor. In that event all I had to do was get off and take the stairs up, because I sure wasn’t going to stick around a broken elevator.

But when I saw the numbers on the display continue to go down, rocket past the basement, and reach negative numbers, I gradually realized that something was terribly wrong. 

Staring at the display with wide eyes, I felt shock and fear mix within me. I then began to wonder if it was some kind computer glitch. It seemed like the logical reason, because I was sure that elevators were not meant to display negative numbers. 

But it couldn’t be just a glitch. I could feel the elevator continue its descent, going down and down, to floors that I didn’t even know existed in the building. I wondered how this was even possible. Wasn’t the basement floor supposed to be the last one? Were there other floors that weren’t listed here?. 

This worried me a lot and I could feel the panic within me rise. Where was it going? How was this even possible? These thoughts bombarded my mind, as I watched the display tell me that I was in the negative eighty-eighth floor.

Scared, I pressed the emergency button, but to no avail. It remained silent, giving no alarm to the current situation I was in. Frustrated, I pushed it again. Once more, it gave no reaction.

Realizing it was useless to try and make it work, I then decided to then press the button for the emergency phone. But that too failed. Instead of connecting me to someone who could help me, it just remained silent, almost mocking me as I stood there and continuously pressed it.

Desperate, I then grabbed my phone, hoping to call a friend who might inform building management about my predicament. However, as I stared at the device, I felt my heart drop upon seeing that there was no signal.

At that point it dawned upon me that there was no device there that could help me contact the outside world. 

Left without any other option, I foolishly screamed for help, letting my voice echo in the elevator. I hoped that maybe my plea would be able to penetrate the depth and reach someone’s ear.

“Help!” I shouted. “Please, help me, I’m trapped in here!”

With each yell, I prayed that someone would hear me and bring aid.

But how would they? If the display was to be believed, then I was two thousand floors underground. Who was to hear me that far down? I was too scared to think clearly, so I continued to scream.

In the end, all I was able to do was exhaust myself and further lower my spirit. Slowly I was starting to accept that I was trapped and alone in that elevator, with no way of contacting anyone for help. 

With dread, I glanced at the elevator display to see that I was then at the negative two thousand five hundredth floor. Looking on with a feeling of shock and defeat, I wondered how long would I continue to go down.

The descent seemed to endlessly continued, and all I could do was watch on, frozen in horror, as the numbers passed by in front of me. Inside I prayed, hoping for this nightmare to end. Yet it continued, ignoring my internal please.

I could feel my head spin as the minutes went on and I thought that any second I would fall and collapse from the overwhelming emotions raging within me. The fact that the elevator reached floors that would have been deep underground frightened me. I wanted it to stop.

Eventually, it did stop, but that did little to calm my nerves. 

Glancing at the elevator display, I looked on with horror to see that it said that I was in the negative three thousandth floor. If that was true, then I would have been deep within the Earth’s crust. Yet it didn’t seem I was. 

This far underground, it should have felt hotter. But it didn’t. Instead it felt the same as when I first entered the elevator. It was cool and the air was easy to breathe. I then wondered if any of the laws of nature still applied in that elevator.

Recovering from the initial fear that paralyzed me, I eventually turned my attention towards the doors. Instead of opening, they remained closed, leaving me trapped in there. However, remembering where I was, I wondered if it was better that it remained closed. 

If it opened, would I find some kind of room deep underground, or would tons of dirt and rock just enter the small space I was in and crush me to death? I was too scared to find out, so I made sure to not press anything on the control panel that would make it open.

But what was I to do? Was I supposed to just wait there? Wait for what? Will the elevator go back up, or will it suddenly go down again? How farther could it go if it did go down? Will something else happen or would I just remain trapped here until I die? Was this thing taking me to hell or has it brought me there already?

All of these questions raged in my head, yet there seemed to be no answer.

Desperate and confused, I then tried to find meaning to why I was there. I needed to know why I was chosen, I needed to know the reason I was unlucky enough to be here. I thought that maybe, if I find the answer to that, then I could also find the path to my escape.

I felt like there was an answer somewhere and I had to look for it. Yet I didn’t know where I could possibly find it. After all, what was there to see inside a plain elevator? 

Looking around, I did my best to look for any sign or hint, but there was nothing. All I could see was the stainless steel walls of the elevator and my frantic reflection. As the minutes went, I realized I would find nothing.

I was just simply trapped there, with no means to get out.

Feeling defeated, I then slumped on the wall and allowed myself to slide down till I was sitting on the floor. Then, as I felt a wave of sadness hit me, I buried my face in my hands and began to sob.

Never in my life had I expected something like this to happen to me. How could anyone have predicted such a cruel thing to happen to them? I didn’t know why I was here or who chose me to be the victim of this. All I knew was that I was trapped here, wherever this elevator ended up at.

For the next few moments I remained like that, frightened and feeling sorry for myself. However, eventually, my sorrow turned into frustration, as I felt that I was cheated on by life and left abandoned. Deep inside it felt like I won some kind of cosmic lottery and had been awarded with the prize of torment.

Feeling the frustration overcome me, I ended up clenching my fist before looking up at the ceiling. As I stared up, I wondered if there was someone out there looking down at me, as if the unknown being that had allowed me to be in this situation was watching me like I was a rat in an experiment. Thinking of that furthered the frustration in me, as I gazed with a foul expression. 

Unable to keep it in me any longer, I suddenly let out a curse, screaming to the top of my lungs. The frustration was too much, and it soon turned into full blown anger.

“Fuck!” I shouted, as I felt my blood boil. “Fuck, fuck, fuck!”

Allowing the anger get the best of me, I started to lose control and began throwing a fit in the elevator. My anger was mainly directed at the entity, or the trick of faith, that had allowed me to be trapped here. Out of all the people in the world, they chose me. I wanted them to know that I was displeased by their decision.

“Fuck you!” I yelled. “Fuck you! Let me out of here, I don’t deserve this! Bring me back up!”

Of course, I was met with no reply. No one responded or gave a hint that I was being heard. I was only met with silence, as the elevator remained unmoving. This only served to anger me even more, as I began stomping my feet on the floor, making the elevator shake as I increased the force.

“Let me out! Fucking bring me back!” I cried out.

Feeling my rage continue to rise, I soon began banging on the walls until all that could be heard was the sound of metal being struck in that confined space. At that moment I was blinded by emotions. I was scared and I was angry.

I no longer cared where the elevator could be. All caution was gone by that point. I no longer cared that it could be deep underground and that my actions could cause the doors to open and allow the earth to bury me. I no longer cared and simply allowed my emotions to act for me.

Banging on the walls, kicking the door, and shouting, I went wild in there. At one point, I began slamming my hands on the control panel, hitting multiple buttons as I did so. 

While most of the buttons I bumped did nothing to change my situation,  the door open button somehow did. The moment my fist pressed it, the elevator doors made a screeching sound, making me pause and step back.

Turning my attention to the door, I watched with surprise and apprehension as it slowly parted and opened. However, instead of a mountain of dirt and rock pouring in, what I saw confused me. As my anger subsided, I backed away and stared at what the door revealed.

Right there in front of me was a rough concrete wall with a small rectangular opening at its center. 

Relieved that I wasn’t going to be buried to death, but still cautious at the strange sight in front of me, I kept my distance and stayed at one corner of the elevator. Keeping my eyes intently at the small opening, I did my best to prepare myself for anything that might happen. I feared that at any moment something would come crawling out of that opening. 

I was terrified as I stood there. I knew that if something did come out, I wondered what I was supposed to do. I had nothing to fight with aside from my fist. If something did come out, I would be helpless against it.

However, as luck would have it, nothing emerged from the opening.

As the second turned into minutes, it soon became clear that nothing was going to happen. At least, nothing immediately.

Allowing myself to relax for a moment, I ended up lost in thought, as I wondered what to do with the new situation presented to me. As I studied the opening from a distance, I couldn’t help but entertain the idea that it may be the key to my escape. If anything else, it was at least a path that might lead to any other place than the elevator.

From my initial observations, it was obvious that I could squeeze myself into the opening and crawl into the tunnel it led to. It would have been a tight fit, and I never was a fan of small spaces, but in that desperate moment I was willing to do it.

But the question then was, where would it lead to.

I hoped that it would lead back to the surface, but after the distance I’ve travelled in the elevator, realized that, if it did, then it would be a long journey. I then wondered how I would be able to survive such a trip without any supplies.

After a short debate, I eventually convinced myself that the risk of a long journey without supplies had a better chance of success than staying in the elevator and dying from starvation and dehydration. Besides, I hoped for the possibility that the tunnel would lead me to another room, one that would perhaps provide me with either food and water or a quicker way back to the surface. After all that I had been through that day, such a possibility didn’t seem too far-fetched to me at the time. It was worth the risk.

Moving closer to the opening and trying to peer into it, I tried my best to see how far into the tunnel I could see. The light from the elevator only illuminated a few foot from the opening. After that it was pure pitch black darkness. 

Taking out my phone, I then opened its flashlight and tried to shine it into the tunnel. That helped light up a few more feet, but after that the void of darkness hid anything else farther.

Sighting, I took a deep breath and tried to gather all the courage within me. This was my only chance and I knew I had to take it.

Checking my phone, I saw that it still had more than fifty percent of power left. I hoped that it would be enough to provide until I reached another room or wherever this tunnel led to.

With some hesitation, I lifted myself into the entrance and, after a brief struggle to get my whole body in, began crawling forward. 

Since it was impossible to hold the phone pointing forward as I crawled inside the cramped tunnel, I decided to keep it held in one hand with the flashlight on. That way, I was able to somewhat illuminate the surrounding area and see what was directly in front of me. 

Despite this, I began to feel some panic as I moved through the cold concrete small passageway. Crawling inside a narrow tunnel wasn’t exactly something I was comfortable doing, especially when I didn’t know where exactly it would lead me. Looking forward and trying my best to see what was ahead, I could feel a sense of dread in my stomach at seeing nothing but darkness ahead of me. It seemed that having the flashlight on was no better than having it off, since I couldn't illuminate far enough to allow better navigation.

However, the moment I turned off the flashlight to try and save battery power, I quickly realized that the sensation of being in complete darkness while inside a confined space made things much more difficult. In the complete dark, I felt vulnerable; more vulnerable than I already was.

It’s hard to describe the uncomfortable feeling I felt in that moment of darkness, but it felt strange. For some reason, it seemed that the moment the light was gone, I sensed the feeling that someone was watching me. The thought of that brought a chill down my spine, as I desperately looked around in the dark. This sensation of being watched grew with every second passed and it eventually made me stop and turn on the flashlight again. 

Looking ahead of me, and, with some difficulty, looking behind me, I saw that there was no one there. Yet I was certain that I was being watched earlier. Bothered by this, I felt that urge to turn back. But I fought it and decided to continue. My only salvation was forward and I told myself that I couldn’t give up. With one last glance at my surroundings, I turned off the flashlight and moved forward.

The moment the darkness engulfed me, the feeling of being watched returned. However, I knew that I had to ignore it and do my best to fight the urge to turn on the light again. In the end I managed to convince myself that I had to conserve power for more important situations. So on I went, crawling in the narrow tunnel, in total darkness.

Following the tunnel, I took a couple of turns every now and then, as it led me deeper and deeper. Determined to reach its end, I kept on going, ignoring all thoughts of turning back.

After a while my body was getting tired. I had been crawling through that tunnel for more than half an hour by then and my muscles were starting to ache. There was nothing more I wanted than to be able to get up and stretch my whole body, but in the tight confines of that passageway, all I could do was was occasionally extend my arms and feet once in a while.

As it would turn out, I soon ended up finding a room at that point.

Initially, due to the constant darkness, I didn’t know that I was approaching an end to the tunnel. It was only when I put my hand forward and felt no concrete ahead of me did I realise that I finally encountered an opening that led to a larger space. Turning on the flashlight to better see what I found, I was surprised to see a fairly large room, big enough for me to stand in. But it wasn’t the size of the room that attracted my attention. Instead it was what the room was made off that drew my interest

The walls, the ceiling, and the floor were not made out of concrete. They weren’t made out of wood, steel or any common material either. Instead, they were made out of a fleshy like material, not too far off to human skin, with hair follicles protruding out of them. Seeing this unnerved me, but I couldn’t keep my eyes off of it.

Shocked and transfixed, I stared at each corner of the room and soon noticed it was expanding and contracting with each second, as if it was breathing. It made me wonder if the room was alive.

The sight of large walls of flesh breathing was strange and frightening. It wasn’t natural and shouldn't exist. The thought of such a thing existing made me wonder what else I would find in here. 

For a moment I contempted what to do. I wasn’t sure if this room was safe, especially since it was clearly alive. I didn’t want to go into it and explore. 

However, no sooner after thinking that, I noticed that there was something on the other side of the room. Shining my light there, I couldn’t help but feel excitement suddenly hit me as I realized that there was another opening there. 

This thus left me with no other option than to get on the room, quickly cross it, and get into that tunnel. 

Luckily for me the distance to the other opening was only around ten feet away. Not trusting the room, I decided that I was going to make a quick sprint to the other side and get in the other tunnel as fast as I could. There was no telling what the room did the moment I stepped into it, but I wasn’t willing to stick long enough to experience the consequences.

Due to the narrowness of the tunnel, I found it impossible to manoeuvre myself. Because of that I went into the room head first, with my arms shielding my head as I crawled out and fell down on the floor. 

As I landed, I felt my body hit a good number of the protruding hair follicles. This seemed to cause the room to react, I suddenly felt everything around me shake. Getting up, I looked around and saw that the walls were expanding and contracting faster than they were before.

At that moment I was tempted to pull myself back up and get back into the tunnel I had just left. But I managed to control myself long enough to realize that to go back would result in me being trapped there forever. There was no more place to go in that tunnel and I would just end up back in the elevator. My only salvation now was in the tunnel on the other side of the room.

Moving towards the other side, I felt the shaking around me intensify as I went. Allowing myself to look around the room, I saw with great horror that the walls and ceiling were expanding and closing on me. 

This encouraged me to go even faster and I soon reached the wall where the opening was. Placing my phone in first, so that it would provide me with light, I then lifted myself up and got in the tunnel.

Doing my best to glance behind me once I was inside, I managed to see the walls expand more and more until I could no longer see the room from the opening. All that was left was a wall of flesh that blocked the entrance. 

Letting out a deep sigh of relief, I allowed myself to relax for a second. Turning off the flashlight, I then lay flat on the cold concrete floor of the tunnel and got a few moments of rest. The adrenaline was now fading away from me and I felt more exhausted than I was earlier.

After a while, I decided that I had enough rest and willed my sore body to continue the monotonous task of crawling in the darkness.

Many minutes of uneventful crawling occurred before I encountered my next problem.

As I moved along the tunnel, I eventually bumped into a wall in front of me. At first I feared that I may have reached a dead end, and that all my travelling was for nothing. However, after feeling around, I soon noticed that there was no wall to my left and right.

Turning on my phone’s flashlight, I soon saw that I had actually found a split in the tunnel. Further inspection of the paths on both sides revealed that each path had multiple tunnel openings throughout their length. This thus left me with a decision to make. Which path should I take?

Deciding to rest as I contemplated what to do, I couldn’t help but let my thoughts wander as I layed there on the cold tunnel floor. I didn’t seem to be getting any closer to freedom and the further I went, the worse my situation seemed to become.

Dejected, but left with no other option, I decided to continue. I had gotten that far already, afterall. There was no use stopping now.

Choosing to take the path on the right, I moved forward until I got to the sixth tunnel opening. Then, hoping that I made the right decision, I pushed on, continuing my earlier routine of moving through the tunnel in the darkness.

While crawling, I slowly noticed that the tunnel was beginning to slope up. This sent a wave of excitement to me. The entire time I have been there, the tunnel always remained flat. But now it was going up and I hoped that it meant that I chose right and was finally going back to the surface. 

As I pushed forward, emboldened by the good news, I soon felt that the angle of the slope seemed to increase the farther I go. At first this didn’t worry me. But, as the angle kept on rising, I soon found it difficult to crawl. Eventually, it reached to the point that my movement was extremely slow, as I had to fight against gravity and prevent myself from sliding down.

To my great relief, I soon reached an area where the slope ended and the tunnel once more was perfectly flat. From there, I took a brief rest and allowed myself to breathe, before continuing. 

However, I was only able to move a couple of feet before stopping again. Looking ahead, I saw a faint light in the distance. Unsure what this could mean, I hesitated as I crawled forward.

Slowly making my way to the light, I soon saw the outline of an opening in front of me. Immediately I knew what it meant, there must have been another room. 

Remembering what I found in the last room, I was a bit hesitant at the idea of entering another one. It didn’t help that this room was emitting some light, something that was uncommon in these tunnels. I then wondered what could be causing that light and if it was a good thing.

Because of my fears, I moved towards the opening cautiously, before stopping and peering out to see what was in there. As I took my first glance, I felt my body freeze in fear.

There, sitting in the center of a large room, was a gigantic monster, with a large bulbous  body that had dozens of eyes facing every direction. Connected on the lower half of this monster were hundreds of tentacles, of various sizes, that moved and shifted constantly, as if they were restless. Looking at this terrible being and wondering what such a thing was doing here, I allowed my eyes to wander around the room to see what was illuminating it.

To my surprise, I saw hundreds of monitors lining the walls, each one depicting some kind of video. Briefly looking back to the monster, before turning my attention back to the monitors, I soon realized its multiple eyes were watching these monitors.

Focusing on one of the monitors, I showed footage of a man sitting behind a study table. Watching for a few seconds, I saw that the man was staring at his laptop and typing intently something on it. Confused, I then looked at another monitor to see that it showed a woman lying on bed, sleeping. Turning my gaze to another monitor I then saw footage of another man, as he sat and used his phone. As I glanced at each screen, all I could see were people doing random tasks, people living their lives, people who didn’t seem to know that they were being watched.

Laying there amazed and frightened, I couldn’t help but wonder if that thing was just there to spy on people. It would seem so and I wondered how many people it had eavesdropped on and for how long it had been doing this. The thought of something as horrendous as that monster watching me without my knowledge sent a shiver down my spine.

As I kept on studying the monitors, my eyes suddenly focused on one in particular. Looking on with horror, I saw myself displayed there. Lying on the tunnel, with a shocked expression on my face, I stared with with eyes to see the same look be reflected on the monitor. I didn’t know how it was possible, but it was there. 

Realizing that this meant that the monster would know where I was, I started crawling backwards and away from the opening. I knew I needed to get away before it noticed I was there. There was no telling what it would do if it saw me there close to its lair and I did not want to find out.

Unfortunately for me, before I could move far enough, one of the monster’s smaller tentacles entered the tunnel and moved towards me. Desperately, I tried to move back faster, but it was able to wrap around my arm and pull me out of the tunnel.

Screaming and feeling complete fear overtake me, I tried to resist. But I couldn’t. Its grip on me was too strong and I was lifted into the room and towards the many eyes of the huge creature. Hanging by the arm as I stared at it, my whole body shook in fright. I could see many of its eyes focus on me, with their gaze feeling like sharp daggers.

I didn’t know what it wanted from me or what its intentions were with me. At the time, I assumed that whatever they were, they couldn’t be good for me.

That’s why I was caught by surprise when the creature gently placed me down on the floor. Afraid and confused, I dared not to move and instead stood there and stared. 

Staring up at the monster, I watched as it lifted one of its larger tentacles. Fearing the worse, I closed my eyes, thinking that it was going to slam it against me. 

But nothing came.

Daring to open my eyes, I looked back up at the monster to see that it held the tentacle out, extending it towards the other side of the room. Following its tentacle, I soon noticed that it was pointing towards a tunnel opening on the other side of the room. Staring back at it, I saw a couple of its eyes look at me, before glancing towards the opening. 

Hesitantly, I moved towards where it was pointing, wondering if this was some sort of trick. I was afraid that it would suddenly attack me once my guard was down. But then I thought, why would it? It was clearly stronger than me and could easily crush me without any effort. It didn’t need me to lower my guard. 

So what did it mean? Was it playing with me, giving me a false sense of hope? Did it like to toy with its victims?

Unsure, and desperate to get out of there, I gave up on finding answers and soon started running towards the new tunnel opening. Moving as quickly as I could, I was soon standing by the entrance. Daring to look back, I turned my head towards the monster and saw that it remained where it was, although many of its eyes were staring at me. Then, to my shock, I saw teeth appear. 

Sharp, huge, and white, its teeth revealed themselves to me as it did its best to form a smile. Seeing this made my heart drop and I couldn’t tell if it was a friendly gesture or a threatening one. 

Shaken by what I saw, I quickly entered the tunnel and began crawling forward as far as I could.

For a moment I considered why the creature pointed me here. Was it a trap? Will this tunnel lead me to my death? I wasn’t sure, but I kept on going. During that time, anywhere seemed better than staying in that room with the monster.

I kept on going for a few more minutes, only taking short breaks to catch my breath, before moving on again. During these breaks, I would check my phone, trying to see if I was getting any signal. But there was none, so I just continued to crawl.

By that point I was completely exhausted, both physically and emotionally. This whole journey had taken its toll on me and all I wanted was for it to end.

Eventually, I began to see a light in the distance once more, this time brighter than the one earlier. Cautiously, I began moving forward, wondering what kind of room I would encounter now.

However, as I got closer, I felt a fresh breeze brush my face. This surprised me. Then, getting closer I heard the sound of birds chirping. 

Feeling excitement rush through me, I wondered if I really reached the end or if this was just some kind of cruel trick these tunnels were playing on me.

To my relief, it was the former. 

Reaching the opening, I was momentarily blinded by the brightness I saw outside. I had to close my eyes for a moment, before blinking a couple of times as my vision adjusted to the light. After spending so much time in the dark, seeing sunlight felt different. Despite this, I had a wide smile on my face, as I slid out of the tunnel and landed on soft grass. 

Grabbing the grass with my hands and burying my face on it, I cheered and laughed. I had escaped. Looking up, I saw the blue sky above me. 

For a moment I was confused. Last time I checked my phone, it told me that it was still supposed to be night. So why was the sun out? The hours pass by since I last checked it. It couldn’t be. At least, it didn’t feel like it.

Eventually ignoring this anomaly, I then got up and dusted myself off. Looking around to find out where I was, I suddenly frowned when I noticed that the tunnel I had exited from was gone. It seemed to have just disappeared, as I stood in the middle of an empty field alone.

Shaking my head, and giving up trying to understand the tunnels, I then tried to find out where I was. Looking at the distance, I was happy to see that my city was just a few miles away.

Smiling, I let out a smile of relief, knowing that I had escaped. As I walked away from that field and tried to figure out a way back home, I made a pledge to myself to never take the elevator again.
