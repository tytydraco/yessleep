This all started 2 weeks back, I was having a normal day, here's how it went,

I woke up at 3PM ready to start off my day feeling well rested and ready to go, I went to have my weekly shower, but on the way there got distracted by something I can only call terrifying, something I can barely put into words.

A completely unopened pack of mars bars on my kitchen table, now you see this might seem normal to some people, but to me this is unheard of, in my 23 years of living I can't even remember the last time I have left a pack of chocolate unopened for more than 15 minutes, and I knew I hadn't gone to the shop recently, leaving me thinking, 

who could of left this pack of mars bars on my kitchen table? I quickly sprinted towards this pack of mars bars and ripped it open as fast as I could, and within minutes every single bar had been consumed, I felt at peace once again, and went for my weekly shower feeling refreshed and full. The rest of the day was pretty normal and nothing out of the usual happened as far as I can remember,

The next day I woke up earlier than usual (2PM) feeling extremely hungry as usual, so I decided I'd go to the kitchen for a snack, I stubbed my toe on the way to the kitchen which was a shock in itself, but not as shocking as what I was about to see, to my absolute horror, there it was once again.. an unopened pack of mars bars on my kitchen table, 

Was this some sort of joke? Why would I leave these here? it was almost as if I was being taunted by someone? I live by myself so where could these be coming from? 

I walked towards the mars bars slowly, suspicious this time, and to my absolute shock,

 It wasn't just a pack of mars bars, it was a pack of XL mars bars, and that's not even the most shocking part, it was 8 bars instead of 4 this time,

I tore the wrappers off faster than I thought was humanely possible, swiftly eating one after the other at crazy speeds, then I walked towards the fridge looking for something to wash them down, as 8 XL mars bars in under 5 minutes is no joke, and when I opened that fridge door.. 

I saw 35 empty cans of beer scattered all around my fridge, leaving me with a shocking realization,

I had bought these mars bars the previous nights while I was highly intoxicated, and I just hadn't remembered to eat them afterwards, it really made me think about things for a while and well,

 I thought some other people may of had this experience too so I decided to post it here so this doesn't happen to anyone else

Be careful guys, you never know what can happen under the influence.
