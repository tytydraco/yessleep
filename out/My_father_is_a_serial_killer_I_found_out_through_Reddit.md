My name is James. I live in a pretty hillsy part of the UK, and this is the story of how I found out my dad was a serial killer.

It started in '92. The year I was born. My parents had a horrible divorce, and the end result was me living with my father, Clayton. It was made more horrible when my mother disappeared three years later. I can't remember her at all. I look a lot like my dad, and my mum was the opposite of my dad.

As far as childhoods go, mine was pretty good. I watched Disney every day, my father was a train conductor, and I attended small public schools where you were friends with basically everyone in the class. That's irrelevant, I guess. A more important fact is that seven people, over the course of my living there, went missing (well everyone knew they were >!dead!<). It was a tragedy. Three of them died on two seperate Halloweens. A little girl and two little boys; all three only five. The police were on the hunt for this villain, but they never found him, only chopped up meat photos emailed to them by non-traceable accounts. The other four people were adults, one homeless, the others working in boring jobs.

I moved out in 2012, but had regular calls with my father. Until recently, that is.

In the corner of a photo he sent me of his taxes, I could see a Reddit profile on his iPad. I laughed it off at the time but soon became curious of his account... beachaphile\_59. My dad is 59, so the name didn't surprise me, but today when I went to search his profile it did. He only has about 5 posts dating back to March 1st of this year.

**I crashed my car into my ex-wife**

This might violate your Terms of Service but this is a confession from me I need to get off my chest.

Thirty years ago, my wife and I had a messy divorce when our son was only a month or two old.  I was really bitter about the whole thing.  My wife was a... well think of the worst word you can.  A couple years later she was out on a road since her car broke down.  It was stormy and I was drunk.  I crashed into her.  I didn't know if she was hurt or not but I took her into my car.

The reason why the post hadn't been taken down was because it had basically no audience engagement. One upvote and one comment with three upvotes, which simply read:

"op wtf is wrong with you what happened next"

The next post was in r/AskReddit

**Is hiding dead people a crime?**

\-

It had 14 upvotes, but there was a comment on it with twenty-three upvotes saying:

"Why do you need to know?"

My father defending himself saying: "book i was reading".

There were six other comments, four repeating the "why" question and one said, "Well idk why you need to know but there is a crime for 'preventing lawful burial'. Hope that helps!"

The other one linked a Quora post.

My father's next two posts were innocent ones about cooking, neither of which got more than two upvotes, and zero comments. My father's final post was the most chilling. In a subreddit that he just made. *19 days ago.*
