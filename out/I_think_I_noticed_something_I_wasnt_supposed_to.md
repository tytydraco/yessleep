I didn’t believe in anything supernatural until the night the streetlights bent.

It was around 2:30 a.m. I was driving home from a late shift, cutting through an industrial stretch I’d used a hundred times. Same abandoned warehouses. Same flickering sodium lamps. Same dead silence broken only by my engine and the buzzing in my ears from exhaustion.

Then the road ahead of me rippled.

Not like heat distortion. More like the air forgot how to hold its shape.

The yellow lane lines curved inward, bowing toward a single point in the road as if something heavy was pressing down on reality itself. My headlights reflected back wrong, stretched and fractured, like they were bouncing off broken glass that wasn’t there.

I slammed the brakes.

The engine cut. The radio went dead. Even the cicadas stopped.

That’s when the light flickered.

Once. Twice. Three times.

Each flash was brighter than the last, bleaching the world white for a fraction of a second. On the third, the air split. Not opened. Split. Like a seam tearing in fabric that didn’t want to be torn.

Something came out.

At first I thought it was a kid. Skinny. Short. Hoodie hanging off him like it didn’t belong to a body that small. He stumbled forward, boots scraping asphalt, like he’d been thrown out of somewhere at speed and barely remembered how gravity worked.

Then he looked up.

His eyes were wrong.

They weren’t glowing constantly. They weren’t supernatural in a flashy way. They were just… on. Bright, flat red, like warning lights that didn’t blink. The rest of his face looked young. Too young. Barely out of high school, if that. No scars. No beard. No reason for the dread that punched through my chest the moment our eyes met.

He tilted his head, slowly, like he was listening to something I couldn’t hear.

“Wow,” he said quietly. Calm. Almost bored. “You guys really don’t notice when it breaks, do you?”

My door was unlocked. I don’t remember unlocking it.

I remember trying to speak and realizing my throat wouldn’t cooperate. I remember the pressure in my ears, like descending too fast in an airplane. I remember the streetlight behind him folding inward, the metal pole bending toward him without touching, like it wanted to kneel.

He stepped closer.

Each step made the air shudder. Not shake. Shudder. Like a flinch.

“I’m not supposed to stay long,” he said, glancing around. His eyes flicked past me, through my car, into places I don’t think eyes are meant to go. When he looked back at me, his mouth twitched. “But you saw it. And now you’re looking at me like you’re gonna remember.”

I swear I smelled ozone. Cold metal. Static.

“I don’t like witnesses,” he added. Not angry. Not threatening. Just factual. Like explaining weather.

I felt pressure on my chest, like invisible hands pinning me to the seat. My heartbeat sounded too loud, like it was echoing in someone else’s skull.

Then, suddenly, he paused.

He squinted. Leaned closer. His eyes flicked over my body, not leering, not curious. Clinical. As if he was reading data off a screen only he could see.

“Huh,” he murmured. “You’re gonna die anyway.”

That should’ve been comforting. It wasn’t.

The red in his eyes shut off instantly. One moment they were burning holes through me, the next they were just… brown. Normal. Human.

He stepped back.

“Forget this part,” he said, tapping the side of his head like he was reminding himself of something. “If you remember too much, you spiral. And I’m not cleaning that up.”

The air behind him started to ripple again. That same glassy distortion. Street signs bent toward it. Dust lifted off the ground and froze in a perfect ring.

I blinked.

When I opened my eyes, my engine was running. The radio was playing softly. The streetlights were straight.

I was parked crooked across both lanes, hands locked on the wheel so tight my fingers were numb.

I drove home. I didn’t sleep.

For weeks after, I told myself it was stress. Hallucination. A micro-nap. Anything but what it felt like. And I kept my mouth shut. 

That part was easy. People don’t actually want to hear things that don’t fit anywhere. You can see it in their eyes the moment you start describing details that don’t have a box. The way the air moved wrong. The way the lights bent instead of flickered. The way his voice didn’t echo like it should have.

So I didn’t tell anyone.

I went back to work. I slept with the TV on. I avoided that road and added twelve minutes to my commute without thinking about it. I told myself that whatever happened had stayed there, stitched back into the night like it never existed.

That worked.

Until the dreams started syncing.

At first they were normal stress dreams. Falling. Missing turns. Brakes that wouldn’t respond. But then the same detail kept repeating. No matter what the dream was about, the environment would pause for a fraction of a second. Not freeze. Pause. Like a dropped frame.

In those moments, I could feel him.

Not see. Feel.

Like pressure behind my eyes, the way you feel when someone stands too close behind you in an elevator. The dream would resume immediately after, but my heart would be racing, and I’d wake up with that same faint ringing in my left ear.

Then I started noticing it while awake.

Streetlights humming slightly out of tune with each other. Reflections in windows lagging a beat behind my movements. A dog on my block that would sit and stare at empty air, whining softly, tail tucked, every night at exactly 2:17 a.m.

The worst part was that nothing ever escalated all at once. It never gives you the satisfaction of a single “this is it” moment. Just a slow accumulation of wrongness.

The first time I lost time, it was only about thirty seconds.

I was brushing my teeth, staring at myself in the mirror, when I noticed my reflection blink out of sync. Not delayed. Early. My eyes closed in the mirror before I felt my eyelids move.

There was a soft click sound, like static snapping.

Then I was standing in the same spot, toothbrush still in my mouth, foam dripping onto my shirt, with my phone buzzing on the counter. Thirty-two seconds had passed.

No dizziness. No confusion. Just the overwhelming sense that something had checked on me.

That’s when I started writing things down.

Times. Sounds. Patterns. Anything that felt even slightly off. I filled an entire notebook in two weeks. The entries got shorter over time because the events didn’t change. They just repeated with increasing precision.

Always late at night.

Always brief.

Always followed by that high-frequency tone, like a TV left on in another room.

And always, always the same feeling.

Being evaluated.

The second encounter wasn’t visual at first.

I was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, when the ringing got louder than it ever had before. Not painful. Focused. Like someone turning a dial.

The air in my bedroom thickened.

That’s the only word that fits. Thickened. Breathing felt slower, like oxygen had weight. My phone slid a few centimeters across the nightstand on its own and stopped, perfectly aligned with the edge.

Then he spoke.

“Okay,” he said casually, from everywhere. “You’re remembering more than I expected.”

I couldn’t move. I didn’t feel restrained. I just couldn’t convince my body that movement was still allowed.

“I fixed most of it,” he continued, sounding mildly annoyed. “But you keep catching the seams. That’s… inconvenient.”

I didn’t see him yet. I just knew exactly where he was standing.

Right behind me.

“I told you to forget this part,” he said.

My reflection appeared in the dark TV screen across the room before I felt him step into view. Hoodie. Same boots. Same too-small frame that somehow bent the room around it.

His eyes weren’t glowing.

That scared me more.

“You’re not special,” he said, leaning against the wall like this was a routine follow-up appointment. “You’re not chosen. You’re not important. You just happened to look at the wrong second.”

He tilted his head, listening again. That same habit.

“…Yeah,” he muttered. “Thought so.”

Then he looked directly at me.

“Here’s the problem,” he said. “I can erase memories. I can fold time around people. I can undo damage so clean you’d swear it never happened.”

My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might give me away.

“But once someone notices the structure,” he continued, tapping his temple, “their brain starts doing the work for me. You start predicting the glitches. Filling in the blanks.”

He smiled faintly. Not cruel. Not kind. Just tired.

“And eventually, that attracts attention.”

The room flickered.

For a split second, I saw layers. Walls thinned into outlines. My own body felt wrong, like I was aware of my heartbeat from the inside out.

Then it stopped.

He straightened.

“I’m going to fix this one more time,” he said. “After that, if you keep pushing… I won’t bother.”

I tried to speak. I don’t know what I would’ve said.

He stepped back into the distortion that had already started forming behind him. The air folded. Light curved. The sound dipped like someone muted reality for half a breath.

Before he disappeared, he glanced back.

“Oh,” he added. “If you ever hear the ringing get quiet instead of loud—don’t look for me.”

Then he was gone.

I woke up the next morning with my notebook blank. Every page. Every timestamp. Gone.

I found his name by accident.

Not online. Not in some dark forum or leaked file. It was written in the margin of a report that wasn’t supposed to exist anymore.

Three months after the silence started, I was back at work on a late shift, helping archive old infrastructure surveys. The kind of stuff nobody looks at twice. Microfracture reports. Stress tests. Environmental anomalies that get blamed on equipment failure and quietly buried.

One file refused to stay gone.

Every time I deleted it, it reappeared in the same folder the next morning. Same timestamp. Same checksum. Like the system itself thought it belonged there.

The title was simple:

INCIDENT SUMMARY: LAVOIX

I didn’t open it right away. That felt important somehow. Like the delay mattered.

When I finally did, the first thing I noticed was that the formatting was wrong. Paragraphs didn’t line up cleanly. Margins drifted slightly inward the longer you read, like the document was collapsing under its own weight.

There was no author listed.

The opening paragraph didn’t describe a person. It described a problem.

Subject designation “Lavoix” is not a codename. It is self-assigned.

The subject exhibits complete disregard for continuity, causality, and localized physical limits.

Attempts to classify the subject as human, post-human, or external entity are inconclusive.

I scrolled.

Every incident matched the same pattern I’d experienced. Localized distortions. Light behaving incorrectly. Witnesses reporting ringing, vertigo, time skips. Animals reacting before events occurred.

The reports spanned decades.

Different cities. Different countries. Different eras.

Same description.

A small figure. Male-presenting. Young appearance. Casual demeanor. Witnesses consistently noted a lack of urgency, as if the subject was bored by reality.

One paragraph was highlighted in red.

Subject does not “travel” in conventional terms.

Movement occurs via forced violation of the local speed limit of the universe, resulting in involuntary displacement into a higher temporal structure.

Subject refers to this structure informally as “the tunnel.”

I felt cold reading that.

Another section listed abilities. Not as speculation. As observation.

He can stop time without freezing it.

He can move faster than cause and effect.

He can see through matter as if surfaces are suggestions, not barriers.

He can cut without burning.

He can erase events without leaving paradoxes behind.

There was a note next to that last one.

Memory alteration is not primary. Structural overwrite is preferred.

The world forgets first. People follow.

That’s when I started shaking.

The final pages were transcripts. Partial. Fragmented. Most were labeled UNRECOVERABLE.

One wasn’t.

It was a recording summary from a researcher who had interacted with him directly.

He did not threaten us.

He did not posture.

He explained, very calmly, that we were mistaking permanence for importance.

When asked what would happen if he were stopped, he laughed.

When asked if he could be killed, he paused for the first time.

He said: “In the wrong place? Yeah. In yours? No.”

The last line of the document wasn’t technical.

It wasn’t even professional.

It was handwritten, scanned in crookedly, like someone added it later and didn’t care if it fit.

If you are reading this and remember him clearly, he has already decided what to do with you.

That night, the ringing came back.

Not loud. Focused.

Precise.

The air in my apartment flattened. Shadows leaned the wrong way. My phone slid across the table and stopped, perfectly aligned, just like before.

He didn’t bother hiding this time.

He stepped out of the distortion already looking at me.

“Yeah,” he said, glancing at the open file on my laptop. “I was wondering when you’d trip over that.”

His eyes were glowing now. Not flaring. Just on.

“You weren’t supposed to find the name,” he added. “But you’re good at patterns. I’ll give you that.”

I couldn’t speak. I didn’t need to.

He sat on the edge of my table like it was normal, like gravity still worked the same way around him.

“Lavoix,” he said, tapping his chest. “That’s me. Not a title. Not a myth. Just what I go by.”

He looked genuinely curious when he asked the next question.

“So,” he said. “You want the short version… or the one that keeps you awake forever?”

The ringing stopped completely.

And I understood, with absolute certainty, that whatever answer I gave wouldn’t change the outcome.

Because he wasn’t asking for permission.

He was deciding how much I was allowed to understand before the world forgot me too.

He didn’t wait for my answer.

Lavoix stood, the air around him tightening like reality bracing itself.

“You already know enough,” he said, almost gently. “More than most. More than is healthy.”

I felt that pressure again, not on my body, but around my thoughts. Like fingers hovering over a light switch inside my skull.

“I don’t kill people for knowing,” he continued. “That’s messy. And boring. I just… realign them.”

His eyes dimmed. Not off. Just distant.

“You’ll forget the details first. Then the fear. Then the reason you ever checked twice when something felt wrong.” He paused. “You’ll still be you. Just smoother. Less sharp at the edges.”

I tried to fight it. I really did. I focused on his face, his name, the word tunnel, the way the lights bent—

The ringing softened into nothing.

The room exhaled.

When I came to, it was morning. My laptop was closed. No strange files. No empty notebook. No sense of dread.

Most days now, life feels normal.

Too normal.

But sometimes, late at night, I’ll notice a streetlight humming slightly off-key. Or a reflection blinking a fraction too early. And for just a heartbeat, I feel that familiar pressure, like the world checking itself.

Making sure everything is still in place.

If you ever notice the ringing stop instead of start, don’t panic.

Just don’t look for him.

Because if you’re aware enough to wonder who Lavoix is, he already knows where you are.

And he hates loose ends.
