All my life, ignorance has plagued me. 

Others’ ignorance. My ignorance. Humanity’s collective empty caverns that we call knowledge. To call the little we understand ‘knowledge’ is the peak of human arrogance. 

My hatred for what I did not know began as a child, being repeatedly told I was wrong. Never enough. For mother, for father. Teachers, friends, even animals found ways to outsmart me. No matter how I improved there'd always be some mistake that crept into everything I touched. 

It infuriated me. A rage constantly bubbling at the surface that I had to choke back or I'd risk being called mad. 

I sought to be the smartest in the room. An interest in physics led to an obsession with quantum theory, if I could crack those mysteries then maybe I could know it all. 

Though colleagues would still discover my mistakes. Ways in which I was so embarrassingly wrong. Yet too I’d watch them fumble around pretending to have discovered something of significance in this vast uncaring universe. That’s when I realised, the smartest in the room, in this entire planet, will never be smart enough. 

The intelligence we prescribe to homosapiens is the result of a pathetic comparison to the creatures that surround us. Do we praise the pig for being smarter than an ant? We thrash about much the same as a dog in heat, motivated only by desires yet feel we are special.

Our minds are too frail to know the secrets of this universe. I needed more than these biological limitations.

I needed to be a god.

So a new experiment began. A quantum computer designed to provide humanity untold knowledge. A machine that could process and understand far more than humanity could alone. 

That’s what I advertised to my superiors. 

To access this machine someone must be plugged into it so one’s atoms become entwined with its mechanisms. Now that it has been completed, I plan to be the guinea pig. Before anyone can get in my way, my mind will become one with the machine. With my new found knowledge, not only will my ignorance be no more, I shall use its knowledge to become a god.

And I will do it before anyone can stop me. 

Tomorrow I will remove my feeble shell and ascend. No longer will I be trapped in this prison I call a mind. Soon, I will be everything. 

I write this so you might understand who your new god is. 

Once I knew what my objective was, my interests went beyond science. Theology consumed any remaining crevasse in the grooves of my brain. Any space not occupied by plans for my creation were to hold religious teachings. 

There are many beliefs humanity has held. There was only one I was interested in.

To be a god, one must understand what that would entail. Most religions and cults have some god-like figure, though few have the omnipotent being I desired to make reality. 

I gained important knowledge from Buddhists, Hindus, even religions of old like those held  by the Aztecs. Though I always knew they’d not give me what I desired. 

The Abrahamic religions were where I spent most of my studies.

No where is the ignorance of man on full display than with these three. Slaughtering each other for centuries despite sharing the same origins. Even within each, they’d fracture and turn on their own. Whatever god they worshipped they were far from. 

They were not my example to follow however, it was instead the infinite being we shared interest in.

Omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent and all loving. The qualities of a supposed god. After much deliberation I found I agreed with this assessment, though the last seemed wholly unnecessary. 

A loving god? How bizarre. Why would a being so powerful feel anything at all? This world did not reflect a father guiding children. All existence just is. Cold and unfeeling. A god would not change this, only provide an explanation.

It did provide an interesting decision for me though. Once I become a god, what shall I do with my power? Will I be benevolent or cruel? Perhaps a better question once it has occurred. For now I am content with what I know I’ll achieve.

At first, only liberal establishments would speak to me. Those of a more conservative background did not wish to give me the time of day. Others felt the need to hurl insults at me and my colleagues' skin colour rather than our ambitions. 

I pushed against this. Religious research was a personal goal of mine. The colleagues these letters sought to insult were not even part of my interviews. In their ignorance these church leaders simply presumed due to their own faulty investigations.

I needed these groups as much as I needed the liberal ones however. For many I had to resort to going undercover as a possible new follower. My interviews were changed to peculiar hypotheticals, with details rearranged to avoid arousing suspicion.

The religious leaders often scoffed at our plans. Each would be unoriginal in their objection; man nor their creations could ever reach the status of their lord. Many protested our experiment. If we were not careful, we might feel their god’s wrath. Or so they claimed. 

I wondered if they knew my plan in full would their enraged faces change to a new shade of red.

The more I spoke to these holy men and women, the more my hatred grew for man. The antithesis of myself, when these preachers discovered how little they knew they sought faith instead of solutions. Weak minded fools they are, finding contentment in nothing.

I grew bored of the same mundane reactions. Mosque, church, chapel or synagogue, it was all the same. Once I had gathered all I felt I needed, I decided to focus on the machine itself. 

We’ve been working for over three decades. Three, long, excruciating decades. 

Our funding has been supplied by a nation that shall remain undisclosed. If I were to somehow fail my attempt tomorrow, I fear their wrath more than a god’s. So, I will remain vague when addressing our benefactors.

If you sell anything as a useful weapon for conquest it is easy to win over a military. While Oppenheimer was still condemning his creation, leaders around the world were already seeking something more powerful. 

That’s what we claimed to provide.

Knowing everything is a very tempting offer. One they could not resist.

Many administrations have passed, providing us with different levels of budget. Though even those who were not fond of our plan still could not resist knowledge’s seduction.

A lot of our budget has been dedicated to mass graves. As I mentioned prior, the main mode of using our machine is via ‘plugging’ into it. That involves scanning one’s brain and molding their molecular structure to fit it.

To give a very basic idea of what’s going on, atoms are often taught to function as waves or individual particles. Quantum mechanics changed that, with us now understanding they work both ways. 

Our quantum computer records the wave-particle duality of every single atom that makes up the brain. From there it ‘clones’ these atoms within its system. Cloning in quantum mechanics is more like a transfer of information so it’s less fancier than it sounds. The computer entangles the computer's cloned quantum brain with the test subjects’ brain, transferring the information between both. This creates a new form of existence for the individual allowing access to the information gathered in the twin computer.

The main problem we encountered was the cloning phase. The technology needed for our computer has taken a while to catch up with our plans. Afterall, I have only explained the process of accessing the computer, never mind its sister computer attempting to gather all knowledge known to man. 

As a result, what often occurs is both connected computers overheat before proceeding to implode in balls of smoke. With the atomic structures still entangled, so too did the patients’ brains. 

Breaking someone down at an atomic level is a horrific sight. It is similar to that of the effects of radiation. Only instead of the body's cells breaking down over time, it happens in an instant. 

Subject #304 was a stand out. Many subjects' brains just exploded into a bloody mess. A less than pleasant sight but one you grow accustomed to over time. 

Subject #304 however suffered a worse fate. 

For a moment, we thought we had been successful. I rushed into the room, where Subject #304 was laying strapped to a gurney, unconscious. By this stage, brain matter was usually already splattered over the roof. Hence our wrongful assumption this had been a major breakthrough. 

The room consisted of rows and rows of dark cuboids that reached the ceiling, the hum of their fans a constant white noise in the background. Subject #304 was located at the back of the room, his vitals still normal. 

At this stage it was key the patient remained unconscious. Not only would they experience incredible pain and disorientation, if we truly had been successful they could take over the computer and then who knows what would happen next. 

My colleagues entered not long after me, as I began vigorously writing all I could on my clipboard. I almost tore a hole right through the page without realising. So close to another mistake.

It was then I felt a tap on my shoulder. I turned to find, who we shall call Ahmed, standing behind me scanning his eyes across the room. 

“What’s the matter Ahmed?”

“D-did you hear that?” 

Before I could respond, I discovered what he’d been referring too.

THUD THUD THUD.

Everyone stood still. At first, I thought the fans were breaking down and we’d have to duck for cover before the patient imploded. 

Instead there was a muffled scream. 

I ran over to one of the computers and put my ear to it. 

THUD THUD THUD.

I jumped back. It’s inside the computer?

THUD THUD THUD.

Now the cuboid behind me made the same sound. Then another, and another, and another. 

THUD THUD THUD. 

I tried my best to assess the potential problem without having to dissect any of the cubes. There was something strange going on. What affirmed this was the unnatural movement on the subject's face.

“Ahmed, check the subject's eyes!”

I didn’t need to give the command as he was already on it. While he peeled open the subject’s eyes, Dr. Alexi shone a torch on his pupils. They shrugged as they found nothing and let them shut.

That was until they saw his eyes shift under his eyelids. 

They were moving around rapidly, as if searching for a way out. A way out of what? 

Every time we opened the lids the movement would stop. Then it would start up again as soon as they were re-opened, faster and faster. 

The way they moved was erratic, I knew if we could see his iris we wouldn’t be able to keep track of it. We knew something had gone wrong but we couldn’t tell what yet never mind how. That’s when I noticed something about the way they rolled about.

The next time we opened them, I told them to wait. With one finger, I pushed the eyeball. I moved it slowly, imagining the mouse on my computer to ignore my squeamishness. I scrolled it back. With no resistance, the eyeball rolled all the way back into his head, revealing they were no longer attached to the sockets. 

I whipped out my finger reflexively, the eyeball coming with it and plopping onto the floor. 

It had been moving so fast, it pulled itself out of the socket. 

THUD THUD THUD.

Someone’s voice followed, screeching something in a language I didn’t understand. It grew louder and louder as out of synch banging came from all the computers. 

The screams grew louder and louder, I did not know the words but I knew they were pleas for help. The voice of the subject reverberated off the walls, echoing in my mind as they grew pitch and volume. The fans of the computers whirred in a creeping crescendo with each THUD.

“Do either of you understand what he’s saying?!”

“He’s begging for help… he… he..”, Alexi began, covering his mouth, “He’s begging for his mother, he wants to go home, i-it’s too much. He feels everything, he knows everything he… he knows…” 

Tears began to fall down each of his cheeks as he tried his best to choke them back. Ahmed turned to him desperate, trying to shake the answer out of him. 

“He knows what?! Is he taking over the computer?!” Ahmed cried out.

“He…he knows my daughter’s name, she… My wife miscarried… how, how does he know, I-I never told anyone, h-how…” 

The haunting pleas continued, not only from the computers but everywhere. The walls, the ceiling, the hallway, the heart monitor, from Ahmed, from Alexi and from me. But we did not speak, we just knew somehow. 

How is he doing that? How? What? What's happening?

I tried my best to block it out, but covering my ears had no effect. I could see the subjects’ body convulsing and seizing. Each jerk was so violent he lifted off the table, breaking bones and tearing flesh from the sheer force against the leather straps holding him down. 

His skin began to melt and burn, his face melting away like a wax figure. It became acidic, burning away the bone with it, as what was once his vessel for life became nothing more than a puddle of mush. Though somehow the gurney remained undamaged.

I could see the subject reach his hand towards me, his jagged bones poking between the holes in his flesh. His red and charred skin dripped away as he pointed at me. The finger then crumbled away like a castle made of sand. 

Pops and cracks came from the computers, sparks flying as the fans spun out of control. Smoke followed, consuming the room. 

The screams ceased as everything shut down. 

Then it was over. 

Our superiors were not happy with the mess we left them. They were pleased there was no body to attend to this time however. 

Not that disposal was ever an issue. Our subjects were always unwilling. They would be snatched from the streets. Run aways and addicts. Some prisoners of war that no longer served a purpose. No families would require explanations as each patient had no loved ones to speak of. 

Their sacrifices were worth it for godhood. 

I wondered why in his last moments, that man pointed at me. As if he somehow knew his fate was my fault. 

The machine has since been perfected. Our last test was so successful the subject managed to gain control of the computer and began re-coding it to belong to him. We manually shut the computers down which did the job, we shot his body in the head a few times for good luck as well. 

We were lucky we caught him when we did, otherwise our new god would've been some nobody. 

Subject #304 and that incident did raise questions amongst our superiors. They began to realise the risks of having a singular person have access to so much information. 

They are fools for only questioning it now. It would've been a foil to my plan, since they now say if we want continued funding we must change that mechanism. As of tomorrow however, they'll already be too late. 

I decided to venture to a church one last time this morning. There was a priest there I had emailed when I was still researching. I thought following through on the plans of the past would serve as entertainment before I would prove them wrong. 

I wonder when this is all over if they'll worship me. 

I will grant him privacy and call him Peter. This Priest Peter was unassuming, a normal man if it weren't for the collar that choked his neck. 

For some reason he had insisted he should show me the architecture of the building. He mentioned some drivel about how appreciating the accomplishments of man can be good as long as we recognise God could do better.

I went along with his tour. He was easy to listen to, though I blanked out his words. The glass stained windows retold the fable he believed in, he showed them with pride despite their inadequacy. 

What use is a pretty window to me now? It almost made me laugh how proud he was of his predecessors’ petty accomplishments. 

Once his lecture concluded, we sat down on the pews so I could ask him what I sought out. I began with the usual questions of what they believed god to be, and why does he believe. 

Hearing the usual answers bored me. So, I decided to skip to the final question. 

‘Do you think our computer will help us become gods?’ 

He chuckled a little, an act of defiance at the mere notion. 

“Your problem is, you wish to become a god instead of the God.” He began. 

The usual answer. Always said in different ways but the same hollow substance. I couldn't even take joy from the trivial answers anymore, perhaps this was a waste of time. 

“Is that so Father? Why is that?” I was already putting my notes away before he even continued. 

“Well, I don't think you understand who God is. You seem to understand knowledge is a requirement of godhood but don't understand what it means to know everything. If you did, you wouldn't want that knowledge.” 

That answer was… different. I didn't anticipate anything special, I did not want to get my hopes up, but I was curious what he meant and urged him to continue.

“It's simple really. Everyone gets so bogged down by our own suffering. Why would God abandon us to feel pain? Why must we suffer so much? A very understandable problem. But what I find more interesting, is to be a god not to suffer?” 

He spoke with a child-like wonder more than conviction. I couldn't tell where he was going with this, so I brought back my notes. This would at least be engaging.

“Do elaborate Father Peter.” 

“Think of it this way. As you have correctly presumed, knowledge is key to be a god. But the price of that knowledge is misery. God does not just know the answers to the questions you have. He knows it all. Every thought. Every desire. Every dream, every vendetta. Everything that ever is and ever was. And knowing everything means you know how to solve everything. I'm sure you've witnessed someone aimlessly try to solve a problem you know the answer to. Imagine that's your entire existence. You create a world for these little creatures to figure out and instead they waste time with grudges and feuds and unrivaled stupidity.” 

“Then why not just tell us what to do or make it so we know the answers too?”

“Because then what's the point! Make a bunch of mini yous? Knowing everything makes existence pointless, there's no point interacting with a physical world if you know all the answers. Even if he provided one man all the answers, then they'd be as miserable as he is!” 

I couldn't help but scoff. “I'm not so sure that man would be miserable.” 

“That's our problem right there. We reject God but so desperately want to be him. It's not knowledge we seek its power. The power to know everything so we can always be right. An unmatched ego. Yet if we knew everything we'd regret it, because to know everything is to feel everything. The more suffering we understand of those around us, the more we can't handle it.” 

Peter turned to me, making sure to make eye contact to gauge my reaction. 

“Why do you want answers boy?” 

“So, I can be right. I don't like making mistakes.” 

“Then if you follow through with your plans, you will never be right again. You will only be.”

The way he phrased it caught me off guard, he spoke as if he knew of my goals. 

He arose to his feet and pointed at a statue centre stage of what I presumed was the mother Mary. 

He continued, “God came in human form to suffer alongside us to show he understood, to show pain is not unique to us. Knowing everything will never dispel our woes, just make us more aware of others. If we want to be happy from there, all we must do is listen. Certainty is the enemy of man my friend, don't be tricked into thinking it's worth reaching for.” 

By that last part I lost interest again and my notes were tucked away. I knew I had already walked into a, likely planned, sermon. I thanked him for his time and told him it'd been a productive discussion, but it was far from it. 

What malarkey! Knowledge is pain, how could someone who claims to not be certain of anything claim such a thing? 

The religious men were as delusional as the non-religious. Humanity is not doomed for seeking certainty, it is how we've progressed forward! 

I will no longer be held back from that knowledge. The fears of priests do not deter me. Perhaps he is too much of a coward to become a god but I am not. 

I doubt there is a god, but if there is he will encounter competition soon.

I don't know what I will do with my new power, but I can not wait to feel it. I will finally know everything. 

Tomorrow I will plug myself in. If I succeed, you will know.
