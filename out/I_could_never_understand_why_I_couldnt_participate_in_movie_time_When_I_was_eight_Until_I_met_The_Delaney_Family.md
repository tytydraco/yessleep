When I was eight years old, I saw something I shouldn’t have.

I didn’t mean to. I mean, I was just a curious kid. I couldn’t understand why my elementary school insisted on hosting “video time” for a select group of students every Friday afternoon. 

It was the whole fifth-grade class, as well as my class, all of them except me. I didn’t think much of it at first. I thought it was because these kids were well-behaved and were being given a treat, but Elliot Marsh definitely was not well-behaved. He couldn’t sit still throughout class and regularly pulled on girls’ pigtails until they cried. So, imagine my confusion when he too was allowed to participate in this super-exclusive video time.

Elliot spat in other kids' faces and talked back to the teachers, while I stayed quiet and only spoke up when I was asked a question. It didn’t make sense to me why even the worst kid in the class was dragging his feet into video time, while I was left out. I didn’t like the look of the room, either. 

It wasn’t a classroom, just a small room with red lights and a matching carpeted floor. I had only managed to see a glimpse of it, and I already didn’t like the idea of sitting on the carpet, drowned in harsh red light. I started forward to get a closer look when a warm hand wrapped around my arm, and gently pulled me back. “Freida, aren’t you supposed to be in recess?” 

Mrs. Parish wasn’t easily fooled, when I told the white lie that I too was supposed to be in there. Naturally, she didn’t believe me, escorting me outside to play with the stragglers, which were just four kids I didn’t even know. When I spotted my two younger brothers following the long line of kids into the video room, I started to get angry and frustrated. Why was I so different? 

I wasn’t that badly behaved, right? Sure, I messed up my spelling sometimes, and I still couldn’t do math very well, but I wasn’t a bad kid. I deserved video time too just like my brothers, and they were one year younger than me. I thought older kids got things first.  I admit, I was jealous. 

I didn’t care that the rest of us were allowed a second recess, I wanted to know why the other kids were allowed to watch movies and I wasn’t. I even asked them, cornering my friends when they walked into class the next day with their usual smiles. I asked them what the big secret about video time was, but they just smiled and pretended to zip their lips. That made me more jealous. Mom didn’t help. 

I said  I wanted her to talk to the teacher and let me join in, but she just shook her head with a sigh. “Some things aren’t for you, Freida.” That hurt. 

I mean, she was kind of right. I couldn’t have everything I wanted—and I knew that. But there was something about being the only kid in my class who was not allowed to watch movies, which made me feel like I wasn’t good enough. I remember Mom’s words cutting into me like a knife. I had always admired my mother for being honest and telling the truth. When I was five years old, I happened to find a photograph in our attic of a baby which looked like me, cradled in another woman’s arms. She didn’t try and keep anything from me or hide behind a façade. It’s not like she could try, anyway. I was adopted, obviously.

Anyone could see that.

I did not have my mother’s blood-red hair and pale skin, which both of my brothers had inherited. Instead, I was a mousy brunette. Mom reassured me that I could always ask about my real mother, and when I was older, I could write her letters and even visit her if I wanted to. This made me feel safe and loved. I could have two moms, and both of them loved me. However, I didn’t like that she sided with the school and refused to talk to my teacher about allowing me to join in video time. 

She kept asking me the same question, and I realized I couldn’t answer it. 

Why did I want to join in so badly? I thought about it and concluded that I didn’t like being left out. It’s not like the other kids boasted about video time. Some of them even forgot it existed. I asked them if they had fun watching movies, and they blinked at me, confused. “What movies?” They would say, before giving me an odd look and running away. I asked my brothers what movies they were all watching over dinner, and they too looked at me like I was a weirdo, before Mom changed the subject. She did that a lot—especially, when I got kind of desperate, grilling my younger brothers on what exactly they were all watching in that big room. 

But Mom would quickly start talking about something unrelated. I did manage to question one of them in the car when Mom was getting groceries.  Cam was the quiet one out of my siblings, usually keeping to himself, glued to the newest Pokémon release. I found myself with the perfect opportunity. PJ, our brother, was at a friend’s house, so it was just me and him. “You guys watch movies in that red room, right?” I leaned over in my seat and poked my brother’s cheek teasingly. “So, what do you watch?”

My brother didn’t look up from his DS, “They’re not movies, stupid head,” he mumbled through a mouthful of stylus, his gaze glued to the screen.

“Huh?” Intrigued, I leaned over and plucked the game's console from his fingers.

“Hey!”

“What do you mean they’re not movies?”

“Give that back!”  Cam reached out and tried to snatch it back, almost choking on the stylus he had been lazily chewing on, but I quickly hid it behind my back, tucking it into my skirt pocket which was my prime hiding place. “I’m going to lose my Squirtle!”

“Tell me what you all watch in that weird room.”

He straightened up, eyes slightly unfocused from staring at his game. “What are you talking about?”

“I want to know what video time is,” I said, a quirk of a smile on my lip. I enjoyed annoying Cam. I liked it when his cheeks turned the same shade as his hair, and his voice turned whiny like he was a baby. I folded my arms and settled him with my best smile, only for him to spit at me.  “If you don’t tell me, I’m throwing your game out of the window.” It was a lie, obviously. 

But Cam didn’t know that.  

I held my ground when he opened his mouth and threatened to call for Mom. But Mom was in the grocery store, and we both knew if we started fighting, none of us would be getting the peanut butter ice cream we had been promised. I ignored his death glare, settling him with a smile. I had won. 

Only just. 

If I had something of importance, like my phone I used to play app store games, he could easily swipe it from me. “So if they’re not movies, what are you all watching?” I asked. “Wait, are you watching cartoons? How is it fair that you get to watch cartoons and I have to go to stupid recess?”

Cam blew a raspberry and held out his hand for his game. “If you give me my game back, I’ll tell you.” He stuck out his tongue. “I’ll give you five seconds.”

I blew a raspberry back at him. “You can’t time it!”

“Yes, I can.” He wiggled his hand. “Give me my game.” He curled his lip. “Or I’ll tell PJ that you’re hiding his favorite cereal under your pillow.”

I had no idea he even knew about that. Cam was sneakier than I thought.

Reluctantly, I handed him back his DS, and he opened it up to peek at his progress. “Well?”

Cam shrugged. “It’s not movies that we watch,” he mumbled. “It’s a tutorial.” Cam waved his DS in my face. “See! Just like a game.”

I nodded slowly. “So, it’s showing you how to do something?”

“Yep!”

I leaned back in my seat, frowning at a stray raindrop sliding down the window.  “But… what is it teaching you?”

Cam didn’t answer, enthralled in his game, and I admit, I don’t think I wanted to know. All I had initially wanted to know is why they were watching movies without me. I found myself no longer caring about video time. In fact, I enjoyed my extra recess, deciding to sit on the jungle gym and pretend to be the queen to my subjects – the four kids left—who refused to play with me. I pretend-ordered them to get me a giant cake, but the four of them just frowned at me in confusion. 

They were the least energetic kids I had ever met, choosing to sit on the grass and pick their noses, staring at the sky like a giant question mark was looming over them. They didn't even speak. 

When they did, it was just noises, or snorting. 

I got tired of them eventually, and it was starting to rain—which neither of them noticed. One of the girls tipped her head back and didn’t even flinch when fat drops of rain hit her in the face. When the downpour started, I hurried to get inside. Normally, we had to ask a teacher during recess, but I was getting soaked. I tried to open the doors leading back into the school, but they were locked. I found another entrance, which this time led into the auditorium. I planned to go right back to my classroom, though once I left the comfort of the auditorium, I realized something was wrong.

The lights were not on; the hallway that was always familiar to me transformed into a terrifying tunnel of pooling oblivion. There was one light, and I didn’t like it. With it being the only thing lighting up the dark, however, I was drawn to it, an intense red blur illuminating the video room. The door was open, and I found my steps were quickening, my breath heavy in my throat. I had waited so long to see what I wasn’t allowed to participate in, and my curiosity was driving me further and further toward the door. I don’t remember actually seeing what was inside. I just remember stumbling back, a scream caught in my throat. 

I didn’t stop screaming until my mom arrived, but even then, I refused to let her touch me—to let any of them touch me. I was on the ground, sobbing into carpet fibers, clinging onto them like they would protect me. I told my Mom there was a monster inside that room, a monster that didn’t want me to know it existed. When she said I was being ridiculous, I begged her to take me to the video room. And she did. The next day, Mom took me into the video room with supervision from my teacher, and I was just staring at an empty room, an empty television. Even the red light was gone. Mrs. Parish told me it was a nightmare, that I’d fallen asleep and had a bad dream. But I didn’t remember falling asleep.

“There’s a monster.” I kept saying it, over and over again until my mother bent down, and pulled me gently to her height, squeezing my fingers.

“There isn’t a monster,” she said softly, brushing my hair from my eyes. “Some things are not meant for you. Do you understand me, Freida?”

“But—”

“What did you see?” This time, her tone was hard. “Tell me what you saw, sweetie.”

I squeezed my eyes shut and tried to remember, but it was like pushing against a barrier in my mind. “I saw a monster.”

“No, you didn’t.” her eyes were hard. “Say it with me, okay?” she squeezed my fingers again, this time a little too tight. “You had a nightmare, just like Mrs Parish said. It was all in your head."

I took a deep breath and nodded, wrapping my arms around my mother. “I had a nightmare,” I whispered into the soft material of her jacket.

I didn’t believe her, though I didn’t believe myself either.

I wasn’t sure what exactly I had seen. Just like a nightmare or a dream, whatever it was had slipped away, fading into nothing. What I did remember were echoes that didn’t make sense, my own fear suddenly one giant question mark inside my mind. I didn’t remember looking into that room, but I could recall a feeling of unease, of nausea twisting my gut, a gut-wrenching fear taking over me as if I had seen what was inside that room. Part of me wondered if my teachers had stolen away the images in my mind, or maybe I was so scared, my brain had contorted into nothing, into shapes and colors that didn't make sense. I tried to make sense of it.

I tried to understand it, and even conquer my fear of the video room. 

But that sensation never left me; of being watched, phantom bugs writhing down my spine and filling my mouth shaping into an O. The feeling didn’t leave me alone for a while, and every night for two weeks, I dreamed of the video room. I dreamed of a static television looming over rows and rows of shadows, silhouettes of my classmates, who did not have faces when they turned to face me. 

They were watching me without eyes, without identities I recognized, blanketed darkness drowning them, transforming my friends into the unknown, from something I did understand, to a monstrous cavern in my head that felt so unreachable, like oblivion was above me and yet didn’t exist. I couldn't look at my friend's in the eye without a feeling creeping it's way through me, whispering that it wasn't really them I was looking at. 

I became withdrawn from the rest of my class, as well as my younger brothers, hiding away from their faces. 

I felt it being around them, a suffocating darkness eating me up inside, dozens of invisible eyes boring into my back, watching my every move, choking my words before I could speak. 

That sensation came back to haunt me nine years later, unwelcome and agonising, and yet familiar. I got that exact same feeling being around my boyfriend’s family. Well, his siblings, for one. I was yet to meet his parents. 

Spencer Delaney was a catch I didn’t think I deserved. I met him at a party, and he was the type of guy who was both the introvert, sitting with the house cat, and the extrovert, jumping up and down to music, and getting blackout drunk. I met him on the way to the bathroom to throw up, the two of us bonding over our love for potted plants and tragic romance.  Through drunk vision, Spencer had resembled a Hollywood star that night, a sparkling smile under bedhead curls held back by raybans perched on his head. Our first conversation was just me pointing out he’d spilled his drink, and him gleefully naming the stain on his collar. 

He called it Ben. 

Which, as a drunken idiot, I had found a little too funny. 

You know what's weird? I barely drank that night, choosing to stay mostly sober. 

Before I knew it, however, the world was spinning, and the lights were too bright. I could see glistening perspiration on dancing bodies around me, bathed in colors I couldn't name. 

I emptied my guts in front of him, and prayed to every god that I would never see him again.  The next day, however, I bumped into him at a coffee store while filling up on morning caffeine. I was mortified, because Spencer had seen everything, and I mean EVERYTHING that came out of me that night. I’m talking, kneeling on the bathroom floor, and bringing up my stomach lining, making noises no human should be making. When he instantly recognized me, though, I wondered if fate was at play. I never believed in such, except there were dozens of cafés on campus around the city, and somehow I had found this boy, a needle in a haystack. 

Not really, if you think about it. We went to the same college, so we were bound to see each other at one point. But I wanted to believe that something was drawing us together, like we were star-crossed and destined to meet, or whatever. In a way, I was kind of right.

Spencer didn’t have that glow from the night before. His teeth were slightly crooked when he shot me a grin and he was clearly nursing a bad hangover, hiding under his hoodie, but I found myself wanting to get to know him. Spencer Delaney was clumsy, kind of a daydreamer, and clearly the weaker one out of the Delaney siblings—but I found that charming. Endearing. Fast forward three months, and he wanted me to meet his family for the first time. 

The problem? 

Spencer’s family, or at least his siblings, were fucking insane—and I don’t say that lightly. 

Look, I can understand being worried for your younger brother, but these two took this to a whole other level. 

Spencer was talking about dinner at his parent’s house on the way back from class—specifying that his father liked a specific type of soda, and not to ask why his mother didn’t like meat (it was a sensitive subject). I could barely register his words, already scanning the crowd for the Delaney siblings, who loved playing cloak-and-dagger. 

Yes, I mean spying on us. 

I mean the duck and cover, hiding behind books, and darting onto the shadows, spying. 

Initially, I thought their joint obsession with their younger brother’s dating life was kind of cute. Luna Delaney would pop up out of nowhere while we were on a date, and be like, *Oh, what a coincidence! I was going to see this movie, too!* But then it kept happening. I would be at the grocery store, and a familiar bouncing ponytail would be bobbing behind me, her face expertly (or she thought) hidden behind a book. I didn’t even have to be with their brother, I could be anywhere, and somehow, the Delaney siblings would find me. I went to a baseball game with my dad over a long weekend, and somehow, Jasper Delaney was sitting behind me. I knew it was him. Like I said, these guys thought they were inconspicuous, but I would recognize that bushy dark brown hair, anywhere.

I thought it was a joke, because it was almost comical, like I was playing, “Spot the spy!” 

Neither of them were as slick as they thought, they were pretty fucking noticeable in a crowd. 

But when they got progressively better, I got more paranoid. It had been a while since they had been spying on us, and I was feeling on edge.

“My family are kind of weird.” That was what Spencer had warned me on our second date, his joking smile twisting into more of a serious frown. I laughed, and said, *Well, aren’t all family’s weird?* But now I understood his twisting expression. He didn’t laugh at my joke, instead downing his glass of wine and changing the subject. The whole date, I’d caught his wandering eyes—not because he was daydreaming or zoning out like usual. 

He was looking for something, or rather, someone. 

It was when I was ordering dessert, did I glimpse his brother sitting across the restaurant, pretending to be in mid-conversation with a group of people who clearly did not know him. 

He was dressed like he'd rolled out of bed as usual, with no effort, a black hoodie thrown over jeans, definitely standing out amongst suits and sequined dresses.  I should have realized Spencer had been struggling to get through his meal, completely distracted by something out of sight. 

When he threw down his napkin and quietly excused himself, I twisted around on my chair and watched him make his way over to Jasper, his arms folded, eyes dark. They exchanged words, and I watched his brother’s face the whole time. Jasper didn’t smile or look pissed, his expression was unreadable. Eventually, he nodded once and left quickly, easily blending into the crowd. When Spencer came back to sit down, his smile was back, though a little gritted, his grip on the table whitening his knuckles. “Please excuse my brother,” he said. “I have…” he trailed off before pouring himself another glass, and downing that one too. “Overprotective siblings.” 

I didn’t know or understand what he meant until we started dating for real, and it was like dating all three of them.

All of them, because I found myself meeting eyes with all three Delaney siblings, on what was supposed to be a romantic date with my boyfriend.

We had no privacy, and when I thought we had somehow lost them, somehow one of them would be nearby—again, not being the slightest bit slick. I used to play secret agents with my brothers in school, but these guys were grown nineteen-year-olds. Spencer didn’t have an excuse for them, except, “They’re kind of weird” and my boyfriend was right. His family WAS fucking weird. Which is one of many reasons why I was wary of meeting his parents. Was the whole family obsessed with my boyfriend’s dating life? Were they going to stalk my every move? 

Either way, I had no choice whether I met them or not. Spencer had already made the plans, and backing out would be rude.  I was half aware he was talking, my gaze already zeroing in on the late afternoon rush hour streaming past, scanning for Delaney features. All three siblings had the same dark brown curls haloing strong jaws, and darker eyes that full body scanned every passer by. “Okay, so, let’s go through it again, just to be sure."

"Right." I said. "Uh, you told me not to look your dad in the eye, right?"

"Yep. He hates eye contact."

Spencer’s clammy hand was tight in mine, and I half wondered if he was trying to keep me from running away. 

I had already expressed concerns about meeting his family officially, especially when his brother and sister were stalkers, though he had reassured me his parents were great, and I would grow to get to like his siblings eventually. I wasn’t sure about that. 

And judging by the number of times they had been poking around in my life, I had no doubt these two already knew everything about me—probably more than I knew myself.  Which made them not just weird, but terrifying. I never knew when they were going to appear, listening to my private conversations, or just lurking in the shadows.

It was early evening, we had just finished classes, and I was being (dragged) gently pulled to the Delaney house, with one of my hands tangled in Spencer's, my other clutching a cheap bottle of vino I’d grabbed from the convenience store. “Then I have to greet them on arrival, and smile my best, though not too big,” I repeated Spencer’s instructions through my teeth. I had no idea why there were so many rules. I was meeting his parents, not the president. I almost tripped over my heels I thought were a good idea to change into, vastly miscalculating the uneven ground. “Oh. Also, I have to make sure to take off my shoes and store them in the closet. Your mother is a cleanliness freak, and she hates dirt."

I jumped when my boyfriend playfully nudged me, laughing. "You got it!" 

Spencer’s smile made my heart ache. How could he be blood-related to these weirdos, I had no idea. Spencer was the complete of both of them. Luna Delaney was like a snake, a snake I knew would backstab me the second she got the chance. Luna was beautiful, but there was a certain contortion in her lipsticky smile that sent shivers skittering up and down my spine. Jasper at least tried to be friendly, but the grins splitting his mouth apart were too wide like he was hiding something, like he secretly wanted—no needed—me to get away from his brother. His teeth were too sharp, like fangs, and he had a vacancy in his eyes, like he wasn't aware of the world around him, only his younger brother. The Delaney siblings did not deserve a brother like Spencer. 

"Lastly, I can't challenge your brother at a game," I relayed his words from earlier. "Especially when he's drunk."

“That’s right,” my boyfriend said with a sigh.  “I’m sorry there are so many rules, it's just a family thing, I guess…" He trailed off. “I haven’t dated anyone before, so my family are interested in meeting you.” His lip quirked.  “And why my brother and sister won’t leave us alone.”

"No kidding." I rolled my eyes. 

"They're not that bad," he shrugged, throwing me a smile. "Sure, they're invasive, but every family is, right?" 

He was giving them way too much credit. 

I turned to frown at him, at my boyfriend, who was the human embodiment of a golden retriever, hiding under thick brown curls. I had a hard time believing that he’d never had a girlfriend, but considering his siblings’ behavior, maybe he’d avoided it. If I too had an overbearing family, I would be wary of getting into relationships with anyone, terrified of scaring them off. 

The Delaney household was just as I expected, as we headed up a gravel driveway; a large Victorian house surrounded by a white picket fence. The flower garden was perfectly placed, with a small pool carved around the back, and a jacuzzi sitting on a wooden platform. I found myself transfixed by the sight, everything looked so clean and untouched. The pool still had its cover, and the deck chairs surrounding it looked brand new. 

I expected security cameras mounted on the door, already taking full body scans. But the house looked like your average family home. Though the fact that it was far too clean and untouched bothered me. When Spencer pulled me to the front door, I glimpsed a tag still hanging off of a rose bush next to the entrance. I opened my mouth to ask what his parents did for jobs. Maybe they were too busy to enjoy the luxury of their front yard. Before I could, Spencer knocked on the door twice, before shouting, “Hey, Mom! I’m home!”  He opened the door, gesturing me inside a brightly lit hallway which already made me feel at home. 

I found myself standing on a “Home Sweet Home!” welcome mat, which again, looked brand new, my gaze automatically finding baby pictures mounted on the walls, of what I presumed to be the three Delaney siblings.

“Spencer!”

A voice brought me back to fruition, a woman’s squeak from down the long hallway. “Sweetie, is that you?”

“It’s me, ma!” He chuckled, nudging me. “Forgive me, but Mom’s a little deaf, so you’re going to have to shout a little when talking to her. However, her hearing gets a little better when she’s drunk, so prepare to get an earful of saliva when the games start.”

“Games?” I took another step forward, slipping out of my heels.

“Yeah, my family kinda have a thing when we play Monopoly, after dinner,” he said, “Whatever you do… do not take the dog piece. Luna will murder you.”

Nodding, I smiled, marveling at the architecture of the house, a mix of modern and ancient. The glass stairs at the corner of my eye were already scaring me.  “Aww, are those you?” I pointed to the baby pictures, resisting the urge to roll my eyes. “And… them.”

Spencer laughed that time, and it was a throw-your-head-back laugh, the one I particularly loved. “Be nice! And yeah, mom was a menace with the camera when we were kids,” he kicked off his own shoes. “I’m pretty sure she documented my whole life.”

I couldn’t help but notice in one particular picture, the smiling little girl waving at the camera, was a redhead, while I was sure Luna Delaney was a brunette. Sure, she could have dyed her hair, but looking closer, while Spencer dropped his bags and helped me take off my jacket, the other kid photos stood out. The two little boy’s playing in the Delaney flower garden were blonde. I didn’t think much of it, sliding out of my heels. Spencer pulled open a small closet next to the door, and I ducked in, neatly placing my heels next to a pair of battered boots. 

Something stopped me from leaning back and dropping my heels, my fingers wrapped around the shoes. There were so many shoes, and when my gaze tracked the closet, I was seeing jackets and bags, backpacks, wallets, and phones piled inside a small blue basket. Too many, I thought dizzily. So many, for one family of five. It was when I found blurred and old stained red stuck to the bottom of a particular worn pair of converse, rimming the edges, when a scream began in my chest, winding it's way toward my throat. I was partially aware that my boyfriend wasn’t speaking, only allowing me to take in what was in front of me. There was something hanging from above. 

ID tags. 

College ID tags, five of them, swaying from the ceiling. I couldn’t stop myself from reaching out and pulling one of them free, my breath in my throat.

California.

It was a UCLA ID, and it belonged to someone named  Zach Valdez, an unsmiling college student rolling his eyes at the camera. Somehow, I could see real expression in this boy's face, while all Spencer did was smile his sweet golden retriever smile, charming me with a grin and slight quirk of his lip. 

*Zach Valdez*, who had my boyfriend’s face.

Before I could catch my breath, I twisted around with the intention to run, already mapping how I would get around Spencer, and dart toward the door. But what I wasn't counting on, was to find myself inches from a gun, perfectly melded into my boyfriend's hands, his finger teasing the trigger, right between my eyes. His trajectory was perfect, and I realized I had been dating a wolf in sheep's clothing. He was the perfect Delaney sibling, after all. I raised my arms in surrender, and he followed my movement, his eyes drinking me in, for maybe the first time.

Just like him taking me in, however, I was also lost in eyes I thought I knew, eyes that had been behind a carefully sculpted facade. When I looked closer, there was a certain blankness in his face, no contortions in facial muscles, or if they were, it was all planned and trained. Even his smiles were just like his brother's. "Freida Castor," he spoke like a robot, tightening his hold around the butt of the gun. I didn't see him pull the trigger, but something definitely hit me, a sharp thing, which felt like a needle, slicing into the back of my neck. 

*"You're going to tell us exactly what you know about..."* I couldn't register the word, the curl of it razor sharp in my mind, refusing to settle in. When I managed to turn my head, my gaze found the older Delaney brother standing in the hallway, shadowed by light, a pea shooter curled between his lips, a gun pointed at me. I didn't have to search for the last sibling, hiding just outside my line of sight. I saw her ponytail, and then I saw a third magnum pointed directly at my head. 

The three of them spoke as one unit, one being, in perfect, terrifying sync, their voices becoming something else entirely, when they hit the last word. 

Which I still couldn't register. 

And somehow, I wasn't thinking of my current situation, dropping to my knees, all of my breath dragged from my lungs. I was thinking of a room with intense red light, shadows with no faces, and my mother's desperation. 

*Some things aren't for you, Freida. Do you understand me?*

I remember being paralysed, dragged inside the Delaney household, while the three of them repeated the same phrase, two adult voices joining, as I was forced into a leather sofa, a mounted television on the wall switching on, a screen full of buzzing static before words appeared in black and white: *The Delaney Family! In: Hunt down and Delete every ____.*

Spencer knelt in front of me, those exact same words rolling off of his tongue, at the exact time as a woman with a bright, hypnotising smile, flickered onto the screen, her arms by her sides. She reminded me of the how-to tutorial videos you can find on YouTube. The old ones from the 70's with cheesy music. Maybe it was the drugs, but she almost looked like she was bleeding from the static, her body slowly taking shape in the real world. 

While her soldiers, The Delaney Family, swiftly followed her orders. 

Mrs Delaney, looming over me, in fifties style dress, a bright yellow dress, and matching slippers. 

Mr Delaney, lurking in the shadows. 

And the three children, standing either side of me. Spencer Delaney had my arm, while Luna Delaney's fingers were wrapped around my neck, forcing my head forwards. Jasper Delaney held open my eyes, forcing them wide open. I finally understood the blankness in his eyes. I knew why I couldn't read them. 

They say eyes are the windows to the soul, and the eldest Delaney son had a deep, cavernous hole, hollowing him out. 

Finally, I could hear it, and somehow it was familiar. 

It was *home*. 

"You're going to tell us exactly what you know about *Sɥɐpoʍ*."

So yeah, you could say my boyfriend's family was *weird*.

I'll tell you more soon.
