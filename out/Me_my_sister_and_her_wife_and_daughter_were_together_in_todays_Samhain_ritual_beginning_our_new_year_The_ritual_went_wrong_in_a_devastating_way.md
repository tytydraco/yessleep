My adoptive niece was kind of to blame for this mess. I had the feast prepared, my sister-in-law lit the candles, and we even had offerings set on the table for our ancestors and for the Dead.

Now, Samhain is the time that the veil between the living and the dead is the thinnest. As such, we must respect the dead even as they visit us, or else they could turn on us. For our first part of the Samhain ritual, right before sundown, we took our sacred Nature Walk and gathered objects to adorn our family home in the mountain village. For our second part, after adorning our home, we added another piece of a dark bread, as an offering on the altar.

I was the one to prepare the feast. Dark breads are important (we use pumpernickel because one of us is allergic to rye) and wines are the favorable drink for the ritual (due to the drinking laws here, my niece just has to have apple cider). I had a centerpiece prepared; a five-pointed star within the circle, and a threefold knot to symbolize our Goddess.

We'd even said our prayer.

I took my cup of apple wine and took it, leading us out to the family garden for the ritual. Having sprinkled each cup of wine, we said our prayer there.

It was cool that my niece gathered most of the trimmings and made a straw figure. However, she thought it was merely doll-making.

"Eloise, the straw figure is meant to protect us. Have you decided it is the King of Winter, or is it the Goddess?"

"Auntie Lilac, I have decided we could have a man here."

"Ah, so it is," my sis chimed in. "The King of Winter. We'll need to give him a place of his own."

"A place of his own, Mommy Tatiana?"

... ... ...

The photographs of our deceased family members (just the ones who really cared about us; my abusive dad has no place in our home) were placed. The photograph of my niece's first familiar, Aisha, along with the kitty's first cat toy and a fresh helping of catnip, were also placed.

"There's no need to worry, Aisha..." Eloise said as I placed the photo of the deceased cat. Aisha died of feline leukemia at a very young age.

We said our thanks to our ancestors. My sis, Tatiana, placed the seven-day candle by the window.

We had even visited our family cemetery, where some of my ancestors and some of my sister-in-law's were buried.

We'd meditated over the past year, as a reflection.

The bonfire outside was lit. We had danced by it. Because my sister-in-law, Abellona, was a heavy cannabis smoker and it was ruining her life, and she had bipolar and wanted to stop projecting and being just plain manic, she wrote all of those habits down and threw them into the fire, so that she can be clean.

Many of the foods I prepared for the feast were made with sage and rosemary. Catnip was included, because last year when Aisha was still alive, we gave her a separate meal in the feast with a helping of chicken laced with catnip. The catnip was to honor her.

We had our invocations to the Crone Goddess and the Horned God. More so because we had lost Aisha not long after last Imbolc, so we asked for them to comfort Eloise.

And then our s√©ance at the feast had begun.

At the feast, I served the King of Winter first. We broke bread, and we threw some crumbs over our left shoulders for the birds in our area. We have my favorite friends, some sparrows and a whole nest of cranes living next to us. The cranes are neighbors of ours.

The leftovers were put out for the dead. This is where things began to go wrong...

The King of Winter was placed to watch over our seedlings. He'll be burned at Beltane, true, but he wasn't burned early if that's what you think went wrong. No, Eloise did something horrible at the garden.

After I placed the leftovers, including my late mom's favorite wine blend of cherry and starfruit, my late grandmother's favorite combination of pumpernickel and rice wine, Abellona's mom's favorite plate of steamed vegetables, and Aisha's chicken spiced with catnip. I had also placed the meal made specially for the King of Winter.

Eloise, being only 6 years old, wasn't very mature, let alone mature enough to understand why we did our ritual the way we did. She'd been told to stay out of the garden once we'd placed the leftovers there.

"Mama Abellona, could you explain?"

"Our ancestors are coming back to us, so it's best we make it worth their trip."

"But they're not here, really."

Then Tatiana gave her a hard look. "Not always, but the veil is thin. When they are close, we can communicate with them. And they can talk to us, too. There are others who have unfinished business."

... ... ...

I should have known Eloise was about to break the rules by the hustle of wind in the air, the moon glowing somewhat ominously despite it just being the shape of a smile...

I could have done better than to practice some rituals and meditation to put myself at ease, because I caught Eloise in the garden just as she had eaten a lot of the leftovers we put in the garden. Our ancestors' offerings, you see, must not be stolen.

It took a lot to drag her out of the garden. I had to wake my sister. Just before she opened her eyes, though, I heard a loud, thunderous crack. Like if someone snapped a piece of wood really close to my ear.

Then I felt the ground beginning to shake. Like if some Samoan man was lumbering towards us.

"Lilac! What's going on?"

Then Abellona burst in. She seemed manic more than ever.

"Lilac, I can't believe it... The King of Winter..."

She was stuttering to the point that I swear she should have had speech therapy long ago.

"H-h-h-h-h-h-he-e-he i-i-is... He-h-h-he is..."

"What's going on with the King of Winter, darling?" Tatiana asked with a growing fear creeping into her.

Eloise then ran inside our bedroom and hid under the covers where Tatiana was in bed.

And then, I freaking *jumped* when I heard a loud crack of wood as the door to our bedroom opened suddenly, revealing a giant man appearing to be made of straw and dead plants. His voice sounded screechy, like it was mad about something.

"WHERE'S MY FOOD?!"

He was followed by some of the spirits of who we left out the rest of the Samhain food for. Even my mom looked kind of pissed.

It was kind of hard to keep cool and hide my fear, but I was shaken by what breaking the rules got us.

"WHERE'S MY FOOD?!"

Then Aisha's ghost came in and just got in front of us. Like if she felt that we really didn't do wrong and she wanted to help us.

"WHERE'S MY FOOD?!" the King of Winter screeched, louder than before.

"You guys stay here!" Abellona shouted. "I-I'll go help the v-v-village!"

Eloise was still hiding under the covers, and Tatiana was trying to calm her down. Aisha's spirit was meowing loudly at the others.

I saw Eloise wriggle out of the covers with mixed emotions. "Aisha? Wittle kitty Aisha?"

Aisha looked, seemed to recognize Eloise, and climbed up the bed and did that thing cats do like self-petting with their head. Eloise then looked happy to see her familiar again.

Aisha's spirit seemed to whisper something in Eloise's ear. Then, Eloise, seemingly braver, got up.

I was ready to get out and protect my niece while I still was shaken terribly. I was about ready to run while the King of Winter was screeching when Eloise began saying something.

"I... I promise I'll make you some more."

The King of Winter stopped in his tracks, seemingly surprised. The other spirits, the ones of my mom and the others, began to look bemused.

"I ate what was meant for you, and I'm sorry. Can I make you some more, to make it up to you?"

The King of Winter took a moment to think, and then he and the others went away. I think they went back to the garden.

... ... ...

Not long after, and a few hours ago, I made what was left for the ancestors again, and placed them in the garden. Especially the King of Winter's meal.

He'll be there until Beltane. I had Eloise place the offerings, to fulfill her promise. Abellona came back, with some wines the villagers made for us. We had the wines sprinkled onto the garden, and drank the rest. (Not Eloise. We made a cider for her instead.)

I am thankful to have lived through this. To be honest, the King of Winter coming to life on us was so unexpected I swear my heart didn't beat for a whole hour. From now on, we'll be educating Eloise more often. I mean, we *do* get blamed for whatever goes wrong, but we're proud Wiccans nonetheless.
