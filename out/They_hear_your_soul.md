I don’t know if I’ll survive the night. I’m holed up in the attic of my mom’s old farmhouse in rural Ohio, surrounded by dust and shadows, typing this on my dying phone. The air up here is thick, suffocating, and every creak of the floorboards feels like a death sentence. I need to tell someone what’s happening, even if it’s just to warn you. If you’re reading this, please, *stay silent*. They’re out there, and they don’t just hear your voice—they hear your fear, your heartbeat, your very existence. And once they do, they won’t stop until they’ve claimed you.

It started five nights ago. I came back to Ash Hollow to clear out the house after Mom passed. The place was a relic—sagging porch, warped floorboards, and a quiet that felt wrong, like the world was holding its breath. I was alone, sorting through her things, when I first heard it: a low, guttural rasp from the woods behind the house, like wet leather dragging over stone. Beneath it, there was a faint chittering, like a thousand tiny claws tapping on glass. I thought it was an animal—coyote, maybe, or a fox caught in a trap. But it didn’t sound… natural. It was too rhythmic, too deliberate.

I grabbed the flashlight by the back door but didn’t go outside. I’m not that reckless. Instead, I locked every door, checked every window, and sat in the living room, clutching a kitchen knife. The noise circled the house, slow and methodical, sometimes fading, sometimes so close I swore it was right outside the walls. It wasn’t just one sound either—there were others, layered, like a chorus of whispers hissing words I couldn’t understand. I stayed up all night, heart pounding, telling myself it was nothing. By morning, the noises were gone, and I almost convinced myself I’d imagined it.

The second night, I saw one.

I was upstairs in Mom’s old bedroom, sorting through her photo albums, when the lights flickered. The bulb buzzed, dimmed, then flared back to life, casting jagged shadows across the walls. I glanced out the window, and there it was, standing at the edge of the cornfield, bathed in moonlight. It was tall—eight feet at least, its body unnaturally thin and angular, like a skeleton stretched over with gray, leathery skin. Its limbs were too long, bent at angles that made my stomach churn, and its hands ended in claws that glinted like obsidian. Its face was the worst part: no eyes, just deep, black hollows that seemed to swallow the light. Its mouth was a jagged slash, lined with rows of needle-like teeth that quivered as if tasting the air. But its ears—God, its ears—were massive, bat-like, and veined, twitching toward the house like radar dishes.

I hadn’t made a sound, but it *knew* I was there. It tilted its head, and I felt a pressure in my chest, like it was listening to my thoughts, my pulse, the blood rushing through my veins. Then it moved—fast, impossibly fast, scuttling across the yard on all fours, its claws tearing into the dirt. It wasn’t human, wasn’t animal. It was something else, something that didn’t belong here.

I dropped to the floor, my breath shallow, the photo album slipping from my hands and hitting the ground with a soft thud. The creature froze outside, its head snapping toward the window. I clapped a hand over my mouth, terrified that even my breathing would give me away. The rasping came again, louder, joined by that chittering sound, like a swarm of insects crawling inside my skull. Then, from somewhere else in the yard, another rasp answered. There were more of them.

I stayed there, curled up, for hours. The noises circled the house—scraping claws, low hums that made my teeth ache, and those whispers, now clearer: *hear… fear… you…* They didn’t try to break in, didn’t pound on the doors. They just… listened. When dawn broke, they were gone, but the yard told a different story. The grass was flattened in wide, uneven patches, like something heavy had dragged itself through. Clawed footprints, deep and jagged, crisscrossed the dirt. And in the center of the yard, scratched into the ground in letters a foot tall, were the words: *WE HEAR YOU*.

I should’ve left then. Packed my car and floored it back to Columbus. But grief does stupid things to you. I told myself I was imagining it, that sleep deprivation and stress were playing tricks. I decided monolithic stay one more night to finish packing. That was my second mistake.

The third night, I prepared. I boarded up the windows with old planks from the barn, reinforced the doors, and found an old shotgun in the basement with four shells. I set up in the living room, the gun across my lap, and tried to stay calm. The noises started earlier, just after dusk. This time, they were bolder. I heard claws scraping the roof, skittering across the shingles like giant spiders. The whispers were constant now, a low drone that burrowed into my brain: *come out… we hear… your blood…* I didn’t move, didn’t breathe too loud, but my heart was racing, and I swear they could hear it.

Then came the scream. Not mine—human, raw, and terrified, from the direction of Mr. Hargrove’s farm a quarter-mile away. It was cut off by a wet, ripping sound that made my skin crawl. I couldn’t help it; I peeked through a gap in the boards. In the moonlight, I saw one of them dragging something across the field. It was Hargrove—or what was left of him. His body was limp, his throat torn open, blood soaking the ground. But his eyes… they were still moving, wide and alive, locked on the creature dragging him. The thing was different from the one I’d seen before. Its skin was fresher, less leathery, and its movements were smoother, almost human. But its ears were the same, quivering, and its eyeless face turned toward the house, like it knew I was watching.

That’s when I understood. These things—they weren’t just killing. They were *changing* their victims. The fresher ones, the ones that moved like people, were new. Hargrove was becoming one of them. His body was already starting to twist, his fingers lengthening into claws, his skin graying as he twitched in the creature’s grip. They were like Death Angels, silent and sound-obsessed, but worse. They didn’t just hunt. They spread, like a virus, turning their prey into more of themselves.

I didn’t sleep that night. I sat in the dark, gripping the shotgun, listening to the rasps and chitters circling the house. They tested the walls, their claws scraping slowly, deliberately, like they were savoring my fear. At one point, I heard a low, resonant hum, like a tuning fork vibrating inside my bones. It made my vision blur, my head throb. I realized they weren’t just listening for sound—they were sensing *everything*. My panic, my sweat, the adrenaline pumping through me. They could hear my existence.

The fourth night, I tried to fight back. I set up traps—pots and pans tied to strings near the doors, hoping the noise would scare them off, like I’d read about the Death Angels in old stories. I kept the shotgun ready and stayed in the upstairs hallway, where I could see both staircases. The noises started at midnight, louder than ever. The traps worked, in a way. When one of the creatures tripped a string, the pots clattered, and I heard a piercing screech, like the sound had physically hurt it. For a moment, the rasping stopped, and I thought I’d won.

Then they went berserk.

The house shook as they slammed into the walls, their claws tearing at the boards. The whispers turned into a deafening hiss, words overlapping: *too loud… you… die… hear you…* I fired the shotgun through a window, the blast echoing in my ears. The screech that followed was inhuman, a sound that made my nose bleed. I saw one of them in the yard, its head split open where the shot had hit, revealing a pulsating, fleshy mass inside, like a second mouth. But it didn’t die. It staggered, then lunged back toward the house, faster than before.

I retreated to the attic, pulling the ladder up behind me. The creatures didn’t follow, but I could hear them below, tearing through the house. Furniture splintered, glass shattered, and that hum—God, that hum—kept vibrating through the walls, making my vision swim. I don’t know how long it lasted, but by dawn, they were gone. The house was trashed—claw marks on the walls, bloodstains on the floor, and a smell like rotting meat and ozone. I found another message scratched into the living room wall: *YOUR SOUL SINGS*.

Now it’s the fifth night, and I’m still in the attic. My phone’s at 3% battery, and I haven’t slept in days. The shotgun has one shell left. I can hear them outside, closer than ever. Their rasps are slower now, deliberate, like they’re savoring the hunt. The chittering is louder, and the whispers are clear: *we hear… your heart… your soul… come out…* I’ve realized something terrible. These things—they’re not just drawn to sound. They’re drawn to *life*. The louder your fear, the stronger your pulse, the more they want you. And when they get you, you don’t just die. You become one of them, your body twisting, your mind trapped inside a rotting, eyeless shell, forced to hunt with them.

I can hear claws on the roof now, scraping, searching. The hum is back, shaking the air, making my teeth chatter. I don’t know if I can stay silent much longer. My heart’s pounding so hard it feels like it’ll burst. They know I’m here. They’ve always known.

If you’re reading this, don’t come to Ash Hollow. Don’t look for me. And whatever you do, don’t make a sound. Don’t even think too loud. They’ll hear you. They hear everything.
