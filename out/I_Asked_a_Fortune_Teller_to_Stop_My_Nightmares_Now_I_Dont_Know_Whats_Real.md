I used to have nightmares when I was a kid. Not the kind that fade when you sit up and remember where you are. Mine arrived the same way every time, like a ritual I couldn’t stop.

The floorboards would  
creak once, as if someone had placed a foot beside my bed. Then I would hear a  
slow dripping, steady and patient, as if water were leaking from a tap inside  
the dark. I would hold my breath and count the drips and hope they would stop.  
They never did.

He came after the  
dripping.

The Grey Man.

He would just materialise  
out of nowhere, standing beside my bed, phasing in like something from a sci-fi  
movie. If he stood up, I knew he would be taller than the door frame. His skin  
was the colour of ash and where his eyes should have been there were two empty  
pits. His mouth was a thin line that would sometimes open into a wide smile  
showing rows of too many teeth. He would tilt his head as if I were an item he  
was deciding whether to buy.

He never climbed onto the  
bed, like you hear in some sleep paralysis dreams. He would crouch low next to  
me, bring his face close to mine and breathe in, as if smelling me the way you  
smell a book you loved as a child. Then his long hand would slide down, and  
with a gentleness that made it worse, he would take my ankle and pull me under.

Under the bed there was  
no carpet and no wood. There was a place that didn’t belong in a house at all.  
The air was hot and thick. It tasted like coins left in your mouth too long.  
Heat rolled up from the ground and made my eyes water. He would drag me along  
the rough dirt, pebbled with little shards and seeds that cut my back and arms.  
When I reached out to try and grab the walls, they were damp in a way that  
stung. Coated with an acidic gloop that you could never wipe clean. The place  
smelled like old blood, and the sweet rot you notice when you walk past a bin  
on a hot day.

There were insects  
everywhere. I could not see all of them, but I could hear them. A dry clicking  
sound from little legs. A soft buzzing from wings. The cautious rasp of  
mouthparts trying a new surface to see if it could be eaten.

Behind us there was  
nothing that looked like a way back. There were tall shapes made of the same  
hot dirt, shaped like pillars, shaped like bodies that had forgotten how to be  
people. He would pick me up and place me on a chair like I was a prized possession.  
Then he would take a thin knife from the fold of his skin, and he would begin.

He never rushed. He never  
made a sound. He would slice pieces from my arms and lay them on the ground as  
if sorting fabric. He would rest his palm on my chest to feel my heart speed up  
and slow down. He would take a strip from my cheek and watch the tear run  
around it. I begged him the way children beg and promise to be better. He  
tilted his head as if memorising the noise, but he would never stop. He never  
showed emotion, no joy, no anger.

In those dreams I  
remained alive when I shouldn’t have. There were times when the only part of me  
left was my head. I could feel the dirt under my tongue. I could feel insects  
trying the corners of my mouth and changing their minds. I could smell the heat.  
I could see him as he bent close and, for a moment, set his forehead to mine.

Then I would wake up with  
my jaw cramped and my throat raw from air I must have swallowed while I  
screamed without sound.

My parents did what they  
could. They never used words like cursed or haunted. They used words like  
specialist and appointment and therapy. I drew the Grey Man for a woman with a  
calm voice who didn’t look at my drawings when I handed them over but always  
took a moment before she turned the paper. I learned breathing exercises. I  
learned to plant my feet on the ground and list five things I could see.

The dreams didn’t stop at  
once, but they frayed at the edges. They came less often. I grew taller. I  
learned to put my hand on the bedroom light switch before I went to sleep. When  
I left for college, they did not follow me.

I told people I was a  
nervous kid who grew out of it. That was mostly true.

I am an adult now. I pay  
my bills on time. I have a decent job and a flat that is more tidy than messy.  
I do not scare easily. There is nothing in my life that looks like a horror  
story if you glance at it from the outside.

Last week I went to a  
funfair with Beth. She is the sort of friend who can talk you into trying food  
you do not recognise and rides you claim to hate. We wandered through the  
lights and the noise and the smell of hot oil.

There was a fortune  
teller’s tent set up near the far fence. It looked like it had been pitched in  
a hurry. The canvas did not match. The guy ropes were assorted colours. It was  
dark inside and too quiet, as if sound did not want to sit in there.

Beth wanted to go in. I  
didn’t, not because I was scared, more that I didn’t believe in this type of  
shite. But she said please, and it was the only thing there without a line and  
I was thinking about doughnuts.

The woman inside looked  
like she’d stepped straight out of a cliché. Shawls, bangles, long grey hair.  
But what caught me wasn’t her. It was the bird.

A white bird, perched on  
her shoulder.

Beth smiled nervously.  
“Aww, a dove.”

The woman didn’t look up  
from her cards. “Not a dove,” she said. Her voice melodic. “A crow.”

I squinted. “It’s white.”

That was when she finally  
met my eyes. Her smile didn’t reach them.

“Not everything white is  
innocent.”

Beth shivered, muttered  
something about it being pretty, then sat down.

She went first.

The woman inside took her  
hands and asked about her true desire.

The woman read her cards,  
asked her about her one true desire. Beth blushed and said something stupid  
about wanting a nice boyfriend.

I laughed and muttered,  
“Jesus, at least make it achievable. Give the old bag a chance to fake it.”

Both of them turned to  
look at me the way teachers look at you when you talk during lessons.

Beth’s turn ended with  
the rustle of a curtain of beads and the tiny chime of something metal. The  
woman lifted her eyes to me and asked me to sit.

I didn’t want to, but  
Beth gave me that look.

The chair was lower than  
I expected. It made me feel like a child.

The woman’s hands were cool,  
and her thumbs were rough where they pressed against my palms.

I made another joke about  
props and smoke machines, and she did not smile.

“Do not insult what  
listens,” she said. “Some things are bored enough to answer.”

I raised an eyebrow. She  
looked past me and then at me, like a doctor waiting for you to say where it  
hurts.

“I feel your resistance,”  
she said kindly.

“Because this isn’t  
real!” I snapped back. “It’s a joke. A tent in a mud pit funfair with plastic  
beads on the curtains. You’re not communing with the universe; you’re just  
scamming bored people out of pocket change.”

Her expression didn’t  
shift. She simply tilted her head, birdlike.

The white crow ruffled  
its feathers, as though it had heard me.

“Even a joke,” she said,  
“is heard somewhere.”

“Great,” I muttered.  
“Tell the cosmos I said hi, then.”

Her lips twitched into  
something that wasn’t quite a smile.

The crow shifted its  
claws against her shoulder, white feathers catching the lantern glow like bone.

“You’ll laugh until it  
answers,” she murmured.

Beth shot me a look, the  
kind that said *don’t start*.

I leaned back in the  
chair, folding my arms. “Fine. Go on, tell me my fortune. Make it quick.”

The woman’s gaze didn’t  
waver. “When you mock the door,” she said softly, “you invite whatever waits  
behind it to knock.”

That was when she asked  
me my one true desire.

I chilled for a minute. I  
didn’t want to give the old woman a heart attack.

I told her my life was  
fine. I told her I had enough money and enough work and enough friends for the  
kind of person I am.

Then I said the only  
thing that had ever been an honest wish for me.

I said I wanted no more  
bad dreams.

Her eyes went soft and  
far away. She let go of my hands and traced circles on the tablecloth with one  
finger.

Then she said a rhyme. I  
remember it almost exactly:

Grant this woman the power  
*to see*  
*What’s good and right and true.*  
*But where the light of goodness shines,*  
*The dark will see her too.*

I felt goosebumps on my  
arms. I covered it by rolling my eyes.

I said something unkind  
about how she must do well on people desperate enough to be happy with a poem.

She looked at me for a  
long time without blinking.

“Do not anger what you  
cannot see,” she said. “It is patient. It can wait until you forget you spoke.”

We left, and I made a  
show of being hungry and moved the conversation to food.

That night I dreamed I found  
a fifty-pound note folded into the lining of my coat. In the dream it felt  
stiff and new, with the smell of ink and the slight waxy drag against my  
fingers.

I didn’t think anything  
of it and pretty much forgot the dream as soon as I woke.

But that day, it was  
unusually cold for May. Bitterly cold.

I fished in my closet for  
my winter jacket and slipped it on. Halfway to work I slipped my hands in the  
pockets for warmth and my fingers grazed something hard.

I pulled it out.

It was a red envelope  
with my name on the front, still sealed.

I opened it cautiously  
and lifted the sparkly Christmas card from the paper.

On one side it read:

Merry Christmas, lots of  
*love, Grandma xxx*

And on the other, a  
neatly folded £50 note was stuck to the side with tape.

I must admit, I was a bit  
like “no way” at first. But then I thought, people forget to open Christmas  
cards all the time, right? Just a coincidence, I told myself. I wasn’t  
impressed.

The next night I dreamed  
that the woman at work who collects complaints like stamps would call in sick.

She did.

I told myself that one  
was almost predictable. She had coughed the day before.

On the third night I  
dreamed that I was eating the most delicious bowl of strawberries and cream I  
had ever eaten.

In the morning there were  
strawberries in the fridge, now I don’t buy strawberries as a rule. I’ll eat them at restaurants, but I won’t have them in my fridge.

You buy them on a Monday  
and by Tuesday night they have grown their own mould colony and have elected a  
mayor.

I checked my banking app  
to see if I had bought them half-asleep the night before. No charge.

I told myself I must have  
paid cash and forgotten.

I ate one and it tasted  
like a memory of summer. So sweet and fresh.

On the fifth night I  
dreamed of Beth. I dreamed she won a ridiculous prize at a ring toss.

In the morning, she sent  
me a photo of herself with a teddy as big as she is and a message that said *I am finally a winner* and a row of hearts.

I asked which fair. She  
said not the same one, she had gone with a “new guy friend.”

On the sixth night I  
dreamed of rain.

It poured in the dream,  
and everyone on the street ran.

I dreamed I stepped under  
a doorway that didn’t leak, and the person beside me stepped aside so I could  
fit.

When I woke up and went  
to work the sky broke while I was walking. The doorway I chose did not leak. A  
stranger moved over with a smile.

He handed me a napkin. He  
said I looked like I needed a win today.

I stopped telling myself  
it was nothing. I still tried to pretend, but it wasn’t a true pretending.

On the eighth night I had  
a different kind of dream.

I was in my room in the  
dark.

I couldn’t move.

The floorboard by the  
door creaked.

The sound wasn’t loud,  
but it was near the kind of volume that fills a whole house if it’s quiet.

Then there was the  
dripping again. It came from everywhere at once, as if every surface had been  
given one drop and told not to waste it.

I woke up with my heart  
climbing the wall of my chest.

I did not sit up. I lay  
still and I listened.

The house is old and does  
what old houses do. Pipes expand. Nails settle. Wood flexes.

The difference was that I  
knew the rhythm of this house.

This creak was not the  
same.

I could point to where it  
came from in the dark. It was the board by the door.

The rain was still  
pouring outside. I could see droplets dripping steadily from the window frame,  
but this wasn’t the same.

It was slow enough to  
make me count it and then lose count.

I could smell a dampness  
that didn’t belong to a leak.

I didn’t go to work that  
day.

I sat on the sofa in a  
daze, hands shaking as I sipped the same cup of cold coffee I’d held for four  
hours.

I didn’t understand what  
was happening.

I was so focused on the  
good things I was getting, I forgot I could have bad dreams too.

I stayed up as late as I  
could, refusing to go into the bedroom. But by 1 a.m. I couldn’t stay awake.

I dreamed I was back  
under the bed.

The air was hot, and the  
smell of iron sat on my tongue.

I was strapped to the  
same chair from my childhood.

He was there. The grey  
man.

Standing in front of me,  
that emotionless stare piercing my soul.

He took a step forward.

I thrashed and pulled at  
the restraints, desperate to get free.

He stopped, tilted his  
head, and placed a white envelope on my lap.

I woke up panting, hair  
stuck to my sweat-covered forehead.

My wrists ached and by  
the morning, small bruises had formed like faint ligature marks.

I came down the stairs to  
a small white envelope posted through my door with no stamp.

Inside it was a note that  
said:

*Keep sleeping well.*

The font was cheerful.  
The ink smelled faintly of almond oil.

I stood very still  
holding it and listening for the drip.

Last night I didn’t want  
to sleep.

I made tea. I watched  
shows that don’t require attention. I texted until my phone felt hot in my  
hands.

At 3 in the morning, I  
was tired enough to promise myself that fear is fuel and sleep isn’t the enemy.

I lay down.

I told myself that I had  
invented patterns because the fortune teller had given me a poem.

I reminded myself that I  
am not twelve years old.

I didn’t dream.

I woke just before 5  
a.m., exhausted. I lay in the dark willing myself to go back to sleep just a  
little longer.

I squeezed my eyes shut  
and that’s when I heard it—

The floorboard by the  
door gave its single careful creak.

I kept my eyes closed.

I told myself that if I  
could not see, nothing could see me.

Then the dripping began.

It was closer than it had  
ever been.

I opened my eyes and,  
barely moving, I tried to look at the slot of dark under the bed.

The smell of heat and  
metal pushed up over the edge like breath.

I reached one hand out  
and placed it flat on the floor only to prove that I could.

The wood was cold.

And then something in the  
dark below touched the other side of the board as if answering the gesture.

The board lifted against  
my palm with the weight of a measured hand.

I pulled my hand back and  
sat up.

I clicked on the lamp.

The room was the same as  
it had been.

The tall bookcase. The  
plant that did a trick for me last week. The frail curtains. The bed.

I told myself not to be  
dramatic.

The fortune teller had  
told nothing more than a fairy tale.

She could have said it to  
anyone.

And of course it would  
work sometimes. The world is full of coincidences.

I clicked the light off  
and tried to remember the therapist’s advice from so long ago.

My eyes grew heavy.

Five things I can see.  
Lamp.  
Door.  
Bed.  
Blankets.  
Book.

Four things I could touch.  
My blanket.  
My hair.  
My t-shirt.  
My nightstand.

Three I could hear.  
My heartbeat.  
My breathing.  
Dripping…

Two I could smell.  
Iron…  
Rot.

One I could taste.  
Old… coins.

“No,” I whispered.

My eyes snapped open.

The dripping sound was  
louder now.

Like something wet was  
seeping through the ceiling.

Except there was no  
stain. No leak.

And the smell—God, the  
smell—filled my throat until I was swallowing it.

It was the exact same as  
when I was a kid. Heat. Dirt. That metallic tang of rust and blood.

The floorboards creaked.

Not in the house. Not  
somewhere far away.

Right outside my door.

I held my breath, waiting  
for the sound to stop, but it didn’t.

Each groan of wood bent  
closer. Slow. Deliberate.

The therapist’s advice  
was gone.

The old woman’s words  
were all I could hear:

Do not insult what listens.  
*Some things are bored enough to answer.*

And I realised—

I had asked for no more  
bad dreams.

But maybe I’d given it  
permission to step into the waking world instead.

The door creaked open.

The Grey Man stood tall,  
grinning, his teeth reflecting in the moonlight.

He uttered one word:

*“Ready.”*

And then he vanished.

I think I screamed until  
morning.

I decided to go back to  
the fair.

I was going to find the  
tent, the old woman, and the dove-crow thing and tell her to undo what she did.

But… when I got there, it  
was gone.

The whole fair had packed  
up and moved on.

I managed to catch the  
owner of the teacup ride before he drove off and asked him where they were  
going next.

He made a comment about  
me being a carney chaser and I clapped back with something witty… honestly, I  
was too exhausted to remember.

Basically, I just wanted  
to find the fortune teller.

He frowned at me like I’d  
just asked him where the dragons were kept.

“The fair doesn’t have a  
fortune teller,” he said flatly.

I actually laughed, even  
though my throat felt like it was closing.

“Yeah, sure. Old woman.  
White bird. Creepy rhymes. You can’t miss her.”

He shook his head,  
climbed into the cab, and muttered something about weirdos before slamming the  
door.

The truck pulled away,  
leaving me in the half-empty lot with a stomach that felt like wet cement.

I stood there for way too  
long, hoping maybe the striped tent would flicker into view if I just stared  
hard enough.

It didn’t.

So now I’m stuck with  
this—whatever she gave me.

I can’t make sense of it.

I can’t make it stop.

And the part that really  
scares me?

Last night wasn’t a dream.

So, what will happen when  
the Grey Man takes me away \[again?\](https://www.youtube.com/@midnightcreepypasta0)
