My life as a baggage handler for a major airline is fairly normal,  with the occasional fuckery of mad passengers that missed a flight or didn't have their luggage show up. 

All of us as a crew get along, and we have fun. Our manager is a cool, southern gal with a great story of how she started in this company. 

This last summer we were super busy, all of us getting way more than our normal hours allotted. Plane after plane, bag after bag, the days were long but the job was easy. 

This fall however, things got weird around the job! Ashley, our GM, became a recluse almost as soon as the weather changed! She was not as boisterous as she normally is, and we all got worried.

"Have you noticed a change in Ashley's demeanor? I'm worried!" I said to one of my co-workers. 

"I've noticed it as well! Let's just keep an eye on her, she'll snap out of it eventually!" Said Amber, one of my supervisors

"Maybe a night out would cheer her up maybe!?" Said Tony, pointing at the schedule, adhering to some of us could make that happen.

The next day, Ashley came in and she looked horrible! Her hair was unkempt and she looked like she had been hit with a truck!

"Ashley, a..are you ok? What's wrong?" I said, hoping to see that smile she always flashed us

"I'm fine!" She said, "just go back to work! Nothing to worry about!"

Well, we all worried that day. It wasn't the same, and things were about to take a horrific, scary turn.

It was late afternoon when three of us, myself, amber and Tony were nearing the end of our shift when we noticed something off about Ashley! 

She was in her office, but had a blank look on her face, staring straight into the computer screen.

"Ashley, are you ok? What's wrong?" I asked, not knowing what's about to happen

"mors pura est, infernus vivit!" She scowled, with this crazed look in her eyes.

"GO GUYS!" I shouted, as we all broke for the door! 

"intrant tenebras, lux non erit amplius! aufers tenebras lunam tuam et uri" as she run after us! 

We all get outside and we all have this deep dread look on our faces!

"Somethings up and we need to find out!" I said, hoping someone would help

"Yeah, that's normally not how she acts! Let's wait and see if this subsidies!" Tony retorts, letting out a large exhale

All of us go quietly back inside and find her back at her desk, normally doing what she does best, working away, listening to music and being a smart-ass!

"Hey, are you feeling ok? You just went off a few minutes ago!"

"I feel fine, why?"

"Well, you'll never believe this until we tell you!"

We proceeded to tell her what all transpired and she was getting this look of terror and shock!

"I...I.....I did that!?" She whispered

"All the way down to the last sentence!"

After she went home for the day, we all rooted her desk for any clues to what made her change! We found it and it wasn't what we expected 

Tony pulled a book out on pagan witchcraft, which only heightened our senses!

From that day forward, we all looked at her in a different way, but she is still the cool boss we all love and adore, even if she's got some demons around!!!!!
