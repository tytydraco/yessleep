I  moved into this apartment complex six months ago. It’s one of those brutalist concrete towers—built in the late 60s, full of asbestos and character. My unit is on the ninth floor, end of the hall. It’s quiet, cheap, and the view’s decent if you lean far enough over the balcony.
There’s only one thing I don’t like: the hallway.

It’s always been too long. Too narrow. Lit by flickering fluorescents that hum just loud enough to make you feel like you're being watched. The other tenants on my floor are older. Mostly retirees. I rarely see anyone coming or going. The whole place feels forgotten—like it’s a step behind time.

Still, it’s home. Or it was, until Halloween night.

I hadn’t planned on handing out candy. It’s an apartment building. I didn’t think kids went door-to-door here. Most years I just turned off the lights and watched horror movies with wine and a blanket. It’s become a tradition.
That night was no different. I was curled up on the couch watching The Thing when I heard the knock.
It was soft. Deliberate. Just once.
6:34 PM.

I paused the movie and stared at the door.
Another knock. Same volume. Same rhythm.
I got up and checked the peephole.

A little girl stood outside. Six, maybe seven. Dressed like a ballerina—pink tutu, sparkles, white tights. Her costume looked… old. Not vintage, just worn out. The tulle was stained like it had been dragged through a parking lot.

She didn’t have a candy bag. Didn’t say “trick or treat.” Just stood there with her arms at her sides, looking straight ahead. Not directly at the peephole, but close enough that it was unnerving.
I didn’t open the door.

“Sorry, sweetie, I don’t have any candy,” I said, gently.
She didn’t move.
I waited. Watched. A full minute passed before she turned and walked slowly down the hallway toward the elevator, which—oddly—never dinged when it opened.

6:50 PM. Another knock.
I checked the peephole again.
A boy this time. Maybe ten years old. Wearing a cheap astronaut costume. The cardboard chest piece had flaked silver duct tape hanging off the edges, and his helmet—a scratched-up bike helmet with a plastic visor—was fogged from the inside.
Just like the girl, he didn’t say anything. No candy bag. Just stood there.

I watched for over a minute. Nothing changed. Then he turned and left—same slow, dragging walk toward the elevator.
Again, no ding.
I started feeling... watched.
I checked the hallway cam through the tenant app on my phone. It showed a live feed of the ninth floor hallway—but the screen was blank. Not off, just black. Like the hallway wasn’t there anymore.

By 7:15 PM, I’d had three more visitors. All children. All silent. All dressed in decaying versions of classic costumes—a firefighter with a melted helmet, a nurse with a rust-colored stain down the front, a cowboy missing one boot.
Each time I looked through the peephole. Each time, I felt colder.

It wasn’t just weirdness. It was the way they stood. Perfectly still. No fidgeting. No shifting their weight. Kids can’t stay still that long. These ones… weren’t right.
I messaged my friend Tasha on the third floor.
Me: Are there kids trick-or-treating in the building tonight?

 Tasha: Not that I’ve seen. Why?
I told her about the kids. She sent back a skull emoji and said “creepy af.” Then nothing.

At 8:03 PM, the ballerina came back.
Same girl. Same spot.
Only this time… she was facing the peephole.
Her eyes didn’t blink. Her head twitched slightly every few seconds, like someone had dropped a needle on a broken record. Her mouth was open just a little too wide, and her teeth—god, her teeth—were small, gray, and far too many.

I backed away from the door.
Not ten seconds later—another knock. Softer this time. Almost… curious.
I didn’t move.
The knock came again. Then a third time. Gentle. Rhythmic. As if she were knocking to a beat only she could hear.

I stayed in the kitchen until 9:00 PM.

That’s when the adult knocked.
Three firm knocks. Sharp. Final.
I checked the peephole.
No one.

But the hallway… had changed.
Gone was the dim fluorescent light. Instead, there was a flickering orange glow, like from a dying fire. The carpet was gone, replaced by bare concrete—cracked and wet. The walls were streaked with mold and something darker.

Then I saw them.
All the children I’d seen before. The ballerina. The astronaut. The nurse. The cowboy. Lined up along the hallway, shoulder to shoulder.
And behind them stood something else.
A figure. Tall. Inhumanly thin. Wearing a mask made of shattered glass.

The mask reflected back my own face—but distorted, broken, rearranged like a puzzle with pieces missing. Its limbs were too long. Its hands too sharp. And in the warped reflection, I could see something crawling beneath my skin.

I blinked. And in that moment—it was right at my door.
I screamed and stumbled back, engaging every lock I had. Deadbolt. Chain. Floor bar. Then I turned off all the lights and sat on the kitchen floor, clutching a knife like it meant something.
No more knocks came.

12:03 AM. The power went out.
My phone lit up with one last notification from the tenant app.
New hallway footage available – 9th floor – 11:59 PM
 [WATCH]
I clicked it.
The camera flickered on. The hallway was normal—at first.

Then the lights dimmed, and one by one, the children appeared on screen. Silent. Motionless. Lined up across the hallway, staring at my door.
Then the glass-masked figure emerged behind them. Its limbs twitched as it walked. It moved like a broken spider, limbs jerking half a second too late, like something was controlling it from a distance.
Then the ballerina stepped forward. Placed one hand on my door.

She leaned in close—face nearly touching the camera—and whispered something.
No audio. No subtitles.
But I swear I heard it in my head.
“You looked. We answered.”
Then the feed cut to black.

I left that night.
I didn’t pack. I didn’t wait for sunrise. I ran down nine flights of stairs and drove until my hands stopped shaking.

I’m in a motel three cities over now.
But last night, around midnight, I heard a knock.
Soft. Deliberate.
I’m on the ground floor.
There’s no hallway outside my room. Just a window.
I looked through the peephole anyway.
The carpet was gone.
