A void that is not named, because it has no mouth, no voice, but devours. It is a silent hunger that asks for no permission or forgiveness, a borderless hole, infinite and closed, that never fills, but always weighs. Like an invisible specter, it crawls through the cracks in the mind, planting shadows where there was once light. It is a wound that doesn't bleed, but oozes something indescribable, something that smells of old desperation, of buried fears that germinate in the dark. It festers, untouched by the outside world, yet it wraps around everything you once knew, changing the shape of your thoughts, warping your perception. The silence it brings is louder than the loudest screams, echoing endlessly in your head.

The void does not stay still. It twists, it bifurcates, it divides into a thousand threads that tie and cut at the same time. It weaves cobwebs of memories that never existed, moments that seem to be yours but that you don't recognize. They linger at the edges of your mind, fading before you can grasp them. It forces you to look into its abyss, but the abyss does not return your gaze. It swallows you whole, and all you are left with is the echo of something that could have been a thought, a flash of sanity that drowns before it reaches the surface. A sense of knowing without knowing, like you're on the edge of remembering something important, but it's always just out of reach.

It is a parasite that feeds on order, that chews up meaning until nothing is left. It gnaws on your sense of self, carving away at the edges until nothing is solid, until the ground beneath you feels like sand slipping through your fingers. Everything loses weight, even time, which seems to crumble into irregular pieces, impossible to piece together. Uncertainty becomes a language you don’t understand but speak, a tongue without words that fills the space between your ribs, where the heart beats slow, unsure, as if doubting its own existence. Each beat is a question, and every breath a fragile gasp.

Your body starts to feel foreign, detached from the weight of your thoughts. The fever grows, but it does not burn. It is a heat that cools, a cold sweat that never quite falls. It lingers on your skin, a constant pressure, a strange numbness that pushes against you from the inside. You think of escaping, but the void has no doors. Or does it? Maybe yes, but they are closed, or open, or simply don’t exist. You can’t know. You can’t know anything. You try to push it away, but it follows you, a shadow that clings tighter, squeezing the life out of you until your thoughts are a blur.

And then there are moments when you think you’ve found a way out. A fleeting idea, a possibility of escape. But the void is cunning, it wraps around your thoughts, distorts them, twists them into something unrecognizable. The answers you seek are buried beneath layers of confusion and fear, and even when you claw at them, they slip through your fingers like smoke. You think you're free, but you are never really free. You’re just treading water, suspended between what you feel and what you cannot name. What is real, and what is just a trick of your mind? The boundaries blur, until they no longer matter.

And there you are, suspended in the middle of it all, unable to escape, unable to stop the relentless crawl of the void. It's not a place, not a thing—it’s everything. It’s the air you breathe, the space between your bones, the silence in your soul. And maybe, just maybe, that is the worst part of all. Because it isn't something you can fight. It's something that becomes you. You don't know when it started, or if it ever will end. You don’t know anything, and that—more than anything—is what weighs you down the most.
