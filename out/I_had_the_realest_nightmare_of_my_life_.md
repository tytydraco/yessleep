As a kid, I always had nightmares. Maybe it was my overactive imagination, maybe it wasn’t. I loved horror, I still do. However, some things are terrifying to the point they’re not fun. Especially if they happen to you. When I was a kid I had one nightmare I couldn’t distinguish from reality, I still have to calm myself down and convince myself that it wasn’t real. 

It was dark. 

To be fair, I was supposed to be sleeping. I would have to guess at that point it was  10 oclock, I was sweating from every orifice of my body, and It was completely dark. As I half-scrambled, half-crawled around my queen size bed I had previously told my parents I was too big for, it suddenly became a mountain. I was engrossed by an even bigger sense of fear than before, as at any moment I could see myself falling off the edge of what was now a huge cliff. 

My hands pulled and searched for an edge as I desperately tried to find a way off the bed. my heartbeat growing louder, a fleeting anxiety rising through my lungs, then my chest, making its way out of my mouth as I sighed heavily. It was so silent, the room devoid of any sound. Shouldnt my parents be up, I thought to myself. My mind started running, horrible thoughts trailing through it as I tried to continue my terribly facilitated plan. I feigned a smile as I tried to convince myself that everything was okay, I was okay. 

Then I heard it. Scratching, right outside the window just parallel to my dresser, Just behind me. My hair stood up, as if it could feel someone looking at me through the window, glaring deeply into the window. I didn’t move, couldn’t. I was nearly on all fours, my knees sinking deeper and deeper into the mattress beneath. 

I stood like that for a long time. I don’t know how long, I surely wsn’t counting. Minutes passed by, an hour even. Until my hair went back in place, and it was hard to differentiate between the fear and the overwhelming need to sleep. 

“Eric,” a voice called from the hall, “Eric are you asleep?” 

It was my mom, but I still did not move from my place in the mattress, too scared or just tired to even lift a finger. 

“Eric honey,” the voice called again but louder, a harshness  in its tone, “Eric open the door.” 

The voice had evolved into something almost unrecognizable, and I shuddered as it continued. 

“ERIC” “ERIC” “ERIC” “ERIC” “ERIC” “ERIC” 

it shrieked as it started to bang on the door, sounding more and more like a wild animal, any attempt to exploit my willingness to open the door was gone. 
I said nothing, I did nothing, the only thing left of me was my fear.
And then it was over.
As quickly as it had begun, it had passed. 

I blinked, and winced as the harsh sunlight peeking through the blinds hit my eyes. 

I was still on my knees.
