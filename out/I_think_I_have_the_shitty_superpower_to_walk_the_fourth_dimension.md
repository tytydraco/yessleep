It became worst this past few months. Feels like it has even happened my whole life come to think of it. My tears just come out pretty easily whenever I think about it... and I can't really let that happen so bear with me.

I just feel... so lost.

I don't know how else to describe it. The day goes super normal, but whenever I get stressed, or scared, small peculiar things get to be ever so slightly different.

Like today for example, one of my coworkers was getting mad that had done a specific thing, and I was pretty sure that I had done the right thing, though everything pointed out that I had done the wrong thing, and I have the vivid memory of having done every thing right, but it's not, as per usual. And all of a sudden, we have the uncanny proof that I had indeed done the right thing, against all odds. And everyone is now confused. That's the newest thing as it will become clear soon enough.

The strangest occurances follow similar patterns. I am 100% certain of having locked the door, as if it mattered that I had done so, and when I come home, the door is unlocked. Even checking the cameras, I can see that I forgot to lock it, when I specifically have the clear memory to have double checked that I indeed locked it. At this level, even obsessive compulsive behaviour and to-do lists won't help me.

Let me try to remember... I believe... The earliest flashback I have from similar events is when I had my parents got mad at me in jarring ways and on multiple occasions for having left the milk outside the fridge whenever I was going for my midnight dairies (I would have the kettle on, have some boiling water, put some honey, salt and milk in one cup, drink that lukewarm, fatty, sugary and salty drinkable perfection while standing, put everything back and go to bed) and I kept swearing to them that I ensured everything was back. But the milk sure was sour in the morning from having been left outside against what I am sure I had done.

At some point, I thought it was some awful and wasteful joke some sibling was playing with me, to make me feel bad and stupid and to shatter my version of reality.

But, it did not stop at them.

What else. At school I had people almost literally bark at me for being in their way when just moments ago I was not. I thought I was losing it, or that they were bullying me to make me feel small and attackable.

Then on other, even weirder occasions, I would have no recollection whatsoever of ever having done a homework, plain and simply having postponed then forgotten to do it, and when the teacher was coming to pick up the assignment, I was planning to just play fool and look in my bag in a futile attempt to play "I think I forgot my homework at home" only to be thoroughly puzzled by the touch of the lined paper, already done, in my very own handwriting. And when seeing my slow response the teacher would just scoff and yank the pages from my hand. So normal. So off.

As I grew, so did my interest for the Mandela effect. Just out of curiosity. I never paid much attention to it, but it felt so bizarre and relatable that many would feel as I would at a grander scale. And it kind of gave me solace about what I thought was that constant gaslighting, be it from social or divine prank.

But the worst happened lately.

You see, I have been used to having people telling me that I did or did not do something that was contrary to what I thought happened, so I learn to play meek, low profile. I just accepted that reality just... bends a little in small, shitty ways. Especially when I am having intense emotions. Maybe that’s just how I ought to experience life. Either by having a terrible memory, or by... passively and blindly stumbling through that strange forest of probable distortions.

What changed however, is, somehow, I thought, what if I could control this. After discovering a version of Minecraft that had the player able to move through a fourth dimension, something clicked. If all it is, is that I nudge through a continuum of worlds right by the one I fleetingly experience, maybe if I “decided” the outcome, I could use this to my advantage.

Unfortunately, it worked.

About five year ago, if I remember well, someone was belligerent towards me for no reason, and I thought, they need a little lesson, and as my stress level went up, I had a mental image of where I wanted to shift us. So we ended up pretty much where we were, except when they reached in their pocket, they could not find their phone anymore. Their annoyance turning to confusion then to the budding of a fear, the anger they had quickly subsided as they kindly asked me if they could use the computer to locate their phone, and I told them “It’s probably at your home” “That can’t be true, I used it on my way here, even minutes ago” and, lo and behold, at their home it was.

That person shut it. They could not believe it and neither could I. Well. I knew right then, that things were going to be different.

Bit by bit, step by step, I learned to navigate those little skiddings. I don’t know how to describe it, but it felt awesome. I finally had a say, and could gaslight others who were mean to me into another set of rules where they were at loss for words in the uncanny outcome of what was in front of their eyes, unable to prove what they had just experimented and where I was the lock master.

However... I don’t know how to deal with this anymore. How is it even possible that I can do such thing. What does it mean to even do this. What’s the morality of bending my reality and the one of others to my will.

And the problem is the more I stress about it, the more things just… shift around. And not by much mind you, but still enough that I almost feel bad for the current… situation of the world. I mean, look at the states for goodness’ sake. That’s not the reality I was born in, I think.

But back to what happened. I decided that, for my own sanity and the one of the people around me, that I should stop. It was so addictive, but I had to stop.

I had grown neglectful, and I feel that when I would push on one end, "it" would pull on another.

Whatever "it" is, be it karma or the invisible hand, or simply the effect of thinking with hubris that I could control reality (literally whoever truly thinks they have that sort of power is most likely a little crazy and probably I am), "it" was reclaiming something. Always. Especially when I would do something for vain reasons.

I have never shared this with anyone. This is the first time I ever open up about this. And it freaks me out. "It" freaks me out.

There’s been more violence around me. Things I had never seen before. Gazes of evil and… hunger? Literally I even had a person tell me that they’d gobble me up and when I had a double take, their face just… stirred back to normal.

I don’t know what to think anymore, and the problem is, that fear, that stress, it shifts stuff around me even faster than ever before. It’s almost as if I was on a local optimum on this not so metaphorical landscape of the fourth dimension, and I am now just on the verge of a precipice I can't even see... But definitely feel.

Everything is so freaking weird. And even as I breathe, trying to calm, the walls just wobble a little.

I don’t know how to go home. I’m home… but… it’s not… home.

I’m just… lost. Anybody else experienced or still experiences the same? What’s your coping mechanisms? Is there a such a thing as North Star to guide me back?

I’m just… so lost.
