It’s hard to make money when you ain’t got none to start with. Hard to get a job when you ain’t got no suit for the interview, no shower to smell all professional and such, no cash for the bus fare to the office. Even now, I’m on borrowed time typing all this shit up. The library closes soon and that’ll be curtains for my time on the computer today. But, what’s been happening lately, it needs to be shared. And, ordinary folk don’t tend to listen when I talk. Barely even shoot a glance in my direction. Most think the homeless are raving loons or drunks as is. No doubt you people would think the same if I approached you in the street sprouting the horrors of the last few days. 

No, this needs writing down, so my words stand on their own. So you can judge my story fairly, separate them from the haggard wretch I have become.

Like I said, money don’t just happen. It happens even less for a guy like me. So, sometimes you gotta be creative, gotta be an opportunist. 

Most of y’all don’t need an explanation for what dumpster diving is. Even if you had no idea, a good whiff of me would tell ya half the story.

Anyways, that’s how I spend most of my days. Jumping in and out the stuff ordinary folk tend to want gone. It’s not glamorous by any stretch. But, there are times when the hunt yields gold. And, for those like me, that’s our payday. That maybe a night on a soft and warm bed with a shower, maybe a bottle of Jack and a pack of cigs, maybe a bump of something sinful.

See, we ain’t too strange from ordinary folk. We live from one paycheck to the next. Yet, the hunt of these discarded treasures mean a damn sight more to me, than it probably does to you in your cozy house with your running water and loaned out car. 

No, we share that same fear. That desperation which grips us each time we fail. We flee from the same ghosts. And this week, I ain’t stopped running.

***

It was Monday and the morning sun had already started kicking up a stink from one of our usual treasure troves—a huge son of bitch dumpster parked up behind a hotel and museum off of Fourth. It’d gifted plenty over the months, ranging from half full wine bottles to unopened toiletries to even a wad of cash that had been bunched up into an old bedsheet. 

I stood by the dumpster keeping watch, whilst Toeless went about digging. He was deep and dirty in the muck, scooping with his hands like a kid playing in the sand. 

He wasn’t scared about much, our boy Toeless. He was just a kid—no more than nineteen or something, but the streets scare the fear out ya, age a man in ways you wouldn’t believe. He’d been on the streets so long—born on them, in fact, he had frostbite on damn near every part of his body. Hence, how he’d got his name. A particularly bad winter and not a sock or shoe to his name. He often joked that by the time he got to my ripe age of forty-two—if he got there at all—he’d simply be a blackened, featureless mound of puss, still craving the next ciggy .

“Any luck?” I shouted to him, over the metallic clank of the dumpster. 

Our boy wasn’t the most discreet. He tended to want to rush in and rush out. I, on the other hand, did a more thorough search, being a tad more deliberate not to attract attention. I heard the rustling from within the dumpster stop.

Toeless straightened, his face peering over the top. It was streaked in sweat and muck. He was panting and wiping at his eyes with the back of his filthy hands. He shook his head, then pulled himself out.

“You sure?” I said, spitting on the ground. “Been a while since Fourth gave us nothin’."

“Go if you think you can do better,” he croaked between pants, then dropped to his ass and started fishing about his pockets for a ciggy.

“Okay,” I said, taking a quick glance up and down the alleyway, “just keep your eyes open for our boy, Marty. We’re one close call away from that son of a bitch thinking he’s a *real* cop.”

Toeless sniggered with a ciggy pinched between his lips, relentlessly flicking his empty lighter for a spark.
I groaned as I hoisted my tired body up and in. Immediately, I was hit by that familiar hot stench. Like someone had made a vomit milkshake and left it out in the sun to curdle. I retched, doubled over—which was a rookie mistake because my nose was now closer to the filth—and spat a huge glob of phlegm onto a piece of shit-smeared linen. 

“Good lord, boy, you lose your nose last winter?”

I heard him chuckled, then looked up to see a plume of smoke rise up from where I’d left him. Looks like the boy got his lighter working again. I smiled, wiping away the spit from my lips. The kid deserved some good luck once in a while.

I pulled my jacket up over my face. It did nothing to the smell, just made sure that none of that rotten steam or bile yellow juices didn’t get anywhere near my mouth. 

A couple of weeks back, I was in the dumpster off Carnaby street and had been careless, yanked at something I thought was an old sleeping bag—but later turned out to be a rucksack full of spoilt dog meat—and, as soon as I dislodged it from the rest of the filth, the kick back sent me sprawling backwards, screaming and mouth first onto a pile of used nappies. Besides the disgust and hour of vomiting, I’d got pretty sick afterwards. And, when you ain’t tethered to a tax code, getting sick ain’t much of an option.

Still heaving, I gingerly scooped out the piles of rotten food, unearthing more potent odours. Ammonia, excrement, that sickly sweet scent of rot. Withdrawing my hands, I watched the mulch bleed into my gloves and stain them a sinister black. 

I plunged my hands into the soft, slippery mound of muck, felt it squelch, ooze, churn between my fingers. I fished out something utterly revolting. Pretty sure it had been alive at some point, but now was just a sinuous slab of hairy, bloody flesh. Skin hung from it like a melted Halloween mask and a thick, grey vein slopped out like a bungee coated in vaseline.

I vomited. Not the first time I’d handled a dead animal before. But it never gets easier. A rat? A fox, maybe? 

I was just about to tap out, call it a day. Then I looked up at the sky, saw the sun had risen up above the flanking buildings, now flooding sunlight along the alleyway, warming up the dumpster, making everything within it, including me, start to sweat and stew. I had to be quick. That heat was gonna kick up a stench I wouldn’t be rid of. 

This was probably going to be the best dive of the day. I had to press on.

I thought about the hunger pinching in my gut. The need for some cash for food. Cash for a beer and maybe a night at the hostel with a warm bed and shower. Maybe we could replace Toeless’ lighter.
Besides, with the light, we were no longer cast in shadows and, if I knew our boy Marty, he’d be around soon to sniff us out. I decided to dig into the filth one last time, praying, hoping it had not been all in vain. 
 Then, my hand knocked against something hard. It felt like a small rod of some sort, all gnarled and ribbed in texture. I pulled the thing out and inspected it.

“Any luck?” Toeless shouted in. 

“Maybe,” I said, cradling the thing in my hands. It had some weight to it.

It was a statuette. As I wiped at the muck, I could see it was made from some kind of crystal. Alabaster white marbled in a deep red, like blood frozen within cracked ice. The statuette was of a man and, as I turned it over in my hands, I could see he had numerous faces around his head, each pulling a different expression: happy, angry, sad and…I couldn’t quite figure out the last one. Just a blank face, different from the rest, crudely finished unlike the delicate craftsmanship on the rest of the figure. This face had two deep pin-pricks for eyes and a wide, thin line where you’d assume a mouth to be. Other than that it was featureless and, for some reason, haunting to look at.

“Reg?” Toeless hissed, rapping on the dumpster with a knuckle.

“We might have gold,” I said, stashing the statuette away into a jacket pocket. 

“Good,” he said, “because we’ve got trouble. Marty’s doing his rounds.”

I rose up, just enough to see him. 

Christ. Marty, the security guard. Mr I-am-the-Law, action-rolling around street corners, wielding a flashlight and a walkie talkie. Probably a good kid, but a damned nuisance, especially if we wanted to keep this dumpster in the Hunt.

“Make yourself scarce,” I hissed down at the boy.

“But what about—”

“Just go,” I barked, “I’ll lay low.”

Toeless sprinted off in the opposite direction to Marty, being careful not to stray out from the shadows. I dropped down into the dumpster, wedged into one of the dryer parts of the filth between a couple of cupboard boxes. Then, I draped myself in that soiled linen. Closed my eyes and held my breath. Marty didn’t clock me. 

And then I was running, soaked in filth and stinking of shit, but alas I was smiling. The statuette swinging about in my jacket pocket. It had the weight of so much promise. The hope of a meal today, maybe even a comfortable night’s sleep. A pack of ciggies and a new lighter. Maybe, if we’d truly struck gold, enough money for a suit for an interview that I didn’t yet have, a job, a house, a car, a family—again, a life.


***

“Got a lighter, mate?” Toeless croaked. His voice full of gravel. Way too old for a mouth that young. 

We’d stationed ourselves at our usual spot for such a hot day, in the shaded doorway of a abandoned pawnshop on the high street.

“Sorry mate,” the man in the suit said as he walked by, “why don’t you both just get jobs?”

Toeless and I pressed out our most rehearsed smiles, nodded and then said, “God bless.”

“…you piece of shit,” Toeless added, under his breath then took a deep drag from his ciggy; his hands shaking with rage.

“Calm yourself, boy.”

“Calm? Calm?”” He blew out a plume of smoke, then spat as far as he could across the pavement, quite impressively striking the window of a parked car. “why have we always gotta be the calm ones? You heard him. He deserves a good thump.”

“True,” I said, stifling a laugh. Then I nodded and patted the boy on his knee. “however, ordinary folk tend to assume we’re scum—either drunk, violent or deranged, or all three. It’s best we don’t give them a reason to think those things.”

Toeless stood up, blew out a deep breath, combed his hands through his hair. Smoke still coiling out from the ciggy between his fingers. He began to sob. I looked away and gave him some time to let the hate out. It’s not that I didn’t care for the boy, I did. It’s just Toeless never liked being visible when the tears came on. 

After he’d stopped and the silence wore out. He slowly returned by my side and started fumbling about with his lighter again.

“You okay?” I asked.

“Yep.”

“We’ll get you a new lighter, kiddo. Don’t worry.”

He cursed and dashed the thing across the pavement. “Can I see it again?”

I went to reach for the statuette, paused and shot him a curious look. “Why?”

He shrugged. “Dunno, just bored.”

I fixed him with a stare for a moment. Searched his face for mischief. Looked upon his shaking hands, those nicotine-stained fingers. The first lesson you learn on the streets is that craving can turn any man into a thief. Second lesson is that theft can turn any man into a corpse.

Toeless smiled. First time he looked his age in a while. I relented, dug out the statuette and passed it to him.

“Be careful—”

“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” he said, immediately inspecting the thing. “What d’ya think it is?”

I shrugged, watching him turn the thing over in his hands, wipe some muck away from one of the faces. 

“Kinda looks like you,” he chuckled.

“Shove off,” I laughed, playfully thumping him on the arm.

“No, I ain’t kidding,” he said, raising the statuette up for me to see. “That angry rotter. You can’t tell me that don’t looks a little like you.”

The statuette’s face was twisted with snarling rage. I supposed the boy had a point. Same drawn out face, same hook nose from my fighting days, same patchy beard.

I grunted and turned away. 

“You think Maggie will buy it?”

I shrugged, looked back to him. “She buys half the trash we bring her. The better question is how much she’ll cough up.”

Toeless grunted, already too bored with his question to listen to the answer. Instead, he watched a well-dressed woman leaning against an old van and lighting up a ciggy. He handed the statuette back to me, rose up and shambled over, putting on that same limp he tries anytime he’s desperate. He says it makes him look more pitiful; I say it makes him look like a damned zombie.

The woman disguised her grimace well with a smile. Flinched slightly when Toeless got too near. Flinched again when he put out a hand. It wasn’t long before he stormed back with a face like a Wet Wednesday.

“I hate ordinary folk sometimes,” he slumped down beside me again, curling up into a ball with his head between his knees.

“Patience, kiddo,” I said, “as soon as she closes shop, we’ll pay Maggie a visit.”

***

“I told you I don’t want your business anymore,” Maggie said with a tired look upon her face. Her grey hair was pulled back into a fist and wore earrings the size of fishing lures. She was stood, outside her pawnshop, bathed in the yellow streetlight, her keys poised to lock up.

“I know,” I said, approaching from the shadows with my hands raised in surrender; Toeless followed closely behind. “I’m sorry we showed up before close last time.”

Her face was a hard outline. She fixed me with a stare. “Lost me a few customers with the stink you brought in. No-one wants to stand in the same room as a man who smells like the inside of a dumpster.”

“We’re sorry, Maggie,” Toeless chirped over my shoulder. “It won’t happen again.”

Then, when she glanced his way, he grew quiet and  shrank behind me. 

“We ain’t here to waste your time,” I said, hands still raised like I was held at gunpoint. “You know we only come to you if we think it’s something good.”

Maggie worked her jaw, chewing a thought over. Then, she unlocked the door to the shop and opened it. “Head on in. Make sure you wipe your feet.”

We sheepishly pushed our way into the darkness until the lights flickered on and the inside of the store flashed into view. Glass cabinets crowded with antiques and jewelry. Maggie marched in past the two of us, rounded the counter and beckoned us over. 

“What you got for me?”

Toeless started jabbering. I raised a hand up and he immediately hushed.

Maggie always seemed to make him nervous. It was bizarre. Put the boy at knife-point with a couple of renowned murderers and he wouldn’t bat an eye. Put him anywhere near Maggie and he wilted like a dying flower. I always thought that it was something to do with his mother. But, I’d be waiting a lifetime before the boy ever spilled anything about her.

I stepped forward, a solemn expression on my face, so Maggie could tell we weren’t messing around. Then, I placed the statuette before her. The gemstone clicking as it met the glass top of the counter.

She inspected it. A curious look upon her face. She looked back to me.

“It stinks of shit.”

I nodded. “Most of the gold we bring does.”

She nodded, eyes back on the statuette, turning it over in her hands. Then, she let out a sigh and placed it on the counter. She folded her arms and then fixed me with a stare.

“Get out my store.”

“Wait, what?” 

“You’re wasting my time,” she said, that tired look washed over her again.

I shook my head, “No, we ain’t. What’s wrong?”

“We ain’t messin’, Maggie,” Toeless chirped up.

“I thought,” she said, blowing out another sigh, “that you’d found something serious. Maybe some blood quartz spiritual totem or some shit. I have a buyer who laps up anything of the sort.”

“But…” I said, curious about the allegation headed our way.

“But…” Maggie said, turning the statuette around to show each face, “this is a joke, Reg, and you know it. Look at these two faces.” 

Toeless and I leaned in, squinting in the dim light. 

“No way,” The boy said, stifling a laugh. “That’s some David Blaine shit.”

Whilst I wouldn’t have described it quite as eloquently as Toeless, the boy had a point. Something strange had happened over the course of the day. Something that, of course, would spark skepticism from the pawnbroker. You see, that little statuette of a man with many faces stood proud upon Maggie’s counter, the reddish pigments in the gemstone glowing in the lowlight like bloodied veins, and now shared the likeness of both Toeless and I. A face for each of us. Mine still had that face torn with anger; his a face bisected with a grotesque smile. 

“Maggie, I can explain,” I began to protest, scooping up the statuette and turning it over in my hands. 
But I couldn’t. 

*What the fuck was happening? What did this mean?*

***

“Great,” Toeless shouted up into the night, raising his hands up like he was chastising a god. “What are we gonna do for ciggies now?”

I was sat still inspecting the statuette in the moonlight. It hadn’t been a trick of light. It was crafted to such intricate detail that our image was unmistakable. All the same, those other two faces remained unperturbed.

I looked up at Toeless, who had his hands in his pockets and was kicking stones across the empty road. It must’ve been close to midnight as the drunks hadn’t yet left the bars. I watched him sulk, my mind wandering to a nasty place. 

“Toeless,” I hissed, “you know anything I don’t?”

His face scrunched up. Then, a smirk. “What you mean, Reg?”

I couldn’t tell who he was anymore. It certainly wasn’t Toeless. Just a sack of skin and bones wearing a disgusting little smile. A fire started burning up inside me. A heat I’d never felt before, summoning words that swelled up in my throat desperate to climb out.

“If you’re gonna be a thief,” I said with gravel in my voice and fixing him with a vicious stare, “you gotta be a liar too. And that you ain’t.”

A laugh. Weak and stuttering like an old mower. He started stammering, screwing his face up and cocking it like a confused dog.

“This,”—I rose up and shook the statuette in his stupid, smiling face—“could’ve been a meal tonight. Could’ve been a couple of beers and a warm bed. Could’ve been a new lighter, pack of ciggies, even enough for a new start.”

He was nodding so fast his head looked like it was tied on a string. 

“And you fucked it up, kiddo,” I said, an uncontrollable hate curling around every word.

“Reg, please,” the boy said in a small voice. He was cowering away whilst I pressed in. “I ain’t no thief. I don’t know what you’re talking abo—”

I struck him. In the face, just below the right cheek. My hand half-open and all clumsy. Damn near broke my wrist. Toeless folded. Hit the ground like a sack of spuds and started whimpering. I looked down and couldn’t see the boy I’d spent years on the streets with. Just saw a pile of pathetic, rotten meat. A thief. A liar. A corpse.

Betrayal, it burned in my veins. Turned my muscles to stone. I was screaming at him. I couldn’t tell you what I was saying. Must’ve looked feral. 

I had to kill him. A man on the streets is nothing without his word. Toeless needed to die for what he'd done. He’d fucked us. Stolen and replaced the statuette somehow. The bastard had probably already flogged the original and, for all I knew, had a pocket full of ciggies and a new lighter to boot.
Toeless scrambled about on the floor, raising his arms up to protect himself. He pleaded to me through the snot streaming from his face. His cheek had already started to swell and blush.

I shook my head and stood over him. The statuette clenched in my fist, ready to pummel his face into mush. I was breathing so fast, so hard.

“Please, Reg,” Toeless blubbered, curling into a ball. “I ain’t got a clue what you’re—”

“The statuette,” I hissed, grabbing him and pulling him up to face the moonlight, “you swapped it out somehow. With this…this thing!”

He started to cry, play dumb, begging me to stop and believe him.

It had to be him. I didn’t know how or when, but Toeless had swapped it out with a counterfeit. There was no other explanation. Those faces were unmistakeable and had clearly changed over the course of the day. Scum. The boy was nothing more than a greedy liar. And the streets had plenty of those. 

No. He had to go. 
He had to go.

I raised the statuette up to strike him. It briefly caught the moonlight. A slither of silver. 

*Wait. Was that…*

I paused, took a better look at the statuette. I brushed my thumb over one of the faces, wondering whether what I was seeing was real. And yep, no doubt about it. 

Immediately, I felt the violence fade from my veins. The rage ease within my ragged lungs. 
The kid was telling the truth. No doubt about it.
Toeless peaked up from the knot he’d formed, panting and shaking. His eyes wide and wild. A snot and spit glaze upon that confused face. 

“What’s going on?”

“I…I…” I said, shaking my head in disbelief. “I don’t…I’m sorry, kiddo.”

I stumbled back onto my ass, still cradling the statuette in my hands. Guilt and horror twisting in my guts at how quickly I’d turned on the boy.

*What was going on? What was this thing?*

Toeless slowly pulled himself up and tentatively shambled toward me. 

“Reg? What is it? Are you okay?”

The boy had no sense of danger. Though, he flinched when I looked up at him.

“I’m sorry, boy. I truly am. I don’t know what’s happening.” Then, I passed him the statuette with my shaking hand. “Tell me, that third face ain’t the spit of Maggie.”


***

Maggie probably wasn’t keen on seeing us again, let alone wielding a totem of her likeness and a crazy story. But she had to see it. 

We wandered from streetlight to streetlight. Toeless was still shaken up from my outburst. Though he was the forgiving type and hated being alone, so he followed me, whining whilst he nursed the back of his head. He’d cracked it on the floor when he fell. It was a small cut, but pissed out plenty of blood. It'd soaked the rag we’d fashioned out of the sleeve of my shirt, turning it muddy. We meandered through the drunks who poured out the bars. No-one even gave us a second glance. All of them, too busy laughing, talking and making false promises to each other. 

We arrived at Maggie’s shop to find the lights still on and the back door ajar. No sign she’d left. 

Toeless peered through the gap in the door, then turned to me. “You think we should…?”

I shrugged, pulled the door open wider and took a look. A corridor washed in a sickly yellow light. A couple of doorways leading to storage cupboards and then finally ending in the entrance into the shop front.

“Does she still keep the rifle under the counter?” Toeless hissed, pulling the matted red rag from his head, inspecting it before reapplying.

I shrugged again.
 
“Maggie,” I called into the store, “it’s Reg and Toeless. We’re sorry about everything. We’re hoping to come in and have another chat. We thin—”

A clangor from down the hall. Then, a loud wet slopping sound.

Toeless and I froze, then looked at each other. “Did you—”

“Yep.”

“What was it?”

“I don’t know,” I said, frowning at the closed door at the end of the hall. 

“What if it’s a break in?” 

“Maggie?” I called out again. “You there? We’re coming in. Please, don’t shoot us.”

Toeless, fearless as ever, shrugged at me, stepped inside. I followed quietly, in close pursuit, slipping the statuette into my hand, readying myself to use it. 
We held our breath while we pushed open the storage room doors that lined the hallway. Each room, so swollen with the night, was crowded with looming silhouettes. The darkness turning furniture and haphazardly stacked boxes into monsters. 
All clear. 

We were suddenly faced with the final door of the corridor. The one that opened out into the shop front, where Maggie had only an hour or so ago chastised us.

I reached out for the door handle, then glanced back to see Toeless. I froze. A sickly pinch in my gut. 

*Wasn't he in front of me?*

He stood way off, loitering by the exit, arms dropped limp at his sides. His face was…off. Eyes staring blankly at me. His eyes dilated, almost swallowed by darkness. And that smile, a crude line splitting his face beyond anything human. Beyond that, the face was featureless. A slab of shapeless flesh. And yet, I knew it to be Toeless… 

“Toeless?” I said, my voice cracking. “Are you—”

“Reg?” 

I spun around to the sudden noise behind me and saw Toeless looking back at me through the threshold of the doorway to the shopfront.

I glanced back to where that awful face had been to find an empty corridor.

“Did you…” I said, tripping over words, “What was that?”

Toeless pulled me into the shopfront, dragging me down behind one of the counters. I glanced back to the door again, the corridor stretching out towards the night. Empty.

I turned back to the boy and, before I could talk, I saw fear in his eyes. The same I had seen during my frenzy. He slowly raised a finger to his lips.

“I saw something,” I hissed.

“I know. I saw it too.”

“It was—”

“You,” he said, his voice trembling, “you were talking to this…thing. Its face, it was so wrong. Angry. Like it could spit venom. Didn’t look human, but I knew it was you, Reg.”

"Me?"

He nodded.

“Where’d it go?”

He shrugged. 

“Why ain’t we running?” I asked.

He nodded, beyond the counter.

I slowly rose up. My muscles tensed into ropes as I desperately tried not to make a sound. The shopfront gradually came into view.

There, across the room, beyond the rows of the cabinets shining with antique jewelry and military memorabilia, stood a figure behind the shop counter.
It was Maggie. But something wasn’t right. It was like she was frozen in time. Her eyes were unblinking and staring out across the room towards us, fixing us in place. Her face was twisted into an holy mask of despair. Dramatic and exaggerated. Her mouth upturned into a ghastly crescent. Teeth protruding haphazardly like tombstones in a vandalised graveyard.

I dropped down to the floor. 

“What’s going on?”

Toeless shrugged, his eyes fixed upon that open doorway behind us. "I just wanna leave."

I followed his stare and saw that the corridor leading out to the rear exit was suddenly shrouded in darkness. A yawning square of black now stood at our backs.

“What do we do now?” Toeless whispered.

“I mean, it’s Maggie. She’s got a temper on her, but she’s also got a gun if someone else is in here with us.”

“But,” Toeless said, grabbing at me before I stood up, “what if she shoots us?”

I blew out a sigh, shook my head. “Then, you might get a new nickname. Come on, she ain’t gonna”—I rose up, raising my hands in the air for a third time that night. I expected to turn and see Maggie training her rifle on me and ready to give us another lashing.

But she wasn’t. She was still stood, pulling that awful face. Her eyes still locked upon us. 

Toeless stood up next to me, hands aloft and shaking. Then a loud bang. We both jumped, turned to see the door behind us had slammed shut. Our gaze slowly returned to Maggie.

For a moment, we all stood, frozen in anticipation, with a silence stretching out between us.

Then, her face unchanging, Maggie slowly dropped below the counter and out of sight.

“What the f—” Toeless said, before being cut off by a strange noise.

A fleshy slapping noise, like someone scrambling across the floorboards with bare feet. Pattering, fast and loud. Heavy laboured breathing getting louder and louder. It was getting closer.

Then, I saw her scuttle between a couple of cabinets then disappear. 

“Was that…”

I nodded. My ears pricked to the sound, trying to sense where the pawnbroker was headed. 

“Fuck!” Toeless shouted, tumbling into me and nearly sending me sprawling onto the floor. “Reg! She’s there!” 

He pointed into a corner of the room where the shadows pooled in an almost deliberate manner. Total darkness. Total silence.

Great. Now I was praying for the rifle.

Whatever was going on with Maggie. Whatever that thing in the corridor was. I’d rather be swimming in a dumpster than face either of them.

“Maggie?” I croaked out. I twisted the statuette in my hands. My grip so tight the carvings scratched at my clammy palms.

Toeless padded from one foot to the other. Eyes snapping to the door.

A glimmer of light. Two pin-pricks blinking into view. Like distant stars in a night sky. They were eyes. Swollen dark eyes, suddenly growing milky like opals. Her face emerged from the shadows, drawn out and pale, jaw hanging slack and swinging. Her mouth still twisted into that unholy shape.

“Maggie,” I said with a little more gravel in my voice.

 “Whatever has gotten into you, we ain’t stickin’ around to mess with it. Stay back, okay? We’re going to open this door and you won’t see us again. Is that clear?”

I heard a clicking noise and then the door beside us yawned open. 

Toeless pressed in close and whispered, “Door’s open, Reg. We gonna run?”

I nodded, eyes still fixed on the face hanging amongst the shadows. 

“Okay, just tell me when.”

I nodded again.

Maggie’s face jerked about, snapping up and sideways. A gargling noise erupting from that grotesque mouth. That mouth, now twisting further and further out of shape, straining at the corners until crimson tears formed and slowly ripped larger and larger, revealing more and more teeth crowding her jaws. The skin, it just kept moving and pulling tight against the sides of her face, splitting more of her mouth, sliding away from slick, purple gums before retreating above her nose, then her eyes. Her face now a shining, red smear.

She scrambled towards us on all fours. Arms and legs all spindly and now bending in all the wrong places. The skin still peeling away from her face revealing a skull slathered in a viscous, bloody paste. More and more she pulled herself away from her skin, leaving behind chunks of flayed, bruised flesh.

“Reg!” Toeless screamed from the door. “What are you doing? We gotta go!”

But I couldn’t move. I was frozen in horror, almost fascinated by the sight before me. The skin shed from the bone and muscle, and, like a sodden wash cloth, retreated, as if dragged by something unseen, back into the shadows. The thing that remained was grotesque. A sharp, skeletal torso with a skull crammed with teeth. It stretched out thin spidery limbs, each draped in a trellis of rubbery blue veins, making it almost resemble a winged beast.

Suddenly, the Maggie-thing came at us, scuttling across the floor like a roach.  

Toeless and I ran—choosing the best of two terrible options—clambering through the darkened corridor, half-expecting that gormless spectre to lurch out from every room. We scrambled through the shadows, hands clawing at the night, toward the yellowed streetlight beyond the yawning door. The sound of something skittering behind us. A guttural moan vibrating through the walls, through the air, in my chest. Maggie was pursuing us. Fast.

That door, always so far away. I could feel her, swiping at my legs with those gnarled, clumsy limbs. Her hot breath warming the air, turning it thick with rot. 

And somehow, Toeless made it. I was close behind. Stumbling into the alleyway, falling to the floor and turning to see Maggie’s hideous body, now a vicious knot of blood and bone, lurching towards the threshold. I flinched as she lunged forward, with a mouth crowded with alabaster barbs. That jaw distending until her chin dragged across the floor. She went for us.

Toeless slammed the door shut. A loud crashing sound. The force of her body colliding with the damn thing nearly sent him flying. But he held. 

“Reg! Help!”

Maggie was hammering at the door and Toeless was struggling to keep it closed. 

She slammed against it again. Her deformed face peering through the opening. I jumped forward, throwing my body weight behind the door. It closed and Toeless secured the bolt. My face was pressed so hard against the door I could hear Maggie scratching at the steel, her throat making that awful gargles.

“What the fuck was that?” Toeless said between pants, then slumping to the floor.

I joined him. Both our backs against the door. The murky moonlight casting monstrous shadows across the cobblestone alleyway. 

“I have no idea,” I eventually said, feeling that statuette in my pocket and withdrawing it. 

It had changed. Of course, it had. Why was I now so surprised. Maggie’s likeness was no longer. Now, pinched between the faces of Toeless and I was a warped horror. Multiple eyes now peering out from knots of fused flesh. A mouth yawning open like a tear in the skin and packed with shard-like teeth. A monster. Maggie was a monster. 

Panicked, I turned the statuette over in my hands, inspecting my own face. Still that downturned look of anguish, that visceral sadness, yet, thankfully, still human. But for how long?

Would Toeless and I suffer the same fate? And, as I looked at the boy, who was now pulling out that bloodied rag and applying it to the wound on his head again, when would it happen?
