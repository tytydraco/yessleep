I’m writing this because my college requires a full written statement to justify a room change—otherwise, I’ll be charged $3,000. That’s despite the fact that I’d be switching to a room that’s exactly the same as the one I have now. I’m not getting more space, amenities, or any real benefit—just the chance to live in peace. And yet, I’m the only one being inconvenienced, and somehow, I’m the one being punished. Writing this may not guarantee approval, but it sure beats paying $3,000. Still, there’s a possibility that whoever reads this from the housing board might deny my request. I just hope they can sympathize with what I’ve being enduring my first semester.

I met my roommate—who I’ll call “B” in this statement—on move-in day, like most people did. I remember vividly how I struggled carrying my mini-fridge up three flights of stairs, only able to move at a painfully slow pace because the guy ahead of me was walking like he had all the time in the world. That guy turned out to be B. So, our first interaction was me following him at a snail’s pace all the way to the end of the hallway, barely able to catch my breath. Not the ideal first impression when you realize that’s the person you’ll be living with for the next year.

Other than that, move-in went relatively smoothly. He chose the bed closest to the bathroom, and I took the one by the window, which overlooked the campus lake—a small win for me. Even though my arms were completely shot. By the end of that first day, I thought things would be cordial between us.

That turned out not to be the case.

The first issue? He eats like he’s in a speed-eating contest. It stresses me out just being in the same room when he eats. I know that’s not enough to request a new room, but it was an early red flag. His overall personality is also just off-putting. I know that sounds vague, but he does things that genuinely make me uncomfortable.

For example, one day I was on the phone with my parents, clearly mid-conversation with the phone still to my ear, and B tried to start a separate conversation with me—about the weather. Literally. He was talking about clouds and temperatures like I wasn’t clearly busy. I figured he might just be socially awkward and let it go.

But things kept getting worse.

Every time he enters the room, it’s like he’s sneaking in. He cracks the door open just a little and peeks through before slowly walking in. I asked him about it once, not wanting him to feel like he had to walk on eggshells around me. He got nervous, apologized, and said it was a habit he picked up from his ex-girlfriend. Whatever that means. I didn’t pry.

But then one night, things got genuinely creepy. I was getting out of the shower and noticed eyes peering through the door crack. When I stepped fully out, B was already in bed like nothing had happened. When I tried to ask him about it, he got tense. His face tightened, he started breathing heavily, and the noise escalated—he sounded like an agitated chimpanzee. I didn’t know whether he was angry or upset, but I felt immediately intimidated and just got into bed. I haven’t brought it up again.

The final straw has been his new nightly routine: taking showers in the middle of the night. It started about a month into the semester and hasn’t stopped since. I tried talking to him about it, but he just said he’s busy during the day and promised to be quieter. But that doesn’t help—the pipes are loud enough to wake me every time the water turns on or off. I’ve been losing sleep consistently.

Last night was worse.

At around 1:30 a.m., I woke up to the sound of the shower, standard by now and was able to got back to sleep, but when I got woken up a second time it was from a different noise. Not the pipes, but a dull, distant thud. It was quiet, but distinct enough to wake me up even over the running water. What was even weirder is that when I checked the clock, it was 4:15 a.m.—B had never showered for this long. I figured maybe he fell asleep in the shower, which is gross in any case, especially in a college guy’s bathroom, even if it was only shared between two people.

I knocked on the bathroom door—no response. I knocked louder, called out his name—still nothing. Starting to panic, thinking maybe he’d slipped and hit his head, I announced I was coming in. When I opened the door, all his stuff was still there—towels, soap, shampoo—but B was gone.

I turned off the water, checked the room. The door to the hallway was still locked, and his keys were on the desk. This morning, when I confronted him, he claimed he had fallen asleep in the shower and went straight to bed without grabbing his stuff or turning off the water. I know he’s lying to me. I checked—he wasn’t in bed.

I’m writing this now from the library because I’m genuinely scared to go back to my room. I hope this request is approved quickly, and that tonight will be my last night dealing with one of B’s midnight “showers” and whatever he is actually doing wherever he is during the night.

If the housing board needs more evidence or details, I have plenty more, and I’m ready to share whatever is needed. I just can’t stay in that room anymore.
