*“How’s it going out there, super sleuth?”* James shouted as I re-entered the cabin.

*“Capture some new footage for me to review? Any new phantoms?”* Bacon sizzled under his half-sarcastic remark like a round of applause from a tiny, invisible audience.

I forced the front door closed against a powerful gust of cold wind. Breakfast smelled divine. Magnetized by the heavenly scent, I wandered into the kitchen without taking off my boots, leaving a trail of fresh snow across the floor.

*“Nope. Nothing to report. Same two phantoms, same sequence of events at the same time of day, four days in a row. I don’t get it, I really don’t.”* I replied, dragging a chair out from the glass-topped table and plopping myself down, feeling a little defeated.

*“Thanks again for letting me use your camera, honey. Being out of work is making me a little stir-crazy. This has been a good time-killer, even if it's driving me up a fucking wall.”*

James chuckled. Then, he turned around, walked over to the table, and sat down opposite to me. I slid his handheld video camera across the glass. At the same time, he slid a hot plate of bacon and eggs towards me, food and technology nearly colliding as they passed each other.

His lips curled into a wry, playful smile. Clearly, my fiancé garnered a bit of sadistic enjoyment out of seeing me so wound up. He thought it was cute. I, on the other hand, did not find his reaction to my frustration *cute.* Even if I was unnecessarily exasperated over the lake and its puzzle, I didn't think it would kill him to meet me emotionally halfway and share in my frustration. He could spare the empathy.

I gave him the side eye as I thrust some scrambled eggs into my mouth. James saw my dismay and recalibrated.

*“Look, Kaya, I know what you found out there isn’t as cut and dry as developing code. But wasn’t that the point of taking a leave of absence? To give yourself some space out in the real world? Develop other passions? Self-realize? That job was making you miserable. It’s going to be there when you’re ready to go back, too. Just…I don’t know, enjoy the mystery? Stop looking at it like it’s a problem that needs to be fixed. This has no deadline, sweetheart. None that I'm aware of, at least.”*

He chuckled again and my expression softened. I felt my cheeks flush from embarrassment.

James was right. This phenomenon I accidentally discovered under the frozen surface of Lusa’s Tear, a lake two minutes away by foot, was an unprecedented paranormal marvel. It wasn’t some rebellious line of code that was refusing to bend to my will. I could stand to bask in the ambiguity of it all, accepting the possibility that I may never have a satisfying answer to the woman in the lake and her faceless killer.

I met his gaze, and a sigh billowed from my lips.

*“Hey - you’re right. Sorry for being so crotchety.”*

James winked, and that forced a grin out of me. Briefly, we focused on breakfast, enjoying the inherent serenity of his cabin, tucked away from town at the edge of the northern wilderness. The quiet was undeniably nice, though I couldn’t help but shatter it.

*“You have to admit it’s weird that I can’t find any records of a woman hanging herself.”* I proclaimed.

*“I mean,* ***we*** *know* ***she*** *didn’t hang herself. It looks like the killer lifts her into a noose on the recordings. But there’s no recorded deaths by hanging anywhere near Lusa’s Tear. Sure, the library’s records only go back so far, and if the death was ruled a suicide there might not even be records to find. I guess the murder could be really old, too…”*

*“Or! Mur-****ders****. Could be more than one.*” James interrupted, mouth still full of partially chewed egg, fragments spilling out as he spoke.

I tilted my head, perplexed.

*“What makes you say that?”*

He spun an empty fork in small circles over his chest as he finished chewing, like he was doing an impression of a loading spinner on a slow computer.

*“Well, I think you’re getting too fixated on your initial impression. Might be worth taking an honest look at your assumptions, you know? Maybe it’s more than one murder. Maybe it’s not related to the lake. If you’re not finding anything, maybe you should expand your search parameters.”*

I rocked back in my chair and considered his theory, letting breakfast settle as I thought.

*“Yeah, I guess. That would be one hell of a coincidence, though. The lake is named ‘Lusa’s Tear’, and it just happens to have some unrelated spectral woman being killed under the ice, reenacted at nine A.M. sharp every day? What are the odds?”*

He turned his head and peered out the kitchen window, beaming with a wistful smirk.

*“Maybe you’re right. Those are some crazy odds.”*

*- - - - -*

That all occurred the morning of Sunday, April the 6th.

By the following afternoon, for better or worse, I would have some answers.

\- - - - -

James and I met five months before we moved out to that cabin together. The whirlwind romance, dating to engaged in less than one hundred days, was completely unlike me. My life until that point had been algorithmic and protocolized. Everything by the book. James was the opposite: impulsive to a fault.

I think that’s what I found so attractive about him. You see, I’ve always despised messiness, both physical and emotional, and I had grown to assume order and predictability were the only tools to ward it off. James broke my understanding of that rule. Despite his devil-may-care approach to life, he wasn’t messy. He made spontaneity look elegant: a handsome ball of controlled chaos. It was likely just the illusion of control upheld by his unflappable charisma, but, at the time, his buoyancy seemed almost supernatural.

So, when he popped the question, I said yes. To hell with doing things by the book.

One thing led to another. Before long, I found myself moving out of the city, putting my life on hold to follow James and his career into the frigid countryside.

A few mornings after we arrived at the cabin, I discovered what I assumed was the spirit of a murdered woman under the ice.

\- - - - -

James headed off to work around seven. Naturally, I had already finished unpacking, while he had barely started. Without heaps of code to attend to, I was painfully restless. I needed a task. So, I took a crack at my soon-to-be husband’s boxes. I convinced myself it was the “*wife-ly*” thing to do. If I’m honest, though, I wasn’t too preoccupied with being a picturesque homemaker.

It was more that the clutter was giving me chest pains.

I was about a quarter of the way through his belongings when I found a vintage video camera at the bottom of one box. A handheld, black Samsung camcorder straight out of the late nineties. Time had weathered it terribly: its chassis was littered with scratches and small dents. The poor thing looked like it had taken a handful of spins in a blender.

To my pleasant surprise, though, it still worked.

Honestly, I don’t know exactly what about the camera was so entrancing: I could record a video with ten times the quality using my smartphone. And yet, the analog technology inspired me. I smiled, swiveling the camcorder around so my eyes could drink it in from every angle. Then, like it always does, the demands of reality came crashing back. Still had a lot of boxes to deal with.

I shrugged, letting my smile gradually deflate like a “*Happy Birthday!*” balloon three days after the party ended. I was about to store it in our bedroom closet when I felt something foreign flicker in my chest: a tiny spark of excitement. The landscape outside the cabin was breathtaking and worthy of being recorded. Messing around with the camcorder sounded like fun.

Of course, my automatic reaction was to suppress the frivolous idea: starve that spark of oxygen until it suffocated. It was an impulsive waste of time, and there were plenty more boxes to unpack. Thankfully, I suppressed my natural urge.

*Why not let that spark bloom a little?* I thought.

*That’s what James would do, right?*

An hour later, I’d find myself at the edge of Lusa’s Tear, pointing the camcorder at its frozen surface with a shaky hand, terror swelling within my gut.

With a naked eye, there was nothing to see: just a small body of water shaped like a teardrop.

But through the video camera, the ice seemed to tell an entirely different story.

\- - - - -

I tried to explain what I recorded to James when he arrived home that evening, but my words were tripping and stumbling over each as they exited my mouth like a group of drunken teenagers at Mardi Gras. Eventually, I just showed him the recording.

His reaction caught me off guard.

As he watched the playback on the camcorder’s tiny flip screen, the colored drained from face. His eyes widened and his lips trembled. Not to say that was an unreasonable reaction: the footage was shocking.

But, before that moment, I’d never seen his coolheaded exterior crack.

I had never seen James experience fear.

\- - - - -

It started with two human-shaped smudges materializing on the surface of the lake in the bottom right-hand corner of the frame. I was standing about ten feet from the lake's edge surveying the landscape when it caught my attention.

*Someone's under the ice,* my brain screamed.

I let the still recording camera fall to my side and ran over to help them. About ten seconds pass, which is the time it took for me to come to terms with the fact that I could only see said *trapped people* with the lens of the camera.

Then, I tilted the camera back up to get the phantasms in full view.

Even though the water was still, the silhouettes were hazy and wobbling, similar to the way a person’s reflection ripples in a river the second after throwing a stone in.

There was a woman slung over a man’s shoulder. She struggled against him, but the efforts appeared weak. He transported her across the ice, through some unseen space. Once they’re in position, he pulled her vertical and slipped her neck into a noose. You can’t see the noose itself, but its presence is implied by the way she clawed helplessly at her throat and the slight, pendulous swinging of her body once she became limp.

Then, the silhouettes dissolved. They silently swelled, expanding and diluting over the water like a drop of blood in the ocean until they were gone completely.

\- - - - -

When it was over, James looked different. Over the runtime, his fear had dissipated, similar to the blurry figures that had been painted on the surface of Lusa’s Tear in the video.

Instead, he was grinning, and his eyes were red and glassy like he might cry.

*“Oh my God, Kaya. That’s amazing,”* he whispered, his voice raw, his tone crackling with emotion.

\- - - - -

That should be enough backstory to explain what happened yesterday.

It was about a week and a half after I first recorded the macabre scene taking place at Lusa’s Tear every morning. There hadn’t been any significant developments in my amateur investigation, other than determining that the phenomena seemed to only occur at nine o’clock (which involved me missing the reenactment for a few days until I referenced the timestamp on the original recording). Other than that, though, I found myself no closer to unearthing any secrets.

I was in the kitchen getting ready to head over to the lake. James had already left, but he’d forgotten his laptop on the table, same as he had the past Thursday and Friday. He said he needed it for work but had somehow left the damn thing behind three days in a row.

When I checked the camcorder to ensure it was operational, I found the side screen’s battery was blinking red and empty, which was baffling because it had been charging in the living room for the hour prior. Originally, I was astounded by the stroke of bad luck. But now, I know it wasn’t actually bad luck, and I couldn’t be more grateful.

That camcorder’s newly compromised battery was the closest thing to divine intervention I think I’ll ever experience in my lifetime.

I rushed over to the sink, plugging the camcorder into an outlet aside the toaster oven, hoping I could siphon enough charge to power the device before I missed my opportunity to record the phantoms. Minutes passed as I stared at the battery icon, but it didn't blink past red. At 8:57, I pocketed the device and started pacing out the door towards the lake, but the machine went black about thirty seconds later.

A massive, frustrated gasp spilled from my lips, and I felt myself giving up.

*I'll try again tomorrow, I guess. Nothing’s been changing from day to day, anyway. No big loss.*

I trudged back over to the outlet near the sink, moving the charger to the lower of the two outlets and plugging the camcorder back in. I held it in my hands as it powered on again. When the side-screen lit up, I immediately saw something that caught my eye. There was a subtle flash of movement in the periphery, where a few pots and pans were being left to soak, half-submerged in sudsy water.

My heart began to race, ricocheting violently against the inside of my chest. Cold sweat dripped down my temples. My mind flew into overdrive, attempting to digest the implications of what I was witnessing.

I ripped the camcorder from the wall and sprinted to the upstairs bathroom, not sure if I even *wanted* to reproduce what I just saw. Insanity seemed preferable to the alternative.

But as the bathtub filled with water, there they were again. She had just finished struggling. He was watching her swing. Before the camcorder powered off, I pulled it away from the bathtub and saw the same thing in the mirror, too.

You could witness the phantoms in any reflection, apparently. Which meant James was right. There wasn’t anything special about Lusa’s Tear.

The common denominator was the camera.

*His* camera.

\- - - - -

Honestly, as much as the notion makes my skin crawl, I think he wanted me to find out.

Why else would he leave his laptop out so conspicuously? I know computers better than I know people. He must have been aware I could find them hidden in his hard drive once I knew to look, no matter how encrypted.

James looked so young in the recordings.

God, and the women looked so sick: gaunt, colorless, almost skeletal.

Every video was the same. At first, there would just be a noose, alone in what appears to be an unfinished basement. The room had rough, concrete walls, as well as a single window positioned where the ceiling met the wall in the background. Without fail, natural light would be spilling through the glass.

Whatever this ritual was, it was important to James that it started at nine A.M. sharp.

Then, he’d lumber into the frame, a woman slung over shoulder, on his way to deliver them to the ominous knot. I don’t feel compelled to reiterate the rest, other than what he was doing.

He wasn’t watching them like I thought.

No, James was loudly weeping through closed eyes while they died, kissing a framed photo and pleading for forgiveness, mumbling the same thing over and over again until the victim mercifully stilled.

*“Lilith…I’m sorry…I’m sorry Lilith…”*

It’s hard to see the woman in the photo. But from what I could tell, they kind of looked like James. A mother, sister, or daughter, maybe.

What’s worse, the woman in the picture bore a resemblance to his victims, as well as me.

Sixteen snuff films, all nearly identical. Assumably, each one was filmed on that camcorder, too, but the only proof I have to substantiate that claim is the recordings I captured at Lusa’s Tear.

Only watched half of one before I sprinted out of the cabin, speeding away in my sedan without a second thought, laptop and camcorder in tow.

I don’t have any definitive answers, obviously, but it seems to me that James unintentionally imprinted his acts onto the camera itself, like some kind of curse. My theory is that, through a combination of perfect repetition and unmitigated horror, he accidentally etched the scene onto the lens. Over time, it became an outline he traced over and reinforced with each additional victim until it became perceptible.

And I suppose I was the first to stumble upon it, because it sure seemed like he’d never noticed the imprint before. That said, I don't have an explanation as to *why* it only appeared over reflective surfaces.

I mean, there's a certain poetry to that fact, but the world doesn't organize itself for the sake of poetry alone. Not to my understanding, at least.

But maybe it’s high time I reconsider my understanding of the universe, and where I’d like myself to fit within it.

\- - - - -

I just got off the phone with the lead detective on the case. James hasn’t returned to the cabin yet, but the police are staking it out. The manhunt is intensifying by the minute, as well.

That said, have any of you ever even heard of “*The Gulf Coast Hangman*”?

Apparently, coastal Florida was terrorized by a still uncaught serial killer in the late nineties, and their M.O. earned them that monicker. Woman would go missing, only to reappear strung up in the Everglades months later. They had been starved before they were hung, withered till they were only skin and bone. As of typing this, the killer has been inactive for nearly two decades. The last discovered victim attributed to *“The Hangman”* was found in early 2005.

As it turns out, James never accepted a position at a local water refinery. When the police called, management had never heard of anyone that goes by his full name. God knows what he had been doing from seven to five. To my absolute horror, the lead detective believes he may have been potentially starving a new victim nearby, since a thirty-one-year-old woman was reported missing three days after we arrived at the cabin.

I’m staying with my parents until I feel it’s safe, two hundred miles away from where “*The Hangman*” and I first met. Although the physical distance from him is helping, I find it impossible to escape him in my mind. For the time being, at least.

Why did he let me live?

Was his plan to eventually starve and hang me as well?

Does he want to be caught?
