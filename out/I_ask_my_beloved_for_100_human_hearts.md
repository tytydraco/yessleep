It is not an easy task to deliver a hundred human hearts, and I know that it is grisly work. The ones that come to me are beautiful, drained of blood, and presented in boxes of fine cedar, sometimes on purple satin pillows.

Because I must consume a heart each day, it is necessary for me to keep many suitors at once. Better to eat too many hearts than risk a day without. Some days, half a dozen boxes litter my doorstep, each bearing a different signature.

I tell the men that whoever can deliver a hundred hearts can have me forever. But no one has yet to deliver even eighty. Enough centuries have now passed that I see the prize as an illusion. I have become convinced that my worthy mate will never come.

At night, I sing sweetly from the high window of my home, a song inaudible to all but a few. But those who hear it can imagine the sweetness of my body and all of the promises awaiting them.

Last week, I went from three suitors to one. On subsequent nights, one suitor killed both his rivals, gifting me their hearts. Though such competitiveness generally does not serve my interest, the maid in me blushed at his jealousy. These were his ninety-fourth and ninety-fifth offerings.

When I consume the hearts, I taste the moment of each death. Stabbed, shot, choked, dropped, bludgeoned, poisoned, gouged. There is no flavor I tire of. 

As the weeks go on, I imagine each suitor, hunting for me. They are young and old, fat and thin and strong. A few new suitors begin their offerings, leaving the hearts of the enfeebled and elderly on simple beds of straw. I choke down these offerings, but I do not like it. At night, I sing to these men that they are unworthy. 

Then today, a ninety-ninth box sits on my doorstep. It contains the heart of a giant, a man at least seven feet tall. It is a message: the largest heart I’ve ever consumed. The heart takes ages to cook, and as it sizzles, I imagine my suitor. Is he a giant too, to be capable of killing this prey?

All night, I lay awake, wondering if the hundredth heart will come. Will it finally happen, or like so many others will he end up on the wrong end of a hangman’s rope? Will he go for easy prey–a nightwalker or a child? Or will he top even the giant’s heart, presenting some impossible gift?

In the morning, I wake to find a man–a boy really, no older than eighteen. He is cold and lifeless on my doorstep, a dagger protruding from his chest, a self-inflicted wound, and I know in my own dark heart that he is my beloved. The hundredth heart is his.

I take him inside and shower his body with kisses. Then I get my own knife and begin to carve. His blood stains my hands, my white dress, my sharpened teeth as I cry tears of joy.

For what is love but doing the dirty work yourself?
