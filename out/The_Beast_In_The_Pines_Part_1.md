My mom and dad were born and raised in Clarence, an old small town in the countryside between the midlands and the coast. A flat woodland, lush from its snaking rivers and creeks. Its swamps bled into the marshes and down through the deltas into the salty southern coast that was a little over an hour away. Clarence was the little nothing-town people passed when they drove down to the beach for vacation. 

My grandparents, Nanny and Papa, owned a pine tree farm in Clarence. 100 acres, and 75 of those acres were rows upon rows of loblolly pine trees. They lived on the property in a small farmhouse at the end of a long dirt driveway. It was small, and while it may have been nearly prehistoric, it never felt creepy. It felt like a cozy respite, a home away from home; sitting like an island in the middle of a large yard dotted with gnarled towering oak, walnut, and pecan trees. There were rickety barns as old as the dirt they sat on. Sprawling garden beds with herbs, flowers and vegetables. Wooden arbors overgrown with pluming heaps of muscadine grape vines. All acting as a buffer for the pine rows that surrounded the house on three sides. 

The remaining 20-or-so acres behind the pine rows were dense woods, cut down the middle by a winding trail that lead to the river. Nanny and Papa had clear-cut those 75 acres and planted the pines about 10 years prior. Papa passed away when I was small, and Nanny wasn’t far behind him, passing a few years later.

We inherited their cherished little farmhouse and pine tree farm.

We couldn’t live at the farm, of course. My Dad already had a job, and nobody gets a weekly paycheck to watch pine trees grow. So while adding the upkeep of a farm would be a heavy burden on top of a 9-5 work week, it was a labor of love that my parents were used to. Before Nanny passed, we would come down to Clarence to visit her every other weekend, giving her a hand with house work and yard work- especially as she got older. In the spring and summer it was more like every weekend, a constant battle for my Dad to keep the vegetation from taking over.

Despite how exhausting it sounded, my busy-body parents enjoyed it. The farm was a way of staying near their family and friends, all while enjoying the rural lifestyle of their hometown again. Getting themselves and their only daughter away from the buzz of suburbia.

At the time of this story, the pines were somewhere between 12-15ft tall. Nanny had passed away in October and we didn’t return until spring that next year. It was the mid 90s, and I was 8 years old. 

We left home that March on a Friday afternoon and head down the interstate towards Clarence and our pine tree farm, a routine that we knew well. It was a 45 or-so minute drive, and once we pulled into town and got situated, Dad would stay at the house and start on yard-work. Mom and I would go to the grocery store, getting enough food to last us until we left Sunday afternoon.

The only grocery store in Clarence was the old Piggly Wiggly. I distinctly remember the sweet wrinkled smiles of its employees and the smell of cigarettes that hung in the air. 

Mom and I stood in the checkout line.

“Oh shi- shoot! Oh shoot! Honey I forgot the bread, can you run and grab one for me real quick?”

I gave her a chirpy “yes ma’am” and moved swiftly towards the bread aisle. I skirted to a stop when I realized there was a small display right there by checkout. A table laid out with checkerboard table cloth, loaves carefully placed in circular tiers. I snatched up a loaf, brought it to my mom and we headed home. 

We drove back to the farmhouse in my Mom’s station wagon, a new single by Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers was on the radio. Anticipation began to build as I stared eagerly out the window, in childish awe of the countryside’s vast emerging greenery.

We turned off of the road, patches of field on either side of the long dirt driveway leading up to the farmhouse, which sat at the end like a lady. A sweet, modest, classy thing, built in 1903. She was stark white, laced with gingerbread trim. Full, blossoming azalea bushes hemmed the wide front porch like a skirt, all of her topped off with an evergreen tin roof that sang me to sleep in the rain.

My mom backed her station wagon up to the front porch and I helped her as we began to take in groceries. 

We heard him coming before we saw him. A humming engine sang over a chorus of baying hounds. 

It was Mr. Voss, our neighbor. His hunting beagles running spiritedly behind his ATV, a howling snarling cloud of dust tearing down the road before turning into our driveway.

My Dad pulled up beside us in his creaky old brown work truck, that I had affectionately named “Bear,” when I was small. Because it was brown, and it growled. 

Dad hopped out. He ruffled my hair, and gave my mom a kiss on the cheek.

“Hey squirt. Hey honey, Dan called- said we needed to talk.”

“Everything okay?”

“I guess we’ll find out. Hope so. Need any help with those groceries?”

“No, no, I’ve got my sidekick here helping me, you invite Dan inside and I’ll bring you boys something to drink.”

Dad gave me a wink and a pat on the back before he walked up to greet Mr. Voss who had pulled up and cut the power on his ATV, his dogs gallivanting off to play and sniff around. My dad always looked so big and strong to me, but next to Mr Voss he looked small. I heard the frame creak as he dismounted his machine. 

Daniel Voss was Clarence’s nearly retired fire chief, and when he wasn’t in uniform he was in camo. He shook Dad’s hand with a pursed smile under his mustache, and nodded towards my mother and me.

“Mrs Willis, little Miss Willis,” 

He directed his attention back to my dad. “Thanks for letting me stop by, Peter.”

“Hey, no problem man. Everything alright? You sounded serious over the phone.”

My mom took the last bag of groceries and shooed me off to play. I was old enough to understand that the adults were talking and I needed to scadaddle. However, I was also a talented eavesdropper, as most children are. I ran along the side of the house, sneaking in through the back door. I found a nice hiding spot behind a small wooden bench in the hallway. There was a mirror on the wall, giving me a peak into the living room where Dad knelt striking a match in the fireplace, while Mr. Voss made comments about the weather and the sitting president. 

After Mom had put away the groceries she joined them with a handful of empty glasses. She grabbed a bottle of whisky from the top of the china cabinet and poured them all a shot of the syrupy golden spirit. Mr Voss sat in the tattered plaid wingback by the fireplace, a small modest flame beginning to crackle in its hearth. He laced and re-laced his fingers, as if he was somewhat apprehensive to begin the conversation until suddenly he cleared his throat.

“So Peter, Lori, I know y’all just rolled into town, but I had to fill you folks in on what’s been going on around here lately. It’s a matter of safety, especially with yer little youngin’ running around.”

I always thought it was such a shame that Mr Voss chewed tobacco all the time. Not only because I thought spitting dip was gross, but because it prevented him from speaking as much. Mr Voss sounded like the lowest string on a fiddle, his vocal chords oiled with old southern blood. A lullaby with seamless rises and dips in cadence, every sentence a resonant stanza in a ballad. He would recall a trip to the post office to the tune of an old campfire story. 

That early evening in March, as dusk and its chill fell upon the treetops of Clarence and the sun sank low in a peach colored sky, I noticed that Mr Voss’ speech was unobscured by his usual lip full of dip. 

I settled into my hiding spot. This must be serious. Mr Voss was about to spin a yarn.

“So, all of this started in late November, best we can all surmise. Rumors began floating around right after Thanksgiving. Late November, 'ya know, 'ya had boys out there on their land or their buddy’s land hunting deer and ducks, doves and geese. Fat and happy in their camo, believe me I was one of ‘em. But a few of ‘em made some grizzly discoveries. They, uh, found some animal carcasses while they were huntin’.” 

The puzzled looks on my parents faces were suddenly imbued with concern. Mr Voss took a sip of his whisky and continued, 

“As I’m sure you both know, eastwards, right yander across the river from your property is Ed Kerry’s huntin’ land. He’s got about 50 acres or thereabouts. Well, Kerry and his boys were huntin’ in the wee hours of the morning, planning on shacking up in a little hunting stand near a clearing in the center of the property. Once they got up there and started lookin’ around, they found a buck-”

His voice cracked for a moment as his eyes flickered between Mom and Dad. 

“-a *mutilated* buck… At first, they thought it was a pack of coyotes, maybe a bobcat. But the more they saw, the harder it was to rationalize in their minds. Now Peter, Lori, I don’t mean to be graphic, but I think it’s important that you know the details.” 

He paused, waiting for one of them to stop him, but neither did. 

“It was fresh. The neck was broken, violently. It had been ‘eviscerated’ as one of Kerry’s boys put it. Ed said it was a mess, carnage just- everywhere. Something had taken a bite through its leg at the haunches, cracked right through the bones, and crushed the socket when it ripped it out. Ed said the bite was this big,”

He gestured, but from outside of my peeping-mirror’s view.

My Dad exhaled in disbelief.

My mom winced, a pained look on her face.

“My God, Dan.”

“By December’s end they had found that buck, and a few more animals torn up to a similar degree. The week before Christmas, I was in the field near the border of your property, and I saw a lump of fur layin' off yander in the field. I was worried it was one of my beagles. But once I got up close to it I saw it was a coyote. There were these deep gashes, from the tips of the ribs on one side to the tips of the ribs on the other. I could see the oval shape of the bite mark, it had a set of jaws- I mean a *big* set jaws, like Ed had said. Must’ve just held its ribcage in its mouth and bitten down on it.”

 Mr Voss paused, lost in thought for a moment.

“Peter I’ve never seen anything like it. It was a nightmare, I’m just glad the wife didn’t stumble on it.”

Mr Voss downed what was left of his whisky. I heard the clink of his glass as he sat it on coffee table. 

“Then, about 2 weeks later David Kilpatrick and his daughter were out huntin’ on Kerry’s land. 'Ya know Kerry’s boy, Joey, been sweet on her for a while, so Kerry lets Dave take her out there huntin’. Give Joey something to bond with her over and all that. Well, the little lady bags her a doe, so her and Dave head over to it, trudging through all the brush and fallen leaves and what have 'ya to tag it. As they’re walking over, girl goes to hop over this recently fallen sweet gum tree. That poor child landed in a dead buck’s corpse. It was almost all skeleton, but fallin into a leathery cracked-open rib cage shakes her up pretty good. Dave said that its head was all gnawed up with big ol’ teeth marks, and the antlers were crunched. Now I don’t know about you but I’ve never heard of a bite that’d crunch antlers on a deer like that.”

My dad shook his head, staring off in a daze. “No, never.”

“Well, then Neal found another coyote, said it looked just like the one on my property. But who knows, it could’ve been skinned alive and split in half and Neal wouldn’t mention it. You know Neal, you could tie him to the railroad tracks and he’d barely mumble about it. Last thing I’d heard was a week ago when Bill found a doe. He was near the border of your property, said he’d been fixing a fence post earlier that day and left his pack of smokes out there. So he hopped in his truck in his pajamas that night and went back to fetch 'em. The same fence post he’d fixed was broken again, and not 10 feet from it was a doe. She’d been ripped apart at the rib cage. Bill said it looked like a damn frog dissection from high school.”

All of them were silent for a long moment, the only sound the crackling in the fireplace.

Dad spoke up, “What is everybody thinking? A bear?”

I heard Mr Voss sniff, as he nodded. “Bear. Maybe a big wolf.”

“I’ve heard of bear wandering down this far south occasionally, but a wolf? I don’t know…”

Mr Voss inclined his hand toward the the whisky bottle on the table, Dad encouraged him to help himself, so Mr Voss poured everyone another finger.

“A bear, a wolf, whatever it is- it’s a devil. The damage it does is just- gruesome.” 

“Nobody's found any tracks?”

“Not in the leaves. You know how it is this time of year. You’re practically wading through ‘em.”

Mr Voss sighed as he fiddled with the glass, so small in his hands.

“But I wanted to catch you as soon as you arrived, Peter, and I know I don’t need to spell this out for you, yer a smart fella. But we’re finding bodies north, south, east and west of here, and l’m not trying to alarm you folks but- I think you know as well as I do that you might have some dead animals on your property.”

At that I decided to make my exit, sneaking away from my hiding spot. I figured I would need to be in position when Mom or Dad came to tell me about my inevitable new ground rules. 

I ran off to the squatty structure near the back of the house, what my Nanny had called “The Kitty Cat Barn.” It was a dilapidated flat-roof barn, enlaced with morning glories that crawled through the rusted rotting holes in its ancient metal siding. It seems to have once been a small barn for a couple of work animals like donkeys or small horses, but Papa had put shelves up and Nanny just used it to store her preserves. However as she and Papa got older, they garnered a large collection of stray cats, as the sweet and elderly have a habit of doing. So near the end of their life, they gave away all their preserves to their kids and their friends from church and stocked the shelves instead with baskets and boxes, lined with soft old towels and worn rags. Setting out a couple dozen of little bowls for them to eat from. When we weren’t there, one of our neighbors, Mrs. Kerry, gladly came out and fed them for us in exchange for herbs from the garden, though she rarely ever took any. 

I squatted on the dirt floor of the barn. It wasn’t long before a handful of kittens clumsily wandered out to investigate my presence. Moments later, what I assumed was their mother, came over and began nuzzling up against me. I rubbed gently behind her velvety ears before walking out of the barn. I made sounds gesturing for the kittens to come out into the grass to play, but their mood shifted and they would not come. They only stood in the doorway beside their mother, watching me. I scoffed. *Cats*.

Not a moment later, Mom came over, asking if we could talk. We sat on one of the steps of the back door stoop. She gave me a frank but watered down version of Mr. Voss’s story, then laid down the law. 

 “No playing in the pine rows, and no going outside for any reason after sunset. If you see something, anything, out of the ordinary- come tell myself or your father, immediately. Are we clear?”

“Yes ma’am.”

She asked if knew what to do if I was approached by a bear or a wolf, and I prattled off the steps to her. Don’t run. Back away slowly. If it approaches you, try to make yourself look big. All that. I can tell this relaxed her a bit, and she told me to have fun playing, and to be careful. 

The rest of the day was as pleasant as any day when you were 8. I ran aimlessly all over the yard, not much different from Mr Voss’s beagles. I stopped by the arbor to pick muscadine grapes. I helped Mom do some work in the flower beds, and before I knew it it was time to come inside. She threw a Disney movie into the small tube television in my room while she worked in the kitchen. Dad came in and washed up from doing yard work all day, the farmhouse’s old pipes groaning as he showered. We had dinner that night, I can’t recall what it was, but it was warm and I went back for seconds. After Dad and I cleaned the kitchen for Mom, we all sat at on the floor of the living room, playing Old Maid and talking by the fire. As the evening drew to a close, we all started getting ready for bed. 

That was the first night I saw the beast.

I remember it well. 

After I had given Dad a kiss and told him goodnight, Mom tucked me into bed under the fresh linens she had put on earlier that afternoon. She kissed my head reminding me to say my prayers before turning off the lights and closing the door, bidding me goodnight. 

Prayers said, I waited for sleep to overcome me but it never did. I tossed and turned for a while, before quietly sliding out of bed and slinking over to my window. The cats would always come out at night, and the view from outside of my bedroom window happened to be a particularly high traffic cat crossing. 

There were bushes beneath my window, and looking past them you could see paths that wound between and around garden beds brimming with various flowers and herbs. Behind them was the smallest of the barns that adorned the yard, Nanny had used it for storing gardening equipment and potting soil. It may have been geriatric, but it was a sturdy structure. It had survived an oak falling on it a couple years before and still stood tall. Behind it was a small stretch of field, and then the sea of pine rows.

I peered out of the antique, single pane glass. Keeping my breaths shallow as to not fog it up. I searched the shadows for cats, when my eye caught something in the distance. Deer occasionally appeared during these midnight matinees, strolling in the field or leaping through the pine rows. 

But this shape wasn’t moving like that.

The more I focused in on it, the more I saw that it was larger than I had thought. Larger than a deer. My sleepy brain began to dial in, seemingly aware that this was something outside of our routine viewing. I concentrated on the shape, holding my breath so as to ease my face as close to the glass as possible.

It prowled beneath the branches, its spine arched, its limbs creeping like a spider. Slow, deliberate movements, its ashen form lurked in the dark obscurity of the pine rows. It horrified me to think that if I hadn’t been deliberately looking at it, I could have cast a glance out the window and not even noticed it. 

Being that I was child, I did what any child might do. In my horror, I hyperventilated and broke into tears. I went running into my parents’ room. Desperate and pitiful, trying to explain to them what I saw. Mom was quick to fall into her maternal instincts, holding me close, wiping away my tears and stroking my hair. My Dad rubbed my back to comfort me, but his mind had gone back to the discussion with Mr Voss. 

“Did you see its face honey? Did it look like a bear?”

I quickly shook my head, eyes still wet with tears. 

“No- no it wasn’t a bear. It was too… too tall and long. A- a bear would be… less- gangly. This wasn’t. And it didn’t have any fur. It was-”

The more I thought back on the beast the more scared I became, all over again, until I burst into tears. I buried my face into my mother’s shoulder.

“It was so awful,” I sobbed, 

“I just want it to never come back.” 

My parents exchanged sympathetic looks. I slept in bed with them that night.



The next day was business as usual. In the morning after breakfast I helped Mom with some chores and then was released into the yard to play. I rode my bike up and down the dirt driveway while I listened to my Walkman. Mom watched me from the front porch while she mended some of Dad’s overalls. After a while she called me to help her again in the garden. We watered and weeded until it was time for lunch. Mom made grilled cheese and tomato soup. Dad came in, just having finished weed-eating, so he was a little dirty and peppered with blades of grass. We talked and ate and joked around. It wasn’t until Mom and I were doing the dishes that I noticed that Dad had vanished.

“Where’s Dad?” I asked, a little incredulously, at the absence of my dishwashing partner.

Mom’s eyes never left her work as she spoke, 

“He’s meeting Mr Voss.”

“Why?”

“Just to check out the Pine Rows”

She said nonchalantly. I didn’t press her about it, I knew they were out searching for dead animals.

Dad didn’t return until it was nearly dinner time. He didn’t say hey, he didn’t go to the kitchen for something to drink, he went straight to the shower. I could hear the pipes from my bedroom. During dinner, Dad seemed tired, but he put on a tired smile, asking me about my day and what all Mom and I had been up to. I had a feeling he didn’t want me to ask about his day, so I blabbed about everything Mom and I had done, how the cats were acting, and the songs I listened to on my Walkman. After we ate, I asked if I could go watch a movie in my room until lights out. My parents eagerly obliged. 

I sat cross legged on my bed, pretending to watch the Black Cauldron, I saw Dad pass my bedroom door. I tiptoed over, peaking my head out, watching him make his way wearily through the house and out to the front porch. I heard the pipes creak and knew Mom would be joining him shortly. 

Sensing an interesting conversation on the horizon, I took up a hiding spot near a coat rack by the front door, with a great view out the window and onto the front porch. I watched as Dad fell back into a rocking chair, exhausted. He packed and lit his briar pipe. The sky bore pearly hues of blush and lilac as it laid the day to rest. Dad leaned back, the embers in his pipe akin to the glow of the sunset as he took a long deep pull, exhaling a swirling plume of smoke.

I ducked down as Mom walked by. Her skin still rosey from her hot shower. Her hair was thrown up in a bun, and all her makeup was off. But she was more beautiful than the dusk sky, and Dad’s eyes corroborated my opinion. 

She met his gaze with a gentle smile, joining him in an adjacent rocking chair with a glass of wine in one hand and a beer in another. 

“I saw your bloody jeans in the hamper. I assume you had a 'work boots' kind of day.” She said with a weak laugh.

Dad scoffed. Mom always teased him for wearing the same pair of very-off-white New Balances all the time. She used to make comments to me on the days she saw them sitting by the back door, saying that he must be out doing dirty work. 

“You and Dan found an animal out there today?”

“Multiple.” Dad replied, his pipe hanging from the corner of his mouth as he cracked open his beer. 

“Two deer, a coyote, and a bobcat. We buried one of the deer and the bobcat. The rest of them were decayed enough or out of the way enough that we said ‘to hell with it.’”

Mom pensively said nothing.

“Dan called his game warden buddy, kind of a jack-ass, in my opinion. He told us to get photographic evidence. So Dan snapped some photos, said he’s gonna get ‘em developed tomorrow afternoon.”

The were a few lingering moments of silence until Mom spoke, asking softly,  

“What had happened to them?”

I heard Dad’s pipe clack between his teeth after taking another pull. By then the woody aroma had drifted into the house from under the front door. The smell of his tobacco was earthy, rich and sweet. He paused, taking a swig of his beer before answering. 

“A few of the deer seemed to have recently rotted down to their skeletons. Lots of their bones were broken, so we couldn’t quite put together what had happened to them; and ya’ know the vultures had probably gotten to ‘em and moved stuff around too. The coyote carcass was maybe a month old, it looked something had put a bunch of weight down on its ribs and crushed it. The bobcat-“

Dad stopped for a moment, as if remembering in awe.

“The bobcat was fresh Lori, real fresh. Past 24 hours fresh.”

“Oh my God, Peter.”

“It was a big one too. We found it at the base of a black walnut tree. It looked like it’s spine had been snapped against the trunk, and then something just-“ dad gestured with his hands, digging at the air. Sparing the gory details.

“All the blood on my clothes was from the Bobcat.”

“Well, thank God we didn’t let Amy play in the pine rows yesterday, how far was it from the house?”

“It was near the back of the rows, towards the woods. After we found and buried it we decided to call it quits for the day, but we’ll finish tomorrow, Dan said he’d help me.”

“Finish?”

“Yeah, we only got halfway around the pines, Lori. We still have to look around the other half tomorrow.”

The quiet returned for a few moments. Hanging in the air with the smoke from Dad’s pipe.

“Lori, don’t let Amy out of your sight.” I saw Mom nodding her head.

“I’m gonna keep the Benelli by the back door, it’s the semi-automatic, I remember you said you felt comfortable with that one. And I’m gonna keep the thirty-thirty, the Marlin, by the front door. I doubt it would just come up to the house in broad daylight, but I want you to be prepared in case I’m not here at the house with you.”

“That’s a good idea. And I think when Amy plays outside I need to tell her to stay in view of the windows. So you or I can see her.”

“Okay, good thinking. And we’ll need to ask her not to have her Walkman on her ears while she’s out there. I don’t want something sneaking up on her.”

Mom scoffed, “She’s not gonna like that.”

“Nah, she’s smart. If we explain it to her I’m sure she’ll understand.”

I didn’t like that. 

But I knew as well as they did that I would, in all likelihood, comply. Mom and Dad were reasonable, so I usually did.

“I know this is all scary for her- shit, it’s scary for all of us.”

“What the hell do you think this thing is Peter?”

 Dad let out a long exasperated sigh, as though he’d been asking himself that very thing all day. “The best thing I can figure is a bear. A very, very large bear. But who knows, I mean, we looked, but we didn’t see any tracks or scat or anything.”

“There were no tracks near the path? Even near the bobcat?”

Dad shook his head, “Too many pine needles. I mean years and years worth. We saw indentions in the earth under them, but nothing we could decipher.”

Dad finished his beer, setting it down on the ground by his rocking chair.

“Tomorrow, Dan’s gonna help me check the second half of the pine rows. He said one day next week he could send his nephews out on their four wheelers to check the woods that back up to the river.”

“Oh gosh is that safe?”

“It’s been a few years but those little rascals are grown, they’re young men now, they’re almost as tall as Dan.”

Mom hummed, not convinced, but opting to move on. “That’s nice of Dan to help you.”

“Yeah, he didn’t ask for anything but I told him I’d throw him and his nephews some cash for the help. I wish I could say I was hopeful, but I worry what those boys might find out there.”

I heard one of their rocking chairs creak as they moved to stand up, so I quietly scurried back off to my room. My parents didn’t bring it up to me that night or ever, didn’t say anything about it at all. Likely fearful that I would have another “nightmare.”



The last day, Sunday afternoon, Mom and I did the laundry and packed our things. The packing didn’t take long. We left most of our stuff behind, seeing that we would be back next weekend. Once I had my little red and white polka dot duffle bag tucked in the trunk of her station wagon Mom told me I could play until we left in a couple of hours. I climbed my favorite tree, an oak near the back door that Dad had nailed wooden steps onto. Mom sat outside with me, folding laundry. I finished my Goosebumps book, so I examined my pockets and discovered a long screw. Lord know where I’d found it or why I’d picked it up but I decided it was time to carve my initials into a tree. 

Mom and I both heard the phone in the house ring, so she hopped up to get it. Probably Aunt Cheryl. She had been meaning to stop by that weekend but Mom had told her it wasn’t a great time. While carving an “A” from way up in the tree I saw Dad coming over from the shop barn. It was the largest of the barns, and Papa had used it as a workshop. From the shade of the enormous oak beside the barn, it looked like Dad had grabbed a rag, using it to wipe something on his shirt. As he stepped out into the light I could see that it was blood. Red, fresh.

Dad didn’t see me in the tree, so he didn't put on any heirs. He pulled his baseball cap off and wiped the sweat on his forehead with his arm. For a busy-body who normally took such long purposeful strides, his steps were slow. Heavy. His face was so white. His eyes were locked onto the ground in front of him as he walked. My dad looked scared. 

Mom tried to covertly put his dirty clothes in a bag while Dad showered and got changed. I didn’t say anything. Dad didn’t know I’d seen him, and Mom thought I was none the wiser. We turned off all the lights, locked all the doors, and then hit the road for home. Looking out my window at the lush greenery of the countryside that had so enamored me only days before, I couldn’t help but think now that it only acted as a shroud, a living, flowering veil that hid the beast lurking within. 



Back at home in the sardine can of suburbia, any moment absent of conscious thought was overcome with visions of the beast. If I had been any older, it would have been an easy write off, *“its just a nightmare,” “you’re crazy,” “go see a psychologist;”* but I wasn’t. I was an 8 year old little girl who read mythology encyclopedias and fairy tale compendiums like I was going for a PhD. I actively side stepped mushroom rings for fear of being kidnapped by the fae. A small piece of every Little Debbie cake I got was left near the crawl space door in case we had hobgoblins or brownies living under our house (which at the time, I seriously suspected we did).

My parents, the logic-bound adults could chock it all up to a subconscious presentation of a fear response, but I didn’t want to lie to myself.

I knew what I saw. 

As harrowing as it was, I kept mulling it over in my mind. Turning it over, rotating it at different angles, all in hopes of better understanding what it really was- the devil outside my bedroom window. If I was acting spacey, my friends at school didn’t say anything, at least not to my face. In the hallway, at lunch, at P.E. It possessed my every thought. 

The list of things I didn’t know about it was infinite, so I started with what I did know about it. 

It was large. Tall. I tried to think of it in comparison to the pines, and in doing so I stumbled upon a memory. It was a year before Nanny died, I was small, but not small enough to forget. It was the last time she was able to walk the pine rows with me. Her hair was as white as her sweet little farmhouse, and her bones burled and bent with age. Her voice was as gentle as the rustle in the pine needles. She said that because the pines were all planted so close together, the lowest of the branches wouldn’t get enough sunlight. As a result, they would drop off while the higher branches would reach upwards to take in more sunlight. I remember her smiling, as if that fact meant something to her.

She said that Papa had measured, and most of the branches in the pine rows were 5-7 feet from the ground. 

With that information at my disposal. I did some guesswork, but my safe guess was that it had been at least 4 feet, or probably more like 5 feet tall, on all fours.

It’s torso and appendages were lean. Not stocky, like a bear’s. Bears weren’t built that way. Why was I still thinking about bears? It definitely wasn’t a bear. What features I did see resembled a wolf, but wolves weren’t that large, that hairless, or that lanky. Neither were bears. My head began to throb. Whatever small annoying part of my brain *had* started developing was trying desperately to compare it to what I knew to be real. Thankfully the rest of my mind was fantastical and thought mermaids existed, so instead of having a psychological breakdown like an adult, I came to grips with the fact that this beast was a wolf-like and in all likelihood a werewolf. But I needed to do some research.  

That day after school, I asked Mom to take me to the library, a request she was used to. On the car ride there, she asked me what kind of book I was going to look for. So I explained my werewolf theory to her. A decision I immediately regretted when I saw the pity and concern within her eyes in the rear view mirror. 

“Honey, I know we’ve talked about all of this with the fairies and the mermaids and the unicorns, but werewolves aren’t real honey. I love that you have such a vivid imagination, but you’ve got to be realistic. I mean, sure, it might have been that bear or wolf out in the woods, but it was probably just a nightmare-“

“It couldn’t be a nightmare, I was at the window, and I know what I saw! It wasn’t normal looking- It didn’t look like a bear or a wolf, it was something else. I’m 100% sure that I saw what I saw! Mom, I swear- I swear I’m not lying.”

I saw the pained deliberation in her eyes. Outside of my fascination and proclivity for fairy stories I was pretty practical for my age. I listened to Mom and Dad when they told me things, I was forthcoming and honest if I did something I wasn’t supposed to. I wouldn’t blatantly lie to my Mom, and she knew that.

“Well, then, baby… if you really did see what you think you saw then- well, then it must have been a nightmare. And you’ve slept walked before! You know you were probably just sleep walking, had a nightmare, and woke at the window.”

My brow furrowed, taking what my mom said into consideration but not able to convince myself. I stared out the window in deep thought until we pulled up to the library.

Once we arrived, I didn’t have to worry about trying to give my Mom the slip. My love of books and stories came from her, and she made a B-line for the mystery section. Despite her dismissal of my werewolf theory, she loved spooky stories. 

  After collecting a few books from the sections labeled “folklore” and “nature science,” I found an empty table and started to read. I skimmed through a couple of books on mythology and American folklore and the like, none of its pages revealing any groundbreaking revelations. Silver bullets, transformation under the light of the moon, all the usual factoids. What was highly informative, however, was the expository book on wolves. 

How fast they were, how much power and stamina they possessed, how strong their bite was, how sharp their eyes were, how keen their sense of smell was; all the things that made them great hunters. I kept in mind that this was all a baseline for this creature. At the *very least* it did all these things. The thought overcame me with dread. I didn’t exactly calculate the metrics, but I knew that this monster likely doubled if not tripled anything a wolf could do. 

Knowing that time was running out before Mom came to fetch me, I ran over to the children’s section and grabbed a Junie B. Jones book I hadn’t read yet, as well as the newest Goosebumps book.

When I approached Mom, I tried to hide my wolf book under my selection of age appropriate literature, but Lori didn’t miss a thing.

“Study of the American Wolf, huh?”

I tried to brush past her comment and critical side eye,

“I thought you said I needed to be more realistic. Wolves are real, aren’t they?”

She sighed, rolling her eyes, handing it and my other books over to the librarian for check out. 



That evening at home, we had finished dinner and cleared the dining room table to play Jenga. The phone rang, and Dad stepped out of the room and into the kitchen to take it. Dad answered in a hushed tone, keeping his voice down. Unfortunately for Dad, he wasn’t a great whisperer. 

“Hey Dan… find any-?…How many…?” 

Silence. For a long while, silence. Mom and I locked eyes.

“God… Yeah, I see. Thank the boys for me… I’ll pay em for all their help… we both know that’s a lot of work. So sorry they had to… yeah… well… my God… I don’t know either, man… Yeah… Yeah… Thanks again Dan.”

Dad returned, doing his best to hide the weary look on his face. He glanced over at my Mom, and then at me, giving me a smile. I smiled back timidly. 

I looked back and forth between Mom and Dad, as she gave him a look that said, *‘You know she heard all that, right?’*

Dad hummed, pursing his lips in a wry way. I couldn’t help but laugh at him. But the quiet that followed it sobered the moment.

"Amy,” My Dad paused as he weighed his words. “Your old man… is an awful whisperer.”

“Yeah, you kind of are.” I snickered.

“I know you’re a smart girl, even if you didn’t just hear me on the phone, I know that you know that some scary stuff is going on right now.”

I nodded. Dad sat back down at the table, folding his hands as he spoke.

“But I want you to know that while we’re at the farm, you aren’t in any danger as long as you listen to what your mother and I say. Follow the rules, stay in the yard, and don’t go into the pine rows. I don’t want this to cause you too much distress, because none of this is going to last forever. 

Mr Voss, myself and some other people in the community are getting evidence together, and filling paperwork out- which is stupid- but we are doing it to see if we can get the game warden or someone from DNR involved. Whoever ends up helping us, they will know what to do. Its their job, that my taxes pay for by the way, and the fact that they haven’t sent someone out already is-“

Mom kicked Dad under the table. Dad cleared his throat. 

“The point is, whatever this thing is, a bear, a wolf, its just wandered too far out of its habitat. Whenever someone from the state *does* get out there, they’ll either capture it or kill it or do whatever they have to to keep people safe, to keep us safe.” 

I nodded again with a small smile. I thought it was sweet that Mom and Dad were trying to keep my spirits up, especially when I could tell all of this weighed on them so heavily. 

I tried to lighten the mood a little bit, the way any 8 year old girl would, by being a little snarky.

“So, what will we do if the game warden looks at everything and says its a werewolf?” I said. 

To me it was only kind of a joke, but to Mom and Dad it was ridiculous, and that was all that mattered. Dad smirked.

“Ah yes, your mother told me all about your werewolf theory.”

“Well, what if it is?” I crossed my arms, making a face that wrinkled my nose.

Dad put on a gravely serious look, laying it on thick. 

“If it is, I’ll just have to melt down your mother’s silver dinnerware set into bullets.”

“Oh no you won’t! That set is an heirloom!” 

Dad dramatically lifted his hands, dropping them back down on the table in defeat.

“Well then, I guess your mother is just going to let us all die,”

Mom and I cracked up. Dad attempted to remain dry but the corners of his mouth crept up into a smile. 

“We’ll just have to try and stab the thing with silver butter knives. That’ll show ‘em.”

We cut-up for the rest of the evening, our hearts full of mirth as we turned in for the night. None of us spoke about it again for the rest of the week. But it festered in our minds, leaked into every unoccupied moment. I could see the apprehension buried in their eyes when they were lost in thought, driving, cooking dinner, staring out the window. I lied awake in bed every night, counting down the days until Friday, when we returned to the farm.
