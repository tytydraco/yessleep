[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kb0q2h/were_building_an_army_of_monsters_to_fight/)

My watch buzzed.

**\[00:46:13\]**

The countdown began. Forty-six minutes to write a miracle—or get turned into a gorey mural.

Talk about a deadline.

I tried to cheat the rules. Scribbled a better ending with my pen—something sweeter, something mine. The ink bled straight through, like the page was rejecting me.

The typewriter sat there, smug and silent. 

Broken, like always. 

Or pretending to be.

**\[00:30:13\]**

Still nothing. I screamed myself hoarse. Only the echo answered, thin and pitiful, like even it had given up on me.

No Overseers. No Inquisitors. Not even Edwards. The last time we locked eyes, he looked at me like I was the monster.

Maybe I am.

The Ma’am always said I’d die alone. 

Looks like she finally got something right.

**\[00:20:13\]**

…

The typewriter twitched. Then typed.

The same sentence. Again and again, like a skipped record:

**GOOD BOYS DON’T BLEED SO LOUD**

**GOOD BOYS DON’T BLEED SO LOUD**

**GOOD BOYS DON’T—**

**\[00:17:13\]**

Please.

Not again.

Not her.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Reality buckled.

The air turned to syrup—sweet with lilac, sharp with bleach. A rocking chair creaked. Slow. Measured. Familiar. Carol’s lullaby threaded through the silence. Half-hummed. Half-forgotten.

My stomach dropped. My mouth tasted of copper.

I tried to fight it—to claw my way back to Chamber 13 but the light was already bending.

The walls sighed.

And I slipped.

Not down—but through.

Like a story falling off its rails. Like a page torn from one book and stapled into another. The chamber peeled away. First the walls, then the floor, then suddenly—

I was there again.

A living room drowned in shadow. Moonlight slicing through boarded windows. Dust curling through the beams like cremated pages.

And pain.

Thin fingers in my hair. Cold. Calloused. Familiar.

The Ma’am yanked my head back like she was opening a puppet’s mouth.

“What did I just tell you, Boy?” she hissed.

I choked down a sob. “Good boys don’t bleed so loud.”

“That's right.”

The knife returned. Not quick, not clean—but slow. Deliberate. Like she was signing her name into my spine.

Carol was there, kneeling in front of me. Hands wrapped around mine like they were the only thing left holding me together.

“It’s okay,” she whispered. “It’ll be over soon.”

I knew that. 

I remembered when Gretchen received her Carving. My older sister. It was among my first memories. 

She'd showed it to me afterwards, brushing aside the back of her raven black hair. And there it was—etched into her neck like a brand: an inverted A, its legs long and bent like rabbit ears. Two dots in the center. Eyes. Watching.

The Ma'am's signature. Her proof that neither Gretchen or I had never really been born. Just written.

We were skin-bound sketches. Characters in her private mythology. Tools with just enough soul to suffer, just enough love to make it hurt.

The knife flared hot as it broke the skin.

“You should be proud, Boy. Most of your siblings never made it this far.”

I winced.

Most—but Gretchin did. 

I still remember the night she was exiled.

The way she screamed.

Te gouges her nails left on the wall as the Ma’am dragged her from the Crooked House and through the Door with a Dozen Locks.

“Let this be a lesson,” the Ma’am had told me when she returned, shaking Gretchen's blood from her boots. “There are no happy endings for disobedient children.”

Sometimes, at night, I swore I could still hear my sister crying from the Wood. Begging the Hungry Things not to eat her.

“Ma’am?” I whispered. 

“You may speak, Boy.”

“Our story… it’s about saving people, right?”

The Ma’am snarled. “My story. Not yours.”

She yanked my head back, fingers knotting in my hair like shackles.

“I’m saving this godforsaken world. You’re just the ink I use to write the ending.”

Carol squeezed my hand, trying to defuse the storm. “That’s right. We’re helpers. And the Ma’am’s so close now—so close to saving everyone. Isn’t that lovely?”

I forced a smile, nodding. “Then does that mean… we can leave the Crooked House soon?”

The Ma’am's nails pierced my scalp—blood trickled, warm and slick.

“That depends. Carol hasn’t been terribly cooperative lately, and it's slowed my progress considerably.”

Carol looked down. Shame wrinkled her face. Her hand drifted to her forearm hiding fresh scars, dried blood, like something had fed on her.

“I’ve just… been tired,” she said. “It’s harder to contribute these days.”

I smiled at her—tried to. “It’s okay. You’re doing your best, Gran.”

Everything stopped.

The Ma’am wrenched my head sideways, blade cold against my throat. “Gran?” she hissed. “What did I say about that word, you bloody brat?”

“I—I’m sorry. It just slipped out, I swear—”

“Mother. Gran.” She said them like curses. “Those are forbidden in this domicile.”

Her blade shifted—pointed at Carol like a verdict.

“And this crone hasn’t earned the right to hear them.”

Carol reached out. “You’re right, Ma’am—of course you are. The Boy’s just… excited about the Carving, I’m sure. That’s all it is. It’s jumbled his thoughts.”

“Then he should unjumble them.”

The blade kissed tighter. My blood pattered the floor like rain.

“Tell him a story!” Carol shrieked, voice pitched with desperation and appeasement. 

The Ma’am paused.

Carol knelt before her like a supplicant at the altar. Put her hands on her knee. “The Boy loves your stories. He says you’re the best writer in the world. Isn’t that right, dear?”

I nodded, terrified. “Y-yes, Ma’am.”

The Ma’am’s scowl cracked—reshaping itself into something worse: a sneer. “Is that so? You should’ve said so earlier, Boy. I’m always happy to share my genius with those who need it.”

“Tell him about the Red Queen,” Carol offered. “And how she’s going to save us.”

“Yes,” the Ma’am breathed. “My magnum opus. Once she arrives, the Hungry Things will submit to my narrative completely. We’ll leash them. Weaponize them. And then—then we’ll topple the monster that’s ruining this world.”

“The Boogeyman?” I whispered.

It was the story Carol told me most nights. Our family legacy. The Boogeyman wasn’t just another monster like the Hungry Things, he was the worst creature to ever exist. The thing that haunted people’s dreams and turned them into shadows. 

“That’s right,” Carol whispered, her smile trembling like a candle flame.

“It is not right,” the Ma’am snapped.

Carol recoiled.

“The Boogeyman is a footnote. A distraction. The real enemy is the Disorder.” The Ma’am’s voice grew venomous. “They took everything. My soldiers. My dreams. My legacy. But with the Red Queen leading the charge, I’ll take it all back.”

I swallowed. My throat burned. “And then… we’ll stop the Boogeyman?”

The knife returned. The pain did too.

“Oh yes. We’ll stop the Boogeyman. And anything else that tries to interfere with my narrative. Evil has no place in my story,  Boy. Not while I hold the pen.”

She pressed the blade harder. “Now sit still. You’re getting blood all over my hands.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

And then—

The world reversed.

Shadows peeled backward. Walls liquefied into stone.

The Crooked House was gone.

I was back in Chamber 13, sitting beneath a lonely lightbulb dangling from a cracked ceiling.

Ten minutes had vanished.

The room had changed during my reverie. A new page sat in the typewriter now. Crisp. Waiting. Like it had crawled out of the machine itself. Its words were written in scarlet ink. 

The page was brittle, blackened at the corners, curling inward like it had clawed its way out of a fire that burned a hundred years too long. It smelled of damp earth. Of rot. Of stories buried too deep to forget.

A date in the margin read October 4th, 1857.

So it was old. Too old to be here. 

It looked like a journal entry, or something wearing the skin of one.

I hesitated.

Didn’t want to read it.

Didn’t want to know.

But I had ten minutes before my guts were hung like party streamers, and when those are the stakes, ignorance feels more like a noose than a mercy. So I sat. Let the chair embrace me like an open grave.

And I read.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

***October 4th, 1857***

*There was no place for a girl to grow in our home—only to wilt.*

*Father drank with the conviction of a preacher at judgment and struck with the same grim determination. He claimed it was for the salvation of my soul, though I suspect he took more pleasure in the punishment than in any promise of heaven.*

*Mother had only just returned from the asylum, her words no longer arranged in sentences but scattered like broken glass across a marble floor—half-thoughts and murmurs, delicate as rain on a coffin lid.*

*We had so little. With Father’s meager wages and growing bitterness, he sold what remained of value in our home. And when he made to pawn Mother’s old typewriter—the last relic of the woman she once was—I clung to it with a desperation I can scarcely describe. I pleaded. I wept. For it was not merely a machine, but a memory of her better self, the one who once wrote me fables and cast me as their heroine.*

*He relented in the way men do when tired of the noise women make. Gave me six months, he said—six months to prove I could sell a story and earn my keep. After that, he would sell it for bread and forget it had ever belonged to anyone but him.*

*But writing is no easy feat, nor is the telling of stories as simple as reading them. I attempted first a tale of a brave knight who slew dragons and rescued maidens, but I found myself unable to finish it. My thoughts recoiled from steel and blood, for such things reminded me too much of home.*

*Instead, I wrote of a gentle creature—a hare, dressed in a buttoned coat, who bore neither sword nor shield, but a soft heart and kind eyes. He was not made for battles, nor for happy endings, but for companionship. He, like me, was too sorrowful to believe in conclusions wrapped in ribbon.*

*When the tale was finished, I ran to show Mother. I remember reading aloud the opening lines, standing beside her while she sat at the kitchen table, dealing cards into neat piles as though playing against time itself. She neither stirred nor spoke, but hummed softly, her attention fixed on ghosts I could not see.*

*So I brought the pages to the brook at the edge of our land, and read them aloud to the hush between the trees and the water. It seemed a fitting thing—to give my words to the wind, if not to the woman who’d taught me stories once mattered.*

*And it was there, just beyond the edge of sound, that I first glimpsed him.*

*He stood across the water, half-shrouded by the alder trees—tall, hunched, with limbs that did not move as limbs ought to. He was a creature drawn from memory’s edge, more dream than flesh, his fur peeling in patches at the shoulder and a top hat slouched forward to veil his eyes.*

*He raised a hand in greeting. Slowly. Uncertainly. As though unsure whether I was real, or whether he was.*

*I asked who he was—though I no longer remember whether I spoke the question aloud or simply felt it pass between us in that breathless space. He replied, in a voice made of wind and apology, that I might call him Hare, if it pleased me.*

*And when he asked my name, I told him I was Alice, and that I had written him into being.*

*He reached across the stream and touched the bruise that still ached on my cheek. He asked, gently, why someone who could conjure wonders looked so sorrowful.*

*I confessed, in the way children confess—not in words, but in quiet eyes and trembling shoulders—that sadness seemed to find its way into girls like me.* 

*He studied me for a moment, then said something that has never quite left me. That I was the brightest thing he had ever seen, but confused—scrambled, like light through puzzle-glass. He spoke of a place called Wonderland, and how it might help mend me.*

*When I asked what Wonderland was, he offered me his hand.*

*And I, foolish with hope, took it.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The last line had barely cooled on the page when I heard it.

A breath. Soft. Measured.

Behind me.

I froze.

Didn’t look. Didn’t breathe.

Because I *knew*—the way animals know lightning is coming—that if I turned around too fast, I might catch something still finishing the act of pretending it wasn’t there.

But nothing moved.

No footsteps. No shadows. Just stillness.

Just the stone walls of Chamber 13. Empty. Waiting.

I exhaled—and that’s when the typewriter clicked.

A fresh sheet. Same yellowed paper. Same scorched corners. A new date in the corner: **October 7th, 1857.**

My stomach tightened.

Someone—or *something*—was still writing.

Still telling this story.

And I had a bad feeling it wouldn’t have a happy ending. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**October 7th, 1857**

*The Hare led me beneath the veil of trees, and as we walked, the world began to unravel.*

*The forest twisted around us like thread unwinding from a forgotten spool. Trees became ribbons of shade, the sky deepened into a blue too vast for human naming, and mushrooms bloomed with thrones where toadstools had once been. I recall caterpillars reclining upon branches and blowing riddles into the air through pipes of porcelain. Lights shimmered where no lanterns burned, and shadows gathered in shapes I dared not follow.*

*It was Wonderland, or so he said—and I believed him. For in that strange and splendid place, I was no longer small. I was no longer unloved. I was not a child to be struck or shushed. I was something else entirely: a dreamer given dominion.*

*I danced, barefoot and laughing, across petal-strewn paths and told him—perhaps even promised—that I should never wish to leave again. But his smile faltered at that. He plucked at the fur upon his collar and would not meet my eye. When I asked why, he told me the world was broken in ways Wonderland could not repair, and that no one stayed forever. Not really. Not even those who wished to.*

*He spoke then of a terrible thing. A Boogeyman, he called it, though the name felt too childish for what he described—a vast, twisted sleeper beyond the stars, whose breath could extinguish joy and whose dreams could drown whole worlds in silence. He said that when it woke, all wonder would be devoured, and we would be left with nothing but sorrow.*

*I told him—perhaps a little foolishly, as children often do—that I would stop it. That we must stop it. But the Hare only shook his head. He said the Boogeyman was too old, too immense. That to face such a thing, we would need something equally terrible.*

*It brought to mind my mother’s cards—her endless games of solitaire, played long into the night as though she might stack her sorrows into some semblance of peace. There was a strange sort of grace in it, I thought. The quiet rhythm of turning cards, the patient pursuit of order from chaos.*

*And I began to wonder whether I, too, might arrange such order. Not with kings and queens, but with creatures of my own invention—monsters born not of malice, but of meaning. A deck of dread things, each tailored to face the horrors I could not name, shaped with care to balance the scales.*

*And at the heart of it—at the center of that imagined deck—there would be a card the Boogeyman itself might fear. Not a knight, nor a queen, nor even a joker. But something wholly my own.*

*An Ace of Alice.*

*Yet while I dreamed of monsters and meanings, the hours slipped away unnoticed. The moon, peeking through passing clouds, blinked once more—and the weight of the world returned to my shoulders. I said I must go. Father would be waiting.* 

*The Hare seemed sorrowful, but understanding. He asked, in his gentle way, whether I might write him a companion—someone to stay with him while I was gone. Not a girl, like myself, but a rougher sort. A boy with dirt under his nails and a house in the woods. Someone who could build things. Protect things.*

*I told him I would try.*

*And then I ran—ran back across the twisted threshold of Wonderland and into the woods behind our home, my heart still alight with the promise of something better.*

*But promises are frail things, and joy never lingers where men like my father wait.*

*As I stepped from the trees, Father caught me by the hair and dragged me across the yard like a sack of grain. He was shouting—always shouting—and his breath reeked of rot and liquor. He called me a curse, a mouth he could scarcely feed, and I remember thinking how terribly small the world had become again. Wonderland had vanished, and I was a girl once more.*

*I cried out, not to him, but to the forest behind me. Pleading. Begging. For someone to help. For someone to see.*

*And there—just beyond the edge of night—I saw the Hare.*

*He was watching. His button eyes wide. His ears trembling.*

*But he did not move.*

*He vanished into the thicket, and I was left to the blows that followed—my body battered, my hope thinned to thread, crying out for a friend who would not come.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The light in Chamber 13 shifted.

Didn't flicker. Didn't make a sound. Just ...grew dimmer. Like a cloud had passed overhead. Except there were no windows. And there certainly weren't any clouds.

I leaned back in the chair, bones creaking like cold timber. The air felt thicker now, like something had been added to the room while I read.

Something caught my eye.

A smear. There—on the far wall. Red and smudged. 

Fresh.

I stood and crossed the room, heart ticking with each step. Whatever this was, it wasn’t ink. It looked more like *blood.* 

It’d been written with a finger. Dragged across the surface in looping cursive:

*“Do you dream of her too?”*

I swallowed. 

Behind me, the typewriter *clicked* again. 

Another page was being fed in. The keys moved of their own accord—soft, deliberate, like a child sounding out a sentence. A new date blinked into existence on the upper margin: **October 13th, 1857.**

I looked back at the wall. The writing was gone.

Just me again.

I hope.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**October 13th, 1857**

*That night, the Hare returned.*

*He knelt beside me at the brook, head bowed, hat in hand. He apologized. Not with the simplicity of words, but with a sorrow that made his form seem smaller than I remembered. He told me he had seen something dreadful in my father’s eyes. Not madness, but possession. A shadow curled too deep to dislodge. A flicker of the very Boogeyman he had warned me of—bleeding into the man who shared my roof.*

*He said he wanted to help me. That he could help me—if only I would make him better.*

*So I did.*

*I sat once more before the typewriter and laid trembling fingers on the keys. I thought of the Hare’s stammer, his gentleness, his failure. I thought of the blood on my tongue and the purple on my skin. I thought of how badly I wished for someone not just to stand beside me—but to strike back in my place.*

*And I rewrote him.*

*Not as he was, but as he should have been.*

*I imagined a creature who stood taller than cruelty, whose voice rang not with hesitance but command. A being whose gentleness had curdled into cunning, whose whimsy was now warpaint. He would wear a hat still, for dignity’s sake. A tall one, stitched and proper. But he would no longer be just the Hare.*

*He would be both Hare and Hatter.*

*And also neither.*

*When I looked up, he was already there. Taller now. Sharper. His coat had grown long and threadbare. His smile no longer trembled—it cut. And though his eyes still held something of the creature I had loved, they burned now with a fever I could not name.*

*He thanked me.*

*And gave me his name.*

*Mister Neither.*

*The next day, he returned to the world with me.*

*We stepped from the trees together, and for the first time, I was not afraid.*

*Father saw us and stormed forward, his face red with fury, voice rising with self-righteous venom. He accused me of wickedness, of abandonment, of spite. He lifted a hand, intending to strike me again.*

*But then he saw Mister Neither.*

*And he faltered.*

*My guardian stepped between us, and in that moment, time seemed to shudder.*

*There are things I shall never be able to write with accuracy, only with ache. What happened next is one of them.*

*Mister Neither fell upon my father—not like a beast, but like a riddle too jagged to solve. He tore, he snarled, he laughed like broken clockwork, and my father screamed—not in rage this time, but in prayer. He called out my name again and again, begging for salvation from the very thing I had imagined into existence.*

*And I wanted to stop it.*

*I think I even tried.*

*But Mister Neither would not listen.*

*When it was done, my father’s heart lay on the grass like a fruit overripe, and my dearest friend wiped the blood from his mouth with the hem of my dress.*

*“There,” he said, with dreadful pride. “Now we can go back to Wonderland.”*

*But I could not go back. Not now. Not with what I had seen.*

*I told him as much. Told him he was worse than anything my father had ever been. That he had twisted my wish for protection into something monstrous. That I missed the Hare, even in his cowardice.*

*He did not argue.*

*He only said that I had made him mean.*

*And then he struck me.*

*Not hard at first. Just enough to shock. Then again. And once more.*

*But on the third, he hesitated.*

*And in that flicker of stillness, I saw something terrible: regret.*

*He pulled his hat low over his face to hide his gaze and backed away.*

*I rose to my feet. My dress was soaked in father’s blood, my lip split, and my soul aching in places I didn’t yet understand.*

*I told him to leave me.*

*Told him I hated him.*

*And I ran.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I blinked.

Something stung behind my eyes, like I’d been crying without knowing it. And there was that feeling again, like insects on skin, like someone sitting behind me. Reading over my shoulder.

Slowly—mechanically—I turned my head.

Nothing.

I looked back at the typewriter.

Another page. No click. No whir. It was just… *there.*

A date in the margin: **November 17th, 1857.**

This time the page was stained with something—a splotch of scarlet. And a scatter of what might have been tears.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**November 17th, 1857**

*I threw myself before the typewriter like a girl returning to the only savior who had ever answered her prayers.*

*I struck the keys with all the fury of the broken. I wrote not for story, but for salvation. And as I typed, I spoke aloud so Mister Neither would hear every word. So he would know, even as he approached, what fate awaited him.*

*I wrote that Mister Neither—my creation, my protector, my mistake—left Alice and Wonderland alone. Alone. Alone.*

*That he should never be a part of my story ever again.* 

*I remember how he howled. How he begged. How his voice cracked in that awful, inhuman way. “We’re supposed to be friends,” he said, though by then, it was far too late for forgiveness. “Please don't abandon me—”*

*But the magic took him.*

*It surged from the machine like smoke and ache, wrapped around him like binding ribbon, and tore him from the world. Back to the forest. Back to the dark. Back to nowhere and less.*

*And when it was done, I collapsed into my mother’s arms.*

*“Oh, Mama,” I whispered. “He’s gone. Father’s gone. I’ve ruined everything with my foolish stories.”*

*But she did not cradle me.*

*She did not even weep.*

*She simply laid down another card in her eternal game of solitaire and said, with a voice soft as powdered dust, “That’s nice. How are your stories coming, dear?”*

*Her emptiness broke me in a way nothing else had. It was worse than a dead father. More terrible than a dreadful Hatter. It was a taunting reminder of my loneliness, that aching void that existed in a heart so vast.*

*The next day, I returned to the brook desperate and weeping. But the threshold was gone.*

*Wonderland would no longer open.*

*So I returned home and brought the typewriter to the kitchen table. Sat beside my mother as she hummed and played, and confessed, with more shame than I had ever known, that the machine was broken. I'd somehow ruined it.* 

*She looked up—truly looked, as though surfacing from beneath deep water. Her eyes met mine, and for a moment, I saw her again. The woman who once told stories. The one who had loved me.*

*“It isn’t broken, dear,” she said gently. “It simply needs love, as all stories do.”*

*That word struck something in me. Love. As though it were a spell I had long since forgotten how to cast.*

*I asked what she meant, but she was already drifting—retreating into her cards, into her haze, as though the brief gleam of lucidity had been no more than the sun slipping behind a cloud.*

*And so I sat there, unmoving, as the weight of it all pressed down upon me—silent and infinite, like fresh earth heaped over a coffin. The world itself had grown too large, too cruel. The silence had thickened into something bodily, and the typewriter before me—once my sanctuary, once my sword—lay quiet, cold, and hungering.*

*For I had no love left to give it.*

*All whom I had once entrusted with my heart had wounded me in return.*

*My father, with his fists of scripture.*

*My mother, with her absence and her dreaming.*

*Even the Hare, with his cowardice and stammers.*

*Yet I suspected the machine did not care whom it drank from, so long as the love was real.*

*And so, with hands trembling as though some ghost had passed through me, I reached out and took the only love I still possessed.*

*I guided my mother’s fingers toward the keys—fingers that had once plaited my hair, that had once written fables beneath candlelight—and I asked, in a voice softer than prayer, whether she still loved me as she once had, before madness and melancholy had stolen her gaze.*

*And in that instant—oh, that fleeting, golden instant—she smiled. Truly smiled.*

*Her eyes found mine. Clear. Present. Alive.*

*“Of course,” she whispered, voice barely above breath. “I will love you forever, Alice.”*

*And it was then the machine began to stir.*

*It exhaled with a sound like ancient bellows, a great and slumbering god roused from hibernation. From within its belly unspooled long, glistening tendrils—brass-veined and serpentine—that lashed outward with a hiss of rust and purpose. They curled around my mother’s wrist, and then they sank in.*

*Biting.*

*Chewing.*

*Drinking.*

*I took my place before the machine. The ribbon ran red with her blood, and the keys beneath my fingertips began to pulse with warmth, as though the very veins of the thing had been filled anew. The carriage jolted forward with an eagerness that felt almost reverent—like an altar made ready.*

*My mother groaned. Her spine curled. Her eyes dulled into porcelain.*

*And still, I wrote.*

*I told her thank you, though she could no longer hear. I told her I forgave her—for the nights she did not come, for the cries she did not answer, for the bruise that stayed too long and the lullaby that never came. I told her, too, that this was her fault, though I spoke it gently, for there was no cruelty left in me—only a child's sorrow made old. But I promised her I would make it right. That I would take this grief and shape it into meaning. That I would grant her absolution in the only way I knew how.*

*I would write the ending my story deserved.* 

*And I would write it with my mother’s love.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I looked away from the journal with trembling fingers. 

Love, I thought.

So that’s what fed the typewriter. That’s what birthed the monsters. Not hatred. Not grief. Not even ink.

But love—raw, desperate, and unreciprocated.

Alice founded the Order in 1867. Everyone knew that. She went missing in 1902. Nobody knew what happened to her, but most figured she killed herself. 

Yet her story felt oddly familiar. Like it wasn’t something I’d read—but something I’d *forgotten.*

The voice. The rhythm. The way her words curled like barbed wire around old wounds. I didn’t recognize them, but something inside me did.

I looked again at the name of her monster.

**Mister Neither.**

The Hare. The Hatter. A thing written twice, and broken both times.

He wasn’t just a myth. He was the *origin* of this whole nightmare. The genesis. The cracked foundation.  He was the one Owens must’ve been talking about, the one that made Edwards go paler than a ghost. 

The First Draft.

Whatever he did to Alice—whatever she did to *him*—this is where it all began.

The Conscripts.

The Vaults.

The Order of Alice itself.

Mister Neither didn’t just start the story. He was the story. And I was standing in his footnotes.

The only question now was: Where did he go?

Was he still out there? Grieving a girl who left him behind? Or had he—

**Click.**

The light overhead hissed. Then burst\*.\*

Darkness swallowed the chamber like floodwater.

A high, brittle giggle spilled from the walls. Too bright. Too *young.*

My chest seized. My wrist beeped.

**\[00:00\]**

Shit. 

Time’s up.

The typewriter whirred. The journal page was ripped backward into the machine, like it was being devoured. Like it was trying to cover its tracks.

*Shitshitshit.*

Emergency lighting stuttered to life. Sickly. Pale. Wrong. The room bled shadows; long, wet, and twitching.

And then—

**“M-Mister Reyes…”**

The voice was everywhere. Leaking from the walls. The ceiling. Crawling out of my own mind. 

My name.

It *knew* my name.

Something moved.

A silhouette spilled across the floor like a spider learning to walk. Limbs too long. Ears drooping like funeral drapes. A grin—wide, crooked—leading the way.

It rose.

Towering. Splinter-limbed. Dressed in Victorian black, buttoned to the throat like a coffin lid.

It was him.

Alice's Frankenstein.

He swayed like a scarecrow hung too long in the wind. His grin twitched upward—too high, too hungry, like a shattered portrait trying to remember how to smile.

He looked like the painting. The one I touched. The one that bled.

I scrambled back. Slipped.

He caught me—

Snatched me up by the collar, and I dangled like a doll in a child's grip.

He settled me into the chair with strange care, like a child putting down a favorite toy they weren’t sure still worked. Emergency lighting sputtered overhead, drowning the chamber in a queasy red blink. Shadows pulsed in rhythm with my heart.

The creature crouched at the far end of the steel table, motionless—almost reverent. Its slouching top hat veiled its face in darkness, but I saw enough. Tufts of fur were missing from its scalp, ears limp and twitching at its sides like wilting petals.

It had changed since Alice’s journal. Grown stranger. Meaner.

Less Hare.

More Hatter.

“I know you,” I said, my voice barely a whisper. “You’re… Mister Neither.”

It nodded, quick and jittery. “And you’re M-Mister Reyes. So n-n-nice to make your acquaintance.” It reached into its coat pocket, arm vanishing deep past the elbow as ancient trinkets tumbled out—buttons, keys, scraps of burned paper. Too many things for any one coat to hold.

“What are you looking for?” I asked.

It frowned, eyes hidden behind the brim. “A teacup,” it murmured, like that should’ve been obvious. “What else?”

With a delighted gasp, it withdrew a cracked piece of china and set it on the table between us like an offering. The porcelain was yellowed, rimmed with filth.

“Right…” I said slowly, hating the way my voice shook. “Can I ask what you’re doing here?”

It smiled—thin, off-kilter. “At first I didn’t know. I’d been sleeping for s-such a long time. Then I woke up. Or I should say… the typewriter did.”

My eyes swiveled to the rusted behemoth resting atop the table. 

“It likes you, even if it hides it. It hasn’t hummed like that since Ali—” He suddenly clamped a hand to his mouth, wincing as if he’d nearly cursed. Then, more softly said, “Since *she* used it.”He touched my cheek. “You remind me of her, you know? I so adore broken little children. Their shattered hearts. Splintered minds. They make such lo-lovely bedtime stories.” The smile twitched wider. “I like to help them see how their stories end.”

Then its expression stuttered—glitched. Froze. A tremor ran through its frame.

Something was wrong.

It yanked down on its tophat, hiding its button eyes. Light flared behind the veil of the fabric, twin glows like distant moons. It started to wheeze. Choke. That whimsical, stammering cadence began to twist, deforming into something dry and mechanical.

It gripped the brim of its hat like a drowning man clutching a rope. “No,” it rasped. “We agreed. I was to speak to him. You promised—”

Its body lurched. Bones cracked like gunshots.

The spine surged beneath its suit, bulging like a worm beneath silk. Fabric split at the seams. The frame beneath it grew taller, thicker. Wrong.

And still the smile stayed.

But it wasn’t his anymore.

“You talked to him,” snarled a voice no longer touched by stutter or warmth. “*My turn.”*

I couldn’t move. My heart pounded like it was trying to escape my chest. I recognized this. The split. The sickness. *This was what Alice had seen.*

The Hare was gone.

Only the Hatter remained.

It rose above me in a smooth, nightmarish glide, moonlight-eyes burning through the skin of its hat like searchlights. Its teeth were no longer bucked—they were pointed now. Arrowheads. Fangs. The drooping ears shot upward, rigid as knives.

“Hello,” it said softly. Coldly. “Care for a cup of tea?”

It set the teacup in front of me with eerie precision. I stared down into it, hands trembling. Not understanding. 

“It’s empty,” I croaked.

“Look again.”

It grabbed a fistful of my hair and slammed my head into the table. Once. Twice. Again. The world became spinning metal and ringing noise. Something hot trickled down my face.

Blood.

Tears.

The Hatter lifted the cup and held it beneath my eye, collecting every drop. Then it dropped it back onto the table with a hollow *clack*.

I blinked blearily at the mix of red and salt, my stomach twisting.

“What… what is this?”

The smile didn’t change. It didn’t need to.

“Tea,” it said. “To bring you down the rabbit hole.”

I shook my head.

“Drink it all up." He hissed, voice dropping to a low growl. "*Unless you’d like some more*.”

My fingers closed around the chipped porcelain, hands shaking.
