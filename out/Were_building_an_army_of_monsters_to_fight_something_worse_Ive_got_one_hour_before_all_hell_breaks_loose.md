My watch buzzed.

**\[00:46:13\]**

The countdown began. Forty-six minutes to write a miracle, or get turned into a gorey mural.

Talk about a deadline.

I tried to cheat the rules by scribbling a better ending with my pen, but the ink bled straight through.

**\[00:30:13\]**

I screamed myself hoarse. Only the echo answered, thin and pitiful, like even my own voice had given up on me.

Shit.

The Ma’am always said I’d die alone. 

Looks like she finally got something right.

**\[00:20:13\]**

The typewriter twitched.

Then typed.

Just the same sentence, over and over:

**GOOD BOYS DON’T BLEED SO LOUD**

**GOOD BOYS DON’T BLEED SO LOUD**

**GOOD BOYS DON’T—**

**\[00:17:13\]**

*Please.*

*Not again.*

*Not her.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Reality buckled.

The air turned to syrup. A rocking chair creaked. Slow. Measured. Familiar. Carol’s lullaby threaded through the silence. Half-hummed. Half-forgotten.

My stomach dropped. My mouth tasted of apologies.

I tried to fight it—to claw my way back to Chamber 13 but the light was already bending.

The walls sighed.

And I slipped.

Not down—but through.

Like a story falling off its rails. The chamber peeled away. First the walls, then the floor, then suddenly—

I was there again.

A living room drowned in shadow. Moonlight slicing through boarded windows. Dust curling through the beams like cremated pages.

And pain.

The Ma’am yanked my head back like she was opening a puppet’s mouth.

“What did I just tell you, Boy?” she hissed.

I choked down a sob. “Good boys don’t bleed so loud.”

“That's right.”

Her knife returned. Not quick, not clean—but slow and deliberate, like she was signing her name into my spine.

Carol was there, kneeling in front of me. Frail hands wrapped around mine like they were the only thing left holding me together.

“It’s okay,” she whispered. “It’ll be over soon.”

I knew that. 

I remembered when Gretchen received her Carving. My older sister. It was among my first memories. 

She'd showed it to me afterwards—etched into her neck like a brand: an inverted A, its legs long and bent like rabbit ears. Two dots in the center. Eyes. The Ma'am's signature. Her proof that neither Gretchen or I had never really been born. Just written.

She called us characters in her private mythology. Rough drafts with just enough soul to suffer, and just enough love to make it hurt.

The knife flared hot as it broke the skin. The Ma'am's voice was like arsenic.

“You should be proud, Boy. Most of your siblings never made it this far.”

I winced.

True, most didn't. But Gretchin had. 

I still remember the night she was exiled.

The way she screamed.

The gouges her nails left on the wall as the Ma’am dragged her from the Crooked House and out the Door with a Dozen Locks.

*“Let this be a lesson,*” the Ma’am had told me when she returned, breathlessly shaking Gretchen's blood from her boots. “*There are no happy endings for disobedient brats.*”

Sometimes, at night, I swore I could still hear my sister crying from the Wood. Begging the Hungry Things not to eat her.

I shook the thought from my mind.

“Ma’am?” I whispered. 

“Speak, Boy.”

“Our story… it’s about saving people, right?”

The Ma’am twitched. “My story. Not yours.”

She yanked my head back, fingers knotting in my hair.

“This world is mine to save. All you are is another weapon to help it along."

Carol squeezed my hand, seeing my horror. "Not weapons. Helpers, dear. That's what we are. And the Ma’am’s so close now—so close to saving everyone. Isn’t that lovely?”

I forced a smile, nodding. “Does that mean we can leave the Crooked House soon?”

“That depends." The Ma’am's nails pierced my scalp—blood trickled, warm and slick. "Carol hasn’t been terribly cooperative lately. It's slowed my progress *considerably*.”

Carol looked down. Shame wrinkled her face. Her hand drifted to her forearm hiding fresh scars, dried blood, like something had fed on her.

“I’ve just… been tired,” she said quickly. “It’s harder to contribute these days. But I'm trying."

I smiled at her. Or at least, tried to. “It’s okay. You’re doing your best, Gran.”

Everything stopped.

The Ma’am wrenched my head sideways, blade cold against my throat. “What did I say about that word, you bloody brat?”

“I—I’m sorry. It just slipped out, I swear—”

“Mother! Gran!” She said them like curses. “Those words are forbidden in this house!”

Her blade shifted, pointing at Carol like a verdict. “And this crone? She hasn’t earned the right to hear them.”

Carol reached out, trying to defuse the situation. “You’re right—of course you are. The Boy’s just… excited about the Carving, I’m sure." She looked at me. "Isn't that right?"

I nodded quickly, heart pounding.

"See? That's all it was. It's jumbled his head a bit."

The blade kissed tighter. My blood pattered the floor like rain. *“Then he should unjumble it.”*

“Tell him a story!” Carol shrieked, voice pitched with desperation. "The Boy loves your stories!"

The Ma’am paused. Her scowl cracked, reshaping itself into a sneer. “Is that so? You should’ve said so sooner, Boy. I’m always happy to share my genius with those who need it. What story would you like to hear?"

“Tell him about the Red Queen,” Carol offered. “And how she’s going to save us. He'll enjoy that one.”

“Yes,” the Ma’am breathed. “My magnum opus."

I gulped, shifting uneasily beneath the blade. "What's the story about?"

"Revenge," the Ma'am said simply. "Once the Red Queen arrives, the Hungry Things will submit to my narrative completely. We’ll leash them. Turn their fangs into weapons. And then—then we’ll topple the monster that took everything from me.”

“The Boogeyman...” I whispered.

It was the story Carol told me most nights. Our family's legacy. The Boogeyman wasn’t just another monster, he was the worst creature to ever exist. The thing that haunted people’s dreams and turned them into shadows. 

“That’s right,” Carol told me, her smile trembling like a candle flame. "The Boogeyman is—"

“Wrong!” the Ma’am snapped.

Carol recoiled.

“The Boogeyman is a footnote, you daft crone. A distraction. The real enemy is the Disorder.” The Ma’am’s voice tilted venomous. “They took everything from me. My soldiers. My dreams. My legacy. But with the Red Queen leading the charge, I’ll take it all back—and then I'll write a lullaby with their screams.”

My throat burned, voice trembling. “And... And then we’ll stop the Boogeyman?”

The knife returned. So did the pain. "Certainly. We'll stop the Boogeyman and anything else foolish enough to interfere. Make no mistake, Boy. This is my story, and evil has no place in it—not while I hold the pen."

She pressed the blade harder. “Now sit still. You’re getting *blood* all over my hands.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

And then—

The world reversed.

Shadows peeled backward. Walls liquefied into stone.

The Crooked House was gone.

I was back in Chamber 13, sitting beneath a lonely lightbulb dangling from a cracked ceiling.

The Boogeyman. The Red Queen.

I groaned, hand running through my hair.

I'd done a decade's worth of therapy to bury those memories, and now they were resurfacing. Why?

It all started the second the elevator dropped. Was it something about the Sub-Vaults that was digging into my subconscious, then?

Or was something else trying to get my attention?

**DING!**

The typewriter's carriage slid over. A fresh page sat in the holster. Crisp. Waiting. Impossible. It was fully typed, like it'd crawled out of the machine when I wasn't looking.

"What the...?"

It looked like a journal entry—that, or something wearing the skin of one.

I hesitated.

Truthfully, it made my skin crawl to even look at. I wondered whether it was safe to read it. Maybe the words were haunted. Or cursed. Or worse. But then, I was half an hour away from having my intestines hung like party streamers, and when those are the stakes, you'll take what you can get.

It's not like I had another exit strategy.

So I sank into the chair, told myself a pretty lie that the typewriter wanted to help me escape. That these words just might hold the secret to my salvation. 

I couldn't have been more wrong.

***October 4th, 1857***

*There was no place for a girl to grow in our home—only to wilt.*

*Father drank with the conviction of a preacher at judgment and struck with the same grim determination. He claimed it was for the salvation of my soul, though I suspect he took more pleasure in the punishment than in any promise of heaven.*

*Mother had only just returned from the asylum, her words no longer arranged in sentences but scattered like broken glass across a marble floor—half-thoughts and murmurs, delicate as rain on a coffin lid.*

*We had so little. With Father’s meager wages and growing bitterness, he sold what remained of value in our home. And when he made to pawn Mother’s old typewriter—the last relic of the woman she once was—I clung to it with a desperation I can scarcely describe. I pleaded. I wept. For it was not merely a machine, but a memory of her better self, the one who once wrote me fables and cast me as their heroine.*

*He relented in the way men do when tired of the noise children make. Gave me six months, he said—six months to prove I could sell a story and earn my keep. After that, he would sell it for bread.*

*I wrote of a gentle creature—a hare, dressed in a buttoned coat, who bore neither sword nor shield, but a soft heart and kind eyes. He was not made for battles, nor for happy endings, but for companionship.*

*He, like me, was too sorrowful to believe in conclusions wrapped in ribbon.*

*When the tale was finished, I ran to show Mother. She neither stirred nor spoke, but hummed softly, her attention fixed on ghosts I could not see.*

*So instead, I brought the pages to the brook at the edge of our land, and read them aloud to the hush between the trees and the water. It seemed a fitting thing—to give my words to the wind, if not to the woman who’d taught me stories once mattered.*

*And it was there, just beyond the edge of sound, that I first glimpsed him.*

*He stood across the water, half-shrouded by the alder trees—tall, hunched, with limbs that did not move as limbs ought to. He was a creature drawn from memory’s edge, more dream than flesh, his fur peeling in patches at the shoulder and a top hat slouched forward to veil his eyes.*

*He raised a hand in greeting. Slowly. Uncertainly. As though unsure whether I was real, or whether he was.*

*I asked who he was—though I no longer remember whether I spoke the question aloud or simply felt it pass between us in that breathless space. He replied, in a voice made of wind and apology, that I might call him Hare, if it pleased me.*

*And when he asked my name, I told him I was Alice, and that I had written him into being.*

*He reached across the stream and touched the bruise that still ached on my cheek. He asked, gently, why someone who could conjure such wonders looked so sorrowful.*

*I confessed, in the way children confess—not in words, but in quiet eyes and trembling shoulders—that sadness seemed to find its way into girls like me.* 

*He studied me for a moment, then said something that has never quite left me. That I was the brightest thing he had ever seen, but confused—scrambled, like light through puzzle-glass. He spoke of a place called Wonderland, and how it might help mend me.*

*When I asked what Wonderland was, he offered me his hand.*

*And I, foolish with hope, took it.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The last line had barely cooled on the page when I heard it.

A breath.

Soft. Measured.

Right behind me.

Shit.

I *knew in* the way animals know lightning is coming, that if I turned around too fast, I might catch something still finishing the act of pretending it wasn’t there. So I turned slowly.

And saw nothing.

No lurching shadows. No fanged monsters waiting to sink their teeth in. Just eerie stillness and the aching silence of Chamber 13.

The typewriter clicked.

I look back to find a fresh sheet being feed into the machine, corners scorched like it'd survived a fire that should have killed it.

Alice\*—\*could this really be her lost journal? The founder of the Order itself?

My stomach tightened.

The keys clacked.

Someone—or *something*—was still writing.

Still telling Alice's story.

And I had a bad feeling it wouldn’t have a happy ending.

**October 7th, 1857**

*The Hare led me beneath the veil of trees, and as we walked, the world began to unravel.*

*The forest twisted around us. Trees became ribbons of shade, the sky deepened into a blue too vast for human naming, and mushrooms bloomed with thrones where toadstools had once been. I recall caterpillars reclining upon branches and blowing riddles into the air through pipes of porcelain. Lights shimmered where no lanterns burned, and shadows gathered in shapes I dared not follow.*

*It was Wonderland, or so he said—and I believed him.*

*I danced, barefoot and laughing, across petal-strewn paths and told him that I should never wish to leave again. But his smile faltered. He plucked at the fur upon his collar and would not meet my eye. When I asked why, he told me the world was broken in ways Wonderland could not repair, and that no one stayed forever. Not really.*

*He spoke then of a terrible thing. A Boogeyman, he called it, though the name felt too childish for what he described—a vast, twisted sleeper beyond the stars, whose breath could extinguish joy and whose dreams could drown whole worlds in silence. He said that when it woke, all wonder would be devoured, and we would be left with nothing but grief.*

*I told him—perhaps a little foolishly, as children often do—that I would stop it. That we must stop it. But the Hare only shook his head. He said the Boogeyman was too old, too immense. That to face such a thing, we would need something equally terrible.*

*It brought to mind my mother’s cards—her endless games of solitaire, played long into the night as though she might stack her sorrows into some semblance of peace. There was a strange sort of grace in it, I thought. The quiet rhythm of turning cards, the patient pursuit of order from chaos.*

*And I began to wonder whether I, too, might arrange such order.*

*Not with kings and queens, but with creatures of my own invention—monsters born not of malice, but of meaning. A deck of dread things, each tailored to face the horrors I could not name, shaped with care to balance the scales.*

*And at the heart of it—at the center of that imagined deck—there would be a card the Boogeyman itself might fear. Not a knight, nor a queen, nor even a joker. But something wholly my own.*

*An Ace of Alice.*

*Yet while I dreamed of monsters and meanings, the hours slipped away unnoticed. The moon, peeking through passing clouds, blinked once more—and the weight of the world returned to my shoulders. I said I must go. Father would be waiting.* 

*The Hare seemed glum, but understanding. He asked, in his gentle way, whether I might write him a companion—someone to stay with him while I was gone. Not a girl, like myself, but a rougher sort. A young man with dirt under his nails who could build things. A house, perhaps. One that we could all live in, far from the dreariness of Father.*

*I told him I would try.*

*And then I ran—ran back across the twisted threshold of Wonderland and into the woods behind our home, my heart still alight with the promise of something better.*

*But promises are frail things, and joy never lingers where men like my father wait.*

*As I stepped from the trees, Father caught me by the hair and dragged me across the yard like a sack of grain. He was shouting—always shouting—and his breath reeked of rot and liquor. He called me a curse, a harlot, and I remember thinking how terribly small the world had become again. Wonderland had vanished, and I was nobody once more.*

*I cried out, not to Father, but to the forest behind us. Pleading. Begging. For someone to help. For someone to see.*

*And there—just beyond the edge of night—I saw the Hare.*

*He was watching. His button eyes wide. His ears trembling.*

*But he did not move.*

*He vanished into the thicket, and I was left to the blows that followed—my body battered, my hope thinned to thread, crying out for a friend who would not come.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The light in Chamber 13 shifted.

Didn't flicker. Didn't even make a sound. Just ...grew dimmer, like a cloud had passed overhead. Except there were no windows. And there certainly weren't any clouds.

I leaned back in the chair, bones creaking like cold timber. The air felt thicker now, like something had been added to the room while I read.

That's when something caught my eye.

There—on the far wall. Red and smudged. 

A smear of words.

I stood and crossed the room, goosebumps tingling my arms. The words. They’d been written with a finger. Dragged across the wall's surface in looping cursive:

*“Do you dream of her too?”*

I frowned.

Whatever this was, it wasn’t ink.

It looked more like... *blood.* 

I shivered. 

***DING!***

I wheeled about, heart leaping in my chest.

Chamber 13 remained empty—just endless darkness pouring down those circular walls. It was just me and the typewriter. And the fresh page it'd just fed into itself.

The keys began moving of their own accord—soft, deliberate, like a child sounding out a sentence. Typing a fresh entry to Alice's journal.

*Do you dream of her too?*

Those words. They must have been talking about Alice.

I looked back at the writing on the wall, but it was gone. Vanished.

... Had it ever been there at all?

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**October 13th, 1857**

*That night, the Hare returned.*

*He knelt beside me at the brook, head bowed, hat in hand. He apologized. He told me he had seen something dreadful in my father’s eyes. Not madness, but possession. A shadow curled too deep to dislodge. A flicker of the very Boogeyman he had warned me of—bleeding into the man who shared my roof.*

*He said he wanted to help me. That he could help me—if only I would make him better.*

*So I did.*

*I sat once more before the typewriter and laid trembling fingers on the keys. I thought of the Hare’s stammer, his gentleness, his failure. I thought of the blood on my tongue and the bruises on my skin. I thought of how badly I wished for someone not just to stand beside me—but to strike back in my place.*

*And I rewrote him.*

*Not as he was, but as he should have been.*

*I imagined a creature who stood taller than cruelty, whose voice rang not with hesitance but command. A being whose gentleness had curdled into cunning, whose whimsy was now warpaint. He would wear a hat still, for dignity’s sake. A tall one, stitched and proper. But he would no longer be just the Hare.*

*He would be both Hare and Hatter.*

*And also neither.*

*When I looked up, he was already there. Taller now. Sharper. His coat had grown long and threadbare. His smile no longer trembled—it cut. And though his eyes still held something of the creature I had loved, they burned now with a fever I could not name.*

*He thanked me.*

*And gave me his name.*

*Mister Neither.*

*The next day, he returned to the world with me.*

*We stepped from the trees together, and for the first time, I was not afraid.*

*Father saw me and stormed forward, his face red with fury, voice rising with self-righteous venom. He accused me of wickedness, of abandonment, of spite. He lifted a hand, intending to strike me again.*

*But then he saw Mister Neither.*

*And he faltered.*

*My guardian stepped between us, and in that moment, time seemed to shudder.*

*There are things I shall never be able to write with accuracy, only with ache. What happened next is one of them.*

*Mister Neither fell upon my father—not like a beast, but like a riddle too jagged to solve. He tore, he snarled, he laughed like broken clockwork, and my father screamed—not in rage this time, but in prayer. He called out my name again and again, begging for salvation from the very thing I had imagined into existence.*

*And I wanted to stop it.*

*I think I even tried.*

*But Mister Neither would not listen.*

*When it was done, my father’s heart lay on the grass, and my dearest friend wiped the blood from his fangs with the hem of my dress.*

*“There,” he said, with dreadful pride. “Now we can go back to Wonderland.”*

*But I could not go back. Not now. Not with what I had seen.*

*I told him as much. Told him he was worse than anything my father had ever been. That he had twisted my wish for protection into something monstrous. That I missed the Hare, even in his cowardice.*

*He did not argue.*

*He only said that I had made him mean.*

*And then he struck me.*

*Not hard at first. Just enough to shock. Then again. And once more.*

*But on the third, he hesitated.*

*And in that flicker of stillness, I saw something terrible: regret.*

*He pulled his hat low over his face to hide his gaze and backed away.*

*I rose to my feet. My dress was soaked in father’s blood, my lip split, and my soul aching in places I didn’t yet understand.*

*I told him to leave me.*

*Told him I hated him.*

*And I ran.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Mister Neither...

I'd never heard of any Conscript by that title. Given this journal was over a century old, I figured the monsters might be dead by now. Hunted down. Or even just forgotten.

That happened to legends sometimes\*—\*without enough audience buy-in, their presence diminished until they faded away entirely. Becoming less than a memory.

A tap.

On my shoulder.

I wheeled about, pulse thundering in my ears. My eyes swung left. Right. Even up to the cracked ceiling and all those hanging pages.

But there was nothing.

Chamber 13 remained as empty and silent as the moment the Jack had locked me inside of it.

I looked back at the typewriter.

Another page.

No click this time. No whir. It was just… *there.*

A date in the margin: **November 17th, 1857.**

I swallowed, sinking back into my seat. The words weren't written in black ink this time, but scarlet.

Bright as blood.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**November 17th, 1857**

*I threw myself before the typewriter like a girl returning to the only savior who had ever answered her prayers.*

*I struck the keys not for story, but salvation. And as I typed, I spoke so Mister Neither would hear every word. So he would know, even as he approached, what fate awaited him.*

*I wrote that Mister Neither—my creation, my protector, my mistake—left Alice and Wonderland alone. Alone. ALONE!*

*That he should never be a part of my story ever again!* 

*And I remember how he howled. How he begged. How his voice cracked in that awful, inhuman way. “We were supposed to be friends,” he sobbed. “Please don't abandon me—”*

*But the magic took him.*

*It surged from the machine like smoke and ache, wrapped around him like binding ribbon, and tore him from my room. Back to the forest. Back to the dark. Back to nowhere and less.*

*And when it was done, I collapsed into my mother’s arms.*

*“Oh, Mama,” I whispered. “He’s gone. Father’s gone. I’ve ruined everything with my foolish stories.”*

*But she did not cradle me.*

*She did not even weep.*

*She simply laid down another card in her eternal game of solitaire and said, with a voice soft as powdered dust, “That’s nice. How are your stories coming, dear?”*

*Her emptiness broke me in a way nothing else had. It was worse than a dead father. More terrible than a dreadful Hatter. It was a taunting reminder of my loneliness, that aching void within.*

*The next day, I returned to the brook desperate and weeping. But the threshold was gone.*

*Wonderland would no longer open.*

*Heartbroken, I returned home. Sat beside my mother as she hummed and played, and confessed, with more shame than I had ever known, that the typewriter would no longer make magic. I'd ruined it.* 

*She looked up—truly looked, as though surfacing from beneath deep water. Her eyes met mine, and for a moment, I saw her again. The woman who once told stories. The one who had loved me.*

*“It isn’t broken, dear,” she said gently. “It simply needs love, as all stories do.”*

*That word struck something in me.*

*Love. As though it were a spell I had long since forgotten how to cast.*

*I asked what she meant, but she was already drifting—retreating into her cards, into her haze.*

*And so I sat there, unmoving, as the weight of it all pressed down upon me. The silence had thickened into something bodily, and the typewriter before me—once my sanctuary, once my sword—lay quiet, cold, and hungering.*

*For I had no love left to give it.*

*All whom I had once entrusted with my heart had wounded me in return.*

*My father.*

*My mother.*

*Even the Hare.*

*Yet I suspected the machine did not care whom it drank from, so long as the love was real.*

*And so, with trembling hands, I reached out and took the only love I still possessed.*

*I guided my mother’s fingers toward the keys—fingers that had once plaited my hair, that had once written fables beneath candlelight—and I asked, in a voice softer than prayer, whether she still adored me as she once had,.*

*And in that instant—oh, that fleeting, golden instant—she smiled.*

*Her eyes found mine. Clear. Present. Alive.*

*“Of course,” she whispered, voice barely above breath. “I will love you forever, Alice.”*

*And it was then the machine began to stir.*

*It exhaled with a sound like ancient bellows. From within its belly unspooled long, glistening tendrils, that lashed outward with a hiss of rust and purpose. They curled around my mother’s wrist, and then they sank in.*

*Chewing.*

*Drinking.*

*The ribbon ran red with her blood, and the keys beneath my fingertips began to pulse with warmth, as though the very veins of the thing had been filled anew. The carriage jolted forward with an eagerness that felt almost reverent.*

*My mother groaned. Her spine curled. Her eyes dulled into porcelain.*

*And still, I wrote.*

*I told her thank you, though she could no longer hear.*

*I told her I forgave her—for the nights she did not come, for the cries she did not answer, for the bruise that stayed too long and the lullaby that never came.*

*I told her, too, that this was her fault, though I spoke it gently, for there was no cruelty left in me—only a child's sorrow made old.*

*But I promised her I would make it right. That I would take this grief and shape it into meaning. That I would grant her absolution in the only way I knew how.*

*I would write the ending my story deserved.* 

*And I would write it with my mother’s love.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Christ...

I gazed at the typewriter sitting there like some rusty ghost.

So it wasn't ink that this thing rang on, but love. No wonder it wouldn't work for me. The Ma'am had made sure any act of love was punished in the Crooked House.

Yet there was something about Alice's journal that I couldn't shake. She'd founded the Order back in 1867. That was common knowledge for employees. So was the fact that she vanished in 1902, suspected to have taken her own life.

And yet Alice's story felt strangely familiar\*—\*like it wasn't something I'd read, but something I'd forgotten. The voice. The rhythm. The way her words curled like barbed wire around childhood wounds.

I looked again at the name of her monster.

**Mister Neither.**

The Hare. The Hatter. A thing written twice, and broken both times.

How had the Order never mentioned him?

He wasn’t just another thing going bump in the night. He was the *origin* of this whole nightmare. The cracked foundation. Owens had mentioned him over the PA, hadn't she? Only she'd called him by a different title.

The First Draft.

I gnawed at my lip, pieces coming together. Whatever Mister Neither did to Alice—whatever she did to *him*—this is where it all began.

The Conscripts.

The Vaults.

The Order of Alice itself.

Mister Neither didn’t just start the story. He *was* the story. And right now, I was standing in his footnotes.

The only question now was: where did he go? Alice had banished him from her story. Did it kill him? Unmake him?

Or was he still out there? Grieving a girl who left him behind? Or had he—

**Click.**

The light overhead hissed.

Burst.

Darkness swallowed the chamber like floodwater.

A high, brittle giggle spilled from the walls. Too bright. Too childlike\*.\*

My chest seized. My wrist beeped.

**\[00:00\]**

Shit. 

Time’s up.

The typewriter whirred. The journal page suddenly ripped away, like the machine was devouring it. Like it was trying to cover its tracks.

*Shitshitshit.*

Emergency lighting stuttered to life. Sickly. Pale. Red. The room bled shadows; long, wet, and twitching.

And then—

**“Mister Reyes…”**

The voice was everywhere. It leaked out from the walls. The ceiling. It crawled out of my own mind. 

My name.

It *knew* my name.

Something moved.

A silhouette spilled across the floor like a spider learning to walk. The limbs too long. The ears drooping like funeral drapes. And a grin—wide and crooked—led the way.

It rose.

Towering. Splinter-limbed. Dressed in Victorian black, buttoned to the throat like a coffin lid.

It was him.

Alice's monster.

He swayed like a scarecrow hung too long in the wind. His grin twitched upward—too high, too hungry, like a shattered portrait trying to remember how to smile.

And he looked like the Ma'am's painting. The one I'd touched in my memory. The one that bled.

I scrambled back. Slipped.

He caught me—

Snatched me up by the collar, and I dangled like a doll in a child's grip waiting for the worst.

But he didn't attack.

Didn't even growl.

Just settled me into the chair with strange care, like a child putting down a favorite toy. The creature crouched at the far end of the steel table, motionless—almost reverent. Its slouching top hat veiled its face in darkness, but I saw enough. Tufts of fur were missing from its scalp, ears limp and twitching at its sides.

“I know you,” I said, my voice barely a whisper. “You’re—"

"M-Mister Neither.” It gave a short bow. "P-Pleased to meet you."

Its voice didn't sound like the snarling beast from the journal. Instead, it was gentle. Stammering. 

More Hare. 

Less Hatter. 

It reached into its coat pocket, arm vanishing deep past the elbow as ancient trinkets tumbled out—buttons, keys, scraps of burned paper. Too many things for any one coat to hold.

I screwed up my face, dumbstruck. Just a moment ago, I was certain I was about to be torn to shreds. “What are you looking for?” I asked.

It frowned, eyes hidden behind the brim of its hat. “A teacup,” it murmured, like that should’ve been obvious. “What else?”

With a delighted gasp, it withdrew a cracked piece of china and set it on the table between us like an offering. The porcelain was yellowed, rimmed with filth.

“Right…” I said slowly, hating the way my voice shook. “Can I ask what you’re doing here?”

It smiled—thin, off-kilter. “The t-typewriter woke me up of course.”

My eyes swiveled to the rusted behemoth atop the table. 

I blinked. "It... woke you up?" 

A frantic nod. “Oh yes. It likes you, I think. It hasn’t hummed like that since Ali—” Mister Neither suddenly clamped a hand to his mouth, wincing as if he’d nearly cursed. "Oh no. Oh no, no, no..."

Then its expression stuttered—glitched.

A tremor ran through its frame.

Something was wrong.

It yanked down on its tophat, hiding its button eyes. Light flared behind the veil of the fabric, like twin searchlights. It started to wheeze. Choke. That whimsical, stammering cadence began to twist, deforming into something dry and mechanical.

It gripped the brim of its hat, yanking it lower over its face. “No,” it rasped. “We a-agreed. I was to speak to him. You p-promised—”

Its body lurched. Bones cracked like gunshots.

The spine surged beneath its suit, bulging like a worm beneath silk. Fabric split at the seams. The frame beneath it grew taller, thicker. More wrong.

The smile stayed.

But it wasn’t his anymore.

“You already talked to him,” snarled a voice no longer touched by stutter or warmth. “*My turn.”*

I couldn’t move. My heart pounded like it was trying to escape my chest. I recognized this. The split. The sickness. *This was what Alice had seen.*

The Hare was gone.

Now just the Hatter remained.

It rose above me in a smooth, nightmarish glide, moonlight-eyes burning through the skin of its hat. Its teeth were no longer bucked—they were pointed now. Arrowheads. Fangs. The drooping ears shot upward, rigid as knives.

“Hello,” it said softly. “Care for a cup of tea?”

It set the teacup in front of me with eerie precision. I stared down into it, hands trembling. Not understanding. There wasn't anything inside of it.

I looked up at the Hatter, his rake-like form craning above. “It’s... empty,” I croaked.

“Oh? Look again.”

It grabbed a fistful of my hair and slammed my head into the table. Once. Twice. Again. The world became spinning metal and ringing noise. Something hot trickled down my face.

Blood.

Tears.

The Hatter lifted the cup and held it beneath my eye, collecting every drop. Then it dropped it back onto the table with a hollow *clack*.

I blinked blearily at the mix of red and salt, my stomach twisting.

“What… what is this?”

The smile didn’t change. It didn’t need to.

“Tea,” it said. “To bring you down the rabbit hole.”

I retched.

It wanted me to drink my own blood—my own tears?

“Hurry up and drink." He hissed, voice dropping to a growl. "*Unless you’d like some more*.”

My fingers closed around the chipped porcelain, hands shaking. I brought it to my lips.
