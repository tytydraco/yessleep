My sister’s husband has always been a nervous guy. He’s usually the first to arrive and the first to leave at every single event, the kind you’d see glancing at every corner and peeking around every bend before he made any kind of decision. He’s quiet and rarely ever starts a conversation unless it’s something dire, never picks up a drink, never engages that much outside the few family gatherings we still throw. He had always been that way, at least for the several years that he has been in our lives. 

One of my defining memories of him happened when I accidentally spooked the couple while they were coming home from the movies one night. Neither he nor my sister had been prepared to see teenage me sitting alone and playing video games on the floor of the dark living room, and I swear the guy almost fainted when Leah hit the light switch and I caught them mid-kiss. His eyes were bulging and his skin was as white as a sheet. Leah didn’t let me hear the end of that particular faux pas for weeks afterward. 

My parents were always apprehensive of Markus and his skittish nature, but I never really had any negative feelings about the guy. He and Leah met in college and had basically been joined at the hip in all the decades since. He always said he had no family and thus spent all of the holidays with us, waving away any talk about his upbringing or where he was born, even though he would occasionally get a bit of a twang in his voice if he spoke for too long. As far as I was concerned his biggest sin was just being a little awkward. He made decent money as a remote marketing manager and he treated Leah very well, so there was never any real worry on my end. I gave him a smile and shook his hand whenever I saw him. Sometimes he would even return that smile. 

He didn’t seem to have any close friends beside my sister, and so when I got a text from him one night a couple weeks ago asking to hang out, I was kinda surprised. My sister was out for a work trip, so I figured maybe the guy wanted to grab a beer with my buddies and I. I offered some times at our local bar, and he seemed open to them. 

The day before we agreed to meet, Markus sent me another message with a stranger tone. “Can we meet alone at that time? Leah’s flight is delayed because of weather. I need to chat with you.”

I raised an eyebrow at that, unsure of what to even think. “Yeah man,” I replied back. “We can chat. Your place or mine?”

“My place.” He responded immediately. “Thank you.” 

I sent a rain check to my buddies for the next day and immediately texted Leah to get her input. She sent back a shrugging emoji with a short message. “IDK, but he’s been kinda jumpy lately, more than usual. He keeps telling me he’s fine, so I’m not pushing it. Maybe he just needs some guy time?” 

This didn’t exactly make me feel better. I had no idea what Markus wanted to chat with me about. For the rest of the day my mind ran through endless possibilities from ball cancer to winning the lottery, and none of them sounded like news that I should be the first to hear. If he needed dude time, I guessed that the idea of a crowded bar with my friends might have been too much. I hoped I was overthinking it and he was doing his best to socialize, as best as a guy like Markus could. 

After my shift that Friday I changed out of my work clothes and texted my brother-in-law about dinner. He offered to pay me back for picking up burgers, and so I arrived at his and Leah’s suburban ranch about an hour later with a bag of fried goodies. The snow was falling softly around us, not enough to stick, but enough to keep it blisteringly cold and wet. I didn’t know what to expect when I ducked my head through the weather and opened the couple’s front door, but it wasn’t what I saw when I did. 

Every single light in the house was on, from the porch lights to the foyer’s coat closet to the bulbs lining the stairwell. From where I stood in the entryway I could see directly into the living room, where my brother-in-law sat nearly motionless in a leather armchair across from the TV. Some basketball game was playing, but he wasn’t watching it. His eyes were directed to the corner of the room, unblinking and watery. 

When the front door closed behind me those eyes darted in my direction. His smile was thin and there was no color in his face. “Hey Shawn.”

His voice sounded hoarse from overuse. I nearly dropped the bag of food at the sound of it. “Jesus, Markus. You okay? What’s going on?”

He paused, as if he were truly thinking over my questions. “No.” He finally whispered. “No, I’m not.” I didn’t know what to say in return–still stunned by the sight before me. “Set the food in the kitchen please…I’ll eat in a second.” 

I gave him a single nod and quickly made my way over to their kitchen, which was connected to the living room. I placed the hamburger bag on the counter and glanced over my shoulder. I didn’t know why, but the sight of Markus following me with his eyes made my stomach drop. He stared directly at my face from his spot in the armchair, and I recognized that trademark worry he seemed to always have, but it was so much worse than any other time I’d seen him. The guy looked downright terrified. 

I walked slowly and took my seat across from him on the couch, his eyes never leaving my frame all the while. Any hope I had of having a chill evening with my brother-in-law now completely gone. “Markus…what’s happening? Are you sick? Do I need to call someone?” 

“No, no.” He waved one hand in the air, dismissing the offer. “I’m fine. I just…I just needed some time.” He stared back at the TV for a bit, seemingly in deep thought. We sat in silence for at least a full minute. I watched him with a growing sense of dread. 

When he burst out laughing a second later, I nearly jumped out of my skin. It was a full belly laugh, the kind you’d hear from a man at the highest point in his life. His hands gripped the edges of the armchair, digging into the leather as he rocked back and forth. I swear to God I could almost see tears forming in his eyes. I had to pull myself together before I spoke. “Markus, I’m going to call the cops if you don’t tell me what’s going on.” My threat wasn’t genuine, and my voice cracked when I spoke, but it was enough to get him to stop laughing. 

He stared at his feet for a second before mumbling. “Sorry, needed to get that out. I just…I just know you won’t believe me, Shawn.” A twang was beginning to creep into his voice. It was more upsetting than it should have been. 

Markus was always odd and easily spooked, but not like this. I was half-worried that he was going to admit to having killed a man, and I was not cut out for burying bodies. “What won’t I believe? You’re acting like you’ve had a psychotic break.” 

Markus shook his head profusely. “That’s the thing, man. I don’t know if I have, or if I did.” The bags under his eyes weren’t a good sign. “I never thought I’d tell anyone the truth…never thought I’d get to this point, certainly not after I got married, moved away…” He trailed off at the end of that thought, hands still gripping the arms of the chair, face still rigid with fear. “Sometimes you just don’t know what the truth is, you know what you know, what you’ve experienced, you know?”

I’ve never been a therapist in any sense, and my friends always said I was a terrible listener, but in that moment I felt as if I was staring down a man on the last legs of a breakdown. I could practically see the cogs in his brain fizzing and malfunctioning. The tension floating in the room was thick enough to choke on. Looking back, I probably should have called someone or at least looked up some therapy speak by then. I was so put off by his behavior that the possibility didn’t even enter my head. The mystery of it all clouded my judgment. 

If nothing else I thought that I was someone that could get him out of this strange funk–we were brothers after all. He had said he needed to chat, and so a chat was going to happen. “Tell me about it, man.” I spoke evenly and quietly. “Whatever you need to get off your chest, I’m here for you.”

Markus’s eyes searched my face, and I did my best to appear neutral and understanding, even though I was completely uncomfortable. Regardless of whether or not I was successful, he took a deep breath. “I’ve never told anyone this story.” He whispered. “I moved away from my small hometown the first chance I got, I got a degree, I was lucky enough to meet Leah, I’ve got this picture perfect life, I turned forty this year.” He chuckled darkly at the end of that list, but I did not know why. “It’s something I never thought I’d have to talk about ever again, but that’s the thing about some nightmares…they never really end. You don’t really wake up.” 

I took in everything he said and sat with it for several seconds before speaking. “You wanted to tell me a story?”

He nodded once. “I have to tell someone, Shawn. I thought that I could bury it, but I can’t do that anymore.” His tone was resolute, as serious as death. “I’m sorry, but I couldn’t tell Leah. She’s already half-convinced I’m a day away from the psych ward. She’s supportive, but…” His entire body shivered. “You’re the only other person I could think of.”

I bit down on my unease for a second–I had already made up my mind that Leah would be getting a call from me following this conversation, but I still nodded and gave him my own thin smile. “You didn’t kill someone, did you, Markus?” I’m not even sure if I was trying to make a joke, but the moment it passed my lips I knew it was the wrong thing to say.

Markus froze. Those fizzing cogs in his brain seemed to die completely for a moment. His lips opened, then closed, then opened again. “No…” He practically mouthed the word. “No, I…” He closed his arms around himself, as if protecting his stomach. When he spoke, his words were cold and direct. “Please. Just listen and don’t talk, okay?”

If I felt bad before, I was feeling terrible then. I was anxious and not in a particularly good mood to be hearing another man’s dark life story, but I figured in that same second that there wasn’t ever going to be a time when I’d be ready for something like that. 

I made a couple mistakes that night, but the smartest thing I did happened right there. While Markus was looking away, I started a video on my phone. It was sitting on the arm of the couch with the receiver pointed towards him. If anything went down…I might have something recorded.

I nodded. “Go on.”

Markus turned to the basketball game on the TV. The second half had just started, and it captured his gaze entirely as he began to speak:

“It was almost exactly thirty years ago. I was ten and I lived in a trailer at the edge of a farm. My grandparents owned the farmland and they let my mother rent the trailer we lived in. She was a single mother and they never approved of her, so they gave her the dregs of what they owned while she busted her ass at the 24/7 breakfast joint down the road. I grew up running in and out of their house and being resentful that my mother wasn’t around to play catch with me like Grandpa was.” He shook his head, groaning at the memory. 

“There was a forest down the hill we lived on, a scraggly patch of woods that nobody ever cleared out. We were so far out in the country. The air was muggy and all the trees sagged as a result. Miles away, the river and the lakes broke off into a small creek that ran from the base of the hill into the woods. Aside from that there wasn’t anything but fields. The school bus ride was a doozy–it always cut into the school day by an hour or two, just trying to get across all that farmland. My grandparents grew tobacco and made a decent profit while there was still decent profit to be made. They lived a median lifestyle, but it was flashy to everyone else in Ewing, where kids often came into school from the morning picking schedule with dirt on their palms. Grandpa and Grandma were saving up for my college, something that was unusual for anyone in the area. 

I shared a bunk bed with my mother in that godforsaken trailer and it was always too hot to sleep. I would sometimes sneak out to sleep with them and watch late-night specials in the main house, and Mama would always be upset in the morning.”

At that point in the story, I watched his bloodshot eyes begin to well. He blinked away the tears before speaking again. 

“My best friend was a boy named Ryder Poole. Across my grandparents’ house on the other side of the road was where the Pooles lived in their four-room house. His dad, Wyatt Poole, did business with my grandfather and his mother, Lissa Poole, helped cut tobacco when the tobacco was ready. Ryder was short, blonde, and kinda chubby, he was a year older than me but a foot shorter. He shared a bedroom with his younger brother Jed and sister Lily who were just as blonde and short as him. He and I would go off into the cornfields during the summers before school began and he would tell me about how daddy drank too much and hit him. His mother didn’t do a fucking thing about it, not that she could have, I guess. Ryder got it the worst because he was the oldest and the most likely to cause trouble.

I was too young. I knew how my grandfather yelled at my mother, and even my mother or grandmother would spank me in my worst moments. I would listen to Ryder and feel bad and in the next breath we would fight and wrestle like most boys. We would end our friendship over minor things and come back together not even a week later when one of us had a new toy or something we’d recovered in the lost-and-found bin at school. Sometimes Jed would hang out with us, but I remember that he was whiny and he cried a lot. Ryder was always in a bad mood when he was there. Lily was a toddler, and I never really saw her.

But when the weather was good and we weren’t fighting, Ryder and I would sit down by the creek bed and we would poke at little fish or throw rocks. It was so quiet down there, with only the sagging trees nearby and occasionally the sound of the birds on the wind. My mother always warned me never to go past the first tree into the woods, and we honored her for the most part. 

In the hottest months we even swam in the water, but none of our parents were too happy about that. One of the few spankings I ever received from my Grandma happened when I tracked mud over her kitchen floors after an afternoon spent splashing Ryder with creek water. It was so humid outside all the time–and the heat was intolerable even at night. Those were the nights I really upset my mother. I remember throwing full-body fits that I couldn’t sleep in the main house with Grandma and Grandpa’s air-conditioning.

It was during those days we would spend most of our time hunting crawdads. I think up north they’re just called crawfish or crayfish–can’t remember. They’re little crustaceans, and they’re mainly out during summer when the creek water is warm. They’re nocturnal, but if you knew where to look for them, and we did, you could poke some out during the day or early evening. Ryder and I were avid crawdad hunters–picking them from their hiding places to throw in a bucket for one of my Grandma’s legendary crawfish boils, ones that she would hold for the seasonal guys each summer. 

They always made these weird little clicking sounds, like crickets, hissing a bit whenever we yanked ‘em out of the water. They’re not venomous, but those pincers can be sharp enough to break skin. I had my toes pinched plenty of times, and it wasn’t the least bit fun. That added a bit of danger to the art that we very much enjoyed as boys. Those tasty little suckers were probably the only reason my mother tolerated us getting so close to that creek in the first place, and she never allowed us down there after dark.”

Markus paused. He leaned back against his chair, as if trying to steel himself by cramming his body into the leather. I had to lean forward just to hear what he was saying. His voice was barely a whisper. 

“I was ten, like I said. I remember that my mother and I spent half of my school’s fall break at a local hotel just to get away. She had saved enough money to treat me to a decent dinner and some time to ourselves. When we returned Grandma and Grandpa let us stay in the main house without so much as a word. I was stunned, but it felt like my vacation had extended. They bought me whatever I wanted for dinner and let me run around the house. We played games and watched movies late into the night. I thought a switch had flipped. It was only a few days after I returned to school that I realized Ryder hadn’t shown up with the rest of us.

I would ask my mother if Ryder could come over and she would turn away from me before saying that he was going to be out of town for a while. I would sit on the front porch of the main house and stare across the street to see when he would return, but I never saw a flash in any of the small windows of the Poole household. 

His dad’s rusted truck never came back to the driveway. I never saw Lily poke her head through the screen door or Jed playing with his cars on their rickety front porch. Thanksgiving came, then Christmas, and I didn’t see my best friend during that entire time. I don’t remember the smaller moments, but I do remember that at some point I stopped asking Mama when Ryder would be able to come over.

I was drinking apple juice next to Grandma and Grandpa at the kitchen table while we played cards on December 26th of that year. There was a call on the landline that my mother answered. I remember hearing a woman sobbing on the other end, her voice filled with so much anguish that it made every hair on my body stand up. My grandparents took us into the living room to finish our game, but I will never forget the sound of her voice…the sheer horror in her cries, the tears on my own mother’s face when she joined us. I didn’t ask her what that was. I never asked her. It was entirely incidental in my mind, I just thought it was strange.”

Markus could not stop the tears this time. His eyes were burned and painfully red, shot with tears as he continued to stare at the TV screen, entranced by the moving colors as his mouth continued to pour out words. I stood to hand him a tissue from a box on the coffee table. He took it, dabbing at his eyes as his expression crumpled for only a moment. His face straightened, but his eyes remained puffy and wet. 

“Markus, what–”

“Stop.” The bitterness in that one word stopped me dead in my tracks. “I said, you have to let me finish. Don’t talk.” 

My question vanished on the spot. I couldn’t even remember what I was about to ask. I only gave him a short nod to continue. 

He sniffled, wiping his face with the tissue before tossing it down on the carpet. “Christmas became New Year’s, and I returned to school in the winter knowing nothing about Ryder’s whereabouts. Their four room house on the other side of the road fell to waste and my Grandpa told me that they had moved away. I was angry because I thought my best friend had abandoned me without so much as a word. I relayed that same information to everyone else in my schoolroom who asked, telling every kid who brought up his name that he had blown me off completely. The teachers, who must have known, didn’t show it. They shushed us and told us not to speak ill of people who couldn’t defend themselves.

January became February and I had nearly put the whole ordeal on the back burner of my mind. Down in Ewing, we never got real winter, not like we do here, but that year gave us a miracle frost that nobody had seen in the county for at least a decade. The creek bed was frozen and the trees were dotted with ice for a good part of those months. I was thankful that our trailer finally wasn’t boiling hot, but it wasn’t very helpful for playing outside. Grandma took advantage of my days off school to get some help with chores in the main house. I was bored out of my mind. I remember…I remember that I wished something would happen.” 

Markus turned away from the TV, but he still wouldn’t look in my direction. The shakiness had started to affect his speech, and he stared at his feet as he cleared his throat. This set off a coughing fit, and it took him several more seconds to choke it away. 

“The night it all happened I was lying awake in the trailer on the bottom bunk. Mom was working a night shift at the diner. Grandma and Grandpa were asleep in the main house. I was wearing Mario pajama pants and an old elementary school t-shirt. I was having trouble sleeping and I didn’t know why. I had barely begun to doze off when I heard a knock. 

My eyes opened immediately. It was a hesitant kind of knock, and one I didn’t recognize. Mom had a loud knock whenever she forgot her keys in the trailer. Grandpa and Grandma’s knocks were sudden and short. I sat up in bed and looked towards the front door. ‘Mama?’ I called out, but nobody replied. 

The knock came again, but a little more insistent. After a few seconds, a chill ran down my spine when I realized where it was coming from. I turned around to see the trailer’s back window. I didn’t know what I expected to see, but it certainly wasn’t what was there.

Blinking in the darkness of the trailer, I felt my body grow cold as I saw the outline of Ryder’s face against the glass. One hand was pressed palm-forward on the window, and the other appeared behind his back. The window was low enough, but he still appeared to be stretching to reach its height, standing on his tip-toes in the cold grass. I blinked several more times, convinced that he was just an illusion. ‘Ryder?’

‘Hey Markus,’ He grinned. He had lost one of his front teeth during a school yard brawl some months ago, and he whistled the S in my name while he spoke. ‘Wanna go hunt for crawdads?’

I was happy to see him, but I was also confused and annoyed. ‘Where have you been?’ I asked, jumping up from the bunk and almost smacking my forehead on the wooden frame. ‘You moved away and didn’t even tell me you were going!’

Ryder’s smile disappeared. ‘Sorry–didn’t know I was leaving.’

I pressed my face up against the interior side of the glass, until I could see him eye-to-eye. He looked the same as ever from where I stood. ‘Coulda called.’ I grumbled. ‘Landline works just fine.’

He rolled his eyes. ‘My Mama doesn’t let us touch the phone, you know that. You were at my house when she yelled at me for prank-calling Mrs. Devers!’

That memory made me snort. ‘Yeah.’

‘So are you coming out or what?’ He pressed his other palm to the window, bouncing up and down as if he were still straining to stand tall. ‘The creek ain’t frozen anymore, and the crawdads are out. I miss your grandma’s stew.’

‘Wait, how did you get here?’ I blinked slowly, still shaking off my sleepiness. ‘Did your mama drive you?’

Ryder got a pained look on his face, but it was more irritation than anything else. ‘You keep askin’ these dumb questions. Mama hates driving. I walked here same as I always do.’

‘You didn’t move far, then?’

‘Nope, but that don’t mean it was easy.’ The grin returned. ‘Now do you wanna hunt crawdads or not?’

I remember standing there and weighing my options, as logically as a ten year old could manage in the dead of night with no sleep. My mother was still working the night shift, and my grandparents wouldn’t notice from their bedroom in the main house. I wasn’t too excited to leave my bed that late, but it wasn’t a school night, and I had been awfully bored these last several weeks. 

I was tired, I had missed my friend, and the idea of splashing around the creek that late was pretty tempting. Mama would never let us wander away from Grandpa’s property when it was this dark, but I figured the crawdads would probably be swarming. ‘Okay,’ I finally told Ryder. ‘But I’m gonna put my coat and boots on first, and you gotta tell me where you’ve been.'

Ryder’s grin widened, and he backed away from the window before vanishing around the side of the trailer."

End of Part One//Didn't realize these things had a character limit, but I'll make a second post with the rest of that transcribed story soon.[Pt.2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mb0pe0/crawdads_pt_2/)
