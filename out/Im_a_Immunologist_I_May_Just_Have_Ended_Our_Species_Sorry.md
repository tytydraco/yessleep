I’d like to start off with an apology. If I am correct, I may just have killed you and everyone you know. Hopefully that isn’t the case. But if it is, sorry.

I’ve been working as an immunologist for the past 17 years, and I’m quite well known for my work. Throughout my life, I’ve lost people I cared about to disease. My mother died from tuberculosis when I was 5, my best friend died of leukemia when I was 16, and my father has recently been diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. I’ve always viewed it as a malicious and evil thing that robs us of our family and friends.

It’s for this reason that I chose to study the immune system. It’s truly a fascinating thing. Our bodies are somehow incredibly resilient and terribly delicate at the same time. My goal was to contribute to the eradication of disease. Well, I suppose the same can be said for all immunologists, but I worked with a fiery hatred for pestilence and sickness. I wanted, in a sense, to get revenge on the being I had made up in my head- this evil figure I had conjured up to personify disease. 

I was after more than just one. I didn’t want to be the man who ended cancer or AIDS. I wanted to rid humanity of the greatest threat it ever had. My goal was to end as many diseases as I possibly could with one strike. I’ll keep my explanations as brief as I can, I know you didn’t come here for a science lesson. 

The human immune system is incredibly complex and has a vast array of countermeasures it uses to kill off pathogens. However, this all relies on the first step of the process- recognition. In order for anything to happen, some immune cell needs to come into contact with the foreign body afflicting the host. This can be any number of cells: T-cells, B-cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells, the list goes on. Once this happens, receptors on these cells bind to specific surface proteins on the pathogen which starts the next step of the process. The pathogen is engulfed and digested. Afterwards, the cell takes pieces of this now dead pathogen and brings it to other immune cells to activate more immune responses. 

After a long list of signaling pathways, the host produces antibodies which bind to the pathogens and flag them for destruction. Later, when one of the many killer cells encounters a pathogen marked by antibodies, it will be swiftly eliminated. This process can apply to all types of diseases: bacterial, viral, even cancers. So, why can't we just synthetically make a bunch of antibodies and shoot them into sick people?

Well, there are many reasons, actually. But one of them is the issue of immune response recognition. When your immune system goes out to kill targeted cells, how does it know which cells are good and which are bad? The answer is a molecule called sialic acid. Your cells produce this on their surfaces so that even if an immune cell binds to them, it can recognize the sialic acid structures on the surface and move on from it. 

But some diseases, disgusting and vile as they are, have evolved to use this to their advantage. Some of the most dangerous diseases are able to coat themselves in sialic acid in order to evade immune detection. For example, influenza binds to sialic acid on respiratory cells to gain entry into your lungs. Some bacteria, like Neisseria meningitidis, actually steal sialic acid from their host to create a disguise. And one of the reasons cancer is so difficult to treat is that cancer cells overproduce sialic acid, effectively wearing a **“**do not kill**”** sign that prevents immune cells from recognizing them as threats. This allows all of them to go about their business killing innocent people and spreading to others.

To combat this, humans have developed a treatment for, one mainly for cancer, using sialidase- an enzyme that breaks down sialic acid from molecules. Think of this as a chain saw that cuts off sialic acid and allows the bad cells to be recognized by your immune system. There is only one problem with this; sialidase is not specific. It will rip off sialic acid from your own cells if it comes into contact with them.

But in this enzyme, I saw the key to free us all of the burden of sickness. If I could use a vehicle to ensure that sialidase only comes into contact with non-self cells, I would be able to strip away their advantage and expose them to the immune system. And I had the perfect one. 

It feels strange to condense years of my life and hard work into just a few sentences. In my studies, I became deeply familiar with the measles virus—an endlessly fascinating entity. You see, measles causes infected cells to fuse together, forming massive clumps called syncytia. If I could modify the virus to carry the sialidase enzyme, these clusters would become their own undoing. As the cells fused, sialidase would strip away the sialic acid from all of them at once, leaving them completely exposed to the immune system’s wrath. That’s exactly what I did.

It was tested on rodents a week ago and it worked perfectly. But, when I tried to get this new treatment approved, I was shot down almost immediately. I was outraged. I had invented a way to eradicate a plethora of life threatening diseases and this miracle cure wasn’t even going to be considered? Unfortunately, I took matters into my own hands. This drug was going to save my father, I knew it.

So, I went to the hospital he was being “treated” at. He’s been spending most of his time sleeping, cancer has a way of draining energy from its victims. I injected him with my treatment quickly. He didn’t even wake up. Satisfied, I left the hospital and headed to the lab. The rats needed feeding and then I could finally relax at home. 

Only when I saw the rats did I realize my error. In my fervor to create this miracle cure, I had made the same mistake that the human immune system does- I hadn’t been specific enough. My goal was to make the measles virus, with sialidase attached to it, bind to any foreign bodies and force them to clump together. This would then allow the enzyme to remove the sialic acid from all of the pathogens and allow them all to be recognized by the immune system. But sialidase isn’t specific. It had shorn off the protein that causes the measles virus to bind. The result of this was a free floating virus that could bind to any cell and shear off its sialic acid, making it a target for the host’s immune system.

The rats in their cages had partially liquefied, their bodies reduced to a putrid, gelatinous slurry. Only a few fragments of bone and shredded tissue remained, barely recognizable as what had once been living creatures. A rancid mix of blood and dissolved flesh pooled at the bottom of the cages, the stench thick and suffocating. 

Without another thought I rushed back to the hospital, back to my father’s room. But it was too late. I’m not sure why, but it acted quickly. Far more so than it had with the rats. My dad had woken from his sleep with agonizing screams. Blood ran from every orifice- his eyes, his nose, his ears, and mouth. He reached out a semi-solid hand towards me. I could see the veins and muscles through his skin. As he reached out, his hand fell from his arm and splattered onto the floor by my feet. His now milky white eyes rolled into his skull as he fell back into bed, motionless. His torso caved in on itself, exposing his liquified organs to the open air. His body was eating itself because of what I had done.

Nurses and doctors rushed in and out of the room but I knew they wouldn’t be able to help. An older nurse grabbed my arm and led me outside, but I couldn’t hear his words. My ears rung from what I had seen, what I had caused. I vomited in the flower bed. 

I didn’t know what else to do, so I went home where I’m now drafting this up. There’s one more detail about the measles virus that I didn’t mention- it’s highly contagious. In fact, in unvaccinated populations, it has a 100% infection rate. Not that a vaccine would help anymore, I’ve modified the virus to the point where a new vaccine would need to be developed. But, judging by how fast it worked on my father, I don't think we have that kind of time. Every single one of the people who were in that hospital likely have it, me included. 

By tomorrow, hundreds of people will be infected. A week from now, thousands or more. But chances are I’ll be dead by then.

 I truly hope I’m wrong. But if I’m not, I really am sorry.
