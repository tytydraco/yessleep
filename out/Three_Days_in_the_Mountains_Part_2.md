\[Part 1\] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1f348x7/three\_days\_in\_the\_mountains\_part\_one/)

When I finally woke up, I was still in the driver's seat of my truck. Everyone else was sleeping, aside from Greg, who wasn't in the truck. The rain had stopped, but a thick, gray fog had surrounded us. I couldn't see a full five feet around us, and began to worry about Greg. I sat up in my seat and looked around for any sign of life, but didn't see a thing, so I stepped out of the truck, closing the door quietly so I didn't wake the others. I stepped to the front of the truck, where I saw the pool of Mark's blood at the base of the tree, chunks of his flesh and broken teeth strewn about, and my knees buckled. The night's events came crashing back and I felt tears coming.

"Try not to throw up, yeah? It smells bad enough out here." I heard Greg's voice. When I looked up, he was sitting on the ground, just on the other side of the pool of blood.

"Did you get any sleep man?" I asked, and he shook his head. I didn't blame him.

"What the fuck happened?" he asked me. There was desperation in his voice, like he needed some kind of rational answer.

"I don't know man. After he crashed the truck, I talked to him, he shoved me off my feet, when I got up to follow him, he was bashing his head against the tree." I said. I felt sick, remembering the image of his shattered and torn jaw. I looked up at the tree and saw it had been marred by Mark's head. The bark was broken and scratched, likely by bone and teeth smashing hard into it. How the fuck had he managed to bash himself that hard into the tree without just knocking himself out?

"What did he say in the truck?" Greg asked. He seemed worse now than he had a moment ago.

"Something about us being 'Just the beginning' and said we were all 'Fodder'. I don't know what the fuck he meant." I replied. It still didn't feel real. His blood was all over my clothes, all over the ground in a pool and a trail leading to the truck, and on the tree itself, but it was like my mind refused to grasp what had happened. I felt like I was watching a fucked up movie.

"Fuck. Did he take something? Bea was screeching about the deer not being human, and tried to say 'I told-ya-so' after that. Maybe they both took some shit and got way too fucked up." Greg said, now completely defeated. Mark's death didn't make any sense, and it never would, and that crushed him.

"We should probably head out soon. I don't want to be here any longer than we need to be." I said, and somehow he looked even more depressed.

"I walked down the road a ways a few hours ago, when the rain first stopped. The slot canyons below are completely flooded. Probably five feet of water. It'll be probably a full day before it drains away, and then we have the mud to contend with." he said. I had never seen Greg look so utterly hopeless. I sat down where I was standing, just outside of the blood. We had to find a way back down, or we'd all go insane. If we hadn't already.

"What do you think we should do? Maybe gather as many supplies as we can and hoof it back down? We can avoid the roads till we get back down to this canyon called Showerbath. It's got a paved road, used for transporting cattle mainly, but it won't be nearly as flooded, if it is at all." I said. I knew the canyon connected to Tusher canyon, the one we'd driven up to get here, because I'd checked the maps pretty thoroughly when I was researching the trip.

"Maybe" Greg said, starting to stand "Let's wait for the others to wake up, we'll see what they say." With that, he walked to the truck. I sat for a while. I tried not to stare at the blood, but I couldn't help but glance at it. Fuck fuck fuck. The whole word was upside down. I started to hyperventilate again when I felt a hand on my shoulder. I turned around to see Mike, an incredibly sad smile on his face.

"There's nothing you could've done, Jason. I'm sorry you had to see it." he said. Jesus Christ he'd lost his brother and was trying to comfort me? I stood and hugged him, tightly.

"Don't worry about me dude. You don't have to be making everyone feel better about this. Let us help you on this one, okay?" I said. As soon as I'd finished, he began sobbing again. I felt his legs give out, and I just held him up.

"Why the fuck would he do that? We were fine man! Everything was okay! I don't fucking get it!" he managed to get out between sobs. I just held my friend for a while. Nobody else left the truck during that time, but I could see they were awake. I knew that once Mike was done, we'd need to get a plan going. We were NOT staying on this mountain any longer.

I explained my idea to the group once Mike and I had gotten back in the truck. We all agreed that we needed to get to town as quickly as possible.

"We can take the truck as far as it'll go, and then hike along the tops of the slot canyons until we get to Showerbath. Once we're there, it should be easy enough to make it to town. We're gonna have to leave a few things, but we'll take whatever we can." I said. Everyone seemed to agree it was the best idea, and began discussing what we'd take with us, when Bea finally spoke.

"What about Mark's body?" she said. I was kind of baffled. No question, we were taking him with us. No fucking way we were going to leave him.

"We're going to carry him down, obviously." I said, a little annoyed she'd even bothered to ask.

"How? He's two hundred and fifty pounds of literal dead weight!" she said, getting angrier than she deserved to get.

"Don't fucking talk about him like that! I'm not leaving my friend up here goddamn it!" I yelled back. I was getting ready to say more when I felt Mike grab my shoulder.

"We can't carry him for seventy miles. He's too heavy. It's October, he'll be comfortable enough, and once we get down the mountain, we can send for help up here. Then he'll come home, okay? I won't leave until I'm with him." he said. I didn't protest, despite my wanting to. Maybe it was that I felt guilty. I hadn't stopped him before he could hurt himself, and I didn't want to let him down again by leaving him on this fucking mountain.

"Alright. Let's make a list of things we can take while we're going in the truck. We should be able to make it about six miles before everything starts getting too bad to drive on, assuming we can move the truck still." Greg said. He'd voiced worry about it earlier, but I was pretty sure it wouldn't be a problem. I cranked the key to start it, and it fired up immediately. I pulled back from the tree and straightened out on the road. The fog had thinned a bit, and I could see about twenty feet in front of the hood now. It would be slow going, but it would do the trick, save our feet some miles.

"Alright we know what we're taking and who's carrying it. Jason, do you still have a gun under the seat?" he asked. I'd forgotten about my grandfather's old hunting rifle I'd kept under the seat. I hadn't taken it out in years.

"Yeah, it's there. Should have a few boxes of ammo with it too." I replied. He nodded back.

"Good. We should take it just incase we run into any wild animals. I don't feel like fist fighting a mountain lion." he said, and I agreed. One death was far far far more than needed. We drove slowly for a while, before finally coming to a spot where water was cutting through the road. It had dug a trench into the dirt around five feet across, and it looked to be around two feet deep. I stopped the truck and we all got out to load up at the back. Ricky loaded up a pack with food and water bottles, as did Erin and Bea. Greg and I grabbed sleeping bags and one tent. It was small, but it would have to do, we were almost certainly going to make camp again. I also grabbed my gun. Mike and Carrie got matches, knives, rope, and the first aid kit. After everyone was kitted out, I locked the truck, we all said goodbye to Mark, and started walking, when a sudden realization hit me. With all the chaos of the previous night, I hadn't noticed it before, but I noticed it now.

Where was Tom?

"Ricky, where the fuck is Tommy?" I asked, a crushing feeling in my chest. I frantically looked around for him, but he wasn't with us. Everyone else had the same revelation and we frantically started calling for him.

"Tommy where the fuck are you?" I screamed. Oh God no. I couldn't lose another friend on ethis fucking trip. Please please please God don't let him be hurt.

"When did you see him last?" Greg asked, calm, but clearly tired of the fucked up shit we'd been dealing with.

"When we crashed into the ditch. I don't remember seeing him after that." I said. Carrie spoke up and said he was next to her when they got out of the truck to come see what had happened to Mark.

"So we know he was out here at one point. Maybe it was all a bit too much for him and he ran off. It was fucking crazy last night, and we were all focused on Mark. We should go back and look for him." I said. Everyone agreed, except for Bea.

"He's already dead. We need to move." she said, coldly. I couldn't believe my fucking ears.

"Fuck you! How fucking dare you say that about him, you heartless bitch!" I screamed. I'd had enough of her shit. Since last night she'd been nothing but a fucking problem with her bullshit about the deer. I started towards her, still yelling.

"You don't get to lose your fucking mind and then decide that we leave my best friend for dead, got that? You wanna walk on? Be my fucking guest, and good fucking riddance." I walked right up to her yelling, and when we were nearly face to face, Erin got between us.

"Enough! No fucking fighting right now! More important shit is happening!" she yelled. I looked at her, looked at Bea, and shoved past.

"I'm going to look for Tommy. If you're coming with me, let's go. I'm not waiting around." I said. I heard footsteps behind me as I walked, and soon Greg, Rick, Mike, and Carrie were all next to me. Bea called after us;

"You're all fucking dead unless you come back. That thing is gonna kill all of you!" I turned back and glared at her.

"Fuck you, Bea. And you Erin? You wanna leave Tommy behind too?" I said. Erin looked horrified at the suggestion.

"I want to make it off of this fucking mountain alive!" she said. Rage was filling me at this point.

"And fuck Tommy, right? He doesn't need to make it back, so long as you're okay. Fuck both of you!" I yelled. Rick put his hand on my shoulder.

"You need to calm down man. They're just as scared as we are. It'll be fine." he said, trying to comfort me.

"Yeah, just as scared, but too fucking cowardly to help Tom. Fuck 'em." I said, and fell silent. Maybe I was being harsh, but we'd already lost one friend, I wasn't going to lose another.

We walked for about three miles before we saw any kind of clue as to his location. A scrap of the blue shirt he was wearing the night before.

"Fuck. Scraps are never a good sign." Rick said. I felt anxiety pang through me as we approached the scrap. There was blood on it. Not much, but there was blood.

"Oh fuck. We've gotta find him, now." I said. Greg nodded and looked down at the ground.

"There's a small blood trail. We should follow it and see where it leads. It looks to be going north, but I could be wrong. Where do you want to check?" he asked me. I decided to go north, following the trail as best we could. Eventually, there was no trail, but the grass had give way to mud, and we had footprints.

"Alright, we can follow these now. Shouldn't be long and we'll find him." said Mike. We followed the tracks for maybe seven hundred feet when something changed. Tom's prints weren't the only ones anymore. Another set of prints, ones that looked like goat hooves with human toes, came from the side and fell in perfect lock step.

"What the fuck kinda animal makes tracks like these?" said Mike. He had stooped down to take a closer look, and seemed completely ignorant on them.

"I have no idea, but we'd better hurry. Whatever it is, it's tracking Tommy." said Greg. We all started to jog rather than walk. After around ten minutes of this, the fog had stated to clear, and we were travelling up a gentle slope. I thought it must've been near the summit that was just north of us, and we picked up the pace even more.

"God don't let us be too late." I said under my breath as we ran. I couldn't lose anyone else.

We reached the top, breaking through the fog as we did. There were still clouds above us, but we could see the other mountain tops peaking through. I looked around for a moment, but saw nothing. The grass had come back, and we'd lost the prints, but they'd been working their way up here, so we knew he couldn't be far. That's when I saw something in the corner of my eye. Tall, almost completely black, aside from some white and red near the top. I turned to look, but it was just a deer, grazing in the grass. Bea's bullshit must be getting to me, I thought as I kept looking around for any sign of Tom. My eyes passed back over the deer, and something caught my eye about it, something I hadn't noticed before.

There was blue cloth hanging from it's antlers.

"Guys, look." I said, pointing out the deer to the rest of the group. They looked at me confused.

"At what? "said Carrie.

"The fuckin' deer!" I said, pointing and feeling a little annoyed at their act.

"Dude what are you talking about. Do you need to sit down?" asked Mike. He placed a hand on my shoulder and squeezed. I blinked hard, and the deer was gone.

"I must be tired is all. Sorry guys." I said. I wasn't tired, and I know what I saw, but I couldn't let them, or myself, think I might be losing it after the things I'd said to Bea.

"Well, I don't see much. Might be worth it to call out for him." said Greg. So that's what we did. After a few minutes of screaming our lungs out, we hadn't seen hide nor hair of Tom.

"Fuck!" I yelled "Where the fuck is he?" Just then, I heard something. It was distant, but it sounded like crying.

"Do you guys hear that?" I asked. Everyone fell silent for a moment. We all looked at each other for a moment before breaking out into a mad dash down the Eastern side of the summit. We made it back into the fog, and then we were surrounded by trees. I made my way towards the crying, not taking note of where the others were. I had to get to Tom.

"Tommy! Where are you! It's Jason! Rick, Greg, Mike, and Carrie are with me!" I screamed as I ran towards the sound.

"I'm here!" I heard him yell back. His voice sounded harsh, like he'd been screaming all day. I ran even harder.

"I'm coming!" I shouted back.

"I'm here!" he said. The crying had gotten louder, but it hadn't mixed with the sound of Tom's voice. Was there someone else with him? I wondered this as I broke into a small clearing in the trees. What I saw there made me stop dead in my tracks.

Tom was in the clearing, and he wasn't alone, but he wasn't the one who had called back. He was on the ground, sobbing, with his back turned to me. In front of him was a horrible creature. It stood at least ten feet tall, covered in black fur, with the skull of a deer for a face. Its eyes glowed a horrible shade of red, and it had large, pearl white antlers covered in  what looked like velvet at first glance, but on closer inspection was almost certainly human skin. Its body was humanoid and muscle bound, with long, sharp claws at the end of its fingers, and goat legs, with toes at the end of its cloven hooves. It looked at me and uttered "I'm here" in a disgusting, wrong imitation of Tom's voice. My knees buckled and I fell on my face, quickly rolling over and scrambling along the wet ground to get away from it.

"Tommy! Tommy!" I heard Rick yelling as he burst through the trees off to my right. He stumbled on his way towards Tom, smacking his head hard on the ground. He wasn't moving, and I feared he'd hit his head on a rock.

"He-lp m-eeee" the creature uttered. It was no longer trying to imitate Tom. It was unmoving, aside from the deer skull opening and closing as it spoke. I reached for my gun when Tom stood up and faced me.

"The things it is going to do to us are far worse than death, Jason. The Lord of the Wood is upon us, and we can't do anything but tremble in fear. We are but the beginning. Those who follow are the true feast." With that, he dug his hands into his wrist, ripping through skin and flesh, and began to pull something out. I screamed for him to stop, but he didn't. He pulled and pulled until the stings in his hand snapped. Blood exploded from them and I realized he'd pulled out his fucking blood veins. He crumpled to the ground, and the beast began to move towards him.

"Don't you fucking touch him!" I screamed, and fired a round from my grandfather's old 30.06 right into the skull. The bullet hit it's mark and a piece of bone shattered off. The monster turned to me and began walking slowly. I reloaded the bolt and fired again, hitting it in the chest. Black ooze crawled out of the bullet hole, and the creature let out a horrid sound, like the noise of a dying rabbit trying to imitate laughter. It reached me and bent down close to my face. It's breath was a rancid combination of rot and sewage. I nearly threw up just from the smell, but I managed to hold it back.

"Do n-not inter-fearrrr agai-n. There is- an or-der. Do n-no-tt ma-ke me break it." the creature uttered. It's voice was like crunching gravel and shattered glass. It moved away from me and back towards Tom. It had just reached his limp body when Mike came charging at the beast, hunting knife drawn. He screamed as he reached it and plunged the knife deep into it's back, ripping it down through it's flesh, causing the beast to let out an earth shattering roar. It turned around and picked up mike by the head like you'd grab a cork opener. And then Greg was with me, picking me up off of the ground.

"We have to fucking run." he said, but I couldn't. My strength was gone, and even if it wasn't I didn't want to leave them.

"Fucking run!" I heard Mike's muddled scream from inside the monster's paw. I looked over to him just in time to hear his quickly muted screech of agony and witness as the beast grabbed his legs and ripped him in half. The sound was a mixture of tearing and the snapping of tendons as muscle separated from bone. Blood and viscera spilled onto the grass and fallen leaves. I heard Carrie scream behind me. I tried to get away from Greg, kicking, slamming my head back towards him, anything and everything I could. I thought I could still save Tom. I had to. Mike had died trying, and I couldn't let that be in vain. I couldn't just leave them.

"We've got to fucking go!" Greg screamed "They're already dead, and we can't fight that fucking monster!"

I understood what he was saying, and didn't at the same time. Mike was gone, that was certain, but Tom was still there! He was hurt, but we could save him! Make a tourniquet with my shirt and a stick, tie it off above the wound, and haul ass back to the truck! We could make it! I knew we could!

"Rick! Get the fuck up man! We've gotta go!" Greg shouted. I looked over, remembering that Rick was in danger too, and saw him sitting limply. It seemed that he'd gotten off of the ground just in time to watch Mike die. He slowly turned his head to look at us, tears streaming down his face.

"This can't be real." he said flatly. His mind was broken, and it was my fault. Why did I have to come here? We could've just stayed at home and partied for a weekend. We didn't need to go fucking camping, and now so many of my friends were dead. First Mark, now Tom and Mike, all in horrible, horrible ways. I made a choice then, one that still haunts me to this day.

"Greg, let go of me. Leave me here, take my pack, get Rick, and run. No one else has to die because of me. Just get them all home safe." I said. "I'll need my gun still, but I'm not leaving until that fucking thing is dead. You guys need to run"

"What the fuck are you talking about? I'm not leaving you, you fucking idiot!" Greg yelled back at me, still trying to drag me towards the trees. I mustered up one last push of strength and managed to break free of his grasp. I turned to him, and tossed my backpack of supplies at his feet.

"Go, now. Ricky isn't going to get up, but he won't fight you either. Run, now." I said, and walked to where my rifle lay on the ground. The beast was still standing in the same spot, devouring Mike's remains. I felt sadness and fear filling my body, before a raging anger took my body. This fucking thing had killed my friends. I couldn't beat it, no fucking way, but I could hurt it, I could distract it long enough for the others to get away.

"Jason, don't be a fucking idiot!" Greg yelled, but I ignored him as I racked the bolt of the rifle and aimed. I fired a shot into it's skull again, quickly racking another round and firing into it's chest. And another, and another, and another, until the ammo ran out. It hadn't even turned to me, still holding Mike's severed leg, chewing flesh and bone together. I reloaded and kept firing. I looked behind me for a moment to see that Greg and Rick had both left. Good, I thought. They can get away. I turned back to keep firing, and the beast was down on all fours, less than an inch from the muzzle.

"Y-ou haaa-ve inter-f-feared for the l-lllast time." it spoke. I went to fire again, but it grabbed the barrel and shattered the rifle in it's grip. I backed away, trying to make some distance, but it moved too quickly. It didn't fully close the gap, but remained that same fixed distance away. I pulled my pocket knife from my jeans, raised it above my head, and plunged it into the eye socket of the beast. It screeched and slammed it's open hand into me. I felt bones shatter as it made contact, and several more breaking as I smashed into a tree. My vision tunneled, and I was sure I'd pass out, probably die from my injuries soon, or end up devoured like Mike had been. I didn't care. I deserved to die for bringing this onto everyone.

"Fuck you." I said with what little venom I could muster. Just as my vision began to fade fully, I felt the creature pick me up, its large hand wrapped around my torso. Pain shot through my body as it squeezed me, waking me up and causing me to scream at the agony.

"Y-you willlll no-t d-ie yet." it said. It squeezed me again and dropped me back to the ground. My mind was blank from the white hot agony in my body. I could barely comprehend what was happening. I just kept thinking, please, please just kill me. But death didn't come. Still hasn't.

Before I knew it, the creature had dragged me across the ground and placed me face-to-face with Tom. I began to cry again, when he blinked. Holy shit he was actually still alive.

"Tommy! Oh my God. I'm so sorry for all of this. I'm so so so sorry." I said, choking on tears as I did. He smiled at me and placed his hand on my face. I could see the tattered remains of flesh on his arm.

"This isn't your fault, Jason. It was meant to be. He wanted us here, and so we came. Don't you see? I'm sorry you couldn't die before this. You're going to suffer more than any of us will for standing in his way." he said. I felt my blood run cold, and pain gripped my chest even worse than before. Tom was broken. Even if he'd survived, what would it matter? He was just going to try again, and we wouldn't be able to get him help in time.

"Tommy, please, just stop. I want to see you, not whatever this thing made you into, before we die." I said, now sobbing. The movement of my chest as I cried was agonizing, but I couldn't stop.

"We? You don't get to die, old friend. You gave that privilege up." Tom said, tears running down his face. Then he moved his good arm to his mouth and bit down, ripping the flesh and veins away from his bone. I screamed as I saw the tendons snap, the blood pour out, and the light leave his eyes. Blood was pooling around us both now, and I closed my eyes. Tom was smiling, and I couldn't look at that bloody smile.

"Now, sl-sleeeeep." I heard the monster say from behind me, and my vision faded. Within seconds, I was asleep.

I woke later, unsure how much time had passed. I was laying on my back, staring at the stars. For a moment, I couldn't remember how I'd gotten there, and enjoyed the beauty of the night sky, gazed at through a gap in the dark clouds. That moment ended when I felt rain on my cheek. Everything came flooding back. The storm, Mark, Mike, Tom. Oh God, why was I still alive? And how long had it been? Had the others gotten away safely? I tried to sit up, but was unable to when my body flashed with searing pain. I fell back to the ground and screamed. Fuck fuck fuck. How was I supposed to get out of here? My head was spinning as I stared up. I tried closing my eyes and letting the dizziness fade, but it wasn't fading. I turned my head to the side and felt something brush against my nose. I opened my eyes to see what it was, and screamed. Tom's severed head was sitting up, with that same smile, same chunks of flesh between his teeth, but no eyes. The fucking thing had taken his eyes. Deer antlers were stuffed into his skull to give the appearance that they were growing out of his head.

"Jesus fucking Christ!" I screamed, tears coming again. "Why the fuck is this happening?" I was screaming into the cosmos, begging for some kind of God to answer. Anything, just tell me what the fuck we did. Why did my friends deserve to die? Why did I deserve to be tormented? My mind was breaking and I couldn't grab at the pieces fast enough to stop it. I needed to get away, but I couldn't move, not for the pain, or for the mental disaster I was dealing with.

"Please, just let me fucking die!" I screamed at the sky, eyes shut as tightly as I could keep them. I just wanted it to end. I didn't want to be here anymore, and I had no way of doing anything. I just wanted the nightmare to be over.

"Jason!" I heard coming from the trees. It was Rick's voice. I opened my eyes and craned my neck to see in the direction it was coming from. I started begging God, please tell me we're finally getting out of here.

"I'm here Rick!" I hollered. "I can't move! I need help!" I heard his foot steps coming, and felt some of the panic fade. If he was okay, maybe everyone else was too.

"Shit! That thing fucked you up man! Glad you're alive!" I heard him yell as my consciousness began to fade again. I saw his face come into view just before everything went dark.

He was covered in blood.
