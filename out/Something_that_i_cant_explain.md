My name is Damon. I’m 24 years old, and I live alone in a modest house on the west side of Des Moines. I’ve always believed in the supernatural—ghosts, spirits, things beyond our understanding. But I never thought I’d encounter something *real*... something that would make me question everything.

It started about two weeks ago.

I’d come home late one night after a long shift, the streets quiet beneath the cold Iowa sky. My house looked normal from the outside—nothing out of place—but as soon as I stepped inside, I felt it. A heaviness hanging in the air, like the house itself was holding its breath.

At first, I blamed the stress. But then the noises started.

Footsteps in the hallway when I was the only one home. The faint creak of floorboards that stopped whenever I turned toward them. Cold spots that made my breath fog in the dead of summer.

I tried to shrug it off as the house settling or my mind playing tricks, but I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched. Like something was lurking just beyond my sight.

One night, I was sitting in my living room, scrolling through my phone, when I noticed the corner of the room darken unnaturally. I looked up, heart pounding. There, just beyond the edge of the lamplight, was a figure.

Tall. Thin. Shrouded in darkness.

It didn’t have a face—only a void where one should be. But I knew it was looking at me.

I froze. The air grew colder, the silence pressing down on me like a weight.

Then it moved—slow, deliberate, sliding closer like a shadow stretched thin across the floor.

I wanted to scream, to run, but my body betrayed me. I was rooted to the spot.

The figure stopped just inches from me. I could feel its presence—like a chill that crawled under my skin, squeezing my chest.

And then it whispered.

Not in words, but in thoughts—dark, fractured images flashing in my mind: fear, loneliness, loss. It showed me my deepest insecurities, my regrets.

I snapped out of it and bolted toward the kitchen, grabbing a knife from the drawer. When I turned back, the figure was gone.

For the next few nights, it came and went, stalking me through the rooms, watching from the shadows. I tried to record it, but my phone always died or the footage was nothing but static.

I researched. I talked to friends who dabbled in the occult. Everyone told me the same thing: it was a wraith, a restless spirit feeding on my fear.

Last night was the worst.

I was trying to sleep when I felt cold fingers grip my ankle. I kicked out, heart hammering, but no one was there. Then the whispering started again, louder this time.

I couldn’t understand the words, but the meaning was clear: *You belong to me.*

I grabbed my keys and fled the house at dawn, not looking back.

But I know it’s waiting. Waiting for me to come home.

And I’m not sure I want to.
