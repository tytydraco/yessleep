I worked as a security guard for a year after being kicked out of my mother's house. What I saw will forever haunt me.

When I turned 18, my mother kicked me out. She always thought I was useless and secretly hated me. We never got along, and she often told me I was a burden. I tried to help around the house, but it was never enough for her. On my 18th birthday, she packed my bags and told me to leave. I had no choice but to find a job quickly, and I ended up as a security guard at a hotel.

The job wasn't glamorous, but it paid the bills. My main duties were to patrol the hotel, check security cameras, and make sure guests felt safe. Most nights were quiet, but one night changed everything.

It was a cold, dark night. I was doing my usual rounds when I heard a scream. I rushed to the source and saw a young girl, maybe 14 or 15, being dragged into an all-black pickup truck by men in black outfits and masks. The girl was terrified, struggling and crying for help. I ran towards them, shouting, but one of the men pointed a gun at me. I froze, helpless as they shoved the girl into the truck and sped off.

I quickly called the police and reported the kidnapping. They arrived and started an investigation, but it didn't lead to much. The cameras couldn't catch the truck's license plate, and the men were impossible to identify with their masks and black clothing. I felt so guilty and useless. I replayed the scene in my head over and over, wishing I could have done something to save her.

The image of that terrified girl haunted me. I couldn't stop thinking about what might have happened to her. My sleep was filled with nightmares of her pleading eyes, and I felt a deep sense of dread every time I saw a black pickup truck. The fear and guilt consumed me. I started having panic attacks and found it hard to focus on my job.

I tried to talk to my supervisor about what happened, but he just told me to toughen up and get back to work. I felt so alone. I didn't have anyone to turn to. My mother certainly didn't care, and I had no friends to confide in. The trauma of that night stayed with me, making it hard to trust people or feel safe.

Eventually, I couldn't handle it anymore and quit my job. But leaving the job didn't make the memories go away. Every time I close my eyes, I see that girl's face. Her fear became my fear, her pain my pain. It's been years since that night, but the horror of what I witnessed is still fresh in my mind.

The experience of working as a security guard and witnessing that kidnapping has forever changed me. I am more anxious, more fearful, and I struggle with feelings of helplessness and guilt. I hope that one day I can find peace, but for now, the memories continue to haunt me.
