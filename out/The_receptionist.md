Goodnight. 

It’s 3 am, and as usual, any sound gets on the way of my attempts of getting any rest. No matter how many pills I take. 

I’m writing this so my experiences get stuck somewhere different than in my mind. Medical advise. To anyone who may find and read this: mind there is no other reason behind. I mean no harm to anyone. I can only advise you to stop reading. However, if you do so after this point, consider yourself warned. 

It was a rainy day back then. Just like tonight. As some might know, I had no reception. I gave those same ones the heads up that I’d be rather isolated for a couple of days max. 

Those who received my messages later, told me that I described the place as if it was made of stone. I can’t remember, but apparently, I said that the wooden building was like “frozen in time”. I used those exact words.

The lights inside were on. Although it was a rather dark day, I messaged my friends saying that they were “a bit of an overkill”. A detail that the detectives took note of during the first interrogation.

I got many questions asked about my conversation with the so-called receptionist - the man I made the booking with -, and I can’t remember what that exchange went about. I remember however that something was off about his voice. His tone and attitude were also weird. I can’t really describe it because, again, I struggle to remember. But it was awkward. I don’t know if it was due to the distortion, but what stroke me as so weird about his voice, was how reminiscent of mine it was.

I can’t tell whether I was or not wondering of that right before going in back then. I probably was. However, as soon as I stood foot in there, my concern became the smell… I can still smell it now. I can do so through the chlorine, the cleaning products and the air freshener of my room, because it’s nowhere out there, but inside my head.

My friends told me, that I sent messages about how there was no one in reception. And about that stench. I blamed it on the toilet of the first floor, as the door was open and was a short meter and a half from the desk. I can’t remember about that last bit, but how I wish I could forget that awful smell…

They also told me about the TV. That TV… A horror movie was on when I reached out to ring the bell.

From that moment on, the memories become clearer. To my dismay.

I rang the bell a couple more times, as no one was showing up to handle my keys over. I think I went out and back to make sure the address and name of the place were right, because the smell came back to me once and again.

In the meantime, the actress was hiding from the killer in the film. I clearly remember. The next time I rang the bell, her whining seemed to me to leak beyond the screen.

Some of you out there, may already know what happened next… This is all about getting things written down, however, so here I go.

As I gave that bell a last ring, I heard that very same whimpering, but this time, there was no characters on the screen.

I… I need a second. My heart stops every time I remember this.

I engaged in the hunt of the moan, holding my breath. Placing every gram of my feet very quietly on the floor. Suddenly, the stench and the sound made sense in my head. I could tell both were coming from the other side of the front desk.

I can’t remember whether I rushed over the counter to check for injured people or if I peeked over the edge all shaky.  I’m no hero, nor a coward. But I wasn’t ready either. And I’ll never will.

I’ll spare you the details, besides the exceptionally relevant. I don’t want to cause harm to any unsuspecting reader. But that… man… This… This is so hard.

I didn’t know it right then. But the way I found him, wasn’t all that different to how I myself was found a couple of days after. That scene, the foul smell… and the sound he made when I rang the bell when I tried to approach him. I don’t want to remember… But I have to write it down:

This man was chained to the counter for what it seemed to be a long time. His face was covered with an old, ragged flannel. His breath hissing though the fabric.

As I got to learn afterwards, this stranger’s mind was in pieces by the sound of the bell on the counter.

After taking all this information in, my memory went blurry again. According to the messages I sent, I wasn’t sure on how to react. I didn’t know if this person was the same I had a conversation with earlier through the phone. Whether there was someone else in the building. I couldn’t tell if I was in immediate danger myself, therefore if it was sensible to assist him at all. Despite this all, due to how things unfolded, I must have had managed to set him free.

The next thing I remember before I blacked out is something that’s a fresh source of nightmares: those eyes full of joy, that suddenly lock with mine, rabid, right the moment after this stranger heard my voice. I woke up later on coughing profusely and enduring a stinging pain in my eardrums.

Such stinging pain was the bell. Someone was beating the hell out of it.

My throat burning with the simple act of passing air. My swallowing reflex gatekept by an excruciating pain.

It was the stranger… The stranger… was ringing the bell. Wildly. His eyes, locked with mine once again, sadistically. And he rang… rang… rang.

I thought I’d faint again, but the cough and the bell ringing where there to prevent me to do so. And that’s how he kept me awake. That’s how he… tortured me.

I know that they say it was a couple of days before they found us. But that bell kept me from any kind of rest for what felt like months, and it will keep on ringing in my head, waking me up once and again, no matter how far away it is now, sitting in silence.

The stranger made an attempt of escape on my own car. They told me that they found it crashed a few curves ahead. He was found alive but unconscious a couple of meters from the accident.

My friends have been leaking me information about the case. I was told that the stranger was taken to hospital and then to a mental health facility due to his poor mental state. After many attempts of dialog, the only thing they managed to get from him was the phrase:

“The receptionist”.

My friends have been struggling to access to more details. Though I’m begging for them to figure out at least one more thing for me:

In confusion, they heard me asking to please compare the stranger’s voice to mine if they could.
