As a woman of science, I feel really stupid saying these things or asking for help, but things are getting to a point that I can’t explain them away. I need help. I don’t know what to do, and I’m afraid for both my safety and the safety of my coworkers. Sorry for the length; there’s a lot of context that I had to include for this to even make a little bit of sense. 

I work as a psychologist at a historic mental hospital in the central Texas area, and lately one of my long-term patients has been starting to act out of character. I’ll call her Eve – I can’t use her real name for HIPAA reasons. Fourteen year old female diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder (bipolar type) and DID. Quick list of her symptoms for any fellow shrinks:

* Mood swings, usually accompanied by attempts at isolation
* Auditory and visual hallucinations
* Rapid speech
* Psychosis 
* At least four other identities (I’ll talk more about them later – they become important)

Her parents refuse to get her tested or put her on medication, so she’s kind of become a permanent resident. I guess a mental hospital feels safer to her than her own home, which, as sad as it is, is probably where she developed the disorders in the first place. When she’s lucid, she’s as sweet as can be and smart as a whip. We’ve formed something of a friendship over the eight months she’s been here, and a lot of my coworkers have remarked at how much calmer Eve is when I’m around her. Because of this, I’ve never really seen her when she’s in the midst of an episode – either I’m off-call when they happen, or she calms down whenever I start talking to her to de-escalate the situation.

But recently she seems to be getting worse. Since the hospital I work in was originally built around the late 1800s, it’s in need of fixing every twenty years or so. This time, the higher-ups have decided to completely renovate the entire facility, which probably is for the best – we don’t really have outside spaces for patients to spend time in, the windows are smaller than they should be, and it’s not uncommon to hear the drip-drip-dripping of suspect liquids coming from the attic or see the old hallway lights flicker on and off. Things can get pretty spooky during night shifts, but I’ve gotten used to it for the most part, and it can be fun to prank my more superstitious coworkers when October rolls around. 

Anyway, Eve keeps talking about the renovations going on and how the construction workers are thinking too loudly, or that the foundation is angry at being disturbed. Nothing really different from her usual symptoms, but it seems to be happening more often, and with more intensity. I refer to the voices that she hears/apparitions she sees as “NPCs”, and lately, there seem to be a lot more of them. Typically she hears the voice of a little boy she calls Billy and has visual hallucinations of his supposed twin sister Audrey. Eve calls them her younger siblings. They’re sort of like imaginary friends to her, and I’ve come to the conclusion that for the time being, it would do more harm than good to try and remove them from her psyche. But she’s been mentioning several other people recently, new people that she’s not talked about before. I can’t keep track of all the names, but I do have a handful of them written down somewhere. I’ll have to dig around and see if I can find the list, because some of the names sounded familiar. 

She also has a handful of other personalities that “take over” when she’s having a particularly difficult time. Through hypnosis and regression therapy I’ve been able to identify three so far:

* A five year old girl named Harriet who loves pudding
* A teenage girl a little bit older than Eve who goes by Vivian. My theory with Vivian is that she’s the girl that Eve wishes she was, with kind, loving parents and the happy childhood Eve never got
* A fifty-something man by the name of Clive who sounds like a chainsmoker and seems to think of Eve as a daughter. A bit creepy at times in the way that older men tend to be, especially towards myself and other female doctors/nurses/orderlies, but does seems to care about Eve

Here are some of the treatments I’ve already tried. Eve’s case is difficult - its severity means a lot of the medications only work some of the time, even on the highest dose. Plus, she can be pretty resistant to taking medications during her more manic periods.

* Paliperidone (the only FDA approved medication for schizoaffective disorder)
* Cognitive behavioral therapy
* Lithium and oxcarbazepine 
* Group and individual therapy
* EMDR
* Hypnosis and regression to access the other personalities

None of these personalities are particularly violent or aggressive, but Eve seems to have developed a fourth identity that is becoming increasingly agitated and has caused her to start lashing out. It’s not super common for a patient to develop more personalities outside of traumatic events, so I was pretty concerned. The CBT and hypnosis seemed to work best with her before this fourth personality manifested, but now her symptoms are nearly uncontrollable at times. It doesn’t track with any kind of diagnosis I know of. 

The first time she expressed this personality, Eve just said nasty things to me – the standard threats and sexually violent phrases that come with these kinds of personalities. Nothing I couldn’t handle by temporarily putting the personality to rest and ending the session early. But then she started saying some scary stuff about things she shouldn’t know about. We always record our therapy sessions, both for posterity and to keep track of progress. Below is a transcribed record of the second therapy session where this fourth personality made itself known. My hands are sweating and I’m on edge just from typing this up – the way her voice changed, the way her face shifted…it’s like nothing I’ve seen before. 

**Dr. Martin:** It’s the fifteenth of May, 2024, at 1500. My patient right now is \[redacted\]. In our last session, we did a few rounds of EMDR, and practiced our reminders and mindfulness. \[redacted\] is doing great with the latter two, but is still resistant to the EMDR. Today we are going to try and talk a bit more with the person we made contact with last time we did hypnosis. Does that sound okay, \[redacted\]?

**Eve:** Yeah, that sounds good to me. I’ll still get my pudding even if they say anything rude, right? Harriet really wants some.

**Dr. Martin:** \[laughs\] Of course you’ll still get your pudding. \[a faint rustling is heard as I shuffle my papers around, looking for my hypnosis script\] Are you ready?

**Eve:** I’m ready when you are!

**Dr Martin:** \[my voice becomes low and soothing, each word more calming than the last\] Everything is peaceful and relaxed. Let yourself sink into the chair as each of your limbs releases one by one. You are safe here, and you can come back at any time. Now take some big deep breaths for me. 

\[several seconds of silence\]

**Dr Martin:** You are sinking down and shutting down, sinking down and shutting down, deeper and deeper and deeper, until you are completely, utterly relaxed. Are you relaxed?

**Eve:** Yes.

**Dr Martin:** Good. Is there anyone inside of \[redacted\] who wants to come talk? Now is the time. 

**Eve:** \[her voice becomes more high-pitched and childlike, with a little bit of a lisp\] Hi Doctor Martin! Thank you for the teddy bear! I named him Mister Muffins and he’s my best friend.

**Dr Martin:** Oh hi Harriet - I’m glad to hear you like Mister Muffins! Do you know if the fourth person inside you is wanting to chat? The one whose name we don’t know yet?

**Harriet:** I don’t like him. He says mean things to me. And he’s scary, too. He doesn’t belong in here with us, Doctor Martin. 

**Dr Martin:** I know, sweetie, and that’s why I want to talk to him. I want to understand why he’s being so mean to you. Can you ask him to come say hi?

**Harriet:** I’ll try, but I don’t know if he wants to talk to you. 

\[several seconds of silence as Eve goes quiet, before a new voice sounds out – it sounds like a man but seems to shift tone, as if it can’t quite decide what it wants to sound like\]

**???:** And what is it you wanted this time, false doctor?

**Dr. Martin:** Is this the person I spoke with during the last hypnosis session?

**???:** Ah, so hypnosis is why I have been seeing through these eyes. These lovely, doll-like blue eyes. Their innocence makes the world seem brighter, you know. It hurts a bit, all that brightness. I am not used to it yet. 

**Dr Martin:** What are you used to, then?

**???:** \[a sigh, long and deep and strangely foreboding\] I do not think you would like to know the sights I am used to, my dear. Your fragile, estrogen-filled psyche would not do well with the information. 

**Dr Martin:** I’m not quite sure what estrogen has to do with this. What’s your name? Why are you inhabiting \[redacted\]? 

**???:** Oh, but it has everything to do with this, Doctor. Do you not know that what the female mind lacks in fortitude, it makes up with gullibility and compassion and \[an inhale, as if smelling something\] pure sex. It’s an electric combination that makes you so much better suited to be homemakers and caretakers and whores. 

**Dr Martin:** Sounds like you have some outdated views on feminism, my friend. And you didn’t answer my questions. 

**???:** Oh, this child? She simply was an easy mark – her poor, poor mind was already shattered wide open, leaving plenty of cracks for me to sneak in through. Much like your own mother, yes? Did she not have her own cranial companions? Ghastly voices nobody else could hear?

**Dr. Martin:** \[uncertainty leaking into my voice\] I…where did you learn that? 

**???:** She and I are dear, dear friends now. I just *adore* her and her mad ramblings. She talks about you all the time, you know.

**Dr. Martin:** You have no idea what you’re talking about. My mother is dead. 

**???:** Oh, yes, she wept and wept in agony as she slipped her head into that noose and let herself fly. If only you had been there to prevent it, hmm? I can smell your guilt; it is eating you alive, even all these years later. \[a short, crowing laugh\] My goodness, false doctor, it’s as though you’ve seen a ghost! I told you that you could not handle my way of seeing this world. 

**Dr. Martin:** Tell me your name, or I’m ending this session right now. I don’t have time for these theatrics. \[my voice had a tremor to it by now, even though I fought to hide it\]

**???:** I think not, my dear. That would ruin the fun for all of us, now wouldn’t it? We must save some revelations for later. 

\[Eve gasps, and her voice returns to normal as she is catapulted out of hypnosis\]

**Eve:** What just happened? Doctor Martin, are you okay?

**Dr Martin:** \[shakily\] I’m…I’m okay. The person I was just talking to was not very nice. Did…did you pull yourself out of hypnosis just now? 

**Eve:** No. It’s like I was taking a really nice nap, and all of a sudden, I’m back here. It was weird. That’s never happened to me before.

**Dr. Martin:** I’ve never seen anything like that. \[pause\] \[redacted\], you don’t happen to know anything about this woman, do you? \[I show her a picture of my mother that I keep on my desk\] Her name was Jaquelin. 

**Eve:** \[shakes her head\] No, I don’t. She’s pretty. Why do you ask?

**Dr. Martin:** No reason, just curious. Let’s get you to crafts hour, okay? That was a lot in one session; I’m proud of you. 

**Eve:** Aw, thanks! \[a pause punctuated by my footsteps as I walk over to the recorder\] I’m sorry about whatever he said, Doctor Martin. 

**Dr. Martin:** It’s alright, honey. Why don’t we- \[the recording ends here\]

I don’t know what to do. I’ve never told any of my coworkers about my mother, and I would never tell a patient lest it triggers them. I sent emails to some colleagues of mine who specialize in extreme pediatric cases, but I have no clue when or if they’ll respond, or what they’ll even say. I won’t lie – I’m more than a little freaked out. Superstition has never sat well with me, but I can’t deny the twisted allure of a supernatural explanation to all this. 

Thanks so much for any recommendations or suggestions y’all might have. I’m really worried about Eve and I just want to help her. She’s a sweet kid, and I don’t want to see her struggling like this. I’ll update y’all if I hear back from any of my contacts.
