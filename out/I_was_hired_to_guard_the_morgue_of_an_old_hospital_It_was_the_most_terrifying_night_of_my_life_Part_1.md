I’ve worked as a security guard for the last eight years of my life. It’s not the highest paying job in the world, and, like many professions, it comes with a certain level of risk. But it’s paid the bills, and more importantly, it’s helped me afford to go back to school in order to obtain my degree. Due to a few dumbass mistakes as a younger man, I never completed high school; I always said I was not going to die without being the first person in my family to finish schooling and go to college. And because the security company which employs me hires us out to whatever company, corporation or building needs them, I’ve found myself guarding some truly interesting places. Without giving exact names, I’ve guarded a rather well-known tech company’s HQ, more than a few shopping malls, countless storage facilities, and even a federal government building for a few weeks, to give some examples. I’ve occasionally dealt with having to run off the occasional trespasser, but, in what must be a massive stroke of good luck, never anything worse. And I’ve always received glowing commendations on my work, along with requests to be hired again.

  
However, there is one place that, no matter how many times I’ve been asked, and how much money I’ve been offered, I will never work at again.

  
Darby Hospital, which is what I’ll refer to it as in lieu of its real name, sits atop the highest hill in my town, overlooking all 34,000 of its residents. Built during the art deco period of the 20th Century, it is far larger than the town has need of, and designed for a population boom that never came. Because of this, many parts of the building have either not been used for decades, or simply never used at all. Having frequently been forced to take many trips there due to stupid dares and attempts to show off as a teen, I more than once got turned around in the maze-like corridors, only managing to find my way back to the in-use areas by luckily stumbling across a wall mounted map. Let me tell you, to call the place creepy, would be like calling the *Andrea Doria* disaster a “small blunder”. The worst time to be inside is late at night, when only a skeleton crew of doctors and nurses remain on-call, and most of the lights have been dimmed or shut off. And the rumors of it being haunted do nothing to help quell the eerie ambience.

  
But the creepiest part of the hospital, by a country mile, is the morgue.

  
Housed in its own dedicated building, it sits a few hundred yards away, permanently in the shadow of a cluster of huge pine and oak trees which tower over the edge of the property from the forest beyond. It connects to the main building via a long, underground passageway which allows bodies to be moved to it, out of the sight and mind of the patients and guests above. From the outside, it looks almost more imposing than the hospital itself, and kept all but the bravest of us away.

  
This is where I found myself, working the graveyard shift one fall night three years ago, after accepting a last-minute position for some much-needed overtime due to the lockdowns putting most of my normal gigs on hold.

  
A little after seven in the evening, I pulled my battered Mercury Comet into the expansive, but largely abandoned parking lot. Parking next to a Jaguar I assumed had to belong to the head doctor or surgeon on duty, I got out and craned my neck back to stare up at the towering behemoth. My eyes wandered over the many windows, most which were dark. The few that were lit up were spaced apart in such a pattern that they almost gave the impression that the hospital had a face, complete with blazing eyes and eerie smile. I involuntarily shuddered, remembering what Colin, my best friend’s older brother had told us long ago around a campfire. *It’s always watching, you know. Day and night, it’s always watching and waiting patiently. Waiting to lure its next careless victim in so it can swallow them up*. I shook my head to force away the memory, feeling more than a little irritated with myself. *Get real, Tony. You’re thirty-two years old; are you seriously telling me you’re still spooked by those dumb as hell tales? You’ve got a job to do, and they’re more than likely getting impatient waiting for you, so move your ass!*

  
Pushing the last remnants of Colin’s whisper from my mind, I flipped up the collar of my coat to protect me from the wind and walked up the path to the main entrance. After making sure my name tag was visible, and pulling on the required mask as ordered by the sign, I pulled open one of the two large wood and glass doors and stepped inside. The chilly autumn air was replaced by the familiar, yet equally miserable chill that hospitals are known for. *Well, looks like my coat’s staying on tonight*. My ears were met with the sound of old, easy listening music softly filtering out from speakers set around the massive reception lobby. After a moment’s listening, I recognized the tune as an instrumental version of *Beautiful Dreamer*. Aside from that, though, the reception area was silent. Silent and, surprisingly, empty. I crossed quickly to the reception desk, my footfalls echoing loudly off the walls and bouncing away into the adjoining hallways. Reaching it, I leaned to look over it. A cup of coffee sat next to the computer monitor, steam rising from the dark liquid. Which meant the nurse stationed up here had to have only just stepped away. *Likely called away to assist the on-call staff in the ER. With how understaffed they keep this place, it’s no wonder people regularly request transfer, especially now.*

  
Glancing down, I saw a small brass bell to my right on the counter next to the sign-in ledger, and after a moment’s hesitation, I rang it. Like my footsteps, the shrill, metallic *ding* echoed away for a moment before, like my footsteps, being swallowed up. I waited for few minutes, then rang it again. Still nobody appeared. I glanced at my watch, noting with slight annoyance that my shift was supposed to have started five minutes ago. I let out a sigh. *I’m gonna get docked for that, come pay day*. Taking a deep breath, I called out into the expanse. “Hello?” My voice drifted away, bouncing off the walls and answered by no one. I spoke again. “Nurse?” Still nothing. I felt the slight pang of irritation grow as the music continued. “Hello, *anybody*?”

   
After a few moments of nobody responding, I let out a small, frustrated snort. “You know what, screw this” I muttered. Snatching a pen from a metal cup, I quickly signed my name in the ledger, along with my job title. On the side, I quickly wrote a small note. *Waited here for almost eight minutes, nobody showed. Getting to work, I’ll find my own way down*. Tossing the pen down, I walked around the desk and took a few steps towards one of the hallways. And stopped as a chill suddenly shot up my spine, accompanied by an unknown sensation. For a moment, my mind attempted to process the feeling. Then, with a stomach dropping realization, it hit me.

  
It was the feeling of being watched.

  
Another chill passed through me as I slowly turned to look behind me. The lobby remained as empty as when I’d entered, and yet…it no longer felt that way. I quickly scanned the walls, half expecting to see a security camera aimed directly at me; I often got the feeling when someone was staring at me through one. To my surprise, though, there were none. At least, none I could see. My eyes shifted to the double doors leading to the east and west wings on either side of the room, half expecting to see a face in the narrow sheet of glass. But they remained empty as well. Yet the feeling still remained. I began to feel thoroughly creeped out as the old stories pushed their way back into my mind. The music was not helping in the slightest; *Beautiful Dreamer* had begun to begun to repeat itself, the song now almost seeming to hold an eerie, almost foreboding atmosphere instead of the calm and soothing one it had before. Another realization swept over me with a third chill, and, with all sorts of alarm bells going off in my head, I slowly raised my head to look up.

  
You see, I forgot to mention one thing. The main lobby area of Darby Hospital is not just a single floor. It’s a massive atrium, rising five or six floors to a massive glass ceiling with sweeping walkways arching around the lobby, allowing patients or staff to look straight down to the ground floor.

  
Someone was standing at the railing on the top floor.

  
Because the lights were dimmed, I couldn’t tell if it was a man or a woman; all I could see was a general outline against the night sky. Even still, I got the definite impression that whoever it was, they were staring straight down at me. And for a moment, all I could do was stare right back. Then I swallowed slightly, before forcing my voice out. “Uh…hello?”  I expected whoever it was to answer; I *hoped* they would, to soothe my frayed nerves. But the person remained silent. I called to them again. “Hello, can you hear me?” More silence. A small knot began to form itself in my stomach. “Okay, seriously man, whoever you are, you’re starting to seriously creep me the *hell* out!” I put a small trace of anger into the last call, hoping that it would spur any response. But the figure remained still.

  
Suddenly, the biggest chill yet raced up my spine, causing me to audibly let out a gasp. The wariness and eerie feeling I’d had up to that point, was suddenly gone. In its place, was what I can only describe as a gut wrenching, inexplicable explosion of terror. Every fiber of my being began screaming at me to run. Almost on instinct, I began to back up, and with each step I took the fear increased. *Fuck this, man, I’m out of here!* I readied myself to turn and bolt-

  
\-When a heavy hand fell on my shoulder from behind.

  
“*Jesus!*” My feet left the ground as I leapt a good six inches off the floor. My heart feeling as though it were about to explode out of my chest, I whirled around, my fists bunched up and ready to sock whoever it was. To my shock, I found myself staring into the masked face of a middle-aged man wearing a white coat. *A doctor*. For a moment, a look of shock adorned the part of his face visible. Then, it was replaced by an extremely mortified expression as he raised his hands in an unthreatening manner. “Oh, good Lord, son, I am *so* sorry! I thought you heard me calling to you!” For a moment, all I could do was stand there. Then, with a loud whoosh, I let out the breath I hadn’t realized I’d been holding in, bending over almost in half as I put my hands on my knees. Then I let out a small, shaky laugh. “Holy crap, man. You almost gave me a heart attack” Still looking extremely apologetic, the man reached out and put a reassuring hand on my shoulder. “Are you alright?” he asked. I swallowed hard, then, feeling as though I’d regained a bit of control over myself, stood up straight. 

  
“Yeah, I’m fine” I ran a hand through my hair and chuckled again, before gesturing up and over my shoulder. “Just-I got creeped out by the person up top there, and when you reached out and touched me…” I trailed off. A slightly perplexed expression crossed his face as he looked up. It was instantly replaced by a stern look. “Oh, for God’s sake, not *again*” he muttered. He raised his voice to a shout. “Nurse!” Almost instantly, a door three floors up opened, bright light spilling out from beyond. A shape appeared, one I instantly recognized was dressed in the garb of a nurse. A moment later, a soothing woman’s voice filtered down. “Yes, Doctor?” He pointed up. “Mr. Friedman appears to have left his room again: would you kindly escort him back?” I saw the nurse crane her neck to look up, before cursing softly. “Of course, Doctor!” she called, before disappearing back into the hallway, closing the doors behind her.

  
As soon as she was out of sight, the man turned back to me. “Please, again, accept my deepest apologies, both for myself and my patient” He jerked his head up. “Mr. Friedman is one of our long-term patients, and to make matters more difficult, he has a condition. He has a habit of wandering at night when he’s not supposed to” He shook his head slightly. “I’m going to have to speak to the matron on his floor about having an extra nurse to watch him from now on” he muttered, more to himself than me. Then, he looked up, his eyes again focusing on me. “You must be the young man we called to temporarily replace Mr. Drexen as the night guard, am I correct,” his eyes flicked down to my nametag, “Anthony?” I nodded. “Yes, sir, that’s correct. Anthony Romley, at your service” Even though I couldn’t see his mouth, I got the impression he was smiling by his voice as he reached out to shake my hand. “Leonard Carter. I’m in charge of the hospital during the night shifts” I felt the last wisps of fear fade as I took it and shook back. “Pleasure to meet you, Dr. Carter”

  
As I stepped back, something the man said suddenly clicked. “Uh, maybe I misheard, but you said temporarily replace your normal night guard? I was informed that this was just a one-night gig?” For a moment, the man didn’t speak, cocking his head slightly to one side as he thought. Then he laughed. “And this is why I need to make myself more clear from now on. Yes, the job right now is only a one-night affair, *but* I was trying to make it clear to your employer that I meant it was simply a trial run, to see how we find you. If we’re pleased with your performance, we’d like to offer you a longer contract until we can find a suitable, dedicated replacement” I suddenly found myself standing up as straight as I could as his words repeated over and over in my mind. *This might be more than a one-time thing. This might actually lead to a continued paycheck beyond the meager salary they’re forced to give you for simply being on the company’s payroll. This is what you’ve been waiting for, for the last few months*.

  
And God knows, between the repairs I needed to make on my Comet, and an unexpected, large bill I received from my dentist for a procedure that my insurance suddenly decided it wouldn’t cover, I needed it.

  
I nodded, unable to keep a smile from spreading across my face. “Honestly, Dr. Carter, even though that wasn’t properly explained, I’m not going to lie and say right now, with the way the world is, I could use all the money I can get my hands on. And I’ll do what I need to, to prove I’m capable enough to hold the position” Dr. Carter let out another laugh, before motioning to the hallway I’d begun approaching earlier. “I’m glad to hear it. Now, shall we begin heading towards your post? It’s a bit of a walk, and I’ll explain the details to you on the way.”

  
Nodding, I mimicked his gesture. “After you, sir”

  
As he led the way through the maze of corridors, past multiple doors which bore labels for everything from radiology to surgical wings, he explained the finer points to me. The hospital usually had three full-time security guards on staff; one for the day shift, and two for the night. At night, one of the two would monitor the main hospital building itself, while the second would patrol the connecting corridor and morgue building. I was slightly surprised at this revelation, wondering why they would need someone to monitor those areas until he answered my unasked question. “I’ve worked here at Darby for a very, very long time, Anthony. A lot has changed about the world in that time, almost as much as the last few months. But there’s one thing that *hasn’t*. And that’s rambunctious teenagers, who often try to break into the morgue through the building door itself, or sneak into the elevator and down the corridor to win dares their friends give them” *Yeah, the absolutely batshit insane ones*, I thought. As we continued, I was informed that the man I was temporarily replacing, Drexen, had had the morgue patrol.

  
At his words, and for a brief moment, the feeling of anxiety and fear I’d felt in the lobby reared its head again, before I forced it away. *Like I said outside, Tony: Get a grip. It’s just a slightly eerie hospital, nothing more. Even if morgue patrol isn’t really your bag, suck it up and deal with it. You need the dough*. Finally, we rounded a corner to find a tall, burly man in a similar outfit to mine waiting in front of a pair of large, silver elevator doors. Dr. Carter gestured to the man. “Anthony, this is Bernard Tryon, our main floor guard and your partner. Bernard, this Anthony Romley, the temp guard we were sent” Bernard reached out and clasped his hand over mine. “Good to meet you, kid” he said with a gravely tone. I nodded back. Dr. Carter turned back to me. “Bernard will take you down and give you a quick tour of the area, along with your radio to stay in touch. Now, I must get back to the rest of the staff” He reached out and patted my shoulder. “I apologize again for our unfortunate introduction, but I already can tell you’re an alert, astute and well-mannered young man. I know you’ll do fine” And with that, he turned and began walking away.

  
Before he moved out of earshot, I called one final time to him. “Don’t worry, Doctor! I’ll do my best!” The man stopped, staring over his shoulder before nodding and calling back, the tone of his voice again sounding as though he were smiling.

  
“I know you will!”

  
Once he’d gone, Bernard and I entered the large freight elevator, and after inserting a key and turning it, the doors closed, and we began descending to the bowels of the complex. As the elevator continued down, he turned to me. “So, are you from around here?” he asked. I nodded. “Born and bred” At my words, he turned, his eyes sharp. “So, I take it you’ve heard the stories about this place, right?” I felt my stomach contort in my chest slightly, letting out a small sigh. “You mean the ones about this place being haunted to shit? About the operating room once bearing the sight of a botched surgery which killed the patient, and the escaped mental loon who supposedly lived down here in the tunnels for years? Not to mention that the hospital itself is somehow alive? Yeah, I’ve heard them. My friend’s older brother would never shut up about them” He let out a sharp laugh. “Well, of course those, but I was referring to the ones about the screwed-up doctor that supposedly worked here sixty or seventy years ago.”

  
A small pang of surprise filled me as I turned towards him. *That* one, I hadn’t heard. Seeing the questioning look in my eyes, Bernard continued. “Story goes that from the 40s to the early 60s, one of the head doctors got really involved in the occult. Started messing about with witchcraft and demon summoning, performing all sorts of screwed up experiments on unsuspecting patients and even sacrificing some. He was obsessed with immortality, and wanted to find a way to stay on earth for eternity, to continue his work. But it ended when the police, on an anonymous tip from a terrified nurse, raided the hospital to find him about to sacrifice a *child*. He refused to drop the scalpel in his hand, and so they blew him away, right up there in the old operating theater. It's why they don't use that wing of the hospital anymore.”

  
I attempted to look calm and collected. But the truth was, the man’s story had gotten under my skin more than I cared to admit, even to myself. Chills similar to what I’d felt in the lobby ran like ice water down my spine, and it took everything in me not to shudder. Instead, I stared hard at Bernard for a moment. He gazed right back, looking dead serious.

  
Then he began chuckling. “Nah, I’m just screwin’ with you, kid. Nothing like that ever happened here” Feeling sheepish that I had almost fallen for the tale, I let out a snort of my own. After a second, he looked at me more seriously. “Same goes for all the other stories you listed. They’re all bullshit, Wives Tales made up by kids for generations to scare the hell out of each other. All that this place is, is a bit eerie and nothing more. Remember that, and keep a clear head, and you’ll do just fine” The man’s reassurance helped, and I nodded gratefully at him. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the elevator let out a *ding*, and the doors opened.

  
To a sight that almost immediately put me back on edge.

  
The corridor the elevator opened on to was decidedly industrial and weathered in its appearance. On the ceiling and one side of the wall were dozens of pipes which, due to the rust and discoloration on them, might have been here since the sixties. A few of them let out soft hissing sounds, occasionally puffing out steam. The corridor itself was rather tall and narrow, lit only by bare bulbs hooked into the free wall which disappeared out of sight. I opened my mouth and said the only thing I could. “Good *God*, this fucking place is straight out of *Grave Encounters*” Bernard turned to me, a slightly puzzled look in his eyes. “What the hell is that?” I shook my head. “It’s a horror movie” He nodded, then gestured down the corridor.

   
“Come on, just a small walk and we’ll reach our destination.”

  
The two of us walked down the corridor, continuing to talk as we passed by doors which led to God-only-knows where until we reached a large, locked metal door. Stamped into a large, white plate read the word *Morgue*. Pulling another set of keys from his belt, he unlocked the door and opened it, reaching inside and flicking on the lights. “Here is where you’ll be spending most of your shift.”

  
Carefully I stepped inside, him following after and closing the door. “That’s the first rule they have here: every time you enter and leave the building, you’ve gotta close the door behind you first thing. I’m not sure why, probably to do with the chemicals or temperature they keep it in here. But, even still” As though his words had conjured it, I felt the temperature drop a good deal. *Definitely glad I kept my coat on now*. Bernard noticed me pulling my coat tighter. “Don’t worry; it’s just down here that it’s truly cold. The floor above is warmer, and the room you can use to sit in between rounds has heat." "Thank God for small favors" I muttered, earning a chuckle from him. He led the way into the next room, which I instantly decided was one of my least favorite places in the building. Because it was a giant, rectangular room filled with dozens of metal lockers along both walls. Giving it a once-over, I counted more than two dozen of them; I noticed with another small churn of my stomach that about five or six of them had name tags slipped into clips. *Great, there’s actually fucking bodies down here*.

  
Thankfully, though, we quickly moved through the room and up the stairs to the upper floor. Even though it was clear up here was where bodies were autopsied, it somehow seemed less creepy than cold storage. I absent mindedly mulled over the equipment laid out on a tray next to the autopsy table as Bernard continued speaking about my rounds. Finally, we moved down the hall past a few more doors and opened the second to last, revealing a rather comfortable looking break room. A coffee machine sat on a far table, and a small, boxy TV with rabbit ears atop it sat next to it. “TV doesn’t get any reception since they swapped to digital, but there’s a VCR with a few tapes to help you pass the time” he offered, pointing to a file cabinet marked *Entertainment*. I stepped inside, instantly adoring the wave of heat that covered me like a blanket.

  
That’s when I became aware of something. Music, the same easy listening music I had heard in the lobby was softly playing from somewhere. Looking up, I saw the small speaker embedded in the far wall. I let out a soft groan. “They pipe that music in here as well?” Bernard nodded. “The coroner requested it; apparently he likes listening to it while working” I gave him a pleading look. “Is there any way to turn it off?” He shook his head. “Afraid not, sorry” I let out a small sigh. “Alright” The man patted my shoulder in an awkward, sympathetic manner before straightening up. “Well, that’s the grand tour. Remember to make your rounds through the building every so often, and once in a while, walk through the corridor. There’s a camera in there somehow, though I’ve never seen it myself, and they’ll know if you don’t”

  
I nodded, following him back downstairs and into the cold storage room. Bernard began to speak. “I’ll come down every so often to check on you and make sure you’re handling it alright during my breaks, but just try to remember what I said. Keep your head up, and don’t let the bullshit get-“ He kept speaking, but it was as though his words had suddenly drawn ten miles away from me. I’d reached the halfway point across the room, matching the larger man’s pace. But I froze, feeling as though I’d suddenly been rooted to the spot. For a second, I felt puzzled by the instinctive reaction. And then, the terror I’d felt in the lobby returned in spades as I became aware of two separate things.

  
The first was that I had originally thought that, aside from the soft hissing which filled the room, along with the music, it was silent in here. But it wasn’t. The sound was almost inaudible at first, like the sound of snow from an old television. But as I concentrated, I began to hear something filter through it. And as I continued to listen, the sound grew in its intensity. And I instantly wished I hadn’t focused on it.

  
It was the sound of a person mumbling. The words were spoken too low and fast for me to make out anything, but it was unquestionably a *person*. That wasn’t what scared the shit the most out of me. No, *that* was because the person, a man, sounded utterly insane. Every so often, he’d let out small giggles, paired with a low, sinister chuckle that froze the blood in my veins. And somehow, that wasn’t even the worst part. It was the second part that was.

  
One of the refrigerator doors on the far edge of the room stood ajar.

  
I hadn’t noticed it when we’d first entered the room-*I swear they were all closed*\-but there it was, refrigerant slowly puffing out of it to the floor. I couldn’t tell if it had been one of the one’s I’d seen a tag fitted to, but as I realized where the mumbling was coming from, I didn’t need to. I simply stared, feeling unable to blink or look away as dread, stronger than I’ve ever felt in my life begin filling every square inch of my body and soul. I suddenly became aware that all the other sounds had gone silent. The hissing, the music, even Bernard had shut up, as if all the sounds besides the horrible ones from the locker were being sucked out of the room. That’s when they went silent as well. The room became deathly still for a moment. But only a moment. Because a single, horrifying word filtered out from the locker.

  
*Anthonyyyy…*

  
My heart began to race in my chest as the weight of hearing my own name uttered from the locker slammed into me with all the weight of a Kenworth. *What the fuck?! What the actual fuck, dude?!* Every part of me wanted desperately to open my mouth and scream as loud as I ever had in my life. But I still felt rooted to the spot, unable to do anything but stare.

  
That’s when the door began to slowly push open.

  
I felt my breath hitch in my throat as I saw the yawning blackness slowly revealed inside as it continued to open farther. My heart felt like it was about to explode out from my chest, and I would die of a heart attack at any moment. I suddenly became aware of one incontestable fact: *whatever* was inside that locker, if I laid eyes on it, it would be the last thing I *ever* saw. I kept trying to force myself to close my eyes as I swear I began to see something move in the inky blackness. *Close your fucking eyes, you moron, close your fuc-*

  
“*Anthony!*”

  
I started, finding that I was suddenly able to not only blink, but move again. For a second, my mind attempted to catch up to the rest of me. Then I became aware that Bernard was bending down and staring into my eyes. He’d removed his mask as well; I saw a heavy frown through the thick mustache he had. “Wha-what?” I stammered. A look of severe relief filled his face, and he reached up to wipe visible sweat from his brow. “You’re back. Good. Sweet heavens to Betsy, you scared the shit out of me” His eyes narrowed. “What the *hell* happened? You stopped walking and talking and just stood as still as a statue, not blinking for a minute there”

  
A small part of me wanted desperately to tell him about the horrible things I’d just seen and heard. But a larger part of me whispered two things. That he would never believe me. And worse, if I did tell the truth, I would be let go instantly. Likely without pay. *And I cannot afford that*.

  
So, I lied. “I honestly don’t know, man. I must’ve blanked out or something, maybe started daydreaming” I saw him raise an eyebrow at me, indicating he didn’t exactly buy my excuse. I feigned a slightly irritated tone. “I’m *fine*, seriously” After a moment, he nodded, still looking slightly suspicious. “If you say so,” he began, before looking at me sharply, “But I catch you doing that again, as much as I like you, I’ll have to report it. Understand?” I nodded back. “Clear as crystal” He let out a small sigh, then reached down and pulled something off his belt. “Here. Before I forget, here’s your radio to keep in touch with me. I’ve already set it to the channel my radio is on” He tapped the other side of his belt, where I saw an identical radio sitting. “Keep in touch, and if anything happens, you get on the horn and let me know, got it?”

  
I let out a deep breath as I slipped the radio onto my own belt. “Yeah, I got it” He gave me a final, hard look. “I mean it. Anything at all, you radio me. Especially if you think someone’s broken in here. For the love of God, don’t be a hero, and don’t be Rambo” His eyes flickered down to the Beretta holstered on my hip as he finished his sentence. I nodded again. “I pick up what you’re putting down, Bernard. I’ll radio you if anything happens” Nodding, he patted me on the shoulder, then opened the door and stepped into the small storage room. I followed behind as he opened the door into the main corridor.

  
“I’ll come down in about an hour to check on you, alright?” I nodded, patting him on the shoulder as he’d done and forcing a smile I didn’t even remotely feel. “Sounds like a plan, man. In the meantime, I’m gonna go see what tapes are up there for the TV” He finally chuckled, seeming to relax. “There’s a good selection in there of all genres; Douglas and I used to come down to watch movies on break all the time. Just, one small suggestion? No horror movies; at least, not tonight” It was now *my* turn to let out a genuine laugh. “Yeah, I think I’ll skip those” He nodded, then headed into the corridor, closing the door behind him.

  
For a few moments, I listened to the sound of his retreating footsteps until they became faint. Then I reached up and pulled the mask from my face, feeling thankful I could breathe properly again. Then, I turned away, beginning to mentally chide myself. *For God’s sake, Tony, do NOT fuck this up for yourself. I don’t know what that was about, whether it’s lack of sleep or just an overactive imagination, but we both know there was nothing there. So get ahold of yourself. Bernard’s already two seconds away from getting you canned. So, repeat after me: There’s nothing down here. Just you*. I opened my mouth. “There’s nothing down here. Only me”

  
The words brought some much-needed reassurance to me, and I felt my confidence begin to rise again. Even still, I quickly speed-walked through cold storage, feeling relief fill me as I closed the door behind me and walked up the stairs. As I entered the hallway, I suddenly realized what music was now playing over the speakers. An old late 50s, early 60s instrumental song called *Theme From A Summer Place*.

  
“Well, at least it isn’t *Beautiful Dreamer* again. Thank God. Now, time to check out those tapes and grab a cup of coffee” And with that, I walked down the hall to the break room, confident that the worst was behind me.

  
I had no idea it was only a prelude of what was to come.
