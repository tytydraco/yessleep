As a fan of the paranormal and true-crime cases, I was very excited when I came across an article about multiple strange deaths in my small-town hospital.

I was much less so when, a few days later, I had to be hospitalized there for food poisoning.

The affair had broken out in the press because, apparently, the hospital management had tried to “hide” the deaths on the pretext that they were accidental.

After the 7th death in less than 2 months, the information finally leaked out. Probably by a doctor or nurse who thought it was time to warn the press, and the police for that matter, before any more deaths occurred.

The circumstances of the death were troubling. All the articles reported the same facts: they had all died of a heart attack during the night. In the morning, someone had discovered their bodies while making a routine rounds. All those who discovered the dead were traumatized. Apparently, the victims all had expressions frozen in agonizing fear. Their eyes were still wide open, as were their mouths, which were twisted in an expression of infinite pain.

When the situation was revealed to the public, the hospital said they had already launched an internal investigation, but according to staff testimonies, nothing concrete had been done, and they had tried above all to protect their own ass. No culprits or even suspects had been found.

The day after these articles were published, my mother took me to hospital after I had been vomiting without a break all night.

-

The welcome was warm. Almost too warm. It was as if the entire staff had been instructed to do whatever it took to reassure the patients - and the press - and give the hospital the best possible image. 

Once I'd settled into my hospital bed and taken some medication, a doctor came to confirm the diagnosis of food poisoning to my mother and me, and told us I'd have to stay in hospital for at least 3 days.

When he told me this, my hair stood on end. 

I thought I'd just have to stay the afternoon under observation with a prescription for medication to be taken over the next few days, in the safety of my room and my home. And instead I found myself having to spend, or rather “survive”, 3 nights in this hospital where someone - or something - had been executing patients indiscriminately for over 2 months.

When my mother saw my eyes widen she asked me worriedly, “Are you all right, sweetie?”

“No... well yes, it's just that. 3 days, is that really necessary?”

“If you don’t want to hurt yourself by passing out alone in the bathroom yes,” the doctor replied with a smile.

“Why are you so worried?” my mother asked.

“It's just that... with these stories of murders in the hospital...”

For a moment, the doctor's mask fell away, before he resumed his benevolent smile.

“Don't worry, it's just a series of unfortunate accidents. The... press has really exaggerated the facts, I assure you” he replied awkwardly. I sensed that even he didn't believe what he was saying and that the reality was perhaps even worse than what had been revealed.

“And anyway don't worry a nurse will be making rounds every hour every night to make sure that, well, everything's okay.”

The nurse to his right, who had been silent until then, and had simply kept a polite smile on her face during the discussion, finally intervened.

“Don't worry, I'll do the rounds myself every night. You're safe here.” 

She appeared calm and self-assured. It wasn't much, but as I listened to her words, the weight in my stomach lightened.

During the exchange, my mother remained frowning, clearly not understanding what we were talking about. Finally, the doctor took her aside outside my room, probably to explain the situation and reassure her at the same time.

I could see her anxious face and her right hand caressing her neck as she glanced at me through the small window in the door. Finally, she nodded and came back to me, telling me that everything would be all right, and that we didn't really have a choice anyway, considering my condition.

I apprehended the first night as one apprehends the end of one's life. With the anxiety of the unknown.

I could see the sun setting through the window. I was still a little weak, but I'd been able to stay awake and use my phone for a few hours before it started to get dark, and read increasingly supernatural explanations of the deaths in the hospital. Some said it was haunted by a malevolent entity that took advantage of patients' weakness to suck out what little vital energy they had left, leaving only an empty shell.

As I scrolled in panic over the increasingly frightening comments, the same nurse I'd met with the doctor and who would be doing the rounds, Eva, came to see me. I needed to take my medication and sleep to regain my strength.

“No offense, but there haven't been any deaths among the nurses so far so I can understand that it doesn't scare you that much...” I said with nerves raw from the night ahead, while putting my phone on my bedside table.

“Is it true what it says on the internet?”, I asked before even letting her answer. “That the victims were found dead with horrible expressions on their faces?”

She pursed her lips and looked up in front of her.

“Look... the truth is, nobody knows what happened. There have been some... strange things going on in the hospital lately. These strange deaths are one of them.” She looked me in the eye: “But that's why I'm here. To make sure nothing happens to you and the other patients. Like you said, none of the nurses were targeted, so it's safe to assume that anyone...”

“Or anything.” I interrupted her.

“Anyway, now that rounds are being made there's little chance of it happening again. The person responsible, if they exist, has probably fled somewhere else by now.”

She finally left, assuring me that she'd be back every hour of the night. I took a deep breath to relax, took my medication for the night, and crawled under the comforter of my bed to try to sleep.

After a while, more because of my still fragile state than anything else, I finally managed to fall asleep.

-

I opened my eyes slowly. 

It was still dark outside. The room was plunged into darkness, lit only by the light from the corridor that passed through the gaps in my bedroom door.

I sat up a little in bed, wondering what had woken me up. 

Suddenly, I heard a whisper in the corner of the room.

Instinctively, I pulled my blanket up in front of my chin. I stared at the corner. It was too dark to see. And that corner appeared even darker than the rest of the room. A darkness that wasn't natural.

There was no way I was going to “take a closer look” at where the noise was coming from, like all the idiots who get killed in horror movies.

I quickly got out of bed and tiptoed to the door to get out and fetch someone. All the while I kept staring at the corner of the room, watching for the slightest noise, the slightest movement. 

And in the total silence of the night, I heard it. A whisper that sounded to me like a scream in the silence: “You are next.”

I screamed at the top of my lungs and ran for the door.

Just before I opened it, I saw that Eva was standing right in front of it, looking at me through the small window.

She widened her eyes in surprise at my scream and came in, turning on the bedroom light.

“What's going on are you okay?” she asked me worriedly.

-

I told her everything under the safety of a bright ceiling light in the hospital cafeteria.

She seemed very disturbed by what I had told her. Had other victims said exactly the same thing before they died? If so, she wouldn't tell me. She gave me a few vague words of comfort, telling me that I must have imagined that shadow and the words that followed because of my state of exhaustion and everything I'd read on the internet that evening. The fact that I was severely dehydrated on top of that, effectively made me doubt my own memories.

Once we'd finished our chat, I realized that patients were starting to enter the cafeteria for breakfast. It was early, 5 a.m., but I couldn't see myself going back to bed for even a few hours until the sun was fully up.

I forced myself to swallow something, and around 8 a.m. I returned to my room accompanied by a doctor who wondered what I was doing there while sick.

-

The day passed quickly.

My parents had come to visit, I'd taken my medication, and already dawn was beginning to break in the sky.

I chatted to Eva again over dinner, and as she left the room with a comforting smile on her lips, I'd almost convinced myself that I'd imagined what had happened the night before.

I drank a large glass of water with my medication and went to sleep for the 2nd night.

-

As I slept soundly, I felt the presence of two hands on my legs. 

The next thing I knew, one was moving up my thigh, then the other hand on the other.

I opened my eyes and turned around; there was nothing in front of me but darkness.

And yet, when I looked down I saw the trace of two huge hands on me, whose only proof of their existence was the mark they left as they pressed into the blanket and the pressure they exerted on me.

I screamed like a madman.

Both hands went to my chest. That was it. They were going to come up to my neck and strangle me or go through my torso and crush my heart in their palm. Or worse, hold it firmly but without forcing it so that my life would gradually come to an end.

Just as I was contemplating all the possible horrors, I felt movement to my right and saw the light come on.

Eva stood there, sweating, looking around the room.

“You ... you saw it?” I asked, trembling.

“Yes. Yes I... I saw it.”

She looked as confused as I was, as if the thing that had tried to kill me had jumped in her face before disappearing.

Suddenly, my head began to spin. My vision blurred, my heart began to beat irregularly in my chest.

Before I fainted, I thought I heard something coming from outside. A barely audible whisper that seemed to say: “Stay awake”.

Then I fainted.

-

I woke up in the afternoon in my room.

I could hardly think straight. Everything around me was a blur.

A doctor was talking to my mother, who looked pale with worry.

When I opened my eyes, she came to me and said, “Don't worry, darling, everything will be fine, just sleep and rest.

I barely had time to mumble something before a nurse injected something into a tube beside me.

It seemed to be Eva. She was smiling at me as usual. But I sensed something had changed in her expression. Before I could think of anything, I fell back asleep.

-

I felt numb all over.

As if I were being held in a second state by invisible straps.

“Wake up,” a voice whispered to me.

But I couldn't do anything, I felt so weak.

“Wake. Up,” it insisted.

I could feel a presence. The presence of something that wasn't supposed to make contact with the world of the living. And yet it was there.

Another presence, another voice: “Wake up!”

Then another, and another, 6, 7 voices. They were all shouting the same thing.

“WAKE UP.”

I opened my eyes suddenly, taking a deep breath.

And before me stood a demon.

But not the one I was expecting.

Eva.

She was standing right above me, knees up on my bed, holding a syringe filled with some unknown liquid with a horrible expression of ecstasy on her usually sweet face, and holding my jaw on one side to reveal my neck.

Who was this person? Had she been possessed by the thing that had haunted me the last two nights?

No.

I could see it in her eyes. For the first time, I could see her true face. The face of a maniacal killer.

I still felt weak, as if I could barely lift my arms. And she seemed so strong above me.

This time it was really going to be the end. She was supposed to be making the rounds to keep me safe after all.

No one was going to come and save me.

Just as she was about to stick her needle in my neck, she suddenly froze, looking over my shoulder. All traces of ecstasy had vanished and been replaced by dreadful fear. Then, the next instant, anger.

“This time you won't be able to stop me!” she screamed, before pulling herself together.

This delay had given me enough time to come to my senses and think of a way out. Suddenly, I turned my whole body in my bed and threw her to the floor with me.

I felt like I was wrestling with a banshee.

She seemed to be going out of her mind, screaming at the top of her lungs that she was going to kill me, while I used all my energy to restrain her arm that was holding the needle.

After a while, probably less than 10 seconds that felt like 10 minutes, a doctor stormed into my room with a nurse and managed to subdue Eva.

I crawled to a wall to rest my back on, fully awake, and realizing how incredibly lucky I was to still be alive.

-

An hour later, Eva was taken away by the police.

Considering the facts, and her far more unstable psychological state than she had appeared, it wasn't long before they managed to get her to confess to the murders.

Eva was a serial killer who used her position of trust as a nurse to kill patients.

She used an undetectable product that was the direct cause of cardiac arrest.

My state of health had worsened as a result of all these events, and I ended up staying in hospital for another week.

Nothing strange happened during my stay. Everything was back to normal.

Just as I was gathering my things on the last day before leaving my room, I thought I heard whispers coming from somewhere.

I turned around in surprise, and just said what came to me instinctively at the time: “Thank you”.
