This is my first post here, hope everyone enjoys.

After a long day at work once I get into the house I knock all the lights on, feed the cat, wash the dishes from the night before and set off down to the gym. Working the long hours I do at the office will eventually destroy my posture if I let it, so keeping up the gym work is my way of preventing this and allows me to disconnect from work and home.  


  
I live alone in a end terraced house on a quite street in a small town in England. I’m in my early twenties and recently moved here a couple months ago, as living at home was getting too comfortable and needed to start to grow up a bit. My parents never pushed me out but kept hinting at it, so I took the hint and moved out, like my siblings above me, I have a younger sibling still living at home so my parents will appreciate the silence, not like I’m loud.  


  
The house I live in now is fairly small. Has two floors, ground and first floor, two bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen and living room. It seems to be an old mining building as the town I live in was built on the mining industry, so quality of the build is better than that of newer builds, but they were built with purpose back then.

  
I like to get in from the gym and take a brisk walk around my neighbourhood to clear my mind and get some time away from the computer screen, the neighbourhood is very old, the building construction’s range from early 19th century to modern day.  


  
The nights are getting longer now as winter is closing in so I leave for work early on in the morning in the dark and get back later, so it’s basically like I’m living in dark all the time. After cooking some dinner and watching a few YouTube videos I call it a night and head off for a shower, but first I go around the house and lock all the doors and windows to ensure the house was safe and secure before heading for a shower.

  
I head into my room get undressed and headed to the shower, leaving my bedroom door open a jar to let the cat wander in once he finished his pouch of food I poured out prior to heading up. I turn the shower on and switch the extractor fan on to reduce the amount of steam that builds up in the room, therefore reducing the amount of damp that builds up overtime.

  
Let me give you a floor plan of the first floor to give you some idea on the layout of the house. Once entering the house you are faced with stairs to your left and door to the living room on your right, head up the stairs till you’re met with a wall, turn right and head up three more steps. The hallway is narrow and not too far back.  


  
The first room on your left is the shower opposite that is the office/spare bedroom to the back and parallel to these rooms are the master bedroom (my room) and a walk in wardrobe opposite. At the end of the hallway is a wall with some pictures on the wall and a hatch on the ceiling with retractable ladders to allow access into the loft.  


  
Whilst standing in the shower for about five minutes I hear something strange coming from the hallway, I stop washing my hair and get most of the shampoo out my hair to stop it dripping in my eyes and pull my head out from under the water for a couple seconds but hear nothing. So I go back to rinsing my hair out to start to wash my body. Then I hear something again.  


  
Confused I stop quicker this time and whip my head out the way of the stream of water. I can hear a muffled, very faint singing or what could be a lullaby from which sounds like a woman. Confused as I haven’t had any women around here for a while as I am single and hook up with some every so often, I was very confused, as none of them have ever had a key to the house.  


  
I quickly wash my body and wrap a towel around my waist and turn the shower off as quick as I can. I swing the door open and look down the hallway towards my room on the left, but see nothing there, confused… I head back in brush my teeth, head out the door.  


  
I turn around knock the light off. I walk over to my room on the laminated wooden floor and put some boxers on, dry myself and head into bed. Thinking nothing of it I turn over knock the bed site table light off and head to sleep.

  
I wake up the following morning, head to work and do the same thing I did the night prior. I jump in the shower again, but heard nothing like I did the night before.  


  
A couple of weeks have passed since the strange sound I heard in the hallway, but as October came in quickly and passed, November was already about to begin. So the nights were getting ever longer. This day…This day was different to the first encounter with the strange noises, as I had to stay back later to finish writing some documents up at work, so I didn’t leave till 6:00pm. My usual finishing time was 4:00pm.

  
So due to me getting back home later than normal, I had to hurry back once I got to my car, as the cat, (his name is Alfie) was outside the rain was bouncing off the floor at this point and it hadn’t stopped for three hours now. So I was hoping he got under something dry and was keeping out the weather and not standing no the window looking in for me. I pull into my estate and then my driveway, practically flying out the car in order to not get drenched and make sure the Alfie was alright.  


  
I punch through my front door and take a couple steps into the house and see that Alfie had just jumped up onto the window as I got through the front door. (I could see the kitchen once getting into the living room). I hurry through to the back door and open it up to let him in. He comes in with only a small amount of water on him. So he clearly was hiding under something as to not get that wet. I grab a towel from a towel rack above me and dry him off a little bit. I grab some food and put it in his bowl.  


  
I hear the wind howling through the house and notice the door was not shut once I came through. “Shit” I say as I run over, shut the door and lock it. I take my jacket off and hang it up on the coat rack at the bottom of the stairs in-front of the door. Due to finishing so late I have no time for the gym as it took me fifteen minutes to get home, and the gym shuts are 8:00pm, so once getting settled it wouldn’t leave me much time.  


  
Regardless I head up stairs, get changed and come back down to make some food up. Since it was the weekend I had some beers in the fridge cooling off all day, I crack one open and sit on the sofa to put a film on, about fifteen minutes later Alfie come over to join me by my side. I stick one of my favourite movies on, this being ‘The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring’. After the intro plays I head over to the fridge to get another beer. Once I sit back down I fall asleep to the heat of the house. I have an automatic heating system that kicks in at 8:00pm for one hour a day. This send me to sleep for a couple hours.  


  
I wake up and notice I’m already half way through the film and decide to call it a night. I switch my TV off and head upstairs to get a shower. This time I leave my room light on, I get undressed and head into the shower. I switch the extractor fan on then being to clean myself, after only what feels like two to three minutes in the shower I hear that sound again I hear a bit back.  


  
It sounded like a woman was singing with what sounded like tears in the song this time. But it was significantly closer to the bathroom door this time, which was strange as the weather was horrendous outside, the rain sounded like it was going to tear through the house at any moment like a bear on a campers tent when it smells food. So for the singing to sound this close to the door was very unnerving. I keep the shower on this time but jump out and without wrapping a towel around my self I pull the door open expecting to go into a fight with an intruder bollock naked. But there’s no one there… Perplexed I stand scanning around for a little bit and notice my bedroom light was off.  


  
Slightly confused I explicitly remember switching it on. Brushing it off I shut the door and finish off washing myself, but as I was about to turn the shower off I hear it again, but this time its right next to my door, like right in the corner of the door and the singing is more distinct but not English I can’t make it out. I freeze in fear and just stand there listening to it. It must have went on form some time as the water was pounding off my torso. What felt like an hour had passed, but was most likely five minutes at maximum, it begins to fade. As if she is moving away from the door and back towards the end of the hallway.  


  
I turn the shower off and it ends instantly. Really confused, scared and worried that my house has a singing, weeping, ghost lady in it. I dry myself quickly and head to my room. I open the door and head out towards the bedroom. The light is on again, bamboozled at this point as I clearly seen it switched off when I looked out before. I begin to slowly walk towards my room… the floor is very cold on my feet. It feels like if I stop for any amount of time I would just stick to the floor as my feet are still soaked.

  
The office and walk in wardrobe doors are both closed. I walk up to my room and I stop… as the door is open a jar, I stand starring into my room, I’m caught off guard. I see a woman sitting on the end of my bed with a candle light in her hands facing the door way. She must be at least three meters from me. She is very pretty but looks tired with big bags under her eyes.

  
She has an old style candle in her hands holder in her hands. Her index finger through the handle, with some wax already in the tray… Her skin is slightly blue, she looks cold, her hands are a darker blue with long uncut nails, she has very little clothing on I can see everything very clearly to see everything as her nipples poking through the gown. She looks wet… like she has been dropped in a pool or out at sea. She looks to be in here mid to early thirties. I’m stood in the doorway of my room frozen in fear. She begins to sing that familiar lullaby I’ve heard a couple times now, but in a softer voice. But this time she changes one verse to English so I can understand it with a joyful child like domineer/undertone…

&#x200B;

  
“Here we are, here we are.  
You failed to set us free.  
Here we are, here we are.  
Now you’ve got to come with me”.  


  
As she finishes her sentence she stands up very abruptly and takes a very slow step towards me, like she’s in moving in slow motion. Her face begins to change. It got old really fast. All her skin under her gown beings to do the same. Her jaw open up like that of a snakes, but nothing comes out. That’s until she moves a few feet closer to me when a siren-like scream comes from her mouth and I drop to the ground and cover my ears and dropping my head towards my knees as she advances me.  


  
My head is pulled up from my hands like some unseen force has a hold of me and I’m greeted by her young beautiful face again as he stares into my eyes the bags under her eyes have disappeared. Both of our eyes locked together as her hazel eyes turn to a deep black. She begins to sing the lullaby one more time…  


  
“Here we are, here we are.  
You failed to set us free.  
Here we are, here we are.  
Now you’ve got to come with me”.

  
Then the force releases. I get a chance to lift my head up when I see that she has sat back down on my bed as she was before with the candle in hand. She is still facing me. She then abruptly disappears.  


  
I stand up after pulling myself together and look over at my bed where she was sitting. Theres a mark left on the bed where her bum was. This… this confirms that it wasn’t an apparition it was actually someone in my room…  


  
I turn around and see her stood in my doorway with a netted bag full of what looked to be human heads, each one murmuring as if they are trying to talk. But not having much luck as they haven’t got a voice box. She raises what looks to be a scythe up from her side and swings it in my direction at lightning speed.  


  
The last thing I saw was her beautiful face turn black, and fill with malice, her pupils narrow and begin to focus in on me. I feel myself fall to the ground, but felt no pain. A little while later my body follows and falls in front of me. She walks over to me with a light limp in her step. She grabbed me by my hair and pulled me up to her face and kissed my cheek, as I could hear the splattering of my blood was bouncing off the floor.

  
She threw my head into the bag, and I could feel the skin off the other heads rubbing against my own. She put my head in such a place as to allow me to see out the side of the netting.  
The last thing I saw was her walk over to my bathroom and plunge into my bath which was full of water. Well I assume it was…
