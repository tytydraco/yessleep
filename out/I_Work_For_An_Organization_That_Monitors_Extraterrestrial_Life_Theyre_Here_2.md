&#x200B;

As the creatures in the dark came for me, I ran toward the garage, tearing open the door and locking it behind me. I jammed the revolver into my waistband before searching through the cabinets, looking for something I could use. The closest thing I found to a useable weapon was a large sledgehammer. It wasn’t exactly ideal, but it would have to do.

&#x200B;

The door to the garage shook as something pounded on it. My killers were getting impatient.

&#x200B;

I raised the pistol and fired three shots through the wooden door, listening as whatever was on the other side cried out in pain. The door shook again and I emptied the rest of my clip through the door before tossing the pistol aside. I heard whatever was on the other side collapse and hoped to whatever God was listening that it was dead.

&#x200B;

On the far side of the garage, something tore one of the double sets of doors off of its hinges. I looked to see the shadow of some kind of shambling nightmare that looked only somewhat like a human, although it didn’t seem to have any skin. Its distorted mouth hung open as it let out an agonized screech and I swung the hammer at it, crushing its head against the wall of the garage as it came for me.

&#x200B;

The hammer did the job. The creature slumped to the ground, twitching as it expired although something new was already coming to take its place. This thing looked more reptilian than the others. It crawled onto the car, baring its teeth at me as it charged.

&#x200B;

I swung the hammer again, knocking it to the ground but not killing it. It recovered quickly, before coming after me again. I brought the hammer down on its head and heard its skull crack, although the creature only seemed to writhe violently in rage, hissing and spitting at me all the while. I hit it again, before looking up to see that even more were coming. I didn’t stop to get a good look at them.

&#x200B;

This time, I headed for the door I’d already barely defended and stumbled back outside. The wooden door slammed closed behind me, and I knew that it wouldn’t do much to hold off the things that were coming.

&#x200B;

The blue light shining above me flared brighter as I stepped back out into the open. The blue ethereal glow cut through the fog like a second sun and I paused to look up at it. It was impossible to make out any of the features of the ship through the light. Staring at it directly was almost blinding.

&#x200B;

The creatures inside of the garage pounded violently on the door, and on the other end of the garage, I could see a few others who were smart enough to go around coming for me. I gripped my hammer tightly, ready to start swinging when I felt the air around me growing warmer.

&#x200B;

I paused, not immediately sure what was happening before looking back up at the light above me. It seemed to be glowing even brighter and it took me a split second to figure out why.

&#x200B;

By going back outside, I’d just walked into the crosshairs of who or whatever was piloting that thing.

&#x200B;

Why leave me to the monsters when they could just shoot me?

&#x200B;

The air grew hotter and I ran, trying to get behind the cabin. I only barely moved in time before the ground where I’d been standing exploded beneath my feet.

&#x200B;

The force of the blast launched me a couple of meters away and left my ears ringing as I was thrown to the ground. I frantically clawed at the ground to drag myself behind the cabin, dragging the sledgehammer behind me as I did.

&#x200B;

Looking back at where the garage had been, I saw that it had taken the brunt of the impact. The half of it that was still standing sagged and collapsed in on itself. I didn’t see anything moving amongst the wreckage.

&#x200B;

And here I thought that friendly fire wasn’t friendly.

&#x200B;

The light in the sky moved suddenly, darting with blinding speed from its position over the trees toward a new spot over the lake. My heart skipped a beat as I realized that they were targeting me directly now.

&#x200B;

I felt the air around me growing hot again and launched myself forward, heading down toward the lake as the spot where I’d been just moments ago was consumed in another blast that took out one wall of the cabin. I fell forward, rolling down the incline leading to the lake. The hammer slipped out of my grasp and I didn’t see where it landed as I skidded to a stop along the rocky shore. I tried to pull myself to my feet, only to feel the air around me growing hot again, and looked up to see the ship charging another shot. I forced my body to move, as the ship flashed even brighter.

&#x200B;

But when the blast came, it came from above me.

&#x200B;

I looked up again to see sparks flying from the orb hovering over the lake. I saw its light flicker as something inside of it died. Then I saw the blinding flash of an explosion. Through the fog, I could see the remains of the ship going down, trailing smoke as it veered into the lake. It landed with a splash and then… silence.

&#x200B;

Finally.

&#x200B;

Silence.

&#x200B;

I collapsed onto the rocky shore, panting heavily. Looking up at the ruins of the garage, I was relieved to see nothing clawing its way out. The fog was still heavy around me… but that was fine. It was quiet… it was finally quiet.

&#x200B;

I closed my eyes to rest, although not for long. The distant sound of Bea’s voice kept me from lingering for too long.

&#x200B;

“Audrey?”

I opened my eyes before slowly starting to pick myself up again.

“Audrey?!”

&#x200B;

“I’m right here!” I called back, waving an arm so she’d see me.

She ran for me, pulling me into a bear hug that I’m pretty sure cracked my spine a little bit.

“Oh thank God… you’re okay!”

“I’m okay…” I said, before kissing her on the forehead.

“Did we do it?” She asked, “Did we really do it?”

&#x200B;

I nodded, although part of me wasn’t sure I actually believed it myself. I’d never heard of a Supremacy ship being downed before, and I sure as hell wouldn’t have believed it if I hadn’t seen it for myself! I gently wrapped my arms around Bea, holding her close as we clung to the moment.

&#x200B;

We were safe.

&#x200B;

We’d made it through.

&#x200B;

Somehow, we’d made it through…

&#x200B;

I rested my head against hers, wanting nothing more than to take a hot shower and lie in a warm bed. But those things would probably have to wait. We’d need to get out of here first.

&#x200B;

I felt Bea suddenly tense up in my arms, and looked down at her, only to realize that she was looking past me. I turned to look, only to feel something squeezing my body.

It wasn’t Bea. I don’t know what it was.

&#x200B;

“No…!” Bea cried in the instant before I was torn away from her. Something pulled me through the air, dashing me back against the rocks and knocking the wind out of me. I could see stars, but I couldn’t see what had grabbed me. Not at first.

“Get away from her!” Bea cried, and I heard her cry out in pain. From the corner of my eye, I could see her crashing to the ground, but I couldn’t see what had hit her.

&#x200B;

***‘Die.’***

&#x200B;

The thought appeared in my mind, and the feeling of it made my head hurt. I felt my knees buckling beneath me as I tried to stand. My vision blurred for a moment before I finally saw what it was that had come for us. I watched it start to climb out of the lake. Its gait was slow, deliberate and there was something uncertain and coltish about the way that it carried itself as if its balance wasn’t all there. At first I thought it was simply just another abomination. But no. No, this was something else entirely.

&#x200B;

It stood nearly eight feet tall, with long and slender limbs. Its head was large and pale, with black, pupilless eyes that took up most of its face. I’d heard about these things before, although as far as I knew, their existence was only theoretical. They were supposed to be some kind of leadership caste… some higher breed of the Supremacy that led the others. I never thought I’d see one in person, let alone have one try to kill me.

&#x200B;

The one coming out of the lake must have been the one piloting that ship… it must have survived. And now it was coming for me.

&#x200B;

The Alien raised a hand, and I felt a pressure form around my throat as I was pushed back to the ground.

&#x200B;

***‘Die.’***

&#x200B;

The word drifted through my mind again, blurring my vision. There was hatred in it… a hatred I understood. A hatred I shared.

&#x200B;

Teeth gritting as I strained to breathe against the unseen force that the Alien exuded on me, I glared back at it, hating it just as much as it hated me. Its eyes betrayed no emotion. There was nothing in them, only darkness. Its head tilted slightly to the side as it watched me die… and I knew that it was enjoying this. Savoring this moment. I could feel blackness creeping in along the edges of my vision. I could feel myself starting to fade.

&#x200B;

And somewhere in the distance, I heard screaming.

&#x200B;

I could see the shape of Bea rushing toward the Alien, my forgotten sledgehammer in her hand. She only barely had the strength to swing it. But she did the best she could. With a cry of exertion, she lifted the hammer and swung it in an awkward arc into the Alien’s back. It wasn’t exactly graceful, but it was enough. As the hammer struck it, the Alien’s body buckled. It didn’t fall, but it did stumble. The pressure on my throat vanished and I sucked in a lungful of air.

&#x200B;

The Alien looked over at Bea and raised a hand, launching her back again with its unseen power before its attention returned to me. But I was ready for it this time. I pulled the revolver from my waistband as I felt the pressure growing around my throat again, and before the creature before me realized what I was holding, I pulled the trigger.

&#x200B;

The Alien’s body jerked as the bullet tore through its slender chest. I heard it huff, as dark blood erupted from its mouth. For a moment it stood, empty eyes burning into mine. It swayed drunkenly, trying to keep its hand outstretched, but I could feel its power fading. The pressure on my throat was growing weaker and despite its efforts to keep fighting, it was fading fast.

&#x200B;

Its strength finally failed it. The Aliens legs gave out beneath it. It huffed again before listing forward and collapsing.

&#x200B;

It was dead.

&#x200B;

I tossed the spent revolver aside before getting up to tend to Bea. She was already picking herself up again.

“Can we just get the hell out of here?” She asked as I helped her to her feet.

I couldn’t think of anything I wanted more.

“Let’s…” I said, my throat still aching. I was done with this nightmare.

&#x200B;

The sound of quiet applause made me freeze before I could say another word. The moment I heard it, I felt my heart drop in my chest.

&#x200B;

No… *no*. No more of this…

&#x200B;

*“You really believe that we’re done here?”* A voice asked and slowly, Bea and I both turned to see a figure standing in the fog. Mr. Frost stood alone, clapping for us as if he’d just watched some kind of performance. I couldn’t see his face, but I knew that he was smiling.

&#x200B;

Slowly, I moved in front of Bea to shield her from him although I knew it wouldn’t do much good.

“I will give full credit where it’s due, Audrey. We did not anticipate that you two would hold your own so well against us… to take down one of ours… truly impressive! It seems that we’ve underestimated you at every turn! I must say, my Employers do find that a little refreshing! They are almost at a loss about what to do with you!”

“Go to hell,” I panted. “If you people even have a Hell.”

Mr. Frost just laughed. That laughter sent a chill through me.

“Oh, we know more of Hell than you could possibly imagine,” He replied. “And if you would like to see it firsthand… that can be arranged.”

&#x200B;

In the sky above him, I watched as several blue lights flickered to life. Five, ten, twenty. It didn’t take long before I lost count.

As I stared up at the lights in the sky, I found myself at a complete loss for words.

&#x200B;

“It’s been some time since my Employers have resorted to these methods, but you two have necessitated them. For what it’s worth, you should consider that an honor!” Mr. Frost said. “You two had a spectacular run though, so please don’t see this as a defeat! See it as a victory! You really did it, you won! And because of that, we can’t let you live! It’s nothing personal, you understand. Just standard operating procedure…”

&#x200B;

The blue light flashed again, and I watched as Mr. Frost began to vanish.

&#x200B;

I grabbed Bea by the hand, and pulled her toward the lake. She followed me, running behind me as the air around us began to grow hotter. We skidded down the rocks leading to the lake, feeling the heat rising around us. Bea reached the water first, and looked back as I joined her. The blue light that shone around us was almost blinding. The heat was beginning to get unbearable before we dove beneath the cool surface of the lake.

&#x200B;

Then the blast came.

&#x200B;

When Bea and I surfaced again, the cabin had been replaced with an inferno. The flames hadn’t quite reached the edge of the lake. They might not have thought we’d have the time to escape.

&#x200B;

I could still see the blue lights in the sky, although some of them were already starting to float higher up, past the fog and into the night. The few that remained moved out over the water, no doubt looking for us. But by the time they started scanning the lake, Bea and I had already made it further down the shore. We climbed back up the rocks and disappeared into the forest.

&#x200B;

It didn’t take us long to find our way to the neighboring cabin, where we took refuge in the shed.

Come morning, the lights were gone and so were we.

&#x200B;

Our neighbor was kind enough to give us a ride into town. From there, we were able to rent a car to get us back to Toronto.

&#x200B;

The drive was thankfully uneventful, although both of us had our eyes on the skies the whole time. Something told me that the Supremacy wasn’t naive enough to believe that we were really dead. But if they were watching us as we left, they never made any kind of move.

&#x200B;

From what I heard about the cabin, its destruction was ultimately attributed to some kind of electrical issue and I’m sure the Vogel Institute removed any remaining evidence of what really happened that night.

&#x200B;

Honestly… I was of two minds about leaving Tevam Sound. On one hand, part of me would miss the peaceful days that Bea and I had enjoyed there. On the other, I was happy to be back in more familiar territory. Bea had never actually been to Toronto before and I reasoned that so long as we were careful, I could introduce her to the things I loved so much about it. I couldn’t take her out in public, not yet, but I could still bring things to her! We wouldn’t lose the things that we’d gotten to enjoy in Tevam Sound together, we were just relocating, that was all! And after that display, we’d put on at the cabin, the Supremacy might even think twice about making another move on us!

Things were looking up… I wanted to believe that.

Things were looking up.

I wanted to believe that they finally were looking up.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

On our second night at the Toronto safehouse, I left to bring us back some dinner. There were other guards in the area. They should have seen something. Somebody should have seen *something*.

&#x200B;

But they all were adamant that they didn’t… they had no idea how Bea had gotten out from right under their noses. And unfortunately, I had no choice but to believe them. If anyone could have done it, it would have been Bea… she was smart enough.

&#x200B;

At least I knew that it wasn’t the Supremacy who’d taken her. The Supremacy wouldn’t have left a note behind.

&#x200B;

That fucking note…

&#x200B;

I read it, over and over again, trying to understand why. Trying to look for the hidden meaning in the words. But I found nothing.

&#x200B;

*Audrey*

&#x200B;

*When I told you that the last few weeks have been the best of my life… I meant it.*

&#x200B;

*All my life, I’ve been afraid. Afraid of being taken, afraid of being picked, afraid of being caught. But when I was with you, I finally felt like I was safe. I knew it was too good to be true. I think we both did. But I wanted to hold on to that feeling for as long as I could.*

&#x200B;

*The Supremacy have come for me twice now. I know that they’ll come for me again and as always, I find myself afraid. Only this time, the fear is different. I won’t allow you to die for me, Audrey. I don’t think I’m worth that. I don’t think they’ll go after you, once I’ve moved on. I hope I’m right.*

&#x200B;

*I know you won’t agree with what I’m doing, but I know that this is the best choice I could make right now. I promise you - I will be okay. I’ve hidden from them before. I can hide from them again and maybe one day, if things get better, we can see each other again. I’d like if we could, but I’ll understand if you don’t want to.*

&#x200B;

*Being with you has meant more to me than anything else and leaving you isn’t easy. But it’s the only thing I can do to make sure you stay alive.*

&#x200B;

*I hope you can forgive me.*

&#x200B;

*I love you.*

*Bea.*

&#x200B;

With the letter, she left a set of schematics. A way to duplicate the device she’d built at the cabin. I passed those along to the relevant team, along with the final notes I took during our last few debriefing sessions.

&#x200B;

And that was it.

&#x200B;

She was gone.

The job was done.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

I suppose that this whole endeavor hasn’t been for nothing. Putting aside my… emotional stake in the matter… we’ve still learned valuable information about the Supremacy. In fact, we now know more about our enemy than we’ve ever known. We know how to fight them. We know how to hurt them. We know how to kill them. I don’t know if they can feel fear… but if they can’t, I’ll be happy to educate them.

&#x200B;

And right now I’ve got nothing but time.
