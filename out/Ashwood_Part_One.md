*Where have you gone, O wayward son,
To the grove where the shadowed waters run?
The cedars weep with tongues of old,
Their roots entwined in graves grown cold.

A watcher waits with a crown of flies,
His voice like smoke, his hands unwise.
He calls your name in the cindered dust,
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

The harlot sings, the lamb is shorn,
The saints lie low, the beast is born.
But hark, the trumpet, the cleansing flood—
No sin endures the Savior’s blood.*




ALAN RUSSELL

We moved around a lot when I was younger. My dad was a carpenter and a pretty good one at that, always working on one project or another. As soon as he’d come back from his last deployment, he started working odd jobs, building tool sheds, fixing roofs, or even building whole houses. He built all the homes we’d lived in, which were always in very different places, sometimes on mountains, in fields, or in the middle of a forest. The more we moved, the smaller the houses got and eventually I looked forward to the time I’d spend sleeping in the back seat of our sedan, stretched out on the warm leather seats. 

By the time I was ten, my father had saved up enough money for us to move to the town my mom always talked about; to Ashwood, to a house with real neighbors, running water, and (supposedly) an Atari. 

My breath fogged up the backseat glass as the town passed by in a blur of dull, muted colors, my eager eyes taking in every detail. The houses here were old—older than any I’d ever lived in. Sturdy and square, their porches sagged under the weight of time, and their shutters hung at angles just crooked enough to make me wonder if they were watching me back.

Mom sat in the passenger seat, silent for once, her hands folded in her lap as if she were praying. She’d been different ever since Dad announced that we’d finally saved enough to move here. Quieter. More jittery. She didn’t even fight him when he said I should ride in the back, let alone try to sneak me snacks at gas stations. She just stared out the window, her fingers twitching in her lap as her eyes flitted across the street signs.

Dad, on the other hand, was beaming. “You’re gonna love it here, Alan,” he said for the hundredth time. “You’ll have a real room. A real neighborhood. And get this—an Atari.”

That got my attention. “Really?”

Dad laughed. “Swear to God. Kid who lived here before left it behind. You’ll probably have to clean it up, but—” He shrugged, shooting me a grin in the mirror. “Beats the hell out of sleeping in the car, huh?”

Our new house sat at the edge of a cul-de-sac, a faded yellow thing with chipped paint and a long-forgotten garden out front. A huge oak tree stretched over the roof, its gnarled roots breaking through the sidewalk in a way that made me think of grasping fingers.

Mom stayed in the car, staring up at the house with a look I didn’t understand—fixed firmly between desperation and defiance. Dad kissed her cheek, then jerked his head toward the house. “C’mon, Al. Let’s go see your new room.”

I didn’t ask her what was wrong. I just climbed out after Dad, my sneakers crunching against the gravel. The house smelled like dust and disparate  dreams. The Atari was still there, just like Dad promised, stacked in a box next to a mess of tangled cords. The controllers were sticky with something I didn’t want to touch, and when I turned the console over, a brittle centipede husk fell out and landed on my shoe.

A place couldn’t be that scary if it had video games.

The next morning, Mom made me go outside. “Go find some kids to play with,” she said, already unpacking dishes, stacking them neatly next to the ones the old owners had left behind. “You can’t stay inside all summer.”

I wandered down the street, kicking at loose rocks, shoving my hands in my pockets to keep them from fidgeting. The neighborhood was nice enough—neatly trimmed lawns, bikes tipped over in driveways—but it was too quiet. Like the world was holding its breath.

Up ahead, there were four kids huddled under a carport, heads bent over something I couldn’t see. I hesitated for only a second before heading over.

“Hey,” I called, stuffing my nerves down into my gut next to my half-digested breakfast. “What’re you guys doing?”

A boy with shaggy brown hair and a Nintendo t-shirt looked up, eyeing me like I was some kind of alien. “Who’re you?”

“Alan,” I said. “We just moved here.”

The other kids glanced at each other. I suddenly became very conscious of of my unkempt appearance—torn jeans, my dad’s old army jacket, dirt smudged on my elbow from where I tripped earlier and pretended it didn’t happen.

Before the awkwardness could stretch too far, another kid—taller, strawberry blonde, with a baseball cap turned backward—grinned. “You ever play Street Fighter?”

I blinked. “Uh-huh,” I said, lying through my teeth.

He held up a battered cartridge like it was a golden ticket. “Then you’re in.”

That’s how I met Mac, Don, Kevin, and Heather.

Heather was different because she was a girl, but none of them seemed to care. She had wild, curly red hair and a way of looking at you like she already knew what you were going to say.

We played until the sun started to set, crowded around Mac’s TV in his half-unpacked living room. When I lost my fourth match in a row, Mac nudged me with his foot.

“You suck at this.”

“I do not,” I said, cheeks burning.

Heather leaned back on her hands, smirking. “Yeah, you do.”

And, to my immense shame, it immediately became 0-5.

Don snorted. Kevin just grinned. Mac laughed so hard he nearly choked on his soda.

And just like that, I had friends.



Mac had a treehouse, which wasn’t much more than a rickety platform nailed into an oak, but to us, it was a fortress. We spent most of the summer there, playing cards, throwing pebbles at passing cars, and talking about things we half-understood but pretended we knew everything about.  

“You ever hear about Robert Johnson?” Kevin asked one night, picking at a splinter in the wooden floor.  

The fireflies flickered around us, casting strange shadows against the wooden slats. The crickets had gone quiet. A humid wind rustled through the leaves, but somehow, it didn’t feel like a breeze—it felt like something shifting.  

Mac snorted. “Who?”  

“Some old blues guy,” Kevin said. “My uncle told me about him. Said he wasn’t always good at guitar, but then one day, outta nowhere, he was the best there ever was.”  

Heather raised an eyebrow. “So?”  

Kevin leaned forward. “So the story goes, he went down to the crossroads at midnight. Some man was waiting there. No one knows who he was—just a tall guy, real polite, real friendly. He tuned Johnson’s guitar, handed it back to him, and from then on, he could play better than anyone.”  

Don, who had been lying on his back staring at the ceiling, made a face. “That’s it? A guy helped him tune his guitar?”  

Kevin scowled. “No, idiot. He sold his soul to Old Scratch, to the Devil. That’s the story.”  

Mac kicked at the floorboards lazily. “People say stuff like that all the time.”  

Kevin ignored him. “My uncle said Johnson’s music was weird. Like, the way he played, the notes he used, even other musicians couldn’t figure it out. He’d just laugh if people asked him how he got so good.”  

Heather scoffed. “That’s so dumb. Maybe he just practiced.”  

Kevin shifted uncomfortably. “Yeah. Maybe.”  

Somewhere far off, a low hum filled the air. It was so faint I almost didn’t notice it—like the sound your ears make when you go too high in the mountains. A deep, buzzing pressure just beneath my skull, like your ears just before they pop.

No one else seemed to notice.  

I shivered and turned my gaze back to the woods. The darkness beyond the treehouse seemed too deep, too quiet.  

I remember having the strangest feeling that something was watching me.  




By the time school rolled around, I had mostly settled into life in Ashwood. My friends and I rode our bikes to school together, cut through empty lots, and raced past the houses with the meanest dogs.

The school itself was old—brick and linoleum and the smell of old books. It was smaller than the other schools I’d been to, and everyone already knew each other.

Some teachers called roll by first names only, not because they were trying to be cool, but because there was only one Heather, one Mac, one Don. I wasn’t just Alan—I was the new kid.

“Alan Russell,” my teacher called on the first day.

A few heads turned. I raised my hand.

Heather leaned over and whispered, “What’s your middle name?”

I sighed. “It’s Andrew.”

She smirked. “Alan Andrew Russell. Yeah, that tracks.”

I raised an eyebrow. “Tracks how?”

She shrugged. “I dunno. Just fits. Like a kid who always does his homework and never jaywalks.”

I scoffed. “I jaywalk all the time.”

Heather grinned. “Sure you do, Alan Andrew.”

We had lunch together, the five of us crammed around the same table, trading food and making fun of Mac because his mom packed him turkey sandwiches every single day.

“You’re gonna turn into a turkey,” Don said through a mouthful of Doritos.

Mac rolled his eyes. “Oh no. Then I’ll have to stop going to school and live in the woods forever.”

Kevin pointed at him with a chicken nugget. “Might improve your grades.”

That made all of us laugh, even Mac.

Heather nudged me. “What’d you bring?”

I pulled out my peanut butter sandwich and bag of pretzels. “Nothing special.”

Heather studied it, then reached over and took a pretzel without asking.

She did that a lot.

I let her.



Summer in Ashwood smelled like fresh-cut grass and hot pavement, like cherry popsicles melting onto your fingers and the faint chemical bite of chlorine at the town pool. It was the kind of summer that belonged in a movie—where the days stretched on forever, the nights buzzed with fireflies, and everything felt just a little bit more alive.

We had our routines.

Mornings were for baseball, afternoons for swimming, and evenings for whatever dumb plan Mac had come up with that day. If we weren’t at the pool, we were racing our bikes down Miller’s Hill, trying to hit every bump without flying over the handlebars. If we weren’t doing that, we were loitering outside the gas station, waiting for someone old enough to buy us sodas and gum.

And if we weren’t doing that—well, then we were probably getting into trouble.

“Alright, listen up, losers.” Mac slapped his glove against his palm, scanning our ragtag excuse for a baseball team. “We’ve got a big game today.”

Heather squinted at him. “Against who?”

Mac grinned. “Ourselves. Duh.”

She rolled her eyes. “So it’s not a big game.”

“It’s always a big game,” Don said, stretching out his arms like he was warming up for the major leagues.

Mac ignored them both. “Kevin, you’re batting first. Alan, you’re shortstop. Heather, you’re—” He squinted at her. “What’s that thing you suck at?”

Heather swung her glove at his head. “Catching.”

Mac ducked, grinning. “Right. So you’ll be in the outfield.”

Heather just flipped him off.

We played at the old baseball field behind the school, where the grass was patchy, the bases were just sun-bleached squares of plastic, and home plate had a crack running right down the middle. It was a crappy, unkempt mess, but it was ours.

Kevin stepped up to bat first, knocking the end of the wooden bat against the dirt. “If I hit a home run, you all have to buy me a soda.”

Mac snorted. “If you hit a home run, I’ll buy you a car.”

Kevin narrowed his eyes. “You don’t even have soda money.”

“Exactly.”

Kevin swung—and whiffed it completely.

Mac cackled. “Holy shit, that was pathetic.”

Heather whistled. “Swing and a miss, baby!”

Kevin scowled. “I tripped.”

“Maybe you should try tying your shoelaces,” Don muttered.

By the time we called it quits, we were sweaty, grass-stained, and covered in dirt. Heather had a scrape on her knee from sliding into second (“That was NOT a slide, that was a controlled fall!”), and Mac had taken a fastball to the stomach after Kevin got too ambitious.

He was still complaining about it when we left the field.

“You beaned me,” Mac whined, rubbing his ribs.

Kevin shrugged. “You were in the way.”

“It was a pop fly! How was I in the way?!”

“Alright, maybe I misjudged the angle—”

Mac reached over and smacked him with his glove, catching Kevin off-guard, gaping like a fish.

Heather laughed so hard she almost tripped over first base.



After baseball, the pool was necessary.

Ashwood only had one, and it was the kind of place where the lifeguards were always half-asleep, the concession stand only sold off-brand soda, and the diving board creaked like it was one cannonball away from snapping in half.

We loved it.

We changed in the locker rooms, the concrete floor cold against our bare feet, and raced each other out to the water.

Mac was always the first one in. He’d run full-speed and cannonball into the deep end, barely surfacing before yelling, “Belly flop contest!”

Kevin and Don immediately joined in.

Heather and I, meanwhile, stood at the edge of the pool, watching them launch themselves into the water like idiots.

Heather squinted at them. “They’re gonna crack their ribs one day.”

I smirked. “Hopefully today.”

She snorted. “What, so you can take over as our glorious leader?”

I shrugged. “Somebody has to.”

She nudged me. “I think you’d be a terrible leader.”

Before I could respond, she shoved me into the pool.

I barely had time to take a breath before I hit the water, the shock of cold sending a jolt through my whole body. I kicked back to the surface, gasping.

Heather was grinning down at me, hands on her hips.

“You’re the worst,” I sputtered.

She laughed. “You were taking too long.”

I swam to the edge of the pool, grabbing onto the ledge.

Heather’s curls were frizzing up from the humidity, the sunlight turning them a deep, fiery red, a thousand flickering flames curling around her face. I was used to her just being Heather, but something about the way the light hit her in that moment made my stomach do something weird.

I splashed her in the face.

She shrieked, stumbling back. “You ass!”

“Whoops,” I said, grinning.

She narrowed her eyes. “You know what? No mercy.”

And then she jumped in after me, dunking me under the water.

I didn’t even try to fight it.




Probably my favorite thing about living in Ashwood was the bike rides.

Back in the places I lived before, riding my bike was just a way to get from one empty lot to another, past houses too far apart to feel like a real neighborhood.

Here, it was an adventure.

Heather led the way, her legs pumping furiously as she cut down a narrow dirt path behind the school. Don and Kevin were close behind her, shouting at each other over who would get there first, and Mac rode at my side, occasionally bumping his shoulder into mine just to throw me off balance.

“You ever been this way before?” he asked.

I shook my head, slightly out of breath. “Nope.”

“Good.” Mac grinned. “Hope you don’t scare easy.”

That set off a very loud argument between Kevin and Don over who was the bravest of the group as we rode into a particularly gnarled part of the bike path, where I had to dodge several errant branches.

“I swear, you guys argue over everything,” Heather groaned. “Next you’ll be debating who has the best breakfast cereal.”

Kevin pointed at her. “Cinnamon Toast Crunch. End of discussion.”

We rode hard for about twenty minutes, eventually skidding to a stop near the edge of a clearing where the woods thickened. Just beyond it, hidden past a grove of tall pines, was a huge campsite with cabins, a mess hall, and a big outdoor fire pit, with logs stacked in neat rows nearby.


“What’s that place?” I asked, awestruck.

Mac followed my gaze. “Oh, that’s the Phoenician Grove.”

“The what?”

Heather pulled out a water bottle, taking a sip before answering. “It’s some club. For families that have been here a long time or for important people. They have like a summer camp out here every year. Some of the older kids work there, but they don’t hire kids our age.”

Interesting. I squinted, mulling this over. “Can we go play over there?”

Don shrugged. “We probably shouldn’t. There’s usually nobody there, but they get weird about it.”

Kevin, apparently over the last argument, slapped Mac’s back. “C’mon, race you back to the treehouse.”

Mac grinned. “You’re on.”


That night, we camped out in Mac’s treehouse again.

The air was warm, the crickets were loud, and the fireflies blinked in and out of the dark like tiny ghosts. Kevin had brought a bag of marshmallows, which we roasted over a candle Heather had smuggled from her house. If we watched closely, far off in the mountains, we could see brown lights glowing amongst the trees.

“I give us, like, five minutes before Mac sets the treehouse on fire,” Don said, popping a slightly burned marshmallow into his mouth.

Mac scowled. “I know how to handle fire, Don.”

“I dunno, man,” Kevin said, nudging a melted glob of marshmallow off his shorts. “You did try to microwave a Pop-Tart in the foil once.”

“That was an experiment.”

Heather smirked. “Yeah, an experiment in how to burn down your kitchen.”

Mac threw a marshmallow at her.

We talked until we got too tired to keep our eyes open, our voices growing slow and slurred, our laughter softer, warmer.

I was lying on my back, staring at the stars through the tree branches, when Heather whispered, “Hey, Alan?”

I turned my head.

She was looking at me, her curls fanned out against the sleeping bag.

She didn’t say anything else, she just smiled at me, the kind of slow smile that made my heart jump and leap around in my chest like an Olympic gymnast preparing for a routine. In the grand scheme of things, it wasn’t a big moment or even anything important.

But later, I’d think about it.







KEVIN SHERMAN


There were three types of kids at Ashwood Middle:
Kids who took school seriously. (Nerds.)
Kids who pretended to take school seriously so their parents wouldn’t kill them. (Spineless nerds.)
Legends.

I was a legend.

Not officially—no one had put up a plaque or anything—but I figured it was only a matter of time

I had the highest score on the Pac-Man machine at the gas station, I could make an entire paper football field goal from across the lunchroom (verified by witnesses), and I was the undisputed king of sneaking contraband snacks into class. 

Mac, for example, thought he was also a legend. Which was patently ridiculous, because no one could have two legends in one friend group. (There were rules.)

Heather thought I was a moron. She wasn’t wrong, exactly, but she didn’t have to say it out loud all the time.

Don was alright, but he had a moral compass, which made some things harder.

And Alan—Alan had potential, but he was too nice to ever reach full legend status.

We all sat together in every class we could. Well, except for Heather, because for some reason, the teachers never put her next to us. It was like they knew she was our ringleader, even if she pretended otherwise. 

There were other kids in school, obviously. You couldn’t just have us, because then it’d be weird, like one of those sitcoms where the same five people are the only people in the whole town.

Some of them were alright.

There was Brandon Collins, who could burp the entire alphabet and smelled like he lived in a basement. Jenny Parsons, who once broke a kid’s nose in fourth grade and now had a weird sort of power over the entire school. Nick Holloway, who brought raw hot dogs for lunch every day and ate them like that was a normal thing to do.

Then there were kids like Trevor Holloway, who only talked about his dad’s car, or Laura Greenfield, who was so rich that she had two Tamagotchis, and when one died, she just threw it away.

Psychotic behavior, really.

School wasn’t bad, exactly, but it was the same every day. You woke up, dragged yourself to class, and sat through lectures that only pretended to be interesting.

Our history teacher, Mr. Corbin, had been working at Ashwood Middle since before our parents had gone there, and he acted like that gave him some kind of godly authority.

“Mr. Walsh,” he said one afternoon, as I was folding the world’s greatest paper football, “would you like to tell the class what year the Declaration of Independence was signed?”

“Uhh…” I stalled.

Mac, from his desk, mouthed 1776 at me.

I narrowed my eyes. Was he messing with me?

I glanced at Heather, who had her head down like she wanted no part in this.

Alan had a pained look on his face, like he was debating whether or not to help me.

Don looked mildly amused, which meant he definitely wasn’t going to help.

I took a shot. “Uhhh… 1756?”

Mr. Corbin sighed the deepest sigh known to man.

Mac dropped his head onto his desk with a thud.

Mr. Corbin didn’t even get mad, which somehow made it worse. He just looked at me in the way that only a middle aged man reconsidering his life’s choices could.


After school, we’d bike over to Carson’s Gas & Convenience, which was the place to be if you had two dollars and no parental supervision. It was a run down old gas station that had probably peaked in the mid-60’s, evident by the outdated memorabilia that lined the walls, aisles, and even the pumps. The most disturbing part of it were the countless missing posters that lined one wall, a collection of children about our age that seemed to grow larger and larger every year.

Carson Wells, the owner, was about ninety years old and only half-paid attention to what any of us were doing. The police had come to him to try and get him to take down the disturbing posters, but he pulled his usual I’m an old man routine and shooed them off.

Heather and I had a routine:

I would distract Carson with important questions (“Carson, if I steal a candy bar but then put it back later, is it still a crime?”).
 
Heather would grab as much gum and candy as she could.

We’d make a big deal about buying a single pack of baseball cards. 
  
Profit.

Alan never took anything, but he also never stopped us.

Don sometimes took a soda, but only if we peer-pressured him into it. 

Mac got banned from the store for trying to sneak out with a whole jar of pickles (“I wanted to see if I could!”).

The best thing about fall in Ashwood was that nobody actually watched the middle school football games.

Sure, there were parents in the bleachers, but they were only paying attention when their kid was on the field.

That left the rest of us free to run wild.

We spent most of the games under the bleachers, trading packs of Big League Chew and making bets on things like how many hot dogs Keith Sherman could eat before throwing up (the answer: five).

It was the kind of fall night that smelled like damp grass and distant bonfires, where the air was cool enough to keep the mosquitoes away but not cold enough to need a jacket. The metal framework of the bleachers rattled every time the crowd above shifted. The game was happening somewhere in the distance, but none of us were paying attention.

Mac was flicking bottle caps at Don, who was blocking them with his forearm like some kind of battle-hardened knight. Kevin was tearing into a pack of red vines with all the grace of a starving raccoon. Heather sat cross-legged on the dirt, idly picking 
at the peeling label on a stolen soda bottle.

And Alan—Alan was staring up through the gaps in the bleachers like he was actually thinking about climbing them.

I watched him tilt his head, tracking the beams like he was mapping a route.

“You’re not seriously about to do that,” I said.

Alan blinked. “What?”

Heather followed my gaze, raising an eyebrow. “Oh my God. Are you planning to climb the bleachers?”

Alan shrugged. “I mean, theoretically—”

“No.”

Mac grinned. “I think he should do it.”

Kevin tossed a red vine at him. “You just want to see him eat it.”

Mac grinned wider. “Obviously.”

Alan sighed. “I wasn’t actually going to climb anything.”

Heather smirked. “Sure.”

“I wasn’t.”

Don crossed his arms. “But you thought about it.”

Alan hesitated, and that was all the proof we needed.

Kevin whistled. “That’s some real reckless behavior, man.”

“Truly shameful,” I added.

Heather shook her head, clicking her tongue. “And here I thought you were the responsible one.”

Alan groaned, rubbing his face. “I am responsible.”

Mac snorted. “Yeah, responsible for bad ideas.”

Alan muttered something under his breath, but I caught the corner of a reluctant smile.

Above us, the crowd roared. Someone must’ve scored, but none of us moved to check. Instead, we stayed where we were, where the air smelled like dirt and candy and the metal beams cast weird shadows across the grass. Mac started flicking bottle caps at Kevin and Heather took another sip of stolen soda. 

And Alan kept looking up at the bleachers, not climbing them, just thinking about it.






MAC PETERSON


“We’re gonna die.”

Alan said it like a fact, like we were already ghosts, doomed to haunt the banks of Hollow Creek for all eternity.

Kevin adjusted his grip on the rope. “Only if you let go at the wrong time.”

“That is exactly what I’m worried about.”

Heather sat cross-legged on a rock, peeling the label off a Coke bottle. “If Alan won’t go, I’ll go next.”

Kevin smirked. “See? Heather isn’t scared.”

Heather shrugged. “I mean, I am, but if I die, at least I’ll look cool doing it.”

I rolled my eyes. “You guys are idiots.”

Kevin grinned. “Obviously.” Then, without another word, he launched himself off the bank.

The rope stretched, held—then swung him straight over the water.

For half a second, he actually looked graceful.

Then he let go.

And immediately belly-flopped into the creek.

A loud SMACK  resonated across the water.

Don winced. “Ooooh, that had to hurt.”

Alan groaned. “I am not going after him.”

Kevin’s head popped up a second later, gasping. “That was awesome.”

Heather snorted. “You look like you just lost a fight with a beaver.”

Kevin flipped her off, half-laughing, half-choking. “Someone else go.”

I grabbed the rope. “Fine. Watch a pro.”

The thing about rope swings is you have to time it perfectly. Too soon, and you’d hit the water at a weird angle. Too late, and you’d crash right into the far bank.

I, obviously, had perfect timing.

I swung out, let go at just the right second, and hit the water clean, slicing through the surface like a human torpedo.

When I surfaced, Heather nodded approvingly.

Alan sighed. “I guess I’ll go next.”

His swing was fine. His landing? Not so much.

After a few hours of splashing around, seeing who could spike their wet hair into the craziest shapes (Heather won), and grabbing each other's ankles under the water, we decided to get out, giggling at how pruney our hands were. I suddenly became very aware of how quiet it was, now that our splashing and laughing no longer filled the air, a sudden prickling sensation raising the hairs on the back of my neck. For just a moment, I could have sworn I saw a silhouette in the trees, but Kevin snapped me out of my overly-hydrated stupor.

“Mac. Mac!” Kevin said, grabbing me by the shoulders and shaking.

“What?” I said, scrunching up my face and pushing him away.

“You forgot to do the Induction Ceremony.” Kevin said, grinning eagerly, like a cruel aristocrat excited to watch an execution.

Unfortunately, he was right. For the few months that we’d known Alan, I had completely forgotten about The Tunnel. 

The Tunnel sat on the edge of town, just past one of the many fracking sites that littered our mountain range. A gaping maw of rusted steel, half-sunk into the earth, leading down into something too dark to see the end of. It was part of the old infrastructure, long abandoned—at least, that’s what the adults said.  

But everyone at school knew the truth.  

The tunnel wasn’t empty.  

Jenny Parson said it was haunted by miners who never made it out. Brandon Collins swore there was a thing in there, something with no eyes and too many teeth. Most kids said it was just a sewer line that got cut off when the new construction started.  

All we knew was this: if you wanted to be part of our group, you had to walk all the way to the end, touch the old support beam, and come back.  

No exceptions.  

Alan had been part of our group for months, but not officially. Not until tonight.  


“Alright, Alan,” Kevin said, draping an arm over his shoulder like a sage old mentor about to impart some great wisdom. “You’ve been with us long enough. It’s time for us to make it official.”

Alan looked between us, brow furrowed in confusion. “Official?”

I smiled like a wolf before a flock of sheep. “The Induction Ceremony.”

I gestured dramatically toward the rusted metal entrance of the tunnel, half-buried in the ground just past the fracking site. Its wide mouth yawned open like a giant drainpipe leading to nowhere.

“You walk to the end of the tunnel, touch the last support beam, and come back,” I explained, barely holding back a grin.

“That’s it?” Alan asked, his brow furrowed, still wary.

Don snorted. “Yeah, that’s it. Unless you believe the stories.”

Alan narrowed his eyes. “What stories?”

Kevin leaned in, lowering his voice. “Some people say it’s an old mining tunnel. Others say it was built for fracking but abandoned when they started hearing—” he wiggled his fingers for dramatic effect, “strange noises. No one knows how far it really goes. Some say if you go deep enough, you never come back.”

Alan rolled his eyes. “Oh, please.”

“If it’s so easy, then do it.” Don said, crossing his arms.

Alan hesitated.

That’s when I knew we had him.

“I dunno, guys,” Heather said, arms crossed. “Maybe we should—”  

Kevin groaned. “Oh my God, Heather. He’ll be fine.”  

Alan stood at the entrance, staring into the tunnel like he was already regretting every decision that had brought him here.  

Heather shifted uncomfortably. “I just don’t think we have to make him do it. He’s already part of the group.”

Kevin clutched his chest in mock offense. “Heather, are you questioning the sacred traditions of The Induction Ceremony?”

“I’m questioning whether we should shove our friend into an actual hole in the ground,” she shot back.

Alan sighed, glancing at Heather. “It’s fine,” he said, but he didn’t sound convinced.  

Don clapped a hand on his shoulder. “It’s tradition, man.”  

Heather wasn’t buying it. “It’s stupid.”  

Kevin shot her a look. “You did it.”  

Heather huffed. “Yeah, when I was eight and didn’t have enough brain cells to know better.”  

Alan ran a hand through his hair. “I’ll just… go in, touch the thing, and come back. That’s it?”  

I nodded. “That’s it.”  

The tunnel yawned open in front of him.  

Alan took a deep breath.  

Then he stepped inside, the tunnel swallowing him whole.

We stood outside the entrance, watching as his silhouette shrank into the darkness. The deeper he went, the more the shadows consumed him, until only the faint shuffling of his footsteps echoed back.

Heather shifted beside me. “This is a bad idea.”

“Relax,” Kevin said. “We all did it, and we’re fine.”

Heather didn’t look convinced.

Kevin rocked back on his heels. “Think he’ll run back screaming?”  

Don shrugged. “Hope not. I bet two sodas on him making it.”  

Heather wasn’t laughing, something in her posture was off—not just impatient, but tense.  

I nudged her. “Uh… you good?”  

She didn’t answer right away, nervously rubbing her hands.

Then—so quiet I almost didn’t hear it, she muttered, “It’s too quiet.”  

I frowned. “Yeah, no shit. It’s a tunnel in the middle of nowhere.”  

“No,” she said, sharper this time. “Listen.”  

I did, and… the wind had stopped, no distant highway noise, no cicadas, no birds.  

Just silence, then a sound, not Alan’s footsteps, but… something else.

A low, thrumming hum reverberated through the ground, deep and distant, like the world itself was breathing. The tunnel vibrated faintly, as if the hum was coming from inside it.

Alan stopped walking.

“Guys?” His voice was faint, swallowed by the darkness.

The hum deepened.

Heather tensed. “Alan, come back.”

The ground shifted.  

Heather’s eyes went wide. “Alan,” she whispered.  

Then she ran.  

Alan turned back towards us, hesitating for only a second before breaking into a jog. His hurried footsteps echoed, doubling back toward us, faster, uneven, like he was stumbling—

The hum grew louder, the pitch deeper. The air tightened, pressing against my ears like we were too deep underwater. I felt it in my ribs, vibrating in my bones, a pressure more than a sound, something below us, something ancient waking up—

Alan was almost at the end when we felt it.  

 A pressure, low in our skulls, like the air had just dropped out of the tunnel.  

The entrance was too far, the darkness behind Alan too close.

“Alan!” Heather’s voice echoed through the tunnel, muted and hollow.

Alan stumbled, narrowly avoiding bashing his head on the metal grated floor below. Heather caught him, her hands firmly grabbing his jacket, yanking him forward, dragging him out of the tunnel. The second they broke out into the surface, the hum stopped. The wind returned and so too did the distant sounds of birds, of crickets, of nature, of the world. Alan collapsed onto the dirt, gasping.  

The rest of us just stared.  

Don blinked. “Jesus, what happened to you?”  

Alan looked at the tunnel, then at us, then—at Heather.  

Heather, out of breath, her face as red as her hair, still firmly gripping the back of Alan’s jacket.  

She swallowed once, managing to catch her breath, then standing up.

Brushing the dirt off her hands, she muttered, “This was a stupid idea.”  

And then, because Kevin had zero self-preservation instincts, he started clapping.

“Ladies and gentlemen,” he declared, “Alan Russell is officially one of us!”

Heather punched his arm. “Seriously?”

“What?” Kevin grinned. “He made it, didn’t he?”

Alan, still catching his breath, ran a hand through his hair. “That was awful.”

“Awful, yet completed.” I nudged his shoulder. “Welcome to the club, man.”

Alan huffed out a laugh. “I hate you guys.”

Heather eyed him. “Did you hear that humming noise?”

Alan hesitated. Then shook his head. “I don’t know. It was probably just the drilling.”

Heather glanced at the tunnel. The entrance was dark. Still.

I threw an arm around Alan’s shoulder, steering him back toward our bikes. “Alright, our work here is done. Let’s get back before Kevin starts inducting us into more ceremonies.”

Kevin wagged a finger. “Actually, there is a secondary financial initiation—”

“Nope.” Don grabbed him by the collar, dragging him away. “You lost your privileges and you owe me two sodas, which Alan will not be paying for.”

Alan was still shaking his head as we hopped on our bikes.

As we rode off towards my house, the tunnel sat behind us, waiting.

And if I listened carefully, just beneath the rustling leaves and the hum of our tires against the road—I thought I could still hear it.

A hum, deep and patient. Waiting.

I shook off the feeling and pedaled harder to catch up with the rest of my friends.

When we reached my house, the five of us made a beeline past my parents, pounding up the stairs like a horde of noisy, messy elephants. My house wasn’t the biggest, but it was the only place in Ashwood that had a Super NES—state-of-the-art, sleek and gray, like something out of a futuristic movie. The first time I saw it sitting in my room, I felt like I was standing in the presence of something holy.

The rest of my friends had old Commodore 64 systems, or maybe a battered Atari if they were lucky. But the SNES? That was something else.

And I knew it.

I sat on my bed, leaning back against the wall, a grin plastered across my face. “Alright, who’s ready to get their ass handed to them?”

Kevin grabbed a controller. “Big words for someone who still cries when he loses at Monopoly.”

I scowled. “That was one time, and you cheated.”

“I did not cheat.”

“You stole from the bank, Kevin.”

Kevin waved a dismissive hand. “Listen, all finances are a gray area.”

I ignored them, grabbing the third controller before Alan could. I wasn’t about to let the new guy get a head start in Mario Kart.

We booted up the game, the familiar jingle filling the room as the opening screen popped up.

Alan sat cross-legged on the floor, studying the menu like it was some ancient text he needed to decipher. “So, uh… how do you play?”

Heather, sitting beside him, smirked. “You drive.”

Alan shot her a look. “I figured that much.”

“You also lose,” I added. “A lot.”

Kevin cackled. “He’s right. We don’t go easy in this house.”

Alan narrowed his eyes. “What if I’m, like, naturally gifted?”

I barked out a laugh. “Sure, sure. Natural talent will save you from the wrath of my red shells.”

Alan rolled his shoulders like an athlete preparing for a championship game. “Alright. Bring it on.”

Twenty minutes later, Alan was screaming.

“WHO KEEPS HITTING ME?”

Heather leaned back against my bed, sipping her soda. “That’d be me.”

“STOP.”

Kevin was dying of laughter. “This kid thinks he can escape the green shell.”

“I had first place! Had! Past tense!”

I just smirked. “Welcome to the real world, Russell. Nothing is fair.”

Alan clenched his jaw. “Okay. Okay. New game. New race. I got this.”

Heather grinned. “That’s the spirit.”

Then she hit him with another shell.

Alan’s soul left his body.
