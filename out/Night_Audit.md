**Check-In**

 

I answer the ad because I’m desperate.

"Night Auditor Needed – Immediate Start – Room Included – No Experience Required." It screams red flags, sure, but after two weeks of sleeping in my car, red flags look like roses.

The motel is way out beyond the edge of town, where the road thins into a black ribbon and the trees lean in like they’re listening. I drive past fields gone fallow and barns with their bones exposed, until I see the neon flicker: Ridgeway Inn. Half the letters are dead. Of course they are.

The place looks abandoned except for the thin, flickering porch light and a single figure sitting in the office window.

He’s waiting for me.

The man introduces himself as Mr. Granger. He’s pale, like he hasn't slept in years, and his smile stretches too long—thin lips over too many teeth. His suit is old-fashioned and perfectly pressed.

“You’re punctual,” he says, motioning for me to come inside.

The office smells like mildew and something sweet underneath it, like rotting fruit. A large old book sits on the counter beside a cracked bell. The register looks older than the motel itself.

“I’ll be straight with you,” Granger says, folding his hands. “This job isn't like others. You’ll work from midnight to 7 a.m. That’s when the guests arrive. You check them in, never out. You clean nothing. You answer no questions. You follow the rules exactly. If you fail, you die.”

I laugh nervously. He doesn’t.

He slides a yellowed piece of paper across the counter. The heading reads:

Rules for the Night Auditor at Ridgeway Inn

1.       Never enter Room 6. Ever.  
2. When the man with no eyes asks for a room, give him the key to 9. Do not speak.  
3. If you hear a child crying, check the cameras. If no child appears, do not leave the office.  
4. Do not fall asleep. No matter how tired you get.  
5. At 3:33 a.m., the lobby phone will ring. Answer, say nothing, hang up.  
6. If a guest offers you something—refuse. Even if it's money. Especially if it’s food.  
7. You may see yourself in the lobby mirror. Don’t speak to it.

8. If something knocks on the door after 4am ignore it.

“There are more,” Granger says. “But those are the ones you’ll need tonight.”

I stare at the page, then at him. My mouth is dry.

“What happens if I break a rule?”

He smiles again. His teeth are even longer now. “You’ll wish you hadn’t.”

He leads me to the small back office where a wall of ancient, black-and-white security monitors flickers. There’s a rickety swivel chair, a desk with a massive leather-bound logbook, and the motel key rack. Every key is metal, rusted, and hung on a hook beneath its number. Rooms 1 through 13.

He leaves me there at 11:58 p.m.

At midnight, the air changes.

The heat vanishes. The world gets still. Not quiet—still. Like the night is holding its breath.

12:07 a.m., the door creaks open.

The man who steps in has no eyes. Just sunken sockets leaking a black, oily substance. He doesn’t speak. I remember the rule. Wordlessly, I slide him the key to Room 9.

He takes it, and for a moment, I feel something slither across my hand. Cold. Wet. Not his fingers.

He vanishes down the hallway.

I look at the monitors. Room 9’s camera is dark, just static.

1:14 a.m., the child begins to cry.

It’s a soft, broken sob, like someone lost. I check the monitors—every hallway, every angle.

Nothing.

The crying gets louder.

I want to check the hallway. Just to be sure.

But I remember the rule.

Instead, I sit still and let my skin crawl with every second the sobbing continues.

At 2:46 a.m., I see something in the mirror. My reflection is waving at me. I’m not waving back.

My hands are trembling.

3:33 a.m., the phone rings.

It sounds like screaming.

I answer. Say nothing. Hang up.

The phone bleeds from the earpiece. Something thick and black.

At 4:10 a.m., someone knocks on the door. Five times.

I freeze. I wait.

Another knock. Slower.

I say nothing.

It leaves.

The rest of the shift crawls. When morning finally comes, light slithers across the floor like it's scared to enter.

Mr. Granger appears at 7:01 a.m. sharp.

He looks me over like someone inspecting meat.

“You made it,” he says. “Good.”

I want to run, but I also want to stay. I need the money. I need the room.

But deep down, something else roots me here.

Like the motel wants me.

“Same time tomorrow,” he says.

I nod.

Behind me, Room 6’s doorknob slowly turns.

**Guests Who Never Leave**

 

I don’t sleep.

Even after I leave the office, the motel seems to follow me. The wind outside whispers in voices I can’t quite understand. My free room is number 2. The bed is stiff and smells like mothballs. The wallpaper peels in strips, and sometimes, if I stare long enough, I swear I see something squirming beneath it.

By 10 p.m., I’m already dressed and sitting on the edge of the bed.

At 11:30, I go to the office.

Granger isn’t there this time.

Instead, a small note sits on the counter, tucked beneath the guest log:

“New rules for tonight. Read carefully.”

Night Two – Addendums to Rules

8. Room 4 is now off-limits. The guest inside is not human.  
9. If the woman in white asks for her husband, lie. Say he checked out. Say it firmly.  
10. You may hear whispering behind the file cabinet. Do not move it. Do not respond.  
11. The bell on the front desk may ring by itself. When it does, say “Not tonight.” Then bow.

I want to quit. I should quit.

But something about this place grips me by the spine.

Midnight comes like a knife sliding across the sky.

The temperature drops instantly. The air hums with something electric.

At 12:23 a.m., the bell rings.

No one is there.

I whisper, “Not tonight.”

I bow.

The sound that follows is… pleasure. Something wet and gurgling. It giggles.

I glance at the mirror behind the desk. My reflection isn’t moving. It’s just standing there, breathing hard.

1:02 a.m., a knock at the front door.

It’s her.

She wears a white gown, soaked at the hem, and her hair drips like she just stepped out of a river. Her eyes are too wide, too bright. Her skin is pale and sagging in places, like she’s held together with thread.

“Have you seen my husband?” she asks.

Her voice is cracked porcelain.

I choke down the lump in my throat.

“He… he checked out.”

Her smile is slow. Her teeth are wrong.

“Oh… good.”

She turns and drifts back down the hallway, her feet never touching the floor.

Room 4’s door creaks open as she passes it. I slam my eyes shut. The camera for Room 4 fizzles into black.

2:18 a.m., whispering behind the file cabinet. It’s my name.

Darrell… Darrell…

Over and over, like a lover calling from under the bed.

I put on my headphones. I don’t even plug them in. I just need the illusion of silence.

At 3:33, the phone rings again.

This time, when I pick it up, something breathes.

Slow, deep, and so close I can feel the air across my cheek.

I hang up.

The phone melts slightly in my hand. Plastic warps like flesh on a stovetop. But no pain. Just the smell of burnt skin.

4:45 a.m., something new.

The guest log writes by itself.

One by one, names appear in jagged ink.

Mina Caldwell – Room 6  
Travis Aimes – Room 4  
Julian Bishop – Room 12  
Darrell Cole – ???

My name.

I try to scratch it out, but the pen won’t write anymore.

Suddenly the camera for Room 12 flares to life.

Julian Bishop is sitting on the bed. Staring directly into the camera.

He smiles.

Then his mouth opens wider than it should, wider than anything natural.

And from inside it, something crawls.

It moves toward the lens. Fast.

I rip the power cord from the wall.

Every monitor flickers and goes dark.

At 6:59 a.m., Granger returns. He's smiling again.

Only now, his smile stretches from cheek to cheek like a wound.

“You're still here,” he says.

He sounds disappointed.

I don’t say anything.

He places a hand on my shoulder. It's cold. Damp. Like a corpse that’s just been pulled from a lake.

“You’re getting the hang of it. But they like you, Darrell. They really like you.”

I want to scream. Instead, I nod.

I survive the second night.

But something follows me to Room 2. I hear breathing in my closet all day.

I try not to blink too long.

Because when I do, I see Room 6 in my dreams.

The door is always open.

And someone inside is calling my name.

**Final Shift**

 

I’m not sure what time I wake up.

There’s no sun here anymore. The windows in Room 2 are pitch black, like something painted over the glass from the outside. I can hear scratching behind the walls now. Not rats. Not pipes. Breathing.

I should leave.

But I don’t.

Something’s changed. Not just in the motel—but in me. The air tastes different. The shadows bend when I walk by. My reflection isn’t in the mirror this morning. It stayed behind.

At 11:45 p.m., I make my way to the office.

Granger is waiting.

He’s smiling again, but now his face is… hollow. Skin pulled tight, eyes black and sunken. His mouth doesn’t open when he speaks.

“Tonight is your final shift,” he says. “You’ve lasted longer than most.”

He slides the rules across the counter. I don’t want to touch them, but my fingers move on their own.

Night Three – Final Instructions

12. Tonight, all the doors will open. Do not leave the office. Not for any reason.  
13. You will be called by name from Room 6. Three times. Do not respond.  
14. At 4:00 a.m., someone will knock from inside the office closet. Do not let them out.  
15. At 6:00 a.m., you must choose.

“Choose what?” I ask.

Granger just says, “You’ll see.”

He walks out the front door, and for a brief moment, I see what’s beyond the motel.

It’s not trees.

It’s not sky.

It’s a wall of black—shifting, writhing. Something ancient pressing against the skin of this world, and this motel is the scab holding it back.

I lock the office door behind me.

Midnight.

Every door down the hall opens at once.

One by one, the cameras show them coming out.

Room 1. A man with no legs dragging himself across the floor, leaving trails of ash.

Room 3. A woman holding her own severed head in her arms, whispering lullabies to it.

Room 8. A child with no face.

Room 12. Julian Bishop again, only now his mouth takes up half his skull. Something inside it watches me.

Then—Room 6.

The door is open.

But the camera is still dark.

12:43 a.m., the first call.

“Darrell…” A woman’s voice. Soft. Familiar.

I don’t answer.

1:12 a.m., second call.

“Darrell… it’s cold… come help me…”

I grip the edge of the desk until my knuckles crack.

2:06 a.m., the third call.

“Darrell. We’re waiting.”

The door to the office rattles. I back away. Something heavy presses against it, sniffing.

At 3:30 a.m., I see myself walk past the cameras.

But I’m still in the office.

My double moves door to door, unlocking each one, bowing to every guest like a butler. At Room 6, it stops and knocks.

Then it turns and stares directly into the lens.

It grins.

4:00 a.m.

The closet in the office begins to shake.

Slow, at first. Then violently.

Knocking. Not fists—fingernails.

They scrape the inside of the door like something buried alive.

“Let me out,” it whispers.

It sounds like me.

I pull the desk in front of the closet. I press my back to it. I cry.

I don’t know when I started crying.

The knocking goes on for 47 minutes.

At exactly 6:00 a.m., everything stops.

Silence.

Stillness.

Granger enters, but he’s not wearing a suit anymore.

He’s wearing my skin.

“I told you there’d be a choice,” he says. “And you made it.”

I try to scream. I can’t.

I look down at my hands.

They’re fading. Becoming transparent. Dust.

Granger hands the guest book to me.

“Sign in,” he says.

I don’t want to. But my hands move on their own.

I write my name beneath the others:

Darrell Cole – Permanent Guest

And then I’m gone.

I don’t mean I disappear. I mean I’m not me anymore.

I’m standing behind the front desk.

The chair is warm.

The rules are in front of me.

A new name is written on the top of a fresh page.

A new applicant is coming.

I’m smiling.

Do Not Come to Ridgeway Inn

If you see the ad—Don’t apply.

If you pass the sign—Don’t stop.

If someone you know says they work here—They’re already gone.

There’s no leaving once you check in.

And we’re always hiring.
