# “The Strangers Who Left No Footprints”

I thought the house was normal. At least at first.

It was an old farmhouse. The kind you don’t think twice about. The kind you expect to find tucked away in the country, with tall grass in the yard and a faded mailbox at the end of a long, winding road.

I didn’t expect anything to happen. I just needed a change of scenery — somewhere isolated. Somewhere quiet.

The first night I stayed there, I woke up in the middle of the night, feeling like something was wrong. You know that feeling, right? Like you’re being watched, even though no one is there.

I checked the windows, double-locked the door, and eventually went back to sleep.

When I woke up again in the morning, there were footprints.

They weren’t mine.

I live alone. No one had been there.

But there they were — in the dust of the hallway, a trail leading from the front door to the kitchen. The dirt from outside still clung to them. I tried to rationalize it, thought maybe I had left the door open by accident. Maybe an animal had wandered in. But no. These weren’t animal prints.

They were human.

Big, wide footsteps, as if whoever had walked through that door didn’t care about making noise. The footsteps weren’t like normal ones, though. They didn’t leave the usual shape of a heel or toes. They were almost *too perfect* — round and smooth, as though they were made by something… unnatural.

I followed the prints. They led into the kitchen and then… stopped. Right in the middle of the floor.

Now, I know what you’re thinking: Maybe I’m just paranoid. Maybe it was all in my head. But that feeling? That prickling sensation at the back of my neck? It never left.

I checked the house thoroughly. Every room. Every corner. Nothing seemed off — except for the *prints*.

A few days passed. I started to get comfortable. But then… it happened again.

More footprints.

This time, they weren’t just in the house. They were outside too. I found them on the porch, then on the steps leading down to the garden. And they weren’t just footprints anymore. Now there were *marks*, long, drag-like streaks, as if something had been dragged through the dirt.

I tried to tell myself I was just losing it. Maybe someone else had come by in the middle of the night, played a prank. But it didn’t make sense.

Nobody lived around here. The nearest neighbor was miles away.

I began to notice something else, too. The house wasn’t silent anymore. It never had been quiet, really, but now there was always a soft **whispering**. It wasn’t loud enough to make out words. But it was there, floating just beyond my hearing. If I sat still long enough, I could hear it — in the walls, in the floors, underneath the floorboards.

And then, one night, it changed.

I woke up to the sound of breathing.

It was soft, almost like a sigh, but **too close**. I turned, expecting to see the door ajar or a window cracked, but nothing. The room was still. The air, however, was thick, like it was holding its breath.

And that’s when I noticed it — the footprints **inside the room**. They weren’t on the floor, though. They were on the **ceiling.**

The marks were there, stretching across the plaster, as if someone had walked across the ceiling in the dark. And they were moving. Slowly.

I didn’t know what to do.

I tried to leave. I grabbed my things, shoved them into a bag. But when I went to the door, it wouldn’t open. The knob turned, but the door was **locked**.

From the inside.

And that’s when I heard it, clearer than ever before.

The whisper. But this time, it wasn’t far off.

It was **right behind me**.

I turned around, and I saw them.

There were three figures standing at the foot of the bed. I couldn’t make out their faces, but I could see their outlines — tall, thin, their bodies **too thin**, like they hadn’t been made to exist in the way humans are. Their shadows stretched across the room, twisting like the tips of dark branches.

They weren’t moving. But I could feel them. I could feel them in my chest, in my bones. They were waiting.

They never made a sound. No breathing. No footsteps. But I felt their eyes on me, felt their presence as if they were pulling the life from me, little by little.

And then they moved.

They moved in a way that shouldn’t have been possible. As if they weren’t walking, but sliding — gliding, like they were flowing along the walls, like they had no form, only **shadow**.

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t scream.

They didn’t need to touch me. They didn’t need to make a sound. They just… *took*. Took my name, took my voice, took my **memory**.

When I woke up again, it was daylight. The house was still. Quiet.

But the footprints were gone.

Everything was gone.

I left that house. I don’t know if it was real. I don’t know if it was a dream or something else. But I know this — I never told anyone about it. Not because I’m scared they won’t believe me. But because I **don’t want them to know.**

I’m afraid they’ll come for them too.

And maybe they already have.
