The house was a split-level ranch. The front lawn was fairly well maintained. The grass was cut, and the trees were groomed. Somewhat fresh white paint covered the exterior. For an abandoned house, it looked pretty good. The biggest issue seemed to be the roof; a large black tarp covered half of it. New shingles may have been a step too far for the neighbourhood HOA.

I looked over at my partner. “Hey, it looks like the HOA has been taking pretty good care of this place. Still, it'll probably cost more to repair than it’s worth.”

He hit me with that house-selling smile of his. “Honestly, it looks pretty good. I’m a bit worried about the interior though. There’s no chance the HOA has been doing anything more than they have to, to keep housing values up.”

As we got closer to the house it became obvious the paint was an obligation. It was bubbling and cracking over unstripped past layers, “Well, the land is half the value anyway.”

Jeff peeked in through the window beside the door. He grinned. “Hey this is pretty good too!”

I popped the key into the lock and tried to tug the door open. It didn’t budge. “I think they painted the door shut.”

Jeff’s smile faltered for a second. He fumbled in his pockets, “Yeah that tracks.” He pulled out a small utility knife and cut around the door frame.

He grabbed the handle and pulled as hard as he could. The door opened with a gasp of air, as though a vacuum seal had been broken. Jeff took a first step into the house, wincing as the stale air filled his nose. The old shag carpet crunched under his feet as he walked in. I followed closely behind him, plugging my nose as I crossed the threshold.

It felt as though we had passed into another world. The open air, just a few feet away, seemed impossibly far away. But like Jeff said, the interior looked pretty good. Everything was perfectly preserved, barring a layer of dust and cobwebs, as though we had stepped into a mummified version of the early 2000s. With all the furniture left behind, you could almost imagine someone living there.

I was the first to speak up, “Well, whoever lived here left in a hurry.”

Jeff had a nervous energy about him, but he spoke calmly, “Okay, I should have told you this before, and I don’t know a tonne about it, but someone died here. And, the owners after that claimed the house was haunted.”

“Are you serious? You’re supposed to tell me this stuff when you find out. How long ago did they die?”

He didn’t meet my eyes for a second, but gained confidence as he spoke, “28 years ago, which means that we’re in the clear unless the buyers ask!”

I turned my back on him and walked into the living room. "Okay," I replied, "well that’s another point for demolishing the house.” I crouched down to pick up a VHS tape off the floor. “We’ll get some movers in here to clear out all this stuff. I’ll bet there's someone out there who'd want it.”

The giant box TV behind me flickered to life, loud, angry static filling the dim room.

I spun my head to look at Jeff again, “Wait, is someone paying to power this house?”

Jeff looked as confused as I felt, “No … not that I know of?”

My head was starting to feel weird, like the static was messing with it. Without thinking I slid the VHS into the player.

The static disappeared, replaced by a high-pitched whine as the VHS started playing. The scene was two teenagers standing in the backyard of a green ranch style house. The brown haired boy spoke, his excited voice crackling through the ancient speaker system, “HEY MTV, me and my boy Ed are here for the MTV Best Home Stunts Contest!” The blonde boy, probably Ed continued, “We’re going to do something totally insane…” He clumsily pans the camera up to the roof of the house before continuing, “and drive a shopping cart off the frickin' roof, and into that pool!” He pantomimed diving, then panned to an empty swimming pool.

I turned to Jeff while the two boys rattled out the rules of the contest, “What the hell is this?”

His face was still in that same confused expression, “I don’t know, some MTV contest entry I guess … is the TV even plugged in?”

On the TV the blonde boy, Ed, repositioned the camera while the brown haired one jerkily pulled a shopping cart up a ladder and onto the roof. Ed stood in the basin of the pool looking up at the other boy, “Hey Alex, how are we going to get in the cart?” Alex seemed to take the comment as a challenge, “Like this!” He jumped into the basket of the cart. His movement jolted the cart making it rapidly roll down the roof. As it sped down, a number of shingles came with it. Hitting the lip of the roof, it flew off and smashed into the blonde boy below. 

“OH shit,” Jeff’s mouth was wide open.

A gush of red liquid pooled on the tile. Alex stood up shakily, then stared down at Ed. “Hey man are you okay?” Without checking any further he jerkily walked over to the camera and hit a crotch chop. In a wobbly voice he said, “Oh man, Ed just ate shit, let’s give that another try! Let me just catc…” His eyes rolled back in his head and he fell backwards into the pool with a sickening crack. 

I recoiled from the screen. “Holy shit! That’s what you meant? Oh my god, why do they still have that video? We need to go to the police or something!”

Jeff’s face was sweaty but unchanged. His eyes hadn’t moved from the TV, but his mouth opened further, “Nancy, I need you to move back please…”

I ran as fast as I could to the other side of the room to where Jeff was standing before looking back. The screen of the TV was warping and shifting, the static that was on the screen now filling the air with rainbow coloured static. A hand reached out of the screen as though emerging from water. Then a second, and then two more.

I didn’t stick around to see what came out of the TV. I ran to the door and fumbled with the handle. No matter what it wouldn’t open. “Hey Jeff, get the hell over here!” We slammed our bodies against the door, but it didn’t budge, we were stuck.

Jeff’s normally pristine face was a mask of fear, “Okay, okay, the door’s not working, the window, we’ll try the window!” We turned around, but in the living room, there were now two figures, lazily floating above the ground, the boys from the tape.

The brown haired one, Alex, dropped to the ground and took a step towards us, “Hey guys, did you like our video, totally sick right?” His grainy body jittered as he took another step forward, as though he had taken on the characteristics of the tape. “Look, I know we just met, but we need a little favour and then we can let you go!” The other boy floated over, “Yeah, we just need you to do one thing for us, and then you can go home.”

Jeff was speechless, his face was like a block of ice. 

I stuttered, “You … you want us to destroy the tape? Is it trapping you here?”

The boys looked horrified, Alex’s face morphed into something hideous for a split second, before he yelled, “WHAT THE HELL MAN, NO CHANCE!” Ed shrunk away from him, flickering slightly as he moved, “n-no, we just want you to send it to MTV.”

I was shocked, I looked over to Jeff for support, but he had sunken down onto the dusty carpet. I guess I was on my own. I stuttered, “I don’t think they really do that anymore, they’ll probably just throw out your tape…”

The two boys were devastated, the space around Alex became warped and glittery, like putting a magnet to a TV screen. His face distended and his limbs lengthened. The sickly pallor of his skin became even more pronounced as his mouth grew and stretched, smashing up and down as irregular teeth sprouted from his gums. His body cracked and twisted as he became something awful. His triple jointed arms skittering around on the floor as he pulled himself towards me. He opened his mouth to speak and a wave of deep red drool poured between his teeth. He screamed, “WE ARE GOING ON TV, YOU AREN’T STOPPING US!”

Ed seemed terrified, he retreated to behind a chair, peeking out at the horrifying scene in front of us. Alex’s monstrous arm slammed me against the peeling wallpaper, crushing my shoulder. My mouth filled with vomit and I felt my insides twist with fear.

From the floor Jeff weakly reached out and tried to grab Alex’s leg, although he couldn’t make contact.

The bile spilled from my mouth and my vision started to go black. From the other side of the room I could hear Ed yelling, “Please stop Alex, don’t do this again!” 

With what little energy I had I managed to squeak out, “Wait… I have a way to fix this!”

In an instant the pressure lifted. Alex was standing in front of me looking entirely normal. Well, as much as a ghost can. His hand was on his hip, he asked impatiently, “Well?”

I fell to the floor, and coughed out what remained of my breakfast. I coughed out my words as well, “The internet, it’s like a big TV channel. Everyone will be able to watch your video.”

Alex smiled, a wide unnatural smile. “Oh that’s sick, let’s do that!”

Ed floated back over, “How do we do that?”

I looked up at Alex, “We just need to take your video and put it on the computer okay? I won’t touch the VHS at all, you can just carry it or whatever you do. We just need something that can digitize it ... or I could record it with my phone maybe?”

Jeff groaned from the floor and curled into a ball. The three of us ignored him. Ed’s sunken yellow eyes lit up, “Hey wait, I think the new people had something like that in their office upstairs! It can put VHS tapes on the computer, and I think they had the internet too!”

“It might be easier if we use my pho—,” I replied.

Alex cut me off, “We’ll do Ed’s idea.” He floated over to the TV,  the video was still running, just a still shot of the two boys’ corpses lying in the pool. The VHS materialized in his hands. “Maybe we can edit out the part where we’re lying in the pool. It’s pretty boring.”

The three of us headed up the creaky stairs to the home office, my arm shot with pain on each step. Alex led me to the room while Ed trailed behind. I hazarded a glimpse back at Jeff who seemed to be coming out of his breakdown.

Like the rest of the house, the office was pristine. I took note of the surprising lack of water damage, it must not have been under the tarp covered section of the roof.

The computer was ancient, probably 20 years old. I looked over to Ed. "You think it'll work? It’s pretty old."

Ed replied, “I don’t know man. The TV works.”

My shoulder shot with pain as I navigated the unfamiliar retro desktop. Pushing it aside, I clicked through the twenty or so errors that popped up on screen. I didn’t want to set Alex off, but I wasn't sure the tape would survive the conversion. I pressed import.

He was already getting antsy. The generally unnoticeable background static had gotten louder. I quickly opened the Internet Explorer application and was greeted by a bald man standing beside a search bar. I quickly typed YouTube into the search bar. Five minutes until upload complete.

“Okay, damn, that’s actually amazing upload speed."

Ed hugged Alex, knocking them both into the air, “WE DID IT!”

Alex matched his friends excitement, screaming into the air, “HELL YEAH!” 

The atmosphere in the room became fuzzy, the air felt thick.

A sudden thumping sound came from the hallway, Jeff slowly stumbled up to the door frame. He was soaked with sweat, seemingly extremely nervous but now somewhat functional, “uhhh … hey Nance … are you okay?”

Alex’s energy turned dark, he cast his eyes towards the door, the entirety of his emotions focused on Jeff. "You're not selling this house, you get that, right?"

He backed away from the door slightly. “Yeah … I know"

\-UPLOAD FINISHED-

I turned back towards them, "Okay boys looks like we're done. You can let us go now..."

The two boys were flickering rapidly. Alex’s expression changed from excitement to anger, “What did YOU DO!?” 

I scrambled back in my chair but his arm extended towards me through the air, cracking, warping, and growing. His monstrous hand grabbed my throat, constricting around my windpipe.

Barely able to breathe, I clawed at the massive hand, trying to get a taste of oxygen.

And then without warning they were gone, imploded into a single blip of light.

“What the hell?”

I looked back at the computer.

The power suddenly went out.

Jeff ran across the room, “OH MY GOD, Nance, are you okay?"

I muttered, “We’re demolishing this house.”
