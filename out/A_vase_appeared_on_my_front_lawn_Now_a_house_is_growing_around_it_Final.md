The weekend has come, and I haven’t left my house since that evening.  I’ve spent most nights awake, daring from time to time to peer out my bedroom window.  The house is almost complete now.  The beige walls have begun to grow a roof; it extends each hour, just barely covering the top of the house.  It will be fully grown soon.  Windows started popping out of the walls, the dark interior staring at me day and night—the rain.  The rain hasn’t stopped; it escalates the house's evolution with each passing hour.  Inch by inch, the home develops.  The front door now has a little stone path leading towards my house.  I see it has a doormat too, although I can’t read it from here.  

Thoughts of burning it down had crossed my mind.  But this damn rain is only getting heavier.  The forecast never even mentioned a sprinkle, let alone this downpour.  All I can do for now is try and rest, forget about the house for a while.  But those pictures.  They won’t leave my mind.  Those frames are fixated to my thoughts.  Like a spiraling fever dream, they spin through my head.  Their faceless, waving presence greets me every time I close my eyes.  

The wind is picking up again.  My windows rattled, drawing my attention.  The roof is finished.   Curtains appeared in the windows.  I stared at them for a moment, cold sweat beading all over me.  The blackness inside that house pulled me, lured me, and I couldn’t turn away.  Until the curtains were sharply drawn closed.  

I think I sprained something as I sprang, falling backwards away from my window.  A coldness enveloped me as I tried to rationalize that I didn’t see what I saw.  The rain was obscuring my vision after all, and the wind may have blown through that house and rattled those curtains closed.  I curled up on the floor, that returning fear surging through me.  I crawled to my window, begging for an assurance that the terror for what I knew was to come was false.  Limply, I raised my head and peered outside.  That house, in its pristine glory, sat in the rain, silent.  With dry, quivering eyes, I looked at those front windows, curtains still as stone.  A light flickered on inside, showing through the sliver of breakage between the fabric. 

My throat closed, my head burned with the desire to run screaming out into the woods.  But I couldn’t look away.  Rain pelting the earth, I sat frozen, squatting at my window.  My vision began to blur, and my breath would not come.  That house, looming over me, radiated that horrid light through the night.  And all I could do was sit and watch.  Until I saw it.  A shadow, brushed by the curtains.  

Next thing I knew, I was choking back tears as I pulled away, dragging my dresser to barricade my window.  I couldn’t take it anymore, I ran to my front door, locking it, before shakily sitting on the floor.  I pulled out my phone and began to dial 911.  I needed someone, anyone, to come out here.  As I held the phone up to my ear, I dared a glance out my kitchen window.  The operator answered, but I couldn’t speak.  My eyes bulged, and my stomach erupted in a burning spring of panic.  The front door of the house across my lawn was opening.  

I’ve been locked in my closet ever since.  My phone cut out before the operator had a chance to determine if this was a buttdial or an emergency.  Even if the police are coming, it’ll be too late.  The neighbors have been knocking at my door for several hours now.  My mind is in a weird state of exhausted calm… but the knocking is only getting louder.  I think my door just caved in.  Time to meet the neighbors.
