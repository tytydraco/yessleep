I have tried everything I can think of to remove the handprint. Windex, clorox, fucking goo gone. That greasy stain won't leave. I have scrubbed at it for days, and all it does is smudge.

My husband thinks I have lost my mind. Since he found me crying in the bathtub at 6 am that horrible morning, he won't look at me the same way. He's fully convinced I'm sleep deprived. Funny isn't it? His first thought was that I had a nightmare. Now he's convinced I'm not sleeping enough.

He's right though, on both accounts. I can't sleep well anymore. When awake, I am haunted by the creature that stalks my property. When I sleep, I am haunted by my dreams.

I have been dreaming that I am stuck in the mud. I am deep in the ground somewhere no one can hear me. I rake my nails into the wet dirt  and try to claw my way to freedom, but I never seem to reach the surface. Am I even going in the right direction? Or am I digging myself further down? As I scream, my voice begins to thicken and gurgle. The wet mud chokes me until I wake up.

When I do wake up. I am almost never where I fell asleep. Most times I find myself laying on the couch in the living room, with the curtains wide open. I am afraid that if I pass out in the tub, I will wake up downstairs when that thing is back outside.

My dog isn't acting like herself either. She hates going outside alone. She wont go on walks anymore. She follows me so closely throughout the house I can't tell if she is afraid for herself or for me.

Every night we go into the bathtub to sit while Jake is away at work. Every night we hear the banging, the dragging. The voice that mimics mine over and over. We hear the meows that are not coming from a real cat. Every night she is with me while this thing tortures us.

During the day, we hear heavy creaking coming from beneath the floorboards. Jake says the house is old and shifting, but it sounds heavier than that. It sounds like dragging. And Bella shakes like a leaf every time it starts up again.

I don't understand how my neighbors haven't heard it at night. I guess it's possible they live too far from our house, we have big properties out here in the country. But I swear, when that banging and yelling starts, I feel like people a state over should be able to hear it. 


There's been a tropical storm that's outer reaches have affected Ohio, and two nights ago the weather was terrible. Wind ripped through the state uprooting trees and destroying houses. Our town was spared save for heavy rains and crackling thunder all night long.

That night, I could hear the gurgling voice calling out to me in the rain.

“Gooo awaaaaaay”

When Jake got home, he asked me what the hell had tracked mud all up and down our porch. I didn't bother to answer him because I knew he wouldn't believe me.

I was right. He decided it was “those damn cats”. But the cats haven't come by our house in over a week. I stopped filling the food bowls.

Then this morning, I found a hole on the side of my house. It is dug deep and wide, and seems to tunnel all the way underneath the foundation. It's kind of huge.
Big enough to fit a person, or something pretending to be one. 

I think I know what's causing the sounds beneath my house. I think I know where that disgusting wet thing climbs up from in the night to torment me, and I think I know why I have been having dreams of being lost beneath the ground in deep wet mud.

It's 11:36pm as I write this from my bathroom. I am afraid to go to sleep. And I am afraid to stay awake.
