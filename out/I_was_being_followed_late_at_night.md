Hello, name's Mike.
To start, to contextualize why ,and how I got in this whole mess. I take trips cross country, now and then. Started with my family, and after I moved out, I kept with it, typically two to five day ventures, and on those trips, I rest at a motel. Also, and should mention, I'm quite the night owl, some times not sleeping till 6,AM,
So I developed a hobby of taking nightly walks around the motels, even miles from them, it was always peaceful time for me. Obviously, I understand the typical concern, but I'm usually not worried.
Currently standing at 6.2 feet, and don't carry any valuables worth stealing, only my phone I got costing 25 at Walmart.
I don't walk in alleyways, only stick to main roads, and this night wasn't an exception.

The night in question. 
It was roughly the quarter waypoint from a party at Vegas that my friends held, and of course I was driving back alone, I didn't mind. I stopped at a pretty desolet motel, it wasn't exactly in the middle of nowhere, but the nearest gas station was two miles, but surprisingly in some decent business, I had to check in at a line with about 6 people. I got my key, I remember opening the room up, seeing the muted gray carpet, the yellowish White walls, and in comidic contrast, a 20 inch flat screen, and the distracting smell of cigarettes, I didn't care to complain, I was only here for the night. After 10.PM, I took my walk. I was amazed looking at the parking lot, saw my car, and one other. I thought people where checking in, guess not.

Unreasonably dark and quiet, is how I would describe that night.
The long stretch of highway in the desert, only visible by the two rows of street lamps parallel to it. It seems to be a new moon, so the only way to separate the pitch black sky from the ground, was stars. For the time I was out there, I didn't see any car, but after a while, I did see something. For some reason, I was compelled to look behind me, there was, probably 200 feet away, a silhouette of a person, contrast from the orangy brown ground. At the time, this wasn't scary exactly, before, seeing people behind me usually ment, they were passing by, the major difference is, that would typically happen in streets, closer to suburbanian areas, I was a little nervous, and that nervous escalated a bit, when I decided to look behind again, and saw that they were closer.

I walked quite a lot that night, I look back perpetually, every time, little by little, they were coming closer. I had an idea, stop and let them pass, if they got close, eye them up and probably scare them off, I walk off couple feet from road, face pirpendicular to it, then stand in the dark. Looking over, and  I see them in the same spot, I waited and they just didn't move. I tried to look at the time, but my phone wouldn't turn on, now I didn't charge it befor I walked, but it shouldn't be dead, it was 58%. I didn't know what to do, I couldn't wait here all night, but I had made a plane B. Down the road was a gas station, I should get there, and maybe call a taxi, or the cops. I had decided to walk fast, after a bit, I look back again, they were much closer then expected, I got spooked and decided to run, but after a while instead of farther they even closer. Every time I moved faster it moved faster, and instead of 80 feet away, now it was more like 30 feet. I stand still, look back, and could see them better but just barely, I could tell they had pale skin, but the clothes were hard to make out, anlong with the body. He, I presume, was almost warped looking, the proportion of his arms and legs, and his posture look crooked, and the seems of his clothes, you could see them but the were in the wrong places, he had what I think was a hat, blob shaped and a rim so small you could barely notice, it was unpleasant to even process what I was looking at.

I walked slowly to the gas station, this time.
It was tedious, and aggravating, It didn't feel like two miles it felt like five, I should be able to see the gas station at this point but I couldn't. I thought about how, I should turn around and yell at him, demand him to leave, but every time, I try bring up the thought, my brain refuses the option. I try to listen to his footsteps but I only hear mine, no other noise, not animals not wind, nothing, besides the hum of the street lamps, infact, I didn't even see him move his legs to walk. Finally I had a plan C, a plan that, for the most part, would work, I would move to the left side of the street and go back to the motel. In an instant I brake for it, run across the road. On the left side I look back to where he was, and he was gone. A part of me already new the truth, but I didn't have the heart confirm it.

I walked back, for what felt like countless hours, and I see it, the motel. 
I did it finally, I look back behind me. He was there, I was in a state of depression, I was at the gate, I needed to cross it, slowly, and weakly, moving to the motel lobby, I remember the relief, closing the door, looking through the glass, and not seeing him. And also seeing another human after so long. an elderly woman was working at the desk. Told her the story of a guy following me, on the road, and well, she didn't respond, she didn't say a word, didn't even change her facial expression. I demand her to call the cops, there's a guy following me, yet nothing, she just kept looking at me, with that unchanging expression. After a while of getting no where, so I told her I'm going back to my room.

The path to my room was filled with paranoia, looking around just to know where he was, if I'm safe. 
I opened the door, and scan the room for my stuff, then went for my car keys. I had a new plane, drop room keys, and drive away, but that plan had been scrapped fast, because when I decided to look over at my car, he was standing next to. I slammed, and locked the door, closed the current, I was sitting on the motel's bed, heart beating out of my chest, just wishing it could be over. 
It was strange, I never had the thought of hitting it, and luckily, or un luckily, I never got to know what would happen if I did.

I don't know how, I don't remember when, but I had fallen asleep on that bed, the somber feeling of sleep was broken abruptly, in the room, it was dark but there was a light that could be seen coming from out side, it shind through the open door way, above was him looking down at me. His pale rubbery skin which lack facial hair, the distorted black clothes, and a pin on his chest of two diamonds intersecting, the muted blonde hair that seem to form his ears, his mouth looked like it was a horizontal cut through his face, two puncture holes for a nose, the eyes were perfectly circular with there pure black irises, staring at me. Foggy headed, I ran to the bathroom, locking the door. Turning the bathroom lights on, the glaring lights hit my eyes hurting them. And after minutes of waiting, I made the worst choice, I get on on my hands and knees move my head to ground, and I look underneath the door and he was there looking back at me, in his irises, I saw what looked like metal tubing that led to a dark void. I jumped back in shock, slamming my head on on motel toilet. Sitting there, waiting till he left, that was the last thing I remember of that night.

I woke up in the motel bed again, it was day time.
I checked my phone it said it was 9.AM and at 52%, my stuff was at the places I left them at, decided to look out the window, and the parking lot was full of cars. Was it really just that. but before I could relax, I noticed the bathroom door was open, I never opened it before I left on the walk. After I left the motel, and came back home, I would tell family friends the story, and I don't blame them for not believing me, after a while even I stopped believing it. It took me two months to get back to nightly walking, I don't ever take it alone though, only walk in crowded areas now, every thing was going back to normal, but one day on trip, a couple of months ago, one of my friends pointed out, when we were out on a beach, a scar on the back of my neck.

It was two diamonds intersecting.
