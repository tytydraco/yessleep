As me and the little girl waited for the first bus out of town, I went back and forth over whether to phone the police again. I felt helpless and had no idea what to do. What were Ryan’s family going to think? If I told them, would they also think I’d got crazy and then put me away. I decided my best option was to make up a semi truthful story.

“Hey, just thought I’d tell you that Ryan left with this guy in a fancy suit and a woman in a red dress.” I phoned Ryan’s mum, Jean. Lying to her felt like chewing sandpaper. Jean was a lovely woman and didn’t deserve this.

“Oh. Okay.” Jean replied, sounding very confused on the other side of the phone.

“I’ll tell him to phone you.” I lied again.

“Alright. Thanks Chris.”

“No prob-” She hung up before I could finish my sentence.

The bus arrived soon after and the girl and I climbed onboard. We took two seats right at the back. As the bus rumbled down and the road away from the caves I stared out of the window and chewed my fingernails. What to do, what to do, the question bounced around in my mind.

“Is your name Callum?” The girl in the deft tones t-shirt, that had saved my life, asked.

“Chris.” I corrected her.

“Oh yeah.” She nodded as if remembering. “Personally, I’m in between names right now.”

“Cool.”

“Yeah I’m torn between Raven and like Cordelia or something. Or something gender neutral and gothic like…I don’t know…Jasper. Yeah actually you can call me Jasper.” She nodded decidedly.

I resisted the urge to laugh at her name choices. “Cool.”

She began playing with a strand of her mousey hair, clearly having trouble staying still. “I think I’m gonna dye my hair like yours. Black. But I want purple streaks and red tips.”

“Uh huh.”

“Where did you get that fish net shirt thingy?” She asked, gesturing to my top.

“I made it.”

“What?! Cool. How?”

“I cut a head-sized hole in the crotch of a pair of fishnets.”

“Ingenious.”

“It’s an old goth trick.” I gave her a half smile.

“Nice. So what’s the plan for tracking down the vampires?”

“Huh?”

“Well they have your friend? Are you gonna go looking for him?”

“I-I don’t know.”

“Well I think you should.” She began rummaging around in her pocket. “I found something you might find interesting. I was going through peoples bags and a lot of them had these.” She showed me a stack of business cards. I snatched them off of her and looked at the  cards in disbelief.

Green stems. White berries.

“Looks like mistletoe. I went through a phase of trying to memorise every British plant in a field guide so I know a fair amount about plants. I gave up when I got to the fungi section because so many of them look the same.”

“Uh huh.”

“Mhm.”

“Hold on. You were going through peoples bags?”

“Yeah. I wasn’t stealing.”

“This counts as stealing.” I said lifting up the cards.

She shrugged. “I have another theory too.”

“Changing the subject but go on.”

“The stamps. I was thinking about cats and why Ryan was one of the very few people I saw with a cat stamp. Everyone else had pentagrams. Or nothing at all. So I started thinking, what is a cat? Well, what are cats?” She looked at me expecting an answer.

“Animals?”

“Yes. But not the answer I’m looking for.” She laced her fingers together as if to imitate a wise old professor.

“Friends?”

“Yes. Companions. What’s Ryan to you? A companion.”

“Then why didn’t I get a cat stamp? I’m also his companion.”

“I don’t know I’m not a vampire.” She shrugged, throwing her hands up.

“Stop saying that word.”

“Why? Is it offensive to blood suckers?”

“No. Because…well it seems silly.”

She rolled her eyes at me. “You’re going to have to learn to put your adultness aside and think a bit bigger. Wasn’t all that long ago since you were my age.”

“A whole decade.”

“Yeah. That’s not that long really.”

“Uh huh.”

The girl, whose name for the foreseeable future is Jasper, yapped for the entire journey home. I didn’t complain or tell her to stop. I got the impression she didn’t get the chance to talk much about her interests.

I would’ve been engaging with her were I not turning Ryan’s fate over in my head like a two sided coin. I had no idea where he was. He could be dead. Anything could’ve been happening to him, and I was running away and leaving him to the mercy of Logan and Maisie’s murderers.

Fearing for her safety, I walked Jasper home from the bus stop. She lived in a big tower block on an estate not too far from me. Mill Towers wasn’t a nice place at all to live. I felt bad for her as I dropped her off. That isn’t to say I wasn’t relieved to have a moment of silence on my walk back home.

Without Ryan, I wasn’t sure what to do. Ever since we were kids, he was the one with the solutions. He was the smart one. He had the ideas. I was just a bad influence that encouraged his silly ideas, then got the blame for them. Like the time he thought it would be funny to send the weird maths teacher a fathers day card “From Anon” and a fake positive pregnancy test. Somehow I ended up taking the blame for that one.

Aside from him all my other friends had moved away to go to university, and stayed in their new city. I didn’t blame them, I didn’t want to be here either. But I felt so painfully alone it made my chest hurt.

When I came in, it was still early enough that my Mum was up watching late night TV.

“Have a good time love?” She asked from the sofa.

“It was alright.”

“Did Ryan have fun?”

“Yeah.” I forced myself to say. “I’m gonna have a bath and go to bed.”

“Okay sweetie.”

Tiredly, I dragged myself up the stairs and took an excessively long bath. I only got out when my sister started banging on the door asking to pee. Being hurried along by her incessant banging I pulled on my pyjamas and let her in.

“Move! I’m busting!” She barged past me and slammed the door. I laughed then made my way into my room. “You’ve been in here for like an hour!” She yelled from behind the door.

There was a light breeze blowing my bedroom curtains back and forth. My window was open, as usual, because my mother is very passionate about fresh air. I sat down on my bed and stared out of the window at the road. I watched the cars pass and the occasional bus. My eyes were drawn to an alley way, shrouded with shadows. It wasn’t unusual to see some pretty dodgy activities going down there and it made for good entertainment, so I peered into the alleyway's darkness. What I saw didn’t entertain me.

In the inky dark of the alleyway, I saw a pair of eyes. They were situated on a barely lit face, staring directly up at me. Our eyes met for a second. Terrified, I ripped my gaze away from the eyes and ducked under the window sill. My heart pounding, I gave it a little while before I looked over the top of the window sill a second time. I gripped the window sill and pulled myself upward, my eyes just peering over it. There was another figure, with its own set of bright eyes, crouched on the roof across the street. It was looking at me too. Everywhere I looked I spotted figures, staring. Lurking, in the tree in my neighbours garden. Peering from behind the bus stop. Staring at me over the top of garden fences and from under parked cars. The figures stayed perfectly still, the eyes not blinking. I thought I was hallucinating. Maybe the police were right and grief had sent me crazy. I felt panic start to crawl across my body and up my spine, making me dizzy and afraid.

“Chris.” I heard my little brother Oscar whimper from his bed behind me. I turned away from the window to look at him. “What’s that?” He asked, his little voice shaking, pointing his finger to the window. Suddenly, his eyes went as wide as dinner plates and he screamed, legs frantically kicking and throwing off his blanket.

A pair of pale taloned hands were behind the glass. I yelped at the sight of them. Despite my terror I couldn’t move or drag my gaze away from the window. Slowly, they began to descend, arms stretching naturally long. The fingers quivered and moved back and forth like worms in dirt and tapped loudly against the window pane. Something began to hiss, the sound coming from above us on the roof. The sound bounced around the room and my skull and felt like electricity buzzing and vibrating through my nervous system, making me shake.

A face dropped down. The hands smacked against the window. The face’s unnaturally long teeth were curled into a hungry snarl as it hissed at us.

The light came on. The face popped out of view. As did all the eyes. My brother and I were left in a paralysed state of fear. He kept screaming. I kept staring.

“What?! What is it?” My mum asked, snapping me out of my hypnotic fear.

“The monster!” My little brother screamed.

“Chris? What’s he talking about?” She asked as she wrapped her arms protectively around my little brother.

“I- There was- Mum I swear we saw something.” I tried to explain.

She looked at me angrily as she picked up my little brother and held him in her arms. He sobbed and mumbled incoherently. She opened her mouth, presumably to have a go at me when my other brother, who’s a bit younger than Samantha, appeared behind her.

“Mum.” Josh tugged at her night gown, concerned.

“What sweetie?”

“Sam’s not in her bed.”

“She’s probably gone downstairs to get a drink or something.” She dismissed him, turning back to me.

Angrily, she began chewing me out about freaking out my little brother. I didn’t pay attention, I was busy watching Josh walk downstairs. His bare feet padded down the carpeted stairs as he went in search of our sister. He was down there for a few seconds, checking the front room and the kitchen. Then he walked back upstairs.

“She’s not there mum.”

“Then she’s probably in the toilet!” She snapped.

“No one’s in the toilet.” He said pushing the door open, matching her tone.

Mum groaned. “Sam!” She yelled. The four of us stood in the hallway listening to the eerie quiet of the house. The pipes squeaked and floorboards creaked under our feet, but Sam didn’t respond.

“Sam.” My mum repeated unsurely as she began searching the house.

Helplessly, I watched her throw Sam’s blankets around as if she was hiding under them. She threw open wardrobe doors and ran up and down the stairs of our small house. Soon her yelling became panicked.

I picked up Oscar and held Josh’s hand terrified to let either of them go. Josh didn’t snatch his hand away like he usually did. My siblings are little but they aren’t stupid and they know when something isn’t right. Especially Oscar, who saw the face of the vampire with me.

The three of us watched our Mum have a justified breakdown on the phone to the police. As she gave them our address, I felt Josh tug at my sleeve.

“I think I saw something on Sam’s bed.” He whispered to me. Curiously, I followed him to his and Sam’s bedroom.  “When mum threw the duvet off, I saw something shiny fly through the air.” He got to his knees and began looking around on the floor. With a proud smile he picked up something metallic and shiny from the carpet. Gently, he placed the cold silver object in my hand.

If it hadn’t been such a malevolent omen it might have been beautiful. But I looked upon the piece of jewellery with a hatred so hot I thought the heat of my gaze might melt the metal. But it stayed infuriatingly solid and unbreakable in my hand. It was an ornate silver pendant in the shape of mistletoe, with [white pearls as the berries](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1my5ep1/something_took_my_cousins_dead_body_from_under/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
