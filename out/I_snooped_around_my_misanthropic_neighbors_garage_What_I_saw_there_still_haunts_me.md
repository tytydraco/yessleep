Jebediah Jones was a mean old man. He lived by himself in a rusty trailer, nothing for company save for two massive rottweilers. They were vicious curs, once they tore to pieces a 14-year-old boy who was foolish enough to jump the old man’s fence at night. Jebediah stuck the kid’s mutilated head onto a stake outside his front gate. As far as I knew, that was the last time anyone dared venture onto his land. 

  
Every morning, Jebediah would patrol the barbed-wire fence that surrounded his 5-acre property, a sawed-off shotgun in his right hand, his dogs by his feet. Although he was my neighbor, I don’t think he ever spoke to me. On the few occasions our paths crossed, he would snarl and growl like a rabid beast. I did my best to avoid him. 

  
He left his place about once a week, always early in the morning. From my bedroom window, I could see him carry steel barrels from a detached garage to the bed of his pickup. He would return at dusk and unload the barrels back into the garage. 

  
There were lots of rumors about him around town. Most thought that he cooked meth, but I thought something more sinister was going on in that garage. Some townsfolk said that they often saw Jebediah’s truck headed for the farm of his brother, the town’s former police chief. What he did there, no one had a clue. 

  
One snowy January morning in ’96, I was awoken to mournful wailing from the rottweilers. From my window, I saw Jebediah’s pickup wrapped around an old oak tree just outside his gate. I called an ambulance and they took the old man away. He looked to be dead—he wasn’t moving and his clothes were soaked in blood. Animal control came and removed his dogs, how they managed to corral them I will never know. 

  
Foolishly, I decided to investigate what was going on with the old man. I walked through the open gate and made my way to his garage. There was an odor coming from it, but it wasn’t the chemical scent that you associate with meth labs (living in rural Appalachia, I sadly knew the telltale smell). Inexplicably, it smelled like roses.   


  
I circled the building. It was wooden, the white paint flaking off, about 40 feet wide by 20 feet long, large enough to store several cars (curiously, no matter the weather, Jebediah always parked his pickup outside). I was hoping that there would be a window I could peek through, but all of them had been boarded up. 

  
I made my way to a side door and turned the knob. To my surprise, it was unlocked. It opened to a narrow corridor, about two feet wide. A single dim lightbulb was already on, dangling from the ceiling on a long string.

  
There were two pairs of muddy boots and stacks of old Times and National Geographic magazines by the door. Model Spitfires and P-51 Mustangs hung from the ceiling. As I made my way down the corridor, I passed several empty bags of fertilizer and red 5-gallon gas cans, warnings reading ‘Danger’ and ‘Extremely Flammable’ stamped on their sides. About halfway down, I nearly tripped on a plastic doll’s head. 

  
Near the end of the corridor, there was a long wooden workbench. In addition to the dozens of tools scattered about it haphazardly, there was an old transistor radio; a microwave with a broken window; a tiny, spiny plant in a 1-gallon container (somehow living in the dark); a 15-pound dumbbell, the metal rusting; several empty paint cans; six dismantled smoke detectors; an acoustic guitar, three of its strings broken; a coffee grinder; three digital alarm clocks, their displays flashing 12:00 in sync; and an unopened bag of Epsom salt.  


  
Above the bench were several metal shelves. On some were prescription medicines in yellowing containers, several decades past their expiration dates. Others had vials of liquids in various colors. One shelf contained several large tomes. There were books on anatomy, chemistry, aeronautical engineering, electromagnetism, and zoology. There was even one on nuclear physics. I wondered if Jebediah was a bomb maker. And not just a builder of conventional explosives. *Was he trying to build a nuclear bomb in his garage?* I told myself that it was a crazy idea, but somehow I couldn’t shake that thought. 

  
I turned the corner. This section of the garage was larger, probably about eight feet wide. In the middle of it was an old Chrysler, painted a gaudy shade of gold, propped up on cinderblocks, its windshield missing. In the passenger seat sat a mannequin, a bright-red smiley face painted on it.   


  
There were about fifteen candles surrounding the car. At first, I thought they were flameless, powered by batteries, but as I got closer I realized they were real. Before the end of the day, they would burn up and the garage’s dry wood would catch fire. This was apparently Jebediah’s insurance policy—if he didn’t get back in time, the garage would burn to the ground, destroying the evidence of whatever he was working on. 

  
I quickly snuffed the candles out and continued making my way through the garage. At the end of this section, there was another set of shelves. On it were several glass jars, containing specimens floating in formaldehyde. There were frogs, rats, spiders, little snakes, a baby alligator, and, in one, what looked like a human fetus. It was disintegrating, tiny bits of flesh floating in the murky liquid. 

  
I kept walking, curious to see what other secrets this garage held. Halfway down the next corridor was a metal storage locker. I opened it, expecting to find some tools or possibly more chemicals, but nearly fainted when I saw what was inside. 

  
There was a headless body—presumably the boy who had been torn apart by Jebediah’s dogs. The flesh had mummified, and on his torso the old man had made a face. He had stuck two glass alligator eyes—with black slit pupils and olive irises crisscrossed by dark brown veins—into his desiccated skin. A grinning maw had been carved into the poor boy’s stomach, which Jebediah had decorated with hundreds of razor-sharp shark teeth. For his nose, he had used a carrot. It was almost humorous seeing that, so incongruous, like he was making a jolly snowman. The carrot was still ripe, he must have replaced it regularly. I knew the man was batshit crazy, but I didn’t expect to see something like this. 

  
I considered going back but my curiosity was too strong and I continued down the corridor, walking towards a dim light at its end.

  
It was coming from an oil lamp on another workbench. On it was a microscope, an opened bottle of nitric acid, a bung wrench, two scalpels, some needle and thread, the skull of a gigantic ape, a can of corned beef, and an old leather-bound book that was falling apart. Tacked on the wall above it was a sepia photograph of a naked woman and an old calendar from 1943. To the right of the workbench was a 55-gallon steel barrel.   


  
I opened up the book, hoping to find a clue to whatever Jebediah was doing. If I had to guess, I would say it was written in Latin, but I can’t say for sure. As I was trying to decipher it, I heard some banging come from the barrel.   


  
I wondered if Jebediah had caught a possum or something and stuck it in there. Using the bung wrench, I opened the plug and peered inside. Floating in luminescent blue liquid was a monster, maybe two feet long. It looked like someone had sewn the head and torso of a small monkey to a fish’s tail. Somehow, it was alive, swimming languidly. When I was replacing the plug, trying to get that horrid sight out of my mind, I heard loud breathing from behind me. 

  
Jebediah was standing a foot behind me, grinning from ear to ear. In his right hand was a 2x4, rusty nails jutting out of it. His clothes were soaked in blood and his face was covered in lacerations. Even if he somehow survived the crash, there was no way a hospital would release him in this condition.   


  
*This is impossible*, I thought. *He’s dead, I’m just imagining him.*   


  
Then I noticed his feet. They were floating an inch or so above the ground. I was right, he was dead, but that realization did not come as a relief. I could handle an old man, but I didn’t think I could defeat a ghost. My heart pounding, I threw the bottle of nitric acid in his face. The old man’s flesh dissolved, but he did not cry out in pain. In fact, he seemed to be smiling. 

  
He swung the 2x4 at my head. I ducked just in time and the piece of wood collided with the oil lamp, sending it shattering to the ground. I started running deeper into the garage. I thought that Jebediah would chase me, but his skull just seemed to watch me, a deranged grin etched into it. 

  
I soon became engulfed in complete blackness, couldn’t even see my hand when it was an inch from my face. I reached out, trying to find the walls, but they had vanished. I wondered if I were dead, if this were Hell, an infinite plane of nothing. 

  
Not knowing what else to do, I just kept running, praying that I would find some escape. I ran for what seemed like hours but was still engulfed in blackness. Then, far off into the distance, I saw a pale yellow light. 

  
I sprinted towards it. As I neared it, I could smell smoke but couldn’t see any flames. Suddenly, two headlights materialized far behind me. Coming up on me was the gold Chrysler I had seen earlier. Jebediah’s skeleton was in the driver’s seat. Riding shotgun was the mummy whose face grew beneath his shoulders, his mouth chomping up and down like a deranged Pac-Man.  


  
As I continued sprinting towards the light, my lungs filled with smoke and I started coughing. Still, I did not see any flames, just the pale light. The sounds of the Chrysler’s engine and the chomp chomp of the mummy’s mouth were getting louder, but I did not risk a glance back, for I knew that would slow me down. 

  
When I was almost at the light, I finally looked behind me. The Chrysler was less than ten feet from me, the skull of Jebediah grinning maniacally. I made one last push for the light, praying that it would lead me to safety. My lungs were burning, my legs rubbery, but I somehow kept moving. When I was nearly at the light, a golden orb hovering four feet off the ground, the Chrysler’s bumper struck my leg. As I fell forward, I reached out for the orb, just touching it with my outstretched fingers. 

  
I landed face down into the snow. As I was lying there, I heard several loud explosions. I quickly scrambled to my feet—my legs were sore but miraculously not broken—and looked around. The garage, only a few feet away from me, was engulfed in flames. As I hurried back to my house, I saw a bright orange carrot sticking up out of the snow.
