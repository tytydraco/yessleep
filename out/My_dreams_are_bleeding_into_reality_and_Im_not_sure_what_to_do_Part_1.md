Have you ever had a dream so real and meaningful, only to forget it all as soon as you open your eyes? Something so tangible and clear, but at the same time blurry and flowing like a water-colored canvas.

For the past week or so, I’ve been having hyper-realistic dreams. To be completely honest, I’m not exactly sure when I’m dreaming or when I’m awake anymore. However, I suppose I should stop rambling and start with what happened last night.

I had just finished my nightly routine, making one last pit stop to go to the bathroom and change into my pajamas. As I finally flicked off the light in my room, I realized I had forgotten something.

“Gus! Come here, boy!” I shouted out the door (a little too baby-like for my age).

In a matter of seconds, the pitter-patter of four small legs grew faintly through the strikingly dark room. I patted my bed, signaling him to jump up.

“That’s a good boy!” I rubbed his belly and probably spouted some inhumane babble while patting him.

I’ve lived alone for two years now. Since my wife is gone, I decided I needed something to keep me company, especially with a house all to myself.  So, a few months ago I found my best friend. I still remember picking him up from a local ranch about two hours away. He was the runt of the litter, a hyperactive chocolate lab. I think I needed a little hyperactivity in my life.

I usually would never let a pet sleep on the bed with me, but I wanted to keep my sweetheart’s spot in the bed warm, for when she hopefully comes back.

“Ok buddy, let’s go to sleep, shall we?” I said, stretching and sinking into my frigid pillow. I know he can’t actually respond, but it feels nice to imagine that somehow he does.

I finally shut my eyes and tried to sleep.  The room was almost pitch black, with a slice of pure, silver moonlight peeking through my blackout curtains. In Wyoming, nighttime is like being in a completely different world. A beauty unexplainable until it’s seen with the human eye- uncapturable.

My appreciation for my home was interrupted by a high-pitched ringing. It wasn’t harsh like you’d imagine in your head. It was almost like a siren’s call, drawing weary sailors nearer and nearer until it’s too late. I am no better than a weary sailor, victim to an ocean pulling me every which way on a whim. And so, I followed this ringing.

Where the windows on my wall once were, were now blank drywall. Although I was still in what I thought was my room, it felt like I was somewhere I wasn’t supposed to be. With every step I took out my door and down the hall, it felt as if I were floating- moving fast, all while stepping at a perfect pace. I kept toward the ringing until it stopped, instantaneously.

I don’t remember it too well after that, to be completely honest. From then on, what I do remember is the dark. This wasn’t just the normal dark you get when you turn off the light switch in your kitchen. This was a familiar dark—almost like it had a personality, something nostalgic washing over my whole body. Or was it even my body?

A raw voice called to me from the end of the hallway, just out of what my eyes could perceive.

“Such beauty can only be seen in death,” it beckoned me.

“Where am I? This isn’t my home, is it?” I replied, strangely quick and without thought.

“Hmph. You are nowhere.” The voice slithered away to somewhere I cannot fully describe. I did not feel warm, nor cold, but rather, I just was.

And then I jolted awake.

Gus grunted at me, probably not too happy with me waking him. The warm moonlight was still melting through my window, now illuminating my open door. My eyelids were growing heavy again, but I knew I couldn’t fall back asleep after a dream like that.

Sure, I’ve had dreams and nightmares all the time, but something about this felt cryptic. I checked my alarm clock; if I remember correctly, it was around 1:40 a.m. After fighting with my tired body for about twenty minutes, I got out of bed and walked downstairs.

The halls in my dream were so similar to the ones actually in my house. They radiated an eerie familiarity I hadn’t felt walking to my bedroom earlier that evening.

I realize that while describing my dream earlier, I mentioned that the end of the hallway was “just out of what my eyes could perceive.” But in reality, my eyes weren’t perceiving anything, were they? We sit with our eyes closed all night, yet our brains run wild, doing anything they please.

What did my brain want to show me?

These thoughts danced in my head as I made my way to the kitchen. It was then I saw a faint light emanating from the kitchen door. I could’ve sworn I had turned the lights off, just like I do every night.

I opened the door and it felt as if my organs dropped.

The sun was beaming through my kitchen windows, and it was strikingly silent. The only noise I could hear was the song of a mourning dove, almost as if it was being played on a loop. The light from the sun was bright but also… stale.

I was more concerned about the woman standing in front of my sink, however.

“Take a seat, my love. It won’t be too long now.” I would know that voice in a room of two hundred people.

“Breakfast will be done soon. Please take a seat.” She was insistent. I hastily took a seat at my dining room table, eyes welling up with tears.

“Honey? What are you doing here?”

I felt like I was flying. The warmth of the sun was more comforting than it usually felt, especially for a fall day in Wyoming. Perhaps it was the warmth coming from her, rather than the sun. She was my light, before I lost her.

I met Sarah eight years ago on a group camping trip with my friends. If you ever decide to go camping, make sure you go to the Bighorn Mountains. The only thing more beautiful than the trees, geography, and wildlife alike was her. She had a certain glow, one you can’t mistake for anything else.

We got married six months later in the same spot we had that camping trip.

“What are you still doing here, Eren?” Her voice was even softer than the wool of a sheep. I was silent for longer than I would like to admit.

“I won’t leave you, Sarah. It’s not a possibility.”

“I’m not there. I will not ever be there Eren. All you have left is what you’re seeing now.” Her voice grew stern, but still solemn.

I like to think I’m emotionally strong. When it comes to her, I have sadly never been that way. And so I cried for what seemed like an hour. It could’ve been even longer. By the time I was finished, I was back in my bed with Gus licking my face. My eyes were heavy, and I was completely blinded by the bright morning sun.

I’ve been having dreams all week, but last night was different. That was unmistakably Sarah’s voice. Sarah’s body. I know it was just a dream, but something about it screamed *wrong* to me.

I don’t have many friends, so I thought my best bet would be to write out my experience and see if anyone has some advice. I’ll keep updating this page on what happens across the next few nights. If anyone has any feedback, it would be greatly appreciated.

Much love,
