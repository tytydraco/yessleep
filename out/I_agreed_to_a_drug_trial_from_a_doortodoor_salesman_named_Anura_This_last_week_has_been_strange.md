The man with the pills came on Friday. 

I heard the knocks, and began sneaking from my normal place, the La-Z-Boy in front of my flat screen, towards the front room. I saw a short, round, silhouette standing on the other side of the oval stained-glass window of the front door. I waited for the shape to leave, or knock again, but neither happened. I slid from the living room into the hallway, and then against the wall.

"Excuse me, Sir, you are terribly hidden," The shape said. "If you would prefer me to come back another time, that can be arranged--but I would *love* to show you something first."

"Who exactly are you? Some kind of salesman?" I couldn't believe I replied, but the professional tone (and British accent) drew me in.

"Some kind of salesman, *indeed*." said the shape, "I've come to bring you what you need, you see, I know for certain I have. If you'd only open the door, I'll prove it to you. Come now, I can't stand here all day."

"Haven't you ever heard of catching more flies with honey?" I said, opening the door. Curiosity had gotten the better of me.

"Yes, as a matter of fact I have", Said the Salesman, "but I take it with a grain of salt. Flies will land on horseshit just as often."

 The man standing on my porch was funny looking, to say the least. If encouraged to be more descriptive, one would say he was unfortunate to look at. He had long, thin legs that went up to an abnormally round body. His arms were comparatively short, but thin as well, his hands were fat, and had dimples on the knuckles. His head appeared to be connected directly to his shoulders. He was wearing a brown, three-piece suit. He had large hazel eyes, and large bushy sideburns. He was holding a suitcase.

"I'll get right to it, Mr. Treble, I *have* come to sell you something. It's not spot remover, or a subscription to Readers Digest—it's much more . . . interesting." He sat the suitcase on the ground and unlatched the scuffed brass locks, and quickly removed a glass vial. "This, my good man, is what you *need*. This diet pill will beef you up, burn fat, *and* give you the energy and concentration you need to succeed. This little pill will change your life."

I looked at him for a moment in disbelief. This man, who I had *never* seen before, had the audacity to tell me what I needed.  
  
The Salesman was right, though.  
  
This stranger had told me he had a cure for all of my specific problems. I admittedly am a bit chicken legged, and sort of rotund. I have been going through a creative block as well, I haven't really been able to make anything new for my clients. In fact, I was waiting on Jeanie to call me later that morning expecting a new logo for a local appliance chain. Honestly, I've recently lost my energy and motivation to work, and apparently this miracle pill could fix it. Mark Ryan, my partner for nearly 15 years, had just brought up my lull in creativity last Thursday at our weekly meeting, or 'Pit Stop' as we called it.

"That's a look that I like to see." The Salesman said, "My name is Mr. Anura, and no, I don't want your money."

"Let’s stop this mind-reading thing," I said, “I imagine you've been doing this for a while, and I'm sure there are common trends you're following. I'm not interested in any crazy drug that some door-to-door salesman is peddling out of his briefcase. Have a good day, Mr. Anura, I'm done here."

"I'll give you $5,000 if you try this drug for a week." He continued, “If you take this bottle, finish the prescribed dosage, and live with the benefits for a week, I will pay you." He pulled a chewed stogie from his pocket, licked his lips, and bit down on it.

"What's the catch?" I asked, watching the Salesman chew his cigar. He laughed at my question, and for the first time, I thought I saw a neck. It ballooned out as he chortled.

"There isn't a catch, John, you sign a release, that you'll be sure to read *all* of, you take the pills, and I bugger off. I come back in a week with a stack of cash for you, and I get to pick your brain. Let me know how you've been."

John thought on it for a moment, and though that he couldn't possibly be dumb enough to fall for this . . . but that there would be no harm in looking over the release.

As I read through the surprisingly thick release form, I arrived at a page with the header "KNOWN SIDE EFFECTS" and felt my heartbeat speed up. *This is where it all gets fucky, right?  It’s all been surprisingly agreeable, even the non-disclosure agreement, but here's where it all gets bad.* I was very quickly relieved of those thoughts, as the side effects seemed to be quite mild-- to me, anyway.  
  
 NAUSEA, SOME SLEEPLESSNESS, MILD SKIN IRRITATION.   
  
When I finally arrived at the page that contained a blank line for my signature, I looked up to the Salesman for the first time in what had to have been 5 minutes. He was holding a pen in an outstretched hand, smiling.

"Agreeable, I imagine." Mr. Anura said, still smiling.  
  
"What has you so convinced that I'm into this?" 

"Well," Anura said, still maintaining his smile, "You don't appear to be a dumb man, and this is a pretty easy decision--you get a bunch of good stuff, including money, all you have to do is not talk about it. . . and deal with some rather small side effects."

Suddenly it hit me that he'd been using my name throughout our entire conversation. 

"How do you know my name?"

"Excuse me?"

"My name, you keep calling me by name. How do you know my name?"

"I got a tip, from a friend of yours. This isn't a chance meeting, John." Anura said, taking the stogie from his mouth. "Your friend is trying to help you as much as I'm trying to help myself. Get you out of a rut, and of course, get me a check in my 'success' column. Scratch my back, yadda, yadda."

"And I would assume that you aren't going to say who threw me under the bus?"

"You assume correctly, Mr. Treble."

"I sign, I take pills, and I get five thousand dollars-- no bull shit?"

"No bull shit."

"Give me the pen."

I walked back inside, bottle in hand. I gave it a small shake and read the note the Salesman slipped me before walking off my porch.  
  
*Don’t hesitate to call me if anything of interest happens. Just follow these instructions, John, and get ready -- this isn't snake oil.* 

*-A.*

TAKE ONE PILL BY MOUTH TWO TIMES PER DAY UNTIL GONE, TAKE WITH FULL GLASS OF WATER. DO NOT TAKE WITH EMPTY STOMACH

"Simple enough, I suppose", I said to myself. As I took the pill form the bottle and raised it to my mouth my cell phone rang. *Saved by the bell*, I thought. Jeanie's name flashed on the caller ID.

"Hey-a, Jeanie. I was just about to call you, I've almost got that new logo done -- I've just hit a couple snags, I'm going to send you something to --"

"Mark is dead. His house burned down with him in it last night."

"*Oh"* I said, in a voice I didn't recognize. "How - ... what happened?" 

"It looks like he fell asleep with a lit cigarette," Jeanie began, her voice hitching, "He probably had one too many while watching the game and passed out."

An image of Mark, with an empty twelve pack beside him, a lit Marlboro in his hand slowly burning down to the filter, flashed across my mind. Not unlikely. The Guardians had been playing hot and cold all season, and Mark often took his baseball related frustrations out on his liver.

"John?" Jeanie said, " - we are supposed to have a meeting with Olson Lumber today, should I cancel?"

"Yes, Jeanie, of course. They'll understand. I can call Bill and tell him myself. Do Mark's parents know what happened?" My head was spinning. I was on auto pilot. I felt like I was pretending to be an adult.

There was a pause, then Jeanie seemed to snap back to it. "Yeah, I called them first, Deputy Brahm called me as soon as he got there with the Fire Department."

There was a strange echo to everything that she was saying to me. The phone felt as though it weighed a thousand pounds, and my legs were giving out. "Okay. I'm going to go now, alright?"  
  
I hung up before she could respond. I looked down at the pill, which I'd placed on the counter when my phone rang and took it. I drank my glass of water, but I couldn't be paid to give a shit about my empty stomach.   


I walked around my kitchen island for a little while, thinking about what my life looked like now, how I was going to run a business. Was I going to run a business? Mark did every damn thing, he took care of the books, he talked to the clients, he *found* the clients for godssake. All I did was draw pictures.  
  
Draw the damn pictures.  
  
I went to my computer and shook it awake with the mouse and got to work. I finished a logo in one pass, it was original, it was cool, it was complete. Anyone would happily pay money for it. I decided to finish up a presentation that I'd put off for a potential client that Mark was going to meet with tomorrow, honestly, he could sell ice to a snowman, but THIS shit was gold.    
  
I looked down at the clock on my monitor and it read 8:45 PM.   
  
4 straight hours of work was a rare commodity in the life of a blocked artist. I needed to tell Mark that I pulled through, and we were going to bag this thing.

Mark.

*"*Mark is fucking gone." I said to an empty house.

Every single memory I had with Mark hit me like a brick. 

Move in day at Ohio University, graduation, the day we opened Ryan & Treble marketing agency.  The day that Jeanie and Mark were married. (I had stood in front of an assembly of mutual friends and given a poorly planned, alcohol aided, best man speech. Everyone seemed to cringe, or look away, but Mark listened through the whole deal, and even shed a tear or two). The day that Jeanie and Marks divorce was finalized, we sat on my porch and killed a case of Miller Lite and listened to Cleveland lose game 7 of the 2016 world series. 

I looked at my phone for a while, then went and laid down. The thought of calling Mark, and him not answering, was too much. 

I woke up at 7:25 -- five minutes before my alarm. I'd had a dream that I was tangled in a net, I felt the hemp rope digging into my arms and my neck, it was even between my toes. After shaking the dream, I felt surprisingly okay. Losing people, sad as it is, becomes more normal the older you get. It sucks, God does it suck, but it gets livable. On top of feeling okay emotionally, I felt okay physically. More than okay, actually. I decided to roll with it. Waste not want not. Time to take a Pill.

*Tsk-tsk-tsk, Jonny boy, can't take these on an empty stomach,* I thought, and made myself a big breakfast. I hadn't had an appetite like this in a while and chalked it up to eating my emotions. I sat down to my chow and checked my Facebook feed. Marks picture was goddamned everywhere. Tons of phony people came from the woodwork, it seemed. College friends I didn't remember, high school friends who may have well never existed. Memories shared; pictures posted. Who needs an *obit* when you have a Facebook? As I scrolled, I cried, as I cried, I ate. I finally put my phone down and turned on the small TV on the kitchen counter. I flipped channels for a while, and kept on eating, when I looked away from the TV I got back on my phone. I was fidgeting. "I'm wired." I said to myself. "I'm goddamn *wired.*"  I knew it was the pill but didn't much care. This felt pretty O.K. *Maybe I'm just taking speed. Adderall or something like it,* I thought, *oh* *well, I'll probably need the energy.* I popped pill number 2. 

Energy I had in spades.

I decided to put it to good use. The calls were taken care of. The not-so-fun-our-business-partner-has-died kind of calls. After letting the client base of T & R Marketing know that he was gone, and that 'business stuff' would be secondary for a while, I got to work on the house. It was a dump. In my rut, I had let chores get away from me. I did my dishes, I did laundry, I started to clean the damn walls. Then the first of the listed side effects started. The itching. It was barely noticeable at first, but it turned into a fire in my forearms. I dug at it until I nearly drew blood, and then decided to take a shower.  When I hopped out, dried off, and got dressed, the cleaning continued. When I was cleaning the bathroom tile grout with an old toothbrush, I decided it *had* to be speed. This is also when I saw the first bug. 

It wasn't giant, or alien looking, but it was gross. It was a worm, but a not-so-normal worm. "A fucking silverfish?” I thought out loud, "No. I don't even know what a silverfish is, but this can't be it." It wasn't silver, for one, and it looked very similar to one of those meal worms that they feed to lizards. This one, however, was a bit bigger. Fatter, to be specific, it's palpitating, beige body, had ridges around it. It didn't appear to be hard, and smooth, like the meal worms either, this creature looked fleshy, and damp.

"Fuck you, fella." I said, while crushing it with the handle of the toothbrush. There was an audible squelch, then a ribbon of bright red blood came shooting out of what I believed to be its head. I cleaned up and went on with my chores. 

I finished cleaning the windows in the house and decided it was good enough. Mainly because I had caught up on everything. I was still wired though, so I decided it was time for a run. I ran through town, around the square, and back. This had done nothing for my energy level (still through the roof) but it had given me hunger pangs. I made myself three turkey & cheese sandwiches, stacked high with lettuce and tomato. I stood in the kitchen sweating from the run, zoned out, and devouring my food. I was resigned to the energy now. I didn't want it to go, it was carrying me through the loss of Mark. 

The energy stayed, and watching some TV in my recliner was out of the question; I was vibrating.   
I decided to sit down at my desk and do some work -- a small ad-agency with one graphic designer was frequently backlogged with commissions. Miraculously, with the help of The Pill, I busted out 7 original designs, and finished up a website. After a mad dash through my e-mails, finishing our commissions, and even replying to the occasional "Sorry for your loss" Facebook message, I sat back and looked around.  
  
A spotless house. A clear inbox. 

I leaned back in my chair and let my eyes close. Sleep came at me quickly, after my eyes were shut, clouds of deep blues and purples began to fill my mind. Inky blackness reached around my brain and, gripped it tightly - I was gone. 

I woke up to loud banging on my door. I jumped from my chair and peaked into the hallway and stared at the stained-glass window on the door. Something was leaning against it, moaning. 

"John...” It croaked.

I was frozen, the figure suddenly dropped out of sight, then a hand slammed against the glass. I acted before I could think. 

"Hey!" I cried, "Get the fuck away from my door!" 

The hand sunk slowly, then the figure appeared behind the glass again, and proceeded to bang on the door, sounded like the palm of a hand rather than a balled-up fist. 

"John!" The voice yelled; I recognized it now. It was Jeanie. But she sounded off, I rushed for the door. When I opened it, the smell of booze hit me hard. Jeanie was shit-housed drunk.

"Ah, Jeanie. What the hell are you doing? Get inside." I pulled her in and sat her in the dining chair he kept in the hall, and she slumped. 

"He'd be mad, you know." She said mater-of-factly. "He'd be mad that I got drunk without him. I never would drink with him, and it drove him nuts." 

"Well," I said sliding down the wall until my ass hit the floor, "I feel right now, that I should have done less of it with him. I think maybe he drank too much."

"He would have just had yours for you." She said, looking at me. She smiled, and I smiled. She then let out a tremendous burp.

"That sounded like it had some body to it -- are you gonna barf?"   
  
She looked at me blankly and said "I'm fine. why are you digging at yourself? You ever heard of soap and water, Johnny boy?" She laughed and then scrambled down the hallway to the bathroom and, after hearing the toilet seat slam against the tank, I heard her begin to wretch.   
  
I noticed the scratches up my forearms, and on my exposed calves. I had been scratching at myself without even noticing it.

"Oh my god that's *gross!*" Jeanie called from the bathroom.

"Listen, I don't need to hear about how gross it is please just clean it up, you wouldn't believe it, but I just cleaned."

"Not me you *asshole.* These worms! What's with all these fucking worms?"

I made for the bathroom to see what she was talking about but had a feeling I knew what would be there. As I walked in, Jeanie stepped down from the rim of the tub, pointing at the toilet bowl. There, across the tank, the lid, and the floor were dozens of replicas of the worm from earlier. 

"Yeah," I said, grabbing a roll of toilet paper from under the sink, getting to work scooping the worms into the toilet, "I saw one of these guys earlier. Thought it was a one-off, but here we are." 

Jeanie washed her face at the sink and grabbed a towel from the rack and screamed - the towel had a handful of the same, undulating, worms. "John, these are screw-worms. Why the hell do you have screw-worms?" 

"I have no idea what a screw-worm is, for one, and for two, I don't know. They just showed up today. This morning, actually. It was just one though. I didn't know that I was infested with these little shits."

"Well, it's strange, screw-worms are little parasites. Usually hang out inside cows before turning into flies. I have zero idea how you would have screw-worms en masse hanging out around your house."

"Well me either."

"I'm sorry to go farm girl on you, but that's gross... I'm a little more sober now, and I think I should go."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah. I don't know why I came over here in the first place. I don't know if I should be here anyway. I don't really know what to think right now."

We looked at each other for a long time before she showed herself out. I cleaned up the bugs but kept one in an old film canister I found at my desk. Anura had asked me to tell him if anything of interest happened. And this was pretty damn interesting.

When I get up tomorrow, I'm going to give this guy a ring, I'm also going to look at some exterminators. The itching is getting absolutely horrendous. I can feel it in the palms of my hands now.

I'll keep you guys posted as to what happens moving forward, but I'm fucking exhausted.
