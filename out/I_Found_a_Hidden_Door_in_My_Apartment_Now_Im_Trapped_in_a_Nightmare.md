I never considered myself a believer in the paranormal. Ghosts, demons, haunted houses—those were just stories to scare kids or make for a good horror movie. I’m a logical person; I work in data analysis, for God’s sake. Numbers and facts are my bread and butter. But what happened after I moved into this apartment… I still struggle to make sense of it.

It started when I moved into this old building downtown, one of those historic ones that has “character,” as the real estate agent called it. The place had been recently renovated, modern appliances, new flooring, but it still had that old-world charm with creaky floors and vintage moldings. I was excited. It was a steal for the location, and the city view was amazing.

It was a few days after I moved in that I found the door. I’d been rearranging some furniture, pushing an old wardrobe across the room when I noticed it. It was small—almost child-sized—and tucked away in the corner of the room behind where the wardrobe had been. I hadn’t noticed it during my initial walkthrough with the landlord, and the fact that it had been hidden like that struck me as odd.

The door was strange, to say the least. It was painted a different color from the rest of the walls, a dull, faded blue that seemed to have no business being there. The doorknob was an old brass one, tarnished and cold to the touch. Dust coated the frame, and cobwebs clung to the corners. It looked like it hadn’t been touched in years, maybe decades.

At first, I thought it was just some old storage space or maybe an old utility closet. I didn’t think much of it. But there was something about the door that made me uneasy. A sense of wrongness that I couldn’t shake off. I decided to leave it alone.

That night, as I was getting ready for bed, I heard it. A faint scratching noise, like something was moving around behind the walls. I told myself it was just a mouse or some other small animal that had gotten into the walls. This was an old building, after all.

The next night, the scratching was louder. And this time, there was something else. Whispering. Soft, barely audible, like a breeze rustling through leaves. I couldn’t make out any words, but the sound sent a chill down my spine. I searched the apartment, trying to find the source of the noise, but it always seemed to be coming from everywhere and nowhere at once.

The third night, I woke up to the sound of my TV turning on by itself. The screen flickered with static, casting an eerie glow around the room. The whispering was louder now, more insistent. I could almost make out words, but they were garbled, like listening to a conversation underwater. I turned off the TV, but as soon as I sat back down, it turned on again. The lights began to flicker, and the air grew cold—so cold I could see my breath.

That’s when I noticed it. The door. It was slightly ajar.

I don’t know what possessed me to do it, but I felt a compulsion—a pull. I had to know what was behind that door. I grabbed my phone, switched on the flashlight, and slowly approached. As I pushed it open, a gust of cold, musty air hit me, carrying with it the scent of decay and something else—something metallic.

The door opened to a narrow hallway, dark and dusty. I could tell immediately that this hallway didn’t match the layout of the building. It seemed to stretch on far beyond the dimensions of my apartment. I should have turned back right then and there, but I didn’t. I stepped through.

The floorboards creaked under my feet as I moved further down the hallway. My flashlight beam danced across the walls, illuminating faded, peeling wallpaper and cobweb-covered light fixtures. Scattered on the ground were old, decaying toys—dolls with missing eyes, rusty toy cars, and small, wooden blocks. The whispering grew louder, surrounding me. It sounded like children, their voices overlapping in a soft, eerie chorus.

I turned a corner and found myself in a room. An old nursery, judging by the decor. The room was filled with dusty, forgotten furniture—a crib, a rocking chair, a small dresser. The wallpaper was peeling, revealing dark stains underneath. My flashlight caught movement in the corner. I froze, my breath caught in my throat.

There, in the shadows, was a figure. Small, childlike, but wrong. Its limbs were too long, its head tilted at an unnatural angle. It looked like a child, but its eyes… its eyes were black, void of any emotion or life. I felt a wave of terror wash over me, and in that moment, I knew I had to get out.

I turned and ran. The hallway seemed to stretch longer with every step, the door to my apartment growing further away. The whispering turned to giggles, then to cries and screams. “Stay with us,” the voices pleaded, their tone desperate and malevolent.

I finally reached the door and slammed it shut behind me, breathing heavily, my heart pounding in my chest. I pressed my back against the door, trying to catch my breath. The apartment was silent now. The lights were steady, the TV off. Everything seemed normal, but I knew it wasn’t.

The next few days were a blur. I tried to block out what had happened, convince myself it was just a bad dream or a hallucination. But the door… the door wouldn’t let me. Every time I tried to seal it shut, it would open again, just a crack, as if inviting me back in. The noises didn’t stop either. The whispers, the laughter, the cries—they grew louder, more insistent, more desperate.

I started researching the building, trying to find any information that might explain what I had seen. What I found only made things worse. The building had a dark history. In the 1920s, several children had gone missing from the area. There were rumors of a former tenant, a woman who had been involved in strange rituals, a woman who had vanished without a trace.

I asked around, hoping for more answers. An elderly neighbor, who had lived in the building for decades, pulled me aside one day. “You should leave that door alone,” she said, her voice trembling. “Those who open it… they’re never the same.” She refused to say anything more.

Desperation took over. I decided to confront whatever was behind that door. I armed myself with a flashlight and a kitchen knife, feeling foolish but determined. I had to know. I had to see.

I opened the door again and stepped into the hallway. The air was thick and cold, the darkness swallowing my flashlight’s beam. I moved forward, my steps cautious and slow. The hallway twisted and turned, leading me deeper into the unknown.

Suddenly, I found myself in what looked like my apartment. But it was different. Decayed. Abandoned. The walls were covered in mold, the furniture broken and dusty. It was like stepping into a nightmare version of my home. And then, the door behind me slammed shut.

I spun around, my flashlight beam darting across the room. The whispers were back, louder than ever, now a cacophony of voices—angry, pleading, mocking. I ran to the door and tried to open it, but it wouldn’t budge. I pounded on it, screaming, but the only response was laughter.

And then I saw them. Figures emerging from the shadows, children with hollow eyes and twisted limbs, their faces contorted in expressions of pain and despair. They moved toward me, their steps slow and deliberate.

I backed away, my heart racing, my mind screaming in terror. “You can’t leave,” they whispered in unison, their voices filling my head. “You’re ours now.”

I don’t know how long I’ve been here. Days, weeks… time doesn’t seem to work the same way in this place. I’ve tried everything to get back, but the door won’t open. The whispering never stops. The figures are always watching, waiting.

I’m typing this from a laptop I found in this twisted version of my apartment. I don’t know if anyone will ever read this, but if you do, please understand: the door… it’s a trap. If you ever find a door that shouldn’t exist, leave it alone. Don’t open it. Don’t step through.

I hear them coming again. I have to go. Please, someone… help me.
