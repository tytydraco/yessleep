*All tucked in for the night, handsome? House to yourself, private browser at the ready, a hot and steamy menu of delinquent college girls waiting for your strong touch?*

*But what's that, my king - 18 is too old for you?*

*Ah, I get you. You wanna see some pigtails tugged; some Hello Kitty shorts at the ankles.*

*Well, why didn't you say so? I have just the place.*

*Indulge your fine, like-minded cravings at YELLOW KINGS, the most exquisite site for all your 'oh so special needs'.*

*We don't judge.*

*We don't ask.*

*We only show you exactly what you've been too afraid to peek at.*

*... Just don't tell anyone what you're watching.*

*It would drive them mad.*

\-

That was the first version of the ad I ever saw - a neat little autoplay window wedged between my feed. I'd convinced myself I'd misread it, a bit of smutty bait, until I realised the words were no trick.

They'd gotten brave. A disgusting corner of the dark web we'd thought was immured began making its rounds *everywhere*; shining advertisements and teenage-edited trends that were scrubbed clean, but never fast enough. People noticed, *people saw*, and it spread like wildfire - even making the news and morning shows - before fizzing into obscurity, murmured in only a select few circles, until it reared its ugly head again.

*And again.*

Confident. Untouchable. No amount of disappearing links or banned accounts could stop it. Not forever. And for most people, it remained nothing more than an occasional, creepy viral hiccup.

But for us, it was a bulbous beast that lurched carefree through the web, heaving, slapping its fat ass to boiling wolves below that had been sniffing its scent for months. Every lead would disintegrate in our hands: servers went dark, burner accounts snuffed out, payment trails shrivelled; one step ahead.

Then, by some miracle, those wolves found a tiny crack in the foundation and, with vigour and teeth, wrenched and tore until they had the neck of a squealing, slimy, pathetic thing in their clutches. His name was Lenny, and the poor freak shit himself when the door to his apartment exploded, and we barged into his musky, spunk-coated abode of sweat and intimacy.

A renegade who had dedicated his mid-30s to perusing swimming pool changing rooms, from the sanctuary of a camera he believed no one could touch him through.

My cross teetered on becoming a yoke.

I cannot recount the heresy that adorned his computers - not for lack of remembering; merely a diligent mercy - but I can recall the colour that festered his home.

A sickly, artificial glow, like that of nicotine-stained bulbs, spilt from every screen to tighten the walls and paste the air. It was not a clean, bright yellow, but a dirty, jaundiced hue that clung to every greasy keyboard, staining the horrid den into a hazy swamp.

It ached my eyes if they lingered too long.

Lenny's eyes must've longed to them for years; too wide and dry, rimmed red and veiny from endless, unblinking stares at the screens. His movements were jerky and unfocused, expedited by our raid. Sweat drenched his very being, his hair clotted, his breathing quick and shallow, and when he spoke, his words would tumble out in cracked bursts, as some on-screen delight snagged his attention away.

It only worsened as we pulled the plugs, damning his home into murky darkness, where the feverish shine in his gaze erupted into fire, as if we'd triggered an autonomous, hostile response.

Despite his frailness, he overpowered the officer restraining him, clawing into him like a rabid cat and reaching for the pistol he had stashed under his mattress.

A single gunshot went off. And Lenny reeled back, screaming in pain, at the clean hole I'd blasted through his hand, then another rifle smacked the side of his worming head to shut him up.

"You good?" I asked the recovering officer, pawing at the scratches across his face.

"I would've aimed for his neck."

When Lenny came to, the comfort of his bedroom was replaced with four blank walls painted the same shade as the den we bagged him from. I watched a flash of recognition and solace blitz across his wrinkled face, until his senses returned and he realised his fate; a rat smelling the needle.

He tried to move; discovered he couldn't. We hadn't bothered with visible ties, opting instead for a cocktail the techs had cooked that jittered and locked his muscles across the spine of a lounge chair; his hands twitched limp at his sides, his mouth slurring and drooling like post-lobotomy.

Enough to keep him from getting up; not enough to let him sleep.

The luxury of passing out is not one we would bless.

He eventually spotted me sitting on the table, my rifle still slung over my shoulder, his bloodied, bandaged hand recoiled at the sight.

"Aw, I think he recognises you, Cal." Another voice said, closer to the door, adjusting the recording camera mounted atop a tripod.

"Does your dog know he's awake?" I asked Jane, dressed more for a fishing trip than an interrogation.

Jane shifted her sunglasses, eying Lenny up and down as he soiled his tracksuit.

"Oh, yeah. He knows."

Lenny's bumbling, frightened mouth attempted to utter a sentence.

"Where... who-"

Jane cut him off with soothing shushes, stepping towards the man with a gentle, raised palm.

"Shh, you're safe, Leonard. Save your energy for our questions, yeah?"

At first, Lenny nodded sheepishly, but then the weight of potential questions quickly dawned on him like an ill tide.

"Wait, no-*no*... I didn't... I didn't *look*, I only-"

"Shh, Lenny. It's okay; we know." Jane rested a kind hand on his slick shoulder; Lenny looked to me with pleading desperation.

"The fuck you want me to do?"

Jane continued, as if consolidating a misbehaved toddler.

"We're not interested in what you watched, bud. We want what you *sent* \- to whom and to where, understand?"

"...they'll know-"

"We got some of your buddies, too. Your door wasn't the only one broken this morning, but, unlike them, you're *special*\-" Jane lied, squatting down, patting his knee. "I'm talking to you first. That's a gift; one I hope you return, and in exchange, I can soften the blows a bit. Does that sound nice?" She winked, and I think, maybe, Lenny could've understood her amidst a swirling mind of substances.

The door opened, and a tall man entered: grey-haired, battered, looking as if he'd just waltzed from a war zone. He carried a keg of water in one hand; a cylinder of compressed air in the other. Immediately, Jane back-stepped to the wall, giving him the room as he strode towards Lenny with nought a word, nor a lick of attention towards me. He squirmed in his chair as the man reached him, kicking his legs apart, planting himself over his thigh and pressing his entire body into his space without moderation.

"What's the matter?" He asked dryly, slowly adjusting his belt buckle that cut into Lenny's grunting cheek. "Don't like your boys this close?"

"Please, I-

"I'll leave you to it, Jack," I said, bounding off the table and making a quick exit.

Jane gave me a wave, a smile, and a little nod as I neared the door.

"If you wouldn't mind." She said softly, and I obliged, flicking a switch on the camera to dead its red eye, before stepping out of the soundproof chamber, closing the door behind me with a timid click.

I rolled the stiffness out of my shoulders as my hand drifted to the cross at my throat, then stopped. It almost felt wrong to touch it with the stink of Lenny's home still moulding on my skin.

Footsteps slapped somewhere down the concrete tunnel, quick and light, out of sync with the pace of the complex. I turned the corner and found a hooded shape some distance away, under faulty strip lighting, hugging a laptop tight to her chest like body armour.

Damn it.

"Hannah!" I called.

She flinched, then spotted me and relaxed. Her eyes were ringed with dark half-moons like she hadn't seen daylight in months.

"There you are," she said, breath fogging in the air. "I've been looking for you."

Of course she had. Ghosts don't sleep; they just haunt new halls.

"Wrong floor for I.T, kid," I said, falling swiftly into step beside her. "You get lost?"

"No, just followed the shouting," she replied. "Leads to you every time."

Up close, she always looked younger than she sounded on comms: twenty-something, baggy hoodie hanging off a narrow frame, fingers chewed down. The kind of kid that should be kept in a clean office.

"You shouldn't be down here," I muttered. "Not with Jack about."

"Relax, I'm not going in there." She gestured back towards where we came. "I just need you upstairs in the briefing room."

"For?"

She glanced up at me, something unexpectedly raw raging in her eyes.

"Ending this."

The room we'd chosen wasn't big enough for the cancer it grew, manifesting as a sprawling wall of printouts and mugshots that only made sense to those unfortunate enough to study it. Handwritten dates and usernames, chat logs, blurred screenshots from live feeds; every 'image' from Yellow Kings that Legal would let us pin, smudged into anonymity.

But some shapes could still be identified - small bodies in decorated film sets, from recreational schools to whimsical castles, pixelated or redacted so heavily their identities were rendered a captioned black square.

One blurred youth in a paper crown stared back at us - 'The Birthday Boy' was scrawled underneath in someone's weak hand; his small, pale shoulders hunched over a supermarket cake.

Something tightened behind my eyes and broke in my chest upon seeing their latest lamb again, only known to us for a few days.

"Close the door," Hannah said quietly, stepping past me. She moved to the central table and dropped her laptop, flipping it open with practised violence. The screen's blue glow cut a brutal gash through the room's gloom, painting her face in cold light. She tapped a rapid pattern across the keys; windows blurred past too quickly to read, access banners screamed and died in a heartbeat, and a myriad of red flags dwindled in and out of existence.

"Hannah-"

"Boss asked for results." Her voice snapped, sharper than I'd ever heard it. "Not another report." She stopped typing and briefly looked up at the case wall. "You wanna stare at them forever, or do you want to start taking them down?"

The pain behind my eyes intensified; the wall seemed to swirl at the edges, as if the faces were trying to unveil themselves, begging to look back. To be seen; to be known.

"What have you found?" I asked quickly, peeling my eyes away.

She spun the laptop toward me.

A satellite image filled the screen - grey and green mountains; a thin road snaking up through dark woodlands to a pale smear of architecture clinging to the hillside.

*Carcosa Wellness Retreat*

Expensive. Isolated. Smug.

"On paper," Hannah said, voice flat, "it's a luxury clinic where rich people pretend to be broken." She tapped a key, and the brochure view faded, replaced by new layers. Thermal overlays, altered floor plans, and elevation cuts that rivalled our own. The building's guts unfolded in phantasmic lines; three clean, legal stories above ground, and then a true body plunging into the rock, level after level after level.

Against the darkness of the deepest cut, a hot, pulsing blotch of orange and red flared like an ember lodged in bone.

A server farm. It had to be.

"... off paper?" I asked.

Her finger traced the glowing mass.

"Everything we've tried to track. Every dead link; every fried server with their grubby mitts on it... they all point here. And I imagine your pig downstairs does too." She drew a shaky breath. "They will keep severing their own arteries to hide their heart."

She tapped the screen.

"Yet there it is. *Right there*."

"How long for a warrant?" I asked, even though some part of me already knew the answer.

"We're not getting one." The words landed like a verdict, a dust-dry certainty.

I stared at her, momentarily lost for words, then looked at the satellite view again. A white building stared back, pristine, with swimming pools glinting like dead eyes, the surrounding trees forming a dark ring.

My head throbbed; too bright.

"If you're wrong-"

"I'm not.

"*If* you're wrong!" I repeated, forcing the words out. "There is no fixing that, do you understand?

Hannah's fingers tapped the edge of the laptop in a low, staccato rhythm. Her gaze slid over the case wall, then faltered to the floor.

"I know," she muttered. "I just don't... I don't want to look at them anymore, I can't, Cal. Can you?"

I didn't look, not directly. But my eyes still played with them, finding them in my peripherals as if they were needles lost to a field of static. My hand went to my cross, and this time it stayed there. Old weight settled atop my shoulders - anger, obligation, and something worse... comfort.

"We've crossed lines before," she continued, as if reading my thoughts, trying to twist my arm until my skin burned. "You have. Jane has. Jack *definitely* has. It's why you're *down there* and not up here. What's one more?"

"...When?" I heard myself ask.

She let out a tiny sigh of relief.

"Tonight. No record, no books, no chain of command. Just the four of us, an MOC, a 'routine maintenance check' in the system for whoever gets curious later. You go in like ghosts; you drag *something* out - anything that brings this fucking monster into the light!"

A flash of lightning bled pale against the high, barred windows, outlooking the murky city streets below. Thunder rolled a second later, a low, distant growl that rattled the frames, and in that brief moment, she looked like the most delirious young woman on Earth.

"I'll talk to Jane," I said with a solemn nod. "Get it 'signed off'. Plausible deniability."

She closed her laptop with a snap, satisfied, and the room darkened again, smothering the brief clarity her screen had offered. She moved towards the door, but I stopped her with a gentle grip on her arm.

"Get some sleep. Please."

Her eyes went wide, uncomfortable, as if this was the first sign of care another soul had shown her in a long, long time.

"I will."

And then she was gone, her steps fading down the corridor, leaving me alone with paper faces and a fleeting pounding in my head. I stared at the wall one last time and tried desperately, hopefully, to imagine it coming down; my hands placing names into files marked 'closed'. Not a monastery of everything we'd failed to stop, but a vile, vanquished evil, not long for this world, quelled by us and our righteous deeds.

*Carcosa.*

The word sat in my head like a thorn.

Somewhere real; somewhere tangible.

A place we could touch; scour.

The supposed heart of the beast.

Something to burn.

\-

We killed the headlights a mile out as the mountain swallowed us, reducing the world outside to no more than an implication.

Hannah was pressed into the corner, half-folded around a computer desk with a headset clamped over her ears. While Jane sat opposite, boots square on the deck, back straight despite the constant sway of our metal chariot, a rifle between her knees. She went over her gear without hurry; a quiet inventory.

At the far end, beside the doors, Jack might as well have been built into the hull. The plates on his vest were merged into his frame, his helmet resting in his lap, inexplicably still. He checked nothing; he'd gone over himself a dozen times before we rolled. Only his eyes moved, watchful in the dim, as if he were somewhere he wasn't wanted.

My own rifle lay across my thighs, sling tight over my shoulder. The plates over my chest had settled like a second, heavier ribcage.

I felt composed.

Then the MOC hit a rut, and the shock drove through the bench and up my spine. Hannah's head jerked; the computer slid, and her fingers snapped out to catch it before it fell, nails scraping the plastic.

Jane's thin voice filled the muffled space, but not aimed at her.

"Relax, Cal." She murmured; I must've given myself away. "If this goes to shit, they'll come for you and me long before they find her name."

"She didn't have to be here," I said.

Jack's voice then came from the dark.

"She put us on this road. She walks down it too."

"She's a kid-"

"No older than you, when we first plucked you from your cot. You remember those days, hm? Busting your little drug dens? What a *long* way you've come, boy."

Jane's gentle hand found my knee before I could say anything; before I could truly reminisce about the years I thought jailing punks with cheap pistols was the real fight.

"First time is always the worst; you know that. Have faith that she can handle the field - and besides, she has you. Right?"

The MOC's engine dropped to a low growl as Hannah hunched over her keyboard, clicking to her fingers' content, muttering some tech wizardry to herself.

"Road's quiet." She said, her voice a soft serenade in my earpiece, oblivious to our words. "I've got four - no, five bodies on the grounds. Armed."

The driver's voice crackled through the intercom; a nameless, loyal hire who owed Jane a favour.

"Two hundred out, one minute. They won't see us."

"Pulling thermal." Hannah frowned, the light on her screen shifting to a bright orange. "The place is still hot; power draw is constant." A tight, humourless breath left her.

Excitement, perhaps.

"Nothing scaled back?" I asked.

"No," she shot. "We are exactly where we need to be."

The driver again: "Fifty out."

We turned to a stop, and the engine died.

The rain pressed in.

Hannah dragged another window. "I'm mostly blind underground - make sure your body cams are on." She admitted, almost impatiently.

Jack rose, locking his helmet in place. "We'll get you eyes inside, kid. Vision up."

We dropped our goggles, dimming the world to a flat green haze.

"Ramp."

Hydraulics groaned, and a cold, wet air knifed in as the rear hatch opened and lowered, revealing the distant, faint glow of Carcosa lurking beneath the mountain.

An utter eyesore.

Hannah's voice slid in after, steady, wired tight.

"Comms check. Cal?"

"Here."

"Jane?"

"I read you."

"Jack?"

"Hmph."

"Alright," Hannah said. "Down to the outer wall, you'll find a generator and a side gate. One guard on patrol." At last, she looked up from her computer and towards me. "No going back now, huh?"

"Be safe."

She said nothing, her attention returning to her screen.

"Jack, take point," Jane said, and he stepped first into the foliage with her on his shoulder. I followed, boots ringing once on the ramp before the land suffocated us. It closed behind me, sealing Hannah within.

We never touched the path.

We blitzed through the pines instead - three shades hugging trunks. Through the branches, I caught glimpses of the dazzling front gate; the lazy shapes of guards in the rain, smoking and shifting under umbrellas, waging battles against boredom.

"Service block by the fence," Hannah said in our ears. "No camera cones."

I saw it - a metal shed squirming with cables, its exhaust droning into the downpour, squatted under rotting rust and mildew. Jack's hand came up, closing into a fist.

"You're clear," Hannah said, keys clacking faintly behind her voice as she locked herself in her box.

Jack didn't hesitate, peeling from the greenery. Jane slipped after him, then me, boots sucking in the mud, rifles angled low; the rain ate our noise. He wasn't subtle either as he drove a pry bar under a maintenance hatch. The panel shrieked, then gave, clattering to the ground. Inside was a mess of wires and breakers, labels bleached and curling. Jane elbowed in beside him.

"Bottom left." Hannah guided. "Make it ugly."

Jane's fingers found the breaker, and she glanced back at us, the faintest hint of a smile invisible to anyone without years of knowing her.

"You heard the girl."

She threw the switch.

And the world coughed.

Carcosa's light snuffed in stages - the bank of courtyard lights popped and died; a gatehouse went black; windows along the upper floors winked out, and for a heartbeat, the generator screamed, fighting a death sentence.

Darkness, in its purest form, fell. A slab of black tar that punched through the rain, damning the resort into a silhouette; a sharp absence against the choked sky.

Shouts cut across the yard.

Then a lone voice.

"What the fuck?"

He appeared from the corner of the service block, coalescing out of the rain. No helmet; just a hooded jacket, gun hanging loose, his flashlight beam thrashing as he tried to investigate the failure.

He never saw Jack as he stepped past me, raising his rifle in a single, smooth arc without breath; without warning.

The shot was a viscous pop through the suppressor.

The guard's head snapped sideways, and he folded straight down, knees buckling, body thumping into the wet stone. His flashlight spun away, beam carving manic circles before settling.

"One down."

I'd expected this. Maybe I *wanted* it. Still, something clenched in my chest at how little it cost him.

"Courtyard's panicked," Hannah reported, tone sharpening - almost in awe. "Two moving off the main door; other two at the gate pressing buttons."

Jack found a section of fence where the mesh sagged, dropped to a knee, cutters in hand, and chewed through the links with quick, efficient bites. He slipped through the gap and vanished into the compound.

I waited for Jane to follow, but she lingered a moment. Watching me.

"You good?" She asked quietly.

"Fine," I lied. The dead guard stared up at nothing, rain pooling in his eyes, his blood already diluting into a halo.

"Then move."

Two more guards were visible by the NV glow - one waving an arm towards the darkened. main building, the other scanning the sky as if the weather was to blame.

Jane tapped my arm, then pointed. We stacked by a cocktail bar; three sights hunting. Jack leaned out first and took the one closest. I mirrored him on the other. Jane's barrel stayed between them, ready to pick up any misses.

"Now," she breathed.

Two soft pops - two white blooms amidst our vision of green.

My target jerked and folded over the nearest table, knocking it away. Jack's dropped backwards beside a pool, arms flung wide, spinning into the dark.

"That's three."

"Two left at the gate," Hannah said. "One just ducked inside the gatehouse; other's at the door."

We crossed the open space at a low run, cutting behind plants and deck chairs. I could see a thin sliver of movement in the booth's glass: a phone screen. Jane held up three fingers once we'd stopped, then folded them down one by one.

The outer guard was turned slightly away, head craned towards the courtyard, calling out to where his friend had stopped existing. I found the soft angle of his neck; Jack took his torso; Jane tracked over both.

He collapsed in the doorway, dropping straight into the booth guard's legs. Inside, the second man lurched up from his chair, hands tangling with a dead radio, mouth opening, phone light dancing. Jack shot him in the chest, flinging him back into an assembly of blank monitors. He slid down, leaving a half-visible smear through the pane.

I thought it might've been a trick of the rain, or a delusion brought on by a racing heart, but I knew the reality. That man was... smiling. A wicked, devilish grin bewitched across his face as his greying eyes, somehow, found mine in the dark, filling him with the utmost clarity as he departed this mortal coil.

My hand brushed my cross before I could stop it.

"No alarms. You're clear." Hannah said quietly. "A couple figures on thermal inside; no mass movements yet."

Jack nudged a fallen guard aside with his boot and leaned on the metal door frame, then winced, hard, yanking his head away from the gatehouse where the other corpse lay beside a still-lit phone, and I wondered, if I were to remove my goggles, what colour of light would ooze from its screen.

"Hannah," he said, forcing his voice out. "Get us the fastest route down."

"On it... service corridor, west side, two doors past reception. I'll walk you in."

Jack advanced towards the blind compound, and Jane, once again, gave me her attention instead of following immediately.

"They're just meat in the way." She said.

"I know." I lied again.

She huffed, satisfied, and chased her obedient sledgehammer to the front door.

The reception was an abandoned mess; the type made in the event of a fire evacuation.

Stage dressing.

For this 'retreat' had never had a real guest.

"Fuck." Hannah spat in our ears. "Thermals moving. Fast. Both retreating downstairs."

Jack charged past the empty front desk into a corridor that stunk of bleach and something sweet, metallic, and a familiar headache tightened as we hit the first stairwell.

"What're we walking into, Hannah?"

There was a long pause before she answered.

"Only the two. Just... going down-"

"Any more security?" Jane asked, checking a magazine.

"No, it's-... It's just them; they're... *kids*."

The word hit like buckshot to kevlar.

This was *foul*, and we knew it; I saw it in the look we gave each other, in their hesitations before taking that first step, and how they grimaced at the pressure they too felt in their heads, but to turn back now after what she'd said would be a sacrilege.

So we descended, hastily, emergency strips of dull amber lighting our way. The headache grew too much, so I lifted my goggles, and soon Jane and Jack did the same, trading harsh green light for a soothing, dim yellow one.

B1.

A landing later, B2.

The deeper we went, the air grew colder, but the sweat between my armour and skin was hot and sour, as my rapid footsteps came back from the walls a half-second late. We followed Hannah's every word as she updated us on our quarry that, supposedly, was the only living thing in here, growing closer to the core - our true prize; our purpose, that we had to focus on, 'less doubt snuck in.

At B3, the stairwell opened to a service floor: laundry trolleys lined in perfect rows, carts full of folded costumes.

At the far end of the corridor, something moved.

We'd caught up.

A duo of small shapes emerged within the spill of an emergency light - too thin, too still, draped in hospital gowns made into royal garments - one was white; one a sickly yellow. One of them clutched something close to their chest - a soft toy, maybe, or just a bundle of cloth.

The other had a paper crown on his head.

For a moment, they just stared - two bodies; four little cautious, tired eyes, afraid to be caught.

My chest locked as my mind returned to a looming case wall that had brought us many sleepless nights, soon to be spared of two faces I could put names to.

A small victory, finally, only meters away.

Almost served to us on a pity platter.

The closest one - the prince in yellow - twitched first, and then he grabbed the wrist of his small partner, and they broke at once, turning, scattering, bare feet slapping the floor in a wild stampede.

"Wait!" Jane shouted, already surging after them.

They darted through a fire door we hadn't clocked, slamming into it full-body, and it burst open onto another stairwell, this one plunging far further into the stomach. The light framed them as wraiths, bones under skin, clinging to the railing as they tumbled down.

Jack followed.

But I couldn't move, my cross burning cold against my throat like a cursed talisman. I faltered for too long, staring at the open door and the black well beyond, as the echoes of frightened, frantic pursuits bounced up towards me.

"What's down there, Hannah?!" I asked her, forcing my legs to move, praying that a 'server farm' was all that awaited me.

She did not reply.

"Hannah?!"

Nothing.

"Fuck!"

I lost them on the way down.

I'd flinched, they hit the next landing, took a turn I didn't, and when I reached B4, I came out alone.

I snapped pleas into my comms.

I met only static.

"Hannah?! Are you there?!"

More static - a low, steady hiss that had found a home.

My HUD said the link was fine, battery full, no reason for her to be gone, except-*no.*

No, don't think that. I couldn't think that.

She was safe. Invisible.

Just follow the footsteps, Callum, I thought, as I nudged through a propped-open door, rifle first.

B4 led to... sets.

The corridor was a grid of little mouths on either side - rooms dressed like pieces of other lives. A classroom of cartoon letters, a pastel bedroom strung with fairy lights and unicorn posters, a toy doctor's office, a bathroom with no plumbing - a camera mount where a mirror should be.

'Story Time'

'Pool Day'

'Dog Walk'

'Storm The Castle'

Each room was far smaller and dirtier than it had looked through a screen, the paint peeling at the edges where the frame never showed.

I tapped my body-cam.

No equipment left behind, not even a single cable, save for some red X's where tripods would stand. And no crew.

No one. Nothing.

The heart of the beast, hollowed out, save for two scared lures that I lingered behind, fighting every instinct to turn heel and return to the surface, opting for the company of the dead and black stars than *this*.

B5 wasn't marked.

Any fabricated fantasy ended; they stopped pretending now.

A laboratory with a drain, ringed with ancient rust and something darker, sat in the middle of the floor. Two ceiling-mounted monitors hung over empty gurneys, their screens a lazy blonde. Trolleys of instruments stood like sentries, some stained with offensive blotches of garnet, stinking of acid.

Jane's voice threaded through the humming air.

She was on a far wall, kneeling, holding a palm out to the kid in white, who'd turned herself into the corner, gown hitched over raked knees. She didn't react to her.

She'd run out of noise to give.

Overhead, something clicked.

A black glass dome nested in the ceiling, and a little yellow LED winked once at me, as if in recognition.

On another wall, flat screens burned. One showed the stairwell behind me, one cycled through the rooms of B4, and one showed this very room.

Jack worked a nearby terminal; a cut along his cheek had already clotted, a hideous line that glistened in the light. His fingers moved hard across the keys, each clack flicking another camera feed onto the monitor wall, a looping, self-consuming view. He acknowledged me, over his shoulder, and Jane did the same, mortified.

My gaze dragged to the far side of the lab.

A door.

A metal obelisk of reinforced yellow, the colour of hazard tape and rotten teeth, an electronic lock sunk deep into the frame, basking in a status light. The metal around the handle was smudged, smeared, streaked with little, bloody hands - blooming across the surface like flowers

I swallowed.

"The other one-"

"Yeah," Jack said, a little tremor in his voice. "We're not getting it open."

"Not tonight, at least," Jane said, still hovering her palm over the girl, afraid that any touch could shatter her.

Jack stabbed another sequence into the keys, and the main monitor juddered. His and Jane's own bodies ghosted through B4 on a delay like a muzzle-flash.

"Either of you heard from Hann-"

There was a sharp, different click from the terminal - an access approval. The screens went black, then returned, but not with the building feed... something else. A new layout settled: camera placements we hadn't seen, hadn't known, foreign to the map Hannah had studied.

The first image was the courtyard.

A harsh, monochrome view from a high angle, and the three of us frozen in grainy hindsight, cutting through the rain. I watched a delayed version of myself execute men without mercy until the image jumped, skipping frames.

"Hidden feeds," Jack muttered. "This... this isn't security, this is-"

"Audience." I finished, staggering to the screens.

They were filming us on a secondary array.

Jack flicked to the next feed as Jane approached, cradling the silent girl over her shoulder, her other hand gripping a pistol.

The woods came into view: stark trunks, wet bark, the world beyond Carcosa's line. The images rolled as if mounted amidst the treetops, panning slowly, hungrily across the road.

The MOC came into frame... what was left of it.

It lay at an angle off the tarmac, as if a giant had reached down and struck it. The rear hatch was peeled away, burned through, and the driver was barely recognisable. He lay in the mud, his upper body twisted and riddled with holes, limbs at angles that defied his joints, mouth agape.

Hannah's chair was only visible as a shadow amid hanging cables and dangling panels, within the torn throat of the MOC.

No Hannah.

I tasted bile in the back of my throat.

With shaking fingers, Jack changed the feed again.

Walls. Not Carcosa's polished, anonymous corridors, but narrower, recognisable passageways, and office spaces with notice boards studded with curling memos. The motion of the frame suggested a camera mounted on a rolling cart, sifting down hallways it had no right to be.

*Home.*

Our briefing room.

Our canteen.

Our armoury.

Our toilets.

Then the interrogation block slid into view.

Most of the cells were empty.

One was not.

Lenny hung in the centre of his cell, suspended by ropes that cut into his bloated, pale frame. Where tracksuit fabric had once clung, there was only skin: waxy, mottled, filmed with an oily sheen.

His head sagged forward; his face skewed and hauled into an obscene look of pain.

Across his chest, carved into him with a tool not made for precision, ran a message. The letters were jagged and uneven; blood had run freely from each assault, drying in the slack valley of his ribs.

'ACT II'

Written over the canvas of a man who'd believed he was only a watcher.

Jane shot the camera above us, bursting it into fragmented pieces, the girl on her shoulder releasing a strangled half-whimper as if some internal lock had finally given way.

"Rally yourself." She said to me with shaking breaths, tears welling in her eyes. "We're leaving."

"Yeah, no shit!" Jack spat, pounding a fist into the keyboard, his composure just as wavered, before he marched back the way we'd come, offering a final look at the stark, mocking yellow door. Its secrets would remain as such.

The ascent was a blur.

I couldn't get a full breath, my legs moving on training, not choice.

Jack drove us up the stairwells in silence, Jane just behind him with a scrap of white weight over her shoulder, and I brought up the rear, lungs burning, my hands longing for a cross I dared not touch.

We burst back into the reception, and Jack started to speak - some automatic rehash, some half-formed order, the seeds of a plan - but the shot hit him mid-sentence.

His helmet spasmed, split, and he just... dropped. No dramatic exit, just a corpse hitting the tile, spraying blood across the floor. I didn't immediately register what I saw, but then the sound found us, a fiendish crack echoing around the lobby.

They emerged from the edges of the room: men and women in pallid masks, snow-white and expressionless, some with cameras bolted onto their faces. Lenses settled on us with the same calm intent as a barrel.

The lobby exploded.

Glass shattered, plaster coughed dust, and the front desk detonated into splinters as rounds hammered it apart. Jane and I dove behind a support column, the girl on her back didn't make a peep, and I fired without thinking - short, brutal bursts, trying to keep their muzzles down. One masked assailant flopped behind a planter; another shifted his weight to film him as if his death was another line in a script we'd never read.

Jane hurled a flashbang from our foxhole, and then her hand found the back of my vest in a wordless pull to move. A phosphorus explosion of white blinded the room as we broke from cover and ran, dropping three more of them in their dazed scrambling. She went first, and I saw the way some of the masked muzzles hesitated as the small body attached to her crossed their sights like something radioactive - a stamped exemption.

Don't hurt the star.

I followed, boots skidding, sights snapping between targets, my rounds punching into furniture and flesh alike, as we slammed through the doors and out into the rain.

The air hit like a slap. Cold. Real. A contrast to the synthetic sweetness that soaked this place from the start. For those first few seconds, there was no incoming fire - only the thudding of our boots, the drag of our breath, and the hysterical thud of my heart.

At the treeline, more figures gathered, stepping out from between the pines like they were stage curtains. Masks. Dozens of them. They formed a loose crescent under the moonlight, pale faces turned towards us; some carried rifles, aimed idly at the ground, others held cameras and phones - little yellow tally lights staring in anticipation. They didn't engage, they didn't advance, they merely watched us cross the open, their lenses tracking Jane's bowed head, cradling a girl, and the rugged mess I'd devolved into.

For a brief, sickening moment, it felt as if we'd stepped out of one scene and into another - the revelation to the arena.

The MOC waited for us, and when we reached it, their generosity ended, violating the world back into gunfire. The first shot cracked out from the treeline as if some cue had been met. Rounds whipped through the rain, sparking off the MOC's armour, ripping into the ground. Then a bullet found me. The impact hit my side, a massive blunt jab that ripped the air out of my lungs and nearly ended my days. Heat flashed under my plates, unforgiving, as I collapsed into a door. A second hit tore into my shoulder, disarming me, as my body screamed to shut down; to lie still and let it end, ushering myself into that sanctuary in the sky.

Jane's hands found me instead, hauling me into the blood-soaked cab where she and the girl had already sheltered themselves. The MOC lurched as she smacked it into gear, snarling the transmission, as rounds peppered the metal.

My body, stubborn, remembered how to close a door as more rounds splashed over reinforced glass.

The vehicle fishtailed once we hit the wet road, then bit and surged down the mountain, howling out into the night air. I dragged myself up just enough, conscious slipping, to see the rear-mirror - a small army of masks, lined up like an audience at a roadside show.

They didn't chase.

They just watched.

They just recorded.

And my eyes fluttered shut.

\-

I woke to the taste of plastic.

A white ceiling of strip lights, a slow, rhythmic beep at my side.

Rain smeared the window, dragging the blue-red flash of police lights into streaks, and, through them, I could make out the wreck of the MOC buried in what used to be a hospital entrance.

"Don't move," a voice said.

Jane slumped in a chair, still in armour, dried blood spattered her. Her rifle sat beside her, while her hands twiddled nervously with her phone.

"Where's the kid?" I forced out in a broken wheeze, and the sorrowful image of Hannah hit me fast.

"Paediatrics," Jane said. "They got a word out of her - Camilla. Might be her name, might not."

Her phone buzzed, and she glanced down; her face went another shade paler.

"What is it?"

She hesitated before turning the screen.

A bright, bile-yellow banner slid up over whatever she'd been looking at.

Same cadence:

*All tucked in for the night, handsome? House to yourself, private browser at the ready, a wide array of SWAT raids waiting for your morbid curiosity?*

*But what's that, my king - a bodycam is too tame for you?*

*Ah, I get you. You wanna see some heads pop; some divine vigilantism.*

*Well, why didn't you say so? I have just the place.*

*Indulge your fine, like-minded cravings at YELLOW KINGS, the most exquisite site for all your 'oh so special needs'.*

*We don't judge.*

*We don't ask.*

*We only show you exactly what you've been too afraid to peek at.*

*... Just don't tell anyone what you're watching.*

*It would drive them mad.*
