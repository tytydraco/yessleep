I first noticed it on a Monday morning. A smooth gray bump, like the top of a stone head, was poking out of the dirt by the town square’s flagpole. It was featureless except for the faintest suggestion of a human face. 

By lunch, a dozen townsfolk had come to poke and prod it. We figured it was a buried statue—maybe a forgotten historical monument or a weird prank. I brushed off some dirt and felt a thrill of unease. 

The surface was cool, impossibly smooth, with just a hint of a nose and a lipless mouth curved in a slight smile. Harmless enough at a glance, but something about it made my skin crawl.

By the next morning, that stone head had pushed further out of the earth. Now it was the size of a melon, a full head with a neck emerging. The smile was a touch more noticeable, which sent a little chill through me. 

A small crowd gathered again. Some took photos, others just gawked. In a town as quiet as ours, this was the biggest excitement in ages. A couple of the maintenance guys decided to dig it out. 

We watched them jab shovels and even a pickaxe around the statue, but it was like the ground had turned to concrete. Sparks flew; not an inch of soil gave way. They eventually gave up, puzzled and frustrated.

That night, a local kid named Travis disappeared. He’d been goofing around the statue earlier, even whacked it with a baseball bat for laughs when the adults weren’t watching. Now he was just gone. His parents called everyone they knew, the sheriff organized a search, but by dawn on Wednesday there was no trace of him.

On Wednesday the statue stood higher—shoulders coming into view. Its presence felt heavier now. I could swear the smile had grown wider, though with no eyes or brows it was hard to be sure. Whispers around town turned anxious. 

Some folks wanted it destroyed or hauled away, but after seeing the digging crew fail, no one knew what to do. I found myself drawn to the statue that afternoon, standing closer than I had before. In the late-day light, its faint smile almost looked smug. I stepped back, heart pounding with a strange guilt and fear. 

At a hastily called town meeting that evening, Travis’s distraught grandmother yelled that the *“evil statue”* took him. Most people dismissed it as the ravings of a grieving old woman, but I saw more than a few uneasy glances toward the square.

Later that night, I ran into my friend Jenna outside the diner as she was closing up. She looked exhausted and jittery. In a shaky whisper, Jenna told me she’d spotted the statue away from the square—behind the diner by the dumpsters around midnight.

The alley’s security light had caught a glimpse of a smooth, human-like figure. She swore it was the same statue, just… standing there. But when she blinked, it was gone. The sheriff told her it was likely a prankster moving a dummy to scare people. Jenna wasn’t convinced, and hearing her, neither was I. The quiver in her voice and the way her hands shook on her keychain told me she believed what she saw.

I didn’t share my own creeping dread with her then, but I sure felt it. We parted ways, and I headed home under a sky heavy with stars and unease. Sleep didn’t come easy. I kept a light on and the TV muttering in the background to ward off the silence. Sometime after midnight, I finally dozed off on the couch.

I woke to Boomer, my hound, growling at the front door. The clock read just past 3 AM. My mouth went dry as I approached, one hand gripping the baseball bat I keep handy. Peering through the peephole, I had to clamp a hand over my mouth to keep from yelping. 

Standing on my front porch was the statue. It was upright, fully out of the ground, arms at its sides and head tilted slightly as if listening. That blank face with its subtle smile was inches from my door. Through the fisheye lens it looked warped and looming, but I knew what it was. My heart hammered against my ribs.

I didn’t dare open the door. Boomer’s growl had turned into an anxious whine behind me. Summoning courage, I flicked on the porch light and looked again. In that split second I’d looked away, the porch was empty. Only the swing still swayed slightly, as if something had just been there. I didn’t sleep at all after that. I sat with Boomer and my bat until dawn, every creak of the house making my pulse jump.

By Thursday morning, the news hit that Jenna’s younger brother, Connor, had gone missing sometime during the night. I felt sick. 

That made two now—*Travis and Connor*—both gone without a trace after getting too close to the statue. It couldn’t be a coincidence anymore. The whole town was on edge, though publicly most tried to cling to rational explanations. I overheard the deputy telling someone that maybe the boys had run off together or were pulling a prank. But I knew what I had seen on my porch.

Now the sun is dipping low as I write this, and I’m watching the statue from across the street. It’s still there in the town square in broad daylight, half-buried up to its ribs like nothing happened. A few kids ride by on bikes, giving it a wide berth. The adults pretend to ignore it, but their eyes keep flicking over. We all feel it—that unspoken, crawling dread.

No one wants to say it, but this started when the statue appeared. Something is very, very wrong in our town. And a voice in my head won’t stop asking: am I going to be next?
