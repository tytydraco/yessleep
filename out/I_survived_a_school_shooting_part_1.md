July 1st

  


I don’t know what to do. It’s three in the morning and I’m supposed to be up at seven to get ready for work. I’ve spent god knows how long staring at this fucked up picture and trying to figure out a plan. I don’t want to go through this again, I can't, but what choice do I have? The consequences are too harsh to bear. I’m sorry… I’m rambling. I think it’s best we start from the beginning. 

  


May 30th

  


"Mom, I'll be fine," I said as I turned around away from my backpack, "don't worry about me." 



My mom was leaning against the door frame of my bedroom with her arms folded. "I'm your mother, it's my job." 



"You don't get paid for it, therefore, it's not a job." 



"Smart ass." 

 

"I get it from you." 



"True. You're gonna be ok, right?" 



"Yeah, what are you so worried about? It's a senior lock in." 



"I don't know, there's a lot of bad people out there, and you go to school with some of them." 



"Well, the people you're worried about likely won't show up to this, they'll call it lame or some shit and stay home." 



"Good point, but you're going with a friend, right?" 



"Yeah, I'm gonna pick up Elijah on the way," I said as I heard the familiar sound of my phone's ringtone. I grabbed it off my bed and looked at the caller ID, 'Elijah' "speak of the devel," I answered the call and put it on speaker, "what's up?" 



"Hey Michael, you ready?" 



"Just about, got a few more things to pack, I'll be at your place in like, 15-20 minutes." 



"Cool, see you then." 



"See you then, love ya." 



"You're so fucking weird." 



"So are you. You love it. bye." 



"Bye." And he hung up. 



"See," I said to my mom, "nothing to worry about." 



"Be safe, for me?" 



I walked over and gave my mom a big hug, "I will." we let go after a few seconds later, "I gotta finish packing." 



"Ok." And my mom walked away. I zipped up my backpack and threw it over my left shoulder. I said goodbye to my parents and that I would be back tomorrow. "Love you." My mom yelled from the couch. 



"Love you too." And I walked out the front door. I unlocked my car, a 2018 Toyota RAV 4, threw my backpack in the back seat, and got in. I stuck the key in the ignition and turned it, and my car roared to life. I pulled out of my driveway and drove to Elijah's house. 



I arrived at his about five minutes later, and he was waiting on his front porch. I pulled over to the curb and rolled down my passenger side window as he started to get up, "get in, loser, we're going shopping." I yelled out my window. Elijah opened the back door and put his backpack down in the seat, then got in on the passenger side. I rolled up the window as he shut the door. "Ready to go?" 



"Yeah." Elijah says to me. I put the car in drive and pulled out onto the street, making our way to the school. 

  
  


We pulled up in the parking lot of our school at around 8:30 pm. I shut off the car and pulled the key out of the ignition as the two of us opened the doors and got out, shutting both doors behind us. We opened the back doors and grabbed our backpacks out from the backseats, then closed them. I hit the button on my keys to lock the doors and checked both the driver's side door and the back door to make sure they locked, like my dad always did. “So how do you think this will go?” I asked Elijah. 



“Very badly.” 



“Pessimist.”  



“Sup, losers.” we heard from behind us and to the left. Ellie always poked fun at us, but we still like her. 



“Hey, glad you could make it to the shitshow.” Elijah said. 



“Come on, it won’t be that bad.” I said.



“We’ll see.” 



We walked through the front doors and handed our tickets to the lady at the table at the entrance. “Head to the auditorium for the briefing.” the lady said to us. We thanked her and walked to the auditorium. 



We sat down in the sixth row on the right side, placing our backpacks on the floor in between our legs. A few minutes later, principal Peterson came out to speak to us. We all clapped as he came out because we’re all 4 years old in our hearts, and Mr. Peterson put his hands up with a smirk to settle us, and we quieted down. “Good to see you all again. Welcome to the 30th annual senior lock in. I just need to go over a few rules with y’all and then you’re free to do whatever. We do have games and activities for you to do, if you’d like. Number one, No drugs or alcohol of any kind. If you are caught using or in possession of drugs or alcohol, you will be sent home and not be allowed to walk at graduation. There will be no fighting. We are here to celebrate and have a good time, not to give each other black eyes and bloody noses. Offenders will be sent home and not allowed to walk at graduation. And finally, no fornication of any kind.” we all groaned in disgust at that one. “HEY, don’t get mad at me, get mad at the class of 2016 for that one. Violators will be sent home and not be allowed to walk at graduation. Anyway,” he checks his watch, “my watch says that it is currently 9:00 pm, we are closing up shop at 5:00 am. Until then, go off and have a great time, you are dismissed.” 



On that note, we all got up and made our way out of the auditorium. Myself and Elijah went over to this little spot next to the principal offices and the cafeteria. We sat down against the wall as Ellie and another friend of ours, Maverick, sat down with us. We chatted about nonsense for about 30 minutes, laughing and cackling. We stopped for a moment to catch our breaths and calm down, then Maverick spoke, “So are we just gonna sit here and talk shit or are we actually gonna do something?” 



I reached into my backpack and gripped onto the box, “well I don’t know about y’all,” and I pulled out a game of cards against humanity, “but I’d like to play a game.” I said like the puppet from Saw. 



“I’m in.” Maverick said. 



“Oh hell yeah.” Ellie said



“Let’s go.” Elijah said. 



I smiled and placed the box in between the 4 of us and took the lid off, “alright you sorry degenerates, you all know the rules, take your seven white cards, I volunteer to be the card czar first, we shall work clockwise, and let the games begin.” We all grabbed our white answer cards, and I grabbed a black question card and read it, “behold the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse, war, famine, death, and \_\_\_\_.” 



Elijah slammed down a card right away, while Maverick and Ellie looked over their cards for a few seconds, Maverick took a card out of his hand and placed it down, Ellie right behind him. 



I picked up the cards they laid down and shuffled them, then flipped the stack over, “behold the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse, war, famine, death and explosions.” that got a chuckle from Maverick, I knew it was his. “behold the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse, war, famine, death and daddy issues.” That made all of us laugh. “Behold the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse, war, famine, death and shooting a rifle into the air while balls deep in a squealing hog.” We all laughed again. “Arguably the best card in the game.” I said through my laughter. “But daddy issues wins.” Elijah cheered and grabbed the black card. 



We continued like this for about 10-15 minutes when I felt my bowels growl at me. I set my cards down and stood up, “I need to go to the bathroom, keep playing without me.” I said as I started to walk away, taking my backpack with me. Just in case. I looked back and I could have sworn I saw Ellie wink at me. I smiled and snickered a little bit before walking to the bathroom. On my way there, I passed one of the chaperones, there were a surprising amount of them, by the way, like way more than there should be. I passed one who was wearing a puffer jacket, and I saw a little extra puff on his left side.  “Weird.” I said to myself as I made my way to the bathroom. 



I stopped at the one next to the auditorium where we were briefed. I walked in and took the furthest stall from the door. Don’t ask why, I’ve just done it since I was a kid. I pulled my pants down, sat down, and let nature do its thing. I was there for about 2 or 3 minutes when the lights cut out and I heard gunfire and screaming coming from outside the bathroom. 

  
  


That is the first time I have literally had the shit scared out of me. I quickly grabbed some toilet paper and wiped my ass before quickly pulling my pants up and getting up on the toilet seat. The emergency lights came on, glowing a dim red. The door opened a few seconds later and I could hear the heavy footsteps of someone wearing boots. Their steps were slow, methodical, calculated, like he’s not just walking, but looking. Searching. I thought it could be a teacher or another chaperone looking for students to evacuate. They opened the door to the first stall, there’s only two, and I heard a small hum of understanding. It was deep, like that of an older man. I looked at the latch on the door to my stall, seeing that it was locked shut. He turned to mine and tried to push it open, but the lock stopped him. I then heard a loud bang and saw the door shake, assuming he had shoulder checked it. In spite of the fact that the door is made of cheap plastic and the lock and hinge are made of thin, soft metal and cheap screws, the door didn’t break or even crack, it stayed strong. The door shook again with another loud hit, nothing. A third hit, nothing. “Fuck it.” I heard from the other side. All of the sudden I saw a shotgun slide under the door, bounce off the wall, and slide towards the toilet I was squatting on. Without even thinking, I picked up the shotgun, made sure the safety was off, and aimed at the bottom of the door, which had an obviously overweight man with his head and shoulder popping out the other side. “Fuck this.” he said as he crawled back under to the other side and got back up. I could hear him walking away from the stall door. 



I was ready to hear the bathroom door open and close, but then I heard quick footsteps and watched the stall door burst open and smack into the tile wall. I shuffled a little bit and the toilet seat clanked. His head whipped to the noise and saw me, pointing his gun at him. “You’re not gonna shoot me with that thing.” he said with confidence. 



“Try me.” 



He drew his pistol and tried to shoot me, but you can’t outdraw a gun already pulled on you. I pulled the trigger, and a flaming mass left the barrel and hit him in the upper chest and his throat. Dragons breath. He hit the wall and fell to the ground. I still remember the sound of the empty shell hitting the ground. “Holy shit” I said with a shaky voice. 



I stepped off the toilet and walked to the man's body. I leaned the shotgun against the wall, a Benelli m3 for those who care, and started taking the gear off his body. I took his battle belt off of him and put it on around my waist, tightening it to fit me. On the left side were shotgun shells and pistol mags, and on the right was an empty holster. I grabbed the pistol that was in his hand, a Glock 17L, again, for those who care, and inserted it into the holster. I took note of the walkie talkie on the back left side. I looked back at him and the rest of his gear. The bullet proof vest he was wearing was destroyed by the dragon's breath round. I could tell he had patches on his vest, but they were destroyed, say for an “-odey” on his left peck. Yeah, the plate carrier was worthless, but the ballistic helmet he was wearing wasn’t. It was a dev tac ronan helmet with full head protection. I was wearing a black baseball cap backwards with the words “come and take it” with a picture of an AR-15 on it. I took it off, placing it in my backpack, and I put on the helmet before taking a deep breath. I sighed, “you need a shower.” I said into thin air. I turned on the two lights on the sides of the helmet, grabbed my backpack and my new shotgun, and headed for the door. 



I opened the door slowly, letting the barrel of my shotgun leave the bathroom before my body did. There were bodies all over the place. I recognized a few of them. I turned left and headed towards the language hall and principles office. I heard voices coming from the adjacent hall in front of me, and I quickly ducked behind the lockers, turning off the lights on my helmet. I could hear more gunshots in the distance. How many more are there? The red lights went out and the normal lights came back on, dimly though. 



“How many kids do you think are left?” one of them asked. 



“I don’t know, shouldn’t be many, though.” the other said. 



“Copy.” 



“We should check these lanes.” 

  


“Yeah, we should.” the first one said. I could hear him moving in between the lanes of lockers, clearing them one by one. I scooted back a few steps, my finger on the trigger. About 30 seconds after, which felt like an hour, he got to me, holding what looked like a 9mm AR patterned submachine gun. I stood up and pulled the trigger, nothing. Not even a click. “The fuck are you doing?! Lay your weapon down, now!” he must have thought I was one of them. The gear, that’s right. “Put it down, NOW!” I changed my grip so that all 4 of my fingers were wrapped around the grip and hit the guy in the face with the stock of my shotgun. He fell to the ground, landing on his back. I racked the pump on my shotgun and fired a round into his helmet. The ballistic panels on these helmets are able to stop shotgun rounds, but the lenses aren’t. The shot bursts through them, killing him. 



I quickly looked and pointed my weapon at the other individual he was with, chambering a new round. He pointed his gun at me, what appeared to be a 1911 pistol. I’m not playing games at this point and I yelled, “put your weapon down and walk away.” 



“Yeah, I’m not going to do that.” he said, doing a press check on his pistol, making sure a round was loaded. 



“I don’t negotiate with terrorists. Drop your weapon and leave.” 



“Make me.” 



I didn’t hesitate, I pulled the trigger and fired another flaming mass at him. I pumped the shotgun, chambering a new round and ejecting the old one. I forgot to mention something, the Benelli m3 is a convertible shotgun, meaning it can be converted from a pump action function to a semi automatic function with a grip of a switch on the front of the hand guard. I converted it to semi auto and walked away from the two dead men. “You asked for it.” 



I passed the office doors and I went to enter to see if there was anybody hiding there, but the doors were locked, so I couldn’t get in. I turned around to start walking down the adjacent hallway when I heard a loud sound that sounded like something big and heavy being slammed into the lockers. I ran to where the sound came from, it seemed to be from the science center, and I saw one of the terrorists and another man, looked like one of the chaperones, fighting over something in between them. I couldn’t tell what it was, but the gunshot made that mystery very clear. The man dropped to the ground holding his stomach. 



I raised my shotgun and yelled, “hey asshole!” He looked up at me and I fired before he could react, dropping him to the ground. 



I slung my shotgun over my left shoulder and knelt down next to the man who got shot, it was my science teacher, Mr. Conway. He started pushing himself away, “get the hell away from me.” 



“Nonono, Mr. Conway…” I took off my helmet, “... it’s me, Michael.” 



He had a look of shock on his face, clenching his stomach, “please don't tell me you’re with them.” 



“No, just killed one and took his gear. I’m just trying to save lives in here, starting with you.” I said as I got my arm under him and helped him up, and guided him to the labs and the little work area. I hid Mr. Conway under this bar-like counter, “ok. I’m going to go and look for help, you hold out here.” 



“Ok.” he said and I took off. I grabbed my helmet off the ground and ran for the doors next to the office while putting it back on my head. I ran to the doors and pushed on the bar to open it, before slamming my face into the glass. I stumbled back and fell to the ground. I got up and pushed on the door again, hearing a strange jingle. I look down and see a heavy duty chain and military grade padlock on the door. I stepped back and fired a round out of my shotgun, it didn’t do anything. Due to a few other shootings that happened a few years ago, my school invested in some bullet proof glass doors. I turned around, reloaded my shotgun using a quadload technique, and checked the main entrance doors, padlocked. I ran to the doors near where the bathroom I was in earlier. I slowed down due to exhaustion and passed the doors to the cafeteria. 



I reached the bathrooms when I was suddenly tackled into the side into a display case, smashing the glass and the both of us falling to the ground. The man got up before I could and I pointed my shotgun at him, but he grabbed it and pulled it out of my hands and tossed it to the side. He pointed a short barreled AK at me, what looked like an AKs-74u to me, and was about to pull the trigger, but I grabbed the rifle with my left hand, his left arm with my right, pressed my foot against his chest and threw him over me. He flew a few feet, and I still had his rifle. I got a proper grip and fired a few bursts from the prone as he ran away and ducked behind a wall to the right, right next to the auditorium doors. That brief feels so long ago. 



I got up, picked up my shotgun, slinging it over my left shoulder, and slowly walked to where he was so as to not let my footsteps be heard. I quickly moved to see around the corner, my weapon aimed where he would be, but no one was there. Confused, I slowly walked forward, keeping my weapon up. I had my eyes on the door into the auditorium, then the top of the rifle was smacked by a light brown looking mass and fell to the ground. The man who tackled me was wielding a 2x2 piece of wood and started swinging it in my direction. He swung twice before I grabbed the wood and ripped it out of his grip. I raised it and swung it down on him. He blocked it with his forearms in a cross-like guard and fell to the ground. I tossed the wood to the ground. “My turn.” I said as I grabbed the back of his shirt, dragged him a few feet, and threw him into another display case, shattering it. I picked him up and pinned him to the wall. I punched him 3 times in the face. Left hook, right hook, left hook, before I drew my Glock and pressed it into his forehead. 



He looked angry, and there was something weird about him that was setting off alarm bells in my head. “DO IT!” he yelled. “DO IT YOU FUCKING PUSSY!” and that’s when it occurred to me. He was slightly shorter than me, he had long-ish blue hair tied back in a ponytail, and his voice was slightly deeper than mine with a northern accent. 



I stepped back, dropping my gun down to dangle on my side, “Elijah?” 



He got a look of horror on his face, “h-hhow do you know my name?” 



I holstered my pistol and took off my helmet, “well, it would be weird if your best friend didn’t know your name.” 



Elijah stared at me for a few seconds with a look of confusion now. “Michael?” he rubbed the right side of his face with his left hand, “you asshole.” 



I tossed the helmet off to the right, “Sorry man, I….” 



“Save it. You’re with these assholes?” 



“What? No.”   



“Dude, you’re wearing the same gear they are and you tried to kill me.”



“Isn’t that exactly what you just did to me?” 



“Well I thought you were one of them.” 



“I did too. And you’re also wearing the same gear. So what, you’re with them too?” 



“Hell no, man, I stole it so I could blend in with them.” 



“And what the hell do you think I’m doing?” 



“Man, fuck you.” he said as he tried to hit me, but I was quicker. I grabbed his arm and threw him behind me, and ran into the opposite wall of the hallway. I took the shotgun off my shoulder and pointed it at him to keep him at bay. He drew his pistol and pointed it at me. Looked like a glock as well. Standard size, maybe a 17. “Is this really how you want to end things?” 



“Stop. ok? I don’t want to do this to you, man. Don’t force my hand.” 



“Don’t force your hand? I won’t need to. You’ll do it anyway.” 



“Why would I?” 



“I’m willing to bet attacking this place was your idea.” 



I looked at him with utter shock and disbelief, “are you fucking ki……” 



“Ladies, ladies…” we heard from down the hall a bit. We both turned and pointed our weapons in that direction to see 5 armed men in a V like formation. “There’s no need to argue. Let’s just figure things out.”
