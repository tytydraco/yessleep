It was an afternoon, I was sleep deprived, and been having a hard time sleeping. I always tune into Youtube to fall asleep faster. As I drift to sleep while Youtube is on Autoplay, a dream sequence begins. It was a pretty standard dream, nothing really happens. If I can describe it, I was dreaming about helping delivering food to a local outreach.

  
Then it happened.

  
There was a Holy Mass, where a lot of priests were presiding it. A priest was in a middle of a homily when suddenly, another priest was yelling frantically. It was unknown on why he was screaming. It was an audible, loud, and irritating scream. As if he was being dragged down. A priest mentions that it's a sign, where they are being summoned by God. It was weird, but then it got ominous. The priest started yelling 

  
***"WHO ARE YOU?"***

  
That is when I started to shiver. It felt different, it felt cold. I felt like I was choking. The priest's hands were up high, while still yelling those 3 words. I couldn't understand why it was happening. Then I saw my mom, holding my hand. She was as terrified as I am. When we realize that something was already out of hand, we began praying. We began praying "Hail Mary" as fast as we can. As she holds my hands tightly, she gripped my hand tighter, and tighter, and tighter, when I saw her face

  
Her eyes were bleeding

  
She was crying blood. I tried to get away, I tried to let go, but I couldn't. The air suddenly became too thick to breathe, I looked around on my surroundings, the priest is still yelling, everyone's praying, but what terrified me the most was my mother crying blood with blood-shot eyes. I began to tremble, I began to tear up. It was already beyond my comprehension. It felt too real, it felt too vivid. I was already short of breath. I was about to give into the atmosphere, then

  
I heard a high pitch noise

  
The noise was irritating, but it was a blessing. It felt like I was in control when I heard the noise. That jolted me to wake up, and gave me time to assess, gave me time to breathe, gave me time to regain consciousness. That is when I realize that I woke up from a nightmare. I was still having difficulty in breathing.

  
When I looked at my phone, it was 8:27PM. And there was a video playing, a Youtuber playing a horror game. That is when I realized, I forgot that Youtube was still playing on the background.  
I was so frightened, I frantically got up from my bed the moment I recuperated, ran to my kitchen. I then grabbed a handful of salt, and placed it on my doors. I was still breathing heavily after that. I couldn’t wrap my head around it.

  
I swear, I will never put Youtube on Autoplay again, especially if the videos goes totally random: From YLYL compilation, to a full-blown horror theme. It influences your dream somehow. It’s was so dumb, yet so terrifying…
