As an apprentice to the renowned scientist, Dr. Williams, I had the honor of assisting in one of the greatest discoveries in human history. It all began when we uncovered an ancient scroll that seemed to tell the tale of the human race. The scroll was written in a language that none of us could understand, but after many long weeks of tireless work, we were able to decipher its secrets.

The scroll was a chronicle of the events that had shaped the course of human history. It told of wars, plagues, and natural disasters that had wiped out entire civilizations. It spoke of ancient technologies that had been lost to time and of great heroes who had risen to save their people from certain doom.

But as we delved deeper into the scroll, we began to realize that it was not simply a historical record. It was a prophecy, and one that foretold of a horrific event that would occur in the year 2024.

As we continued to read, the scroll spoke of a great disaster that would befall the Earth. It spoke of a solar flare that would rip apart the very fabric of our atmosphere, exposing the planet to the full fury of the sun. The scroll described in graphic detail how the flare would tear apart the human form, atom by atom, leaving nothing but a bloody mess in its wake.

At first, we were all skeptical of the scroll's predictions. But as Dr. Williams continued to read, we began to see a change in him. He became obsessed with the scroll, spending every waking moment pouring over its pages. He would mutter to himself, scribbling notes in a frenzy, his eyes wide and unblinking.

And then, one day, it happened. I was working in the lab when I heard Dr. Williams scream. I rushed to his side, only to find him writhing in agony on the floor. His eyes had been clawed out, blood streaming from the empty sockets.

I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was like something out of a horror movie. And then I remembered the scroll, and the prophecy of the solar flare. Was it possible that Dr. Williams had read something so horrifying that it had driven him to madness?

In the days that followed, I continued to study the scroll, trying to piece together the events that had led up to the solar flare of 2024. I read of wars and plagues, of natural disasters and man-made catastrophes. Each event was bloodier and more gruesome than the last, as if the scroll was trying to warn us of the horrors to come.

I read of the Black Death, and how it had wiped out a third of Europe's population in the 14th century. I read of the Spanish flu, which had killed tens of millions in the early 20th century. And I read of the great wars, and the atomic bombs that had been dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

But none of these events could compare to the horror that was to come in 2024. The solar flare would be the ultimate extinction event, wiping out all life on Earth in a single, bloody instant.

As I write this, I can hear the panic growing in the outside world, the sky has turned a blood red as the suns glowing raise inches closer to earth, the ocean boiled away days ago, people are dying in the streets, I can feel it; my cells melting away, ripping apart by the heat of the suns deadly rays
