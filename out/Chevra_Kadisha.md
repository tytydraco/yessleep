In the Jewish faith the deceased are handled with the utmost care. It is against tradition and generally considered forbidden to embalm the body, or to cremate the remains. Abstaining from the use of embalming is thought to protect the integrity of the body of the deceased, and to hasten the transition of the soul to the afterlife. To further aid in this goal, bodies are supposed to be buried without a coffin, with only a white linen wrap as cover. All of this is supposed to take place as soon after death as possible, and is handled by a member of the _Chevra Kadisha_, the Jewish burial society. 

I joined the _Chevra Kadisha_ a year ago. It is considered a great honor and a solemn responsibility to care for the deceased, a point my employers at Sholom Ephraim Funeral Home impressed upon me. To prepare a person for burial, you must first wash their body. This process is known as _tahara_, and you must recite a psalm for each part of the body you wash. A second washing takes place, then the body is dried and dressed in the _tachrichim_, a linen garment. Some families decide to dress the deceased in fancier clothes, but according to tradition this is not necessary. Once the body is prepared, it must be guarded until burial. This act, _shmira_, is meant to protect the body from those who would do it harm. It is also to help prepare the deceased’s soul for a transition to the afterlife. The _shomer_, the guardsman/woman, must recite psalms or prayers over the deceased until the time comes for them to be buried.

Normally, a body is buried within 3 days. As such, the _shmira_ for each person is short. Our Jon Doe, however, has remained unburied for almost a month. In late April, we received a call that a man had been found unresponsive on the side of Route 11. He was declared dead at the scene, and efforts were made to find his next of kin. No identification could be found on him. In fact, the only item on the man besides his clothes was a small, crumpled piece of paper. A short sentence in Hebrew was inscribed, and after using google translate, the detectives were able to ascertain the meaning of the words. It was part of the Mourner’s Kaddish, a prayer said by mourners to honor their dead. No leads could be found regarding the identity of the man or how he ended up collapsed on the side of a rural country road. Two weeks after being found, the man (who we call Jon Doe) was delivered to Sholom Ephraim Funeral Home. 

Autopsies are a controversial subject in Judaism as they ruin the integrity of the body prior to burial. If an autopsy must take place, then all body parts must be retained. The dumbass medical examiner did a hack job at an autopsy and as such, multiple parts of Jon Doe were missing. Rabbi Schectman was furious at the lack of reverence shown and went to curse out the medical examiner and retrieve the missing body parts. I was left with the task of preparing the body. The rabbi’s anger was not misplaced; Jon Doe was missing 3 toes on his left foot, his right thumb, and a large chunk of his ribcage. I set about washing the body and wrapping him in linen. Then, my watch began.

The first week was uneventful. We took shifts watching over Jon Doe, saying prayers as we sat in the expansive walk-in freezer. The second week we started hearing the voices. At first, we thought it was the hiss of the freezer’s compressor. The words were unintelligible. But slowly, we could make out what was being said. The most common phrases were “I cannot rest”, followed by “Why has nobody come for me?”. At first it was terrifying-the dead are not supposed to speak. In time we came to be comforted by the voices. It let us know that the man’s soul was still with his body, and had not become lost. We did not converse with the dead. We listened. We tried to understand how we could help. Earlier this week, the voices stopped. 

We convened a meeting on Monday to discuss what to do with Jon Doe. It was agreed that we could not wait much longer before burying him, lest we risk his soul being lost. The voices stopping amplified that concern. We decided that if he was not claimed by Sunday (today), we would bury him ourselves. I took the last night shift for _shmira_. A few minutes ago, Jon Doe twitched.

I thought my eyes were failing me. There’s no way that a corpse, especially one as gone as he, could be moving. I tried to convince myself that I was hallucinating. After all, I had not slept for about 36 hours at that point. But, then he sat upright. His head turned, and with his filmy, dead eyes, he looked directly at me. I immediately thought of _Dawn of the Dead_, _The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue_, or any other number of zombie films. What could I do? Sure, I could go for the head, but then I’d be further desecrating my body. That would be dereliction of my duty as _shomer_. I needed to call the rabbi and ask him what to do. Under normal circumstances, you are to wait until you are relieved to end your watch. This, however, was anything but normal. I slowly got up from my chair and inched my way to the freezer door. Jon Doe watched me the whole time. 

I exited the freezer and made my way over to the basement office. I picked up the phone and began to dial Rabbi Schectman. He picked up the phone and I began to tell him what happened. He was incredulous, but decided to come over and see for himself. I thanked him and hung up the phone. When I returned to the main room, I noticed the freezer door was open. I heard a shuffling noise, then felt something strike the back of my head.

Rabbi Schectman shook me awake. His face was pallid, as if he had seen a ghost. After getting me to my feet, the pale rabbi recounted what he saw. As he was driving up to the funeral home, he noticed a figure stumbling out of the front doors. Thinking it was me, he parked and came over to scold me for leaving my post. As he drew closer, his ire was swapped with horror. Jon Doe was walking away from the funeral home and into the woods. Fearing the worst, Rabbi Schectman ran inside looking for me. He found me slumped unconscious on the floor with a big, bloody spot on the back of my head. 911 was called, and a paramedic was dispatched to check me out. I was rushed away to the hospital and evaluated by a doctor. The diagnosis was a concussion and a fractured skull. Whatever hit me, hit me hard. I knew what (or who) hit me, but I could not bring myself to tell the doctor or the police that later interviewed me. Rabbi Schectman and I agreed to fabricate a story about a burglary, and that my attack was the criminal putting me out of commission so that he could steal the contents of our safe. 

I was discharged after about 5 hours. We scoured the forest surrounding the funeral home for hours, but could find no trace of Jon Doe. He was nowhere to be found. His soul could not be put to rest. Jon Doe, wherever you are, I hope you find peace.
