Last week, I took a drive out to the Oregon coast to honor the memory of my late sister. She passed away when we were kids, and every year on the anniversary of her death my parents and I head out to the beach to release lilies into the sea. This was the first year my aging parents couldn’t make it. So it was up to me to keep up the tradition, solo.

I left the city at sunrise, with the aim of arriving at the beach by 10:37am. It was important for me to arrive on time, as we always released the flowers on the exact minute of her passing. This was the time, my mom used to tell me, when the veil between our world and hers was thinnest. I don’t know if that’s true, but over the years I’ve come to believe it is. Something unusual always happens on those mornings, but never anything as unusual as what I’m about to tell you.

I was deep into logging country when I needed to stop. Not on account of the truck, mind you. My ‘98 Ford Ranger was holding up decently on the slick roads, thankfully. It’s one of those compact pickups they don’t make anymore, white with blue trim and a bench seat. A little rust around the wheel wells, but mechanically sound. But I’d downed my thermos of instant coffee too fast and desperately needed to take a leak.

Up there in the Tillamook Forest, the highway follows the winding Wilson River, and on cold, rainy mornings, you don’t want to risk pulling over to the shoulder. A logging truck could take you out in a snap. Squinting through my fogged up windshield, I turned off the highway, towards a campsite I’d once visited, with one of those nice state-park bathrooms with flush toilets. But as I navigated down that backroad, I couldn't find the campground. I drove another mile or so, until the asphalt became gravel, and finally decided to turn around. That’s when I came upon the abandoned school.

The parking lot was littered with discarded beer bottles and plastic bags and an inordinate number of surgical gloves. A biohazard symbol had been spray-painted across the school’s welcome sign. I wasn’t sure if it was an official warning or the artwork of some bored teen. I figured I’d take my chances. Better to use the bathroom here than stand outside in the nearly freezing rain.

The entrance wasn’t even locked. I removed the caution tape and stepped into the school, where I was greeted by a mural of a red tree vole with its little fist in the air. Such a silly mascot. “Hello?” I called out, as if I expected the rodent to answer back. My voice sounded more uncertain than I expected. When I was younger, I didn't love high school. My sister passed away when she was a senior and I was a freshman. My grades tanked because I couldn’t imagine graduating before her. But somehow I found a way to move on, even though it seemed impossible then.

Roaming through the hallways, I was a little spooked that nothing had been cleared out. It was like everyone had vanished. In one classroom, a quote from Othello was still scrawled on the chalkboard (“Some bloody passion shakes your very frame: These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope, They do not point on me.”); in another, bunsen burners and test tubes were all lined up neatly on the tables. I walked on, in search of the bathroom, passing an old soda machine and a case full of dusty trophies topped with tiny wrestlers and football players. 

I froze when I came across the Biology classroom. On each table lay what appeared to be fetal pigs vacuum-sealed in clear plastic. The hallway reeked of formaldehyde, and my throat began to itch. I started coughing, which got me wondering about what else was swirling around in that stale air. Maybe the biohazard signs weren’t artwork, after all. I stepped back outside before anything else could work its way into my system.

Outside, I took a leak behind a storage trailer, out of the wind. Then I headed back to my truck. That’s when I spotted them: two teenagers, a boy and a girl, staring at me from inside the school. They pushed up a window, climbed outside, and hurried towards me.

The girl was tall and wispy, with sandy brown hair. She was older than the boy, who was maybe thirteen or fourteen. He looked dazed, almost strung out.

The girl spun the silver bracelet on her wrist. “Could you give us a ride?” she asked.

“Where are you headed?”

The girl looked back at the school. “I need to get to my aunt's boat. It’s in Netarts.”

I don’t make a habit of picking up hitchhikers, but I couldn’t see what harm it would be to give these siblings a lift. “That’s on my way,” I told them. "I'm parked over there." I pointed to my truck.

The teens followed me back to the parking lot.

“What is this place anyway?” I asked.

The girl cocked her pierced eyebrow. “Isn’t that obvious? It’s a school.”

“I mean, what happened here? It’s like everyone disappeared.”

The boy was growing agitated. The girl took his hand. “It was an unplanned closure,” she said. “Some bad things happened here”

“What kind of bad things?”

She looked back at the school again. “It’s a lot to explain. I can tell you on the drive.”

She hurried to the passenger side door, stepping up into the truck and coaxing the boy inside. He seemed not so much reluctant as confused.

I hopped back into the driver’s seat and started the engine. “What were you doing at that school anyway?”

“I had to get him,” the girl said. “He’s my brother.”

“Okay, so what was he doing there?”

The boy started to breathe heavily.

“Can we just go?” the girl asked.

“Are you okay?” I asked the boy. “You don’t sound great.”

“He’s fine,” the girl said. “Can you please drive?”

“Can he talk?” I asked. I leaned over to make eye contact with the boy. “You’re not high, are you? I don’t tolerate drugs. Addiction runs in my family and well–”

“Please, can you drive?” the girl pleaded.

In my rearview, I spotted a man in a gas mask and a white lab coat coming out of the school. He was holding one of those vacuum-sealed fetal pigs in a plastic bag and waving at me with his other hand. “Who is that?” I asked. “And why the hell is he dressed like that?”

As soon as the boy spotted him, he let out this terrified yelp like nothing I’ve ever heard before. I wanted nothing to do with the man after that.

“Drive!” the girl shouted.

I took off for the highway, spraying gravel behind me.

It was at this point that I started to get a little anxious. I had two minors in my truck, and I’d taken them away from whoever that adult was back at the school. But I remembered what Lily–that’s my late sister, hence why we toss lilies out to sea–always told me: "Trust your gut, Restus." And my gut was definitely telling me that these teens were safer in my truck than they were back at that school, with that man. “Did he hurt you?” I asked, merging back onto the highway.

“Not exactly,” the girl said.

“He's not cooking up drugs in that school, is he? Don't tell me you owe him money.”

“It's nothing like that," the girl said. "He’s a teacher. Well, he used to be, back when the school was still a school. He was the one supervising my brother when…” She hesitated, not sure how to phrase it. “When his accident happened.”

I glanced over at the boy, who was staring down at his Converses. “What happened to you?” I asked him.

“He’s still trying to figure that out,” the girl said.

“Can you let him answer?” I asked. “I just want to know he feels safe.”

“Safe?” the girl barked out. “He should be dead. No way is he going to feel safe. But that’s why I’m here.” She locked eyes with her brother. “I’m his sister, and I’m going to help him.”

As endearing as it was to see this girl protect her brother, I still needed to hear something from him.  “I can’t drive around a couple of minors without knowing I have their consent,” I said.

“You can’t abandon a couple of minors who are in danger, either,” the girl shot back.

“That’s the problem,” I said. “I need to know what you’re in danger *of*.”

The boy began to wail.

The girl rubbed his back. “Let’s practice deep breaths,” she said. She inhaled deep, then let it out. They did this a few times together, and I joined in. It calmed all of us down.“Do you mind if we just take a few minutes?” the girl asked. “Looking out the window might help him get his bearings.“

"Okay,” I said.

And so we drove west, through the Coast Range, in silence. The boy was glued to the window, looking out at the verdant Pacific Northwest landscape as if it were his first time seeing Douglas firs, or rain for that matter. We passed bait shops and shuttered fruit stands and fishermen’s pickups parked on the shoulder. After a while, the boy finally spoke. “Oregon,” he said, softly.

“You remember?” the girl asked, running a hand through his wavy brown hair.

The boy slammed his palm against the passenger window. "Stop!" he shouted.

I pulled to the shoulder and the boy darted out of the truck, towards the riverbank.

“Be straight with me,” I told the girl. “Is he on something?”

“He remembers,” the girl said, hopping out to chase after her brother.

I thought about washing my hands of the situation right then. It would have been easy to leave them there. But I was moved by the girl’s dedication to her brother. I wish I would’ve had the same with Lily. I guess I did, for a while. Before her addiction. Before she left this world and everyone in it. I jumped out of the truck and followed the girl down to the riverbank.

When I caught up, the boy was standing at the edge of the river. Nobody else was there, not even fishermen. The boy was staring at a particular spot in the water as if he expected some kind of beast to come splashing out.

“This is where it happened,” the girl said.

“Where what happened?” I asked.

“He drowned here,” she said.

I’d grown up with a kid who drowned but didn’t die. He had some learning issues in school but otherwise was fine. Maybe this boy got it worse. “How old were you?” I asked the boy.

“He was the same age he is today,” the girl said.

“So this happened recently?” I asked.

“No, it happened three years ago,” the girl said.

I shot the girl a look. “Explain to me how that math works."

But the girl had lost interest in the conversation. She was comforting the boy, who was still staring at that spot in the river and crying quietly.

I gently set my hand on the boy’s shoulder. This startled him, but he didn’t run. “It’s cold out here. Why don’t we get back on the road?”

“That’s a good idea,” the girl said. She took the boy’s hand. “We need to get to Aunt Fern's boat, remember?”

My tank was too low to make it all the way to Netarts, so I pulled over for gas at Lattes & Lures. The bait shop slash coffee shop has a single gas pump, one of those old-fashioned ones that takes forever. About halfway into filling my tank, a beige Volkswagen camper van headed west pulled an erratic U-turn and nearly collided with a logging truck. The truck’s horn bellowed as the camper van screeched into the parking lot. The boy screamed. The girl pulled him down to the floor of the cab. "That's him," the girl shouted. 

I shoved the gas pump back in its holster, jumped in the truck, and peeled out without paying.

Back on the highway, pushing 90mph, even the girl was hyperventilating. “Take deep breaths,” I reminded her, checking my rearview for the van. We all breathed in deep together, then exhaled. She placed her hand on the boy’s knee to stop it from shaking. “He’s definitely in shock,” she said. “What do you do for someone in shock?”

“Elevate his legs. Just prop them up there on the dash.” I swept away the hawk feathers and the bouquet of lilies I’d stashed up there, then took off my denim jacket so the boy could use it as a blanket. After a few minutes, when we didn't see the van behind us, we all started to calm down enough to talk again. 

“Look,” I said. “I’ll take you to the coast, but you need to tell me what’s happening. This feels like a situation where I might get a call from the police in a few days asking what I know about two teen runaways. Who is that guy?”

She clasped her hands together. “If I tell you what happened, will you promise to not treat me like some crazy teenager who doesn’t know what she’s talking about? Because that’s basically what every adult’s told me for the past three years. Nobody listens.”

I remembered how adults treated me after Lily died. Nobody wanted to listen. They all encouraged me to think about other things, to try out for the baseball team, maybe join some clubs, anything to take my mind off of her. “I’ll listen,” I said.

“And you won’t narc on us? Because if you do, we won’t have enough time to get away from him.”

“I won’t narc. I don’t even know your names.”

The girl took a deep breath. “Okay, so that guy is the old science teacher. He was the one responsible for watching my brother and his classmates on a field trip a few years ago. He told them they could swim in the river, but the current was too swift that day, and my brother and two of his classmates drowned to death. The teacher’s been holed up in that school all guilt-ridden ever since. Word got out that he wanted to figure out how to revive the kids he lost. Everyone assumed it was just a rumor, but I was convinced it wasn’t. He would stay after school, late into the night, to run his experiments. One night, he ended up releasing toxic chemicals into the air. That’s why he wears that mask. Obviously, that was enough for the state to shut down the school indefinitely. Then, not long after, the graves were dug up in the cemetery.”

“The cops didn’t arrest him?”

“There was no proof he’d done anything wrong. The exhumed bodies were never found, and there was no evidence that traced the crime back to the teacher. His experiments were determined to be nothing more than mishaps in a high-school chemistry lab. And honestly, most people just wanted to move on from the drownings. They didn’t want that negative energy in their lives anymore. But I’d lost my brother, and I was determined to keep an eye on that dude. For all his creepiness, they say he’s brilliant. Apparently the former head chemist at Monsanto with an MD to boot. If anyone could do it, it was him.” She was biting her nails. “He was practicing on pigs. Did you see the pigs?”

“I did see the pigs,” I said.

“I watched him revive one last year. That’s when I knew he’d do it. I was excited at first. Obviously I missed my brother and wanted him back. But now that it’s happened, I just don’t know.” She turned away from her sleeping brother and whispered to me. “It doesn’t seem right, does it? I mean, look at him. He’s terrified. He literally died. That’s like THE traumatic event. You don’t want to come back from that, do you?”

I’d promised not to question her, but I had so many questions. Still, I tried to keep an even keel. “I imagine it would be difficult,” I said. “Why don’t we take him back to your parents? They should know about this, don’t you think?”

“We can’t,” she said. “My parents have only now started to come out of their grieving. I can’t imagine how much it’d fuck with them to see him now, all alive and shit.”

I admit I felt a little ridiculous having this conversation. I’d decided to go along with what the girl had told me, as absurd as it was. I mean, what choice did I have? If I accused her of lying and dropped them off on the side of the road, the teacher would find them, and I was pretty sure he was bad news, whether or not what the girl told me was true. “Why don’t you confront the teacher?” I asked.

“Because he’s not right in the head,” the girl said. “He’s fucking creepy. Besides, I don’t know what the legalities are around resurrecting people, but I imagine he doesn’t want anyone to know he actually did it. Because something tells me they wouldn’t just let him do it again.”

“You think he’ll actually do it again?”

“He’ll revive the other two, yes. He’s doing this to get rid of his guilt, but he hasn’t thought through the consequences. You can’t just hit Undo on something like this.”

“So how do you stop him?” My throat was a little scratchy.

“I have no idea. That’s not really my concern right now.” She squeezed her brother’s knee. “He’s my concern. I want to get him to a safe place to see what he wants to do next. Can you imagine how you’d feel if you were dead, then alive again?” She thought for a minute. “Wait, why don't you report him?”

When I pictured walking into a police station and claiming that a man resurrected a teenage boy, I couldn't see them jumping on the case right away. Instead, I imagined them sending me to a mental health professional. “How exactly do you see that working?”

“Give us enough time to flee, then tell them.”

“But I have no proof.”

“Right,” she said, biting her bottom lip. “Why don’t you call me in a few days, after Card’s had time to adjust. We’ll figure something out.”

“Who’s Card?”

“Me,” the boy said. “I’m Card.”

“Good to meet you, Card. I’m Restus.” I waited for the girl to tell me her name, but she didn’t. “Is all of this true, Card?” I asked.

He nodded.

The girl found a pen and wrote a phone number on the inside of my right arm. “That’s my aunt's number.”

“You don’t have a cell?”

“I tossed it. I don’t want anyone to track us.”

We were coming down into the town of Tillamook, and the boy was growing agitated again.

The girl looked behind her. “That’s him.”

She and Card crouched down. 

I cut through a side street, trying to lose the van. “Does he know where you’re headed?” I asked.

“I have no idea what he knows,” she said.

I drove as fast as I could. I couldn't stop thinking about what would happen if I got pulled over. Was I saving these teens from some demented scientist? Or had I essentially kidnapped the kids? What if none of what the girl told me was true and the guy chasing us was their father, concerned for his kids' well-being? Thankfully, I didn't get pulled over, and the old camper van was too slow to stand a chance at beating us to Netarts. By the time we reached the boat ramp, we must have been a good fifteen minutes ahead of the teacher.

I killed the engine and took out a few twenties from my wallet. “It’s not much, but hopefully it helps.” The girl took the money. Then I grabbed the lilies from the dash and looked around at the boats parked in the lot, hitched to pickups. I was expecting a harbor, with boats ready to go. “Is your aunt supposed to meet you here?” I asked.

“She’ll be here any minute, I’m sure,” the girl said, looking out at the water anxiously. “She has a house up the coast. It’s impossible to reach by car.” She turned to Card. “Do you remember her house? It’s safe. She’ll pick us up and take us there. Then we’ll have time to figure everything out.” She was reassuring herself just as much as she was reassuring Card.

I held the bouquet of lilies up to my nose and sniffed. It was 10:35am. I only had a couple minutes. The Netarts boat ramp wasn’t my ideal spot to honor my late sister, but it would have to do. “I’ve got to attend to something,” I told the teens, holding up the bouquet. “Keep low, okay?”

I walked out to the end of the boat ramp and stared at a swirl of oil in the water, lapping at my boots. Lily had been gone for over forty years, and I still missed her every day. That never changed, my missing her. But the missing took on new shapes. I missed her on birthdays and holidays, of course, but I missed her most in the smallest, most unexpected moments, like when I stayed in motels with waffle makers at the breakfast buffet. I’d imagine her tearing apart her waffle, square by square, and applying a dollop of syrup to each individual square. She’d eat the whole damn waffle that way. But did I really wish for her to return to this world? Of course not. Her life was short, but it was complete. I couldn’t imagine the trauma of that kind of re-entry. I tossed the lilies into the oily sea.

When I turned back around, my truck was gone.

The truck and the teens.

The camper van pulled in and slowly circled the lot. The driver wore a white lab coat, with a gas mask hanging around his neck. He looked around my age, with dark bags under his eyes. I put my head down and hurried into town, to the bus station, where I bought a ticket on the first coach back to Portland.

That night, when I couldn’t sleep, I tried calling the phone number the girl had given me. Someone picked up but wouldn’t respond. “Hello? Is anyone there? My name is Restus, and my truck was stolen. Hello?” I listened to them breathe into the receiver. “I have information on the whereabouts of your nephew.”

The breathing got heavier.

“Hello?” I said again.

“Jerk!” the woman on the other end spat out. Then she hung up.

I tried again the next morning, but the line was disconnected.

That was a week ago.

Then, this morning, I got a notice from the police that my truck had been found abandoned outside of Santa Fe. I can’t decide whether I should go down there to get it. I do need the vehicle, but if I’m honest, I don’t know if I can handle seeing those teens again. I’ve been telling myself all week that their story was clearly a ploy, that all they wanted was to trick me out of a truck, to go on some joyride to the desert. But I don’t know. I’ve always been someone who believes that there’s invisible forces out there, spooky shit we aren’t always able to comprehend. Hell, a hundred years ago we never imagined blasting ourselves into orbit, but hey, here we are sending William Shatner into space. Who’s to say we can’t resurrect the dead?

The last thing I should mention, and this might be entirely psychosomatic, is that my throat is still sore from whatever I inhaled in that abandoned school, and I’ve been having these intense dreams where my sister’s alive again. In the dreams, she’s a painter who lives out in the desert, and she speeds down the dirt roads in a mechanically sound 1998 white Ford Ranger with blue trim and a little rust around the wheel wells. The dash is covered in white and pink lilies.

What do you all think? Should I let this go and move on with my life, or head down to the desert and check on my truck’s condition?
