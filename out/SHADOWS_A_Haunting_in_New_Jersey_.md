Hi, my name is Mark. I am 35 years old, married to Lily, and we recently moved to a new house in New Jersey. At first, everything seemed perfect. The house was beautiful, the neighborhood was quiet, and we were excited about this new chapter in our lives.
But since we moved, I've been having horrible nightmares. At first, I thought it was just the stress of the move or maybe fatigue. But things started to get worse. The nights became terrifying. I would wake up in the middle of the night, unable to move, and see things... things that shouldn't be there.
I need to understand what is happening. I don't know if it's the house, if it's me, or something else. But I will find out. Last night was the worst episode so far, and that's what I'm going to tell you about.
At night, in the bedroom, the atmosphere was gloomy, with only a faint moonlight filtering through the half-open curtains. Lying in bed, my eyes slowly opened, and I looked around, noticing the dimness.

"Lily?" I whispered, my voice full of uncertainty.

The bedroom door was ajar, letting a thin line of light from the hallway in. I turned slightly; my eyes fixed on the door. A female shadow materialized, slowly entering the room.

"Lily..." I thought, trying to calm myself.

I tried to move, but my body didn't respond. The figure approached the bed and I started to feel my heart race. Under the faint light from the hallway, I saw that it was Lily, my wife. She stopped at the foot of the bed, without saying a word.

"I can't move... what's happening?" I thought desperately.

I struggled to move but was completely immobile. I blinked a few times, trying to clear my vision. Suddenly, Lily's figure disappeared into the darkness. I tried to scream, but no sound came out. I was sweating, my eyes wide with fear.

Suddenly, the bedroom door slowly opened again, creaking. The hallway light once again illuminated a female figure entering the room. My despair increased.

"Lily?" I whispered, trembling.

Lily's figure entered the room again, exactly as before. Panic grew in me as I desperately tried to move but remained paralyzed. Then, I heard Lily's voice coming from the hallway.

"Mark? Are you okay?"

I tried to turn my head, but could only move my eyes, seeing the female figure that should be Lily still standing at the foot of the bed looking at me. The hallway light once again illuminated Lily entering, genuinely concerned.

"Mark, you're sweating! What's happening?" she asked.

I felt a wave of relief and confusion. Finally, my body responded and I abruptly sat up in bed, gasping.

"Lily, I... I saw you... twice... I couldn't move," I stammered.

Lily sat beside me, holding my hand. "You must have had a nightmare. I'm here now. It's okay," she said, scared.

I tried to process what had happened. Still haunted, I hugged her, feeling a mix of fear and relief.
