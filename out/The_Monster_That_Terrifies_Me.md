I am being terrorized by a monster.
I live with my aunt Beth, and this all started about two years ago.
I started having blackouts. When I woke up every time, it was there. I’d wake up with braises and unexplainable cuts on my body It terrifies me.
The blackouts happen often, lately, it’s been breaking things in my house. Sometimes I think I see it out of the corner of my eye, 
I turn my head and I miss. Finally, Ive had enough of it, So I moved.
When I got to the new state I finally felt relief. Then it started again. I was getting in the shower and I woke up with the shower
but as I stopd up I felt a sharp pain in my hand… Glass; blood.
The monster was back.
I realized after bandaging my hand, that my mirror was broken. The monster had slammed my hand into the mirror breaking it.
I haven't slept in a while now. I’m scared The monster will plague my dreams. Im scared
that I won't wake up. 
Lesions have been showing on my skin. Now they look like hives, pimples, Scabs. My face is changing, my mouth looks enlarged and my ears have grown. The monster, he's changing me. I think he wants me to look like him, I dread the day when this transformation is completed.

It’s been four days since ive slept. The Monster follows me everywhere now, I can't clean, I can't shower, I cower in my bed. 
My friends are worried but they can't help. He's invisible, but I'm seeing him more now, he looks like me, just not.
I can't explain it. He is manipulating my thoughts now. He says I'm his, I give him blood from my arm. It’s just a little sting, But it puts him to sleep; just for a while I’m able to relax. My friend Jeremy came over today he said I looked like a wreck. 
The monster drove him out though. Before I knew it, I was screaming at him to leave. I couldn’t allow this master to attack him.
The monster wants me to share him with other people. He wants to drain them, He's getting more persuasive and violent lately. I give him more blood each day. Finally, I was so weak, I couldn’t do it anymore.
With my blood pouring From my vein, I told him I’m done, take as much as you want this time. As my eyes were getting drowsy my arm started to feel numb and cold. I asked the monster weakly, “What are you..? 

"Me? " he said almost shocked... “You know my name.. most know me as “

'Depression huh?" the Cop said, “yes..”
A sobbing woman replied. "I never knew it got this bad," Beth said 
"Psychosis, with bipolar episode," The Dr said
"'his psychiatrist said he refused his medication" he paused, "he thought a monster was terrorizing him" God rest his soul.. he's pretty cut up... " one cop murmured,
"Her mama, were, gonna Keep his journal for mental health research if that's Kay, the staff in here ma'am, is pretty hard to stomach " The Or said
"That’s alright,” she said thru sobs. 
“Hey Miss B," Jeremy said
"I tried Miss B I really did," know hun... the Dr. Said you called the police after what he said to you”
"I wish they arrived sooner, I am so sorry Miss Beth" Jeremy paused holding back a whimper "I’ll cover the Funeral expenses” Jeremy’s voice cracked. “Darren was tough, he was a fighter, I can’t imagine the distress that depression put him through..” Silence followed as he headed for the door. 

For a split second, he thought he saw a dark figure, looming over Miss Beth’s head, her head held low in her palms as she sobbed. He shrugged it off and closed the door. 

“Don’t worry Beth.. you’ll see him soon..” The monster said in the faintest whisper... 
At that moment, Miss Beth grabbed a rope and stool, and headed to her nephew's room, with her head hung low.
