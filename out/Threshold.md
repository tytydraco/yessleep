 I don’t sleep well anymore. It’s not the job—though being a criminal investigator for the better part of a decade will wear anyone down. You see things, you file them away, you build a callus over your soul. Or you try to. But some things… some things won’t be filed away. They dig under the callus and fester.

This started four years ago. I was assigned to a case in a wealthy, gated community nestled in the hills of a quiet, affluent town. The kind of place with manicured lawns and three-car garages, where the only sound at night is the hum of a central air unit. A neighbor had finally called in a complaint—a smell, a sickly-sweet rot that had been worsening for days, wafting from a sprawling, modern-style house at the end of a cul-de-sac.

The local PD did the song and dance: knocking, trying to contact the owner, checking with realtors. Nothing. Eventually, they had no choice but to breach the door. What they found inside made seasoned officers vomit on the pristine, imported tile. The call came to me immediately.

My name is Mark. I’m a Criminal Investigative Analyst. My job isn't just to collect evidence; it's to get inside the head of the monster who left it behind. I thought I’d seen the worst humanity had to offer. I was wrong.

The smell hit me first, a physical blow even through the Vicks smeared under my nose. It was the smell of death, yes, but underneath it was something else… metallic, coppery, and a cloying, herbal scent, like burnt sage and spoiled milk. The air was cold, unnaturally so, as if the house’s central air had been cranked to its lowest setting for weeks.

And then I saw the scene in the great room.

My brain, trained for pattern recognition, short-circuited. It refused, for a full ten seconds, to assemble the pieces into a coherent whole.

Nine women. All pregnant.

They were arranged in a perfect circle on the dark hardwood floor, their bodies oriented inward. Each one had been… opened. The fetuses, small and terrible, had been placed beside them. Each tiny form was decapitated, its heart excised. The heads and the hearts were gone. The horror was methodical, a progression. The first woman, according to the later forensics report, had been one month along. The next, two months. Then three. It continued, a grotesque calendar, up to eight months.

In the center of this nightmarish circle was a ninth woman. She was crucified on a large, rough-hewn wooden X, her arms stretched wide, her head lolling on her chest. She was not part of the sequence. The medical examiner would later determine her baby, nearly full-term and viable, had been removed post-mortem. It was gone. Not with the others. Just… gone.

All the women had their throats slit, a deep, final cut. And on each of their foreheads, a symbol had been carved. Not slashed, but carved with painstaking precision.

My eyes, burning from the stench and the sight, were drawn to the floor around the circle. Drawn in what I first assumed was blood were five large, intricate sigils. They formed a pentagram, with each symbol marking a point. My studies in criminology, my dives into the esoteric and the occult for past cases, kicked in. I recognized them. Mammon. Belial. Moloch. Lilith. Paimon. Demons. Entities representing greed, rebellion, child sacrifice, twisted sexuality, and forbidden knowledge. The blood used to draw them was already flaking, turning a dull, rusty brown.

I felt a cold that had nothing to do with the air conditioning seep into my bones. This wasn’t just a murder. This was an invocation.

The investigation was a brick wall. We identified the women. All from old money, powerful families from three different states. When we notified the families, the response was… chilling. Not grief. Not anger. A quiet, resigned acceptance. One father, a man with a voice like gravel and money, told me over the phone, “We knew this was a possibility. My advice, son? Let it go. Focus on something else. You’ll sleep better. Live longer.”

The line went dead. I stood there, the receiver buzzing in my hand, feeling a new kind of dread. It wasn’t the fear of a killer, but the fear of a system, a world, so corrupt that this kind of atrocity could be met with a shrug.

My life began to unravel. I’d always been steady, my mind my sharpest tool. But now, the edges started to blur. I’d be writing a report and hear a faint, wet, tearing sound from the hallway. I’d turn, and nothing would be there. My reflexes slowed. My attention frayed. I was assigned other cases, routine stuff, but my performance was suffering. The images from that house were burned onto the back of my eyelids.

The breaking point came during a traffic stop. A simple, stupid thing. I was off-duty, stuck in traffic. A car backfired. In that split second, my training should have identified the sound. Instead, my degraded mind screamed GUNSHOT. I drew my sidearm. It was a miracle I didn’t fire. The internal investigation cleared me—the other driver was understandably terrified, but unharmed. But the damage was done. My instability was now a matter of record. I was benched.

The pressure was building, a scream trapped in my skull. To clear my head, I decided to run to a friend’s house a few miles away. It was a route through a quiet, suburban part of town, lined with old oaks and split-level homes. I put on my headphones, cranked up the music, and tried to outrun the static in my brain.

But the sounds broke through. A woman’s sob, guttural and pained, woven between the chords of a rock song. The wet, surgical slice of a blade underneath the bassline. I’d rip the headphones out, my heart hammering against my ribs, and be met with nothing but the chirping of birds and the distant hum of a lawnmower.

That’s when I saw him.

He was leaning against a brick retaining wall halfway down the block, a tall, thin figure in a dark, long coat. It was a warm evening, the coat was out of place. But it was his posture—an absolute, preternatural stillness. Most people fidget, shift their weight, check their phone. He was like a statue. As I ran past, I felt a cold spot in the air around him, and a wave of pure, animal fear washed over me. This wasn't the fear of a dangerous man. This was the fear of something that wasn't a man at all.

I picked up my pace, my breath coming in ragged gasps. The feeling of being watched was a physical weight between my shoulder blades. I glanced over my shoulder.

He was there. Behind me. Leaning against a different wall, maybe fifty yards back. Still. Silent. Impossibly, he had moved without making a sound.

I started to run in earnest, my jog becoming a panicked sprint. Every time I dared a look back, or caught a flicker of movement in my peripheral vision, he was there. Leaning against a tree. Slumped in a porch swing on a dark veranda. Always the same distance away, always the same unnerving stillness.

Then I looked forward.

He was standing in the middle of the sidewalk, twenty feet in front of me.

I skidded to a halt. My music cut out abruptly, the headphones emitting a dead, hollow hiss. His face was in shadow, but I saw his mouth. It was stretching into a smile. But it was wrong. It was too wide, splitting his cheeks, distorting the very bone structure of his face. It was a rictus grin that belonged on a skull.

Fear turned to a blinding, primal rage. I don’t know where I found the courage—or the stupidity. I didn't think. I just roared and charged him, intending to tackle him to the ground.

My arms didn’t close around a body. They closed around a dense, vibrating cloud. There was a deafening buzz, and what I had thought was a dark coat dissolved into a swirling, black mass of flies. They erupted outwards, their buzzing filling the silent street, crawling over my face and arms before scattering into the twilight air.

I stood there, alone, gasping, my arms wrapped around nothing.

I finally made it to my friend’s house. I stumbled through his door, drenched in sweat and reeking of panic. He asked if I was okay. I forced a smile, my face muscles aching with the effort. “Fine,” I croaked. “Just pushed it too hard on the run.” I sat on his couch, making small talk, pretending to be sane while my entire reality was cracking apart. I didn’t tell him. How could I?

Soon after, a federal agency with jurisdiction over my department swooped in. They declared me and my team “incompetent” and seized the case. A few months later, I heard through the grapevine it had been given a full carpet-bagging. Closed. Buried.

But the thing that followed me home didn’t get the memo.

The final descent was quiet, insidious. In the dead of night, I’d lie in bed and hear the concrete of my home’s foundation crunch, like something massive was shifting its weight outside my window. The floorboards would vibrate with a low, resonant hum. Just as I’d teeter on the edge of sleep, a scream would tear through the silence—a sound of pure, unadulterated agony—and I’d jolt awake, drenched in sweat, the echo of it dying in my ears.

Then came the lights. Not headlights. These were circles of sickly, phosphorescent green, that would float through my closed blinds and drift across my walls. They’d move in slow, deliberate patterns, tracing the sigils I’d seen carved into those foreheads.

My mind broke. I fell into a depression so deep and dark I couldn’t see a way out. Therapy, medication… nothing worked. The world had become a thin veneer, and the horrific truth of what lurked beneath was bleeding through.

The only thing that finally threw me a rope, the only thing that the buzzing flies and the creeping lights seemed to shy away from, was God. I’m not a preacher. I’m not here to convert anyone. But I am telling you that when I started praying, when I truly, desperately reached for a light greater than those green circles on my wall, the pressure in my house lessened. The sounds faded. The nightmares became less frequent.

It took two years. Two years of prayer, of forcing myself to do good, to help others, to fill the void that the horror had carved out of me. I’m functional now. I’m back on the job. I’m as happy and as tranquil as a man in my line of work can be.

But I still don’t sleep well. Because I know what’s out there. I know what can be invited into this world with blood and belief. And I know that whatever they were trying to summon in that house, a part of it escaped. And it’s still looking for a home.
