All my life, I was given many lessons by my parents. If I didn't follow any of the rules or understand their lessons, I would be given a belt whack.

Their first lesson was teaching me dominance. This was mostly by my dad, as he was the more dominant parent. He'd tell me that women weren't to be believed, as whatever they say is total lies.

Now, some few weeks ago, I'd gotten a girlfriend. But shortly after, she left. I was doing what I was supposed to do according to the rules, but those didn't make her stay. She left me, saying I was an "asshole."

I was homeschooled, too. Very sheltered, now that I know the word for it. I was supposed to assert dominance, and I was told that only the males that did what we were doing were the real humans, and that women or men that didn't conform were not people.

I always believed these things, but I had a big waking moment the other night.

It was right before the Solstice that we started getting strange notes. They were written in some sort of runic script. As far as I can tell, they looked like threats written on paper. They appeared to be death threats.

"Donny, ignore them. Just some non-human's prank."

Dad had always called people non-human. In an effort to keep up the ruse I was under for years.

But these notes kept coming. Multiplying. It was as if we were being given more notes than we were burning them.

And then, last Christmas Eve, something very crazy had happened.

My heart was pounding as if it were loudly knocking on a wooden door. I knew if I didn't get to sleep at 6:00 pm, I'd get the belt. But this routine thing went off track. I had a hard time sleeping that night, meaning I had the fear of the belt come in again, but this time, no one came in.

I heard screams of terror from my parents' room. From then, my heart banged like the Big Ben tower, but as rapid as a race car.

"HELP!! HELLLLP!!"

And I remembered I had a present under the tree. It had been there, but I was told opening it before Christmas would make the object inside vanish.

But as I checked to make sure it was still there, apparently it looked as if the whole present vanished.

I looked around for it, scared out of my skin thinking it was stolen. I looked everywhere and couldn't find it. Then I heard a bellowing voice.

"Come out, Donny! I know you're in here! Get over here!"

And this voice alone gave me the creeps.

"Coal in the stocking wasn't enough to tell you that you were incredibly evil! Donny, get over here!"

Evil? Me? I was shaking in my boots when the voice began to grow louder.

"Just what have you been doing all this time? You have some *real* lessons to learn, Donny!"

This time, I was crouching as though I was trying to hide. Sweat had poured from my head like a fountain. I was reaching a breaking point. And then, what appeared before me was the face of a strange, goat-like creature. His horns were long, reaching at least 15 feet.

"You're getting in the basket, boy!"

Then he grabbed me by the shirt I wore and I was dropped into his basket. The inside of it reminded me of the TARDIS; it was larger inside than it was outside. The fact that I was indeed picked up by Krampus made many scary thoughts come to mind. I wondered what he was going to do to me. Was he going to kill me? Was he going to beat me worse than my dad did?

And then, I saw my parents. They were apparently knocked out.

I was shaking, but I kept trying to find the courage to talk to Krampus. I was stuttering, but I said this to him,

"What d-did I do t-to make you s-so mad?"

"You're not fooling me! You know what you did!"

"I had r-rules to f-follow."

"Rules, my left hoof! You tell me what you did! I know what you did, but you have to understand!"

"Understand what, s-sir?"

"Show me that you remember your sins! Tell me!"

"Th-then you u-understand that my p-parents w-were abusive? Th-that I had to do what they s-said or I'd be b-b-belted?"

"Color me unsurprised, Donny. Your parents made you think your sins were normal things? Just what kind of a rock have you been living under?"

"I-I know there's a w-word for it... but I d-don't th-think I learned it."

"Sheltered, kid. You were sheltered the whole time. Tell me what you did. All these years."

And I admitted everything. The time I misgendered and made fun of one of the girls in class (she was trans), the time I threatened to shoot the boy in my neighborhood, the stuff I did to my ex-girlfriend, everything. I began to break down crying. I admitted that I was told to do these because it was "normal," and that I had no idea what was wrong with me.

"I know much of this was my fault, but you have to believe me! It was either do it all or get whipped! I swear, I was so afraid of the consequences..."

"You're 16, kid. It's not too late to mend. As for your parents, they're too far gone to change, so I did you and the whole town a favor."

I checked on my parents for heartbeats. When I found that there was no heartbeat, I had a realization that... that...

"Don't feel bad for them. They were manipulative. They were like this for long enough that they could not turn back. As for you, you still have a young mind. You're capable of change. And it's not every day you find a genuinely remorseful soul."

I was still shaking in my boots. But I was basically shocked into reality.

"I-I'll do what I can. I need to make up for it all."

"So you say you'll atone? The promise is normally empty."

"I need some resources for ways I can do it, but I will!"

And then, even as I peered out of the basket, he had evidently turned to me.

"You've got a new resolve. This is rare. A promise to atone that is genuine. That, too, is rare. Enjoy the rest of the ride."

&#x200B;

I woke up Christmas morning to find myself right next to the tree. I at first wondered if it was all a nightmare, but when I checked the whole house, I knew he was right. They really were gone.

I looked on the table, and there was a present on it. Although wrapped in a deep purple, it was definitely something for me.

I opened it to find a Nintendo Switch set, a book with lessons on kindness, and some sort of handbook on respect and advocacy.

Along with the items was a note that said,

"Some presents to celebrate the start of your new journey. -K"
