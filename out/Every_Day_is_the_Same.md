Every day is the same. I wake up at the same time, 6:35 AM, head downstairs and start a coffee. Dishes in the sink, bothers me that they were left there but I’ll clean them anyway. I shower, put on my clothes, and work from home. After a hard day’s work, evening rolls around and I make dinner, clean my dishes, and get ready for bed. The book I pick depends on the mood I am feeling, but always a non-fiction. The coughs are starting to really bother me, but I fall asleep, nonetheless.

I wake up, 6:35 AM, just like every other day. I shower, put my clothes on and head downstairs. No dishes to clean today, I notice as I start my coffee. What a wonderful way to begin the day. As I work hard on my device, I sip my coffee. Nothing out of the ordinary today, just like every other day. After dinner I head to bed with a book in hand. Sometimes it feels like someone is in my closet. I really need to stop leaving the light on in there. My book tonight is quite riveting, I think to myself as I drift off to sleep.



___



Another day. Always love to start with a shower and getting ready. Feels good to get that out of the way before starting even the most menial of tasks. Dishes in the sink again, I might have to say something. I start my coffee and get working, lots done today! Dinner was fantastic tonight (note – write down recipe). I love falling asleep just listening to the sound of my fan lightly spinning in the night, occasionally broken up by the sound of coughing.

Every day is the same. I slap my 7 AM alarm off as I hop out of bed. I should probably unload the dishwasher this morning, but I’ll save it for later. Coffee starts dripping as I open my device and get to work. Routines are the key to happiness; I was once told. Dinner leaves me wanting more, but I know my limits and would not want to be rude. I fall asleep wondering if my dreams will be as fantastical as the novel I am reading.



___



10:32 AM. Alarm didn’t go off today. It happens. Coffee was already made when I got downstairs. Did I leave the pot out yesterday? Not important, I am already 2 hours behind schedule. No dishes to worry about today, so I quickly shower and get ready to work. Dinner is alright, but I’m distracted by the light on in the closet. I might need to buy a timer to automatically shut that off. Coughing tonight was out of control, it’s starting to truly bother me.

6:35 AM, nothing quite like it. The best part of living alone is that I don’t have to worry about my appearances throughout the day. I make my coffee as usual, start work, and let the hours fly by. There was nothing of note to report about dinner today. I can’t believe the twists this book has taken, changing from a fantasy to a sci-fi unexpectedly. The fan lulls me to sleep.



___



Bright and early. Coffee in the pot, showered, ready, and starting work. I’ll have to clean those dishes soon, but I’d rather not. I slipped up at dinner tonight, prepared two plates instead of one. Sometimes I feel like I am losing it. I lay in bed with my eyes closed, letting the buzz of the fan drown out the coughs. 



___



Not sure I love the mornings. 7:30 feels way too early to be starting my day, maybe I should push it back tomorrow? I shower, get ready, and open my device. Time to work. Closet light was on again, electricity bill will have to be higher this month, I just know it. After dinner I grabbed my book and drifted off to bed.



___



6:35 AM. Shower, make my bed, and start cooking breakfast. Same as every other day. As I’m working on my device a strange thought comes to my head. What is it that I do? What a silly question, not sure why these sorts of things come to mind sometimes. Dinner could have been better, but I am not one to critique another’s cooking. My bible provided a perfect segue into sleep as I read through Genesis.



___



7 AM. I love my routine. Coffee drip begins and I head over to my shower to get ready. I cannot believe there are more dishes in the sink, but I guess that’s the cost of eating at home cooked meals. I stare at my device and work hard today. Dinner leaves me full as I grab my book and head to bed. He wasn’t in the closet tonight. He stood in the corner, coughing, as I slowly drifted off to sleep.
