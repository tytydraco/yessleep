I live in a small apartment with my roommate Kai, they are a smart, tall, mellow individual. They like their plants and a fresh French press in the morning. This all seems nice, but I just found out Kai is doing something weird. 



I am a chatty person. I love to let other people know what I am thinking and feeling at all times. Kai is no exception. We met a few years ago when I was moving to the Seattle area, and my buddy knew someone who was looking for a roommate in the same city. We quickly moved in and everything was great. We didn’t start as buddies, but over time, after we shared common spaces and similar interests, we started to become actual friends. 



A tendency I had was telling Kai about my dreams from the night before. It was a morning tradition that I would talk while eating my cereal around the kitchen table. I got self-conscious after a while, because all Kai said was the odd humh or cool. One morning, I just didn't mention my dreams to Kai, thinking they didn't care, but they waited a minute before they said. “Yo, dude, have any weird dreams last night?”



This caught me off guard. “Oh yeah, I had a weird one, so there was this abandoned mall and these worms like in Holes, but they were vampires.” I was glad to see Kai cared for my disturbing and often rambling dream talks. Sadly, I now know why they cared so much.



Kai is gone for the weekend to see family for an early birthday celebration. I totally blanked on their birthday and decided I needed to get a deep cut birthday gift. 



I knew Kai collected certain manga series. I just didn't know what books they needed or what edition, so I did some snooping. We have an open-door policy; if the doors open and we are there, just come in. This was the first time I was in Kai’s room without them there or them on the phone telling me to grab something. I knew it wasn't a big deal because I would be in and out quickly. I was scouring the bookshelf for anything I recognized, but most of it was written in Japanese. I did recognize some art from shows and pop culture, like one popular horror anime with super gross pictures, Uzumaki, I think, could have been a different book.



While quickly glancing around, I saw a leather journal bound in a leather strap next to the other manga. I was gonna skip over it entirely, but the glint I got when the strands of hair in the book took me off guard. It was a long, healthy blonde hair. Kai was constantly changing their appearance and the color of their hair. So Kai was not known to have hair off often longer than 3 inches. It definitely could have been my hair. When I pulled out the journal, I didn't know how much more disturbed I could get. 



The book resembled a wide painter's brush when I held it in my hand.  I thought at first it was a clump or two of my hair from the shower. I was wrong, I opened to an early page and saw each page had a hair of its own that was the same length as the rest. I was freaked but but I was also disturbed by how bog standard it was. To an outside viewer (minus the hair), it seemed to be a well-organized, comprehensive journal. No crazy writings, no pictures of evils from beyond, just standard-looking notes, the topic of the note is what drew my eye. Kai had been taking notes on my dream. 



I had to reread the section agin to make sure I wasn't missing something, (I transcribed the day's notes to the best of my memory.) “January 13th 2025: New development Liam had another dream without me this year has been troubling so far but we need to see how things go from here. Dream contained a simple super stress scenario, on an airplane wing needing to jump over to another airplane that is slowly drawing farther and farther away.  Liam lied and said it was over water, but the dream depicted no such detail. -K” I don't know where to start, the fact that Kai wrote this down, or that they were right. I did add in the detail about the water, I had to think back to the dream. This was not hard because I often have the same stress dreams, and Kai was right. Whenever I have those dreams, I'm usually over endless clouds, I can never picture water. I don’t know why I added that detail when I told Kai. 



I moved to turn the page when I realized the page was stiff, like a water-damaged book that was brought back thanks to a quick blow-dry. The water damage was not across the whole page; it was only in the center of the page and dragged upwards. The hair was centered in this patch of damage, and the warped paper seemed to help hold the loose hair in place. I thought about what could cause this strange partial damage. I then recoiled when I noticed its width, just as wide as a tongue. I gagged at this revolution and closed the book in hopes of returning it to the shelf exactly where I found it. 



I'm freaked out now. What should I do? Tell them I was looking in their room? Just leave? They should be back at some point later tomorrow night. I'll figure it out by then. I just want to know if I'm in some sort of danger. I didn't get a good look at other pages, but they all had the same header. Should I look at more pages before they get home?
