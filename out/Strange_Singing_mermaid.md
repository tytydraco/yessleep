Hey guys, 14-year-old from New Zealand here. I wanted to share something really strange that has been on my mind for a while. This is about something that happened to my family before my parents split up, and it’s honestly pretty unsettling. I was very young during most of this, and got info from family so some details might be a bit foggy.

We used to live in this massive house—almost like a mini-mansion—next to a man-made lake. It was a beautiful place with a huge garden, lots of surrounding land, and plenty of water. Ducks were always around, making it feel almost magical in a way. However, something strange happened while we lived there, and even now, years later, it still gives me chills.

Before I was born, my brother, who was still a toddler at the time, had a near-death experience. He fell into one of the lakes and almost drowned. If it weren’t for my uncle, who happened to see him and pull him out in time, he wouldn’t have survived. After they rescued him, my brother started talking about this “naked fish lady” he had seen in the water. She was apparently just there, staring at him. Everyone was so focused on making sure he was okay that they didn’t really think about what he said. They probably brushed it off as something his imagination cooked up due to the traumatic experience.

A few years later, when I was about 3 and my sister was around 11, she started complaining about seeing a similar figure. She would tell my parents about this lady who would visit her at night. My sister described her as being wet, naked, and somehow aquatic, almost like a mermaid or something similar. She also mentioned that the woman sometimes came with a “husband,” but my sister didn’t like him at all because he seemed mean or threatening. What really creeped me out, though, is that my sister said when the woman wasn’t visiting her, she would hear her singing somewhere nearby. This singing wasn’t just something my sister noticed—our neighbors’ kids would also complain about hearing it at night. The parents, however, thought we were all just being kids trying to scare each other and didn’t take it seriously.

Here’s the part that really freaks me out.

Fast forward to when I was about 12 years old. By then, we had moved out of that house and lost contact with the area. One day, though, we met the new owners of the house. We were talking with them casually when, out of nowhere, they mentioned something chilling. They started talking about a lady they had seen—wet, aquatic, and singing at night. They described her exactly the way my sister and brother had years ago. There’s no way they could’ve known about our experiences because we had never told anyone outside the family about the fish lady. Yet somehow, they were encountering the same thing.

This has left me with so many questions. How could two different families experience the same bizarre phenomenon years apart? What could this fish-like woman be? Could it be some kind of spirit, a shared hallucination, or something else entirely?

If anyone has any ideas or theories about what this could be, I’d love to hear them. It’s been haunting me for years, and I can’t help but wonder if there’s a logical explanation—or if this is something truly paranormal.
