I spent the entire day cleaning the mess. I decided to dump the body with the nurse. I learned a lot of things about rotting flesh that day. For example, the blue-grey skin stuck to my shovel like bubblegum left in the sun. The smell was beyond awful. I figured if I buried the corpse and got rid of the smell that clung to my pants, then maybe I would be able to put all of this behind me. Maybe I could forget everything since the day I took my father home from the hospital. Ironic.

My father visited me again last night. I never hear him come in. I never hear him climb the stairs. But I hear him outside my room. I hear his claws on the wooden floor. Sometimes he sniffs under the crack of the door, sometimes he scratches his hand down the woodwork. I don’t know if ‘hand’ would be the correct term. I don’t sleep anymore. I sit in my bedroom, watching my door all night. Even if I wasn’t, I know I still wouldn’t be capable of falling asleep. If I dare lay in my bed at all, I find myself staring at the ceiling. I wonder what he thinks about. He must know I’m in the room, but then why does he run? If he wanted to attack me, I’d be dead already.

With barely any social life, family, or money, there wasn’t much to do. I had Annie, sure. But she was busy most weekdays with university. I found myself procrastinating more and more during the day. For almost an hour I lay on my bed tossing that damn stress ball into the air. After a while, my arm went numb and I missed the catch. Those things are heavier than they look when they land on your nose. I didn’t even have the energy to swat the ball off my face. I just lay on my bed feeling sorry for myself. And then I got an idea.

It was dusk when I went into my backyard. I looked around to make sure I was alone. My fences were quite high but clearly didn’t stop everything. I turned a packet of pork upside-down onto the grass. I didn’t know if this would work, but it was worth a shot. I reached into my pocket and pulled out the stress ball. I placed it just away from the pork and went back inside. Maybe this would cheer me up.

I’ve been running low on money recently, so I got a new job at a local convenience store. Nothing glamorous, but it helped with my bills, at least. For the most part, everything was going well. I made a few new friends and had no encounters. For the first time in a while, I finally felt like my life was getting back on track. I hadn’t seen or heard my dad in weeks. All was good. It was only in the last couple of weeks, I noticed a black, unmarked car following me to and from work. Even more missing children posters began popping up all around town. There must’ve been a dozen or so. I felt guilty. I was guilty. They didn’t deserve that fate. But some people did.

I’ve been spending a lot of time with Annie recently. Our relationship has been going well. She was incredibly supportive and told me I could spend my Christmas holiday at hers. I would’ve said yes, but I glanced out the window and saw that black car. I couldn’t risk dragging her into everything I was mixed up in. Although we had only been dating a couple of months or so, I really liked this girl.

We changed the channel to the news at work. A customer shouted from the back of the store after seeing something on his phone.

“We’re live outside the Westmoore history museum, where police say there’s been a wild animal attack. The manager of the museum, Phil Quelch, has been found dead after a brutal onslaught from what police are only guessing, was a mountain lion. As of now, no witnesses have come forward in the case.” My heart skipped a beat. I tried not to smile at the news, but I couldn’t help a small grin spreading across my face. So that was all it took?   

I stayed home for a while. Every so often looking out at the black Volkswagen parked across the street. After a while, I decided to call my Mom. I had neglected to call her amid everything that was going on. Of course, I wasn’t going to tell her that her husband had become a child-eating monster. I lied and told her my dad was doing well, enjoying his time at my place and causing all sorts of trouble. She seemed happy enough with the news and gave me an update on the meals in the nursing home. She made me promise to come visit her and bring my dad. I promised I would. Liar.

“I love you, son.” She said. I love you too, Mom.

It’s been three weeks without anything strange happening, until today. I suppose it shouldn’t come as much shock, but the authorities found all of the missing children. Each of their bodies were discovered half-eaten and decomposed. They were found in a den in the woods. According to the news, it took eight K-9 units to bring out the bodies. Police said they don’t know how deep the hole goes, but estimate twenty-five metres judging by the time it took the dogs. Police and volunteers had been searching for the children tirelessly, I think most people were just happy we found the kids at all. At least now they could be laid to rest.

Thankfully, in the few days Annie stayed with me, there were no more ‘incidents.’ We stayed home mostly. Annie was studying art and design at university but had finished up for Christmas break. Most days were full of movie-watching and doom-scrolling. Annie and I hadn’t been dating long, but I think I was starting to fall in love with her.

A few days after Christmas, I returned home and immediately felt boredom wash over me once again. I realized I only smiled in the presence of those blue eyes and jet-black hair. I looked out the window and saw the familiar black Volkswagen parked across the street. Where did they get the energy? I was exhausted. I took off my jacket and slumped down on the sofa. Letting out a big sigh, I noticed a small white rectangle on my table. *The police card.* I thought. I wouldn’t be bored for long.

I watched the car parked outside my house all day. I’m sure they saw me looking, but I didn’t care. Anger built up inside me every second I stared. Who did they think they were? They had no evidence. They had no right. They had no case against me. And yet, here they were - outside my house all day. Fortunately, I knew they weren’t the only ones outside my house. I waited until night, once Annie had gone to bed, and the neighbor's lights had gone out for the night. I decided to act.

The officer in the passenger seat had fallen asleep, but the one behind the wheel still watched me. I could make out that it was Sergeant Stone. Even as I approached the car, he didn’t take his eyes off me. I reached the car and looked to make sure there was nobody around. Stone rolled down his window, ready to hear what I had to say.

“I killed those people. And I'll kill you too.” I couldn’t believe the words coming out of my mouth, and neither could he. Stone opened the door and stepped out.

“The fuck did you just say?” His partner slowly opened his eyes, still waking up. I stepped back from the officer but kept my composure.

“You know, you’re pretty stupid for a cop. The writing was on the wall.” My heart was racing, every beat sounded like a drum in my ears.

“Are you admitting to murdering those people?” He rested his hand on his sidearm. If this didn’t work, I was done for. I shoved Stone against his car, staggering his partner awake. The officer was at least six feet and built like a brick shithouse. There was no way I’d beat him in hand to hand. He regained his composure and walked to me. His partner got out of the car and started walking over. I backed up, tripping over the curb and stumbling onto my back. I raised my hand to stop the officer from getting any closer and began to cry.

“Please don’t hurt me!” I cried. I crawled back. “Oh god, are you going to kill me? Please - please don’t do this.” The officer believed my act. Truth be told, there wasn’t much acting. I was terrified. Stone took this opportunity to attack me. He stomped on my ankle between the road and the curb. I heard the snap. All the air in my lungs was expelled. I tried to clutch my ankle but the officer grabbed my wrists and hoisted me up to my feet first.

“Holy fuck Stone, what the hell are you doing?” His partner said.

“This son of a bitch deserves it. He killed children, goddamn it! Who says he didn’t break his ankle while running away?” His partner looked anxious. The officer picked me up and held me by my collar. I thought he might kill me on the spot.

“Babe, what's going on? Who are these men? Oh, god your ankle! I’m calling the cops!” Annie?! No, she couldn’t be here. Not now!

“Annie, go back inside now! It’s not safe!” I tried to yell over the pain, but that was as much as I could muster.

“Go back inside ma’am, this is police business.” Stone said with unwavering authority.

“You’re damn right this is police business!” She stood at the door, ten feet away from me and Stone. The partner drew his gun on Annie.

“Ma’am! Inside! now!”

“No! Don’t hurt her, please! Leave her be! I’m begging you! I wasn’t yelling at the cop.    

“You’re done you son of a–” A shadow sped past behind Sergeant Stone. He let go of my collar and turned around to face his partner. He didn’t react. He didn’t even make a noise. When the officer showed his back to me, I saw three deep gashes spanning across his back. Part of his spine was on display. He looked around, slowly and confused, then collapsed. A piercing scream broke the silence.

“Annie, get inside now, please! Please get in the house!” She was frozen, like a statue.

I stared, teary-eyed at Annie, taking in all of her features. Her body was forcing her to witness everything going on behind me. I tried to scream but the pain was too strong.

“W-what the fuck? Where did it go?” I listened as the Officer opened and slammed the car door. I listened as the engine started. As the glass smashed. As he screamed. As he went silent.

“Annie, please, please please Annie. Annie!” I cried, words were quickly becoming impossible. Annie seemed to break from her trance. She looked me in the eye and finally obeyed. She turned and ran to the front door. 

My father was faster. He pounced on Annie and before I could beg him to stop, he plunged his fangs into her neck. He shook her violently until half her neck was torn off. His pale figure rose from his prey onto his hind legs. His maw, pointed at the sky, was dripping as though it had found a new satisfaction. His forelegs hung from its body. My father slowly turned his head and looked at me. I could see his milky eyes reflecting what little light the moon allowed.

My eyes couldn’t believe what they were seeing. Annie lay on the floor, choking for life but spitting only blood. It took her two minutes to die. I crawled over to her and wrapped my arms around her pale body. She bled and choked and seized before finally lying still. I broke down and hugged her body as tightly as I could. I rocked Annie and screamed for her to wake up. I looked up and saw that monster, sitting in the hallway looking back at me. I saw nothing in its eyes. Nothing. All my sorrow transformed into anger. Hatred.

It was an abomination birthing from the darkness. It peered at me from all fours. The only thing I could clearly make out was its flat, reflective eyes. It slunk back into the void with surgical positioning, careful of every hand placement. Eventually, it faded away.

I suppose now this is an admission of guilt rather than a place to document my bizarre experiences. I am just as guilty as that monster. More so even. I *knew* what I was doing. As I write this, I’m preparing to put an end to all of this once and for all. Once It's done I’ll turn myself in. I think my best shot at finding the animal will be in the woods where the children were found. I’ll post one final update here once it’s dead. I love you, Dad.
