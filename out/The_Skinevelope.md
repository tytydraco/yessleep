The Skinvelope

The twelve inch kitchen knife penetrated my abdomen with such force I could feel it pierce into the solid wooden chair behind me. It wasn’t an unusual sensation for me at this stage in my life but it wasn’t something I thought I’d ever get used to. The blade rooted around in me, searching my intestines like a plumber cleaning gunk off an ancient faucet. I was on the verge of passing out when it at last found the small blood-soaked box it had been mining for. The thing standing over me eyed it greedily as it ripped it from my small intestine with a callousness akin to rooting a grub out of the dirt. The blade fell from its hand and landed with a clunk onto the dirty linoleum. With a too wide smile, it lapped up the blood from the box until it could see the small incantation etched into the front. 

Its ungodly grin dropped immediately and in a blink it was on top of me once again, the grotesqueness of its face mere inches from mine. It let out a sandpaper growl, and spoke with such a quiet voice that if it hadn’t been so close to me I could not have even perceived it was speaking at all.

 

“Key.”

Through fits of crimson running down my chin and cheeks, I managed to spew out what I had rehearsed in the mirror for a week before this nightmarish rendezvous even took place.

“Payment.”

The abomination slowly returned to its feet producing an iron black coin that it dropped inside my shredded burning stomach. The deal being complete, I tensed and in a few seconds everything returned to its rightful starting position inside me. Feeling much better and with my confidence back in spades, I kneeled off the chair picking up the blood soaked blade from the floor. I chuckled to myself that the towering Lovecraftian nightmare before me was at my mercy for even the slightest moment, at least until I gave him what he desired. 

Using the point of the blade, I drew a blood smeared five point transmutation circle on the floor and motioned for the creature to set the box in the middle of it. It obeyed my command, its eyes a deep flowing sea of red that thousands of humans had been lost to. 

With the box placed in the center of the circle, I whispered to it and pressed my thumb down hard on the south side of the circle. 

“Dissero.”

At the sound of my word, the five points of the circle glowed and the box unceremoniously clicked open. 

The creature was upon the box in an instant, pulling a tiny piece of scroll out and scanning the knowledge it held within. Suddenly the creature let out a howl, not quite like the growl from before but an abhorrent cacophony of sound, this sounded almost like it was as if darkness itself were laughing at the light. After the sounds ended, it turned the waves of red back into me and uttered one barely perceptible word with a sharp toothed excitement.

“Reply.”
