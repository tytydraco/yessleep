To whoever is reading this: You probably don’t know who I am, but I’m sorry for what I’ve done to you. This will probably never make it to the public, but my guilt is eating away at me, and I feel like I’m out of options. The least I could do is get this out there, so that maybe, hopefully, someone reads this, and more unlikely, takes this seriously. That way, I’m not one of the few who know just how bad we messed up, and what we’ve done to the world. I’m sure this’ll read like some nutjob’s manifesto, but please, hear me out. I think I’ve helped link our world to something else out there, and if humanity isn’t careful, we’re going to open a door and invite something to Earth that I’m pretty sure will end us in the blink of an eye. I know that’s a lot, so let me backtrack.

I was an Archaeologist, and a damn fine one, if I do say so myself. I specialized in decoding ancient writing. I’ve probably helped with translating most of the more popular ancient texts out there, from Sumerian, to Greek, to Egyptian. So when I get a call from a small, specialized team off in Egypt about wanting some text translated on a door to a recently uncovered tomb, I don’t bat an eye and book the next flight. I kept a diary of my findings. I kept it hidden on me, too, so the guys that got me quarantined haven't taken it. It’s funny- I can read the words, I understand what they mean individually, but I can’t piece together my own writing. It’s like my mind immediately forgets whatever it is that I read. It’s got to be an effect of the tomb. In any case, I’ve decided to painstakingly, word by word, transcribe my diary here. Hopefully you can make sense of it.

\~\~\~\~

Day 1:

You’d think that after spending days in sand-swept dunes, or remote, ancient locations, you’d get tired of it. But here I am, writing from a tent, just outside of a recently excavated tomb that they found here in Gilf Kebir. I’ll admit, I’m a little apprehensive. While the door to the tomb is fascinating (I’ll get to that in a minute), I don’t know how anyone would’ve found this thing in the first place. There was no tomb marker, no statues, absolutely nothing built into or around this plateau that would indicate a tomb was hidden here. If these guys weren’t using some of the latest seismic tools to map out the land, there’s no telling how much longer this thing would’ve stayed buried. I can understand, too, their eagerness to excavate and unearth this find- it’s rare to get to see an untouched tomb nowadays, especially one so isolated from any others on the map. It makes me wonder if there’s a whole cache of hidden tombs, just waiting to be uncovered, and share their history. Exciting!

So, back to the door. It’s massive. Two, 20 ft or so slabs of deep black granite is my guess, from what they’ve uncovered so far. They’re still whittling away at the rock surrounding it, but the glimpses I see are still incredible nonetheless. It goes without saying, but I’m most fascinated by the writing on the doors. Every single inch of the stone uncovered so far has dense lines of script- like the Rosetta Stone. It’s weathered to all hell, but I can identify some hieroglyphs, as well as Ancient Greek. I can’t make out full sentences yet, but from what I got so far, I can see something about a “key”, or an “origin” of some sort, and something about “riches”. The guys seemed to work a little faster after I plucked that word. In any case, we’ve got a lot of work ahead of us, but this seems promising!

Day 5:

It’s been steady going, but we’ve been making progress on getting this door uncovered. Rick, the man leading this whole expedition, is a fair enough guy, making sure no one overworks themselves in this heat. Rick’s picked a great little team here- between Jimmy, Suzan, Frank, Jade, and myself, I can’t think of a better team for cracking the secret of this tomb. I think we’re all just excited to see what’s on the other side. The only bad news so far is that years and years under soil have not treated these slabs well. I’m having difficulty translating the full message transcribed. My best guess on what the writing on the door says is: “The key to nothing is resting here. Wealth, there is none. Forgetting is a gift.” Warnings are written all the time on tombs, often warning about curses or traps, but I haven’t read one like this before. At our continued rate, we should have this door ready to go in a few days or so, weather permitting.

Day 8:

Today’s the day! We’ve got enough of the door uncovered to be able to open it. Seeing this jet black set of doors nestled into the rock really is quite imposing. The warning over and over inlaid in the door doesn’t help either. Still, this isn’t my first rodeo, so once we find a way to get these doors open, I’ll report back later on what we uncover! Rick wants these doors open by midday at the latest, so we can get plenty of light in there, to see what’s going on.

Day 8:

Today’s the day! We’ve got enough of the door uncovered to be able to open it. Seeing this jet black set of doors nestled into the rock really is quite imposing. The warning over and over inlaid in the door doesn’t help either. Still, this isn’t my first rodeo, so once we find a way to get these doors open, I’ll report back later on what we uncover! Rick…. wait. I already wrote this. I never updated on what we found. Come to think of it, I’m drawing a blank on yesterday. I remember writing in my journal, we set up the equipment to force the doors open, and… nothing. Looking out of my tent right now, the doors remain closed. I need to investigate.

So I just spoke to Rick, and he’s also a bit confused. When I asked him how long we’ve been out here, he also thought it was still day 8. I showed him my phone’s date, and he seemed as puzzled as I was. We gathered everyone up, and sure enough, it’s like an entire day was taken away from all of us. No one remembers what happened when we forced the door open, or why it’s back to being closed. I’d like to attribute it to the sweltering heat, but I know that’s not true. Something’s wrong. Rick paused all further attempts until we can figure out what’s going on. I’m going to go back through my notes to see if I missed anything on the translation. Between the five of us, someone’s got to remember something.

Day 10:

I don’t know who Frank is. I wrote about him on day five, but I have no idea why I wrote that. I’ve asked the whole camp, and they assure me that it’s always been us five, not six. Everyone’s drawing a collective blank on what happened the day we tried to open the tomb. Everything in our brains tells us it’s stupid to try again, but at the same time, when we sit in silence, checking our gear, the collective desire to try again is palpable. This isn’t a group so easily willing to give up. Rick seems to be in the same boat, saying that we’ll try again tomorrow.

Something keeps bothering me. Everyone assures me that it’s always been us five. Why, then, did we set up an extra, empty cot then? Why do we have a bunch of extra supplies? In those supplies, why is there a photograph of a woman, and her child that no one else recognizes? I don’t think anyone wants to actually sit down and think about this.

Day 11:

Well, take two for the tomb today. I didn’t want to wait until the day was over to begin writing. I’ll chronicle as we go today. It’s a little before dawn, and we’ve set up our supplies, ready to get in the tomb. Rick had brought in a very interesting new piece of technology I haven’t seen before- a crate of self-navigational, micro drones. According to Rick, these things can safely fly into an unknown space, and through a bit of 3D-mapping capabilities, fully map the inside of a tomb in a matter of minutes. A part of me feels like it takes a little bit of the fun out of exploring a place that man hasn’t set foot in for years, but I also recognize just how dangerous these places are. It looks like the team is getting ready to crack the door open and send the drones in. Once we have a good idea of what’s in there, we’ll head in.

\~

The drones took an hour to map the area. Rick seemed slightly concerned, explaining to me that he’s never seen them take this long. When we opened up the laptop to look at the scanned area, to say we were stunned is an understatement. This place is HUGE. If we were on an island off of Greece, I would have sworn this was the very maze that housed the Minotaur in the myths. The sheer time it would’ve taken to carve out these winding tunnels, with multiple dead ends, back hundreds of years ago, is comparable to the pyramids hundreds of miles away! We’re expecting a long trek in there, but at least we have a clear path to the central chamber. With luck, I’ll update later tonight on our findings. The energy of the group is a little strange. There’s excitement, sure. But I can’t get my translation out of my head. “Forgetting is a gift.”

\~

It doesn’t make sense. None of it does. The tomb- it was empty. Well, kinda empty. So right after my last update, we went inside the tomb. Immediately entering, the solid black granite was much cooler than the outside Egyptian heat. We used the map that the drones created, and followed the winding path deeper inside. The only noise audible was the sound of our own footsteps against the solid stone. It really did feel like we were the first ones in there. The main room also showed no signs of anyone else before us- or maybe they just didn’t leave a trace. It was a large room that seemed like it should be filled with priceless artifacts, but there was nothing- except for the coffin. This goes against most Egyptian burials- they believed that you brought your possessions with you to the afterlife. Why were there none in the room? At first, we thought we had found the tomb of someone infamous- someone who did something so horrible, the Egyptians wanted to forget about them. But opening the sarcophagus led to only more questions. It was empty.

I still don’t think anyone got to it before us, as it took us a lot of effort to pry open the lid to the strange sarcophagus seated in the dead center of the room. It, too, was made of a similar material to the doors, and the walls- solid, black granite. It wasn’t carved into a person’s visage, like most sarcophagi, but instead, covered in writing. I took plenty of photos, which I plan to review for translation soon. Once we got the lid open and peered inside, however, we were greeted with nothing. An empty, black coffin. We searched the inside, looking for a lever, a switch, writing, something. It was empty. The smooth, solid black of the granite almost made it look like we were peering into an empty void. My conclusion? I think this was a tomb that never got filled. Something went wrong, and whoever was supposed to be buried here, wasn’t. Clearly, it was someone who was not liked, so they went ahead and probably dropped him in some ditch, and called it a day. While a part of me is a little disappointed, this was still an interesting find, even if it’s due to the irregularity of the tomb. Some of the others want to scope out some of the other dead ends, to see if anything was missed, before we wrap it up here and report our findings. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t curious to take another peek in there myself.

Day 12:

I couldn’t sleep last night. Just as I felt like I was finally dozing off, it sounded like someone was mumbling, or whispering in their sleep. I didn’t recognize whose voice it was, and even when my eyes adjusted to the darkness of the tent, I couldn’t see anyone’s lips moving. Despite this, I’ve been making solid progress on my translations. A lot of it seemed to repeat the warning on the door. Some of the new stuff talks about a voice- translated to “your” voice? It could also be “my” voice; it’s tough to discern the context. I’ll keep working on it.

\~

I think it may not have just been me who didn’t get much sleep last night- everyone’s acting a little weird. This morning, I saw Jade push Jimmy, as he was bent over looking at our supplies. Naturally, Jimmy was pissed. What’s weird, though, is that Jade was immediately apologetic, claiming she just “had the urge to do it.” It wasn’t just her, though. I watched Rick purposefully bend the antennae to one of the handheld radios we have, only to then try to fix it, cursing under his breath. I’m not sure what’s going on.

\~

It’s happened to me too. I was eating lunch, and I just… poured out my water. I don’t know why. It was like… I had the thought to do it, and I really wanted to. So I did. I didn’t do it involuntarily, at least, I don’t think so. I just chose to act on that thought. With how fast it came and went, though, it honestly felt like it wasn’t even my own thought. I’m not sure what’s gotten into me.

\~

Something’s wrong with us. Suzan came out of the tomb, frantic. Her and Jimmy just went into the cave a half-hour ago. Jimmy wasn’t with her when she came out. Suzan told us that Jimmy jumped- they were checking out some of the other branching paths, and they came across a pit. She said they both stared at it for some time, before he just...leaped. “Like he was diving into a swimming pool.” She said. We were ready to head in and see what we could do to get him out, but she made it clear that after a few moments of silence, she heard him land. Then the silence returned. Rick’s made it clear that no one goes back into the tomb, and he called in the institution funding our dig to get us a ride out of the desert.

While we wait for a ride to show up in the next few days, I’m going to try to translate more of this sarcophagus. Mostly to keep my mind off of what’s happening, but a piece of me also feels like this is important. There’s something we missed.

Day 13:

Whatdidweletout

\~

I couldn’t sleep last night, so at some point, I must have scribbled what I wrote earlier. I’d be lying if I said I remembered writing that, though. I think it’s what I’m secretly afraid of- that was a sealed coffin. I’m not really superstitious, but what if we’re cursed? I feel ridiculous writing that, but things have been only getting worse, quicker. I keep getting strange little urges- Light all of our matches. Rip a hole in our tent. Draw a deep line in the sand with my foot. As fast as they arrive, they leave. But it’s tough to act against them. I can see everyone on edge. They must be dealing with the same thing. I need to focus on my translations today. This might prove to be the distraction I need.

\~

“ He will be your voice. But your actions will be his. Everyone will be the key to the coming nothing.”

Who is he? What… what did we let out? Nothing? Nothing is coming? Is nothing a thing? Or a state that we’ll reach? I’m going to keep this to myself. I don’t want the rest of the crew freaking out. This doesn’t sit right, though. He will have my voice, but my actions will be his? Is this what we’re all experiencing? What is going on? Who is in my head?

\~\~\~\~

There. Whatever I wrote ends there. I can’t remember much from our time by that tomb, only bits and pieces. I can remember the tomb itself. I remember we opened it. My solid memories kick up right when we were being driven back. The driver kept asking us if there were more people, but we were sure that there were only the four of us. He seemed to hesitate on that information, but if I’m being honest, the guy was a little weird anyway. Driving us back to the base of operations, he kept swerving the car back and forth, just for the fun of it, it seemed. Everyone’s been acting weird around us. It’s subtle, but I’ve seen a guy impulsively kick over a waste bin. Another guy bit his cheek hard enough to bleed a little.

It didn’t take long for a few guys in suits to step in, and ask us about what we remember down by the tomb. They’ve had us in quarantine for some time now, but I think whatever they’re trying to quarantine, it’s too late. I’ve heard them use the term “intrusive thoughts” in passing, and I think that’s the best way to describe what I’ve been feeling. These… thoughts that I have. I wish I knew what to say. If this ever gets out there- to whoever’s reading this- please, you can’t listen to that voice when it calls. I don’t know what that voice is inching us towards with these small actions, but if a butterfly flapping its wings can cause a typhoon on the other side of the globe, I shudder to think what the small actions of the entire world might be leading to.

I don’t know where I heard this advice from, but I feel like it fits this situation- Just forget about these thoughts; don’t let your mind dwell on them.
