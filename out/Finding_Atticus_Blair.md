One of my earliest memories is of my dad arguing with our neighbor, Mr. Blair. It became almost a daily occurrence. Simple things at first like, keep your dog off my lawn, trim your bushes, your flood light is pointed right at our bedroom window, etc. As I got older, it just felt right to be on my dads side. There were times when I would chip in, throw some sticks over the fence, make faces at Mr. Blair. Stupid kid shit.

For all I knew, this had been going on before my birth, and it showed no signs of stopping. It escalated steadily. Every night at dinner, the conversation always slipped to something Mr. Blair did that pissed my dad off. Mom made a show of caring, but deep down I don't think she did.

Then, one beautiful fall day, when I was seven, the tension shot straight into the sky. We had been out for ice cream, and upon coming home, there was a huge mess right in our driveway. Dad exploded. He slammed our car into park and rushed next door, yelling until he was hoarse. A tree from Mr. Blairs property had fallen right across our drive, and blocked access completely. Even mom had words to say.

To his credit, Mr. Blair came out, stayed calm, stated he had a chainsaw and would clean it up pronto. As you can imagine at this point, my dad did not let it die. For the next several hours, he stood outside and berated our neighbor the entire time he cleaned up. Eventually me and mom walked up to our house to get ready for bed. Dad stayed even though it was getting dark. I was asleep before he came in.

The next few days came and went, with no sign of our neighbor, and in turn, nothing for my dad to complain about. That was the happiest I had seen him at that point.

Though it's been so long ago now, I think around a month went by before things got scary in town.

It started with a welfare check. I was getting off the bus one day when I saw an officer knocking at Mr. Blairs door. When he got no answer he left. Then that evening, from our dining room window, we all saw several more police cars show up. The officers started knocking, looking in windows with flashlights, and eventually kicking in his door.

It wasn't long before the local news was covering what they called "The hunt for Atticus Blair". They said his family hadn't heard from him in days, and that he usually stayed in touch regularly.

They of course knew about his feud with my old man, so it wasn't long before he was being questioned by police. Nothing ever came of it. He had just, vanished. His car was still in his driveway, and his dog was still outside. My dad had a solid alibi, he was with us almost all day when not at work.

For weeks there were searches. The whole town was in on it. Hell even my dad chipped in. I felt awful for how I had treated him, but mom kept me home while searchers looked. A seven year old would only get in the way anyhow.

One of those evenings, while dad helped search, me and mom had decided to watch some movies. I was tasked with washing up and getting some blankets ready, while mom went into the basement to bring up some of our vhs collection to choose from. By the time she came back up, I was beyond ready. I remember she had a strange look on her face. Looking back, it was the look of having seen something you wished you hadn't. We decided on *The Wizard of OZ.* I used to  love the weird little flying monkeys.

I think that night was one of the last good nights of my childhood. My last memory of her was when she carried me, half asleep, to bed and tucked me in. 

I awoke the next day to my dad yelling. It sounded frantic, and scared me. When I emerged from my room, he grabbed me instantly and asked where mom was. The rest of that day escapes me, but the facts of it don't. My mom had vanished too.

For months the town was on alert. Curfews were put in place. Police cruisers patrolled the streets relentlessly. The news said we had a kidnapper at large.

Mom was never found. In those early days, her memory haunted me. There were times when I could almost hear her crying, saying my name. I brought it up to dad once. He held me close and promised it would get better. I didn't hear her again after that. His comfort helped me immensely. 

It was just me and dad. Oddly enough, we became quick friends rather than father and son. We spent nights in, eating, watching movies, and playing board games. He became an excellent cook, and for a while, we always had fresh red meat to eat. He taught me how to cook . When we would set down to eat, his smile came back. We found our way into real happiness for some time. Those meals were the best in my life, and I haven't been able to replicate them, though I have longed for them. 

The town eventually moved on. No-one else went missing, but we never forgot.  Dad spent a lot of time helping with searches. He was even interviewed several times by media outlets. He became an advocate for missing people. He was honestly an amazing father. His only quirk was that he never let me into the basement.  

The uselessness I felt as a child and my dads unwavering support spurred me into becoming a Search and Rescue Officer. I help find and bring people home. I rarely fail, for good or bad. I bring closure. But I never forgot Atticus Blair and my mother.

Unfortunately, as my dad got older, he started to develop Alzheimer's. I moved back in to take care of him. The days I spent with him were like taking a time machine to the past. He often forgot who I was, and would yell at me like I was Mr. Blair. He said odd things. "You shouldn't be up here!, You made me this way", to down right rage. He would throw things at me, then he would weep for hours.

The old man decided to cash in on the anniversary of my mothers disappearance.  To be honest, I was more relived than sad at his passing. He was clearly in a lot of pain and my mothers memory was haunting him.

So, I've been cleaning out his house. I'm selling it, or.... was. See, I found a key to the basement in his room, hidden way back in the closet. It was in a suitcase with some of moms clothing. Curiosity got the best of me, and I had to clean everything out anyways so I went down.

Against one of the walls was an old roll top desk. There was nothing else down there. I don't know what he did with it all, because when I was a kid this place was packed with Christmas decorations, family keepsakes, old furniture, you name it we had it. Though I hadn't been allowed down here in years, it felt wrong. I approached the old desk and rolled back it's lid. Inside, sitting neatly in the middle, was a leather bound journal. I flipped it open and began reading, transfixed by the mystery of it. 

It started out as transcriptions to old arguments with Mr. Blair. Accounts of how angry he made my father. This it quickly became something more. Ideas, wishes, plans on what he wanted to do to Mr. Blair. Then, It started talking about my mother. At this point my eyes were blurry as I blinked through tears. I saw statements like, "she saw what I couldn't let anyone see, she saw ME". I flipped the pages faster and faster as I steam rolled to the climax.

Written in the last few pages, my father described how my mother had "found" Mr. Blairs remains in the basement. How that night when the tree was over our driveway, my father had knocked him out, taken him into our basement, and cut him up. It described how, upon discovering she knew, he did the same to her, after keeping her down here alive for weeks. He even wrote an entry on how it was me hearing her cry that spurred him into butchering her too. 

The last pages was a macabre detailing on how to find their final remains, stowed in the walls of the basement. He left a note there at the end for me. It said "I'm sorry I didn't tell you this myself. I gave you the best life I could". My father had taken her from me, had taken Atticus from his family. So I followed the instructions. I could bring them home too. There were still a few pages but I couldn't read anymore.

I can't describe the scene I found, in the very foundations of my childhood home. I wish I could forget. Something inside of me broke. I can't stop thinking of how I was just like my father back then, taunting our neighbor, facilitating the hate. I don't know what drove him to murder, and how he could sleep at night all these years like this. But I'm terrified that he left that part of himself in me.

Sometimes I hear them, my mothers sobs. I hear Mr. Blair trying to calm my father down. Sometimes I feel him, his shadow inside of me.

Some doors should never be opened. Some truths should never be found. But some truths demand to be unearthed.

This was last month. The police came and stripped the whole place down. There were no more bodies thank God. I've been living in a haze after finding all of that. 

Want to know the worst part? This morning a detective called. Said I should set down. They had read through the journal and there were somethings I needed to know. I nearly passed out when he proceeded to tell me what my favorite childhood meals were made from.
