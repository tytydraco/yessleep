[John's Story 2 (Pt. 2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1aqflzd/pt_j2_i_am_a_private_military_contractor_from_the/?sort=new)

I have no idea if this will work but one of my highest level bosses, I’ll just call him ‘Colonel’ because he’s supposedly alive and well, whenever this goes, wanted me and my squad to sit down and write for an anomalous-computer experiment, I’m not the best Writer but hopefully the Censors, or whatever The Department has responsible with this info will at least clean up spelling errors. Regardless, not my problem, not what I’m paid for; I mean, writing trauma-inducing experiences with the impossible also isn’t, but whatever, I don’t wanna know what happens when you say ‘No’ to something like this, I’ve seen people never walk again for doing less, and hey, I’m not a big writer, but guess I’m stuck doing this.

From the little I was told just to get an idea of what I can and can’t say, this writing is SUPPOSED to be sent back roughly 20 years, which is surreal to think is still in my lifespan, from the year 2040,and from when I’m writing, in November, do not ask me about certain world events, and definitely not about Why or How things happened, I’m just a guy who hasn’t died yet.

Now for about me, as embarrassing as it can be, my name is John Johnson, like John, John’s Son, I am a Co-Pilot for a Subsidiary Company called Quirank Security, we operate out of Appalachia (which yeah, doesn’t help, the Woods already scared the hell out of me as a kid in the Carolina Bush) and provide support to paying customers and/or wherever our dear \[The Parent Organization\] tells us to, it’s not a big company in comparison to some West Coast groups or the Cartels, but we wipe the floor on Roving Gangs or the occasional UN Drone Patrol, it fluctuates a lot, but currently we have about 300 Staff on Base, and not everyone is gun for hire, of course.

For my first story, that's the setting, straight on base, \[The Parent Organization\]’s HQ is way out West in Mississippi, so if something goes really wrong, the absolute fastest we get help is like 3-4 hours, and that is a long fucking time to be dealing with a Hunger Outbreak, this killed a few (expendable) staff in 2038, and it had us completely update our Sickness Security (I’m sure there’s a scientific name for it, but just checking if someone has illnesses after time in the field) and I still get scared I have it floating in my system when I end up around alot of Torn up Flesh, which is a horribly common occurrence.

It was about noon in August 2 years ago, me and my Squad: Heinz, an inhuman- not a metaphor, I think he’s literally not human- 7’+ Muscular Beats that lives off of Meth and ending battles; Charlie, my drinking buddy, Ex-SAS, a very vulgar and Hot tempered Brit, but serious Eagle Eyes and a knack for turning ‘Gray matter into Gone matter’, Zach, who was US Marines before the war, really well mannered Texan Christian guy, keeps me and Charlie out of trouble sometimes, and Dmitri, or Dima (which now that I think about it, is probably over in Ukraine if this goes back to when it’s supposed to, Hi Sgt. Petrov!) as he’s usually called, is my Mentor, was a Russian Federation defector when everything really fell apart, Piloting Fanatic with an impossible Green Thumb (which I might talk about later, he’s also probably one of the oldest people i know still in the fight out here, and his Tenure gets the pay and respect it deserves; he’s turning 55 next year) are all out at The Bar for lunch, it’s more of a Pallet-Shack that happens to have Alcohol and Food with outdoor seating, but it’s what we’ve got on base, and the beers are usually cold and the food is at least room temperature, good enough for a group of guys coming back from an Op to burn everything in a town of Fanatic Cannibals with some Recon and Infantry Fireteams (I skip this just because it was pretty much just ‘Get the call, Fly in, drop some bodies, drop some Fire Accelerant for ground teams, and leave, I don’t actually remember what happened too well, what followed however? I don’t think I ever will).

“y’know, “ Charlie says before immediately going for a bite of his Sandwich and a swig of beer “Those cunts we were dropping seemed a tad off, they were all twitchy, harder to land shots, yeah?”

“Very sickly, diet probably wa’n’t helpin’ of course, Prion Disease is an easy guess” Charlie adds, clanking around his spoon to get morsels of Chili with Beans out of a Can, “but out in the Fertile Crescent and back in my Homeland, I’ve seen similar wierd happenin’s goin’ on, Dunno if it’s some cult or some sickness”

“Same” Heinz says sharply, he stood and stared vigorously while we ate usually, on top of that, it was weird hearing him speak English normally, as he just despised it for the longest time.

“Alright, ‘t’least that confirms I wasn’t just- seeing things.” Charlie responds, flicking his glass a few times before finishing his sentence.

“I hope it’s not what I think, then,” Dima says low and slow, as if everyone around might be trying to listen in, “ When I was young, we had a group, similar, The Churches were a safe haven for everyone without working locks at home, the Militziya did God’s favors to burn them and their belongings like we did.”

Noone talked for a moment, If Dima is writing a report similar to mine now, I hope it has some of his pre-war experiences in it, because he has lived quite a life, and when he shares those stories, you shut up and listen.

“Do you think it’s the same group?” I said.

“Ne, ne, No, not possible, between War, Famine, Pestilence, and inevitable death, the chances of someone surviving from then to now? Like kneading dry flour into a fluffy dough!” he slaps his Rye Bread into his bowl of stew with a soft flopping noise, agitated by the idea.

“War. Famine. Pestilence. Death.” Heinz uttered with his damaged guttural voice, “Hunger for all. Hunger for all.” he shook his head, looking to the ground, then sharply to another table. “UNCLEAN!” he roars, at the table was one of the Squads that had cleared the aforementioned Camp-Village thing were eating and drinking; Heinz was obviously know to seem pretty insane, but aside from most damage seeming powerless to stop him, he was immensely knowledgeable on certain paranormal or biblical entities, which I’m convinced he just straight-up knows personally, so when he started acting like this, I had my Glock’s holster half-cleared and my WASR-10 AK’s Safety off, not for Heinz, but for the people he was yelling at.

“The Hell do you want, goddamn Aryan Supersoldier over here-” one of the Squadmates instigated.

“Not now Tom, Jesus Christ,” another one cut off, slapping him in the back of the head, before taking a bite of a small muffin and setting down the rest, Heinz was right, it looked like he still had pretty dirty hands, at the very least, or cleaned but not very well. “Mr. Klein, we’ll go wash up right now, but I’m sure you know stacking up Corpses makes a man hungry, aye?” he said, trying to be playful with the man who looked like he wanted to and could (and yes, he actually could, it’s gross) crush his skull in one hand.

“Too late.” Heinz stated, his voice is so heavy that it’s hard to tell, but I think it had cracked, sounding a bit Wet and sad, “Say goodbyes from afar, all.” referring to the entire Squad, or maybe everyone there, “The Hunger spreads.”

The man had become even more confused, but was too shocked to run when heinz started picking them up harshly by the arm, a total of 4 men looking like very scared mannequins with no attempt to fight back against the Hulk of a being, and dragged away almost everyone at the table except one guy- who pulled a bottle of hand sanitizer and gave it a squeeze over his hands, probably something Heinz watched him do multiple times- and held them to the ground under his feet as gently as he could, as he pulled out his PKP Machine gun, softly tapping the trigger to put them down before anyone could attempt to intervene, the suppressed but still thunderous cracked of 7.62x54mmR turning their skulls into Concrete powder deafening me and probably everyone else in a decent Radius, each careful Pop getting quieter as the painful Screeching of my eardrums set in. This obviously caused panic, on duty security initially running with weapons drawn, but dropping them purely to Heinz’s reputation in convenient timing to a watchtower sniper making a hot Copper and Lead pancake in his temple (not relevant but I know the guy who did it, still make fun of him for thinking that’d help), but in hindsight, heinz made the quick, dirty, and very good call to slow the spread, people can learn the issue later, but he had to deal with the issue literally staring him in the face before proceeding.

The Blood and other nasty Body bits definitely made it harder to finish eating, but once the smell of flesh crackling under gasoline struck, the Bar might've just closed down for the week. Heinz sprinted across the Tarmac that cut the Base in two and I saw him as he spoke as both frantically and sensibly as he could to our Lieutenant, Jamie Dunne, a Nice Woman around my age (32 now, freshly 30 then) with the heavy accent (or dialect? Again, I’m really not a writer) of someone who’s family has lived in these mountains for the past century and a half, she seems to understand Heinz quite well, and she nodded her head to what he said very seriously, her short brown hair bobbing and weaving her unbroken eye contact with grim focus, she ran to her Office, and then shortly after to our main Radio Building, then half an hour later, while being put on the terrible duty to Watch the Smoldering corpses to deter looters from ‘catching’ whatever Hunger-Sickness-thing that cost them their lives, Jamie came running, almost galloping due to the weight of what she was carrying, which looked to be a Gas Mask bag and papers, along with her usual stuff of a Messenger bag stuffed with a clipboard, a radio, administrative gear and an MP5-k slung tightly to her body, just in case.

“Johns’n, h’re’y’re, gottya’ gasmask ‘n’ sm’ll’n cream, w’got \[The Parent Organization\] onnaway.” she says with a gasp of air. Handing me the bag, which did indeed have a gas mask with particulate filter for the smoke and some menthol cream for the smell.

While I love her and the way she talks, I’ll just give you that bit to get the gist, I’ll translate it to something more readable, but still think ‘Mountain Man as a Girl’, or watch some footage of Appalachian people talking on Youtube (If it exists, whenever this ends up)’

“What the hell is going on?” I obviously had to ask.

“Sickness, makes ya crave people, and you can catch it by people’s blood, real inconvenient, we’re roundin’ up everyone who went out on that Operation, we’ll have a squad from The Anomaly Division here to help clean up the spread.”

“ETA?”

“They’re sending a team from another Operation that happened to be just across the border, about 3 hours.”

As a note, she calls anything West of the peaks of the Appalachian mountain range ‘across the border’.

“Great, I’ll be here when you need me.”

3 Hours past, I was relieved of watching the burn pile about an hour in with Zach taking over for another hour (it was basically our ‘punishment’ to be responsible for whenever one of us did something rogue, even if Heinz gets slack like some kind of diplomatic immunity) and I think Charlie taking the last hour till specialists arrived, or were supposed to. They were held up an hour or two due to an ambush in a mountain pass, it was a misunderstanding just as the Anomaly Division don’t have marked vehicles or uniforms, but that hold-up gave the time for things to start cracking at the seams, I was in my bunk, doing some recreational activities when someone, somewhere, wasn’t keeping an eye on the Ground Zero Guys, and got mauled to death and eaten.

“JOHN! COME!” I heard Dima yell, throwing the door open to our room with his AK105 in hand, shouldered in something like the low-ready position as he looked around sharply, ignoring me and Charlie being ‘caught’ once more sharing a bit of whiskey and cigs in our room, normally we’d be scrambling to hide that, but Dima breaking his quiet composure had our attention to Scramble for our gear.

Now, ‘The Hunger’ isn’t like some superhuman Zombie bullshit virus like the guys in World War Z, but it still seems to make people immensely desperate to eat someone not infected by it, run faster than they ever had, take shots until either Brain or Heart death, and use all their strength irrationally, which makes them kind of twitchy, I guess. They aren't too hard to put down, the issue is when there’s multiple or if it gets spread, and as you would guess, it spread.

We didn’t bother checking because shooting is common on and around base, and if it was an issue, someone would come get us, but someone came to get Charlie and myself, so now it’s an issue on top of no one really knowing specifics on how the infections seems to work, except maybe Heinz and some of the Higher Ups, who are all very selective with what information they hand out, but the strategy seems to have become shooting them in the leg (The Tibia bone if I remember correctly) so that they collapse and try and crawl or hobble on one leg until they fall, then you can blow their brains out into the ground where the blood doesn’t catch the wind, which is what Dima instructed us to do if anyone started acting irrationally violent or twitchy, especially when they do it around corpses.

“What the fuck’s been goin on ou’ere? I’ve been off duty an hour!” Charlie Asked, annoyed, and extra airily to try and clear the smell of liquor from his mouth faster.

“Zhach is working with a Doctor on Radio from \\\[The Parent Organization\\\], We have more help coming, I believe the Anomalous Team is still arriving, as well.” Dima says, dazed as we step back out to the Tarmac, 1 pile of 5 or so bodies burned straight on the Tarmac, guarded by 3 men in NBC suits and a Special Unit in Powered Armour suits we only recently got shipped over from \\\[The Parent Organization\\\], people seemed a bit distrustworthy of each other and maybe even scared of going into enclosed spaces, because everyone was kind of standing around outside, spaced out to avoid each other like birds flying in a flock.

“How many do you think caught it?” I asked, I was now even more terrified that I had bothered to finish eating after the first round of execution by Heinz, maybe I had it for all I knew.

“Well, what, 10-15 people and us were there, and it could have spread by blood, so I doubt too many, I mean, we’ve pretty much seen 10 by now, innit?.”

At that moment though, someone behind us lunged, the crackling of the footsteps tipped us off as Dima sprayed 10 or so rounds to the ground where the still twitching but immobilized man stood, he was still in his Site Security Fatigues, which means he might have roamed away from his post when he started feeling The Hunger, but the more important revelation that hit Charlie before me, as he was a bit less affected from the alcohol:

“This guy isn’t a Field Operator, he fuckin’ caught it on Base!” Charlie drew his Glock 19 from under his Shirt and immediately became much more alert of the people around us.

One of the Men in Powered Armour and a man in Bio Hazard gear approached carefully with weapons raised, which I’ll call ‘Armoured Man’ and ’Scientist’ for brevity,

“Anyone bitten, scratched, or made contact with the blood?” the Scientist asked, his Gun, something similar to a UMP but Swiss, I forgot the name aside from being made by B&T, I didn’t recognize him with the gear, but that kind of equipment was an armory princess, only people with a Rank higher than the entire Logistics department or a serious Contract would have their hands on it without Schmoozing an Armorer, and he had it focused on the corpse at our feet while the Armoured Man trained an AR10 on us.

“We’re clear, thanks.” I said, obviously though, there questions were less about our wellbeing, and more for everyone elses.

The Scientist muttered something, extra muffled by the Suit, but probably made clear using a radio as the Armoured man responded with a shake of his head as he held down the twitching body, paralyzed by the shots but somehow still alive, the Scientist made an approving sound, taking a cube of raw meat with tongs and a flashlight, as he dangled the flesh in front of the Hungry Man’s nose, he shone the flashlight in his eyes, and nodded before turning to me slowly.

“May I?” he asked

I guess he meant ‘wave a blob of human flesh in front of my face and then blind me’ but I didn’t really get a chance to consent, either way, he seemed satisfied.

“That’s the pattern” I think he mumbled to himself, but even so close that I could hear his rubber suit squeaking, it was hard to make out through the Voice Diaphragm of his mask, he then let me go and without explanation on what just happened, pretty carelessly puts a bullet through the side of the Hungry man’s head, and had the Armoured Man drag him to the pile, as our ears ring, someone was apparently talking behind us.

“...but of course, just what I thought.” Zach said, startling us to a point I thought I’d shoot him.

“You can’t do that to me, mate, Christ almighty.” Charlie said, patting Zach on the Shoulder.

“What did you think, Zhach?” Dima asked, taking a double-take to the corpse burn pile.

“He was checking your reaction to the human flesh, I reckon it’s not too appealing norm’ly, but The Hunger makes you excited for it, and ONLY it, makes you go all Bug-eyed, my guess.” He said, flicking his Patrol Cap to get a bit of air to ventilate the sweat of the Stuffy Summer afternoon.

Not much happened for a while, a while being about 20 minutes until the Anomaly Division Convoy pulled in, Up-Armoured Sedans and All Black gear with M50 Gas Masks, very cliche, intentionally cliche even, considering their casualty rate being practically 100% because you can’t retire from what I’ve heard. They apparently at least had gear to accurately test people, which instead made people more restless when people who didn’t seem erratic started getting killed in some honestly confusing, but at least bloodless way, where they stood after being tested, these guys did not care, they wanted this dealt with.

Me and my Squad were first on the list to be tested as we were now some of the few survivors of the Ground Zero, but of course, as we only really were on the ground long enough to talk to some of the Fireteam Leaders and drop of gear, and didn’t touch any bodies, we weren’t infected. Heinz seemed to have known of the Members, he was of a similar stature to himself and they spoke neither English or German, or anything I know of, Heinz exchanged one of his notebooks he fills with drawings, sketches, and ramblings for a bag of what I have to assume to be Drugs,I don’t know what the exchange rate between the two is, but based on the sag to the bag, it had to have been high.

Eventually, a helicopter swooned in, Dima was calling out the Model information down to the Specifications of the Weapon mounting system, where Heinz picked up where he left off to list out what heavy Weapons and explosives could be mounted, but as far as I or you are concerned, it was a CH-46 Cargo Helicopter, filled with Equipment, Personnel, Cages, and even The Colonel, who if you remember in the introduction, is one of the Highest officials in \\\[The Parent Organization\\\], I think I’m supposed to omit some details but when he’s a bit more relevant in a Story, I’ll give some idea of what he’s like. They rounded up every Corpse, some were kept in body bags once the Anomalous Division guys started culling the infected, but even the ash, bones, and stuff in the pockets of everyone who was burned was packed up. Now I know I had said ‘I’m just a guy who hasn’t died yet’, but my Squad is actually highly decorated, and have personally met the eccentric Director of the Anomalous Research Division of The Department, so I recognized him when he stepped out with The Colonel, chatting as they oversaw the operation to clean up the mess, I swear they looked at me on multiple occasions, but there’s so many people around and we had work assigned to speed up the process.

I have a deadline to submit at least SOMETHING to The Department, but for now, there you go, a Story, do what you like with it, Next one I’m thinking about submitting is about that time we got teleported to Chernobyl. The guys who are collecting these stories said they might be able to collect responses to what’s sent over, but clearly, this is all just experimental, low impact stuff, so hopefully no one in the Past-Present or whatever you’d call it takes this Too seriously, but damn it’d be cool to receive messages someone, or even myself (13 12 year old me, I think if it’s around 2020) from the past like a Time Capsule.
