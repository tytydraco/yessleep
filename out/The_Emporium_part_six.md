*SATURDAY*

Saturdays bring a special kind of weirdness to the closing shift. The store is usually pretty dead on the weekends, but don't be fooled. Doesn't mean you won't see your fair share of action around here. 

Bob comes in to close with me tonight, but he's not much of a help, considering he's not fully corporeal. You see, Bob died about 6 years ago, but he keeps coming in for his shift every Saturday night, without fail. Something about his contract not being up yet. At least he's reliable.

Usually, by this part of the week, this place really starts getting to me and I'm itching for my day off. But, for some strange reason, not today. Guess it's easier to just accept your fate than to try to fight against it, am I right?

I'm already clocked in, so I don't bother with the time clock. Maybe they won't notice and just pay me for those extra hours, since they've stolen so much from me already. Doubtful, but a guy can hope. I head to the back, and as soon as I walk into the warehouse, Bob materializes in front of me, and I nearly jump out of my skin. 

"God dammit, Bob!" I yell. 

"Sorry man, didn't mean to scare you..." He says. 

Bullshit. That's *exactly* what he meant to do. Since Bob is only able to touch things sometimes, the motherfucker does whatever he can to affect the world around him, including scaring the shit out of me every chance he gets. I should be used to it by now, but lately he's been getting more creative with his little pop-ups. I shrug it off and grab my cart. 

Bob can also choose who sees him and who doesn't. So he uses that opportunity to make me look like a jackass in front of the customers on occasion. Not that I care what they think of me. In fact, it's better if they think I'm stupid, so they don't ask me so many questions. Still, it's a little embarrassing to be seen arguing with an empty space of air. 

Today is paper product stocking day. All of the napkins, Kleenex, toilet paper and paper towels need to be restocked for the week ahead. It's all very lightweight stuff, so Bob *should* be able to help with at least some of it. I quickly load up the first cart with napkins, then rush out onto the sales floor before they can start changing into centipedes. 

Bob follows behind me, playfully knocking some of the packages off my cart as we go. As soon as they hit the floor, they begin to crawl off. By the time I get to the shelf, I only have one remaining pack of napkins on my cart out of the 30 I stacked on there. Oh well. Looks like the Turd Slug's gonna be eating good tonight; the napkinpedes are one of its favorite snacks. 

It's much colder in here tonight than usual, presumably due to Bob's presence. My breath keeps turning into fog; it's like I'm standing in the damn freezer for Christ's sake. Even The Man Who Walks In Circles is shivering. Seems like I was wrong about him having zero perception of the world around him. Also, it's raining outside today, so the ceiling is dripping, as expected. I grab the bucket and set it under the drip, but when the rainwater hits the pink stuff from Thursday, it starts to sizzle. Odd. Well, onto the Kleenex now. 

To save time, I ask Bob to start on the paper towels. Once we finish all this stocking, we can fuck around till close, and after the week I've had, I deserve it. While I'm loading my cart, Bob is struggling with his. He was only able to grab ahold of every other roll he tried to. Took him so long, that the ones he *had* stacked on his cart were now a pile of fish flopping around. Guess the paper towels aren't getting filled tonight. 

I can't hear The Hum at all anymore. Thank God it's finally gone away, it's only been 10 years of this bullshit. Corporate must have sent someone out to fix the speakers. I definitely won't miss it, but now I'll have to start wearing a watch to tell me when it's time for break. I finish up my cart and grab my food.

Lenny is hanging out in the breakroom, but he's not eating. Instead, he's clipping his toenails and feeding them to The Turd Slug, as if it hadn't already eaten enough tonight. He extends out a handful of goo covered clippings, and asks if I want any. I tell him no thanks, I've lost my appetite. 

I get back from my break, and Bob has disappeared. I walk the whole store looking for him, but I can't find him anywhere. I know he didn't leave early, because he's contractually obligated to stay for his whole shift. So, I'm sure he'll show up somewhere soon though, probably when I least expect it. Speaking of things that are missing, I realize I haven't seen Duffle Bag Man come in here yet. Maybe I scared him off for good this time. Either that, or he ran out of shit to sprinkle in here. 

Meanwhile, on aisle 13, The Spill That Never Dries has reached new proportions. It's covering over half of the entire aisle... and it seems to be pulsating, like it's got a heartbeat. It's even starting to bubble too, so I'm pretty sure it's breathing on its own. I throw a wet floor sign at it, and The Spill engulfs it immediately, gobbling it up in a single bite. It lets out a huge burp, and I run away before the smell can get to me.

I decide to go up front and check on Adam, and lo and behold, Bob's possessed him. I'm not surprised; it's not like it's the first time this has happened. Adam's little 'condition' makes him more susceptible to this sort of thing. And, I'm sure it's Bob and not Adam in there, because the fucker is way too happy to be touching things. At least it's keeping both of them occupied for the time being. I finish the last cart of backstock and head to the warehouse. Time to fuck around till close. 

Tonight I accomplished a task I never thought I'd be able to do. I was finally able to coax The Fart Cloud into a glass jar, using the right bait. I used to try to catch it all the time back when I first started. But this time, after all these years, it seems I've finally figured out the perfect formula.

As soon as I get the lid closed, before I can even celebrate, Bob appears in front of me. Jolted, I cling to the jar tightly, and Bob asks me what I'm up to. I tell him I've caught The Fart Cloud and that I'm about to go bring it to the back for safe keeping. He insists on helping, saying he feels bad that I've been working so hard tonight and he's accomplished nothing.

"*Don't* let it hit the ground, Bob. I'm serious."

"I won't." He promises.

I go to gently place the jar into his hands, and, of course, it falls right through them. It hits the ground hard and shatters instantly, releasing the now irate Fart Cloud right into my face. Bob smiles, and I vomit. You know what? I can't even be mad; it's my fault for trusting him. 

Before I know it, I hear the closing announcement come through on the intercom. Geez, tonight went by fast... I'm usually already up front by the time they're making it. I clock Bob out first, then myself. When I punch my number in, the display reads: 

*Twenty-four hours have been deducted from your time, due to time theft. Have a nice day!*

Fucking hypocrite. Oh well, only one more [day](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/wVbQ3br4Zj) to go.
