I’m still in highschool, so yes, I know how this sounds.

“It was probably a raccoon.”

“You two were just spooked.”

“Camping does weird things to your brain.”

I’d say the same thing if I wasn’t the one who still can’t sleep with my door cracked open. If I wasn’t the one who had to lie to an urgent care nurse about how I got the bite on my forearm and the bruises on my throat.

And if I wasn’t the one who watched my best friend stand outside his tent in the dark, perfectly still, listening to something that wasn’t there.

We went camping because it was supposed to be normal.

Not “survival” camping. Not off-grid. A real campground with numbered sites, a bathroom building that smelled like pine cleaner and old water, and a trail map kiosk full of sun-faded flyers. The kind of place your parents don’t freak out about because there are other families around and the ranger drives through once or twice.

It was just me and my best friend. I’ll call him J.

We picked a Friday because he’d been on my case all week. School, sports, college stuff, constant noise. J’s whole thing was that the woods were like hitting reset.

“Two nights,” he told me, tossing his pack into my trunk like he lived there. “No phones unless we need them. Campfire food. You’ll stop being weird.”

I was being weird, apparently, because I kept checking my phone like someone was going to text me news that would change my life. I didn’t even know what I was waiting for. I just felt restless.

The campground was about an hour from town. Mostly highway, then a turn onto a two-lane road that cut through trees and little pockets of lake cabins. We drove with the windows cracked. The air smelled clean and sharp and made me feel stupid for spending so much time indoors.

At the entrance, there was a sign with the park name and a smaller sign underneath that said QUIET HOURS 10PM–6AM.

There was a self-pay station. We put cash in an envelope and tore off the stub like the sign told us. I remember that detail because the stub got stuck to my sweaty thumb and wouldn’t come off.

Site 14 was tucked back a bit from the main loop. Trees on three sides, a little gravel pad, a fire ring, and a picnic table with old carvings in it. You could hear other people, but you couldn’t see them unless you walked toward the road.

J loved it immediately.

“Perfect,” he said, like he was approving a hotel room. “Nobody right on top of us.”

We set up in the late afternoon. Two tents, not one. That was my rule, because J snores and I’m not trying to listen to that in a nylon bubble.

He put his tent closer to the tree line, partially shaded. I set mine a little more open near the table. We made a small fire, ate hot dogs like we were ten again, and sat there until the sky turned that deep blue you only get out of town.

Everything felt fine. Easy. Like my brain had finally unclenched.

Around 9:30, J got quiet.

Not in a “deep thoughts” way. In a distracted way.

He kept looking past me toward the darker part of the site, the strip of trees behind his tent.

“You hear that?” he asked.

I listened. Crickets. A distant laugh from another campsite. The soft hiss of our fire.

“Hear what.”

He shrugged. “Thought I heard… something.”

“Like what. An animal?”

He poked the fire with a stick so hard sparks jumped. “Like someone walking.”

That made me laugh, but it came out nervous. “Dude, it’s a campground. There are people.”

“Not back there,” he said, and pointed.

Past his tent was just woods. No trail. No path. The ground dropped slightly and disappeared into brush.

“It’s probably a deer,” I said.

He nodded like he accepted it, but he kept looking anyway.

We killed the fire properly. Water, stir, water again. J was weird about that, which I actually appreciated because half the kids our age think you just kick dirt on it and go to sleep.

We went to our tents.

I lay on my back staring at the dark shape of nylon above me, listening to the normal nighttime soundtrack. A few minutes passed. Then more.

I was right on the edge of falling asleep when I heard it.

A zipper.

Not mine.

From J’s side of the site.

A slow, careful zip.

I sat up and listened. Sometimes you wake up to pee. Sometimes you realize you left something out.

Then I heard soft footsteps in the gravel.

J moving around outside his tent.

I checked my phone out of habit. 11:47.

I was about to call his name when a sound snapped the thought right out of my head.

A noise from the tree line behind J’s tent.

Not a branch breaking. Not leaves rustling.

A low, wet clicking.

Like someone tapping their tongue against their teeth, slow and deliberate.

I froze.

My mind did that thing where it tries to pick the least scary option. A frog. A bird. Some weird insect.

But it didn’t sound like an animal I’d ever heard. It sounded too… intentional.

Then I heard J’s voice, muffled but close.

“Hey,” he whispered.

It wasn’t directed at me.

It was directed at the woods.

I pushed my tent zipper down a few inches and peeked out.

The campground lights didn’t reach our site. It was mostly moonlight and the faint glow from other people’s campfires in the distance.

J was standing barefoot in the gravel in his shorts and hoodie, shoulders hunched, facing the tree line.

“J,” I whispered, trying to keep my voice low. “What are you doing?”

He didn’t look back at me right away.

His head tilted slightly, like he was listening.

Then he said, still aimed toward the woods, “I thought someone was messing with my tent.”

“Who would do that?”

He finally turned his head. Moonlight caught his face in pieces. His eyes looked too open.

“I heard it,” he said. “Like… something right here.”

I was about to tell him to get back in his tent when the clicking happened again, louder, deeper in the trees.

J’s shoulders rose like he was bracing.

And then, from somewhere back there, something made a sound that almost, almost matched his breathing.

A long inhale.

A long exhale.

My stomach dropped.

“Okay,” I said, louder now. “Nope. Get in your tent. Right now.”

J didn’t move.

He took one step toward the trees.

“J,” I said, sharp. “Stop.”

He stopped, but it wasn’t because he listened to me. It was because the trees moved.

Not like wind.

Like something shifting weight behind them.

A silhouette passed between trunks, too tall to be a deer, too smooth to be a bear. I only saw it for a second, but that second stuck like a thorn in my brain.

It looked thin.

It looked wrong.

J backed up one step, then another, like his body finally decided it didn’t like what his brain was curious about.

“Did you see that?” he whispered.

“Get in your tent,” I said. My voice shook. I hated that.

He moved fast then, stumbling into his tent and yanking the zipper up hard like that would stop whatever was out there. I zipped mine shut too and clicked my headlamp on, like light made me safer.

The clicking stopped.

The woods went quiet.

Not normal quiet. Not “late night” quiet.

The crickets stopped.

The distant voices from other campsites faded until it felt like we were the only two people left in the park.

I sat there with my headlamp off, breathing carefully, listening for anything.

A full minute passed.

Then another.

Then, very softly, I heard something brush the side of J’s tent.

Not a scratch.

A drag.

Like a hand sliding along fabric.

J whispered my name. “Dude.”

I crawled to the edge of my tent and put my ear against the nylon.

The sound moved around his tent slowly, circling.

Then it stopped at the back, right near the trees.

Silence.

And then J’s tent zipper started to move.

Very slowly.

From the outside.

I felt my whole body go cold.

J’s voice came again, high and tight. “That’s not me.”

I didn’t think. I grabbed my headlamp, clicked it on, and unzipped my tent.

The beam cut across the gravel and hit J’s tent.

The zipper was halfway down.

J was inside, sitting up, his face lit through the mesh. I could see both his hands. He was gripping his sleeping bag like he was trying to anchor himself.

Something outside his tent let the zipper go.

The tent flap fell open like a mouth.

The headlamp beam swept the opening.

Nothing there.

But the air smelled different all at once. Like wet pennies. Like something that had been in water too long.

“J,” I said, forcing calm. “Get out. Get in my tent. Now.”

He scrambled, half crawling out, not even bothering with shoes. He sprinted across the gravel and dove into my tent like it was a bunker.

I zipped it up behind him, hands shaking so bad I caught the fabric wrong and had to try again.

J was breathing like he’d been running for miles.

“What was that,” he whispered.

“I don’t know,” I whispered back.

We listened.

Nothing.

I sat there thinking, okay, we call a ranger. We go to the car. We leave. All the logical options lined up like steps.

Then J leaned close to the tent wall, listening hard, and whispered, “It’s still out there.”

“How do you know.”

He didn’t answer me right away.

He just kept his ear pressed to the nylon like he was waiting for a secret.

Then he said, “It’s… copying.”

My mouth went dry. “Copying what.”

He swallowed. “The zipper. The breathing. Like it’s practicing.”

I wanted to say he was freaking himself out. I wanted to say it was an animal and animals do weird things.

But my brain kept replaying that silhouette between the trees. The way the woods had gone dead quiet like everything alive was holding still.

I pulled my phone out. One bar. Barely.

I tried calling the park number printed on the pay stub. It rang once, then cut out.

I tried again. Same thing.

J watched me like my phone was going to solve it. When it didn’t, his expression shifted into something I didn’t recognize. Not panic. Something flatter.

“Maybe it wants us to come out,” he said.

“What.”

“Maybe it’s like… testing,” he whispered. “To see if we’ll chase it.”

My skin crawled.

“Stop talking like that,” I said. “We’re leaving. As soon as it’s quiet, we go to the car.”

J nodded, but he kept listening.

Minutes passed. Maybe twenty. My phone battery dropped fast because the cold made it angry.

Finally, the normal night sounds started to creep back in. Crickets again. A faint voice from another campsite. Something that sounded like a car door in the distance.

I took that as permission.

“Now,” I whispered.

We unzipped the tent and stepped out.

The air felt colder than it had earlier. The fire ring was just a dark circle. The trees behind J’s tent were a wall of black.

We moved fast toward the car.

It was parked near the loop road, maybe thirty yards from our site, but it felt like crossing open water in shark territory.

My keys were in my pocket. I gripped them so hard the metal dug into my palm.

Halfway to the car, J stopped.

I turned. “What are you doing.”

He was staring at his tent.

Not at the woods. At the tent itself, like it was a person.

“I left my phone,” he said.

“Forget it.”

“It’s in there,” he said, like he hadn’t heard me.

I started to argue, but then I realized something.

His tent zipper was open again.

We had left it zipped.

I knew we had. I remembered yanking it up.

J stared at the open flap, breathing slow.

Then he took a step back toward it.

“J,” I said, low and urgent. “No.”

He didn’t look at me. He just kept walking like he was pulled by a string.

I grabbed his wrist.

His skin was cold. Too cold.

He snapped his head toward me and for a second his face didn’t look like his. Not in a supernatural way. In a sick way. Like his features were in the right places but his expression didn’t match.

“Let go,” he said.

“Are you serious right now.”

“I need it,” he said, and his voice was calm in a way that made my stomach twist.

I tightened my grip. “We can get it tomorrow in daylight. We can ask a ranger. We’re leaving.”

He stared at my hand on his wrist like he was considering it.

Then he yanked away hard enough that I stumbled.

“Fine,” he said, and turned back to the tent.

I followed because I’m an idiot, because he’s my best friend, because leaving him alone felt impossible.

We reached his tent.

The opening gaped toward us.

J leaned in and shined his phone flashlight into it.

The beam lit up his sleeping bag, his backpack, the inside seam.

No phone.

He stared at the empty tent like it had betrayed him.

Then he said, very softly, “It took it.”

My throat tightened. “Took what.”

He didn’t answer.

He turned his head slowly toward the trees behind the tent.

And smiled.

It was small and wrong. Like he was sharing a joke with something I couldn’t see.

“J,” I said, and my voice sounded far away to me. “Stop.”

He stepped into the tent.

I grabbed his hoodie, but he twisted out of it, smooth and fast. Too fast.

He crawled further in like he was going after something.

I didn’t want to follow him inside. Everything in my body screamed not to put myself in that narrow space.

So I reached in and grabbed his ankle.

He went still.

For half a second, the whole campground felt like it held its breath with me.

Then J kicked backward.

His heel caught my forearm hard. I hissed and let go.

He shot out of the tent like he’d been launched, not stumbling, not scrambling, just a sudden burst of movement.

He landed on his feet in the gravel and looked at me.

His eyes were glassy.

His mouth was slightly open, like he was tasting the air.

“J,” I said, softer now. “We need to go. Please.”

He didn’t respond like my friend.

He tilted his head the same way he had earlier when he listened to the woods.

Then, behind him, the clicking started again.

Deeper in the trees.

Slow. Patient.

J’s shoulders relaxed like that sound was familiar. Like it was a signal.

And then he moved.

He lunged at me.

No warning. No hesitation.

His hands went straight for my throat.

I got my arms up, but he was stronger than he should’ve been. Not bodybuilder strong. Desperate strong. Like his whole body had one instruction and it was to put me on the ground.

We went down in the gravel.

The impact knocked the air out of me. Rocks bit into my back through my hoodie.

J’s fingers closed around my neck.

His skin was freezing.

I clawed at his wrists, trying to pry him off, trying to breathe.

His face was inches from mine and his expression wasn’t angry.

It was focused.

Like he was doing a task.

I tried to yell his name but it came out as a choked sound.

My vision started to tunnel. The edges went dark.

Then I did the only thing I could think of.

I jammed my thumb into his eye.

He jerked back with a sound that was half scream, half that wet clicking.

His grip loosened.

I sucked air and rolled hard, gravel scraping my palms.

I got my feet under me and stumbled backward.

J came up too.

But he didn’t rush me right away.

He stood there, head tilted, blinking fast, like his brain was resetting.

Then he smiled again.

And he made the clicking sound himself.

Not from his throat exactly.

From his mouth. Tongue against teeth.

In the tree line behind him, something shifted.

A shape moved between trunks, taller than J, thin enough that it looked like it could fold itself in half and disappear.

It didn’t come forward.

It just watched.

J turned toward it like he was waiting for permission.

I ran.

Not to the car. Not at first.

Because the car was out in the open and I didn’t know if that thing would cut me off.

I ran toward the bathroom building because there were lights. There were cameras, maybe. There were other people, hopefully.

My lungs burned. My throat hurt. I could taste blood.

Behind me, I heard J’s footsteps.

Fast. Bare feet slapping gravel.

He was chasing me.

I glanced back once and saw him moving like he didn’t care about rocks cutting his feet. Like pain didn’t register.

I hit the road, sprinted past another campsite where a couple adults were sitting at a fire, and my brain wanted to scream at them to help me.

But nothing came out. My throat was too messed up.

I just ran.

The bathroom building lights came into view. I slammed into the door so hard it bounced off the stop.

Inside, the fluorescent lights were brutal. The air smelled like soap and damp concrete.

I turned and shoved the door shut.

It didn’t lock. Of course it didn’t.

I grabbed the trash can by the sink and wedged it under the handle, then grabbed a bench and shoved it against the door too.

My hands were shaking so hard I could barely do it.

Then I backed away and stared at the door, waiting for J to hit it.

He did.

Not once.

Not twice.

A series of impacts, like he was ramming it with his shoulder, then stopping, then doing it again.

The trash can rattled. The bench scraped.

I stumbled backward into the stalls, breathing hard.

“J,” I rasped, voice barely there. “Stop.”

Silence.

Then a softer sound near the door.

Scratching.

Not frantic. Slow.

Like fingernails testing.

And then, J’s voice, right outside.

“Open up,” he said.

It sounded like him.

It sounded exactly like him.

But the timing was wrong. The tone was wrong. Like someone had recorded his voice saying “open up” a hundred times and was playing it now to see if it worked.

I stared at the door like it might change shape.

“Please,” the voice said. “I’m hurt.”

I almost answered. I almost did. Because my brain wanted it to be my friend so badly it hurt.

Then the voice added, very softly, “You left me.”

J would never say that.

Not like that.

Not in that moment.

The scratching started again.

Then the clicking.

And then the voice, again, closer, like his face was right against the gap.

“Open up.”

I backed deeper into the bathroom, pulled out my phone with shaking hands, and called 911 even though my service was barely there.

It rang.

Once.

Twice.

Then it connected.

I tried to speak, but my throat came out shredded. I could barely force words.

“I’m at the campground,” I wheezed. “My friend… he’s… he attacked me. He’s outside the bathroom building.”

The dispatcher asked me where exactly. I gave her the park name off the pay stub. I gave her what I thought was the loop number. I was crying without realizing it.

Behind me, the bathroom door shook again.

The trash can clanged.

The dispatcher told me to stay inside. Told me officers were on the way.

I didn’t tell her about the clicking. I didn’t tell her about the silhouette. I didn’t tell her that my friend’s voice sounded like someone wearing his face.

Because I wanted help, not pity.

The impacts stopped.

Silence fell so fast it made my ears ring.

I stared at the door until my eyes burned.

Then I heard footsteps walking away.

Slow.

Not running.

Like something had decided to be patient.

I stayed in that bathroom for what felt like forever.

When the park ranger and two deputies finally showed up, I burst out like a trapped animal. The ranger asked where my friend was. The deputies asked if we’d been drinking. If drugs were involved.

I shook my head so hard it made my bruised throat throb.

I kept saying his name. Kept pointing toward our site.

They went with flashlights and radios. I followed because I couldn’t not.

When we got back, my tent was still there. J’s tent was still there.

But J was gone.

The ranger shined his light into the woods behind the tent.

There were bare footprints in the dirt, leading away.

And beside them, deeper impressions that didn’t look like feet at all.

Long marks. Parallel ridges. Like something dragged the edge of something hard through the ground.

The ranger went very still when he saw those.

He didn’t say what he thought.

He just told the deputies to call for more units.

They found J’s hoodie in the brush, snagged on a branch, torn at the shoulder like it had been yanked off in a hurry.

They found his phone too.

Not in the tent.

Not in the dirt.

It was propped on a stump just inside the tree line, screen cracked, camera open.

The last photo on it was a blurry image of our campsite from behind the trees.

Taken from the woods.

From the angle where that silhouette had been.

And in the corner of the photo, lit by the faint glow of the bathroom building far away, you could see me running.

You could see J behind me.

And above J, just barely, you could see something taller, thin enough that it looked like it was made of sticks and shadow, leaning down toward him like it was whispering.

The ranger took the phone and told me to sit down.

He told me the search would continue. He told me not to go back into the woods. He told me to breathe.

I sat on the picnic table shaking, hands scraped raw, throat burning, and watched flashlights cut through the trees.

They never found J that night.

They never found him the next day either.

His parents showed up. More rangers. Dogs. People who looked like they did this kind of thing for a living.

They found some blood in the gravel where he’d grabbed my throat. They found more blood farther down the loop road, drops like he’d been bleeding from his feet.

And then the trail stopped near the creek behind our site.

Not like it faded.

Like it ended.

Like he’d stepped off solid ground and vanished.

I went home with bruises around my neck and a bite mark on my forearm I didn’t remember getting. The urgent care nurse asked if it was a dog. I said yes because it was the closest lie that fit.

I told everyone J probably ran. That he panicked and ran and got lost.

I said that because the truth makes people look at you like you’re contagious.

But here’s why I’m writing this.

Three nights after we got back, my phone lit up at 2:17 AM with a text from J’s number.

Just one line.

open up

I stared at it until my eyes watered.

Then another message came.

i’m hurt

Then another.

you left me

I didn’t respond.

I turned my phone off.

I sat in my bed in the dark listening.

And outside my bedroom door, very softly, like someone practicing, I heard a slow, wet clicking.
