So first let me start by saying, for obvious reasons, I won’t say what I think their names are because maybe I imagined it all 

Second, I’m 99.9% sure I was wide awake and fully lucid. I don’t do drugs and rarely drink.

Third, I just wanna say that I know it’s weird and say what you want, but I experienced it and it fucking creeps me out to this day.

About a year ago, me and two friends went to New Orleans for Marti Gras. It sucked honestly because it was cold and rainy and a lot of the shops were enforcing the six foot rule and masks. We found a shop that let us take our masks off if we sat in the back, since we were by ourselves and it was locally owned. Cool. 

My two friends are dating, a guy and girl, and I’m a girl. I’m also in love with him. And she leaned her head on his shoulder and said she was tired and he kissed her forehead. And I thought to myself that I’d give anything for love like that. And when he started petting her hair, I realized I had to go because I was just gonna stare and feel weird. So I lied and said I was tired. They offered to drop me off and I was like nah, I’ll Uber, thanks though. I walked away and put my jacket on, which I had hung up. And I saw them again and I thought to myself that seriously, I’d do anything for love like that.

I walked out to order my Uber but saw that I had no signal. I walked over to a lit park nearby. It was in full view of the road and shops and there were benches and lanterns. I felt safe to sit. 

Once I sat down though, I felt hot. My first thought was that it was the lanterns and then I thought maybe there’s a heater somewhere I’m not seeing, but I didn’t feel toasty or warm. I felt hot. Immediately. I was already sticky sweating. So I decided to just deal with it until the Uber came but I still had no signal. I stood up to go to a different bench, when I saw faded yellow eyes. 

Looking at me from across the park. It was in an area that was really dark and the eyes were floating pretty high up. Then I started laughing because I thought it was someone’s costume. I tried to order my Uber again and then remembered I didn’t have a signal. 

I remember laughing almost immediately to myself, because I suddenly thought that of course I have to go the way of the orange eyes because of course they planned for the bad signal. So I decided I’d go try. It’s still in view of the shops and the lanterns are relatively near. 

So I’m tapping on my phone trying for a signal and I see the orange eyes looking at me. And then they blink. I bust out laughing and call out,” Hey! Cool eyes! They’re so creepy, I love them! “

“ Hey thanks. They’re mine.” 

Weirdly the voice sounded familiar, but I was still thinking about my phone and safety as a woman. 

“ Please don’t mind me, just trying to grab a signal. “ 

“ Eh heh heh heh, that’s on me. Tech goes funny when I’m around. “ 

I didn’t fully grasp that one. My phone sorta blipped and I had never seen that  and I was more concerned about that for some ungodly reason. So I gave up finally. 

“ Okay, well, I’m gonna go try a shop and see if the WiFi’s better. Have a good night!” 

“ Stick around kiddo. “ 

Now I looked up at the orange eyes and didn’t see them. I looked around and still didn’t see them. But then I felt really, really hot all of a sudden and thought the blackness in front of me was blacker. Darker. And so I angled my head up, and I was literally looking up at the orange eyes, and they were looking down on me.

The pupils were like quarters and round and black. 

I stepped back and that’s finally when I put my phone in my back pocket. I said,” Oh, um, excuse me. “ 

He said,” Look, kid, I’m a little busy. You want the boy or not?” 

And I went,” What?” 

“ You said you’d give anything for him. And you’d do anything for him. Which is exactly the kinda thing I like.” 

I wasn’t scared anymore. Just confused. 

But he goes,” The boy. You want him or not?” 

And then suddenly it clicks. 

“ You uh, know about what I thought?” 

“ Sure. Only if someone means it, though. Now yes or no? The boys are getting antsy. “

“ Are you being dirty?” 

His eyes got bigger and rounder and his pupils shrunk and THAT’S when I see the mouth! Very faint. But weird thin lips and sharp spiky teeth . Almost smoky. 

I think he grinned but he easily could have dramatically and theatrically made a Gimmie a break, Jesus Christ, wtf kinda face. 

And that’s when the idiot gear kicked in and I finally turned around to go. But then I saw two sets of orange eyes looking at me. About twenty feet away. One pair was small and Beady the others may have bulged. They were bigger anyway, more nervous looking. They were also moving. 

“ Uh. What are-“ 

“ SAY HIIIIIII BOOOOOYYSSS!” 

I jumped and the eyes just blinked at me. 

I started to walk myself into a run and then he goes,” Look honey, if you wanna give me something, I like truths but if you wanna do something, you’re gonna haveta hang with me for a while like my last gal.” 

And that’s when I started running back to the restaurant. I ran as fast as I could and I heard him call out,” THAT’S NOT A PROBLEM , IS IT?” 

I didn’t hear any laughter and I didn’t turn around. But I suddenly felt the chilly night again and jumped when I felt something hit my head. And then I remembered immediately THAT IT HAD BEEN RAINING WHEN I LEFT!

I went back to my friends and said I changed my mind. I never saw the eyes again, but I can hear the voice in my head. 

" Only if someone means it, though. " 

Anyway, maybe you should skip New Orleans.
