I’m typing this with my left thumb because my other hand is wrapped so thick it looks like a winter mitten.

If you’ve ever crawled into a cave you shouldn’t have, you already know the first lie you tell yourself is that you’re doing it “safely.”

We weren’t.

We were just careful enough to feel responsible. Helmets. Two headlamps each. Mine was a Black Diamond Spot that still had the price sticker on the battery door because I’m lazy. Each of us had a tiny backup light in a pocket, a cheap rope, and a first aid kit the size of a paperback that made us feel grown-up.

It was my idea. That part matters.

We heard about the cave the usual way. Somebody’s cousin knew somebody who “used to go in there all the time.” The location was given to us like a dare, not like directions. A pull-off with no sign, a thin trail that looked like deer made it, and then a hole in limestone you could miss if you weren’t looking for it.

No gate. No posted signs. Nothing that said keep out. We told ourselves that meant it was fine.

We parked in a gravel patch that had room for maybe two cars. The kind of place where the weeds are taller than your bumper and there’s always a crushed soda can and a beer bottle in the brush. No trailhead map. No register box. Just trees and quiet.

We did the thing where you stand at the entrance and kill your lights for a minute so your eyes stop fighting the dark.

That’s when we heard it.

Breathing.

Not a drip. Not water moving. Not a bat flutter. It sounded like someone breathing through their nose, slow and calm, like they were asleep just inside the rock.

My friend clicked his light on and swept the entrance. The beam caught wet stone and pale dust and nothing else.

“Air moving,” he whispered, like the cave cared.

I nodded because I wanted it to be air.

We turned our lights off again and listened.

The breathing stopped.

That should’ve been enough.

Instead, I laughed, the dumb kind of laugh you do when you’re trying to make your body unclench, and I said, “Okay. Weird. Let’s go.”

The cave swallowed light in a way that didn’t feel normal. It wasn’t just dark. It felt absorbent, like your beam hit the walls and didn’t bounce back the way it should.

The entrance narrowed fast. We ducked, then crouched, then moved in that half-walk, half-squat that makes your thighs burn. The floor shifted from gritty rock to mud that grabbed your boots and made little sucking sounds every time you lifted your feet.

After a while, the air stopped smelling like outside. No leaves, no cold breeze, no anything. Just stone and damp.

We dropped through a squeeze into a wider chamber and stood up like we’d earned it. It was big enough to stand in comfortably, with a dark passage on the far side that looked like a throat.

That’s where the smell hit us.

Not “cave smell.” Not damp mineral.

This was sweet and sour at the same time, like old meat left in a freezer after the power goes out. It stuck to the back of my tongue. It made me swallow even though swallowing didn’t help.

My friend covered his nose with his sleeve. “I don’t like that.”

I didn’t answer right away because I was listening.

Every cave has a rhythm. Drips. Distant water. Little ticks. A low constant background that keeps you from noticing how quiet it really is.

This chamber had none of that.

Then, from somewhere in that far passage, we heard a soft scrape.

Not loud. Not sudden. Just the sound of something being pulled across rock.

I snapped my light toward the passage. The beam shook because my hand was already starting to tremble.

Nothing. Just stone.

The scrape happened again. Closer this time. Low to the ground.

My friend took a step back and his boot skidded in the mud. “Turn around.”

We had a rule. If either of us says “turn around,” we turn around. No arguing. No ego.

I broke the rule by taking one stupid step toward the far passage, like getting closer would turn fear into curiosity.

The scrape stopped.

Silence pressed in.

Then came a small wet click. Like a tongue against teeth. Like someone trying to imitate a sound they’d heard a human make.

My friend didn’t whisper this time. “We’re leaving.”

We turned.

The squeeze we’d come through looked different from this side. That happens underground. Your brain files the shape away wrong, then hands it back to you like a bad memory.

My friend went first because he’s smaller. I followed, flattening myself into the gap. Helmet scraping stone. Breath loud in my own ears. My headlamp beam jittering across rock inches from my face.

We were halfway through when something touched my ankle.

Not a brush. Not a bump.

A grip.

Cold. Dry. Pressure like fingers, but too long. Too many points of contact.

I kicked hard. My boot hit something that felt like knotted cord stretched over bone.

The grip tightened.

I yelled my friend’s name and the sound ricocheted off the cave walls until it turned into pure panic noise.

My friend’s boots scuffed faster ahead of me. “GO,” he shouted. “GO GO.”

The thing on my leg yanked.

I slid backward an inch.

In a squeeze that tight, an inch is a mile.

I twisted and kicked again. The grip slid higher, past my boot, against my calf, and I felt a sharp sting, then warmth.

It was cutting me. Not with a blade. With something rough and hard, dragging across skin.

One of my hands came free. I reached back blindly, grabbing at whatever had me.

My fingers hit hair. Thin hair, wet with cave moisture, stuck to something that felt like skin stretched too tight.

I jerked my hand away and it came back with a few pale strands stuck to my glove.

Panic hit like a switch flipping. I surged forward with everything I had. Helmet banging rock hard enough to spark my vision. Shoulders scraping. Hips catching. Ribs grinding against stone.

The grip slipped, caught, then tore away.

When I burst out of the squeeze, I slammed onto my hands and knees in the mud and sucked air like it was my first breath.

My friend grabbed the strap of my pack and yanked me upright. “Don’t look,” he said.

I looked anyway.

My headlamp beam swung back to the squeeze.

At first, nothing.

Then something pressed into the gap from inside, not coming out, just pushing forward like it was testing the space. Pale, not white, more like the color of old fat. The surface looked wet but didn’t drip. A mouth, too wide, packed with small teeth. Not predator teeth. More like someone crammed too many human teeth into one place.

No eyes that I could see. Just smooth skin catching the edge of my light.

It made that wet click again and breathed in through something that might have been a nose.

The same breathing we’d heard at the entrance.

My friend yanked me away so hard my neck snapped back.

We ran.

My leg throbbed and every step sent a bright pulse up my calf. Warm wetness soaked my sock. Behind us, the scrape followed, sometimes close, sometimes far, never gone.

We hit another low squeeze and dropped to our bellies.

The scrape behind us changed. Faster. A shuffle. Like it had decided.

Something hit the back of my boot. Then my injured calf.

The texture came through my pants: hard ridges under thin skin. It didn’t feel like muscle. It felt like something that shouldn’t bend, bending anyway.

I kicked back on instinct and my heel landed against something that felt like a jaw.

It clamped.

Not a deep bite. A hold. Teeth pressing through fabric into skin, enough to flash my vision white.

I screamed. Ugly, honest noise.

My friend reached back, grabbed my wrist, and pulled like he was trying to rip me out of the cave by force.

Stone scraped my ribs. My helmet snagged. My bad leg flared and I tasted metal in my mouth.

Then my boot tore free with a wet rip and I slid forward, dragging my leg through the narrow space while something behind me clicked and scraped at rock like it was frustrated.

We burst out into a sloping tunnel that led toward the entrance chamber. Fresher air hit my face in faint cold waves, the best thing I’ve ever felt.

We didn’t stop until we hit the first chamber, the one with old graffiti and muddy footprints from other people who’d turned around where we didn’t.

The gray smear of daylight was visible ahead.

For one second, I thought it was over.

Then the breathing started again, louder now, and it had something extra in it. A faint tremor, like excitement.

My friend kept a hand on my pack and pushed me forward. We hit the mouth of the cave and spilled into the trees and the normal world.

I fell onto leaves and dirt and lay there gulping air that suddenly felt too thin.

My friend stood a few feet away, staring at the entrance like he expected it to follow us.

I stared too.

The darkness inside didn’t move.

But right at the edge where stone met daylight, something shifted. Just enough for us to know it was there. A pale curve, the suggestion of a head leaning forward, testing light.

And then, from just inside the mouth, it made a sound that was almost a word.

My friend’s voice, but flattened and wrong, like someone wearing it.

“Leaving.”

My friend grabbed my arm and hauled me up. We half-walked, half-staggered back to the car. I don’t remember the trees. I remember the way my own breathing sounded too loud.

At the gravel pull-off, my friend sat me on the bumper and peeled my pant leg up.

Three long cuts ran down my calf where it had grabbed me first, like I’d been raked by rough stone. Below that, a crescent of shallow punctures where it had clamped. Too many. Too evenly spaced. Not like any animal bite I’ve seen.

He poured water from a plastic bottle over the cuts. The water ran pink, then bright red, then clear again.

We drove in silence.

I told a version of the truth later under fluorescent lights. I said I slipped in a tight spot. I said my leg hit rock. I said it was my fault.

The nurse didn’t look impressed. She cleaned the wounds, asked if my tetanus shot was up to date, and said, “You’re lucky it wasn’t worse,” in the same tone you’d use for someone who burned their hand on a stove.

They stitched what needed stitches. Wrapped what needed wrapping. Sent me home with instructions that had nothing to do with caves.

I tried to be normal about it.

I showered. I threw my clothes into the washer on hot. I scrubbed the mud out of my boots with an old toothbrush until the bristles bent.

When I cleaned the tread, I found a thin strand of pale hair stuck in the grooves. Almost clear. Like fishing line until you held it to light.

It wasn’t mine. It wasn’t my friend’s.

I flushed it because I didn’t want it in my house.

Last night, I woke up at 2:13 a.m. because I heard something.

Not footsteps. Not a voice. Not a movie sound through a wall.

Breathing.

Slow and calm, through a nose, coming from somewhere in the dark part of my home.

I held my breath and listened, waiting for it to stop the way it did at the cave entrance.

It didn’t stop.

It kept going, steady and quiet, like it was trying to match my rhythm.

I tried to be rational. Houses make noise. Vents breathe. Pipes tick. Brains do weird things when they’ve been scared.

Then I heard a small wet click.

It could have been anything. The heater. A settling sound. My imagination snapping to a familiar pattern.

But I didn’t move for a long time.

This morning, I found my boot by the door where I left it to dry.

The toothbrush I’d used was sitting inside it.

I do not remember putting it there.

That’s the only tangible thing I have, other than stitches and scars, and it’s almost nothing. It’s not proof. It’s just wrong.

If you’re the kind of person who thinks you can go underground and come back out unchanged, don’t.

Because I’m sitting here with my leg wrapped, trying to convince myself I’m safe, and I keep catching myself going quiet in my own home, like silence is a trick that might keep me alive.

And the worst part is I’m not sure anymore if the cave followed us.

Or if it only learned us well enough to live in my head.
