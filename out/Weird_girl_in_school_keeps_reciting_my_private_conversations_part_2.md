I’ve been doing intensive research on how Azra, the weird girl, could know my private conversations that she wasn’t a part of and recite them back to me word for word. All the answers didn’t make sense, some people commented on my first post that she could have bugged my phone. I really felt stupid that my mind would go to her microchipping me before installing a spyware on my phone! So this morning I kept my phone in a drawer and left to school without it, we’ll see tomorrow if she will recite any conversations from today. 

  
I went to school confident for the first time since her party because I finally found a logical explanation, my friends even commented about how I seemed “back to my old self” but then while I was on my way to the science lab on the top floor, I saw her standing in the middle of the staircase reciting my conversation with my friends just 20 minutes ago, a conversation that I had with them in a closed classroom that she was not in! I froze, her expression changed, she used to recite the conversations like a robot, no tone or expression just regurgitating words while staring at me angrily. Today she’s smirking, she’s copying the tone, the chuckles, the gasps, the sighs.. I was scared and most importantly angry, forget how, WHY is she doing this?! It’s been a full week of me feeling utterly violated, thinking twice before saying anything to anyone, searching myself for bugs and finally leaving my phone only to see that she’s enjoying every second of her torment! I pounced on her and pulled her hair with all my might while yelling at her to “FUCKING STOP” everyone around us panicked and started screaming and a teacher finally came in and took us both to the counselor’s office. 

  
I was still fuming, I looked down at my hands they were still rolled into fists and I was holding big clumps of her greasy hair, there is even some blood at the roots but I think I remember her smirking even while I was violently pulling her hair! My anger turned into fear, who is she? Or rather what is she?! what have I done? Why didn’t I just walk away like I always did? I started crying in panic, Ms. Linda, the counsellor, hung up the phone, apparently she was asking my parents to come.  
She looked at me with a smile: Now Anne, it’s your third year in this school and only your second time in my office, the first time was to organize a bake drive so I can safely assume that this is out of character of you, what happened between you two?  
I could feel Azra staring at me, it terrified me so I kept looking ahead at Ms. Linda and murmured sorry while crying.   
She turned her attention to Azra and asked her if she accepts my apology, I guess she nodded yes because Ms. Linda turned back to me and said that she still can’t ignore what happened and that she needs the full recount of the incident and what led to it. When I didn’t say another word she excused Azra and sat next to me, “Anne, nothing excuses what you did, but I’m sure you were reacting to something, what was it? I can only help you if I know.” I kept sobbing, I know she’s listening, I don’t know how, but I know she’s listening!   
About an hour later my mom came in, she spoke to Ms. Linda privately then drove me home. On the drive she told me that I’m suspended for a whole week, unless I’m ready to share details of what happened in which case I’ll only be suspended until Friday. I stayed quiet and my mom looked out of ideas, she was concerned and angry at the same time, I couldn't blame her but I couldn't talk to her either. My dad heard about the incident later in the day and decided to ground me for a week as well, he took my phone and tablet and only kept my laptop so I can catch up on school work.  

  
I literally have nothing else to do for a whole week so I will just keep researching to try to get an answer, I’ll keep you updated.
