So you have stepped foot on your journey to power. 

liars grace. The ability to intuitively grasp whether or not you are being lied to about information concerning yourself with a pang to your heart. 

Start: 
prerequisites-You need to have a likeable personality in some way. You Dont have to be a motivational speaker preaching to a choir every Sunday but if you find that people in your close circle would rather see you rot more than not... Well i think its in your best interest to hold off until you've built some better interpersonal skills.

materials needed - standard camping supplies that can last for a couple of days in the woods alone, including food and shelter. You can skip on self defense items if you so choose , you will not be needing them since for the most part you'll be the only thing their that can die. Flashlights can be ignored as well as visibility will be largely unaffected throughout your time their. Bring along with you toys, the more flashy and cool the better, focus on toys that Dont run on any form of internet service though. New Newspaper is another big plus, enough to fill a small bag should do just fine . 

Steps to find the forest- to get to legions forest , you simply need to get 10 strangers in a row to give you wrong directions on purpose and follow said directions. How you go about doing this is entirely up to personal creative flair. No matter where you are , you will end up in front of legions forest after following all ten of those false directions. At this point you may still quit and walk away, the forest will not chase you , but once you step foot in that forest you will be forced to only leave through your wit and instincts.


the ritual:
legion , the legion. "he is many but one" . The legion is the only creature you will find in these woods and will be the only you will be speaking to for the rest of your time here. Your objective is to get the legion to tell you the exit of the forest . There is no further explanation  its simply as said.
about the legion, the legion is an androgynous with varying appearances . The legion's mind is made up of all sorts of souls who never escaped the forest, some sad, some vengeful , and some willing to empathize with those lost in these woods. It's believe that legion itself the one to start it all has consciousness in the body but due to the many souls that are largely indistinguishable from one another its only a theory with very little basis . 

Escape- You will need to convince legion, to show you the way. Legion will frequently switch between a host of souls but it doesn't have the ability to directly harm you. You must use your wit and interpersonal skills to get legion to let show you the way, pay attention to ticks and other personality traits to discern the souls from one another. Souls may mimick their counterparts but will have trouble truly acting as their different mates due to a difference in gesture and body language. Use all the information you have of the modern world to appease the souls willing to guide you and avoid the malicious slick tongues of those wishing to keep you with them forever. The toys and newspaper are meant to be used as bargaining chips with children and old respectively.

-legions host of souls, some souls to look out for if they are awake during your journey in the forest . Please note that this information may change overtime with the addition of new souls in the mix and the passage of time. Even these long lost souls can change 

Maria- humble and speaks in a quiet tone. Identifying features is She shirks at the threat of eye contact. She is relatively trustworthy. With today being the cause for the survival of 2 recorded survivors. 

Hemlock- a simple gruff nice man who entered the forest of his own accord in his later life in fear of dying to old age . He is especially sympathetic to those entering the forest. His identifying features are his staid voice and warm personality and a abnormal control over his left eyebrow which is believed to be a talent of his in his living days.

legion- he goes by the name Karl, Marc,Seth  and so much more. His favorite name is legion though according to sources concerning other souls he just thinks the name sounds cool. He is a pathological liar . Loves it so much he will lie to you on basic information like for example in one recorded case when asked which direction was left , legion pointed right without hesitation . Identifying features are his constant name changes,  tendency to over explain and a hint of excitement in his voice when lying. 

Gretal/Hansel - Gretal and Hansel are believed to be a case of lost siblings brought together in death. When they are both present , one will randomly be decided as the villain and the other the hero. The villain is supposed to lie to you to make you stay  forever, the hero is supposed to help you leave. Identifying features are the constant bickering between the two and more open body language as if they are playing a overdramatic opera play between the two. Often most spirits will refuse to come between the two as they continue their play. They are very easy to reason with toys and will often drop their game if shown a toy they like enough. Otherwise its a observation game to see which one looks more like a villain.

bojangle- a silent soul who's main mission is to see you end up their with them. Identifying features are a silent legion body mean mugging you bitterly as if you were his worst enemy. Attempting to communicate with bojangle is near impossible so its best to take advantage of the time he isn't in control of legions body to communicate with some hopefully nicer souls.

Rodrick- a riddle fello who will give you answers so long as you answer for guiding through the forest with his riddles. The thing is that his riddles are largely outdated and easily answered. 

take advantage , use your ability to communicate and observe to guide you through these woods before supplies run out.

End:Once you've left these woods you will have survived and earned your bounty. Any promises made between you and the spirits within the confines of that forest are entirely up to you fulfill, there is no special force binding you.

boons- You will gain the ability to tell lies from truth in the case that the information involved affects you greatly enough. This will be communicated with a pang to the heart with more pain equally a heavier affect on your future.
