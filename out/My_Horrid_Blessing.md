In the movies, you always see high school bullies going out of their way to make people miserable: swirlies, wedgies, and locker-stuffings. Maybe at one point they happened, but they don’t happen now. 

I should know, I’m a loser. Or, at least, people think I am. 

The bullying isn’t always obvious though. I don’t really get beaten, well, I did once two years ago in tenth grade. One of my classmates thought I was masturbating in the bushes to his girlfriend, the sick fuck. Too bad I can’t tell them the truth. 

Anyway, I really don’t get physically bullied. It’s all so passive, so subtle. There’s the odd social media post, or the outright joke here and there. Most of the time it’s a scoff, eye roll, laughing and pointing with a hand over their mouth, or just plain ignoring me. 

People say I’m crazy and bully me because they think I talk to myself, but I don’t. I’m speaking to ghosts. I’ve been able to do it since I was nine years old. It’s not like some medium bullshit where I talk to ghosts through clues. I can full-on see and communicate with them as if they were standing in front of me. I get to see them exactly how they were in their last moments before they died. 

People don’t lose their memories of themselves after they die. They’re actually quite sharp. Even if they had Alzheimer’s or some kind of dementia when they died, they’re not forgetful as a ghost. I asked my grandfather why this was, and he says those with memory loss had an especially long death as they began to die once they were inflicted with memory loss. 

Oh yeah, my grandfather could do this, too. He discovered that about me when I was nine. I went over to his house one day and saw my grandmother who died the year before from a heart attack: 

“Grandma?” I said, as I started shaking. 

“What do you mean, ‘grandma’? What do you see?” asked my grandfather, smiling. 

“Poppa, I see grandma. She’s right there waving at me and saying hello.” I pointed at her. 

“Tell me what else you see, buddy.” 

“Well, she’s in her house dress and has her favorite slippers on! And her hair is tied back like always! It’s grandma.” 

My grandfather started crying and hugged me. He said none of his four kids, my mom included, had this gift. He explained everything to me, and one of the things I remember him telling me was that this couldn’t be turned off. I didn’t mind. He made me promise not to tell anyone besides my parents. My father seemed confused, but my mother was upset. At the time, I didn’t understand why. 

Time went on, and when I was thirteen and beginning high school, I met a few kids that were my age when they died. My school was built in 1884, and since then sixteen people have died there, twelve of them students. The others were two teachers, one janitor, and the other was a principal. 

The students had died from sports injuries, falling down the stairs, or mostly illnesses. One of teachers passed from a car accident, and the other from getting drunk after hours and falling out a window. The principal was an old man who died of a stroke. The janitor got electrocuted, and he was the last person to die here in 1954. 

Most of the kids died in the 1800’s. Two of them died in the 50’s. They were my friends. One was Thomas, the other was Carol. Thomas got a brain hemorrhage from a football game. Carol fell down the steps. Anyway, during my lunch period, I sit alone, but during our recess time, there’s an area that’s pretty well hidden that I always go to. It’s behind some bushes, and there’s a platform. 

The three of us sit there and talk, telling jokes and stories of our lives. That’s why I was accused of hiding in the bushes and being a pervert. Anyway, Thomas and Carol come over to my house with me to hang out. I’d let them see what a computer and smartphone was. 

It’s been getting more difficult. Thomas was a freshman when he died, and Carol was a junior. I’m a senior now. It’s harder to relate to them, but they’re all I have for my social life. This led to me wanting to branch out, but I really couldn’t talk to normal humans. I couldn’t relate to them. Not only that, most living humans are afraid of me, I make them uncomfortable. And no matter where I go, I see these ghosts everywhere. I couldn’t focus on meeting new people, and like I said, I just couldn’t relate to them. They could never really know nor understand me. 

My parents made me make an effort to make new friends. During the weekend, I went to a computer coding seminar in my neighborhood where I met Frankie. He didn’t go to the same school as I did, but he lives in the same town. We’d seen each other at town events, or in passing. Frankie was a normal human being, someone who seemed pretty cool. He never judged me for “talking to myself” - which most people in my school and town did - but one day he asked me why I did it, so after months of hanging out, I decided to tell him everything. 

“Frankie, I can see and speak to dead people, exactly how they were before they died. I can’t turn it off, I can’t totally tune them out. Two of my best friends are ghosts,” I started telling him all of this, and even showed him pictures and newspaper clippings of Thomas and Carol. I told him everything about them, and about others I’ve met. I also told him how ghosts can go anywhere but choose to stay where they’re most comfortable. How they retain their memories and personalities when they die. 

I loved talking to Frankie about all this. It wasn’t only that it was a weight off my shoulders, nor was it simply that I had someone to relate to that I wouldn’t outgrow; I had someone that was interested. Frankie loved it. Some days, him and I would visit graveyards, and I’d get to talk to the ghosts there. Graveyards were like the busiest of cities: they were full of ghosts running around, living, and going about their daily business. 

I got to speak to so many and pass all this info onto Frankie. I even convinced some ghosts to move some stuff for Frankie, immersing him as best as I could even though we couldn’t experience the same things.

Frankie and I had a blast, and for months we’d go to the graveyard every weekend. 

Then it stopped. One night I got woken up by a LEGO set I was building in my room falling. I woke up to a horrid sight: Frankie was standing in my room, upset. 

“Frankie, how the hell did you get in here?” I whispered, trembling. I was thinking the worst. 

“I phased through the wall. Something we can choose to do now,” Frankie became transparent and phased through my desk. 

“Oh my God, how did this happen?” I started getting louder and began to tear up. 

“I can’t talk right now, man. I have to go. I’m sorry I came to you like this.” He vanished. 

I was distraught. Even though it was a relatively short time, I came to love Frankie, he was my best friend. I felt empty. 

The next day, I went to the store with my parents. I hadn’t told them anything. As my parents and I got in the car to go back home, Frankie’s father knocked on the window. My father rolled the window down. “Hey, how’s it going?” 

Frankie’s father continued to stare at me, not saying a word. 

“Is everything okay?” asked my mother. 

Frankie’s father then reached his hand into the car and pointed at me: “I know the secret. I asked Frankie why the fuck he was seen at graveyards with you. I know the secret. Did he come to you, and you won’t fucking tell me?”

I couldn’t get the words out. My father and mother started panicking, telling Frankie’s dad to get out of the car. My father pushed him out of the car and sped off. 

My dad asked a question: “What the hell was that?” 

“Frankie came to me last night… As a ghost. He came just to show me he’s dead. I don’t know anything else.” 

My mother turned around in her seat: “What the fuck? You told Frankie? You did all that shit with him? Don’t lie to me!” 

“Mom, you’ll never understand what this is like. This isn’t a fun thing to have, people think I’m a crazy loser! I finally had a REAL human outside my immediate family who could appreciate this, I felt like a normal human being!” 

My mother scoffed: “Well, you’re not. That power makes you not normal, and it’s not something people need to know. It can get into the wrong hands and make you miserable! Now what the fuck do we do?” 

My mother thinks I’m abnormal, and now my father won’t say anything. I slumped down in my seat and looked out the window. I felt numb, empty, and wanted to just crawl in my bed and die. 

Two weeks went by, and no sign of Frankie. I couldn’t even productively talk to Thomas or Carol about this, they had no idea how to handle this, nor had they even seen Frankie. As I walked home from school, saying bye to my friends, Frankie’s father had pulled up to the bus stop. I was the only one there. He pulled out a revolver and beckoned me to get in. I didn’t want to get in, but my legs - with a mind of their own - scurried into the car. Frankie’s father beckoned me to close the door, so I did, and he sped off. 

“Look, kid. I’m talking with the police. Two weeks of a search party, and no one knows where the fuck Frankie is.” 

I could finally look at him and speak, I found my voice: “S-search party?” 

“He went missing. I have a gut feeling he’s fucking dead. Did he show himself to you?” 

I had to lie, the man was holding a gun. “N-no sir, he hasn’t appeared to me!” 

The father chuckled, “Yeah, right. He doesn’t show up to his best friend and only person he can fucking talk to.” The father sped the car up. “Look, I’m here because I’m fed up. My wife is catatonic, she hasn’t spoken since Frankie’s been missing. The police aren’t doing jack shit! So, let’s strike a deal. I don’t tell the police and feds about your powers, you contact Frankie and help us fucking find him. Get it?” 

“Uh, well, how will you explain what I know then?” 

Frankie’s father started laughing, “God, y’know, you think you’re so fucking smart. You’re gonna do what I say. I need Frankie here. I gotta know where my son went!” 

As the car sped along, I heard rustling in the backseat. It was Frankie. He put his finger over his lips, aggressively moving it back and forth, basically begging me to stay quiet. I turned forward, not knowing what to do. What the hell was going to happen to me? 

After what felt like a lifetime, we finally got to Frankie’s home. His father put the gun up to my back and made me walk inside. As I walked past the living room, I saw Frankie’s mother sitting in the dark living room. The television was on, the Home Shopping Network. Frankie’s mother’s head drooped over as she clutched a bottle of whiskey. 

“Move, now!” urged Frankie’s father. 

As I was led into the guest room, his father swiped my backpack and pushed me into there, locking the door behind me. The windows were sealed shut, and all the furniture save for a mattress was taken out. As I lied down on the mattress and began to cry, Frankie appeared to me. 

“Please, Frankie, please. I trusted you with everything. Your father has gone fucking crazy!” 

Frankie stood there, looking down at the floor, his frown heavily apparent. 

I stood up from the mattress, making sure to whisper. “Goddamnit, please Frankie!” 

“Fine. I met a man. Yes, a man. I thought he’d love and accept me. You weren’t interested in me like that. I know you weren’t. This man said he was.” 

“Frankie?”

“My parents never accepted it. When my father found out last year, he beat me senseless. When he recently found out I was trying to date again, he put out cigarettes onto me. Look.” Frankie rolled up his sleeves, a mark of burns ran up his forearm. “I died with these scars! My own fucking father did this while my bitch mother just watched!” 

I reached out and tried to hug Frankie, but it was no use. The dead and humans couldn’t really feel each other. 

“I’m sorry, Frankie. I am. I wish you had told me sooner. We could’ve done something before all this.” 

“Yeah,” started Frankie, “but it’s too late now, isn’t it?”. Frankie started becoming transparent, but not before saying something. “I got a secret phone stashed underneath the neighbor’s shed. Our fence in that corner of our backyard has a loose floor panel that I used to be able to crawl through. It led me right behind the shed, which has panels on the outside of it as well. I hid the phone under the one with the rock on top of it.” Then he vanished. 

I started pounding on the door and screaming, but no one came. After screaming for what felt like hours, I passed out. When I woke up that morning, Frankie’s dad came into the room. 

“Did you see him?” 

“Y-yes. H-he has a phone h-hidden u-u-under the n-neighbor’s shed.” I was so scared of this man that I couldn’t get the words out. I was falling apart. 

“Get me this goddamned phone, now!” 

I led Frankie’s father outside and took him to the corner Frankie mentioned. I pushed the loose panel and found the plank with the rock over it. I pushed the rock aside and lifted the plank. Underneath the plank was a patch of dirt amongst the grass. I began to dig and found a baggy with a cellphone in it. Frankie’s father pushed me aside and took the baggy. 

“S-sir? H-how are you g-gonna convince the p-police th-th-a-” 

Frankie’s father slapped the back of my head, knocking me forward, then he began to scold me, “I’ll figure it the fuck out myself!” Frankie’s father then walked me back inside the home and back into the room. He then left, and from the window I saw he began to walk to the neighbor’s front door, cocking his gun. 

I felt a cool breeze in the stuffy room, and I saw Frankie walk in through the wall. 

“The man I met is Jacob Lichtenstein. He’s thirty-six and lives in the next town over. One night he told me that he loved me, and he started grabbing me. Y’know… down there.” Frankie began to cry. “I… I didn’t want to do it. He was so much taller and stronger than me. I tried pushing him off, I kept saying no! He choked me to death, then buried me under his porch. I’m buried next to two other teens, a thirteen year old girl, and a nineteen year old boy.” 

“Frankie, oh my God. I’m so sorry. Why did you never tell me?” 

Frankie looked down at the floor and cried. “I’m sorry, I really am! I trusted you but I was scared. My parents made me fucking hate myself and made me so scared to tell anyone. I’m so sorry! And if I had known this would happen, I would’ve told you everything sooner. I’m so sorry!” 

I stood next to Frankie, reassuring him that I’d care for him no matter what. Thomas and Carol came by and we all talked. By the time I knew it, the sun had begun to set. Thomas and Carol left. As Frankie was leaving, he turned to me with a dreaded expression: “I’m not at rest. Please help them find me, then live your life. Stop dwelling on us.” 

The words sent me to the floor, dizzy. My friend was suffering even in death. I know I wasn’t wise to his issues, but I felt guilty I couldn’t help him when he was alive. I needed to do this for him. 

Frankie’s father came bursting into the room. “Who the fuck is Jake? I found disgusting messages on this phone, who the fuck is Jake?” I told his father everything. Frankie’s father then drove me back home. He made me swear not to say a word, then brandished his gun at me before he made me go to my house. My parents kept asking where I was and if I was okay, but all I could do was cry. 

A couple weeks had passed and Frankie’s body was found, and the killer was arrested. Frankie visited me the night they arrested his killer, along with the boy and girl he was buried with. The boy was named Drake, the girl was named Francine. They died the same way as Frankie. I introduced them to Thomas and Carol. 

The next day after school, we all hung out at my house. I spoke to Drake and Francine, learning their stories. Drake was a high school varsity athlete that graduated and was destined to go D1. Francine was starting high school soon and had dreams of becoming a nurse like her mom. Two weeks after, I attended Frankie’s funeral. Seeing him get buried was heart wrenching to me, but it was for the best. His father didn’t even acknowledge me. Guess that’s for the better. I’m too scared to say anything, anyway. 

It was bittersweet to see them at rest. I’m glad they had the proper burials, but I’m still upset a monster took their lives away. The whole fiasco had left me thinking about a lot. I wanted to visit my grandfather at his home the next day to ask more questions about this power, or maybe not. I was going to take Frankie’s advice. I wanted to live a normal life.
