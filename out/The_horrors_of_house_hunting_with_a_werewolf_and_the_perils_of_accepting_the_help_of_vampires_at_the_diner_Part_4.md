[Previous part](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ocdzun/i_almost_became_a_human_sacrifice_after_my_night/).  [My whole experience](https://www.reddit.com/user/Practical-Way8041/comments/1ocdy74/the_seven_realms_diner_series/).

If I had to describe what living in the same room as Roger is like in one word, I would probably say torture.

Look, I’ve come to love him over the past four weeks (and before any of you say anything, no. I don’t mean romantically, I mean as a friend. He even said that he’s gotten close to me because I remind him of his little sister. So PLEASE keep your shipping to yourself. I an NOT in this town for romance.)

But the man snores. And he barely sleeps. Part of his werewolf physiology, I suppose. But I, just a measly human, need my eight hours a day. Or at least five. A pacing werewolf, or a werewolf doing push-ups at ten a.m., or a werewolf eating a rotisserie chicken whole (bones and all) in the middle of the day does not allow for restful sleep. 

At all. 

At least this week hasn’t been as crazy last week. Not that it’s hard, seeing as I was almost sacrificed then. So, I guess I should enjoy the small miracles when I can. 

As hard as I tried to hide my irritation, it was still very much obvious to Roger—damn these creatures and their superhuman senses—and he assured me that he was going to get out of my hair soon, since he had already started looking for a new place to live. All he needed now was a roommate. And, since I obviously must’ve hit my head pretty hard when I was a kid, I told him that I would be his roommate.

I was still holding onto hope that the road would be fixed soon, but since storm season is here and repairs haven’t even started, I figured that living at the motel from hell wasn’t exactly ideal for me. Who knows how long it will take for it to be fixed?

Don’t get me wrong, I have debated walking out of here, but the nearest town is over seventy miles away, and there is no way I’m dumb enough to try that. 

And, in case you weren’t tired enough of hearing me complain about the town, I will complain some more:

RENT PRICES ARE HORRIBLE

I thought that the cushy salary at the diner was because of all the supernatural nonsense, but my God, the cost of living in Monsterville (not the real name, obviously, but I figured we should call it *something* that isn’t *the town.* Suggestions are welcome in the comments) is *insane*.

And if you think I’m exaggerating, picture this: a two bedroom apartment with piss stains on *the ceiling* (how is that even possible?) for two thousand dollars a week. A week!

How is that even remotely normal? I mean, sure, housing is limited in Monsterville, but how is it possible for a week’s rent to be that high? It almost makes me want to stay at the motel. 

Almost. I’m not a masochist.

I could write a novel-length story about the horrors of house hunting in a town filled with inhumans, but instead I’ll just share the highlights.

The first house we visited had metal gates, like the ones you would find at stores after closing, on all doors and windows, as well as suspicious scratch marks on all the walls.  When Roger started growling uncontrollably, the landlord finally admitted that they came from the last family that had rented the place. Apparently, they were werewolves too, and they moved out when they discovered that the house’s foundation was laid on top of wolf’s bane, which increases aggression in werewolves. When he was asked if he knew that Roger was a werewolf, he just said yes. Asshole. 

The next house was actually kind of nice. Great neighborhood, beautiful garden, spacious rooms (well… less cramped than the other ones), but Roger just had to get into a verbal fight with the landlady. I mean, I get that werewolves and vampires aren’t exactly friends, but can’t he at least he civil? Either way, Roger refused to rent from a ‘leech,’ and the vampire refused to rent to a ‘flea-bag’. So, on we went with our search.

The next two houses did not have any supernatural issues, which almost made me cry in relief. But they did have some normal, human problems. 

One had a pool in the basement. As in, the basement was a pool. The basement was so flooded you could’ve swum in there. And the landlord didn’t even want to let us see it before signing a contract. I suppose werewolf senses are beneficial sometimes, because we wouldn’t have known about it otherwise. Then, the other one had mold on every single wall and piece of furniture. But hey, it was cheap.

Needless to say, Saturday, our only day off, was a complete failure, and we lost an entire day running around town and touring houses that I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy (except for Silas. That asshole can have all of them.)

So, Sunday night, Roger and I were back to work at the diner after yet another day of very little rest for me. 

And, since life refuses to ever give me a break, Lucien was there.

“Been shopping recently?” He teased with a smirk. 

I just gave him an icy glare as he sat down in his usual spot at the counter.

“Wow. So original.” I said flatly, moving to grab the O- pitcher from the heating rack. 

“Let me guess. Now you’re going to ask me if I got in a fight recently? Ha ha. I’m tired, we get it!” I finished my rant by trying to put the blood into a mug.

“I was actually going to ask you if you could hold my wallet in those bags, since they seem bigger than my pockets,” he said. “But your suggestion’s good too.”

“Very funny.”

“Stop.” 

I paused mid-pour, raising an eyebrow at him. “Stop what?” 

“I’m feeling like AB+ today.”

I sighed, trying not to roll my eyes. “You’re impossible today. You always order O-”

“AB+ has recently become my favorite flavor,” he shrugged, smirking. “You can’t help the cravings, Bloody.”

“Fine,” I muttered, pouring the A+ and the B+ into his mug.

The vampire pouted a little bit. “I thought that would get a more of a reaction from you,” he whined.

“Why would it?”

“That’s your blood type,” he said like it was the most obvious thing in the world.

I frowned. “No, it’s not.”

“Yes, it is.”

“No. That’s impossible. Both my parents are B-, so you should probably get your taste buds checked, Count Dumbula.”

He burst out laughing. “My taste buds are perfectly fine, Bloody. But maybe I should have another taste just to make sure…”

I didn’t have the energy to play into his game, so I just took his mug away from his hands.

“Ok, ok!” He kept laughing. “Fine, sorry,” he smiled sheepishly with false innocence.

I reluctantly gave him the mug back, setting it in front of him forcefully enough that a few drops spilled on the counter. 

“Count Dumbula?” He muttered, shaking his head in amusement. “Funny. You’ve earned yourself this,” he said, sliding an envelope across the counter.

I stared at it suspiciously for a few seconds. “What’s that?”

“Open it.”

I hesitated. “It’s not going to bite me, is it?” I asked, only half joking. Still, I went ahead and grabbed the envelope from the counter.

“Just open it, Bloody.”

I sighed and tore the envelope open, unsure of what Lucien could’ve put in there. Thankfully, it was just a folded sheet of paper. I kept eying him suspiciously as I unfolded it, only to become surprised when I found a house listing on it.

“What’s this?” I asked.

“Can’t you read?” He laughed. “It’s a house listing. I heard you were looking for new lodgings, and I have contacts. You’re welcome.” He is so full of himself, I swear. 

I narrowed my eyes at him and continued reading the listing. It was too good to be true, really. Only one thousand dollars a week. Between the two of us, it would only take me one night and a quarter of work to cover it. That was half the price of the piss stained house. 

“What’s the catch?” I asked, returning everything to him. 

“Catch? You wound me, Bloody. There’s no catch. Can’t a friend do something nice for another friend?”

“Is that what we are? Friends?” I snorted. “Let me guess, if I take the house, I’ll owe you again?”

He shrugged. “Nothing so sinister, I promise. Take it as… interest in your waitressing. I can’t have my favorite waitress dozing off while I order my blood.”

“I swear to God, if this has cockroaches in every single room, I’ll find a way to put one in your blood,” I warned. 

He gave me a small nod, a smile tugging on his lips. 

I wanted to refuse his help, especially since I knew that everything from Lucien came with strings attached, but the offer was too good to pass up. Just visiting the house couldn’t possibly hurt, could it?

So, when we got out from our shift on Monday morning, I convinced Roger to come with me to see the house. Of course, I didn’t tell him where the lead had come from, since I was one hundred per cent sure that he wouldn’t be too happy knowing that it came from Lucien.

When we got there, I instantly cringed because, of course, Lucien had neglected to mention the small, *insignificant* detail that the house was located right across from the entrance to the vampire clan. 

“You didn’t tell me the house was this close to the clan,” Roger growled. 

“I didn’t know,” I shot back. “But dude, it’s a thousand a week. It could be on Mars for all I care. Come on, let’s just take a look. Please.”

He must’ve seen the desperation in my eyes, because he finally conceded. “Fine,” he grumbled. “But if the landlord’s a vampire, I’m out.”

“Of course,” I said, rolling my eyes. 

The landlord turned out to be a very nice wizard, which is great, since werewolves and wizards get along well. 

And the house itself was great. Not luxurious or anything, pretty small really. But it was pristine, there were no floods, and no wolf’s bane. It had a living room, a kitchen, three bedrooms—so we could even find a third roommate to make rent even cheaper—and two bathrooms. Two. Bathrooms. I’ve never lived anywhere with two bathrooms. It even had a TV!

And I’m sure that some of you, who are much more experienced in life, probably want to kill us for our stupidity right now, but we took the house. Look, we’re not experienced in life. Not at all. In fact, Roger is not as old as he looks; he’s barely 24. We’ve never lived anywhere that isn’t our parents’ houses. 

You know what? This is on him. Yep. This is on Roger. He’s been living in this town much longer than I, and he’s been dealing with the supernatural since his birth. That’s officially the story I’m going with. (We will ignore the fact that I’m the one who pushed the most for it. That’s irrelevant, really.)

I know, I know. It was too good to be true. But it was nice, and cheap. Did I mention it was nice AND cheap? And sure, I’d have to look over my shoulder for the foreseeable future in case Silas wanted to take a stroll through town, but I figured he was scared enough of Lucien not to try anything. 

So yes, I admit it. We took the very nice, and very cheap, too-good-to-be-true house. 

I would love to tell you that everything went well and that the house is perfect. But we all know that that’s not why I’m writing this. If everything had truly been nice and well, this could’ve been an email. 

Moving was fairly fast, since I barely have any possessions. And in case you were wondering, yes. I went shopping, and I finally have more clothes than the ones I came here with. 

I also finally got to meet Roger’s parents. Oh, I already knew the sheriff, of course, but I met his mother. She’s a really nice woman. She was furious at the sheriff for kicking Roger out, but she understands why he did it. She even admitted to me that she thinks it was the right thing to do. She also mentioned that she should probably stop coddling him because he hasn’t made any progress since the incident, but she quickly backtracked when she realized that I had no idea what the *incident* was. Roger was just as secretive, so… yeah. Roger has a secret, and I WILL find out what it is. 

Either way, his mother cooked enough food for us to last us the whole week. She even washed my clothes and got all of that blood out! Is this what it feels like to have an attentive mother? I’ve definitely been missing out. 

I also met Roger’s little sister. To be honest, she’s a bit of a troublemaker, so I’m not sure what Roger sees so similar between us.

Jokes aside, I really got along well with her, and I’m happy to say that we have formed an alliance to annoy Roger all the way to the moon.  

We were completely settled in by the end of the day. Everything was great. 

Until it wasn’t. 

On Tuesday, I got home earlier than Roger, and I immediately collapsed into bed. I was so tired that I didn’t even bother taking off my shoes, but I was excited at the very real possibility of a very long and restful sleep. 

I don’t know how much of that I managed to get, though, because just as I was dozing off, I heard the front door slam into the frame. Consciousness returned to me for a few seconds, but I quickly managed to get into the sleeping headspace again, just before I heard glass shattering on the floor. 

“Roger?” I called out. “Are you ok? What did you break?” I asked, getting out of bed. 

No answer. 

“Roger!” I yelled again, louder this time, but there was still no answer. 

I walked out to the kitchen and all five of our drinking glasses lay shattered on the floor. 

“Roger!” I chided, hoping that he would come out of hiding as I reached for the broom. As I was sweeping, a feeling of unease washed over me, and the hair on my arm stood up painfully. Suddenly, the front door swung open and I nearly died of a heart attack. It was Roger. 

“What the hell, man?” I blurted.

“What?” He asked, looking genuinely confused, then he saw the shattered glass on the floor. “Susan! You broke all our glasses?”

“*Me*?” I stared at him with my mouth hanging open. “I was peacefully falling asleep when *you* did this! How did you even manage to smash all the glasses? They were in the cabinet!”

“I wasn’t even home! Wow, I did not expect this from you.” He looked at me in exaggerated disappointment. 

“You know what? I don’t care. I need sleep. Stick to your lies. But I won’t be cleaning up your mess,” I said, fuming, as I was shoving the broom into his hands. 

I went back to my room as he called after me, but I ignored him and slammed my door shut before collapsing back into bed.

Of course, I didn’t get much sleep then either, because I was jolted awake by a loud bang on my door. I glared at it, thinking that it must’ve been Roger trying to get revenge on me by waking me up. 

Then, hissing erupted into my room. The sound was so loud that it genuinely felt like a snake was whispering directly into my ear. I screamed, batting at my shoulder, but of course, nothing was there. 

Then the door banged again. 

I shakily got up from my bed through labored breaths, heart pounding, and wiping the sweat off my palms on my pants.

I grabbed the closest item I could find, a shoe, and I slowly creep toward the door.

After nearly a minute of deliberation, I finally gathered enough courage to open it. 

My hand barely grazed the doorknob when another bang made me flinch. 

But this time, it was followed by scratching so heavy I thought whatever was on the other side would be able to claw its way in any second now.

A breath caught in my throat, and I thought for a moment that it was Roger in his werewolf form. My mind went back to the wolf’s bane house for a second, and I imagined claws turning my body into minced meat. 

When the scratching stopped, I took several deep breaths before daring to open the door, only to find an empty hallway on the other side. 

I sighed in relief, but it was short-lived because the scratching started back up, this time on the floor. It was as if someone—something—was tracing the outline of the hallway.

However, even though the noise was there, and the carpet was moving as though an invisible force was clawing at it, no marks appeared on the floor. I took a moment to glance at the door behind me, and it too was intact. 

I quickly ran across the hall into Roger’s room as pure panic echoed in my chest. 

When I bolted through the closed door, a body slammed into mine, knocking me on my back. Roger’s body pinned mine to the floor, and his eyes had turned a glowing shade of yellow. I froze in fear when I saw that his hand, with the claws extended, was raised in the air, ready to strike. I braced myself for impact, but nothing happened. 

He immediately slid off me, and his eyes returned to his usual shade of green when he realized that I was not the threat that he was trying to neutralize.  

“Sorry,” he muttered, breathing hard. “I thought…” he looked at his door and then at me. “What the hell was that?”

“How the hell am I supposed to know?” I screamed. “I thought it was you!”

“It wasn’t me.”

“I know that now…”

Before we could say anything else, a clatter from the kitchen drew our attention. A salad bowl hovered mid-air. We stared at it, dumbfounded for a second before it shot straight toward Roger’s head. He ducked just in time, but the bowl smashed against the wall behind us, sending shards flying into our backs. 

I screamed, and Roger grabbed me by the arm to help me to my feet. 

Both of us bolted toward the front door, but before we could reach it, a mug shot through the air, once again aimed at Roger’s head. This time, though, the werewolf wasn’t as lucky as last time, and the mug struck him right on his forehead. Thankfully, it didn’t break. 

We finally made it outside, both of us panting. Roger was holding his hand on his forehead, where blood was trickling down. 

“A haunted house? Really?” He panted. 

“Ghosts are real too?” I groaned. 

“Yes. I should’ve known it was too good to be true!”

He walked me to his parents’ house in silence, as I tried to ask him what we were supposed to do now. We did give all of our savings to the landlord as a deposit; I even had to borrow some money from Roger for that. But every time I asked a question, he just told me that he’d explain later. 

We knocked on the door, and the sheriff opened it. Then, he immediately tried to slam it into our faces when he saw us, but Roger shoved his hand into the door to stop him. 

“Come on, dad, please. We need your help,” he pleaded, looking like a dog with his tail between his paws. 

“Save it,” the sheriff snapped. 

“The house is haunted!” Roger blurted. 

That seemed to get the sheriff’s attention, because he yanked the door back open and, if looks could kill, let’s just say that Roger would be just as dead as the ghost. 

“Get in here, boy,” the man shoved Roger into the house and glared at me to follow. “How could you be so unbelievably irresponsible? You’re old enough to look for the signs of a haunting yourself!”

Roger opened his mouth to say something, but chose not to. Instead, he just stood there and took it like a child being scolded. 

“Didn’t we teach you how to do that?” He asked, forcefully. 

“Yes, sir,” Roger responded. 

The sheriff sighed. “I should let you deal with this yourselves, but I’m feeling generous today.” He led us to his office and closed the door behind him. “Not a word to your mother,” he told Roger

I’ll spare you the agony of every boring hour we spent researching. Here’s the short version of what the sheriff told us. The only way to get rid of a ghost, apparently, is to find its bones and burn them. Sprinkle them with some salt, add some kind of flammable accelerant, like gasoline, then set them alight. If you don’t burn the bones, the ghost stays.

So, of course, we spent the day digging into the house’s history to figure out whose bones we needed to find, as I kept wondering if I was ever going to have a full day’s sleep again.

And we did find whose bones we needed to burn. 

In fact, we even found out why the ghost seemed so eager to hurt Roger, but only tried to scare me. 

The ghost was a man who died when he was in his late thirties, over one hundred years ago, back when this town wasn’t M*onsterville* yet. When the Inhumans started flooding the town, there were no laws as to what they could or couldn’t do, and since they were stronger, faster, and much more powerful than the humans living here, they began taking over their houses and, eventually, the whole town. 

The owner of our house tried to resist against a family of werewolves that wanted to keep the house for themselves, and he was later brutally murdered by them for it. He never really stood a chance. 

So, yeah. We had a werewolf hating ghost on our hands. Side note, I don’t totally blame the guy for this. I mean, if I had been torn to bits by werewolves trying to steal my home, I would want revenge too. 

But, either way, we needed to find those bones to burn them so that we could live in the house peacefully. And, luckily for us, he was buried in the local cemetery in the historical section. 

“We’re going to need shovels,” Roger started, listing things as we walked to the diner. “And lanterns, in case it’s not bright enough.”

“We?” I asked, raising one eyebrow. “You’re the one who didn’t check for ghosts!”

“Yes, *we.* We both live there,” he responded. “And you didn’t check either.”

“I didn’t know I had to!”

“And you’re the one who pushed for it.”

I sucked my lips in, knowing that he was right. “Fine, I did. But, I’m sorry, I still won’t help you. I refuse. I just can’t go digging up bones,” I shivered. “I really can’t.”

“But I can’t do this alone,” he whined. “Just come with me. You won’t have to do any digging, I promise.”

I pondered for a second before deciding what to say. “Don’t worry, you won’t be alone. I have the perfect man for the job.”

When I walked into the diner, I was oddly happy to see that Lucien was already at his usual spot at the counter, sipping on a cup of blood. Linda greeted Roger and me before disappearing into the back to go wherever it is that she goes after her shift, and Roger followed her to get the kitchen ready. 

“Hey Bloody,” he smirked, looking at me with an expression I couldn’t decode. “Get me another cup of O-.”

“I don’t think so,” I said, taking the one he was holding away from him. 

“Hey!” He exclaimed. 

“You’re not getting blood today. You’re getting a shovel and some lanterns, then you’re going to spend your night digging up old bones.”

“What?” He laughed. 

“Did you know the house was haunted?” I asked. 

He barked out a laugh. “Oh, I knew there had to be something about that place.”

“Oh, so you knew the house was haunted?”

“No,” he said, grinning. “I just knew there was something about it.”

“Well, that something is a ghost,” I said. “And you’re going to help me get rid of it.”

“And why would I do that?” he asked. “What’s in it for me?” He whispered seductively as he got a bit closer to me, and his smile widened. A small shiver ran down my spine at the sight of his fangs. 

“I won’t tell the sheriff that you’re the one who gave his son a lead on a haunted house.”

He smirked, but this time the smile didn’t quite reach his eyes. “You wouldn’t dare.”

“Oh, yes,” I said, leaning closer, “I would.”

“Fine,” he grunted. “But you’ll owe me.”

“No, I won’t,” I responded, and I took it as a win when his only response was to narrow his eyes at me before leaving. 

Five hours later, he walked back into the diner. His previously pristine black suit was now covered in dirt, and he carried a white linen sack over his shoulder. 

He set it down on the counter in front of me with a thud. 

I looked at him with a raised eyebrow. “What do you think you’re doing?”

“You bones, my lady,” he mocked, bowing. 

A few patrons glanced over, then quickly went back to their meals when I shot them a glare. 

“Thank you,” I said, reaching for the sack. 

He grabbed my wrist before I could lift it, though. I sucked in a short breath, and I tried to remain calm as I reminded myself that I was safe in the diner. *Did I go too far this time?* I thought. 

“You won’t tell the sheriff, will you?”

“No,” I promised, and he released my arm. 

As compensation for his labor, I decided to give him a free cup of blood, which he seemed to appreciate. 

Finally, after our shift, Roger and I walked back home, still bickering about the logistics of the ritual.

“I’ve been thinking about something,” I said.

“That’s never good,” Roger muttered.

I ignored him. “What if we try to reason with the ghost?”

He stopped dead in his tracks. “Reason with the ghost? Are you crazy?”

“Listen,” I continued, “I kind of understand why he wants revenge. Maybe if we tell him that we have his bones and that we’ll burn them if he tries anything again, he’ll be civil!”

“He won’t be civil,” Roger said flatly. “He’s a ghost!”

“We can try! And how cool would it be to have a ghost on our side?”

He sighed deeply. “Fine. But you try it. If it kills you, then that’s your problem.”

And that’s exactly what I did.

I tentatively walked into the house with the stack of bones—which were already salted and sprinkled with gasoline—placed inside a metal bowl we “borrowed” from the diner, and a lit lighter in the other hand. Listen, I wasn’t taking any chances. 

“Hi!” I said nervously. “I think we may have started off on the wrong foot.”

The silence made my heart beat even faster. 

“I’m Susan,” I said carefully, “and that really nice werewolf out there is Roger—” all of the cupboard doors opened at once and then slammed shut with a deafening thud. I flinched, and the urge to run took over for a second, but I stood my ground. 

“Ok, umm… I understand your frustration. Really, I do. But… Look, we’re good people. We really are. And all we want is a place to live.” The cupboards rattled again, and I fidgeted on my feet. 

“I’m here to propose a treaty. You don’t… haunt us, and we don’t burn your bones.” I said, cringing at myself as the cupboards began rattling again. “I really don’t want to burn them, I swear. Please, please, please be nice.”

This time, not only did the cupboard open, but also the drawers, only to then be shut again. 

“Okay, okay!” I said quickly. “I’m going to give you a few minutes to decide. If you accept our peace treaty, that means you’re nice to us and we don’t burn your bones, then open all the cupboards and don’t close them.”

A minute passed. Then another.

Finally, one by one, every cupboard door creaked open and stayed that way.

I let out a shaky breath. “Thank you,” I whispered. Then I called out, “Roger, it’s safe to come in!”

The werewolf edged into the kitchen, his eyes darting everywhere with a spark of fear in them. “Hi!”

“See?” I told him. “The ghost agreed to play nice.” One of the cupboard doors slammed shut. Roger’s face grew pale, and his eyes turned yellow for a second. “I’m gonna take that as a yes. If it’s a yes, please do that again.” Another cupboard door closed. 

And that, my friends, is how two roommates became three, and, dare I say, I became friends with a ghost. 

Ok, not friends. He just banged on my door when I wrote the word friends. He wants everybody to know that we are not friends, just allies. 

It’s a sore subject, I see. 

All in all, it was a good week. 

And I got to spend all of yesterday sleeping. 

Ps, the ghost doesn’t want me to share his name, so I’m respecting his wishes. 

Oh, and tomorrow is Halloween. I’m sure nothing bad ever happens in Monsterville on Halloween. 

Right? RIGHT?
