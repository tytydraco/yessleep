———

Morning came slowly, a gray, suffocating kind of light that made everything in the room look faded. I must have dozed for minutes at a time, but it wasn’t sleep. It was more like sinking into shallow water and jolting back to the surface before anything could pull me under. 

When I finally stood, the bandages tugged tight across my arms and ribs, already stained through. I changed into a fresh shirt so my mother wouldn’t see, and for a second I caught my reflection in the mirror—pale, unsteady, like someone visiting a place he’d sworn never to return to. For a moment, the face didn’t even look like mine.

The hall smelled exactly the way it used to in the mornings, that mix of stale coffee and dust and something metallic I never could identify. The house was quiet—too quiet. 

I paused at the end of the hallway, listening the way I used to as a kid before deciding whether it was safe to come out. I hated myself for doing it, but the instinct was too old and too deeply wired to suppress. No footsteps. No voices. Just the low hum of the refrigerator and the soft ticking of the kitchen clock.

She was at the stove when I walked in, stirring something in a pot with her shoulders hunched like she’d been standing like that for a long time. She glanced over her shoulder and smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. 

“Did you sleep at all?” she asked. Her voice was hoarse, and her hands trembled slightly as she pushed her hair back from her face.

“Some,” I lied. My gaze drifted to the kitchen table. A glass sat there that I didn’t remember her using the night before, filled halfway with water that looked too still, like it hadn’t been touched in hours. 

She followed my eyes to it and frowned as if seeing it for the first time. Then she moved it to the sink with a haste that didn’t match her exhaustion.

We ate in a quiet far heavier than anything from dinner. She kept searching my face, studying me like she was waiting for me to confirm a suspicion she hadn’t said aloud yet. 

At one point she reached out and brushed something from my sleeve—a small flake of dried blood I’d missed—and when she saw what it was, her entire expression faltered. 

Her fingers lingered for a moment before she pulled her hand back to her lap, gripping her own knuckles tight enough that her skin went white.

“Do you ever feel strange here?” she asked suddenly. Her voice was too soft, like she was worried the air itself might carry the words somewhere she didn’t want them to go.

I looked at her for a long moment before answering. “What do you mean?”

She stared down at her hands, rubbing her thumb over the faint crescent-shaped scars on her left palm—the ones she got during one of her worst nights, when she’d hit the wall so hard her rings somehow cut into her skin. 

She almost never acknowledged that they existed. 

“I don’t know,” she whispered. “It’s hard to explain. Sometimes this house feels… full. Like there’s more in it than just us. Like it remembers things I don’t want to remember.” 

She hesitated, then added, “You used to be so scared all the time. It felt like that fear lived here even when you weren’t in the room.”

The words hollowed something out inside me, not because they were cruel or accusatory, but because she sounded genuinely confused, like she had spent years trying to make sense of something intangible pressing against her without form or name. 

Before I could respond, the light above the sink flickered twice, slow and deliberate, the way it used to during storms. Except the sky outside the window was clear.

After a moment she said, too lightly, “I was thinking, after I get off work today… maybe we could go get coffee? Or lunch somewhere? That diner by the highway is still open. You used to like it, remember?”

I didn’t answer at first. Something knotted in my gut. That word—remember—felt heavy in the air after what the house had shown me last night.

She seemed to notice my hesitation and rushed on, her words tripping over themselves.

“I just mean—if you want. We don’t have to. I just thought it might be nice. You and me. To talk, or… not talk. Just spend time.”

She twisted her fingers together under the table. A nervous tic I didn’t remember from childhood.

“I’m trying,” she said quietly. “I know that doesn’t fix anything. But I’m trying.”

She looked at me then—really looked—and there was nothing defensive in her expression. Just tiredness. Regret. A hope so small it looked afraid to exist.

I stabbed a piece of egg I didn’t want and forced myself to meet her eyes.

“Yeah,” I said. “Lunch is fine.”

Her face softened in this cautious, trembling way—as if she didn’t want to smile too widely and ruin the moment.

“Good,” she said, barely above a whisper. “Good.”
For a second, it felt… almost normal.

But then she glanced toward the corner of the room, quick and subtle, like checking that something wasn’t listening. The motion was so fast I almost missed it, but not fast enough to pretend it wasn’t there.

I followed her gaze out of instinct.

Nothing was there. Just the empty corner where the paint was peeling.

Still, something in the air felt aware. As if the house was leaning closer.

She stood abruptly, gathering plates even though I was still eating. “I should get dressed,” she said. “Traffic’s bad on weekdays. But—what time should I pick you up? Is around 3 or 4 okay?”

I swallowed my food, throat tight.

“Whenever,” I said.

She nodded. But when she turned away, I caught a flicker—some shadow or expression she didn’t mean to show. Not fear, exactly. More like she was asking the house permission to leave me alone in it.

The kitchen door clicked shut behind her.

And for the first time since I arrived, I realized she wasn’t the only one trying to reconnect.

The house was too.

After breakfast, I walked down the hall toward the living room, telling myself I was just stretching my legs, just retracing old territory to ground myself. The boards under my feet creaked in that familiar uneven pattern, like someone matching my steps half a beat behind. 

The air shifted in temperature as I passed each doorway, growing slightly warmer near the bathroom then cooler near the coat closet. These were changes I remembered from childhood, but back then I always thought it was just the house being old. 

Now the pattern felt almost intentional.

When I pushed open the living room door, the world around me stuttered.

It wasn’t immediate, not like a jump scare or a sudden hallucination. It was gradual, like reality rearranged itself one forgotten detail at a time. 

The light changed first—turning harsher, yellowed, the way it used to when the old lamp near the sofa gave off that buzz before dying. 

The rug on the floor blurred at the edges, then sharpened into the pattern we’d replaced years ago. The smell in the air shifted too, sour and sharp, the remnants of a spoiled smoothie she once threw at me because I forgot to take out the trash.

I didn’t move. I couldn’t. Every breath felt weighted.
A figure appeared near the far wall—my mother, but not her. Younger. Shoulders drawn back the way they were when anger rolled through her like a storm she couldn’t outrun. 

Her face wasn’t clear; it flickered at the edges, the features refusing to settle—never showing a clear expression. 

She crossed the room with those short, furious steps I remembered too vividly, her hand raised not to strike but to emphasize something she was yelling so passionately about.

I could hear her voice, muffled, warped, repeating the same sentence in a loop that didn’t match her mouth. The sound was low, almost subterranean, like someone speaking underwater.

Then I saw him.

The boy stood near the sofa, small and thin, shoulders curled inward. He didn’t look up. His hair fell across his face in the same uneven way mine did at ten years old. 

His hands were tucked against his stomach—bruises along the left side of his face, one arm clutching the wrist of the other—a protective posture I remembered without wanting to. He wasn’t exactly solid. His outline flickered, bending in and out of the room’s lighting like a shadow caught between frames of a film.

The air around me constricted. My chest ached with a pressure that wasn’t panic but something deeper, older, ingrained into the muscle memory of childhood fear.

The woman’s voice grew sharper—harsher—the sound flattening into a jagged tone that didn’t belong to any language. The boy flinched without moving. The room darkened at the corners, shadows pooling and stretching until they pressed against the edges of the scene like hands pushing through thin fabric.

Then the memory warped.

The woman’s head snapped toward me—not quickly, but with a dragging, unnatural slowness, like something pulling a body through thick mud. 

Her face was still obscured, but something beneath the blur leaned forward, sharpening into an intent rather than a feature. Her arm lifted again, but instead of pointing at the boy, it pointed at me.

The sound in the room cut out. Every noise. Every hum. Even my breath.

She kept eye contact as she grabbed the boy by the ear. She shook him around while yelling furiously before shoving him as hard as she could. The boy’s head cracked against the wall before he fell on the floor, unconscious.

Something pressed against my chest—not physically, but from the inside, the pressure of a feeling recognizing itself. The scene froze. Then it shattered in an instant, the room snapping back into the present with a crack that echoed through the floorboards like something heavy falling upstairs.
The living room was ordinary again—quiet, dim, unchanged.

Except the wall behind me had a dent in it.
A small, round impact at the exact height of a child’s head.

I stared at it until the air around me started to vibrate with that low, pulsing hum I remembered from nights when everything felt too loud to be silent. The house seemed to exhale, slow and satisfied, like it had shown me something it needed me to see.

The living room was ordinary again—quiet, dim, unchanged.

But I wasn’t.

My legs felt hollow, like they were remembering how it felt to go weak under her grip. I stood there staring at the empty spot where the boy had hit the wall, and my body reacted before my mind did. 

My knees locked. My breathing shortened. My palms went numb. A whole childhood of learned responses waking up all at once, like a survival instinct I hadn't even realized I still carried.

I didn’t need to tell myself it was real. I knew it. I knew it the way you know the taste of blood in your mouth or the sound of your own name being screamed. Seeing it again didn’t rewrite anything—it just took the seal off a memory I had kept boxed up so tightly I’d convinced myself it was smaller than it was. 

But watching it play out in front of me, watching her hand in the boy’s hair, the way she shook him, the way his head cracked against the wall… there was no minimizing that. No distancing it. It was like seeing a crime scene you were a witness to and finally allowing yourself to admit it counted.

My stomach twisted. I pressed a hand over it and felt myself fold forward slightly, like the pressure might keep everything inside me from spilling out. The room was too quiet. Sickeningly quiet. I could almost hear the echo of her shouting in the corners, a sound that still lived somewhere in the drywall whether the house wanted to admit it or not.

I backed away until I felt the edge of the coffee table hit the back of my leg, then sank down onto it because standing felt wrong, like I was taking up too much space in a room that still remembered how small I used to be. I rubbed my hands together, trying to ground myself, but they kept shaking. 

It wasn’t fear of the house. It wasn’t fear of whatever the fuck happened. It was the simple, humiliating fear of being a child again in a place that made me one.

I lifted my head and looked around the living room—the real one, the present one—and suddenly every object felt loaded with history. The lamp she’d knocked over during an argument. The rug she’d once dragged me across. The uneven scuff on the baseboard where my heel had hit when she shoved me. 

Nothing supernatural about any of it in the moment. Just the truth of a place where bad things happened.

I swallowed hard. My throat felt scraped raw, like I’d been screaming even though I hadn’t said a single word.

The heater kicked on suddenly, loud and mechanical, but the noise didn’t comfort me. It only reminded me how loud the house could get when it wanted to drown everything else out. I pressed my fingertips to my temples, trying to think, trying to breathe past the thick feeling in my chest.

“This is what happened,” I whispered to no one, just to hear it out loud.

Saying it didn’t make it easier.

But it felt honest.

And honesty in this house felt dangerous.

I looked back toward the spot where the boy—where I—had fallen. The room was calm again, still as a photograph. But something in the silence felt charged, like the house wasn’t just showing me a memory.

It was reminding me.

Reminding me that it remembered everything, even the worst.
