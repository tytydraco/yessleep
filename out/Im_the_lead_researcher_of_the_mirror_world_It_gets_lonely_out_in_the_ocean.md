I'm standing in front of the dead, endless ocean, my feet buried beneath the black sand. The sky is a gray void, the sun is as lifeless as the moon. I'm all alone in this planet, there will be no company for months. In front of me is the Explorer Mark I, but I prefer calling it the Casket. Its titanium hull is covered in a black slimy substance, making the EM1 text nearly invisible. It has no windows, for they would crack under the pressure. It has two propellers, barely moving the submarine inside the dense ocean. The door to the airlock is open, inviting me in.

This job is hard to do, it really is. Doing maintenance on outposts, decades old with the constructors long dead. Operating rusty machinery that has been left to rot, barely working. I see the ocean in my dreams now, it doesn't leave me alone even when I'm not in its world. I hate this, all of this. But if I don't do it, who will? The only people except me who worked here are dead. While the team behind this is tucked away in their warm blankets, I'm down here and doing the heavy work, not that they care.

After loading in my cargo which consists of supplies that will hopefully last me a year, I get in the airlock. After a quick look at my checklist and confirming everything is in order, I flip the switch and the internal door opens. The sound of grinding metal fills my ears. After a moment, the lights turn on, revealing the corpse of a metal beast, way past its prime. But it does not matter, for it has been designed for ease of maintenance and to stand the test of time.

I painstakingly check every valve, every pressure gauge and every pipe. During this thing's operation, failure is not an option. After making sure everything works, I get in the engine room. In front of me is a nuclear reactor. It looks like an iron heart, its veins spreading out in all directions. After a quick test, I'm confident that it works and insert the fuel. Two hours of other maintenance later, I enter the control room. I turn the engine on and the submarine comes back to life. I release the docking lock and the submarine drops to the ocean below, sinking into the abyss.

As the casket is being lowered, I monitor each sensor, making sure everything is where it should be. After about an hour, the sub has reached its cruise depth of 12 kilometers. At this depth, nothing bigger than a bottle of water should be alive and I should be left with the sound of the engine. But that's immediately proven wrong as I hear the screech of an ungodly creature in the distance. As I put the sub in autopilot mode, I check the status of each station, hoping that at least one of them is still working but the terminal screen stays empty. No such luck.

It wasn't always like this. I used to have a crew of 5: Tanner, McReady, Roswell, Blair and me, Carter. They're all a part of this world's ecosystem now, I sometimes dream about them. Sadly, I need to cut this short, as I'm getting close to Station Roswell and I don't have much time left until all communication is cut so I'll just copy the first few entries of my journal here.

This damn place is so claustrophobic. I like the metallic look of it though, it reminds me that we're isolated from whatever is out there. It's been a few days since we've arrived here and EM1 was started up yesterday. I don't know how the previous guys used this to build the stations. The pressure is about 2000 atmospheres here, it's a miracle this thing even works, considering the water here is like two times denser than the water on Earth.

I don't even know where this is. The lab guys just put us in these capsule things, and when we got out we were here. I'll be here for about 7-8 months now, I'm just hoping that they can get us back because they didn't seem confident when sending us here.

Today we went to Station Tanner. It was better than the EM1, but sadly we didn't stay there long. Only Tanner has access to the machinery or whatever that's going on inside. They gave each of us a station to take care of, I don't know what will happen to the stations when one of us dies here.

I didn't think we were in any danger until we parked to sleep. I've heard something swimming around the submarine, I could feel the vibrations. At first I didn't think much of it, but we were all up and trying to get the sub running when the thing bumped into the sub and made a sound that's not possible to describe.

I'm already counting the days until we get out of here.

Apparently, we're in an underwater massive cave thing. I would've known sooner had I bothered to check our map but I was desperately trying to get the broken computer working which is still not entirely fixed. Guess I'll add it to the list of things to be replaced after we get out of this place. I'm being called to the docking bay, so I guess I'll write the rest of this later.

We just launched the tiny EM15 with Blair in it, he'll go to the observatory to figure out what's causing problems with our maps while we go to Station McReady. His sub is a lot faster so he'll probably keep up with us. I dread going into that thing, this place is already as claustrophobic as it is. Everyone's already on edge from that thing last night, Roswell said it might have been the ventilation system but we all know that's not what it is.

We arrived at Station McReady which is supposed to be like this data management thing? I have no idea because the big boy wouldn't tell us. Like, I get this is all supposed to be secret or some shit but I don't like being left in the dark. It's not like we're actively trying to sabotage each other's work.

Blair is back. The moment he got out of EM15, we all knew something was wrong. Blair was pale and you could feel his fear just by looking at his face. We asked him what happened but he just went to bed. My guy fell asleep the moment his head touched the pillow, I wish I could do that. Anyways, I've been assigned to surveying data from EM15 to figure out what causes his uh, behavior.

I've looked at the data. It looks like EM15 was on its way to the observatory when the outside sensors detected close proximity to.. something. The sub stopped for a moment and the sensors went cold right after. The worst is when he made it out of the observatory and started coming back to EM1. He was halfway there when he got in a radio conversation with Tanner, I don't know what they were talking about because the EM15's inside microphone sucks ass.

Then, the outside proximity sensors went off again. This time, they didn't stop and a few minutes went by with nothing happening. Then, the sub's mic started picking up chatter again. It was Tanner. Blair didn't speak back, he just stayed silent as Tanner spoke. I couldn't identify what was wrong until I realized there were no radio conversations at that time. The voice was coming from outside the submarine. "Tanner" kept speaking the whole way and it eventually left when he got close to EM1.

What. The. Fuck.
