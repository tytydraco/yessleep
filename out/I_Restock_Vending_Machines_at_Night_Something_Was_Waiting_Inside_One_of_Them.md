My job wasn’t the most exciting or interesting one out there. But for me, it was just right. I worked for a vending machine service company. We handled almost every office, hospital, and school in the city. So there was always plenty of work.

I usually started very early, before dawn, restocking the machines. At that hour everything was quieter. The roads were nearly empty, and in most places the workday hadn’t even started yet. The company didn’t mind either. My boss liked to say that this way people could start spending money first thing in the morning.

So that’s how I got around the area, following my usual route in my small company cargo van. That morning was no different. Around three a.m., I pulled into the parking lot of one of the bigger office buildings.

The place was huge, and as if that wasn’t enough, it had been designed as both an office complex and a warehouse combined. Lately I’d been coming here almost every day. A lot of people worked in that building, so I always showed up fully loaded.

After getting out of the van and stacking the boxes onto my small hand truck, I headed toward the building entrance.

Like always, the security guard, Terry, was supposed to be there to let me in. Back when we first started servicing this place, Terry had been pretty cool with me, so I gave him a free Pepsi once. After that he became impossible to get rid of, but honestly, we ended up becoming friends.

When I reached the large glass doors, I didn’t see Terry anywhere. The desk where the security guards usually sat was empty.


The small TV they watched was still on, its colorful light flickering across the wall.

I pressed my face almost against the glass, trying to look down the hallway toward the restrooms, thinking maybe Terry was parked in there again. But I didn’t see anything, and the bathroom door was closed.

I didn’t have much of a choice except to wait and hope Terry showed up. I glanced back toward the parking lot, but aside from my van and Terry’s car, it was completely empty.


“Damn it, Terry, I’m going to fall behind because of you…” I muttered, adjusting my lucky baseball cap.


I didn’t know what else to do, so I just stood there and waited. I stared out at the parking lot for a while, then counted my stock to make sure I’d brought enough soda, candy, and chips with me. But time kept passing, and Terry was nowhere to be found. I was getting more and more tense by the minute. By then I should’ve already been up on the second floor, where a coffee machine and a snack machine were also waiting for me.


“Damn it, Terry,” I muttered under my breath, then lightly knocked on the large glass door.


The moment I tapped it, the door unexpectedly swung open. Just a little, pushed inward by the force of my knock.

I stood there, stunned, like a complete idiot. The damn door had been unlocked the whole time, and I’d been standing out here waiting.

I grabbed the door and pushed it all the way open. It opened easily, just like it always did.


“Terry, it’s me. Santino,” I said, sticking my head through the doorway. “I’m here to restock the machines.”


No response.
The lobby of the office building was completely deserted. The only sound was the low murmur of voices coming from the TV.


“Terry? You here?” I called out louder as I walked toward the security desk.


I looked around the empty building, confused. Terry had a habit of wandering off. Technically, he was supposed to make rounds through the office to make sure everything was in order. But he’d told me more than once that most of the time he just went to the bathroom or headed up to the break room to see if there was anything good left in the fridge.


“Terry?” I called out again. “I’m starting my work, okay?”


Still no answer.
The whole building felt abandoned. Some talk show host kept droning on from the TV, and a small desk fan rattled softly on the counter.


“I really hope you’re not trying to scare me right now, Terry,” I muttered to myself.


I figured it wasn’t my job to check up on what Terry was doing during his shift or where he’d wandered off to.
I pulled my squeaky little hand truck up in front of the vending machines.

Down in the lobby there were only two machines. One was a glass-front snack machine filled with all kinds of candy and salty snacks. The other was a fully closed soda machine that dispensed six different drinks. Neat little machines, both of them.

Lost in my thoughts, I suddenly became aware of a thin, sad sound.
It was sniffling. Quiet sobbing. A small, lost voice coming from somewhere nearby.

I nervously looked around, trying to figure out where the crying was coming from. Swallowing hard, a little shaken, I searched for a logical explanation. It wasn’t enough that Terry was missing, now there was a crying child somewhere too?


“Hello?” I called out into the empty hallway. “Is someone here?”


“Help…” a timid, thin little voice whispered. “Mister… please…”


My mouth went dry with fear and confusion, and it took me a second to process where the voice was coming from.
It was coming from the locked soda machine directly behind me.


“What the fuck…” I whispered, completely frozen, then swore out loud.


“Mister, please,” the voice came again, a little louder this time. “Please get me out of here.”


“Jesus Christ…” I said, still in shock, unable to move. “How did you get in there? What happened?”


“I got locked in…” the little boy sniffled, then started quietly crying again.


“What? Who?” I asked, my thoughts scattered. “Who locked you inside the machine?”


“Well… um…” the boy mumbled shyly. “My mom did.”


“Oh my God, fuck,” I muttered angrily.


I knew there were horrible people out there. Unstable parents. But who the hell locks their kid inside a vending machine? And how would someone even manage that? I had no idea what to do. Call the police? Find Terry and see if he knew anything about this? Call someone else to get the kid out?

But then it hit me.
I was the one who could get him out. I had the keys. I hurried over to the soda machine to help the kid escape.


“Hang on, I’m going to help you. Don’t be scared,” I said gently, trying to keep my voice calm.


I pulled the special vending machine key out of my pocket and flipped open the small plastic cover hiding the lock.
But when I tried to insert the key, it wouldn’t go in. It felt like something had been jammed into the keyhole. I tried picking at it with my fingernail, hoping it would come loose. When I leaned in closer, I saw that something had been snapped off inside the lock, completely ruining it.


“You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me…” I hissed in frustration.


“What’s wrong, mister?” the boy asked, panic creeping into his voice.


“Uh… nothing,” I lied. “The lock’s just going to be a little hard to open.”


“Oh no… no…” the boy whimpered again. “Am I going to be stuck in here forever?”


He broke down crying all over again. He was terrified, and honestly, who wouldn’t be? Who knew how long he’d been trapped inside that machine, forgotten and alone?


“Hey… hey, don’t cry,” I tried to calm him. “Don’t be scared. I’ll figure something out. I’ll get you out.”


To reassure him, I used the key, since it worked for this too, to pop open the coin slot. That gave me a clear view inside the machine.
A pair of reddened brown eyes stared back at me. Inside, crammed into the machine in a way that shouldn’t have been possible, was a freckled little boy, maybe eight years old.


“Jesus, kid…” I muttered in disbelief. “How the hell did you even get in there?”


“My mom…” he sniffled. “My mom did it.”


“Fuck… this is just great,” I muttered under my breath. “We’ll figure something out, okay?”


“Okay,” the boy said, at least stopping his crying.


I tried to think. How to get him out. How badly he might be stuck. That’s when I remembered the toolbox in my van. Sometimes the machines malfunctioned or something broke inside them. When that happened, it was on us to take them apart and fix them. It didn’t happen often, but that was why the company supplied us with a decent set of tools in the van.


“Listen,” I said, straightening up beside the machine. “I’m going to run out to my van. I’ll grab some tools, and we’ll try this thing open somehow.”


I was about to head out, not wanting the kid to spend another second trapped inside the machine, when I felt something grab my pant leg at the thigh.
The child’s arm reached out through the drink slot and clutched my work pants. His thin, bare hand gripped so tightly I thought the fabric might tear.


“Don’t go, please!” the boy cried again. “Don’t leave me here! I’ll be all alone again!”


“I’m not leaving you,” I said, trying to soothe him. “I promise. I’ll get you out. I won’t leave you here.”


I gently patted his hand. His thin little forearm was ice cold.

That’s when it hit me, the machine was still powered on and running. It was keeping the drinks cold.
And it was keeping the boy cold too.


“Fuck,” I said angrily. “Listen, I’ve gotta be quick. Just a second and I’ll be back. You’re going to freeze in this thing.”


The boy finally loosened his grip. I pulled free and hurried out toward the parking lot.
I couldn’t leave him in that machine any longer.


I sprinted toward my van. My boots slapped against the dry concrete, loud in the nighttime silence.
I unlocked the van quickly and immediately dove into the rear cargo area. I was looking for the red-and-yellow box that held the tools. I shoved a box of chips aside and found the toolbox behind it.


“Finally, fuck,” I muttered in frustration.


I had this overwhelming feeling that if I didn’t hurry, something bad was going to happen to the kid, and that it would be on me.

I dumped everything out of the box. Screws, hammers, pliers, screwdrivers. Then, finally, at the bottom of the pile, I found it.
A crowbar. Jackpot.

As I grabbed it and tried to climb back out of the van, I slammed my head into the roof from the inside in my rush.


“Ah! Fuck!” I growled, rubbing my head.


Of course, my lucky baseball cap fell off too, right into the back of the van, between the scattered boxes.
I climbed out and stared tensely at the open doorway of the office building, gaping behind the mess.

No time for the cap. I turned and ran back toward the building.

I practically burst into the office lobby. I was breathing hard from the run. My head was still throbbing, but the kid mattered more right now.
To my surprise, the soda machine was open. The inside was empty.


“What the…” I muttered. “Hello? Kid, where are you? Terry?”


No answer came back. The deserted, silent office building felt like a crypt.
I moved cautiously toward the vending machine’s open door, gripping the crowbar tightly, like a cornered animal.


“Kid?” I asked as I stepped closer, but the machine still gaped back at me, empty.


Soda cans were scattered all over the floor. In front of the machine, a large puddle had spread across the tiles.
I nudged a Sprite can with my foot. It spun away, sliding past the machine. That’s when I noticed the small footprints.

The puddle gleaming in front of the machine was probably melted condensation from the cooling unit. From the pattern, it was clear someone had stepped into it barefoot, then tracked the water across the lobby floor toward the restrooms.

They were small footprints. A child’s footprints. The only disturbing thing was that they were barefoot, on top of everything else. As if it wasn’t bad enough that a kid had somehow been stuffed into a vending machine and then gotten out.


“Kid? Are you here somewhere?” I shouted into the silence. “Terry? Hello? Anyone?”


Nothing responded. Not a single sound stirred, as if even the TV at the security desk had gone quiet.


“For fuck’s sake,” I swore, my temples beginning to bead with sweat.


I don’t know what compelled me to do it, but I started following the wet footprints.
The water shimmered on the marble floor beneath the harsh glow of the hallway’s fluorescent lights. I followed the prints slowly, one careful step at a time. They didn’t go far. The wet footprints disappeared beneath the door to the men’s restroom.

I stood there, saliva pooling in my mouth, my heart pounding harder and harder. I gripped the crowbar with both hands now.

Taking a deep breath, I gently pushed the restroom door open with the crowbar.

My eyes went wide. My breath caught in my throat. The air around me turned icy, and for a moment, I thought my heart had stopped.

There were children inside the restroom.

Several stood in the middle of the room. A few were crouched around something on the floor. It looked like they were eating, but “feeding” would’ve been a more accurate word.

The kids who had been crouching stood up when I opened the door.

Their faces were smeared with blood. Their small teeth clicked and smacked as they chewed on bloody remains. On the floor lay what was left of a familiar security uniform, spread across the white tiles in a red, pulpy mess.
Terry.


“They told you not to leave us,” the children said in unison. “You said you’d come back.”


I couldn’t speak. Shock settled over me so completely that I wasn’t even sure what I was seeing was real.


“YOU SAID YOU’D HELP US!” the children screamed together.


I stumbled backward from the restroom door in terror. One of the kids closest to it grabbed the door and held it open as they all started moving toward me.
Slowly. Like something out of an old zombie movie.

Their blood-covered faces were both childlike and horrifying at the same time.
I backed away in sheer panic until my back hit the wall. I didn’t dare move. I was trapped. The children kept coming.

Then, without me even noticing, a boy lunged from my left, the direction I’d come from, and grabbed my arm. He bit down hard, like a wild animal.
I screamed in pain. His sharp teeth sank deep into my flesh, and I immediately felt warm blood start to pour down my arm. Acting on instinct, I swung the crowbar with my free hand and smashed it into the side of the kid’s head. The force sent him flying into the wall.

But his teeth didn’t let go.
As his small, thin body was yanked away, his jagged bite tore a chunk of flesh from my arm.

I howled as I watched blood soak into the floor. My torn flesh throbbed red and raw, the bite far wider and deeper than anything a child should’ve been capable of.

The kid I’d struck stood back up as if nothing had happened. He moved slowly, like the others, but showed no sign of pain. A large section of his head had split open, but instead of bone, blood, and tissue, a greenish substance seeped from the wound.


That’s when a little girl charged at me from the restroom, her mouth stretched unnaturally wide, sharp little teeth flashing.

My survival instincts kicked in. I swung the crowbar as hard as I could, smashing it into her face. Her features split apart on impact.
I grabbed the kid who’d bitten me and hurled him into the mass of children pouring out of the restroom.

Then I ran.
Straight for the glass doors.

I ran for my life, the sound of dozens of bare feet slapping against the floor right behind me.
I didn’t stop until I reached my van. Somehow, I was faster than they were. I dove inside, slammed the door shut, and started the engine.

The children caught up and crashed into the sides of the van like a stampede.
The engine roared. I didn’t hesitate, I floored it.

The child-shaped monsters toppled over like bowling pins. I might’ve run a few of them down. But all I could think about was getting away.
I kept my foot down, blowing through red lights as I sped through the empty streets. At that hour, there was no one else around.


Then I slammed on the brakes, hard enough that I thought the van might flip. But I had to stop.

I jumped out of the van, blood pouring down my forearm, and jogged to the back.

The rear doors were still swinging open. Boxes were scattered everywhere. I grabbed a crate of soda and hurled it angrily into the middle of the road.

That’s when I saw what I’d come back for.

My lucky baseball cap.
It was a little crushed, but it was still there. 
I slapped it onto my head and staggered back to the driver’s seat, clutching my bleeding arm as tight as I could.


“Fucking kids,” I muttered.


Then I drove away.
