I first saw it when I was seven. 

I was on a hike with my family. I went on a lot of those as a kid. I was fairly active. I don’t remember too much about it other than the gorgeous view at the end. It was a hike up the side of a small mountain on a switchback trail. Hell of a hike for a young boy. Once you got to the top, you could see the whole range out ahead of you. I remember being sweaty and bone-tired by the time we got there, but I didn’t mind. All I cared about was the view.

My mom had brought a pair of binoculars with us in case she spotted any interesting looking birds. It was a neat little hobby of hers, one that she still has to this day. I remember being a kid and listening intently to her rambling on and on about all the different kinds of birds we could find in the area. I didn’t understand what she was saying half the time, but I listened anyway. Her voice always calmed me.

Once we reached the top, she gave me the binoculars so I could look around at the mountain range with them. I remember eagerly taking them out of her hands, being extra careful not to drop them. I put the strap around my neck and held them up to my eyes, fiddling with the focus until the closest mountain came into view. I scanned the treeline. I think I was looking for bigfoot? The memory gets a little blurry here, but I know I found *something.*

It was sitting on the tallest branch of the tallest tree in the forest. It was hard to make out any of its features as the binoculars weren’t great, but I could at least see that it was pale and lanky. It clung onto the tree like a spider monkey. I only had my vision on it for a second before I blinked, and then it was gone. I could see the branch rustling. It must have scrambled back into the forest in the millisecond my eyes were closed. My hands started shaking so hard I dropped the binoculars, the strap around the back of my neck going taut. My mom put a hand on my shoulder.

“Honey? Honey, what did you see?”

Tears were welling up in my eyes. I opened my mouth to tell her what I saw, but I felt my stomach lurch at the thought. I couldn’t tell her. If I told her, she wouldn’t believe me. If I told her, something bad would happen. The image of the thing wouldn’t leave my mind. I shook my head, blinking back the tears.

“Nothing. C-can we go home? Please? I wanna go home.”

And that was that. She didn’t pry. I don’t know what *she* thought I saw, but she certainly didn’t believe that I hadn’t seen anything. I was grateful that she dropped it, though. Even now I can still feel that twisting, sick feeling deep in my gut. 

The next sighting is a lot clearer in my memory. It was PE, I was in… eighth grade? I remember being way too warm. I always wore my hoodie no matter how hot it was outside. My parents always gave me grief for it, told me I was going to get heat stroke. I never listened. It meant I always stank to high hell because of how much I was always sweating.

It was a free day. All Fridays were. We got to choose what we wanted to do on free days, and my buddy Cam and I would always choose to just go outside and walk the track until class was over. It counted as exercise, and we got to shoot the shit for 45 minutes. We’d talk about the usual middle school stuff — girls, video games, all the homework our teachers were forcing us to do, you know.

Cam was great. A real class clown type. Always had my back, but wasn’t afraid to slap a *Kick Me* sign on it every now and again. I couldn’t have asked for a better friend.

We were talking about the new DOOM, I think. He had just recently beaten it. I didn’t care much about spoilers (come on, it’s DOOM) and it wasn’t my kind of game, so he was telling me all about it. He was telling me about the cool glory kills you could do on all the demons, and he’d sort of act them out. Like, he’d punch the air as if he was killing a demon. It was really funny. He was all about those kinds of games, high octane brutal action type stuff. Sex, violence, blood and gore, you know what I’m talking about. He thought it was really cool, really mature. I never quite got it. I was more of an Animal Crossing kid. I told him as much while we walked, and he just laughed. 

We were on the other side of the track from the main building when I saw something strange way off in the distance. It was at the top of the flagpole at the other end of the school building, just peeking over the brick. I couldn’t see it very well because of the sun, but I could tell it wasn’t any flag I’d ever seen. I stood still as Cam kept walking and talking. He hadn’t noticed that I had stopped. I squinted. Just then, the sun ducked behind a cloud, and I could see much more clearly.

It was the same thing. The same creature, perched high above the ground, casting a long shadow onto the pavement below. He was closer now than before, close enough that I could just barely make out some details. I say *he,* now that I could see his figure better. Still pale and lanky, but now that I could make out more details he was unmistakably male. He was thin as a rail. He looked sick. His hands and feet were massive compared to the rest of his body, and his shoulders were broad. All his joints jutted out at wrong angles. He was looking around, one hand on his forehead shielding his eyes from the light like a sailor looking for land. The shadow made his face impossible to make out. 

He was wearing a dress. That’s what sticks out to me the most as I recall this. His long, flowing, white dress. It was beautiful. It made me sick. 

I turned to look at Cam, who had just noticed that I’d stopped in my tracks. 

“Dude, what?”

I turned back. The man was gone. 

“Uh.” I felt that sinking feeling again. I couldn’t tell him. “Nothing.”

He looked at me like I was crazy. Like he was looking at the dumbest motherfucker he’d ever seen. I felt ashamed, and I didn’t even know why. And then, for a brief moment, I saw his eyes dart up to the top of the flagpole. A fleeting glance, only for half a second. He swallowed, turned back around, and kept walking. Our conversation continued, but it wasn’t quite as lively as before.

For a moment I thought he’d seen him, too. Then, I pushed that thought into the back of my mind as far as I possibly could. 

Cam and I still kept in touch for a while. We still talked about the usual fare of girls and video games online. But, as many childhood friends do, we started going our separate ways. We talked less and less. Our conversations became shorter, more distant. We very rarely met up in person, and whenever we did our hangouts were always cut short. He was restless. It was like he was always *looking* for something, looking around to make sure he wasn’t being watched. One day he just stopped messaging me back, and thus we stopped being friends.

I started thinking about the man a lot more after I got to high school. I’d be going through my day completely fine, joking around with my friends at lunch, when all of a sudden I’d remember the image of him perched at the top of that flagpole and go silent. My friends didn’t know what was going on, but they were nice about it, at least. I found that girls were more understanding than guys most of the time. I guess that’s why I didn’t know many other guys in high school. Everyone always joked that I was just “one of the girls,” despite the fact that I decidedly was not.

It was around tenth grade that the nightmares started. Sometimes, after particularly bad days, I’d go to sleep only to be met with visions of white fabric flowing all around me. It was like a maze of curtains. I’d be running around trying desperately to find my way out, but pathways would open and close at random. The shifting of the fabric made me dizzy. Then, at a certain point, when I was sure I’d found my way out, I’d hear footsteps. They were light. Uneven. Like a baby learning to walk for the first time. They were right behind me. I always woke up before I saw what was making those sounds, but I knew in the back of my mind that it was him.

I woke up screaming some nights. Not screaming in fear, screaming in despair. Tears would be streaming down my cheeks and I’d be wailing for my mom to come help. I never told her what the nightmares were about. 

The one time I tried, I vomited all over my lap as soon as I started talking. I should have known better. 

One night, though, what woke me up weren’t the footsteps — it was a strange buzzing sound. It brought me straight out of the dream once I realized that it was the vibration of my phone. It was a message from Cam. I squinted at the blinding light of my phone screen. 

*Cam: i dont feel like myself anymore*

I was surprised, to say the least. We hadn’t talked for months and here he is messaging me something that sounded fairly serious at 2 in the morning. My stomach turned. 

*Mike: you good man??*

*Cam: i dont know if i ever have*

*Mike: dude chill whats up*

*Cam: whos body is this*

He wasn’t even responding to me. 

*Mike: dude youre freaking me out. whats wrong*

*Cam: whose mind is this*

*Cam: i dont know where i am*

*Cam: i feel sick*

*Cam: im sorry*

*Mike: hello???*

*Cam: i think hes here. help*

*Cam: help*

*Mike: cam please*

*Mike: cam*

He wouldn’t respond. I called him. Nothing. I tried again and again. I must have called a dozen times, but nothing. I told myself it was probably just a prank. He’d never pranked me like this before but I forced myself to believe it and forced myself to go back to sleep. I didn’t sleep well that night. No more nightmares, but I woke up exhausted. 

The next morning, on the way to school, was the third time I saw it.

I was on the school bus, chatting with my friend Mina, when I started hearing sirens. I looked out the window and there were police cars and paramedics on the side of the road. A body was being lifted onto a stretcher. The sounds of sirens were making my head spin. 

That was when I saw him. He was standing on top of the ambulance, his dress flowing in the breeze. He was closer this time. I could only see him for a second, but what I saw made me feel faint. 

He wasn’t looking around like last time. He was pointing straight at the bus, straight at *me.* He made direct eye contact. A smile spread across his face — a twisted, open-mouthed grin. He looked like he was so excited to see me that his jaw was ready to pop out of its sockets. His features looked even more distorted when I could see him this close, like someone had grabbed all of his points of articulation and just started *pulling.*

What scared me the most were his eyes. They looked sad. The smile, despite its size, didn’t quite reach them. He looked like he’d been crying. 

And then we passed him by. I stared out the window for a few seconds before I crumpled up in my seat. I felt disgusting just from having *seen* that thing. Mina tried to comfort me but I shied away. I couldn’t tell her what was wrong. I was a kid again, terrified that if I told anybody about the man that I’d be in trouble. She left me alone eventually.

And then, that day, as if things couldn’t have gotten any worse, halfway through third period, we were all called to the gym for an impromptu assembly. 

Cameron Lamont had taken his own life.

He had leapt from an overpass into oncoming traffic. Straight into a speeding car. Dead in an instant, leaving nothing behind but a note on his pillow and a couple dozen missed calls on his phone. That was what I’d seen that morning. The ambulance that the man was standing on was the one that my best friend’s body was being lifted into. 

He was taunting me. No, warning me? Telling me that I’d end up like Cam? I didn’t know what was going on. Halfway through the assembly I couldn’t take the stress and ran into the bathroom to cry.

I had no idea why he had done it. Cam seemed happy up until then. Had things gotten worse for him in the time we had stopped talking? I kept thinking back to those messages I got from him,  the night before he killed himself.

*i think hes here*

He’d seen the man, too, hadn’t he? 

Christ, maybe if I had told him that we were seeing the same thing, he wouldn’t have…

The rest of High School was rough. The nightmares got worse, and I found myself jumping at shadows a lot. I didn’t see the man again the whole time I was there, but I *thought* I did a lot. A tall teacher in a white shirt, a lab coat in the far corner of a science classroom, even my prom date in a nice white dress.

Mina was my date to prom. I had started dating her near the end of senior year. I’m not going to lie, I was surprised. I wasn’t the most handsome guy (according to my friends I was more *pretty* than anything), and for a while I didn’t even think that Mina *liked* guys. Apparently I was special. I didn’t complain. Mina was pretty. Kind, too. A bit on the serious side, but I didn’t mind that at all.

Prom was awful. I kept glancing around the room, catching little flashes of white in the corner of my eye. Eventually she noticed I was uncomfortable and we snuck off to the back of the building with our drinks. I had my first kiss that night. Mina was *very* understanding of my whole situation, even if I refused to talk about it in detail. I just told her that… sometimes I’d see things. I thought that if I said any more, I’d lose her. Nobody would want to be with a fragile little freak like me. 

We kept dating through college. We had made it into the same university, which we were both *very* happy about. And once school started back up again, I was thinking about the man less. I was happy to be out of that place after what happened to Cam. I think that was what did it. I was happier after leaving.

I thought I was done with him. I thought I was free.

Near the end of freshman year, Mina and I went out for our one year anniversary. We didn’t go anywhere fancy, just had a night out on the town shopping and chatting. I carried her bags, the gentleman that I was. After shopping, we went to a kinda nice restaurant with food that was just barely worth the price, and then sat down on a bench as the last echoes of sunlight fell past the horizon. I looked straight ahead as we chatted, taking in the view.

“Your hair’s getting long,” she said. “Thinking of getting it cut?”

I shook my head. “Nah. I like it this way. Always looked better with long hair.”

Mina giggled. “You know, everyone was right when we were back in high school. All this shopping and stuff, and the long hair? You really are one of the girls. Look, you’ve even got my shopping bags!”

Ah, yeah, I *did* still have those\*.\* I blushed and rolled my eyes. “Yeah, yeah, whatev-”

As I looked back in her direction, my heart stopped.

“Mikey?”

Saliva dripped down onto the top of her head from the gaping maw of the man standing above her, mouth wide open as if he was going to eat her whole. His eyes were trained on me. His arm was pointed directly at my face, nearly grazing against my forehead as it shook. He trembled with excitement. His eyes still held sadness.

I don’t remember any other details about the man. I barely remember the next few minutes. It’s all fuzzy in my mind. I think I ran. Sprinted away as fast as I could, away from the man, away from Mina. I remember my legs hurting like hell on the train ride home, and I remember staring ahead wide-eyed at the empty seat in front of me. I swear, he was sitting there. Staring at me. I don’t think I blinked once. If I blinked, he’d go away, and I would lose him, just like every other time I had seen him. And the next time I saw him, he’d be even closer, and I didn’t want to see that fucking face *ever* again.

I could feel all the other people on the train looking at me. Their gaze pierced through me. Judging. Mocking. I just stared ahead. 

I had to look away at some point, though. And I did. I left the train, headed to the parking lot, and got into my car. I tried to ignore the man sitting in the backseat, smiling at me in the reflection of the mirror above the dash.

He followed me all the way back to my dorm. I couldn’t see him, but I could feel him at my heels. Feel his breath on the back of my neck. I slammed and locked the door behind me, and crawled under the covers. The door to my dorm room had stayed shut the entire time, but he got in anyway. I could hear his labored breathing. This perverse mockery of a human being was leering down at me as I laid shuddering in bed.

I turned on my phone. Countless messages from Mina. I shut it off. I waited for the man to leave. He didn’t. I turned on my phone. A missed call. I shut it off. The man laid a hand on my hip. I could feel his cold, clammy hands through the blanket. I turned on my phone. It started to ring. It was Mina again.

I looked at the screen for a long time. And that was when I felt the tightness in my skin.

My joints began to ache, stretch, then pop outwards. It was like something inside me was growing and my skin just hadn’t gotten the memo yet. My jaw extended outwards, my shoulders broadened, my spine jutted out. My cheekbones rose and rose and my mouth grew wide. My feet and hands grew to twice their size. I was dying. It hurt so badly.

The phone continued to ring. I didn’t want to answer. I couldn’t. The thought made me feel sick. She couldn’t know about this. She’d hate me. She’d never want to see me again. Nobody would. At that moment, with my skin twisting and my bones popping and my phone buzzing, I thought about killing myself. If I did, all of this would stop. I would never have to look at that thing ever again.

And then I thought about Mina. The days we had spent together. The friends I’d made because of her. Our first kiss around the back of the school on prom night. My jawbone cracked.

I thought about Cam. His stupid little jokes. How he had remained by my side, joking around even though he was clearly going through so much. My leg bent backwards.

I thought about my mom. I missed her back home. I didn’t want to make her bury her child. My ribs pierced into my lungs.

And then I answered the phone. 

Thirty minutes later, my body had returned to normal, and Mina was cradling me in her arms like a child. The man was nowhere to be seen. I had told her *everything.*

“I love you,” she whispered. She said it over and over and over, until I stopped crying.

—

That was two years ago. I still see him sometimes. Once every few months, I’ll catch a glimpse of him staring from a distance from behind a tree or a building. I saw him floating in the ocean once, when I was at the beach with Mina on our honeymoon. I paid him no mind. He doesn’t bother me anymore, not after I told Mina all about him. I was so worried she’d hate me for it, but now I don’t even know why.

I’m getting my name legally changed next week. Allison. It’s my mom’s middle name.

Mina thinks it suits me well.
