So I’m supposed to be on my way to see some family in Florida, and I really f\*cked up on my way there, and now I’m seeing things, I’ve lost my car, and I feel like I’m losing my mind. Currently sitting in an empty Denny’s for the wifi and posting here to get some guidance or directions or something because I’m completely alone, I’m scared, maps isn’t working, and I have no idea what the hell to do.

So, preface: I’m from Mobile in southern Alabama, so I usually take I-10 to see my parents. They live out in this community– I don’t really even know if you can call it a town– in the middle of the northwest Florida region. Usually I only go see them twice a year, but since it’s a three day weekend, and my parents are getting older (plus, it’s veterans’ day and my dad is retired Navy), I figured I’d pop in as a surprise, say hi, bring them some food, have dinner, and leave in time to get home before midnight. I was supposed to have gotten there this evening, around 4 ish, but if you’re looking at the time this was posted, you can probably tell that my trip didn’t exactly go according to plan.

One of the things I have done– several times, actually– on these trips down to their house is take the wrong exit. See, there are two exits one after another– one that goes onto FL state road 71 and one that goes onto FL state road 69. The exit I’m supposed to take is 152, but I always preemptively take exit 142, which takes me into this place called Blountstown. Usually I catch my mistake pretty quickly and turn around, but this time was different.

To start with, today I got out kind of late. My tire blew almost immediately after hopping on the interstate, so I had to call roadside service and drive to the nearest auto shop on a donut. It took me about an hour and a half to get that sorted, so I left that much later. The drive itself isn’t that long, it’s about three hours, but with the recent time change everything’s started to get much darker much earlier, so about halfway through my drive, the sun began to set. At this point, I was already exhausted, and so the next forty minutes cramped in my car with my foot on the pedal felt like actual hell.

At some point, I felt like I needed to take a piss, and so I pulled off to a Love’s near DeFuniak Springs. Before you judge me too hard for this next thing, this month has been especially humid and hot. Usual Florida weather, only it’s November now, and this is the kind of weather you’d expect in August. The AC in my car went out about a week before my trip and I’ve been too busy to get it looked at, so I’ve just been keeping the windows cracked for air circulation. My first mistake was stupidly forgetting to roll them back up when I left my car to go inside.

So, as you might have guessed, when I came back to my car, someone had reached in, undone the lock, and stolen my wallet, along with the thirty dollars of cash I kept in my glove box, and (devastatingly) the pumpkin bread I baked for my parents. Thank God I’d brought my phone with me into the store, because aside from my car itself, that was all I had.

I was closer to my parents’ house than my own at this point, and it was getting late (or at least felt like it) so I figured I’d try to get there quickly and just stay the night with them, report my missing wallet, and try to figure it out from there. Maybe miss work the next day. So I got back on the highway and kept going east.

Somewhere along the way, something weird happened. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a flash of light in the shape of something like a deer– some animal, on the side of the road. Only it was stiff, and just hovering there. In less than a second, when I tried to look at it, it flickered up and down, way up in the air, then disappeared. I don’t know exactly what it was that I saw, but for some strange reason, it made my stomach turn. I tightened my grip on the wheel and just slightly accelerated the car.

Still shaken up from whatever that was, it was here that I made my second grave mistake. On the road, I saw the sign for exit 142, and thinking (probably also hoping) it was my exit, I switched into the turn lane and took it straight into Blountstown. I’d wanted to get off of the highway for so long, I felt a slight wash of relief, and let my shoulders relax just a bit. 

Now let it be known that I very rarely do highway driving at night– usually I’m pretty good about arriving places while it’s light outside and maybe leaving when the sun’s gone down. But it’s much easier for me to get back on the highway and drive home in the dark than to find a town I’m barely familiar with from an exit off the highway in the dark. My parents’ city is pretty much a straight shot south off exit 152, so thinking I’d taken the right exit (because everything in Jackson county looks the same, and everything looks the same in the dark), I just kept driving further and further south. I kept thinking about that deer, too. I don’t know why I thought I saw that – maybe I was just tired, or maybe it was some reflection of light. But it kept coming up in my head. I kept thinking about it, about its shape and about its negative-space eyes and about its impossibly bright body. And how it floated. Did it float? Was that a trick of my mind? Did I even see an animal at all or was it a mind’s trick? But the most unsettling thing about whatever it was was how much it made my heart sink. Almost like it was some kind of terrible omen, or a reflection of my consciousness, warning me about something I already knew deep down. Maybe it was warning me not to take that exit. Or maybe it was the reason I had.

At some point, and I’m honestly not really sure when this was– maybe I sort of knew it the whole time– I realized that I had not, in fact, taken the right exit, and was driving down an unfamiliar state road in a part of Jackson county completely unbeknownst to me. And I had to take a leak again – bad. So I pulled off to the side of the road, halfway into a ditch, and told myself that once I’d done this business I’d get back in my car, turn around, and call my parents. This was no longer going to be a nice surprise– no matter how I spun it. I needed them to be expecting me in case anything happened. So I got out of my car, unzipped my pants, and turned away.

For some reason, while I was doing my business, I closed my eyes. Maybe out of habit. But when I reopened them, something was very strange. And felt incredibly *off*. I realized what it was once I turned back around. My headlights weren’t lighting up the area anymore, and everything was very, very dark. And that’s not because my headlights were out. It’s because my car was gone.

Yeah, my car had completely disappeared. I zipped up my pants, unsure of what else to do or of what had happened at all. An unease started to rise in me as I felt the air where my car was and hit myself in the forehead, trying to wake myself up, or fix my eyes so I could see my car that was *supposed to be there.* Questions started to race in my head. Did someone come up behind me and steal my car? No, I didn’t hear anyone drive off. Plus, I still had my keys in my pockets. 

I checked the ditch to see if my car somehow rolled into it, but it wasn’t there– something else was, though. I bent down to peer a little closer. It was the body of a doe; she was lying upside down, back legs and flank bloodied, as if she’d been struck by a vehicle. It looked like someone had hit her on the road and thrust her body to the side just to clear the path. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up when I saw her head. It was turned in an unnatural way, looking up, rather than face-down. And I might be misremembering, or it could’ve been a trick of the dark, but this is the thing that broke me.

She was missing her eyes.

I shuddered, scampered out of the ditch, and, heart pounding, quickly checked the time on my phone. At this point it was only 7:34 pm but it *felt* like the dead middle of the night. I didn’t know what else to do, so, feeling raindrops start to hit my cheeks, I started walking, very quickly, down the road. Still heading east, because it would be pointless and take hours to try to walk back to the interstate. I decided that it might be more productive to find some sort of establishment– a gas station, a restaurant, or something– where I could get service, call my parents, and find another way out of here.

I thought about trying to find a motel, then remembered that because my wallet was stolen, I don’t have money to pay for a room nor an ID to check in or out with. So I just kept walking, looking for lights, trying to find any sign of human life.

And there it was. The Denny’s. 

Oh, holy beacon of light. The sign flickered above the dark sea of trees, and once I saw it, I ran. With every step I took a heavy breath, my heart pounding in my chest. The rain began to get even heavier, soaking my clothes, but I didn’t care. I tucked my cell phone into my underwear, hoping– praying– that it would stay dry. I saw it come up, across the street from a Dollar General, which actually had a car in the parking lot and lights on, and I kept running until I reached the door. Heaving, I bent over, taking shelter underneath the awning, before catching my breath and entering. 

Upon first inspection, the place seemed to be empty, but after standing at the hostess’ stand long enough, a woman with her hair tied up came out from the kitchen and asked me how many people I was with. She seemed surprised to see me. I explained what had happened (well, sort of– I’d left out the weird visions, the deer, and I just told her that my car was stolen rather than telling her about my wallet and my car vanishing on separate occasions, because that was so illogical it seemed suspicious, and I wasn’t sure if I even believed it myself). She took me to a booth and gave me a plate of toast and eggs, on the house. She asked if I needed to use the phone, but miraculously, my phone survived the rain and I was able to call my parents on my cell. The call went to voicemail, and I’m still waiting on a call back, but at least I’m in someplace with wifi and my phone’s battery is pretty solid (I’m at 43% typing this out).

So, yeah. I'm not sure what to do. Not sure what even happened, really, and I feel just the slightest bit like I'm losing track of the line between what's real and what isn't. I would like to get back to someplace familiar, but maps is the one app that just isn’t loading. The Denny’s hostess (she isn’t wearing a name tag, for some reason, and I’m afraid to ask her name so as to not come off as a creep) says her maps isn’t working either, but she has cell service too. The rain hasn’t slowed. I thought of trying my luck at the DG, but I missed my window, as it closed about 15 minutes ago. I'm just so exhausted.

Even though I’m safe now, and so grateful that this Denny’s is a 24 hour establishment (the hostess says she’s letting me stay the night if I need) there is a lingering feeling that something is just… *wrong*. I know that I’m exhausted, and I should probably try to sleep. Maybe the rain’ll clear up in the morning and I can try to walk to the interstate and hitchhike to my parents’. God, I wish this place was big enough to have an Uber or Lyft service. Or a bus, even. 

So, anyways. Thanks for reading about this shitshow of a night I've had. I'm going to get some sleep.
