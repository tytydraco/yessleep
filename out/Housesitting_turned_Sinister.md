Hello Everyone !

So basically this couple came up to me at the skate shop I work at and told me if I could house sit for them for a few days. I told them okay and I told my boss that I was gonna be out of the country for a few days. You see I work part-time at the shop and only earn $400 a week but they told me that they would give me $1,000 and would give me another $1,000 when they got back if I did a good job. I started Sunday and they’ll be back on Friday. Everything was going fine but yesterday I heard a loud sound coming the attic and apparently a bunch of boxes had fallen over so I went to clean the mess up and when I tell you I never jumped so hard.


I saw they had a cowboy marionette locked in a glass case  just there in the middle. It felt like it’s eyes were following me and I quickly left because I’ve seen enough horror movies to know not to be nosy. A few hours later, I swear on everything I saw the doll’s reflection in the mirror while I was watching TV. Then when I went to sleep it felt like I heard some little kid laughing from the living room. I can’t tell if i’m paranoid or what and I feel bad leaving the couples house unattended but I’m sorry this is getting fucking scary. 

Then today shit just got even crazier. I went to bake some cookies because I wanted to take my mind off things and again I heard some little kid laughing and it was coming from up stairs. I thought I might be hearing things so I went to their bedroom and saw the literal cowboy doll sitting on their nightstand. I almost immediately ran downstairs and exited out the front door. 

Their next door neighbor hazel, who lives her grandma and is around my age saw me and she asked if I was alright. I went over to her house and I told her everything that’s happened so far and she said she saw the couple bring home the doll one night because apparently they like collecting vintage/antique stuff. The doll came from an antique store and sometimes hazel said she sees a shadow moving in the window of the attic. 

We’re gonna call like a priest or someone to see if the doll is haunted or maybe it’s the house idrk I’m panicking right now. Hazel went out to buy some incense and stuff with her grandma and I’m here trying to figure out more information about the doll. Apparently it’s a doll from the 1920’s from the company Hazelle’s (weird coincidence). But it’s weird because the version from their house has different colored clothes and even has a fake gun in it’s hand. 

Something that’s also off about this situation is the doll seems to have … bruises? idk when I saw him the first time there were red marks like if the doll had them painted on which is very odd meaning either the couple painted them or the previous owner/s put that on there. If I also have been hearing a child crying my best guess is this doll is haunted or possessed by a abused and hurt child. 


Should I leave the house tommorrow morning and leave them a note that something came up because I do NOT want to be here anymore.  I felt a lot of negative energy and I don’t think my life is worth risking for 2k.
