Nat had a habit of recommending strange apps. During a late-night video call, she laughed as she told me about one she’d just discovered—an app that tracked your sleep and recorded any sounds you made through the night. She’d tried it the night before and, to her surprise, it had caught her mumbling in her sleep.

"I always thought I was quiet when I slept!" she said, giggling.

I raised an eyebrow.

"You should try it," she insisted.

"I don’t know…"

"Come on, don’t be boring. It’s better than the last one, I promise."

The last one she’d begged me to try was some bizarre app that tracked how often you went to the bathroom. It even connected you with friends so they could see your... habits. Nat thought it was hilarious.

"Absolutely not," I had told her. "Why would I want you to know how often I pee?"

She laughed like it was the best joke in the world.

This new app, though... this one was different. Intriguing. After Nat hung up to answer a call from her sister, I kept thinking about it.

Could I be one of those people who talk in their sleep? Snore? Laugh?

I went about the rest of my evening: walked my dogs, took a shower, ate something light, dried my hair, and climbed into bed. I found myself opening the link Nat had sent. I downloaded the app, registered, and began to explore.

It seemed more sophisticated than I expected. It tracked sleep stages, included meditation guides, and allowed you to set sleep alarms and personalized routines. Curious, I tried one of the guided meditations to help me fall asleep—insomnia had been my silent companion for years.

And, of course, I activated the Night Mode—the feature that would record any sounds I made while sleeping.

The next morning, I opened the app out of sheer curiosity. I hadn’t expected to find anything, really. But when I clicked on the Night Mode tab, there was a new entry: “3 audio clips detected.”

I plugged in my headphones.

The first one was me shifting in bed. The second one was what seemed like a soft snore.

And the third...

My voice. Mumbling. I couldn’t make out much. Just pieces:

"No... I already told you that..."

"It’s not now... not yet..."

The weird thing was, it sounded like I was responding to something. Not just random sleep talk. It had a rhythm, a back-and-forth.

But there was only one voice: mine.

I shook my head and laughed a little nervously. I must’ve been dreaming, that’s all. Maybe I’d watched something weird before bed. Maybe the meditation had done something funky to my brain.

Still, I couldn't help but feel... strange.

That night, I set the app again. Maybe I wanted to prove it was just a fluke.

When I woke up, there were four new clips.

This time, the phrases were clearer.

"I told you to leave me alone."

A pause. Silence. And then:

"No. No, I don’t remember. I’m trying not to."

Again, only my voice.

Only... it didn’t sound like sleep talk. It sounded like a conversation.

By the third night, I couldn’t pretend I wasn’t scared. I activated the Night Mode again. And again, there were recordings.

One in particular made my skin crawl.

"Why do you keep asking me that?"

A pause.

Then my voice again:

"I told you. I’m not ready."

I closed the app. That was it. I needed help.

I texted Cristian. He was studying audiovisual production and knew his way around sound editing. We agreed to meet in one of the university's study rooms after class.

Cristian took longer than usual. His fingers moved quickly over the keyboard, his eyes unblinking. I had stopped pretending I wasn't nervous. I was chewing on my thumbnail without realizing it.

"Got it," he finally said. His voice didn’t sound like I expected. There was no tone of triumph, no relief. It was flat.

I looked at him, and he just gestured for me to put on the headphones. I obeyed.

"I cleaned it up as much as I could. Lowered the background frequencies and boosted the wave that looked structured. I don't know what it is... but it doesn’t sound like interference," he added, barely above a whisper.

He pressed play.

And I heard it.

First, my breathing.  
Then, my voice.

"I don't understand why you keep asking that. I already told you."

Pause.

And then it came.

A voice. Not mine. Not his.  
It wasn’t high-pitched or deep. It was... hollow. As if it came from inside a metal box or a tunnel. A voice without a body.

"**How much longer can you resist without remembering?**"

My heart skipped a beat.

Asleep, I replied: "I don't want to remember. Not again."

Silence. Then that voice: "**You will. Soon.**"

And at the end... a brief laugh. Not mocking. It was... satisfied. As if it knew it had won something.

I tore off the headphones like they were burning my ears. Cristian was as pale as I was.

"Did you record that?" he asked in a whisper.

I shook my head. My hands were trembling.

"I don't know what that is, Cristian. I swear I don't."

Neither of us spoke for a long while. Only the hum of the fans in the study room filled the space. Cristian, who had always laughed at my obsession with the paranormal, now looked like a character from one of the stories I used to tell... only now, we were inside one.

I stood up.

"I'm going to delete the app."

"Are you sure? We could... look into it more. Maybe there’s something we can find out."

"I don’t want to find out anything. Not if it’s about that."

That same night, I deleted the app from my phone. I erased the audio files, the temporary folders, the logs. I even reset the phone to factory settings. Every tiny fragment of that experience—I tore it out like a tumor.

Since then, I haven't used any app to help me sleep.

I haven’t really slept well since either.

The insomnia came back hard. Worse than before. It wasn’t just the difficulty of falling asleep anymore... it was the waiting. Like I knew that as soon as I closed my eyes, someone—or something—would be there waiting for me.

And if it ever spoke to me again, I wouldn’t know. Because I made sure I’d never hear it again while I’m awake.
