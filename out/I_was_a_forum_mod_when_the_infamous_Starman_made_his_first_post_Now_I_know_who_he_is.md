The first time The Starman posted, I was a community mod for a gaming forum.

And the post was just a selfie. Sort of. 

The photo showed someone holding a camera, pointing at himself, but his face was obscured—blurred into the shape of a star. 

It appeared someone had used Photoshop or some editing tool to transform that face into a pixelated, chaotic star. You couldn’t make out any facial features, just that confusing tangle of pixels. The background revealed a drab, gray room with a desk cluttered by dirty dishes. Typical forum user vibes.

The post’s description held only a cryptic line:

**CAN YOU BE THE ONE TO FIND THE STAR AND GET THE PRIZE?** 

My first thought was, “Yeah, it’s right there, staring at me.”

Obviously, that wasn’t the right answer. Early commenters quickly realized this was more than a weird selfie—it was an elaborate scavenger hunt.

Shortly after the post went live, the user who shared it added a comment with a link. Clicking it led to a barren webpage with nothing but an input field for an eight-digit code. No context. No instructions.

It wasn’t the first puzzle I’d seen at the forum. Occasionally, these things appeared, and while I wasn’t a fan, they weren’t against forum rules, so I let them be.

I logged off early that night, falling asleep to some mindless show.

The next morning, I woke to a message from another mod, snooze91, telling me the post had blown up. We’d become good friends through our mod duties, bonding over retro-gaming and progressive metal. Snooze and I were both huge Dream Theater fans.

When I checked the thread, it had over 100 comments. People had been at it all night, hooked on this bizarre enigma. They called OP the ‘*Starman*’.

\*\*\*

At least three phases of the puzzle had been discovered and shared in the comments, Snooze told me.

The first phase emerged when users downloaded the selfie image file and opened it in a text editor, uncovering a long, cryptic string of letters.

The second phase involved deciphering this string using a specific cypher. When applied correctly, the jumble of letters transformed into a URL.

The third phase took those who followed the link to a page on Goodreads, pointing to a particular book. However, this step had stumped the community—no one had cracked it yet.

After catching up on the thread and seeing how far the users had gotten, I found myself genuinely intrigued. I’d always loved crime novels, and while I usually found riddles on the forum annoying, this one had a strange pull.

I parked myself in my ergonomic chair and didn’t moderate a single post that day. Every moment was spent glued to the screen, reading and re-reading comments, and diving deep into the puzzle’s path.

After hours of scrutinizing every clue, I had an idea. In the photo’s long string, most of the text was letters, with only a few numbers: 3, 5, and 1.

“Maybe it’s a page number,” I thought.

I shot a message to Snooze, who immediately agreed it was worth a shot. He bought the ebook from Amazon and was reading it in full to maybe get the answer.

When he sent me a screenshot of the page, it felt like a dead end. Just ordinary text, from an ordinary book.

We read the page over and over until our patience wore thin. But then we noticed something odd—there were more numbers on the page than seemed natural. Following the same approach we’d used with the long string, we noted them down.

The sequence of numbers formed what looked unmistakably like a phone number. Even the area code made sense. Me and Snooze were buzzing with excitement. We didn’t hesitate for a second—we dialed the number immediately.

The call connected to a pre-recorded message. A man’s voice, breathless and erratic, spoke:

*You got it… you got it… Now head to the final phase. The code is A-X-1-J-0-0-L-M. Good luck.*

“It’s the code for the webpage!” I shouted out loud, alone in my room. Almost at the same time, Snooze texted me the exact same thing.

We rushed to input it as quickly as possible. My hands were shaking with anticipation, but as soon as I hit enter, my screen flashed an error. The link had expired.

*"Hey, my link expired after I entered the code. Are you getting the same?"* I messaged Snooze.

A moment later, he sent me a screenshot. A black screen with text in all caps:

**CONGRATULATIONS. YOU FOUND THE CODE.TOMORROW AT 9 AM, YOU’LL MEET THE STARMAN AND GET YOUR PRIZE.**

I stared at the message, feeling a wave of disappointment wash over me. Snooze and I had cracked the puzzle together, but—apparently—only one person could move forward. And he had gotten there first.

Still, I was happy for him. Though we had no idea what “the prize” actually meant, his excitement was contagious. He was practically bouncing off the walls, eager to see what would happen. We agreed to talk later via webcam.

Up until that point, we moderators had only ever known each other through chat. Showing our faces online wasn’t exactly encouraged, but I trusted Snooze. After months of working together, he felt like a best friend.

When we finally hopped on a video call, there were no surprises—just two nerdy white guys barely scraping by. In his case, still living with his parents.

He had all sorts of theories about the Starman puzzle—maybe it was a secret government program scouting for talent, or a private security firm running some elaborate test, or even a bizarre underground game show.

We spent the whole night speculating, throwing out ideas, trying to guess what the prize could be. Whatever it was, Snooze kept insisting he would share it with me. *“We solved it together,”* he repeated.

By the time it was late, we agreed to meet back on the video call when we woke up, and react together to whatever was coming.

And so we did. At 8:55, we were back on the call, waiting.

\*\*\*

We had no idea how the prize would be delivered or how they would even identify Snooze, considering they had never asked for any personal information. I figured there was a 90% chance this was all just a prank.

We waited.

At 9:10, Snooze was visibly disappointed. Just as he was about to suggest we hop into a Marvel Rivals match and forget about the whole thing, I heard it—through his mic.

A loud, heavy knock on his door.

From my view through the camera, I saw the door at the back of his room—clearly visible behind him—shudder from the impact.

Snooze turned, startled. *“Mom? Is that you?”* he called out. No response.

Then, another slam. Just as strong as the first.

*“Who is it?”* His voice was different now—shaky, uncertain.

I just sat there, watching, unable to comprehend what was happening.

Slowly, he got up and approached the door. I heard nothing but silence as he reached for the handle. When he pulled it open, I saw someone standing there.

A man.

He wore the same beat-up clothes from the original Starman selfie. His body was unmistakably human, but from the webcam’s view, I couldn’t see his face—only a star-shaped blur, identical to the one in the photo.

Snooze stood frozen in place, staring at him. The Starman didn’t speak. Neither did he.

They stayed like that for several seconds.

Then, the connection cut off.

I immediately tried calling him back. No response. I messaged him on the chat. Nothing.

I kept trying—throughout the day, that night, in the following weeks. For months, even. He never answered.

Desperate, I reached out to the forum owner, asking if Snooze had logged in. He hadn’t. His account had been inactive since that day.

\*\*\*

All I had were his usernames and an email—most likely a throwaway one, since I found nothing tied to it. I had no way of tracking him down, no real information about who he was in the real world.

For a long time, I kept wondering what had happened to him. I tried to convince myself that maybe the prize had been something grand, something so secret and exclusive that he just couldn’t reach out. Maybe it was exactly like the theories he had shared with me the night before his disappearance.

Not long after, I quit being a mod. I had finally found a real job, and I only visited the board occasionally to check gaming news.

For a long time, there were no new Starman posts. A few copycats showed up, but they were quickly debunked—their unique anonymized keys didn’t match the original.

Then, a year later, he came back.

Someone mentioned it in an old forum chat I was still in. I checked for myself, and it was true. The key matched. It was the same Starman.

And there was another selfie.

A different man—judging by his physique and the new room in the background. But his face?

The same pixelated star blur.

One detail in the image caught my eye. When I downloaded the photo and zoomed in on the background, I noticed a poster taped to the wall.

A Dream Theater album cover. 

Snooze.

By the time I saw the post, users in the thread had already made progress in the new puzzle. Someone had cracked a hidden message buried in the image’s code. After hours of investigation, they finally uncovered a link.

It led to a simple webpage, with nothing on it except a large block of text in all caps:

**HELP ME**
