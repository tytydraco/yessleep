It started slowly at first, so slow that anyone not actively paying attention probably wouldn't have noticed it, but I saw very clearly the way the tall, overgrown grass that grew wild and unchecked in my spacious front yard swayed ever so slightly, as if reaching in my direction whenever I passed by it in the mornings on the way to my car and took note of how the way it wilted seemed to reverse before my eyes when I returned in the evenings, as if my return caused the grass to become... awake somehow. 

I couldn't point to an exact moment in time when all this began, though as I sit down to type this out after seven long days and even longer nights without leaving my house I'm acutely aware of how insane it must sound, but doesn't this awareness mean that I am in fact not insane? Afterall, truly insane people never question their own sanity. I've lived in this house since my childhood, my father purchased it from an old friend when he was in his 20's and kept it until his passing at the age of 65, shortly after he passed legal ownership of the place onto me. 

I can say with confidence that whatever is happening on my property is not a haunting. There is no sordid history associated with my house, no previous owners that died in unsavory ways, no blood-soaked scandals or dubious happenings that one could point to as the origin of a supernatural disturbance. 

I don't know if such things actually happen in real life, but what my experience in this house has taught me is that people often lean on such ideas to comfort themselves and to explain the unexplainable. To impose rules, regulations, and a measure of control on something that cannot be controlled. Afterall, if some malicious presence that infects a house is in fact of human origin, then it must have some measure of familiar humanity that can be appealed to, Some unfinished business that can be put to rest so that the presence will relent and show mercy to those it haunts. It's a comfortable idea, but little else in my opinion. 

*Tap. tap.*

There it is again, the subtle tapping outside my bedroom window, quiet at first, almost the like the bashful caress of a young lover trying to sneak in before the neighbors notice, before it rises in pace and volume and then starts to sound more like someone indignantly beating against the window demanding that I let them in, the force of each tap threatening to crack the glass until I rush over to the window with my gun at my side and pull back the curtain only to see an empty yard  and an unusually tall batch of grass brushing against my window, that almost looked as if it was waving at me as it swayed in the gentle breeze of the summer night.  Sometimes this will go on for several hours a night, and I've long since given up on trying to do anything about it. 

*Tap tap tap.* 

I planned to ignore it, to let whatever insidious force that was growing in my yard know that it had no power in my home, only to be surprised when my phone rang out in the darkness after an hour or so of tapping. I answered it absentmindedly, glad to have a distraction from the strange phenomenon that now plagued my sleepless nights. 

" Hello?" I asked. 

&#x200B;

" Won't you come dance with me Hector?" A sickly-sweet voice asked. 

&#x200B;

"Who is this?" 

&#x200B;

" I've watched you for so long, seen you sprout from a seedling and grow into what you are now, so handsome, so strong. Won't you come out and dance with me?" 

&#x200B;

 The voice was low and threatening, and almost sounded as if it was coming through clenched teeth. 

&#x200B;

*tap tap tap.* 

&#x200B;

" Whoever this is, I want nothing to do with you! never call me again." 

&#x200B;

*TAP TAP TAP.* 

" Don't you remember how you used to play in the yard Hector? How you used to run your fingers through my grass? I felt your warmth in my roots, and I knew that one day we would dance together won't you come outside?" 

*TAP TAP TAP TAP* 

&#x200B;

*"* I won't!" 

&#x200B;

After a moment or two of tense silence the sweet voice spoke out again. 

&#x200B;

" Your father can't keep us apart anymore sweet Hector, all of you come from me, and all of you will return to me, eventually." 

&#x200B;

Then the voice laughed, a genuine laugh the kind of which is only made by someone who knew that they were in control, and I felt something sharp prickle against my ear causing me to drop my phone and I looked on in horror as tall green grass grew out of the phone's receiver. 

I haven't gone outside since then, haven't even left my room. My family and friends have stopped by a few times to check on me but I always yell at them to leave from the window as loud as I can before they reach the yard. I know I can't keep this up forever, but I don't know what else to do. As I type this, I can see the last rays of the sun fall behind the horizon, and I know what's coming, what's waiting in the tall grass. 

*tap tap tap.*
