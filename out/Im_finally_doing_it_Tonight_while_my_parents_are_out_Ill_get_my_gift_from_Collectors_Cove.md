It's been years since I was first told the story of the Star Pool by my dad. I'd left him no choice but to tell me where the 'driftwood' had come from after many years obsessing over it, constantly pestering him about where it'd come from and why it looked the way it did. Sat atop the mantelpiece of the fireplace, the driftwood seemed anything but a piece of seaworn debris. The taller I grew, the better I was able to gawk at the glistening-wet, copper coloured quality of the object and the intricate series of tube like structures contained within its hollow. It reminded me very much of a tuba and other suchlike instruments; having a designed structure of such complexity for a very specific purpose. Not to suggest that this had any outwardly obvious purpose... I just think my dad thought it looked nice up there by the family photos.  
Anyway, the story (different versions of which I've heard from multiple sources over the years) goes like this:

  
After a few days of bad weather in which the sea threatens to swallow up the land and our town with it, a fog is known to roll in before abruptly stopping at the shoreline not far behind our church and the wood that borders it. Through the wood and past the gravestones lie outcroppings of stone among steep cliffs that jut outwards and into the water, giving one the impression that they continue on into their very depths and stop the land itself from collapsing inwards. It's between two of these outcroppings that Collector's Cove is located. On any other day, there's not much worthy of mention about the cove other than the peaceful silence that the secluded space encapsulates. When the fog rolls in at night, however, the tide seems to withdraw itself, taking along anything with it. What passes the fog is never returned but is instead compensated with something else as the tide resumes its outwards flow, sending the fog inland with it. It was here that my dad received the driftwood in exchange for a once beloved toy truck.

  
I remember being awestruck by this tale and its implications. Where did the truck go? Where did the driftwood come from? What would happen if a person swam out into the fog? Where would they go?  
Despite being of an impressionable age, I knew there was a degree of truth to this story. Firstly, the driftwood had to have come from somewhere. It certainly didn't look like something you could get anywhere else, not in this part of the country, anyway. Secondly, and decisively, my mum believed it too. My mum, a woman who had her feet firmly grounded in reality. My mum, the only truly sensible person in the house that was not be teased with.  
It just so happened that she herself had received a gift from the waters she referred to as "the Star Pool". It didn't cross my mind at the time to ask her why she'd called it that because I was hoping to see what she'd been given. To my dismay, it turned out that once Mum had retrieved it from the water to better study, the thing had shattered into a fine powder which slipped through her fingertips and onto the rough sand underfoot. She'd given a high-heeled shoe, explaining that she'd worn it on her wedding day and saved it from breaking on the dance floor as its partner did. It was clear from her smile just how much the shoe had meant to her. Could she not have chosen something else to bring? It didn't sound like a very fair trade to me. I'd have tried again.

  
It was our neighbour, Grant, who told me why trying again wasn't an option. Grant was an older man who lived alone with his little terrier, Poppy, and spent the majority of his time tending to his garden. He looked after his plants with the attentiveness of a concerned parent and would gladly humour me while I stuck my nose over the fence on hot summer days. If he was a parent, then his favourite child was unquestionably the grey shrub in the far corner of his humble back garden by a stone birdbath. I'd seen nothing like it before. It'd always been there from what I remember with my earliest thought in regards to it being "why is it dead"? Only after it rained did its flowers bloom in a dazzling display of yellow which inviting bees by the thousands to vitsit in the days before they again closed, seemingly all at once. As beautiful as it seemed at times, I couldn't shake off the thought that it didn't quite fit in. I'd seen some old black and white photos of my grandparents and these came to mind when looking at the matte, jagged and upwards pointed leaves of the dead bush, as I secretly called it. Innocently, I asked Grant about his grey plant and where he got it from. Was it local? Taking off his soiled gloves, he walked towards the diving fence, casting a look around our garden. As if satisfied that nobody else was present, he gave me an expectant look before sighing and asking me if I'd been told about the cove behind St. Faber's.

  
The cove, as it happened was not in fact called Collector's Cove but instead something that my mind chose to shrug off in light of this new revelation (Grant knew!). Locals had known about the place long before even he was born and ascribed to it a variety of different names. Some of these names didn't quite register with my understanding of the English language. Here are a few:

  
- The Angel Beach  
- Crossover Pass  
- Adam's Retreat

  
While retreived "jetsam", as he referred to it as, seemed invariably random for each person who gave to the waters, it was widely believed that the better the item taken, the better the item given back. This meant that countless artefacts, heirlooms and other items of value were passed over in the hopes of obtaining something considered to be better. The inexplicable nature of the things returned from the fog convinced most that their exchange was worthwhile. Some, it seemed, were dissatisfied and returned at later dates to test their luck. For these people, the fog, instead of moving along with the coming tide, remained where it was, taking the water back with it. "They like to see how much a person's willing to lay aside, seems like. I'm sure whoever's over made a mint of all that crap!" I felt it was very grown-up of me to be laughing at a joke with a swear word in it. All the same, I felt a mixture of conflicting feelings at the mention of "they". "Strange, though, how they never want back any of their own stuff... Just floats to the other side out to sea. Waste if you ask me".

  
Following successive offerings, great storms are said to burst forth from seemingly nowhere and caused much destruction and harm in Grant's past. More often than not, a culprit would come forth, confessing to repeated attempts at getting back what they were apparently owed. These people were shunned by the community for causing such disruption to their otherwise tranquil lives and often packed up what they had left before moving along. Grant once had a schoolmate by the name of Toby McClen who was swept away to another down south by an admonishing and flustered mother after causing a week's worth of flooding. He'd practically thrown away all of her jewellery with nothing, not one thing other than his shame, to show for it.

  
"Never did tell me what washed ashore. Sad, really, 'cause he seemed a bright enough lad. Just seemed small and frightened when he got up off his pew and confessed to the whole congregation. Never did speak much after that. Must've hit him hard. And if that weren't hard enough I'm sure his mammy hit 'im even harder. Shame".

  
When asking if he knew of any others, he gave pause before explaining that a lady known for her contribution to the church choirs piercing range ("haven't the foggiest what her name was now") up and vanished having presumably being overwrought with guilt. Once the storm subsided, concerned neighbours made it their duty to check in on her, only to find her house filled with a dizzying array of entirely outlandish items. "Some of these... Things, we'll call 'em, were hard to look at. Can't properly explain it" he said while running his eyes, "like looking through the wrong pair of prescriptions. Hurt my head, like. Dog had obviously come in through 'er kitchen window and 'ad the cats, poor things. Bashed right through, seemed like. A big bugger!"

  
At that moment Poppy hopped from the kitchen doorway to happily skip along the freshly cut grass in search for a place to wee. Trotting beside the fence opposite to the one we were stood at with her nose down, Poppy abruptly stopped to look at the dead bush. Averting her gaze and giving it a wide berth, she proceeded to do her business further away before rushing over to her masters leg. The idea of Poppy jumping through a window stuck me as funny. It really would have to have been a big dog.

  
Fast forward by a few years and here I am now in my current predicament. With Mum and Dad going out for the night after a three day spell of miserable weather, the opportunity I've been anticipating is at long last finally opening to me. I already know what it is I'm taking with me: my old DS. I haven't played on it ever since Dad got me my PlayStation, so I don't really mind giving it away. In its current condition, I can't imagine it's worth much; the battery only lasting an hour at a time and the hinges coming apart between the screens, but it's served me well over the years. Maybe They'll recognise this and deem me worthy of something good in return.

  
I've promised Mum and Dad that I'll be in bed for 8pm and play on my PlayStation until then. Mum wasn't keen on the idea of leaving me alone but conceded to Dads pleas that they'll only be for an hour or two and that Grant's usually up reading at this hour, anyway. Saying goodbye to them from the top of the staircase I was shaking with anticipation under my pyjamas. This is it! Wait for the car to leave, DS from nightstand, overtrousers on, jacket, boots, torch from the key basket and off we go. Graham's upstairs light is on so I make an effort not to make too much noise while closing the front door while leaving. It'll take me 5 minutes to rush down the road, turn into the square and make it to St. Faber's.



Against the brickwork of the church and desperate for breath, I stand by watching for any sign of activity. It seems unlikely that anybody would be outside at this hour, but getting caught is not an option. I've never been explicitly told not to visit Collector's Cove so it was only a matter of time, really. I couldn't be blamed for being curious. I could, however, be blamed for breaking the trust of my parents. I don't know what I'd do with myself if I had my PlayStation was taken away from me - I only got it last year for my birthday. Sure that nobody was watching me from across the street, I switch on my torch and follow the path through the wood and past the graveyard.

  
The graveyard's never bothered me, really. Hours spent running among the trees after Sunday services have helped me to understand how important those headstones are to relatives and the memory of their loved ones. While they're likely just dust and bones now, the people buried here were in life just that. People. A lot of them, judging from the dates I could actually make out, lived good, long lives and some even have descendants still living in town! It's comforting to know that we're never really gone. Thoughts of heaven in turn reminded me of a name once used for Collector's Cove. Grants mention of 'The Angel Beach' had at the time upset something within me that I couldn't put my finger on.  His use of the word 'They' made my eyes water a little and they were doing the same thing now. Wiping my eyes, I took one last look at the stones and the inky shadows that my torch cast behind them. The face of an angel peered back at me from an askew headstone and brought on a sensation akin to having a hand-sized spider scurry across my back. I moved on.

  
From my religious upbringing, I had a vague idea of what Angels had to give, but what could they possibly want to take?

  
As it so happened, the path to the cliff face and the cove secreted below was already laid out for me. It didn't seem like anybody had been this way for a while, but the rut that cut through the ground was clearly travelled. Heavier foliage had been stripped away to a provide a more direct route to the sound of waves dashing against the rocks.

  
I tried in my mind to recall the last time we as a town had experienced weather similar in scale to the deluge brought about by Toby McClens excessive offerings. There had been a few minor floodings some years ago but nothing impactful enough to leave a lasting memory. So nobody was trying to exploit the fogs generosity. Maybe knowledge of this place had been fading over the years. Maybe it just wasn't worth losing something special over. Maybe people had nothing special left to give. Questions after questions after questions flooded in to drown out the sound of blown leaves and squelching dirt.

  
The fog.

  
A wall of murky grey stretching forever in both directions, motionless but for the movement of waves below which gave it the illusion of swaying ever so slightly back and forth as if ready to tip and fall.

  
The moon, just visible behind this spectral curtain, provided just enough light to see by. Walking further towards the what felt like the edge of the world, I peered down to where the sea seemed to flow gently inland. Considering the force of the waves I could see sending up explosions of white against the outcroppings just off to the sides, it was confusing to see how surely this segment of the water seemed to flow.
