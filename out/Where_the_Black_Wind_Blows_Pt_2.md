**Mary II**

Mary must’ve dozed off in her chair, as she sharply awoke to the sound of someone unceremoniously rapping against the front door. There was really only one person it could be, yet she couldn’t shake off the wrongness felt whenever she looked outside. Even opening the door was a challenge in itself. Mary slowly got out of the chair, lightly groaning as her joints and back creaked. She wasn’t that old, but her relative sedentarism was already starting to take its toll, becoming especially evident whenever waking up. She involuntarily gasped as a flare of sharp pain attacked her side, with it thankfully subsiding just as quickly as it had come. As Mary turned the old door’s knob, she tried to avert her eyes so as to put the outside in her peripheral vision. 

“Hey Mary,” Rose said as she stood in the doorway, a forced smile plastered on her face. She was holding two bulging plastic bags presumably filled with groceries.

“Hey,” Mary replied, rather halfheartedly.

“You fine if I come in? I take it you’re not gonna want to help me bring the stuff in,” Rose said brusquely, not waiting for an answer before stepping inside. This wasn’t out of the ordinary. Mary had been feeling an increasing tension each time that Rose stopped by, which was compounded by the more frequent visits. She was needing Rose more and more often, something that she was not proud of, but that she justified with the idea that they would otherwise see each other only very rarely. Even so, the tension was making Mary feel uncomfortable in her own house. She was already brought enough discomfort from the outdoors, and did not much care for the idea of her only safe space being similarly bastardized. 

Rose quickly dropped the groceries on the red seat where Mary had just been sleeping, quickly turning around to grab the rest from the trunk of her vehicle. Mary couldn’t help but notice that she was only given a single ambivalent glance as Rose went back through the open door. Clearly something was making her more upset than usual. Mary wasn’t stupid, she knew coming here had been hard for Rose ever since their parents passed, but she couldn’t understand why it was being taken out on her. It wasn’t like Rose to let things fester. Usually, if she wanted to say something, she would just say it to your face. Mary recalled that she was not an outlier in that equation, making it all the stranger as to why this was any different. 

As Rose came back in with more groceries, Mary willed herself to speak up. “Are you doing alright? You seem upset at me.”

“What?” Rose responded, visibly caught off guard.

“I asked if I did something to upset you,” Mary mumbled, all the courage to continue the conversation having left her.

“No, it’s not you. I don’t mean to offend, but I can’t stand being here. It gets a little harder to come every time, and…” Rose’s voice trailed off, unwilling to vocalize what she was truly thinking.

Mary was rather shocked by how candid Rose was being. It wounded her deeply to know that these visits were likely an object of dread for her twin. She wished they could be more similar in terms of opinion, as the passing of her parents only reaffirmed her love of the house and farm. If she was ever tempted to leave before, she most certainly wasn’t intending on it now. It was the only thing she had left. You may not be able to hold or be held by a construct of wood and insulation, but a house can be its own comfort. A place where memories are only a glance away, and where it felt like nothing bad could happen. Just being within its walls was an embrace unto itself, stale air and all. Rose would never understand. She had been away far too long to appreciate what Mary saw in the place. Even so, a great pit in her stomach had started to form as the realization hit her; she was the one shackle chaining Rose to a place she wanted nothing to do with. 

“What else were you going to say?” Mary said quietly, preparing herself for the worst.

“I don’t know if you want to hear this.”

“No, I do. You know I’m an overthinker, and it will hurt me far more not hearing about it. Whatever it is, I won’t hold it against you,” Mary stated, though she wasn’t even sure she believed what she was saying.

“I can’t take care of you forever,” Rose said flatly. Mary blinked for a second, processing the implications of that statement before Rose continued. “We’re both gonna get old eventually, and I can’t keep coming back here. What are you going to do if I get sick or hospitalized? And what if I…”

Mary knew what Rose had been about to say. It was a question that she wouldn’t have had an answer to. It was the question of what she would do if Rose died before her. All it would take was one unfortunate event, just like with their parents. As much as a house can be a comfort, it cannot provide in the way a person can. For a long time, it had been her parents, and now it was her twin. But what next? There was no one left. Rose was the last person in her life. After that, there would be no bulwark to keep the world from closing in, eager to shred her apart with its apathetic fangs. No amount of walls would keep life from moving forward. No amount of delaying could keep age from creeping in. Mary hardly noticed that she had started to tear up, the weight of all those worries bearing down heavier than any burden could, imagined or otherwise. It was all too much.

“I’m sorry, Mary. But I genuinely don’t know if I can keep doing this in good conscience. It just feels wrong to watch you unable to live your own life,” Rose said, noticing Mary’s tears.

In that moment, Mary’s sadness dissipated, being replaced with an anger she had forgotten that she even possessed. Unable to live your own life? Mary could understand some of the other statements, but that one crossed a rubicon for her. Just because she was living her life in a different way than her sister didn’t mean it wasn’t her own. There was nothing wrong with being attached to the place you grew up in. Admittedly, the dependence was something she could work on, but she never asked for it. You don’t just one day decide to fear the outside. It was never in her control, nor was it a wound someone else could allay with a bandage. Here she was, being told that her life wasn’t in her own control by a person who had never experienced something like that. She really thought Rose was better than that.

“Glad to hear that you think I’m out of control,” Mary spat, anger taking over.

“You know I never said that. I just think you need help, this isn’t sustainable,” Rose said, trying her best to maintain a semblance of calmness. She really did not want to get in a fight with Mary right now. It was almost scary seeing her like this. Usually Mary was the calm and quiet one. During their teenage years Rose would even quite callously refer to her as a human doormat, something that she would regret once the problems started with leaving the house.

“You think I don’t know I need help? How much it hurts to know that I always need someone? That I’ll probably never be able to live in full independence? Or do you just care about your own convenience,” Mary stated, unable to stop herself from unloading all frustrations.

“That’s not true. I’m giving you a pass for saying that because I know you’re angry, but you cannot talk to me like that. If I only cared about my own convenience, why have I been supplying you up to this point?” Rose said, attempting to remain reasonable. She wasn’t sure she would be able to stop herself from lashing back if Mary said something else like that. She wasn’t a robot, after all.

“I don’t know. Why have you been? It’s pretty obvious to me that you don’t want to be here anymore,” Mary yelled, her voice laced with venom. She regretted it the moment she said it, but it was too late to take it back now.

“You know what? No. We’re not doing this. I’ll see you next week,” Rose said, having reached her limit. She wasn’t going to allow herself to get too angry at Mary, as that would only make the situation worse, so she opted to just leave instead. Maybe things could cool off that way. She quickly left through the open door to get the rest of the stuff she brought before coming back in and depositing it on the floor without a word. Rose then exited back out the door, firmly closing it behind her and leaving Mary with only her thoughts.

Mary numbly went through the groceries that her sister had brought, picking out each item and giving it a lookover. She never gave Rose a detailed list of what she wanted outside of essentials, leaving it up to her to make the decisions as to what to get. None of it was registering though, as she was fully in panic mode. At worst, that would be the last time she would be seeing Rose. Mary knew that what she had said had hurt. She intended it to in the moment. She picked out the phrases she thought would be the most painful to hear. She knew that it had been childish of her to act that way, but what did it matter now? What’s done is done, and she would be lucky to get back in contact with Rose. Burdened by thoughts of how badly she had messed up, Mary threw the groceries in the fridge without heed for what they were. She then got back into the soft, red chair near the back of the living room, waiting for nothing and no one in particular.

**Rose II**

Rose jammed the keys into the ignition, not giving even a passing glance to the mirror as she prepared to pull out of the property. The gray clouds she had seen forming on the way now blanketed the sky, threatening to weep down upon her at any second. The last thing she wanted to deal with right now was rain. As she reversed to face the dirt road leading back to the highway, Rose was hit with a pang of despair. Things would not be the same with Mary from here on out. Even if they patched everything up, the lingering tension would still be there, putting a pit in their stomachs each time they interacted. It would become unbearable. A layer of trust and security had been irrevocably broken. 

Mary was always a person who put up walls in service of her fear. Rose was similar, only the walls she built were constructed from grief. She knew this, but knowing did not make preventing it any easier. It was both grief and the possibility of grief that created the walls. Forming relationships was hard, especially knowing that they could fall apart at any moment, whether that be by the blade of circumstance or death. It was for that reason that Rose opted not to form new relationships for the longest time. She was cold to her coworkers, had severed contact with the extended family, and sparsely interacted with her own twin outside of providing for her. It felt easier that way, to be assured that there would be no one to grieve over. But that feeling was a poison. It started with listlessness, and progressed into something more akin to self-hatred. It was a soothing poison, yes, but a poison nonetheless.

As Rose merged onto the highway, the first droplet of rain splattered across her windshield. The rain only intensified as she passed back through her hometown, seeing those architectural skeletons looking sadder than ever. The golden stalks of corn drooped as they too were besieged by the ambivalent storm. She needed to talk to someone and now, if for no other reason than to calm her frayed nerves from the altercation. After watching ahead of her for vehicles, Rose looked down to her phone that was again placed precariously on her lap. She hovered her finger over the call button for Jonah. He was the one rock in her life, the raft she had clung on to for the past month. Perhaps it was wrong of her to glorify an obviously imperfect person, and perhaps they were not bound to last, but he at least was there for her. The walls she had erected had come down to let him and only him in, a necessary evil in the name of emotional self-preservation. He was the only person other than Mary in her life that she could truly grieve over, and that both thrilled and terrified her. Steeling herself, Rose pressed to start the call.

“Hey Rose. Everything going alright?”

“Not really,” Rose responded, a slight trembling evident in her voice. She hated admitting to other people that she wasn’t doing okay. She felt like a burden whenever she did it. As if she was forcing other people to help her deal with her shit. Of course, that was ridiculous, but the tendency to think in that way was hard to break.

“What happened?” Jonah asked in a tone creased with concern.

“I got into a fight with my sister,” Rose replied.

“Like, a physical fight, or..?” 

“God no. It was just a verbal fight,” Rose said. She knew it wasn’t ‘just’ a verbal fight, but couldn’t stop herself from downsizing the issue. The thought of her and her sister throwing punches at each other was an amusing one, though.

“Okay. Good. I mean, not good, but you get what I’m saying,” Jonah said, trying to supply at least a little levity. It didn’t work in the slightest.

“Yeah, there’s definitely some stuff that’s been boiling over for a while. You don’t just say the stuff she said without thinking about it at least once before. It kinda hurt,” Rose said, trying to keep her emotions concealed. In reality, she was close to tearing up over it, but refused to allow that. She didn’t need to further concern Jonah.

“So it was that type of fight,” Jonah said empathetically. It was pretty clear that he had gone through a similar rodeo before. “I take it that it really feels right now as if there’s nothing you can do to make it better?”

“Yeah, something like that,” Rose mumbled, slightly surprised at Jonah’s understanding. He wasn’t normally the emotionally mature type. The fact that he seemed to understand scared her a little, as she was banking on him saying something stupid. She could convert her sadness into annoyance, and let it out on him. A selfish desire, yes, but anything was better than feeling what she was currently feeling. 

“Is there anything I can do?” Jonah asked, bringing Rose back to the present.

“I don’t really think so, unless you want to meet my twin under these circumstances,” Rose said, forcing a hint of false humor into the conversation. She really didn’t want to let on how much it was truly affecting her, especially knowing that Jonah would take it seriously. She wanted him to make jokes about it. To be insensitive. It would make everything feel a little less real. Now, there was no escaping the fact that one of the two positive relationships she had maintained had cracks forming in its glass

“I was wondering why you were calling me so soon after our call earlier. Normally it takes a couple hours. I guess I have my answer. I’m really sorry this is happening to you right now,” Jonah said, sounding awfully genuine. It was like Rose was talking to a different person. It was uncanny how he was acting. Then again, she had never really come to him with an issue that deeply affected her, so perhaps that was the explanation. 

“Look. I’ll uh… I’ll call you back when I’m close to home. Actually, no, you’ll be at work by then. I’ll just leave a message,” Rose said, trying to prematurely end the call. It was getting a little too real for her

“Okay. I meant what I said earlier, though. If you need anything at all, please let me know. I realize it doesn’t always seem like it, but I care,” Jonah finished, ending the call only a moment after.

Rose had been so thoroughly engrossed in the call that she had hardly given notice to how much the wind had picked up, whipping the droplets of rain against her windshield with a surprising amount of force. The fields of tall grass she passed by were all bent and folded downwards, the tip of the blades touching the ground. It was becoming very difficult to see what was in front of her, with the wipers doing little to abate the unending torrent of water. It was like being sprayed with a firehose. It wasn’t abnormal for this sort of thing to happen during the Spring months, but it rarely struck with this level of intensity. There wasn’t even anywhere to pull off to and wait out the storm, as she was now firmly in the middle of nowhere. The next scantling of civilization was at least 20 miles away, with the land otherwise being dotted with solitary farmhouses that were dubious in their safety. The only thing to do was to keep going and stay vigilant.

The road became no easier to travel over the next ten minutes, with the seemingly infinite flood of rain still obscuring vision. Rose felt a few large bumps as she continued onwards, likely some branches that had been washed directly into her path. It was a little scary, but manageable, and she almost preferred the tension she was feeling now to the earlier conversation with Mary. It felt strange to think that way, finding perceived danger more overwhelming than actual danger, but Rose opted not to dwell on it. The last thing she wanted was to be dealing with a rough situation while thinking about another. Maintaining rationality is easier said than done though, and she still found her thoughts drifting back to the conversation even as she drove down the precarious path. 

Finally away from the fields and in view of adjacent forests, Rose calmed her nerves, knowing that she was mere minutes away from a gas station at which she could stop. She then fought back a stab of panic as she suddenly felt herself losing control of the car. She had never experienced hydroplaning before, but knew that’s what was happening from all the descriptions she had heard of it. The pit in her stomach was comparable to that of someone in free fall as she tried her best to slow down and regain control. Rose was always so worried about driver’s hypnosis that she never considered how many other variables might play into a crash, but it was too late to reflect on that. She was approaching a bend in the road and was still skidding too fast to stop, leaving her no choice but to brace for impact. The impact came as she slammed into an outcropping in front of one of the thin trees which surrounded her. Rose’s world went to black the moment her head made contact with the steering wheel.
