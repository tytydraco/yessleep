I had just moved into a new apartment complex, and already I feel like I am going crazy. A friend of mine suggested I should start writing down what has been bothering me as of lately, she gave me this site to post my stories for others to see. So here I am. Making some online journal. The internet in my area isn’t so great, despite paying for WIFI. I had to stand in the right spot in order to get an okay signal. It probably sounds ridiculous that I’d have so much trouble, considering there is a broadcast station five miles away. You would think I had the best seat in the house, but you’d be wrong.

I am here because I think I’m being haunted either by the previous tenants or something else. I feel like I’m going bonkers, you know padded white room crazy. You’d think the manager would knock down my rent because its haunted? Not really, he thinks I’m fabricating it all for that reason, he said the last tenants tried the same. In his words, jokes on them, (they died by the way), and I had thought it wouldn’t be so bad. *No KC don’t rent that apartment*, unfortunately I did not listen to my best friend.

My name is KC, I do not have any fancy college degrees. As soon as I graduated, I got a job at the local supermarket, and saved enough to move out of my parent’s basement, and judgement eyes. Three weeks ago, I had moved into my new spacious one-bedroom apartment on the third floor. I live in a small town, enough to be left alone from others who don’t give a shit as much as I do. Right now, I’m sitting in the laundry room that’s located in the basement of my building. The only spot I can get a tiny bit of a signal on my phone. It’s freezing, my fingers feel numb, but its better than not having any internet at all.

If you live locally, which I highly doubt you do, we’ve probably bumped into each other on the street, or I rang up your groceries at the supermarket. I wouldn’t say my town is surrounded by a lot of acres of forest nor would I say there’s too little. But the most exciting thing to ever happen in our town was the 10:00 am freight train couldn’t stop fast enough because of a fawn stood in the middle of the tracks, the train flipped and spilled out an almost endless supply of Twinkies. All the kids and adults in the neighborhood was bringing pillowcases to stuff them full. The second most exciting thing to ever happen was a senior prank that still lives on as a legend in our town for years to come. a bunch of seniors dressed up as electricians and went to every single home pretending to inspect it when they were planting hard boiled eggs. They had left a message on the News Board that the town uses to catch up on the latest news or read articles, that they hid eggs in every single home and apartment. The first person to find the plastic egg wins a million dollars. You can guess what happened.

The whole town went into a frenzy, not only because of the money, but because every house started to smell like rotten eggs after a month in the hot summer heat that took over our town. That year, even the government would have put a dome over our town for being the foulest smelling town. That was two years ago, until this day no one has not found that plastic egg, rumor has it, there was never a plastic egg to begin with. But some still look for it.

But all that aside, I did mention that I may be haunted, didn’t I? Honestly, I don’t think it’s any of the neighbors or the manager pulling a prank on me. How do I know? well I would have to say the night I moved into my apartment I was taking a shower. Side note, when I shower, I like to sing, I don’t know if I am horrible or not, because I honestly don’t do it for others. Singing relaxes me, I even do it when I’m anxious, or cold, or even when I am happy. I was in the shower, normal as it could be. That is until I got out of my shower, you know, the mirrors get fogged up from the steam, at the time I had wrapped a towel around me. I stood in shock at the foggy mirror. Written on the foggy mirror said, “YOU HAVE A LOVELY VOICE”—I live alone. I took a picture of it and sent it to my manager’s office.

Later that night I had just unpacked my last box, when I saw a cockroach walking like a human across the hard wood floor. His little antennas flicked here and there; I was frozen to the spot. I couldn’t help but watch this cockroach walking upright through my apartment with a tiny little broom in its legs or hands? It swept dirt into a corner and disappeared behind my entertainment center, that night I had put out cockroach sticky traps all over the floor. If you’re wondering if I caught him, I didn’t.

Another time, that same week I was taking out the trash, the dumpster is only thirty feet away from my building, which was the best. The manager said the dumpster gets emptied twice a week. I had tied the black garbage bag, and went down the creaky stairs, every building in the apartment complex does not have elevators. So, unless you lived on the main floor, everyone had to take the stairs. It was extremely dark outside at the time, I made my way towards the dumpster. Right when I was going to throw my bag of garbage in it, I heard rustling sounds coming from inside. I watch those animal rescue shows, my first thought was that it could have been a kitten or a puppy. So immediately I dropped my garbage, I remembered I forget my phone in the apartment. But attached on my keychain along with my apartment keys and a fob key was a small flashlight so I shone the light into the dark dumpster and what I saw had rendered me speechless and terrified. I saw a severed arm in the dumpster. It gave me a thumbs up as I shone the light on it. I said nope, and quickly walked back to my building and safely back up to my apartment until I realized I left my garbage in front of the dumpster hopefully no one saw me leave it there.

I think when I realized I was being haunted was the week after, when my best friend had suggested calling in a Psychic Medium to cleanse my apartment. It took me a bit to find one that was in my price range. I had called her up and told her what was happening to me, and she did agree I had a haunting in my apartment, so she agreed to do a sage cleansing for me. I was almost hopeful that it would help me, almost.

When the day came for the cleansing, the Medium showed up, she reminded me of a cliché hippie goth, long wavy hair, she wore a black dress, lots and lots of jewelry around her neck and fingers. She greeted me at the door with a hug, and she gave me some sort of pink crystal and told me that it will help with keeping the bad spirits away. She had asked me to step out of the apartment for a while, while she *communicated* with he spirits inside of my apartment. I told her I had no problem with it. But a bad feeling went right through my internal intestines, I was not sure if it was the Mexican food I ate or the feeling that something was going to happen.

I went out for a walk for a while, when I got back to my building to head back to my apartment, I heard a wailing coming from my apartment. Immediately I had sprung to action and opened my door. I found the Medium was cowering in the corner of my living room her hand was covered in blood. Her blood was smeared all over my entire apartment. She was babbling nonsense about demons, her eyes weren’t fixed on anything, as she kept a firm grip on one of her necklaces as she prayed to God. I called the ambulance. I had to give a statement and the cops were baffled when I told them I had hired her to cleanse my apartment and I heard her screaming when I got back from my walk. A few days later I had gotten a call from the first responding officer who had taken my statement and told me that the Medium is going to be spending some time in a psychiatric ward for a while, and that they believe she wasn’t a real Medium. But a scammer, who pretends to be a Psychic Medium and that she was planning on robbing me blind. But instead, she had a mental breakdown, there was no evidence that I did anything to her. That and of course the officer had said there was others who had been robbed by her. He did say she was missing a finger, as if someone cut it off or bit it off, and the Medium had told the officer a demon bit her finger off. Which I thought was strange.

I couldn’t help but feel on edge, I glanced about my entire apartment, and asked out loud, half-jokingly, “Hey, whoever is haunting me, did you make that woman go crazy?”

No response, just silence greeted me.

“Yeah, I didn’t think so either. I’m going crazy myself.” I clucked my tongue and sighed nervously.

I had started cleaning up my apartment, the blood seemed to be everywhere plus my entire apartment was in disarray and to be honest I wasn’t sure if it was the so-called Medium or the ghosts that haunted my apartment. As I was cleaning up, I had noticed there was more pools of blood in my bedroom carpet and seeing some of my mother’s jewelry in my bedroom strung out the floor, including my mom’s wedding ring on the floor. But that wasn’t all, there was a woman’s finger in the ring, I picked it up and felt a chill run down my spine. With a closer inspection, it did look like someone did bite it off. . .

“What the fuck?” I whispered to myself.

I slid my mothers ring off the finger and I placed the severed finger in a sandwich baggie and called the police officer back and told him I found the finger. He did swing by and pick it up, I would have written the whole situation off as one of those weird moments that is now becoming a regular situation in my life. If not, what happened later that night.

I had taken a shower to wash that woman’s blood off me, and when I pulled the curtain back after turning the water off and getting done with my shower. Written in the steamed-up mirrors, — “YOU ARE WELCOME”— and I just stared at it.

It sounds silly, but one of the most terrifying feelings must be someone writing messages in my foggy mirror after I take a shower. My heart was racing as I quickly got dressed and ran to my bed like a scared little child and hid under the covers for the rest of the night. But I couldn’t sleep that night, I kept seeing unidentifiable shadows across my bedroom wall. So, I turned my bedroom light on because I will admit I was scared what could have been lurking in the shadows in my room. I know its irrational to think there is a demon or monster hiding in my bed or closet. But you’d bet I had checked those before slipping back into bed without turning my lights off that night.

That morning when I woke up, I saw wet boot prints facing my bed, as if someone had been standing over my bed and watched me sleep. I followed those footsteps to my bathroom, and apparently, they started from the mirror. It sounds unbelievable, but there was a boot print on the mirror, then another on the sink countertop and it carried on to the lid of the toilet seat then the floor. And they walked to my room, I don’t know what to make of it at all. I had been jumping with every creak in my apartment. I was being paranoid and felt as if I wasn’t the only one living in this apartment anymore.

Unfortunately, I’m out of time to type this up. If anything, else weird goes on, I might post another update until then hopefully I’ll see you next time. And one more thing, is there anything that can explain the footprints coming out of the mirror? The cockroach is back, and he’s making coffee, such a tiny little cup.
