I always believed we needed to let go of the ones we've lost, no matter how much it hurts. But no one warned me what to do if they came back—how grief, pain, and sorrow, things I was so sure were real, could suddenly feel like lies.

I was seven when he died. Back then, I never truly understood how much his presence meant to me. The memory of his last days still haunts me: the antiseptic hospital smell, the hushed murmurs of passing nurses, and his last words, perfectly clear despite his weakness: "Take care of your mother for me, buddy." After they took him away, I found Mom on her knees in the hallway after the doctors spoke to her. I remember thinking how strange it was to see an adult break that way.

Life blurred after his death. Mom crumbled, and I learned to raise myself - cooking, homework, childhood crises.

Some nights, I'd find her in Dad's armchair, still in work clothes, staring at his photo. She'd kiss me back to bed, her tears marking my forehead despite her mumbled excuses about dust.

Growing up without him was difficult, but we managed. The years passed, and we settled into our routine. I kept his memory alive in small ways—wearing his broken watch, using his old things. Mom said grief does that, though she never explained why. Maybe we're both still figuring it out.

As I got older, the memories of him began to fade. His eyes... I couldn't remember if they were brown or hazel. Mom kept his photos, but somehow, they never seemed to capture him in the right light. I held onto them as a reminder.

Then came that day in my sophomore year when everything changed. Walking home that crisp autumn day, a familiar scent stopped me—applewood smoke, though no one on our street had a working fireplace anymore. At the corner, our house looked wrong. Time seemed to have reversed itself: Dad's bluebells swayed in the dead garden—spring flowers in autumn—and his wind chimes sang without wind.

The scent hit me as I opened the front door—fresh coffee and pancakes. We hadn't had coffee made here in years. From the living room came a sound I'd almost forgotten—Mom's genuine laughter, accompanied by a deeper voice that made my heart stutter.

The hallway stretched endlessly. Dad's cardigan hung on the banister—warm to touch. His crossword puzzle lay unfinished, the pen still warm, his shoes exactly where he always left them. Each detail clicked into place with terrifying precision.

In the living room, Mom curled against him on the couch. There sat my father, impossibly real—reading glasses perched on his nose, that untamable eyebrow, even the coffee stain Mom always scolded him about.

"Welcome home, buddy," he said.

Mom beamed beside him, her hand in his, looking younger than she had in years. The weight of grief seemed to have melted away. She looked at him the way she used to, the way I'd almost forgotten—like he was her entire world.

"Dad?" I whispered, my voice shaking not from terror but from the weight of what I was seeing.

He smiled at me with that slightly crooked incisor he'd chipped playing baseball when he was twelve. "I missed you so much," he said, his voice catching slightly, exactly the way it used to when he was trying not to cry.

Mom announced dinner was ready, casual as anything. The smell of his favorite meatloaf drifted from the kitchen—the recipe his mother had passed down, the one Mom had never quite mastered in all the years since. But now it smelled perfect.

I couldn't move. Because I remembered holding my father's cold hand at the funeral. I remembered watching them lower his casket into the ground. I remembered nine years of grieving, of missing him, of learning to live without him. And here he was, impossible but real.

I backed into the door. "How are you here?" My voice cracked. Dad's face shifted to that familiar concerned expression as he stepped forward, hands open—exactly how he'd approach my childhood tantrums.

"What's wrong, buddy?" His voice held that perfect mix of worry and love I'd fought to remember. Mom appeared, wiping her hands on her anniversary apron—the one that should have been yellowed with age but looked brand new.

I kept my distance, the door my anchor to reality. Everything felt real. That was the problem. I looked at my mother—really looked at her. She looked happy. Genuinely, completely happy, in a way I hadn't seen since before the hospital.

I wanted to run, to escape, yet I couldn't leave her here with... with whatever this was. Even if it felt like Dad. Even if it smiled like him and moved like him and remembered everything exactly right. I lunged forward and grabbed her hand.

"Mom, we have to go," I said, pulling her toward the door. She resisted, her eyes filling with tears.

"Honey, what's gotten into you?" Her voice broke just like it used to when I disappointed her. "Why are you trying to ruin this? We're finally whole again."

I dragged her outside, past the garden where those impossible bluebells bloomed. The street was empty except for the glow from neighbors' windows. Mom fought against me, repeating "it's okay" over and over. When I looked back, my father—or whatever wore his face—stood in our doorway, watching us with that familiar hurt expression.

"Mom, please," I begged. "He died. You remember the funeral. You remember everything after."

But my words faltered as she looked at me with genuine confusion. "What are you talking about? Your father's right there. He's always been here." She touched my forehead like checking for a fever. "Are you feeling okay? You've been working so hard at school lately..."

"No... he's dead. Mom, he's dead..." The words felt less certain now, seeing him there in the doorway, looking exactly as a father should when worried about his child. Everything I remembered about the funeral seemed to blur, like a dream fading in the morning light.

His footsteps on the path carried that familiar unevenness from his old injury. "Come on, buddy. Let's go home. Whatever's bothering you, we can figure it out together. We always do."

I felt something in my mind shift as his footsteps drew closer. Slowly, each memory of my father began adjusting to accept this new reality. "Son," he said, and his voice carried all the warmth I'd been missing for nine years.

"He's dead," I whispered, but even as I said it, I noticed Mom's expression—patient, waiting, like she knew exactly what I was going through, like she'd made this choice before. But I couldn't accept this. I wouldn't disrespect my father's memory, the hardship we'd faced. The pain we'd endured.

"Please Mom, wake up. This isn't real," I said as I tried to pull her, but this time I couldn't move. No, the truth was I wouldn't move—my body betraying me.

"Your father's been worried about you," she said softly. Her eyes met mine, and for a moment—just a moment—I saw everything there. Understanding. Grief. Choice. "Sometimes," she added carefully, "happiness is right in front of us, if we just... let it be."

He was closer now, and I could smell his aftershave—the same brand I'd kept unopened in my drawer for years. Yet the memory felt uncertain now, like trying to hold onto water. I tried to remember the funeral, but the images kept shifting, then fading.

"Do you remember how he used to push you on the swings?" Mom asked, her voice gentle. "How he never pushed too high because you were scared of heights?"

"Every Sunday," Dad added, and suddenly I could see it clearly—the creak of the swing set, his hands steady on my back, my laughter carrying across the yard. Had that happened before or after? Did it matter anymore?

I looked at him—really looked. He wasn't perfect. There were new wrinkles around his eyes that my memories hadn't included. His hair was slightly grayer than in the photos. He looked... lived in. Real. Like he'd been aging alongside us all this time.

"Dad?" I said again, but this time it wasn't a question born of fear.

Something in my mind whispered that this was wrong, that there was another set of memories trying to claim space—cold hands, a casket, years of absence. But those memories felt distant now, like a dream I'd once had. This felt real—his smile, Mom's hand in mine, the smell of dinner waiting at home.

"Come on, buddy," he said, holding out his hand. "Your mom's lasagna is getting cold."

I looked at Mom one last time. There was something in her eyes—knowledge, maybe, or understanding. A tiny nod, so slight I might have imagined it. A choice being offered.

I took his hand. It was warm.

That night, my reflection caught my eye—something questioning in my gaze. Then Dad called about tomorrow's fishing trip—the one we'd planned for weeks, the one we'd always done, every year, forever—and I let the doubt slip away.

After all, why question happiness?

Dad's home. He's always been home.

And if sometimes, late at night, I remember another life—well, that's just a bad dream. Mom says they fade.

Don't they?
