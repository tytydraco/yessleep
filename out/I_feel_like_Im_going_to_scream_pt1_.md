I'm 21f and Im sitting here with my son (6months old) he's laying on my chest taking a Nap I was listening to creep cast podcast as has been the routine for over a week now I don't get much done around the house due to my chronic anxiety and depression caused my CPTSD and BPD (yes I'm medicated and yes I'm in therapy) I'm trying my absolute best I even went on a grippy sock vacation and it helped a lot but I'm still in a rut nothing seems good I'm so bored but yet paralyzed to do anything while I am home alone my husband works 6 days a week 10 hr shifts at a warehouse job it's peak season so everyone is over worked right now so I'm home alone a lot and it feels awful that I'm not getting much done...the ambient sounds of the space heater in my son's room and the mini fridge in mine and the near constant cars going by our house is driving me insane I can't tune out any of it and I have this constant feeling of dread and paranoia like im not allowed to leave my room or house that if i were to try there would be nothing there and no one to talk to or see that nothing outside of myself is real and im becoming more and more nervous. everyday it gets a bit worse and i feel like im going insane...I'm posting here because I feel like I have no where else to turn to hopefully someone here can give me advice or validation....fuck I hope im not crazy my son needs me....

 God I can't stand it the sound of the 18 wheelers going over the bridge by my house and the low hum of the heater and the fridge they're my enemies I need better noise to drown it out but nothing catches my attention and music is to overwhelming 
My son is sleeping now thank fuck I'm losing my mind no one is answering the phone the only time I feel Sane are the few hours my husband is home before we go to bed and even that reassurance is fleeting last night when he came home I couldn't focus on his face at all like the more I looked at him the less details I could pin point i cant tell him that though hell worry to much. we can't afford for me to go back to the hospital i have to muster through....please some body help me

I can see it I can see the strings attached to there souls something is puppeteering them for my demise I can't step outside it's a lie nothing is real I think my husband is afraid of me but I think it's a trick I don't trust him anymore...

I knew it..I knew it...I knew it
Whatever is controlling the people around me they made him leavey husband is "staying with his friend till I can sort out what I need to recover" even sounds like him but I know I know he would never leave me if he was truly worried they are making him do it hoping I would follow go outside or finally break here on my own I don't know why they want me but they do I have to bunker down for the long haul... thanksgiving is coming up we were supposed to host so I'm well stocked on food....at least my son is safe...I atleast hope he is....

I still have plenty of food as I don't need as much anymore and I no longer need to sleep I don't know why but I'll take it. I can outlast this sick game....but it is getting hard no one answers there phone anymore I haven't had an update about my son in days I'm not even sure if he was ever real if any of them were...maybe I was always alone....that deep feeling if dread seeps inthi my bones and deep down i know someting is here I jus can't grasp it 
I feel cold and helpless but also feel the empowerment of rage course thru me
Whatever it wants whatever they are planning I have to persevere for something a family maybe or even just myself I don't know anymore but I have to keep fighting 
I have to...I have to ....
