I was born with a rattlesnake in my bloodstream.

It didn’t bite for years. It just… coiled there. Warm and sleepy. A whisper of venom in a cradle of marrow.

My mother said it was a family heirloom. Her father gave it to her. And one day, she said, if I was lucky—real lucky—I’d get to pass it down too.

She told me this while drinking cranberry juice with her pills, shaking like a loose screw in a broken blender. I was fifteen. She was forty-one. Her laugh sounded like someone trying to start a car that doesn’t want to live.

I used to think she was just eccentric. Dancing in the grocery store aisles. Crying over dogs she hadn’t met. Starting conversations halfway through. I thought it was charm.

But then she started punching holes in the drywall trying to hug shadows that weren’t there. She put the toaster in the fridge. She pissed herself and said it was the microwave’s fault.

Turns out charm is a symptom too.

By the time I got tested, the rattlesnake had already started whispering again. Real sweet. Like lullabies from your own funeral.

CAG Repeat Count: 44
That’s how many times the gun was cocked in my skull.

The doctor smiled like he was handing me a participation trophy. “You won the genetic lottery,” he joked, then got real quiet when I didn’t laugh. I think he thought I’d cry. But I didn’t. I just stared at him and wondered if his skin would peel easy.

That night, I went to a hill. The one overlooking the city. The one my mom used to take me to when she was still her. I sat there until the stars blinked like dying cursor lights and asked myself one question:

If I disappear before the snake strikes, did I ever really have it?

Because I feel fine. I do. Most days. My fingers still type. My tongue still folds into rhyme. My legs still carry me from one illusion of meaning to the next. I feel… okay.

But I’ve started forgetting nouns. I called my car “the fast chair” yesterday. I put my cereal in the cabinet and the box in the fridge. I got lost in my own apartment.

Every day I wake up and take a little inventory:
	•	Do I remember my name?
	•	Can I spell “catastrophe” backward?
	•	Are the shadows still outside my head?

Check. Check. Kinda.

The funny part? Everyone starts treating you like you’re dying as soon as you find out. Not when it hits. Not when you’re falling down the stairs or clawing at your own throat because your muscles won’t listen. No, the moment you say “Huntington’s,” it’s like they already hear the ventilator.

But I’m not dead. I’m just pre-haunted.

Sometimes I think the real disease is what it does to now.

You stop dreaming about the future. You start collecting “lasts” like cursed souvenirs.
	•	Last time you run.
	•	Last time you write a song.
	•	Last time your father looks at you like a son and not a countdown.

I keep a journal. It’s mostly empty. Some days I write things like:
	•	“Remember to eat before forgetting how.”
	•	“Practice tying shoes.”
	•	“Don’t let fear build a home in your spine.”

One page just says: “When do I become her?”

My mom is in a facility now. She attacked her roommate with a pillow. The woman was nonverbal and made a noise with her water bottle. That’s all it took. Just a noise.

They told me not to worry. They said she didn’t mean it.
But here’s the thing:

What if she did?
What if the disease doesn’t make you someone else…
What if it just peels the nice parts off until the truth is all that’s left?

What if I’m not scared of becoming her—
I’m scared that she’s what I’ve always been, underneath.

They call it a neurodegenerative disorder.
I call it a slow-motion exorcism.

A few nights ago, I had a dream. I was in a room made of mirrors, each one showing me at a different age. Child-me. Teen-me. Present-me. Future-me. And in the middle? A version of me with no eyes and too many teeth, dancing like my mother used to.

He whispered, “I’m the only you that matters.”

Then he bit off my fingers, one by one.

I woke up laughing.

Not because it was funny, but because laughter is the only thing I still do on purpose.

I’ve decided not to die in a hospital.
I want to go out in a blaze of metaphor.

Maybe I’ll walk into the ocean with a head full of music and a page full of notes.
Maybe I’ll drive my car off the edge of the world while screaming poetry into the wind.
Maybe I’ll just lie down next to a lemon tree and let it delete me as I read until I can’t.

Because that’s what this is, isn’t it?

Not an ending. Not a tragedy.
Just a slow deletion.

One blink at a time.

Until there’s nothing left to inherit.
