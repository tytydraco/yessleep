The Guardians of Humanity  
By Jojoyojimbi  
  
It has been 11,284 generations since my peoples came to be the protectors of the humans.  We came to them in a time of opportunity.  They were little more than smart hairless monkeys that had decided to give up the trees and stand up straight upon the plains.  They clothed themselves in the skins of animals.  They had barely began to domesticate the grasses that allowed them to live in one area permanently, no longer roaming and wandering to hunt and gather food.  
  
A few of our ancestors got a bit carried away and allowed our natural tendencies towards narcissism to take over.  A few fancied themselves gods and managed to get the humans worshiping us as such.  This carried on for generations until we eventually gave in to our natural laziness and realized there was a lot less bureaucracy involved if we let them run things.  Though we do allow them to treat us like gods if they choose, we just don't demand it, as often.  
  
I must apologize reader, I got off on a tangent.  Our shared histories are stories for another day.  A little about myself for the sake of familiarity.  I am a Hunter.  I am a Defender.  I am royalty, and I admit I am spoiled.  I am a Princess in both name and birthright.  I have gifted a rather ordinary couple, Becky and Roger with my presence.  Their lives are in my care and if I fail my duty terrible things might befall them.  Let me tell you about today, which was by my accounts, the 6th time that I saved my human family from demonic incursion and certain death.  
  
My humans, the unfortunately giant blind, deaf, lumbering fools who couldn't smell the coming of an apocalypse even if it was wafted under their sorry dead noses like smelling salts.  The poor souls can't even see the portals as they're manifesting or the demons as they breach the veil.  In a way I feel sorry for them.  They every so rarely even glimpse one of the demons they rarely believe they exist.  I pity them in their ignorance and it is because I have come to care for my human family profusely, that I stand vigil every night to defend them from the incursions.  
  
The day started like any other day, my humans prepared me some nourishment and hydration while I stretched and performed my morning calisthenics and I spent some time observing the comings and goings of the other residents in the neighborhood, nodding to my fellows protectors.  
  
Becky prepared their breakfast after placing out my morning's nourishment and sat down to peruse the morning news on her phone while Roger absently sipped his coffee and checked the local sports team results from the previous evening.  
  
“Thank you Becky but the helping might be a little small, I expect it's been too quiet the last couple evenings and there may be an incursion this evening.”  
  
“What's that Princess?” Becky looked up from her phone, “You still hungry?”  
  
“Well yes, would you please pay attention and put the phone down?”  
  
“I'll get you some more, hold your horses”  
  
“You're pretty talkative this morning Princess?” Roger added unnecessarily.  
  
I glared daggers at him as he continued to sip his coffee and I cleaned up a bit.  Something in his tone annoyed me so I made a mental note to leave him something to shock him.  He's so squeamish.  It amuses me to leave him the occasional demon corpse, just so he remembers who the Princess is.  
  
“Here you are Princess.” Becky said as she placed my additional breakfast in front of me.  It was satisfactory.
  
I nodded approvingly and ate quickly, and felt it was time for a nap.  I would have to build up sufficient energy reserve if there was indeed an incursion this evening as I suspected.
  
A few hours later I woke sleepily, stretched the nap away and did a quick patrol of the home, something smelled off, there's a hint of demon in the air and I started looking for a breach point and I found it.  Well, where it would be in a few hours in any case.  It was low down in the corner of the living room.  I could hear them, their gnawing, gnashing, clawing and their demonic chittering.  It would be hours yet before they finally broke through and breached.  
  
A tense wait later.  Becky and Roger had been home for a few hours and were preparing to settle in for the evening, still oblivious to the breach slowly growing in their living room.  I sat fixated, staring at the breach forming, slowly gnawing, growing.  
  
“What're you staring at Princess?” Becky inquired.  
  
“There's about to be another Demon breach Becky” I replied.  
  
“Oh yeah?  Well we're going to go to bed”  
  
“Yes Becky, I am aware of that.  I shall continue to defend you while you sleep because your insignificant human senses are incapable of even perceiving your oncoming doom.  I shall need my ritual herbs before you retire for the evening.”  
  
“You want your drugs?  Do you want your drugs you little druggie?  Huh, do ya?”  
  
“Yes Becky you condescending hairless monkey, give me my ritual herbs, I shall need the edge!”  
  
Becky retrieved the herbs from the cabinet while I maintained vigil on the breach.  She gave me the sachet of herbs and as I inhaled their intoxicating aroma my eyes dilated and time began to slow slightly.  I limited my inhalation, I couldn't sink too deeply into the intoxicating aroma until the demon or demons were dealt with.  I leaned back and began to prepare mentally.  It wouldn't be long now.  
  
Slightly more than two hours passed and Beck and Roger were fast asleep, Midnight had come and gone and the demons were nearly through.  The herb's affects would need refreshed so I inhaled deep to renew their time slowing affects and to keep me sharp.  I was getting tired of waiting.  
  
I did not have to wait much longer.  Less than a couple dozen heartbeats passed by my count before the first Demon's face protruded through the breach and I could hear it snuffling the air as it scanned the area immediately outside the breach and got a sense of the outside world.  
  
It clawed its way through the breach and chittered in its foul demonic tongue to any compatriots that had traveled with it to remain in the breach until it had finished scouting.  
  
I could not wait for their forces to muster.  I pounced!  I dropped upon the small scouting demon from my raised perch and hit it crossbody with every ounce of force I could muster, hoping to end it's miserable life as quickly as possible.  Unfortunately it quickly righted itself and started to run towards my sleeping charges and I could not allow harm to come to them.  
  
I charged, kicking off of the small table that held some ornamental arrangement or another and gaining a speed advantage on the smaller demon with my enhanced reflexes.  The ornamental arrangement seemed to move slowly through the air on its way towards the floor in front of the breach, the effects of my herbs was profound.  It is little wonder they have been used by my people for as many generations as they have.  As the vase continued to fall I managed to catch up with the demon and hit it again, sending it flying this time into the wall, hard.  Staggered it stood up, baring huge teeth and sharp claws but I was ready for its lunge and managed to secure it in a choke that would end the life of this demon and save my humans.  
  
As the last breath escaped the demon the time finally caught up with us and the vase of ornamental arrangements crashed to the ground and I ran into the bedroom to reassure my human charges that all was well and they had nothing to fear.  
  
Roger woke with a start and glanced anxiously around the room.  He saw me watching over them and sleepily answered Becky when she asked, “What was that?!”  
  
“The cat has the zoomies again, just go back to sleep, we'll clean it up in the morning”  
  
Another night successfully protecting my charges I decided to end the evening with a patrol.  Sprinting the length of the house a number of times before taking another nap before breakfast.  
   
Morning was glorious, my night was triumphant, my humans were safe.  Roger prepared breakfast for everyone and Becky waited at the table.  Roger presented her breakfast and I sat upon the window sill basking in their appreciation and eyeing the neighborhood.  
  
“The cat left a dead mouse in my shoes this time.” Roger glared at me.  
  
I am Princess Fifi von Fluffington the third and my humans are safe for another day.  Becky smiled up at me and I closed my eyes in contentment and purred.
