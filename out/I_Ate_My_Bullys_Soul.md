It all happened back in the '90s. I had just stepped into my teenage years, living in a tiny town in southern Nebraska with my parents and my baby sister, who was only six months old. That spring, I turned thirteen, and I was absolutely obsessed with everything fantasy. God, I was crazy about the DragonLance books—every single one of them. Unfortunately, everyone at school knew this too well. As if it wasn't bad enough that I had strabismus and my left eye turned inward because of it.

I don’t even need to say it, I was pretty much a walking target at school. A scrawny, cross-eyed, glasses-wearing kid who loved fantasy novels? It wasn’t just cliché, it was prime bully material.
Yeah, school had its demons, and they had it out for me. Sometimes I got off easy: tripping me in the hallway, tossing stuff at me, blowing spitballs. But other times, it got much worse, they’d steal my clothes, shove me into puddles, or just beat the crap out of me.

The biggest jerk of them all? That was Mitch, my classmate. He humiliated me in every way you can imagine. My glasses were broken more often than they were whole, thanks to him. One time he shoved me so hard I landed on my arm and broke it, I wore a cast for half a year. The worst part? No one ever helped. Most people just ignored it, looked away, or even laughed along with my bullies.

And my parents… well, they were always busy. Dad was a traveling salesman, peddling shares for a tourism company anywhere he could. Mom hadn’t been well since my baby sister was born. She spent most of her time in bed and only got up a few times a day.
Friends? I couldn’t even dream of having real ones. The only people I could call friends were strangers from AOL chat rooms.
That was my life, growing up in that grimy little town—until that Thursday afternoon.


I had already been through a rough day and it was nowhere near over. After school, Mitch and a few other kids chased me down. They were on bikes; I had to run as fast as my legs would carry me. Of course, they caught up to me. I don’t even remember where exactly, it was some empty lot with just one building on it: a crumbling old shed.

Mitch and the others yanked my pants down and started beating my bare backside and legs with sticks. It hurt like hell - not just physically, but the shame of it, too. When they were done, they tied my ankles together with a shoelace and locked me inside the shed. They jammed the door shut with sticks so I couldn’t open it from the inside.

I sat there for hours. Mitch and the rest had long since taken off, saying I should “find a way out” or maybe they’d let me out tomorrow. It was late afternoon, and I was still sitting there, in nothing but my underwear, with my backside throbbing in pain. I covered my eyes and tried to imagine a better place. Somewhere no one could hurt me. Somewhere I could just go to school without being afraid.

I hated all of them. But most of all, I hated Mitch. He was always the ringleader ,the one who made sure I was the one everyone picked on.

I was sitting alone in that little wooden shed when I heard something.
A sound. Strange, like someone giggling.
My first thought was, Great, another one of Mitch’s goons. But this was different. It sounded… distant, somehow.

I peeked through the cracks in the wooden boards, hoping to spot whoever it was—but there was no one out there. Still, I could’ve sworn someone was walking around the shed.
So I called out:


“Please help! I’m stuck in here. Please, can you open the door?”


No answer. Just that same giggling again but this time, it wasn’t coming from outside. It was coming from inside. From behind me.

My whole body froze in fear. What the hell was this? What was in here with me?
Slowly, I turned to look. And that’s when I saw it.

A tall black figure. Blacker than tar, and swirling like smoke, with glowing red embers flickering inside the haze. It had no face or if it did, I couldn’t see it. But it had hands and feet. It just stood there, staring at me with its faceless body.

I couldn’t say a word. I thought I might die right then and there from sheer terror.
But then, the smoke-like man spoke:


“Help. I. Can. Maybe. Help.”


I stood there, staring at it, seeing clearly that it had no mouth, no way to speak. And yet I heard its voice, like a whisper right inside my ear.

Still, I said nothing. My bare little legs trembled with fear. The thing just stared at me, without eyes. Or maybe it wasn’t even looking at me. I couldn’t tell.
Then it whispered again:


“Saw. Everything. I. Saw. Help. If. Want.”


I didn’t know what to say. How could something like this possibly help me? What even was it? And what had it seen?

I was just a dumb kid, but then it hit me. It must’ve seen what Mitch and the others had done to me. Maybe it wanted to help… with that.

I don’t know why I did it, or maybe I was just that desperate—but I nodded.
Yes. I wanted its help.

The smoke-creature leaned in closer. I shrank back in fear, but my back hit the shed wall. There was nowhere left to go.
It whispered again:


“Help. Not. Free. Need. From. You.”


I stared at the thing, terrified,  sometimes it looked like a man, sometimes like shapeless smoke.
I didn’t understand what it needed from me. But I said the words it was waiting for:


“I’ll help you… if you help me get rid of Mitch.”


It didn’t say anything. Just kept swirling, watching.
Then, after a moment, it whispered again, right next to my ear:


 “Help. Soul. Three. Just. Say. Offer. You. I. Give.”


I didn’t really understand what it meant. I was just a scared, panicking little kid—not exactly thinking clearly.
So I just nodded again. As if I understood.

Then the creature’s black, smoky hand grabbed mine. It felt like searing hot iron touching my skin — it burned a mark into my wrist. I screamed in pain, the stench of scorched flesh instantly hitting my nose.


 “Just. Say. You. I. Offer. Fumalis.”


I collapsed to the ground as it let go of my arm. It hurt more than anything Mitch and the others had ever done to me. This wasn’t just pain, it had branded me. A dark bruise appeared instantly around my wrist, like something unimaginably strong had crushed it.
I stared at my throbbing hand. In my palm, a strange triangle-shaped symbol was now burned into the flesh.

That’s when the shed door suddenly burst open.
A man stood there,  an older guy. I didn’t know his name, but my dad had talked to him many times in town.


“Jesus, kid! What the hell are you doing here? What happened to you?” he said, panicked.
I turned back toward the smoke-creature,but it was already gone. Not even a trace of it remained.


The old man walked me home.
My parents were completely shocked — or, well, mostly my dad was. Mom hadn’t gotten out of bed all day. She wasn’t feeling well.
Dad said he’d talk to Mitch’s parents,but not now. He was flying to Minneapolis for a business trip the next day, so he’d deal with it next week.
I cleaned myself up a little and tried to go into my parents’ bedroom to talk to Mom.
But she just sat there on the edge of the bed, staring blankly into nothing.
The moment I walked in, Izzy — my baby sister — started wailing in her crib. She still slept in their room.

Dad came in and sent me out.
He said, “Let’s not have more chaos tonight. Just go to your room.”

Honestly… that was for the best. I stayed up reading late into the night.

But tomorrow was Friday. And school. God, I hated school.


Friday went by surprisingly okay.
No one messed with me in the morning — maybe they figured what happened yesterday was enough. Or maybe they were planning something worse. Dad didn’t talk to Mitch’s parents. He didn’t have time. I didn’t expect anything else.

During lunch break, I sat outside in the yard. I always preferred eating where no one could see me — a quiet place where I could also read.
I was reading The Second Generation, the one Dad bought me a few weeks ago during one of his business trips.

When I looked up, I saw Mitch walking toward me from the cafeteria.
My stomach clenched. Even the sight of that dumb, long blond hair of his made me sick.
He walked right up to me, smacked the book out of my hands, and sneered:


"Whatcha readin’, little rat? Didn’t I tell you to stay in the shed till morning?"


I didn’t say a word. I’d learned it was better to just stay quiet and let it pass.
 "What happened to your hand, booger boy? Did you pick too many boogers?"


Mitch kept going. He was alone, but you’d think he was still trying to impress an audience, like the other kids were standing there laughing.
I just kept staring at the ground, silent. He kept taunting me:

"You’re pathetic, four-eyes. Your whole family is. My mom says your mom’s defective and she’s right."


Then he shoved me hard, knocking me off the bench and onto the ground.
I just lay there, waiting for the usual beating to come. But then I heard the giggle. The sound was familiar. From yesterday. The smoke.
And then, I heard the whisper again:


“Just. Say. I. Offer. Him. To. You. Fumalis.”


This time, it wasn’t just me who was surprised — Mitch was too. Because I stood up from the ground.


 "What the fuck are you doing, loser?" Mitch yelled.


But I didn’t even seem to hear him. I just stared at him — part angry, part… confused?
He lunged to punch me — that was his rule, after all: if he was around, I was supposed to be on the ground. But I beat him to it. And three words came out of my mouth:


“I offer him to you, Fumalis.”


It was like I knew exactly what I was doing… or what would happen next.
Mitch didn’t hit me. He just stared at me blankly, not really understanding what the hell I was doing.
And then blood began trickling from his nose. His face went pale.
He looked terrified — something was clearly wrong.

Then he just collapsed backward like a sack of bricks, and started convulsing violently, like a seizure. Blood and foamy spit flew from his mouth, and it began pouring from his nose, ears, and even his eyes. His arms bent back at impossible angles, like something had twisted them.

I froze in fear, just standing there in shock, completely silent. I was only a kid — I didn’t know what to do.
But then… something started happening to me, too.
It felt like a crushing weight was pressing against my chest. Like an asthma attack, I could barely breathe, staring up at the sky, completely frozen.

It only lasted seconds, but when it was over, I felt awful. I was dizzy, and it felt like something was eating me up from the inside.
Mitch was lying there.
He was still breathing, but his face was soaked in blood and his eyes had gone grey — like he’d gone blind. His body looked lifeless.

All I knew was that I had to get out of there. So I ran. Back toward the school. Terrified.


They took Mitch away in an ambulance that same day. I didn’t say a word to anyone.
I wasn’t sure if I had done that to him, or if something had just gone wrong with him.
But honestly… it was better not to think about it.
At least he was gone.

My weekend went better than usual. I got to go out biking, even got some ice cream.
Mom didn’t do much — either stayed in bed or took care of Izzy, but she didn’t say a word to me.
Guilt gnawed at me every time I thought about Mitch, and part of me was scared Mom somehow knew something, and that’s why she wasn’t speaking to me.
But I pushed the thought away. There were times she wouldn’t speak to Dad for weeks.
So maybe it was just one of those times.

Mitch’s incident shook the whole town.
The doctors said he’d had some kind of brain hemorrhage and was in a coma. They didn’t think he’d ever be a “normal” kid again. I heard it at the ice cream shop — two middle-aged women were gossiping about it like it was a soap opera.

I didn’t know how to feel.
Part of me was glad Mitch was gone — now the other kids weren’t bullying me either. But at the same time, the image of Mitch lying there on the ground haunted me. I’d dreamed about it two nights in a row now.

I felt like a horrible person…But also kind of happy.


It was already Sunday night.
I think it might’ve been the most peaceful weekend of my life. There had never been a weekend when Mitch didn’t come after me or torment me in some way. Dad came home from his trip, but he was tired, so we didn’t talk much. He just went straight to bed.
I stayed up a bit longer to read.
DragonLance again — honestly, I don’t think I could’ve survived those years without those books.
The house was quiet. Peaceful. That’s when I felt it, that strange sensation.
Someone giggled.
The hairs stood up on the back of my neck. The little bedside lamp I was reading under dimmed, flickering, until the whole room was almost dark.
I wanted to bolt — to just run — but then a black figure materialized in the corner of my room.
It was the smoke-creature again.
Terrified, I yanked the blanket over my head. I knew what it was, but its presence still chilled me to the bone.
Then I heard that familiar whisper:


“Two. More. Mark. Needs. Two. More.”


I didn’t really understand at first — it was always hard to make out what it meant. Its voice was quiet and metallic, like an echo that scraped along your skull.
Then I noticed my hand.
The brand it had burned into me was still there — but one of the triangle’s corners was gone.
It now looked like a simple L-shape. The missing part of the burn had vanished completely, as if it was never there.
The whisper came again:


“I helped. Me. Too. Help. Needs. Two.”


My young mind struggled to process it, but finally I understood — and froze.
It wanted me to do it again. Twice more.What I’d done to Mitch.
I shook my head. No.
There was no way I was doing anything like that again. I would never forget Mitch’s gray, lifeless eyes.

The creature suddenly seemed angry. You couldn’t really see it on its empty, black face, but its shape trembled, and the red ember-like sparks inside it began to glow brighter.
And then the whispering… turned horrific.
It was as if a thousand people were screaming inside my head. I covered my ears to shut it out — but it wasn’t a sound I could block. It wasn’t outside my head…it was inside.

I waved my hands desperately, pleading for it to stop, before I went mad.
Then the whispering returned to its usual tone:


“Two. More. By. Thursday. Two. More.”


My face turned pale. Thursday? There had been no deadline before! I swallowed hard, then — gathering all my courage — whispered back as quietly as I could, making sure no one in the house could hear me:


“What do you mean, by Thursday? You never said anything about that!”


The creature didn’t answer. It just stood there in the corner, between my wardrobe and the wall. But the whisper came again, the same as before:


“Thursday. Two. Souls. Or. Yours.”


I went sheet white. This was getting worse. Now even my soul was in danger?
Suddenly, my bedroom door burst open. Dad walked in. He said he thought he’d heard someone walking around and wanted to check on everyone. But the black smoke-thing was already gone from the corner.


Monday started terribly.
There was such pressure on me, I swear I was on the verge of passing out. I had to do that thing to two more people by Thursday… and Mitch had already shattered me — and I hated Mitch. What would happen if I did it to someone who didn’t even deserve it?
During class, I couldn’t focus on anything. All I could think about was the debt I owed the smoke-thing. What the hell was I supposed to do?

It was lunch break again, and for once, I actually got to eat in peace. No one was messing with me. At least… that’s what I thought.

I sat in my usual spot — one of the benches out in the yard — eating my tuna sandwich, when someone approached me.
It was the school janitor.
An old guy who looked like he hated the world, never spoke to anyone unless he was yelling at some dumb kid for being out of line.
He just stood there, squinting at me with sharp eyes. I had no idea what he wanted, so I just politely greeted him.

Then he finally spoke. And the moment he did, all the blood drained from my body:


“I saw what you did.”


I just sat there, pale as a ghost, staring up at the old man. What did he mean? What did he see? Was I going to prison? Or something worse?

I tried to lie. Tried to fake it — maybe he’d believe me and go away.


“I… I don’t know what you mean,” I said quietly.


He just kept staring at me, eyes like knives. Then he repeated it:


“I know what you did, you little shit. I saw it from the window, when you were out here with that other boy.”


I didn’t know what to do. What the hell could I do?
This old man was going to expose me — and my life would be over. As if being forced to collect souls for some smoke-demon wasn’t enough, now I had this guy on my back too.

Just then the bell rang — recess was over, and my teacher was already calling us back inside. I tried to slip away without saying a word, pretending I hadn’t heard him. But the janitor grabbed my wrist and looked me dead in the eyes, furious.


“What did you do to him? What are you, some kind of alien?”


I yanked my hand out of his grip and ran back inside the school. He just stood there watching me run — but I could tell from his face, this wasn’t over.

I rushed to my desk and sat down, rubbing the spot on my wrist where he’d grabbed me. Of course — it was that wrist. The one with the mark.
And that’s when it hit me. A terrible, awful thought. But maybe… maybe it was a way out.


I never thought I’d be capable of something like this —but I was planning to steal someone’s soul.
I’d made up my mind: the janitor had to go.
If he really saw something, and he could prove it, I’d be screwed. Maybe even my whole family would be in danger.

So I came up with a plan. It was Monday evening, and I decided to go check on the old man, see what he was doing. I was convinced he was a bad person. At least, that’s what my child-mind made of it: he was grumpy, always alone, and mean.
That had to count for something… right?
The whole situation was bizarre, and I didn’t know what to make of it. And help? Who the hell was I going to ask for help in a situation like this?

So I was already on my way to the old man’s house.I knew where he lived — some of the older kids had mentioned egging it a few times, or pulling pranks there.

I left my bike leaning against a tree in his yard, then crept closer, watching him from a window, hoping to confirm how awful he was. Surely he was doing something evil…
But no. He was just eating dinner. Watching TV.
This wouldn’t do. If I wanted proof — if I wanted to justify what I was about to do — I had to go inside.

Had to be sure.
It felt horrible, but I didn’t want to die. Or lose my soul. So I needed to know: Did he really deserve this?
Getting into the house was easy — the back door was wide open, probably for airing the place out.
As soon as I stepped inside, I was hit by that unmistakable smell of old people —not gross, exactly, just that typical old-man scent.
The TV was blaring, some kind of documentary playing...of course, about UFOs.

But the old man wasn’t sitting in front of the TV. And that’s when I panicked. I quickly crept around the tiny house —but he was nowhere to be seen.
Where the hell did he go?

That’s when I heard the toilet flush. One of the doors creaked open.And there I was, crouched on the floor, right in his line of sight. The old man stared at me, his face frozen in shock for a second, but then it twisted into pure rage. He started screaming:


“What the fuck are you doing here, you little freak?! I knew you were some kinda alien!”


I tried backing away from him, but the old man stormed toward me, eyes blazing. I didn’t get far. He punched me so hard I flew backwards, my glasses went skidding across the floor, and everything went black.


When I came to, I was tied up. I’d been strapped to a chair, right in the middle of the old man’s living room. He was standing in front of me, smoking a cigarette, holding a shotgun in his other hand.

The moment he saw I was awake, he pointed the gun at me and growled:


“Stay right where you are, alien! I got you! Now you’re gonna tell me all your secrets, how you freaks are planning to take over humanity!”


I just stared at the barrel of the shotgun, terrified.
I wanted to cry, but I couldn’t — maybe from the fear, maybe from the hell I'd been through these past few days.
The old man glared at me,  his hands shaking on the weapon.


“You deaf, UFO? I said, tell me everything — or you're dead!”


I don’t know why I said it…but it just slipped out of me:


“I offer you… to Fumalis.”


The old man squinted at me. Took a step closer. Like he was trying to figure out what I meant, waiting for me to make a move.
But I already knew what was coming. I shut my eyes…and waited.

Blood started trickling from the old man’s nose. He reached up to touch it, confused —
and then suddenly he started coughing. Hard.
He stumbled closer to me, and I opened my eyes — I shouldn’t have.
He was coughing blood everywhere. All over the room. All over me.
And I screamed as loud as I possibly could.


The old man was sprawled out on the floor. His house was soaked in blood — it looked like a slaughterhouse.
I sat there trembling, still tied to the chair, spitting the old man’s blood from my mouth.
But no matter how scared I was, I knew I had to get the hell out of there. If anyone saw this…I was done for. Luckily, the chair’s right armrest was loose.
As I started twisting my wrist, it almost immediately slipped free. With one hand out, the rest was easy —maybe all those James Bond movies had finally paid off.

I practically flew home on my bike. Blood was dripping from my clothes, along with my tears. But I had to get home.

As soon as I jumped off the bike in our driveway, I ran straight to the bathroom. Nobody was awake anymore, so I quickly tried to scrub the old man’s blood off me.
But it wouldn’t come off. No matter how hard I scrubbed, it just wouldn’t budge. I think I spent hours just trying to wash it all away.
I was scrubbing my hands when I saw it in the mirror. That shadow. That black shape. Behind me.

I gasped, barely making a sound. At this point, after everything, it felt like nothing could surprise me anymore. The thing was standing in the corner, next to the tub, and then it whispered — softly, but clearly:


“Old. Man. No. Child. Still. Need. Two.”


His words hit me like a truck. What do you mean, the old man wasn’t good enough?
Anger flared up in me. I grabbed my toothbrush cup and hurled it at the thing.
It just passed through him and shattered against the wall.
Then the smoke boiled outward, filling the bathroom like black fog. The whisper became deafening:


“Two. Children. Three. Days.”


And just like that — he vanished again. I muttered under my breath:


“ I’m not doing this anymore…”


I didn’t go to school the next day.
I pretended I did — but I just grabbed my bike and pedaled over to the janitor’s house. I felt like a zombie, like I’d been hit by some mind-wiping spell from one of my books.

When I got there, there were already ambulances and police cars out front. Neighbors were gathered outside, gossiping and staring. I asked one elderly couple what had happened, but they just said: That old guy did something stupid and collapsed or something.
I figured it was best if I got the hell out of there.

I rode to the public library, hoping I might find something — anything — about the smoke-being. But no luck. Not only was there nothing remotely like it in the books,
but I couldn’t even focus long enough to read.

Half the time, I caught myself scratching at my scalp or fiddling with the mark on my wrist.
I think I’m starting to lose it.

By the afternoon, I was out of ideas. I figured I had to tell someone — anyone — who might be able to help. So I messaged my AOL buddies and explained everything that had been happening.
Most of them didn’t take me seriously. They just said, “cool story” and told me I had a wicked imagination.

Mom stayed in her room all day again, staring blankly out the window. Sometimes, when Izzy cried, she got up and tended to her — but that was it. She didn’t speak. Didn’t even look at me.

So there was only one person left. Dad. But of course, he wasn’t home. So I called him at his work number. He didn’t sound thrilled to hear from me.
And when I told him what was going on, he just went quiet, then snapped:


“You’re not getting any more books.”


But one thing he said stuck in my head:


“Your mother... she’s not really here anymore. Please don’t be like that. I need you to help me hold things together.”


I didn’t know what to do. I had never felt so alone in my entire life. I was standing face-to-face with an entity that wanted my soul — and there was no one I could turn to.
No one who could help me.
I walked into my parents’ bedroom. Izzy was asleep in her crib. Mom was — as usual — standing at the window, staring blankly outside.
I walked up to her and hugged her, but she barely moved, like she wasn’t even really there.
I cried. I was terrified, and I hated everything that was happening.

I stayed there just a few minutes. I needed to do something. Anything. I couldn’t end up like Mitch. Or the old man.
But as I turned to leave the room — there it was. The smoke. It blocked the doorway entirely.
I felt something inside me snap. This thing… this thing had ruined my life.


“Get out of here!” I screamed. “I’m not helping you anymore! Go to hell!”


The smoke-thing didn’t move. It just floated there, staring — the red sparks swirling inside it, spinning like angry fireflies. Then came the whisper:


“One. Choose. Be. Free.”


I just stared. What the hell did it mean? But then it continued:


“One. Remains. Sister. Or. Mother. Soul.”


I knew what it meant. I felt it, deep down. It was giving me a choice.


“One. Choose. You. Free.”


I turned back to look into the room. At my mom. At Izzy. The smoke hovered behind me, silent. My eyes were sore and swollen from crying. Mom still stood there, lifeless, staring out the window. Izzy was screaming now — had been for a while.

And only one thought echoed in my head, over and over:
Do I really have to choose?
Or if I don’t… will it be me who’s taken next?
