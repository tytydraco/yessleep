If you're going to spend tens of thousands of dollars on something, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect it to work as it's intended to. That was my line of thinking when the GPS on my new car wasn't working the day after I bought it. So I called up the dealer to schedule a repair. I guess they don't do their scheduling actually at the store; scheduling calls go to some call center. 

"Thank you for calling (dealer name), this is Loki. How can I help you today?"

Weird name, weird accent. They outsource their customer service to some other country. Great. 

I explained what was going on with the car, and that I wanted to schedule a repair. 

"Certainly I can set you up. It looks like the earliest we can get you in will be September 9th at 9:00 AM."

"Are you fucking kidding me? There's no way you're booked up for 9 months!"

"Well, without GPS, it'll probably take you that long to even find the dealership anyway, so I don't see why you're so upset."

"Go fuck yourself, buddy. I'll go somewhere else."

"I'll get right on that, sir. And I'll use pictures of your-"

I hung up before he could finish the sentence. Don't have time for that bullshit. Figured he didn't care about his job anymore and was just fucking with me.

I did end up going to a different repair shop. Turned out it was a simple fix. Just needed a software update; took about 20 minutes.  I didn't give it much thought after that. 

A couple of weeks went by without incident. The next thing that happened was when I was in bed going to sleep. I felt a drop of water land on my forehead. Then another. And another. 

I got up and turned the light on, trying to find where it was coming from. But I didn't see anything dripping from the ceiling. Whatever; I was tired and I wanted to go to sleep. So I slept on the couch.

I called the apartment management office the next morning to let them know. As soon as the call was answered, I recognized that voice: it sounded just like the dealership guy. It couldn't be him though; that guy was probably in Sweden or something. There's no way he's working for my apartment complex now. 

"Something dripping on you, hmm? You should have your wife hold a bowl over you to catch the drops. That worked for me."

"Okay, I'm not even married. Are you going to keep being a smartass or have someone come and fix this?"

"Fixing it might take a while. My friend lost his hammer; we think it was stolen. So we're going to have to go get his hammer back before we can do anything for you."

I hung up again. I already hadn't slept well, and I was getting pissed. So I went to the office in person. 

"Where's the guy I was just on the phone with? I wanna talk to him."

They said they didn't know what I was talking about; they hadn't gotten any calls that morning. I pulled out my cell phone to show them the call record, but there wasn't one. No record that I had called them.

I was starting to feel a little spooked now. I pushed that out of my mind, though. I had to go to work, and I wanted to grab breakfast before my shift.

I got in my car and lit up my usual pre-commute cigarette, flicking the radio on while I smoked. 

"Okay listeners, we've got a special treat for you this morning. We're going to be listening to a phone call from a raven starver."

The hell is a raven starver?

"Thank you for calling (dealer name), this is Loki. How can I help you today?"

Okay, the radio was playing a recording of my phone call with the dealership. I switched to a different station; it was playing the same thing. Every station was playing the same thing. 

I didn't know what was going on. But I had to get to work. But of course, as I was about to start driving, my display screen was screwing up. Instead of showing navigation, all it showed was [these weird symbols](https://imgur.com/a/GXGjufI).

As I was driving, and against my better judgment, I called the dealership again; the same one I had originally bought the car from. 

"Thanks for calling (dealer), this is Loki speaking."

Of course it is.

"Look, I don't want any more drama here. My dash screen isn't working. Can I bring my car in later today to have it checked out?"

"If you’d like, I can try to run a remote diagnostic."

Were my ears deceiving me? Was he actually about to be helpful?

"Yeah, sure. Do that."

A few minutes went by in silence. Then he started talking again. 

"Oh dear, I think I accidentally activated the Choke A Bitch function."

"You-"

Before I could fully process what he had just said, I felt something on my throat. The seat belt was somehow now wrapped around my neck, and it was tightening. 

I panicked, taking my hands off the wheel, trying to pull the seat belt off my neck. But it wasn't budging. I could barely breathe. As I was fighting with it, BOOM! I had veered and hit a light pole. The airbag went off. But the pressure on my throat was gone; I could breathe again. 

Police and paramedics showed up. I didn't bother trying to explain what had happened. How would I phrase that without sounding insane? They decided, though, that I must have hit some ice on the road. 

I called my boss to tell her I'd been in an accident and wouldn't be in that day. The medics said I should go to the hospital to get checked for injuries. But I was lucky with that, at least. No concussion, no internal bleeding or anything. But my car is fucked now.

I went home. With what I saw when I walked in, I think I'm starting to realize what I'm dealing with here. My bedroom door was gone. I don't mean it was off it's hinges, I mean the doorway itself was gone. [Here's](https://imgur.com/a/u6wNX8u) what it did look like before. And [this](https://imgur.com/a/Hgy3h27) is it now. Just a blank stretch of wall where it was a few hours ago.

I don't know what to do. If I try calling anyone for help, he's probably just going to answer again. And I have no idea what he's going to do next.
