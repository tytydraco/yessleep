As sad as I was about Mikey’s absence, the walkie-talkie was a comfort.  Hearing him a couple of times a week was enough to keep me complacent.  And he knew that.  The Summer continued, and I had friends come and go through my bedroom, my spacedog, a community secret among the suburban kids.  No one ever got to see the saucer under my bed.  I guarded their wandering eyes constantly.  No one was to be near him.  I sort of contratial trust was re-established between me and the starman, but the sting of what happened to Mikey rang in my head daily.  

A couple of times a week, I would ask for a new gadget or a new console that was planned to be released.  My room became a treasure trove, with countless consoles, boxes of dangerous toys, etc., buried in my closet, bedchest, and anywhere else I could cram them from my parents.  The dog was the hardest to keep under wraps; it was always stoicily quiet whenever I was out of the room, like it just shut off.  But it was still an animal when I was playing with it.  I couldn’t risk taking it outside, and playing a hushed game of catch in my bedroom got boring really quickly.

Finally, one day, after a friend, who was equally as bored with my dog, left, I asked the big question.  “Hey…hey, alien man?”

He poked his little head out from under the bed, “Yes?”

“Can you…Can you return this dog?  It’s getting hard to hide it and…I don't know, I can’t even take him outside.”

“Hmm, that is a predicament.”  He said thoughtfully.  

“You can’t do it?”  Disappointment dripped from my voice. 

“I can, but I am afraid I will need more power.”

“...”

“Haha, don’t worry champ!  I have been researching alternative fuel sources.  I will just need you to install something on the house across the street.  Simple as that!”

“Install what?”  That foreboding returned with a vengeance.  

“Just a Solar Nabber, it will directly send power to my IMP!”  He rushed back under the bed, returning with an antenna.  Its red ball was much bigger, no bigger than a baseball.  It had claws at the end of it, stiffly ready to clamp onto any surface. 

“...Ok, it’s only for the sun, right?”

“Of course.”  He reassured me.  

With that, I snuck out that same night.  The house across from us was smaller, which helped me climb it as nimbly and quietly as I could.  The kid from this house was a recent pal of mine, relatively new to the neighborhood. I didn’t know him that well.  Which helped in my selfish drive to get this task over and done with.  The highest point made sense for clamping the antenna on, but I also wanted to make sure my parents wouldnt be able to see it from across the street.  I rummaged on the roof, trying to find the perfect spot.  I stopped right above a bedroom window.  I leaned down to see whose room it was.  It was my new pal’s room.  With a shrug, I clamped the antenna down; its claws automatically pierced into the roof tiles.  A beep was followed by the soft glow of the ball.  

Satisfied, I worked my way off the house and snuck back home.  Sliding through the back door, I crept up the creaky steps, praying with every step that my parents were sleeping deeply.  With a sigh of relief, I slid into bed.  As I drifted off, I heard the soft humming start up underneath me.  Just before sleep overtook me, I saw the soft green glow fill my room.  

I woke early in the dark hours of the morning, feeling a little queasy.  I rolled out of bed with a grumble to waddle to the bathroom when I glanced out my window.  Across the street, atop the neighbor's house, a soft red glow flashed on and off.  I didn’t think anything of it; obviously, it was just the antenna I had installed.  It was only a couple of years ago that I put it together why he wanted that antenna installed on that house.  Mikey’s home was a few blocks away, but perfectly lined up with that house on the map.  

 After a rough number two, I stumbled out of the bathroom and returned to the now dark and quiet room.  All activity had ceased under my bed.  The dog was gone.  The week continued, and I thoughtlessly went about my Summer break, talking to Mikey on and off via walkie-talkie.  Somehow, the neighbors across the street never noticed the tiny antenna hidden above their son’s bedroom window.  

I eased back on the IMP abuse.  At this point, I was more eager for the starman to finish his repairs and leave.  I was getting more anxious about hiding everything from my parents.  The last month of Summer break was when I was finally frustrated enough to confront the little astronaut.  After brushing my teeth, I slipped into my PJs while trying to organize how to go about the interaction.  With a deep breath, I pulled up the blanket curtain and said, “Hey, it's been over a month now.  Are you going to be out of here soon?” I was shocked and proud of how blunt I managed to be.  

The starman poked his little head out from the interior of the saucer, “Oh, sorry to inconvenience you, sir.  Is my IMP not up to satisfaction?”

Now on the back foot, my nine-year-old brain reeled at, “No… no, it's not that, it's just… you’ve been here a while and I haven't really had a chance to play with my friends in here cause I’m worried they’ll find you and…” I trailed off.  I never liked the way he would stand there looking at me, unable to see his face.  That gut feeling would always come back. 

He stood looking up at me for a moment before answering, “I am almost finished; the last of the repairs should be done shortly.  Then I will just need to collect some data I was sent here to collect to begin with!”  

“Data?”

“Yes!  Just some standard information on human behavior, nothing too interesting for the very subjects being examined!”  The bravado in his voice camouflaged that statement with an un-seriousness that a kid like me was too stupid to peel off.  

“Well, ok.  If you're almost done, I guess that's fine…”  I replied.  

“Perfect, thank you, sir! I will continue my repairs now!”  he made his way back into the saucer.  

I felt upset, more so than usual.  This gut feeling didn’t go away after that talk.  It only grew.  After pacing for a bit, I left my room.  The humming made me feel awful.  

Getting a glass of water from the fridge, I ran into my mom, she was sitting quietly at the kitchen counter.  Desperate to remove this feeling with a distraction, I ran up to my mom, gleefully thankful for her presence.  She turned to me, and I froze.  She had been crying.  What was worse, she resumed crying when she saw me.  Guilt burned in my chest, refueling the knot of unease I had already been haunted by.  I knew it had something to do with me; I felt it. 

“What's wrong, Mom?”  I dared to ask her.  

“Oh sweetie…” She sniffed, “I am so, so sorry, but I just got off the phone with Mrs. Onett.”

Mikey’s Mom.  My stomach sank.  

“Is Mikey ok?”  My throat was tight.

“I thought you were in bed…”  Mom clearly wanted to hide something from me, she wasn’t ready to tell me.  She continued, “Mikey collapsed a couple days ago; he is in the hospital now.  He’s ok… but he has been verbally unresponsive…”  Obviously, my Mom wanted to be honest with me, but she withheld a lot of information about Mikey’s condition.  I was fucking nine, so not something to dump entirely uncensored on me.  I heard from his parents years later that Mikey had been quiet for over a week, almost mute.  He would sit for hours staring at nothing; he rarely left the house.  His parents thought he had a spat with a friend; they didn’t have time to worry until he collapsed.  He wasn’t just unresponsive; my Mom knew this.  When Mikey was at the hospital, before they even scanned his brain, they knew it was related to his head.  After the scan, they saw, almost all of Mikey’s brain activity was… off.  Neurons were fried, and the entire frontal cortex was silent.  A near comatose level of brain inactivity.  

In that moment, I felt sick.  I was too shocked to realize the implications or track the chain of events leading to this.  But I knew it was my fault one way or the other.  Memories of entire conversations over the walkie-talkie flashed in my mind.  I was talking to him for weeks, right?  He wasn’t mute.  He wasn’t… wrong.  It can’t be because of me?  These thoughts ravaged my head as my Mom tried to offer a comforting hug.  

“...But I talked to him yesterday…” I mumbled in my Mom’s embrace.  

She led me upstairs.  I was numb, barely aware of each step.  She guided me to my bedroom door before she reverted back to Mom mode and said, “Oh, your water, let me go get it for you, sweetie,” and hurried back downstairs.  I stood at my door, a zombie.  Tears threatened my exterior composure.  The static in my head dispersed just enough for my awareness to return.  I stared at my door. 

And listened to the humming coming from inside.
