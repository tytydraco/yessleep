My name is David.

I won’t waste your time. This isn’t a story—it’s a warning.

About a month ago, something happened that I can’t explain. I’ve tried to forget it, delete it, even burn it from my mind. But it’s still there. Still playing in my head like some kind of cursed film reel.

You see, I used to be obsessed with Teen Titans—I mean, the original Cartoon Network run. I grew up on it. Every morning before school, I'd race to the TV just to catch reruns. And like any real fan, I always hated that it ended on Season 5. There were rumors of a Season 6—some continuation that never made it to air. Most people chalked it up to budget cuts or low ratings.

Not me.

I went deep. Forums, archives, even digging through ancient threads from dead websites. I wanted answers.

It was during one of those rabbit-hole nights—a humid, buzzing summer night—that I stumbled across something. A site I swear wasn't there the day before. It looked... wrong. Like something built in 2001 and abandoned. But the link at the top grabbed me.

"Teen Titans: Season 6 – Full Episodes – Leaked Archive"

Yeah. I know. Too good to be true.

The description said it was ripped directly from a recovered hard drive of an ex-animator. It even named the episodes—three in total. But there was no download button. Just a message:

"You don’t find the Titans. They find you."

I chuckled at first. Dumb internet scare tactic. Still, I left the page open. I remember walking down the hall that night, my cat curled up by my door. Everything felt... off. The bathroom light flickered for a full minute before exploding into a sickly yellow hue. I ignored it.

The next morning, at exactly 6:00 AM, someone knocked on my front door.

When I opened it, no one was there. But something was waiting on the ground.

A package.

Unmarked.

I brought it inside, sat at the kitchen counter, and tore it open. Inside... was a black external hard drive.

It looked old. Scratched. Used. No branding. Just a sticker on the side with a name:

"TTS6MP4FS.EXE"

My blood ran cold.

It was the exact file name from that site.

But I never entered my name. Never gave my address. Hell, I didn’t even click anything. Somehow, it found me.

I should have burned it. I should have thrown it out the window and walked away.

But I didn’t.

I plugged it into my laptop. Instantly, my computer recognized the drive—no errors, no viruses, nothing suspicious. Just one single program.

I clicked it.

What loaded was a crude DVD-style menu. A distorted version of the Titans Tower in grayscale, static buzzing on the edges. Only two buttons: “PLAY” and “EPISODE LIST.”

There were only three episodes:

The Demons of Hell

The Corpse of Robin

dRaG mE tO HelL


Despite the names, curiosity got the best of me. I hit “PLAY.”

The intro started like normal—music and all. But halfway through, the song slowed down... reversed... and then cut off entirely. The screen went black. No title card. Just static.

Then the first episode began.

A red sky. Not orange or dusk-red. Blood red. The Titans Tower stood silhouetted against it.

Inside, Starfire was sobbing—like full-on, ugly crying. Beast Boy was pacing, calling out Robin’s name. Raven stood in the corner, facing the wall, muttering something. Her voice was layered, like someone whispering through a broken radio.

Cyborg... wasn’t there.

The animation looked like it was stitched together from unfinished clips—grainy, pixelated, like it was rendered with corrupted files.

Eventually, the scene shifted to Robin’s room.

That’s when I saw him.

Cyborg.

Or what was left of him.

He’d been dismantled—his mechanical limbs stripped, torso gutted open, wires torn out. His crushed head sat beside his broken chest plate, his eye still flickering dimly. One of his arms was nailed to the wall, twitching like it still had life.

I should’ve stopped watching.

But I didn’t.

The episode ended with a high-pitched, bone-shattering scream from Raven. One that hurt to listen to—like it pierced directly into my skull.

The second episode loaded automatically.

No theme. No warning.

It opened on Robin. He was in a graveyard. Alone.

Digging.

His face was gaunt, eyes hollow. He was drenched in sweat. Eventually, he uncovered something: Slade’s mask—rotted, worm-infested, caked in blood.

He held it up and shouted:

"YOU'RE NOT DEAD! YOU CAN’T BE DEAD!"

Then, out of nowhere—CRACK. Someone hit him from behind with the shovel.

The screen cut to black.

When it faded back, Robin was strapped to a table in some kind of dark lab. Rusted metal. Blood on the walls.

Then Slade stepped into view.

Except… it wasn’t Slade. It was something wearing his skin. His flesh was bloated, stitched in places, crawling with maggots. He hovered over Robin, humming some distorted version of the show’s theme.

Then… he began cutting.

I’m not describing what I saw. I won’t.

But I understood now what happened to Cyborg.

Slade... he used the parts. He took Cyborg apart and used his tech — his limbs, his core, his soul — to rebuild Robin. When the camera panned to Robin’s body again, he wasn’t human anymore. His arms were plated in mismatched cybernetic parts. His spine had wires jammed into it like a marionette. One of Cyborg’s glowing eyes had been shoved into Robin’s face.

He didn’t even scream. He just... ticked.

The whole time, in the background, Raven’s chanting returned. Louder now. More distorted. Like it was being whispered through the walls.

I slammed my laptop shut and hurled it across the room. It shattered on the wall.

That was three weeks ago.

And every night since, I’ve heard it.

The chanting.

It started in my dreams. Then from the hallway. Now... it’s outside my door.

I hear gears grinding across the floor. Something dragging metal. And sobbing. Always... the sobbing.

I finally know what Raven was saying.

"Veniet pro te, David."

It means:
"He will come for you, David."
