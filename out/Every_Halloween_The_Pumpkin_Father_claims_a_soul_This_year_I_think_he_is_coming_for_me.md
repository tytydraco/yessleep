I used to think the story was fake, just a rumor to keep kids away from the old farmhouse. I had never seen anything myself, not until last year when it all happened. Not until I made a mistake, the worst mistake in my life, when I wrecked that pumpkin. It was an accident, but it didn’t matter, he did not care. I barely survived the nightmare of our first encounter and now I think he is coming for me again.

To start I should say my name is Jake and I used to live in a small town in Iowa, I wont say where for both privacy reasons and to keep people well away from that place at this time of year especially.

My town has a disturbing urban legend about a strange figure, “The Pumpkin Father”.

They say the Pumpkin Father first appeared here in 1967, after old farmer Keller's family disappeared. The man went mad with grief and lost his mind after his wife and children died in a house fire.

It was tragic, but what happened after, was where is got more…disturbing. They say he began to carve faces into pumpkins. Not the cheerful, grinning Halloween kinds, but twisted, anguished expressions that looked too real to be made by human hands. People claimed the faces resembled his lost children. Worst of all, were the stories of how he would abduct people from town, sever their heads and place his pumpkin family jack'o lanterns on them to join his twisted surrogate family.

I remember hearing the stories as a kid. How every year on the anniversary of the fire, one person would disappear from town. Always someone who had damaged one of the Pumpkin Father's creations. The police called them runaways or accidents, but everyone suspected something worse. People would say that pumpkins would appear on the victims' porches the night before. I never paid much attention to the warnings. Not until last year, in October, right near Halloween. Not until I accidently ran over that pumpkin on the edge of Keller's property on a dare.

My friend Emily and I were driving home and passed the old farmhouse. Something distracted me from where I was going and I missed it, it was a jackolantern right on the edge of the road, just outside the driveway of the infamous farmhouse.

I stopped the car and got out, to check. When I looked closer, the side of the Pumpkin fell in further. But it didn't just break, it seemed to scream. A sound like wind that somehow formed into a child's wail after a moment. Emily heard it too. Her face went white and we both knew we had made a huge mistake. When we turned around we saw something, or someone.

It was a tall, impossibly thin figure standing at the edge of Keller's property, silhouetted against the dying sun. Its head was misshapen, bulbous. I blinked, and it was gone.

"Did you see that?" I whispered to Emily.

She nodded, her fingers digging into my arm. "Let's get out of here."

We didn't talk about it after that. Not until the pumpkins appeared soon after.

I was heading home after my late shift at the gas station, the October wind biting through my jacket. The streetlights cast long shadows and most of the shops were already dark except for the seasonal displays of pumpkins and cornstalks. That's when I noticed it, one of the pumpkins had been freshly carved, its jagged smile and triangular eyes seeming to follow me as I walked past.

I wouldn't have thought anything of it if not for what was carved into the fence behind it: "Family grows when seeds are sown."

The same words had been scrawled in faded paint on the old Keller barn by people trying to scare everyone each year. But seeing it now, a chill ran up my spine that had nothing to do with the autumn air.

I quickened my pace, keeping my head down. The whole way home, I felt eyes on my back. Twice I spun around, certain I'd catch someone following me, but the street remained empty. Just the wind stirring dead leaves across the pavement and the distant sound of a train whistle.

When I got home, there was a pumpkin on my porch. I almost dropped my keys. The pumpkin had been carved with a face so detailed, so precise, it looked like... Emily. The same gentle curve of her cheek, the slight upturn of her nose, even the small scar above her right eyebrow from when we were kids. The craftsmanship was impossible, no human hands could capture a likeness that perfect. But there it was, Emily's face staring back at me with hollow eyes that somehow held recognition.

I called her immediately, my hands shaking so badly I could barely hold the phone.

"Jake? What's wrong?" Her voice was cut off by a sudden crash, followed by the sound of breaking glass.

"Emily?" I called out, panic rising in my throat. "Emily, are you there?"

For a moment, all I heard was shuffling, then Emily's voice returned, pitched high with terror.

"Jake, there's someone in my house," she whispered. "I think, I think it's him. The pumpkin on my windowsill, it has your face."

"I'm calling the police," I said, already moving toward my door. "Just hide, I'll..."

A scream tore through the phone, cutting off abruptly. Then nothing.

"Emily!" I shouted into the phone. The line was dead. I couldn’t believe it but the call to 911 was not connecting, it just kept ringing, no one was answering to help!

I grabbed my car keys and sprinted outside, nearly tripping over the pumpkin with Emily's face. In my panic, I kicked it aside, watching as it rolled down the steps and split open on the sidewalk. For a split second, I could have sworn I saw something red and wet inside, not pumpkin flesh, but something else. Something that shouldn't have been there.

The drive to Emily's house took less than five minutes, but it felt like hours. I screeched to a halt outside Emily's house, the headlights illuminating her front door hanging open. The porch light flickered, casting distorted shadows across the yard. My heart pounded in my chest as I killed the engine and stumbled out of the car.

"Emily!" I shouted, rushing toward the house.

The moment I crossed the threshold, I knew something was wrong. The air felt thick, almost viscous, carrying the cloying scent of rotting vegetation and something else, something metallic and sharp. Glass crunched beneath my shoes as I moved through the darkened living room. The silence was deafening, broken only by the distant ticking of a clock.

"Emily?" I called again, my voice sounding small and afraid.

I fumbled for the light switch, flicking it on. What I saw made my blood run cold. The living room was in disarray, furniture overturned, pictures knocked from walls. But it was the trail leading down the hallway that made me freeze. Pumpkin seeds. Hundreds of them, scattered across the floor like breadcrumbs, glistening wet with something that wasn't water.

I followed the trail, eachstep forward with growing dread, my hand sliding along the wall for support. The hallway seemed to stretch and distort, shadows playing tricks with my vision. The seeds led straight to Emily's bedroom.

The door was ajar, moonlight spilling through her window onto the hardwood floor. I pushed the door open wider with trembling fingers.

Emily's room was empty, but her window had been shattered from the inside out, glass fragments glittering on the carpet like fallen stars. On her bed lay a single, perfectly carved pumpkin. Not with Emily's face this time, but mine. My own face stared back at me, rendered with such perfect detail that it might have been a mirror, except for the expression. The carved likeness wore a look of pure terror, mouth open in a silent scream, eyes wide with horror.

And that's when I saw it, the note. Tucked beneath the pumpkin, written on yellowed paper in handwriting that looked decades old:

"The seed is planted. The harvest approaches. Family waits at home."

My hands shook as I read the words over and over. Home. He meant Keller's farm. A sudden noise behind me made me whirl around, but it was too late. Something hard struck the back of my head, and pain exploded across my skull. I caught a glimpse of a tall, impossibly thin silhouette, the unmistakable bulbous head glowing faintly in the darkness. The pumpkin face looked almost sad as I crumpled to the floor, darkness rushing in from all sides.

I thought I was dead. Maybe I should have been.

When I came to, the throbbing in my head was unbearable. The air was thick with the smell of earth and decay. I tried to move, but my limbs wouldn't respond. Slowly, painfully, I opened my eyes to find myself lying on cold dirt in near-darkness. Only a faint orange glow illuminated my surroundings, a root cellar of some kind, with rough wooden beams overhead and earthen walls. Keller's farm. I was at Keller's farm.

"Emily?" I whispered, my voice hoarse and unfamiliar.

A soft whimpering came from somewhere to my left. I turned my head, wincing at the stab of pain, and there was Emily. She was bound with rough twine, her clothes torn, a trickle of dried blood running down her forehead. Her eyes widened when she saw me.

"Jake," she rasped, "we need to get out. He's..."

A door creaked open somewhere above us, and heavy footsteps thudded on wooden stairs. Emily fell silent, trembling. I tried to push myself up, but my limbs were leaden, unresponsive.

The Pumpkin Father descended into view, his unnaturally tall frame hunched beneath the low ceiling.His jack-o-lantern head glowed from within, casting flickering light across the cellar. The carved face was crude—a mockery of human features with jagged teeth and hollow eyes that somehow still managed to convey emotion. Right now, that emotion looked like... joy.

Somewhere beneath the terrible pumpkin helm, it looked like the vestiges of terribly burnt skin and a human face beneath.

"Family," he said, his voice like dried leaves scraping against wood. "Family waits."

He moved toward us with unnatural grace, bending down to grasp Emily by her bound arms. She screamed and thrashed against his grip, but he lifted her effortlessly.

"Don't touch her!" I tried to scream but it was no use and he carried her upstairs. I looked around for some means of escape. I struggled against my bonds, fueled by desperation. The coarse rope bit into my wrists as I twisted and pulled, feeling the skin tear beneath. A warm trickle of blood ran down my fingers, making the rope slick. With one final, painful wrench, my right hand slipped free.

Then I had an idea. My pocket. My phone. Was it still there? I patted frantically at my jeans, nearly sobbing with relief when I felt the rectangular shape. With shaking fingers, I pulled out my phone, squinting against the screen's harsh light. My heart sank when I saw no signal bars, but I desperately dialed 911 anyway. To my shock, it connected.

"911, what's your emergency?" The dispatcher's voice was like water in the desert.

"Please help," I whispered, terrified the Pumpkin Father would hear. "We're at the old Keller farm. He's going to kill us. Please hurry, send someone, anyone!"

"Sir, stay calm we will send help right away. Please stay on the line and….” The phone fell out of my hand and I saw the Pumpkin Father had come back in. He Grabbed me and hoisted me over his shoulder and I was carried upstairs to a dining room where a horrible sight awaited.

There were dessicated old bodies strewn around a table, each wearing leering pumpkin heads carved meticulously with the faces of what was once, living people. I saw our own pumpkins sitting on the table facing empty chairs. I was shoved into place and stared at my own visage carved into the pumpkin closest to me and I saw Emily sitting across the table in a similar situation. The Pumpkin Father's hand pressed down on my shoulder, pinning me to the chair with inhuman strength. I struggled, but it was like fighting against iron bars. The table before us was set with rotting food on ancient plates, a mockery of a family dinner.

"Welcome home," the Pumpkin Father rasped, his voice like autumn leaves skittering across a grave. "Family dinner. Family forever."

I looked at Emily, tears streaming down her face as she fought against her restraints. The pumpkin faces around us seemed to watch with hollow amusement, their carved expressions frozen.The Pumpkin Father moved behind Emily, his grotesque jack-o'-lantern head tilting as if in consideration. From beneath his tattered coat, he produced a rusted carving knife, its edge gleaming dully in the flickering light.

"Time to become family, first we must prepare," he said, his voice crackling like burning leaves. "The head must be... emptied... before it can be filled with new light." He whispered, while raising the blade to Emily's throat. "Time to wear your face."

"No!" I screamed, thrashing against my restraints.

Emily's eyes met mine, a silent goodbye in them that tore my heart to shreds. The Pumpkin Father pressed the knife against her skin, drawing a thin line of blood. I watched in horror as a single drop rolled down her neck, staining her collar crimson.

I had no idea what to do, I looked on in hopeless terror and thought we were going to die there.

Suddenly, the front door exploded inward with a deafening crash. Blue and red lights flashed through the windows, painting the grotesque scene in alternating colors.

"Police! Come out with your hands on your head!" An officer's voice thundered through the farmhouse.

The Pumpkin Father's head swiveled unnaturally toward the sound, the carved grin somehow twisting into a snarl. In that moment of distraction, I lunged forward with all my might. The chair toppled with me still half-bound to it, but I managed to throw my weight into the Pumpkin Father's legs. He staggered, the knife slicing air instead of Emily's throat.

"Jake!" Emily screamed as the Pumpkin Father regained his balance and turned toward me, his pumpkin head burning with an unholy light.

A Police officer burst into the dining room, gun drawn and aiming at the knife wielding, pumpkin headed monstrosity. "Drop the weapon! Now!"

The Pumpkin Father tilted his head, regarding the officer like a curious child studying an insect before crushing it. The orange glow within his hollowed head pulsed brighter, casting long, distorted shadows across the macabre dining room.

"Not family," the Pumpkin Father rasped, his voice like wind through a graveyard. "Intruder."

Before the officer could react, the Pumpkin Father lunged with inhuman speed, his elongated limbs propelling him across the room. I heard the gun fire once, twice. The rounds struck the monstrous figure and the Pumpkin Father reeled but did not fall. A high-pitched, inhuman shriek filled the room as the bullets tore through the Pumpkin Father's form. The orange glow within his head flickered wildly, like a flame caught in a sudden draft. The knife clattered to the floor as he stumbled backward, his elongated limbs jerking spasmodically.

"Not time," he hissed, black ichor oozing from the wounds in his chest. "Not yet."

More officers poured into the room, their flashlight beams cutting through the gloom. The Pumpkin Father's head swiveled and he shrieked and then was gone.

He left the twisted remnants of his pumpkin family behind and we had been spared the fate of joining them.

It was a Halloween we would never forget, for all the wrong reasons.

In the aftermath of that nightmare, I left my hometown. I managed to save up enough to just go wherever I could afford to move. Anywhere was better than there. I did not know if the Pumpkin Father was still out there, still alive but I would not stay and find out.

Things have been alright since then, but now that almost an entire year has passed, it's happening again.

Even now it's Hallows Eve and when I got home from work tonight, I found something terrifying. I knew it was wrong immediately, I had not made a jack o'lantern this year, and I might not ever make another one.

Yet there it was on my front porch, a pumpkin with a face, my face. Not just any generic carving, but a perfect likeness down to the small scar above my right eyebrow. The craftsmanship was unmistakable, those same impossible details that only one entity could create.

I backed away, nearly tripping over my own feet. My hands trembled as I fumbled for my phone, thinking to call Emily. We'd promised to keep in touch, to warn each other if anything ever happened.

That was just a few minutes ago, she didn't answer. I left a message and hope to God she is alright. I am panicking and I don't know what I can do, it can't be happening again!

Please, if you are reading this, be careful. He is still out there, still looking for people to add to his twisted family. I made a mistake, but next time it could be you. I hope for your sake you never destroy one of his creations and never see him yourself.

I am going to lock my door, my windows and barricade myself in my room, then call the police. I hope they get here soon, they won't believe me, but it will make me feel a bit safer tonight, at least for a while.
