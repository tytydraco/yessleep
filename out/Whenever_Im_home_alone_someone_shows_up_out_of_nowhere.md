My mom and dad would always leave me home alone on Fridays sometimes even Saturday. My parents go to out because of my mom and dad couples therapy session but this therapist was for later at night maybe 7:30ish to 9:30. 

I stay in my room and turn off all the lights shut the door locked Aswell for the windows I am paranoid and always lay under my blankets in full darkness not a light on in the house but one day while I was grabbing some water I saw what looks like a 70 year old man.       

outside looking for a way in to my house I was terrified he had a grin so large and it also look like he was saying something crawled to my bed and quickly messaged my mom to come back I was having a nervous breakdown but stayed quiet  I then crawled to an opening in my upstairs where it looks towards 

the front yard he saw me I didn't even open the blind just peeked through the blinds he stared for a while I was so scared to move and when he started to knock looked back and disappeared

my mom and dad arrived and he disappeared. The next week after that he showed up around 8:40 at that point I had bats in my room and also camped out in the place he first saw me 

 he then saw me again with an even wider grin on his face I was frozen I  just accepted my fate but I didn't want to die for a while he started knocking in a way that he could knock the door down I was terrified and afraid of what to happen 

I then heard a thud Ans a second one the door had fallen off its hinges I got scared and just ran to my room hid under my bed with the bat saw him sort of but he was different

 he was now a dark figure with skin peeling off muttering words I could not hear he was much taller about 7 to 8 ft I wasn't 100 percent sure but he was 

closing in my room I was scared out of my mind and decided to die fighting that is till I stood up and saw him towering he was scrawny still he muttered words that I couldn't understand he went inside the bathroom next to my room and I sprinted out

 I prepared an escape route in my head which was run to the end of the street and climb a nearby persons fence but to my terror he was right behind me he was catching till I saw my parents car almost getting run over they saw what was chasing me and quickly unlocked the car door

 we crashed into him hitting his leg he then from the floor started running on all fours my dad had a blank expression mom terrified I was in shock my dad's told my mom how did it follow us here I asked you know what that is my dad said yes when you 

were first born it showed up at night with a large grin he was in the form of an old man I told my dad i saw last week but thought he wouldn't returned we never looked back and left the country it's been ten years and we never talk about it anymore I still get nightmares.
