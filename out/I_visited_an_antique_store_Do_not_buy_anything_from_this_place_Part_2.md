My life seems to have turned into a horror novel. I’m currently writing this from a hotel because we had to leave our house. We have been… tormented. That’s the only word to describe it. Ever since the day we visited that antique store.

In addition to Roger’s night terrors and the phantom cat in our bed, random things are going missing and turning up in odd places. We’re also hearing footsteps throughout the house. There’s absolutely no mistaking it. 

And that damned bell. Roger finally found it. 

I was awoken once again by the sound at around 3 a.m. At times, it was faint enough that I wondered if I was imagining it. Then it would sound as if it were close, but it was impossible to tell from which direction. Honestly, it was maddening. I’ve been dealing with this for weeks. 

Then I got angry. 

I started tearing the house apart -- cursing, yelling. Things got broken. I am not myself. 

After rampaging through the living room and dining room, I was in the kitchen, pulling pots and pans out of cupboards, when Roger finally decided he’d had enough. 

“Come back to bed.” 

“Why? I haven’t slept a full night in weeks!” I screamed. 

“This… isn’t normal, and you’re scaring me.” 

“*I’m* scaring *you*? You’re the one waking up yelling that something’s crawling on you!” 

That wasn’t fair, because I had felt it too. For some reason, it doesn’t scare me anymore. 

“I’m getting a room.” He left the kitchen. 

“That’s just great! Don’t help me find this frigging bell that *you* can’t hear! Just leave me here! That’s fantastic!” 

He returned shortly after with an overnight bag. I was violently pulling spice bottles out of a corner cabinet and tossing them onto the floor. 

“I have a change of clothing in here for you. Come with me.”

“No, just leave. I’ll deal with this myself.” 

He stood for a moment while I continued on to the next cabinet, hurling cups and saucers, shattering them onto the tile floor. He turned and walked out the back door. 

I slumped to the floor, sobbing. “What the hell is happening?” 

Seconds later, Roger was back -- bell in hand. 

“The milk door was open. It was just sitting there.” 

I stared in disbelief, tears streaming down my face. 

Roger sat with me on the floor and wrapped his arms around me. 

“I’m sorry for what I said.” 

“Me too,” I sobbed. “And for this,” I added, waving my hand at the chaos I’d created. 

“Let’s get out of here for the whole weekend. What do you say?” 

I held out my hand. “Give me,” I whispered. He handed the bell over. 

The clapper was missing. 

“This was not broken when I bought it. Did you --” 

“No, I just found it! Let’s just get out of here and we’ll throw the damned thing in the river on the way.” 

I shook my head. “Absolutely not. I’m returning it. I’ve got words for that woman. I don’t care if she thinks I’m crazy -- I *feel* crazy -- and she’s going to hear about it. I’m positive she knew she sent me home with cursed shit! What the hell is her problem? What did we do to deserve this?” 

I got up to put the bell into the overnight bag. 

“We’re not bringing that with us.” 

“Well, I don’t want it to go missing again.” 

“Hold on.” Roger went to the basement and came up with a hammer and a box of two-inch nails. “We’ll seal it back in the milk door.”

I placed the bell inside and he hammered ten nails into both the interior and exterior doors, then slapped the wall. “That’s not going anywhere. You ready?” 

I decided we needed wine. “Be right back.” 

Rummaging around the cluttered dining room floor, I found two bottles. *We’re going to need more*, I thought.

Scanning the room, I saw the glint of a bottle that had rolled just inside the office doorway. 

As I bent down to pick it up, I saw a pair of women’s shoes… attached to feet… and nothing else. 

I screamed so loud my voice broke. I ran past Roger as he was running toward me, straight down the back stairs, out the door, past the car in the driveway, and out into the street. 

A barefoot madwoman in her pajamas, clutching three bottles of wine in the middle of our quiet street, crying hysterically. 

Roger pulled the car out and opened the passenger door from the driver’s seat. “What the hell happened?” 

I got into the car. “Please, just get me far away from here.” 

The ride to the hotel was silent, but safe in our room -- feeling somewhat calmer near the end of the second bottle we drank -- I told him what I saw. 

“So… disembodied feet?” he asked. 

“Feet… and ankles, I guess. Wearing vintage shoes.” 

“What kind of shoes?” Roger asked, jokingly. 

“I didn’t stick around to examine them, Roger, but Oxfords, I think. With a sensible heel, of course!” 

We’ve been here three days. On the bright side, we’ve been sleeping really well. No nightmares, no invisible cat. Yet my mind cannot escape what we’ve been through the past few weeks. My nerves are beyond strained. 

I tried to talk Roger into going out to the antique store yesterday, but he didn’t want to get out of bed. I can’t blame him. He convinced me the store probably wasn’t going to be open on a Sunday. I tried to look up the hours, but I see no antique store in that village listed anywhere online. 

We’ll have to drive out next weekend. I can’t afford to miss any more work. I’ve decided I want my twenty dollars back, too. Hopefully the weather is nice. We can go to the beach, and I am going to buy us two eclairs each this time.
