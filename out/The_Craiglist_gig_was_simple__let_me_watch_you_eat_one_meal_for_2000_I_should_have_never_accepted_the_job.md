When I finally made it home after a week, it took three showers to return to normal. As I laid in my bed that night, my room lit only by my laptop, I vowed to never return to Hunting Park.

When the man sent his address a week prior, I double-checked it three times. Not only was Hunting Park a dangerous neighborhood, but he lived in one of the most disturbing sections of it—a devilish pocket of drugged up zombies, muggings, and burned-out homes.

Fortunately, or maybe unfortunately, the pay was too good to pass up. $1,000 for fifteen minutes, or as long as it took me to eat a plate of food.

I walked up to the man’s door and knocked four times, as instructed. As I waited, I looked around at the day-walkers. One woman was face down in a pile of trash bags, another guy was taking a shit next to a fire hydrant.

Suddenly, I smelled something horrible. I looked to my left—I caught a glimpse of her hair in the bushes. It was an older woman, probably in her fifties. Her shirt was tattered, hanging off her shoulders to barely cover her body. As she turned to look up at me, I noticed the dirt caked on her face. She had one eye closed, the other open.

“Please,” she mumbled.

I knocked on the door again, harder this time. She tried standing up, but fell face first into the bush.

“Where… where am I?” she asked.

I knocked again. I don’t know what scared me so much about the woman. I’d seen strung out people before, but she felt different, like someone was attacking her from the inside.

“Hello!” I yelled into the door. “I’m here.”

“I have a… a son,” she whispered. “Please, it’s… what year is it? It was only once, it… I don’t understand… it was just…”

I heard the doorknob twist. I pushed forward, knocking into the man.

“Oh,” he said, stepping back. “Hello.”

“Sorry sorry,” I said. “That woman just…”

“You’re quite skinny,” the man said, inspecting me.

“Is she okay?” I asked, catching my breath. “Is she always there?”

The man peered outside, then closed the door. I could still hear her mumbling.

“Oh, don’t mind them,” he said. “Our country has some problems, doesn’t it?”

“She just seemed… I don’t know,” I said, catching my breath. “I’m Andy, by the way. From Craigslist.”

I put out my hand, but he just stared at it. Although he seemed confused by the standard professionalism, he was dressed like a banker—dark blue blazer, beige pants, a white button-down with a blue collar, the kind of shirt finance bros wear. Yet, other parts of him felt childish, like his smile—crooked and forced, like a boy on picture day. His body odor was also jarring—somewhere between spoiled meat and dish soap.

“I hope you have an appetite,” he said, slipping his hand on my back.

“Well, I skipped lunch, like you asked,” I said.

“Oh good good good,” he said. “And please, make yourself at home.”

The apartment was surprisingly clean, or maybe it was just empty—I couldn’t tell. It looked like he had only lived there for a few days. In the center of the main room was a small table with white linen draped over it. There was a chair, some candles, and a metal food dome with utensils placed alongside it.

“It’s real silver,” he said, pointing to the table. “I’m not a flashy person, but I do see the value in having silver. Sometimes, a meal is an occasion.”

I walked over to the setup, laying my coat on the back of the chair. The man didn’t approach as I got situated—he stood a good distance back, watching me. In the emails we exchanged, he had specific instructions—once I started the meal, I had to finish it as quickly as possible. Then, I needed to leave.

“Sit, please,” the man said.

I took a seat, as instructed, and looked down at the covered dish. I could feel a knot form in my stomach. “This isn’t poisoned, right?” I asked.

The man shook his head. “No no no,” he said.

“How could I be sure?”

The man looked at me for a second, clearly frustrated. “You agreed,” he said.

“I know, but…”

The man huffed like a spoiled child. “Okay.”

“Okay?” I asked.

“I’ll double it,” he said. “Two thousand dollars. Take it, or I’ll go down the list of responders and pick the next one.”

I paused for a moment. Then, I imagined the money. I pictured it fanned out in my hands, how nice it would feel to cover three months of rent for a single, potentially poisoned meal. Plus, dying by poison was still better than getting fucked by my usual shame-ridden men.

“Okay,” I said.

The man giggled. The sound made me nauseous.

“Perfect,” he said, reaching down to lift off the dome.

On the plate was, what looked like, a pork chop with a side of apple sauce. I leaned forward and smelled it—it smelled like a pork chop and applesauce.

“So I just… eat it?” I asked.

"Yes,” the man said, taking a small step back. “Just eat it.”

I picked up the fork and knife and cut into it. I stabbed a sliver of pork and inspected it. It had a pale color to it, the meat dripping with juice. It looked like a normal pork chop.

“Here goes nothing,” I said.

I took a bite and studied the flavor. It was well-cooked, a little smoky, and a little sweet.

“Take a bite with the apple sauce,” the man said, pointing at my plate.

I scooped up apple sauce, lathered it on my next hunk, and took a bite. It wasn’t too sweet, potentially homemade. The flavors grew on me as I took another bite, and then another. The smokiness of the meat mixed perfectly with the tartness of the apple sauce. This was, maybe, the most delicious thing I’d ever consumed. I hadn’t had a home-cooked meal in months. The more I ate, the more the man groaned in pleasure. He rubbed his hands together, his mouth curled in a toothy smile.

Before I knew it, I was done. I felt full, satisfied, and filled with a strange feeling of joy.

“Wow,” I said. “That was really good.”

“Four minutes and twenty-three seconds,” he said.

I nodded, only mildly creeped out by his attention to detail. As I stood up and put on my coat, the man took a step toward me.

“Is there anything else you need from me?” I asked. The man shook his head.

“No no no,” he said, closing his eyes. He stretched his arms above his head and let out a long, erotic sigh. It sounded like he was having an orgasm.

“Oh God,” he moaned, shaking out his arms and legs. “*Oh Gaaaaaahd.”*

I laughed, awkwardly. “Alright, well, I should probably go,” I said.

The man dropped to his knees.

“Ohhhhhhh, I—how could it feel so…so good. I haven’t felt like… I’m like a kid, a baby a… *oh gaaaaaaahd.*”

The man’s eyes rolled as drool dripped onto the carpet. He ran his hand through his hair, spit webbed between his fingers. He didn’t even notice.

A distant panic set in. It felt like opening a bad report card. I didn’t feel sick, but I knew I needed to leave—an alarm was sounding deep in my body.

“The money,” I said. “I need the money.”

The man dropped his face into the carpet. He started to cry, but the sound wasn’t quite sad—more like relief. After a moment, he reached into his back pocket and tossed a wad of cash onto the carpet. It was wrapped in rubber bands.

“There’s three,” he mumbled. “Take it all. Please. Thank you. I—I didn’t know I could feel like—I…thank you, thank you, thank you.”

The man was now rubbing his face in the carpet spit, sliding his cheek across the fabric like a cat. He moaned again. I leaned over, grabbed the money, and ran outside.

As I stepped into the sunlight, I was hit by a cold wind. My stomach twisted, sweat dripped down my forehead. I thought back to my poison hypothesis, but I knew that wasn’t the case. I wasn’t sick, at least not bodily. This was all happening in my brain, a Trojan horse attacking from the inside.

I looked left, then right, then left again. Suddenly, I forgot where I was, where the subway station was, how I even got here. I ran my tongue across my teeth, dislodging a piece of meat. Now, it didn’t taste smoky or balanced anymore. It tasted rotten.

I stumbled down the steps and walked left, or maybe it was right. I don’t remember. But, I only made it a few steps.

Suddenly, my face hurt.

I looked up. My chest was on the sidewalk.

The sun had set. It was dark and freezing.

“What happened?” I asked, my voice raspy.

I pushed against the ground and somehow made it on my feet. Around me, the drug zombies were more brazen, wandering out of their hiding spots and taking to the street. They bumped into each other, swung their fists aimlessly, howled like wolves. At night, Hunting Park looked like a carnival for the insane.

I looked back at the man’s house, but I couldn’t tell which it was anymore. I reached for my phone to check the address, but it was gone. I checked all my pockets. No phone. No wallet. No keys. No wad of cash.

“Hel—help me,” I whispered, but my voice was getting weaker, each word a new challenge.

I took another step forward, but my foot hit the curb. I fell forward, landing face first on someone’s lawn. Pain shot from my eyes to my ears to my collar bone. Blood dripped onto my lip. Somehow, I managed to turn on my back, now staring at the smog-hidden stars. As I watched the night sky twist and turn, I became overwhelmed by a strange feeling. I closed my eyes.

Then, I saw it.

It was a boy’s face. He had freckles and curly, brown hair. His eyes were open, but not quite looking at anything. His tooth was chipped. There was a line of cut flesh below his chin, running across his throat. Dark blood ran down his white t-shirt. He was young, probably no older than six or seven.

I felt something heavy in my hands. I looked down. I was holding a shovel. The row of homes shrank in size, the flag poles morphing to branches. I looked down. The sidewalk was gone. I was in the woods, standing over the boy’s body. The trees whistled above me—the wind humming frantic, high-pitched. I couldn’t stop shivering. As I looked down a second time, I realized where the boy was—the grave was too small for his body, his legs bent in different directions.

Without thinking, I leaned down and scooped up a pile of dirt. I didn’t want to, but I twisted my shovel over the boy, covering his face with stones and mud. It filled his open mouth.

*Why’d you cry so loud?*

The thought popped in my head.

*If you didn’t cry, I wouldn’t have needed to do this.*

I couldn’t place the voice of these thoughts. They were invading me, attacking my pasture like hungry soldiers.

You made me do this. The other boys didn’t cry. You did this to yourself. You did this.

I dug my fingernails into my scalp, hoping to reach in and stop the thoughts from coming, but they wouldn’t. My reality kept slipping. I couldn’t tell the city street from the woods.

Then, I felt a hand on my shoulder. I whipped around. It was the old woman from the bushes.

“Did you eat it?” she asked. Her voice was calm, measured.

“Where am I?”

“Oh no,” she said, squeezing my arm. “You didn’t finish it, though, right?”

I looked around, dazed. The woman snapped her fingers in my face.

“Hey! Talk to me. How much sin did you ingest? A few ounces? A pound? What was it?”

I turned back, looking for a break in the trees to escape, but there was none. The forest had no exit, the trees bound together like fence posts. I turned back to the woman, still trying to catch my breath.

“Just breathe,” the woman said.

“I need to get home,” I said. “My parents, they’ll—they’ll call the cops, right? They’ll find me?”

Unprompted, the woman stepped forward and hugged me. I hated it. It felt like getting strangled.

“We didn’t know what was in it,” she whispered. “It’s not our fault.”

“Get off of me!” I yelled, pushing her back. She stumbled for a moment, then fell back into the grave. I walked over to look, but she was gone. Only the boy remained.

“Where—where am I?” I asked. “Please, someone—I, I don’t like this I… please.”

I turned away from the grave and ran toward the treeline. When I got to one, I balled my hand into a fist and punched the bark. I needed it to move. I needed to get home, to throw up, to go back to normal.

*Bang! Bang! Bang!*

I knocked again, then again, then again. Still, no movement. The tree remained. I was trapped. I looked back at the boy. I could see his broken fingers peek out over the grave.

I knocked three more times. This time, a light emerged, brighter than anything I’d seen before. I looked up. A man was standing there, a baseball bat in his hands.

“Pl—please,” I mumbled. “I just—I…”

“Get the fuck off my porch,” he said. I could see a few kids running around behind him, playing some game with wooden swords.

“No, I—I was…”

I tried walking forward, but he stopped me, pushing the tip of the bat into my chest.

“I’ll smack that junkie smile off your lips,” he said. “Leave! Now!”

I took a step back.

“I…” I said again, but it was useless. My brain and body were in separate forests, the[ dead boy](https://www.dandeluise.com/gather-round-anthology) buried between them.

I stumbled down to the sidewalk. I looked up. Somehow, the sun was here again. It was hot, blistering like summertime. My shirt was soaked in sweat. I walked forward, the streets of Hunting Park laid out like dead vines.

I kept walking until my legs wouldn’t allow it. I dropped to the ground, my elbows breaking my fall. As I tried to crawl forward, I tasted another piece of meat, still lodged in my teeth. Now, as I sucked on it, it was beyond repulsive, like eating a spoonful of feces. But, it wasn’t feces, or expired meat, or a pork chop. As I chewed on the material and swallowed, my heart sank. I realized what I had eaten.
