I've been jumping. 

I don’t mean physically jumping up and down. 

I’m talking about a phenomenon that allows me to jump into other people. 

And yes, it's real. 

It started with narcolepsy. 

I would doze off in the middle of class or the library and wake up somewhere completely different. Sometimes it was back at home, but there were times when I would be in the middle of a full-blown conversation with a cashier at the store or filling my car at the gas station, with no memory of how I got there. I can only describe it as my mind going into autopilot and being more of a passenger riding at the back of my thoughts. The sensation was strange. 

My body didn’t feel like mine, more like a meat suit, a coat of flesh I had just thrown on. It felt like myself and my mind were two separate things. 

For example, it happened a few weeks ago. I was in morning class, zoning out. 

I blinked, and the sky was suddenly dark, hours flashing by, a whole day. 

I was standing in a store I didn't recognize with the cashier staring at me like we had been talking, and I had a stray thought that was not mine, an icy shiver creeping down my spine. 

It almost felt like phantom fingers reaching inside my skull and grasping hold of my brain stem. Like my mind was not entirely mine. *Did I put Lucy to bed?*

I had no idea who Lucy was, and yet that thought was all-encompassing, a motherly-like force inside my mind trying to take control. I left the store with an odd twist in my gut, that one thought still at the forefront of my foggy brain.

*Did I… put Lucy to bed?*

I kept walking, and in front of me a woman was power-walking down the sidewalk, a bag of groceries clutched to her chest.

*Did I put Lucy to bed? Yes, of course I did.* The thought crackled like static interference in my skull. *I’m sure Sammy is taking great care of her…*

The voice wove in and out, like it was alive. 

*Sammy is fine! I'm sure he'll remember to check on her.*

I shook my head, squeezing my eyes shut. The thought drifted once I was crossing the road and jumping onto a bus. This thing was like a cell phone signal, fading once the woman and her thoughts were disappearing behind a vaporwave of traffic. 

But I couldn’t shake the feeling of a phantom force suffocating me, bleeding into my brain. 

*Lucy.*

*Sammy.*

*I was stressed out*, that's what I told myself. 

That didn’t stop me from revisiting that night over and over again in my head, the more I blacked out and found myself in progressively weirder places. 

I had no memory of going to that store. 

I didn’t know why I went there or what I went for. Just like waking up at the bus stop in the middle of the night, or on campus at dawn. I just woke up there, and there was no logical explanation. 

I couldn’t explain feeling detached from my own body, or the panicked thought that *Lucy might climb from her crib.*

Lucy was the woman's daughter, and yet she felt like mine. 

It’s not like I live an unhealthy lifestyle, so I figured it was just stress from work. I did a lot of googling, and yes, stress could sometimes cause you to see things that were not there.  

However, it was when narcolepsy began to drift into something else entirely, something I couldn’t understand—when I started questioning not just my sanity, but my existence entirely. 

The spring blossom was beginning to fall when I did my first proper jump. 

I consider this an official jump, even if I was probably doing mini-jumps whilst out of it.

I remember sitting in the library trying to will myself into thinking about anything that wasn’t my rapidly crumbling mental state. I had three essays to do and I wasn’t even halfway through the first one. I was just staring at a blank document. Before a loud laugh exploded from across the library. 

It was a guy playing a card game with his friends. 

The four of them seemed to be dead-set on ruining my focus. When they exploded into yet another fit of obnoxious laughter, I jumped up with the intention to stride over and tell them to shut the fuck up. 

I definitely jumped up, but the movement was suddenly too violent, the world swaying around me. I was off balance on my feet one minute, and in the blink of an eye, I was slumped in a seat in front of three confused faces. 

I felt heavier, and I was in an odd position, my legs crossed underneath me. When I stared down at my hands, they were someone else’s, someone else with skin a shade darker than mine, what looked like a festival wristband attached to their wrist. 

Coachella 2022. This person was rich. 

Like, *rich* rich. 

But it wasn’t me. 

Because Coachella wasn’t my thing, and even if it was, I wouldn’t wear the wristband a whole year after. 

Panicking, I could feel my body stiffen. 

“Harry.” One of the faces spoke to me. 

"Dude, are you having a stroke?” 

The guy laughed at that, but part of him looked worried. Because a scream was clawing at a throat that wasn’t mine. My surroundings had changed. 

I was closer to the door, and the scowling librarian who used to be across the room, was at her desk. But it wasn't just that. 

I was being suffocated, overwhelmed with thoughts that again, were not mine. Instead of simple static like the convenience store woman, these were a physical force slamming into me. I had memories of waking to a brunette girl wrapped around my legs, a breakfast of monster energy, and half a pack of Doritos. 

I could still taste it at the back of his throat, stale chips mixed with sugar.

*Did Nancy even read my fucking text? …. Dad thinks I’m using her, but I like her. Fuck. I really like Nancy. Like for real.* 

For a moment, it was almost like this guy was refusing to let me in. I could sense his thoughts trying to shove me out. When my mind finally climatized with the guy’s body, I was laughing. 

No, he was laughing—and his laugh was bubbling up my throat and wrenching my chest, the back end of a dad joke one of his friends had made. There was a commotion on the other side of the room. *She just collapsed out of nowhere! Someone call 911!*  

I started to get up, this time in the boy’s body, but his felt heavy and wrong, I could barely move it. 

*Oh god, is she dead?!* 

I willed his body to submit to my mind, forcing him to take a step forward. 

But his body, and lingering consciousness, was stubborn. 

*Get the fuck out of my head.*

His voice was a low hiss, and I tried to. 

Trust me, I didn't want to stay in there. 

I started forwards with the intention to force my way out. 

Before I could, the world went dark once again. I felt his body drop, and myself fall, plunging into that unsettling darkness I had found myself all too familiar with. I jumped again. In one swift, confusing wave that came over me, it felt like flying. Falling. This time I could tell it was my own body because I was in full control of it. I was familiar with it, with my limbs, and even its temperature. What I wasn’t familiar with was the taste of blood coating the back of my mouth and teeth. 

I was lying face down on the floor, my face swimming in blood-tinged drool. My eyes flickered open, and I was greeted by a woman who loudly proclaimed that she was sure I was dead. I didn’t have a heartbeat or a pulse. I jumped up, trying to smile, and explaining I had a medical condition. 

But their eyes just grew wider. 

These people weren’t going to listen to reason. I didn’t realize my nose was bleeding profusely until a queasy-looking kid handed me a crumpled scrap of tissue paper.  

It felt like even my own body was rejecting me after that first leap, and my mind felt unstable. Like I was inside a stranger. Before people could start asking questions, I made myself scarce, almost walking into the guy I’d jumped into. His head was bowed, eyes on the ground. 

I could still hear his thoughts like they were attached to me. 

*Holy shit, did that girl come back from the dead?* 

I noticed he inched away from me, lips curling, before holding the door open for me with a patronizing smile. It looked like he had no idea what had happened, despite his mind clearly trying to shove me out. This boy was a stranger, and somehow he felt like part of me, his body and thoughts now mine. Just like the woman, however, that feeling faded when I was halfway across campus, and the invisible string binding us together was severed. 

I felt the jolt, his mind pulling free, dull pain creeping across the back of my head. Like I was losing part of myself. 

The boy, though, was relieved. I could sense the weight that was me slowly retract from his brain, his mind calming down, from what had been my invasion. 

I quickly realized after my first jump, and then an experimental one, that staying in someone’s body for too long did damage to my own, and a minute and a half was my endurance point. 

But it’s not like I could control it. 

How could I control it? 

How can you control something you can’t understand? 

I forced my roommate to move out because after jumping into her, I couldn’t jump back into my own body. I was paralysed inside her for hours, my scream locked into her throat. All I could do was stare at the ceiling, and will myself to jump. 

*Jump*. 

I managed to move her manicured finger slightly. 

Then her head.

*Jump!*

I saw it as easing myself into her, this time taking my time, and being gentle. The two of us had to agree with the overlap, before I took control. That was why the boy's body didn't move. He had rejected me, shoving me out. 

Lucky for me, Kaia wasn't strong minded. I managed to jump out of her, and when I was back in my own body, shaking, blood running from my nose, I locked myself in the bathroom, forcing myself to stay stable, to hold onto my body. 

Jumping into people was exhausting. 

Like I had lived all of those lives, experienced those first loves. 

Pain.

Jealousy. 

Hatred. 

Sometimes my mind can’t deal with it and leaps back to where it feels safe. 

I couldn’t stop it. I couldn’t control it. 

So, after suffering through multiple weeks of losing time and blacking out with no memory of what I had been doing, as well as jumping into my lecturer, my swim coach, and a random old man passing on the street—I figured it was either therapy or turning myself into the psych ward. I had half a mind to try the latter after therapy.

Maybe I *was* in fact having a psychotic episode.

I had lost count of how many times I Googled psychosis symptoms, re-reading the same paragraph over and over again: People with psychosis typically experience delusions (false beliefs, for example, that people on television are sending them special messages or that others are trying to hurt them) and hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that others do not, such as hearing voices telling them to do something or criticizing them). 

So, there was nothing about “jumping into other people’s bodies” but I could definitely call that a type of hallucinating. The voices in my head could be seen as “audio delusions” too.

The “therapy” that my school offers to students wasn’t exactly what I was expecting. It was free so it’s not like I wanted a five-star experience, but being shoved into a waiting room filled with students who made a point to stare at me made me regret going. 

*Was there something on my face?*

The girl sitting opposite me, a smiling blonde with a ponytail kept catching my eye before leaning over to her boyfriend and murmuring in his ear. 

It didn’t help that I had been permanently nauseous and sick to my stomach for weeks. The idea of having to dive to my feet and barf in the trash made me feel even sicker, and my chest started to tighten, my eyes already scanning for an exit. 

Anxiety got the better of me, and I found myself pulling out my phone to peer into the camera to see if I had food stuck in my teeth or if my makeup was screwed up. 

But there was nothing wrong with me. 

The only person who wasn’t staring at me was a guy hiding behind a newspaper, though I could see the rim of his raybans.  

The stares got worse when I jumped up at my name being called.

My therapist’s name was Dr. Oliver. 

She seemed friendly enough, a petite woman around my mom’s age with a brunette bob who greeted me with a wide smile, spinning around on her chair like a toddler, before her expression darkened. Immediately, her cheeks seemed to pale, and she jumped up, wandering over to the couch and fixing the pillows before pulling the wooden table back a little for extra room.  Dr. Oliver directed me to sit down before sitting back on her spinning chair, loudly clearing her throat.“Would you like an extra pillow?”

I caught her gaze dragging down my body, fully drinking me in. There was a question on her lips, though I wasn’t sure what it was. Instead of speaking when I declined, she pointed to the overflowing trash can next to the door. 

“Feel free to use it if you need to."

Before I could comment on her odd remark, Dr. Oliver steepled her fingers in her lap. “All right, Iris. What’s been going on?”

I shrugged. “I think there’s something wrong with me,” I whispered. “I keep blacking out and forgetting what I’ve been doing.” I heaved out a breath. “And It’s making me feel crazy.”

I pressed my clammy hands into my lap. 

“Also…” I drifted off when her eyes found mine, but I couldn’t bring myself to say it. 

*How do you explain to a school therapist that you’re body-hopping?*

“Also…?” She tilted her head, and I could still see that question on her lips, her gaze not on my face, but drifting lower until I made a point of shuffling uncomfortably. Thankfully, she didn’t push. Dr. Oliver crossed one leg over the other. “So, you’re losing time?”

“I suffer from narcolepsy,” I admitted. “But it feels different. I’m not just falling asleep at stupid times, I’m forgetting whole days.”

She hummed. “Mm, and would you say the feeling is akin to not being in control of your body and thoughts? This can also be called dissociating.”

“Yes.”

“What makes you think that?”

I straightened up, relaxing a little. “I wake up in strange places. Like… I’ll be at home, and then I’ll be on campus or at the library. I can’t remember what I’ve been doing. I ask people, and they tell me I’ve been with them the whole day talking to them, or I’ve been attending classes like normal.” 

I shivered. “It’s like my body goes into autopilot mode and I can’t stop it.”

She hummed in understanding. 

“That sounds quite distressing, Iris. I am sorry to hear that.” Dr. Oliver turned and typed something into her laptop before turning back to me. “Why don’t we try to go through your day?  We can start by attempting to find a routine in your life, and hopefully, we can fill in the blanks and find the cause of this suppression. Usually, we block out certain memories due to trauma, and that would explain why you have been blacking out and losing time.” 

Her eyes started drifting down once again, lips curling into a sympathy smile, and I shook my head. “I haven’t been through any trauma.” I said. "I'm fine."

“You may think that,” Dr Oliver said. “It is normal to blame the unnatural on things like stress or not getting enough sleep. I have students coming in thinking they are disassociating when in reality, they are drinking heavily throughout the night and the alcohol is affecting them. However, what you are describing sounds like you have suppressed memories that have deeply affected your mental state,” her expression darkened. 

“Your brain has shut down the possibility of trauma and is acting like nothing has happened. However, your body still feels it, and is still reacting to it even now.” Before I could protest, she leaned forward. “Iris, I’m going to ask you some questions—and some of them may trigger certain emotions and memories,” She studied me before retracting back in her chair. “If you would prefer for me to not proceed, I can make you another appointment and we can talk about it another time. In this case, I would suggest against that if this is affecting your daily life.”

I found myself nodding, swallowing sour vomit creeping up my throat. “I’m okay,” I whispered. “I’m fine with answering questions.”

Her eyes flicked down once again. “Iris, I have to ask, do you have anyone I can call if you…” Her lips twisted, and she trailed off.

“If I what?”

“Never mind. Just let me know if you feel nauseous."

“I’m okay.”

“Good.” Dr. Oliver was still frowning at me with that phantom question on her lips. She twisted around in the chair, pulled open her desk drawer, and grabbed a bag of anti-nausea candies, offering me one.  I took one gratefully, popping it into my mouth. It tasted like watermelon. Mulling the candy in my mouth, I relaxed slightly. “So, why don’t we talk about your classes first?”

I shifted on the couch. “I’m currently studying English literature and publishing."

Her expression brightened, and she pulled out a notepad and pen, scribbling notes down. “Oh, you want to be a writer? Do you have any favorite authors?” 

I could tell she was trying to ease me into the conversation, and it was working. I could talk about writing and my favorite authors for hours. Dr. Oliver shot me a grin. “Every writer has their inspiration. Who is yours?”

I felt the knot in my gut loosen and allowed myself to breathe. 

“Scott Westerfeld."

She smiled like she knew who that was before steering the subject back to delving into my mind, quickly scrawling something else down in shorthand. The scratching of her pen on the paper made me feel oddly comforted. “Do you take any other classes?" 

I had to think about that.

“No,” I said, before it hit me, my stomach lurching. It was like opening old wounds, my body going through a visceral reaction. 

I did take another class. 

But I didn’t remember signing up for it—only that I had attended a late class. I hadn't really thought about it until that moment, when someone was directly asking me about it. “Yes," I corrected. "I did take a late class last semester.”

She scribbled something down. “How long ago was that?”

I shrugged. “Nine or eight months, I think.”

“Can you tell me about it?”

My first reaction was to say no, because talking about it, or even about it, grazed an invisible barrier in my mind. I could feel my body going into fight or flight, and it hit me that this was what she had meant. Whatever I had experienced, my body could still feel it, despite my mind blocking it out. I leaned back, shaking my head. I don’t know why the thought of speaking suddenly made me feel like I was being shattered apart, my insides twisting. I started to panic. If my body was still suffering from this trauma– what had happened to me? I found my gaze flicking to the door, my clammy fingers entwining together in my lap, before Dr. Oliver pushed further, easing me into my thoughts. "You took a late class last semester, Iris," she said softly. "Can you tell me about it?" 

Strangely, I could.

“It was a class that… taught us to open our minds,” I said, the words drawn from my lips before I could swallow them.

I closed my eyes, and followed my own voice, deep into the recesses of my mind—just like Dr. Oliver told me. I was sitting in a brightly lit classroom—no, a lecture hall. There were seven or eight of us, but their faces were lost in shadow. I only saw shapes, shadowy silhouettes sitting around me. In my hand was a small plastic cup with an odd pink mixture filled to the brim.

“In front of you is a cocktail that will allow you to delve inside your own subconscious brain,” The voice in front of me was a woman with hair like liquid gold, a mesmerising smile I felt drawn to. 

She stood on the stage, holding her own cup. “You all gave your consent to take part in this experiment, and all you have to do is let go,” her smile grew. 

“Release yourself to your own thoughts.” 

I downed my cup with everyone else, a motion that was almost in sync. It tasted like watermelon. The flavor exploded in my mouth, and I leaned back in my chair, reveling in the fog that filled my brain. The room expanded with color, vivid reds, pinks, and greens polluting the air in front of me, bleeding into my vision.  I found myself laughing with the others, throwing my hands up, and studying my palms like they had the answers to the universe. 

All around me, the shadows joining me danced and enveloped each other, their chatter becoming one long string of buzzing white noise in my head. 

I think I followed them at one point, perching on the lap of a red haired girl, offering my thoughts to questions they asked through nonsensical gibberish and lying on the stage, head swimming, dancing in colors that were only getting brighter in my head until they were all-encompassing, and I was drowning in them. So many questions, so many answers, and choking on the taste of watermelon, visiting my most precious memories, and my darkest. My tenth birthday party, and mom leaving when I was twelve. I experienced the others' memories too, all of us connected, dwelling and reveling in our shared mind. It felt like an eternity had passed before I snapped out of it, finding myself still sitting at my desk, giggling into a pool of stemming drool. 

When I lifted my head, blinking rapidly, the classroom was eerily empty, save for a shadow looming over me, and when I looked closer, a face started to blossom from the shadow; one my mind had shoved deep down.

“You okay?”

*It’s all right, Iris.* Dr. Oliver’s voice was smooth like honey in my ears. 

I didn’t realize I was shaking, teetering on the edge of reality and dream. 

*Why don’t you try to describe this friend for me?*

I nodded, squeezing my eyes shut. 

The boy slumped into the seat next to me, and I caught a head of unbrushed curls slipping from a baseball cap, a polaroid camera hanging around his neck. This guy was the epitome of pretentious—and I don’t know if it was the drugs, or just my body taking over my mind, but I couldn’t stop staring at him. In my drug-drunk mind, he oozed color, practically glowing under a heavenly light that only shone on him. 

His freckles looked alive, each of them a star I wanted to connect to the other to create a constellation.  I liked his colors enough to make me feel giddy. 

I liked the way his jersey seemed to light up with him, streaks of blue and gold alleviated by that dizzying light bathing him. “Yes.” I murmured, mulling the taste of watermelon in my mouth. It was a blink-and-you-’ll-miss-it moment when I caught the cuff of his sleeve, and then his hand, my mind suddenly jolting back to reality for a moment before I plunged back into perfect oblivion, and I found myself laughing at the markings. “Are you?” 

I found his wrist and peered at it, running my hand over indentations in his skin, ones that should have rang alarm bells. But I was way too high to understand what was going on. To me, they were stars, no, constellations, embedded inside him. I don’t remember his response because that memory is more like a flash, which cut off halfway through. I just remember his words, and his laugh, his head tipping back with mine, the two of us laughing way too hard at a broken light fixture.

“Do you want to go get coffee?”

I moved my head a little too fast and the colors exploded again. “Would I like to… get coffee?” I scoffed, grabbing his wrist once again.

“What are they?”

The guy’s gaze flicked to harsh red marks entwining his wrist before shaking his head with a laugh. “I wear wristbands.” He poked me in the forehead. “I dunno, man, it’s probably from them.” He leaned closer, and I didn’t move—only enjoying his warm breath on my face. “Now.” He spoke in a slur too, which made us laugh harder. 

“Do you want to go get coffee with me?”

"Maybe."

Truthfully, I just didn't want to move. 

He didn’t reply for a moment, tipping his head back and frowning at the ceiling. I could hear him counting every individual tile. “I'm Rowan, by the way."

I didn't look away from the flickering light fixture. 

"Hi, Rowan."

Fast forward a few hours and I was sitting in an empty Starbucks, slurping on a chocolate fudge milkshake, enjoying the soft rustic tones of the coffee shop. The guy had fallen asleep halfway through our conversation, his eyes dropping, lips forming a sleepy smile before his head kind of dropped into his arms, mumbling into the table grains that his head was pounding. 

After draining my own milkshake, the world seemed a little more real, and I found myself finding my reflection in the window. I was deathly pale, and there was something about me that was wrong, that didn’t make sense. 

I looked for it in my eyes, in my smudged makeup— but it was nothing I could see, only feel, a coil of dread curling in my stomach, and the feeling of lost time. Rowan was completely out of it, and he looked more human in reality, less of an angelic shadow, and… just a normal guy. I could see doodles on his hand where he'd gotten bored in class.  It had been just the two of us, and now reality was bleeding through, my head was hurting, and the taste of watermelon was sour in my throat. 

I wasn’t even sure if I had introduced myself to him. 

“Rowan.” I shoved him and he groaned, mumbling that he didn’t want any breakfast, only charming me further. 

I don’t know why, but I found my hand wrapping around the boy’s wrist and lifting it in the air, peering at those markings. 

With a clearer head, something twisted in my gut. I ran my fingers over scarred and rugged flesh, a thought starting to blossom in my mind.

The chocolate milkshake started to creep back up my throat. 

*Definitely not from his wristbands.*

Dr. Oliver didn’t have to push me to delve further, because once I had these memories, or at least parts of them, I wanted to dig deeper. I was in the same classroom again. This time I was holding a green pill in my hand and a plastic cup of water in the other. Rowan was next to me, slipping the pill into his mouth and downing the water. I did the same when we were instructed to.

The professor’s name was Dr. Oak. 

This time she told us to sit back and close our eyes.

"Iris."

The voice came from next to me, and I glimpsed Rowan sitting stiff, his half-lidded eyes on the stage in front of us. “Fuck,” his voice was a slurred shudder. “We need to get out of here."

When I looked for his wrists, I couldn’t find them. 

But seeing Rowan made me question my own reality, and if this classroom was where I really was. The light burning my face was not there when I looked for it. 

There was just a broken light fixture.

Broken, I thought dizzily.

So, where was the light coming from?

“Iris, what did I say?”

Dr. Oak’s voice slipped into my mind, and I felt my body jolt, obeying her order. “Lean back and close your eyes."

I did.

I leaned back, the taste of watermelon tainting my teeth and the back of my throat. The last thing I remembered was relaxing in my seat, my head drooping, drool pooling at the corner of my lip. When I opened my eyes, the classroom was once again empty. Rowan was gone too, and this time there were no colors. 

The world seemed to be more black and white than color, and the light fixture above me felt like it was scalding my face. This time I wasn’t wearing shoes, and my hair felt greasy and wrong, like it hadn’t been washed in a while. 

Except I had washed it. I had memories of showering that same day. When I inhaled strands of my hair, though, I only smelled something rotten and off, like I had dipped my head inside trash. I was running my fingers through it when I glimpsed my own hands, my own wrists, where laceration marks were indented into my skin. Initially, I thought I was seeing things. But.. no. 

I was running the tips of my fingers over raw red marks slicing into my flesh. When I tried to get up, panic striking my chest, I couldn’t move. 

“No, Iris."

Dr. Oak’s voice came from the stage. 

When I lifted my head, the lights were off, and there was only her, and something bright, an intense white light burning my face.  "It's time to sleep.”

I did sleep.

Her words sent my head jolting back, my eyes flickering shut. It was only her voice that seemed to rouse me before sending me plunging into the dark, and each time I was sitting in that same classroom under the same light, I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. 

There was something spiking every part of my body, pricks of something sharp inserted into my arms and the back of my neck. This time I couldn’t hold the plastic cup. I couldn’t place the pill inside my own mouth. Dr. Oak did it for me, and her smile was gentle. 

I swallowed it down and smiled with her, and around me, the shadows of my classmates were silent.

“It tastes like watermelon.”

She nodded and told me to lean back.

I did.

But I leaned too far, until my body was falling, and this time there was no classroom; only the murky corners of a concrete tunnel and the metal squeal of my bed being shoved through pooling darkness I couldn’t comprehend. Sharp things were sticking out of me, and plastic in my nose helping me breathe. I tried to struggle, to scream, but there was nobody to scream to. 

The shadows who pushed me did not have human faces—or they did, but I couldn’t see humanity. 

Finally, there was light; intense, burning light that hurt my eyes, illuminating Dr. Oak’s face. The professor’s gloved hands were slick scarlet, and I wondered where that red had come from. I remember her producing something sharp, something that made me screech into the plastic over my mouth. But she just smiled, her fingers grasping hold of my chin, nails digging in. I didn’t feel the blade puncture the back of my head. I didn’t feel her hands ease their way inside my skull, creeping across my body and inserting more and more pricks. When she wanted to, she could send me to sleep and wake me up. “It’s time to sleep,” she hummed. 

I did. 

The classroom was my fantasy, where I laughed and got high with the shadows with no faces.

While the concrete room was my reality, choking on watermelon-flavored liquid and screaming when blades sliced into my flesh. I don’t know which came first. If everything started in that classroom with the watermelon pill, or I was always there.

“Iris, we can stop if you would like.”

My therapist’s voice interrupted me, but I shook my head because I was getting closer and closer to what I had shoved deep down.

“No,” I told her. “No, I want to continue.”

She seemed shaken, and I noticed her reaching for her phone, and then second-guessing herself, pretending to smile.

*Was she scared of me?*

“Very well.” She said in a low hum, and I leaned back and closed my eyes, willing myself to fall deeper.

It was after reality came crashing down on me that I started to see everything for what it truly was. I was inside a facility, a labyrinth of bleached white corridors and doors that wouldn’t open no matter what I did. This time, I was standing in a bathroom stall. I wore bloodstained shorts and a t-shirt from my latest check-up. In front of me was Rowan, with a freshly shaved head, all of his curls cruelly sheared away. 

I poked at the bandage wrapped around his skull, and he shooed my hand away with a scowl. “I’m okay,” he said, even when I could feel him trembling against me, see old red crusted under his nose. I could see where he had fought violently, ugly red streaks binding his flesh. “There’s a guard on duty tonight,” he said. “He rings his wife every night and leaves his post for exactly twelve minutes.” His breath shuddered. “I should know, I counted.” 

Rowan heaved out a sigh. “So, we’re getting out tonight.” He grasped hold of my hands, squeezing them harshly enough for me to find his gaze. “Before they…. you know," Rowan prodded at his shaved head. "I won't let her do this to me. She's a psychotic bitch who--" 

His voice collapsed into white noise when the memory overlapped with another, this one much darker. I didn’t know how much time had passed. Enough for Rowan’s hair to grow back to its usual mop of mousy brown hair. 

I was standing in a line, with him next to me. This time the light was a mellow golden spurt from a bulb above us. 

We were standing in the concrete tunnel, and I remember the splintered rock spiking into my back. A gunshot startled me, but I didn’t move, pressing my lips together. 

Then another—and **another**. 

I sensed the shadows next to me dropping to the ground in rapidly stemming red until there were five of us left. Dr. Oak’s face was a monster caught in the light, pinched eyes and a scowl twisted on her lips. She took a step towards me, shoving the barrel of her handheld into the flesh of my forehead before moving to Rowan, and sliding the gun down his cheek. “You should think yourselves as lucky,” she said, her voice booming. “I don’t accept defects."

She crouched in front of us next to a shadow—who bled into a pretty redhead. I could see where the bullet had pierced right through her head. 

“Pyrokinetic.” Dr Oak said in a scoff, before shooting another round directly into the girl’s skull—then another before it came apart completely, spilling spattered red and grey matter on the ground. I could feel myself slowly leaning back, my hand going to my mouth, my eyes wide, unblinking, I couldn’t stop staring as the professor delved into the cavern of the girl’s skull and severed the brain from its stem. 

It didn’t even look like a brain; not the one I had always had in my head. 

This thing was a bulging pulpy mess of veins and grey matter. Dr. Oak held it up, tracing the thing with the tip of her finger. “This is not what I want,” she said. “Do you see this, here?” she stabbed at the girl’s brain, and I was half aware that I had just thrown up all over myself. I barely felt it, only following her pointer finger, swallowing another mouthful of vomit. There were black streaks spiderwebbing through pinkish matter, tendrils of pooling darkness enveloping what had been healthy pink tissue.

“This is poison.” Dr. Oak spat, dropping the thing on the ground and straightening up. “It is a failure of what should have been a pyrokinetic.”

She stabbed at the other bodies, her lip curling. “A shapeshifter.” Dr. Oak pointed to the one furthest away. I could see pieces of his skull clinging to his sweater. “Psychokinesis.” She situated herself in front of Rowan. 

“Psychic suggestion.” 

Inclining her head, she ran the barrel of her gun down the curve of his throat. Rowan didn’t move, and I didn’t like the way he was looking at her, his eyes foggy and half-lidded, like he didn’t know where he was. This memory was unstable and brought me to another. This time I was standing in a white room with a single bed, and Rowan was caressing my cheeks, his eyes still empty. 

I couldn’t find him anymore.

I couldn’t find that spark that was him, only a pollution in his eyes that stiffened my body and contorted my thoughts.

“Iris!”

Dr. Oliver’s sudden shriek pulled me from the memory. I opened my eyes, expecting her to still be sitting in her spinning chair. 

But all I saw was stemming red pooling across the white tile floor. My therapist’s body was faced down in front of me, her head completely blown through. And in front of me was the guy who had been hiding behind the newspaper. I recognized him. I should have known it was him, but my mind had buried him so far deep down that I didn’t want to see him. Rowan. Instead of shooting me too, he held out his hand for me to take. “Dr Oak wants to see you,” he slid off his  raybans, vacant eyes drifting downward, his lips curling slightly. 

“We’re having a class reunion.”

It didn’t make sense to me how exactly he had killed my therapist without a gun.

I didn’t stay around to find out. I jumped up stumbling, the table in front of me crashing over without me even touching it.

“Iris.”

Rowan’s voice was a weapon, and I should have known that when my body was paralyzed suddenly, and I couldn’t move. All I could hear was him. I could sense him, feel him bleeding into my body and mind, entwining around my thoughts. “Come with me,” his voice cracked its way into my skull, and I let it. The world around me seemed to slow down, and there was only his voice, oozing into me, taking control. “I’m not going to hurt you,” he murmured. “Dr. Oak wants to do a check-up.”

Before he could gently wrap his hand around my wrist, I was being yanked back violently.

But so was Rowan. 

He was inching towards me slowly, and then he was crashing into the wall, an invisible force sending him flying. I didn’t see the girl’s face, but I already knew her fervent ponytail and the permanent scowl on her lips. Her grasp on my arm was familiar. Without a word, she dragged me back through the door, and down the steps towards the exit. 

Rowan was following us. 

I could hear his thundering footsteps. The girl pressed something into my hands, squishy and plastic. Earplugs. I corked them in, just as the man’s shadow bridged the top of the stairs. 

The girl didn’t speak until we were outside, and she was dragging me to a white van. She pulled the door open, and I caught a glimpse of a guy halfway through a McDonald’s, eyes wide, lips twisted. “Fuck.” He dropped the burger on the seat next to him, his grappling hands going to the steering wheel. 

“What the fuck, May!” He whined through a mouthful of fries, and in my mind, those shadowy faces standing next to me in the concrete tunnel—suddenly had faces. Not faces I could fully register. I only glimpsed sandy blonde hair. His identity was still polluted in darkness, still suppressed deep. “You could have warned me!”

“Drive!” was all the girl said in a sharp breath, when I dislodged the earplugs, before grabbing me roughly, and shoving me into the back of the van. 

I dropped onto my knees when the car swerved, throwing me into the shutters. There was another guy in the back, sitting with his knees pressed to his chest, head buried in his lap. He didn’t have a face either. When the van ran over a speed bump, he finally spoke in a low grumble, and glancing at him, the boy was hiding under a green hoodie, dark red curls falling over his eyes. 

I knew his hair because I used to tease him like he was a younger brother. I got a flash of a homely-looking living room filled with comic books and stained coffee mugs, a ratty couch that was familiar. But those memories, and that part of my life,  unreachable. Gone. The van swerved again, and my stomach flipped over.  The stranger seemed to be used to being thrown around like this. He clung to the sides, his expression unwavering. “How many weeks?”

Something ice-cold slithered down my spine. “What?”

The guy chuckled. “You heard me,” he hummed, and his voice was familiar, a heavy Boston accent. “How many weeks?”

Before I could answer, the girl squeaked from the front, “Double three!”

Green Hoodie rolled his eyes.

“Do I have to?” he shouted back.

Answering gunshots, however, made him jump up, his eyes widening. “Fuck.” He turned to me, his identity still shadowed.

“Get down,” he almost toppled over again, yelling at the driver to chill out. “If it’s shoot to kill, Oak will carve that thing right out of you.

"What?" 

"Just get down!" 

I didn’t understand what he meant, until something seemed to snap inside my head, and my perception shifted, the barrier inside my mind crumbling. I was aware of the guy lurching toward the shutters and pulling them down. 

When cutting night air slammed into me, I didn’t feel it.

There was a sleek black car in pursuit of us. Green Hoodie was struggling to stay upright, throwing his arms out, his panicked yelling to the others in the front clanging in my head.

"Drive slower! I can't reach–" The van door swung outwards with him still clinging on. 

"--It!" 

But I could barely register his yells, or the people who were after us. 

Instead, I was staring down at my belly. 

Which was suddenly bulging in front of me. 

Bulging, like I was about to go into fucking labor.
