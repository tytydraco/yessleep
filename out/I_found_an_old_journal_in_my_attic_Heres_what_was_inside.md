I wasn’t sure where to post something like this but my friend suggested this site so, Hey.


So a couple of weeks ago my wife and I were cleaning the house out. It’s the cold season and that annual winter depression was setting in so we wanted to make the house feel more “warm like”. I think thats the phrase my wife said. I wasn’t gonna complain, it gave an excuse to clean the house up from the holidays a few months ago. When I went to the attic to bring down some of the boxes to sort through I must have hit something with it cause this old dusty book comes falling down from the rafters right onto my head. Didn’t hurt besides the dust that definitely went into my nose and mouth. 


Now when I tell you this book is old, it’s old old. It’s got this leather bound on it that feels like you’re touching the real stuff, not that cheap grade bullshit from Amazon. The pages look worse for wear but I was able to read what was on them pretty decently. My wife and I checked the first few pages and figured out it must have been someone’s journal. It’s got all kinds of dates and drawings inside of it. We didn’t really know what to do with it but then my friend suggested the internet. So that’s where we are now. I spent the last 4 hours typing out what the journal says and describing the drawings best I can for you all to read. If anyone has any ideas or suggestions on what to do with it please let me know. 


June 16th, 1847

I found this book tucked under fathers things in his closet. He said I could keep it and use it as a journal for me to remember things. This will be my first writing. 


June 18th, 1847

Not much has happened since I got my book. Sarah says she wants one of her own but she’s too young to write like me. I told her she could watch me write when I do. She seemed happy about that. 


June 26th, 1847

Father says we have to be careful this season with the crops and animals. He’s not sure how winter is gonna look but he thinks it’s gonna be bad. I asked him why it matters if it’s so far away. He just looked at me and said it always matters. I’m not sure what that means.


July 5th, 1847

Sarah said she saw a man by the edge of the farm while she was playing. Me and father checked all along the fence but didn’t see no one. Mother says it’s cause she’s young and must have just been imagining things. I drew the man like Sarah said he was.


The picture shows a fairly normal sized person but they face isn’t right. He drew the eyes almost too far apart and the hairline is very far back. 


July 6th, 1847

Fathers friends came by the house today and brought his son John with him. We played by the farm while Sarah followed us. Sarah asked John if he had seen the man by the woods as well. John looked confused and we went back to playing.


July 10th, 1847

I keep hearing things outside. I can’t sleep and I don’t wanna wake up Mother or Father. I think I’ll just stay up and read. 


July 14th, 1847

Father had to put down one of the cows. He said she got sick and he doesn’t want the rest to get like her. She didn’t seem sick to me, but she didn’t seem healthy either. I guess he knows better.


July 15th, 1847

Mother is keeping me and Sarah in the house while Father checks the cows. He was running out of the house and yelling. I heard him say “How the hell is that cow back?!” I went to my room and looked out the window. I don’t think it looks like our cow. It doesn’t look like a cow at all. 


He drew a cow but he didn’t shade in any spots. There were no horns or utters on it either. The ears he made look too small and the face is more flat than a cows. It almost looks like a humans face.


July 20th, 1847

Fathers friend came back today. He seemed tired. I asked him if John came with him and he said John wouldn’t be coming anymore. I asked why and he said John went missing. I heard Sarah say that the man by the woods took him. I hope that’s not true. I don’t think that man would be nice.


July 23rd, 1847

I went to town with father today. We picked up some chicken feed and some seeds for the fields. On the way back to the house I saw these two people standing along the road. They didn’t look right. I asked father what was wrong with them and he said their just not from here. He said they must be Irish. I don’t think Iv ever met an Irish person before. 


July 26th, 1847

Something’s wrong with the cows. They keep mooing and screaming all night. I watched father with his lantern out the window as he want to check. They were all looking at the woods. Father says he’s gonna see if someone can help them. I hope they ok.


July 27th, 1847

I think I saw the man by the woods. I was helping fix the fence when I heard the trees moving near by. I looked up and saw this person standing by one a little ways away. He just looked at me and I looked back. Father called me and I answered him. When I looked back the man was gone. He kinda looked like those Irish people I saw by town. I hope that’s not who Sarah saw, he looked weird.


He drew a more detailed picture of the man from before. He seems to be wearing a button down with some kind of overalls. His face is very odd. The eyes are far apart but not level with each other. He didn’t seem to draw a nose or ears. The hair was very far back on the man’s head it seems. He just gave him a straight line for a mouth. 


July 30th, 1847

Someone came by for the cows. He said they must be spooked by something in the woods. He suggested we move them somewhere else but fathers not sure about that. I don’t think it would matter where we move them, I think they’ll still be scared.


August 4th, 1847

Two of the cows went missing last night. Fathers not sure what happened. The fence isn’t broken and there wasn’t any blood on the ground. Me and Sarah were in the front of the house when she told me what happened to them. She said they stood up and walked away. I asked how did they do that if the fence is too tall. She said they stood on they back legs and walked over it. I told her she’s acting silly and she started getting mad and told me she wasn’t lying. I hope she is. 


August 10th, 1847

We found the two cows. They were dead in the woods by the fence. Looked like they were making they way back from the woods. They had teeth marks all over they bodies. They also looked like the cow father put down a few weeks ago. I think one looked at me before it passed. It had very human eyes. Father didn’t say anything about that but I think he noticed. 

He drew another much more detailed picture of the cow. It again has no defining cow traits besides the shape of it. The ears are very small and almost pointed upwards. The face is very human like. The snout is pushed in with human like lips under the nose. The eyes are more smaller and like he said are human like. He also drew the teeth marks on the bodies and they look like human teeth.


August 13th, 1847

Mother told me to not let Sarah near the woods anymore. She told me she saw a shape walking along the fence while Sarah was in the garden. I asked what the shape was and she said it looked like a person. I’m gonna pray tonight. I think we need someone to watch us.

August 14th, 1847

The cows are screaming again. I looked out the window and squinted to see anything. It was too dark but I have a feeling something’s out there with them. I hope they ok.


August 18th, 1847

Saw more of those Irish people by town. They just stood along the road heading in and were they again when we left. I wonder if they can’t find anyplace to stay. They should try going West like everyone else is, might be better that way. I think one of them looked a little like John. I’m not sure though.


August 24th, 1847

Sarah’s gone. Father saw the back door open this morning and she wasn’t in bed. Iv been looking all around the woods near our farm and I can’t find anything. Fathers just been sitting on the porch and mother won’t leave her room. I think the man in the woods got her. If he did I don’t know if she’ll come back. I hope she does. It’s lonely without her. 


August 26th, 1847

Iv been doing most of the farm work myself now. Father helps a bit but he just looks tired. Mother hasn’t left her room besides to get food or water. I noticed another cow went missing. Same way as the other two. I told father and he said it must be some kind of punishment from god. I wonder if the cow also walked on his two legs like Sarah said. I miss her.


August 30th, 1847

Sarah is home. She was sitting on the back step this morning when father went to look outside. She was all kinds of dirty and cut up but she seemed fine. Mother has been in tears all morning and father is back to his normal routine. I asked Sarah where she went and what happened. She just looked at me and said “He showed me something.” Im not sure what that means but I’m glad she’s ok.


September 2nd, 1847 

I think something’s wrong with Sarah. She keeps looking outside at night and staring at the cows. She makes this weird breathing sound when she does. I asked her this morning what was wrong and she said it was nothing. Mother said that just what young girls do. I feel like something not right about her face. Her eyes look a little off.


September 3rd, 1847

I don’t think that’s Sarah. She’s not acting right. She keeps saying these things that don’t make sense and she keeps looking off. I don’t know if mother or father notice it. Eyes aren’t right anymore and her head looks longer. Father slapped me when I raised my voice about it at lunch and sent me upstairs. Sarah’s just been watching me write for awhile now. She seems more interested than before. Like she’s trying to learn how to be more like her old self. Or trying to learn how to be her real self. I’m scared.


That is all I was able to make out today. Like I said the pages are very worse for wear and I really don’t wanna ruin them so I’m taking these nice and slow. When I’m able to get some more of the entry’s typed out I’ll post them here for you all to read. Again if you have any tips about this or suggestions let me know. Thank you.
