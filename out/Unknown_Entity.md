First I'm sorry for my English...cuz I don't speak with it like and expert ( or even write with it ) but I'll try 

My story starts in 2020 September..I was home alone and my parents...brother sister and everyone was in my grandfather's house because there was a wedding..of my uncle they already got prepared and well dressed except for me...so I decided to go back home and try to take a shower then wearing some good clothes...( to impress my crush ) ..but before that I used to check the house before I do anything...like it could be there a mouse..or something in the house that entered like from somewhere...

I'm not scared but I just do that every single time I'm alone just making sure that there's no one ..well after making sure that the house is empty..there's just me I took a shower and then I dressed up and made my self look cool but before I go to the wedding I decided to have some fun with my self so I turned off all the lights and turned on those like in purple/ blue / red color...just to feel like I'm in a disco...then I turned on the music and I started recording I recorded the first video and I shared it into whatsapp with my friends and I started recording a second video...the moment I hit play and turned right to film...suddenly 2 glowing eyes üëÄ  were looking at me directly from the stairs...infront of me..

I was like shocked but at the same time curious...at first I thought it's just a reflection of the lights but whenever I move those eyes keep following me I moved my phone in different ways just to make sure that I'm seeing those eyes and it's not just a reflection on the phone..but those eyes were real..after a while like..30 second I felt a terrible headache..

I took my second phone...stopped recording and I went to my room waiting for the headache to pass..but suddenly just fir 3 min the headache passed..when I came back I found that those eyes were gone...so I sent the video to my friends telling them about what happened..

but then..I saw some messages that freaked me out I was like ü§Øüò≥üò®...7 of my friends have replied to the first video telling that in that video...there's something sitting on the couch..and it's hard to see ..until you add more brightness to the video...when I did that I took a screenshot and then I was surprised that there was someone or something with white body and long black head sitting on the coud in a strange way...

I was speechless...I sent them the second video some of them told me maybe it's a cat...but..I wish if it was a cat...cuz first ( I was alone at home ) second ( I don't have pets ) so that thing wasn't a cat and third ( the time I was looking on it I felt that terrible headache that made me feel weird ) a cat can't make me feel that...then I just closed the door and went to the wedding trying to forget what happened...

after few months I showed the video to mom and the screenshot...and she said it's nothing  ( trying to not get scared ) but when she told me show that screenshot to your father , and I did he said : ( I see a women )..when he said that I was like shocked ü§Ø...cuz it's the same thing I said to my self and not just that...but when I was a child...like 7 years old maybe..I've seen a women in my grandfather's house..( I wasn't the only one that have seen this women ..but my uncle too )

From that day till now...strange thing keeps happening..I wish if I could post the video here and also the screenshot just to help me to find an explanation about what are they...


And again sorry for my bad English..ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è..
