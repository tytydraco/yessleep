Even with time to mentally prepare, walking up to my old childhood home was difficult. My mother was proud of it. For a short while, I had a somewhat normal life. I went to school with kids my age, nearly graduated, and was able to hang out with normal people in a small, quiet town. She still had supernatural friends come over, but they didn’t get in the way of seeing what kind of life we could have had.  

Then she got sick.  

August refused to take no for an answer. He walked beside me as we took the long driveway up to the old house. It was now left abandoned and forgotten. I tried to focus on his footsteps instead of the ringing that echoed through my brain.   

The memory of the last time I had spoken to my mother came back so clearly that I might as well be reliving it.  

I forgot my cellphone at the house and heard it ring on the other side of the door. Fumbling with the lock, I went inside to pick it up, hearing her voice on the other end.  

“Hey, where are you? At the hospital?” I asked her after I answered.  

There was a very long silence on the other end. I knew she was sick, and she started to get weaker by the day. Back then, I was naive. I assumed magic could fix everything. That she just needed the proper treatments. Her dying did cross my mind, but it never felt real until that moment.  

“Are you going to hate me after what I tell you?” She sounded so much older than the last time I saw her.  

I shook my head before I realized she couldn't see me.  

“I could never hate you.”  

“You should. I’m doing something elfish. I’m... not coming back. I won’t get better. I just  can’t let you see me wither away to nothing.” She replied, sounding oddly calm.  

A lump formed in my throat that made it hard to speak.  

“I can handle that-” I started, but she cut me off.  

“I’ve seen someone I love die. I'm not putting you through that. I know you’re strong, but I made the choice that our last memory will be a happy one.”  

I wanted to yell and scream and demand she come back home. That she wasn’t going to die, and everything was going to be alright. Taking a deep breath, I nodded again, more to ground myself than an answer for her.  

“I love you.” I told her, unsure of what else to say.  

“I love you so much. I’m so glad I was able to have you.”  

I paused, August next to me, and my hand on the door handle. He didn’t rush me or comment on why my eyes suddenly grew wet. I’d forgotten her last words. She didn’t regret any of her choices, no matter how poor some of them might have been. In the end, she was happy with her life.  

Did I forget because of the tainted magic? Or was it for another reason? Shaking my head, I needed to focus on the task at hand.  

Opening the door, I took a single step forward and fell downward. I had expected a trap but assumed one wouldn’t appear so soon. August chirped out behind me. He still had issues talking and needed time to recover. His hand swung out, grabbing midair as I fell into a darkness far away from him.   

I landed hard on dirty ground. Rolling over, I realized I ended up in the unfinished basement of the house. It had always given me nightmares. The damp concrete floor and stone walls made it feel cold all year round. The single light fixture was not enough to chase away shadows in the corners. The basement had a furnace room and a smaller room off to the side for storage. Even in my late teens, I had bad dreams about an extra hidden room sealed away that held all sorts of unknown terrors.   

Even though I disliked this place so much, it was where I had my first kiss and got to second base with the person I was dating at the time.   

Standing up, I faced someone who stole the appearance of a friend. The fake August leaned against the cold wall, half in shadow.  

“You didn’t even have the dignity to kill yourself. Should have done the world a favor.” He spat, a deep rage ready to boil over.  

“Who are you?” I asked them not to take the bait.  

That question was the one thing that would upset them the most. Because of the mixture in their blood, they had forgotten who they were. All identity is stolen away after changing their body to become someone else. The only thing they had left to hold onto was the hatred they held for me.  

I should have hated them back, considering everything they did. I didn’t want a fight. I just wanted to get to the bottom of who they were. Some memories started to form at the corners of my mind. Feelings I held a long time ago came back simply by being inside the dank basement.  

“I guess I need to end you myself!”  

The rage flared up as I could sense the odd, strange energy that made up the Sin that infected them. Their body shifted into a mirror of my own. As their first came down, I easily dodged it and lashed out, landing a punch directly on their left cheek that sent them back a step. The rage disappeared for a moment, and I was confused about why I would attack back.   

“That was for putting Lucas in danger and attacking the people I care about! You can do whatever you want to me, but leave them out of it!” I yelled at them as if they were a child instead of a deadly threat.  

If August had gotten hold of them, then his punishment would have been worse. A single punch was getting off easy. They scoffed at my reaction, a dark expression coming over their face.  

“Oh? And what will I get if I tell you I was the reason why your partner died? Or arranged dear little Ito to be on that last job?” The voice was cruel, trying to get under my skin.  

It worked. Rage flared up before I forced it back down. My head instantly got a throbbing migraine trying to arrange the facts. I doubted they were the cause of Ito’s death. Jayce died because we accepted a job that we were too weak to deal with. But that odd Sin power... I considered that after the creature broke apart, the pieces that infected others were connected by a hive mind. If that was the case, then maybe it was working in the shadows, causing certain events to happen. It failed, cutting off magic to this world. Ito gave up his life to protect all of us. I refused to let this person use his death to their advantage.  

“You seriously piss me off!” The voice was jagged and jumped between different tones as if they couldn’t decide on what to sound like.  

A burst of power came that forced me back. This wasn’t good at all. The Sin was taking over them. I doubted this time a good beating would be enough to take care of the problem.  

The heat coming off them stung my eyes, causing me to put my arms in front of my face, trying to shield myself. It grew so intense that the exposed flesh on my hands and face started to burn.   

I was glad that there was some sort of spell keeping August away. I needed to keep all the wrath focused on my direction. I might not be able to forgive myself if he got hurt during this. The Sin power was exploding out, heating up the small room. I doubted I could handle this, let alone August.  

All at once, the power crashed down. It took everything to push back and not to be consumed by it. A set of hands clamped down on my arms so hard I heard something snap. Due to Ito's threads, the broken bones healed right away. Colors swirled around us, and I didn’t think we were standing in the basement any longer. Our bodies were thrust into the space between worlds, the air tight in my lungs.   

The threads were trying to protect me. It sensed I was in a dangerous spot and tried to get me away from there. All at once, I was connected to the sea of magic that flowed through them. It overtook my thoughts, making it impossible to focus on the threat at hand. The sheer amount of magic at my fingertips was overwhelming. Endless possibilities came rushing through my mind.   

I could use this power to do almost anything. Bringing back the dead was off the table, but what else? An idea appeared that I mentally wasn’t strong enough to push aside. If I just dug down deeper, reached for more magic than I could, I could change everything.   

It felt like every decision and every small action led up to this. If I wanted to, I could use this power to make every human in my world into a supernatural creature. Or the other way around. August would no longer have to suffer because Lucas wasn’t the same species. No one would suffer because they didn’t understand each other's traditions or mindset. This would take care of so much pain. No more Hunter killing innocent creatures, at least not in this world. My hand reached out as I mentally started to dig deeper, almost creating reasons to justify my choice.  

I felt a hand take my own. Suddenly, I was back inside a memory, looking at Ito the very last time. He had access to the same sea of magic and faced the same choice.  

“I don’t regret anything.”  

His last words cleared my mind. The words that I had been too hurt to remember.   

He was an Agent and died as an Agent. He decided to believe in the world as it was instead of risking everything to change it. There were some things he wished weren’t the way they are, and yet he loved the way he lived his life. That realization was enough to knock some sense into me.  

I pulled away from that power, sensing the Sin growing even angrier. It was as if it were waiting for me to take hold of the endless sea of magic. Why was it waiting? Then, things clicked.  

The Sin creature broke apart and infected others to destroy the Silver King one small piece at a time. If I were foolish enough to fight this thing with magic, I would be playing into its hands. The sea of magic appeared endless, but I knew it wasn’t. The first Silver King was dead. Supernatural creatures were living off the magic left behind and what their bodies produced. It would take ages, but that sea would someday dry up. Even using a small drop to fight against the Sin was something it was willing to create an endless amount of misery for. It infected this shapeshifter and caused them to go insane for years over this simple goal.  

It could have killed me at any moment. It played the long game. If I hadn’t still had Ito’s last wish fresh in my mind, I may have been weak enough to follow through with the greatest mistake of my life.  

Instead, I reached out, taking the creature in a tight embrace. They gave up such burning heat, I thought I would die. I could barely speak due to the intense pressure. No matter how painful this was, I needed to follow through. They were hurting in ways I couldn’t imagine. I owed them so much.  

“Who are you?” I asked again, tears stinging my eyes.  

“Shut up!” They hissed, hands pressed against my chest, unable op get away.  

“When we met, you preferred a female body.” I told them, forcing myself to remember the time we spent together.   

Things were clearing up. I wasn’t sure if it was because I was finally ready to face my past, or if the tainted magic was almost out of my system.  

“Who cares! That doesn’t matter! Hurry up and fight me! I killed your partner!” The words came out almost desperate.   

I could see how confused they were and how much they were hurting. I still refused to let them go a second time.  

“You loved gross food combinations like cereal and soda in the morning. Which was good because my mother couldn’t cook.”  

They pushed against my chest harder, not wanting to listen to any of this.  

“I’m a monster! I’ve killed people! You’re a part of a Hunter family! I’ve made you suffer for years! Stop being stupid and fight!”  

Tears freely flowed from their eyes as I saw the Sin power wavering. The only way to remove it was for them to no longer feel wrathful towards me. And yet, I felt like I deserved everything they did because I wasn’t there for them when they needed it.  

“I know it’s hard to hear, but I loved you. My mother did too. I made such a horrible mistake leaving. I saw you kept changing yourself trying to fit what I wanted. I thought distance would help you become who you wanted. I never should have left you behind.”  

They hated me. That feeling was clear on their face. But they couldn’t deny that at one point we cared about each other. The emotions and half memories were too much. Their face kept shifting, trying to finally find the proper one. With cheeks red and eyes wet, a small childlike voice came from them, asking something they had wanted to for over two years.  

“Please, just kill me.” They begged.  

That was what all this was about. They were hurting and scared. They wanted it to end. The Sin power took advantage of that, but deep down, this creature just wanted an easy way out. The only comfort came from seeking out the last person who ever cared about them. In a twisted way, they thought I would end their suffering out of love if I was pushed hard enough.  

“Who are you?” This time, the question sounded more like a demand.  

“I don’t know!” The voice was scared and rough.   

Their eyes closed, and their body wanted to shrink into themselves. The only thing they knew was that I hurt them in some way and held onto that for so long. They didn’t know how to deal with the fact that I refused to lash out for what they’ve done beyond a single punch to the face.  

“Your hair was black when we met!” I needed to shout over the sounds of the power crashing around us. The Sin did not want my voice to be heard. “I wanted you to have red eyes because I thought it would be attractive!”  

A conversation we had ages ago came back. They had offered to shift their body into an ideal form for me, almost sounding scared I would leave otherwise. I started to list off features I knew they would be against.  

“Pale skin and tall. I can get you fishnets and leather chokers-” I kept going until a set of hands were pressed under my chin trying to shut my mouth.  

“I'm not going to be a god damn cringy vampire goth girlfriend! I told you that a hundred times! Stop teasing me because I hate those stupid kinds of books!” She snapped back.  

The answer didn’t fit the situation, but when she first said those words, it had. She loved to read and was frustrated over how most of the vampire books had poorly written romances with what she claimed to be fake goths. She loved the fashion trend, respected it, but wouldn’t wear those kinds of clothing herself.   

After years of not knowing who she was, her appearance came back. She looked the same as when we last met. Long black hair with a slight tan. Teeth are perfect aside from one crooked one on the top row. A larger nose than some would find attractive. Small hands yet with long fingers. Even though she had the power to change her body, each slight imperfection felt comfortable to her.  

“It’s nice to see you again, Felix.”  

The name she hadn’t heard in so long hit her like a truck. The Wrath she held onto like a lifeline was faltering.   

“Why didn’t you kill me...? I hurt you so much.” The words were a small whisper I almost didn’t hear.   

“Not as much as I hurt you.”  

I wanted to hold her and promise everything would be alright. That was a lie. We got this far, but we would need a lot of work before things were normal again. Sensing a failure of the plan, the Sin lashed out.   

We were still in the space between worlds. If I weren’t to waste magic to go against it, then it would try something else. It latched onto the threads around us, trying to work its way into them, infecting each source. These threads fed magic directly into different worlds. Fear spiked through my system, dreading the outcome. If this Sin tainted the magic supply, it would be the end of all things as we knew them. Supernatural creatures would go insane, destroying everything. I watched in horror, unable to do anything to stop it.  

I reached out, pulling off as much of the odd power as I could, feeling the sickly mass slipping through my fingers. It just kept multiplying and spreading. I could feel an odd darkness blooming in my chest. Since I was connected to the main magic source, I was already feeling the Sin working its way through to it.   

My mind was racing, trying to think of anything to do to save everyone. It wasn’t just the creatures I cared about in danger, it was every human that were living a normal life unaware of the dangers seconds away from happening. My hands worked faster, failing to remove the Sin, the power almost mocking my efforts.  

Another set of hands came down, grabbing hold of the Sin, the power freezing, then straining against the grip.  

“I was only mad at Richie! How dare you make this everyone else’s problem! This is my Wrath and I'll decide what to do with it!” Felix shouted, her face twisted in a rage.  

I had loved her back when we were teens, but she had been scary when she was angry. I remember being thankful back then that rage was never pointed in my direction.  

Slowly, the sin was lifted up, the mess peeling away from the threads being taken back into Felix. At first, I was scared for her. If she kept the infection, then she would never regain her senses. But right now, she was Felix. The most stubborn person in the entire universe. If she decided that one plus one equaled three, then she would find a way to rewrite how math worked to make it that truth. Simply put, once she put her foot down, nothing could go against her.  

As she absorbed the Sin, it was broken up, turning into a normal magic source. The moment before she took hold of the last bit, we were kicked out of the space, landing hard back into the basement.  

My body hurt. No, something was wrong with it. Every inch felt prickly. My burns were healing more slowly than before, and I felt a much weaker connection to Ito’s threads. They were still there, but touching that Sin had damaged them. I doubted I would be able to heal from being ripped apart now. But I was thankful I could still feel a part of him around.  

“Are you...?” A small voice asked beside me in the dark.  

I looked Felix over, relief flooding my body knowing she was alright for now.  

“I'm sorry.” I told her.  

She shook her head with tears in her eyes.  

“I don’t... things are hazy. I don’t remember a lot of things. But I did some bad stuff, right?”  

I was glad that some of her memories when she was infected were gone. We would need to take a lot of time for her to work through the pain of the last few years.  

“It’s ok.” I started, but she kept shaking her head.  

“No, it’s not. Just because I wasn’t thinking clearly doesn’t make it better. Because of what I am, I could snap at any point again. Whatever that power was, it changed me a little, but I could have become that on my own.”  

“Yes, on your own. But you won’t be alone anymore.” I promised her.  

We would never date again, but that didn’t change the fact that I still cared about her. I stood up on a shaking pair of legs, and she fell into my arms, crying. For so long, she wanted two things. To die, or to hear that someone wasn’t going to leave her.  

“You’re too stupid. You never should be this forgiving.” She said between sobs.  

“Yeah, I’ve heard that before.” I agreed.  

The doorway at the top of the stairs opened as someone came racing down. August saw us, a person he had never seen before, crying in my arms. He raised an eyebrow with an accusing chirp.  

“Oh, things are fine. She’s sorry for setting your house on fire.” I told him.  

Felix looked up, her face pale at the realization of what she had done. August debated on what he wanted to do. With a sigh, he walked over and hugged us both. He wasn’t going to do anything to Felix for endangering his son, at least for now.  

I let her cry it out and recover enough before I pulled away. We now needed to think of what to do and how to help her. A person I dreaded seeing also appeared, soft steps coming down the wooden stairs.  

Lupa stood a few feet away, arms behind his back, with Klaus next to him. It seems I could not keep this all hidden from The Corporation. Even without considering the Sin power, Felix’s shapeshifting was a very high-demand ability. When most creatures changed their body, they either needed something from the person they were changing into or were using a spell. A spell could be seen through. Felix was doing neither of those things. Her body changed however she wanted, and she could even copy the vibe of the internal magic source the real supernatural creature had. Lupa wouldn’t want that kind of power to slip through his fingers.  

“It’s nice to see that things worked out well. Could your friend come with me? We can provide all sorts of support for her. I bet the future appears daunting to handle alone.” he suggested in an even voice.  

For a small person, he was like a solid wall of power. In a fight, he might even be almost even with Klaus. All that power was between me and the door. My healing ability had been nerfed, and it felt like my new leg was hanging on by a thread. But Lupa didn’t know any of that. I stared down the terrifying\* monster with cute rabbit ears and stood my ground.  

“No. Felix isn’t going with you.” I said sternly.  

“I believe certain things have transpired to make us think she is somewhat of a threat. We should at least have a small chat with her to-”  

“I said no. Felix is not going to hurt anyone.” I refused to back down, standing tall, using every ounce of my height to appear somewhat threatening.  

Lupa’s face faltered for a second. He was debating what to do. He wanted Felix to work for him, but that meant going against me. No, not just me. August stood next to us, blocking Felix from Lupa’s view.  

“And if she does hurt someone in the future, who will be to blame for that? I would need to take in her caretaker. It would be wise to let her come with me before that all happens.” He said, holding out a hand as if we were going to shake on a deal.  

That was a threat. If Felix lost it, he was going to bring down his entire weight at The Corporation to punish him. I felt sweat start at the back of my neck, and Felix made a small sound as if she was agreeing to go with Lupa.  

“She won’t hurt anyone. And you will not speak to my brother like that again.” August spoke up, his throat still raw from his injuries.  

Lupa narrowed his eyes in our direction. He still hadn’t confirmed if August had access to his ancestors' graves. If Lupa did anything to me, August was ready to put up a fight. He had an unknown amount of power in his hands.   

“I think I'll agree that this girl is harmless.” Klaus added in, a smile reaching his eyes, causing wrinkles.  

He sounded kind, but he was almost making a threat of his own. If Lupa wanted Felix, he had to go through me, August, and now Klaus. Not to mention any other creatures on my side. It simply wasn’t worth it.  

He let himself sigh and shake his head.  

“Well, it’s good to know she’s in the right hands.” With that, he left the basement feeling as if he had wasted his time.  

It was as if a thousand pounds were lifted off my shoulders. I wanted to sit down and took a step to find a place to do so. Something gave way, and I found myself falling forward, a few arms reaching out to catch me.  

As it turns out, I put too much stress on my body and on my new leg. It couldn’t handle what I just put it through and broke apart. It was nice while it lasted.  

I was forced to be in the clinic for the next week. A prosthetic leg had been made, and it wasn’t too bad. It would take a long while to get used to it. I wouldn’t be working any time soon.   

Evie took over watching Felix. She had begged to have a collar placed on her to restrict her actions in case she lost herself again. Evie agreed and was letting Felix stay at her place for now. A lot of people were upset with her, but all of them refused to show it. I’d forgiven her, so they needed to do the same. I hated the collar idea, but if it made Felix feel safer, then I wouldn’t go against it.  

After I got out of the clinic, August moved me into his place. It had been repaired since the fire. He was aware that Felix would need to come by and wasn’t sure how to deal with her just yet. It seemed unfair to Lucas to have a person who could have killed him so over so soon. We decided to ask the boy how he felt about leaving certain details out.   

We told him the person who set the fire did so because they were upset with me. We have talked it all out, they were very sorry, and such a thing will never happen again. I would like to see them and help them through their issues, but we would understand if Lucas didn’t want them around. The boy listened, nodding his head, and gave his answer.  

“Ok, I’ll forgive them.” He said, then narrowed his eyes in a way that sent a chill down my spine. “Once.”  

I started to dread that he was taking after his father too much.  

When she was emotionally ready, Felix came over. I was walking up and down the front path using crutches to regain some strength.  

“Are you sure it’s ok to see me again? After everything?” She asked, matching my pace and keeping her eyes down at the ground.  

“I know it will take a long time to forgive yourself. If ever. But yes, I’m only angry that you hurt people I care about. I understand why you acted the way you did. But my leg was already gone. You just delayed me getting a new one, I guess.” I half shrugged,  

“Don’t downplay everything!” She snapped, face flushed red. “I stole money from you for over two years! I made you live in rags and barely eat! And then I put you through such emotional turmoil on top of that! You hurt yourself and... I shifted to look like your partner when you first were hurt to make you suffer by seeing her dead body...”  

“Oh, I forgot about the money,” I said, and she stopped in disbelief, then embarrassment.   

She looked like she wanted to say something else. I let her fidget with her shirt, giving her time to gather the courage to speak.  

“I still have it. The money you sent for the fake medical payments. I tried spending it, but I didn’t know what I wanted. And it was just... a lot. So, I let it sit in the account. I’ll give it back to you; I just wasn’t sure how to move this much.” She explained.  

That was a good thing to hear. I could try to pay back Skyler for the new leg I destroyed. With some luck, we might have some left over for a nice birthday gift for Evie.  

“How much is it?” I asked, unaware of the total amount.  

I’ve had too many other things to think about. I hadn’t bothered looking back at my accounts to add up what I’d sent over the years.  

“Sixty-four...” She started, then stopped her mouth in a thin line out of guilt.  

“Sixty-four thousand is a lot. Thank you for...” I started, but she shook her head, saying my guess was wrong.  

Was it over a hundred thousand? No, she wouldn’t have said sixty-four to start with. After a long silence, Felix broke it with a word I didn’t believe.  

“Million.”  

“What?” I asked again after a long pause.  

“A little over sixty-four million....” She said she was unable to meet my eyes.  

The world was spinning as more things clicked into place. I had saved the world a few times from some Gods. No wonder it was such a high amount. The crutches wobbled, and she carefully helped me to the ground.  

August found us with me lying in the middle of his walkway. At first, he thought I’d hurt myself. I couldn’t even speak to explain why I was so shell-shocked. After I recovered enough to move, the next few hours were spent making calls and arranging certain things.  

April was still collared, but due to the goodwill I had built up and the sudden access to so much money, that was quickly changed. She was free from her contract. If she caused any trouble, she risked being collared again, but I wasn’t worried about that. I then bought off Jacob’s contract. He was going to be put in the field soon if I hadn’t. Instead of risking his life, I got him transferred to a greenhouse to help grow medical herbs. He was still a risk to certain people around him. They were going to keep a close eye on him. For now, he was happy despite the fact that he had been turned into a monster.  

After all of that was sorted, I needed to talk to Felix and ask her something. I assured her I wasn’t angry over what she did when I first lost my leg. She was the one who found me and attached the other one. She took that chance to place the cursed one on and then nursed me back from the brink of death. Since she had been there after the failed job, she might know the answer to a question I was too scared to even think about for so long.  

“Did you see Jayce’s body?” I asked in a gentle tone.  

Her eyes grew wet with tears, and she shook her head.   

“You need to know something...” She spoke softly on the verge of another crying fit.  

After a small conversation, I had a few more phone calls to make. Then, a few days later, I found myself walking up a steep pathway on the side of a mountain. The view was breathtaking, and yet I wasn’t there for that. A small cabin sat on the green, flower-filled hill. A caretaker met me at the doorway and offered to help me walk over the uneven stone flooring. I was fine even with a single crutch. The caretaker led me to the back room with a large open window. The scented air caused a set of lace curtains to flow.  

Carefully, I sat next to the person inside, my hip screaming in pain. We sat for a long time just staring at the clouds drifting between the mountain range.   

“I’m sorry...” She sounded almost like a child.  

Glancing down, I saw a fake ankle peeking out from her pant leg next to mine.  

“We match.” I joked, smiling.  

She turned her face toward mine, silent tears staining a scarred face. Blonde hair poorly hid the long-healed cuts. Her tattered arm lay almost useless in her lap.   

“You’re so fucking annoying, you know that right? I wish you could have just been angry at me.” She said with a mixture of anger and sadness.  

“I love you, how could I ever be upset with you.” I answered back.  

Losing her had hurt too much. Since it happened, I couldn't even think of her name without it feeling like my body would break apart. When I did, I would offer whatever higher power that may be listening to take anything from me to bring her back. I didn’t want to see her again if that was the cost. Only for her to be happy. And now she was sitting next to me.  

“I swear I was going to call you, I just...” Jayce stumbled over her words. She didn’t need to explain anything to me. I let her go on. “I was scared...” She admitted and felt disgusted with herself. “I was barely alive and inside a human hospital. By the time they found me, it was too late for decent replacement limbs. I could have gone back to Contract Work, but... I just kept thinking of the pain. Of how close I came to dying. To how you almost died, and I was so damn scared. I took the easy way out and asked them to say I died. I really was going to call you, explain things. Any time I was going to dial your number, all that pain and fear came back. I’m not as strong as you.”  

Closing my eyes, I leaned back on the old wooden chair. I hadn’t really tried to look for her. After all, I saw her dead body. Why would I think she was alive?   

“I’m not strong. Just stupid.” I told her and felt a small shove against my arm.  

“I love you.” I told her again.  

“I'm sorry. I do too, but not in the same way.” It was the same answer she gave me a few years ago.  

I was glad that not even guilt could make her change her mind and do something she wasn’t comfortable with.  

My phone buzzed. I took it out and glanced at the message. August wanted to know when I would be back. Today was Evie’s birthday party, and he was going to be grilling dinner for everyone.  

“Is that kid yours?” Jayce leaned almost into my lap to get a better look at the photo of Lucas I had as my home screen.  

“What? No. I’m just the weird uncle.” I explained.  

Her tears had dried up, and she raised an eyebrow.  

“You don’t have any siblings,” she corrected.  

“No blood siblings. I’ve met some people since you’ve been gone. They’re my family and have put up with me for the past year. We're having a get-together today, do you want-”  

“Yes!” She butted in before I could finish my question.  

Meeting the people who were important to me would help her get past the painful memories of our last encounter.   

I smiled, wanting nothing more than to hug her. It took a while for us to hobble through her small cabin. She appeared nervous over the fact that I could now make magic doorways to get around. When we worked together, my eyesight hadn’t been as strong. I decided to hold off telling her about most of what happened since she had been away.  

When we arrived, I introduced her to April and Evie. Cameron was sitting at one of the tables, and she quickly got up to see the newcomer. I was a bit worried about Jayce not being able to handle so many people. But she instantly got along well with all the girls. Felix came out carrying dishes, and August took over so she could sit down and meet my old partner. None of them were aware of everything Felix had done to me. I knew if Jayce found out, there might be a small fight. I would rather them be friends, so my lips were sealed.  

I sat on a plastic chair watching them and then saw April leave the chattering group to play with Lucas. It was warm out, and the air smelled of fresh grass.  

August placed a hand on my back and offered a can of cold soda. I thanked him while looking at a peaceful scene. I had gone through a lot of horrors to get here.  

‘I don’t regret anything.’ Ito’s final words range through my head.  

He was right. Neither of us regretted a thing.  

“I... don’t really approve of you turning Lucas’s aunt and uncle into puppets. In fact, I was a bit scared of you.” I said to August.   

What he did had been weighing on my mind for a while. The human puppets weren’t here today. I know August would kill them when he stopped needing them, and to avoid Lucas ever finding out the truth. He gave me a dimpled smile and didn’t take his hand off my shoulder.  

“I know.”  

I’d forgiven a lot of people lately for a ton of horrible things. He knew I still loved him, no matter what kind of monster he was.  

Smiling back, I kept an eye on Lucas. He had opened a lot since August took him in. The boy was happy, and it was what we all wanted.   

They had a game where April would chase him around. To avoid being caught, Lucas would turn around and roar at her. She would sometimes roar back. This time, they got into a small contest on who could make the scariest noise. The issue was that April didn’t like losing. Her mask slipped, and my body froze when her hands became claws and her voice sounded inhuman. We had worked so hard to ensure Lucas didn’t know his family wasn’t human. And she just slipped up.  

Instead of getting scared, Lucas matched her energy. His eyes appeared darker for a brief moment, and his nails turned into claws, and he rasped out an inhuman sound. It was only a second, but we all saw the change.  

August was stock still. Everyone stopped speaking. Lucas noticed his mistake, panic coming over his face.   

Squinting, I looked at him, trying to see anything off. When it came to half breeds, sometimes if they were raised by humans, it suppressed their supernatural nature. When they start hanging around creatures, those features can appear again. Lucas didn’t have enough internal magic for him to be a half breed. He only had a slightly larger amount than a normal human. There was some kind of creature in his bloodline. And if it finally showed itself.  

The boy’s face turned into an expression of fear, realizing what he’d just done.   

“I’m sorry. Don’t... don’t get rid of me! I won't ever show my scary face again!” He started to sob.  

August practically flew to him. He slid on his knees and scooped the boy up into a tight hug, holding back laughter and sobs at the same time. He kept telling Lucas how everything was ok. That he was perfect the way he was, and he would never let him go.  

Soon, the rest of them crowded around the child, saying the same thing. I stayed sitting, watching them, waiting until it died down to see Lucas.  

A pain came back to my hip. I would not be able to go back to work any time soon. Looking over everyone, I decided this kind of retirement was perfectly fine.   

Though someday I’ll go back to work. This time with people supporting me. No matter how hard I tried to run away from it, deep down I’m just a Contract Worker.
