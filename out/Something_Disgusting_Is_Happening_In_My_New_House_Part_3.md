(Part  2: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1onlec8/something\_disgusting\_is\_happening\_in\_my\_new\_house/)

Today is my first day back to the house after Jason’s disappearance. I was honestly shocked to see that upon walking in, the place is spotless. With everything I’ve been through, the last week has been such a system shock, I actually forgot to tell my landlord anything about what happened. But it makes sense that the police would have contacted him. The hours that morphed into the last 5 days have all been a blur. At the risk of monotony, I’ll skip over the police escort to the station and subsequent hours of in-depth questioning by detectives. I was given the opportunity to drive myself but my car was still out for the count. I began to feel ill; I wanted to hurl in the back of the police car.

Jason's parents, who we later learned were the ones who called his phone when we found it in that filth, were notified of his disappearance. From what the detectives told me, they were devastated. Somehow I feel responsible. I fear that they blame me for his fate. And under the circumstances, it would only be reasonable to blame the one and only person Jason was last with. I was given the opportunity to speak to them over the phone at the station, but I couldn’t bring myself to. I don’t know if that makes me a coward. 

The detectives let me go as there was no evidence actually tying me to whatever happened to Jason. But they told me under no circumstances was I to leave the county. Because I couldn't return home I was forced to either find a hotel or ask someone to allow me to stay with them. I didn’t have any family in the immediate area so my choices were slim. So I decided to call John. 

John is a good guy. A strange guy, but still good. I met him over Facebook about two years ago and we kind of just hit it off. I’ve been to his house a couple of times in the past, but not recently. Met his wife, she’s the hippie type, dreads, circle-brimmed glasses and a very chill vibe. They both are obsessed with mushrooms, both functional and psychedelic to the point that they have a monotub in their garage. Beyond being a fungus-obsessed weirdo, he also happens to be one of the smartest guys I know, with a job title to match his IQ and fungal interests: agricultural mycologist.

But if it wasn’t for him, I wouldn’t have found the house I’m in now. He actually sent me the listing for it over Facebook Messenger because he knew I was looking for a place to call my own that wasn’t a cramped apartment. So for that I’m grateful.

When I called him from outside the police station and explained what happened, he was of course shocked. John and Jason were mutual friends through me, so they weren’t particularly close. Nonetheless, he was upset by the news, at least at first. From explaining how I found Jason gone to my panicked 911 call and then being questioned, John was tracking with me. I could feel his grief and shock palpably through the phone. However, he got really hung up on the black ooze when I mentioned it only briefly. In fact when I brought it up, his tone shifted from grief to a near inappropriate amount of intrigue.

“So, tell me more about the stuff you found in your living room,” he said, almost excitedly.

I felt a little uncomfortable and hesitated to go into more detail. I found it to be in poor taste that he sounded this curious over the disgusting stuff rather than focusing on our missing friend.

“Uh, I mean it was black, and it had like roots or veins or something like that in it,” I said.

“Did it look dry and fuzzy? Or like wet and viscous, like jello?” he followed up quickly.

I had a quick flashback to my nightmare and I gagged at the thought. The nausea I felt before boiled up again in my stomach. “Oh, God, I don’t know, man. Like jello I guess.”

“What about the smell, how did it smell?” he said, nearly manic now.

“Listen, I know that stuff like this doesn’t really gross you out because you work with nasty shit all the time. But I really don’t want to think about it right now,” I said, fully wanting to get off the phone at this point. I contemplated not asking to stay at his house at all. 

“Ah, I’m sorry, Mark,” he said, like someone says when they’re caught flirting. “I got a little carried away.”

There was an awkward pause in the conversation after that. I felt like he was about to say goodbye when I finally spoke up.

“Well, the last thing I want to do is inconvenience you,” I began. In a fraction of a second I had a debate with myself whether I should ask to stay with him or not. “But while my house is still a crime scene, I can’t really go back there right now. I hate to ask this, but would it be okay if you gave me a ride to a hotel? My car’s being a POS right now.” The words flowed out of my mouth, but I felt strangely relieved to say them.

There was another awkward pause and then,

“Yeah, I can do that,” he said. I was relieved to hear that. “But I’m going to need some gas money.” And the feeling of relief fled me like a cat from water. “Really?” I thought. But I nevertheless agreed.

We exchanged a couple more words before ending the call. He swung by to pick me up about a half hour later. I hopped into his car and he immediately surprised me by reaching back behind his seat and pulling out a backpack. He handed it to me and explained that he felt bad that I couldn’t go home to collect my things. So he had quickly packed a “go bag” for me. He told me it had two changes of clothes, some basic hygiene supplies and even some snacks. I was really touched by the gesture and before we got to the hotel that would end up being my home for four days, we stopped for lunch at the nearest fast food joint. I tried to eat, but I could hardly bring myself to. I was starting to feel ill, my stomach was upset. I chalked it up to my grief making itself known or my adrenaline finally coming down. 

The hotel room was cozy yet sterile. I plopped the bag John gave me on the bed and I decided to take a shower. I stayed in the shower for a long time, just letting the hot water run over me mulling over the last 24 hours. Suddenly, I felt my stomach churn. My intestines felt like they were twisting inside me and I buckled over in pain. A flash of nausea started in my stomach and spread throughout my entire body, leading to my throat. The hot water turned from a source of comfort to now unbearable overstimulation. My mouth reluctantly opened, like the jaws of a dog being pried open by its owner, and I began to heave. My lunch came up first, pieces of ground beef and bread soaked in a sickly dark-colored bile. Then, I heaved again, my whole body tensed and my stomach cramped, feeling like it would collapse in on itself. The echoes of my uncontrollable moans reverberated off the tight shower walls. A black liquid poured out of my mouth accompanied by pale strands of unknown origin. Their texture was that of a network of soft roots or a tangle of undercooked spaghetti. They slowly inched up my esophagus and out my mouth. A bulk of them got caught in my throat as my body desperately tried to expel them with each contraction of my core. The veins dangled from my mouth and I knew that I had to do something to get them out of me. So I wrapped my hands around them and pulled. The feeling was terrible; I had nothing left to puke as I dry heaved and gagged at the sensation of the slimy strands sliding out my throat. I felt as though this torture would never end and I continued to pull inch by inch out of me. Finally, it all came out and hit the shower floor with a disgusting limp slap. 

I stayed in my hunched-over position for a long moment, catching my breath. The water washed away much of the black bile, leaving behind chunks of undigested food and the curled-up snake-shaped mass I had just pulled out of my stomach. It had to have been at least two feet long. Two feet of tangled mess, two feet of who knows what, from where, inside me. My panic subsided and I started to shake. After watching the particles of burger and bun wash away and down the drain I left the shower, collapsing onto my bed, still wet. Without thinking of calling for an ambulance, my exhausted body fell into a long undisturbed sleep. When I finally woke up, the sun had gone down. I grabbed my phone and checked the time: 8:30 pm. I slept for nearly 8 hours straight. I got up and went into the bathroom. I cautiously peeked my head into the shower and saw nothing. It was gone. The strands I had thought I had pulled out of my mouth had disappeared. Was this all another nightmare? Had I just fallen asleep after a normal shower and dreamed up the rest? I desperately wanted that to be the answer, so I convinced myself that it was. I mean, I felt way better than before, no nausea or weakness and my appetite had returned tenfold.

I pilfered through John’s “go bag” searching for the food he claimed to have put in it. I found nothing but clothes and a piece of folded-up paper in one of its side pockets. At this point I was sufficiently annoyed with him. I placed the paper on the bed and took the clothes out. After I got dressed I snatched up the trifolded paper and lifted the first fold. It was a printout from a pharmacy with John’s wife’s name on the top. Below her name I saw the name of the medication, “Gemzar”. I googled Gemzar and the search result floored me. It was a chemotherapy medication for advanced breast cancer. I was flooded with a mix of emotions. I felt like I had invaded their privacy and I was angry at myself for ever being mad at John. And I felt an immense amount of pity for him and his wife. I just laid down and stared up at the ceiling. I had a lot of time to think in my hotel room. About Jason, where he might be, what might have happened to him. About John and his life, how hard and hectic it must be.  The five days went by without any more strangeness. I received a call from the detective informing me that they hadn’t found Jason. 

“Search and Rescue had lost his trail about a quarter of a mile away from your house,” he said. I could hear the bafflement in his voice. “At this stage, we’ll keep the case open, but there really isn’t much more we can do. I’m sorry Mark, I know this must feel all so overwhelming,” he said, attempting to sympathize with me. The only prints they found of the broken plates and in the living room relating to the struggle were his own. 

“What about the black stuff? In my living room and outside?” I asked.

“Yeah, that’s a mystery to just about everybody at this point,” he said. “Forensics took samples of it and, while it might take a while to hear anything conclusive, we’re trying to get to the bottom of it. But, you’re free to return home.”

I didn’t feel relieved. I wanted answers. I stayed at the hotel last night. I didn’t need to, but I wanted to. It was a small escape from the reality of my missing friend. I took an Uber this morning to my house; I didn’t feel like asking John. Our last interaction was weird and I just wanted to respect his space. He was clearly dealing with his wife and maintaining their privacy must be hard, I didn’t want to invade more than I already had. 

Like I said, my house is spotless. There was a SERVPRO business card left on my kitchen counter with the slogan “Like it never even happened” printed in bold. The sludge is gone—well actually the whole rug it was on is missing, but that’s alright with me. Oddly, that mildewy smell is back, but just as faint, I’ve just accepted it’s part of the house now. The broken dishes and strewn about utensils are either gone or put away. My house looks just about how it was when I first settled in. The only thing that’s bothering me now are Jason, or that lacking of him rather, and my landlord's response after I texted him, thanking him for hiring a cleaning crew. He got back to me a minute ago. His message says, “What are you talking about? I didn’t hire a crew to clean your house.” Now he’s calling me.
