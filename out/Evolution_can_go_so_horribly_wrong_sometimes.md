When I tell people what a day at work is like for a pharmaceutical researcher such as myself, I receive a look somewhere on the spectrum of mild discomfort to full blown disgust. It’s not glamorous but sorting through rat droppings to determine the efficacy of the newest laxative is what pays my bills. So, yeah… I’m great fun at parties.

Don’t get me wrong, I believe in the grunt work that forms the basis of good science, but to say it hasn’t dulled my passion for science to some degree would be a lie. So, when I got headhunted for a position in a new lab testing a new drug that the recruiter wouldn’t tell me about without my signature on about a dozen NDAs, I jumped on the opportunity.

With the benefit of hindsight, I can see the red flags now. I think the recruiter could see the gears turning in my head to sound the alarm and had the perfect wrench to throw in: a sign-on bonus check with a jaw dropping number of zeroes. I’m human first, a scientist second, and a guys gotta eat.

Speaking of priorities. I can’t even fathom the consequences I’ll face for breaking those NDAs, but I have to let as many people know about what I saw as I can. First, let me give you some background before I talk about the drug they had me working on.

I’m not sure if they wanted to keep it hush hush, but the dozens of black suits that flowed in and out of the lab made it clear the place had deep ties to the government. Which government? I’d guess… all of them… due to the number of different languages I heard in hushed whispers around every corner.

So, what could bring all these governments together and inspire a level of cooperation rivaling what it took to build the internation space station? Well, we, as a species, are fucked.

Despite being a scientist, I still don’t have any more refined words with which to convey the situation we’re collectively in. Rising temperatures, rising sea levels, rising pollution, rising risk of nuclear conflict. We’re in a bad way. As much as some politicians will bluster about how “things are just fine” and “scientists just want to scare you”, the people behind the scenes, the ones who have their hands on the real levers of power, know action must be taken.

I’m not sure how many years of failed attempts at policy change and bribes it took for them to realize they needed to be more direct in their approach, but it was full steam ahead on their current plan when I joined the team.

When I said they brought me in to work on a drug, that wasn’t quite accurate. It’s a virus. A virus built from scratch with one express purpose: the acceleration of human evolution. If we can’t stop the world from turning into a pool of shit then we might as well learn how to swim, right?

Humans need to evolve if we want to survive the world we’re creating for ourselves and good ol’ mother nature works on a timeframe that just doesn’t cut it. I won’t bore you with the minutia of how this research was carried out, so I’ll give you the SparkNotes version.

For any useful data on the efficacy of this virus we had to make sure our subjects came from every corner of our deeply sick world. Whether it was pollution or water scarcity or any other hardship, we needed to know how the virus would adapt a subject to survive an environmental adversity.

I know what you’re thinking. Who in their right mind would agree to be infected with an experimental virus that may forever change them at the genetic level? Well, the answer is quite simple.

People who don’t know.

I’ll take all your condemnation now.

We don’t have the time to source people who are desperate enough for a paycheck to forever alter their bodies in the name of science. Our situation is that dire. So, researchers like me are paired with poor saps from all over the globe to monitor what changes the virus deemed fit to make.

The subject I was paired with was identified by a lengthy string of characters to ensure no familiarity was fostered between researcher and researched, but for the sake of this story we’ll call her Lucy. Lucy was about as white bread as they come. She didn’t originate from a corner of the world contending with the fallout of our rampant abuse of the planet. No, she hailed from middle America. Any good study needs something at least approaching a control group.

Since we needed to see what the virus would do to hosts living in the real world, we couldn’t lock our subjects up in white cells and keep them under the microscope constantly. No, they went right back to their lives after getting injected with what they thought was the next generation of flu vaccine or hair loss prevention or whatever lie was spun up that day.

So, the arrangement was as follows. I flew out to have a checkup and do extensive testing with Lucy every 3 months and she had a number to call at any time to report any symptoms directly to me. And for months there was… nothing. All our checkups were as dull as a yearly physical. No sudden resistance to UV radiation, no enhanced immune system, not even something as mundane as a slightly increased bone density. The phone never rang with her reporting that she was suddenly able to fly, either.

After about a year of no discernible changes in Lucy, I had accepted that this new job was just as mundane as my previous and I might as well kick back and enjoy the absurd money they were paying me to do it. All that changed when the phone rang on an unassuming Tuesday afternoon.

“Um, hello? Is this Agnostos Pharmaceuticals?” asked Lucy, referring to one of the many shell companies created to carry out our business.

“Hi, yes this is Alan,” I replied with my pseudonym, “Lucy, right? How are you doing?”

“I’m doing fine, I guess, but uh… I’m supposed to call this number if I experience anything strange, right?” I could detect the slightest of trembles in her voice.

“That’s right,” I picked up a pen and notepad ready to finally do some science, “what have you been experiencing?”

“Well, it’s such a small thing that I wasn’t sure if I was really feeling it, but there’s this… fuzziness? Behind my eyes and inside my ears.”

I stopped scribbling my notes when she said that. Fuzziness? Not the x-ray vision or super hearing I was hoping she would say. A lot of the other researchers were reporting findings like advanced regeneration of lung cells in some subjects living in areas with dismal air quality or slightly reduced need for water intake in areas facing drought. This certainly wasn’t as flashy as those results, but still worth checking out.

“Well Lucy, I can’t test for anything over the phone so how about we move up our scheduled checkup and I’ll fly over there in a week?” I said as I was already drafting an email to logistics for travel arrangements.

“Yeah, sure, that sounds good.”

“Great, we’ll be in touch with a time and place soon, bye now.”

I hung up the phone and began to mull over what kind of change the virus could be affecting to cause those symptoms. I reminded myself that it could very well be nothing. God, I wish it could’ve just been nothing.

A week later I was in Lucy’s hometown. A rundown assortment of brick-and-mortar buildings that had blown past being forgotten about 20 years ago. The silent suit that was driving me pulled up to what could’ve been a dentist’s office ages ago, but now it was just one of thousands of shells the organization rents to carry out checkups like this.

The suit and I strode into the building, me carrying a duffle bag packed full of top-of-the-line portable testing equipment that could tell me anything I wanted to know about someone’s body in mere minutes. With a sweep of one that looked like a metal detector I could get a full body MRI with higher resolution than anything else on the market. Speaking of which, all this equipment is highly classified and won’t hit the market for decades.

As fancy as my toys were, they proved almost useless as I couldn’t find a single thing out of sorts in Lucy’s anatomy or physiology. That isn’t to say that Lucy was well, because she absolutely wasn’t.

She looked as if she hadn’t slept once since our conversation on the phone. Moreover, the young woman looked as if he had aged a decade since our last meetup about 2 months prior.

“Lucy… when’s the last time you ate?” I asked her with my best doctor’s voice.

She didn’t seem to hear me and continued to rock back and forth while seated on the exam table. The tips of her fingers were raw from chewing her nails which she did incessantly throughout the exams I performed on her.

“Lucy can you hea-“

Lucy’s gaze suddenly fixed on me with manic intensity, “yes, yes I-I-I hear you…” she stammered out.

I swallowed uncomfortably, something about this small woman’s attention instilled a disquieting feeling. As if the one truly being examined was me. That she could see through to my core better than any modern medical imaging.

“Are you still feeling that fuzziness, Lucy?”

She nodded violently as she twisted a lock of greasy and thinning hair in her fingers and pulled down on it till I could see her scalp begin to relent and move away from her skull.

“It-It-It-It-“ she cocked her head to the side violently as if she had felt a phantom spider crawling on her neck, “it’s more now, I’ve been hearing and …seeing more now.”

I involuntarily turned till I could see the door behind me, my lizard brain plotting my escape route. Just as quickly, I internally admonished myself. This woman was unwell, not dangerous. Besides, the suit waiting outside the exam room was armed, like they all were.

“What kind of things have you been hearing and seeing?”

“I… don’t-don’t know… I think they know I see them and stay just out of view… just to the side,” Lucy’s eye darted around the room.

I wrote down what she was saying but was careful to never take my eyes off her for too long.

“I only heard them at first… they-they-they get so close, but all I’d see, only for a moment, was a ha-ha-hand with so, so many fingers reaching under the door or long hair sliding along the floor and around a corner,” Lucy was crying now, both her hands rested on her head as she dug her ruined fingernails into her scalp.

I set my pen and notebook down on a nearby counter, “Lucy, is there any history of mental illness in your family?”

She slammed her hands onto the exam table with frightening speed, “No, no, no! I’m not crazy! Everyone has said I’m imagining it, but I-I-I see them! They’ve always been there!”

She had slid off the exam table now and walked unsteadily towards me all while screaming over and over again, “They’ve always been there!”

I tried to find the words to deescalate the mental break this woman was falling headfirst into, but before I could say anything the door behind me swung open. The suit stepped in having heard the commotion. He already had his hand placed over his holster. As soon as he entered the room it became deathly quiet. The sudden vacuum of sound drew my attention back to Lucy.

She stared, mouth agape, at the suit that had walked in. No, that’s not quite right. She stared up and just to the right of him. Then a new sound came into the void. Something like a hoarse, wordless whisper that I quickly realized was Lucy taking in a long, excruciatingly so, breath. Then she screamed.

My ears split from the wail she let loose, and I instinctively covered my ears. The suit stepped forward and stood at my side, gun drawn, but pointing towards the ground.

“No, no, NO,” Lucy screamed, “it’s right there!” She pointed a bloodied, trembling finger to the open air behind the suit.

What happened next took place incredibly fast, so much so that I’m not sure if I remember it correctly. I turned my head to look at the place Lucy pointed to and at the same time the suit began to speak.

“Ma’am, back against the wall now! Step bac- “

The words stopped in his throat unnaturally fast, like a car hitting a massive oak tree. I turned my gaze toward the suit and saw a man whose consciousness had seemingly fled his body. The lights were on, but nobody was home. His grip went slack, and the gun clattered to the ground.

I took a step forward and turned to face the man. I know its cliché, but there was no light in his eyes, total vacancy. As I looked into his eyes, I noticed a change begin to take place. His right pupil began to shrink and shrink until it could hardly be called pinpoint all the while his left began to grow until the blue of his iris vanished entirely.

Then he fell to the ground. Not like someone fainting, but like a marionette with its strings cut in one fell swoop. I will always remember the sickening thud of his head striking the linoleum. I rushed to crouch down beside him to assess his pulse and felt nothing. My body went numb, but before I could begin to process what I had seen, a voice spoke up behind me.

“I see, I see, I see, I see, I see…” Lucy babbled this mantra as she slowly walked toward me, the pen I had left on the counter clenched in her fist.

I fell backwards in shock and pushed myself away desperately until my back found the wall. Lucy continued to walk toward me, her eyes fixed on me, but somehow still a million miles away.  I looked to my side and saw the suit’s gun and quickly grabbed for it. I leveled it at Lucy.

“St-stay back! I’ll shoot you!” I spit out, unsure if I could ever do such a thing.

Lucy continued walking till she loomed over me, still staring directly into my eyes, but also at something else entirely. After a moment that stretched into eternity, her eyes flashed with recognition as if she had just now noticed me, the trembling, crying man pointing a gun at her face.

“… you’ll see.”

Before I could even scream, Lucy’s hand plunged the pen into her left eye with a horrible squelch and immediately followed it up by stabbing out her right eye. Then she froze for a moment, eyes destroyed and the pen dripping with blood still clenched in her fist.

“Why… why…,” her voice had become frail and pleading like a scared child, “why are they still there?”

Her hand swung again, driving the pen into her carotid artery with surgical precision. A torrent of scarlet blood erupted and rained down onto me and into my open, screaming mouth. Lucy crumpled almost immediately into her rapidly growing puddle of blood.

The days since then have been a blur. I vaguely remember the response team bursting into the building, armed to the teeth. I won’t delude myself into thinking it was because I’m such a valuable asset. No, they needed to keep a lid on all this and make sure it never saw the light of day. The only thing they decided to disclose to me is that the suit died from a massive brain aneurysm. An instant, unpredictable death.

I was, of course, promptly fired. Not before signing another mountain of NDAs that was topped off with a severance payment that could pay off my mortgage and allow me to take an early retirement. How sweet of them. They told me to put all this out of my mind and enjoy the money.

But I’m still a scientist. I’ve spent countless sleepless nights thinking about what happened to Lucy. About what we did to her. I’ve come to a theory. One that I’ll never be able to test because I’m sure they’ve already dissected her into a million pieces and once they were satisfied, promptly threw her in an incinerator.

My theory is this: human senses evolved to help us navigate the immediate world around us. Our senses evolved to make sure we wouldn’t walk off a cliff or to make sure we heard the saber tooth tiger sneaking up on us. However, seeing or hearing anything beyond what we needed to stay alive would be wasted evolutionary effort. So, we see a narrow band of the spectrum of light and only hear frequencies of a certain range.

Our virus changed that for Lucy. The answer as to why the virus would affect these changes kept me awake at night for days. Until I remembered something so simple. It’s environmental pressures that guide the course of evolution. This often comes in the form of temperature changes or scarcity of a particular resource, but one of the most effective pressures to induce an evolutionary change is the presence of a predator.

A predator lurking just outside the bounds of what nature intended us to see. All to make sure that its prey would never wise up and develop the senses needed to know it was there. I think Lucy was given the terrible burden of knowing it was there.

Like I said, the powers at be want to keep a tight lid on all of this. I’m expecting for them to bring the hammer down on me, hell, even a missile launched from a drone at my house and made to look like a gas leak is probably on the table. That’d be closing the barn door after the horses have all run out though.

See, us scientists like to gossip. I’ve heard rumor of a small town in a forgotten corner of the Midwest that is currently under quarantine. They say the few hundred residents all started raving about a fuzziness behind their eyes and glimpses of something lurking just around corners.

They told me day 1 that this virus is hardcoded to not be contagious, that it was physically impossible. Well, thing is, viruses evolve too. I know this firsthand.

I feel a fuzziness behind my eyes and in my ears.
