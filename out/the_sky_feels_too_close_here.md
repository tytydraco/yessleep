Just figured I’d get this down while the internet’s still kind of working. Managed to get it running off this yellowed modem sitting on the nightstand—one of those old ones you’d expect in a high school lab back in the day. Found an ethernet cable jammed in the drawer. Plugged it in. Somehow, it worked. Reddit loaded. Everything else just hangs.

So yeah. I was still there.

Anyone ever hear of Lake Kowatcha, MI?

Tried digging for info. Nothing came up. No local website, no social media mentions, not even a Wikipedia stub. Closest thing I found was this grainy scan of a lakeside flyer from 2001 on some .net site that probably hasn’t been updated since then.

I hadn’t meant to stop. I needed gas. Every station I passed was shut or had plastic bags over the pumps. Thought I saw one lit up on a hill, but by the time I looped around, it was either gone or I missed it. Hard to tell. Roads out here play tricks on you.

That’s how I ended up at the Riverview Motor Lodge. Only place with lights on. The paint used to be baby blue, I think. Now it’s more of a flaky gray. The VACANCY sign buzzed like a wasp nest.

The sky felt off. Heavy. Like the kind of pressure you feel before a storm, only there wasn’t one.

There’s this hum in the town—low and weird, like something electrical is dying a slow death under the pavement. I didn’t notice it at first, but once I did, I couldn’t un-hear it.

Guy at the front desk didn’t ask for my name. Just handed me a room key—brass with a tag that looked like it went through a washing machine. Told me, “Settle up when you leave.” Then he kind of leaned forward and said, “Don’t let your dog stare too long. They don’t like it.”

Yeah, okay.

The room wasn’t great. Smelled damp. The comforter was itchy, almost like it was made of insulation. There was a carpet stain shaped like a boat. Bathroom had pink and green tile, the kind my grandma had. TV had rabbit ears, but it was all static. Nothing came in.

There’s a little creek out back—I opened the window just enough to hear it. The mildew smell was getting to me.

That modem? Already plugged in. Little red light blinking away. Steady rhythm. Except once—I swear it blinked wrong. Just a blip. Probably nothing.

I walked into town after that. It wasn’t dead, but it felt like someone had paused it a while ago and forgot to hit play again. A few shops open, most of them looked like they were waiting for summer. There was this place that sold bait, yarn, and vintage shirts with logos for events I’m pretty sure never happened.

One shirt in the window said:

"The Clouds Are Closer Here."

The lake’s huge. Still frozen along the edges. The docks looked like they’d splinter if you stepped on them. Sun-faded signs for jet ski rentals and pontoon tours hung crooked. Everything looked like it belonged to another decade.

I stopped at Lakefront Diner & Fuel. It’s part diner, part gas station. The place smelled like burnt toast and grease. Deb—the waitress—poured me coffee before I said a word. Told me I looked like I was “in six.”

Then she said the same line the desk guy did. Not to let my dog stare too long.

I remember raising an eyebrow and nodding at her name tag. Said something like, “You too, huh?”

She didn’t laugh. Didn’t even blink.

I asked her who “they” were. She just said, “I don’t know, but they seem to notice the dogs first,” while stirring her cup like she’d said it before.

While she was going on about how nobody ice fishes anymore, a truck rolled through the lot. Pale blue cab, clean as hell, no markings. Looked like it’d been detailed that morning. Same color as the motel’s paint, but fresh. It didn’t stop. Just rolled by slow, turned past the old radio tower, and vanished down the back road.

That tower still blinks red. Looks like it should’ve collapsed years ago. If you stand close, you can hear it humming—feels like it’s inside your jaw.

Tully was passed out when I got back to the room. Hasn’t barked once since we got here. And I’ve just been watching that modem. Still blinking.

Let me know if this rings a bell. Lake Kowatcha, the motel, the truck—anything.

I might leave tomorrow.

Just needed a night.
