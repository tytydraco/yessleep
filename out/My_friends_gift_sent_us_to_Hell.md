Matt and Chloe were the last guests to arrive at my place. Noah, Lois, and Jared had arrived nearly an hour ago. We had already cracked open a few boxes of drinks, and I assumed that the last two were gonna be a no-show. That being said, our game night was in full swing.

Chloe and Matt gestured for me to come to them in my kitchen after squeezing the humour out of Cards Against Humanity for three rounds.

"What's up?" I asked. "You guys doing alright?"

They grinned, handing me a rectangle donned in Christmas wrapping. It was immaculately wrapped.

"Merry Christmas, Marshall!" they said in unison.

"For me?" I pondered. I never expected birthday gifts from my friends, so needless to say I was a little stunned.

"Obviously!" Matt spat. "We were gonna give this to you next weekend but-"

"We felt bad for being late, so I hope this makes up for it," Chloe interjected.

"Oooo presents?" Noah cooed, poking his head over my shoulder. "You gonna open it?"

"I mean I don't really have anything to give back bu-" I stammered.

"Don't be a pussy! Open the damn present!" Noah encouraged me, aggressively.  It was all a little overwhelming, but I was grateful and a bit drunk. I gestured for them to follow me to the living room, where Lois and Jared were chatting. Their attention quickly snapped to the gift in my hands.

"Oh shit, you didn't say there was a gift exchange," Jared gasped. I shook my head.

"Nah, there isn't. Matt jumped the gun, which is great, and I wanna open it with everyone here!" I announced.

Lois locked eyes with the couple, "Is it *that* thing?"

Chloe nodded. Lois began bouncing in her seat like an excited child. I knew Lois and Chloe were nigh-inseparable best friends, so I figured she'd be in the know about what I was about to receive.

"You've had the gift in your hands for like two minutes aren't you gonna open it?" Noah laughed. All eyes were on me. Despite the surprise, I felt honoured. I felt loved.

I tore the wrapping paper off, and inside was something I was very familiar with. A book. A large book at that.

"Merry Christmas!" Matt cheered. I was entranced by what I was holding, studying the cover.

The book was a dark red, hard cover that looked quite old. It had ridges on the cover that almost resembled the pattern of a skull. I noticed it had no title on the front, nor on the spine. What's more, the book almost felt as if it was generating a small amount of heat. The more I inspected the outside, the more unsettled I got.

"Can't say I've ever had anything like this before," I said. "Thanks, guys!"

I gave Matt and Chloe a hug, still holding onto the book.

"You like to read, and you're really into that spooky shit so I figured this would be perfect for you," Chloe explained.

"The guy at the shop said it'd freak out anybody," Lois chimed in.

"Well, I'll have to check it out on my down time. I don't wanna interrupt the party we got going." I said, beginning to pace towards my room. "I'll just stick it on the ol' reliable shelf here."

"Whoa whoa, now, you gotta read some of it," Jared insisted. "Can't just put a gift away without using it!" Everyone seemed to rally behind his words. They all began chanting "read it" over and over. I love reading, it's my jam. It's also something I usually do alone.

"Screw it," I said. "Let's get it."

I sat in the centre of the couch, with everyone crowding around me. I was a teacher reading to the class. I opened the book and felt a waft of warm air hit my face. I checked to see if anyone noticed, but maybe they were too buzzed to care. The text was...almost complete gibberish. I tried my best to read along with it for the first page. We definitely had a few laughs, and nothing felt scary whatsoever.

Eventually, something unsettling came at the next page.

"Ji..nu...jo...ack..tos...hold up," I said, observing the next phrase. It was actual English.

"Upon thy next waking the gates will open."

Something felt off, but hey, this was an ominous spooky book; and it was succeeding in making me nervous. I paused, looking at everybody.

"You alright?" Noah asked me.

"That was creepy..." I could only answer. "Like actually creepy."

"Then it's a good gift, right?" Matt asked.

"Keep going if you want to, man," Jared offered, though I could tell he was somewhat nervous. "No pressure, we might be getting to the actual good part."

I gave it some thought, and eventually chalked up my nervousness to my alcohol consumption. I mean it was just a damn book. I huffed and together we kept attempting to speak through the gibberish that followed. Eventually we came upon more legible words:

"In where I'm found, thy key is given."

I felt my nerves go away, seeing everyone else so calm. The novelty of reading through gibberish was wearing off so I opted for one more page.

"And to return, thou must visit a shattered soul."

I closed the book, deciding that was enough reading for now. We wrapped up the night not long after some party games. Everyone excluding myself was getting their shoes on and I was ready to lock the door as soon as the last guest left.

"So you're still down for the theatre tomorrow?" Noah asked me. "We're all gonna be there for 6:00pm"

"Hell yeah I'll be there," I assured him. I tightly hugged each guest tightly before they departed from my apartment. I got texts from all except Chloe (who was with Matt anyway) saying that they got home safe. I cleaned up a little, fit my new, creepy book on my bookshelf, and flopped onto my bed. The thoughts of gratitude for friendship entered my mind and lulled me to sleep.

The next morning I was awoken by my apartment shaking. I jolted up, expecting everything in my room to fall down on me. The shaking subsided, and that's when I noticed something even stranger. There looked to be soot and dust particles in the air. I inhaled, it did smell like there was a fire nearby. I thought perhaps I left my window open and a nearby fire blew all it's residue into my room.

When I went to check my window to see if my window was open I realized it was pitch black outside. Did I wake up in the early hours of the morning? I shuffled around my nightstand in the dark until I found my phone. I saw the time before my phone abruptly shut down: 4:14pm! Why on earth was it pitch black out!?

I got dressed and went to turn on my lights. No power. Explains why my phone may have died, too. I presumed that something electrical caught fire and forced my apartment into a blackout. I went to the bathroom to turn on the tap. I was greeted with a black sludge spewing from the tap. I quickly shut it off. I must've been dreaming the whole thing, surely. Did that weird book give me nightmares or something? When do I wake up? That question sprung an idea into my head.

I navigated around in the dark until I found a lighter, igniting the only candle in my household. The coconut and vanilla scented candle feebly attempted to combat the smoky stench in the apartment, but I was more grateful for the light. Something caught my eye while I was pacing around the room:

The book was missing from the shelf.

"Oh, crap," I muttered to myself.

I decided I needed to get the hell out of my apartment and see where all the inconveniences were coming from. If this was a dream, maybe leaving my place was the remedy I needed to wake back up. Who knows what I'd see out there, though.

To no surprise, there was no light in the apartment building. The once quaint, warm hallway leading to the stairwell was dark and smoggy. I managed to traverse the stairwell in the dark. Once I reached the bottom of the stairs there was a glaring issue with the door to the outside. There was no real way of saying it normally.

The cover of the book had taken over the doorway to the outside. I recognized the color and ridges even in the darkness. It creaked like nails on a chalkboard. It began opening on its own, beckoning me to come outside.

"Just a dream, just a dream," I whispered to myself, hoping I was right. I jogged outside, thinking I'd  wake up breathing fresh air, and seeing the sun shine in my room.

I was wrong.

It looked like I'd stepped outside at four in the morning. The trees outside the apartment that had already lost their leaves, looked shrivelled and choked. The outside of the apartment had paint peeling from the outer siding. There didn't appear to be any fire nearby, only a thick darkness that felt like something forced nighttime to be even more absent of light.

Stars didn't shine, clouds weren't present, and the humming of vehicles humming on the highway not far from me were gone. There was only one source of "light;" red streaks that tore into the sky like an open wound. It was dim, though as my eyes adjusted I could see the hue form on my body.

I was beginning to panic, my mind would've snapped me out of this state by now. I scrambled for my car keys. I wasn't going to stick around if I could find a better place to be. Jared lived closest to me, a two minute car ride or a fifteen minute walk. I figured he'd be up.

When I looked up after snagging my keys I noticed that all the cars, including mine, were melting husks of metal. I dropped my keys and stared at the molten blob that used to be my Lexus. I'd saved for almost two years to buy it, too!

As I yelled in frustration, I heard slow footsteps from my left. I snapped my head in that direction and came across a familiar sight. My elderly neighbour, Doris, who lived a few suites down from me. She stared sheepishly at me.

"Doris! Do you see this shit? What's going on!?" I demanded. Her expression didn't change much.

"The times are always changing for the worst, aren't they?" she nonchalantly replied. It was a bit out of character but then again I also was screaming damn near at the top of my lungs.  She turned around to go back inside, and I let out a small shout at what I saw.

The whole back of her body had been cut out. I could see what was left of her brain. I could see her exposed lungs expanding and contracting in short, hurried breaths. She was moving as if nothing was the matter. I couldn't find the words, I was far too choked. Then I sprinted.

I could feel the tears of fright run down my face as I sprinted to Jared's. I was praying he was home. There was a thickness in the air that was causing me to run out of energy fast. I stopped a few times to take breathers. I noticed almost every building was decaying just like my apartment. I was fortunate that I didn't see anybody else out at this time. Considering how my neighbour was, I was grateful.

I rounded the bend towards Jared's street. I wasn't far, only one last sprint to go. Something made me halt my stride, however.

I saw two people, if I could call them that. They looked like a mid-twenties couple. Nothing freakishly off about them. The man had a buzzcut that was thoroughly blended into his beard. The woman had bright, blonde hair. They both wore dark clothing. They were on a rotting porch attached to an equally rotting house. They were ahead to my left, the next house up. 

I resisted the urge to call out to them. My intentions were simply to slink on by as if nothing happened. I quietly speed walked by, seeing them in my peripherals as I made my way closer to Jared's. 

"What is this?" I heard the man ask aloud. 

"Did you want to come inside? We just finished preparing the place," the woman chimed in.

I froze for a second, doing a quick take at them to see if they were looking at me. Indeed they were. Their eyes were uncanny, placed far too apart on their faces. Their smiles were inviting, but unsettlingly wide. 

Before I could even answer them, the man gouged out his partner's eye with his thumb. I could hear the squishing and popping from where I was. She chuckled, doing the same to him. I was paralyzed with dread as the couple literally began to tear each other's faces apart. 

Adrenaline urged me to run, and I was reaching Jared's fast. If this was a dream, I think I'd have woken up by now. 

I finally got to Jared's place. The large property was looking rough, but still graceful despite the hellish conditions. I noticed something different about his place in comparison to the others: the windows had been boarded up. That filled me with hope, perhaps he was in there. If he was fortifying the place, then that means he probably wasn't as crazy and demonic as the people I'd encountered. 

I tried the doorbell, but it had been disabled. I began frantically pounding on the door.

"Jared! Jared, are you home!?" I pleaded, hoping for a response. 

I heard something move inside the house. 

The mail slot on the door swung open and I saw the barrel of a gun poking out, striking me in the side of the head. 

"Jared! What're you doing!? It's me, Marshall!" 

"You're the fourth 'Marshall' I've seen this week! You're not fooling me!" I heard Jared's voice boom from behind the door.

This week? I'd just woken up in this nightmare and he'd been here for over a goddamn week?

"Jared, I'm unbelievably terrified, and if what you're saying is true then I'm so sorry you're in this situation!," I cried. "I've known you for almost ten years, you gotta trust me!"

There was a pause, as if Jared was thinking hard about what to say next. I slumped myself away from the door, so my close friend wouldn't blindly kill me. 

"The other ones claimed to know me too! Just leave me alone!"

Why wasn't he coming out to confront me? If I was some sort of imposter creature, wouldn't he just kill me here and now? He had a gun to my head a second ago. I thought about it, maybe he was scared. Maybe the things didn't quite know everything about him...

"Breaking up with Lizzy did a number on you! You always get extra pearls and less sugar in your bubble tea! Your favourite show is-" 

The door swung open, revealing my dear friend Jared standing with a hunting rifle. He took a few inspecting glances at me before ushering me inside. I gave him a big hug of relief, and he reciprocated. He inspected me after he closed the door.

"You said there was multiple of...me?" I asked.

  
"Almost looked like you, too," Jared sighed. "Except the faces were wrong, and one of them had missing parts of their bodies..." 

Jared shuddered at the thoughts of them. Jared had candles lit

The inside of his place stunk, a stark contrast to the pristine conditions he'd kept them in before. The candles didn't help at all. 

"Are your parents here, too?" I asked. Jared frowned. 

"In the basement, under the sheets. They're difficult to miss" 

"I'm...I'm so sorry."

"Your family, you hear from them lately?"

"Can't say I have..." I muttered. "Haven't been bothered to check in years. Moved across the country to get away from them, and in this shit-fest we're in I wanted to find you guys first."

Jared nodded in approval. 

"I think we should find the others," I declared. 

"You realize they're all on the other side of the city, right? You and I are safe here," Jared challenged. 

"But the theatre isn't," I snapped back. "Maybe they're there, they could be in trouble."

Jared pondered a little, before a lightbulb idea dawned onto him. "You remember anything from that book you read?" 

"You think it's got something to do with this situation too, hey?" I asked, partially reassured. 

"I saw it earlier...the markings and text were written all over my home and then...I was here," he explained. Similar experience to myself. 

"Upon thy next waking the gates will open," I recited. The house began shaking for a brief moment. It was as if the universe was listening to me. 

"What was the next part?" Jared asked, almost excitedly.

"In where I'm found, thy key is given..?" I kept recalling the phrases I understood. The house shook again.

"I'm gonna bring your place down if I keep talking about it," I said, nervously. "In where I'm found...hmmm."

An idea dawned on me. "You got any idea where Matt and Chloe got that book?" 

Jared nodded, "The bookstore in Lowground Mall..."

"...Which is attached to the theatre!"

With any luck, we'd be able to venture to Lowground Mall in roughly an hour and a half on foot. I fitted myself with a couple of makeshift clubs that Jared had built. Nothing had outright attacked me, yet, but I wasn't counting on everything in this plane of existence to be neutral at best. I was banking on our friend's loyalty to be unwavering, and that they'd do anything to meet us there. 

"That key had better be going through this hell to get through," I hissed, stepping outside. 

Our destination was set, the theatre attached to Lowground Mall. Plans were still on for today, it seemed.  

Jared had pocketed as much ammunition as he possibly could. He must've seen some terrible things if his first reaction was to shoot. 

"Ready?" I asked. 

"Ready," Jared answered.

We managed to get through our community without seeing any creature. It was much of the repeated destruction carried through the city. Something new was coming, however.

Wind. A squall of wind blew at Jared and I, knocking us off balance. The force nearly toppled us, as it bent away at the rotting housing and trees. It was hot, and smelled of death. I looked back at Jared to make sure he was good. After getting back upright, he confirmed he was ok. 

There was a pause, then the wind blasted us again. Something was different about this squall, however. 

Carried in the wind was a distressing yet familiar cacophony of screams:

Matt's and Chloe's.
