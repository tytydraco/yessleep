Hello again, this is an update to my previous post [previous story here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j3nu8b/has_anyone_else_been_seeing_things_after_having_a/?share_id=rBkpF12eMTJS6--gnyhNm&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&utm_source=share&utm_term=4)it has gotten worse, so much worse. I saw a lot of suggestions of postpartum psychosis and a few mothers sharing similar experiences but I don’t think this is in my head…it can’t be, not after what happened last night.

I was getting ready for bed, taking off my makeup, brushing my teeth and changing into pajamas and I caught sight of myself in the mirror. The sight made my heart ache a little bit…I looked so tired, the bags under my eyes were more defined than ever, my skin looked dry and pale, a couple angry red hills marred my cheeks and I had dry skin built up on the sides of my nose. I sighed heavily, my skin used to be so clear and bright and I hardly ever got pimples but ever since the pregnancy I hardly recognized myself.

I felt tears welling up again as I looked at my body, purplish stretch marks stretching like long cruel fingers over my stomach, my breasts appeared saggy and swollen from lactation, extra fat had made itself comfortable underneath my chin. My husband said he saw no difference and assured me that the changes to my appearance were minimal but I knew it was a lie, you’d have to be blind not to see the difference. The weight gain, the skin discoloration, the loss of shine in my hair, it was all too much to bear and I cupped my hand over my mouth to muffle the hefty sob that left my mouth, I steadied myself on the counter as I mourned my lost beauty, silent cries shaking my shoulders. 

Click. Click. Click. 

I gasped, hot tears and snot soaking my hand that still grasped my mouth, not again. Not now. Not while I was alone. I couldn’t fight this thing off by myself, no way.

Click. Click. Click. 

I could hear it coming from somewhere behind me, I squeezed my eyes shut praying that the thing would go away without me looking at it. Suddenly, a horrific odor seeped into my nose burning my nostrils. It smelled like rotting meat or spoiled milk or some god awful combination of the two, I felt my stomach churn and sour, I tasted bile in the back of my throat, it took everything in me not to throw up. 

Click. Click. Click. 

Why wouldn’t it just go away goddamnit?? Aren't I going through enough as it is? Is it not hard enough to be freshly postpartum with a recently healed perineal tear? Is it not hard enough to not recognize myself in the mirror? Not hard enough for my life to be turned upside down? Not hard enough to get no sleep and stress over my looks and worry about if my husband is going to look at me with disgust for the rest of our relationship because this isn’t the body or the woman he married? Anger burned in my chest as that infernal clicking continued over my shoulder, this damn thing keeps creeping up on me when I am vulnerable and I am sick of it. I can’t even cry in peace without something interrupting me and causing me even more strife than I’m already going through. I made up my mind to confront this vile disgusting creature, it’s not like it could hurt me if it is, in fact, a symptom of postpartum psychosis. 

I took a deep breath through my mouth, between my fingers, to avoid the rotten smell of the damn thing and prepared myself to come face to face with the wretched creature, I steeled myself and turned around, eyes wide and determined and immediately upon laying sight on it I felt all the blood drain from my face, all of my confidence and determination melted like hot wax.

Its eyes were two black punctures in it’s gray origami paper skin, blue veins flowed like rivers beneath the moist flesh, wiry hairs stuck out from the top of it’s head and lay stuck to its cheeks and forehead, it’s mouth was a thin line beneath its cavern of a nose filled with thin needle like teeth, the ends dramatically down turned into an almost sorrowful grimace. It twitched and jerked with each sour breath as it stared me down, standing there on thin long legs with joints that bent like a bird's legs and fingers with too many joints touching the floor. I was frozen with fear, it had to be real, there was no way that my brain could have conjured this up.

“Tell it to leave you alone.” My brain insisted “tell it that it’s not welcome here.”

I opened my mouth to try and form a word and tensed as the thing cocked its head, its long turkey-like neck cracking, new hot tears spilled down my cheeks as I tried to force myself to speak but only managed to let out a low, “pll…llsss..” before I could finish the word it’s hand shot up to my throat, pressing a long, thin nail to my clavicle, I winced at the pain. Its hand was so cold it burned, “please” I begged in a whisper, my throat was dry and sticky, “please…don’t” 

Suddenly, I heard soft footsteps approaching, “Elena, you alright? You’ve been in there a while” my eyes darted toward the door then back to the thing and it was gone again, without a sound it had disappeared leaving only a burning pain where it had touched me and the faint smell of rot in the air. I let out a heaving sob and fell to the floor as my husband entered the room, he rushed to my side, gathering me up in his arms, “baby what’s going on with you?” 

I wept into his shoulder, “it’s all just so much Adrian, I feel like I’m being stretched thin and it’s all just so intense, I’m so overwhelmed…” he rubbed my back and settled down on the floor with me, squeezing me tightly. 

“Amor, I think we should go see your doctor, I remember her mentioning postpartum depression and saying to come see her if you started getting really sad” he said, his voice was low and gentle and filled with concern, “I don’t want this to get worse or anything to…happen” my heart twisted a bit in my chest as I recognized the implication of his words. He was afraid that I would take my own life…and I couldn’t blame him in that fear.

I looked up at him, meeting his soft gaze, “I think you’re right…”

His brows furrowed as his tawny eyes fixed on something below my chin, “what is that?” he breathed as he pulled away enough to get a closer look at whatever it was he saw, “is that…is that a burn?” 

I felt a new rush of panic wash over me as I stood up quickly and leaned forward to look at my neck and…there it was, a round red circle staring back at me in the mirror, “what the hell…” I murmured. 

“And what is that smell…?” he mumbled as he stood up.

I don’t think this is my imagination…
