The first time it happened, I was fifteen.  My birthday had been the week before and I was still being careful of where I stepped in the new shoes my parents had gotten me.  Weaving between puddles and cracks in the sidewalk, I didn’t notice someone coming up and touching my shoulder until it was too late.

 

The touch was immediately too hot and freezing at once, cloudy waves of pain and fear rolling through me as I gasped and started to turn around to see who was hurting me so bad. 

 

Then the world blinked.  Once, twice, like a flickering television trying to decide on a station.  And then I was in Hell.

 

How badly everything smelled was the first thing that struck me.  I gagged at the thick, acidic stench pushing into my nostrils and making my eyes water.  It smelled like someone had stuffed a dead animal with rotten eggs.  Stumbling against a nearby wall, I looked around.  In some ways it looked like the street I had been on, but viewed through the lens of some terrible nightmare.  The brick wall I was leaning against was webbed with gray vines and crumbling, the sidewalk consisted of islands of worn, broken concrete.

 

And the sky…the sky was almost entirely black, even though I could tell it was daytime.  I could even see the edge of blue near the small patches of horizon I could make out between the broken skyline of buildings around me, like a giant eye was staring down at us, dilated and insane.  Nothing made any sense—I could still see even though the sky was so different, and as I started walking and looking around, it became clear that everything was off here. 

 

Sounds vibrated differently in some spots, and things moved differently in others.  It was as though reality was in the last stages of some terminal disease, its skin thin and the wounds eating through here and there.

 

That’s when I saw the first of the people.

 

Ten minutes later, I’d killed my first person, if you could still call them that.

 

I spent a year in that place, and even now I don’t know how I survived.  I found some people that were still…really people, but only a few, and most of those were still desperate and dangerous.  That place was like here in many ways, but a few years back, things had changed.

 

Something had gotten in.

 

After that, the sky went away.  Animals started dying.  People started going crazy, joining these massive death cults that roamed around, hunting other people down and torturing them to death.  When they hit a dry spell, they’d just torture and eat each other for awhile instead.  But even those weren’t the worst.  Some of the people, and a few of the animals, had started becoming something else.  Something less and more.

 

I…I don’t want to talk about that.  I can’t or I’ll lose myself again, even now.  So instead I’ll talk about how, after what seemed like an eternity but was only fourteen months, I had a dream.  In the dream I was back in this world, but not like normal.  No one could see me, and I was speeding around like a breeze blowing down the streets.

 

I was so desperately happy to be back, even if it was weird, that it took me awhile to realize that I wasn’t flying along so much as I was riding some invisible current.  It pulled me ceaselessly across miles of roads and yards and even walls that I passed through easily, eventually slowing down as I passed inside a large building that I thought I remembered.  The rows of books inside caused me to smile broadly.  This was the second floor of the public library near where I lived.

 

The current was still there, a winding invisible river that led me down one aisle and then out to an open area with several sets of tables and chairs.  There was only one person sitting there.

 

It was me.

 

I stifled a gasp as I drifted closer.  I didn’t know if he could see or hear me, but something told me to not draw any attention to myself before the time was right.  I was coming at him from the right side, but the area was well-lit, and I recognized my own face, even if this version was far cleaner and more healthy-looking than my own.

 

What was this?  It didn’t matter.  I didn’t have to understand to know what to do.  Feeling like I was pushing through the weight of water, I reached out to touch him.

 

He snapped his head toward me, eyes meeting mine for a moment.  He could see me alright, and he recognized me too.  Pushing himself back from the table, he rolled out of the chair spryly and started running away down the aisle.

 

Panic flooded me as I pushed myself forward to chase him, swimming hard with the current and trying to close the gap.  I caught a glimpse of him down one row, but then he was gone and…

 

I felt the world flicker around me briefly.  I was running out of time.

 

Forcing myself to calm down for a moment, I slowed my drift as I thought about where he’d be trying to go.  He’d try to escape the library, which meant either emergency fire door, which I hadn’t heard go off, or head down the stairs at the far end. 

 

Looking down, I dove into the floor at an angle, aiming for the bottom of the stairs leading to the first floor and the exit.  When I came out of the lower ceiling, he was only a few feet away, taking the stairs down two at a time and looking behind him.  He seemed to sense me at the last second, turning his head just as I put my hand on his chest.  The next moment…

 

It was my world again.

 

That other me was gone and I had snapped back into the place he had occupied at the bottom of the stairs.  I let out a little sob, reaching out to touch the banister and a little display of books on a nearby table, just wanting to make sure everything was real.  I saw a girl shelving books giving me an odd look, so I ducked my head and started to walk out.

 

Then a thought stopped me.  Why had he been in the library?  What had he been looking at?

 

I traveled back up to the second floor reading area, stomach in knots, half-expecting to find something sinister or some clue that unraveled what he was or how this had all happened.  My hands were shaking by the time I got to his table, and I probably was close to going into shock, but my tolerance for pushing through had grown dramatically in the last year.  Reaching his pile of books, I looked around for a minute and then sat down.

 

Nothing nefarious or especially interesting.  A couple of encyclopedias, a science fiction novel, and a collection of poetry.  I let out a startled yell as something vibrated in my pants.  It was a text message.  From some girl named Bridget.

 

**Hey Baby.**  **You still coming over tonight?**
