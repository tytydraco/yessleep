I moved in three weeks ago. Alone. The place was small but solid, tucked in the kind of suburb where neighbors waved but didn’t linger. I liked that. Quiet. Simple. Safe.

I take security seriously, blame my childhood. So, on day one, I had a full system installed. Door sensors. Motion alerts. Even cameras inside. Every hallway, every corner. Except the kitchen and the little room with the attic access. No windows in either, so I figured, why bother?

One night I was reviewing footage half-awake in bed, just background noise while I scrolled. But something flickered in the hallway camera. At first I chalked it up to a bug on the lens. Happens.

But the more I watched it, the less… insect it looked. Its limbs were too long. The posture was all wrong. Bent. Crooked. It wasn’t walking, it skittered.

I paused the video.

Zoomed in.

Human. Or close enough to make my stomach knot.

I posted it to Reddit, r/isthisaghost. I just wanted someone to say it was a camera glitch, that I was overtired. Instead, comments flooded in.

"That’s no glitch."
"That’s not a ghost."
"Get out of the house."

Before I could reply, the post was pulled. Violated community guidelines, apparently.

I convinced myself it was an animal. Had to be. The attic access was right there, maybe it came down at night and slipped past the cat. I moved a camera to that room. For days, nothing. No bugs. No shadows. No "thing."

Until Tuesday.

At work, I got the alert, motion detected.

I opened the feed. The attic panel slowly creaked open. Pitch black beyond it.

Then, something slammed the camera over.

My heart stuttered, until my cat’s face filled the frame. He’d finally decided to mess with the setup. I almost laughed.

But then… he stopped.

He stared toward the kitchen. Ears back.

And bolted.

The attic door was still open.

My boss yelled my name, something about a deadline, and by the time I glanced back, the camera had shifted, now pointed at a wall.

I assumed my cat knocked it again.

I called an exterminator that evening. Some raccoon must’ve made its way in. We met at my house. I showed him the attic, and he climbed up while I stood below, staring at the open hatch.

Minutes passed. Then a noise, shuffle, thump, and something poked its head out.

A rotted raccoon face, half bone, half fur.

I recoiled and gasped, but the exterminator’s voice called down, casual as anything.

“Found your pest. Looks like he’s been here a while.”

“But… I saw it yesterday,” I said. “It was alive. It moved.”

He shrugged. “Can’t say. Nothing else up here now.”

I wanted to argue, but I let it go. Maybe I was losing it.

Days passed. No alerts. No movement.

Then came the thud.
Then another.
Thud… thud… thud.

Above me.

Furious, I grabbed my phone and stormed to the attic room. I shoved the panel open and pulled the string light.

Nothing.

Dead bulb. Of course.

I used my phone’s flashlight and climbed up. Dust. Insulation. Something white just at the edge of the beam.

I stepped closer, must be fur. Raccoon fur.

Then I saw the light.

A pinhole glow filtering in from below. I crawled toward it and looked down.

My bed.

There was a hole in the attic floor, just above where I slept. Just big enough for a pair of eyes to watch through.

I didn't remember seeing it before. I didn’t want to remember.

Suddenly, a shift, a movement by the attic opening. Something had just dropped down, back into the house.

I spun to follow, and screamed.

A rusted nail caught my foot. Straight through.

Pain ripped through me as I fell, clutching my bleeding sole.

Then... silence.

The attic door slammed shut.

Darkness swallowed everything.

And from somewhere down below...

I heard the click of my bedroom door locking.
