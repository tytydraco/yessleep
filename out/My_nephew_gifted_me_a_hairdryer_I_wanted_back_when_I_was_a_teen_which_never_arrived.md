Back in 2003, as it’s Christmas, I was a teenager who wanted nothing more than something I saw on the Amazon site. A pink, shiny hairdryer. I begged for it and she gave in, she bought it for me and we waited for it to arrive.

Days turn into weeks, weeks turn into almost a month until my mom told me we’ve been scanned. She told me about scammers and trusted services when getting a debit card, and I never got that hairdryer. This was before PayPal existed and back then we would just have to live and accept it. Now into two decades, i’ve grown. I got a teenage son who’s sixteen, and a little daughter who was seven years old. I first told my son about the story lately when he’s getting his debit card and ensured him about trusting services that were trusted along with PayPal, this is days before Christmas and everyone was excited for that and my grandmother’s Christmas dinner this year.

The day came and we got presents. My son almost got what he wanted but he liked it still, and my daughter has a small pink car for her. After setting up some of the presents, we ended up going to my grandmother’s place just like every year, my dad’s sister along her husband was there with their kid along with his brother’s family, and so was the nephew. He was 50 years old and always had a very quirky and energetic side that was little-odd to us but overall he is still grownup and understands everything. We never seen him every-or-so months, i’d count six, but he’s always in the Christmas dinners every year.

We had our dinner, which being steak and peas awhile we chatted about various things we had during life, and it’s finally time for the crackers and presents. We pulled our Christmas crackers and my son got a joke from it; “Why did the turkey join the band? Because it had drumsticks!". Yep, it’s one of those bad jokes we get from the crackers. We gave each other presents, I got myself some new clothing and my husband got the Borat mankini as a joke from friends who didn’t come to the dinner party. And there’s my nephew’s present…

He gave me this present, surprisingly perfectly wrapped in red paper with a green bow on it unlike the others, which also surprised the family members too. "It’s a special surprise" he said, I decided to open it and see what’s inside of it out of curiosity, and when I finally opened it, my heart dropped when I recognized what I’m holding.

It was the hairdryer from years ago, the same one that we’re scammed from. It was fresh like it was unopened for years and it’s still looked brand new. When I saw it for the first time in years, I dropped the present on the floor in shock. This distracted other family members who’ve heard the story and they turned and saw it too, it was a mixture of shock, surprise and horror. The nephew wasn’t unfazed, but was confused by the sudden change of surroundings. My little daughter didn’t know what was going on, so she’s too young to know about the story behind the hairdryer.

My mother stared at it in a face of shock that I’ve never seen before, like the colors of her body had drained out… "Where did you find this?" I asked. My nephew looked at me with a slight little confusion and said, "I just got it from Amazon, and it arrived in perfect condition. I wasn’t surprised since it’s one of those unopened brands from decades ago-". "No. It never arrived, it never did … but how?", My mom replied. That’s when questions came into our heads: Was it delayed for years? Did it suddenly arrive to his house with no sticker? And lastly, who gave it to him just so he would gift it to me? It couldn’t be, could it?

The desserts came, every year at the Christmas dinner, it would be a different kind of cake and ice cream, this year was chocolate fudge cake and vanilla ice cream. The whole feast was, very awkward to say the least. There wasn’t talking unlike earlier, my nephew was the only one talking unlike all of us, and that fucking hairdryer was on the table at its center, being our only attention alongside the meal. Later, everyone went back home. However, my nephew was forced stay in by my grandmother "just to ask him questions". Our drive to home was even much awkward too, any of us wasn't talking with the exception of my daughter telling us what she saw at her window cheerfully. I would reply to her but it never settled me down much, although a little.

As my son and daughter were ready to go to bed in their own bedrooms, I laid onto my bed, looking up at the ceiling with the hairdryer laying next to me as I question the possibility of where it came from. And then it finally hit me…

Did that hairdryer ever come from a different timeline where the scam never happened but somehow teleported into ours?
