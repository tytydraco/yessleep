Humanity one day met up close the one unsolved mystery it could never fathom. Up until the early 2030’s the ocean was a mystery. Due to the lack of funding for ocean research, it was nearly impossible to discover everything the water had to offer us. However, soon after new satellite technology was developed, we found a way to record selected areas of the deep ocean through a new type of sonar technology. 


DeepWave was essential in the discovery of over 2000 separate species of whales alone, and countless other specimens as well. Its only downside is that it worked in sound only, not allowing us to immediately identify a new species by its looks. This led to multiple unmanned missions down the to deepest portions of our world. 


Still though, with this new technology, we only had mapped and discovered around 75% of what we believe the ocean could contain. That’s when I was tasked by the Department of Deep Sea Analysis (DDSA) to control our first manned mission to a newly discovered anomaly that DeepWave was not capable of identifying fully. 


Similar to the Mariana’s Trench (which now sits at only the fourth deepest part of the ocean), The Typhon Anomaly (named after the founder of DeepWave) is a large crater found approximately 50km southeast of Point Nemo. It was difficult to get unmanned missions to this area due to the lack of immediate contact with society, hence the missions became tedious and we could not reach the depth that we recorded interference with by DeepWave.


Usually, small amounts of strange interference were common, as ocean cables or other companies' missions could often cross wires in our technology, but Typhon was different. Originally thought to be a coding bug in the satellite itself, a sound was heard from more than 15 kilometers down. 


It caught the attention of the DDSA fast due to the fact many researchers hear talking in the recordings. Some more well-versed scientists have said it resembles some lost dialect of Latin. Other than that, the interference tends to send back our signals like a boomerang, which makes it hard to pinpoint specifics other than the shallowest parts of the hole.


•••••••••••••••••


I set out at 8 am, on December 13th, 2042. They gave me a Model 8 Victorian Submersible with a limiting factor of around 18 Kilometers, which even gave me wiggle room to go a bit deeper than the area I was tasked if necessary. Although I hoped I wouldn’t need to. 


The sub was small, but big enough that I was able to stand to stretch my legs if I sat at control too long, which would come in handy as this was a 24-hour-long excursion. I had probably too much food for the allotted time and a small pull-out cot that took up any remaining space other than control. Being my 17th manned mission in my career, I felt ready for this challenge. That was until I started the descent to Typhon.


I began a slow decline, reaching the sea floor in a matter of hours. It was dark of course, but the exterior lights lit up the edge of Typhon brighter than a spotlight. It was simply a hole at first glance, similar to a sinkhole but with no end in sight. I saw some fish and other flora and fauna scattering the edges and captured a few photos for DDSA before I continued into the real challenge. 


It felt like entering a new world in a way as I sank the sub deeper into the earth. At first, a few clunks from the outside did shake me up, but from the cameras, I could see it was simply just a few segments from the lip of the hole falling on top of the Sub. They nearly looked like they were decaying, with sand significantly more gray and nearly mush than the rest of the ocean floor. Of course it wasn’t the best thing to happen, but likely caused no damage. 


It looked simple. The walls were nearly pin-straight all the way down, no caves, no plants, and certainly no life in sight. It felt artificial in a way, almost man-made. 


As I reached the 7.5 kilometer mark I radioed in to Control. 


“Just to confirm, you did receive the sampling photography I sent you from the floor right? It’s looking like that might be the only thing I find down here. It’s barren. Starting to think Dr. Francis was right when he said the sound was just a fluke in the system.”


 I couldn’t imagine a world where something was down there. Nothing to feed off of, just a narrow pipe of nothing. 


But control did remind me, “The sound came from it hitting something nonetheless, finish your job and report back when you find it.” They were always a bit tense, but hey it’s the same of science. How else would we survive?


Passing the 8km mark I heard an alarm. The temperature around the sub was reaching higher limits than we originally expected. For example, at the bottom of the challenger deep it’s near freezing, and as you go deeper you should get as close to freezing as possible. We even have protocols in case we encounter some sort of frozen slush situation. But here it was rising. I currently sat at 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Luckily the temperature inside the sub has self-regulation, but it was still off-putting, to say the least.


As I passed 9 kilometers it seemed to widen, I was now passing the point where our last manned mission went a little out of hand. It was a larger sub at that time and unfortunately had a lot more surface area and more crew. They didn’t expect the upcoming down-current in the original calculations. Control saw their sub lose altitude faster than we had seen, and then comms shut off. They never reached the surface after that. It was deemed an implosion likely after passing their depth limit. The downcurrent, likely a product of gasses from a volcanic vent. 


That was quite a few years ago now, and I don’t know the exact specifics of the design but I was told they now had accounted for that down current. Being the first dive afterward was stressful, to say the least, and the main reason why they sent me down alone and with an extended limiting factor, but given the situation, the curiosity of the unknown seemed to bite through my fear. First man to the now deepest known part of the ocean. That’s an accomplishment I tell my grandchildren for years to come. 


I started to feel drag on the controls and I knew it was likely time for the final descent. Best case scenario I’m a hero, worst case I’m not alive to be disappointed in myself for getting no information. But the drag seemed steady, I was able to control the increased speed at a constant instead of an uncontrollable tunneling.


Passing me by I saw the start of a type of bubbling in the clay walls before it turned into a compact stone. Streaks lined the rock hundreds of feet down as I slowly started to slow back down. 


I officially made it past the downcurrent. Now I just have to worry about the pressure. I looked at my altimeter and my eyes widened. 14 kilometers. I somehow traveled over 5 km down in a matter of minutes. Even with whatever advancements they added that should be physically impossible without implosion. Although my comm light was still on, so I guess they already assumed this was possible. 


I started passing these shiny patches on the wall. There were some theories that as you reached deeper into the mantle there were pockets of precious metals but these were shimmering like stars in the sky. It was honestly beautiful, and I was so mesmerized I nearly missed Control talking to me. 


“Can we have an explanation as to why you are now ascending back to base?” 


 I stopped. I could see with the lights I was clearly still descending, as well as on the control panel. 14567 meters... 14736 meters... I was almost at my destination already, I certainly wasn’t on my way back. 


“Whatever the interference was might be affecting the data transmission. I am nearly at the anomaly sector now.” 


Looking out the cameras I saw nothing at first. The hole by this point was about the diameter of a larger-sized building. I had a little time to kill so I set the sub to maintain its altitude and shifted it over to the walls to get a better look at the shimmer. It was dark red like rubies and seemed to just melt out of the rock behind it. 


“This isn’t the time to prank us, we know that not you talking”


 I stopped looking at the walls and immediately gave all my attention back to comms. What are they hearing on their end? I thought back to the rumors of talking heard on the DeepWave sonar and thought to myself, effecting an altered sonar beam is one thing, but what down here is capable of changing my voice?


 “ I’m not sure what you mean captain, I can hear you fine on my end.”


 I started descending a bit more hoping that it was an area-specific problem, but honestly I wasn’t sure what was happening at all. It wasn’t something we experienced before. Interference like buzzing and ringing was pretty common at these depths but nothing that would change my voice itself, just the background usually. Suddenly the light on comms started blinking rapidly as I started to hear a noise from outside. It started as a ringing that I could hear through the microphone, but soon I could hear it through the walls of the sub itself. 


“I need you to stop that right now Marshalls, this is no time for this! We have family of those we lost in the last expedition right now in this room and you have the audacity to play back their black box as some sort of sick joke? Take the photos and get ba…” 


And in some sort of ironic mess, the comms shut off completely as the ringing suddenly stopped as well. I was now down here alone, with only the mangled thoughts of what the hell they heard from my transmission to them. 


I didn’t have time to think long though, as I heard a crunch sound from the exterior of the sub. I was far enough down that I don’t think anything could have possibly fallen on me from above. A million thoughts in my head crushed down as the gravity of the situation hit. I had no communications, I had no directive up, something is hacking my voice into dead man’s, and the very thing I came down here to find could possibly be right beside my sub as I sat. I wondered to myself if the expedition before me had really imploded, or if they saw something down here first that made them wish they had. 


Luckily my lights and camera did not fail with the comms. As I looked back to the cameras the water looked significantly murkier, almost aerated, but there was no creature around me. As I knew nothing else to do other than my mission, I continued down until I reached 15 kilometers. 


I started seeing things in the water surrounding me as I reached the destination. Bits and pieces of metal scraps. My heart sank as I was able to read the side of a piece, I saw the DDSA logo and in that moment I believed I had found the wreck of the expedition before me. But as the murky water seemed to clear I saw what was written, it was scraped and scuffed but clear enough to me, Model 8 Victorian. 


 I was the first person to ever take this sub this far or even in this area of the Pacific, but Somehow this wreckage was my submersible. I looked at the status on my control panel and I have no alerts that there were any malfunctions on the exterior of my ship, so there’s no way it broke off just now. Somehow the state of this expedition keeps me reeling in all the thoughts going on in my head. I’ve been through numerous other journeys similar to this but nothing that has ever been to this magnitude. I felt a wave of hopelessness pass over me as I feared I had entered an area that should not be seen by mankind. 


I attempted to start my ascent soon, hoping that I could somehow get to the surface on my own, but every time I tried I just seemed to be pulled farther down the hole. It was like the sub had a mind of its own. As it went deeper I started to panic, I knew I only had a small allowance after 15000 meters before I was at risk of implosion and my altimeter kept climbing without me pulling a single control. Alarms started to blast again as I read the temperature. 212°


The water around me wasn’t only airated, it was boiling. There’s no reason my sub should even be functioning at these heats. And it kept climbing the lower and lower I went. And with each meter dropped I heard it. The ringing from before was back, and it was no longer a whisper, it was a yell. 


I could almost call it chanting. Through the walls of the submersible, I heard what sounded like thousands yelling together. Some sounded like language, others just merciless screaming. I looked back to the camera as I felt blood start to drip from my ears. It was nearly too much to handle but had to know what I was hearing. But as soon as I caught a glimpse, I knew it was too late. 


As the camera started to flicker, the darkness started to grow and grow as the lights on the exterior seemed to fail and the lights on the interior faded as well. Before complete darkness, I saw a new opening beneath the sub. Large spikes pushed out toward me, almost like teeth. Etched into the stone itself, I read aloud the words I saw before complete darkness. 


“Abandon all hope ye who enter here”


Unending darkness seemed to control all around me.  I sat back in my control chair listening to the screams of the damned. And as my last bit of hope left, I closed my eyes and prayed for humanity.
