I used to teach music at a small rural high school in western Pennsylvania. It’s one of those towns that doesn’t show up on most maps—one gas station, two diners, and a church whose bell hasn’t rung since the ’80s. I took the job because it was quiet and cheap, and I figured a few years of experience would look good before applying for something better. I didn’t think quiet could ever mean dangerous.

The building itself is old. The primary wing dates back to the 1930s, all brick and sharp corners, the kind of place that smells like dust even when it’s clean. But the music wing was an addition from the 1960s—narrow hallways, warped floors, and, most notably, a basement choir room that no one liked to use. My first day, the janitor—a man named Rick who looked like he’d been carved out of the same stone as the building—told me, “Don’t go down there after dark. The acoustics ain’t right.” I laughed, thought it was a joke about how sound carries in old concrete rooms. He didn’t laugh back.

The first few weeks were uneventful. I taught beginner choir to first-year students, advanced to seniors, and supervised band practice in the afternoons. It was fine. The kids were good—small town polite, slightly weird, and completely normal in that rural way. But then October came, and that’s when the strange things started.

It began with sound. I’d be in my classroom after school, grading papers or tuning instruments, when I’d hear humming. At first, I thought it was a student—someone staying late to practice. But the melody was too precise. Too… together. It sounded like several voices blending, soft and perfect, harmonizing in ways that sent a tremor down my spine. The music came from below—always from the choir room in the basement.

One afternoon, I went down to check. The lights down there flickered like they hadn’t been updated in decades. The air smelled wet, like old limestone and rust. The door to the choir room was slightly open, so I pushed it in and called out, “Hello? Anyone here?” The sound stopped instantly. No scuffling, no whispering, no movement—just that heavy kind of silence that presses against your eardrums.

I should’ve left then, but curiosity is a hell of a thing. The choir room looked normal enough: rows of risers, a broken upright piano in the corner, music stands stacked in a heap. The only odd thing was the temperature. It was cold, like the air was leaking out of a refrigerator. My breath came out in white clouds, even though it was still warm upstairs.

Then I saw it—scratched into the brick near the back of the room, just behind the risers—dozens of little carvings, all in a neat semicircle. At first, I thought they were initials—typical graffiti from bored kids—but when I looked closer, I realized they were tiny musical notes, each one carefully chiseled into the wall, forming bars of a staff. It wasn’t random; it was a song.

I took a photo on my phone, figuring I’d ask the kids about it the next day. Maybe it was some old senior prank. But when I listened again that night—because of course I listened—I realized the humming I’d heard earlier was the same melody as the carved notes.

The next day, I showed the picture to my advanced choir class. A few of them recognized it immediately. “That’s the Hollow Song,” said one of the seniors, a girl named Julia. The others nodded. Apparently, it was an old local thing—something passed around in whispers during sleepovers or campfires. If you sang the Hollow Song in the basement choir room, they said, you’d hear voices singing it back. Not an echo. Real voices. And if you tried to record it, the sound wouldn’t come through—just static.

“Kids used to do it,” Julia said. “But after what happened to the 2002 class, they stopped.”

I asked what happened in 2002.

She just said, “Ask Mr. Calloway,” and wouldn’t meet my eyes.

Mr. Calloway had been the choir director before me. He retired a few years earlier, but he still lived in town. That night, I looked him up and called his number. His wife answered first, then handed the phone to him when I introduced myself. He was polite, but quiet. When I asked about the Hollow Song, he went completely silent for a long moment before saying, “You shouldn’t go down there. Some rooms remember too much.” Then he hung up.

That’s when I realized I wasn’t dealing with a campfire story.

Over the next few weeks, the noises grew louder. Sometimes I’d hear singing while class was in session. Students would look around nervously, pretending not to hear it. One day, a freshman started crying in the middle of rehearsal. When I asked what was wrong, she said, “They’re copying us.” I asked who, but she wouldn’t say.

That weekend, I decided I had to know the truth. I stayed late on Friday evening, pretending to work on lesson plans. When the janitor left, I took a flashlight and a portable recorder and went down to the basement. I told myself it was for research—for my own peace of mind. But deep down, I think I wanted to hear it for myself.

The air grew colder the deeper I went. The light in the stairwell buzzed and dimmed. When I stepped into the choir room, the silence was absolute. Even the hum of the building’s pipes seemed to stop. I stood in the center, hit “record,” and waited.

At first, nothing. Then, a faint hum—soft, distant, like wind moving through a hollow pipe. I held my breath. The hum grew stronger, splitting into multiple tones. Chords began forming, resolving, rising. It was beautiful in a wrong way—too perfect, too synchronized. No human choir could blend like that.

Then the melody started. The Hollow Song. The same pattern carved into the wall. Only this time, I could hear words under the harmony—low, whispering syllables in a language I didn’t know. My knees felt weak. I tried to speak, to ask “Who’s there?” but my voice came out cracked and dry. And then I heard it—the shuffle of feet behind me.

I spun around. The room was empty, but the risers were shaking slightly, like something had just stepped off them. The singing grew louder, closer, until I could feel it vibrating in my chest. The walls began to pulse with each note, and I realized—God help me—that the brick itself was singing.

I stumbled backward, the flashlight jerking wildly across the floor. That’s when I saw what I’d missed before. The carvings on the wall weren’t just notes anymore. They’d spread down across the floor, curling like roots, each one forming new bars of music that hadn’t been there before. And woven between them, faint outlines—shapes like human ribs, skulls, vertebrae, all scratched in the same hand.

It was a choir of bones.

The song stopped suddenly, like a switch had been flipped. I bolted upstairs, my recorder still running, my heart pounding so hard I could barely breathe. When I reached my classroom, I shut the door, locked it, and sat there shaking until morning.

The recording was useless—just static and faint pops. But in the middle, right before it ends, there’s something else. If you turn up the volume, you can hear it: my own voice whispering, “Join us.” The thing is—I never said that.

I told the principal the basement was unsafe, that there might be black mold or structural damage. He agreed to temporarily close it off. They sealed the door with caution tape, and I tried to forget. But the students didn’t. They kept hearing the song—through the vents, the pipes, even in the gymnasium. One boy claimed he saw faces in the mirrors during rehearsal. Another swore a girl’s voice sang harmony with him, perfectly matched to his pitch, though he was alone.

By December, three of my students had dropped out of choir entirely. I couldn’t blame them. I started hearing it in my sleep, too.

I finally decided to leave after what happened to Julia. It was just before winter break. The janitor found her in the basement stairwell, sitting on the landing with her eyes open and a faint smile on her face. She was humming. Over and over. The Hollow Song. When they tried to move her, she started screaming—so loud the lights flickered. They had to sedate her. She never came back to school.

The next day, the caution tape was torn down. The door to the choir room was open. Inside, the carvings had grown again. New lines, new symbols. And at the very bottom, written in what looked like dried rust, were the words: “Our voices remember.”

I quit that week.

I moved three states away and took a job teaching music theory online. But it’s been years, and I still hear it sometimes—usually late, when I’m alone and everything’s quiet. The hum starts faint, just behind my walls, then builds into something almost beautiful.

I don’t know how long I have left until what happened to Julia happens to me, but I’ll try my best to resist it. So I’ll leave you with this, don’t go looking for the hollow song it’s not a made up story… It’s real.
