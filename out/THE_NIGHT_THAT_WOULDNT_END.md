It started with the walls breathing.  
At least, that’s what it felt like.  
The wallpaper swelled and sank in slow rhythm, as if the house itself was exhaling and I was trapped inside its lungs.

I hadn’t slept in three days.  
Not since the whispers began.  
They came at 2:37 a.m. every night the same hour like clockwork.  
First, it was faint murmuring from the corner of my room, too low to understand.  
Then, they started saying my name.

The air grew heavy, dense, sticky like smoke without fire.  
The shadows on my ceiling began to stretch, bending at impossible angles, reaching toward me like black fingers.  
Every time I turned on the lamp, they snapped back into place ordinary, still.  
But the moment the light went off, they moved again.

That night, I decided to stay awake.  
To prove to myself it wasn’t real.

At 1:58 a.m., the power went out.  
The silence was total.  
No hum of the fridge, no ticking clock, no sound of cars outside.  
Just my own heartbeat, loud in my ears and the faint sound of **breathing** beside my bed.

I froze.  
Slowly turned my head.  
There was someone lying next to me.  
I could see the shape long hair, a face turned toward the wall, breathing shallow and wet.  
My throat locked.  
I live alone.

I tried to reach for my phone, but my arm wouldn’t move.  
It felt pinned something *heavy* pressing my chest.  
And then the whisper came, closer than ever, inches from my ear.

The shape beside me rolled over.  
Her face was *mine*.  
My same eyes but black, hollow, dripping something thick like tar.  
She smiled, and when she did, I felt every muscle in my body lock.

The bedroom door creaked open on its own.  
The hallway beyond was completely dark not just dark, but *void*, like light itself couldn’t exist there.  
Out of it came footsteps.  
Not human.  
Crawling, dragging, scraping across the floorboards.

I tried to scream, but only a gasp escaped.  
The walls began to pulse faster, the air hotter, suffocating.  
From the corner, shapes began to emerge crawling from the cracks in the walls, from beneath the bed, from inside the closet.  
Dozens of them.  
Some whispering.  
Some crying.  
Some laughing.

The one that looked like me leaned close and whispered,

The room twisted walls bending inward, the ceiling breathing harder, until I felt like I was inside a throat.  
Hands dozens of them reached from the walls, clawing at my skin, pulling me into the plaster.  
I fought, I screamed, I begged  
but they didn’t stop.  
They just kept whispering,

Then silence.  
Morning light.  
I was in my bed.  
Alone.

The power was back on.  
Everything normal.  
Except for the fingernail marks carved into the wall beside me too high for me to have reached.  
And the smell…  
that faint scent of sulfur and burned wax that still hasn’t left.

I haven’t slept since.  
Because every time I close my eyes…  
I feel the house **inhale**.
