When I was 10 years old, we moved from a small 2 BHK apartment to this bungalow-esque house. My dad bought it, at a price which was quite high compared to the other, similar houses that were for sale, but narrating his argument on his behalf - ' I have an unexplainable feeling, a peculiar voice in my mind telling  me that buying this house will be the best decision I ever make'. Motivated by peculiar voices, he bought it within a week, taking a long duration home loan as well as paying a hefty down payment. All of this didn't matter, this 'unexplainable feeling' of a house was now ours.

From a very small age, I have been gathering experience in moving from one place to another. You guys are probably thinking, it's probably because of my dad's work or maybe something happened. Nope. My parents are batshit crazy, that's why. Even before I was born, as soon as they got married, they started moving from one place to another,  like wanderers. Never staying at one place for more than 2 years, life was spent more on roads than in houses. As a side effect of such a lifestyle, we never lived in big houses, since that would be a wasteful investment. My parents always purchased houses which were just barely livable and had paper thin resale value. After molesting that already comatose cubbyhole for 2 years, we would sell it at any price the buyers offer with minimal bargaining and resume our weird adventures. 

So seeing my father purchase such a nice, big bungalow, that too by taking a long term home loan surprised me. On one hand, I was happy thinking The Nomadic Misadventures of a Weird Family has finally come to an end. But on the other hand, I had an uncanny feeling, as if something bizarre is going to happen. 


The house, although really well maintained and surprisingly clean, was significantly old. 
There were 4 rooms on the main, central floor and another 4 rooms on the upper floor. For just 3 people, this was ridiculously excessive. But at that time, my endlessly jovial self didn't believe so. To me this was the perfect residence. 

As I specified, this house was vintage, built around something like 1925 or perhaps  1952 I really don't remember and since then it has hosted only 2 families and an individual. The first family was the original owner of this abode. A rich businessman, his wife and their 7 children(5 boys and 2 girls) stayed here lavishly.  There were no such houses anywhere around there like this house, so it became the crème de la crème of that locality. Everything felt right at first but then things started taking a strange turn. Firstly, their 2nd youngest son who was around 6 years old suddenly contracted pneumonia and despite being treated by the best doctors of that town and taking a lot of medication, he died within one week. 

Secondly, their oldest daughter who was 15 years old died from jumping off the roof of the house. They suspected someone pushed her off the roof as they could hear her screams as she fell down and then everything got silent with a *plump* sound. 

Thirdly, the mother, one night, took out her husband's revolver from his holder, snuck out of their room, went to each of the childrens' rooms and shot each of them right in the middle of their foreheads and afterwards, apparently told her husband who woke up suddenly due to the sound of the gunfire and rushed to the scene,  'my darling, the eggs were getting rotten, so I threw out the case'. The next day, the police arrested the wife and her husband moved out of the house and put it up for sale.
