Time started to unravel after that.

The silence settled in like mold. Not just quiet — but a sort of listening quiet. Like the stone was waiting for something. Like it knew I couldn’t leave.

My flashlight was slowly dying. It would flicker sometimes, a faint warning. I knew I had to ration what little battery life I had left.
Five minutes on, five minutes off. Enough to conserve the batteries. Enough to remind myself that I was still here.

Five minutes really meant counting to sixty, five times and then starting over. I was far from accurate. Who knows how long I really waited down there. Sometimes I’d panic in the last minute before reaching sixty, flipping the light on to save me from things I kept telling myself weren’t really there.

The darkness in between felt heavier each time.

And eventually, things started to… slip.

It began small. The sound of movement behind me — nothing loud, just soft scuffing. I told myself it was my own breath. My own shifting weight.

But then I found things.

My bottle had moved. Not far — maybe a few inches — but I remembered where I left it. I always remember where I leave things.
I’d turn the light on and it would be on its side. 
The cap would be loose.

I hadn’t touched it.

My heart started racing. I told myself I must’ve done it without noticing. Maybe I’d drifted off mid-sip, setting it down before closing my eyes. Maybe I was more tired than I realized.

Then came the voices.

Not full sentences. Just murmurs. Too soft to make out, but too clear to be wind. They came from behind the walls. Or maybe from the cracks in the ceiling. Or maybe from inside my own skull. I didn’t know.

I turned my flashlight back on.

Nothing.

Just stone and dust. That pool of water from above had leaked down and formed another — just as still, just as unsettling.

I stared at my reflection and didn’t like the way it looked back. The shape of my face was wrong. Stretched. Smiling when I wasn’t.

I turned my flashlight off.

The light was no longer my friend.

That’s when I started seeing them.

Not clearly. Not yet. But out of the corner of my eye — movement. Shapes that shouldn’t move. Faces that blinked out the second I turned my head. Fingers coiled around stone and pulled away before the light caught them.

Every time I turned the beam toward them, there was nothing.

But I knew what T would say.

“You feel it, don’t you?”

I clenched my teeth.

It wasn’t real. It couldn’t be real.

I’d fallen. Hit my head. Lost blood. My leg was broken. I was probably dehydrated.

Those were facts.

It couldn’t be anything else.

Could it?

And yet… every time I turned off the light, I felt them get closer.

Where are you, T? What’s taking so long?

It started getting impossible to keep track of time. I lost count somewhere around the thirtieth cycle. Maybe less. Maybe more. The dark swallowed numbers faster than I could hold them.

He said he’d come back. He said he would. And I believed him.

For a while.

But belief bends under pressure — especially when the cold sinks deeper than your skin, and your stomach starts to feel like it’s trying to digest your own spine.

Then I heard the whispers again, just once, but this time it sounded like my name. Carried faintly down the tunnel. A long, soft drag — not quite male, not quite female. I thought maybe T had finally come back. Maybe he was calling to me from another part of the cave.

I whispered his name.

No answer.

I clicked the flashlight off. Waited.

Clicked it on.

Nothing.

Eventually, I was able to convince myself I was sleep-deprived. That I’d drifted off and dreamed it. That would make sense. Dreams don’t count.

But then came the smell.

It wasn’t strong. Just… wrong. Metallic. Like wet copper and scorched dust. It seemed to come and go, like a breeze that shouldn’t be there.

I closed my eyes and told myself it was just the cave playing tricks. Old air pockets. Underground drafts.

I knew the theories.

I believed in the theories.

Then, during one of the off-cycles, I felt something brush my leg.

Fast. Cold. Like a hand — or a claw — skimming just above the ankle. When I flicked the light on, there was nothing. Just empty stone and the edge of my pant leg soaked with cold sweat.

I told myself it was a rock.

I told myself it was my imagination.

I told myself a lot of things.

But the more I tried to explain it, the less sure I became. Every rational thought started to sound like a lie I was telling myself to stay sane.

And I WAS still sane.

Wasn’t I?

Again, I tried to explain it all away.

The tapping? Just rock settling.
The scraping? My own boot shifting against the wall.
The flickers of movement at the edge of my flashlight beam? Shadows bending under the strain of dying batteries. Nothing more.

But… I couldn’t explain the laughter.

It started faint, barely audible — like wind slipping through narrow cracks in the stone. High-pitched. Staggered.

But it didn’t sound human. It had too many voices. Too many mouths. It echoed where there was no room to echo. It lingered even after I clamped my hands over my ears.

Still, I didn’t call it real. Not out loud.

My mind tried to force out the voices. I tried to get back to counting the cycles, this time out loud. But honestly, five minute cycles seemed too long, so I tried cutting it down to a few minutes. Then one minute. Then thirty second cycles.

But every time the light came back, something felt… closer.

Not just the walls.

Not just the dark.

Them.

Again, I thought it was just the shadows rearranging. Trick of the eye.

But then I saw a hand.

A real hand. Thin and gray. Fingers long enough to belong to something else entirely. It reached out from the tunnel entrance across the chamber — just a quick motion, like it was testing the light.

I froze.

Didn’t breathe. Didn’t blink. I aimed the beam right at it — and it was gone. No sound. No retreating footsteps. Just vanished.

Even though I desperately wanted to,

I didn’t scream. 

I didn’t call for T.

Because I knew he wasn’t there.

He left.

He had to leave.

Help is coming. T is coming. They’re on their way. I told myself, over and over.

The light flickered again.

I shut it off.

Waited.

Counted to thirty.

Turned it on again.

There were footprints.


THERE. WERE. FOOTPRINTS.


Not mine. Not T’s. Small. Bare. Dozens of them, circling the chamber like a dance.

The light stayed on after that.

The light wasn’t my friend — but the dark was definitely my enemy.

I didn’t sleep. I couldn’t.
I just sat there, shivering, sweating, waiting for something to change. Waiting for the batteries to die completely so I could give up pretending I was still in control.

I told myself I’d hallucinated the footprints.

That my brain was conjuring things out of fear. That trauma was playing tricks on me.

But then I smelled the breath.

It hit me from behind — warm, wet, rancid. Like rotting leaves left too long in standing water. And when I spun the flashlight around, I saw its eyes.

Reflective. Round. A dozen of them clustered together on the ceiling.

And they blinked.

I dropped the light.

Scrambled backward until pain screamed up my leg and forced me still. The flashlight rolled to a stop, the beam swinging wildly across the walls. Every flash revealed a little more — a hand gripping a crack in the stone. A shadow pressed flat against the far side of the chamber. A low shape hunched behind a rock, sniffing the air with long, birdlike movements.

They were watching me.

Studying me.

Waiting.

I didn’t know how long I sat like that. Breathing in through my nose, out through clenched teeth, trying not to cry.

After a while I tried to slowly move toward the flashlight. Reaching out with my good leg. The pain in my other leg was still immense, but the fear of being unarmed dulled it just enough for me to move — just slightly.

My foot barely reached the bottom of the flashlight. I could feel it under the heel of my boot now. Slowly, I dragged it toward me.
I reached my hand out, preparing myself to kick it to my open hand.

And then—

Darkness.

The flashlight had rolled over, turning itself off.

I froze.

Waiting for something to happen.

Nothing.

Just the same old silence.

I waited even longer.

My heart racing. My breath caught in my lungs.

And still—

Nothing.

My heartbeat slowly returned to normal and I was able to breathe again.

Of course there was nothing there, I told myself, relieved. What was I even scared of?

I even started to laugh at myself for being so tense.

But then a voice spoke.

It wasn’t a whisper. Not quite. It was… like a recording that had warped and replayed wrong.

It said:
“Q-ue-en… o-of… B-ones…”

My breath caught.

“No,” I muttered. “No no no—”

I desperately reached for the flashlight, doing my best to ignore the shooting pain in my leg.

“Queen of Bones…” the voice repeated, quieter now. Lower. Like it had learned my cadence.

Panic overwhelmed me.

“I can’t find it! The flashlight! Fuck, where is it!?”

I searched frantically, all around me, but I couldn’t find the light.

Did they take it?

“QUEEN OF BONES!” it repeated — now with what seemed like dozens of voices, all around me.

I was wrong.

T was right.

They were real.

And they were here.



⸻



I don’t remember losing consciousness.

I just remember waking up.

Jolted upright by a pressure in my skull — like someone pressing their thumbs into the soft spots behind my eyes. My throat was raw. My body was soaked through with sweat, even though the cave was freezing. My flashlight was in my lap. Still working. Still humming.

When did it get there? When did I turn it on?

“Was it all just a nightmare…?” I said aloud.
Maybe I just drifted off to sleep?

I picked up the flashlight, shining it across the room. My eyes were still adjusting, but it seemed like the cave hadn’t changed.

Except—

Something HAD changed.

The footprints were closer now. Fresh. The little heel marks pressed into the dust, overlapping each other, forming spirals. Patterns.

I wasn’t alone.


Then I heard it.

Footsteps. Fast. Skittering. Coming from behind the bend.

I spun the light — just in time to catch a flash of skin.
Not gray this time. Pale. Bruised.

Familiar.


It was S.


Her chipped front tooth. Her black hoodie. Her little fists clenched like she was still ready to swing at the dark.

She stepped into the light and smiled.

Her mouth moved like she was trying to whisper something to me, but the pounding of my heartbeat was so loud, it drowned her out.

I blinked — and she was gone.

No footfall. No breath. No sound.

Then I heard her again. Behind me.

“You always cheated,” she said, her voice distorted. “You were too slow to win fair.”

I turned and saw the outline again — not a girl. 
Not anymore.

Bent and wrong. Like someone — something — wearing her body but not knowing how to fit inside it.

Her face split down the center in a grin too wide for her head.

And then I heard T.

“Get up,” his voice barked.

I turned toward the tunnel. “T?”

“Get up,” he said again — but the voice didn’t match the words.
It was off. Delayed. Like a recording echoing back with just a beat too long between each syllable.

“Get up. Get. Up. Ge… tup.”

The voice was still his. But the tone was mocking now. Childish. Like it was playing with his voice the way a kid plays with a toy.

Then they all started talking at once:

“Queen of Bones.”
“Get up.”
“You always cheated.”
“You left her.”
“We waited.”
“We remember.”
“She’s ours.”
“She’s ours.”
“She’s ours.”

“YOU’RE OURS.”

They crawled out from the cracks in the wall.
At least a dozen. Maybe more.

Not tall. No more than a foot high, but twisted — like their joints didn’t know where to bend. Their skin looked carved, like bark that had been burned and polished. Eyes too big. Fingers too long.

One of them stepped forward and reached for my leg.

I tried to kick — forgetting it was broken.
I let out a guttural scream; the pain was overwhelming.

Another grabbed my arm.

Another climbed up my back and wrapped its limbs around my head.

I felt nails digging into my scalp. Pulling. Twisting my hair.

I screamed again, wildly this time, but it didn’t stop.

Their hands were everywhere — clutching, pulling, fingers shoved into my mouth, my ears. My skull felt like it was splitting from the pressure.

And then—

“Not your fault,” one of them said, in my voice.


“I love you.”


“I’m not S.”


“I will be.”


Was this my last conversation with T?
Were they there the whole time?
Watching us?
Listening to our words?
Waiting for one of us to leave?

They all laughed.

But it didn’t sound like us anymore.

It sounded like echoes stacked on top of echoes — the cave itself laughing through every crack, every tunnel, every breath of old air.

I thrashed. Fought. Bit something and felt it crunch.

My flashlight spun in the air and slammed against the stone — then flickered out.

Darkness.

Stillness.

No pain.

Just my own sobs echoing back to me.

I lay there, not knowing how long it had been. Minutes? Hours?

The air was heavy again. The smell of rust or copper even stronger.

I reached for the flashlight. Found it. Clicked it on.

I was alone.

No footprints. No spirals. No S. No T.

But my arms were bleeding.

Thin red lines where nails had definitely scratched me.

My scalp throbbed. My jaw ached from where something had held it open.

And worst of all?

I believed.

Finally.

I believed.
