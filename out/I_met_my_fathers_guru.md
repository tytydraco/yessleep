I’m writing this because my father can’t. He can’t do anything for himself anymore. But I’m writing this for me, too, because he is my mirror image. I’m hoping that by writing this, I can understand him better, and perhaps you will understand me, too.

I remember when my father was human. I remember walking with him downtown across the railroad tracks and he would joke about getting his foot caught, or when he would take AA batteries and pretend to swallow them. When we lived in a loft above a shady strip club. When he would spoil me, when he cared. When things were good.

My father was many things when I was young, but what sticks with me most were his religious inclinations. He was into neo-hinduism ever since I can remember. He had countless books from all sorts of philosophers or yogis about the nature of realization and enlightenment. He would play recordings of teachers somewhere off in India speaking on the nature of reality. I was always used to this. I can’t say his influence didn’t rub off on me. I can’t say some of my beliefs don’t stem from what he exposed me to. I’m just glad I didn’t go down the same route he did.

You see, my father was a little too obsessed with the idea of enlightenment. He would read his books all day long, almost like a ritualistic act; like if he kept it up, the universe might reward him with eternal bliss. He would tell me when I was little that he had to sit on his zabuton until his bones ached to know he was doing a good job, that a diligent meditation was necessary for his enlightenment. I would be playing games on my PS3 in the corner while my father sat in the middle of the room, legs crossed and eyes closed, still as a rock with an Om in his throat.

It truly grew to the point of obsession. All day he would be sat reading a great teacher in the original sanskrit or listening to one on his radio. Even as a child, I knew something was off when he started talking about meeting a guru.

He told me that there was this guru out in Texas — where he was born — that would be able to help him reach enlightenment, if only he could meet him. That just being in his presence would change you. I didn’t understand why he needed this so bad, but he did.

He began talking to this “guru” on online forums, telling me all about the wonderful conversations they had. He told me it was imperative that he chat with the guru for a while; the man was apparently a recluse. He wouldn’t meet just anyone. He needed to make sure you were deserving, or whatever. So for many months, I would hear occasionally how they talked to one another and the glorious teachings that were bestowed upon my father.

Finally, one day when I was 10, my father came to me with a smile on his face. I was busy playing Skylanders and eating chips, hands covered in dust. I put down the controller as he talked.

“I’m going to meet him.” He said. “Michael wants to see me.”

In that moment I can remember a spark of dread festering in my stomach. He went on to tell me *we* were going to Houston, that *we* were going to have such a good time, how this would change *our* lives.

Being 10 with only a father figure in my life, I had no choice but to travel with him. He couldn’t leave me with some extended family or siblings or even my mother. He was always the black sheep, which drove them all away. There was no one else to watch me while he met his guru, and I had no choice but to come along. 

I remember feeling sick to my stomach as we drove south. My body ached with worry and discomfort as I thought about the guru. Michael Wirth was his name. A 40-something man who lived on the outskirts of Houston. I know my father told me once that he used to be a professor. I didn’t know why he wasn’t anymore at that time, but it’s so clear now. His only contact with the outside world seemed to be on private internet forums and Reddit. He would post his teachings in the silent halls of the internet, and the few desperate enough to find him would listen. My father was one of them.

We reached his home late the night we left. It was a 14 hour drive, non-stop but for gas or snacks. My father needed to be there.

It wasn’t what I was expecting. We were poor, but weren’t as poor as Michael. He lived in a trailer in the middle of no-where with no one else around. Through our yellowing headlights, I saw that he had a blue-and-white umbrella put up by his door to shade a beaten-up recliner from the sun. The fabric on it was torn and brown, stained from years of being outside. There were scattered trees around his home, overgrown and sheltering his reclusive nature from the world. Nowadays, I wonder if he was even legally there. It wouldn’t surprise me if he wasn’t. Nothing would surprise me about Michael.

When we arrived and my father shut the car off, the front door to the trailer opened. Out stepped a balding man in a dress shirt and pants. He looked like an office man to me. I’d wondered if he worked in the city.

My father stepped out and ushered me to come with him. I walked slowly behind him, trying to decide if I wanted to stay as far away from Michael as possible or if I wanted to cling to my father’s leg. I ended up keeping close because my father kept turning around to tell me to keep up the pace.

We stood before Michael and he looked peacefully into my father’s eyes. I stared up at him in fear as my father began to ramble to him, to spew his mouth about how glad he was to be here, how he was so excited to be shown the way. Michael said nothing. He just smiled softly. Some might find his presence to be utterly welcoming. I could tell that my body wanted that for me, but it wouldn’t come. I just stared at him with my heart racing, trying to understand why this man would scare me so much. My father wouldn’t shut up. He just kept talking. I wondered whether he would be embarrassed if he could hear himself. I knew he was too lost in himself to realize anything he was saying. He just wanted to please Michael, to know Michael.

When he seemed finished, Michael finally spoke. “Why don’t you come inside? We will talk.”

He looked happy then. He’d looked happy ever since we left Iowa, and even happier now that we were in his guru’s presence. He turned his jolly face to me and bent to my height.

“You can wait out here, Georgia Being.” That was his nickname for me. “Being.” I was his little ball of existence, a mirror of his own. “Me and Michael are going to talk. You can go in the car if you want, it’s unlocked. Just stay on this side of the road.”

I nodded, too frightened to protest. I felt like a mouse in a live trap, waiting to starve to death. And I felt stupid for it. I saw how happy my father was and I had the gall to feel so scared. If he trusted Michael, shouldn’t I? What right did I have not to listen to him?

They disappeared into the light of the trailer. I watched them go, standing in the cold dark of night. I remember how happy he looked in that moment, following his guru into his home. His rosy cheeks, the light in his eyes. It was the last time I would ever see him like that.

After our drive down, I was utterly exhausted. I needed to rest, but for some reason, my fear was now placed in my father’s safety as well as my own. I didn’t want to be out of sight of him, even if he was in a room I was not. What if he came running out and I had to defend him? What if I was his last hope?

I reluctantly sat in the dirtied recliner. It creaked as I sat down and I imagined myself on a high bridge over water. I sank into the cushion and felt springs pressing into my bottom. It stank of something I didn’t recognize and had a wetness to it. Not utterly wet, but soft as if it were sweating. It made me sick, but standing would exhaust me further and I did not want to wait in the car.

I stared out into the night while I waited. I tried so hard to keep my eyes open. It was so quiet. I was used to the sounds of cars on blacktop rumbling beneath my bed, or loud, blasting music coming up through the floor boards. The shouts of our neighbors having another domestic dispute, or ambulances blurring past. But this was so unfamiliar. There were no cars on the dirt roads we took to get here. There were no crickets chirping or neighbors partying. Not even a plane in the sky.

The only noise I heard was the coyotes barking.

I feel now that they were warning me. Their barks came from far off fields or forests in every direction. They howled in a choir somewhere I could not see. I thought I should be scared of them, scared that they would come eat a skinny kid like me – easy prey. But their howls only got farther until there was a lone coyote shouting. I thought he was saying, “Go home.”

I turned my head to the trailer. It was the only light around except for a dim, blinking lamp by the dirt road. I could see the silhouettes of Michael and my father through one of the windows. It left a pit in my stomach, the sight. They appeared to be standing face to face. One of them had their hands on the other’s head, grasping. They were still as stone. I heard nothing. I forced myself to look away.

I fell asleep after that. When I woke, it was day. The umbrella was blocking the harsh Texas sun from my body. The recliner, even in the heat, still held the dampness from when I sat down. That was the first thing I noticed. Then I saw my father.

He was out in the field in front of Michael’s trailer, head tilted toward the sky. He stared up at the vast blueness, a cloudless day, sun shining down on him. As sleep began to leave my head, I wondered how long he had been there.

A creak beside me made me jump. Michael was standing on the steps up to his door. He was looking at my father, the same soft smile on his face. His eyes half-lidded and full of something I couldn’t place. When I looked at him, he turned his head to me.

Dread. Dread was all I felt, all I knew. That was my one truth in that moment, even after the sense of peace washed over me. Michael stared into my eyes and I was entranced.

I felt myself die. Maybe this was the ego death my father had promised me, that which led to eternal bliss. It was like God had looked upon me and shown me some incomprehensible truth. Like I was looking at something that was beyond all reality, something that was not made for humans to understand. I felt like a dog before Man, some sort of master of me. I just knew that Man was evil. This was not God.

He looked away. I truly do not know how long he looked at me. Perhaps a few seconds, or longer. I wouldn’t have known the difference. It didn’t even feel like it mattered. He did not speak. But as he looked away, I felt worthless. I knew that I was unworthy. He did not need to tell me.

I got up after that and hurried over to my father. I didn’t look back at Michael.

“Dad?” I asked. “Dad?”

I reached him and grabbed the hem of his shirt. He didn’t move, so I poked him. No response. I walked around to the front of him and looked at his face.

I cannot describe the emotion in it. For a moment, however, before his head turned down to face me, I saw a shimmer in his eyes. They looked as if they were made of sea glass, a matte and pale substance in the place of his pupils. My child brain panicked that perhaps he had stared at the sun too long, that since it could bleach items left out that maybe it had done that to him. But when he looked at me, it was gone.

“Don’t you feel so happy?” He asked me. I didn’t respond.

He took in a deep breath and let out a long, soft sigh. I noticed his hands at his sides, big and worn from labor. They trembled meekly beside him.

“Can we go home now?” I asked.

He hummed and sighed again. “We’re going to be so happy.”

He took me to the car and strapped me into the front seat. A smile was plastered on his face that did not leave him. As the car started, I stared over the dash at Michael. He was still on his steps. He had not moved. Nothing about him had changed, not the smile on his face or his peaceful demeanor. The guru watched us drive away.

We made it home in the early hours of the morning. I had not been able to fall asleep on the drive back, no matter how tired I had been. It felt as if something was keeping me awake. I also felt as if it was my responsibility to watch my father, to make sure that he was safe. I was young – it’s not as if, had he not been able to drive, that I would have – but I still felt obligated to be alert.

Perhaps it was the exhaustion setting in. I don’t know. But I could not stop hearing a voice.

It was a soft, tame voice. It felt welcoming. It felt like home. It wanted me to return to it. It wanted me to give in. I didn’t. I don’t think I knew how.

Things weren’t the same after that trip. Having gone so quick and left so fast, I was jarred. It felt like I had just had the most vivid dream of my life, and it was over, and I was still waking up. But my father wasn’t. He was awake now.

The most obvious change in him was his demeanor. He never dropped his smile. He always remained positive. He spoke less than he used to, no more rambles about life or reality. He would speak in simple phrases. He would act completely non-dual, as if he was the world.

“How wonderful the trees.” He said as he stared out the window of our loft. “I sway as they sway. We are wonderful.” There were no trees on our street.

It got bad when he started to neglect things. It was like he completely forgot about the material, like objects were not part of his reality. He wouldn’t buy food except in rare moments of lucidity. I would meekly suggest to him how hungry I was, how it would be nice to have a bite to eat. Most days, he would say something like, “It’s okay, Being. It’s okay. He feeds us all.”

I had to resort to the free breakfasts at my school, or begging my friends to let me take their lunches home or to bring me an extra one. I was already a skinny kid, but this made it even worse.

For some reason, he didn’t get any skinnier. My dad had always been a big man. I always thought he looked like a young Santa Claus, what with his big, greying beard and round belly. And despite how little he ate, how few times a month he would bring home any groceries, he maintained his figure. I just kept getting worse and worse.

My own personal hell were the whispers. That soft voice again, speaking to me in the slow moments of the day. I still felt unworthy. I still felt as if I could not accomplish what it was asking of me, that I could not return, but it wasn’t as if I wanted to. It felt like it was programmed into me, like it was my directive to return. Return to the earth, return to what I am. But I wished to remain a distant speck in the cosmos, not to become whatever this thing wanted me to be, or to go back to being what I was always meant to be, what we all are. 

Sometimes my father would speak as if he could hear them, too. Hear exactly what they were saying to me.

“We will be so happy when you do.” He would say randomly. Nothing would have prompted it. I wouldn’t have mentioned the whispers – I never did, how could I? I could barely speak to him anymore. He was incoherent. But every time he spoke, it was just after they had.

“Who am I?” Was something he asked me once. I did not think much of it. Who am I? was a mantra that I have heard since I was little, the death of all thoughts. But instead of suggesting that I should practice its meditation, he walked up to me, grabbed me by the shoulders, and stared deep into my eyes. It was his most lucid moment since Michael. He bore no smile.

I would have turned to my mother, but she was distant. She wanted little to do with my father after I was born, and by extension, myself. She told me once that I reminded her too much of my father. There was a reason he needed all his spirituality; methadone could never suffice. I didn’t think he even took it anymore.

CPS was finally called one day when he snapped. I wouldn’t even call it a snap – it was a drastic change in movement, supposedly, in my mind, premeditated since the day we drove to Houston. It was what was coming all along.

I was watching an anime on his flatscreen while he sat still on his zabuton. It was blaring extra loud today because the neighbors were having another one of their fights. He used to get annoyed if I would be doing anything without headphones while he meditated, but it didn’t matter to him anymore, not now that he was “enlightened.” He would still meditate – in fact, it’s all he would ever do. Day in and day out he was on his zabuton or off somewhere distant in his head, perhaps connecting with everything he could understand about the world. Perhaps he was in the trees when he came for me. Perhaps he was swaying as they swayed. I used to want to meditate with him, to get a turn on his cushion, but that old, black zabuton wasn’t what it used to be. I could always see the shimmer of his sweat.

It started with a blinding pain to the back of my head. I hadn’t even heard him get up, too zoned in on my show. It hurt so bad that I almost passed out, but I didn’t. I cowered on the ground, turning my body toward the light, toward him. He was standing above me, his soft smile on his face. I saw in his eyes what I had seen all those months ago after he had talked to Michael. I saw the matte white of them, the cloud, the haze covering his pupils.

“Michael wants to see you now.” He told me. “He’s ready to talk to you in person. He says he’s gotten to know you so well these past few months.”

I didn’t know what he was talking about. I had never spoken to Michael. The most internet usage I had was YouTube. Reddit was for adults, not me. He never told me what private forums Michael could be found on. It wasn’t until many years later that I found his Blogger account.

As my father loomed over me, a broken visage of the man he once was, I scrambled in fear. I tried not to make a sound. It felt like it would do nothing. Tears just came in quiet bursts and blinded my desperate path to freedom. He just kept coming. Slow, methodical, calm. He hadn’t had anything in his hands when he struck me. I think it was the pure force of his fist. I never knew he could be so strong, or so cruel against his own daughter. But was I his daughter? I didn’t even know if he was the same man I had travelled to Texas with. I would be inclined to believe not.

The TV was still blaring above me but I could faintly hear the shouts of my neighbors. I knew they were crazy, but my father was even more so. They were the only adults around. I was 11 now, but that wouldn’t get me very far. I couldn’t drive, I couldn’t travel on my own. I needed a person.

He lunged for me.

I had the advantage of speed, even on my back. I scrambled out of the way as his heavy body thwacked against our floors. I watched his thick head bounce with a sickening smack. A 300-pound man, I’m sure everyone in the building heard that crash. If I had not gotten out of the way, I fear my bone-thin body would have been utterly shattered.

I shouldn’t have hesitated to run out the front door, but I did. He was still my father. I still cared. As I pushed myself to my feet, staring down at him, his body moved. His head, currently facing away from me, slowly turned beneath him. His thick arms pushed upwards as his belly pooled around him, fat forming a landing pad for himself. Just before I moved for the door, he looked at me.

His eyes showed matte and his head split down his temple. There was no blood, just a viscous, shimmering liquid. It seeped out of him and oozed. It was like thick, glimmering sweat. I saw it moving. Pulsing, turning, creeping out of him like a fungus. I finally ran.

I made it to the door and slammed it shut behind me before I ran across the hall and pounded on my neighbor’s. I didn’t hear any shouts from inside then, and not after I knocked, and it took a shockingly quick amount of time for a skinny, buzzed man to open the door. He glared down at me with hatred, but confusion laden his face.

“The fuck do you want? We’re busy.” He spat. Maybe my only saving grace was the fact that I was bawling, because from over his shoulder, his girlfriend saw me. She looked in as near a shape as I, but as soon as her eyes locked with mine, she hurried over.

“Jeff, shut up, just- Hey, what’s wrong? You live across the hall, right?”

Sniffling, I nodded and turned to look at the door. I didn’t hear anything besides the TV from inside, but he could come out at any moment. I did hear, however, a gasp from the girlfriend.

“Oh my god! Your head!”

“Jesus.” Jeff cringed as I looked back at them. I reached up to the spot where my father had hit me. I felt sick when I saw my hand, my shimmering blood.

“Mallory, I think she’s gotta go, we-”

“We can fucking fight later, Jeff! We need to help this little girl. Sweetie, come inside. Did your daddy hit you? Are you all right?” She reached out and touched my bloody scalp. “Why does it feel like that? When did this happen?”

It was a bit of a blur from there. Jeff relented and didn’t get in the way. I was shocked that my showing up at their door was able to so easily stop their argument. My father had gone over there countless times before to ask them to keep it down, but to no avail.

Mallory sat me down on their couch while Jeff called 911. The whole time, I kept my eyes glued to the door. I kept waiting for my father to burst through. I kept waiting for another strike to the head. I couldn’t even focus on the muck and trash piled up around Jeff and Mallory’s loft. Their couch reeked of cigarettes and old food, but I didn’t care. I’d been somewhere worse. Thoughts of Michael’s sweating recliner filled my mind, and I was happy to be elsewhere. The dampness of it, the shimmering on the arms of the chair. I idly held a cloth to the back of my head to stem the fluid leaking out of me.

When the cops arrived, they took me down to their car. As I walked out into the hall with Mallory behind me, I looked into my home which was being raided by the rest of the police. Inside, my father sat perfectly still on his zabuton. His head pulsed and bubbled with that jelly. His face remained the same way it had for many months, a smile and distant eyes. He didn’t even look at me as they took me away.

I’m writing this to you while my father is in his hospice bed. I was relinquished to the care of CPS after that incident. My mother reluctantly took me back after a long period in court. My father was deemed mentally unfit for trial, or for anything at all. He was put into an assisted living facility about a year after it all happened.

He’s only 65 now. I just had my 21st birthday recently, just a few days after they put him in hospice. They say it’s Alzheimer's. He doesn’t have long. I know that’s not true.

He’s staring at me now with that same expression on his face. I have become so used to it over the years. That smile is almost home. I always return to it. His eyes are glazed over with white, and have been for some time. A form of cataracts, they also say. Another lie. They always tell me his diagnoses with an uncertainty in their voice. I’ve learned to accept it.

I’ve taken up meditation myself in the past few years. It’s helped me deal with everything in my life. I am a happier person now. Despite every connotation it has with my father, there is still worth in it. He does not have to ruin everything. I feel at one with the world, when I can.

This is the first time in a while that I’ve spent any time with my father. I’m sitting in the lazy boy in the corner of his room while he stares at me from his bed. He hasn’t said a word. Neither have I. We already know what each other would say. It’s like it’s programmed into me.

I mentioned earlier that I had found his Blogger page. I found it about a year ago. And I found Michael. He wants me to see him. There was a simple message sent on the same day that I opened the page, about an hour before. It just said,

“Are you coming?”
