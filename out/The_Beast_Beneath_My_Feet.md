 In this story I do bequeath;

A monster of mine who lives beneath;

If you wonder why in lyrical form I write;

It’s a choice, a decision, I don’t give a shite;

Nothing quite scares me more;

Than what I heard from my bedroom door;

Not a subtle tapping light;

But a scream that caused quite a fright;

It was shrill, caused unending dread;

A piercing sound that could wake the dead;

T’was not ghosts or goblins no;

But a familiar voice from down below;

For in my bedroom I was napping;

*Let’s be honest, I was fapping;*

In my head I was surely gone;

In this early hour, dawn;

Tending to my morning wood;

As growing boys surely should;

The wailing beast did startle me up;

I even knocked over a drinking cup;

Rushing to put on my undies tight;

Tucking my shame used all my might;

I knew what lay at the bottom stair;

A witch, a demon, who does not care;

Rubbing my eyes the morning crust scatters;

Beneath my feet I hear its clatters;

Sprinting to the shower I ran;

Faster than a moving fan;

Turning on the water so hot;

Take my time, surely not;

For when I step inside the tub;

There is no moment for proper scrub;

Toweling off done with haste;

For time was something I could not waste;

For at the bottom of the stairs;

Stood a creature without compares;

Wrapped in terry cloth so tight;

Her nest of snakes were quite a sight;

Below her crown, an icy stare did lay;

Don’t look, don’t listen, just run away;

To my room I quickly shot;

Avoiding nearly being caught;

Rushing to be ready fast;

I heard below the threats so cast;

Checking the time, with great fear;

What remained of my schedule, meager and mere;

Grabbing random clothes to wear;

If it matched, I did not care;

One final shout from the witch did come;

The banshee’s shriek did strike me numb;

With this final cast of breath;

The beast did threaten my very death;

In three words, I heard my names;

The pain it caused, it licked like flames;

The first of three it felt so light;

Flightier than a wayward kite;

The last of three, it hurt much more;

Nearly knocking me to the floor;

T’was the second of three that wrought dismay;

My skin so young, she sought to flay;

The middle name is never said;

It’s utterance only brings me dread;

How is it I could hope to fix;

The damage, the pain, an unholy mix;

The fear I feel is without comparison;

I must escape this ghastly garrison;

Quietly opening my bedroom door;

Knowing not what lay in store;

I do so fear she could be waiting;

Her wrath, her fury, *an understating*;

As I ran down the hall;

Left or right I don’t recall;

Free and clear I did feel glee;

Until I fell and scraped my knee;

A rush of pain befell my leg;

“Tears don’t fall,” I humbly beg;

To flee this menacing ghoul I must;

Ignore the danger, and act nonplussed;

The final door opened as planned;

I turn around to take my stand;

Above me still, the beast has spoken;

And hands me but a meager token;

As I close the door without a fuss;

I realized, “Crap!” I  missed my school bus.
