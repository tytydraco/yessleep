***


Thank god I didn’t break any bones.   
   
The shrubby softness of the ravine’s slopes had cushioned enough of my fall. I leaned onto one of the slopes and let the earthy coolness soothe my sore back. Although there would be tenderness on my tailbone and left leg, everything still felt intact. 

Olek had radioed in that he’d found me. I’d given him my headphones and Zoom recorder, which he was now using to review the quality of the last takes.  

“Clean sound,” he nodded with a calm seriousness. 

*Was it clean though?* 

I could faintly hear the squealing whines through the cups of my headphones, but Olek gave no reaction as he pressed the cushions closer to his ears. 

I wondered if he was intentionally trying to come off as unphased. Was he actually trying to be encouraging of my work? Did the pig squealing actually not bother him?  

His entire demeanor felt alien. At times he would meet my eyes, trying to maybe show a glimmer of gratitude, or perhaps sympathy, but it's like he couldn’t get his face to activate the right muscles.    
 

“I’m glad it’s clean.” I croaked out. *Or that at least you think so.* 

After a few minutes of listening, Olek took off the headphones, and offered a massive palm for me to grab. I really didn’t want to leave with him, but I didn’t know what else to do.  

I wouldn’t know where to go on my own without getting further lost in the woods. And the last thing I wanted was to get stuck in a worse ravine, dying of thirst, awaiting bears and cougars to eat me. So I grabbed his arm.  

“Your work is strong,” he said. Then he handed back my gear. 

“Uh … thank you.”  

The ease with which Olek knew how to operate my equipment was a little astonishing. I figured he was probably used to playing multiple roles on set (the curse of many indie films), but after he hooked my boom into my mixer without a moment’s hesitation, another thought crossed my mind. *Maybe he had been expecting me to use the handheld recorder.* 

Maybe he had been *expecting* me to climb up alone in that tree this whole time. Did he somehow know I would be menaced by this ghostly pig?  

I stared at his swirling trench coat as he led the way to an exiting slope. *Was something supposed to happen to me in that tree?* 

He briefly turned around and said, “Don't forget to back up the data on that card. We can't lose it.” 

Then I realized I was dealing with a guy who only cared about his film. That’s why he sent me up that oak. That’s why he didn’t care about my bruises. He truly only cared about his audio. His video. Just a regular self-absorbed dude.  

Stupid as it sounds—that felt relieving. I didn’t want to focus on paranormal, conspiratorial thinking. I just wanted to get out of here. 

— 

With no real option, I followed Olek, limping slightly, just two steps behind. It felt very weird to come back like an obedient sheep, like a patient returned to her psych ward, but what was I supposed to do? Keep shambling through the woods? Pray that I somehow stumbled back to my car? 

Within minutes we were back at the meadow, showing just how little I had actually run.  

As soon as we broke through the forest, Konrad sprinted over, clasping both his palms on my shoulders. "Oh my god Anna! What happened?" 

I appreciated that he had run up. The rest of the crew were still across the meadow, observing distantly, fiddling with tripods and bounce boards. 

I cleared my throat and rubbed my aching left knee. “I fell into a ditch Kon. Olek got me out.” 

Perhaps sensing I needed time alone with the only proper English speaker—Olek dismissed Konrad and continued to the others. 

Konrad said something in Polish, but then immediately turned to me. “Are you injured? Are you like… okay?” 

My limbs were sore but that wasn’t the main problem. “I’m okay, but … no, not really, I'm not okay. I don't feel comfortable right now about any of this.” I gestured at the crew, the woods, the gray clouds and turned to whispering. “I can’t be here. Something fucked is going on.” 

“What do you mean?”  

I didn’t really know where to start. I sort of tossed my arms, grasping for the easiest explanation, and so I pointed to the tree. “I heard some demonic sounds in my headphones when I was up there.” 

Konrad glanced back at the oak in the meadow's center.  

“And then when I looked down, Polina was gone. Only her shredded clothes were left.” 

Konrad took a pause. "Well … that’s because Polina's wrapped. We finished her scene, so she left." 

“Yes but … ” I emphasized the strangeness. “She left so *abruptly,* I didn’t even see her leave.” 

“Well … you were up in the tree Anna, I don’t think you would be able to see her leave.” 

I definitely thought I would have, but I let it go. “Well the demonic thing I heard, it sounded like an animal. It attacked Polina.” 

“Attacked her?” 

“Attacked, and then, well … it *ate* her.” 

“Ate her?” 

I held on to the sides of my head. My mixer was still dangling from my neck on a lanyard. “Yes, *ate* her! There was a slurping and crunching of some fucking animal that I recorded on my mixer. It sounded like Polina was being mauled.”   
   
I placed my headphones on Konrad’s head and played the last sound file I recorded.  

With the volume turned high, I could make out the shrieks quite vividly. 

Kon seemed put off but kept listening to it. “What? You recorded *this?* Is the file corrupted or—?” 

“—No. Even the director signed off on this! He listened and gave approval!” As I said the words, I realized how fucked that was. Olek had literally listened to this file in the ravine and said: ‘*clean sound.’* 

Konrad looked skeptical. “Are you sure you didn't misunderstand him? I know Olek's English—” 

“No! I understood him perfectly fine. That's the recording he wanted. It was some kind of boar, and it was attacking Polina.” 

Kon held onto the headphones intently and nodded. “Are you sure it's not just some weird artifacting? Is the SD card malfunctioning or—” 

“—The SD card is totally unused.” 

“Right.” He handed the headphones back. “I mean, that doesn’t mean it can’t glitch.” 

I crossed my arms. *I’ve never heard of a new card glitching.* 

“Also, I was with the crew,” Kon pointed over his shoulder. “We were watching Polina and the tree the whole time. I didn’t see any animal, boar, or anything.” 

I pointed at the pile of rags still resting by the tree "then what about all the blood on her clothes? How did they get shredded?” 

"Well, I mean we're shooting a horror, Anna. That was all makeup and—." 

"—I didn't see any makeup team come over!" 

"That's cause you were up in the—” 

“—DON’T SAY I WAS UP IN THE TREE!” 

I yelled and could feel myself lose a bit of control. Olek and some of the crew glanced back from across the field. I ignored them.  

“Kon, listen. Something rammed that tree and knocked me down. That’s what made me run.” 

He looked at me but said nothing. 

“There was this terrible pig shrieking in my headphones the whole time, and I *swear* I saw a big black boar run toward me for a second. That’s why I ran.” 

Hands raised, Kon made eye contact with me and nodded with as much politeness as I had ever seen him muster. “Listen Anna, I’m not discounting whatever it is that you saw. Or heard. I totally respect that. Clearly something scared you. I feel you.” 

“No. Kon you’re not listening to me. Something fucked is going on. I don’t know what it is, but I want nothing to do with it.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“I mean I'm not working on this set any more. There’s something wrong. I’m going home." 

I started marching forward, but Konrad moved in front of me. "Woah woah, Anna, hold up. I get it. I would feel the same way. But come on, you can't go home. We still have a couple more shots to get.” 

I handed him the microphone. "Then you can record the rest yourself. Go ahead, you mix and boom.” 

“If you leave, how am I supposed to get home? They don't have room in their car." 

"Then ride across their laps." 

"Anna please." Konrad’s voice got quiet. "I don't want to be embarrassed in front of these guys. They make amazing horror movies, like Polish A24 level shit. My previous boom op fell through. I just need you to at least stick it through the rest of the day." 

I glanced over at the mobilizing crew; they had packed everything back into carrying cases. They almost looked like a normal film team, like any typical heads of department I’d seen on set of *District PD* or *Untold Stories of the ER,* but they were wearing so much black, so much leather and had so many piercings. Their entire vibe felt *off.* 

"I agree that there is a … creepiness,” Konrad lowered his voice further. “Olek is able to cultivate an amazing atmosphere, and I think it's why his films are always so strong. He brings a realness. A sort of raw element that’s hard to explain. And obviously that can result in some eerie coincidences on set, for sure. But remember: it is just a movie*.* This is just a regular forest ... we’re just here to do a job.” 

*It feels like something is legit haunted,* I wanted to say, but I held my tongue.  

"Just stay a few more hours. You can stick by me for the rest of the shoot. If something requires weird booming, I’ll do it. If there's another tree situation, I'll volunteer. Whatever it takes to make you comfortable. Please. For me.” 

The emotion was genuine, and despite the urgency in his voice, Konrad had let go of my arm, to show that he wasn’t trying to impede me or something. But I was still annoyed. Furious in fact, that he had tricked me into working on this janky set with a flippant director.  

I considered just leaving, just trying to head back towards the parking lot. But the thing was, I didn’t know how to navigate back. I actually needed Konrad to help return to the car.  

I sighed, groaned, and rubbed my left knee. “Goddamnit Kon. Why’d you mix me up in this? I told you I only work big shows now.” 

“I know, but …” He put his hands in his pockets, looked at the ground. “This could become a big deal for me. I told Olek I would get a sound assistant. I didn't think this would be such an ordeal. Please … ” 

The rest of the crew had now gathered all their stuff and were walking along the perimeter of the meadow, probably moving to the next location. There was the faint outline of the sun behind the overcast sky. It had risen ever so slightly, brightening the world just a little bit. 

"Oh my god. Fuck. Fine. Fuck you.” I pointed directly at Kon’s skittish face. “But you listen to me: If anything else weird happens, and I mean *anything* off in the slightest, promise that you won't question me, and that you'll take me straight back to the car. I don’t want any second-guessing or hesitation, okay?" 

"Yes. Of course.” Konrad held out his arm. “I swear on my mother’s grave.” 

I stared at his pupils. He looked earnest, and eager to maintain eye contact. Then I looked at his open palm. The fingers were slowly stretching towards me, seeking confirmation. 

I handed him the boom pole. “The next shot is yours. I’m not booming.” 

“Sure. That’s no problem.” 

“And I want to know exactly how many shots are left.” 

“We can ask the AD.” 

“And I want you to admit right now: that this is weird. That it's not cool you’ve roped me into this. And that you’re a fucking idiot.” 

“Yes. Yes, you’re right. I’m wrong. I’m a fucking idiot.” 

I hated this. I did not feel comfortable. But I needed a guide out. I needed Kon to be agreeable. Like with so many other annoying things about the film industry (the hours, the nepotism, the sexism, to name a few), there comes a time when you just have to grin and bear it. Pretend it doesn’t bother you and get through it.  

I rubbed my knee one last time, and then ignored the soreness as I continued to walk. *Pretending is what I do best.* 

— 

We set up for lunch by some logs near the meadow’s edge, using gear cases as tables. Konrad had advocated that we could use a reset (which I appreciated), and thankfully no one was opposed to an early snack. Most of the crew members had skipped their breakfast. 

Over sandwiches, I focused on relaxing. I wanted this to be just a normal set. I didn’t want to be in panic mode the whole time. 

So, I bit the bullet and apologized to the crew. I didn’t want them judging me for the rest of the day. I stood up in the middle of their eating circle and said I was sorry. In response, The AD came and patted my back, telling me not to worry, and that apologies were unnecessary. 

Everyone came to understand that I had had a panic attack, but now I was okay. They were respecting that. Everyone acknowledged that the woods were dark, and it is of course very easy to see things that aren’t there. It is reasonable to get afraid. 

“In the forest,” the makeup artist said, “it is natural to be scared.” 

“Yes, it is very natural,” I said. Then I sat back into my own corner. 

My sandwich was packed with lentils just like Konrad had said. In fact, they had made two huge sandwiches just for me, which I was grateful for because my body was craving energy.  

Even though I wanted to inhale the food, I paced myself. I ate as normally as I would on any other occasion, because the more I acted like everything was fine, the more mentally everything *felt* fine. 

I made small talk. 

I stretched my legs. 

I asked Kon what this movie was even about. 

“Oh, it's a Polish folklore film.” He spoke in-between bites. "It's about scary things in the forest." 

“Like scary things … attacking Polina?” 

“Sort of. Polina plays Północnica. ‘Lady Midnight’” 

“Lady Midnight?” 

“Yes. She is a ghost in Polish folklore. A wraith who will try and possess your body.” 

I chewed and wondered how Polina’s cowering and wailing was supposed to make her a possessive wraith. “She seems more like a victim to me.” 

“That’s because she is.” Kon wiped his mouth. “This film is her origin story. Before she became Północnica, she was just a regular woman. A regular villager who made a bad deal with the devil, who then cursed her to wander the earth as a wraith.” 

I nodded as if this was common knowledge. “You’ve read the script?” 

“No. I know it from childhood. My mom used to warn me not to wander into the backcountry by myself, or else I risk meeting Lady Midnight. Who would then kidnap me, usurp my body, etcetera etcetera.” 

“Right.” I grabbed another napkin and looked at the rest of the crew. They were all eating two huge sandwiches, if not more. I could smell the tangy waft of horseradish, mustard, and spicy sausage. Olek looked like he was annoyed that we were on break. 

“And so … why did this crew fly all the way here?” I whispered. “Why shoot some Polish folk tale—in Vancouver?” 

"Oh, I think the producer is half-Canadian. And he was able to secure some funding here. Something like that." 

*What funding?* I wanted to say. *I've seen high school films with higher budgets.* But I chewed my lentils and stayed quiet. 

We tossed all our crumpled wax paper and empty water bottles into a portable trash. *At least they got that much right.* 

After enjoying a fruit bar as a dessert, I could actually feel myself winding down. My heart was no longer beating in my throat, the butterflies in my stomach were gone.  

Relishing the feeling, I unwrapped a stick of gum—and then came the rustling. 

Everyone paused and looked towards a set of bushes. 

It was hard to articulate why, but even through the leaves, I could tell it was something walking on hooves. There was something padded about the movement. And maybe it was just me, but I could swear I heard a soft, ineffable *oinking* in the distance. 

The crew sprang into action, locking the camera to its tripod within seconds. Konrad jumped up and grabbed my boom with a look that said: *I’ll take this one.*  

Everyone aimed in the direction of the foliage, trying to capture whatever lurked. Olek glued himself to the viewfinder, zooming and adjusting the camera all himself. Konrad fully extended the boom and swung it around, trying to capture the sounds of whatever approached. 

At the base of the bushes, I could see Polina’s gray rags lying splayed on the ground—*was that intentional?* *Were the rags supposed to lure something?* 

For a moment, everyone went still. It felt like the entire wilderness had gone silent. A quiet wind lightly teased some branches. Olek turned both of his palms upward, as if he was holding something, or receiving something. *Summoning something?* 

There came a growl, and everyone lowered their heads, looking for the source. Konrad got a little too animated and swung his boom pole right at Olek's temple. 

Olek lashed out with one of his massive arms, which clipped the camera beside him, sending it straight to the ground. The bushes shuffled one more time, and then the pig, (or moose, or whatever it was) could be heard trailing away, breaking into a trot.  

Olek brought the camera right up to his face, and aggressively clicked around the viewfinder’s touch screen. “Nie! Nie!”  He slapped the device, as if he could rewind it to the moment before the opportunity was lost.  

He waved his arms, trying to attract whatever energy had just dissipated, then stepped past the camera to face the bushes. “No kurwa mać!”  

Like an angry child, Olek poked his head into the leaves and began batting at them, “Konrad ty pierdol! Ale to spieprzyłeś!” 

Konrad’s eyes turned wide and quivering, he tried to withdraw into some reality where the take had not been ruined. Olek approached him with a slung back hand, ready to release some retributive slap. But after a tense moment, the only release was a torrent of spit on Kon’s face as Olek yelled and yelled and yelled. 

Still sitting, I inched away on the log, afraid of what the director might do next. Even the rest of the crew took a few steps back. 

As quickly as the tantrum started, Olek exhaled and dismissed Konrad, clearly unable to bear another glance.  

Konrad snuck away, pretending to fiddle with the knobs on his mixer. Everyone looked at each other, but mostly at the ground. Some ravens cawed in the distance. 

I was very glad it wasn't me who messed up. 

— 

With the afternoon came a powerful silence. You could hear squirrels scampering up trees, and woodpeckers drilling somewhere far, far away. The previously conversational crew, who would swap comments and observations for lively stretches of time, were now replaced by a band of servants who quickly nodded at whatever the director said. 

I asked Konrad what exactly Olek had been trying to shoot earlier, and “how did everyone know to record the bushes?” Kon sighed and said that they were just looking for wilderness B roll. Olek had been trying to capture a deer on camera all week. 

Without wasting time, the AD filled the silence. Our next shots were a series of POVs meant to simulate Polina running through the woods. The director would be handling the camera. 

Trying to compensate for his screw up, Kon made sure we were ready first. We fastened a set of wireless mics directly to the camera, which was then mounted inside a rig that resembled a detached steering wheel. A makeshift Steadicam. 

Rolling back the sleeves of his trench coat, Olek lifted the steering wheel and strode through the woods by himself, recording a shaky blur of trees, branches, and gloom. The rest of us huddled behind a monitor, watching the resulting footage, whispering only when necessary. 

The cautious silence was definitely a change in tone, but it didn’t bother me. Previously I had felt like the odd one out. The Canadian fish that had slipped into some foreign Euro-Slavic pond. But now it felt like we were all in this together, we were all waiting for this manic director to blow off steam by galloping through the trees. 

The footage didn’t look great (in my opinion). It was a glorified go-pro shot with a bad frame rate. The sound wasn’t much better. Kon and I both exchanged wide eyes listening to Olek’s grunts and groans as he trampled over the forest floor. 

“Polish A24 huh?” I whispered in between takes. 

“Maybe not this part,” Konrad shrugged, trying to play it off ... “we’ll fix it in post.” 

It took about an hour of Olek trying to get some fern branches to *‘brush the lens in just the right way’* but eventually the plants seemed to oblige. He returned triumphant, lifting the camera above his head (as if it weighed nothing). Then he cleared the blonde strands clinging to the sweaty sides of his face, revealing a wicked smile.  

“Okej. Running shot done. Now our final location.” 

Olek gave the AD a high five and the spirits of the crew lifted slightly. Even I was starting to feel a sliver of cheer. *Final location? Already? Does that mean we’re almost done?* 

“No more mistakes,” Olek pointed at Konrad, handing the camera away to some crew. 

Kon said nothing. 

— 

Of course, getting to our final spot wasn’t so easy. The last shot required us to march much deeper into the forest, which reignited all the paranoia I was trying to rid myself of.  

The pine trees grew taller and darker. The bird calls became deeper and raspier. 

To ease my mind, I sidled right next to the AD at the front, to watch how he was navigating our misfit convoy. He smiled and showed me a pocket-sized GPS. It had a bright screen depicting a flag icon which we were nearing labelled ‘*wieża.’* 

I asked him what it meant, and he just pointed ahead and said: ”Very soon.” 

Despite the manifold branches and shadowy canopy, I could see a thin strip of metal gleam in the trees. In a few minutes we were approaching some long-abandoned radio tower that sat deep in the wilderness. This was the *wieża.* 

*Why was it built so far from civilization?* As we climbed up the bramble-filled incline, I could make out a dwelling at its base and realized this must have been some outpost. *A weather monitoring station?* 

The trees opened up and I could see we were in the midst of a relic. A two floored cabin that had faced the ravages of time and lost. 

On its left side, the walls were built into the legs of the iron tower, which were now completely covered in vines and guarding a nest of abandoned firewood. The rest of the cabin was log-built, which gave it a pioneer feel, except the whole thing was caked in a bed of moss. Like it had sprouted out of the ground. I tried to look in, but the windows were completely boarded up (and also covered in more moss). 

It had to be the most overgrown thing I’d ever seen. 

“We think it used to be some kind of forest ranger outpost,” Konrad said. “But it has long been abandoned. Pretty sweet location huh?” 

When we reached its vicinity, I pressed a finger into the cabin's exterior and felt the moss travel past my knuckles. It was remarkable that something so sturdy was abandoned like this. I would guess up to four people could have stayed here, living off camp supplies. *How long was it used for?* 

“We must get coverage.” Olek announced, gesturing vaguely at the scenery. “Camera and sound. I want to capture it all.” 

The crew got to work, opening all the carrying cases. I whispered to Kon. “So are we like shooting a scene or … ?” 

“No. Not really,” Konrad turned on his mixer, and started playing with the levels. “Environmental shots, we’re just recording the feel of this place.” 

*Recording the feel?* It sounded a bit vague, but I shrugged. I wasn’t about to question the experimental process of our genius director. 

— 

Unlike the running POVs which were shot rather quickly, Olek allowed ample time for the cabin’s cinematography. The DP alternated lenses and tripod heights until he found the perfect frames that evoked the ominous allure of this place.  

It felt more like we were making art. 

Konrad and I circumnavigated the house, calling for silence when we needed it. Our mics picked up the buzzing of local bugs, the faint squeaking of chipmunks and even a couple of owls which must’ve prematurely woken up. 

I didn’t know if I wanted to admit it, but it was actually *kind of fun*.  

On ninety nine percent of sets you record the same dialogue for hours. You’re competing with plane sounds and traffic sirens. You’ve got bitchy actors, entitled crew, indecisive directors, and rushed schedules that sap all the magic out of filmmaking. But here, in the middle of the woods, Me and Konrad just spent five minutes recording the rich, textural creak of an ancient cabin door. Olek was giving Kon the dead eye, but our recordings were still fully approved. 

After an hour of capturing the surroundings, the AD called for a break. 

The team turned to discussing how to shoot the interior, which was a technical conversation (all in Polish), so I focused on readying our gear.  

As far as I knew, no one had brought any mobile lighting kits, so I wasn’t sure how they actually planned to shoot inside. We would have to spend an hour scouring mulch off glass for any natural light. And I wasn’t signing up for that job. 

As if reading my mind, the AD approached me with an encouraging smile. He was clearly going to ask me to do something stupid. I took my time opening the package of fresh batteries, lined up the negative and positive charges in my mic, twice to be sure. 

“Hello Anna, thank you so much for coming out today.” 

“No problem. Give me a second.” 

I did the same thing with my other microphone, double checking everything. If he was going to waste my time, I would waste his.  

“How would you like to be in this film?” 

I paused. “*Be* in this film? What do you mean?” 

“Do you want to be actress?” 

Without even intending to, my jaw dropped a little. I was not expecting this.  

“No. Sorry. I don’t want to be an actress.” 

The AD didn’t push it any further. He went back to the circle of crew and spoke with Olek. The director said some things, pulled Konrad aside, and then Konrad walked over to me. 

Before he could open his mouth, I raised my hand. “Um, I’m not acting in this movie.” 

“Who said anything about acting?” Konrad smiled, laughed a small laugh. “No no, nobody wants you to act. There’s just one particular shot they want to get. You see, technically speaking, this cabin is meant to be the birthplace of Północnica.” 

“Pół—You mean Polina’s character?” 

“Yeah. We’re getting shots of her home here as a flashback element. But Olek thinks it would be good to also get the back of the character’s head and profile, as she looks through her old house.” 

*Is that what we’ve been shooting? Some experimental flashback?* “So, why was Polina wrapped earlier then?” 

“It was an oversight. Now Olek thinks adding a Polina stand-in would be clutch.” 

“Well, I’m sorry. I don’t want to be a stand in.” I looked at the mossy cabin, at the gaping black hole of the half open door. “Can’t Olek like … shoot Polina on a green screen?” 

“No, no, come on, Anna, Olek doesn’t do that. He’s all practical. You have the same length of black hair. You’re about the same height. It’s just for one shot.” 

“No Kon. I don’t want to do it.” 

“You can think of it as an apology for getting you wrapped up in this. Olek will give you a day rate for acting.” 

“What?”   
   
“And I’ll give you half my day’s wage on top of that. Compensation for leaving you in that tree.” 

“What the hell. Why?” 

Konrad lowered his voice and brought his hands into a small prayer. “Please. I want this film to be a success. I want to be hired by these guys again. I’ve kept my word haven’t I?” 

“What word?” 

“That I’d act as a shield. Prevent you from doing anything uncomfortable.” 

“Kon. *This* is making me feel uncomfortable.” 

“But it’s the last thing! After this we’re done! We’ll go straight back to the car.” 

I looked over the rest of the crew. The DP was waving his arms, explaining something to Olek who was nodding with minimal effort. Then Olek turned and looked directly at me. His gray eyes shimmered with focus that prevented mine from leaving. A hawk spying a mouse. 

I did a full one eighty and faced the cabin. Konrad came over, hands still pleading, voice still a whisper. “I’ll even pay for your gas! For here and back—” 

“—Listen Kon. Whatever pickup shot this is. It's the last thing I’m doing. Then we’re leaving.” 

“So … is that a yes?”  

“Get the AD to announce I am leaving right after this. You’re taking me straight back to my car.” 

“Sure. Yeah I can do that.” 

“And tell Olek I’m only doing one take.” 

Konrad scratched the back of his neck; he looked over at the director. “Only one? But what if we need—” 

“—I’m only doing one. That’s it. One and I’m out. If we need another that's your problem, you deal with Olek.” 

“Okay. Okay, sure that’s fine. I’ll figure it out. Thank you Anna. Thank you so much.” 

He gave me a hug. I stayed facing the cabin. 

— 

The makeup artist combed and sprayed my hair to match the wavy raggedness of Polina’s. She wasn’t very talkative but did mention I had pretty hair—naturally silky, and that it was easy to manipulate. Very easy to manipulate. 

The AD had announced that this was going to be my last shot, just as Kon promised, and that I would be escorted as soon as we were done. It also meant my makeup artist had to triple check her work with a dozen brushes and wedges. 

According to her, I looked “fabularna” (which must’ve meant “fable-like”). I responded with probably the meekest smile in my life. 

Although shredded at the skirt, the upper half of Polina’s dress was still fully intact, and so I was allowed to change into it behind the cabin. No one came to supervise.  

As I left, I could hear the echoes of the crew arguing. Olek was criticizing Konrad again over something. I ignored it.  

For the first time since picking up Kon this morning, I was completely by myself. I took a moment to assess the whole situation.  

This was it. Just me, by myself. In the middle of the woods with a bunch of strangers and a single friend from film school who gaffed my fourth year short. *He was an alright gaffer, I guess.* 

Like honestly, I trust Konrad and think he’s a decent guy. He helped me land some of my first gigs out of film school. But those gigs were always weird. 

He’d always be doing sound on music videos between half a dozen heavy metal bands I’d never heard of. All of them paid in cash. There was always a DP who would smoke weed in-between takes, or band members who always arrived late. I’ll never forget the day we wasted a whole afternoon on an insert of live snake as it slithered across sound speakers, our film gear, and then all the way into a kitchen cupboard. It was not a planned shot. 

But despite the bullshit, I always did get paid. At a crucial point in my life too. I always felt like I owed Kon for that. It was a legitimate steppingstone for me. 

*Breathe. You’ve got this.* 

I stripped down to basically my underwear—relinquishing the cover and warmth of my trusty jeans, and oversized hoodie. 

*Christ it is cold. This dress is damp as hell.* 

I put my jeans back on. They’re only shooting from the waist up anyway. Considering the sudden windchill, it was something like two degrees outside. 

*Just five minutes of standing in the cold. You’ve had worse. Pretend you’re fine.*  

*Pretending is what I’m good at.* 

I walked back over, holding a bundle of my previous clothes. The camera was set up, pointing into the open maw of the cabin.  

The AD stood by the door, acting as a proxy for where I would be standing. “You’re still wearing your pants,” he said. 

“Is that a problem?” I pointed to my waist and raised my finger until it reached my disinterested face. “I thought this was a medium.” 

There was some muttering behind the camera. Olek seemed upset, but Konrad’s voice won out. “That’s fine, we can make that work right? It’s only one shot.” 

Olek stepped out from behind the crew, looking unimpressed with the world at large. He waved his hand dismissively at the AD. He clearly didn’t care about my pants. *Good.* 

“Alright, so you want me to open this door and stare into the cabin, right?” I stood in front of the cabin and gripped the handle. The handle was slimy with moss, and very cold from the sudden windiness around us. The hinges on the door itself were remarkably intact, so despite some creaky resistance, I managed to push it shut without much hassle. Then, flexing my arm a little, I pulled and opened the door again, pretending to look inside and recognize my beloved old home.  

My beloved—*completely pitch black*—old home. 

“Like this? Does that work?” *I will give them this one take, and I will do it well—so everything is firmly over and done with.* 

The wind was causing my hair to whip back and forth, I calmly adjusted it back in place. “Any changes or can we just slate this already?” 

The camera raised slightly, and Konrad found a new spot for his boom over my head. 

“Another rehearsal,” Olek said. “Go again.” 

I carefully returned the door to its closed position, and then went back to my starting mark on the ground. I should have told Konrad: *max two rehearsals.* For all I knew, Olek was going to get me to rehearse this over and over, and secretly record a dozen takes. It was the oldest trick in the book. 

*Whatever, give him the rehearsals.* 

Again, I flexed my right arm, lifted the handle, and pulled with that slight trepidation I’ve seen all actors do as they enter any place of plot significance.  

*Oooh what could be inside? Oh my gosh, it looks like the actor is realizing something!* I stiffened my shoulder and then craned my neck inside. 

And then I did in fact realize something. *Why is the wind so strong?*  

It felt like a geyser of air was slowly blowing harder and harder. 

I turned around to adjust, to brace myself against the door, when suddenly a blast of air thrust me forward. 

My hands barely broke my fall. 

Before I could make a sound—before I could even look up—*SLAM*!  

The door had sealed me inside.  

All light had vanished. 

I quickly got up, ignoring the pain in my arms and yelled toward the door. “Hey! Hello! HELLO!” 

The wind howled against the cabin. 

I moved forward and found the door by the handle. I tried to push, but it felt like there was a wall on the other side. I couldn’t even budge it a little.  

“Hello! Can you open up? Hello?!” 

I pushed with my arm, my foot, and my back. Then I banged my fists right above the handle. 

*Goddamnit. Can they not hear me? Why is the door jammed?* 

I took deep breaths, my paranoia spilled out. Butterflies tickled my stomach and flew into my head. My heart bounced between my lungs. I pivoted on the ancient wooden floor, feeling dirt twist beneath my sneakers. 

*Don’t panic. There’s just a gale outside. They must all be disoriented.* Although it had no bars, my phone still made a decent flashlight. 

I lit up a floor covered with twigs and dirt. There was a cot on the far side, next to some broken shelves and a cluttered table. A couple plastic coolers lay all over the floor. 

I looked around for another door on the opposite side of the cabin. *Please tell me I overlooked one. There’s gotta be one there!*  

Of course there was none.  

Then I discovered a ladder which led up to the tiny attic floor. If I was really desperate, I could maybe break through one of the upper windows, and cry for help or something. 

But before I could plan my route, the door swung open again. It clipped my already sore leg. 

Down on the floor, I reached out to the sudden blast of outdoor light. A large shape was tossed onto me, pinning me to the ground. Judging by the smell of the deodorant: it was Kon. 

“Hey! Hold the door!” I shouted. 

But the sliver of light vanished faster than I could get up. 

“What the hell!” I tossed Konrad off of me, confused and angry at what was going on. I grabbed my phone light off the floor. “Kon, is that you!?” 

It was, but he didn’t look to be moving. He was still wearing his large Sennheiser headphones, and he was awkwardly cradling a boom between his arms. I rolled him over onto his back, and that’s when I saw it. 

A tear at his throat. A large bloody rip of missing flesh. It was soaked in red. 

*Fuck. What the fuck. What in god's name is [happening](https://www.reddit.com/r/EclosionK2/).*
