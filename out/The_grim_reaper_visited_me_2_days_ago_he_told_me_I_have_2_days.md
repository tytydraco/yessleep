There’s a folktale in my small town, that the reaper will warn you of your death. I thought it was some prank at first. Someone rang the doorbell and I went to look through the peephole. A figure dressed in pitch black robes stood outside my door, he must’ve been at least 6 feet tall.

“2 days.” he rasped in a demonic voice, the sound coming from all directions simultaneously. I covered my ears trying to drown the agonizing sounds out. And then he was gone. Both the sound and the figure.

I didn’t even know what to think, was it a prank? Was someone messing with me? Gouging out if I really believed that stupid tale? Or was he really the reaper himself? I wasn’t sure if he had a scythe, shouldn’t the reaper have a scythe? I let out a loud sigh, my heartbeat finally receding. *It was just a prank.* I told myself, and went on with my plans for the day.

However, it was not just a prank, because he visited me again the following day, this time the figure stood in the doorway to my bedroom as I lay in bed in the morning. “A day.” he rasped once more, the sound louder than the last time, almost deafening. I closed my eyes and put a pillow over my head.

The sound stopped shortly after just like last time, and the figure disappeared too.

I needed to figure out what was going on and if I could stop him. That day I went to the local library and began searching for folk books, history of our little town. A library, old fashioned, I know, the problem was however, our town isn’t very modernized, so the information I was looking for wouldn’t be found on the net.

I asked the nice book keeper where the folk tales are held and went on my way to find the one I was looking for. “The warning of the reaper.” was the title of the book.

It told a story of a young woman being visited by a tall figure in black robes and a hood over its head, omitting any facial features from being seen. “7 days.” He had warned the woman, and returned every single day to remind her of her remaining time, until the day of the collection.

“Your time is up, give up your soul and move to the afterlife.” he ordered the woman, but she was young and stubborn, and not willing to accept his gifts. “I’m not yet old, reaper, come back when I’m 50 years old and ready to go.” The woman pleaded. “Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.” The reaper replied. “You won’t fool me twice.” And he took her soul by force, in the most painful way imaginable.

What a twisted tale, I thought to myself. His gift is the warning, and he wants your soul in return.

“Oh that’s a famous folktale in our little town.” The librarian startled me from behind.

“Do you know anyone that has gotten his warning?” I asked the elderly woman, and she looked up to the ceiling, in thought. “I have seen him dear.” She said with a solemn expression. “He visited me once, a long time ago.” She took a seat beside me and took my hands in hers. “You saw him too, didn’t you?”

“But how did you survive?” I was desperate for answers.

“I tricked him, dear.” She nodded to herself, as if reminiscing about sour memories.“Tricked him, how?” This was the key, if only she would tell me.“I’m afraid that won’t help you dear, he realized he’d been tricked, and he won’t let the same trick work twice.” She stood, releasing my hands from hers.

“That’s all I can tell you, find your own trick to pull so he doesn’t harvest your soul.”

She turned and started walking away, but I could swear I saw her grinning as she did.

A sigh escaped my lips as I stood up and put the book away.

Well if I was going to die, at least I'll pop my cherry.

I went straight home and attempted to seduce multiple men online, but as mentioned before, this little town is not technologically advanced, so I found no match. Next best bet was going to a bar, it was already late and the reaper always visited me at 8AM, meaning I had a little under 10 hours.

“Well aren’t you a pretty thing?” A bulky short man said from behind me, and I gave him a smile, he sat down beside me. “2 Martini’s, one for me, one for the pretty lady here.”

He definitely wasn’t the most attractive, but he’ll have to suffice. After filling him up until early morning, keeping myself as sober as possible, I offered him to come to my place, which he didn’t decline. I had to basically carry him up the stairs as he was too drunk to walk himself.

I unlocked my apartment and walked in, laying him down on the sofa, he was out cold.

I gathered the necessary things and got down to work.

First I laid out the tarp so the mess would be easier to clean up, then I rolled him over onto the tarp and plugged in my power saw, yes this fresh college drop out had some fancy tools. I was quite craftsy.

As the saw roared to life, so did the man who’s name I never got. “What are you doing?” He asked, groaning. I put the saw to his neck and it cut right in, the blood splattered all over the apartment, and on me, hell, I needed to tarp up the whole fucking apartment. The mess upset me, but I had to continue. The man still tried to breathe and get away, he was gurgling up blood. I shushed him as the saw finished cutting off his head.

I just sat there, feeling the excitement tingling my very bones.

An hour later, the reaper appeared. “Your time is up, give up your soul and move to the afterlife.” I grinned at him and pointed at the bloody mess down on the ground. “You can take his soul instead."

The reaper stood motionless for a long moment. “5 years,” he rasped. “That’s plenty of time, next time you'll get you something better.” I replied.
