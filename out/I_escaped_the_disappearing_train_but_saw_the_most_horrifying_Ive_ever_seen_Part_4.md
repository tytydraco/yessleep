“Kill me?”  
  
It was like time stopped. From the small amount of time I’d met the man, I knew that he was crazy enough to be serious. Am I…dead?  
  
Of course I’m not, this happened two years ago, but still. I was frozen with fear. After escaping from those monsters, I thought I’d die by the hands of a human. How ironic.  
  
But the man didn’t kill me. He stopped and laughed at my fear.  
  
My fear turned into confusion. What is he doing?  
  
“My god, you really are a rookie here!” he yelled between laughs.  
  
I considered running. But my feet wouldn’t move from the place they were planted on.  
  
“Hey kid, don’t worry about it. I know you’re not a Burrower. I believe you now.” He stopped for a brief moment. “Well? Aren’t you going to ask how I know?”  
  
I really did want to know, but I stayed silent, thinking about whether I should ask him or not. It didn’t matter because he started speaking a second later.  
  
“Everyone who spends enough time here knows there’s only two ways to die here.” “One!” he said, holding up a finger, “the first way to die here is by entering. When I got on the train here, there was someone not in their seat when the train entered. They died instantly. Two!” he held up another finger, “the second way to die here is by being caught by the Watchers. Even if I wanted to kill you, I wouldn’t be able to. There is no way for me to even break your skin.”  
  
I thought back to what he said earlier. “So then this one-eyed-Nancy you’re talking about,” I thought aloud, then trailed off.  
  
The man shrugged. “My guess is she came in with one eye. That or the rumors are false. I haven’t seen her myself, so I can’t confirm them myself. According to the rumors,” for the first time, he lowered his voice, “One-eyed-Nancy is a traitor human who sided with the Watchers. Whenever she finds a human, she captures them and alerts the Watchers.”  
  
Every time he finishes his explanation, I have many more questions. “What are the ‘Watchers’ and how does she alert them?”  
  
The man’s eyes went wide. “How did you get this far and not see the Watchers? They shapeshift on Earth, so they look like normal people, such as the nice conductor who collected your ticket. But make no mistake. They are monsters, and their true look reflects as much. As for how she can alert them-”  
  
I cut him off accidentally. “I have met them. I just didn’t know they were called Watchers. Why are they called Watchers?” I shuddered. I had definitely met them earlier.  
  
The man held up his wrist. On it was a beautiful gold bracelet with the name “Kaleb Lastraught” engraved on it. I later found out it was his name. “I was getting to it. Our tracking devices can track our location, and can also be used for communication with the Watchers if you touch it. This is one-eyed-Nancy’s greatest weapon. It’s impossible to take off--believe me, I’ve tried--and you can’t take your arm off either. Remember, the only thing that can break your skin is the Watchers. And if the Watchers have you, you’re already dead.” He looked at my wrist. “Wait, why do you not have one?”  
  
Kaleb’s eyes turned wide. “I’ve never seen someone without a tracking device. How?” Now it was he who was asking the questions. I felt for some reason that if I answered the question I would lose something. I still didn’t fully trust the person standing in front of me.  
  
“Hold on,” I said, pointing to him, “How do I know you aren’t one of the Watchers?”  
  
Kaleb made a gasp of indignation, then thought. “I’ve never heard of Watchers disguising themselves as humans in this world, but I suppose it might be possible. However, since I’m the one with the tracking device, you are the one who is much more likely to be the Watcher in disguise. Who knows, maybe you were scared I would kill you because Watchers could actually die at the hands of hum--.”  
  
At that exact moment, his tracking device glowed a bright yellow. It started saying a random assortment of sounds. Loudly.  
  
“What’s happening?” I asked. I’m not sure what would be more worrying, if Kaleb was completely calm as his tracking device went haywire, or what he was currently like, which was total confusion.  
  
“I--don’t know.”  
  
The gold bracelet tracking device kept saying things in a language that I didn’t understand at first. But then…  
  
A little fun fact about me is I grew up in Armenia. I moved to the US when I was about 12 years old. I used to be terrible at English until I was about 15. However, nowadays I’ve spent so much time in the United States I barely remember Armenian. I’ve never really realized that over time I’ve lost my ability to speak the Armenian language partially. I don’t have any existing family who lives in Armenia, so I’ve never really gone back to my home country.  
  
Just because I have lost some of the ability to speak Armenian, doesn’t mean I don’t remember anything or any Armenian words. I suddenly recognized what Kaleb’s bracelet was saying. I realized it must’ve been saying the same thing in many different languages. I didn’t know exactly what was being said, but I recognized it enough that I got the general just of it with context clues.  
  
They’re going to everyone and questioning if they’ve seen a man who doesn’t have a tracking device.  
  
When I told Kaleb what the message was, I could see his dark face drain of color.  
  
“Get out of here.” was all he said.  
  
I didn’t have to be told twice. But still, a stupid part of me decided to stay near the area so I could hear what was happening.  
  
I took off further in the woods, further away from the river (and even further away from the train tracks). I doubled back and stopped behind a tree, panting.  
  
From here, I could faintly hear Kaleb’s bracelet. Once my breathing returned to normal, I could hear something else, too.  
  
But then, Kaleb let out a scream. It was simultaneous with the most sickening crunch sound I’ve ever heard.  
  
I ran back from where Kaleb was. Luckily the Watchers had disappeared by the time I had arrived, because if they weren’t, I would’ve been dead for sure.  
  
Just like Kaleb.  
  
One look was all it took to realize what happened. A giant spike had pushed a hole through Kaleb’s eye. Apart from the giant hole in Kaleb’s head, some brain matter was clearly visible from outside of his body.  
  
It was the most sickening thing I’d ever seen. I’m only describing it now so you know these creatures are serious business. The Watchers did this.  
  
“Who are you?”  
  
I whirled around to see another person, a woman this time.  
  
A woman with only one eye.  
  
I realized at once that I had come face-to-face with one-eyed-Nancy.
