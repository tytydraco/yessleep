Have you heard about the country of Gurdugalandia?

It drags you in by its delicious cuisine and colorful nature... but once you go in you'll realize just how nightmarish that place is.

It is was 2004, I waw only 12 years old when I went to visit Gurdugalandia with my parents and 2 siblings, Ethan and Claire

It was supposed to be a fun family vacation, we landed in JUNGA BUNGA International Airport, we were welcomed by a group of Ugubuguus which took us to our hotel...

That is where everything turned south.

I was alone at my room with my siblings as my parents were exploring the country to find places for us to visit tomorrow morning, we were playing tic tac toe when all of a sudden

KNOCK

KNOCK

KNOCK

Me and my siblings, being the stupid kids we are thought that our parents lost their keys and that was them, my little brother came up with the idea to prank our parents and tell them about how we went to play in the pool but I got lost, so I hid in the closet as my brother and sister answered the door......

I still can't forget their screams when they opened that door

Ethan: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
Claire: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!! NOOOOO!!!!!!

They found 3 JURDUGURDUBURDUGAS staring at them before tearing them limb by limb before they finally slashed their head, I almost started crying as I heard the group of JURDUGURDUBURDUGAS slowly walk into the room, I do not know how, but the closet hid me well from their sight, I waited for what seemed like an eternity before I heard the JURDUGURDUBURDUGAS finally leave

I stepped out of the closet into a river of blood nothing remained of my siblings except their decapitated heads, stomach and terrifying amounts of blood, I tried dialing my parents on my flip phone with tears in my eyes but there was no signal, I burst out crying I feared only the worst could've happened to them in this country. I tried calling the receptionist on the hotel telephone but I was answered by horrific screams, I almost screamed as I threw the phone away, and then... all of a sudden

BANG!!!!

The door collapsed as one of the JURDUGURDUBURDUGAS kicked it with full force, my heart pounded as I jumped out of the window, I luckily landed on a haystack, I looked around me and I saw no hotel, what I saw was horrifying I saw behind me a massive restaurant called GFC (Gurdugalandian fried children) I saw JURDUGURDUBURDUGAS walking into the restaurant with a cart full of human limbs, mostly legs.

Here I was shivering of fear in that stack of hay when I saw a shadowy figure approaching, I later found out that it was Mr GURDUGA, he saw me hiding in the hay 


Mr GURDUGA: Hello, I know you are a human, do not worry I am not like the JURDUGURDUBURDUGAS, you see that hotel you were in was a GFC factory, GFC is national dish of Gurdugalandia its fried human children, I'm sorry about your brother and sister, parents too... I belive they were turned into Gurdugalandian gorilla burgers, now co-


Me: WHAT?! NO NO NO NO NO NO!!! MY PARENTS HAVE TO BE ALIVE THIS IS ALL A PRANK SHOW NO NO NO NO IM DREAMING THIS IS ALL A NIGHTMARE NO NO MOM DAD NO NOO

I was in disbelief I was angry and sad, when all of a sudden

I saw an army of JURDUGURDUBURDUGAS sprinting towards me


Mr GURDUGA: CMON MOVE

And like that I ran faster than I ever thought I could, I ran for what seemed like hours until Mr GURDUGA finally stopped me


Mr GURDUGA: Alright kid, you see that boat over there? Take it and go North east of here until you reach what I believe is called "The United States of America", that should be far away from this insane Island 


Me: Thank you, I- I- I still can't belive what happened to my siblings and parents I don't know how I'm gonna live witho-



JUNGA BUNGA KILO KAJUMBA AMUNGA ZA HUNGA GURDUBURDU JINGI JONGI GUR GUR BURDUGA ZA GURDUGA


Mr GURDUGA: GO KID GO!!! RUN TO THAT BOAT AND NEVER LOOK BACK!! GOOOOO!


I sprinted to the boat, started it and started heading for the US as I heard Mr GURDUGA being brutally murdered by the JURDUGURDUBURDUGAS



AAAAAAAAAAASTOPPPPSTOOPP IM NO HUMAN IM NO HUMA- AAAAAAAAAAAAA *SLASH* *SLASH* *SLASH*
