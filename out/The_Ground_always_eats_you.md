My grandma was a witch doctor. She used to say the ground always eats you in the end. I was young and naive and didn't believe her...until I died too. 

It was a warm day they were having a sale on materials in my small town in Mexico. We bordered on a town with a rival gang and the sale would be crossing the town borders so I would be too. They loaded up broken fences and broken pieces of wooden furniture. It was a sale as long as you could get the material out from the back whhile the cara were stopped, or so I was told. I had plans to build a little makeshift shed on our secluded land with whatever I could find. 

I remember it so clearly. All the cars passing down around the slight bend on the road, approaching the stop at the intersection. Me and my cousin got out. When we approached the first car, that's when it hit me. I was knocked into a dream world. It was like one second I was there and the next I lost my footing. I saw my grandm next to me as I fell to the ground. He old grey hair was twisted up into a bun on her head. She skinned was that sunkissed Mexican tan. She wore her usual dudty purplr moo moo dress that she was always walking around in with the kitchen windows open in the house. She looked down at me as I fell. I noticed there were others to my right. There was a whole line of people, covered in shrouds. My grandmother looks down as she warned me, "I forgot to tell you, don't touch the ground." But it was already a little late for that as I laid on my back, I felt myself stuck. It was like I was a magnet and the earth was attracting me. "The ground always eats you in the end." she spoke to me again. for some reason she didn't help me, I panicked as the earth bagan to consume me. I was sinking. I was dying, about to become the next shroud. I don't remember if I could asked her but somehow she sensed it and confirmed that I was dying. If I had known that I wouldn't have even fallen to the ground. Maybe I'd have fallen into the side of the car or into my cousin. Anywhere but mindlessly to the earth. 

It pulled and it held me, tightly. So tightly that I had to think hard to remember what it was like to feel pain. I remembered what I had been dping earlier that day. Was this about all the tall men I had been meeting? It wasn't like I was after them, the computer had just matched our similar interests. I remembered being at the restaurant when it rained. I remember enjoying sitting in the rain and how it uplifted me. Soon, I found myself able to move. First, I dragged my fist to my face and started pressing on my cheek. WAKE UP WAKE UP . I had to get out of here. I pulled and pulled and pulled myself. "I can't die here" I thought. And finally, the anger. The anger of at that thoight made me shoot straight up. My torso shot straight off the ground. Still, I couldn't see my cousin. I started punching. 

Death wasn't a enemy outside of myself to be fought but a test of inner strength to be won. I was punching the air in my anger. 

And that's when I woke up. My eyes were the last which were lifted just like they were the last to fall. My eyes opened. I woke up
