Our previous house is haunted. It wasn't exactly something scary, nor too big of a deal. But the story behind it is terrifying. The house was built ages ago. By ages, we mean 1950s. It's the third house built in that suburbs. That's why our address is Lot 3. There's a historical record of the people who live in each house ever since. And I was able to trace back up to 1965. The documents that date back to 1940s and further in the library are too blurry to see but makeable. We just really want to clean the place up, since it's being rented. But, I dont want to visit that place ever again anymore.

The records show of a woman who had a daughter and a husband. She was a seamstress and the husband was an industrial worker. She was 27 years old the last time I saw, and her daughter is 4 years old. No pictures were there, just records to see.

The house is elevated, and it has a small flower bed below the house, with spiky metal fences. The house was made out of a very strong wood, and so it was good to begin with. If we ever get the feeling that someone's in the house, then it's probably a ghost. Because it wasn't exactly harmful or anything. It was just creepy to be honest.

But that's just the surface. Checking on the records, one of the families still alive during that time was someone I knew. An old man, living in front from us. I wanted to know the story of the woman who lived before us. At first he was actually hesitated to tell me, and I should've listened, because what I heard after was shocking.

The woman was knitting through garments. His husband was at the roof trying to fix something. Her daughter is with her. Her husband asked for something needed at the rooftop. So she kept the door open. The tool was in the back of the kitchen. His husband was just busy checking the roof. And then they heard someone scream. The mother quickly rushed to see what was going on, and she saw her child's head impaled on the metal fence below. 2 days later, devastated by the fact that her child is gone, she hanged herself, while the husband shot himself a few days later after that.

I should tell you. This is still not the terrifying bit. If you want to stop here, you should, because this is just something only I was able to see.

After I heard the story, I checked the house, and just tried to stay there. It was just me and my dad though. We just finished cleaning the entire house, so we figured we take some rest. My father went to his friend, and I was just standing in the house. I can't go too far, because the house would be left open. 

A few moments later, I walked into the former bedroom and suddenly my vision got dark. My head was scratching itself onto something, and I felt a hard hard knock on a part of my skull, as well as something that's choking me, and a sharp dull pain at the back of my throat. It was the most excruciating pain I have ever felt for like 5 seconds. After that I felt weak and fell to the ground, scared to go inside the bedroom further. As soon as I got out of the bedroom, the main door closed in on itself. 

And then I felt it again. A hard knock on the skull, something that chokes me, and a sharp pain in the back of my throat. I tried to stay calm, but the pain was longer than it should. I can't see much. I can't move. I can't speak. Then suddenly, the pain gradually moved out and I collapsed. And that's not all. This is the scariest thing that's ever happened to me:

I relived their memory. The exact tragedy was burned into my head like I was in there, in that moment. The moment I got impaled, hanged, and shot. It was the most frightening thing of my life. Being in their perspective, dying three times, and reliving the exact moment of their lives. 

When I woke up, I dont feel anything. My father told me I was asleep, and that he just arrived. Out of fright I cried that day. My dad said I was probably just daydreaming, but comforted me, nonetheless. Still, it was something I can never tell to anyone, because no one would believe me.

The next day, the old man that I questioned for answers with died of a stroke. I never knew why, but the coincidence is too much to leave as his fate, but I digress. It was something I don't want to experience again. So I'm leaving it at that...
