It was Summer break. Our parents were gone on vacation for the next few weeks so we had the house all to ourselves. Naturally, that meant we would be well-behaved and not get into…And I'm just fucking around. Troy called to set up a party immediately after our parents left.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He along with me and Kenny had roles to make sure everything would go off without a hitch. It was Saturday and the partygoers would be arriving in just a couple hours. We were in the living room with Troy telling us what to do.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Dwayne, you look older so it should be easier for you to get away with this."

"With what?"

"I know a guy who sells outside the Quik Trip around eight."

"So you want me to buy from him? What if a cop sees me?"

"Man, don't be a pussy. Just act natural and they won't bother you."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I didn't want to, but I also didn't want to disappoint Troy. Besides, I wasn't planning on drinking which I used as a justification.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Alright, fine, but if something happens you better bail me out."

"What am I supposed to be doing?" Kenny interjected.

'I'm glad you asked," Troy replied. "You are going to help me set shit up."

"Like hell, why do I have to?"

"Dwayne's already getting the booze."

"Let me do it then. We all know he can't lie to save his life."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I couldn’t dispute that statement. Ever since we were little, our parents would use me to gauge whether or not my brothers were being truthful. Kenny and Troy argued for a minute until the former relented.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Besides, chances are none will bother you,” Troy told me and handed me four one-hundred-dollar bills along with a shopping list. “Just hurry back.”

“Where did you get this?”

“Savings.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I left almost immediately, heading to the Walmart up the street. There, I got a bunch of snacks including chips, several kinds of dip, soda, candy bars, and some doughnuts. The last thing left was the booze. Quiktrip was on the way back home. I checked the time on my phone and saw that it was nearly six on the dot. I scanned the parking lot for the guy Troy mentioned.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

One man, college-age,  was hanging out around the side of the building. He had a small black plastic bag in one hand and in his mouth was a cigarette. I approached him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Excuse me,” I said nervously.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Up close I could now see he was wearing a pair of earbuds and rocking his head to some music that was loud enough for me to hear it. Noticing me out of his peripheral, he paused his music, then turned to look at me, pulling out his earbuds.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You need something or are you just keep staring at me?”

“Huh? Oh,  you…Sell, right?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He took a drag of his cigarette and then blew a puff of smoke out of the side of his mouth

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Depends, how much you got?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I pulled out the remaining money Troy gave me. The man’s eyes lit up and he opened his bag, revealing several alcoholic beverages. It wasn’t specified to me what to get exactly so I decided to buy a bit of everything.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hey, you smoke?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The man opened his hoodie, showing some ziplock bags of weed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“How much is that middle one?”

“Forty.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I took the man up on his offer, figuring if I passed it up Troy would be upset with me.

“Pleasure doing business with y-”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hold it,” we heard someone yell.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We turned and a cop was glaring at us.  We were caught red-handed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Oh, we were just talking,” the man ensured.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The cop didn’t buy it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“That right? Mind seeing what you got in that bag there then?” he asked, pointing to it in my hand.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I didn’t know how to respond. I was like a deer in headlights. When I didn’t move the cop approached me. As he was reaching for the bag, the man made a break for it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hey,” the cop yelled at him.

“Wait here,” he told me before dashing after the man.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I began heading home. Since the cop was chasing the man the same way leading there, I had to take a different route. Woods surrounded our town and I figured it’d be easiest to cut through them. It was rapidly getting darker so I picked up the pace. However, returning home I stumbled across something unexpected.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I came to a clearing where there was a group of people wearing dark green hooded cloaks. They were surrounding something that I couldn’t see to them obscuring it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Everyone’s here and the preparations are complete,” one man said, ‘and soon the hour will be upon us.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I didn’t have a clue what he was talking about. I was debating whether or not to turn and go a different way or wait for these people to finish whatever it was they were doing. The man did say it would be soon. I chose the latter option. Admittedly, I was a bit curious as to what this was all about.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Soon, night came fully. The moon and stars were the only things producing visibility until the cloaked people lit some candles. One placed a green Tupperware bowl on what I could now see to be a tree stump. Then they stepped back and the same man from before who I now presumed was the leader spoke.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We are here to call upon the great one,” he declared. “Let us create his offering so that he shall rise this hour.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That’s when I realized this was some kind of cult. The leader continued.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“First, the base shall be the most sacred of fruits, so smooth like butter and yet healthy in fat.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He knelt and picked something up and held it up to the moon. Its light glistened on the object. It was a large avocado, much bigger than any I’d seen before. It was about the size of a cantaloupe.  Needless to say, I was confused.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hail the avocado,” the leader said and the other cultists repeated it in unison.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The fruit was then placed in the bowl and one of the members began mashing it with a wooden spoon.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“One letter of the dark one’s name has been added,” the leader declared.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Other ingredients were thrown in as the members shouted their names. These included Tumeric, Amchoor, and Nigella seeds. I wondered what in the world I was watching.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“At last, the final key can be added,”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A cultist stepped forward.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Cilantro,” he yelled.

“Wait,” the leader ordered.

“What?”

“That’s what you brought?”

“Well, yeah, why?”

“Cilantro starts with C.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The cultists started chastising the man.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“But it makes the s sound,” the cultist whined.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The leader sighed in frustration.

“Just toss it in, I guess. We’ve already gotten to this point.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The member did so and then the leader pulled out a scroll as everything was mixed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Now, the offering must be purged in flame.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A bottle of rum was produced and poured on the guacamole. Someone struck a match and then took it to the dip, causing a large fire to erupt in it. The leader then read from the scroll. I didn’t know what he was saying. All noises in the woods ceased other than the man chanting.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The wind picked up and despite the summer night, a sharp chill ran through me and I got the feeling something was wrong.

“The moment is here at last,” the leader told everyone. “Now we must consume the offering. Hand me the chips.”

“We don’t have any.” someone replied.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The wind stopped and the noises of the woods resumed. The chill was gone too and the leader was beyond furious.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We’ve been planning this for months and none of you thought to bring some?”

“We thought you did.”

The man threw the scroll on the ground, then managed to collect himself.

“Okay, we still have plenty of time left until midnight. I say one of us goes to the store.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The members then said that they had plans and asked if it could wait until tomorrow. In response, the leader banged his head repeatedly on the nearest tree and they took this as a yes. I crouched down to hide as they went by. The leader left shortly after, also going past me. As he did, another gust of wind rustled my grocery bags.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He stopped and for a moment I thought he was going to turn around until his cell phone rang. He answered it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Do you have to call me right now?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I could only make out muffled speaking from the person on the other end.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What did you say?” the leader asked, now filled with fear.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The conversation went on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I don’t care if she’s your mother. She is a goddamn nightmare. You can’t just spring her on me last minute.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I figured he must be talking with his wife. They argued briefly until he relented. When the call ended he grumbled to himself, putting his phone away.  He continued on his way and when he was gone I resumed my walk back home. They had left the bowl on the tree stump.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I stopped and set down the groceries. Curious, I took the lid off the bowl. It did smell good so I decided to bring it with me. If I had left it, maybe all the terrible things that happened could have been prevented. Too late for that, though.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

By the time I got back home,  Troy was waiting for me on the porch.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"The fuck took you so long? They'll be here any minute."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I explained to him what happened.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Fucking ballbusters, I swear. Anyway, bring the stuff inside. Kenny's almost done. We ordered pizza. It should be here soon."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Inside,  chairs, cups, plates, and our video games were set up. Kenny and Troy inspected the goods I acquired. Troy pulled out the bag of weed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Good going, Dwayne,” he said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The first handful of partygoers arrived shortly later. More came and soon the house was filled with them with music blaring. We were expecting a party. We didn’t expect a rager. In hindsight, bringing a bunch of teenagers together to drink copious amounts of alcohol probably wasn’t the smartest idea.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Not surprisingly, things got out of hand. As I said, I refrained from drinking as well as doing any drugs. It wasn’t that I was a straight edge. It’s just that those things didn’t appeal to me at the time. We were six matches into Mario Kart Wii and the last lap saw me in second place.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hey, we’re out of chips,” Kenny said. “Dwayne, can you grab us some?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He along with Troy and others were already about four beers in each. They’d also rolled a joint and were passing it back and forth. I went to the kitchen, saw a couple making out, and slid by them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Dude, this shit rocks,” someone drunkenly told me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In one of his hands was the bowl of guacamole and in the other was a handful of tortilla chips.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Oh, thanks,” I replied, “but that’s supposed to be for everyone, so could I have it back?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He rocked back and forth.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You’re right. My bad.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He was about to hand it to me when he got an idea.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Wait, I know what would make this perfect.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He stumbled to our spice cabinet and grabbed some saffron from it. Before I could protest, he sprinkled some in. When he did, I thought for a moment I noticed an electric spark go through the bowl, but thought it was merely my eyes fooling me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Let me try it first,” he said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He dipped a chip in and was about to eat it. That’s when the alcohol in his system caught up to him and he fainted. I did wonder how it tasted and was about to try it when Troy called me from the living room.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hey, man, hurry the fuck up. We’re about to play some Guitar Hero.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I grabbed some bags of chips and dip, then returned to the others. Time flew by as we played song after song. My personal favorite of the game was Helicopter by Bloc Party. Some guy decided to try the guacamole. They took one bite.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Holy shit, this guac is incredible," he told me. "You totally nailed it."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Thanks," I replied.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He froze, his face taking on a wide-eyed stare.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Hello?" I said, waving my hand in front of his face.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Kenny and Troy were playing at this point with the others watching,

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hey, are you alright?” I asked, my voice growing along with my panic.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He began to tremble.

“Guys,” I yelled, getting some attention.

“What’s wrong with him?” a girl asked. “Is he having a seizure?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

None of us knew what to do, and those who did were too drunk or high to help. This is when all hell quite literally broke loose. Suddenly, the guy screamed, Before anyone could register what was happening, he rose out of his chair, his feet levitating above the floor.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What in the fuck?” I hoarsely cried.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Still, under the influence, everyone who was watching thought this was some kind of party trick. They cheered and said it was fucking sick. I was the only one who thought something bad was about to happen. Unfortunately, I turned out to be right. The guy let out a demonic roar and grabbed the girl along with another guy, lifting them with ease.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They had no time to react moments prior to him breaking their necks, then he opened his mouth wide enough to reach his feet and swallowed them whole. You’d think that would prompt everyone to run far away. However, thanks to the music many people were still oblivious to the danger of the situation. Fortunately that my brothers and I were not among them. We booked it, hearing the others realize what was going only to fall victim.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We attempted to go to the nearest exit and found it blocked off by our mom’s bookshelf.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Did you really think I would allow you to escape so easily?” someone asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The warped voice gave me goosebumps. It was as if the t-rex from Jurrasic Park could somehow speak.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Upstairs,” I urged.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chancing a glance back, I thought we would be chased, but the entity remained where it was. It knew we were its playthings and it could have us whenever it pleased. The only place where we might be safe was Troy’s room.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Jesus H Christ,” Kenny said, “What in the fuck is going on?”

“How do you expect me to know?” Troy replied, running his fingers through his hair.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Screams came from downstairs. My heart dropped. This was all my fault and I needed to come clean.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I think I know why this is happening,” I confessed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They looked at me in confusion.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What do you mean, Dwayne?” Troy asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I relayed to them what I saw on the return walk back.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“So you’re telling us all this is because of some goddamned guacamole?” Kenny said.

“Yeah, that’s pretty much the sum of it. Those people said they were trying to summon a demon I think.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I wondered then why the guy who ate it in the kitchen didn’t get possessed. Then I realized the answer and scolded myself for not figuring it out sooner. The first letter of all the ingredients added, with the exception of the Cilantro, spelled out a certain title when rearranged.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Why the fuck did you take it?" Troy snapped at me.

"I don't know. I forgot to get some at the store and it was right there,” I replied defensively.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

More screams came from downstairs, making us wince.

“Well, thanks to that we’re sitting ducks,” Kenny said.

“What if we tried the window?” I suggested.

“On the second floor?”

“You’re right, shit. Can we make a rope from anything?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, there wasn’t enough material to fasten one that was long enough.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I mean, it’s a demon,” I said. “Don’t Mom and Dad keep a cross in their room?”

“You really want us to fight this thing?” Troy asked,

“I don’t think we have much of a choice. It’s only a matter of time before it runs out of people to eat. I say we try to get the jump on it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Was this idea stupid? Absolutely. Did we do it anyway? Yes. We eased our way into the hall.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Cost is clear,” Troy informed us in a whisper.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Someone downstairs was shrieking for help. We also heard people yell to try the windows. Sadly, they weren’t fast enough to escape and were silenced. A few managed to make it to the stairs and noticed us at the top. I mentally cursed because these morons were about to call out for us, giving away our position.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This was until they were dragged back. This was followed by a sickening crunch and then demonic laughter. I broke out in a sweat.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“At last, we can play…”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Satan appeared, levitating at the bottom of the stairs.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Into the room, now,”  Troy screamed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I risked one look to see him in the body he was possessing, backwards spider crawling up the stairs with his head spinning. We worked fast, going into our parents' room and then pushing their wardrobe in front of the door. Then we grabbed all the religious items we could find.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I hope this works,” I said, clutching the  Bible tightly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Kenny and Troy were holding crosses. The first bang at the door made the wood crack. We backed up. The second resulted in it exploding, sending splinters everywhere. Satan grinned at us. Trembling, we held out our things.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“The power of Christ compels you,” we shouted in unison.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He came closer, unfazed. We repeated the words more loudly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Dwayne, it’s not working,” Kenny said.

“I can see that,” I replied, panic heavy in my voice.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Satan pointed at us and then with a flick of his fingers, the Bible and crosses were torn from our hands.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Guys, I think I’m gonna shit myself,” I told them.

“We’re not far off,” Troy responded.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Our backs were against the wall.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Your weapons mean nothing if they can’t touch me,” Satan smirked. “Now, before I consume you and send your souls to the worst parts of Hell for all eternity, does anyone have a light?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In his hand was the joint from earlier. With his Hellish powers, he breathed fire on the tip, lighting it back up. I glanced at my brothers and noticed an odd glint of confidence in Troy’s eyes. I focused back on Satan as he took a drag of the joint. His eyes filled with shock and he dropped it, clutching his neck and coughing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What did you do?” he wheezed between hacking fits.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Troy smirked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“That wasn’t just any rolling paper, Satan,” he said.”It was Bible paper!”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Satan’s mouth fell open.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“No…Noooooo!”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The body he inhabited exploded into flames and we raised our arms to block them. Fortunately, none of them touched us. When we lowered our hands, the room was a complete disaster. We looked at each other, passing an unspoken message. It was “We’re in deep shit when Mom and Dad get home”.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The Bible was resting open against the wall. I picked it up, flipping through it and sure enough there was a page torn out of it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Any ideas of how we can fix all this?” I asked Troy.

“Nope.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Things only got worse when a knock came from the front door. At the very least, we could clean the place up, and clean we did, gathering the trash. Even though my brothers were drinking earlier, what happened sobered them up something fierce. When we finished, there was a knock at the door. It was the cops. They told us they were called on a noise complaint.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Answer it,” Troy told me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I did and was greeted by two cops.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Oh shit,” I murmured.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

One of them was the officer from earlier that caught me buying booze. His eyes narrowed upon recognizing me. Shortly after, we were hauled off and spent the next two nights in the slammer. Our parents were informed and showed up to post bail for us. When were picked up, our dad’s face turned a shade we didn’t think possible.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Go to the car now, “ he ordered with an expression that conveyed he wanted to strangle us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He was normally a calm man and we couldn’t fault him for his reaction. He nearly broke the window when he closed the driver's door. He hollered at us the entire ride home and said we were grounded until labor day. He also told us we would be taking part-time jobs to make up for the damages as well as the money that Troy apparently took from their savings jar. Our mom’s reaction was somehow worse.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She didn’t yell or anything only gave us a cold stare. Things could’ve been worse. Considering the horrors we witnessed, we got off easy. Plus, it was a valuable lesson in responsibility and I like to think the end result made us more mature. The missing people were reported but never found for obvious reasons.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Nobody tied it back to us which I count as another stroke of good luck. Funerals were held and we agreed never to speak a word of it to anyone else. As an aside, I did try to make the guacamole again without the ritual and it’s actually pretty solid. In fact, I recommend giving it a try. It’s been years since this all happened and the reason I felt the need to share the experience was due to something I found in my mailbox the other night. It was a large avocado seed with blood-red lettering on it.

&#x200B;

“We know.”
