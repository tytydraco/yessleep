This happened to me something like 15 years ago or even more probably.
It's the only thing that I ever experienced to have been clearly paranormal and nothing that has ever happened to me since then has ever got nearly close.
Many scary things, such as being chased by dogs at 2 in the morning on a hill in a pitch black winter night or seeing with my own eyes dead people laying few inches away from me has never come even close.
Things like those are sad, worrying, but not "scary".
What I' m about to reminish is something more uncanny than horror, nontheless frightening for the kid I was back when it happened.
So it's not that scary, it may not be the plot for a movie or anything but please believe me this is 100% true and I just want to know if this has ever happened to someone else.
Ok.
I was playing in the living room I had back at my former house, probably football or just running around with my HotWheels set.
The fact that I remember this as it happened two seconds ago scares me even now that I'm writing it.
So I was running around with the lights on, in a safe place, my parents in the kitchen washing dishes and watching tv.
Nothing's wrong.
My mother loves puzzles, she always did.
When she was a kid she used to compose them and frame them to the wall.
One of these in particular always scared me deeply.
There's something eerie about it even if it's of course just a puzzle about a concert hall with lots of different musicians waiting, along with the crowd, for the keymaster to fix the piano.
Every character has its own traits and you could watch it every day for 26 years and still not have seen each and every particular.
One of them has always scared me for some reason when I was a kid.
She has white eyes.

Anyway.
I was playing and running around in my living room and what happened is that I stopped, for some reason, and what I did was looking in the direction of the painting (hanging at the very beginning of a tight corridor that led to our bedrooms) and what I saw was my reflection stopping in the glass of the framed puzzles two seconds later than me.
I stopped running, I looked at the painting/puzzle and for one second my reflection still wasn't there.
Two seconds later, there it was, staring back.
I grew up, moved to another house, graduated and got a degree, but I still can't explain what happened to me that night.
The puzzle is "Loup Orchestra 2000 pieces".
You can notice in the bottom right corner a figure with red hair and white eyes, mad for some reason at someone in the crowd.
I had nightmares about that episode for some days after it happened and I still thino about when I walk past that puzzle now (we still have it) .
Sorry, but I just had to share it with someone.
Good night everyone, sorry but I'm new to Reddit and I probably wrote too much.
Peace.
