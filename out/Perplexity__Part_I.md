       —————11:00PM——————

The alarm screams into the darkness. I don't so much silence it as strangle it. Morning creeps in like a disease, and with it comes that familiar void in my gut, a black hole that's made itself at home there. My skull throbs as I come to the familiar recognization, I'm awake, but not really. Never really.

Through the smudged glass of my bedroom window, I watch an impossible snow cascade from a spring sky. Each flake drifts down like ash from a burning world, coating the ground in a shroud of pristine white. Too white. Unnaturally white. My heart stutters in my chest because I know, I know with a confident certainty that this isn't real. It can't be real. But there it is, falling as I watch in awe

And then I see her. Half-hidden behind the skeletal arms of an ancient, birch tree. A woman's figure lurks at the edge of my vision. She thinks she's clever, playing this game of hide and seek, but I can feel her eyes boring into me like hungry insects. I know who she is. God help me, I know.

My name is Mark Henderson, I’m 26, and I live in Washington State. These are the first words in what my therapist calls "therapeutic journaling." What a joke. Last night's dream was just another horror show in an endless series, but that's life when your brain is a broken mirror. Bipolar disorder. Sleep paralysis. Anxiety. They rattle around in my head like loose teeth. The antipsychotics turn the world into a landscape of grey, and the sleep paralysis meds? Let's just say mixing those two was like inviting demons to a tea party in my cerebral cortex. They didn’t last long, so it’s just the antipsychotics.

Doc thinks writing will help me "find joy in the small things." As if joy could exist in this fog where I drift, half-here, half-somewhere worse. By now I’ve kind of given up on being happy, on the meds everything feels distant, off the meds I’m even crazier than I probably sound right now. I should explain more, shouldn't I? But there's always later. Always tomorrow. 

    ——————11:30PM——————

The lights in my apartment flicker as I rush to get ready for another mind-numbing night shift at Martinez Auto Sales, god damn it I need to change those bulbs. The clock's ticking, and I know Jahseh's probably already there, silently judging me for running late again. That's the thing about working security at a car dealership, the cars might not care if you're a few minutes behind, but your partner never lets you forget it.

Jah and I, we go way back, all the way to our freshman year of high school when we were just two skinny kids trying not to drown in the concrete hellhole of Compton. Sometimes I still chuckle a little bit when I think about how we met. Picture this, me, a scrawny fourteen-year-old white boy with more attitude than muscle, cornered by three guys who looked like they bench-pressed Volkswagens for fun. There I was, throwing punches that probably felt like butterfly kisses, when this wild-eyed kid came flying out of nowhere like some kind of desperate idiot.

That kid was Jah. Together we got our asses handed to us, and we went down hard. But we kept getting back up, spitting blood and wobbling on our feet like a couple of punch-drunk boxers with death wishes. I think those guys finally left because they thought we were certifiable. Maybe we were. But that's the day I learned sometimes winning isn't about being the strongest; it's about being too stubborn to know when to quit. I guess that's why I'm following through on this journal, even if it feels pointless. Maybe I've given up on being happy but perhaps I can find some sort of closure. I don't know, something.

Jah was just another homeless kid back then, living on the streets after getting emancipated from a situation he still doesn't talk about. But fate or luck or whatever you want to call it led him to me, and then to the Hendersons, my foster parents, probably the only decent people I've ever met in the system. When they heard about Jah's situation, they offered him a roof. "Pay your rent, follow the rules, and you've got a home," they said. Simple as that. Those old sweethearts saw past the rough edges we both had, past my mental troubles and past Jah's trust issues, right to the damaged kids trying to claw their way out of bad circumstances.

We lived under their roof until we were nineteen, learning what family could actually mean. Then real life slapped us in the face, and we got our own places. Started drifting apart like people do, buried under our own problems I guess. But about a year ago, Jah reached out, needed help finding work. I'd been doing the security gig at Martinez for a year by then, and it brought me some sort of faint hope when I brought him on board. Like completing a circle that started with that stupid fight all those years ago.

Speaking of which, shit. Always late. Better grab my gear and run. Jah's going to tear me a new one tonight. I'll probably update during or after work, if I can find the energy.

   ——————12:40AM——————

I arrived a little later than I intended, but I knew that, and of course, Jah was quick to call me out on it, just as I expected. As I stepped through the back door into the security room, his first words hit me, “C’mon Mark, I know you struggle with sleep sometimes, but you’re always late, man.” His voice had that familiar deep resonance. I replied, “It wasn’t that. I was busy writing in this ridiculous journal my therapist wants me to start.” I’m not too worried about being honest with him—well, mostly—but he’s one of the few who has seen me at my lowest. “I don’t think that’s ridiculous. It’ll prolly be something that’ll help you out.” For some reason, his words lifted my spirits a bit, at least about the journal. “Yeah, maybe.”

We settled into our usual routine, monitoring the security cameras and making our rounds around the lot from time to time. Sometimes, I can’t shake the feeling that everything we do as a society is pointless, that we tirelessly strive to move forward, yet we seem stuck in the same spot, or worse, even regressing. My therapist would probably frown upon this mindset. I should focus on the positives. But whatever.

   ——————2:45AM——————

I hadn’t planned on documenting this, but Jah insisted it rattled me, so here we are. Typically, our nights are pretty uneventful, just a routine of monitoring the cameras, making our rounds, and heading home. But tonight felt different, like that eerie calm before the storm, though I chalked it up to my overactive imagination. 

My thoughts are a tangled mess, let’s get back to the story. We were glued to the security feeds when a van rolled into the strip mall adjacent to the car dealership. Normally, we wouldn’t bat an eye, our job is to protect the dealership, not the strip mall, a debate that’s already played out. But when the music erupted from the van, thumping so loudly that we could feel it in our bones, we felt we had to investigate. 

Jah turned to me, his finger pointing at camera 8. “Hey, that van’s been parked there for a while. Should we check it out?” He exuded a kind of bravado that I lacked, his imposing frame and that signature smirk make him seem invincible. His dreads cascaded down his back, a testament to his defiance against anyone who might dare to pull them, and trust me the one time they did, Jah ended up walking away with the other guy on the floor. “You know how I feel about confrontation,” I muttered, but he just shot me that infuriating grin. “Come on, you didn’t sign up to be a security guard just to sit around.” I shot back, “Actually, that’s exactly what I did.”

We stepped into the lot, approaching the van with a sense of caution. It was a clunky old beast, rattling and groaning as the bass reverberated through its frame. The windows were so heavily tinted that they might as well have been blacked out. Jah took the lead, knocking on the window, we held our breath as we waited. After a moment, the window cracked open just a sliver, and we were immediately assaulted by a noxious cloud of burnt chemicals, a foul stench that poured out like a toxic fog.

The acrid odor of the toxins assaulted my senses, igniting a fiery sting in my nostrils, yet Jah remained unfazed. Sometimes, I envied his calm demeanor. “Hey! Turn that down—” Jah’s deep voice was abruptly cut off, a rare occurrence that caught my attention. “WHAT?!” His expression morphed into one of intense frustration, eyebrows knitting together in a way that made me grateful I wasn’t on the receiving end of his ire. “I told you to turn down your music!” His voice resonated, not as loud as the man in the van, but it carried an authority that demanded attention.

The music faded to a whisper, leaving only the unsettling sight of a pair of beady eyes peering through the window crack, fixated on me. Not on Jah, not on anything else, just me, as if I were the weakest link in a predator's gaze. “Is that it, boys?” His voice was rough, creaking like the floorboards of an old house, steeped in history.

“You can’t just loiter in this parking lot. Go home.” Even with just his eyes visible, his confusion was palpable, one eyebrow arching slightly. “I, uh, didn’t realize how late it was. My apologies, boys.” I fell silent, wishing to blend into the shadows like I did in high school, but the urge to speak bubbled up. “Sir, please address us respectfully. We’re not much younger than you, and we’re certainly not boys.” The man merely chuckled, a sound that made me feel like I should surrender.

Then, a loud clatter erupted from the back of his van, a sound that shattered the tense atmosphere. In that instant, I saw the flicker of realisation in Jah’s eyes, a mix of confusion and alarm. “Open the back of your van, or I’ll call 9-1-1 right now.” Before he could process the threat, the van’s tires screeched, and it shot out of the parking lot, disappearing onto the main road in a heartbeat.

“I hope it turns out to be nothing, if we find out something did happen, I won't be able to shake it off.” When Jah expressed that, I couldn't help but admire his sentiment. If there was indeed a stranger in that car, I knew Jah felt real empathy for them. After all, that's the lesson the Hendersons instilled in us. After that, we simply returned to the office.

      ——————7:45AM——————

The clock struck seven, marking the end of our shift. We worked the graveyard hours, from midnight to seven in the morning, and soon after, someone arrived to unlock the car dealership for the day. I unzipped my blue security jacket, the fabric cool against my skin, revealing a patch stitched with my name “Mark” in elegant cursive. Yet, they didn’t capture the essence of my name. To me, Mark was just plain, unremarkable, a dull echo of my true self. I stowed my taser in the locker, then dialed the police to report the earlier incident. Their response was polite but distant, it told me what I needed to know. 

In the dimly lit parking lot behind the dealership, I stood beside Jah, who had parked his vehicle next to mine. My own car, a battered 2011 Corolla, was a testament to my financial struggles, with 120,000 miles and a history of repairs that seemed endless. In stark contrast, Jah’s 1989 Ford Ranger was a relic that somehow managed to hold itself together far better than my sedan.

As I tossed my work badge into the back seat, preparing to head home and collapse into sleep, Jah turned to me with an unexpected proposition. “Hey, you want to hit up a ‘day rave’?” His words caught me off guard, leaving me stunned for several reasons. First, I had no idea such an event existed, and second, I never pictured Jah as the rave type.

“What the hell is a day rave?” I asked, bewildered.

“It’s exactly what it sounds like. You know, some of us work the night shift. Jack invited me as a peace offering.”

“Jack? The guy whose face you rearranged at the last party?”

“We’re cool now. He was just a drunken idiot. Plus, I know you and Vanessa split a month or two ago, and I just want to see you get out there, man.” Jah’s unexpected kindness struck me. How could someone with such a tough exterior show so much compassion? I hesitated, realizing I hadn’t even begun to unpack my feelings with my therapist about the breakup. “I guess I could go, but I probably won’t last long.”

With that, we left the dealership behind, heading toward Long Beach, Washington. Our small town nestled outside the bustling cities, I guess we just preferred the quiet. But I must admit, everything that’s played out tonight feels like an omen, like I’m going to have to confront something soon, I don’t know if I’ll be able to. After the rave I’ll update the journal again, I guess I have to fully commit, at least Jah made me feel a bit better about it.
