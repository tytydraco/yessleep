It’s a crisp Thursday morning, the kind that hints at the edge of summer with just enough warmth to make you forget about the winter past. Our private investigation office, a modest second-floor space above a bustling café on Magazine Street in New Orleans, is alive with the usual morning chaos. My wife Reine and I are in the midst of showing Abbey, our new secretary, the ins and outs of our, let's call it, "unique" filing system.

Abbey, a young woman with bright blue eyes and an infectious enthusiasm for detective work, nods vigorously, taking notes on her pad.

"So, you see," I start, holding up a file, "each case has its own color code. Red for ongoing cases, blue for solved, and green for... well, let's just call it 'active investigations.'"

Abbey nods, her eyes scanning the rainbow of folders on the desk. "And the glitter stickers?" she asks, pointing to a file adorned with sparkling unicorns.

I glance at Reine, who's trying to hide her smirk behind a cup of coffee. "That's... Reine's system. You'll have to ask her about that."

Reine leans over, her voice laced with mock seriousness. "The glitter is crucial, Abbey. It represents the mystery of the case. The more glitter, the deeper the intrigue."

Abbey looks between us, a flicker of confusion passing through her eyes before she catches onto our jest. "Got it. Glitter equals mystery. I'll remember that."

"And remember," Reine says, pointing to a large, overly complex calendar on the wall, "if someone asks for an urgent meeting and the calendar looks full, just tell them we're consulting on a case in Baton Rouge. It buys us some time."

Abbey nods vigorously, taking notes on her pad. "Got it, Baton Rouge. And if they ask for details?"

I glance at Reine with a mischievous grin. "Then you say we’re undercover, and it's a matter of national security. They rarely ask after that."

Just as we're wrapping up our impromptu tutorial with Abbey, there's a sudden, sharp knock at the door, cutting through the relaxed atmosphere of the morning like a knife.

I stride over and pull it open to reveal a woman in her early forties, her poise teetering on the edge of despair. She introduces herself in a voice that carries a weight far beyond her years. "Hello, Detectives Asher and Reine Tran? I'm Astrid Everly. I believe I have an appointment for a consultation."

I nod, remembering a conversation over the phone last week, though the specifics elude me. "Of course, Mrs. Everly, please come in. Abbey, could you pull up the Everly file on the desktop, please? Should be under 'E'."

Before Abbey can even turn to the computer, Astrid interjects, "There's no need for that. I'm here because I suspect my husband, Zane, of... infidelity." Her voice falters for a moment, the facade of calmness cracking.

Reine sets her coffee down with a soft clink, her expression shifting into one of professional empathy. "We understand how difficult this must be for you, Mrs. Everly," she says gently.

I motion for Astrid to take a seat. “You've come to the right place,” I begin. “We handle matters discreetly and efficiently."

Cheating spouse investigations might not be glamorous, but they are the bread and butter of our business. And in our experience, the truth, however painful, is what our clients need most.

As I gesture towards the worn but comfortable chairs, Reine busies herself with the small coffee maker in the corner of our office. "Cream and sugar, Mrs. Everly?" Reine calls out.

Astrid nods, a grateful smile briefly crossing her face. "Just cream, thank you." Her composure, momentarily lifted by the gesture, seems to falter as the gravity of her situation resettles around her.

I sit across from Astrid, my posture open, inviting her to share her story. Abbey, sensing the shift in atmosphere, quietly retreats to her desk, giving us space.

"Mrs. Everly, can you tell us why you suspect your husband might be unfaithful?" I ask, my tone gentle yet earnest, signaling that this is a safe space for her to vent her concerns.

Astrid exhales a shaky breath, her dark brown eyes glistening with unshed tears as she starts to unravel the thread of her story. "It's the little things, really," she begins, her voice a whisper of despair. "Zane has always been a loving husband and father, but lately, he's been distant. He comes home late, if he comes home at all, and when he does, it's like his mind is elsewhere."

She pauses, collecting her thoughts before continuing. "Then there's his phone. It used to be just another gadget, but now... now it's like an extension of himself. He guards it jealously, never leaves it unattended. And if I so much as glance in its direction, he snaps at me, saying I'm invading his privacy."

Astrid's hands clench tighter, the knuckles whitening. "But what really convinced me was the perfume," she adds, a note of betrayal creeping into her voice. "I found a scarf in his car, one that definitely wasn't mine. It was drenched in a perfume I've never worn, a scent that now seems to linger on him constantly."

The room falls silent, the weight of her pain palpable in the air. Reine hands Astrid her coffee with cream, offering a small, comforting smile.

"I confronted him about it," Astrid continues, her gaze dropping to the cup in her hands. "He denied everything, of course. Said the scarf must belong to a coworker he'd given a ride to, and that the perfume was probably from a client he'd met with. He said I was being…”

Her voice breaks, a lone tear escaping down her cheek. “He said I was being a ‘paranoid bitch’!”

Reine and I are both shocked at Astrid’s raw emotion, the harshness of the words used against her clearly wounding deep. I reach for a box of tissues, sliding it across the desk towards her, while Reine’s comforting hand finds its way to Astrid’s shoulder, a silent gesture of support in this moment of vulnerability.

“There’s no excuse for anyone to speak to you like that,” I say firmly, my distaste made clear.

Astrid accepts the tissue, dabbing at her eyes, a shaky breath indicating her struggle to maintain composure. “We’ve been married for 15 years,” she whispers, her voice gaining a semblance of strength. “We have two beautiful children. I just... I can’t believe it’s come to this.”

Reine leans forward. "Mrs. Everly, you're doing the right thing by seeking the truth. No matter how painful it may be, knowing will give you the power to make informed decisions about your future."

“There’s something else...” She hesitates, as if weighing the risk of sharing more. “It might sound odd, but there have been... occurrences. Things I can’t explain. At night, I’ve felt a presence, something unsettling, watching over us.”

The mention of a presence catches both Reine and me off guard. It’s a departure from the infidelity case we thought we were dealing with, hinting at something deeper, perhaps even darker.

“You mean, like a stalker?” I asked.

Astrid nods, unable to produce the words.

"Stalking is a very serious matter," Reine says, the detective in her surfacing with a palpable intensity. "Are you sure about what you've felt? Have there been any signs, any tangible evidence of someone physically stalking you or your family?"

Astrid looks uncertain for a moment, then nods, her resolve firming. “At first, I thought it was stress, but then…”

She pauses, her hands trembling as she fishes her phone out of her purse.

"A few nights ago," she starts. “The kids were at my sister's, and Zane... Zane was out, as usual." She navigates through her phone with deliberate taps, opening an app connected to her home's security system. "I installed a Ring Cam last month, just to feel a bit safer, you know?"

With a few more swipes, she turns the phone towards us, displaying a video captured by her Ring Cam. The footage is grainy, typical of night mode recordings, but what it reveals sends a chill down my spine. It shows Astrid's front porch bathed in the eerie glow of the security light.

Then, without warning, something darts across the screen—a blur of motion too rapid to decipher. It's there and gone in the blink of an eye, leaving behind an unsettling afterimage that seems to hover in the night air. The motion is too swift, too large for any common animal, and there's an odd, almost deliberate evasion in the way it avoids the light, slipping into the shadows with an ease that suggests intelligence, or perhaps something more sinister.

"I thought it was just a stray animal at first," Astrid says.

Astrid's fingers shake slightly as she swipes to the next item on her phone. “I found this the next morning,” She said, handing the phone over for us to see.

The image that greets us is deeply unsettling: a tangled mess of what appears to be intestines and long, straight black hair, left in a sickening pile on her doorstep. I've seen enough in Iraq to recognize the unmistakable look of human intestines.

"I... I didn't know what to do," Astrid continues, her voice shaking. “Of course, Zane dismissed it. Said it was just something the cat dragged in.”

Astrid's face is pale. "I had hoped it was some sick joke, maybe kids playing a twisted prank, but..." Her voice trails off.

"My kids," she whispers, her voice fraught with fear. "What if whatever did this comes back? What if they're not safe?"

Reine and I exchange a glance, both of us understanding the gravity of the situation. This isn't just a case of potential infidelity or even stalking; we're potentially looking at something far more dangerous. This is the kind of case we live for.

"We'll take your case, Mrs. Everly," I say, my tone conveying not just our acceptance but our commitment to seeing this through.

"We'll do everything in our power to get to the bottom of this,” Reine says, echoing my resolve.

Astrid's shoulders seem to drop ever so slightly at our words. It's clear she's been carrying this weight alone for too long.

"Thank you, detectives," she murmurs, her gratitude palpable.

—

The sun is already high in the sky, when we begin preparing to set up additional security measures around Astrid Everly's house. It’s imperative that we work discreetly, ensuring that neither Zane Everly nor the stalker notice our presence. With Astrid's kids safely away at school and Zane presumably engrossed in his daily routine, we have a narrow window to operate under the radar.

Reine and I arrive in our nondescript SUV, our trunk filled with the latest in surveillance technology. We have compact cameras that can be concealed easily, motion sensors that are no bigger than a pack of gum, and a couple of high-definition night vision cameras to cover the darker corners of the property. While I focus on finding the optimal spots to place the cameras, Reine meticulously checks for any blind spots in our coverage. We communicate in low tones, a silent dance of efficiency honed by years of working together.

Once the equipment is in place, camouflaged amidst the everyday, we retreat to our makeshift command center — the back of our SUV, screens aglow with feeds from the newly installed cameras. Everything appears serene. But we know better than to trust appearances; the true nature of the threat still eludes us, hidden in the shadows of uncertainty.

Our next move is to keep a close eye on Zane. Tailing someone without drawing attention requires a blend of patience and subtlety. We follow him as he moves through the streets of New Orleans, our steps shadowing his with careful precision. He seems to be following a routine, visiting places that one would expect a man of his standing to frequent — the office, a local café, and a series of meetings that appear mundane on the surface.

Yet, our focus isn't just on Zane's whereabouts. We are equally attentive to his interactions, the pauses in his day, the way his gaze lingers a touch too long on certain individuals. It’s a delicate balance, observing without engaging, collecting pieces of a puzzle we’re still trying to understand.

As the day wears on, the mundane nature of Zane's activities begin to paint a picture of a man ensnared in the trappings of a double life. The evidence is subtle, hidden in the nuances of his behavior, yet unmistakable to the trained eye. He’s cautious, perhaps too cautious, with his movements and communications, suggesting an awareness of being watched or, at least, the possibility of it.

Zane's path leads him into a quaint flower shop nestled between a bookstore and a bakery. During a momentary lull in our surveillance, I pull out a container of Chinese takeout—cold sesame noodles and spicy orange chicken, our stakeout meal.

As we eat, Reine turned to me, a mischievous glint in her gray eyes. "Hey," she said, her tone light but carrying an undercurrent of seriousness, "you'd never cheat on me, right? I mean, with all this infidelity we see, you haven't gotten any ideas, have you?"

I can’t help but chuckle at her question, the absurdity of the thought mingling with the gravity of our current case. "Cheat on you, em?" I start, leaning closer to her, our knees touching in the cramped space, “And miss out on Friday night stakeouts and takeout with my incredibly sexy and talented partner?”

Reine giggles, the tension easing between us as she nodded in agreement. "Good answer," she said, her gaze softening.

"Your turn," I say, nudging her gently with my elbow. "You wouldn't cheat on me, would you?”

“Bon Dieu, non!” Reine utters, feigning indignance. “I would never consider such a thing!”

“Really?” I ask with a grin. “Not even if Brad Pitt decided he was in need of a private eye with your... extensive expertise?"

"Well," she drawls, the corner of her mouth ticking upward in a smirk, "if we're bringing Brad Pitt into the fantasy, I suppose I'd have to at least... consider the consultation fee."

“As long as it's just a consultation," I quip, winking at her, "I guess I can live with that. But just so we're clear, if Scarlett Johansson comes knocking, I expect the same courtesy from you."

“Do you expect us to work that case together?” she says, her voice dripping with innuendo.

“Two heads are better than one, right?” I ask with a grin. “Especially when it comes to... thorough investigations."

“Right, it's all about the team effort." Reine laughs, shaking her head.

Our lighthearted banter is cut short as the screens flicker with movement. Suddenly, the flower shop door swings open, and Zane steps out, cradling a bouquet of roses that seems almost too delicate for his broad hands. The sight snaps us back to the task at hand.

We start the car and follow him at a discreet distance. Our route takes us through the heart of the city, past the colorful facades of the French Quarter, and eventually into Marigny, a neighborhood known for its bohemian atmosphere and tightly knit streets.

Zane pulls into the parking lot of L'Etoile du Nord, a boutique hotel, a place that prides itself on discretion and privacy.

Perched in our vehicle across the street, we watch Zane through binoculars, the lens bringing him into sharp relief against the backdrop of the hotel's understated elegance. He waits by the entrance, the bouquet of roses in hand, the casual stance of a man comfortable in his surroundings.

Moments later, a woman approaches. She's strikingly beautiful with high cheekbones and a delicate, structured jawline. Her eyes, a deep brown, are alert yet hold a hint of mystery. Most distinguishing is her straight black hair that cascades down her back—hair unmistakably similar to the tangle left on Astrid's doorstep.

The air between them is charged, their reunion marked by an intimacy that leaves little doubt of their relationship. They embrace, a greeting that quickly deepens into a kiss, a confirmation of suspicions we didn't want to validate. Reine, with a camera in hand, captures this exchange, the shutter clicks a silent witness to the betrayal unfolding before us.

Zane and the woman make their way to their room on the third floor. We watch in silence through the balcony window as they undress each other, their movements fluid and intimate.

I’m left with a deep sense of discomfort, feeling the urge to look away. But as I’m about to pull away and give them their privacy, I catch a glimpse of something unsettling.

As Zane and the woman are locked in a passionate embrace, her head detaches from her body with a surreal ease that defies all logic. Her body slumps to the floor, but her head... her head remains suspended in mid-air. Internal organs dangle grotesquely from her neck, swaying slightly as if caught in a gentle breeze that does not exist.

Before Zane can even begin to process the nightmarish turn of events, the woman's floating head lunges at him, teeth bared. She's not just biting his face—it's more vicious, more savage. It's as if she's trying to consume him, her teeth tearing into his flesh with a ferocity that's both shocking and horrifying.

Reine and I exchange a glance that carries the weight of a thousand words. It’s a look that says, "Did you just see what I saw?" and "We need to move, now." Without a word, we leap into action.

I grab my Beretta from the glove compartment, checking the clip in one fluid motion, while Reine does the same. Our footsteps are a rapid, synchronized rhythm against the pavement as we sprint towards the hotel’s entrance, bypassing the startled doorman who shouts after us, questions hanging in the air, unanswered.

The lobby blurs past us, a mixture of luxury and confusion as the receptionist begins to protest, but the urgency in our strides silences any further inquiry. We take the stairs, two at a time, the sound of our boots echoing off the walls.

Reaching the designated floor, we move down the hallway, guided by the cacophony of a struggle that grows louder with each step. The numbers on the doors blur past until we find the one that matches our frantic search.

We come to a skidding halt outside the door where a cleaning lady stands, paralyzed by fear. The sounds emanating from within the room are nothing short of chilling—a cacophony of snarls and screams that seem to seep into the very marrow of your bones. Her eyes, wide with terror, dart between the door and us, as if she's caught in a nightmare she can't wake up from.

"Open the door, now!" Reine commands.

For a moment, she hesitates, her hand trembling so violently it seems she might drop the key card. I lock eyes with her, my gaze imploring her to trust us. "We're here to help. Please."

With a shaky nod, she swipes the card, the soft click of the lock disengaging sounding almost deafening in the charged silence that follows.

"Get somewhere safe and call 911. Tell them we have an... emergency," I instruct her. She nods, her face drained of color, and scurries away.

I cautiously push the door open. The scene that unfolds before us is one ripped straight from the darkest corners of the unimaginable. The headless nude body of the woman lies crumpled on the floor.

The room is drenched in the overpowering scent of an exotic perfume, the same one Astrid had described, a fragrance that now seems to cling to every surface, saturating the air with its cloying sweetness.

But it's Zane that captures our immediate attention. His back is turned to us, and from the neck down, he looks entirely normal, if one can consider any part of this situation to be so. But where his head should be, there's nothing recognizable as human. Instead, an undulating mass has taken its place, pulsing and writhing as if it's burrowing into his body, consuming him from the inside out.

Reine and I edge forward, our weapons drawn and aimed squarely at what remains of him.

"Zane Everly, turn around slowly with your hands up," I call out. The words feel surreal, as if spoken by someone else.

He responds, but not in the way we expect. The movement is unnatural, a series of jerks and spasms that suggest the thing wearing Zane like a suit is unfamiliar with the body it’s inhabiting.

The parasitic mass where his head once was pulsates with a sickening rhythm, tendrils flailing, seeking, as if searching for a new host to infect. Eyes, if they can be called that, shimmer with a malevolent intelligence.

"Jésus Christ," Reine mutters under her breath.

My stomach turns, the scene defying logic and sanity. But it’s not just the horror of Zane’s condition that heightens the tension—it’s the realization that the body of the woman, the one we had just seen, is not where it should be. The room, though chaotic, lacks her presence.

“Reine, where’s the—” My question cuts short as a cold grip tightens around my wrist.

I whirl around, my heart pounding, to face the headless, nude body of the woman. Her grip is iron-clad, her strength unnatural. In disbelief, I see the sinew and muscle of her neck twitch and pulse where her head should be.

I try to level my pistol at the headless torso, aiming to neutralize the threat. But she's too fast, too strong. With an unexpected force, she twists my wrist painfully, causing my shot to go wide. The bullet, meant to stop her, punches a hole into the plush carpeting of the hotel room.

Reine, quick as ever, tries to make a move to help me, but before she can get close, the amorphous head attached to Zane's body detaches itself and launches in her direction. It's like something out of a nightmare, a living mass with tendrils that act almost with a mind of their own. As it flies through the air, the tendrils extend, reaching for Reine.

It wraps its tendrils around her with a precision that betrays a malicious intent, disarming her in a single, fluid movement. The gun clatters to the floor, a sound harsh against the eerie silence that envelopes the room.

Reine struggles against the creature's grip, but the tendrils tighten, constricting like boa constrictors. They wind around her neck, her torso, squeezing with a strength that is both terrifying and otherworldly. Reine's face contorts with pain, her eyes meeting mine, a silent plea for help written in her gaze.

"Reine!" I shout, desperation lacing my voice. My partner, my wife, the person I've faced countless dangers with, is now inches away from death by this unimaginable foe.

I yell at the creature. "Let her go!”

For a fleeting second, the tension in the room ripples with the uncertainty of the thing's response. Then, in a voice that is eerily calm and chillingly clear despite its formless source, the creature responds. "Stay out of my way. I won’t warn you again."

Then, abruptly, the entity's grip loosens around Reine and drops her. Reine gasps for air, her face flushed from the constriction.

As the headless woman releases her vice-like grip on my forearm, I rush towards Reine as she stumbles back into my arms. I catch her, my relief palpable. We both regain our footing, keeping wary eyes on the creature.

As we watch, stunned, the head slowly drifts back towards the woman’s body, reattaching  itself to her neck. The seams where flesh meets flesh knit together in a spectacle that's both horrifying and mesmerizing. Within moments, the transformation is complete, and the woman stands before us, her appearance as flawless and composed as when Zane first greeted her outside the hotel.

In the chaos of the moment, the entity undergoes yet another grotesque transformation. A pair of dark, leathery wings unfurl from her back with a sinister grace. They're massive, spanning the width of the room, knocking over furniture as if they're mere obstacles in its path.

With a powerful flap, the woman launches herself towards the balcony, shattering the glass doors in her haste to escape. The night air rushes in, mixing with the stench of decay and the iron tang of blood, creating a maelstrom of senses that leaves us momentarily disoriented.

We rush to the balcony, just in time to see the woman disappearing into the dark sky. Her flight is erratic, a sign of its newfound form, but she quickly gains altitude and vanishes into the night, leaving behind a trail of questions and a palpable sense of dread.
