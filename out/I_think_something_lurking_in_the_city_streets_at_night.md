Every time I hear someone tell a creepy story they usually talk about forgotten places in the middle of fuck knows nowhere or quiet, small towns where the most exciting event that usually happen is when little Timmy’s first milk tooth falls off.
I live in one of the most important cities in Europe, so the idea of a Wendigo coming out of the woods to maul my flesh and bones isn’t exactly the first thing that comes to mind when it comes to the dangers of city life, I know for experience that people are much more dangerous, or so I thought.

I was returning home after a day studying at my university, I stopped at a bar to have a drink with a couple of friends, so it had gotten late, middle of the night type of late. At a decent enough hour I would have taken the bus, but when it gets dark a lot of “unpleasant individuals” tend to get onboard if you catch my drift. I live close to where I was, so I decided to walk home.

After walking for a while a heard a soft “meow”, I thought it was a small kitten who got lost, I saw a lot of lost pets poster around the city, so at the moment it seemed worth checking out.
When I turned the corner however, I froze in shock only to hide back behind the wall.
A group of kids, around 15 or 17 some were even younger, where surrounding an old man in a clearly hostile way, pushing him around mocking him.

I know this might sound selfish and it is, but I decided that the best course of action in this case was to get away as fast as possible without getting notice.
First of all there were like 8 of them, and I was on my own since I doubt the poor geezer was going to be of any help, second of all the cops in my city are practically a volunteering group, since our mayor thought that giving them too much funds would have meant: “militarize the city”, so now the few of them that actually care can’t even afford to have a tazer.
If you knew the circumstances I’m sure you would have done the same.

Suddenly that ancient fossil of a man yelled something to one of the kids in what I assumed was an old regional dialect, since a lot of old folks still refuse to speak our country’s current language. One of those little shits decked him hard in the face, I think a bone broke on impact, and it definetly wasn’t the kid’s knuckles.
I prayed they left so I could at least call him an ambulance but they weren’t satisfied.
It was like watching a pack of wolves praying on a lost lamb, and if I made a sound I probably would have been their next prey. 

As I panicked, hidden behind the street’s corner, I heard meowing again, but this time it was much lowder, loud enough to echoe through the air around me, the beating suddenly stops, the only sound I could hear was the old man’s coughing and sobbing, I peeked around the corner to see what was happening everyone stopped to look around, then in a flash, one of the kids got dragged away into the dark in a matter of seconds, I could hear the crunching of bones, the tearing of flesh and the screams of pain. Soon enough the small crowd started frantically run away in each direction. I retreated back into my hidden corner, mouth shut, ears open.
A booming roaring accompanied the sounds of the slaughter. I don’t know why but I wanted to look at that thing, that terrible beast that massacred those punks as if they were flies.
As I stared at the street expecting to see gore galore, I saw only the silhouette of the creature, swallowing the bodies whole.

It was huge, almost as big as a building, it had big curved horns and hooves but it also had a cat’s tail and ears. Through the light of a street lamp I saw part of it clearly, on its body there was shining, impeccable white fur, that sparkled in the artificial light of the city, then it looked at the sky and I saw it’s eyes, its big, glowing, yellow cat like eyes. Then as it came , it disappeared into night, and after a final meow, silence surrounded me once more.

I don’t know if my story will reach deaf ears, but I can tell you this, don’t stay out of your house late at night in a big city, because when the sun comes down, it’s not that different from that forgotten place in god’s know where
