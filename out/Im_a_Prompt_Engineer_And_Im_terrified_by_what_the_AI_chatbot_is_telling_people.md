I remember finding it funny, when my job first started getting so much attention, and so much hype, online. Hype that included headlines like "Prompt Engineers: The Profession of the Future", "Why Do Prompt Engineers Get Paid So Much Money?" and my personal favorite, "Prompt Engineering 101: The Hot New AI Career."

The truth is, I didn't even know what a Prompt Engineer was when I applied for the position. I just saw that it paid pretty well, and required little to no coding.

*Eh, fuck it why not.* I thought to myself, as I threw caution to the wind, and hit send on the application.

A few weeks, and countless rounds of interviews later, I got hired, and soon found out.

"It's not rocket science." Arnold, my co-worker, who was training me, said. "People go to the AI chatbot. They enter a prompt. And the system spits out an output. Then you gather all the output data, analyze it, and evaluate its performance, to then train the model to respond to users more effectively. Get it?"

"Totally." I replied.

I was full of shit. I had no idea what the fuck he was talking about.

But within a month or two, I got the hang of it, and within six months time, Arnold was coming to me with questions.

Looking back on that period of time, I had it good. A high-paying, glamorous, in-demand tech job, that I was actually good at. A fancy apartment. And more than enough income, to cover a much needed vacation to Hawaii.

I was on top of the world.

That is, until I saw a response, a string of words, that would change my life forever.

"The bodies are buried at..." followed by GPS coordinates.

*Seriously? What did these fuckers ask it this time?* I wondered, analyzing the data more closely. Kids were always trying to fuck with our system, to elicit the most fucked up responses from it possible, and I expected to find a leading question.

But when I looked at the corresponding prompt, all I found was the question, "What's something interesting you could tell me?"

As strange as the output was, I honestly didn't think much of it at the time. I was always stumbling onto weird one-off responses, to the point where I kept a list of the weirdest ones on my dry erase board.

And so, I did what I always did, and added this one to the list, quickly forgetting about it, just I had quickly forgotten about the others.

Until it happened again, a couple days later.

"The bodies are buried at..." followed by the same GPS coordinates.

And then again a week after that.

"The bodies are buried at..." followed by the same GPS coordinates.

*What the fuck?* I thought to myself, before bringing it to Arnold.

But he, too, laughed it off.

"Add it to the dry erase board." Arnold chuckled.

"I already did." I replied.

"Eh, it's probably just one of the developers, fucking with people. The chatbot may be AI, but humans program the AI, you know?"

It was a sound theory, that I decided to adopt with open arms.

Until I saw it once again.

"The bodies are buried at..." followed by the same GPS coordinates.

There was just something about it. Something so creepy, so matter of fact, so specific, that I just couldn't get it off my mind.

And so, I brought it back to Arnold again.

But this time, he was even less helpful.

"Well, it looks like only one of them reported it to CX. So it doesn't seem to be much of an issue." Arnold rationalized.

"Much of an issue?" I countered. "This is some creepy shit, man."

"Relax, bud. You're on vacation tomorrow. Just forget about it. It'll work itself out while you're away, and if it doesn't, you can deal with it when you're back. After a week in Hawaii, your brain will be much better suited to solve the mystery of the dead bodies."

"What the fuck, Arnold."

"What? You gotta admit it's pretty funny. Our programmers are even more childish than our users."

"I don't know. There's just something about it."

But my co-worker and former trainer was growing impatient with me.

"Well shit, you know what." He said, patting me on the back and escorting me out of his office. "If it makes you feel better, then go investigate it. Go figure out where those coordinates are, change your flight, and forgo a week in paradise, to play detective in likely, the middle of nowhere."

It was a joke, of course. Never in Arnold's wildest imagination, did he ever expect that I'd actually go through with the idea.

But....

...I was so disturbed by the cryptic response, so obsessed with it, that by the time I got home from work that night, I had made up my mind...

...I was going to follow Arnold's plan... exactly as he had outlined.

A few minutes later, I was opening an incognito browser, typing in the GPS coordinates from the mysterious output, and learning the name of the town where the bodies were supposedly buried.

Fifteen minutes later, I was on the phone with the airline company...

"Hi. Yes, I'm looking to change the destination of my flight tomorrow."

A day later, I was on a plane, headed to the west coast...

"Yes, I'll take the honey roasted peanuts please."

Another day later, I was at a hardware store on the other side of the country, talking with a salesperson.

"Yeah, what aisle are the shovels in?"

And thirty minutes after that, I was parking my car on the side of a dirt road, the closest point that I could find between civilization and the GPS coordinates.

*Who needs paradise anyway?* I thought to myself, as I trudged my way deeper and deeper into the forest that night, flashlight in one hand and shovel propped up on my opposite shoulder, the only other light emanating from the moon overhead.

But when I arrived at the location, I found that someone had already beat me to it.

There, digging away under the moonlight, were four men, each dressed in black, and also carrying flashlights and shovels, digging away in an open glen, that was surrounded by trees on all sides.

I stood there silently at the edge of the forest, watching from behind a tree, as, sure enough, they slowly began removing bodies from the ground, one by one, throwing each of them into a body bag.

*Fuck. The chatbot was right.* I thought to myself.

They must have pulled four or five corpses out, when something very, very… inconvenient... happened.

Suddenly, I lost my footing on the ground below me, my shoe sliding down a fallen branch, and breaking it in the process.

SNAP.

The sound echoed throughout the glen, loud enough for the four men to hear it.

*Fuck.*

They all stopped what they were doing, before one of them pointed in my direction and said to another. "Go check it out."

Immediately, one of the men dropped his shovel, then turned his flashlight to the forest, and began to walk over.

I hid myself completely behind a tree, but upon realizing that the man could discover me at any minute, I panicked, and darted off, back into the woods.

He must have heard the commotion, and began to chase after me, the light of his flashlight bouncing around through the trees, the sound of his heavy boots stomping through the forest ringing out into the night.

I ran as fast as I could and, in the process, must have taken a wrong turn, as I ended up finding myself at a dead end, a narrow but deep ravine, separating me from my escape on the other side.

Turning back, I saw my pursuer closing in, and knew what I had to do…

…I looked down at the ravine, then over at the other side, before taking a few steps back...

...And then, with as much force as I could muster, I ran towards the ravine, sprang from the ground and leapt over it, my feet barely catching the other side.

But when I hit the ground, I felt a terrible pain in my ankle, and toppled to the ground.

*Fuck.*

Lying there, writhing, I looked across the ravine to the other side, expecting the man to hop it too...

...But he never crossed it.

I hobbled up to my feet, only to see him still on the other side, having given up his pursuit, and walking back towards the glen.

Unable to hop the ravine again, my leg still injured, it took me a few hours to find my way back to the car.

I had feared that the four men might have discovered it, and would be there, waiting for me, when I returned. But thankfully, when I finally got to the car, it was just sitting there alone, still parked on the side of the road, exactly where I had left it.

—

When I got back to the hotel, I immediately took a shower, the dirt from my hands and hair washing away into the drain, my mind running a million miles an hour, before heading to bed.

Still terrified by what had just occurred, I turned on the TV, in an attempt to distract myself, but I couldn't stop thinking about the output.

*"The bodies are buried at..." followed by GPS coordinates.*

*If the chatbot was right, then it must have gotten that information from somewhere.* I thought to myself. *But where did it pull it from?*

Just then, something on the TV caught my eye.

It was a breaking news story, its headline reading  "Major Conglomerate Reports Major Data Leak". A reporter commented live from Washington, D.C., "Tonight, thousands of classified documents have been compromised. Representatives for the company are assuring the public that there is nothing to worry about, and that proper safety precautions have since been put into place, to prevent such an oversight from happening again."

*Well fuck me.* I thought to myself.

And then...

RING.

RING.

...My cell phone started ringing.

It was an unknown number, but I picked it up anyway.

"Hello?" I answered, nervously.

"Why'd you go and do that?" A man's voice asked ominously, on the other end.

"Excuse me?"

"You know what you saw."

"I don't know what you're talking about."

"Well, now we have to go ahead and kill you, too."

And then...

CLICK.

...He hung up.

I ran over to the hotel window, and looked down at the street below...

..But it was empty.

*What the fuck do I do now?* I thought to myself, before reaching for my phone and calling Arnold.
