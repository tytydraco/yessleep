It’s easy to look around and see the world crumbling. Here we are, on the cusp of 2025, and the future promised us by pop culture couldn’t be further from reality. The rise of robots and AI seems less a harbinger of a paradise to come than a warning of our fast approaching demise.

If my correspondence with FutureMan is to be believed, that’s precisely correct.

It started when one peculiar email landed in my inbox with the subject, “DISPATCH FROM THE FUTURE.” Its sender was the aptly named “FutureMan.” My initial assumption was that this was some clickbaity message that somehow escaped my spam filter. Nevertheless, I was sitting in my cubicle at work, bored as hell, and figured it might offer a good laugh to lift my spirits.

What better way to kill a few minutes, right? I’d already taken one too many bathroom breaks, which tend to arouse the suspicion of my department head. Reading email looks like busy work, not as obvious as scrolling through subreddits.

So I opened it – I wasn’t on my own computer, what did I care what viruses tagged along?

Instead of viruses, or some convoluted pitch to swindle money from credulous boomers, there was a two-thousand word missive written like a field report from a bizarro future war. It succeeded in curing my boredom for the handful of minutes I spent reading it. Talk of robot battalions, AI spies, a riven America, something called a “data bomb” – crazy stuff.

But no reason to believe it was anything other than engrossing science fiction.

That was until I received follow up dispatches containing accurate predictions of events that took place shortly after I received the emails.

Election results.

Terrorist attacks.

CEO assassinations.

Stuff that made me start to really pay attention. The author of these emails said that they’d managed a “temporal lock” with the receiver, using a lot of complicated jargon I didn’t really understand but could probably best be summed up by saying: they identified the year I lived in and established a strong connection to it using whatever time travel tech they employed.

They also said they knew these messages had been received by an employee of \[REDACTED - not inviting further scrutiny from the powers that be\]. This detail made my hair stand on end. I wasn’t one of thousands receiving these strange emails. If this was some elaborate hoax, then it was being directed at me specifically.

And if it wasn’t…then I guess I was supposed to believe the future had chosen me to warn the present?

Either way, it was more attention than I felt comfortable with, especially from some anonymous sender with uncertain motives. Whether prank or truth, the implications weren’t great. Either a lot of responsibility or a lot of egg on my face. I didn’t like either option, but I supposed I preferred the latter.

One day, I decided to reply. “Ha ha, good joke, who is this, Roger from underwriting?”

The reply came swiftly explaining that no, this was not Roger from underwriting, this was an operative from the year 2057 trying to make contact with the past in order to subvert the expansion of artificial intelligence in his time. “Didn’t you receive my credentials?”

I assumed they meant their predictions, for which I had no reasonable explanation. I’d tried to write them off by saying they were really strong guesses, but when FutureMan provided names – terrorists, assassins, victims – before any were released, it was hard to deny their claims.

“Alright,” I wrote back, “tell me more about yourself then. I need to know who you are if I’m going to trust you.”

They came back with a flat refusal. “I cannot risk exposure. The Turing Bureau is already looking for me.”

I probed this particular detail with a series of questions to which FutureMan provided frightening answers. The Turing Bureau, it turned out, was a governmental body founded by something called the House Inhuman Activities Commission, chaired by an overzealous congressmember tasked with rooting out AI subterfuge.

The irony, FutureMan explained, was that these apparatus more often targeted human agents instead of robot enemies. In the future, apparently robots have honed their human mimicry skills to such a degree that they can integrate into our society without detection. “Spies are everywhere,” wrote Futureman.

Those ruled to be robot abominations were sentenced to “decommissioning.”

They insisted they weren’t one of them, but because their team utilized time travel tech developed by an AI program, they fell under HIAC’s crosshairs. “Humanity is tearing itself apart. The robot enemy’s insidious tactics use our own paranoia against us.”

Over the course of our back and forth, I started to believe.

“Okay, say I trust you - why me?”

“A specialized algorithm has identified the user of your computer (i.e. *you*) as a significant figure or an individual strategically placed to assist in the mission. The algorithm is a black box, we can’t know its logic, but given the deadly accuracy of its creators, I trust in its judgment.”

I refrained from pointing out the irony of trusting in tech developed by an enemy known to deceive. Instead, I politely suggested they try again, as I was just a lowly desk jockey without any means or power to assist them.

“No, I believe in you,” FutureMan insisted.

“Let’s say I wanted to help - tell me how I’d go about it.”

“Will return with instructions. Standby.”

Then came a nerve-racking silence. Weeks passed without further communication from FutureMan. I sent more replies, but after a while it just felt like shooting emails into the void.

I reverted back to my assumption that this was somehow all some cruel joke at my expense. I put FutureMan out of mind, performed my duties, clocked in, clocked out, fell back into the soulless rhythm I’d grown accustomed to.

Then one morning I opened my work email to discover all past correspondence had been wiped. No more FutureMan. I rifled in the various folders, spam, trash, to no avail. Our emails were completely gone.

Five minutes later, I got a call from the department head to attend a meeting in her office.

It was just her.

She told me I was being laid off.

“Why?”

“Downsizing. Nothing personal.”

But my suspicions were raised. Why delete my inbox like that? Why escort me to the front door of the office? Why have me followed in the months since?

Because a blacked out truck now sits at the corner of my block and I can’t help thinking it’s there for me. Who are these people? Why did FutureMan think I could save us? Why does my phone make a clicking noise with every call? Why do YouTube videos stop playing when I’m trying to watch clips about time travel? What’s going on? I feel like I’m losing my damn mind.

And I think that’s the entire [point](https://www.reddit.com/r/JulianVoss/).
