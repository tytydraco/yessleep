Everytown: 

I don’t know when I first got the world. I swear I didn’t download it, but one day it was just in my list: a city called Edmonton. Only… when I loaded it up, the title screen called it Everytown.

The city looks normal at first glance. Skyscrapers, roads, a mall, a bank. It feels like any modern Minecraft city map, except it’s too clean. The streets are empty. The houses have furniture but no owners. And the NPCs… they don’t move. They just stand in place like cardboard cutouts, each one named “NPC.”

At first, I thought it was funny. A half-finished world someone uploaded. But the longer I stayed, the stranger it got.

I always found my house the same way: fly past the bank, then the mall, then take a sharp right. That path worked every time… until one night it didn’t.

The road curved into a bridge I’d never seen before. No turns, no houses, just a long bridge stretching over empty water. I laughed, thinking maybe I was drunk (I have had a few drinks) and turned wrong, but after five minutes of circling I felt panic rising. My house wasn’t there. The world had rearranged itself when I wasn’t looking.

And then the game kicked me out. No error message, no “disconnected.” Just black screen desktop.

When I reloaded the world, my house was back. Everything exactly as I remembered.

I almost convinced myself I imagined it. Until the next glitch.

Scrolling through old Snapchat memories, I found a picture I’d taken of my crystals on vacation. I know I was in BC. I remember the cabin, the mountains, the cold. But the caption on the snap read: “Sleeping with my crystals in Colorado.”

I stared at it for ten minutes, trying to remember. Had I been in Colorado? No. That doesn’t even make sense. But the text was mine, my style, my spacing. It was like the past had been edited when I wasn’t looking.

That’s when I noticed the other changes.

Signs in Everytown would read differently each time I looked. Main St. became Mane St. A billboard said Chair Expo 2025, then later 2023. One NPC was named Dave, another Dan, another both at once.

In Gervason’s Grocery, at the back of the store, I found Dave (or Dan). He spoke — which shouldn’t even be possible in Education Edition. His dialogue box said:

“I’ve got discs for sale. Normal ones. Except for one. You don’t want that one.”

He was selling music discs for emeralds. Too many emeralds. Hundreds. One disc was missing, replaced with one called #10. Its price was thousands. I never bought it. I don’t think I want to know what it plays.

And the noises.

Minecraft has cave sounds, I know that. But these weren’t caves. They were skyscrapers. The game registered them as caves, so I’d hear the moans, the hisses, the hollow ringing of something below the floors. But sometimes, just sometimes, there was something else underneath. A voice. A faint recording. Words I couldn’t quite make out, but desperate, pained. Like a tape loop, stretched and rotting.

The game crashes more often now. Sometimes when I fly too far, sometimes when I stand still too long. Each time, I get this feeling: not that the game broke, but that the world rejected me.

I’ve tried to tell myself it’s just file corruption, a bug in Education Edition, maybe too many resource packs. But then why does it feel… intentional?

Last night, I saw something new.

Flying over the mall, I looked down and saw myself. Another me, standing still on the road. No name tag, no movements. Just my skin, staring straight up at me. I landed to check — and it was gone.

I don’t know if it was a glitch. I don’t know if it was supposed to be there.

But I do know this: Everytown isn’t a normal map. It doesn’t want to be played.

It wants to be remembered differently by everyone who enters.

I remember my house being three stories. Maybe it was two. Maybe it never existed.

Maybe I don’t, either
