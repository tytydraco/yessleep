What do you do when you call Death to your door?

 

I let him in. Not as an enemy. Not as a monster. He was there to help me, I've been inviting him for so long, and tonight, I finally opened the door.

The tub was already overflowing when I stepped inside. The water spilled across the floor in thin streams, hiding the mess I was about to make. I told myself it didn’t matter anymore. A wet floor could be cleaned. Everything else… couldn’t.

I sat there for a while before doing anything. The water was too hot, but I stayed still and let it burn. My tears mixed with it, salt and heat on my skin.

He didn’t need me to explain. Death doesn’t need explanations. But I found myself talking anyway, repeating things I’d already thought a thousand times.

“My life has been hell,” I whispered. My voice shook. “Everything I did… it never mattered. Is that fair?”

The silence stretched. Then a voice answered, low and broken.

“It isn’t,” the reaper said, as if trying to take the weight from my shoulders.

“I wanted it to end quickly. I didn’t want to be here anymore. This world had torn me from the script; I was never meant to stay, never meant to be human. I fought against faith, but it gave me nothing in return—because I didn’t matter anymore.

I looked over at the empty bottle of little candies to help make the world shut its damn mouth. It’ll help make everything go faster. I didn’t want to waste my time anymore thinking I was wanted. The clock stopped working for me, so why should I give it the little time I have left.

I clutched the cold tool that would be used to finally relax. It seemed so easy when talking about it to the spirit, doing it was somehow even easier, in that moment. It pinched at first, then like a being drowned taking that last fresh breath of air… it was happening I was…

“Then why do people keep blaming me...” I said weakly.

“They don’t.” He reassured me and followed along with...

“You didn’t notice, did you?” As if he was talking through me.

 I didn’t believe the figure; people had blamed me for everything that happened to them was somehow my fault. Then what he said suddenly struck me.

What? Notice what? My chest suddenly tightened, my fists closing, trying to grip into my palm. Why was I panicking? I chose this. It was my choice—finally, my choice. For once I had decided.

I looked up at the faded shape wanting to ask what it meant- Then I could hear it.

Buzz.... buzz... buzz... The sound was slowly creeping into my ears; I saw the light on the counter. I knew what it was I before I even looked: my friends, their voices echoing in my head, reaching out to me. I tried to rip the words out of my throat; it wasn’t my choice to make anymore.

My wrists gushing blood, I tried to stand up to maybe find something that could bring me back. But my wrist suddenly made a small gnawing sound, I looked back at the slices that my own choices had made, something was crawling into my arm towards them.

I struggled, putting my hands on the sides and tried to get out of the rose-stained water until my arms suddenly flew back, like something was pulling me back in, confused I looked back to see flesh like tendrils had grown out of my own wrists, they got stuck to the tub like they had merged to the vessel, I attempted to pull away from the tub but it didn’t let me break away, it felt like my body had already made my choice, it wasn’t listening to my mind anymore.

I wanted to apologize to all the people I was going to hurt, that I was leaving. In a way… I think my mind already knew too I wasn’t going to give back the hope they did, that I didn’t realize that they were giving. I wanted to… but my body had chosen for me.

No… No! “No! I changed my mind!” I ripped the words out.

I tried to grab the wet exposed muscles and pulled them off or away from the tub. They looked like some kind of virus, bulging and slowly spreading.

“No! I need to…” I cried out.

“You don’t need to do anything anymore, it won’t matter.” It quietly said.

“Please! Let me change it! I don’t want this!” I yelled at it, expecting some kind of reaction.

I could feel my legs shaking, wanting to leave, I felt the tendrils, grow out of my eyes forcing my head back onto the tub. I used all my strength to try and pull apart of the cell I had made for myself.

I clawed at the disgusting tendrils that bubbled out of my skin, keeping me bound, my nails breaking in half as more of them succeeded in penetrating through. The liquid dripping from my eyes was hot, it felt like it burned my skin.

I felt every piercing of flesh growth through my skin, if there wasn’t an opening it was making one. I looked at the figure that would take me away, hatred in my eyes.

It just stood up and grabbed my phone… it showed me the messages, all of them asking me if i was alright, if I needed help. Two hours too late—every voice I had silenced was now screaming on the screen.

I crumbled back into the tub. The tendrils didn’t need to drag me anymore; my body had given up all over again. The crimson-stained porcelain had become my cell, and I no longer fought to leave it.

“It’s not your body anymore, you gave it up.” It responded more human like this time.

It put its hand on my shoulder. As I accepted what was going to happen to me, I had no longer a decision to make, it was made when I opened the doorway to Death.
