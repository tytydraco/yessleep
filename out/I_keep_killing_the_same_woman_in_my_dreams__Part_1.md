Her wavy strawberry blond hair enveloped her while she flashed a blushed smile at me as we passed each other in a parking lot. My heart warmed, butterflies stirred deep in my stomach, an ache, almost a hunger, even though we’d never met.

*Was this love at first sight?* I silently asked myself.

When she was behind me, I chanced another glance back at her, hoping she would do the same. As I turned, a hand rose in front of me holding something metallic and black. Before I could process what was happening, a thunderous explosion rang my ears and her head kicked forward into a red mist. Her body crumpled into a graceless, beautiful heap and a thick ruby pool quickly began forming around her darkening strawberry hair. The hand, *my hand,* quickly turned and pointed the handgun back towards its master.

I woke up screaming in my buddy’s apartment. The night before, we had placed a tiny square of paper on our tongues and stayed up playing video games, watching cartoons, and occasionally staring at the patterns that the walls and carpets breathed into existence. We did this pretty much every weekend; experimented with whatever “research chemicals” we could get our hands on. Or if we were lucky, actual LSD. I don’t remember what they called this specific chemical, not that the name we were given would have been accurate, and not that we would have cared.

I haven’t had a “good night’s rest” since. Insomnia and solitude have greatly depreciated my short and long term memory. All I know for sure these days is that I am alone, pale, and the day I will die.

I don’t know who she is, or who she was, just that she always ends up dead. The need fills me the same way hunger fills an abandoned small child. The child does not understand why they are in their predicament, what they did to end up there, or what they could have done differently. Just that they need to eat. They cannot control their hunger. They simply try to find something to ease the burden of nature’s chore. But each time they find something to fill the void beyond their naval, they wake up with an empty stomach.

I told my friend about my dream and we both brushed it off as a “bad trip.” Sleeping can be difficult to achieve when you’re tripping and we both have commonly watched “eyelid movies.” This is when you close your eyes with the intention of sleeping, but instead your mind just kind of runs wild while hallucinating. It’s similar to dreaming, but you are awake and aware that you are awake. Sometimes eyelid movies are not very pleasant.

That day we bought a different flavor of colorful paper squares and did what we knew how to do best; trip balls and piss away the “potential” our parents and teachers always preached about. I do not remember the dream I had that night, just that she was in it, and that I killed her.

My friend was not at all pleased to hear the explanation I gave when I woke up screaming again, and that was the last time we hung out. I think it was the last time I saw him. He stopped replying to my texts a few days later when I kept bringing up the dreams and started asking repeatedly if he could find out what we had taken. I don’t blame him really. We would hear tales of people going insane from frequent sessions of hallucination, but chalked them up to campfire stories.

A couple days, or weeks later- I can’t remember -I was standing in the kitchen of the 2 bed 2 bath apartment I shared with Van and Mara, a couple that I served tables with at a local diner.

“Hey man, a-are you doing okay?” Van asked hesitantly.

“What?” I asked in surprise, realising the mostly-empty fridge was open in front of me.

*Damnit. I’m fucking falling asleep standing up.*

“I asked if you’re doing okay.” Van repeated. “Mara told me she’s been hearing you screaming in your room late at night. And not the typical crap we hear when you’re playing League.”

“Oh. Yeah. I’m alright,” I lied. “Just been having some bad dreams lately. Sorry.”

I grabbed a 16oz sugar free red bull, closed the fridge and cracked it open.

“Ah damn. About what?” Van asked, sounding genuinely concerned. “She said it sounded like you were being murdered or something. Really had her freaked out.”

“I don’t really remember, I just keep waking up panicked,” I lied again. “Tell her I’m sorry-or-I’ll tell her tonight at work.”

“Nah, don’t worry about it dude. She’ll be fine.” Van replied as he eyed the drink in my hand. “You closing tonight?”

“Yeah, hopefully I’ll make some decent tips. I haven’t made shit this week.” I said as I walked to my room and shut the door.

I hadn’t made much money because I wasn’t serving my tables well. I was messing up the most basic of food orders and Van knew this. All of the staff know when you’re fucking up orders at a restraunt. I was too tired to function properly.

When I did sleep I would have the dreams. They became longer and more gruesome as time went on. Sometimes they would feel like they lasted hours, just for me to wake up 20 minutes after falling asleep. It wouldn't be *unbearable* if these dreams were accompanied by even a few hours of rest, but I never felt rested. Sometimes I would have a half dozen of these dreams or more in one night. Back to back to back to back. Often I would wake up with muscle fatigue, my legs cramping and back sore.

The dreams were always different, and I often couldn’t remember most of what happened shortly after waking up. Except for the first dream I had of her. That one was etched into my mind. Occasionally even playing as an eyelid movie while awake and sober, although sleep deprived.

At first I tried to just stay awake for a few days and see if I could “reset” whatever I had knocked loose in my head. I know it doesn’t make sense, but I guess I was looking for an excuse to not see *her*. I took a couple days off lined up with my normal off-days and picked up some Adderall. I locked myself in my room and played on my computer for days, just keeping myself busy and awake as long as I could.

I think it was day 3 or 4. I got up from my computer to clean my room in another attempt to stay awake and before I could turn on the light, I froze involuntarily. There she was asleep in bed, but somehow not *my* bed. I was not longer in my room, or any room I recognized.

The remaining dusk sunlight filtering through the blinds presented her as a silhouette. When the light turned on I saw her in full color under the covers. Then, after bouncing her head off of the night stand a few dozen times, I saw her in crimson again.

“DIE, WHORE! FUCKING DIE! WHY WON’T YOU LEARN THE MEANING OF AN ETERNAL REST?” I yelled as her hair, skull and brains churned into an indistinguishable mush in my hands.

I woke up screaming in my chair in front of my computer. This would eventually become entry #2.

*Did I just yell that shit in real life, too?*

Van and Mara moved out shortly after.

Therapists didn’t help. Recreational drugs made it worse. And the inevitable grippy-sock vacations all ended the same. A variety of diagnoses; chronic sleep paralysis, narcolepsy, sleep apnea, and a new prescription that would have no positive effect.

Every time that I slept, I dreamt. In every dream I would see her. And every time I would see her she would die by my unwilling hand. I do not want to kill her. I am simply a vessel being steered by something else
