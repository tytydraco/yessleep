I’ve always been obsessed with sound. As a freelance podcaster, I spend hours tinkering with my equipment—condenser mics, mixers, noise filters—trying to capture the perfect audio. Last month, I was working on a new episode, something mundane about local history, when I noticed it: a faint hum buried in the background of my recording. It wasn’t feedback or interference from my cheap apartment’s wiring. It was steady, low, almost like a heartbeat but sharper, more mechanical. I couldn’t edit it out no matter how hard I tried.

At first, I thought it was just an annoyance. I re-recorded the segment three times, swapped out cables, even moved my setup to the kitchen table. The hum was still there, persistent, threading through every file like it was mocking me. I gave up and uploaded the episode anyway, figuring listeners wouldn’t notice. That was my first mistake.

Two days later, my friend Matt texted me: “Dude, what’s with that creepy noise in your podcast? Gave me a headache all day.” I laughed it off, told him it was just equipment noise. Then my sister called. She’d listened too, and her voice was shaky. “I don’t know what you put in that episode, but I’ve been hearing it everywhere since. I didn’t sleep last night.” I checked the file again. The hum was louder now, clearer, like it had grown teeth.

I deleted the episode from the hosting site, but the damage was done. Downloads don’t disappear—they spread. By the end of the week, I had emails from strangers. One guy said he’d smashed his phone after listening because the hum wouldn’t stop echoing in his head. Another said she’d blacked out and woken up with her hands scratched raw, like she’d clawed at something. I felt sick. What had I unleashed?

Then it started happening to me. I’d be washing dishes or walking to the corner store, and there it was—the hum, faint but undeniable, pulsing in my ears. It wasn’t coming from my headphones or speakers; it was inside me. And with it came flashes—images I couldn’t place. A dark basement. A flickering lightbulb. Someone screaming. I’d blink, and they’d be gone, leaving my heart racing and my palms sweaty.

I tore apart my apartment looking for the source. That’s when I found it: an old cassette recorder in a box of junk I’d inherited from my parents’ house after they passed. It was dusty, the kind with clunky buttons and a faded “Play” label. I didn’t remember owning it, but something about it felt heavy, familiar. I pressed play, and there was the hum, loud and jagged, layered under static. But there was something else—a voice, distorted, mumbling words I couldn’t make out. My voice? 

No, it couldn’t be.
The flashes got worse after that. I’d see that basement again, smell damp concrete, hear the scream—high-pitched, desperate. I started remembering things I’d buried deep. When I was eight, my older brother disappeared. They found him days later in a storm drain, said he’d wandered off and drowned. I was there when it happened, wasn’t I? 

I’d blocked it out, but the hum was dragging it back. I saw his face in those flashes, twisted in panic, his hands reaching for me as water swallowed him. And that scream—it was mine.
Last night, I hooked the recorder to my laptop and ran the audio through a spectrograph, desperate to understand. The hum wasn’t random noise. It was a frequency, 19 Hz, just below human hearing— infrasound, the kind that messes with your mind, makes you see things. 

But there was more: a second layer, a voice, slowed down and warped. I sped it up, cleaned the static, and listened. It was me, eight years old, sobbing: “I didn’t mean to push him. I’m sorry.”

I froze. Push him? No, that wasn’t right. He fell. I didn’t… did I? The memory hit like a freight train: we’d been playing by the drain, arguing over some stupid toy. I shoved him, just a kid’s tantrum, but he stumbled, slipped into the water. I tried to grab him, but he was gone. I’d told myself it was an accident, locked it away for twenty years. The hum knew. It had been there, somehow, recording my guilt.

I smashed the recorder with a hammer, burned the pieces in a trash can behind my building. The hum stopped—for now. But I can’t unhear that voice, my voice, confessing. And I can’t undo what’s out there. People are still listening to that episode, still hearing the frequency. I check the download stats every day, watching the numbers climb. Hundreds now. Thousands soon. What happens when it reaches them all?

I don’t know where that recorder came from or how it captured what it did. I don’t know if breaking it really stopped anything. Sometimes, in the quiet, I think I hear it again—a low, steady pulse, waiting. I’m posting this because I need someone to know, someone to tell me I’m not crazy. If you find that episode online, don’t listen. Please. I can’t be responsible for more.
