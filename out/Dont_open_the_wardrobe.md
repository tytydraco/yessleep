I used to spend a lot of time with my grandfather, he was never very strict with me and I could basically do whatever I want he only ever had one rule. Don't open the wardrobe, it was so ingrained into my brain that I never questioned it. The wardrobe in question was an old, antique wardrobe, the kind you'd find in well, your grandfather's house.
 It was raised by four wooden legs and had a sloped top, kind of like a grandfather clock without the clock. One day, some kid threw a baseball through the window and it hit the wardrobe. Now the wardrobe wasn't exactly made of titanium, bits had been chipped off it for years and the wood was weak enough that the ball pelted a gigantic hole through the wardrobe. I didn't think anything of it so I went to bed all the same that night. That was the first time I saw it. 

I was lying in bed and I heard this really weird noise. I turned to face the wardrobe and there it was. Two eyes, staring straight at me. I wanted to scream but I couldn't, and you can think twice if you thought I was about to get out of my bed and closer to that thing so instead I just pulled the duvet up and across my head so that I was fully enveloped.

 10 years later, I had forgotten about that night. My Granfather had passed away due to "mysterious circumstances" and since I had no other family, I had inherited the house. Me and my girlfriend were clearing out the house of all the junk and there was the wardrobe, "might aswell get rid of it" I thought to myself looking at the dishevelled oak coubard. So off it went with all of the rubbish In a great big skip headed for a landfill or something. 

2 days later I was lying in bed trying to go to sleep, I went up to use the bathroom and there it was, the wardrobe with its sloped roof and wonky legs. Freaked out I tried to wake my girlfriend up, "hey did you put that stupid wardrobe back in the house?" but she was still fast asleep. I shook it off as hallucinations and went back to bed though this time a little further into the covers. When I woke up my girlfriend had already left for work so I couldn't ask her about it, because the wardrobe was still there. I shook it off and figured she must have a weird attachment to it. I would ask her when she got back.

She didn't come back. The police officer told me she had died in "mysterious circumstances" and they just found her body, no fingerprints, no blood, no sign of a heart attack no nothing. I was distraught, I just went to bed and cried by myself for hours until I passed out. When I woke up it was already dark and the street lights were on. I went into the hallway and there it was. 

The wardrobe only now it was different, the wardrobe was open. There was someone there, a tall but thin figure wearing a black robe. It was staring at me, straight into my sole but it didn't have any eyes and it's mouth was gaping open and showed only a black hole inside. The humanoid creature then let out the most blood-curdling scream I've ever heard. It started towards me, I dashed down the stairs and straight to the door. 

Then it grabbed me, shattering the window on the door as it did, I picked up a shard of glass and plunged it deep into its arm or tentacle whatever you call it. I ran away and didn't look back I'm hiding now as I'm writing this- I cam hear it getting closer... I think it knows where I am. Goodbye cruel world.
