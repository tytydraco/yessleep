As I dressed in my elegant tuxedo and tie, I got ready to get to a jamboree on the top of a hill. There was a special party at the house on top of the hill. Every year the mayor of our city hosts an event for people who can't seem to find love in the world. A place for introverts, social outcasts, and lovely people to find. Today was my chance to be someone else, to come out of my lonely shell for once. After all, I had tried to get someone to love on Tumblr, and ​valentines day. This was my only chance to prove myself wrong.

Before exiting the house I immediately grabbed my umbrella and walked to the bus station. It was a rainy day, a bummer for most revelers and party animals, but a dream come true for introverts. When I got to the bus stop, I was approached by an elderly woman​ with a white gown and pearly white high heels. I asked her if she was going to the party too and she replied saying

"Listen here young man, I wouldn't go to the party if I were you, did you not hear about the murderer of 1992?" She rasped

I asked what murder but she interrupted saying that I should go to her party, because it was her birthday anyway. I told her I didn't have time yet, and said maybe next year.

The bus had arriv

Before the bus doors closed she said that:

"What if you or I die today, then who's going to my birthday party next year, and who will keep my alive!" She croaked

Right before I could respond the bus drove off to the block where the hill was. I sighed in relief that she was finally gone. When the bus finally arrived I thanked the bus driver and gave him a tip before walking up the hill to house.

After arriving at the house I was greeted by a brown-haired girl who had a sparkling red gown as red as blood. She told me to make myself at home. Before she walked away she announced that she ran this party and that she has the right to kick anyone. I nodded and walked away. After wandering around the house I stumbled upon the liquor cabinet, there were drinks missing from their spots so I figured I could take a drink too. After all, one wouldn't hurt, so I chugged the entire bottle down, but as soon as I finished the bottle, I fainted face down on the floor.

I woke up in pitch darkness with nothing but the rain and lightning to enlighten the room.   I figured that the party was over and I overslept too long; which was a bummer because this was my only chance to enjoy it. So I steadily walked towards the front door of the mansion but when I touched the door knob...

...

I heard a loud blood curdling scream coming from the dining room. I slowly rushed towards the entrance of the dining room and found some light coming through the doorway. That was weird, all the lights in the mansion were off. But without hesitation I looked in doorway and saw... What I wished I had never seen... What I saw was dead bodies sitting face down on the dinner table's chairs with their head on the plate. Their back ribcage opened with their organs rotting away. The putrid smell made my cover my nose... I also saw a large thick man wearing a burlap bag over his head with only a hole to show his eyes, ontop of that I saw a dark blue jean bucket hat with cotton on the inside, a dark blue jean cargo jacket with fluffy cotton on the inside similar to his bucket hat, a thick casing of leather dark blue cargo pants tied with a rope belt, a black cherry colored pair of leather muddy boots and finally, a blood stained machete. From what I could tell, the murderer was nailing the same girl that greeted me. She was nailed in a crucifix like shape. Her lasts words that I heard were "P-please, let (groan) me go..." before the killer started to impale his machete into her upper abdomen and dragging it into her lower abdomen. Her organs and bones started spilling out as blood covered the killer's face and clothes. I immediately tiptoes to the nearest phone to dial the police but.. I realized someone had cut the wires to the phone. Something was very off. I went back to the frontdoor tugging on it rapidly...

The door didn't budge, it just made more noise.

I heard loud footsteps coming closer and closer, I knew I had attracted him, so I proceeded to elude the area by stepping on the non-loose planks until I made it to the living room. I discovered the door to the basement was open, unlike before where it was sealed shut, with no other option I leaped into the area and carefully walked down the wooden stairs. As I explored deeper into the basement, I found a decapitated police officer's body under the stairs. I noticed a double barrel shotgun beside him. Without thinking I immediately took the gun. When I found the gun I spotted a washing machine still spinning. It was peculiar, it stuck out like a sore thumb. I stopped the machine and opened the machine's door. There I found the police officer's head inside. It startled me causing me to fall backwards onto the cement floor. My head bruised a little and started bleeding. It wasn't as bad as the gravity of my situation. I saw something shiny inside of the officer's head and found...

...

A bullet! I checked into the shotgun's magazine and found nothing, So I inserted the bullet into the magazine and proceeded to walk upstairs. When I went upstairs the I saw muddy boot tracks leading upstairs. With the chance, I went into the dining room again...

The smell of rotten corpses filled the room as I looked around at the bodies for something useful. As I was checking the corpses the killer had spotted me on the inside balcony. I had to hide... I looked around trying to find somewhere.. But then I suddenly found the pantry door. I ran into the door and closed the door softly as fast as I could.

In the nick of time someone had entered the room with their weapon ready. I had my weapon ready too... I heard some footsteps getting closer, and closer before finally they stopped walking....

...

...

I heard a loud gunshot coming from the hallway. I stood in pure silence as my heart slowly beated again. The door suddenly opened to reveal the town's sheriff beside the body of the killer.

"What in the world are you doing here?!" He said

"I was just trying to leave this place." I replied

"Well come on, we'll get you out of here." He responded

I was quickly escorted out of mansion. The sheriff also took my shotgun on the way out.

Before I had the chance to thank him, paramedics arrived so as the police. Before I could question what had just happened, I was taken back to my house by a cop after the whole incident happened. Turns out the mayor planned this party and the murder and he only did the last two parties to make it seem normal. The mayor was sent a death penalty and was soon to die in death row.

What bothered me was that **I was the only survivor.** I still remember this event like it was yesterday. This event gave me a fear of parties and trust issues later on, I recovered by going to a therapist often.
