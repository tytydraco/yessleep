Man, those old home videos. They’re all grainy, the colors washed out, like the sun bleached the memory right off the tape. But there we are. Me and Kevin. Skinny little punks on our bikes, that Indiana sun just cooking the asphalt. Kevin’s got this huge, goofy grin, a little crooked, yeah, thanks to that chipped tooth from the tree – that kid, he just *believed*. Like anything was possible, like we were living in some kind of adventure movie. Me? Even now, watching it again, there’s this tightness in my chest, like I’m just waiting for something bad to happen. Always have been, I guess. 1993. Twelve years old. We really didn’t have a goddamn clue what was coming.

I can’t watch them too often, those tapes. It’s a gut punch, right here. Reminds you of… before. When scraped knees felt like the end of the world. Now it’s just… quiet after you hit stop. Too quiet. Like the silence is full of the things that aren’t there anymore. Like you can almost hear them if you listen close enough.

We grew up in that small town, southern Indiana, right on the edge of the Hoosier. Picture it: those old houses with the wide porches where the paint was always peeling a little, the cicadas just *screaming* all summer long, that smell of wet dirt and dead leaves that just clung to everything, even your clothes. After school, our bikes, man, that was it. That was the whole damn world. Every crack in the sidewalk, every overgrown lot, fueled by cheap juice boxes and that energy you just can’t buy, can’t get back no matter how hard you try.

And then there was Blacktop Road.

Nobody called it that officially. County Road 300 South, I guess, on the maps. But everyone around here, we just knew it as Blacktop. It snaked out of our neighborhood and just… dove into this thick patch of woods. Maybe a mile? The trees were so tall, so close, they practically touched overhead, even when the sun was blazing everywhere else, it was always dim there. The road was all busted up, the air always felt colder, heavier, thick with the smell of damp earth and those decaying leaves, that almost sweet, rotten smell.

I hated that road, man. Not a monster-under-the-bed hate. More like… this feeling. This deep-down wrongness the second we turned onto it. The way the light did these weird things through the leaves, all fractured and broken. The rustling that always sounded like people whispering just out of sight, just at the edge of the trees. It just freaked me out. I’d pedal like hell, trying to get out of there, my eyes jumping at every shadow that moved, every sound that wasn’t just the tires on the cracked asphalt.

Kevin, that little maniac, he ate that shit up. He’d be yelling, laughing at me, calling me a chicken, his voice echoing in the trees. “Dude, it’s just trees!” He was like that. Fearless. This little Fred Savage lookalike with the perpetually scraped knees and this insane need for adventure. With him there, even Blacktop Road felt… almost okay. His dumb confidence, it was like this force field, this shield against whatever my brain was conjuring up in those woods.

I remember this one night, late September. You could feel fall coming, that crispness in the air. The sun was already going down, making the sky all these crazy colors, all bruised oranges and purples. We were racing, like always. First one to the streetlight at the entrance, that was the deal.

And that night? I was actually winning. I don’t know, maybe it was the cool air biting at my cheeks, maybe I just got lucky for once, but my legs felt good, I was breathing easy. I looked back – stupid, I know, you never look back – and Kevin was a few lengths back, yeah, but he was grinning, pushing hard. But maybe… maybe there was something else in his eyes that I didn’t see then. A tightness around them.

We hit Blacktop Road, and bam, that cold, heavy feeling hits you, like a wall. The trees just swallow the light, just close in around you. The wind screamed past my ears, damn near drowned out the sound of our tires crunching on the gravel. That creepy feeling was there, like it always was, but I was too focused on winning. Just kept pedaling, eyes glued to that little bit of light up ahead, that orange glow waiting for me.

Then I’m out. Back on our street, and it’s like taking a breath after holding it too long, that release. I look back, expecting to see Kevin right there, his goofy grin, but… nothing. Just the shadows getting longer in the quiet of the evening.

It wasn’t instant panic, not at first. Just… where the hell is he? Maybe he stopped, dropped his chain, got a flat. I waited by the streetlight, that pale orange glow making everything look weird and stretched out, those long, distorted shadows. The minutes just crawled by, each one heavier than the last. That feeling of winning, it was just… gone. Replaced by this knot in my stomach that just kept tightening, twisting.

Then the streetlights click on, that pale, fake light, and it makes the shadows jump. And Kevin’s still not there..

That’s when it hit, that cold, awful fear. Just washed over me, made my legs feel like they were full of concrete. The idea of going back down that road, by myself, in the dark? No freakin’ way. Every shadow looked like it was moving, like it had a shape, every leaf that rustled sounded like something coming closer, something breathing.

I just ran. Crying, yeah, trying to tell my parents what happened, but it all came out wrong, all choked up. The phone calls, the looks on their faces, Kevin’s parents… the search party going out into the dark, their flashlights slicing through the trees. It’s all blurry now, like some messed-up dream I can’t shake off.

They found his bike the next day. Way off the road, deep in the trees, all twisted up in the bushes. His jacket was there too, that old denim one with the worn collar, snagged on a low branch. But no Kevin. Just the jacket and the bike, like he’d just… vanished.

The cops, the volunteers calling out his name, dogs barking in the woods, that hollow, desperate sound… nothing. He was just… gone. Like the woods just reached out, those long, dark arms, and took him. Swallowed him whole.

For years, man, I’d just replay that night. The race, the wind in my ears, that stupid feeling of winning. And then… nothing. That empty road stretching back into the darkness. The regret just sticks with you, doesn’t it? Like a bad taste you can’t get rid of. Why didn’t I wait? Why didn’t I just turn around? I should have turned around.

Even back then, I’d get this image in my head on Blacktop Road. This dark shape standing in the trees, just watching, just at the edge of the light. Never really saw it, not clearly, just my stupid imagination, I told myself. But after Kevin… I’d catch myself staring into the woods, especially when the sun started to go down, thinking I’d see it. That silent figure waiting in the shadows. Waiting.

Thirty-one years, man. Thirty-one years and he’s still gone. The “what ifs” still get me sometimes, late at night, when everything’s quiet. What if I’d slowed down? What if I hadn’t been so focused on winning for once? Sometimes, in my dreams, I do slow down. I turn back. And I see him there, but then the dream just… cuts out. There’s just a sound. Like a snap, yeah, or maybe… maybe it’s just the silence rushing in to fill the space where he used to be.

When I drive back home now, for holidays, for whatever, I always slow down when I get to that stretch of 300 South. Blacktop Road. The trees are taller now, the shadows darker, longer, and they seem to creep further across the road. And even now, after all this time, there’s that little flicker of fear, that cold spot deep in my chest.

I still see it sometimes, that shape in the trees, just for a split second, hanging at the edge of my vision.

You know, looking back… looking back on all of it, it hits me now, hard. Kevin definitely let me win that race. He *never* let me win. He was too competitive, too proud. That night… when I looked back, there was something in his eyes. Not just the grin. There was something… else. Something tight, something… scared. And when he yelled, “Whoa, you’re actually gonna beat me this time! Keep it up, man!” It wasn’t like him. It was like he was trying too hard. Trying to sound normal.

He saw something in those trees that night. I’m sure of it now. Whatever the hell was hunting us that night. He wasn’t racing me. He was making damn sure *I* got to those streetlights. He was putting distance between me and whatever the hell *it* was. And him… he was left alone with it. He knew. He knew if we had done things the same, him making it to the streetlight first like always, maybe… maybe he would be the one sitting here, thirty-one years later, writing this. And maybe… maybe *I* was the target that night. It was watching us, in those trees, I can feel it, even now. It knew I was slower, yeah, always a little slower. It knew I was the easier target. Just thinking about it now… my skin crawls. My stomach turns. Dammit, Kevin.
