I'm not even sure if I'm writing to anyone. You might be one of the final people left who read words and not just perceive them anymore, in their heads, like me.

A small comet, not larger than 300 meters across, had been pulled into our planet's gravity and became our new moon. Astronomers did not know why. It did not behave normally. Its path was too regular. Others suggested it had been synchronized with our planet's rotation by design. At first, it had been seen as a miracle. A second moon! The media had dubbed it “Selene.”

And then scientists discovered microbes upon it. Microbes that would not have endured cold temperatures, or vacuum, or. anything. Microbes that moved.

The UN quarantined where it had first been discovered—Alaska. No human could be allowed to investigate it firsthand. Only drones. Only AI. I remember thinking that would be an extreme step. Now I get it.

Something did leak nevertheless.

The microbes underwent evolution--faster than anything had before. They copied cells. Animals. Even humans. On their own. They reshaped themselves. As if memory had been embedded within their DNA.

There are, of course, the animals. The rabbits, geckos, insects revealed by a break-in into an illicit lab. They started to die. And not from infection, but from duplication. Their habits--twitches, stances--duplicated by bacteria. The animals witnessed it.

We Glassed the location. America didn't take us seriously, but now everyone knows. Because it's not Alaska any longer.

Fishermen began reporting a song heard in the Pacific a year ago. No words. Humming. Something familiar, yet. off. A childhood nursery song you never heard but somehow recall. Somewhat unsettling. All of them described it the same.

There had been the sightings. Jellyfish-like creatures combined with dragonflies. Shadow-beings approximating human shape. There had been one spotted outside of Pyongyang. Soldiers attempted to capture it. It dissolved into the ground.

When it came back in Shanghai, it spoke. Not out loud. But in our heads. In perfect English, Mandarin, Arabic, all at once.

One word.

Remember

What's transpired since then? The planet has started to hum. Like, literally. A humming noise, from deep within the crust. Seismic activity all over. Humans all over globe reporting it. Animals, as well. And a few humans. Not infected. Just. strange. Like they're tuned.

The ISS crew had been blinded for 11 minutes.

There are cults formed around them. They are worshiped by some. Others rebel. The countries are collapsing. The nuclear weapons are accumulating. And what about the comet? It cracked like an egg three days back.

They're here now. They're watching us. They talk to us in our dreams. They've been waiting, I guess.

It's evolution, according to some. Others cling to a cosmic glitch theory. A punishment by God. A colonization of an ancient alien civilization. Others think it's a memory from before our universe happened.

I do not know which is worse, that they arrived

.or that we would turn into them.

It appears that you are implying that you need someone who doesn't forget to be present with you.
