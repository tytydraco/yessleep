At approximately 5 o'clock in the morning, my phone began to ring, and upon answering, I was greeted by a familiar voice I had known for quite some time. The message conveyed was that I was to report to the nearest military base promptly. Hastily, I assembled my essentials into a backpack and set off for the base.

Upon arrival, I was escorted by heavily armed soldiers to the commanding office, where General Henry was seated in his chair, calmly puffing on a cigar. The General and I shared a long-standing acquaintance, having known each other for a significant period.

The General sat with his hands resting on his knees, deeply engrossed in puffing at his cigar. His eyes met mine with a familiar gaze that I had witnessed countless times before. Curious, I inquired, "What's the situation, General?" However, he remained silent for a prolonged moment, continuing to relish his cigar with closed eyes, as I observed the flickering flames dancing on its tip.

After some time, he finally spoke with a sense of gravity, "You have been selected for a matter of utmost importance. Your presence here has great significance." He proceeded to reveal that my country required my involvement and that I was to be dispatched to Guam, where all the pertinent details would be divulged to me. The General's demeanor conveyed the seriousness of the situation, leaving me with no doubt about the importance of obeying his orders.

Subsequently, I was airlifted to Guam, and upon arrival, we were taken to a headquarters facility. There, I had the honor of meeting Admiral Lee, who graciously escorted me to a conference room where several individuals were already seated. Taking my place among them, Admiral Lee commenced the briefing.

In the meeting, he disclosed the reason for our presence. The US Navy had detected peculiar readings emanating from the Mariana Trench. Our collective mission was to venture into the depths and unravel the mystery behind these enigmatic signals, diligently striving to uncover the source responsible for these unusual occurrences.

A query arose from someone in the gathering, questioning the rationale behind sending human personnel instead of utilizing robots and machines. In response, the Admiral explained that machines and robots come with substantial costs and prove challenging to retrieve in the event of any mishaps.

When I inquired about the potential risks and the safety of the mission, the Admiral simply chuckled dismissively, advising me not to ask such queries. Undeterred, he proceeded to clarify that we would be utilizing a specially upgraded submarine, designed to navigate the trench effortlessly, mitigating any concerns that may arise during the expedition.

The Admiral emphasized that the mission would persist until the enigmatic source of the strange readings was discovered. Once he concluded briefing us about the mission, he advised everyone to ensure a good night's rest as we would be embarking on the expedition the following morning. With that, the Admiral departed from the room, leaving us to prepare ourselves for the momentous task ahead.

As we headed to our designated barracks to rest for the night, I heard a familiar voice calling out my name. To my delight, it was Peter, my best friend from high school. Overjoyed, I rushed to meet him, exclaiming, "It's great to see you, Peter!"
We reminisced about our shared time in the Navy, although I had since left the service while he chose to continue his dedicated service to the Navy. Our encounter brought back fond memories, and we spent some time catching up before retiring to our respective barracks, looking forward to the mission that awaited us the next morning.

As the morning dawned, we were roused from our slumber and directed to the harbor where the submarine awaited us. Upon arrival, I had the opportunity to meet my fellow crew members, totaling 20 in number. Among them were two skilled cooks, a proficient doctor adorned in a green lab coat and dark blue jeans, and a knowledgeable scientist, with the remainder consisting of capable crewmen.

While the submarine appeared relatively modest in size compared to others I had experienced, it was well-equipped for our undertaking. Donning our crisp white uniforms, we efficiently gathered all the essential equipment and food supplies before setting off on our remarkable journey into the depths of the ocean.

Adjusting to life aboard the submarine brought about some peculiarities, but I adapted swiftly. During our time on board, I took the opportunity to build camaraderie with my crewmates. Antoni, the scientist, proved to be a friendly, albeit introverted, individual with remarkable intelligence. His somewhat nerdy demeanor only added to his appeal, and I found him rather cool.

As for the cooks, Tom and Hank, they were amiable individuals, but it was evident that they didn't share a strong liking for each other. Despite their differences, they both remained skilled at their tasks. Our doctor, Jake, was a personable and enthusiastic presence, often expressing his excitement about the mission at hand. Together, we formed a diverse team, each contributing unique qualities to ensure the success of our expedition.

Indeed, I felt fortunate to have such a capable and congenial crew by my side. Most of my days were spent conversing with Peter and efficiently navigating our course toward the Mariana Trench.
Life within the confines of the submarine had a unique effect on our perception of time, with days blending together. Our only indication of the passing days was the meals prepared by our skilled cooks, Tom and Hank.

After several days of travel, we finally arrived at the designated location of the Mariana Trench. With anticipation and determination, we initiated our descent into the mysterious depths, ready to uncover the secrets concealed beneath the ocean's surface.

During our descent, an astonishing sight greeted us around 450 feet below the surface - a massive octopus. As we delved deeper to 490 feet, we entered the dark zone where merely 1% of surface light reached us. Fortunately, our submarine was equipped with lights and radar, aiding us in navigation through the darkness.

At the depth of 1,600 feet, I was taken aback by the presence of a whale, a rare occurrence at such depths. The sight was awe-inspiring as whales typically do not venture this far down. By the time we reached 2,866 feet, we found ourselves enveloped in complete darkness, beyond the reach of sunlight. Antoni, the curious scientist, remained fascinated by the diverse array of creatures we encountered.

Finally, at the remarkable depth of 19,700 feet, we officially entered the Mariana Trench, embarking on an extraordinary journey into one of the most profound and mysterious places on Earth.
Entering the Mariana Trench filled everyone with excitement and anticipation.

 The submarine's system allocated six hours for work, six hours of free time, and six hours for rest. It was my turn to retire for sleep, while Peter took over my responsibilities. As I lay down for a much-needed rest, the only memory I have is drifting into a peaceful and pleasant nap, fully trusting my capable friend to handle our mission's responsibilities.

Startled by the crew's screams, I hastily awoke to find the submarine engulfed in darkness. My immediate concern led me to rush to the engine room, where I swiftly activated the backup systems to restore power. Inquiring about the situation from Peter, he recounted that everything was proceeding smoothly until an eerie shriek echoed through the vessel, causing the sudden power outage. The mysterious turn of events left us both bewildered and deeply concerned, unsure of what could have caused such a disturbance in the depths of the Mariana Trench.

Despite the tempting thought of surfacing to address the power issue, I resolved to continue our descent. Focused on finding a solution, I meticulously studied the blueprints of the engine room and electrical systems. The complexity of the layout posed a challenge, but after some time, I deduced that reactivating the main electrical system and powering the engine was the key to resolving the problem.

With determination and careful consideration, I set to work, navigating the intricate wiring and connections until I found the necessary switches and controls. It required a considerable effort, but eventually, I successfully managed to restore power to the engine, alleviating the immediate concern and allowing us to continue our crucial mission into the depths of the Mariana Trench.

The incident with the power outage had significantly affected the atmosphere on the submarine, leaving everyone feeling disturbed. In an effort to uplift the crew's spirits, I suggested playing board games, which initially succeeded in lightening the mood. However, things took a different turn when our cooks, Tom and Hank, engaged in a heated dispute over alleged cheating during a game of chess, resorting to a physical altercation.

We managed to intervene and separate them, but the incident put an end to the board game activity. Frustrated by their recurrent conflicts, I expressed my concern to Peter, acknowledging that this was the fourth time in two weeks they had resorted to such behavior. Peter, in response, expressed doubt that anything could change their behavior, as they had a long-standing history of arguments.

Despite the challenge of resolving the underlying tensions, I remained determined to find a way to foster a more harmonious environment onboard the submarine, ensuring that such incidents did not jeopardize our mission in the Mariana Trench.

As we continued our descent into the abyss, Peter and I kept our senses heightened, listening intently for any signs of the eerie shriek that had disrupted our journey earlier. The thought of encountering whatever could produce such a disturbing sound filled us with trepidation. Inside the confines of the submarine, we were acutely aware of our vulnerability, surrounded by the vast and mysterious ocean, shielded only by the metal walls of our vessel.

The realization of being at the mercy of the ocean's depths, with unseen creatures lurking in the darkness, added to the sense of fear and uncertainty. Nevertheless, our determination to uncover the secrets of the Mariana Trench and our trust in the submarine's protective capabilities pushed us onward, braving the unknown with a mix of excitement and apprehension.

The frustration was mounting as our submarine's slow travel speed prevented us from reaching the trench's bottom as swiftly as expected. Days seemed to stretch endlessly with no sign of progress. Despite our efforts, the source of the mysterious signals remained elusive, and our expedition faced challenges on multiple fronts.

A glance at the data confirmed our suspicion – we should have already reached the bottom by now, yet something was clearly amiss. To compound matters, our food supplies were depleting rapidly, leaving us with no choice but to rely on nonperishable canned food, which only added to the sense of urgency and concern.

The situation demanded quick thinking and perseverance as we continued our quest to unveil the secrets concealed in the depths of the Mariana Trench, all the while grappling with unforeseen obstacles that tested our resolve and resourcefulness.


 As the crew's doubts started to surface, I did my best to reassure them that we were on track to reach the bottom of the trench. However, the mounting concerns were not easy to dispel. My attempts to contact the navy for assistance proved futile, with nothing but static on the radio.

Yet, tonight, a glimmer of hope emerged when we managed to pick up a signal. However, the voice on the other end sounded peculiar, unlike any human voice we had encountered before. Despite the clarity of the signal, there was an eerie and unsettling quality to it. Peter and I exchanged concerned glances as we listened intently to the signal, which persisted for an unsettling ten minutes before abruptly ending.

The mysterious signal only deepened the sense of unease among the crew, leaving us with more questions than answers. As we pressed onward into the darkness of the trench, uncertainty hung heavily in the air, and we couldn't help but wonder what secrets the Mariana Trench held and what we might encounter next on our enigmatic journey.

As we continued our descent into the Mariana Trench, a concerning reality unfolded before us. The once-teeming underwater ecosystem appeared devoid of life – no fish, no crabs, not even the tiniest bacteria. Instead, an alarming sight greeted us – a vast accumulation of plastic trash, a disheartening testament to humanity's impact on the ocean.

Amidst this disturbing scene, the enigmatic signals grew more frequent, leading me to suspect that these were indeed the same mysterious signals the navy had reported. The connection between the signals and the absence of marine life weighed heavily on my mind, raising more questions about the situation we found ourselves in.

Navigating this eerie and unsettling environment, we grappled with the realization of how human actions had left an indelible mark even in the most remote and inaccessible parts of the ocean. The journey into the Mariana Trench had transformed into an unsettling exploration, unveiling the consequences of our actions and deepening our resolve to seek answers and understanding in this enigmatic abyss.

The mounting pressure from the crew to turn back and return to the surface was becoming increasingly difficult to manage. Even Antoni, who had been a staunch supporter, now aligned with the crew's sentiments. As we descended further into the depths, the ocean's expanse was tainted by an alarming proliferation of trash, baffling me as to how such an immense amount of waste could have accumulated in this remote and unfathomable place.

The crew's growing restlessness and the disheartening sight of the trash-filled waters weighed heavily on my shoulders, as I grappled with the responsibility of leading the expedition. The delicate balance between pursuing our mission and addressing the concerns of the crew was a daunting challenge, and I feared that maintaining their trust and cooperation might prove increasingly difficult.

As we continued our descent, my mind raced with questions about the consequences of human actions on our planet and the urgency of confronting the environmental issues that had now become evident even in the deepest reaches of the Mariana Trench.

The eerie and unsettling events of yesterday left us on edge and filled with trepidation. A mysterious knocking sound on the hatch began, initially dismissed as imagination, but soon grew louder and more persistent. The entire crew heard it, and a sense of panic spread among us, prompting everyone to keep their voices down, not wanting to disturb those who were sleeping.

In a state of fear and curiosity, I mustered the courage to turn on the radar, revealing a series of dots outside the submarine. The dots multiplied rapidly, signifying an alarming number of unknown entities surrounding us. The situation escalated, and the knocking seemed to be coming from all directions, as if something or someone was attempting to breach the submarine's walls.
As the tension escalated, we endured an hour of relentless knocking before it finally ceased. In a terrifying twist, a louder shriek echoed through the vessel, further unsettling us. 

Although we managed to retain power this time, the incident left us grappling with the unknown and questioning what sinister force or creatures lurked outside our metal sanctuary in the uncharted depths of the Mariana Trench.

With anticipation and a sense of urgency, I focused on my calculations, estimating that we would reach the location of the mysterious noise in approximately an hour. The anticipation weighed heavily on my mind as we approached this enigmatic source.

To enhance our perception and visibility, I activated both the radar and the external lights, revealing the hidden expanse beyond the submarine's metal walls. The previously uncharted territory now lay before us, offering a glimpse into the unknown depths where the source of the eerie sounds might reside.

The crew remained on edge, and a palpable tension filled the submarine as we approached the area of interest. Uncertainty loomed large, but the determination to uncover the truth and confront whatever was responsible for the peculiar occurrences compelled us to proceed further into the haunting depths of the Mariana Trench.

The surreal encounter with the colossal, enigmatic creature left me utterly mesmerized and drawn to it. Its immense, white eyes seemed to penetrate my very soul, and I found myself inexplicably compelled to approach it. The creature's appearance was awe-inspiring – a massive snake-like being adorned with dark markings and imposing black horns that adorned its head.
As it communicated in an ancient language, I struggled to comprehend its words, yet a strange force seemed to pull me closer. My hands instinctively steered the submarine towards it, fully entranced by its presence. However, Antoni intervened, capturing images of the creature and persuading me to depart swiftly while we had the chance.

Grateful for Antoni's intervention, we made a hasty retreat, and to our astonishment, the creature showed no sign of pursuing us, simply observing as we departed. The encounter left me shaken and in awe, unsure of what I had witnessed. It was a surreal and breathtaking experience, but also one that carried an aura of danger and uncertainty, making me thankful for Antoni's presence and guidance in steering us away from any further encounters with the mysterious creature.

The decision to end the mission and head back to the surface was swiftly met with unexpected repercussions. The creature's deafening roar rendered us powerless, causing the engine to malfunction and sending us hurtling downward uncontrollably until we reached the trench's bottom.

Panic spread among the crew, but I urged them to stay composed and assess our situation. To my horror, I realized that I was the only one who could hear the creature's speech, as its haunting words seemed to resonate directly within my mind. The eerie connection heightened my sense of fear and vulnerability, aware that this enigmatic being held a power over me that I couldn't fathom.

We spent the following 10 days at the bottom, attempting to repair the damaged engines. However, the extent of the damage turned out to be more severe than initially anticipated, prolonging our time stranded in the trench. The crew's anxiety and tension mounted as we grappled with the reality of our situation – trapped deep in the abyss, at the mercy of the creature's presence, and with limited means to escape its domain.

As the days wore on, our food supplies became increasingly scarce, adding an additional burden to our already tense situation. Jake, our ship's doctor, had grown noticeably withdrawn, confining himself to what used to be the infirmary, now his makeshift room. Concerned for his well-being, Peter mentioned that he hadn't seen Jake emerge from his seclusion for the past two days.

In a heartfelt attempt to uplift his spirits, I ventured into the infirmary, carrying a parcel of his favorite candy, hoping to bring a moment of solace amidst our challenging circumstances. However, what awaited me inside was a heart-wrenching scene – Jake had tragically taken his own life. His suicide note spoke of the creature, implicating it in this harrowing decision.

Mindful of the crew's emotions, I shared the devastating news of Jake's passing but chose to withhold the specific contents of the note, opting to protect his memory and avoid exacerbating the already fragile atmosphere aboard the submarine. With heavy hearts, we handled his body with utmost respect, fully aware that time was of the essence before the effects of decomposition would set in.

Amidst the sorrow and uncertainty, we were left to grapple with the profound impact of our circumstances, mourning the loss of a dear comrade while navigating the uncharted depths of the Mariana Trench.

Amidst the eerie silence of the submarine, the absence of shrieks and strange signals offered a semblance of relief, but a new disturbing situation had emerged. Hank approached me, revealing Tom's disturbing actions of building a shrine to the creature in his cabin and leading a cult-like group of crewmen in daily prayers. Initially, I underestimated the gravity of the situation, but it had escalated rapidly, with nearly half of the crew now under Tom's sway.

Feeling the weight of responsibility as the captain, I decided to confront Tom and put an end to his dangerous cult. Accompanied by Peter, we approached his cabin, the haunting chants emanating from within. Upon opening the door, we were met with a shocking sight - Tom and the crewmen gathered around a shrine adorned with Jake's head.

Their trance-like expressions sent chills down my spine, and I demanded an explanation. Tom spoke calmly, claiming that their actions were part of a divine plan, requiring sacrifices for the supposed "God" they worshiped. The mention of Jake's involvement added to the sense of horror and disbelief.

I attempted to reason with Tom, denouncing his beliefs, but it was clear that he had an iron grip on the crew under his influence. Knowing that I couldn't confront him directly at this moment, I left, determined to address the situation when we returned to the surface.

The reality of Tom's growing influence was a grave concern, leaving me uncertain of what would unfold as we journeyed further into the Mariana Trench. The eerie encounters with the creature and the disintegration of crew unity painted a sinister picture of the deep ocean's mysteries and the precariousness of our expedition's future.

As we regrouped in the command room, tension hung heavily in the air. Peter and I took our seats, knowing that time was of the essence as we went over our plan. The situation demanded vigilance, and we armed ourselves with iron bars and whatever knives were left after Tom's followers took some.

The urgent need for sustenance loomed over us like a dark cloud. The diminishing food and water supplies necessitated constant runs to the submarine's storage area, where we could salvage what little was left. Each day brought a harsh reminder of the challenges we faced, and we had to make every resource count.

In the midst of these trying circumstances, our solidarity as a united team was crucial. We relied on each other's support, determination, and strength to navigate the depths of the Mariana Trench. As we prepared ourselves for the uncertain journey ahead, we remained hopeful that our resilience and teamwork would ultimately lead us to safety and allow us to confront the mysteries that lay within the fathomless abyss.

The situation had escalated to a harrowing climax when we received a letter from one of Tom's devoted cultists, promoting a "Big festival" as part of the supposed creator's plan. I dismissed it as another absurd ritual and decided to burn the letter. However, my suspicion heightened when I witnessed them gathering near the submarine's hatch, and Tom's fanatical speech convinced me that their intentions posed a deadly threat to all of us.

With no choice but to act swiftly, I ordered the crew to arm themselves and prepare for a confrontation. The gravity of the situation left us with no alternative – we had to fight for our survival against those who sought to endanger us all.

As we charged into the group, they were taken off guard, unarmed and unable to resist. In the intense struggle that followed, we were forced to defend ourselves, resulting in a devastating scene of bloodshed. The hallway now bore witness to the horrors we had endured, the weight of the sacrifice we had made to ensure our survival.

While the events were horrifying, we knew that we had no other option but to defend ourselves against the perilous cult. With the submarine finally under our control, we had a chance to repair the engines and chart a course back to the surface, putting an end to this nightmarish ordeal in the depths of the Mariana Trench.

The jubilation of hearing from the Navy was swiftly crushed as I returned to the crew, only to find them lifeless on the floor. 

Shock and sorrow overwhelmed me as I attempted to aid Antoni, the only one still clinging to life. His fear-stricken expression and inability to speak coherently left me in distress, and he passed away before I could offer any help.

Amidst the tragic scene, the absence of Peter heightened my concern. A sense of foreboding led me to the hatch, where I discovered him, wearing a chilling smile. My suspicion compelled me to question him about the crew's fate, and he coldly asserted that they were merely wasting our time.
The gravity of the situation weighed heavily upon me as I grappled with the inexplicable events. What had befallen the crew? Why was Peter spared? 

The unanswered questions gnawed at me, and an unsettling feeling crept in, deepening my unease about the true nature of our predicament.
As we stood face-to-face, I felt an overwhelming sense of dread, unsure of what lay ahead. The unknown threats lurking in the darkened waters heightened my vigilance, and I knew that I had to confront Peter about the unsettling turn of events. But before I could do so, the hatch trembled, and a sense of impending danger loomed, adding to the haunting mysteries that awaited us in the depths of the Mariana Trench.

The confrontation with Peter grew more intense as I vehemently accused him of being responsible for the crew's deaths. However, he retorted with an unsettling claim that I was the one who poisoned them. The shock and disbelief washed over me as I vehemently denied any involvement, knowing in my heart that I could never harm my friends.

His amusement at my distress added to the disturbing aura surrounding him. His words took a dark turn as he revealed an unsettling truth – the day I had accidentally killed him in the past, his soul became one with the ocean, and he had gained insights beyond human comprehension. According to him, humans were not meant to inhabit land, but were once exiled from the ocean due to our transgressions.

His narrative shook me to the core, but I couldn't fully grasp the implications of his words. The idea of a vengeful creator and our past sins haunting us felt surreal and unnerving. A deep sense of foreboding settled in as I tried to make sense of the enigmatic forces at play.

With the unsettling revelations and the ominous presence growing ever stronger, I knew that our journey in the Mariana Trench had transcended the realms of the known, delving into a realm of mystery and peril unlike anything I could have imagined. As I stood face-to-face with Peter, the gravity of our circumstances weighed heavily upon me, and I wondered what dark secrets the abyss held.

The weight of Peter's words hung heavily in the air, and the enormity of the situation was difficult to fathom. According to his eerie account, the creator once intended to restore humanity to the ocean when we had atoned for our sins. However, our mistreatment of the ocean through pollution and waste had altered the creator's plan. Now, a horrifying and apocalyptic scheme loomed ahead – the submersion of all land on Earth and the annihilation of humankind.

Peter's offer to join the creator and return to the ocean felt like an eerie temptation, but deep within, I knew that aligning myself with such a malevolent force was not the path to salvation. The very idea of turning against my own kind felt unfathomable, and the consequences of such a decision weighed heavily on my conscience.

As the darkness outside the submarine continued to encroach, I felt a sense of urgency and the responsibility of leadership upon me. I had to protect what remained of humanity and find a way to prevent this cataclysmic fate from becoming a reality.

Facing the unfathomable reality of a vengeful creator, the stakes were higher than ever before. I had to navigate through this treacherous labyrinth of enigmas and malevolent forces, seeking answers and a means to halt the impending destruction of our world. The final confrontation loomed, and the choices made in this desperate hour would determine the fate of not only myself but of all humanity.

As the gravity of the situation escalated, my thoughts turned to Tom and his devoted followers, who had embraced the dark allure of the creator. I questioned why the creator, if all-powerful, would allow us to thwart their devotion and end their lives. Peter's response was chilling – he claimed that Tom and his followers were not deemed worthy of joining the creator's cause, despite their claims. It appeared that the creator was selective in his choices, seeking only those who met certain criteria.

As we grappled with the implications of his revelation, the radar in the command room suddenly came alive with frenzied activity. A massive presence was approaching, accompanied by a legion of other beings, unknown and unsettling in nature.

Curiosity mixed with dread filled me, and I questioned Peter about the identity and purpose of these enigmatic beings. His description sent chills down my spine – beings akin to humans, but seemingly superior and perfect, unburdened by the mistakes that plague our kind.

As the weight of Peter's words pressed upon me, I pleaded with him, hoping to find a way to spare humanity from the impending doom. Perhaps, if I could convey the gravity of our actions to the rest of humankind, they might change their ways and deserve a chance at redemption. But Peter's response was disheartening – humanity was well aware of its destructive behavior, yet continued to ignore the consequences. Another chance seemed out of reach.

With the fate of humanity hanging in the balance, Peter demanded that I make a choice – join him and the creator or face a grim demise. Though the options were agonizingly limited, I couldn't bring myself to abandon my own kind, even in the face of overwhelming odds. I harbored a glimmer of hope that there might be another way to save humanity from its self-inflicted doom.

In a moment of desperation and fear, I uttered an apology to Peter, acknowledging my role in his past demise, even though it was unintentional. He seemed to accept my words, offering forgiveness as he beckoned me to join his malevolent cause. Yet, I knew that aligning with him would lead to more destruction and suffering for others.

Summoning every ounce of courage left within me, I made a bold and heart-wrenching decision. Instead of acquiescing to his offer, I seized the moment and stabbed him in the neck with my knife. His lifeless body fell into my arms, and I grappled with the reality of having taken another life.

As I closed my eyes for a brief moment, I found myself contemplating the magnitude of my actions. The creature, Peter, and the perfect beings were gone from the radar, leaving a void of uncertainty in their wake. I knew I had to act swiftly, using whatever chance remained to escape the abyssal depths and return to the surface before the malevolent forces could reemerge.
I tried to start the engines, and to my relief, they turned on without a hitch.

 With a mix of determination and fear driving me, I managed to navigate the submarine back to the surface. As the cold ocean water parted to reveal the world above, a sense of both freedom and trepidation washed over me. The nightmare might have ended for now, but I knew that the horror I had witnessed beneath the waves would stay with me forever.

In the years that followed the harrowing events aboard the submarine, I tried my best to cope with the haunting memories and the uncertain reality of what transpired in those deep, dark waters. Returning to the surface brought no solace, as the navy disbelieved my account of the malevolent presence that claimed the lives of my crewmates, including my best friend, Peter, who had perished long before.

Instead of finding vindication for the truth, I found myself convicted of mass murder and sentenced to 18 years in prison. My pleas fell on deaf ears as I struggled to come to terms with what was real and what may have been mere manifestations of a tortured mind.

Time passed slowly behind bars, and I remained haunted by the unsettling news that came from the outside world. Reports of rising ocean levels and inexplicable drownings only added to my sense of dread. The island prison I found myself on seemed like an ominous symbol of the ominous forces that still lurked in the depths of.

And then, a glimmer of hope emerged in the form of General Henry, who provided me with a lawyer to help reduce my sentence. In a desperate attempt to share the truth with the world, I recounted my story to the lawyer, urging him to write it down and deliver it to General Henry. I hoped that someone in authority might believe my account and take action to protect humanity from the malevolent forces that had emerged from the depths.

As the lawyer left, I entrusted him with the task of sharing my story online, hoping that it might reach others and serve as a warning. To anyone reading this account, I urge you to heed the cautionary tale and avoid the ocean and any body of water. The malevolent beings that emerged from the abyss are now widespread, and they pose a grave threat to all who encounter them.

In the confines of my prison cell, I still hear Peter's voice calling out to me, a chilling reminder that the horror I witnessed may not be confined to the depths of the ocean alone. The truth may be elusive, but I hold on to the hope that one day, someone will understand the gravity of the danger that looms over humanity.

I write this final message as a desperate plea – be vigilant, be cautious, and stay away from the waters. For within their depths lie entities beyond our comprehension, and we must do all we can to protect ourselves from their insidious grasp.
