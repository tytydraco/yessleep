Rummaging around in the clutter of my grandparent’s attic one afternoon, I moved a heavy stack of old boxes. Behind them, I discovered a weird hidden doorway! It was locked with a heavy-duty padlock. I tried to pry the fortified enclosure open but it wasn’t about to reveal its secrets. Out of frustration, I stuck my ear to the moldy oak panel to listen. I could’ve sworn I heard something on the other side of the child-size opening! After a moment, the feeling passed and I assumed it was only my imagination playing tricks on me. 

I was curious what was stored inside the tiny locked space so I asked my Grandma about it. As soon as the words escaped my curious lips, she gasped audibly, and then scolded me for ‘snooping’ in places where I wasn’t supposed to be. I was rather startled by her severe, triggered reaction. The level of which, strongly suggested there was much more to the story. Ordinarily, Grandma was easy going and never uttered a harsh word to anyone. It was a shocking exception to her typical demeanor. Further reinforcing the mystery, she warned me it wasn’t ‘safe’ to be up in the attic because ‘reoccurring roof leaks had compromised the support joists’. 

After several unsubtle admonitions to discourage me from ever going back up there again, it was obviously a big deal, which made want to do it that much more. You know how obstinate precocious teenagers can be. As if to reinforce her unusually strict decree, the next time I tried to sneak up the forbidden steps, the staircase itself was barricaded. With all means of giving in to temptation being blocked, I had no choice at the time but to accept things as they were. 

I assumed the truth was mundane, and that it would be anticlimactic to find out what was actually behind the threshold. At least that’s what I convinced myself, but why would she go to such panicked levels, if that was the case? It made zero sense. Either way, I eventually forgot about the diminutive doorway. Years went by, and both grandparents passed away. Afterward, the house was locked up for the better part of a decade. First my Dad maintained it. Then he hired a caretaker once it became too much, in his advanced age. 

As is the way of things for everyone, both my parents grew frail and passed, very close to the same time. I was relieved and thankful that neither of them had to be without the other too long. it was a sobering experience to find myself alone. As the sole heir and inheritor of the shuttered family estate, it became my responsibility to go through it and sell or discard the unwanted contents. Property taxes and external upkeep were costing me a fortune, so I made the pragmatic decision to get ‘the museum’ ready to put on the market, for a retirement nest egg. 

I hadn’t been to the place in years. Hundreds of recollections came flooding back as I walked through it. As a kid, many happy memories were made within those walls and I was tempted to become sentimental and leave it be. Deep down though, I knew that would be counterproductive and a waste of the opportunity. It was pointless to put things off any longer. I had to rip off the bandaid and get it done. 

As if details of the secret door had been deliberately blocked by my subconscious mind until I would have unencumbered access to see it, I was reminded again of the buried memory. I actually sprinted up the steps like a police detective. While the stairs and attic floor creaked a bit, there was no sign of catastrophic damage or risk of collapse, like my grandma warned me about years earlier. To my dismay, the area was even more cluttered and junky, but I wasn’t about to be deterred. I staged the boxes down the hall corridor so I could expose the mystery door again. 

Unbelievably, once the contents were removed, I was faced with an ordinary wall to deny my efforts. There was no sign of the door! For a brief moment, I second guessed myself. Had the entire episode been some dream or vivid hallucination? False memories are a well documented phenomenon, but I didn’t want to accept that I’d invented the entire episode. I tapped on the wall in frustration. 

I even considered that maybe I was mistaken about which wall the door was on. I moved the obstacles away from the other three sides in furious determination. None of them sported the thick, child-sized door I expected to see again. Then I realized that the side I remembered having the door, was blocked by a new, false wall added later! 

I galloped down the steps, two-at-a-time, and out to my work truck. In my toolbox I had a hammer, pry-bar, and all the right equipment to tear down the deceptive facade. In about twenty minutes I had my answer. Directly in front of me was the damned oak door again! The bizarre memory; until recently buried and lost, had been officially resurrected and vindicated. Still, long after my grandparents and parents had died, I hesitated to put the hammer and chisel to the rusty padlock, to finally answer the burning question of what was on the other side.

There was no one left to stop me any longer, but I realized how important it had obviously been to her. Grandma must’ve had her reasons to go to such ridiculous lengths to hide it. In honor of respecting her memory and wishes, I weighed all the pros and cons of defying those unknown possibilities. In the end though, you know what I decided to do. It was the same as nearly anyone in my shoes would. I was terrified, but I had to know. The suspense was killing me.

The hammer struck the old padlock with a heavy metallic thud. It required three very hard blows to snap open. Again, I thought I heard something of significant size scurrying around on the other side of the barrier. My heart heaved. I removed the ruined lock from the hasp loop and tossed it aside, but then hesitated to actually turn the liberated knob, to reveal its dark secrets. My instincts warned me against going any further down the rabbit hole, but my higher logic argued how silly that was. It was my home now to do whatever I wanted. I owned the deed! Grandma’s sternly-delivered warnings all those years ago had no bearing on my decisions any longer. 

I turned the handle. Slowly I pulled it toward me. The hinges creaked in protest. Exactly as I suspected they would. The fading sunlight from the single attic window in the corner did little to illuminate inside the hidden space. I used my cell phone flashlight to peer into the darkness. There was no pile of human bones or lock boxes with treasure brimming out the top, as my teenage-self imagined. The room was completely empty! My head wanted to explode from the unbelievable, disappointing let down. Why go to that effort? I crawled partially inside to confirm what I witnessed with the focused beam of light. My body was half way in the closet-sized area, when I spotted some hastily scrawled writing on the side of one wall. 

I crept in further to read it. Once my body fully passed the threshold, the door slammed shut behind me like a deadening rifle shot. The powerful ‘thwack!’ absolutely startled me at the time, but I assumed it was merely caused from a cross-ventilation vacuum. That was, until I realized a vacuum would’ve required an opening on the other side, to suck the door closed. I had been too distracted by needing to read the mysterious writing, to focus on being safe. 

As soon as I had enough time to absorb the bitter irony of crawling fully inside to read the cryptic warning about not doing so, the damage was done. 

“Do not let the portal to the other side close completely behind you!”; It read in a frantic, hand-lettered scrawl. “You will be trapped within this chamber of death for two entire days of torment.”

I immediately reversed my body in the tight space and slithered back over to turn the knob to escape, but the snare was triggered already. The creepy message in the empty space worked unintentionally as ‘bait’ to lure me inside. 

‘Chamber of death’? My mind raced to decrypt what that might mean. The door itself was not going to budge. That much was clear. I twisted the knob and beat on the wood until my fists were bruised and bloody. I was trapped with absolutely no recourse. Whatever the secret room actually was, it did not allow any cell reception to filter through either. I had to hope the written warning was true about it ‘only’ being a two day lockup for my stupidity. No one knew I was there or would come searching for me. 

Almost immediately I felt like I was no longer trapped in a tiny crawlspace room in my grandparent’s attic. The pitch black room felt immense. I shut off my phone to conserve power. Even if I couldn’t call for help, it offered me the possibility of game entertainment and a relative source of timekeeping in the decompression-chamber like stimuli-free environment. 

Thats when everything really started flying off the rails. I saw creepy things hovering nearby in the darkness. Fascinating but sinister lights whirled around me and zipped across the so-called ‘portal’. A discoloration to the ambient fog in the air made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end. Then came the charnel stench of dozen rotting slaughterhouses. It was unbearably rank, yet I had no means of escaping it. Thats when the dead souls started arriving en-masse. 

I wasn’t condoned off or protected from their wrath, and they knew I was still alive! Fear doesn’t cover what I went through. Nothing could. Human words cannot convey the extremities of emotion you experience when you dwell in the same locked space with a procession of ‘them’. My fingertips bled from clawing the old wood and surrounding walls for a way out. I finally understood my Grandma’s unhinged reaction to my younger self discovering the exposed door. What I still didn’t get, was the appeal of having an open portal to hell in the first place. 

What could possibly entice a person to open that cursed doorway for any reason? I was terrified shitless and couldn’t imagine how it came to be there, or why my grandparents didn’t do a better job of barricading the doorway, prior to when I’d stumbled upon it. Neither of them struck me as being involved with the supernatural or the occult blackened arts. Regardless, Grandma clearly knew what it was but at the moment, it didn’t matter. I was too frightened to worry too much about the origins of the hellhole I found myself trapped inside. I had to survive the next two days first.

Once my activation triggered the dead to begin showing up, I realized opening the door summoned them to be there. None of them were ‘happy’ whatsoever about being pawns to the dark forces that controlled the portal, but there were apparently ‘rules’ they had to follow. No matter how menacing they wanted to be, killing me was thankfully ‘off limits’. There was no guide book lying around to clarify the parameters, but once I understood they couldn’t physically harm me, it took a great deal of the pressure off. 

I’m not saying it was a ‘picnic’ by any stretch of the imagination, but you can even become desensitized to the malevolent mental torture of having untold festering corpses threaten to eat you alive, after a while. I just had to constantly remind myself if they could do any of those nightmarish deeds, they would have done them immediately. It was about the sadism of lingering fear which they craved. 

Soon, it occurred to me why the brave would subject themselves to 48 hours lounging in ‘Hell’s rest stop’. It was because the dead had answers to the mysteries of life and know the future. The tricky part is how to obtain these facts. They wouldn’t simply submit to a ‘question and answer’ session. I had to get very, very clever. As with the unspoken rule about them not being able harm living participants, I assumed they were also required to be fully truthful if the statements made were phrased perfectly, as in a professional debate. They were so fixated on tormenting me, they didn’t realize I was using them to obtain useful knowledge and information! Under those controlled conditions, I decided they had to be honest and forthright.

I can’t say there wasn’t collateral damage in this underhanded ‘quid pro quo’ of mine. They could literally see ‘the writing on the wall’ and knew it was my very first time trapped in the underworld. Dozens of them teased me that they had written the warning message on the wall, but it was just deceitful propaganda. According to them, I was permanently trapped in hell with them! I had no proof the two-day release decree was accurate. I’m not going to lie. Crippling doubt crept into my mind and took up residence. The ‘what ifs?’ were a powerful tool they employed to frighten me, as I kept hearing it over and over in their relentless taunting.

Finally I was able to overcome the psychological setback after I pointed out that if what they claimed was true, there’d be no reason to scare me about it. I’d live the devastating truth in just 36 more hours. The ferocious gnashing of teeth I witnessed after exposing that lie created a powerful euphoria in me. I’d guess it rivaled a potent narcotic high. They were so furious I applied logic against them; even during the repeated volleys aimed at eroding my hope, that I took immense pleasure in tormenting them right back. 

Thus I realized why my grandparents caved to the masochistic temptation to put themselves through the ordeal. It really was incredibly addictive to fight them and glean their secrets about the future of humanity. During my excursion, I experienced horrific personal doubt, unrelenting fear, extreme exhaustion, and numerous urges to do things I won’t mention here; but I also felt an unparalleled electrifying joy. Honestly, I’ve never felt more alive in my whole life. The experience is that powerful. 

I admit these things because it’s of the utmost importance to recognize the unseen effects it had on my battered psyche. It would also behoove me to accept that the irreparable psychological damage and stress I received is probably cumulative in nature, after too many ‘trips’ to ‘the other side’. How many excursions can a grounded person like me endure for the invaluable rewards, without it destroying them? I honestly do not know. 

There is the 10 million dollar question. You see, the amazing insider-stock-market tips I’ve dragged out of the taunting ghouls paid off handsomely a few days ago, and I’m pretty sure only a few more times will leave me financially set for the rest of my days! I’m taking a big doorstop next time so I can escape the portal early if I feel myself fading too fast or the dead getting the better of me. Wish me luck.
