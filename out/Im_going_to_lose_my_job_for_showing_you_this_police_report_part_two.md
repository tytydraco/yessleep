Case File: #2023-109  
Date: September 25, 2023  
  
This report documents a significant development in our ongoing investigation into \[REDACTED\] in rural areas, previously believed to be unrelated. A recent \[REDACTED\] these cases. Ms. Varn was found in a severely weakened state and is currently receiving medical care.  
  
Part Two of Samantha Varn’s written account of the events:  
  
When my eyes fluttered open once more, the room remained dimly lit, but a heavy shroud of sickness had settled upon me, blurring the edges of my awareness. New and unsettling symptoms had joined the fray, deepening my concern. A cold sweat bathed my clammy skin, and my limbs felt leaden, as if weighed down by invisible chains. Each breath came with an effort, the air thick and oppressive.  
  
I turned my gaze to the bedside table and noticed an arrangement of items, including note in Michael’s handwriting explaining that the glass of water and pills were meant to alleviate my fever and nausea. It was then that I realized Michael’s side of the bed was vacant.  
  
But I didn’t have time to figure out where he’d gone. This sickness was tightening its grip on me, and I was running out of time. I couldn't remain passive any longer. If I was being poisoned, I needed to get medical attention, and soon.  
  
Contemplating my limited options, I weighed the risks of attempting an escape. The mansion was located in a secluded area, and I couldn't be certain how far I could get on foot in my current state. The thought of fleeing into the unknown without a clear destination filled me with dread. But perhaps I could find Michael’s keys in here somewhere?  
  
As I began to rise from the bed, my eyes caught something peculiar in the dimly lit room. There was a subtle glint of red, the same glint I had dismissed the other night as a trick of the eyes. In the darkness, I couldn’t figure out what exactly it was coming from, but a sense of foreboding crept over me.  
  
My footfalls were hushed as I cautiously approached the far corner of the room. There, the elusive red glint finally resolved into focus, leaving me initially bewildered. Before me, the only discernible object was a well-loved stuffed bear, innocently seated in its customary corner. Why would a stuffed toy emit such an eerie red light?  
  
From the depths of my foggy mind, a distant memory surfaced—a voice, my mother's voice, "Sam, be cautious when you stay at places you're not familiar with. I read a horrifying story about Airbnb owners secretly putting hidden cameras in their rentals. They hide them in things like smoke detectors and alarm clocks…”  
  
I stared at the bear, and it was then that I realized that the bear was staring back. And someone, whether it was Eleanor, Victor, or even Michael, was watching.  
  
Panic surged within me as I contemplated my next move. I was certain that my expression had given away my realization, so I needed to come up with a plan, and quickly.  
  
In a swift, deliberate motion, I decided to knock over the bear before moving to the center of the room. My footsteps were loud and deliberate, making it sound like I was heading for the exit. This could my best chance to fool whoever was watching into thinking I had left the room.  
  
Then, as silently as I could, I maneuvered my body under the bed and hid there, trying to steady my rapid breaths. The seconds ticked by like hours as I strained my ears to catch any sign of movement or conversation outside the room.  
  
It wasn't long before I heard hushed voices coming from another hallway in the direction of the bathroom. My heart pounded even harder as I listened – Eleanor and Victor were searching for me.  
  
“We can’t let her escape.” Victor hissed, his voice laden with urgency.  
  
Eleanor agreed, and I listened as the two of them conferred in hushed tones. With each passing moment, their voices grew fainter as they moved farther down the corridor. This was my chance. I couldn't stay hidden under the bed forever, and I needed to learn more about what was happening in this mansion.  
  
I eased myself out from under the bed and silently made my way to the door. I still had no idea where Michael was, but I couldn’t just stay here, so I’d have to take the risk that I might run into him as I moved throughout the mansion.  
  
The hall outside was lit only by moonlight, and I could hear the faint echoes of footsteps in the distance. It seemed Eleanor and Victor gone downstairs, likely thinking I was heading for the front door, so for now, I was relatively safe on the upper floor.  
  
Still, the urgency of my situation pressed upon me, like a vice around my chest. If they were closing in on the exits downstairs, any attempt to leave would prove futile. Escaping was out of the question, but with every passing moment, my need for medical attention grew more urgent.  
  
My only hope rested in finding information about an antidote, something, anything that could save me from the poison coursing through my veins. I stood there in the suffocating darkness, contemplating my limited options as panic began to bubble within me.  
  
Michael, Eleanor, and Victor were deeply connected to this place, their secrets hidden within its walls. I needed to think like them, to consider where they might have concealed information about the antidote.  
  
As I mulled over our shared experiences in this nightmarish mansion, one place stood out in my mind: the room with the suspicious open door. It had seemed significant to Michael, that much was clear. There must be a reason why he didn't want me to see it.  
  
With a sinking feeling, I realized that if this room held the answers I needed, it might also be locked. I needed to find the key – the key to my possible salvation.  
  
But where would I start looking? The upstairs was vast and labyrinthine; it could be anywhere.  
  
Worried I'd been standing in one place for too long, I continued to move forward, my steps muffled by the plush carpet. While walking, my mind wandered back to the night I had first noticed the red light in the corner of my room, and the eerie figure I had glimpsed in the hallway. At the time, I had dismissed it as a trick of my imagination, but now, with the weight of suspicion on my shoulders, I considered another possibility.  
  
What if someone had been watching me that night? If they were so concerned about me leaving the mansion, perhaps… perhaps it was Victor who I’d seen, making sure I didn’t do anything I wasn’t supposed to. After all, Michael had been in bed with me, and the figure had been far to tall to be Eleanor.  
  
I froze in place, anxiety coursing through me as I wiped the sweat from my forehead with trembling hands. If my suspicion held any truth, Eleanor and Victor's bedroom might be located down that very corridor. Perhaps they had the key?  
  
It was worth a shot.  
  
Returning to the corridor, I proceeded methodically, checking each door with the utmost care, determined to remain as silent as possible. But it didn't take long before the distant sound of approaching footsteps reached my ears, injecting a renewed sense of urgency into my quest.  
  
I fumbled with sweaty hands, jiggling one doorknob after another, my desperation mounting. Each failed attempt added to the torment of impending discovery. The footsteps were nearly upon me, their rhythm growing ever more menacing.  
  
With a final, desperate push, I tried one last door, and it gave way with a soft creak. I slipped inside the room, my heart in my throat, and closed the door as gently as I could. My heart raced, and my breath came in shallow, frantic gasps as I moved deeper into the room.  
  
Beyond the door, the footsteps grew closer with the sound of impending danger. My eyes darted around the room, my blurry vision making it even more difficult to see the outlines of furniture and objects in the darkness. But I needed to hide.  
  
I reached a hand into the darkness, trying to feel my way into the room to find something I could tuck myself behind. My fingers brushed against a cold, hard surface, and I realized I had found the edge of a heavy, wooden wardrobe. With cautious movements, I eased myself behind it, crouching low to the ground.  
  
The footsteps paused just in front of the door, and my heart felt like it might leap out of my chest. I pressed my back against the wall as the doorknob finally turned.  
  
A sliver of moonlight from the corridor spilled into the room, casting eerie shadows on the floor as the door creaked open slowly. I listened, frozen in terror, as the figure on the other side of the door stepped into the room. And then, with a sharp click, the room's light was switched on.  
  
The room's light burst forth, and for a brief moment, I was blinded by its sudden intensity. From what I could see, it turned out I’d managed to find Victor and Eleanor’s bedroom, but it was too late. I was certain I would be found, that my heart would betray my presence with its deafening thuds.  
  
But then, just as quickly as the light came on, it was gone again, and whoever had entered the room shut the door behind them. Waiting for the footsteps to disappear, I remained crouched behind the heavy wooden wardrobe.  
  
My eyes darted around the room, strained and blurry, as I wondered where to look for the key I needed. Perhaps a dresser or a desk held the key? Silently and unsteadily, I rose to my feet and began to explore.  
  
I decided to start with a large wooden dresser on the far side of the room. It loomed like a monolith in the darkness. My fingers fumbled in the obscurity as I cautiously pulled open the dresser drawers one by one, searching for anything that might resemble a key.  
  
The drawers yielded a trove of clothing, neatly folded and organized, but no key. I felt a growing sense of frustration and anxiety as I realized that time was slipping away, and I was growing weaker by the minute, a sensation of pins and needles now spreading from my fingertips to my toes.  
  
I couldn't help but wonder about the nature of the drug they had administered to me. What purpose did it serve? If they wanted me dead, why hadn’t they done it while I was sleeping?  
  
For a moment, I considered surrendering to the numbness and fatigue that threatened to overtake me, but then, just when hope seemed to be slipping away, my fingers brushed against a cold, metallic surface buried beneath a stack of letters on the small writing desk. I grasped it and pulled it free, my heart pounding with anticipation. It was a key, its edges worn and tarnished, but it held the promise of answers.  
  
Now came the most daunting part of my plan—making my way through the maze of hallways and finding my way back to where I had seen the open door. Even in the daylight, it had been a bewildering route, but in my current state, it felt like a near-impossible task.  
  
But what choice did I have? I couldn’t stay in here forever. For all I knew, I could be dead in the next hour if I didn’t figure out what they'd given me.  
  
With the key clutched tightly in my hand, I ventured out of Victor and Eleanor's bedroom and into the dimly lit corridor. Every step was a struggle, every corner an obstacle to be overcome. The mansion seemed to conspire against me, its layout designed to confound and disorient. My vision continued to betray me, and the numbness in my limbs only grew more pronounced.  
  
I was somewhere deep within the maze of hallways when I heard footsteps again. My heart raced as I strained to listen. There were two distinct sets approaching this time, and panic surged within me as I realized that every door in this hallway was locked, leaving me with no place to hide. I had no choice but to turn back.  
  
I’d done my best to etch every corner and turn into my memory. Left at the end of this hall, then another left. Through the third door, and turn right. I walked briskly, my senses on high alert.  
  
But as I reached what should have been the next move, dread settled in. Something wasn't right. There was supposed to be a door there, an unlocked door leading back to the bedroom.  
  
My heart pounded louder as the voices of Michael and Eleanor grew louder too, drawing nearer with each passing second. I was trapped at a dead end, and there was nowhere to hide.  
  
I pressed my body up against the wall, flattening myself into the wallpaper as though I could merge with the shadows. My mind raced, searching for any last-minute solution, but the darkness offered no solace.  
  
My heart felt like it might explode as their figures came into view. Michael and Eleanor walked side by side, their voices hushed as they continued their conversation.  
  
Michael's voice carried a tone of solemnity. "…We mustn't underestimate the significance...  
  
Eleanor hummed in agreement. “It’s been passed down through generations, and now it falls to us to carry it out."  
  
Their voices faded as they turned in the opposite direction, and I released a breath I didn't realize I had been holding. I wasn’t sure if I could take another close call like that, so I had to move quickly.  
  
Once the sound of footsteps receded, I pushed through the darkness. At this point, with no energy to spare, I didn't bother keeping track of directions. But I could tell, after passing through numerous dark rooms and corridors, that I was getting close when the wallpaper changed. The familiar pattern I had seen before came into view, and my heart leaped with hope.  
  
But it didn't last long.  
  
“Samantha, where are you?” Michael’s voiced reverberated off the walls, bouncing at me from every direction.  
  
I spun around, panic gripping me like a vice. I couldn't tell where his voice was coming from, or how far away he was. It was as if the very walls were taunting me, distorting sound and space.  
  
"Come on out Samantha!” he called again, the desperation in his voice cutting through the darkness.  
  
I swallowed the lump forming in my throat, my body trembling from fear and exhaustion. The poisoned haze in my mind was becoming more pronounced, and I could taste the metallic tang of blood in my mouth.  
  
Holding back sobs, I pushed forward as Michael's voice continued to echo through the corridor, now mixing with Eleanor and Victor’s shouts and taunts.  
  
“There’s no way out, Samantha…”  
  
“Why don’t you make all our lives easier and just tell us where you are?”  
  
With the key still clutched tightly in my hand, I stumbled through an open set of double doors into a large room, the world spinning around me. My legs gave way, and I collapsed to the floor, gasping for breath. My vision swirled with darkness and disorientation.  
  
I laid there for what could have been one moment or thirty, time a muddled blur in my addled mind. The room around me seemed both familiar and strange, its details dancing in and out of focus. Shadows played tricks on my exhausted senses, and I fought to regain control over my trembling limbs.  
  
But this room… there was something so familiar about this room… Through the haze of my delirium, I managed to lift my head and focus on the outline of potted plant sitting quietly in the corner. Recognition flooded my foggy mind, and I knew in an instant that this was the room with the door I'd glimpsed before.  
  
I’d found it. I’d found it. Just one more push and I’d be inside.  
  
I began to crawl across the floor, digging my nails into the carpet, the teeth of the key pressing into my palm. Each movement felt like an agonizing effort, and I could no longer remain silent amidst my suffering. I groaned between ragged breaths and licked salty tears from my lips.  
  
But I was so close now. Just a couple more feet. Gritting my teeth against the pain and exhaustion, I ignored the fact that Michael’s voice was growing louder. I ignored him telling me he knew where I was and that he was coming for me.  
  
Pushing myself onto my knees, I fumbled with the key, my shaking fingers struggling to find the right position. Michael's voice grew nearer, echoing in the corridor, and I could hear the faint click of a flashlight being turned on.  
  
With every second that passed, my desperation increased, my breaths coming in short, frantic gasps. The key refused to cooperate, slipping from my grasp as I fought to steady my hand.  
  
Michael finally reached the room, his flashlight falling upon me as a a vicious shout left his lips. But then I managed to find the right angle. The lock turned with a satisfying click and I reached up for the doorknob. He must have lunged forward, because I felt his fingers brush against my shoulder, a desperate attempt to grab hold of me.  
  
But it was too late. Adrenaline coursed through my veins, and I flung myself through the open doorway with all the strength I could muster. The lock clicked into place just in the nick of time, and I leaned against the door, gasping for breath.  
  
All around me, dust hung in the air like a shroud, and old furniture was draped in heavy, moth-eaten cloths. Cobwebs adorned the corners, weaving a tapestry of neglect. I scanned the faded posters of women plastered on the far wall. They were a bizarre collage, a montage of women, all of them young and beautiful.  
  
But I recognized some of them.  
  
These weren't just posters of random women; they were missing persons posters. These were women whose disappearances had made headlines, their stories filled with despair and unanswered questions.  
  
As the chilling realization settled over me, Michael's desperate fists hammered against the old wooden door. With every thud, I clutched the key even tighter, my knuckles turning white from the tension.  
  
I turned to face the door, watching as it rattled on its hinges with each furious blow; it protested with eerie, mournful creaks between his cries of fury and desperation. But the door held steadfast, its ancient lock offering me a sliver of sanctuary. As I stared and my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I could finally make out a carving above the door, made with crude yet deliberate strokes into the wood – a Roman numeral, 73.  
  
A memory stirred within me, like a faint echo from the past, a glimpse of clarity amidst the chaos.  
  
Eleanor's laughter, that hint of nostalgia in her voice. "I couldn’t bear to change it," she had said about her bedroom.  
  
“That’s very sweet.” I had smiled then, amused by the quaintness of it all, unaware of the sinister truth lurking beneath the surface.  
  
But now, in this moment of desperation, I remembered their words. Michael and Victor reminiscing about "73," about an old rope ladder. It was more than a mere memory; it was a clue, a way out.  
  
I began to search the room. My eyes scanned the corners, the walls, and every inch of the floor for any sign, any hint of that ladder Victor had mentioned.  
  
Outside, the pounding on the door continued, growing more frenzied by the second. By now I could tell that more fists had joined the fight, their combined efforts shaking the ancient door in its frame.  
  
Amidst the chaos, I heard Victor's voice, a calm and deliberate contrast. "It’s no use – we need to pick the lock.”  
  
My heart skipped a beat as the words reached me, followed by the sound of something being jammed into door.  
  
I frantically moved aside moth-eaten cloths and inspected the room until my fingers brushed against something hard and rough. I followed the sensation and uncovered an old wooden chest hidden beneath layers of dust and fabric.  
  
My heart pounded as I opened the chest, and there it was—a coiled rope ladder, weathered and aged, but intact.  
  
There was no time to be relieved. I raced to the window, my heart pounding as I fumbled to attach the rope ladder as behind me, I could hear the doorknob jiggling.  
  
With the ladder in place, I wasted no time. I descended, rung by rung, bathed in the silvery glow of the moon as I made my escape. The ladder didn't reach the ground. I had to jump from at least ten feet.  
  
But then my feet were in the cool, damp grass and I ran. The world outside was a blur, my vision clouded by the poison and exhaustion, but somehow my legs kept moving. The mansion was secluded, hidden away from prying eyes. But as I sprinted through the darkness, I saw a faint, distant light.  
  
I couldn't tell how far I ran or how long it took. Time and distance became meaningless in my frantic escape. My mind was a haze of fear, pain, and confusion.  
  
Eventually my legs gave out, and I collapsed. I gasped for breath, my chest heaving, and my body trembling with fatigue. But the faint light I had seen was now closer, and I could make out the shape of a house. I crawled towards the light, my vision dimming.
