lt was in a little ziplock bag, somehow completely dry but it was dead. i went back home and plugged it in, for 2 weeks it stayed in the charger. 

“it’s broken” said everyone who saw it. but i didn’t give up on it. after those two weeks it lit up with the familiar apple logo before displaying the home screen. 

the phone’s home screen was a photo of a little girl that looked to be 5-7 years old, cute as a button, playing with a dog. i was surprised when i tried to open it that it had no password. the only app visible on the home screen was the notes app. 

i spent about half an hour debating on whether i should open it or not. they clearly wanted me to see whatever is inside the notes app or else they wouldn’t have hidden everything else, right?

i caved, and opened the app. it was a log of some sorts, like a diary. i began to read. i don’t know how to explain what i read or even where to talk about it so i’m gonna copy it and paste it here. i’m sorry for disrespecting the owner of this phone’s privacy. i don’t know where else i can show it so i’m gonna show it here, on reddit.

here’s what it said:


kaylee has been jumping up and down since i told her we were going to italy. i had to give her my laptop to watch youtube and work on my phone instead because she wouldn’t shut up about all the things we plan to do.

i won’t take her to any of the historical landmarks, a 6 year old wouldn’t care about those. we’re only staying for 4 days. the first day we’re going horse riding by the beach, the next day eating at 10 different restaurants and seing which is best, and in the last day i’m taking her on a boat in venice.

this is the same exact trip i took with my wife 8 years ago. the same trip i proposed to her on. i wanted to take kaylee here so she could know how it all began, exactly.

we’ve been having so much fun over the last 2 days i haven’t had any time to type in here. were about to get on the boat now.

i just told kaylee what happened on a boat just like this one, she was super exited. she couldn’t believe she was on the same trip me and her mother took to get married. i proposed to her on a boat like this.

she was jumping up and down like she always does when she’s exited. but something strange happened. the guy who’s rowing the boat turned his head and frowned at her. but there was something alarmingly wrong about his face, his expression, the way his neck was twisted.

i apologized and he continued to row. i told kaylee to try not to move a lot as the boat is not that big. she agreed and leaned on one side, watching the buildings around her. they were all kinds of colors and sizes, she waved at everyone and most of them waved back. it’s adorable.

i laid my head back a bit and somehow fell asleep, this was very strange as i’m prone to seasickness. what was stranger is where the boat was. it was no longer in a river with colorful buildings on each side, rather on a big ocean.

i was kind of thrown back by this and asked kaylee where we were and to my surprise she was also asleep. i looked up at the sky, it was nighttime. last i recall it was sunset. have i really slept for that long? why hasn’t the boat driver woken me up? 

i went up to him and tapped him on the shoulder, this time he let go of the oars and they fell into the now ocean and sunk. aren’t boat ores supposed to float? he looked at me with that now familiar frown, his eyes only a few inches away from mine. i fell back and he got new ores and continued rowing. i have no idea where he got them from, the boat is not big enough to carry oars of that size, and even if it was, i have not seen any spares on the boat.

when i fell back, i got a good look of the sky. it was completely blank. no moon, no clouds, no stars. you’d think that was normal due to pollution, but how is their pollution in the middle of the ocean? 

kaylee woke up around here, she began to panic. i immediately hugged her and shushed her, as to not anger the driver anymore. she asked at least 20 questions which were all met with an “i don’t know.”
