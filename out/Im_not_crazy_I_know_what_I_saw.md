I just wanted to try something new for a change.

I made a conscious decision to try going hiking while I was in Yellowstone as I was packing my belongings for the trip. My parents used to be skilled hikers back when they were younger, but they stopped when my brother and I were born. The thought to go hiking just randomly came to me and I haven't really thought of my parents after they died a few years ago in that car accident.

After the harrowing 14 hour drive from San Francisco to Yellowstone, I finally arrived. I unpacked, made myself comfortable in my lodge, and then I went out into a hiking trail. The cool breeze, damp air, and quiet sounds of the forest animals all combined to a very amazing experience. It felt like I was in literal paradise.

After an hour of wandering on the hiking trail, I felt a strong gut feeling. This feeling was strange, It felt as if something was stalking me. The leaves started to rustle loudly and I panicked. The sounds stopped and I smelled a very foul stench, A stench that smelled like a dead corpse. "Something died." I said inside my head. I slowly went and looked over behind a tree to find a pile dead deer covered in blood. They have all been cut open by someone, or something.

Freaked out with all the things that I've just seen. I started to panic. I tried to run back to my lodge but I inevitably got lost. I realized that I lost my flashlight when I fell down the hill. I look around and I hear sudden movement on top of the trees and that was when I realized. It was following me. I tried to call for help using my phone but it broke when I fell down the hill. So I ran, and kept running until I lost breath. I heard a thud behind me. I slowly turned my head and I saw it, just staring at me motionless.

I tried to run away but before even making the first step, It Screamed. I immediately fell on my knees due to the sheer intensity of his scream. The screaming quickly turned into loud ringing as my ears started to bleed. It slowly walked up to me and looked at me. Its skin so pale, even paler than a person that has fallen ill. Its eyes so hollow and empty. Its breath cold as the winter breeze.

Just a few moments of seeing into turned me inside out. I passed out and woke up in a hospital. They questioned me on what exactly happened. After I told them, Everyone thought I went crazy. I kept trying to convince them but they wouldn't believe. They placed me inside a mental institution because of my persistence to try and convince them that what happened was true.

Please save me, They've trapped me in this room saying its for my safety and the everyone else's.
