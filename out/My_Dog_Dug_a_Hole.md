I love my dog; he's an incredibly excitable border collie cross I brought home from an animal rescue centre about 2 years ago and we've been pretty inseparable since. Living alone, it was nice to have the company and it felt like I was doing my bit by rehoming an animal in need, we saved each other really, as it was hard not to feel isolated at times until he came into my life.

Monty and I lived on the outskirts of a rural town, so we didn't have regular visitors, and to be honest, I wasn't really a "social butterfly" so tended to keep to myself, with the exception of travelling to the local supermarket with Monty in tow to grab some household supplies.

I had family of course, but as you get older, you tend to lose touch with people and I was so used to my own company, until Monty came along, that I stopped reaching out and eventually, they stopped too. It's not like we fell out, I just wasn't the best at socialising, and we slowly drifted apart.

Like I said, me and Monty really did save each other as with him by my side, I felt like I had everything I needed to get by in life.

He did have one, slightly annoying quirk though, he absolutely loved to dig holes. They say that's the risk of getting a rescue though, as you don't know their background, you also don't know if they learned any unusual behaviours and whilst it wasn't too weird for a dog to dig holes, Monty was always digging at something in our garden whenever he was let out.

Two years in I'd gotten used to the routine though, let him out in the morning to do his business, fill the hole with a shovel I kept near the back door, get on with the rest of my day. He would usually manage to dig multiple times a day, so it had become a regular occurrence, and at least it helped him burn off some energy.

It wasn't until last week when things started to get a little weird...

Monday started off pretty normal, got up, let Monty out, filled the hole, logged on to my computer and did some work, let Monty out, filled another hole. I ate lunch, went back to work, finished at around six o'clock, had some food, let Monty out, filled a hole, scrolled mindlessly through social media before letting Monty out for his last toilet visit before bed. Filled another hole back up then settled down for sleep.

Tuesday was different, as when I got up to let Monty out, I noticed what looked like another hole at the back of the garden. I could have sworn I filled all the holes Monty had excavated yesterday but maybe I missed one...I shrugged it off and went to grab the shovel, my bleary eyes beginning to adjust to the early morning sun, and walked over to begin the daily ritual of filling in the hole. It was only when I got closer, I noticed how deep the hole actually was. I rubbed my eyes, encouraging them to focus as I glanced down at what appeared to be a hole around two feet wide, but looked to be at least six feet deep. I stared at Monty in disbelief, who stared back up with his usual mischievous face, tongue lolling out to the side of his mouth and tail wagging enthusiastically. If I didn't know better, I'd say he almost looked proud of his most recent creation.

I grabbed my phone and messaged my boss, letting her know I'd be logging on slightly later but would make up the time, grabbed my shovel, and went to work filling in Monty's most ambitious creation yet...

Work was slow, but I made up for the extra hour I lost to filling the hole back in. Monty had been particularly excitable throughout the day, so I let him out in the afternoon to burn off the energy and give me the chance to concentrate on my work. In hindsight, not my smartest move, as the menace started digging again and had a whole afternoon to work on his next masterpiece...

Four foot wide, eight foot deep. Honestly at this point, I was kind of impressed at his dedication, as it was very rare he dug up the same spot. Again, he watched, tail wagging, tongue flopped from his muddy mouth as I spent most of my evening shovelling the mud back into the small crater he made.

It was around nine o'clock when the exhaustion hit me, my stomach growled, and I realised I had been shovelling for so long I had completely missed a meal and missed feeding Monty. Oddly though, he didn't seem to be making a fuss about the lack of a meal, instead he was entranced by the progress I had made. There looked to be a few feet left to fill, but I was mentally done, and retreated inside to have a quick snack and feed Monty before collapsing into bed.

I awoke with a start at ten o'clock Wednesday morning. Although I had overslept, I still felt tired and sore from my unexpected workout the prior evening. Reaching for my phone I saw several missed calls from my Boss and messages asking why I hadn't logged on yet. I was too embarrassed to admit I overslept due to filling a hole my dog had made, and instead messaged back apologising repeatedly, whilst informing her I had come down with a nasty stomach bug and wouldn't be logging on. Satisfied with the deception, she wished me a speedy recovery and I put my phone back down, sighing with relief that I had evaded getting myself into any further trouble.

It was only after this I noticed Monty wasn't waiting by his bed or giving me a stern telling off for missing his breakfast…

Sixteen foot wide, twenty foot deep. I hadn't realised in my exhaustion from the previous night I had forgot to close the garden door, and Monty had obviously taken offence to me filling in his most recent work of art. I called out his name but received no response, a knot of unease started to form in my stomach as my mind began to run through the many fates that could have fell upon him. I went back inside and turned the house upside down, checking every possible nook and cranny he may have decided to hide in but to no avail. I went looking around the garden, checking the fenced border to see if there were any signs he had managed to dig himself an escape route into the forested area nearby, but there was no evidence of any attempt to escape.

The only conclusion I could make was he was in the hole. I had guessed about twenty foot deep, but I didn't actually climb in to verify as I had no real means to get myself back out if it turned out my assumption was wrong. I tried calling out his name, desperately attempting to keep my voice as neutral as possible to hide the anxiety bubbling under the surface, but there was nothing in return, no bark, no whimper, just silence as I stared down into the darkness below...

I did next what I thought was most logical at the time, I called for help. I dialled 911 and explained my unusual situation to the operator who was trying and failing to hide their amusement at such a strange request. They did however forward me to the local fire department who suggested I contact a construction firm nearby who could determine if the hole was safe to go down, save Monty, and then fill it back up.

I called the construction firm and explained everything, much to the bemusement of the person who took the call. They did say they could send a surveyor around in the afternoon to take a look and provide me with a quote. It was at this stage I realised that this wasn't going to be done out of generosity and regretfully asked how much such a service could cost, "Depending on how deep the hole is, and how long it takes to fill, it could cost a couple of thousand, but we will be able to give you a more accurate quote once the surveyor has inspected the area" My heart sank, I fortunately did have a bit of money set aside however, it was clear this would wipe out my savings and take a credit card with it, but I was determined to save my furry companion.

I agreed to the appointment and after the call messaged my boss to request some additional time off covering the rest of the week due to "family matters I needed to urgently resolve". I got the green light and did another round of searching the house for Monty before the surveyor was due to arrive.

The surveyors' van pulled up just after midday and a portly, middle-aged man dressed in a tight-fitting suit, with an even tighter hi-vis, emerged from the vehicle with a surprisingly sprightly step and a smile on his face "Good afternoon, my name’s Rick from MC Construction. I believe I've got you booked in to survey a sinkhole today?" I nodded, taken aback by his warmth, and stumbled over my words "And a dog. My dog. To see if you can rescue my dog. Monty" Rick nodded and quickly returned to his van, opening the door to grab a clipboard and pen. He riffled through some pages attached, and looked back up "Ah, ok yep, I see on the notes you believe your dog may have dug up the sinkhole?" I could see his expression change to one of curiosity, likely trying to figure out if I had a screw loose, but it quickly faded back to his warm demeanour when I nodded and told him the hole was out back.

He followed me into the house as we made our way to the garden, glancing with raised eyebrows at the chaos of strewn cushions and displaced shelving throughout the home. I realised at this point I had made no effort to tidy back up after my original search attempt for Monty and apologised for the mess, explaining I had been looking for my dog around the home before he arrived. He nodded understandingly, and we entered the garden making our way towards the hole.

Rick approached carefully, ironically something I had absent mindedly not even considered until this point, and peered down into the dark below, "And you said this is around twenty feet deep?" he appeared concerned as he looked over the edge into the darkness below "Feels like it may be a bit deeper than that but I have some tools in my van to do some testing" He turned on a pivot and headed back to his van whilst I stood staring down in the void below, my eyes unable to adjust to the darkness and a growing sense of discomfort beginning to swell within.

I was suddenly brought back to the present by Rick placing some stakes and tools on the ground nearby, making a clattering of metal clanging together "I'll need to do some measurements and confirm the sinkhole doesn't present any further risk to your property before we can commence any work, but it should only take me an hour or so, it may be worth you grabbing a coffee and some lunch" He smiled cheerfully as he started to organise his pile of tools, setting aside his clipboard, which I saw had an itemised list of tasks he needed to do. I offered Rick a drink and was met with a cheery decline, so left him to get on with things, whilst I went to tidy up the chaos I had left earlier.

A couple of hours passed, and after tidying up and getting some much-needed fuel in the form of coffee and a bagel, I went out to see how Rick was getting along. He was nowhere to be seen. His tools were still there, and some stakes had been stuck in the ground connected by hazard tape, so I went to check out front to see if he had simply gone back to his van to get something, but when I got there his van was still locked up on the drive.

It was like he had up and vanished, I called out his name and walked back to the garden but heard no response, a singular thought then jolted into my mind, what if he has fallen in? I ran back over to the hole and looked down, careful with my footing to not accidentally end up in there myself, and shouted down into the dark abyss, "RIIIIICCCKKKK?" nothing. No response, not even an echo, just resounding silence.

I frantically dialled the construction company and managed to stumble out the right words to convince them of the gravity of the situation. They calmed me down, and explained they would send two of their crew out with the necessary tools to investigate further and they would also ring Rick's personal and work number to see if they could reach him.

With the panic starting to subside, I went back inside and collapsed on the sofa, my mind racing with multiple possible explanations as to Rick’s fate, but my body drained from a cocktail of adrenaline and exhaustion from the day before.

Sixteen-foot wide, unknown feet deep. I was startled awake by a high-pitched squeal from outside. Adrenaline surged into my body, and I was flooded with a range of emotions, anxiety, fear…and hope. I ran out and looked towards the hole, my eyes adjusting against the pitch black and saw the source. A rabbit gently hopping through the tall grass near the perimeter of the hole. I remained silent and still, observing as the rabbit seemed to be drawn to the opening of the sinkhole. It slowly approached as if in a trance, but before I could make a sound to try and scare it away, it flopped to the side, and fell into the hole.

The next sounds I heard were another shrill high-pitched squeal, which sent a shiver down my spine, followed by a nauseating crunch. My heart wanted to leap out of my chest and every fibre of my being was telling something was wrong, but I felt compelled to see what had happened. As I stood, I felt the ground rumble beneath me, subtle at first, like small vibrations, but as I walked closer to the hole it felt stronger, more violent. Fear was rising through my body in anticipation of what could be awaiting me at the opening, but I also was clinging on to the hope the vibrations were Rick with Monty clambering up the walls of the hole.

When I reached the opening, I looked down into the darkness and could barely make out something in the hole. The longer I was staring into the darkness, the stronger the compulsion to go into hole felt. I could feel my body physically swaying as the unease and fear continued to hit me in waves. Despite this, I remained stood upright, ready to help once I could see signs of life, I needed to be there for Monty as he was for me.

I grabbed my phone and switched the torch on, casting a feeble light into the void below, but the small light it provided meant I could start to see a larger shape moving in the darkness below. They were making their way back up! I called down to Rick but was met with a gurgling groan in response, the shadowy shape continued its ascent up the hole.

Once the light reached it, I retched. The shape, it wasn’t human, at least not anymore. It was an amalgamation of flesh and bone protruding from too many limbs. There were clumps of varying coloured fur, next to teeth and claws sticking out of its back, with exposed muscle and strands of sinews between its clawed limbs. There appeared to be scraps of hi-vis clothing and a tattered suit dangling from the many limbs and its face…It’s face was a horrid, fanged maw, with several rows of teeth and multiple mismatched eyes glistening with blood and saliva under the light.

It clawed its way closer and the compulsion to join it in the pit nearly overwhelmed me, my mind was shattered, but as I started to feel my body lean forward, I caught a glimpse of an object stuck in its side. A small metal tag engraved with one word… MONTY. 

I was shocked back into the present when a claw appeared at the top of the hole, grasping at the surface and causing the earth to rumble, nearly throwing me off balance. My body surged into action, and I ran, my heart pounding but the adrenaline pushing me into motion. Tears streamed down my face as my mind processed what I had saw, whilst I could hear the horrific beast clambering the rest of the way up behind me.

I ran for what felt like hours, my heart racing, my mind almost torn apart by the horrors I had witnessed and clouded by grief. I eventually collapsed near a gas station a few miles away and awoke hours later to see the sunrise.

That was a few weeks ago now, and I never heard anyone else mention the beast or witnessed any media coverage of it. I called the construction firm to be told there was no appointment to visit my property in their records. I then asked about Rick, and the line went quiet for a moment before another voice broke the silence..."This record has been flagged for board member access only" the mysterious voice growled "You will find no more answers here, and I strongly suggest you cease any further investigations for you own wellbeing" The call then cut off before I could even muster a response.

At one point, I thought about going back to my old home to try and find some answers, but my stomach felt knotted with unease and fear began to run up my spine each time I remotely entertained the idea. The thinly veiled threat from the construction company, combined with the potential to encounter the nightmarish creature again, quickly discouraged me from the idea.

All I can say for sure is if you have a beloved pet start digging in your garden obsessively. Please make them stop and get out before it’s too late.
