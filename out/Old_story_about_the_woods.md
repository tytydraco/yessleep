I’ve always liked the small woods on the outskirts of San Antonio. It’s quiet there, peaceful, and far enough away from everything to feel like my own little world. I’d go there a lot, alone, just to think or wander. It wasn’t much—a patch of trees, some trails—but it was mine. Nothing strange had ever happened there. It was just the woods.

At least, that’s what I thought.

That day started out normal enough. I was wandering deeper than I usually do, curious to see what was beyond the familiar trails. The air felt different, though. Heavier, somehow. I didn’t think much of it until I saw the hut.

It stood there, half-hidden by the trees, like it had always been there and I’d just never noticed. It was small, maybe five or six feet high, made entirely of sticks, branches, and vines. The roof was sagging, the walls uneven, but that wasn’t what made me stop. It was the skulls.

They were everywhere—hanging from the trees around the hut. Animal skulls, mostly, but some looked human. Each one had a pentagon painted on it in what looked like blood. The sight of them sent a shiver down my spine.

I should’ve left right then and there, but something about the hut drew me in. I stepped closer, slowly, feeling like I was crossing some invisible line I wasn’t supposed to.

The inside of the hut was dark and cramped, lit only by a few candles. Black, blue, and red wax dripped onto the dirt floor, filling the air with their faint, acrid scent. In the middle of the room was a flat stone, and on top of it was a book.

The book’s cover looked like leather, but not the kind you’d find in a store. It was rough, almost organic, and covered in strange symbols I couldn’t read. I don’t know why, but I felt compelled to pick it up.

The second my fingers touched it, I heard it—a branch snapping outside the hut.

I froze.

It wasn’t the kind of snap the wind makes. It was deliberate, like something—or someone—was out there. My heart started pounding as I strained to listen. Then, another snap. Closer this time.

I panicked. Gripping the book tightly, I turned and bolted out of the hut.

The moment I stepped outside, I heard footsteps behind me. Heavy, deliberate, too loud to be human. My breath caught in my throat as the sound grew closer, each step shaking the ground beneath me. Then came the breathing—deep, guttural, and impossibly close.

I didn’t look back. I couldn’t. All I could do was run, crashing through the trees as branches tore at my face and arms. My lungs burned, my legs screamed, but the footsteps didn’t stop.

I saw the edge of the woods ahead. My house wasn’t far. I pushed harder, sprinting faster than I ever thought I could.

The second I stepped out of the trees, the footsteps stopped.

I collapsed onto the grass, gasping for air. When I turned back to look, the woods were silent. Empty.

I haven’t gone to the woods since.
