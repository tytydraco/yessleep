We went straight down into the basement and began a frantic search for the belongings of the deceased victims using the flashlights we had left down there before. I was in the main room with the furnace, sorting through stacks of junk. There were definitely items from victims everywhere, things that went unnoticed by us before, like graffiti cans someone must have brought to tag the old buildings, women's bags, wallets, etc. The amount of those types of items down there made my stomach queasy but I kept searching, the silence cut down by the sounds of things rustling around. 

*“Grace!”* I heard Vanessa whisper-shout my name from the adjacent room. 

I hurried through the doorless entryway that led to that area of the basement and shined my flashlight on Vanessa, who was leaning on the wall with her ear against it. *“Come listen,”* she whispered and gestured for me to come near. 

I drew closer and pressed my ear over the wall, frowning. I didn't hear anything but our quiet, rhythmic breathing so I gave her a confused look. 

“I heard sounds in the wall.” Vanessa looked at me with wide, fearful eyes. We both were thinking the same thing, thinking about how three of the four children's bodies were found within the wall. 

“Probably rats.” I stupidly said. 

She gave me a look. “Have you seen *one* living thing since we've been in this mess?” I didn't say anything. 

Vanessa looked over at a tall wardrobe standing in the corner, mahogany and draped with cobwebs.  She walked over to it and looked inside it. There were dusty coats inside and she pushed them to one end, jumping as she was startled by her own reflection in a mirror that took up the whole back panel of the wardrobe's interior. 

“Weird.” I noted, shining my flashlight at it. 

A sound made us turn our heads behind us. An object we disturbed during our search settling in place, maybe. Something dropping or shifting naturally. But when I looked back at the mirror I saw a glimpse of the upper half of Peter's face peering over my right shoulder, only his eye sockets and brown bangs visible. I screamed and jumped back. 

“What?!” Vanessa asked, shining the flashlight around to see nothing at all. 

“He… He…” I stuttered, my hand on my chest as I looked behind me and backed into the wardrobe. It slightly shook, and the mirror inside jostled out of position, a corner dropping and revealing a black crack. 

“Wait a second…” Vanessa removed the mirror to find a dark hole leading into the wall. My mouth fell open. I grabbed Vanessa's arm as she lifted her leg to go inside. 

“What are you doing?!” 

“What if it's in the walls?” She whispered, shrugging me off and climbing inside. “Are you coming or what?” 

I cursed under my breath and followed her, bending low and slipping through the hole to the narrow crumbly space between drywall. I didn't think the basement could get creepier but somehow it did. I felt claustrophobic there and I wanted out immediately, but I knew we needed to leave no stone unturned so I pressed on, following behind Vanessa. We reached a dead end soon, where the back of the staircase was presumably, and our flashlight beam reflected off something shiny under some light rubble. 

“Look!” Vanessa fell to her knees and pulled bits of wall and wooden beams off of a dark gray backpack. The silver zipper  had caught the light. Immediately, she zipped it open and triumphantly pulled out a sachet like the one I'd found earlier. The air was permeated with the smell of decay as soon as she revealed it but we were too excited to care. 

“Why am I the designated eye holder?” I griped as she gave it to me. 

“Come on, let's look for that purse before those things get tired of chasing Yazzy.” Vanessa nudged me and I led us back the way we came.  

“... Where's the hole?” I asked as I looked at the part of the wall where I was sure we had entered. The tunnel stretched on farther than we remembered, and we could hear the sounds of light footsteps as someone we couldn't see ran just up ahead. Despite this, we pressed on, hoping it was the ghost of Peter returning for his eyes. We walked and walked and walked. 

“Oh God.” Vanessa whispered as we realized we were stuck in an infinite loop behind the wall.

“This can't be happening.” I whimpered. 

It seemed like a lifetime later when my flashlight beam landed on a figure crouched with his back to us. The red shirt and black hair pointed to it being Peter, and he wept softly into his hands. 

“Peter.” I said softly as Vanessa clutched onto me for dear life. “We have something that belongs to you. Let us go peacefully and you can have them.” 

I felt a soft breath on the back of my neck and spun around, my heart jumping out my chest. Vanessa screamed. Peter was now behind us, with a grin that was  impossibly wide. I looked down at his open hand, where the sachet which I did not remember handing him was now sitting. With that, he was silently pulled by an unseen force back into the darkness, the holes in his face looking at us the entire time. 

“Thank God!” I cried, looking behind me to see that the hole leading out of that dreadful space had appeared again. We hurriedly climbed through, through the wardrobe and back into the basement.  

***“Grace.”*** Zack's voice tickled my ear.

The stagnant basement air was filled with the shrill sounds of Vanessa and I’s terror as we burst into a run, not even bothering to look behind us. We beelined for the stairs, Vanessa running faster than me. I was scared that she'd leave me behind like I had left Zack behind. I tried to run faster as she reached the first step before I did, my shoes stomping the floor so hard it shook. 

Then suddenly I was under the floor, my body wracked with pain and the sound of wood splintering and giving way covering up Vanessa's screams. I looked up through the hole, and saw Zack crouching over me, his pale hand reaching for my face. 

I thrashed wildly like a caged bird and kicked him away, scrambling deeper into the hole. It was then that I realized it was a crawlspace, and there was a small hatch just beyond where one of the kids' bodies was found. I hurtled through it, crawling through the claustrophobic little tunnel caked with dust and webs. It smelled like rot down there, but I hardly noticed as I tried to listen to see if I could hear Zack giving chase. I didn't hear anything, but I looked behind me anyway. 

I couldn't hear anything because somehow the little blonde ghost was silently scuttling after me in the crawlspace instead of Zack. Her mouth hung open, a black void like her eyes. Her dirty, cracked and bloody fingernails scraped the floor as she went. Her movements looked unnatural, like she was in sped up footage, and my heart lurched in my ribcage. 

I crawled faster, hyperventilating and feeling my mind cloud with overwhelming fear. Up ahead, I spotted a dead end, but just in front of it was a hole. I allowed myself to drop through, and I felt the crisp grass and something else cushion my fall. I rolled over on my back and looked to my side to see a faded, old pink clutch purse, with a zipper and a bit of what looked like old blood smeared on it. I grabbed it and zipped it open as a stark white arm followed by a curtain of blonde hair slipped through the hole. A revolting stench unleashed into my nose as I pulled out another sachet and threw it at the wraith clawing her way towards me. 

Sarah, on all fours, stopped, stared at it, then snatched the sachet and crawled backwards lightning fast until she disappeared into nothingness. The tension in my body diminished as I was alleviated of her presence. 

As I crawled from under the house, I wondered briefly about the crawlspace which very clearly seemed like a discreet escape route for a man who knew he was doing something terribly illegal. A way he could leave without being caught If the authorities came to his door. But if he had gone through such lengths, why did he end up killing himself and revealing his crimes? 

This didn't occupy my thoughts for too long as I looked out at the empty street and wondered where Vanessa was. Did she escape Zack? If so, where did she go? 

As if on cue, a distant scream echoed into the night, and my head snapped towards the treeline behind the house on the left which we had never explored. Realizing this was Vanessa's voice, I darted towards where I heard it, hoping beyond all hope that I could make it in time. I was not going to let her die like I had done to Zack.

I weaved around the trees, my lungs on fire and my legs growing tired. “Vanessa!” I called. “Where are you?!” 

I spotted platinum blonde hair in the distance and sped up, approaching Vanessa who was standing still and staring upward. I crashed into her, hugging her in relief that she seemed fine. “I found Sarah's eyes and gave them to her!” I told her breathlessly. “We just have one last pair left!” 

I pulled back and looked at her shell shocked face. Finally, I followed her gaze and looked up, pointing my flashlight skyward. 

The eyeless corpse of what I recognized to be Lisa Waller dangled by a noose from a tree branch, cutting through the silence with the steady creaking of the rope. She was a white woman with brown hair, a tank top, shorts, and sneakers, who seemed to be in her mid twenties to early thirties. 

I looked around, sweat falling into my eyes as I took in the sight of dozens of corpses hanging from the trees, all eyeless and all with nooses around their necks. Not only that, but there was a graveyard of cars, just sitting there in the spacious gaps between the trees.

“I…I don't understand.” I stuttered, recognizing the corpse of Rachel, who had killed Lisa in wraith form on video, hanging not too far away. 

“It's like how the Eye Ripper died.” Vanessa whispered, facing me with eyes glossy with tears. “That's why we didn't see Bryce's corpse, or Zack's. They end up hanging the bodies to mimic his death.” 

“But…why?” I blinked, at a loss. Vanessa shrugged, cluelessly. I decided to tell her about the crawlspace. “The purse was under the house. When I fell through the floor, I went through the crawlspace and there was a hole leading under there. I don't know why that sicko put it down there, but honestly I'm more confused about why he went through the trouble of making an escape plan if he was just gonna end up killing himself anyway.” 

“Maybe….” Vanessa considered. “Maybe the killer didn't hang himself after all. Maybe he was their first victim. The curse could've started when they haunted him and pulled his eyes out, then hung his body. I mean, even the cops thought it was far-fetched for a man to hang himself after gouging his own eyes out but they said there was no sign of foul play.” 

“So does that mean his ghost is around here somewhere?” The thought was chilling to me. 

“I don't know.” Vanessa looked at me, the same apprehension on her face. “Hey,  that video we watched earlier… Lisa said William’s parents were part of the occult and that's why she thinks he's responsible. Witches or something, I guess. When he killed William last, the curse started.” 

“We don't even know how to find his eyes.” I felt hopeless all of a sudden. “He didn't go missing with something like the others did.” 

“Wait a minute…” Vanessa looked thoughtful. “That woman said that he had actually escaped from the basement at one point, but the killer chased him down and got him. I wonder if it was these woods, and that's why they put the bodies up here.” 

I felt a shiver run down my spine. “Look, what are you getting at?” 

“I think… I think William's eyes are out here.” Vanessa replied. “I just have this feeling.” 

“Are you serious? That'll take forever!” I wiped the grime and dust off my glasses. 

“Do you have somewhere to be?” 

I huffed at her sarcastic response. The two of us started to meander, unable to look away from the hanging corpses as we did. I thought I heard a whisper but when I looked around, I saw nothing. I worried we weren't alone out here. I unclipped my walkie and decided to see if John or Yazmine would answer, *“Hello? Are you guys alive?”* There was nothing but static. 

Vanessa filmed the hanging bodies and I thought that was distasteful but remained silent. I heard a twig snap and looked over my shoulder, seeing an arm retract behind a tree. Before I could voice my concerns, Vanessa screamed up ahead. 

The body of John was hanging, eyes missing and dark skin a ghoulish gray from lack of blood flow. I remember it just like it was yesterday, the feeling of great loss hitting me like a punch to the gut. Aside from Yazmine, he was the nicest to me out of everyone, and every time I try to recall one of his charming smiles or the way he would laugh at his own jokes, the visage of his dead face is smeared all over those memories. 

I knelt next to Vanessa, who was sobbing in a heap on the ground, and wordlessly pulled her to her feet so we could run from the entity watching us. She didn't even question it as I dragged her along, she just clutched me and wept. 

Suddenly, both our walkies crackled to life, scaring the crap out of us both, but the fear was replaced with relief as Yazmine's voice came through. *“Are you all alive still? I'm back but I can't find anyone.”*

“Yaz, we're in the woods,” I frantically all but yelled into the walkie talkie as Vanessa went over to retch and dry heave next to a tree, “there's bodies hanging everywhere, they're the people who were killed in this place.” 

*“What the fuck?”* 

“A-and, oh god, John is up there, too,” my voice shook as I broke the bad news, “he's dead, they got him.” Yazmine cursed up a storm over the walkie, covering her grief with anger, and I interrupted her, knowing we had little time to spare, “We only have one last kid left. Vanessa thinks his eyes are out here but you need to come help us look. We're in the woods behind that house you were looking at earlier.” 

It was maybe ten minutes before she found us, during which Vanessa and I had hid in a large tree hollow as we heard footsteps crushing sticks and leaves all around us. Someone, no, something, was following us and being eerily stealthy about it, and it could've been more than one. We were shivering within the hole in the rotting bark when we heard her call out, and we crawled out to meet her. 

“Why were you hiding?” Yazmine looked pale and exhausted as she regarded us. I had no doubt we looked similar. 

“There's things all around here, they've been following us,” Vanessa whispered, putting a finger to her lips. 

“They haven't tried attacking yet, which is somehow creepier than if they did,” I added as I glanced around us in paranoia, “but let's not wait until they do, let's find this kid's eyes so we can leave this horrible fucking place behind.” 

“What's that?” Yazmine pointed to the tree hollow where we had hid. The opening began at the ground, looking almost like a semi circle door to some elfen house. She pointed at something we didn't notice in our panic to find a hiding place from our pursuers, something that was sticking out of the ground a bit. It was white and thin. 

I bent down and inspected it, realizing it was a shoelace. I tugged it and a moss covered shoe broke loose from a pile of fallen leaves, acorn shells, twigs, and dirt. 

Vanessa gasped from behind me. “It's William's! His body was recovered from the basement missing his shoe.” 

“You told me he didn't go missing with anything!” I frowned. 

“No, Grace, he didn't go *missing* without a shoe,” she corrected me irritably, “he was *found dead* without it.”

The pieces of the puzzle connected in my head. “That woman on the video, she said he escaped the basement, ran into the woods, but ultimately got found and caught by the killer…” I looked in the shoe to be sure the sachet wasn't inside, and to my great disappointment, it wasn't. 

“Yeah,” Vanessa nodded, “it's a part of the story that's sort of hard to find, but I remember listening to a podcast and they said he actually admitted that in his letter. The note he left behind was really long, and full of weird perverted stuff, not all of it was released.” 

“He hid in here.” I revealed, gesturing to the tree hollow after dropping the shoe. “And he was caught, and in the struggle his shoe fell off.” 

Vanessa started filming again, pointing the camera at the tree, “This is almost out of battery, but I need to get this shot… Hey, what's that?” 

Yazmine and I followed her gaze, she had the camera pointing upwards. I squinted my eyes, not seeing anything. “Huh?” 

“Look at that branch, under the one with the old bird's nest,” Vanessa instructed, pointing with her free hand. 

Finally, my eyes landed on it: a sachet, tied by the little rope holding it closed to a twig sticking out of the branch. 

“It's his eyes!” I cried. “He put them in the tree!” The depravity of the Eye Ripper astounded me. The tree reminded him of where he had found the little boy, the chase must've been a rush for him, aside from the fear of being caught. I imagined the sick pleasure he could've felt once he caught and killed him, using the tree as his own twisted memorial where he would place part of the boy's remains to remind himseld of his gruesome crime. 

“Hold this.” Vanessa shoved the camcorder in my hands and immediately got to work scaling the oak like an overgrown monkey. Yazmine and I watched her, antsy. 

***“Hahaha.”***

A little snicker caught our attention and we looked behind us. I immediately recognized Rachel's eyeless face, cracked by a wicked red-painted smile that slashed across her cheeks like a scar as she peeked around a tree. 

“Vanessa, hurry!” I screamed. She looked down at the apparition slowly advancing on us, and scrambled towards the hanging sachet. 

I grabbed Yazmine's arm and pulled her back, but stopped in my tracks when I heard footsteps approaching from behind. I turned and there was an unfamiliar man, the spirit of another eyeless victim. 

Then came another, emerging from the trees. And another, a young teenage boy. And another, a woman in a police uniform. They wore different expressions, some of their expressions vacant, some smiling dementedly, some frozen in a silent scream, some twisted into a picture of perpetual misery with bloody tears and an upside down smile that lengthened their jaw more than humanly possible. 

“Go back to the house and lock the door!” Vanessa yelled, her fingers outstretched towards the sachet as she straddled a branch. “I'll meet you there!” 

The palm of Yazmine and I’s hands seemed glued together with sweat as we ran in between the eyeless wraiths, back towards where we could see that street in the distance. They extended their arms towards us, fingers grasping for our eyes. An unsettling chorus of pained moans, deranged laughter, unintelligible whispers, and furious yelling erupted all around us from the entities as we narrowly escaped with our lives. 

The next account of this experience will be the last one, and unfortunately, it'll get worse before it gets better.
