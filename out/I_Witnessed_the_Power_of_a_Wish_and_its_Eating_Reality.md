My ramblings will make no sense unless you've also read my [initial report](https://www.reddit.com/r/AliasReads/comments/1dr8ltx/i_witnessed_the_power_of_a_wish_and_its/).

“I wish I could undo it all. I wish I could take it back.” Without context, without direction. I wished to undo it all. Everything. I think I accidentally wished to undo everything that ever has been.

And what’s worse is all this time later, as I write this, it seems that only but a very few can see this devastation. People go about their days, completely unaware of the damage I’ve wrought upon them. They do not react to the embalming of our present. They live on, existing seemingly separate from what I’ve done. But I see it happening. I know it is. And I know I’ve not yet completely lost my mind. My sanity is intact. I just know it is. It has to be.   
  
Lastly, these were and are occurrences which aren’t meant for people to experience, and I'm sorry if it's hard to understand as I've written them. It's difficult to explain some of the events. Have you tried to explain a color before? Without referencing other colors, that is? That's what some of these experiences feel like in hindsight.

The initial signs were subtle, such small things at first, almost imperceptible. My house was moved a few feet to the west. Every other line on the sidewalk between 10^(th) and Havannah (13^(th)) was gone. The air weighed just a little less. I tried to rationalize these discrepancies, convincing myself that my mind was playing tricks on me.

At first, I tried to rationalize these discrepancies. Perhaps the city had decided to repave the sidewalks, for example. I convinced myself that these changes were merely the product of an overactive imagination, or potential forgetfulness spurred on by my stress.

But then, the absences became impossible to ignore.

People began to disappear. Parts of them, anyway. It started with acquaintances, people I saw in passing but never really knew. I first noticed it at the grocery store. I was standing in line, lost in thought, when I looked up and saw the cashier, Jack, who I'd chatted with on numerous occasions. A friendly guy, always quick with a smile and a joke, but seemingly perpetually exhausted. That day, he was missing part of his head. It was simply gone, leaving a smooth, featureless void where his eye and temple should have been. Yet, he seemed completely unaware, scanning items and chatting with customers as if nothing was wrong.

"Hey, Jack," I said hesitantly when it was my turn, eyebrows furrowed. 

He looked at me with his one remaining eye, his smile as bright as ever. "Hey there! How's it going, bud?"

I stared at the void; my mouth dry. "I’m uh, do you... feel okay?"

He chuckled. "Never better! Just another day, right?"

I nodded, trying to ignore the nausea roiling in my stomach. I paid for my groceries and hurried out of the store, somehow denial already mounting at what I’d just seen.

The barista at the coffee shop was next. I went in for my usual coffee, hoping the familiarity would ground me. As I approached the counter, I noticed something was terribly wrong. The barista, a cheerful young woman named Allison, was missing parts of her hands and arms. The middle, ring, and pinky fingers on both hands were gone, along with matching portions of the hands themselves, and that half of the arms as well. Yet she moved with the same fluid grace, preparing coffee as if nothing were amiss.

"Good morning! What can I get for you today?" she asked, her voice bright and cheerful.

I stared at her, my mind reeling.

She looked at me, glanced down to her hand, and then back up to me with a large smile preading across her face. “Did you notice my new ring?” She asked with gleeful enthusiasm. It must’ve looked like I had, since I had been just staring at her hands. “Dave proposed to me last night! Can you believe it?!”

“Uhh…” Was about all I could manage at that moment.

After a brief pause, she carried on the conversation “Oh but never mind that!” She chirped. “What can I get started for you?”

"Uh, just a latte, please."

"Coming right up!" she said, turning to the espresso machine. I watched in morbid amazement as her fragmented hands worked the machine with practiced ease. She frothed the milk, poured the espresso, and handed me the cup, all without missing a beat.

"Here you go! Enjoy your coffee," she said with a smile.

"Thanks," I muttered, taking the cup. As I left the shop, I glanced back and saw her serving the next customer, her smile unwavering despite the lack of 3 digits, and most of her forearms

Soon, it was my friends. One evening, I called my friend Mark to ask him about theories involving reality. The phone rang endlessly, which was very unlike him. I hung up the phone and went over to his place. When I visited his apartment, I found it unlocked and empty. His belongings were gone, everything, even his tacky 80’s wallpaper he had installed by himself in his kitchen. His neighbors claimed they had never seen him before.

*-George Berkeley*

I noticed it in conversations too. I would be speaking to someone, and mid-sentence, they would just stop talking and walk around me. Their words hung in the air for a moment before dissolving into nothingness. I developed the idea that it was me, and I started to avoid talking to people, afraid that my words would somehow trigger their strange behaviors

One day at work, my colleague Jane was tasked with explaining a project to me. Mid-sentence, she just swirled in upon herself. It took about 3 seconds, and she was gone. I blinked, trying to process the visual emptiness where she had been standing. My other colleagues continued working, oblivious to the fact that Jane had just cosmically imploded.

"Did you see that?" I asked, my voice trembling.

"See what?" my manager replied, not even looking up from his computer.

"Jane. She just..."

He gave me a puzzled look. "Who's Jane?"

One morning, as I walked to the corner store, I felt a strange sensation multiple times. I felt as though I would walk through water at any random moment. It was instant. It would come and go the same moment I would perceive it. The sun shone brightly, and the birds chirped in the trees, but an uneasy feeling settled over me. I couldn’t shake the sense that something was getting worse.

As I approached the store, I saw him. My first bleeder.

He was standing at the entrance, a man in his forties, wearing a plaid shirt and jeans. At first glance, he seemed perfectly normal, but as I drew closer, my stomach twisted in horror.

Most of his head was missing, a gruesome, gaping wound where his face should have been. Blood poured from the wound in a continuous stream, cascading down his neck and soaking his shirt. The sight was horrifying, a macabre fountain of crimson that seemed to defy the laws of nature.

He stood there, oblivious to the blood, chatting casually with a passerby. They were discussing the weather, laughing as if nothing was wrong. The passerby, a woman with a shopping bag, didn’t seem to notice the torrent of blood, nor the fact that she was standing in it.

The man finished his conversation and walked into the store, leaving a trail of blood behind him. Inside, he greeted Jack, the cashier, who smiled and handed him his usual pack of cigarettes. Jack’s void wasn’t hemorrhaging though, it was the same as it was the other day. Blood splattered the counter, but the cashier didn’t react, his hands moving through the crimson mess as if it were air.

I felt bile rise in my throat, the urge to vomit overwhelming. I stumbled backward, my vision blurring. I needed to get away, needed to escape this nightmare.

As I turned to leave, I glanced back one last time. The man was at the register, counting his change, completely oblivious to the blood pouring from his head. The cashier continued to smile, unfazed by the gore.

I fled the store. Outside, people went about their day, chatting, laughing, completely unaware of the man bleeding, maybe to death, inside the store.

Back at my apartment, I locked the door and collapsed onto the couch, my heart still racing. I tried to rationalize what I had seen, but there was no logic, no explanation. The bleeding man, the oblivious people, the world’s growing strangeness—it was all too much.

I started noticing changes in my own reflection. The mirror in my bathroom showed me as I was, but there were moments when my image seemed to flicker, replaced by a distorted version of myself. I would see shadows behind me, dark shapes that shifted and writhed. I would turn around quickly, but nothing was ever there.

Over the following days, I began to notice quickly increasing voids in the world around me. Places that had once been familiar were now replaced by dark, featureless spaces, or smooth expanses that looked like stretched graphic textures. It was as if some visual parts of reality were being consumed by an unseen force, leaving behind pockets of nothingness, though the function of the objects remained. Interacting with these pockets was possible as well, with no notable adverse effects.

One night, as I walked home, I saw an entire block of buildings vanish before my eyes. The streetlights flickered and went out, leaving a gaping void where homes and businesses had once stood. I stood at the edge, staring into the darkness, feeling a profound sense of dread.

It was a few weeks after the wish that I encountered my first Eater. I was walking through the park, trying to clear my mind, when I saw a shadow that seemed too dark, too solid.

At first, I thought it just a trick of the light, but as I approached, the sense of wrongness grew. The entity was not just a shadow; it was an absence, a void where nothing should have been. It moved with an eerie, deliberate grace, consuming everything in its path.

I watched, awestruck, as the entity consumed a tree. The tree didn’t simply disappear; it was as if its visual existence was being devoured, leaving behind an empty space where it had been. The air around the void shimmered slightly, like heat waves rising from the pavement. I could still feel the presence of the tree, the air disturbed by its branches, but it was no longer visible.

The entity continued its slow advance, moving toward a bench where a couple sat, oblivious to the approaching darkness. I wanted to shout, to warn them, but my voice caught in my throat. The words died on my lips as the entity reached them. They too were consumed, their bodies vanishing into the void, leaving only an eerie stillness behind. The thing vanished with the bench, and the people.

I waited and watched, looking for any sign of “the eater”. When I determined that the eater was gone, I ran to the bench, my heart pounding. The space where the couple had been felt strange, as if the air itself was different. I waved my hand through the area, feeling a slight resistance, like moving through water. The couple was still there, in a sense, their matter occupying space in a dimension that was perceivable but not directly observable.

The space felt the same as the “walking through water” sensations I would get as I traversed the town.

>*The same principles which at first view lead to skepticism, pursued to a certain point, bring men back to common sense”*  
*- George Berkeley*

I looked up from the bench and saw, to my dismay, that the Eater had only relocated, and not left as I had hoped. It was approaching a woman and her baby much faster than it had approached the couple on the bench. I couldn’t let myself freeze that time. I owed it Ryan and Olivia. I owed lives to the world and maybe this baby would be a place for me to finally start.

I sprinted down the park trail as fast as I could, screaming and waving my arms for the mother to run. She looked up at me, shocked, but did as I demanded. She turned her stroller away from the eater and ran down the trail. I watched as she quickly gained distance on it, and I began to slow down. The eater had not pursued her.

I felt a small victory had been won, and I stopped running, slowing down about 40 feet away from the eater. That was what I meant to do at least. Instead, as my footsteps heavily slowed as I decelerated, and then I felt a ripple like sensation. It was like losing consciousness for fractions of a second, but several times a second.    
I heard a buzzing static that made it hard to think. My vision pulsed and breathing became a challenge. I didn’t stop where I had meant to. Instead, I was now standing in front of the eater. It was vaguely human in shape, but also wormlike. It writhed in front of me. An absent nothingness but the smell of cinnamon and chlorine overpowered all the other smells.

A hand wriggled free from the eaters side and the slowly reached out to me. The arm made squelching noises as it stretched. I couldn’t move. I don’t know if I was paralyzed with fear, or if the eater had done something to me. Regardless, I stood there as this worm like hand reached out to my forehead. It gently touched my head, and my face. It was sensationless. Anywhere it touched felt a level of numbness that I’d never before experienced.

The moment was oddly serene yet horrifying. It was because of the latter feeling that I shuddered. A small breath, an inhale, and a shiver.

The eater’s arm pulled back into its body in a whip like motion. It grew to twice its size and instantly towered over me. The stomach also then began to stretch and tear. A static like scream became ever louder the more the belly of the eater split. It was maddening. I was left staring into an endless expanse of absolute zero. In my peripheral vision, I was able to see the eater had also gained a shape with apparent mass, and it shown as an unimaginable color that I couldn’t even begin to describe, something I’ve come to learn is rare amongst the eaters.

As the last bit’s of the stomach tore apart, I became rattled by the static screaming as it suddenly increased in volume. The eater loomed over me, screeching furiously. I still couldn’t move. I was stuck. I was staring death in the face, and it knew who I was. It leaned in, placing my head inside the stomach. Total numbness. My skin, muscles, bones, nerves, mind, thoughts, consciousness, and sub consciousness all went completely numb for lack of a better words.

And then I felt an explosive sensation as a hand touched my forearm.

Everything that was happening stopped so suddenly. The gaping maw of the eater, the static scream, the numbness. Everything stopped and I was standing on the park path again.

The woman had came back. The one with the baby. I felt absurdly cognizant, present. I met the gaze of the woman and she gently shook me again.

“Sir, are you ok?” She asked. “I saw you running at me and flailing your arms, so I ran.” She loosened her grip on my arm. “But then you started screaming so loud and I thought you might have been actually trying to get my attention. I’m an EMT, and I can help you if you tell me what’s wrong.” She looked worried. Her crystalline blue eyes shimmered in the brilliance of the sun. I felt at peace with that woman.

I glanced past her, at her baby, and remembered what had just happened to me because there was her child, in the stroller, red faced and screaming, but the sound was being sucked up by the vibrating jaws of the eater, which had just then latched on to the baby’s head.

I screamed, it came from somewhere visceral, it was a feeling of complete disbelief and rage. I lunged on to the back of the creature. It ripped away from the baby and the baby’s cries had sound again. I fell in to, through, with, against, and without the eater. We crashed to the ground and moments before I blacked out, I saw the mother holding her child.

And the child’s head was poring blood.
