You can't choose your family. And sometimes your family chooses something that you can't ever put down. It's about what my grandfather brought back from the war. Not the one in Europe. The one in Korea.

Every summer my brother Thomas and I were shipped off to our grandparents' farm in rural Pennsylvania.  To our parents, it was fresh air and life lessons. To us, it was a prison sentence.  The farm was old, isolated, and our grandfather was a grim, silent man who smelled of soil and stale tobacco. Grandma once told me that he'd come back from the war different. Quieter. Harder. He spent most of his time in the big, red barn at the edge of the property, a place that was strictly off-limits to us.

The rule was absolute. *Never go into the barn.* Not even to fetch a tool. Not even if you heard a noise. Especially if you heard a noise.

Tommy was 2 years younger than me, all scrapped knees and wide-eyed belief in everything you told him. I was a cynical elder sister too cool to hang out with him. And that's what got us a tragedy.  I told him the barn wasn’t for animals. I said Grandpa brought something back in a footlocker, something that whispered to him at night. I said it was a "Jinmen," a creature from a soldier's story that could wear a man’s face like a mask. He'd listen, his eyes huge, a mix of terror and fascination. It was a stupid game, and I was a shitty sister for playing it.

The summer I turned fourteen, everything changed. I was too old for this, too old for Tommy. I spent my days sulking, counting down the minutes until I could go home to my friends and my life. Tommy became quieter, more withdrawn. He'd sit on the porch for hours, just staring at the barn. He started sleepwalking, muttering in his sleep about "the man with the quiet voice." I wrote it off as him being a weird kid. I was too wrapped up in my own teenage angst to see the signs.

When there were two weeks left until the end of the summer holidays, I finally got on my parents' nerves with my whining, and they picked me up earlier. Tommy, on the other hand, had to serve his sentence to the end. 

A day after my return, my parents decided to arrange a small date, and I stayed home alone. I planed to spend the night watching TV and emptying the snack rack in our pantry. At some point, the sound of the show  and the rustle of the chips bag became so loud that I almost missed the phone call. Tommy. His voice was a thin, reedy whisper.

"Ina. Get Mom and Dad. Make them come get me. Now." 

I was annoyed. "Tom, it's the middle of the night. Go back to sleep."

"He’s in the house, Ina," he whispered, the words trembling. "The man from the barn. He’s standing in the hallway. I can see his shadow under my door."

My blood ran cold for a second, but then the irritation came flooding back. Another one of tween dramas. Another one of my stupid stories come back to haunt me. 

"You’re having a nightmare," I snapped, my voice harsher than I intended. "It’s just Grandpa. Or a dream. Go to sleep."

There was a long silence, and then a soft, broken sob. "He’s scratching at the door, Ina. Please."

I told him to stop being a baby. I told him I was hanging up. And I did. I slammed the receiver down and went back to bed, pulling the covers over my head, convincing myself it was just his overactive imagination.

The next morning, Tommy was gone.

His window was open, the screen pushed out from the inside. There were no footprints in the soft earth below, just a single, deep gouge in the dirt, like something heavy had been dragged away.

The police came. The town searched. They dragged the pond and combed the woods. They questioned my grandfather for hours. He just stared past them, his face a granite mask. He had an alibi, they said. He’d been in the barn all night, working. They found nothing. No sign of a struggle. No sign of Tommy. 

The official story was that he'd run away, gotten lost in the woods. They never found a body. To the world, he was just another missing kid. But I knew. I knew what I’d heard in his voice. It wasn't the fear of a nightmare. It was the pure, undiluted terror of something real.

I went back to the farm last week. Grandpa’s been dead a year, and Grandma’s in a home. The place is now my dad's but he doesn't' want to deal with a place where his son disappeared. I’ve been cleaning it out, getting it ready to sell. Today, I finally worked up the courage to go into the barn.

It smelled of old hay, oil, and something else. Something metallic and sweet. In the back, behind a stack of rotting feed sacks, I found his old footlocker. It was unlocked.

Inside, there were no war medals. No old uniforms. Just a stack of my grandfather’s journals. And in the last one, an entry dated the week before Tommy disappeared.

*"It’s getting louder. It doesn’t just want to wear my face anymore. It wants a younger one. It keeps asking for the girl. It says it’s lonely. I can’t hold it off much longer. God forgive me.*"

Beneath the journals, wrapped in an oilcloth, was a mask. It wasn't made of wood or plastic. It was soft, pliable, like tanned leather. And it was stitched together, crudely, from what looked like pieces of other masks. It was a horrifying, patchwork thing.

As I stared at it, a draft swept through the barn, making the old timbers groan. And I heard it. Faint, like a thought that wasn't my own. 

*"Ina."*

It didn't come from the mask. It came from the shadows in the corner of the barn, where the light from the open door doesn't quite reach. It’s getting dark now. I’m sitting in the farmhouse, writing this. And all I can think is that I told him it was a story. I told him it wasn't real.

But it was. And when I turned to leave the barn, I saw it. Just for a second, in the dusty glass of a window pane, reflected behind me. 

A face that wasn't mine. A face that was still learning how to wear its new skin.
