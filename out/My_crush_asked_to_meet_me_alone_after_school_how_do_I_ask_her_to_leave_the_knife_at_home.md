There comes a moment in every young man’s life when he has to stare from the knife in his hand to the boner in his pants and question whether free will can truly exist in a world where an honors student can find himself in this situation and not run away screaming.

“[I think we might have made some bad decisions, Penny](https://old.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/16d9kug/my_crush_asked_to_meet_me_alone_after_school_but/),” I confessed as she stared at me in desperation. 

She wrapped her arms tightly around her ribs and pushed away the first tears. “You *think*?” she demanded, her voice shaking. “He’s nineteen, and thirteen months ago, it felt like-” She rubbed her palms against her eyes. “Do you doubt, even for a second, that I wake up *every single day* wondering what the hell I was thinking when I decided to date him?” Her tears flowed faster than she could wipe them away. “I’m so *stupid!*”

I couldn’t figure out where to put my hands, feet, eyes, or self, so I just sort of shuffled awkwardly in place. I tried to hand the knife back to her, but felt a white-hot pain in my arm when I lifted it, so I pulled it back in shock, figuring the weapon would curse me if I released it early. I tried to mask the sudden hurt.

“No, I understand. It makes perfect sense.”

She wiped her nose and stared at me. “Dating Brent makes perfect sense?”

I nodded. “No. Well – see, that’s what I mean. Sometimes a person can, just – I don’t know - *affect* you so deeply that even if you know what you’re doing is wrong, or stupid, or dangerous, it just makes sense. Because if you give up the thing that makes the concept of reason seem unimportant, what are you really saving? The only certainty is that we’re going to die one day, so there’s no sense in letting go of something that makes living worthwhile.”

Penny allowed half a grin, but didn’t stop crying. “Is that a monologue from some stupid 80s teen movie?”

“Huh?” I grunted. “No – I just kind of said what I was thinking. See, that’s exactly my point. We can be reasonable people who knowingly say and do stupid shit when staring at that one person who can make us forget how the words go.”

Penny looked down and nodded sadly, her raven hair shimmering in the afternoon light. “James, I am so sorry.” Her shoulders slumped. “I know I’m that person for you.”

That was probably the most awkward moment of my life. I remember Jimmy Fischer pissing his pants in the fourth grade and turning redder than I had thought physiologically possible. By the way my face was burning, though, I was pretty sure that I’d surpassed Fischer-red. “I was so careful. How did you find out?” 

Penny shrugged. “I have my ways. To clarify, you remember that you’ve stabbed Brent twice with a supernatural blade, right?”

“Oh, right,” I answered. “So, like – witch stuff?”

She rubbed her arms. “Something like that. I needed someone to would do whatever I said without question, so…”

So that was what made me special to her. Penny had looked me up in a crystal ball or some equivalent fuckery and found a person whom she could use however she needed. I felt like shit.

To her credit, though, she was exactly right about my willingness. “So – how does this thing work? I can stab Brent by putting it in you?” My stomach lurched at my own unexpected phrasing.

She allowed a deep sigh. “That knife will transfer most of the damage to the other party when a strong romantic connection exists. Stabbing me will hurt Brent far worse.” She flashed a fake smile. “So there you have it: I can’t separate feelings of intense attraction and complete terror from the ex-boyfriend whose next beating might be my last.” She threw her arms up into the air. “I guess that’s it, James, isn’t it? You idolize someone until finding out she’s completely fucking insane.”

“Um.” I shuffled some more. “No, you just sound completely fucking human. Brent’s an idiot. I don’t like you any less.”

My breath stopped.

Slowly, I looked down at my arm, heart racing. I poked it, and the white-hot pain immediately returned.

“OW!” Penny screeched from three feet away. 

“Oh, shit,” I breathed. “Okay, Penny, I think I know what we’re going to do about Brent, but you’re not gonna like it.”

I was crouching in the bushes outside a house I’d never seen before, clutching a deadly weapon while peeking through the windows, when I again reflected on the ridiculous things we do when the right person makes us think it’s a good idea at the time.

Pausing made me reflect on my decisions, which was a terrible idea, so I pushed open the window and crawled inside. Most people don’t lock their first-floor windows, and they never stop to consider that fact or double check unless something terrible happens. 

I told myself that I wasn’t going to do this, that I couldn’t intimidate a guy twice my size who had already dragged my name into a serious felony. Denial was the only way I was able to convince myself to walk through his living room and into the kitchen with no idea of what I would find.

Of course I found Brent there, because it was his house and I was looking for him. Solid fear hit me all at once, igniting every nerve in my body as I finally accepted the reality of what I was doing. 

He stared at me with all the fascination of a newborn discovering his fingers for the very first time. 

“The fuck, you shit?”

“Um,” I stammered, “is that a question?”

“Who are you, and why did you brink a fucking knife to my house?”

“Oh,” I looked down at the blade. “Um, stay away from Penny. Forever.”

“No.”

I balked. “Okay, then. Stop hitting her.”

“No. She’s my girl and I can do whatever I want to her.”

I wrinkled my brow. “She stops being your girl if she wants to break up with you.”

He looked very confused. “No she doesn’t.”

I, too, felt confused. I’d never had an argument like this before. “Well – never mind, it’s too complicated – you’re not allowed to hit someone if they don’t want you to hit them, okay?”

“Yes I am. I’ve done it before.”

My jaw hung slack. I gaze him up and down, noticing bandages on his arm and thigh. “Okay,” I explained slowly, “you can’t do it because I have a knife.”

He looked at me like I’d pulled Excalibur from my own rectum as dawning realization came over his face. “James?” Comprehension gave way to fury. He screamed and took an intimidating step toward me.

I instinctively held up the knife. He paused, looked over at the kitchen counter, then grabbed a chef’s knife from a chopping block.

Then Brent charged at me. 

I really, really hoped I was right about the next part of my plan, because I liked not being dead.

“Sorry, Penny,” I whispered, driving the blade into my thigh.

WOWZA did that hurt.

Brent screamed and grabbed the same part of his own thigh. Then he collapsed to the floor and was quiet. 

I pulled my blade out, yelping in agony as I did so. Hopping back once, I examined my injury.

There was almost no blood.

Then I looked back at Brent, now holding my knife aloft, ready for the next attack.

But it didn’t come. In fact, Brent wasn’t moving at all.

Hands shaking, I moved around his body, keeping as much space between him and me that the kitchen would allow. 

He still didn’t move. 

Then, as I drew even with his side, I saw it. He had landed on the chef’s knife, which had slid between his ribs. The entire blade had disappeared into his chest, which was now pooling blood beneath him.

That solid fear now cranked past what I thought a human could experience. My mind spun. 

I reached for my cell phone to call 911. 

Then I realized what was about to happen. If he survived, he would just keep coming after Penny. I’d seen in his face that he would never, ever stop. If he died, and I called it in as the sole survivor and witness, claiming that I’d only broken into his house to intimidate (but not kill) with my knife, it’s possible that the jury would think I was full of shit. The fact that he had already led the cops to my house didn’t make things any better. 

And if he was going to die anyway, what point was there in calling an ambulance?

“Sorry, Brent,” I whispered. “If you’re going to dig your own grave, make sure you’re not standing over a septic tank.”

“The police did interview me, but I just repeated the fact that I didn’t know Brent. They had no proof against me, so his death got filed away as an accident. Everyone in town pretended that he was this amazing guy instead of a complete turd, which is what you’re supposed to do when a turd dies, and we all moved on with our lives.”

“That’s it?” Connor asked. 

“And you expect us to believe your story about magical knives?” Julia added.

I leaned back in the chair and looked back and forth between my two children. “You’ll both be starting high school next year, and your friends are going to start dating. The whole point of my story is that the romantic aspect is far more intense than the magical part of it.”

“Dad,” Julia sighed, “half of our class has already started dating. We know how dramatic it is. And are you really going to just brush past the part where you killed someone?”

“He didn’t kill Brent. Don’t you remember learning about natural selection?” Connor turned from his sister to face me. “So what you’re telling us is that we shouldn’t date anyone at all, because they’re not going to like us back and it’s going to suck?”

“Well,” I shrugged, “the sucking part is just something you’re going to have to go through.”

“Even though we’re going to be rejected,” he clarified.

“Yes.”

Connor stared pensively at the ceiling. “Is it really worth it?”

I shrugged. “That doesn’t matter. You’re going to chase the feeling, no matter how much it hurts. I’m just trying to get you ready for it.”

“This was a really weird talk, Dad,” Julia explained.

“I knew it would be. But I did it anyway.”

They stared at me in exasperation.

“And I’d do it all again,” I explained as Penny walked into the room, her raven hair falling perfectly around her face. She moved behind me and draped her arms around my neck.

“Sofie says her parents are weird, but she’s wrong,” Julia explained to her brother. “Her parents are hippies. Ours are just *weird*.”

Connor looked from her to Penny and me. “So is that it? Can we go now?” 

“Sure,” I answered, kissing Penny’s hand and gently rubbing the scar on her thigh. “Sometimes, you don’t know when a story’s going to end [until you get there](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).”
