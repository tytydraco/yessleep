I was a vampire hunter. I lived by a simple rule: trust no one. But that was before I met her. Her name was Elena. A fellow hunter. My partner. My closest friend. And, I thought, the only one who could ever truly understand me. Together, we were unstoppable. We had taken down dozens of vampires, each kill making us stronger, more precise, more ruthless.

But tonight… tonight was different.

The wind howled outside, the kind of wind that chills you down to your very bones. The moon hung low in the sky, full and heavy, casting long, stretching shadows across the forest as I made my way through the dense trees. Elena had insisted on going after the vampire lord, a creature whose name was whispered in fear across every hunter’s lips. It was our final mission. The one that would solidify us as legends.

We were in his lair now, a desolate mansion forgotten by time, hidden deep within the woods. The air inside was thick with dust, the scent of decay stinging my nostrils. The silence was suffocating, each creak of the floorboards making my heart skip a beat. Elena had been eerily quiet. Too quiet.

“Are you ready?” I asked her, trying to break the tension. My voice echoed through the dark halls.

She didn’t respond immediately, and I glanced over at her. Her eyes glinted in the low light. There was something wrong with them. A darkness that wasn’t there before. But I dismissed it. She was just as ready as I was. She had to be.

We made our way through the mansion, our footsteps slow and deliberate. Every door we passed, every shadow we turned into, felt like a trap. The house seemed alive, watching us, breathing with a life of its own.

Then, the air shifted.

A coldness swept over me, deeper than the chill outside. I felt it in my bones, a creeping dread I couldn’t shake. Elena had stopped in front of an old wooden door, her back to me. She was trembling. But not from fear. From something else.

“Are you okay?” I asked, my voice barely more than a whisper.

She turned slowly, and in the dim light, I saw something that made my blood run cold. Her smile. It wasn’t a smile of reassurance. It was twisted, empty. And in her eyes, I saw something… hungry.

“Elena, what’s going on?” I stepped back, my pulse quickening.

But before I could react, before I could even reach for my weapon, she turned to face the door. A low, guttural laugh escaped her lips.

“I’m sorry, love,” she murmured, barely audible over the wind that howled outside. “But this is where we part ways.”

I didn’t understand at first. My brain couldn’t process what she was saying, what she was doing. It was only when she opened the door — the final door — that I saw it.

The vampire lord. His pale, lifeless face, his eyes glowing like embers in the darkness.

And then, the betrayal hit me. The horrible realization.

Elena had been working with him all along. She wasn’t my partner. She was his.

“You were the perfect bait,” the vampire lord’s voice hissed, his words sharp like the blade of a knife. “And now… you’re mine.”

The world went black.

I woke up in darkness. Not just the absence of light, but a suffocating, oppressive blackness. My skin felt tight, wrong. My senses were heightened — I could hear every rustle of the wind outside, every drop of water hitting the ground, even the heartbeat in my chest… or what used to be my heartbeat.

I gasped and stumbled to my feet, only to find the world spinning around me. My reflection in the cracked mirror beside me showed a face that wasn’t mine — pale, gaunt, eyes glowing an unnatural red.

I wasn’t human anymore. I was like them.

I stumbled toward the window, my fingers trembling as I parted the curtains. The moonlight bathed everything in an eerie glow. The night seemed to hum with a life of its own. And somewhere in the distance, I could hear her — Elena, laughing in the distance. Her voice echoed through the forest like a hollow wind, carrying with it a promise of pain.

I wanted to scream, to shout, to rage at the betrayal. But my throat was dry, and something else… something darker gnawed at the edges of my thoughts. The thirst. The hunger.

I couldn’t resist.

The worst part?

It’s been weeks since that night. And I know now… she’s coming for you.

  


You might think I’m just telling a story. That this is all make-believe. A tragic tale of love, betrayal, and monsters. But if you’re reading this, it’s too late. 

You’ve already been marked.

You’ll meet a vampire by the end of this week. Whether you want to or not. It’s already too late. You’ve read my words. And now, you’re part of the curse.

The night is coming for you. The hunger… it calls to you. It’s already begun.

Tonight, when the moon rises high, step outside. Look at the shadows. Listen carefully. You’ll hear a voice calling your name. It might sound familiar.

It will be Elena’s voice. Tricking you.

And by then, it will be too late.

You’ve been warned.



Don’t look outside after midnight… 

Or else you’ll meet this fate
