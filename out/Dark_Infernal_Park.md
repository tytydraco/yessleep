I woke up. He was lying on the cold floor and couldn't remember anything.

Confused, and with unbearable pain throughout my body, I tried to get up and with a lot of effort I managed to do so. I looked around and I could see that I was in some kind of very large park, with clouds in the sky and intense fog.

I could see a few people I didn't know around me, but they all looked very strange. They were naked, but not only that, they walked slowly like zombies and looked very skinny and pale, almost skeletal.

I heard some people crying here and there and throughout the area there was a very cold wind.

The park was huge, trees everywhere, a variety of children's games and places to sit. I was very confused, I didn't know if I was dreaming or if all this was real.

I began to walk, without apparent direction, seeing the strange people around me. I could notice a few things:

There were people who did not have an arm or leg or there were even some who did not have one of the eyes or neither of them. Others had no ears, feet or fingers. That is to say, almost all of them were missing a part of their body and they all looked sad or upset and seemed to be walking aimlessly. Some were sitting on the playground doing nothing, some were sitting on park seats, some were lying on the ground, and some were just standing like statues staring into nothingness.

As I said, I was sore, tired and didn't remember anything until a guy very different from the others appeared.

This guy looked more "normal" and was dressed in boots, pants and a black leather jacket and underneath the jacket, a t-shirt of the same color from a band he didn't know, he had long, semi-wavy dark brown hair and brown eyes. . In addition, had earrings in her ears, rings on her fingers, and a tattoo of a small wolf face on her neck. He looked very serious, almost angry.

"Hey!" He said with a somewhat deep voice as he approached me. I looked at him strangely while I said:

"Who are you? What's your name? Where am I? What is this? Am I dreaming or something?"

"Easy, easy, ha, it seems like you speak English..." He told me in a somewhat annoyed voice while raising his hands. "My name is Leonard, you're in 'Dark Infernal Park' and, what is this? Well... it's something difficult to explain and no, you're not dreaming. Don't you remember anything like the others when they come for the first time?" here or what?" He said this last question as an accusation.

"Dark Infernal Park? Is that the name of this place?... No, I'm sorry but I don't remember anything, in fact, I don't even remember my nam-"

"Not even your name, right?" He interrupted, as if he knew what he was going to say.

"Well, let's see..." He said, as he took out a notebook and looked at it for a few moments.

"Here it is! Um, well, your name is Erick, it seems... Yes, Erick Williams" He explained.

"Mm, Okay... But I still don't understand why I'm here..." I said, thoughtful.

Leo made a face of annoyance, sighed slowly and heavily and finally explained:

"...Well, come on, I'll take you to the boss."

"Who is 'the boss'?" I answered, somewhat nervous.

"You will see...". Leo responded, with great suspense.

Then, Leo accompanied me and guided me through the entire park in silence. I insist, the park was huge, or rather, "Infinite?" Or something like that? I mean, we walked for miles and there were many areas that were repeated or so it seemed. Lots of people sitting or walking everywhere, one worse than the other. All with skin and flesh torn.

I was very tired but I didn't want to complain and bother Leo more.

After two? Three hours? Walking, we arrive at a different place. It was a huge wooden house, very old style, it looked like it was from a hundred years ago or something like that. We entered the house and walked inside it, downstairs it had a living room, dining room, kitchen, bathroom and some stairs to go to the second floor, but we didn't go up or anything.

We go to a door, open it and go down the stairs. It was a huge, horrible basement with an unpleasant smell.

"We arrived". Leo said calmly.

I was paralyzed. The basement was horrible. On the walls there were blood stains, strange symbols, machetes, knives, hammers and different devices to torture people, as well as on different tables and on the floor. It smelled horrible, plus everything was poorly lit and in the background, in the distance, you could hear a piano piece of music, but in reverse.

I was about to throw up until Leo said:

"There it is, let's go." And he pushed me forward.

Then, I saw it. It was terrible. He was two meters tall, skinny, pale and almost skeletal, he had very long hands and feet, with claws on his fingers, huge shiny black eyes, he had no ears, no nose, or hair. He had a depraved smile with practically yellow teeth and was dressed in a black suit. He was sitting in a large rusty metal chair while watching The Simpsons on a small television on the wall and laughing. His laugh was strange.

"Boss, here it is." Leo said to that thing.

"Ha! Finally." The boss exclaimed. His voice was deep but very melodic or something like that. It also seemed as if several people were talking at the same time.

"Who are you?". I asked, very scared.

"I'm offended by that question hahaha." Cackled. "I am your creator!" He said, very animated.

I couldn't speak, I was very terrified, however, without realizing it, I made a confused face so he responded:

"Don't make that face, friend, I'll explain...". The truth is that I have to say that he was quite friendly or at least that's how he appeared despite his terrifying appearance. He proceeded to explain to me.

"Well... Where do I start? You're here, right? It's because you're dead friend, that's right, weeeeeen dead! Hahaha."

"Wait to?". I asked, very confused. "No no no no, this must be a mistake, I must be dreaming or something, of course I'm not dead! I-" And before finishing my sentence, I felt a very strong blow on my arm.

"Take it easy". Leo said, annoyed.

"Hahaha, don't get worked up. I'm YOUR creator and NO, you're not dreaming. You're DEAD and I want to show you and explain why you're here." He explained the thing and, despite myself, I nodded, letting him continue.

"All the bad people come here, people like you, murderers of all kinds, thieves and rapists, liars and traitors, and all the damn human crap you can think of. Ugh, it makes me sick, to think that I created them." The boss explained, with annoyance. Stuttering, I responded:

"T-t-that's t-to say that I'm-."

"One of them, yes." He interrupted.

I began to vomit, partly because of the nauseating smell and, also, because I couldn't believe that I had been a terrible person in my previous life. I only managed to say:

"What are you?".

"Could you say that I'm a God? Although everyone calls me boss and I'm not immortal either... Haha how stupid, I don't think I should have told you that, so what does it matter."

"So... You created us? And not God or something?" I asked.

"God!". He said exasperated. "Of course not! I don't know where they got this nonsense about God, the devil, heaven and hell, all that doesn't even exist. I created them and they never gave me credit for it." The boss was getting angrier as he went word by word. Continuous:

"What I want to show you is how you got here." Then he clapped once and suddenly we were in a different room...

I was frozen. We were in the room of a house where I could see myself, two other guys and a naked girl of about ten tied on the bed...

"But what the fu-."

"Silence!". The boss interrupted me. I was landing and I didn't understand anything.

"This is one of the crappy things you did." Leo said very angrily as he pushed me.

"Stop fooling around and pay attention, you bastard." The boss growled.

I looked at the scene and could see that "me" and the other two guys were chatting very seriously while the girl was crying. More or less, this was the conversation:

ME: "Okay, we've got it."

MAN "1": "Okay, who starts?"

MAN "2": "I brought her, so I go first."

ME: "Fuck you, I'm in charge here so I'll be first."

MAN "2": "Okay, but I'll record. I already brought the camera."

Then, "man 2" brought a camera and three cigarettes. They started recording saying: "Go ahead" and the version of me started... Abusing the poor, defenseless girl while she screamed loudly and the other two guys burst into loud laughter.

They took turns abusing the girl and mistreated her in different ways that I won't describe because just thinking about it makes me nauseous and terribly repulsed. These abuses lasted for hours.

I begged Leo and the boss to get me out of there. They flatly refused, telling me that I had to remember everything first.

There came a point where I said: "Come on Ashley, let's go." Then, I remembered everything. It was like a bucket of cold water.

Ashley... It was my daughter. When I was alive, I was a potential drug dealer, rapist and murderer along with the other two guys, Carl and John.

I started doing all these fucked up things when I was sixteen or eighteen, when I left home after being abused by my father.

I married a woman (Magda) just as filthy as me and we had a daughter on purpose to use and abuse her. Magda realized that everything we were doing was wrong so I decided to kill her before she said anything.

I died at the age of 45 since they were about to discover everything we did so the three of us committed suicide and that's how I ended up in Dark Infernal Park.

I told all this to the boss and Leo and we finally went back to the basement.

"So you finally remember everything." The boss said, while slowly clapping his hands.

"... Yeah". I replied.

"Alright! Since it's already clear what a damn piece of trash you are, I have to tell you how this place works." He explained. "The day lasts twelve hours as well as the night. During the day, it can be sunny or cloudy with a thick fog like today, it can rain too, during the night the same. Oh, the night. That's the most fun." The boss smiled.

"What happenes at night?" I asked, nervous.

"My other creations, my beautiful terrifying creatures come out to attack. Boo I scare you and I dismember you boo hahaha" The boss said and laughed in a mocking tone. Leo smiled darkly.

"They kill you slowly and painfully so you have to run away or, if you're lucky, hide somewhere. If they kill you, you reappear at the entrance to the park and so on for all eternity." Explicit.

"Boss, it's going to get dark in a little while. How about we take this idiot outside and see if he can survive at least one night?" Leo proposed.

"Great! Take him outside and then come on so we can continue watching this fun show."

Then Leo grabbed me tightly by the arms as he led me outside. I didn't bother to struggle, I was in shock at everything that had happened.

We went outside and it was almost dark. Leo dropped me off at the park and coldly said, "Have fun" as he left. I fell to the floor and started crying.

There were some warm lamps lit in the park and there were fewer people than before.

I was wandering around for a while while I heard screams and cries in the distance until I felt that someone or something was following me.

I looked back and then, I saw it. It was a large skeleton covered in fire and three and a half meters tall, carrying a large, sharp knife in its left hand. He was coming quickly towards me.

Before I could even react, he was already in front of me. I was shocked. The thing pointed the knife at me and in one quick movement stabbed it into my heart. I felt an inexplicable pain and then a deep darkness.

I woke up in the park again, safe and sound. I got up, confused, and looked behind me and there was the skeleton. I started to scream but the figure said in a calm voice: "Calm down. I'm just telling you, the boss can die thanks to the fire."

"Why are you telling me this?" I asked, confused and scared.

"Because I want to kill bad guys twenty-four hours a day." And it was that, the creature vanished. Then, I understood the sign.

I could see other creatures murdering people. A skinny, pale, eyeless thing, a giant rat, a man with a pig's head, a robot that breathes fire from its mouth, a human who looked normal but was a terrible serial killer and a giant spider that spits out small spiders. I died brutally in every encounter I had with that crap, until finally, dawn broke.

It was a sunny day. I walked for hours until I ran into Leo and he said to me in a low but angry voice: "Take this. I want him dead." And he handed me a mysterious little gun. He explained to me that when you shoot it, it can shoot fire. He also wanted the boss dead. Me, I was confused but finally, I made a decision.

Leo took me to the boss's house. He told the latter that I supposedly wanted to talk to him.

"Look who's came back!" The creature exclaimed.

"Die, idiot." I said, and before the thing could react, I pulled out the little gun and shot fire at it and eventually it burst into flames on the ground as it started screaming and cursing at me.

We started laughing loudly with Leo. "Who's in control now, huh?" I yelled.

Finally, the boss died. According to Leo, just by killing the one who ruled all this, I would become the new boss.

Leo showed me a control with three buttons. One said: "DAY", another next to it said: "NIGHT" and below those two, there was one that said: "NIGHT FOREVER". Leo explained to me that with this, the boss controlled the day and the night.

With the previous boss, the bad guys came here after they died and the good guys died and were reborn. Now, with me in charge, the good guys will also come here and soon, I will go to the world where all the humans are, and I will destroy them all with my army of creatures.

But for now, this was how the sun hid forever in Dark Infernal Park.
