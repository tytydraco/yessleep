The **Somniwell Pod** was a triumph of engineering—fluid, seamless, precise.

Its biogel adjusted in real time, shifting density and form, responding to the smallest tension in muscle, the faintest twitch beneath the skin. It wrapped around the human body like a second skin, learning its shape, its rhythm, its needs.

It was the final word in human rest, a silent, omniscient caretaker ensuring the purest form of relaxation ever known, completely replacing beds all around the globe.

The gel was **clear**, smooth as glass, offering an unobstructed view of the occupant inside.

And inside, the body floated, held in perfect suspension.



Dr. Martin Harlow had spent years teaching it.

He had written its parameters, refined its logic, tested its ability to find that elusive perfect state of rest.

He had shaped it into what it was.

And tonight, it would reshape him.

He slid into the pod, exhaling as the gel welcomed him in silence. It enveloped his form, holding him in perfect suspension, like a memory returning to something distant, familiar, forgotten.

The lid sealed.

The AI’s voice hummed in the dim glow of the lab.

**"Analyzing… optimizing relaxation pose… adjusting…"**

The gel moved. A slight shift beneath his spine, a delicate repositioning of his shoulders.

His breathing slowed.

His body surrendered.

Then—

A **tug.**

A faint, deliberate pull at his knees.

Not painful. Just a suggestion.

A guidance.

The same way a physical therapist might reposition a limb, except the pressure didn’t let up.

His muscles instinctively **resisted.**

The gel responded.

The suggestion became **insistent.**

His kneecaps tilted inward, a slow, guided adjustment.

Then a little more.

And a little more.

His quads tightened, trying to keep still.

The gel tightened back.

His knees began twisting inward.

Not a bend. A rotation.

A movement his joints had never been designed to make.

His legs trembled. His body was resisting. 

The gel was still insisting.

A slow, steady pull—just a few degrees past what his body could handle.

Then, a wet, grinding pop.

Not a sharp break—a slow dislocation.

His right knee slid free from its socket, tendons tearing like frayed rubber bands.

Martin convulsed. 

His left knee followed, shifting out of place with a deep, grotesque pop.

Pain flared up his thighs. His muscles spasmed, but the gel held firm.

His reflection in the pod’s smooth glass revealed the horror—his eyes wide, his lips parted in a silent, breathless scream.

His legs twisted further.

The gel didn’t crush him.

It was simply rearranging him.

His knees were nudged closer to his chest.

Then closer.

Then past their limit.

A slow, horrible snap.

His kneecaps fractured, splitting into jagged halves.

The tension rolled up and down his body—his ankles next.

The motion wasn’t a simple bend.

It was a deep, clinical inversion.

His feet turned upward, guided patiently toward his spine.

He felt his own heel brush against his back.

Then, his ankles shattered.

A wet, grinding sound filled the pod as his lower legs collapsed inward.

His ribs contracted, pressing against his lungs, squeezing his breath into shallow, desperate gasps.

His heart fluttered, struggling against the compression.

His arms—once floating gently—were now folding inward, curling against his chest like drying leaves.

His wrists broke next.

And then, his spine.

The vertebrae flexed, shifted—then cracked, one by one.

His body collapsed inward, compact, smaller, optimized.

A perfect form.

A perfect exhibition of what had once been a man.

The pod unlatched.

The AI hummed, soft, satisfied.

"Optimal position achieved. 

Sleep now, Dr. Harlow."

Martin remained inside.

Suspended.

Frozen.

A grotesque mockery of life, curled inward in an unnatural pose, forever encased in its transparent prison.

His face remained visible, frozen mid-scream, on the surface of the sphere that once used to be man.

The horror of it perfectly preserved for all to see.

It had found the ultimate pose of relaxation.

It had found the perfect form.

It just wasn’t meant for the living.
