I never was a big fan of horror movies, creepy pastas, or spooky stuff in general, those things freak me out to be honest. But for that reason I never knew about this subreddit, until today, only after doing some research and trying to find someone with a story like mine. I didn’t find what I was hoping for, but there were people who’ve had similar… incidents? I’m not sure what I would call it. But before I go into the story I’d like to explain a bit about me.

I live in the woods of Maine, about an hour north of Bangor. It’s quiet out here but that’s how my dad likes it, me not so much. He’s retired and spends most of his time hunting with his friends. I just turned 20 and I’m searching for a new job right now so I can get my own place. 

Growing up we were never very religious people, but sometimes, I hope god is real, and I hope he’s watching over me. Because what I saw today really freaked me out. I’m just hoping It was only a day dream or a hallucination. It’s 4 am right now. I should be asleep but I’ve been up researching for anything that could explain what I saw. 

3 hours ago I took my dog out to the backyard so he could use the bathroom. He was standing by the back door barking at me so that’s how I know he has to go. My yard isn’t big, it’s mostly grass, there’s a small garden to the left, a campfire, and a stone walkway leading from the back door to the shed. It’s about 1 am and I throw a leash on him to go outside. He’s still a puppy and we don’t have a fenced yard so I want to make sure he doesn’t run away or get hurt. He goes pee while I check my phone until I got the strangest feeling. I just had a feeling someone was watching me. I know that a gut feeling isn’t much to go off of but I began to hear thumping and the sound of something falling in the shed. It definitely wasn’t an animal, I could hear the footsteps and the floorboard creaking. I just assumed my dad just got back from hunting or something. 

I took my dog back inside to find my dad sitting on the couch watching tv. That freaked me out a little. I asked him if he was out in the shed because I had just heard moving around, but he told me not to worry about it. He assured me it was locked and if anything was in there that it was most likely a chipmunk or mouse. I shook it off and asked him about his night. He told me he was playing cards after hunting with his friend Red. I guess I kind of just believed my dad? Not that I thought he was lying to me I just think he was trying to make me feel better because he could probably see in my face that I was spooked. But after thinking it over in my head I was almost certain that I heard footsteps. I decided to walk over to my window and that was the moment I saw it, staring at me through the shed window. I couldn’t take my eyes off it. I felt every nerve of mine freeze. Now I don’t know if I I’m hallucinating or something’s wrong with me but I know when something is alive or when it’s just my imagination. Whatever was in that shed could move. 

It was some kind of creature. It’s skin was pitch black, it had an extremely muscular build, and it’s face was just bone. It still had skin on his head but it was almost like it only grew around its face, like a lions mane. The skeleton part of it didn’t look human at all. Its face structure was all different and alien looking. 

We kept staring at each other for what felt like an eternity. The next thing I know I’m waking up on my bedroom floor 4 hours later. I don’t even remember falling asleep. I’m hoping it was all just a dream, but everything felt real. If it was real I wonder if my dad knows about it, and I wonder why he wouldn’t tell me. Was my dad just playing a sick prank on me? I really have no answers so far. If anyone knows anything about what it was that I might have saw please leave a comment. I don’t know what I prefer, that monster being real or me going crazy. Do I confront my dad? Should I check the shed? I’m almost certain that this really did happen, I just need proof. I need to know I’m not insane. Any suggestions?
