My sister went to live in a small town in the Pacific Northwest about a year ago. Contact with her ceased 10 hours after she had left town. Her phone would go straight to voicemail and I couldn’t file her as missing, as I hadn’t even gone there to make sure she was okay myself. But when I entered that small sleepy village, I didn’t think I was going to be leaving. 

  
  
The fact is she hadn’t told me specifically what town, but modern technology prevails and before she moved she had forgotten to stop sharing her location with me. At least the location was active for the 10 hours after she had left our shared apartment. The location was a road coursing through the dense pine forests, and the closest town was only a few miles North. It was a start so after a few days of ruminating, worrying and telling myself that she’s fine, she’s an adult, she doesn’t need me to baby her anymore, I caved to the worry and packed my bags. 

  
  
The long drive from our hometown of \*\*\*\*\* in Idaho was adding to my stress, if only speed limits were not a thing. I drove into the town of \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* as night was falling and the dense forests around me began to feel as if they were closing in on me. The town was quiet, and to be honest I couldn’t see anyone. A few signs flashed on and off which presumably meant that despite the deserted streets, people were most likely dwelling inside the diners and bars that were sporadically placed. 

  
  
I pulled into the diner which had the most cars parked in the lot, stepping out of my car and briskly walking to it as it begun raining. The smell of pancakes, cigarettes and coffee hit me as I walked inside the door, along with the warmth that flooded over my cold limbs. The customers sat in their plaid shirts, sipping on their beverages, and looked at me in somewhat disdain. Outsiders I guess. I sat on the corner booth, and the waitress came over to me; a much less disapproving expression on her face thankfully. I ordered a diet coke and a stack of pancakes as after that drive my belly was louder than the chatter in the place. Whispers now, as if I had walked in on some secret group meeting that fronted as a family diner. 

  
  
I tried ringing my sister again, hoping that perhaps it may ring this time. But it didn’t. I ate my pancakes, as I felt eyes on me with each bite. Once I had finished, I paid and left them, hearing the chatter intensify as the door shut behind me. It was 9pm and I had pre-booked a BnB about five minutes up the road. It was a quaint little colonial, with inviting amber light emanating from inside. From the empty parking lot I assumed I was to be the only guest that night, and I pulled my suitcase from my trunk, dragging it across the gravel courtyard.

  
  
As I got to the top of the stairs I realised there was no BnB sign or anything really that indicated that it was a BnB. No vacancy sign, no usual indications of it being a professional establishment. I twisted the doorknob and entered the ‘lobby’ which seemed to lack a reception desk, and very much looked as if I had simply walked into somebodies home. Silence. At this point I was certain I had inputted the wrong address, and seeing as it was a small town the fact that the door was unlocked was not so out of the ordinary. I turned and left, dragging my relatively heavy suitcase down the porch steps and back to my car. Before I managed to open my trunk, an elderly woman's voice came from behind me.

  
  
“Why you leaving dear, come on inside. I have just baked a fresh batch of Snicker doodles.”

  
  
I turned to see the lady, who looked very much like a stereotypical grandmother with her coifed hair and flowery apron. 

  
  
I followed her as she escorted me back through the front door. At this point I was ready to collapse on a soft bed, my eyes were sore and my fingers felt as if they were about to snap from the cold air outside. 

  
  
“I will take you to your room after you’ve tried one of my snickerdoodles,” the lady said as she gestured for me to follow her to the kitchen.

  
  
“This is the \*\*\*\*\* BnB Isn’t it?” I asked as I sat on one of the chairs around the little round table she had in the middle of the kitchen. 

  
  
“Yes of course. Would you like milk with your cookies dear?”

  
  
I ate the complementary cookies as she watched each bite that went into my mouth, before she asked the question that ultimately would lead to the cascade of events that made me never, ever want to visit a small town ever again.

  
  
“Where’s your invitation?” she asked as she tapped her fingers against the table.

  
  
“Invitation?” I asked. “You mean my booking number?”

  
  
“No dear, your invitation to this town. No one comes here without one.”

  
  
“I don’t have one, I only have the booking number for this hotel.”

  
  
When I said this the woman’s homely demeanour soon changed. She looked irritated, angry, and went to the phone that was hanging on the wall. 

  
  
“Who are you calling?”

  
  
She turned back to me with wide eyes, and as I swallowed it felt as if one of those delicious cookies was lodged in my throat. 

  
  
“I don’t know about an invitation, I have my booking number, I paid for the room.”

  
  
The lady didn’t look back to me when I said this and stood with the phone against her ear.

  
  
“There is a young lady here without an invitation,” the woman said. “Yes, no invitation.”

  
  
The woman started tapping her foot on the floor as she grew impatient with whoever was on the other end of the phone. At this point I got up, and backed into the hallway where my suitcase was still sitting by the front door.

  
  
“She’s leaving! What do you want me to do! I cant run after her, I had a damn hip replacement!”

  
  
I at this point, as anyone would do, ran to the front door, and picked my suitcase up as I heard her yelling intelligible things at the phone.

  
  
I ran to my car, shoved the suitcase on the passenger seat, and reversed out of there, as my heart was nearly bursting through my ribcage.

  
  
I drove back the way the diner was, not knowing what I was going to do. I couldn’t just leave here, my sister was somewhere and if this was how the locals were, I sure as hell was going to find her and take her back home.

  
  
But at this point I had nowhere to sleep, and it wasn’t like I could just drive to the next town over, which was hours away. I was sure to have crashed the car in my state of panic and sheer exhaustion. 

  
  
I composed myself as my shaky hands held onto the wheel, and decided that f it. I would have to drive to the nearest town, whatever was going on here, whether I was just paranoid or what, felt very off. 

  
  
But as I came to the road that led out of town, I noticed the orange lights of a roadblock, warping in the rain that started to pelt down harder. 

  
  
I stopped my car and got out to speak to the people standing in front of it, placing cones and signs.

  
  
“I need to leave, is there another way out?” I yelled through the almost deafening sound of the rain.

  
  
“No Miss. you’ll have to get a hotel tonight.”

  
  
“Why is it blocked?”

  
  
“Something on the road. There’s a BnB up the road.”

  
  
I ran back to my car, wiping the rain out of my eyes. What on earth was going on, and one way out? They had to be lying or something. I turned my phone on and of course because of the rain, and impending storm, no signal, no maps.

  
  
I did a U turn, the road had to come out somewhere else up north. The town could not just be a one way in, dead end out. 

  
  
I drove past the BnB, up the main road as my wipers were struggling to keep up with the pouring rain. 

  
  
And thats when I realised that the main road at least was one way in. The road stopped randomly, blocked by pines that lead into a forest. I didn’t want to stop there, to I turned down a road to the right, just praying please please please get me out of here, I’ll come back in the daylight but please tonight just get me out of here.

  
  
The road began to get bumpy. In the distance I could see lights and through the intermittent vision I had of the road, I could see a church. I parked and got out of the car, hoping that the church might offer me some sort of shelter. I ran through the rain as the wind worked against me. I rapped on the old wooden door, yelling for someone to open it, all while looking back at the black void behind my car from where I had come.

  
  
After a few minutes, I heard the clinking of a lock and stepped back. A friendly face of a woman peered through a gap and she looked up at me.

  
  
“How can I help. Its 10Pm.”

  
  
“I have nowhere to stay, and that BnB down the road was not very inviting.”

  
  
“Invitation Hm?”

  
  
“Yes, you know about that?”

  
  
The lady opened the door and gestured for me to enter. The wind howled through the church even when she had shut the door, and there was candles placed throughout.

  
  
“Is the woman ok in that BnB?” I asked the lady.

  
  
“The woman. Miss, you came to the wrong place, and I’m not sure what I can do to help you.”

  
  
“The wrong place?” I asked as I felt completely as if I was about to break down and cry from the fear of what on earth was going on.

  
  
“You can stay here, and I will help you however I can. But it’s me and a few of my friends against that town. I cant promise anything.”
