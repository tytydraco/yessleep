Last weekend, a mysterious object appeared in our living room. And that mystery is why I'm here, today, telling you this so that you be aware. 

It was a Friday afternoon, I'd just walked into the apartment. A big box sat on top of the table. "Uhmmm guys, there's a box here!", I called out to my roommates who are mostly at home during the weekends. Mandy was the first to poke her head from her room "Box? How big is it?", I looked at it trying to estimate its size "Uhmm big enough to fit a computer monitor", she came to see it. And there it was just sitting on the table. Owen walked in from his room, "Whats that?" He asked heading straight for it. 

We were all hurdled around it, asking ourselves how did it even get in here. It looked harmless enough, but something was amiss. The box started pulsating, just a rhythmic thumping like a heart beat. We were stunned, then it stopped "Did anyone else see that?", I asked them and they nodded.

 "Ohh we should open it", Mandy proposed, Owen already reaching for it I grabbed his hand, stopping him in his tracks. "What the fuck?", he raised a brow, "Yea Jay What the fuck" Mandy adding, Honestly my body reacted on its own. I don't even know why I stopped him i tensed up, my hair standing on edge. "I'm sorry, uhmm continue guys". Owen opened the box, I saw the color from his face drain "What. The.", Mandy pushed him aside, "Let me see let me-", she stopped dead in her tracks. I walked towards the box, carefully observing my roommates reactions, what could have possibly made them freeze, the air became heavy. I'll tell you.

I peeked inside the box, "What the fuck?" There was nothing. Just a void of darkness. We stared at the box for what felt like an eternity, surely there was supposed to be color inside this thing. Owen picked it up and turned it, trying to see the back. It was sealed. Yet the blackness inside was unexplainable, the unending abyss staring back at us. Mandy pulls out her phone, illuminating inside the box. The darkness just swallowed the light whole. To our bewilderment it was still dark, the light made no impact or whatsoever. Owen pulled out his phone and added the light from the torch inside the box and it didn't do much. "This is craazyyy guys", he was squinting hard. "I can't make out any detail but darkness inside this thing",I strained my head, looking from every angle and seeing nothing but darkness. We decided to leave it be for the night and headed to our rooms.

I was twisting and turning at night, the mystery behind the darkness inside the box kept poking the corners of my brain. I found myself walking out the room, straight to the box. I heard a loud yelp "Duuude??!!", it was Mandy, I had startled her she was standing near the table just towering above the box. "Couldn't sleep much?" I asked positioning myself next to her, she nodded. Owen was up because the whole room lit up, "Well well well guess we all had the same thought", he was holding rope with a flashlight tied at the end. The plan was for him to drop the flashlight in the box. And he did. Standing at the box we watched the thing pulsate like before, like it was breathing then it stopped. Inviting us with its mysterious aura.

You guessed it, the light didn't make any difference. It was still dark, but we did notice something "Huhh, I'm running out of rope" Owen looked at us, still dropping the rope inside the box. I looked at him like crazy "That's not possible, how. It's a 10 meter rope" I snatched it from his hands, sure enough the rope was still going down. The flashlight hadn't hit the bottom. I started pulling it, at first it was coming out easily I started gritting my teeth. Something was pulling the rope, Owen came behind me and helped pull.

Even Mandy joined, we pulled on the rope grunting with each pull until we tumbled behind. Mandy tapped me on the shoulder and pointed, the rope was pitch black. The flashlight engulfed in darkness, the light completely snuffed. We looked at each other, then back at the rope then back at each other. Owen got the bright idea and put his hand inside the box. "Guys, I'm sure I'm gonna reach the bottom right no-" his body jerked, "Uhmmm guys", he jerked again, trying desperately to pull his hand out of the box, now his whole arm was inside, just below his armpit. Mandy yelled at him "Stop playing Owen", she was frightened, I could tell he also was because he was sweating, my throat became dry. I pulled Owen by his waist, through it all the box didn't budge it remained in place. And he tried pulling himself from the box, something was clamping his arm from inside. After a long struggle we managed to get his arm out.

"We need to get rid of the box", I proposed because everyone else was in shock and no one seemed to know what's happening. I saw Owen shiver. He looked at me with pleading eyes, "Jay", I looked down at the hand that was in the box, my eyes widened in fear. His whole arm was, gone. It was just black pitch black. Mandy cried, I froze, Owen went quiet just quiet stared at his arm. "It doesn't feel like it's there. I'm not feeling my arm Jay" he observed it, stretched it back and forth, I could see the look in his eyes changed from curiosity to amazement. We called it a night, everyone was tired. 

Sleep took forever to come, I kept reliving that moment in my mind. A lot of blanks that were missing from my memories of that moment being filled by mind. Maybe i was imagining things.

Morning came, since I had no class I thought of waking up late. Mandy came sprinting "Jay, Jay you gotta wake up. It's Owen", I dashed to his room. His upper body was now pitch black completely dark matching the interior of the box and his hand. I couldn't see his face, but his feet were kicking and thrashing about. "Owen, hey. Buddy", I was next to him trying to pin point his mouth, using my hands to feel his face, but his legs thrashed harder until he went limp. Just the lower body visible. Mandy was pacing around, mumbling something while biting her nails. I looked down my hand, my skin was dark the tip of my fingers corroded in that darkness. Mandy noticed and screamed. I rushed to the kitchen and pulled out a knife, I wasn't thinking straight I panicked and I cut off my hand, and lost consciousness.
