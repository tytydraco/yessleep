The glow of the laptop illuminated Zora’s face as she clicked through her world in Minecraft. Her favorite mods, the ones that added ores like Endium and mysterious mechanics tied to the internet, made her game unlike anyone else's. She’d been tweaking one particularly strange mod she found in an obscure corner of the internet, one promising "a connection to the unseen layers of reality."

That night, the screen stuttered as she loaded her world. Strange, she thought—it was a single-player game, and her Dell Latitude rarely struggled with Minecraft. She shrugged it off, assuming it was just the mod misbehaving.

Her spawn point seemed... different. The familiar savanna biome she’d built her sprawling base in was gone, replaced by a featureless black void. No sky, no horizon, just endless darkness. Her inventory was empty, her hotbar wiped clean.

"Must be a bug," she muttered, typing /kill to respawn.

Instead of reappearing, her character fell. The falling lasted longer than it should have, the y-coordinate ticking down into impossibly negative numbers.

\-100... -1,000... -10,000...

The screen went dark.

Then came the whispers.

At first, Zora thought it was an audio glitch. The static in her headphones seemed to form vague patterns, almost like words, just on the edge of comprehension. She pulled them off and leaned back—but the whispers didn’t stop.

“Zora…”

She froze.

It wasn’t coming from her headphones. The sound was emanating from her laptop cooler. The faint hum of the cooling fans had been normal earlier, but now it was different. The fans pulsed in sync with the whispers, rising and falling like a labored breath.

Heart pounding, she unplugged the cooler. The whispering ceased, but her screen flared back to life. Her character stood in a cavern now, dimly lit by flickering redstone torches. Symbols carved into the stone walls glowed faintly—symbols she didn’t recognize, yet somehow understood.

She wasn’t alone.

A figure stood at the far end of the cavern. Its skin resembled bedrock, and its eyes were voids—perfect, lightless circles. It didn’t move, but she felt its presence like a pressure on her chest.

Her hands trembled as she pressed Escape. The menu didn’t appear. She tried Alt+F4. Nothing.

"Hello, Zora."

The chatbox popped up on its own, text filling it faster than she could read. A chill ran down her spine as she realized the messages weren’t just on her screen. They were being typed, one by one, on her phone lying nearby.

"Why did you bring me here?"

The figure began to move, gliding closer, its void-eyes boring into her. She mashed her keyboard, trying to close the game, but it was futile.

A final message appeared in the chat.

"You connected me. Now I’m here."

Her Dell Latitude shut off abruptly, the room plunging into darkness. The whispers returned, louder this time, surrounding her like a swarm of invisible bees.

She grabbed her phone, desperate to call someone—anyone—but the screen displayed only one thing:

A to-do list:

1. Bring it more.

2. Dig deeper.

3. Let it out.

When the power came back hours later, her computer was gone, replaced by a smooth slab of polished black stone. The glow of the USB lights on her laptop cooler resumed, faint and steady, as if watching her.

And in the shadows of her room, something with void-like eyes began to stir.
