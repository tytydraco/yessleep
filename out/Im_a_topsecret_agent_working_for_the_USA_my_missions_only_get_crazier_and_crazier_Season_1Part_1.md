Hello all, my name is Gage Smith. I am a top-secret agent that works for the United States Government. Due to my exceptional field prowess, I am equipped with a weapon of my choice. My weapon is a pair of 2 silenced pistols that fire at the rate of an enhanced P90. On this side of the tracks, the benefits outweigh the risks by 10 fold. 

In the beginning, I was just a regular CIA agent. But eventually, my skill, importance, and a bit of favoritism by some friends at the high places got me to the top. Overtime, the missions got crazier and crazier. Just like the last mission I was assigned to.

It all began when some new illegal drugs and a snitch made their way to the office. I was shipped out before the drug could be fully tested but I was told that they were steroids on steroids. 

The snitch in question told me he worked for the distributors and gave me the coordinates for their operation. 

A day later, I’m on a shabby fishing boat 300 miles off the north Icelandic coast. On the horizon, the captain told me that we were headed for an oil rig. As we approached, we were blindsided by a massive spotlight shining in our faces. After my eyes adjusted, I saw a massive BATTLESHIP blocking the boats path. I knew that it wasn’t an Icelandic one because the guy shouting on top didn’t have an accent. Before the ship could pull away, I latched on the side of the ships hull with my ice pick. 

I watched as the bright lights of the oil rig in the distance get brighter and brighter as the ship pulled in underneath the oil rig. Not a moment later and I was scaling the dark side of the pillars that held up the oil rig. 

When I reached the deck, I climbed a few staircases and some ladders that led me to an unfinished deck above the main square of the oil rig. I looked down and saw almost every worker on the oil rig listen to a man in a sweeping black trench coat and fedora talk about the production of their new drug. He then began an explanation of top-secret agents known over the world for their field prowess. He then got to me, he told everyone that I was threat number one and that I could indeed be in the oil rig right now. As he finished his statement, a sudden stoplight flickered on that revealed my shadow to the audience below. 

A brief moment of silence followed before it was broken by gunfire erupting toward me from below. I quickly bolted out of there as I could hear the rumbling of footsteps from all directions. I turned a corner and saw 2 men with AK’s charging toward me. Before they could react, I mowed them down with my pistols and continued running. As I ran over a bridge, I was shot at from all directions. I began to return fire and take out 2 assailants before continuing this game of cat and mouse.

I continue running before I was halted by an absolutely massive man who stepped out from a door and knocked me over onto the ground. He looked to be 7’7 and over 350 pounds but I couldn’t waste time, even on him. Before he could bludgeon me with the metal pipe he had in his hand, I ducked under his legs and ran down a couple more corridors with the grunts still on my tail. That was until I reached a hallway that was different. It was full of holding cells that the mentally insane would be confined to. Almost every cell door had been knocked off its hinges or had been swung open. I continued down the corridor when a was shook by the shockwave if something big behind me. I turned around to see someone who was even bigger than the last guy punch a hole straight through the concrete wall. The last guy was big but this guy was something different. He was maybe about 8’3 and looked well over 500 pounds. The shock sent me to the floor as I looked up at the behemoth in front of me. He then suddenly reached out his hand for me to grab. As he wrapped my hand in his big sweaty palms he told me that he thought I was one of “them”. His voice seemed impossibly light for one of his size. Not another moment passed whenever I see the big guy from earlier started yelling at us down the hallway followed by almost what I assumed as 100 grunts behind him.

I watched as the guys face contorted to unimaginable rage.The big guy from earlier sent all 100 grunts who were armed with a plethora of melee weapons to charge my new ally. I blinked my eyes to see the same guy charge all 100 grunts running back style. As he plowed through each and every grunt, their bones cracked and broke as the fleshy behemoth ran them over like a semi-truck. When he reached the big guy from earlier, the new guy punched this man in the face to hard that his head exploded on impact. 

Before I could take in what just happened, the guy got launched backward and landed right on top of me. Down the hall I could see the same person who was giving a speech to all of the grunts from earlier. All I heard him say was…”Oh #812, it appears I will have to discipline you again”.
