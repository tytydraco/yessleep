So, this happened around 1 month ago. I and my friend... let's call him Andrew, so we were on our way to some place Andrew wanted to show me. I was not quite sure if I would like this place, cuz the previous place Andrew took me to, I... um... I didn't quite like it. I just hoped this place was good.

So Andrew is my best friend. We are more like brothers. We too are pretty much the same, just that he is a little more healthier than me. We met 2 years ago, and our friendship was quite unexpected for both is us. Anyway, back to the story, we liked to go cycling together. We didn't usually have a destination in mind. We would just roam around until we found a spot we liked, and that spot would become our base for the next few weeks. We would just abandon the previous base once we found a better spot. A few days back, we had a spot which we called "Wammy's House," which I still don't know why. Gradually we lost interest in that place and wanted a new base, and Andrew is like a roamer, so he found a place, and now wanted to show it to me. So basically we had online school due to the Covid-19 pandemic as the schools were closed. So the online teaching started in the morning and ended at 3 in the afternoon. We completed the study and in the evening, he came over to my place and we headed for the new place he had found.

"Bruh, this better be a good place, cuz I don't want my efforts to get wasted. Plus, I really want a place where I can lie down and relax, just looking at the sky." I said.

"You are sure to love this place. This is just like our first base, that river, but just that this one is even better."

"I hope so..."

And it really was a super cool place.

He took me through a lot of twisted roads and we finally ended up at a really nice river. It had large rocks at the shore, where we could sit and relax, while looking at the water. The place was so calm, silent and peaceful, I almost felt I would fall asleep there any moment. It was really nice.

"Man... this place... it's frickin' awesome!" I exclaimed.

"Told ya."

We spent the evening there, looking at the water and talking about stuff. It really was awesome. When the sun set and it was dark, we left for our homes. It was certain. This place was our new base.

We started going to the river really often now. Almost daily. We would go there, sit, lie down, talk about stuff, and then come back. I really loved the place.

Then, one day, another common friend of ours, let's call him Tim, he came over to my place. He is another best friend. So we watched Death Note for a while, and then Andrew came over. We played something for sometime and then decided to take Tim to the river. So we grabbed our bicycles and rushed to the river.

Today, it was even more awesome. The water had backed away a little, giving us more place to sit and walk. Yet, the the further part of water was still super deep, but we didn't care. We just hopped from one rock to the other and reached the furthermost rock where we lay down and talked.

I had brought my phone too, so we started playing some music and it felt super awesome. Then we started walking in the shallow part of the water, and soon we found weird things. Like broken earphones from someone, a broken phone case, and such other stuff. So we decided we would try to find something valuable. After sometime, Andrew yelled, "Hey Ray (me)! I think you dropped your ring over there!" I still had my ring in my finger, so I told him to quit it, but he said he saw a ring over somewhere in the water. He then pointed a place between 2 rocks under the water and I and Tim went over there to see what it was.

[The place Andrew pointed out](https://preview.redd.it/5pu3x507oz171.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=516406d2985677d401f928270ce0df3753cc8bd8)

Though not mine, there really was a ring in the water. I picked it up and looked at it. It looked ancient. It was made of some metal I didn't really know, and it had weird designs on its sides. It also had a blue gem sort of thing at the top.

There was something about this ring. I felt super awesome looking at it. And I wanted to try it out. So I quickly wore the ring in my index finger. Andrew and Tim backed off a little and Andrew said, "Bruh are you out of your mind? You shouldn't wear such things. I mean, we don't know where it came from. It might be cursed."

I started laughing. "Bruh you seriously think this is cursed or something? Dang it man! I am taking this ring with me!" I said, laughing.

"Ray, I think Andrew is right... I mean, not cursed, but I don't think you should take this ring." said Tim.

"C'mon now. You too? I am taking this ring. That's final." I said, putting the ring in my pocket. They both shrugged it off and we continued chilling out on the rocks. Then when the sun set, we went back home. I slept in a different room, so I was alone in my room at night. I looked at the ring once before sleeping. For some reason, I was attracted to the ring. I couldn't stop looking at the ring. That was when I started feeling uneasy. The dim light in my room made things even worse. I was feeling negative. I kept the ring away in my drawer. I felt a little better now. Something told me it was because of that ring, but I didn't seem to want to believe it. I really wanted to keep that ring. I kept thinking about the ring and soon fell asleep.

*I was on the same spot where I had found the ring, just this time I was alone. No Andrew, no Tim. I felt strange. I was alone, but I felt like someone was watching me. I looked down and saw the ring in the water, and picked it up. Something went through me, tearing me up and I fell in the water, dead.*

.

.

*Man that was scary!* I said to myself as I woke up with a start. I checked the clock and it was 3:42 AM. I still had a few hours to sleep. I curled up inside my blanket and slowly started drifting off to sleep, until I noticed the little weight on my index finger. I turned on the lights and I saw the ring.

*What in the frickin' world?!* I thought. I was scared. I had put the ring inside the drawer. Then how was it here in my hand? I kept thinking, and drifted off to sleep after putting that ring in the drawer again.

I woke up next morning, again to find the ring in my hand. I was starting to get freaked out now, so after having a bath, I messaged Sam, who was another one of my best friends. He lived a little away from me, Andrew, and Tim, so we only met at school. Tim didn't know Sam as Tim was in a different school than ours.

"Bruh Sam"

"Yeah sup?"

I explained everything to him and sent him pictures of the ring.

"Bro, if what you just told me is true, I think this ring of yours is possessed." replied Sam.

"Oh c'mon now... you too?" I said, even though I knew what he was saying might be the truth.

"Yeah. According to what you told me, it looks like this ring is some sort of possessed object."

"I will just throw it away then..." and just as I sent this, my drawer shot open, and the electricity went out. I was alone in the house, as my parents were out for work and my sister was out of station. I was terrified. This ring was definitely dangerous. I wanted to run away, but I couldn't. Something held my body back, and the next second, I fainted.

.

I woke up to find my mom sitting besides my bed. My whole body was paining, and I had a fever. I was pretty goddamn sure that this was because of the ring. Mom explained me everything. She opened the door lock with her duplicate key and found me on the floor. My condition was not very serious, but I wasn't feeling well, and mom was worried. I still hadn't told them about the ring. And I didn't want to. I was afraid they would not believe me. But then what could I do?

I grabbed my phone and found a ton of messages from Sam. I suddenly stopped chatting so he thought I died or something.

"Hey Sam" I messaged.

"So finally you are here... came back from heaven?"

"C'mon I wasn't dead."

"Anyway what happened to you?"

Then I explained everything to him.

"Bruh I don't think you should keep this ring for too long."

"Yeah me too... Ima throw it away."

"No don't. Like you mentioned, whenever you kept it in the drawer, it came back to your hand, right?"

"Yeah so what? Tell me fast. I am scared."

"Go back to where you found it and keep it there itself. Maybe it may stop following you."

"Yeah maybe that will work. But I am not in a condition to even get up from the bed."

"Tell Andrew. He will help."

And so I messaged Andrew and he was like, "HOLY CRAP! I WAS JUST KIDDING BOUT THE CURSED THING! IT ACTUALLY IS CURSED?!"

And so next day Andrew came over. I showed him the ring. He kept staring at it. Then we talked a little, and then he left with the ring. Little did I know that it was the last time I was gonna see him.

Next morning, I woke up. To my horror, I found the ring in my hand. I was scared out of my wits. I shouldn't have had taken it. I should've listened to Andrew and Tim. But what horrified me the most was what came next. I called Andrew to tell him what had happened, but his mom picked up the phone. She was crying. I asked her what the matter was and she told me that Andrew had an accident. A truck hit him on the road the day before and he..... **DIED ON THE SPOT.**

"WTF" I said and ended the call. I couldn't believe it. Andrew. My best friend. The one who always supported me and helped me in everything. He was no longer alive. He... was dead. And all because of this damn ring. I wished I never had picked it up. Andrew wouldn't have died. None of this would've happened. It was all my fault.

I looked at the ring in my hand. Somehow I felt like it stared back at me.
