*Trigger warning: Harm & mental illness*

Have you seen the stone man? If so, please forgive me.

He lurks in dark places. You might not even notice him at first. He camouflages himself to weasel his way into your life. That was how Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder slithered its way into every nook and cranny of my mind. It was unobtrusive at first.

Just don’t let him into your head. Don’t let him see your fear. Once the creature wraps its frail fingers around you, its strength multiplies.

It quickly transforms into a terrifying entity that is near-impossible to remove.

That was a figurative speech which I used to give about my disorder. Since the events of Aaron Colt’s island, however, it has become a very *literal* warning.

These past six months, I’ve hardly been able to sleep. Though my disorder is gone, that doesn’t mean it’s *gone*. When it left my body, it didn’t leave this world. I’ve seen and heard things. He’s out there.

Before I discuss the present, I suppose I should finish discussing the past.

After I escaped the clutches of the supernatural statue in my room, I stood in the pitch-black corridor and trembled.

“Darryl?”

The sudden sound of a voice startled me, but I twisted my head to the left and felt an immense sense of relief. It was Letitia.

“I think Aaron did something terrible to us,” I breathlessly told her.

Letitia nodded at me with tear-filled eyes. She silently beckoned me to follow her back to her room. Barefooted, wearing nothing but pyjamas, we tiptoed down the corridor. I clenched my entire body in petrified preparation for what lay behind her door.

Her door was wide open, and her bedside light was illuminating a sickening spectacle of horror. The walls of her room were alive, and they were *watching* us. Two peeled strips of wallpaper served as the room’s eyes. The decor undulated, reminding me of the spider-like creatures beneath my duvet.

“Do you see that?” She tentatively asked. “Or is it in my head?”

“I see it,” I whispered, shaking.

Letitia looked at me with eyes huger than those of the wallpaper demon. It was a soul-broken stare.

“Nobody’s ever seen what I’ve seen before…” Letitia cried. “The walls were swallowing me, and I barely broke free. But it was real. It wasn’t just in my head. What’s happening?”

“Aaron Colt did exactly what he said he was going to do,” I said. “He cured us.”

I gently closed the door on the terrifying wallpaper eyes that were gazing into my very soul.

There was a sudden crashing sound from Ryan’s room. Letitia sprinted down the corridor, and I struggled to keep up.

When she opened his door, she screamed. “No… Ryan…”

I darted down the darkened hallway and peered over Letitia’s shoulder to see what fresh hell awaited. I wish I’d asked her to close the door. I wish I hadn’t seen what lay inside.

In Ryan’s personal torture chamber, the wood of his four-poster bed had developed a life of its own. It had unfurled into a noose and hanged the man. His limp, lifeless body swung to and fro. He had bloodless skin, whiter than the flesh of my stone man, and his mouth was agape in a horrifyingly-eternal scream. We were witnessing the expression that he had worn as his demon murdered him. His face still haunts my dreams.

Emma’s door suddenly flung open, and the woman came crawling into the corridor. Her nightgown was coated in claw-shaped scratches, and she was bawling loudly. With one of her bare, bloodied feet, she kicked her bedroom door shut.

“What the fuck is happening?” She cried, looking at us.

I would love to tell you that the three of us banded together, ran for our lives, and retreated to safety. We certainly tried.

“We have to check that Nathaniel’s okay,” I found myself saying, despite my survival instincts saying otherwise.

“I’m sorry… I can’t…” Emma sobbed.

She fled, sprinting down the stairs of Aaron’s expansive mansion. Only Letitia and I remained on the second floor. No sign of any staff members. Not a sound from another living person. Letitia silently nodded at me, and I regretted suggesting my courageous trip to save Nathaniel.

Climbing the creaky staircase to the third and final floor, I had the most dreadful premonition. I already knew that we weren’t going to find Nathaniel in one piece, but I couldn’t have predicted what horrors we would uncover.

Entering a wooden door at the top of the staircase, we discovered that the entire third floor was a converted attic space. Most of the floor was littered with dusty books and stacked cardboard boxes. Letitia and I manoeuvred through the spaghetti maze of junk stacks. I glanced at the titles of some of Aaron’s books. The mysterious man had an entire library up there. *Veilbreaking*, *Non-Science,* and *Little Faeries* were three titles that stuck in my head. Bizarre titles. A glimpse into the manner of man that lived in that malevolent mansion, I suppose.

There was a booming clatter from the far side of the enormous attic.

“Nathaniel?” Letitia cried.

No answer. Not in words, anyway. The sound of rustling boxes and toppling items begged investigation. That being said, I didn’t like it. Not one bit. I’d tried to save Ryan. My gut had told me to run towards him. With Nathaniel, my gut was telling me to run away.

“Aaron lied to you,” A voice boomed.

Near the staircase, a door slammed.

“He’s locked us in here,” I whispered to Letitia.

“What are you talking about? We would’ve seen him if he’d slipped past us,” Letitia replied, but her trembling voice revealed her uncertainty.

“Aaron told you that I had borderline-personality disorder,” Nathaniel giggled, his voice bouncing off the sloped ceiling. “But that isn’t my mental condition. Do you want to know what’s wrong with me?”

Letitia and I had stopped walking. We looked at one another with terror in our eyes, no longer wanting to find Nathaniel. That voice was haunting. We turned around and started to weave back through the boxes, hoping to find the door unlocked.

“My psychiatric diagnosis is antisocial-personality disorder,” Nathaniel explained in a guttural voice. “In layman’s terms, some call me a psychopath.”

His horrible laughter echoed around the room.

“I killed the shell. Now I’m *free*. Finally free of that weak, fleshy, meat-sack,” The voice hissed.

A scuttling sound from the ceiling stopped us in our tracks. I shone the phone torch above me, but I couldn’t see anything. I knew I’d heard something above us, though. And I definitely heard a quiet thud somewhere amongst the carnage of Aaron’s attic.

“He’s boxing us in here,” I whispered to Letitia.

“Stop it,” She pleaded. “You’re scaring me.”

“You should be scared,” Nathaniel whispered.

I cast the phone light onto the stack of boxes before us and caught a glimpse of a horrific monstrosity. It was Nathaniel. The same gangly, gloomy gentleman I’d first seen on that dock, but much taller. He rose far above the stacked boxes. His flesh had mutated into a dripping black slime, and his bloodshot eyes glistened in the darkness.

The creature that had separated itself from Nathaniel contorted its body into a thin, twisting spiral, gliding towards us between the boxes.

“Run!” I screamed at Letitia.

She didn’t need to be told twice. We dashed around the cardboard column, dodging Nathaniel’s demonic grip. I heard that scuttling sound above us again.

“Go!” I screeched.

Letitia reached the door before me and flung it open. She started to sprint down the staircase, and I followed. A terrifying snarl erupted from behind me as I closed the door on the sludge face of the killer thing that had been flushed out of Nathaniel’s body.

I was barely halfway down the stairs when the door opened, but I kept my eyes ahead. Letitia and I hurled ourselves downstairs, plunging into the lobby area — the *burning* lobby area. A fire had already engulfed the ground floor, and it was crawling up the stairs. I can only assume a member of staff set the place alight. Maybe Aaron himself.

As Letitia and I ran across the scorched lobby, I could feel Nathaniel on my tail. I was certainly he would pull me into the flames. But he didn’t. I don’t know what to tell you. All I know is that Letitia and I scarcely made it out of the mansion in one piece. And I’m certain Nathaniel didn’t. I heard the most piercingly sharp cry of pain behind me.

After exiting the house and gathering on the grass with Letitia and a few members of staff, I eyeballed the inferno before me. No monstrosities fled the building in pursuit of us, so I keep telling myself that they didn’t make it out alive. It’s the only way I can sleep at night.

A member of staff contacted the coast guard, and the relevant authorities were notified. When the ferry arrived to pick us up, the police commenced their investigation. Nobody ever found Emma. Aaron was nowhere to be seen. He had abandoned his island home. Had he known things would go so horribly wrong? Was that all part of his cruel plan?

Nobody ever talked about what they saw on the island. I didn’t even see anything about it on the news. The investigation was never publicly announced. Perhaps the police officers saw something that they wished they could un-see.

I understand that there are many loose ends, but I can only tell you as much as I know. In spite of the horror I suffered in the past, I can’t stop thinking about the present. I’ve been collecting information from people who’ve seen the stone man.

He comes for those with fear in their hearts. He latches onto that fear, and he doesn’t let go. He has rules. Arbitrary rules. To refuse his demands comes with dire and unthinkable consequences.

Don’t let the stone man inside your head. Once you do, he won’t want to leave.
