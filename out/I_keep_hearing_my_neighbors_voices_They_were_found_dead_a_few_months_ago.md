My name is Max Caldwell. I'm 17 and I live in New Orleans. This is part one of a series of entries I wrote before...well, just read it.

I live in a small neighborhood next to the bayou. Everyone knows eachother. My mom hosts barbecues for the neighborhood. Every month.

Last month we had 17 guests. The previous month there were more, but Mr and Mrs Jones don't go anymore. They're dead. They were found in the bayou with their throats torn open. My little sister found them when she was looking for frogs along the banks. Poor Masie. The sheriff said it was probably an attack by Big Bruce, the largest and most elusive gator in the bayou. Here's the thing though. Big Bruce was old and slow. He was missing teeth and he was covered in algae. You could swim around him and he just chills. My neighbors would often throw him scraps of meat. There's no way it was him. He's never attacked before. Still, the sherrif shot and killed him, sadly. My mom says it must have been one of the smaller gators. 

After school I went down to the bayou. Honestly I half expected to find another body but what I found was strange. On the bank were 3 gator carcasses. Their throats were ripped open. Even though it stunk I got closer. Flies were skittering around their cloudy wet eyes. You never really look something dead in the eyes. Anyway, I dragged one of the bodies onto the grass. I got rotting meat on my hands. The smell still won't come out of my clothes. Guess I'll have to burn them. I looked closer at the gator's neck. The gash on the gator's throat looked to be made by a bite. Not a gator bite, it isn't consistent to other bites I've seen on smaller gators. These toothmarks were from flat teeth, big ones. What creature would be able to do that? What animal has that kind of mouth? It looks like a human bite, but its too big, too uneven. Maybe a undiscovered species of ape? I don't know, but I hope it's just an animal. 

Well, today I found more gator bodies with the same gashes. 10 more, to be exact. Weird thing is, right now I can hear a chorus of gator voices but I don't see their eyes while I shine my light into the water. I think it's coming from further into the bayou. But we don't have many gators in my stretch of the bayou, and now that so many are dead, how could there be so many calling? It isn't even mating season for them so it doesn't make sense that they're making so much noise. 

I'm not so sure it was a gator now. I keep hearing the voices of Mr and Mrs Jones. It comes from deep within the bayou at night. I thought that maybe I was hearing things from the grief. Mr and Mrs Jones were family friends ever since I was a baby, after all. Masie keeps telling me there's a monster in the bayou. I was dismissive at first, but after my other neighbor Francine was found with her throat ripped open in the bayou last night I'm starting to believe Masie might be right.

I heard Francine in the bayou. It sounded just like her. I don't know if I'm the only one who hears those voices but I know it isn't her. I know that she and the Jones couple are dead. I still hear them. As I'm typing this outside I can hear Francine's voice. I'm going inside. The voice is getting louder. I'm going to journal in my notes app until I figure out what's going on. It's getting harder to sleep the longer I think about it. Well, goodnight I guess. 

There's an ongoing investigation outside my house. Police tape and everything. There's like 10 cops and a forensics team. There's a news van along with a cameraman and reporters. Even a group of divers is going into the bayou waters. I tried asking what's going on, but they are just interviewing Masie. Be back soon. 

They ended up interviewing me, my mom, and Masie. I can tell it stressed mom out. Masie told them there was a monster in the bayou. I, on the other hand, couldn't bring myself to tell them about the gator corpses with those strange bites. They think it's a serial killer. The police interrogated Mr Grant. He has a criminal record of robbery, and word around the street is he has a history of abusing women. Last time I checked however, his mouth isn't that big.
