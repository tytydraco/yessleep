My name is Howard Hill (named after a famous archer who my father wanted to be, and my mother wanted to be with), and until just recently, I worked as a homicide detective in Manhattan, New York. This is the story of my final case.

There was nothing special about that first night, or at least, there shouldn’t have been. I sat at my desk, watching a recording of the game from earlier that night on my small desk TV.

My Partner, Detective Margarette Rosas, sat across from the desk from me, finishing up on the last of our paperwork from our most recent case.

Rookie Detective Ji-ho Yoon hurried over with fresh cups of stale black coffee for all 3 of us in a rush to not miss the next play of the game.

That was right before Detective Wilson Rodgers waddled in, however, a portly middle-aged white man with a puffy red face and a bad attitude, holding a brown box under one arm and a clipboard and pen in his other hand. “Package for you, Hill,” he said.

“From whom?” I asked, straightening up in my chair.

“Some fucking bike courier punk, I don’t know,” Rodgers bellowed out, and I could tell that he was not willing to cross the treacherous distance of the several feet between us to deliver it to me on his bum leg that had landed him on permanent desk duty. “Says he needs you to sign for it.”

I got to my feet, old knees creaking and aching from years in the Army and two decades of police foot chases. I made my way over to him then and cautiously reached out for the small brown box he held out to me.

“Don’t worry,” he said. “I already opened it up and checked out the bitch’s insides. There’s nothing but a VHS tape in there.”

“Thanks,” I replied, signing my name hastily to the paper on the clipboard and taking the box from him. It had been unceremoniously carved open using a pair of Rodger’s desk scissors, a habit he had of doing even when it was some nice box with a present inside for one of the other Officers.

“VHS tape?” Detective Yoon chimed in. “Who the hell uses VHS tapes anymore?”

I pulled open the carved-up flaps of the box to reveal a single VHS tape inside just as Rodgers had said, the only other thing within the box being the post it note stuck to the front of the tape. *Watch me, Detective Hill,* was all it read.

“Rookie,” I said, turning back to face him. “Go down to storage and grab one of the old VHS players from down there.”

“Sure thing,” Yoon responded attentively, quickly making his way out of the room.

I made my way back to my desk and plopped down in my rickety old chair, pulling the tape from the box before setting it aside on my desk. I then pulled the post it note from the front of the tape and set it aside as well.

“What do you think it is?” Rosas asked, looking up from her paperwork.

“I don’t know,” I responded. “Probably just some fucking prank. I wasn’t expecting anything, and it’s not like I have any fans or female callers out looking to send me presents.”

Margarette smirked at that, the creased lines of her aging yet still beautiful face being accentuated by the act.

“Rodgers,” I called out just before the big man could make his way out of the bull pen and back to the front desk.

“Yes,” he responded in an irritated huff, slightly turning back to cast a glance at me from over his shoulder.

“Hold that bike courier for a minute,” I instructed. “Explain to him that he’s not in any trouble but just keep him from leaving until we see what’s on this tape.”

“Will do,” Rodgers grunted before angrily pushing through the door and shutting it hard behind him.

Rosas chuckled. “That man hates his life,” she said.

“Yeah,” I agreed. “I doubt he imagined being a heavy-set divorced alcoholic with a bum leg working as a glorified receptionist when he dreamed of becoming a police officer as a boy.”

Rosas clearly felt some empathy at that.

“He wasn’t always this way,” I added, giving the man a pass for his bad attitude.

Detective Yoon made his way back then with a VHS player and its subsequent cables in hand and I quickly plugged it in to the power strip of my desk, plugged the AV cables into my TV, and changed the input.

Rosas and Yoon then positioned themselves standing behind my desk chair to watch the tape with me as I inserted it into the VHS player and hit play.

Static crackled across the screen briefly before a black and white home video tape began playing, accompanied by the sounds of heavy breathing, and muffled fear. A scrawny man stood there, holding a pair of garden shears in his right hand. He wore nothing but a pair of loose-fitting white underwear and a mask, his mostly naked body littered with scars.

The mask appeared homemade, crudely stitched together with three different faces revolving around it that you could make out as he moved around the space before the camera. One face resembled a creepy looking nun, another an enraged and screaming chimp. The third face, the one currently covering the man’s own, resembled a devious-looking fantasy goblin or something of the like.

The heavy breathing appeared to be coming from the masked man, the sounds of muffled fear being revealed to be coming from the man he had strapped to the bed before him as he stepped aside to reveal his victim.

The man strapped to the bed was similarly scrawny, with a crooked and beaked nose face that strangely resembled that of the goblin mask, but he was completely naked, with his limbs tied off to the bed’s frame and his mouth gagged. He was shaking about in terror, muffling through his gag as his masked assailant crawled onto the bed with him, increasing his level of terror and output of muffled screams.

The events that played out next aren’t for the faint of heart, and although I have already put ample warning before the start of the story about its graphic nature, I will warn anyone reading this once again, don’t read further if you’re not prepared to handle what comes next.

Without trying to go into too perverse of a description, but also wanting you to understand the truth about what was depicted on the tape, I will just say that the masked man then began inserting the opened garden shears into the rectum of his screaming and thrashing victim, working them in and out as he cut up towards his crotch, waves of blood flowing out from him to drench the comforter of the bed he was strapped down to, vomit spraying out of his mouth from behind his gag.

He continued this vile act until he had made his way through his victim’s genitals and then pulled the shears out from him.

The victim was now clearly in shock from the pain, blood loss, and sheer terror of the situation, his violent thrashings turning into random jolts and shakes as his eyes rolled back into his head, and he began drowning on his own vomit.

The masked assailant then made his way around the bed, and used the shears to slit his victim’s throat, nearly down to his spine. Afterwards, when his victim was no longer capable of speech, he removed his gag.

Several moments passed as the murderer looked over his handiwork and his victim bled out, as well as drowned on his own blood. The masked murderer’s heavy breathing grew more rapid and excited as his hands shook from the adrenaline dump, and then he made his way back to the camera, shutting it off. That is where the tape ended and turned to static, needing to be rewound in order to be watched again.

“Jesus Christ,” Yoon said with disgust. “Did we just watch a fucking snuff film? Was that real?”

Detective Rosas was already making her way back around my desk, heading for reception to interrogate the bike courier, her right hand now cautiously resting upon the holster of her sidearm.

I immediately got up to follow her, though I moved a bit slower than the still athletic woman.

“Should I call Captain Bradley?” Yoon asked.

“No use,” I responded without turning back. “He won’t pick up this late. This one’s on us.”

I made my way into reception a few moments after Rosas and she was already questioning the now scared and confused looking bike courier, a young Asian man perhaps a few years younger than Detective Yoon.

Rodgers was making his way out behind reception to offer her backup, having now realized something serious was going down, and I quickly positioned myself behind Rosas just before Yoon followed me in.

The courier informed us that he worked for a package delivery service through an app on his phone. He showed us everything and it all seemed to check out. The instructions from his app were to pick up the package placed outside a specific apartment door, deliver it here, and to make sure that it was handed to me personally, and that I signed for it to confirm delivery.

He shared the address of the apartment with us, which was just 3-4 miles from our station, and we immediately called it in to dispatch to be investigated.

Rodgers locked the courier up in a holding cell for now, all of us assuring him that he’d be released very soon, and then Rosas, Yoon, and myself piled into my old Lincoln and headed for the address the courier had given us, hearing the resounding police sirens as we drew near.

Heading into the seedy apartment complex and following our fellow officers up to the fourth-floor room, we pushed our way inside. The smell of the apartment hit us all at once, the smell of death, rot, and decay, and I knew immediately that whatever had died in there, had died some time ago.

The apartment was littered with Chinese take-out containers, porn magazines, empty bottles of lotion, and used tissues that we steered clear of. A Meth pipe, crystal residue, an ashtray full of cigarette butts, and empty alcohol containers lined the kitchen counter. Yet more porn in the form of DVDs sat stacked next to an older TV and a DVD player in the far-right corner of the apartment, which we would later learn were of the child variety, and much of the place seemed to be wrecked and broken, as if some sort of violent struggle had occurred within.

Finally, we stumbled upon the crime scene we were actually there for, spotting the naked, decaying, and mutilated man strapped down to his own bed, having expired some days before.

Everyone quickly got to work, cordoning off the crime scene, tagging evidence, dusting for prints, and collecting DNA. We learned over the course of the next few days that the crime had taken place approximately six days prior to us receiving the tape. No DNA or prints had been recovered from the scene as of yet besides that of the victim himself, if you could really call a sick man like that a victim.

Upon learning who rented the apartment and confirming that it was indeed the same man who had been murdered there, we learned that he was a felon by the name of Orson Greenwell, a convicted child molester who spent 20 years behind bars for cases of molesting the children of the clients of his gardening and lawn care business for years.

With the discovery of this information, a long since repressed memory surfaced in my mind. I knew this monster. I was the one who arrested him when I was still just a beat cop, personally escorted him to jail in my cruiser, and testified against him in a court of law. Whoever his killer was, knew that. The tape had been sent to me personally for a reason.

Three busy nights after we received the tape, I made my way back to my studio apartment for a promised and much needed night of rest at home and a day off after. I greeted Hank as I made my way inside, the old fellow slowly padding towards me on his arthritic legs, bushy tail weakly swaying behind him as he huffed in excitement.

“Hey, my good boy,” I said as I rubbed my fingers through his graying and thick, gold and black fur, a huge clump of it shedding off with my touch. He was an 11-year-old German Shepherd, an old boy in the twilight of his life.

He originally belonged to one of my old partners, a K9 officer. He was unfortunately killed in the line of duty, leaving Hank behind to be retired out. My partner’s family couldn’t take him, feeling bad about that fact, but informing me that Hank would be a constant reminder of what they had lost and why. I understood where they were coming from, and adopted Hank myself, to give him a peaceful last few years in comfortable living with someone he knew and trusted.

I could tell right away that I reminded Hank of his old partner and best friend, and the older he got, the more I would sometimes think he even believed me to be Joseph at times in the confusion of his aging brain.

“Come on, Boy,” I said, carrying the Thai food I held in my hand over to my desk and sitting down in my comfy leather chair behind it. I turned on my desk lamp and opened the Thai containers before pouring myself a scotch.

Hank slowly followed along behind me, plopping down into the specific dog bed I had for him beside my desk. He picked up a barely chewed on bone that lay there in his jaws and then gently laid his head across my lap.

I gently and intermittently stroked his head as I took bites of my food and sips from my glass of scotch for several minutes, and then my apartment buzzer went off.

I got up then to go see who it was and what they wanted. “Hello?” I prompted at the voice box beside my apartment door.

“I need a drink, open up,” Margarette’s voice answered me.

I buzzed her up and within a minute she was making her way into my apartment.

Hank slowly and painfully rose from his bed to come see her, tail once again wagging.

“Hey, Hanky boy,” Margarette called out to him with the excited and lighter toned voice most people tend to put on when talking to animals and children, petting his head as he approached her.

I grabbed a clean glass and pulled over a chair from the kitchen so that she could sit at my desk with me and then plopped back down into my huge chair with an exhausted groan, allowing myself to sink down into it.

She sat down next to me, grabbing up the bottle of Johnny Walker Red and pouring herself a hefty drink.

Hank plopped down into his bed at our side, beginning to gently chew away at his bone now in relative peace and comfort.

Margarette held her glass out to me, and I picked up my own, clinking it into hers. “Here’s to another thrilling Manhattan police investigation,” she joked before taking a big swig of her scotch.

“I don’t want to talk about that,” I responded before taking a hefty swig from my own glass.

“Yeah,” she said, sucking scotch from her teeth. “Me either.”

Silence passed for a time as we sipped down scotch and took turns petting Hank while he chewed on his bone. Margarette broke said silence after some time, however, snatching up a piece of chicken from my food, plopping it into her mouth, chewing it down, and then sucking her fingers clean after.

“Listen, Howard,” she said. “I need to tell you something.”

“Yeah,” I responded with a sigh. “I figured this talk would be coming up sometime soon.” I fully expected this to be the obligatory, “Look, this thing between us, it was fun while it lasted, but it’s gone on for as long as it can.”, type of conversation that always one day comes up when you get involved with a fellow officer.

I was proven wrong though as she eyed me in confusion and then averted her gaze down to her swirling drink. “I’m going to see this case through with you guys to the end, but then it’s going to be my last. Captain Bradley already knows, and Yoon will take over as your partner after I’m gone. He’s a smart and capable young Detective who has a lot to learn from you. I know you’ll make a good pair.”

“What?” I sat up in my chair, completely caught off guard by this news. She had never expressed to me before any desire to leave the job. “What are you talking about? Where are you going?”

“I’m closer to 50 now than 40,” she began explaining. “I’ve put in my time. I’m retiring and moving to Hawaii.”

“What’s in Hawaii?” I laughed, not fully taking her seriously yet.

“My sister,” she responded. “Her kids. Her two grandbabies.” Her expression grew even more solemn, and she started rubbing her fingers firmly across her forehead, still adverting her gaze down to her glass of scotch. “Listen, I can’t do it anymore, this shit. Child predators, murderers, torturers, and mutilators. I used to be able to, to square it, keep it separate, compartmentalized. But the older I get, the more it’s getting to me, the nightmares, the intrusive thoughts of what if that were my nieces and nephews on those DVDs. I need to get out while I still have my sanity intact, while I can still live a peaceful life of retirement. I’ve been divorced for over twenty years now, never remarried, never had kids of my own. I have a shit ton in savings, and the pension plus social security once I’m old enough to collect it should be more than enough for me to live the rest of my life on. There’s no reason for me to be here anymore, putting myself through this. It’s time to get out while the getting’s still good, you know?” She finally looked back up to meet my gaze.

I nodded in understanding, slumping back down into my chair. “I do,” I said. “But fuck, I didn’t expect this.”

“Maybe you should start considering retirement, too,” she added with a smirk. “You did what? 8 years in the Army? A decade as a beat cop? And another decade as a homicide Detective? You’ve more than put in your time, and you’re even closer to 50 than I am, you know? Plus, you were never married, never had any kids, and I’ve seen how cheap and frugal you are with your money. I bet you have even more just sitting around in savings than I do. So why not?”

That made me laugh again. “What the hell would I do in retirement except for sitting around driving myself crazy thinking about all the murderers that were getting away because Manhattan didn’t have me, the greatest detective there ever was,” I joked. “Here to catch them?”

“What would you do? You could come with me,” she said, seeming genuinely hopeful at the suggestion. “You could drink daiquiris and pina colodas on the beach all day, finally get a tan. You could get massages on the beach from pretty young Hawaiian girls in leis and flower bras. And most importantly,” she sat her drink down on my desk, stood up, stepped toward me, and straddled me in my chair. “You could do me. Everyday, or at least, until little Howard stops working in your old age.” She smiled broadly and seductively, pointing down with a chuckle.

I smiled back at her, leaning closer into her and placing my hands on her hips. I leaned in to kiss her, and at first, she leaned in as well, but then, at the last second, she pulled back to meet my gaze again.

“So?” she asked. “What do you think?”

The brief dream of us living our days out together in paradise faded from my mind then and took my smile with it.

Her smile faded then, too.

“I’m sorry,” I said. “I can’t.” All I’d known my whole life was being the guard that stood between the evils of this world and the innocents. My mind had already reached that point of no return she just spoke about long ago, and deep down, she knew that.

Her eyes watered as her straightened lips curved down into a frown. “I know,” she responded.

“But I’ll miss you,” I said honestly.

“I’m not leaving yet,” she composed herself, leaning in and wrapping me up in a hug. “You better come visit,” she said, her face now pressed into the scruffy side of my neck.

“I will,” I responded. “I promise.”

She pulled back then and shoved her lips into mine hard, overwhelmed by emotion, and that kissing soon led us into my bed.

I awoke the next morning to my cell phone’s continuous blaring, immediately noting Margarette’s naked body beside me, still fast asleep. “Hello?” I said as I picked it up, groggy, my eyes struggling to stay even halfway open.

“Sorry if I woke you, Detective,” Yoon’s voice answered back through the phone. “But Captain Bradley needs you down at the station right away.”

“Why? What is it?” I asked before anger flared up in my voice. “This is my first day off in weeks, you know?”

“I know. I’m sorry, Sir,” Yoon responded meekly. “But it’s just…” He trailed off for a few moments before finding the right words for what he had to say. “Another package came for you. There’s another tape.”
