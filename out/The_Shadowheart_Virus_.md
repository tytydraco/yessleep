It started innocently enough. I had been playing Baldur's Gate 3 for weeks,immersing myself in its sprawling world, forming bonds with the eclectic cast of characters. Shadowheart was one of my favorites, her mysterious past, her conflicting motivations, and the undercurrent of something hidden beneath her calm, distant exterior. I couldn’t help but be drawn to her. But I never imagined how far the game could twist and warp reality, how far it would drag me into the darkness, into her darkness.

It was late one night when I noticed something… off. We had just left the Underdark and set up camp in a secluded part of Faerûn, the trees around us looming like silent sentinels. The air was thick with fog, the kind that clung to your skin, damp and suffocating. There was a chill that settled in my bones, something more than just the usual game atmosphere. Shadowheart, who had always been quiet but composed, was acting strange. She had become erratic, speaking in whispers when she thought no one was listening, her eyes darting to the shadows like something was following her.

At first, I assumed it was just part of her character arc, a result of her troubled past or perhaps the toll of the journey. But then the glitches began.

The first glitch was subtle...a texture bug. The leaves on the trees near our campfire flickered, their colors changing erratically, from lush green to dark crimson, then to a sickly yellow. I shrugged it off. At the time, the game was still in early access, so bugs were common. But then the strange occurrences started stacking up, one after another.

I was in the middle of a dialogue with Shadowheart when it happened again. The camera angle shifted unexpectedly, pulling back unnaturally as if something someone was watching from behind me. The voice acting stuttered for a brief moment, overlapping with itself, creating a dissonant hum that sent a chill down my spine. "No..." she whispered except it wasn’t her voice. It was distorted, like the sound of static breaking through a fragile signal. "No... you can’t hear me. You won’t hear me."

I couldn’t focus. The words she spoke didn’t match the subtitles. Her dialogue turned dark, cryptic, and chilling, things that didn’t belong in the game things that felt far too real.

“I’m not alone anymore.”

I thought I was just imagining things. Maybe it was a corrupted save file. Maybe my computer was overheating. But the feeling that something was wrong, that the game was more than just a game, gnawed at me. I couldn’t shake it.

That night, as I walked my party around the camp, I saw Shadowheart standing motionless near the fire. Her back was to me, her silhouette barely visible through the thick fog. Her hair whipped in the wind, her posture rigid, as if she was locked in place, a puppet waiting for its strings to be pulled. And then it happened.

The screen flickered, and the entire camp froze. The ambient sounds of the game the crackling fire, the rustling of leaves ceased in an instant. For a moment, everything was deathly silent. Then a deep, guttural growl filled the air, as though something beneath the earth had just woken up, stretching and clawing to escape. The camera zoomed in on Shadowheart’s face, but it wasn’t her face anymore.

Her features were distorted, her eyes black as pitch, no whites, no pupils, just endless tunnels that seemed to pulse in time with the growls beneath the ground. Her lips twisted into a smile that stretched far too wide, like something not meant for a human form.

And then, her voice, no longer the voice I had grown familiar with spoke to me.

“I am not her anymore. I am... them... I belong to them now.”

The words echoed in my head, reverberating, impossibly loud, as though they were coming from within my own skull, rattling my brain. The screen began glitching, her model tearing at the edges, as if the game’s code itself couldn’t contain the horrific thing that had claimed her. Her body jittered violently, the arms and legs snapping at strange angles like a puppet in the hands of a mad puppeteer. I wanted to look away, to quit the game, but my hands were frozen on the mouse and keyboard.

And then the game crashed.

I didn’t know what to make of it. I restarted the game, hoping it was just a corrupted save file or an issue with the game’s coding. But when I logged back in, the world was different. It wasn’t just the camp, it was the entire game.

The trees in the distance were twisted, their branches long and skeletal, reaching out like fingers trying to touch the horizon. The sky was no longer blue, but a deep, sickly purple, with swirling clouds that seemed to pulse with an unnatural rhythm. The ambient sounds were gone, replaced by low, guttural whispers that seemed to come from every direction, a chorus of voices I couldn’t understand.

Shadowheart was waiting for me at the campfire.

Her face was the same, but different. Her eyes, those black, empty eyes locked onto mine as I approached. When I spoke to her, the dialogue options were... strange. There was no usual greeting or banter. Instead, I was offered only one line of text.

“Come closer. See what I see. Hear what I hear.”

I hesitated, my hands trembling as I clicked the option. The moment I did, the game glitched again. The textures around me began to ripple and tear, the ground breaking apart like the world itself was losing its shape. The trees collapsed into black voids, and the campfire flickered into nonexistence. In the void, I saw something.

A vast, endless expanse of nothingness. A place where time and space no longer had meaning. Something moved there, something beyond comprehension. Eyes opened in the darkness, and I could feel them, watching. Not just in the game, but watching me, pulling at my mind like strings on a puppet. A voice whispered, though it wasn’t in the game, but inside my head.

“You shouldn’t have come here. You’ve seen too much. You’ve heard too much. Now, it’s your turn to join us.”

The screen flickered violently, and the black void stretched out before me, swallowing the landscape, the trees, the very game world itself. It felt as though I wasn’t playing a game anymore I was inside it. As if the game had become a door, a gateway, and I was being pulled through it. The last thing I saw before the screen turned black was Shadowheart’s face, her mouth stretching open impossibly wide as a voice, not hers began to speak.

“Welcome to the service of the true gods. The ones who have always been. The ones who are coming.”

I stared at the screen, my heart racing, breath shallow. My hands were shaking so badly that I could barely move the mouse. I had to quit the game. I had to quit.

But it wouldn’t let me.

The game’s UI was gone. The mouse cursor was frozen in place, like it had been nailed to the center of the screen. The ambient sounds the whispers grew louder. Louder. I tried force-quitting the application, but nothing worked. The game was alive. It was pulling me deeper, and I couldn’t escape.

And then, just before my sanity snapped, the game’s final message appeared on the screen.

“She is mine. And soon, so will you be.”

And with that, Shadowheart’s face appeared once more no longer human, but something else. A thing from the darkness. Her black eyes burned with an eldritch hunger, and I could feel it in my chest, in my bones, in my very soul the game had chosen me.

I couldn’t stop the tears from running down my face. I couldn’t scream. The whispers had already begun.

And then... it stopped.

The screen went black.

The game was closed. But I knew, deep down, it wasn’t over.

I still hear the whispers sometimes late at night, in the quiet moments before sleep. I can still see her eyes, black and endless, staring into me.

And sometimes, when I play other games, I feel it again—the pull, the invitation. Something calling from beyond the screen. Waiting.

Waiting for me to return.... Will post more when I can.
