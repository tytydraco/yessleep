I haven't thought about this for a long time, but recently, whatever we summoned, has found me. As I type this, I can hear tapping on my windows, and that godawful voice. 

It started years ago. I was a normal young woman, a job waiting for me on the horizon. When it happened. I found a pamphlet in my mail. The pamphlet itself didn't automatically cause me concern. It looked like a normal religious flyer. But the thing that stuck out was the phrase. "Do you crave everything your heart desires? Ralex can help you" 

"Ralex?" I whispered, confused but curious, and kept reading. 

"Our community noticed you, yes you Danielle." My eyebrow rose, "how do they know my name?" I thought to myself. My eyes widen as they land on the next sentence. 

"This was a distraction, welcome to the cult of Ralex" 

Then, everything went dark. 

--------------------

When I woke up, I immediately noticed that I was tied to a chair, and someone had changed my clothes, now I was wearing a long white dress. I look around, noticing I'm not the only one in the room. There are other girls in chairs, all wearing long white dresses. The dresses are the only thing that we share. Because i can see females from different nationalities. In fact, a noise that caught my attention, finally sinks in, it's this Asian women sitting across from me. I can't understand what she's saying, it's sounds Korean. But I can tell she's scared. I'm scared now too, that genuine look of fear in the Korean womens eyes just clinching the fear. 

"Welcome ladies! To the cult of Ralex!" A deep voice booms, making me and the other women look around, but we can't find the source of the voice. 

"Your probably wondering why your here" the voice continues. "Well I'll explain, in the  past, you females were only seen as one thing, childbarers and wife's" the voice rants. "But our cult sees that women have the most remarkable power, they can carry a human in their bodies for nine months, then bare the pain of giving birth to that human. We found that ability gives the female race an amazing power, you and you alone, can hold the soul of our savior, the great Ralex!" 

The voice proclaims. Making other voices pipe up with stuff like "Ralex be praised!" And "all hail Ralex!" The praises probably would have gone on longer, if the deep voice didn't boom out "Silence!" Once the voices calmed, the voice continued. "Now, you all have a job to do" as the voice says this, people in robes appear out of nowhere, two approach this fire pit in the middle of the ring of chairs, then they light a roaring fire. The voice continues.

 "You all have one chance, pick out from your personal items, the one that means the most to you, then throw it in the fire." As the voice says that, more robed figures appear, each holding a bag. One approaches me, unties me, then holds the bag out to me. I take it. Inside I see that apparently these guys ransacked my room.i see the other females also going through their bags. I decide the best course of action is too find that item. I search the bag. I see two options immediately, both items means a lot to me. The first is a necklace, a simple beautiful thing with a purple eye hanging from it. The second, a picture. It's of me and my boyfriend. I lost him, so this picture means the world. My eyes well with tears. I decide on the picture, even though the necklace would have held more.

 I hold the picture, waiting to see if the voice comes back. It does, but not in a way I expect. The voice laughs, then addresses me directly. "Confused Danielle? Don't wait! Just throw it in" right as I was about to do this, something occurs to me, see the necklace was from my mother, she said it was a protective talisman, she always said "that purple eye can see things mommy can't, so it'll protect you when I can't." Thinking about this, I palm the necklace, hiding it by holding it against my leg. Then threw the picture in the fire. 

I see the other women are doing the same, except for the Korean women, she's sobbing, clutching a picture and lock of hair. Her sobs getting the attention of me and the other girls. She starts pleading in broken English. "please don't make me! Please! Picture is only one I have of my daughter! She gone! Please! Don't make me!" My eyes well up with tears of sympathy for the poor woman, another woman gasps, and starts angrily ranting in swedish. I can only make out one English sentence from the swedish women, which is "you monsters!" 

Again the booming voice shouts "SILENCE!" which makes the swedish woman immediately shut up, my tears spill over. The voice calms, sounding charismatic again. "Everyone has to do it, Ralex needs a peice of you" The voice explains. "We can't do what we need if you don't throw that item in the fire" from some reason, this breaks the Korean woman, she reaches into her bag, pulls out a gun, and aims it at her head, taking fire. The gunshot rings out, and me and others gasp and look away. The voice sighs. "Remove the body" it instructs the robed figures still in the room. They approach and drag the women's body out of the room. After a moment of silence, thd voice comes back. "Now, we will be placing you in this field, there, you will be controlled, you don't have a choice, your bodies will be borrowed by our members." The voice explains, the swedish woman pipes up. "And what if we don't?" She spits out, clearly still angry at the cult. The voice chuckles darkly and a TV is rolled into the room. "You will after this." Is all the voice says, before one of the cult members presses play. 

I don't remember what I saw, but it did something to me, i wasnt the same. Suddenly it felt like I wasn't the only soul possessing my body. It's gets vague after this, brief glimpses of darkness, a van, and us being driven away. Once I become more aware again, clearly the guy possessing me is having a hard time controlling my mind, because I'm still there. I see we are in a field, and we are alone, it's destered as far as I can see. I sense me and females are in danger, but I can't tell where the danger is coming from. 

The outspoke swedish woman looks at me, then the others, then speaks. "Follow me." She says blankly, her eyes void of life and emotions. I can tell it isn't her speaking, but the cult member using her body. We do follow, again pulled by the unseen force of the cult. I look at this woman next to me, she has dark hair and green eyes. She looks at me, smiles warily, and keeps walking. Another one reaches out and plays with my hair. "I love your hair." She says, as blankly as the swedish girl did. My hair is long and light blonde, almost white. I find myself answering before I can stop it. "Thank you." My stomach inwardly drops.  'thats not my voice' is the only thing I can think. 

Once we are further into the field, the swedish girl stops, then looks at us. "Stand in a circle and hold hands." She directs, we do it, waiting for the next instruction. She nods. "Repeat after me" she says, then begins chanting. I don't know the language, it sounds Latin, but the soul in me repeats the words flawlessly. 

The day, one second sunny and bright, the next becomes dark, a cloud forming in the sky above us, we continue the chant. Suddenly i feel and see a lightning bolt hit me, making me and the others girls start screaming. I feel myself lifts a foot off the ground, looking around to see that I'm not the only one affected. The whole group of us are now being levitated off the ground. But something I see makes a pit of fear well in my stomach. 

Their eyes 
Are white. 

No pupils, no irises, just white. And whatever is in me, gives me an out of body view of myself, to show that my eyes are also pure white. Then, I hear a voice in my head. A creaky, deep, demonic sounding voice, it laughs. "Hmm what a beautiful group my followers brought me" it rasps. My soul itself wants to run at this point. The voice feels wrong and evil. But, something about what it says next, causes me to break from my trance. "This is only the beginning." It creaks. "My darling girls we will rule the world" my trance breaks and I drop to the ground. I notice I'm the only one who broke the trance. The other women still in the air, eyes still pure white. I heard that godawful voice cackling in my head as i run. I run as fast as I can. 

It feels like hours before I finally find a road, a car coming. I start waving frantically to get the drivers attention. Which works. The female behind the wheel worries over me, asking if I need the cops or the hospital. But all I want to do is go home. So I tell her my address. And we head there. 

Over the next few years, I repressed the memories, I just want things to go back to normal. And I thought it did. 

That was until recently. I found a paper in my mailbox, the only thing on it was the words. "You can run but you can't hide Danielle. It's coming for you" my blood runs cold, and ever since I got that note, there have been tapping sounds at my window.
