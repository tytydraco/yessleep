On a chilly autumn night, my wife, Rose, and I pulled into the gas station down the road from our house. Our tires crunched on the gravel as we parked, and the dim glow of the station's lights cast eerie shadows on the pavement. We had just finished work, exhausted and eager to get home.
As we stepped out of our car, a stranger emerged from the darkness, his features obscured by the dim lighting. He approached us with a request that I immediately declined – he wanted a ride to town. It was late at night, and I wasn't going to give a stranger a 30-minute ride into town. No, thank you.

After browsing the gas station's rather unimpressive selection of snacks, Rose and I eventually decided on the snacks we wanted and checked out.
When we left the gas station, I noticed the stranger was gone. He must have asked one of the many truck drivers for a ride to town, and one of them was actually going that way, so they said yes.
We were about 2 minutes away from the gas station when car headlights appeared in our rearview mirror. The driver, clearly intoxicated, swerved recklessly, flashing their high beams and tailgating us relentlessly. Panic set in, and I made a snap decision not to lead this driver to where I live. So, I made an abrupt right turn onto a back road in a desperate attempt to lose them.
We eventually shook them off our trail and managed to arrive home almost 45 minutes later. Even though it was now almost 2 am, we just felt relieved to have evaded our relentless pursuer.

We locked the doors, feeling a semblance of safety. However, our peace was short-lived. In the dead of night, our ring doorbell began to chime incessantly. I opened my phone to check the live feed, but the screen showed nothing but darkness.  Probably an animal or a bug flying by setting off. I locked my phone and laid back down, hoping to put the strange night behind me.

But the next few nights weren't exactly normal. Rose and I started to have a few arguments here and there, with her accusing me of leaving the freezer open and misplacing things. Now, I know what you're thinking – she's probably right, and I do have a history of being forgetful, losing things, and not closing the freezer all the way. But I've been very careful lately. After a heated fight about me leaving the freezer open for the second night in a row, I needed some fresh air, so I took our dog Fido out to go potty.
Fido was a creature of habit, so you can understand my confusion when he froze dead in his tracks as we were walking into the backyard. Puzzled, I turned around and walked Fido back to the front yard, where he reluctantly relieved himself. He always refused to go in the front yard. I'm assuming he caught the scent of a bigger animal or something.
This continued for a few more days, with Fido refusing his routine and only going pee and poop in the front yard.

About a week later, Rose and I found ourselves back at the same gas station, craving late-night snacks once again. That's when I saw it – the same car that had pursued us relentlessly last week was parked in the lot. My blood ran cold as I recognized it.
Anger consumed me as I entered the gas station and approached the only person in there besides the cashier "Do you think tailgating someone and trying to run them off the road is funny?" I exploded at the man.
His confusion was palpable for a split second until he glanced outside the gas station window at my vehicle that Rose was anxiously waiting in, his face turning ghostly pale.
"You've got it all wrong," he stammered. "I was trying to get your attention because there was a man in the back of your car. I was sure I was going to see you on the news the next night if I didn't do anything about it. But obviously, I was wrong because you're still here."
