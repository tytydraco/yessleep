They say cave diving is like floating in space — weightless, dark, and silent. I disagree.

In space, there are stars. In the caves beneath the sea, there’s nothing but stone and pressure. You don’t float down here. You crawl. You breathe slow and careful. You pray your line doesn’t snap.

I’d been diving for almost an hour when I found it — a narrow slit in the rock, just wide enough for me to squeeze through. It wasn’t on any map. My gut told me to leave it alone. But curiosity has a way of swallowing common sense.

I wriggled through, scraping my tank against the walls, until the tunnel widened into a chamber.

And not just any chamber — **a perfect sphere**. The walls were unnaturally smooth, almost polished, and the water inside felt heavier somehow, colder. It didn’t feel like a natural formation. It felt... emptied.

In the center of the cavern stood a door.

Just a door. Upright. No frame. No hinges. No surrounding wall.  
It shouldn’t have been there.

I floated closer, my light sweeping over it. The wood was dark, old but intact. No rot. No seaweed. It didn’t even sway in the currents. It looked... dry.

I circled it twice, checking behind it. There was nothing but more stone. Solid rock.

I don’t know how long I stared. Every instinct told me to leave.

I turned to go.

And then I heard it.

**Knock. Knock.**

Two sharp raps, loud enough to rattle inside my helmet.

I whipped around, heart hammering. The door stood still.

A voice followed. Faint. Garbled by the water.

**"Hello?"**

It was human. Definitely human. And close. Far too close.

Another knock.  
Another voice. This one softer, female.

**"Please. Let us out."**

I spun in the water, shining my light everywhere. Nobody. Just the door.

Another voice joined in, sounding like it came from behind me.

**"It’s cold. We can’t breathe."**

Then a fourth. **"You left us here."**

My limbs locked up. This wasn’t nitrogen narcosis. I knew the signs. I wasn’t hallucinating.

I grabbed my line and started to follow it back toward the exit. Slow at first, then faster as the voices grew louder, closer.

And then the tone shifted.

The voices stopped pleading and started accusing.

**"Coward."**  
**"You always run."**  
**"There’s no surface anymore."**  
**"You belong with us."**

I fumbled with the line, disoriented. My light flickered. Something brushed past my leg, but when I whipped around, there was nothing.

I should have kept going.  
I should have ignored them.

But something inside me — a voice that sounded like my own — whispered, *Just open it. See what happens.*

I turned back.

The door waited.

I reached out and gripped the handle. It was warm, almost pulsing under my glove.

I opened it.

Behind the door was nothing.

Not black water. Not stone. Just pure void. No up, no down. Like staring into the mouth of something ancient and patient.

A blast of freezing air roared out, slamming into me. My mask fogged. My body convulsed with cold. The light on my helmet flickered and died.

And then I heard it.

**Running.**

Dozens of bare feet slapping against stone. Hundreds. A stampede. They moved all around me, though I still saw nothing.

Something brushed my shoulder. Fingers maybe. Or claws.

The chamber trembled. Cracks spread across the walls like spiderwebs. Pebbles rained down, thudding against my tank.

I bolted, following the line with blind panic. I barely made it back to the tunnel as the cavern collapsed behind me, boulders smashing into the water, sending shockwaves that pushed me forward.

I surfaced with seconds of air left, coughing and shaking so violently I could barely climb onto the boat.

That was three months ago.

I haven’t dived since. I barely sleep.

Every night, I hear **knocking**.

Sometimes it’s at my front door.  
Sometimes it’s at the windows.  
Sometimes it’s from inside the house.

They don’t beg anymore.

They don't ask to be let out.

They're already here.

Waiting.
