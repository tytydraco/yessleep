I never should have gotten in that truck.

The rain was coming down in sheets, a cold, unrelenting downpour that soaked me to the bone. My phone had been dead for hours, my stomach was hollow, and my legs felt like lead after miles of walking. When I saw the semi’s headlights break through the storm, I didn’t think. I ran into the middle of the road, waving my arms like a lunatic.

The truck screeched to a stop, the hiss of air brakes slicing through the rain. For a moment, it just sat there, looming over me. I couldn’t see the driver through the rain-streaked windshield, but I felt his eyes. The cab door creaked open, and a man leaned out, his face shadowed by a damp baseball cap.

“You need a ride?” His voice was deep, measured.

I hesitated. Something about him made the hair on my neck stand up. He was huge—easily over six feet—and his shoulders filled the doorway. But the rain was freezing, and the road was empty.

“Yeah,” I said, climbing into the cab.

The door slammed shut behind me, cutting off the sound of the storm. The cab was warm but cramped, the dashboard cluttered with old receipts and empty coffee cups. The smell of leather and sweat hung heavy in the air.

“Where you headed?” he asked, putting the truck in gear.

“Anywhere west,” I said, keeping my voice steady.

He nodded but didn’t say anything else. His hands gripped the wheel, massive and rough, the knuckles nicked and scarred. I couldn’t stop staring at them.

“I’m Bill,” he said after a long silence, his eyes fixed on the road.

“Cassie.”

He glanced at me, his face unreadable in the dim light of the dashboard. His eyes lingered a moment too long.

The rain hammered against the windshield as we drove. He didn’t turn on the radio, didn’t make small talk. Just drove, his gaze fixed dead ahead, his expression blank. I tried to relax, but something about the way he gripped the wheel—tight, almost angry—made my stomach twist.

“You been walking a while?” he asked suddenly, his voice breaking the silence.

“Yeah,” I said, forcing a laugh. “Got caught in the storm.”

He nodded but didn’t look at me.

Minutes stretched into an hour, the silence heavy and oppressive. I tried to focus on the rain, the steady rhythm of the wipers, but my nerves were frayed. He hadn’t said a word since that one question, and I could feel his eyes flicking toward me every few minutes.

“You remind me of someone,” he said abruptly.

My stomach dropped.

“Oh? Who?” I asked, keeping my tone light.

“My sister,” he said.

I forced a smile. “That’s nice.”

He didn’t respond. Just kept driving.

The truck slowed suddenly, veering off the highway onto a narrow dirt road. My pulse spiked.

“Where are we going?”

“Shortcut,” he said, his tone flat.

The trees closed in on either side of the truck, the road so narrow it felt like the branches were scraping against the windows. The headlights barely cut through the darkness, and I couldn’t see anything but the narrow strip of road ahead.

“You sure this is a shortcut?” I asked, my voice trembling.

“Yeah.”

He didn’t elaborate.

I gripped the edge of my seat, my breath coming faster. I glanced at the door handle, wondering if I could survive the jump.

“Don’t.”

His voice was quiet, almost gentle, but it sent a chill down my spine.

“You jump out here, you’ll die in those woods,” he said. “Ain’t nothing out there but trees and coyotes.”

The truck came to a stop in a small clearing. He turned off the engine, and the silence was deafening.

“Why are we stopping?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

He didn’t answer.

He reached for something under his seat. I froze, my heart hammering in my chest. A knife? A gun?

“Here,” he said, pulling out a sandwich wrapped in plastic.

I stared at it, my mind racing.

“You hungry?” he asked.

I nodded, my hands shaking as I took it. I didn’t want to eat it. I didn’t trust it. But I couldn’t say no.

He watched me as I unwrapped it, his dark eyes unreadable.

“You remind me of her,” he said again, his voice softer this time.

“Your sister?” I asked, trying to keep him talking, keep him calm.

He nodded, his jaw tight.

“She left me,” he said. “Didn’t even say goodbye.”

“I’m sorry,” I said, my voice trembling.

He looked at me, really looked at me, and I felt like I couldn’t breathe.

“You’re different,” he said, almost to himself.

“Different how?” I asked, my throat dry.

“You don’t lie,” he said. “Not like the others.”

I had no idea what he meant, but I nodded, my fingers clutching the sandwich like a lifeline.

He sat back, his shoulders slumping. For a moment, he looked tired. Human.

Then he reached into his pocket.

My breath caught.

He pulled out a small silver locket, the metal tarnished with age.

“She gave me this,” he said, holding it out to me.

I stared at it, unsure if I should take it.

“She’d want you to have it,” he said.

I took it, my fingers brushing against his hand. His skin was ice cold.

“Get out,” he said suddenly, his voice sharp.

“What?”

“Get out of the truck,” he said, his eyes fixed on the windshield.

I didn’t move.

“Go!” he barked, his voice thunderous.

I fumbled with the door, scrambling out into the clearing. The rain had stopped, but the air was still damp and heavy.

He leaned across the seat, staring at me through the open door.

“Don’t look back,” he said.

I didn’t.

I ran, clutching the locket so tightly it dug into my palm. I didn’t stop until I hit the highway, my chest heaving, my legs trembling.

A car finally stopped, and I climbed in, sobbing as I told them what had happened.

The police searched the woods, but they didn’t find anything. No truck. No clearing. No Bill.

Sometimes, I wonder if he really let me go—or if he’s still out there, waiting for someone else to remind him of his sister.
