Thinking about things you shouldn’t is an established trait among humans, whether we developed that horrid trait through evolution or it just being a part of us that we always had I don’t know but I hate it. It sucks and it sucks more when you need just to let go of those certain events however on the road trapped in the Evernight it’s an impossibility. One does not simply erase horrors from the mind no matter how hard they try but luckily you can distract yourself, you can let your mind wander while driving for hours in the dark. My routine would consist of podcasts blasting music like a sane person, the one thing I’d recommend is to not fuel that burning desire to dwell on those bad thoughts or memories. Don’t be stupid and listen to horror videos or true crime podcasts. Don’t listen to that conspiracy theorist who has his radio station and has the southern voice that draws you in for it will only bring you to contemplate the strange happenings in your neck of the woods, along with the healthy dose distrust with the government staples of the country. Not that his points aren't entirely wrong but most people rather live in bliss. Don’t listen and think about the creepy shit on the radio, podcast, whatever just leave it as background noise believe me when I say the allure of horror should be kept to fiction as inviting into your life is never a clever idea. And for the love of God and all that is holy don’t fucking text and drive.

Now you might be wondering ‘Why can’t I think about the creepy shit or bad memories in my life?’ and my answer should be obvious, it’s creepy shit at night I don’t care about how brave or edgy you think you are. Out in the dark, that type of vibe can invite things to you, things that look human but well aren’t. This was made clear to me that my thoughts out at night can both influence and attract certain entities to someone’s location, some of these beings may be beneficial and can be extremely dangerous. You might ask how some can be beneficial to you. Well from what I’ve heard there are helpful entities that grant people who might come across them with money, treasures, or a sense of peace. Others don’t do anything remotely close to beneficial but aren’t exactly out to cause chaos to unfold they just more or less linger in the limbo of the Evernight. The best description I can utilize for them is in the simplest terms, weird. Events that occur be it creepy or riding on the side of weird stupid shit, for instance, there are odd occurrences, like a clown car honking its horn three times, where one of the passengers grants you a sight of a full moon on a clouded night - a peculiar incident, to say the least.

You may think to yourself ‘Oh I’m fine, it’s just creepy clowns at night.’ Yeah, many people thought the same thing back in the late 2010s and that ended up with people dead so good luck with that mentality. See in the Evernight you should have at least two rules with you encounter horrifying shit. The first option is to run like hell, or rather drive like a bat out of hell. The second and the riskier is to grab your gat and hold it sideways and explain why this bitch done fucked up. That’s assuming you have a Glock lying about inside of your car and you can hit while holding sideways. If not plan three seems to work best for some of my fellow contracted coworkers from the various parts of the great United States. Shoot and drive.

I listed the options above as such because when it comes down to it you must either fight or run. And I always say when you choose to run there is no shame in that. You’re a regular person after all not the protagonist in a novel. When it comes down to decisions you need to value your life and not play stupid games. I also give out these options because you want to learn from others, or you can be like my coworker. He told me about his time driving in the Evernight while I was still under his tutelage, he spoke to me often of his crazy experiences, and although he was extremely inebriated along with smoking way more pot than a den dedicated to growing marijuana. I listened and took away lessons from him. And before you question why he was, I don’t know why he decided to info dump his hellish stories unto me but there were plenty of bat shit tales that he experienced which most likely led to his current state however being the kind person I am, I leant him my ear. Besides when driving for nearly 12 hours a night having someone ramble about their time working the job you are taking over helps immensely for the first weeks on the job. I’m more than positive he was a sober great individual, but that person was long gone and the man I had sitting next to me was nothing more than a shell who only functioned from strong booze and somehow managed to drive sober enough to get to his destination. It was enough to keep his employment but of course, it wasn’t for long.

I made mistakes of dwelling on the terrible memories I made throughout my trips, and I allowed myself to let the supernatural influence my mind while driving and it caused stress like no other. By this point in my life, I learned that the supernatural is very much real and you should at the bare minimum give it the respect it deserves. Don’t misinterpret what I say next. When you do night drives for as long as I have, no matter the main road, or the backroads you will have an experience that will be seared into your mind or several, and you should treat it with some kind of respect. Not saying you should give a supernatural entity polite speech or anything like that. What I mean is if you encounter a monster, you treat the situation with some actual brain power and deal with it accordingly. For example, if you see a creature that resembles a human stand up screeching in the road within your headlights. You shouldn’t pull your phone out and film it and hope the cameraman rule applies to you, life is not a movie, and it may not send a saving grace to protect you in the moment that does happen.

Oh yeah, I forgot my old coworker's story, this one isn't necessarily supernatural at least I don't think it is true, but you can consider it an example of what I told you above, you should not put bad thoughts into the world, because the world may respond equally.

I remember he told me a story, on one of his travels he spotted a woman running from the wilderness into the main road and he stopped for her. Her face was that of a gorgeous model and she wore a beautiful white dress. He thought “Score.” At first and rolled his window down asking where she needed to go. He was told she needed just to get to the next town as fast as possible so that her husband wouldn’t find her and to at least take her to the hospital.

He was asking what happened to her as she got into his vehicle, and she explained to him that she was beaten by him countless times and she finally mustered up the courage to leave him. She fled with a friend who she trusted and when her husband found her, he beat her and the friend up and shot his friend. She ran away and got a ride from an Uber, but the Uber wouldn’t take her that far after they were shot at, so she fled down the road and into the wilderness. Feeling horrible for her he sped off telling her she’d be fine and that she would be taken to the hospital and the police notified.

During this trip she was asking questions and began to get sexual with him, she was being overly flirtatious and despite his better judgment, he let his little brain get the better of him. While they started getting a little busy, he had undone her dress only to discover that she had bullet wounds and stab wounds in her stomach. When he saw this the woman grew angry, she began screeching while grasping at his throat. Screaming he tried getting her off and out of the vehicle only to wake up in the truck alone on the side of the road parked. The only thing he had was the scent of her lingering and the blood still all over his clothes, driving away he shuddered in fear.

That was the story I remembered on one of my trips it was a Friday night. I got my coffee and grabbed my keys to pack up the vehicle they provided me at this old military building that was repurposed for whatever the company uses it for now. I was told to take the supplies they had ready to another contractor in a city a few hours up and come back with some supplies they had in their vehicle. The job was simple, swap the goods and get back down. If anything, else was required they would inform me through text and send me. Simple enough, normal stuff everything that this company takes always goes back to this lab up in a big city and we are sent to collect the items or trade whatever essentially, we are mostly contract couriers. The job was as simple as they come and so I made my way to grab what I needed to form the hospital as directed.

I soon began my long drive into the endless blackness of the Evernight with nothing but the destination in mind. I drove on with music playing and thoughts of ‘what horrors may come to play tonight’. That was the wrong thought because that was the day, I witnessed the first untimely deaths on the road. My mind was racing at the story my coworker told me before I was a free man doing these jobs on my own. It wasn't creepy but I wouldn't know what to do in that situation, not the horny woman in the car. But if someone was riding with me and suddenly attacked me or met someone on the side of the road who needed my help.

As for my story, I vividly remember that night—it was 2337 I was going about 87 miles an hour on the empty backroads. They were considered to be the new long toll roads however due to the pricing no one ever took them, eventually, they became free however still due to being so far out no one took them. There was a bend in the road with overgrown grass alongside a hill which was the reason I didn't see the hazard lights on the road and they weren't far at all, slamming on the brakes I came to a halt a little way from the vehicle, and my adrenaline spiked at the sudden action I had to take as I contemplated what could have happened had my reaction been a second slower. I would have collided with the vehicle and at best very injured or worse – a direct collision with the car. Illuminating the area with my high beams, I discerned a lone white Toyota Camry obstructing the road. Inside, there were figures slumped in their seats, with red stains on the window.

My instincts took over as I unbuckled my seat belt, opened the passenger storage compartment for first aid, and quickly placed it in the center console. Picking up my head and turning for my door I looked out into the night through the window and there briefly illuminated by the hazard lights was a dark figure hidden slightly in the brush. I paused my movement and stared waiting for the lights to flicker on again. As they did, I saw the figure looking at me tilt its head slightly, curious if it was spotted. It was pure luck I noticed; the figure crouched in the grass divider tucked by some of that thick brush. But it was close enough to notice.

My mind raced with thoughts. “*What should I do? Should I drive off? Open the door and scream at him to leave? No, I don’t know what he has. If I don’t do something now, he’s going to make the first move.”*

A few moments went by, and I decided to open the door, I steadied my breathing while cursing myself for doing something that could get me killed. The moment I opened the door and exited I pulled out my gun from its holster and turned my weapon light to expose the figure locking in with my red dot sight. During the few seconds I had opened my door and stepped out the figure had stood up but froze the moment, I turned that beam on and placed a hand up blocking the light in his other hand I took full notice of his still dripping red liquid-stained large knife. I held my position and demanded what he wanted from me.

No verbal response was given however his actions did give a response; he made a slicing motion on his neck as he took a step forward toward me. He must have thought I had a regular flashlight because he continued to step towards me as I yelled for him to stop. I shouted as loud as I could for him to stop moving. Even though he was a decent distance away from where I was a dead sprint from his distance is still dangerous because bullets don’t stop someone immediately. When he continued to move to me slowly, methodically this was something he was well versed in doing many, many times. I shouted for him to drop the knife and by his fourth step he stopped. I think he finally took notice that what was in my hand wasn't a normal light.

The moment he ceased all movement and that granted me precious seconds of planning. From the looks of it, I could shoot this hooded figure dead and be cleared of any wrongdoing, or I could get back into the vehicle and run away and never think about this again. Another part of me just screamed for me to shoot him and end his life. Whatever bravery the hooded figure showed earlier, he certainly lost it all as the gun was reason enough to not pick this would-be prey tonight and that was good enough for me. He took a few steps back and gave me a small wave as he casually walked away. After he got further into the grass, he gently removed the hood to show a blank mask, one of those party masks you get at a party store. The white mask had noticeable red stains scattered all over the left cheek and to contrast the messy left side was just one long bloody tear coming down from the right eye slit.

After fading into the darkness, I called the police and waited for them to get there, during that time I inspected the body that was in the car, staring up into the car was a handsome young man who was holding his neck, blood splayed across his shirt and fear painted on his face. The multiple stab wounds in his chest indicated the cause of death. In the passenger’s seat was a beautiful woman who was coughing up blood reaching for the door handle gurgling still and crying in pain, whimpering at the sight of me. I heard her cries as I ran to my car and grabbed a first aid bag. I ran to the side of the car put on the emergency gloves and pulled out gauze and other first aid equipment. I opened the door and assisted her out of the car hearing her cry holding onto me as her blood pooled onto me.

I pulled her to the light of the vehicle and began first aid. She was trying to tell me something however I didn’t understand her at all. She pointed to her stomach and told me, “It hurts. Scared.” She said in gurgled breaths. I tried to do everything I could to prevent the bleeding from continuing however I didn’t know how long she may have. I cut her shirt with the emergency scissors and looked at her body, the source of her bleeding was the three stab wounds to her stomach, I grabbed some of the clotting gauze and began putting it onto the knife wounds and wrapping them around her stomach as her cries of pain echoed into the night. Minutes felt like hours, and I held her there in the night as she kept crying out for help. She was holding onto my blood stand jacket as I kept her other hand on her wound putting pressure on it.

Occasionally the sound of a crunch echoed in the grassy patches to which my response was a sweep with my pistol with the light on and ready to shoot. My fear grew not only for me but the woman I now held in my arms, I was scared, not just for her as horrible as it sounds. I didn’t want to get stabbed by the masked man because that would mean certain death for both of us. My attention was stretched thin from both the sounds of the grass on the other side of the road and the young girl's moans of pain. The bleeding wouldn't stop so I had to help her the best way I knew how. Pulling more of the first aid out applying more of the gauze on her wound and pushing her into the recovery position.

I did my best to tell her to keep talking, fight through the pain, and keep telling me random facts about anything. My goal was to keep her away from death for as long as I could. The growing fear that I would be the last person on this planet to see her before she died was becoming a reality the longer I waited for the police.

All the while I kept on the lookout for the police. Finally, after what felt like a lifetime both law enforcement came alongside an ambulance, the relief of seeing those red and blue lights was unlike any other. I put my gun quickly away as I exclaimed to the woman she would be okay. I saw one of the medical personnel get out of the vehicle one quickly walk over to her, while I moved aside for them I didn't take note of who it was but one of the people grabbed me and promptly shoved me into the Camry.

It then hit me as the cold steel of the handcuffs placed on me, my mind registered it was a police officer who was now reading me my rights. As he was shouting at me, I could only stare into the shocked expression of the young man who lifelessly sat in the car in front of me. I could only recall being shoved into the car twice over and the cop screaming at me demanding 'What happened to him!? Tell me damn it.'

Finally, after what felt like what would have been another bashing, the man’s motion abruptly stopped, and a female voice asked me to explain myself as I felt the strong grip of the man loosen and drop away from my arms.

Turning my head to her I looked at the man who cuffed and slammed my head into the car, the startling realization that he looked remarkably like the young boy in the car. With tears rolling down his cheek I understood his frustration. The female officer took me and guided me to her car where we spoke of my encounter. I told her what had happened mentioning how I just saw a hooded figure walk away from me waving goodbye. She shook her head in disbelief however even if my brief explanation didn’t give them much to work it did seem to clear me of any involvement other than being the unlucky individual who stumbled upon the scene.

She said to me, “You know she might make it, and it's thanks to you. You’re a hero.” I looked at her almost disgusted by the word, I was not a hero that is for sure. A hero would have done more, I did not even shoot the man responsible for it.

She wrote down my information and said she would contact me if anything came up for whatever reason they would need me. But as far as they were concerned and needed. I was free to go after an hour. I thanked them and her turning I made my way to my vehicle. Driving off I looked back at the eerie sight of the red and blue flashing lights of the EMS swallowing the hazard lights which were losing their power and fading into small faint orange lights by now.

I felt regret hit me a sort of heaviness in my chest, the thing I noticed when I was there was how in the car I noticed their phones, purses, and even his backpack inside the car were not messed with just those two individuals who were murdered. They were just prey to a monster in human skin within the Evernight, it was not a robbery gone wrong, it was just murder for the sake of murder. That experience gave me a rush I didn’t want to feel, the cold feeling of adrenaline flowing through my body as I was thrust into a fight or flight response coincided with the painful guilt. The guilt of not pulling the trigger and ending his life. That unhealthy guilt of knowing I let a monster get away into the darkness of the Evernight.
