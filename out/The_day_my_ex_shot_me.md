Back story (I’ll try to keep it short) 

This girl randomly added me on Snapchat and we had a really good conversation. So we started hanging out shortly after. 

She was honestly a little crazy but I kind of liked that. I think it was something different and exciting for me. 

I knew all along I didn’t want to date her, I just wanted to have fun and chill with her. We talked for a few months and I had a great time but I was ready to move on and find someone I can actually introduce to my parents. 

So I started to slowly ghost her, I knew she wasn’t going to take it well cuz I could tell she really liked me and like I said earlier she was kinda crazy but holy fucking shit it was even harder than I thought. 

At first I tried to be nice, I would say things like “it’s not you it’s me” or “I just need to work on myself”

That never worked so finally I just told her the truth. I just said I didn’t want to see her anymore and we needed to go out separate ways. Suddenly she completely understood and didn’t try to contact me anymore. 

(Now we get into the good part)

A few months later we started talking again and she asked me to come over to her house. I wanted to say no but she convinced me that all she wanted to do was have fun and drink. 

So we drank and smoked and had a great time. I got a little too fucked up and she carried me to her bedroom. Next thing I remember she was on top of me with no pants on and I had my shirt off. 

So I pushed her off and said “I’m
Sorry but I don’t think that’s a good idea, can you call me an Uber” 

She got up and walked out and I started to doze off again. 

Then I just heard a loud bang so I shot up from the bed and looked around. Then I remember the smell of gunpowder. I was so confused and I was just trying to piece together what happened. 

I looked to my left and saw her standing there with a gun pointed at me. 

I looked down and noticed my pant leg was wet so I touched it and looked at my hand. 

That’s when I realized it was blood. I don’t remember this part but apparently I said “did you just shoot me” then I passed out. 

I remember waking up in her front yard with her bent over me crying saying “I’m sorry” over and over again. 

I thought I was going to die that night but the emt 100% absolutely saved my life. The second he got there he immediately put a tourniquet around my leg and he was so calm. 

He was like a super hero and I thank god everyday for him. 

She shot me with a 45 caliber pistol and it went through the side of my leg and out the  back. 

I didn’t even need surgery and I was out of the hospital a week later. 

I don’t tell my family this part but I still see her from time to time. She’s in a mental hospital and normally I just go over there with her dad and play video games with her. 

I know that part sounds crazy but I honestly don’t hate her. I feel bad tbh, she’s already been through enough and I just put her through more.
