I used to work at one of the old Nickelodeon studios back in the early 2000s.
Yeah, that Nickelodeon—the slime, the orange splats, the cartoons that raised a whole generation.

You’re probably wondering why I’m only talking about this now.
Why I’ve kept quiet for almost 25 years.
I’ll tell you.
But you need to know my story first.

I was part of the early screening crew. We were the last step before the execs and censors—our job was simple: watch every episode before it aired. Catch anything… off.

September 1st, 2000.
I got a call at 3:06 AM.
It was my boss, Mr. Fawn, asking—no, demanding—I come in immediately to preview the Season 2 premiere of SpongeBob. Just Episode 1.

I asked why so late.
He didn’t answer. Just said: “Get here. Now.”

I didn’t argue. I needed that job. Rent was past due, and I didn’t want to crawl back to my mom’s basement.
I threw on my jacket, and headed out the door
Wait.
No keys.

“Damn it.”
I ran back inside and that’s when I noticed it.

A low hum.
Not mechanical, not electrical. Just... wrong.

My living room was glowing with this faint blue light. I walked in, confused.
The TV—static. Not regular white noise—blue static, like the screen was underwater.

The air smelled sweet, but old Like lavender and pumpkin. and.. Mold
My candles. I always lit those around fall. It made the place feel cozy. But this wasn’t cozy.
This was... cold.

As I approached the screen, I swear—I SWEAR—I heard laughter.
Not a chuckle. Not a giggle.
Laughter like a recorded loop of joy twisted into something evil.

I shut it off. Told myself it was just a signal hiccup.

Then I left.




Thirty minutes later I pulled into the studio lot. The place was dead quiet. No security. Just one dim lobby light flickering like something out of a VHS tape.

There was a note on the front desk.
It was from Amber, one of the security guards. We were close. Not romantically, just... friends who had each other’s backs.

> “Adam
Mr. Fawn told me to let you in and step out for the night.
Weird, right? But he said you'd take over.
Lock up by 6AM.”
–Amber.



Next to the note was a DVD.
Plain white. No logos. No markings.

Except...

In black marker, barely legible:
“The Sponge is God”
And a stick-figure drawing of SpongeBob… colored in red.

My stomach dropped.




I walked down the hallway toward the screening room. Didn’t even think to flip the lights on. Everything felt... heavy. Thick air. Every footstep felt like it echoed longer than it should’ve.

When I entered the screening room, the shadows swallowed me. Even when I flipped on the lights, it still felt dark.

And that’s when I saw it.
A yellow blur in the corner of my eye.
I turned fast.

Nothing.

“Sleep deprivation,” I muttered. But I didn’t believe that. Not really.

I sat down. Slid the DVD into the player. It whirred—loud, broken.
Then it started.




The SpongeBob theme came on.

Only it was… wrong.
Slowed to a crawl.
The music warped, like it was being played underwater. Gurgled. Distorted.
The instruments weren’t cheerful. They were sharp. Dissonant.

And then SpongeBob came on screen to play the final note—on his nose like always—
But this time, his nose snapped off.
No sound effect. Just a sickening crack.
Then, for a single frame—his eyes flashed blood red.

I screamed, “What the hell"

I couldn’t breathe. I had seen stuff like this in other stories, but this—this felt personal. This was real.

The episode started.
SpongeBob and Patrick standing at Squidward’s door.
Begging him to come outside. Repeating over and over:

> “Please come out, Squidward…”
“Please…”
“It’s fun outside…”



Their voices broke into sobs. Hyper-realistic crying. Not cartoonish. Human.

Then the door creaked open.

Squidward’s body—
Slumped. Knife in his chest.

The camera zoomed in.

Too close.
Way too close.

Hyper-realistic blood, mucus, flies buzzing around his bloated face.
His eyelids were crusted shut, lips blue.
I gagged. Then I puked.

Suddenly—
A shriek. High-pitched, bone-shattering.

I looked back at the screen.

Bodies.
Flashed on screen like a subliminal frame.

At least a dozen. All children.
Eyes wide open. Mouths twisted in horror.
Some looked like they were still screaming.

I puked again.

And then—
Black.
Screen off.
Lights out.

I sat there frozen. Then I heard it.

A voice.
“Do you like what I’ve done, Squidward?”

Right in my ear.
Right behind me.

I jumped from my seat, turned—but slipped in my own vomit. I slammed into the chair row.

And then I heard it.

“BWAWAWAWAWAWAAAAHH!”
SpongeBob’s laugh.

But not from the speakers.

From the room.

I scrambled to my feet. Nothing on screen. Just darkness.
I ran for the door.

Then the intercom clicked on.

My boss’s voice. Calm. Cold.

> “You can’t escape this, Adam.
He needs a soul for satisfaction.”



I screamed.
“WHAT THE HELL WAS ON THAT DVD?!”

No reply.

Just silence.
And then…

A yellow shape darted past the hallway window.

I was gone.




I didn’t go for the front doors—I knew better.
I ran through the back halls. Past props. Past flickering lights.

That smell came back.
Mold. Rot. And lavender.
And under it all... the theme song.
That same, slowed-down version.
Getting louder.

I reached the back exit.

Locked.

I grabbed a rusted old prop—some steel anchor from a failed set piece—and smashed the door.
Crack.
Smash again.

Glass shattered.

I fell through, shards in my arms and back.
Didn’t care. I ran. I didn’t stop.

I made it to a gas station two miles down the road.
Begged for the phone. Called the cops.

Did I tell them SpongeBob tried to kill me? Hell no.
I told them my boss had trapped me and shown me something messed up.
They gave me weird looks. Filed a report. Nothing came of it.




A week later, I got a ticket for abandoning my car.
The studio made a public statement saying someone had tampered with a DVD in the vault.
No further comments.
The building was quietly shut down the following year.

I thought I could move on.




But tonight—August 5th, 2025—I heard something.

From outside my bedroom door.

That same, slow, warped SpongeBob theme.
Playing on a loop.

And just now...
I saw blue static on my TV.

The smell of lavender and pumpkin is in the air.

And I swear—
I can hear breathing.

Right
Behind
Me.




He still needs a soul.
