When I was twelve, I saved a boy in my class from drowning.

I was walking home from school with my dad, after a ballet rehearsal that had dragged on. It was winter, and dark outside even though it was only 6pm. We walked across a wide, well-reinforced bridge that curved upwards into an arch from the side of the riverbank, reaching a peak around twenty feet above the fast-flowing water. Just as we were about to reach the other side, I heard a faint yelp coming from a distance to our left.

I turned my head. Even in the darkness, there was no mistaking that a kid was being swept along towards us in the water, the strong current dragging him mercilessly. It was clear that he couldn't swim, and was being pulled along like a ragdoll, flailing around to no avail.

Before my dad could react, I sprinted back across the bridge and ran along the other side of bank which the boy was closer to. I climbed over the fence running alongside the bank and ran to the edge, then crouched down and stretched my hand out as far as possible. The boy spotted me and tried to stretch his arm out too, but I could see from a distance that it wasn't enough. Our hands were going to be inches from touching, and he would be swept past me.

Thinking quickly, I took off my pink backpack and pulled out one of the straps to its full length. Then I flung it into the water with my arm outstretched, holding onto the end of the strap tightly. The bulk of the bag bobbed in the middle of the river. As soon as the boy came past, he grabbed onto it, and I pulled with all my might. When he came within arm's distance, I held out my other hand and he took it firmly as I pulled him out of the water.

We lay clutching each other on the riverbank. He was shivering, soaked from head to toe. My dad finally caught up, shining the flashlight on the back of his phone camera at us.

I recognized the boy. It was Noah, from my math class. I'd never talked to him before though - he was one of the 'cool kids', a group I wasn't part of, and we sat at opposite ends of the class. Under the light, he also recognized me, and awkwardly let go of my arm. We climbed over the fence to the other side, where my dad was standing.

"You alright, son?" Asked my dad, catching his breath.

"Y-yes, sir," he said, still trembling from the cold. My dad took off his jacket and wrapped it around Noah.

"You hurt?" Asked dad. Noah shook his head. "Come on, let's get you warm back home then."

My house was a ten minute walk away. Noah was understandably quiet and in shock on the way back. When we arrived, I gave Noah one of my sweaters to change into, and mom offered him dinner at our house.

"I really should get going now, my mom's probably worried," he said nervously.

"Alright, but it's dark out, I'll give you a lift in the car," offered dad. They left out the front door.

The next day, I saw Noah with his friends in the corridor outside the lockers.

The terrified, shivering kid I had dragged out of the river yesterday was gone, and he was back to his usual nonchalant self. As he came towards me, we made eye contact for a second, and I looked away quickly. I saw him breaking away from his friends and coming towards me out the corner of my eye.

"Hey," he said. I turned to look at him again.

"Hi," I replied.

"I didn't get to say thanks properly yesterday, so thanks," he said.

"Uh, don't worry about it," I said.

"Wanna hang out at lunch?"

"Sure, I guess."

"Okay awesome, see ya later!"

We got lunch together after third period and sat at a table opposite each other.

"Don't you want to sit with your friends?" I asked.

"It's fine, they'll live without me for an hour," he said. We started eating.

"How did you end up in the river?" I finally asked. He paused for a second and stared at the chip on his fork.

"I was walking home by myself from Jake's house, and I think I slipped when I got to the end of the bridge."

"The bridge my dad and I were walking on?"

"Nah, there's another bridge that looks exactly the same as that one a couple yards down."

I wondered how that could've happened, as the bridge had barrier railings on both sides.

"So you weren't climbing over the rails or anything?" I asked.

"Oh nah, I slipped," he said firmly.

"Right."

I didn't question further.

We started hanging out all the time after that. Noah always came up to me every time he saw me, even if he was with his friends. I usually sat alone at lunch, but now we always sat together. When some older kids tried to take my lunch money outside the lockers, he ran over and told them to shove off. When we got phones, he texted me non-stop and always asked me to come to his house to play video games on the weekends.

He texted me a link to a local news article one day, warning parents not to let their kids climb over bridge railings.

'Look, it says some kid literally drowned in the same river I fell into.'

'Holy shit,' I replied, 'that's crazy.'

I wondered how a kid had even fallen in again. From what I remembered, the bridge had high railings on both sides, and there was a fence alongside both banks. My dad and I had walked across it almost every day without trouble when I was in middle school. It didn't strike me as an incredibly dangerous spot, unless you literally scaled the bridge railings and jumped off, or climbed over the fence along the bank. But even then there was a healthy stretch of grass between the fence and the river. Probably fell in from climbing around, I thought. I'd always thought Noah fell in that way too, but assumed he didn't want to admit it.

As we got older and went into high school, Noah became handsome and athletic. People gravitated towards him, but somehow, he still stuck to me like glue. Any time I texted him to meet up for anything, he would arrive without delay. My parents loved Noah, and my dad especially had a soft spot for him and wouldn't stop teasing me about spending so much time with him.

On several occasions, I overheard girls talking about us in the bathrooms. They were confused as to why Noah was always with me when I was "barely attractive". It hurt to hear, and sometimes I thought they were right.

When we were seventeen, Noah and I were hanging at a park near our high school in the evening. We were alone, and sat next to each other on a set of kids' swings that we were getting too big for. The sun was setting behind a wooded stretch in the distance.

"Hey, I kinda like you," he said straightforwardly. "Wanna date?"

I felt my face flushing.

"I'm… not sure," I said quietly.

"You can say 'no' if you don't like me. I won't get mad," he smiled.

"It-it's not that," I said. He looked at me, waiting for an answer. "I just wonder sometimes," I continued, "I think you're too good for me. If it hadn't been for that river incident, would we even have been friends?"

We sat in silence for a minute.

"Probably not," he admitted candidly, "but it happened, so let's not downplay it."

He got up and stood in front of me as I rocked back and forth on the swing.

"You saved my life," he continued, "I know I'm pretty cool, but that wouldn't mean shit if I was dead. I owe you everything I've got, and I'm yours forever. So will you be mine?"

"Stop being cringe or I'll kick you," I said, embarrassed. I tapped him with my shoe. He grabbed my foot and pulled me towards him.

"So that's a yes?"

I nodded, holding in a smile.

So from then on, he was my boyfriend. We graduated high school and went to prom together. I ended up at his place after the prom, and we passed out on the couch.

That night, I woke up at 3am. Noah was gripping my arm so tightly that it was cutting off my circulation.

"Don't let go, don't let it get me, help me…" he muttered in his sleep. I touched his cheek, and he seemed to wake up. He suddenly looked at me with the same terrified expression he had when I pulled him out of the water all those years ago. "Hey, I've got you, don't worry," I said quietly, as he fell back asleep.

Time went by fast, and before I knew it, we were a week away from starting college.

On the last weekend of our vacation, he sent me a familiar text. Yet again, another kid had drowned in the same river I had saved him in years ago. Another child's body found at the mouth of the river.

'Again? That's awful,' I replied.

'That's five kids now. Six including me. I think there's something going on there.'

'Wym?'

'I'll show you. Meet me there.'

As I trekked the same ten minute walk along the path I used to take to get to middle school, I wondered what he was going to show me. I walked up to him standing at the head of the bridge my dad and I had walked across years ago. He was looking down, concerned.

"What's up?" I chirped.

"You see how there's no gap between the fence and where the bridge meets the side of the river?" he asked.

"Yeah," I nodded. He gestured for me to follow him. We walked for a minute over to the second bridge, just barely in view from the first. He then pointed towards the same corresponding spot at the head of this second bridge.

"This was where I was when I fell."

At the head of this second bridge, there was a gap of a few feet where the fence ended and the foot of the bridge began. There was about a four foot drop between the grass and the water below. I could see how someone could've fallen in if they purposefully walked off the side of the grass through the gap, but it still didn't seem like a place you could slip through easily.

"There's something I didn't tell you the day after you saved me," he began, "probably because I convinced myself it didn't happen, and it was really dark, so I didn't see anything. Actually, I'm still not sure if it did…" I waited for him to get to the point. "But I'm pretty sure I felt something pull my ankle as I walked past this gap."

"Something pulled you?"

"Yeah, definitely felt something yank my ankle. I convinced myself I'd just slipped on mud, but reading all these news articles… that's at least five kids that fell in this same river. I mean, five in a few years isn't shocking, but everyone knows not to climb in this area. The whole place is fenced off. So, I'm starting to think the same thing might've happened to those other kids in this spot."

I walked up to the edge of the riverbank where the gap was, and looked around down it. Nothing out of the ordinary, just a gap of unfenced grass.

"What do you think pulled you?" I asked.

"I didn't see anything, it was dark. I'm sure I felt something grab my ankle though. This is weird but, it felt like a hand?"

"A hand?"

"I know it sounds ridiculous, but that's what it felt like."

He started walking across the bridge to the other side, and I followed. There was a sparse wooded area surrounding the path that the bridge exited into. Noah walked through it to a bench a few yards away, and we sat on it.

"I've just been watching people walking across the bridge for the past few days in the afternoon, you get a good view from here," he said. I looked at him. "Okay, that sounded weird. But for research purposes only, you know what I'm saying?"

"What are you looking for?" I asked

"I don't really know, but I've got my eye on that gap next to the bridge head on the other side."

"Seen any zombie hands pop out and drag people in?"

"Not yet," he said.

We talked for a bit as the sun set and it started getting dark. A couple of people walked across the bridge in that time - dog walkers, kids going home from school, the like.

We were mid conversation when we spotted two tall men dressed in all black start to walk across the bridge. There was something off about them, and we both caught on. We stopped talking abruptly and stared in silence.

As they got to the end of the bridge, one of them stepped through the gap where there was no fence, and reached out towards the underside of the bridge. He pulled himself from the bank onto the underside of the bridge, almost disappearing from view, except for one of his legs as he stood on a bit of scaffolding under the bridge. The other man followed, swinging off the side of the perching next to the first man. Their silhouettes were barely visible in the darkness and through the distance, but unmistakably present.

"The fuck," muttered Noah. I stared in confusion. We watched them for a few minutes, lurking under the bridge.

"Jesus," said Noah. "Are they hiding under there to try and pull people into the river?"

I took a second look. The distance between them and the unfenced part of the river bank right next to the bridge head was just within arm's reach. A chill ran through me.

A couple walking their dog strolled over the bridge. I held my breath as they reached the other side and walked off the head of the bridge, past the gap in the fence.

Nothing happened.

Noah and I looked at each other tensely. In the next few minutes, an old man and another couple walked across the bridge without issue.

"Maybe they're just chilling out there," I said.

Noah was quiet, still staring as a young girl started walking over the bridge. As she got closer to the other side, one of the men leaned out from under the bridge, and reached his arm out into the gap.

"Oh shit," muttered Noah, standing up. Before I could clock what was going on, he ran out of the wooded area and to the foot of the bridge.

"Stop!" He yelled. The girl turned. "It's dangerous! Come back this way!"

The girl stood still, looking at him in confusion.

"Come back over to this side," shouted Noah.

She slowly started backing away from the head of the bridge.

"Yeah, that's it," he gestured. I caught up and stood next to him, waving and also shouting at the top of my lungs. "Come back here!"

Suddenly, the two men clambered out from underneath the bridge and pulled themselves onto the riverbank. They ran onto the bridge. The girl screamed and started running towards us at break neck speed while the two men in black chased her, and got closer to our end of the bridge. I panicked and instinctively retreated, but Noah ran forwards straight onto the bridge and into the trajectory of the two men. He tackled one of them to the ground and the other one joined in the brawl, allowing the girl to escape and reach the bank. She ran to my side and looked back. I looked at Noah in panic.

"I'll be fine, go!" He shouted.

I hesitated.

"Move!" He yelled.

I took the girl's hand and we darted away from the bridge, my heart racing wildly. We got to the main road, where we went into a shop for cover. I called the cops and explained the situation to them and the shop staff, leaving the girl with one of them. Forty minutes max.

Then, I ran back out and towards the bridge again. Stupid move I know, what if the men were still out there? But I had to make sure Noah was okay.

I got to the bridge and it was quiet. It was pitch black now, except from the moon which reflected on the surface of the water.

Not a person in sight.

'Noah!' I yelled. My voice echoed through the trees behind me. Then silence.

I ran to the peak of the bridge at the very center, and collapsed on my knees. I could see cops running towards me in the distance. I managed to hold it together and explain what happened to them, that the girl was safe, but that I now had no idea where Noah or the two men dressed in black were.

Two days passed. Three bodies were found in the lake that the river opened out into.

One of the men in black had a knife on him, and stabbed Noah in the gut five times. Then they tried to throw him off the side of the bridge, but he dragged them overboard and all three ended up in the water.

These two men had been spotted by several passers-by, who didn't think much of them other than being a couple of fools or possibly construction workers. They came out in the dark a couple times a year, and waited under the bridge for hours at a time for children walking alone to drag into the water as a twisted hobby. Most of the time, they wouldn't catch their target demographic. But about once a year, a child would go missing, then end up in the lake or washed up on the river bank under unexplained circumstances. That pattern ended along with Noah.

Naturally, I was inconsolable for months, having just lost my boyfriend and best friend of six years. After the grief, I was numb.

Looking back, the mystery had been on Noah's mind ever since the second child who fell in died. The two men had just moved to the area six years ago. Noah would have been the first victim. He acted different that day at school, and although I couldn't tell what he was thinking, I knew something was on his mind. Initially, I thought he had shaken off his near death experience with ease, but later he mentioned it came back to haunt him many nights. He finally got the answer he was looking for. What he felt was undoubtedly real, and more sinister than anyone could have imagined.

They tried to kill him once, but he lived to tell the tale. Then he came back and took them down. I love you, Noah.
