As you all know, during the height of the pandemic, flights were very scarce, which was precisely why I needed to book a red-eye flight for an important meeting I had the next day.

While frantically searching online for a flight, I came across this travel agency that I'd never heard of before...

The first thing I noticed was the flights advertised on their website were very cheap (too cheap if you ask me). 

I thought surely, this was a scam or something but that wasn't the case. 

It was far worse as you'll later learn...

Anyway, for those of you who are wondering, I won't divulge the name of the travel agency for safety reasons.

Now, where was I? 

Oh, as I stated before it was far worse than some scam.

See, every person I talked to had never heard of this travel agency.

On top of that, there were no comments or even ratings online.

Even stranger was their hours of operation which was from 9 PM to 6 AM.

Although I found this strange, I didn't question it because I desperately needed to catch a flight.

After booking my flight, I received an email confirmation and directions on how to get to the particular airport where I'd be catching my flight.

I arrived at the airport at around 9 PM as my flight was at midnight.

It was a smaller airport (I never knew existed) located on the outskirts of town.

Surprisingly though, it was bustling with people this late at night.

Anyway, after arriving at the airport I realized I had an hour to kill before boarding my flight so, I decided to have a drink at the bar I spotted when I arrived.

The bar with its low lighting gave me a creepy vibe.

The bartender was even creepier and reminded me of Lloyd, from "The Shining".

After several drinks, I finally got up.

As I was about to leave, the bartender who was quiet for the most part said in a monotone voice, "Have a safe trip."

Turning around to thank him, I noticed there was no reflection of him in the mirror located behind him.

Rubbing my eyes, I thought for sure, it was my imagination or that maybe, I had way too much to drink.

I quickly exited the bar.

It was about thirty minutes later when I finally, boarded my flight.

I  scanned the plane and noticed that it was relatively packed. 

At first, nothing seemed off about the flight.

Even the take-off went smoothly.

About an hour after take-off, the flight attendants began serving the beverages.                   

This is when things started to get strange.

After finishing their drinks, I noticed almost immediately that the other passengers beginning to pass out.

Suspecting that they placed something in the drinks, I quickly disposed of mine and pretended to be asleep.

This is when all hell broke loose.

See, the flight attendants somehow looked different from when I first boarded the plane.

Gone were their human features only to be replaced by ghoulish ones and oh god, their teeth...

Even the pilot who was talking over the intercom no longer sounded human.

 His voice sounded almost guttural like that of someone possessed.

Anyway, I began to hear screams (from the few passengers still awake), as the flight crew began attacking the passengers.

Now, it looked like a total blood bath inside the plane.

The sight of blood proved too much for me and soon, I passed out.

When I finally came to, everything was back to normal and there were no signs that a massacre had just taken place a couple of hours ago.

The plane was about to land so, most of the passengers who I thought were dead were now, wide awake.

Maybe, it was just a bad dream I thought.

Soon enough, I forgot about my dream.

After the meeting, I went back to my hotel room.

That's when I noticed the puncture marks on my neck, causing my blood to freeze.

So here's my warning to you...

Never, book a red-eye flight from a suspicious website or you'll end up being food for them.
