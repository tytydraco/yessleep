The vibrant, rainbow collage of lights outlining Zane’s Jammin’ Jungle did little to mask the cold, grey brick building beneath it. The complex sat imposingly right on the edge of the shelf, like a creature peaking its head over the side of the abyss, staring at Hope and I as we drew near. It looked hungry. Excited that its prey was willingly coming straight for it.

We stopped about 30 feet from the front door, staring inside. The slightly tinted windows only half helped to mask the interior; bright neon colors and black lights casting it all in a blue glow. It was such a harsh change in lighting compared to what we’d been living in for the past month that it almost hurt my eyes to look at.

“Okay…” Hope swallowed, “You ready?”

“Yeah,” I told her, my heart thudding softly to the drumbeat of the party music playing inside.

The doors welcomed us in with an automatic whir, all too eager to get us inside. My skin crawled as we stepped into the entrance hall and already had a face glaring at us. A plastic statue of a Zebra smiling wide was sat affixed to a bench, one hooved arm stretched along the back for kids to sit themselves inside. As a young girl, I always thought the charming little photo op was awesome, getting to sit next to a famous local character. Now that I was an adult, I found the striped horse’s unmoving, cartoon pupils unsettling.

“Hey, Zane,” Hope softly joked as we moved past.

We were cautious as we passed through the next set of doors and entered the party space, taking it all in. The room was huge, almost looking bigger now that we were inside, although, whether that was due to some sort of anomaly or just clever space use, I wasn’t sure. The space was one continuous stretch, but several half walls or large decorations sectioned off the designated areas. It was all just as I remembered.

Pillars holding up the ceiling were disguised to look like trees, while fake foliage was strewn across the ceiling to give the space the illusion of a forest canopy. Bright, colorful spotlights punctured through it to blanket the neon confetti carpet below, energizing all the bright colors with a ghastly glow. Sinister statues of grinning jungle creatures and cartoony murals on the walls all sat frozen in time, unable to move and escape this rotting nightmare.

The arcade machines and games were all still present, cramming the space and stuffed up on even more balconies, but even though their decorative lights were still functioning, their screens were off and dark, creating a funhouse of black mirrors that stared imposingly at Hope and I.

I gingerly unhooked the velvet rope that barred us from entering, then the two of us moved through without getting a stamp on our hands.

We only moved a few steps into the room before stopping once more, not yet ready to dive into the maze of machines and tacky décor.

“Where should we start looking first?” I asked.

“I don’t know,” Hope whispered back, her voice barely cutting through the generic 60s rock that echoed through the building. Her head turned on a pivot before locking on the area off to our left; the prize counter. Wordlessly she began moving closer, “Hang on, though.”

“What, you finally trying to get that big stuffed horse that we always wanted?” I teased her.

“No, smart Alec.” She jabbed back, reaching the massive cave of toys and candy before hopping the counter.

“Whoa, I don’t think you’re allowed to be back there.”

“Boy, aren’t you just on fire with the comedy today?” Hope snipped sarcastically, browsing the prizes before she excitedly perked up and moved across the space. She stopped at a case and slid it open, pulling out a stick like object. “C’mon, let this work…”

I tilted my head in confusion, then moved toward her before my vision was blinded by a bright flash. I blinked a couple times and shielded my eyes before hope finally turned the flashlight on herself, showing off a wild grin of pride.

“We finally have working lights that are brighter than 2 feet!”

“Oh, hell yeah,” I said, moving to her and taking the light across the counter, “Fill your pack with the rest of them in case the batteries run out.” The two of us had tried finding a flashlight in town already, but every triple or double A battery on the shelf has been decomposed into a chalky, corroded mess.

“It’s weird this place isn’t rotten like the outside. I wonder why that is.”

“I don’t know. Although, I’m sure if anything spends enough time in a place like this, it’s bound to get screwed up eventually—”

A loud, abrupt noise across the room made hope and I jump, to which she ducked behind the counter and I instinctively dove for a nearby divider. My body cursed me out with pain as I slammed against the barely padded carpet, and I quickly felt dumb for even doing it in the first place once the noise registered in my head.

Peeking out from our hiding places, Hope and I looked across the room toward the open dining area. A stage built into the wall had its curtain drawn back and upon it, five animatronic animals jerked and pivoted at their post, pretending to strum guitars or pound drums and keyboards. The two of us looked to one another with an almost sheepish expression, then stepping out, starting toward them.

A heavy wave of nostalgia hit me as we drew near. Along the rim of the stage, there were several booths fanning out like sunbeams, and I vividly recall sitting in one of them as a child. My hands gripping the side of the stage and looking up in admiration at the magical characters jamming out. Even as a kid, I knew that they were simply the sorcery of automation, but still, I think I found the concept of a lifelike looking robot so cool and fascinating.

I don’t know what child me was thinking.

Zane and his crew were positively horrific. Their movements were jerky and abrupt, and even over the blaring tunes, I could hear their mechanical parts clicking and whirring as they were puppeted about. Most of the other band members had fallen to the back of my mind over the years; a tiger on the base, an elephant on a massive drum kit in the back, an orangutan playing a keyboard with his feet. Zane had remained, however.

He was almost bigger than I remembered him, most likely a side effect of size being a much more instinctual intimidating factor to an adult than a kid. He stood a little over 7 feet tall. The skeleton that I could see through the gaps of his faux fur pumped with powerful pistons and gears to keep him swiveling and dancing like a rock star, a stark contrast to his friendly outside appearance. His thick neck and elongated face stretched and warped the latex mask over top of it as the zebra sang about friendship and dancing, giving me an uncanny lump in my throat as I stared too long. The lifeless, perfectly round eyes sunken into their sockets that seemed to follow me didn’t help.

The main attraction of Zane, however, and the reason I most likely remembered him so well, was what featured on his torso. He, of course, had stripes like any other zebra, but it was only along his sides, back, mane, and face. His belly was a plain, white canvas. Behind it, the animatronic had been fitted with a small projector inside, and when music began to play, Zane had living stripes that would dance to life across his belly, usually fitting the theme of whatever song he was singing. Looking back on it now, it was honestly really impressive for the time considering how much they fit into a small space, and for how well the effect worked.

Once again, though, through my matured eyes, seeing the ominous glow radiating from Zane’s guts was a little unsettling…

As hope and I stared, the last song of the set began to kick up, and the nostalgia really hit. I remembered this one. Not all of it, but specifically the last part of the chorus. It was so ear-wormy and catchy that even all these years later I still knew the lyrics. When it finally began ringing out, I couldn’t stop my brain from at least humming along to the tune.

*“And if we stick to-geth-er!*

*Then this dance can last for-ev-er!*

*C’mon and dance the night a-way with me!”*

That one probably stuck in my memory cause it was always the last song of the night. When it played, that meant that it was soon time to go home. We didn’t have the luxury of going to a place like this often when I was young—we really couldn’t afford it—but we went enough times for me to feel a sadness in my heart when I left that day on my birthday. There was an extra layer of melancholy that came with it now, as well, knowing that it was the last time I’d ever hear it.

Well, until now, of course.

I couldn’t help but snicker to myself, reflecting in my time away from my old zebra pal, “Trust me, Zane. I tried dancing plenty of nights away. It never helped.”

The instruments drew to a close, and Hope nudged my arm, “We should start moving. We’ve already killed a lot of time.”

She was right. We’d gotten so swept up in all the nostalgia that we completely forgot the mission at hand. Any faint sense of comfort I’d gotten from fond memories quickly faded, and I remembered that we weren’t at the old Jammin’ Jungle’ in Cali right now. We were in a shoddy recreation perched on the edge of an abyss.

Hope and I moved for a set of employee doors that led to the kitchen. We could already see most of the main space and play structures; if there was anything important or Kingfisher related out here, we would have seen it by now.

What the doors swung open to was immediately what broke the immersion of the otherwise flawless place.

It was weird; the space was just like outside. A perfect recreation of what Zane’s kitchen must have looked like. The problem was, it was only half of one. Well, even half might be giving too much.

Imagine, from outside of a doorway, you shined a spotlight into a room. It would make a giant cone of light into the space, the edges of which would be cut off by the doorframe. It was like everything from that perspective existed. There were a couple stove tops, some counters next to them, then nothing on either side of those. Literally nothing. There was a divider wall in the middle of the room with a window to pass food through, some pizza ovens, then a sink that was sliced clean in half by a diagonal line. Even the floor was a perfect expanding beam of tiles that ran across the floor toward the back wall, where the wallpaper then did the same.

Anything that wasn’t in the strange beam from the doorway was just a plain, dark, concrete room.

“What the hell?” I muttered, “Why… why is it like this?”

Hope backed up to the door with a furrowed brow, then stared for a moment. “We just… don’t remember it.”

I turned to her.

“We never went back here as kids, so it doesn’t know how to finish it. We only ever saw through the door.”

I looked down at my feet then stepped slowly to the edge of the kitchen tile, cautiously dipping a toe over the cutoff line. When I saw that it was fine, I muttered, “Weird…”

Other than the odd spatial anomaly, there was nothing really to note inside the kitchen other than a dark doorway in the wall. It was on one of the unfinished walls of the room, and shining one of our new flashlights into it only revealed a space too vast for the beam to illuminate anything. We’d need to go deeper.

Hope and I considered going back and looking into other parts of the building; after all, there were dozens of other employee doors to look into. We hadn’t seen those areas as children either, however, and if Hope’s theory was correct, they’d most likely all look pretty similar to the kitchen. Besides, I think both of us were curious what lay in these dank, unfinished parts of the structure.

What lay through the door was a brutalist marvel. A massive room that towered off into darkness made entirely of dull, coarse concrete. Pillars sprouted from below and moved up to hold an unseen roof above, but honestly, I couldn’t even be certain they started from a floor. The doorway led out onto a platform suspended between two of them, and following down with my eyes, they moved unseen into a void below us. Shining my light down into it, I couldn’t help but think about the shadowy ocean beyond the shelf outside.

The platform continued forward into the dark, curving off at one point to some stairs that led up, then continued along a second bridge. Hope and I silently nodded to one another before trudging onward, single file.

The platform was large, nearly ten feet in width, so it’s not like we needed to balance super carefully. Still, there were no railings, and I don’t think either of us wanted to know what waited in the depths below.

The space was dreadfully eerie as we moved through, our scuffing feet on the concrete the only sound echoing through the massive chamber. That, and the ominous droning of air humming through such a large enclosed space. The worst part was the thought of what could be lurking above or below us in such a place. Things climbed the cliffs outside easily, I’m sure the walls in here would pose no challenge. And if something did attack us, we were in a very precarious situation to escape.

There was another path that Hope and I noticed when we reached the stairs that continued forward, so we had to decide which way we were going. Mentally mapping the space out (a probably fruitless effort considering this place clearly didn’t follow normal physics) I surmised that the path ahead was only going to take us to where the back halls of Zane’s would normally be. The stairs, on the other hand, were leading away from the direction of the main building, which was the far more intriguing option.

If the playhouse was only occupying ‘the rig’ or whatever this structure really was, I wanted to get to the heart of it.

Cautiously, we tiptoed up the steps of the new bridge, holding each other’s wrist the whole time in case one of us should lose balance. Once we reached the top, another long platform waited, but it seemed that we chose right. We could each make out a light shining in the dark all the way against the wall where the path led.

Another long walk began as my head continued its swivel. This was all seeming too easy so far. There was really nothing here… I think I had been so put off by the idea of a place from my past being here that I may have overly besmirched it in my head. This was a place that the scientists here must have operated in frequently, given their work, after all. Why wouldn’t it be safe? Especially since the tower outside had been beast proofed; maybe there was nothing to worry about after all.

Looking back, I wish I could have slapped myself for that thought.

Soon, the light came into view, and Hope and I could see that it was some sort of keypad to a door. Unlike the one we’d just passed through a bit ago, this one actually had a steel blast barrier covering its opening.

On approach, I clenched my fist in frustration, not going to be happy that we’d run into yet another dead end in all of this. The more the small door reader came into view, however, the more relief I felt. It was a keycard lock, not a number pad this time, and better yet, the green LED on it was let up instead of the red one. It was already unlocked.

Hope gave the whole thing a scan with her flashlight, spotting the Kingfisher logo on the door as well as something else interesting. Cables and chords neatly tacked into the wall, running from the doorframe and off into the darkness toward where we’d just come from. They looked awfully similar to the ones that ran out of the radio tower back at home base.

Without another moment of delay, I reached forward and pressed the button on the card reader. No point in beating around the bush.

Hope and I jumped, then shot our heads back at the darkness behind us as the door gave a lurch, then noisily began to grind along its rusty rails. The animatronics may have been making noise this whole time, but this was new noise, and anything in here with us would certainly be drawn to it.

We jetted through once it was open far enough for us to fit inside, my eyes inspecting the nearly foot thick steel as we passed. Considering the one in the cliff was double the size of this one, any hopes I had of blasting through it was dashed in that moment.

Once through, we resumed our lookout, praying that nothing was going to step into the beams of our flashlights. When the door finally halted with a loud, *ka-thud!,* I hastily pressed the pad on the other side to seal it once again. Only then did we finally take in the room we’d stepped into.

It was lit in here, not by any overheads or bulbs, though. The room was the same hollow, plain concrete, only much more homey and clean. The stone was polished and smooth, and around the rim of the ceiling, a small crack with inlaid light strips cast a soft glow to the entire space. Ahead, there was a ‘U’ shaped spot with computers and terminals, all similar in their retro-modern style to the ones at the station. Steps on either side of the control center led down to a lowered section of the room, some sort of massive machine taking up the entire wall opposite to us.

An ominous, deep buzz filled the space as we moved farther into it, signifying a lot of power being either pumped into or out of there.

Hope and I were quick to go to the computers, the main source of any information, but something quickly took precedence first. Hope let out a gasp that made me jump, and I turned to where she was looking.

At the head of the room, where the large wall of tech was, there was a disturbingly gruesome sight. I had no idea what the machine was supposed to be, the whole thing an incomprehensible mass of tubes, cables, and power boxes. I could gauge enough about it and its layout, however, to know that the fancy, illuminated hole in the middle of the device must have been where some sort of core or fuse went to run the machine. The port was large, almost looking like the gate of an MRI machine, and there was a massive, metallic cylinder with dozens of ports drilled into it rolled haphazardly to the corner of the room. It looked like it was a perfect fit before it was ripped out.

There wasn’t a new one inside the machine, however. There was only an empty hole that a body had been stuffed into, their legs dangling out and blood trickling down to form a puddle on the ground beneath them.

“Holy shit…” I muttered.

“A-Are they dead?” Hope asked.

“Well, they don’t seem alive.” I returned.

Hope turned and moved for the stairs, but I remained up top, transfixed on the sight for a while before finally pulling my gaze down to one of the computers; a central monitor aligned with the machine. It had a bunch of numbers and percentages listed, the terms for which I didn’t understand. The two that I could, however, was power and stability, the former being very high while the latter looked to be dangerously low.

A warning flashed at the bottom that read *‘Malfunction detected: Cell unstable’.*

“Holy crap, Hen, she’s still alive!” Hope gasped up to me, jarring me from my trance. My eyes shot down to her, staring at me in desperation.

“What?” I said in disbelief.

“Get down here—she’s still breathing!”

I did so quickly, moving to the other staircase that Hope hadn’t used. As I did, I noticed something on the floor; a puddle of blood formed at the top that smeared down the steps before joining into the puddle before the machine.

Hope reached up to caress the poor woman's legs, then nodded to her other side, “quick! Help me get her out!”

As I obeyed, I quickly learned she was right. The woman was alive, her pale, drained body trembling softly with each hoarse breath she took. She seemed unconscious.

Hope and I grunted as we gently began to tug her out, but that’s when we met resistance. There were cables jammed into her that we hadn’t noticed, ones that stretched out from the core of the machine and followed her to the ground as we pulled her out.

It made my skin shiver to look at her like that. there were nine in total, to in her thighs, stomach, and ribs respectively. The last three were the most sickening, however. Two were tapped into the corners of her eyes closest the nose leaking blood down her face like black tears. The last one was buried somewhere in the back of her head just where the spine meets the skull.

“What the fuck…” I muttered, swallowing hard.

“S-Should we take them out?” Hope asked with panic, “W-What if that kills her?”

“That honestly might be a mercy at this point,” I said unable to breathe.

Gingerly, I moved my hand to one by her rib and gave it a tug. It came out with little resistance. Revealing a long, silver needle at the end. The body jolted and gasped, but didn’t speak or open their half-lidded eyes. I’m not even sure they could with the cables there…

Hope began helping me pluck the remainder out, but couldn’t look when I took each optic chord in my hand and gave them a tug. The noise they made upon coming out just about made me puke, and the whimpering groan that the girl released hurt me more inside than out. Finally, I looked at Hope before reaching around her neck, my hands now coated in blood, then yanking the last chord out.

The woman gasped awake with a start, her breaths sounding wet and fluid filled. She instantly began flailing her hands around, looking for anything to hold on to before finally feeling our legs to either side of her. Hope quickly lay a hand over top of hers, then gently began to coo.

“Shh! It’s okay! You’re okay now! We got you.”

“D-D-Dr. Shae?” the woman gurgled desperately.

Hope and I made eye contact. She was Kingfisher.

“N-No,” Hope smiled her best, “My name is Hope. We just—”

“I-I can’t see… I can’t see anything—why can’t I see?” the woman cried, beginning to panic.

Hope squeezed her hand while I pressed gently to her shoulders, trying to keep her from hurting herself in the fray, “You’re hurt. Just try to relax.”

“W-Where am I?” the woman asked.

“We found you in that machine,” Hope answered, “Um, Rig 1, I think you call it?”

“Rig?” the woman pondered, her voice ready to break any second, “N-No… no that’s not… I didn’t—”

Just then, an alarm began to go off on one of the computers upstairs, sharp and repetitive. I couldn’t read what it was, obviously, but I could see the monitor rapidly flashing red. At once, the room began to sway.

I don’t mean rumble, like a tremor, I mean *sway.* It was like the room was being held up by wires, and somebody was swinging it back and forth like a pendulum. Hope and I stayed low as not to be knocked over by it, and the woman was so unresponsive that she didn’t seem to care, but as soon as it had come, it stopped, and things were still once more.

The alarm didn’t stop though, it just kept blaring. My concern becoming too much to bear, I jumped up and ran for the monitors. Slamming my hands to the sides of the computer to stop myself, I peered down at the screen, its red glow stinging my eyes.

*‘Manifestation unstable; Evacuate immediately.’*

“Hope we need to go,” I called down to her in panic.

“What about her?” She asked, still holding our new friend’s hand.

“Get her up; we’ll carry her,” I said.

“Can you walk?” Hope asked the woman as I ran back down to her.

She didn’t respond, but thankfully, she cooperated as me and my clone pulled her to her feet and propped an arm under each shoulder.

The answer was that she could barely. She dragged her feet along instinctually as we moved across the flat terrain, but once we hit stairs, it was all on Hope and I to get her up. Part of me wondered if this was simply a lost cause; she’d already lost a lot of blood and was clearly near catatonic. She was probably going to die even if we did help her. Still, my conscience wouldn’t let me just leave her, no matter how much danger we might be in.

Besides, we came here for info, and who could give us more insight than a kingfisher scientist themselves.

I reached out and jammed my thumb into the keypad button, then Hope and I panted as we waited for it to open. The alarm blaring behind us was only building my anxiety as the door dramatically slid open, but it stopped completely when I saw the other side.

Gone was the ominous stone obelisk we had been inside a moment ago. There was no more darkness or pillars or bridges suspended in the air. Instead, Zane’s had come to find us.

The room was the jammin’ jungle again, but it wasn’t the original we’d entered through when we got here. We were standing in the balcony part of the arcade, but where the room should have ended in a wall, the whole space mirrored itself and stretched backward again, trees, arcade cabinets and all. Any walls that did exist were crooked or turned the wrong direction, where another copy of Zane’s main floor would be pasted again and run off in another path.

That was just the tame parts. Some prize counter walls rose far higher than they should, their merchandise repeating in the perfectly same pattern. When I looked off the balcony to my right, I could see several repeating floors going down for an amount of stories that I couldn’t even count. Lights were shined upward into our faces, fake flora was strung where it didn’t belong, and the music that once filled the place was now looping one single tune for ten seconds at a time before repeating.

It was overstimulating, wild, and downright maddening. If we were going to get out of here, we needed to do so fast before we got lost.

The issue was, we didn’t know where to begin. Hope and I frantically looked around for the entrance where we’d come in from, but we weren’t seeing it among the mural'd walls and the fake trees. Our only option was to start moving.

We began dragging the woman along hurriedly, our eyes darting frantically for not only an exit, but any threat that might be out there. The space was too big, filled with so many abstract shapes and animatronics that everything suddenly became something hunting us. I can’t explain it because nowhere like it exists on earth, but being alone in a place so vast and large—it’s imposing. Like the whole thing is looking down on you, ready to strike.

As we moved, still no closer to finding a way out, I finally realized an inconsistency. There was no stage. No matter how many times the building copy and pasted, the animatronic stage with Zane and his friends was nowhere to be seen. Maybe that meant that it had simply been overwritten by the rest of the structures' clutter, but if it didn’t, then that meant it was the only defining feature that’d be near the exit.

I hit the brakes, then passed the scientist off to hope, jumping onto a nearby table and scanning around.

“Do you see anything?” she asked.

My eyes took in every detail as I pivoted around, silently praying under my breath. My pleas were answered when, finally, I caught the top of the beige painted wall that the stage was built into, the hints of its red curtains just barely peeking out.

Wordlessly, I jumped down and began dragging Hope and the woman toward it.

We weaved between arcade machines and tables, keeping the stage always in my vision, no matter where we turned. We finally reached the clearing of tables for the dining area that the stage overlooked, and I was never so happy to see so many horrifying animatronics staring back at me. That joy lasted for only a few moments, however, before I took in every detail of the stage.

Hope wasn’t looking; she was too busy spotting the wall that read, ‘*Come jam again soon!’* Above it. The exit, just a couple of building lengths away.

“Over there!” she cried over the maddening music.

“Hope,” I asked her, my gut screaming that something was wrong, “Where is Zane?”

She looked at me with a puzzled expression before her eyes turned to where I was looking and the color drained from her face.

*“And if we stick—if we stick—if we stick—!”*

The tune came screaming from over the cabinets a few rows away from us, and we ducked low fast.

Above the machines and moving toward us, there was a beam of light violently jerking and flashing around. The tune cut eventually, and the air was filled with a harsh crackle of broken audio. Various pops and snips from the song would eventually break through, but they were mostly suffocated by static until finally, they erupted at once. It was like all parts of the song had built up into one instant before every lyric and instrument unleashed in an unholy scream.

The light was getting closer. We had to move. As fast as we could, we shuffled for the other side of the dining area. I kept my head focused on the pursuer, trying to keep its position pinned, but like an idiot, I accidentally collided with a chair. It screeched across the floor with a loud scuff, and the beast behind us definitely heard it.

A sharp sound like microphone feedback filled the air, and the spotlight snapped in our direction, its beam just barely cresting the top of a skeeball wall.

*“Dance the night away—dance the night away—dance—"*

The whole tune once again blared out in an ear shattering instant as the creature moved faster in our direction.

“it’s unstable…” I noticed the scientist muttering in a daze, “I-It’s unstable…”

My brain ran quick calculations on the situation; the speed we were dragging her, the distance to the door, and how fast we were being pursued. There was no chance we were going to make it, not while carrying this woman.

That left two options.

The first was to drop her. Leave her to whatever fate was in store when getting caught by this thing. She was already basically dead, after all; was it really immoral to leave an already dying woman to save ourselves who had much better odds?

The thought actually scared me as soon as it popped into my head. It didn’t feel like me. Fight or flight really is an insane thing when staring down the barrel of a gun. I knew it was life or death, but, Jesus… How could it come to mind so fast? As if *I* wasn’t an already dying woman, and as if my odds weren’t any better than her’s once we got out of this place.  

It was even worse when my head snapped to Hope and I saw holding the woman for dear life. She wasn’t about to let her go, not for anything. She was going to go down hauling her to the finish line, or not at all. How had she come from me? She was so much better. So much more patient and kind and caring. Hope was ten times the person I was, and I *was* her. What did that say about me, then?

For all the stress of the situation, my brain found time to think.

I thought about what Hope had talked to me about back at the vending machines. About what we were going to do when we got out of here. I thought about how much easier things would be if only one of us walked out.

I thought about how that one didn’t deserve to be me.

We were here because I dragged us both, plain and simple. If Hope had the wheel before we got here, we would have never ended up in this abyss. She would have answered the phone when Trevor called. She would have told Dad about the cancer before she left.

She wouldn’t have run from it in the first place.

I already had my shot at life, and I’d blown it. Hope was my better half, and if anyone deserved to make it home, it was her.

Which brought me to option two. Get Hope out of here alive.

I dropped the stranger's arm from my shoulder and took a large step back. Hope looked at me with panic, and I just stared back sternly.

“Get her out of here. I’ll find a way back around,” I loosely promised her before turning on my heels.

“Hensley!” she called, lurching for me with her free hand. It was in vain, however. I was already gone.

Despite my brain’s resistance, I forced myself to run toward the horrific sound of childhood nightmares. I was heading for a third spot that led out of the dining area when the creature I was running from finally came around the corner.

Zane was no longer the child friendly zebra that I had once known him to be. His fur and outer suit had gone rotten and yellow stained. It sagged off his metal bones like loose skin, torn in places and tattered beyond recognition in others. The lifeless eyes that had once been sunken into the mask were no longer visible, and the holes there were only gaping abysses. The skin around the sockets sagged deeply, giving his eyes a pained, tragic quality, and the way his jaw hung loosely from its joints made him look frozen in an eternal scream.

That was just his suit, though.

Beneath was much more horrific. Gone was the metal bones that held Zane up; he was a creature of flesh and blood now. Tumorous, bumpy skin bubbled up from between the cracks in his joints and the tears in his fabric. It was cut to pieces and leaking pus from trying to grow through the hard framework of the beast. Stringy red bits of flesh hung from his all too human teeth, and I swore I could see the fingers of human hands clawing through the panels of the suits in some places.

The projector that once was hidden in Zane’s torso was now crooked in his nest of fleshy guts, the stomach of his fabric torso torn open and shining it around like a searchlight.

I was nearly frozen with dread as he charged into the space in a far too fluid manor, but I caught Hope frantically looking over her shoulder out of my peripheral. I could tell she hadn’t wanted to leave me, but she wasn’t going to waste the chance I’d given her—she didn’t have a choice. I couldn’t waste it either.

“Hey!” I yelled to the dying mascot.

Zane’s body jerked harshly toward me, *“Last forever—this dance can—”*

I turned to start running, but then something odd happened. I saw the light from the projector behind me shine against the cabinets ahead, and then everything began to hurt. Every bone, muscle and bit of tissue in my body began screaming out in agony as the beam fell onto my back, as if it were cooking my insides or something far worse.

I couldn’t stop a cry of pain from escaping my lips, and I tried to will my weak limbs to keep moving. It was by adrenaline alone that I could. I limped for the corner as I heard the zebra’s heavy steps behind me, my heart pounding along with them. As soon as I cleared the aisle, instant relief flooded me, and I took off running again.

It didn’t last long, though. Zane was fast, almost moving human like, and I was barely to the end of the lane when he spun the corner again. Once more, pain shot through me, nausea flooded my stomach, and my legs felt weak. I was mid step as it happened, and though I tried to stop it, my leg bucked from under me and I came crashing forward onto the ground.

*“With me—forever—with me—”* Zane’s speaker hissed and popped as he drew closer.

‘Get up!’ my brain screamed as I pressed my hands to the neon carpet and pushed. My muscles wailed in agony beneath the shifting light, however, and it felt like there were a million pounds laying on my back that I couldn’t shake off.

A blast of audio erupted behind me, alerting my ringing ears that Zane was close behind. I continued to fight to my feet, but it was more a courtesy to Hope than anything. My eyes were closed, and my teeth were gritted, preparing for the worst.

I felt a strong, unflinching hand grab my hood and part of my hair, wrenching me backward and tossing me hard against a claw machine. The glass shattered, and my ass fell inside, resting on a nest of stuffed animals and broken shards. My eyes opened to see Zane standing before me, his hollow sockets burning more than his projector now. He leaned close and lowered himself to my level, tilting his rotting head like a curious dog.

The voice box in his stomach screamed again as I saw his mouth drop open wider. Fingers covered in blue latex gloves inched out of the dark maw, clawing the sides of his cheeks to keep his mouth open wide. A squelch came from the back of his throat, and from within, a red, fleshy tentacle began to slither out, a rancid, pungent smell filling the air.

I whimpered to myself and leaned away in horror, not ready for whatever came next, but trying to accept it nevertheless. The appendage was only inches away, and I closed my eyes again when—

“*Grrahh!”* I heard a violent scream come from our left.

I opened my eyes just in time to see the machine next to us come tumbling over, smashing into Zane and sending him to the floor, pinned. Hope fell into view, huffing and panting after having just leveraged the thing down using the planter behind it.

Before I could even make a sound, she jumped up and grabbed my jacket, yanking me out of the machine and to the floor. I hopped up easy without Zane’s light punishing me back down, but the zebra clearly wasn’t out yet. His speaker screamed profanities in the form of children’s songs, and he thrashed violently to shake the heavy game box off of him.

Hope and I didn’t wait to see if he could. We took off for the exit fast, stopping only by the entrance to pick the dying woman up that Hope had left sitting on the front lobby bench, Zane smiling smugly at us.

Once outside, we didn’t stop. It was a blur as we made our way back to the radio tower. Thank God the light was still off…

When we got inside, we took our new member up to the offices and lay her down on my pile of cushions, doing our best to cover her wounds with pressure. Hope and I didn’t speak a word to one another the entire time; just gasped and panted, our hearts never slowing down. I was relieved after ten minuets when we still hadn’t heard any signs that Zane had followed us out.

When they finally did, and when we were content with our patch-up job on the woman, Hope spared me a glance, and I looked back at her shamefully. I couldn’t read the look in her eyes, if she’d felt betrayed for almost being left alone or if she was just worried about me. Either way, it fell to the back burner when a violent wave of nausea overtook me. I buckled over onto my hands, to which Hope crawled quickly to me in comfort. She backed away fast, however, when I threw up all over the carpet.

I thought it was just the stress finally releasing until I saw that it was mostly blood, a fleshy wad of meat laying right in the center.

I need to rest, but I’m safe and alive. I’ll update you all more once I’m feeling better, but if the thing laying on the ground next to me is what I think it is, I might have to take some time to get her adjusted first.

I’m happy to be alive, but we didn’t really get to learn much in that rig, and I don’t think we’re going to easily be able to go back now. I have more questions now than ever, and hopefully this poor scientist we saved can answer them when she wakes up.

Well… if she wakes up, I suppose…

I’ll talk to you all soon.
