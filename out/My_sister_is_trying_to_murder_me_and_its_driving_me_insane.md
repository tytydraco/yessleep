So this is a bit of a long story but I need to post this because I'm genuinely losing my collective shit over it.

I (21 M) have had a rough life, I was tossed around between family members until I was 9, at which point I was handed over my biological father because my caretaker at the time was old and had many health issues that made it impossible to take care of me.

For the sake of privacy I'll just refer to others as a letter.

My father (K) abused me and my other siblings (V), (A), and (R) for years. Wether it be physical violence, intimidation, exposure to inappropriate shit, sexual assault on my sisters that I was forced to watch, blackmail, and anything else you could imagine along with being extremely sheltered and ripped away from sociality all while being homeless for six of those ten long years.

Eventually we moved into a house but the abuse continued in mental forms worse than ever before. We moved in during the start of the pandemic and because of dumb shit I had no chance to get out of that house like I'd wanted since the very moment I started living with them.

Eventually around my 20th birthday I managed to move in with a friend and became homeless all over again because they screwed me over. At the time my older brother (R) was living across the country and he offered to let come stay with him.

I had to fight for months to get back on my feet and get the money to do so, eventually a few months later I got it and bought a plane ticket to go stay with my brother (R, 22) and his aunt.

Sometime during this I heard my father had been put in prison for something heinous and that he wouldn't be getting out anytime soon, celebrating this news my brother and I went and bought some stuff to celebrate with.

Unfortunately this setup didn't last long within two weeks I had a horrible ear infection so bad I was crippled by it essentially, my brother put his hands on me because I was crying from the pain, and when I fought back I was the bad guy so I got kicked out and dropped off in front of the homeless shelter I would then stay at for the next couple of months.

This is about the time I got in contact with my biological mother, all my life my fathers side of my family tree had told me that she was a horrible person, in reality those were lies. They just simply didn't like her, which is why when my abusive father chased her around the country after she left him, she had no choice but to ask them to take me in for a while, she'd never heard back from them after.

My mom was overjoyed at the thought of me coming to live with the family and immediately invited me to come stay, I quickly got my shit together and made it across the country where they would then pick me up and drive me home.

Now this is where the real story begins and I warn you it gets a tad disturbing ...

When I moved in it was at the very beginning of last year around the beginning to middle of January, I moved into a building on the back of the property with my little brother (C) who was 18 at the time, now don't get me wrong the building we sleep in is not by any means glamorous. It has toilet or shower and we both kind of share a space so there's not a lot of privacy either but it's big enough for the both of us.

In the house we have mom, our stepdad, our sister (A, 17) and our stepbrother who visits from his mom's house occasionally.
There's also like 18 pets on the property (at the time) so it's a very full house.

The moment I got here my mom and dad started telling how how manipulative and psychotic my sister is and it's worse than they made it out to be honestly. She's a liar, a thief, a slut (brings home random guys to smash in her bedroom), and loves to make up drama and shit just to make others have a hard time for her own entertainment.

Now I could go on to a whole tangent about the shit that she's gotten into but for the sake of this story I'm not going to drag it on. 

My Mom finally kicked her out on Christmas after a year of making all of our lives hell, and screwing us over so badly that my stepdad had to take a job that offered so much money just so we could repair our losses. The job came at the cost of him being at home pretty much at all.

The eviction process was ... strange ...

She was told to leave and not come back to which she did however she was told she could come by to grab her things, the first time nothing went amiss, however the second time things went horribly, she kidnapped one of our cats and when the police came by they literally told us they couldn't stop her from taking the cat, we then had a family friend deliver the rest of her things to her at her boyfriend's house in boxes.

She also stole my brother's set of keys, we know this because a keychain accessory of his was found in the yard, torn off from the lanyard. Luckily because of an argument between me and my brother he had put the house's key on a separate lanyard which she didn't take, however she has the key to the building we live in and to shed way In the back. 

I don't know why she hates our mom but it makes no sense when her mom has done nothing but spoil her for her whole life. She's a spoiled little brat and ungrateful as all hell, personally I can't stand her because of the company she keeps, her choice making skills, and her attitude most of all.

To put things into context she's the type of person that when a sound bothers her, she will literally start to try to put her hands on you to make you stop whatever it is you're doing.
This could include anything as simple as mashing buttons on a controller or just chewing ... The fact that she will literally make you not eat around her and starve yourself just so she doesn't have to hear the noise is fucking ridiculous ...

I'm dead serious, she will put her hands on someone over it, she is actually psychotic and doesn't give a shit.

Not long after she was evicted my younger brother who was now 19 at this point went off to a college program where he is staying in a dorm now, and right about here is where I get into the part that's really driving me insane.

For the last month and a half, I have been living in this building in the back, all alone.

At first it was strange things that were happening, like stuff going missing or the shed door being found hung wide open. Of course my parents were pissed and thought I was doing it but I wasn't doing any of this shit. I just thought it weird or maybe that they had forgotten they had done it, but something about it didn't make sense.

I just dismissed most of these things that went on for the first month that she was gone but after that things became ... creepy and fucking strange.

February was when it was just me and my mom, my dad's out driving truck for a living, my brother's 400 miles away at his college and my stepbrother is 200 miles away at his mom's house. My mom works really long night shifts at her job almost every night so most nights it's just me at home alone, and I take care of the animals and make myself dinner.

Now by Nature I'm a very paranoid person, but this just gets disturbing really quickly ... Around the beginning of February I started to hear things throughout the night that would wake me up. Like the crunching of leaves outside, now I would just assume that it's the two outside cats that we have but this just does not make sense.

We have a lot of leaves in our backyard and if it was a cat then maybe I'd hear one or two crunches but I was hearing several crunches at once off in the distance as if someone was walking around, obviously this creeped me out but not enough to make a big deal out of it, the creepy part was that it would happen around 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning when everyone was dead asleep.

There were a couple times I asked my mom about it but she just said that I'm hearing things and that I'm getting too paranoid, I believed her for about a week until something truly disturbing happened, I woke up one night in a cold sweat and this time the noises were much louder as if someone was walking around the building I was sleeping in.

I tiptoed over to the door and quietly unlocked it before throwing it open and the moment I did I locked eyes with someone I did not recognize, it was the crack of dawn and at about 6:00 a.m. The sun hadn't even come out but there was just barely some light permeating the sky.

The guy was a shorter guy and he looked bald and had a mustache, he looked bewildered for a split second and the moment that he realized that I had caught him he bolted, he was also wearing a gray hoodie and some khaki pants and instead of going toward the front gate that he could easily jump over he went towards the back of the property. I'm guessing maybe he went through the woods because they get pretty thick back there and we would not have easily been able to chase after him.

I stood there like a deer in headlights and didn't shut the door for another 5 seconds before realizing "oh shit there was a guy there" and that he did not belong here.

Obviously I let everyone know and people were on the lookout but the guy did not return however I think he was skulking out the property looking for stuff that was possible to steal, a couple nights later after everything had simmered down from that situation another one showed its face.

My Mom's wallet suddenly went missing, now she didn't blame me for this one because she knew where she put it but it was just missing ... She was freaking out and honestly I don't blame her.

My mom had to replace her wallet and replace every card inside of it, some of the cards inside of it were irreplaceable and held memories so obviously it was hard on her to lose it but I know that pain because I lost mine at one point as well.

I've lost things that were super important to me before as well so I know the feeling but it was still horrible for her.

Unfortunately the noises outside would continue that night and every night following but I don't think it was the same guy.

Eventually I would start putting my brother on the phone every time I went outside at night because it was dark and our back porch light went out recently so I couldn't see very well.

But as if on que every night at about 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning I would start hearing noises outside and honestly looking back some of them make my skin crawl.

One of the more recent cases was when I heard really loud bangs on the front door of the house, now you have to think about this from my perspective, from my bed in the building in the back yard, to the front door is about 300 ft in distance and yet I still heard these bangs like they were right on the wall because they were just that loud. Obviously I was spooked so I called up my brother and I called the neighbor at the same time on my two phones in order to figure out if the neighbor did it while also simultaneously getting my brother on the phone as a witness.

I was quite evidently spooked and that's when I heard it while talking to my brother quietly on the phone and pretending no one was home in case it was a burglar, I heard the jingle of keys ...

I recognized that jingle, it was the same sound my brother's lanyard used to make, whoever it was have the keys to the building, it was my sister.

When I realized she was out there I started putting things together in my head like everything that had gone missing and the random strange occurrences that had gone on, on the property ever since she'd been evicted, she knew where we lived and it wouldn't have been hard for her to get back here either with her boyfriend's car.

I called the police at this point because I heard what sounded like the click of a gun. Now my sister does not own a firearm, but her boyfriend's family has many, and when I say many I mean ALOT of guns.

I'm convinced at this point my sister was planning on breaking into the house to kill my mom and when that didn't work she came to the back building to steal whatever was in here and kill me.

She's stolen stuff before and sold it, it wouldn't be the first time, however it would be the first time she's tried to kill somebody but at the same time she's a cold-hearted monster of a human being and I don't put it past her.

Ever since then I've noticed strange things even more than I had before like when things go missing or when things are how they shouldn't be and I always question my mom about it to make sure she didn't do it but in my mind I know who did it.

Now you could argue we should get security cameras but that wouldn't do much because in the 15 minutes she could use to kill somebody the cops won't even be here yet, we live out in the boonies so it's hard for them to get out here and we don't have our own police station anymore.

Last night was the creepiest and when I said nope I'm done which is why I'm posting the story here, I don't typically use Reddit because some of the people on here can be pretty toxic but at this point I'm desperate for help.

Last night at about a quarter after 3:00 I woke up to my brother's cat on my face licking me awake and that's when I noticed a big glaring problem ... When I go to sleep I prefer the area to be pretty dark ... No phone screens on no TV screens no computer monitors nothing ... But across the room my brother's TV was on and I hadn't used it in days ... It gets worse though.

You could argue that the cat might have stepped on the power button on the remote, but here's the thing, even if he did it wouldn't turn on the TV. The TV is very finicky and you have to point the remote directly at it which is tilted at an angle that is almost impossible to hold at.

So now I do not believe the cat turned on the TV because of one more clue, MY FUCKING DOOR WAS UNLOCKED!!!

I always lock that door no matter the circumstance especially if I'm going to sleep and to find it unlocked like that was just violating. 

I'm honestly terrified my sister and her boyfriend are trying to kill me ... I can't get help from the police because I would just be wasting their time and I don't want to worry my mom who is safe for the time being because my sister doesn't have a key to the house.

But they have the key to the place I sleep in and quite evidently they are able to unlock it so I don't know what to do anymore, I'm losing sleep over this and I'm terrified every moment of the night, somebody please help me because it's quite literally driving me insane.
