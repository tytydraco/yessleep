**I've always been a sound sleeper, never having trouble falling asleep or waking up in the middle of the night. But that all changed a few weeks ago when I found the box.**



**I stumbled upon an old, ornate wooden box with strange carvings on the lid tucked away in the back of my closet behind a small door. I had never noticed the door before, let alone the box just inside. As I surveyed the box, I finally decided to open it despite feeling hesitant. Inside, I found a small, intricately carved whistle made of something pristinely white, possibly bone. The whistle had a strange, pungent smell like it was freshly carved.** 

**The design was confusing; it was just a small whistle, but carved into it were images of woodland animals: a fox, a bear, and what I assumed was a deer. The animals all looked normal except the deer, which was up on its hind legs. I found it very odd, but possibly the carver was just running out of space. When I picked it up, I felt an inexplicable sense of unease. Something about the whistle didn't feel right.**



**Despite my reservations, I decided to keep the whistle. I put it back in the box and closed the lid, thinking that was the end of it.**



**But it wasn't.**



**The first time it happened, I woke up in the kitchen, with no memory of how I got there. I stood by the sink, staring out the window into the darkness. I had no idea what I was doing there, or how I had gotten out of bed. I stumbled back to my room, feeling disoriented and scared.**



**It kept happening. I would wake up in strange places, with no memory of how I got there. I would find myself standing in the middle of the living room, staring at the TV. I would wake up in the bathroom, with the shower running and no memory of turning it on.**



**I began to feel like I was losing my mind. I couldn't sleep or eat, and I was constantly on edge, waiting for the next episode to happen. Then, I started to notice something strange. I would find odd marks on my body, such as scratches or bites, and my clothes would be torn or dirty with no memory of how it happened.**



**That's when I started to suspect that something was seriously wrong. I was sleepwalking, but it was more than that. I was doing things while I was asleep, things that I couldn't remember.**



**I had a doctor's appointment scheduled for the following week. When the date came, I told the doctor about my sudden sleepwalking issue and the strange places I had woken up in. He asked if I had been taking any new medications that could be causing this.**

 **I told him no, and he nodded and told me he would write me a prescription that might help. He prescribed something called Estazolam. I took the medicine that night. To my horror, it made the sleepwalking worse. That night, I woke up nude standing at the edge of the woods behind my house.** 

**I was shocked and embarrassed as I ran back to my house. The house was still locked, and I frantically looked around until I noticed the living room window was open. I climbed back through, face-planting on the floor. I gathered myself and got back to my feet. Standing in the living room, I noticed something odd. The box from the closet was on the coffee table open.** 



**My heart dropped as I staggered over to the box and looked inside. The whistle was gone! Where could it have gone? Had I taken it with me on my naked jaunt to the woods? I had so many questions and zero answers. As the days and weeks dragged on I tried my hardest not to sleep, However after a few days of not sleeping time did this horrible thing where it seemed to stop and hallucinations took over. It started small seeing shadows in my peripherals, and then I could feel the shadows watching me.** 



**Eventually, the shadows no longer hide themselves and just stand there. Mocking you as if you can't see them. I couldn't hold out any longer and that evening I took the medicine the doctor had given me and passed out on the couch. That evening I didn't sleepwalk but, I had what I would call a dream but, it felt more like a memory. I could see myself standing nude at the edge of the woods.** 

**In front of me was a shadow, I call it a shadow because in the dream I couldn't recall its face only it was tall and thin with pale skin covered by what appeared to be animal hides. In the memory, I could see myself handing the thing whatever it was the whistle. I could see it touch my mouth with its long pale finger and blow the whistle. The sound it made was so horrifying like a train whistle but, more like screams many screams and loud, So loud that it woke me up!**



**That morning I could feel it inside me, crawling under my skin. I could feel its presence.**



**I'm writing this now, trying to make sense of what's happening to me. I know that I'm not myself anymore.**



**I don't know how much longer I can resist. I can feel it growing stronger, taking over more and more of my mind and body.**



**I'm trapped in my own skin, unable to escape.**



**I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to hold on. Its is getting stronger, and I'm getting weaker.**



**I'm not sure what will happen next. But I know that it won't be good.**
