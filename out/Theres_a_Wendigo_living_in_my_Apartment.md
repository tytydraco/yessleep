Ok, let me start by saying I’m *not* Native American and have been relying on Google and Wikipedia for my research. That being said, I’m pretty fucking sure there is a Wendigo living in my apartment building. 



It sounds nuts, I know, but there it is. I first got suspicious when I heard someone had started renting 9G in my high-rise.  9G is a notorious apartment. Its so notorious that if you live in the same city as me, you now know what building I live in. It’s been vacant about seven years now, since some Dahmer wannabe was caught there with a kitchen full of corpses.



They had to drop the price of every unit after that. Which is why I moved there. It made the place affordable for someone bussing tables. Of course the whole thing creeped me out, but I figured there’d already been one serial killer there. What were the odds on two? 



I moved into 9C and the whole 9th floor smelled real funky for the first few weeks I was there.



“It’s dead bodies.” My neighbor, Ninety, informed me. I still don’t know his real name. I call him Ninety because he lives in 9D and looked like he was, well, you get it. He used to call me Stevie, because he said it was a wonder I had a job with the way I looked. 



“They’ve cleaned the place twice. Too cheap-ass to replace the floors. Soaks in ‘em. Can’t ever get the smell out after that.” Ninety had shook his head. He said it as if he had experience. That’s when I decided it was best to stay on his good side. Eventually they gutted the whole unit, sorry, and the smell went away.



I mention it because that was the absolute worst thing I’d ever smelled, until about a week after the new tenant moved in. At first I thought it was the same smell of death, but it wasn’t. There was something frigid and moist all at once in this new smell, like you were taking in lungfuls of a rotting deer on a winter’s night. I started leaving my window open for fresh air, sitting out on the fire escape to avoid it. Then, as it got colder, I got candles and incense.



“You some sorta witch now, Stevie.” Ninety asked when I first started lighting them. He’d been in the hall, glaring down at 9G which is how he spent a lot of his time. 



“No, just trying to get rid of that smell.”



Ninety took a deep breath in. “Like a week-dead bison by Old Faithful in midwinter.” He spat on the hall carpet, thick and yellowy. “Brew some coffee and be a man.” Then he’d gone back inside.



Obviously, my initial thought was that whoever was in 9G was killing people. So, I tried to keep an eye on anyone coming or going. There was never anyone. Hell, I’ve only ever seen him twice. Wish I hadn’t. 



First time was late one night, early morning, about a month after he moved in. I’d picked up a late shift at the restaurant I work at. Some rich asshole had thrown a bunch of money at the owner to stay open late; I’ve always had a problem saying no to authority figures, so I agreed to pull a double shift. I tried to rationalise it as a paid excuse to avoid the smell for a while. The flip side to that was I then had to trudge home, overworked and exhausted, knowing that smell was waiting for me.



I’d just reached the 9th floor hall and there he was at the other end, unlocking his door. He was tall, freakishly tall, like near 7 foot despite being hunched over. Baggy clothes clung to a skeletal frame like blankets draped over branches. He had his hood up and the only bit of skin visible was his hands. Old, worn leather stretched too tightly across bone. Stretched to ripping. 



“Fuck me.” I muttered to myself at the sight. His head snapped round to look at me. Yellow eyes gleamed bright from within the hood that hid his features. It was death itself. The hall contracted around me until I could feel the absence of its breath on my face. A talon-like finger raised to my eyes and I jerked back, bashing my head on the elevator. Suddenly we were at opposite ends again and he turned from me to enter his apartment. 



I locked and bolted my door immediately. Then I slid down it and I cried. I hadn’t been so terrified since my dad caught me smoking pot at 15 and said he was gonna call the police and I’d go to jail. It's that deep terror, axis shifting. The sort of terror that doesn’t come from thinking you’re about to die, but that you’ve just accidentally switched tracks from a normal life to something darker and beyond your control. 



Hand to heart, I really thought I was living two doors down from a vampire. Pale, deathly smell, only seen at night.  Vampire. So, I fished out the crucifix my gramma got me for confirmation and displayed it round my neck. Garlic cloves to adorn my doors and mustard seeds by my bed. Recited the Lord’s prayer before bed, and Psalms 23 anytime I had to walk down the hall just to settle my nerves.



I made sure I was always back in my apartment by sundown, which was easy enough before winter. Sleep was difficult. I’d lie awake with the rot in my nose and visions of those yellow eyes just outside my window. As I’d drift off, I’d hear a tapping. Faint. Like a bony finger beating against my door. I woke up in a panic the first time and rushed to my peephole. Nothing. Windows all clear. So, I lay down and as I drifted off: tapping. Every night was the same.



I should have moved. Of course I should have. But at the time it was easy to put up roadblocks. To rationalise it away. I was imagining things. I didn’t have the money. Who would believe me. What line could I use instead to explain. The train of thought always led to me being seen as crazy by everyone, or sleeping on the streets. So, I stayed. I stayed and I pretended I didn’t hear the tapping at my door. When it woke me in the night I said it was just a dream. 



It’s the kind of thing that’s easy to chalk up to imagination, but I never could convince myself. Then last week it happened somewhat louder than before, like someone slamming against my door. I jolted up and darted over, though not before grabbing the crucifix. The door across from me was open. My neighbor, Ninety, stood there in tighty-whities and a vest, gun in hand. I’m not good with guns, so all I can say is that it was a pistol. He scratched his temple with the barrel and I could see a faded yellow image on the gun beneath his fingers. Never seen anything like it. 



I threw open my door. His eyes darted to me, but the pistol didn’t move, thank God. Probably not a good idea to spook a guy with a gun. 



“Y'hear that?” He asked. 



“Yeah. Every night for weeks now.” I said. He gave me a look, like sizing up my words. Deciding if he believed me.



“It’s the freak in 9G.” He said. He wasn’t looking at me anymore, just glaring down the hall like he hoped that door would open. “Think I’ll have a *neighborly chat* with him"



“Wait!” I hissed. My hand went to his shoulder as soon as he moved by me. He stopped and those faraway eyes suddenly focused right on me. I let go of him. “I just mean, tempers are high. Why not wait until morning.” 



His eyes lingered on me, then to my other hand. My crucifix. “Morning? So we can drag him out of his coffin.” He shook his head and continued down the hall. I backed into my apartment and watched from there, where I could quickly slip behind the threshold. 



Ninety stood at the door to 9G and delivered three short, sharp, raps. There was no answer. A moment passed and silence hung heavy in the air, making it hard to breathe. He tried again, louder this time. Harsh. Staccato. Slams. Each delivered with his pistol hand. Still, there was nothing from beyond. Something shifted in Ninety’s posture then. He took up a wide stance, pistol arm straight across his body, pointing at the door. His other hand went slowly to the handle. He twisted it and held, then turned to me. 



He was going to say something. I know he was. But he didn’t get the chance. The door lurched open and he was pulled in with it. Pulled in. He didn’t fall in, he didn’t run in, he was pulled in. I’d like to say I ran after him, crucifix drawn, to save my neighbor. Instead I slammed my door shut and called 911. 



It took an hour for the police to arrive. More than enough time for him to drain Ninety’s blood and hide the body. I didn’t expect them to find anything.



 They didn’t come to my apartment, but I saw them through the peephole. Two officers looking bored and half-asleep. One had his hands on his belt like he was trying to keep his pants up, the other wore sunglasses despite the time. They knocked on Ninety’s door first, probably some procedure they had. My mouth went dry when the door opened a crack and a weathered face appeared. Lips dry and cracked. Sunken eyes, and stretched skin. It wasn’t Ninety.



“Sorry to disturb you at this hour, sir. We’ve had reports of an altercation.” Officer Belt said as if he wasn’t talking to a corpse.



“Alter-what? Someone say I been fighting?” Ninety said. Clear as day it was his voice. His voice coming from that thing.



“Report was that you’d been attacked and dragged into 9G.” Officer Glasses said. I stared at the rolls of fat on the back of his neck trying to make sense of what I was hearing. 



“First I heard of it.” 



“Of course, sir. Sorry to bother you. Have a good night.” Officer Glasses said. And that was it. No follow up, no checking 9G, they turned and left. Muttering about crank calls. I watched them through the peephole until they vanished from sight, then my gaze returned to the door opposite. 9D. It was still open a crack. One catlike eye stared dead ahead at my door, my peephole, me. 



The door to 9D flew open and I darted back. I was trapped. The fire escape. My only hope was the fire escape. My fingers scratched on the rough frame and I fumbled before the pane finally flew up and a gust of wintry air grabbed at me. My handle squeaked behind me as I clambered out. Then there was a knock. 



“Hello, anyone home?” It was Officer Glasses. I stopped, straddling my windowsill. Fool that I am, I nearly went over to the door. My instinctive reaction to obey authority. But then I remembered Ninety’s voice coming from that thing. The hesitation was enough. My door exploded open, splinters peppered my back and side. I fell onto the fire escape and scrambled.



Pain needled down the left side of my body as I ran, and crawled and fell down the side of the building, not daring to slow or look back. Something caught my leg at one point, but whether it was the wendigo or just random debris I don’t know. I reached the ladder and threw all my weight on it; it didn’t budge. 



That’s when I made the mistake of turning. It lunged at me. Bony arms extended like spears aimed at my throat. Mouth open to reveal all too human teeth that were yellowed and cracked. It should have been so light. For how thin it was, it shouldn’t have weighed anything at all. 



I managed to protect my neck and got my left arm near snapped clean off for the privilege. It felt like a rusty saw made of static shocks tore through my bone. Made my vision go cloudy. And all the while it pressed on me heavier and heavier. An impossible weight. Those teeth came closer and closer; there was no rush in it now. The thing was enjoying itself, taking its time. 



Then the ladder finally gave. The wendigo and I both fell to the floor with an almighty clang. This was soon followed by flashing blue lights and a quick blast of siren. Headlights illuminated me and I had to squint to make out officers Glasses and Pants sat in their cruiser.



The wendigo was gone.



The officers took me to the hospital, figuring I must’ve been high or something. I was treated for a spiral fracture, concussion, and two dozen other minor injuries including an array of splinters. I haven’t been back to my apartment since then. Tried to stay anywhere with lots of people. It seems to want to stay under the radar. I’m in the library at the moment. Current theory is it’s a wendigo, so I’m trying to work out how to kill it. Everything just says silver, like they’re werewolves.



I’m hoping someone here can help.
