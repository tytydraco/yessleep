When I was younger my five friends and I had a club. We called it The Secret Kids Society, granted the title was kind of cliché, but we were kids. There was John, age 13 a bigger guy who was on the schools wrestling team, he was the clubs bodyguard, and helped keep us protected. there was Chloe aged 13 she liked to read, and helped organize our fun little clubs things. if we wanted to put on a play she would write and direct it. she was a thin pale blonde girl with big glasses. we had Henry aged 13 who was Chinese decent lacrosse player, taller then you might imagine.lean, but he could pass a ball i think it was called, better then I've ever seen. 

there was,  Lydia and Vince aged 14,   two fraternal twins, Lydia was a math genius and Vince was a huge history buff, he could tell you anything about history they were like two opposites, they were also pretty competitive in running. Thats the only similarities they shared. then there was me aged 14 a big fella, with big personality, i was also the one to start the club, with henry. we were all neighbors from the same block, henry and I were the closest. anyway the club started.  we would meet up in the woods down the street and do stuff like games, pretending, but our favorite thing to do was find missing things. 

it all started when I lost my calculator for class, I looked everywhere for it. it had my initials on it. anyway, henry eventually saw and found john using it, john was intimidating, but that began the addition of john joining. he saw henry one day, going into the woods and followed, and eventually john just joined, we decided then and there on the name, yea we were teens, but it was an easy name to remember. I wont bore you about who and when they joined. 

Eventually there was six of us, it was our monthly meeting, the day after school ended, we were excited for the summer, and we planned on meeting more often now that summer was here, we all met at the leaning tree, like we did most of the time, there was a tarp, and other things to make a make shift house. It wasn't much but it was our home away from home. We had a table and old chairs, sat around. we had a white board hanging from one of the branches, it swayed but it was sturdy enough to write on. 

  
"order, Order, todays meeting is a good one, we have been asked to look for our neighbor Rosie) i said, well we weren't asked but earlier that day we got a silver alert for her, she was a 82 year old woman with dementia and every so often, she gets out and well lets just say this isn't the first time we found her. 

"she may be in her usual spot, but she is missing again so lets get to work." 

"Lydia and Chloe, you check the local grocery store, she's been spotted there a couple times before" 

“Vince and I will check her old house like last time." 

“Henry and John, you check around the woods near her house. we will find her, like last time" 

"text if we find her, keep checking in" I said 

alright we broke up after that to go our separate ways on our bikes, 

The Secret Kids Society had a history of finding things more recently though its evolved into a teenage detective club of sorts, it started with the calculator, then it was finding one of a missing dog. which although when we found the dog he wasn't the greatest shape, it was the first time we came realization sometimes the truth is death, but it is closure. and now we find people sometimes. The First person we ever found, we were hired by George the quarterback to help find his girlfriend. He suspected her of cheating. it was pretty fun... but the plot twist was He was actually the one cheating. He was sleeping with Kenton, lets just say that was a fun story. Today though was to find Rosie. we all checked our spots. 

Lydia: she’s not at the grocery store.

Me: she’s not at her old house

John: FOUND HER…She’s at the woods… 

when we all arrived on our  bikes, 

John looked off. I don’t know what it was, but John was sweaty, and dirty, it was odd. 

“Where is she…” Lydia asked? 

“Where is Henry?” I asked? 

“She’s in there” pointing to the woods, but it was kind of weird… “where is Henry?” I  asked again. “Henry? What?” He looked around befuddled “he was just here.” 

This time everyone's flags were waving. “Where is Henry?” Lydia asked now? 

Then before we could even answer, we heard a scream.. 

“Help Me, Where am I” a woman voice came from the woods. 

“Rosie?” We all ran, into the dimming woods, as the sky was darkening. She wasn’t too deep, but when we found her.. we realized Henry wasn’t with her either.. 

“Rosie, where is Henry?” I asked not remembering myself about her condition.

“Hello, young boy..” She just said.. ignoring my question.. we decided to get her home, 

But I told Lydia and Chloe and Vince stayed back to find Henry…

I asked John again where Henry is, but he didn’t know..

“We were riding our bikes, and I was ahead. I swear he was right behind me, so I didn’t think about it when I saw her. As I got closer she ran into the woods…. I didn’t even notice Henry was gone,” 

We got Rosie back to the nursing home before getting thanked by staff…

“Where was she this time?” Harold the worker at the Franklin Senior Living manager asked  

“Just inside the woods.. like that one time..” 

“Ah okay well thanks for finding her!” Like many times before we said No problem and made our way to the woods. 

A text came in

Henry: I went home, wasn’t feeling well. Sorry for the scare.. 

Me: Oh thank God… I was scared for a second

Lydia: feel better, we had quite the scare

John: glad your safe Rosie is safe too.. 

Chloe: meeting over? Wanna come swim at my place? 

Me: that sounds nice ill ask my mom

John: I can’t my mom wants me home, but maybe ill sneak out ;)

Vince: sounds fun Ill be over soon, glad you’re home John… 

Lydia: im on my way…

Me: Said yes ill be there soon. 

Chloe: sounds good, I’ll get drinks… from moms cabinet.. 

End messages. 

It was around 9pm when we all were in her pool, music playing to kick off the first Summer night. 

We drink, we swam, and by 2 am we all were in the basement asleep to a movie…

I woke up to a headache, 

10 missed calls. 

Mom: where are you… 

Mom: you need to ask if you plan on staying at chloes

Mom: Brandon please call me… I need to know you’re safe.

\*\*ring ring\*\*

Me: hello…

Mom: oh thank god your okay

Me: sorry, I stayed at Chloes

Mom: is Henry with you? 

Mom: He didn’t come home last night 

Me: wait what? 

Me: no what? 

Me: what do you mean he didn’t come home?

Mom: Miss Chung Called and asked me to ask you he didn’t come home…

Me: well he’s not here.

I was now slapping Vince and John to wake up…

John: what time is it…

Vince: god my head is pounding.

Me: Henry is missing…..

John: alert now.. what?

Me: Henry is missing… 

Vince: what do you mean? He said he went home…

Chloe: guys, its too early…. 

Me: HENRY IS MISSING.. 

Now everyone was sitting up….groggy but alert..

Lydia: oh shit. My mom called

Then chloes mom came down the stairs.. 

Chloes mom: oh thank god you’re all here.. 

The drinks stacked in the corner… 

Chloes mom: Chloe Elizabeth were you drinking last night..

Chloes mom: we will talk about that later.. have any of you seen Henry??

Me: no we haven’t seen him since yesterday.. I looked at the missed calls.. now that I was alert 

9 from mom… 

A voicemail from Henry..

Before I pressed play though.. we all got up now looking at our phones.

Everyone of us had a voice mail from Henry… but we decided silently to wait to play them when our families were together.. 

We decided to play the messages when we were all together with Ms. Chung, 

::::later that day:::;;

We were all now at The Chungs, Ms. Chung was pacing and calling Henry’s phone.. 

Mr. Chung was on the phone with the police. 

The other parents were all calling people they knew.. 

The first day of summer turned into the day we all would remember forever.. 

Vince, Lydia,John,Chloe, and I all sat in his bedroom.. with our phones out ready to play the messages. I had a voice recorder ready so we could record the whole message. 

We looked at the times, and realized 

Chloe got called first, Vince Second, I third, Lydia Fourth, John last 

So we decided to play them in that order..

I press record.. 

Chloes phone

Henry: Chloe…Chloe I dont know where I am, help me.. Its dark.. help me.. abrupt stop sounds of a car engine in the background..

Vince’s phone

Vince, will someone pick up… I don’t know where I am..theres no light here, I think I’m in the trunk… help me… a trunk opens. What are you doing here… Stay back..Stay back… screams.

My phone

Brandon… I don’t know where I am but I know who took me.. I know who took me and if I am to die tonight… I want you to know I love you man. I love you man.. three faint knocks in the background 

Lydia’s phone 

Lydia… please anyone answer… I know where I am now We’ve all been here… Help meeee.. If this is my last message… Ive always had a crush on you.. I have always loved you more then a friend….. a faint noise in the back sounds like beeping.. screech… I love you.. don’t trust them.  Silence. 

Johns phone

John… how could you how could you not look back.. how did you not hear me scream. 

Someone please answer…..

Whack…. silence…..

Then another voice…



Did you all get that? You have 48 hours.



We all sat in silence as I repressed the record button

Then the play button 

The message played without, breaks. 

We listened to it 4 times. 

Lydia: we need to tell the parents.

Chloe: I agree… they need to hear it

Vince: I agree too 

John: I dont know something seems off,  what did he mean “don’t trust them” 

Me: I also agree, but yeah that was weird.. what did that mean 

Lydia: how should I know… I just found out he loved me… 

Me: okay.. decoding later. Lets show the parents all in favor say Aye.

Lydia, John, Vince, Chloe: aye

We made our way downstairs. Ready to play what he left… but then John made us stop..  we cant. Something feels off.. 

My mom: sweety what Is it? 

Me: we found something. 

Chloe: Henry left us a message.

John: Dont tell them.. Something doesn’t feel right. 

Lydia: well now they know… lets just show them

Ms. Chung: show us what? Message? If our son left you something we have the right to know… 

Me: he left us voice mails… 

Me: I recorded the whole thing 

John: We cant tell them. Something is off… please don’t. 

Mr. Chung: Our son is missing the police are on the way you can show us or them.. We need to know.

Me: I pull the recording out playing it 

Now all of us know the message.. we listen to it  6 times…

Chloes mom: what is that? The beeping? 

My mom: what is that sound? 

Ms. Chung was now crying…. Where is Henry.. 

Mr. Chung: why does that voice sound familiar. 

A knock at the door startled us.. red and blue lights were outside… 

Detective Johnson answers the door
