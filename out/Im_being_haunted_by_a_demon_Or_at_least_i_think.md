To start things off my name is Sebastian. I've always loved horror movies, games, and heavy dark music. It all began way back in 2017. i had just gotten out of school, i was a senior at the time. As we got out of school i decided to steal my friends bike an rushed off down the street, that's when i got hit by a car.

All i remember is the car hitting my body and me flying over it like something out of an action movie, And then darkness. I came to in the hospital them stitching my eyelid back onto my face. and that's when i saw It. Outside of my room staring at me, It was and elderly woman just looking vacantly at me, I brushed it off at the time as another person in emergency waiting to be seen by the next available Doctor. God how i wish i was that was the case. After i left the hospital i finished school and went on to meet a lovely girl, Had two children and it was after the birth/death of my daughter that i saw her AGAIN.

Outside the delivery room that same vacant look on her face except this time she was pointing at me. I went to approach her but as i walked out of the room i was stormed by doctors wanting to know the time of death like they didn't already fucking know that. And poof gone before i could ask her what she wanted and why she had been there all those years ago. Fast forward to 2022 we were still mourning the loss of our daughter, i was drinking and smoking heavily to cope with the loss when on the balcony of our apartment off in the distance in the woods behind our place there she was again for the THIRD TIME just pointing and staring with that same vacant stare. Only this time she was mouthing something as well, it was as if she was mouthing a warning. It was indeed a warning. God how i wish i took it seriously and not some alcoholic induced psychosis.

It's now 2024 and after the death of my grandfather we were forced to pack up and leave to florida to stay with my grandmother while we save up to purchase our own home. And she's back. with malicious intent. thousands of miles away NOT in a hospital setting. I swore seeing her outback in 2022 was a hallucination.

But it wasn't. she's outback right now. Pointing towards my room, Mouthing "You shouldn't have left". i closed the blinds and i'm currently freaking out right now. how did she know who i was? what did she want from me? how had she followed me thousands of miles to Florida from Indiana? i don't know and i don't care to find out. the sun is coming up now as i'm typing this and she seems to be gone. i feel safer in the daytime. If she comes back again tonight i'll be sure to attach pictures i took of her. Until then Godspeed.
