Hello to the reader of my POV. Thank you for giving this your time. I hope whatever you are going to read  doesn't trouble and upset you by bringing back relatable mishaps in the past or.... present. This, is not just another horror story. 

I am an anime artist who also illustrates supernatural beings. This is what the viewers of my posts think. Many of them ask me about the source of inspiration behind my certain artworks. I am going to share that with you now. 

It started the night before my 19th birthday. I came to stay with my cousin for a few weeks. And well my 19th birthday was near! Oh how excited I was. Two of my friends came over the night before my birthday to make preparations for the same. They wanted it to be memorable. Little did I know that that memory would haunt me for the rest of my life. Back to the topic, they asked me to stay in my room until it was an emergency. You know to do preparations for the celebration and all. So to keep myself awake I settled up to watch a horror movie even though I do not like horror that much. It was 10:47pm when I started the movie and I quit it by 11:37pm due to the bone chilling scenes. I shut my laptop and laid down on my soft bed stating blankly at the ceiling. After finding nothing interesting in the ceiling I turned over to the other side of my bed to reach out my phone, when suddenly my eyes met the eyes of the most unexplainable shape of a black abyss. It had no face. No other body parts. Nothing. But I knew it was staring at me. I was stunned. I didn't notice that I was holding my breath until my friends and my cousin burst out into my room wishing me happy birthday.
I didn't say this experience to anyone because I thought it be some kind of hallucination after watching that horror movie. 

It was a big mistake. 

A week later when I thought everything had finally returned to normal, I experienced it once again. 
It was 9pm and my cousin was out of the apartment talking with his 'just a friend'. I was watching "junji ito" and happily munching a croissant. But they say " happiness doesn't last long." Suddenly I felt a chill down my spine as if something was watching me. I glanced around quickly but nothing was there. I dismissed the thought and continued watching but then again from my hind sight I saw something moving from my curtain to my bedroom's door like a flash. Now I was scared. I covered myself under the blanket and started thinking of my parents. The silence pierced my ears. 15 minutes felt like 15 hours. Finally I removed the blanket when my cousin shook me up. I was drenched in sweat. He saw the fear in my eyes. 

He became firm and whispered quietly "Did you see it ?" 

My eyes widened. We didn't say anything for a while and later decided not to talk about this in future. 

Within a week I moved out from there and found a small 2BHK flat. I continued drawing and started posting them on social media apps to support myself financially. Occasionally I post horror artworks. The thing that troubles me is that I often receive messages from my viewers saying "I saw it too." 

Till this date, I see it in my hindsight, taking different forms. Sometimes shapeless with no face but still staring at me and sometimes a face clearer than a glass enough to make a restless for the next 3 weeks. I draw what I see and sometimes 

I see what I draw. I know those who have seen my works, have seen 'it' too.
