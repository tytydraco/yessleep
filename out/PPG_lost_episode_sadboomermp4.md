Anyone knows about the Powerpuff girls show right? It’s about a show where three girls named Blossom who is the leader, Bubbles who is the laughter and Buttercup who is the muscle that fights crime on a day to day basis with Mojo, Princess Morbucks, HIM and well you get the idea. There is also The Rowdyruff Boys that fans keep bringing up about with Brick, Boomer and Butch like why can’t they get along or something like that.

&#x200B;

Besides they always ship The PPG with RRB which I always find a a bit odd. Well there is an episode, or was supposed to be till it was locked away or thrown out. My friend worked there as an intern when he heard about this episode.

&#x200B;

It started as a rumor during his time there when the creator of the show, Craig McCracken, said he was gonna see a new review of the episode he was told about and came out a few minutes later looking like he saw a ghost.

&#x200B;

When he was questioned about this, he refused to answer and just walked away. Before he did however, he told the people in the room to lock that thing up and never let it see the light of day in a more disappointed tone. I think some people managed to peek at whatever he was watching since the rumors said, ‘I think one of the Rowdyruff boys did something.” or, "Was it Boomer or Bubbles that did something?”.

&#x200B;

Of course they were rumors so my friend didn’t mind but he still was curious. Apparently to my friend, he went to a room full of episodes that were scrapped, cut and removed and he managed to find it. He then put up a computer in the room where he downloaded the episode on the computer on a mp4 format and put it in his Media player to put it on my computer and play the contents(This was back in 2004.) And it was just called sadboomer oddly.

&#x200B;

How he did it with no one watching is beyond me, but what is known is that we are gonna see what the contents of this episode holds. My friend went to my home so we could watch it but most of the video was corrupted. Since I know how to fix a video, I fixed it mostly since there was too much to work on so we had to watch what was on the video.

&#x200B;

The video started out with a normal intro like any other episode except with a few glitches here and there. Then the Title, ”Hurtful words” came on screen but there were no flashes of the Powerpuff girls flying in the screen, it just faded in as the pop music that usually plays in the title cards was replayed with just a slow piano music piece as if we’re gonna see something sad. It continued to fade into the opening credits but the names were absent as if it was unfinished as the last card just had no names at all.

&#x200B;

The Episode starts with the usual, “The city of Townsville!” then cuts to a calm street with people walking and cars driving while the narrator continues, "Has been pretty calm lately this past week.” It then cuts to different scenes of people doing different activities in the street as the narrator continues saying, "As citizens like workers, bosses, joggers, shoppers…” It went on until it cut to Boomer just having a drink while walking as the narrator finishes by saying, "And even villains just taking a stroll in the day!”

&#x200B;

Boomer then finishes his drink as he just throws it on the street and steals another from a random person as the Narrator then says, ”Well…mostly strolling.”

&#x200B;

The scene just continues as Boomer drinks from someone’s cup that he’d stolen just to at least do something while his brothers are away doing well whatever they are doing. He then bumps into a girl with long hair over her eyes as she falls to her knees as Boomer just keeps walking. “Hey!” The girl said, "Watch where you’re going!” Boomer looks back at her, mockingly saying, “Oh I’m sorry! I didn’t see you there!” He then casually laughs as he walks over and snatches a snack from her.

&#x200B;

“Hey, give that back!” The girl then shouted. “Or what? Gonna beat me up?” Boomer says in an amused and mocking tone as she stands up. “No.” She says offscreen as Boomer just looks at her. “Yeah I am sooooo scared by a stupid gi-” Boomer suddenly paused and jumped a bit at something offscreen. It then cuts the girl’s face. Her hair no longer covers her face as her eyes are shown. Her eyes were oddly bloodshot as we looked at the screen more.

&#x200B;

She looked at Boomer with mild anger in her eyes as she just said, "But I should be mindful of what I’m doing if I were you.” Boomer then awkwardly looks around as if she was talking to someone else and then looks back to the girl just gone as if she was never there.

&#x200B;

Boomer starred as the spot for a while with a weirded out expression. "Freak” he said as he rolled his eyes in annoyance as he walked off with a stolen snack and a stolen drink. Me and my friend both look at each other with confusion both asking ourselves, “What was that about?”

&#x200B;

The scene continues as Boomer walks for a bit until he spots Brick and Butch fighting The PowerPuff Girls. He then literally throws the drink and snack aside as he flies to fight the girls as he says, "Finally! About time!” since he was waiting for something to happen. He then meets them as they ask him where he was. He then says that he was just taking a stroll as they looked at him with disgust.

&#x200B;

They then yelled at him for not being there with them when the Powerpuff Girls were fighting them for about an hour and Boomer did not know this. Boomer then said he’ll make it up as he charges head first and hits the leader several times before getting pummeled by them as there was a montage of him getting beaten up till he fell in an alleyway with a bruised face with a black eye and had messy hair.

&#x200B;

He tried to apologize but was cut off with Brick yelling at him of how he’s an idiot for not only leaving them alone with the girls and getting beaten by the girls. Brick then starts to verbally insult him so much that he starts tearing up as Brick smacks him in the head as Butch just laughs at Boomer’s misfortune. We were shocked while watching Boomer just getting abused like this, especially by his brothers.

&#x200B;

Blossom, Buttercup and Bubbles fly in frame and question what in the world are they doing to Boomer. Both have an argument about why you shouldn't hurt your brother before they begin to fight again. Bubbles did try to ask whether he was ok or not before she was pulled into the fight.

&#x200B;

Boomer then looked at the sky with the fight taking place before flying offscreen. It then cut to Boomer’s expression and he looked like he was about to cry as he just walks off somewhere.

&#x200B;

We then see the fight still going on and both teams are getting tired. Both stopped as Bubbles pointed out the Boomer isn’t with them or at all since they fought for 2 hours. apparently Bubbles has been try to get their attention but no one listened till now. The Girls are a bit worried while the Boys were not concerned.

&#x200B;

Both have an argument again till finally Bubbles suggested we should find him since they didn’t see him after what happened in the alleyway. Both agree pretty much but Brick is still less concerned about but still agrees to. Both then try to come up with a plan of how to find him quickly.

&#x200B;

The scene then fades to Boomer walking alone on a street with a gloomy expression while sad music plays in the background. A small montage plays with Boomer going to a candy shop, basically eating loads of sugar, punches a hole through a vending machine to get some drinks, then lays down in an alleyway as it cuts to black.

&#x200B;

My friend then asks, “Is this what Craig saw?” To be honest, this is what he probably saw. The scene then cuts to night where the girls are in their room, wondering where Boomer would be. Bubbles and Buttercup are concerned about Boomer while Blossom is a bit worried about it but is sure that Boomer might be found by the police.

&#x200B;

This conversation goes on for a minute or two till it cuts back to Boomer walking in the street looking depressed, messy and…drunk? It turns out that the drinks Boomer stole from a vending machine earlier was actually beer cans since he is stumbling and is slurring with his words a bit as he rants on about how he was bullied by his brothers everyday no matter what he did.

&#x200B;

Plus he ate a lot of sugar he was also jittery but more mad then happy as you see in cartoons where a character eats sugar (Mac from Foster's home for imaginary friends for example.).

&#x200B;

As he ranted on of what he might do to his brothers when he gets the chance, the Narrator suddenly responds saying, “Boomer I think you might need to think about this and-” he was then cut off with Boomer telling him to shut up as he stares at the screen as we just realized that the Narrator was listening this whole time.

&#x200B;

He continued to rant until the screen glitched for a few seconds and came back to Boomer just staring at the screen. We were both caught off guard because of how fast it happened. The first thing we noticed was his eyes. His eyes were replaced with what looked like photos eye's placed on his eyes which were just black.

&#x200B;

Note that this creeped the hell out of me and my friend when we first saw this. It was like this for what seemed like a few minutes, just nothing but staring, no music, no sound, just silence. It glitches again and comes back to the scene of where it was before. Boomer stops ranting and looks down with tears in his eyes as we get to see flashbacks of previous episodes with the Rowdyruff boys having fun wrecking stuff and hanging out like brothers.

&#x200B;

The flashbacks suddenly end as Boomer just looks up and says, "Where did it all go wrong?" and then after a while, he realized that his life was nothing more than just a "Punching bag" for everyone. As he made that realization, a smirk appears on his face and starts to laugh, and laugh and laugh uncontrollably. The scene suddenly cuts to black for a few seconds before cutting back to the Powerpuff girl’s house at night.

&#x200B;

We get to see Boomer almost tripping on his way to a door to the lab since he drank beer and ate candy which I don't think doesn't blend well and he also was kind of giggling a bit when he entered. When he gets there and places his hand on the knob, he then looks back still looking quite tipsy. The scene shifts in the dark living room where we could’ve sworn we saw a figure around the corner and faded away leaving Boomer worried. Boomer opens the door and walks down the stairs still tipsy with the beer he stole earlier.

&#x200B;

He looks around for a bit till something appears on the screen for a split second so we pause it and rewind back to what it was. It was a message saying, “What are you doing here?” We looked at each other confused over what it meant.

&#x200B;

We resumed to Boomer still looking around until another message popped up, this time it stayed on the screen longer for us to read. It said, “You know you shouldn't be here.” We were really creeped out at this point but I thought it had something to do with Boomer being in the lab without permission or something like that but who is saying this to them?

&#x200B;

The scene continues as Boomer walks up to the screen as we begin to see his eye turn to Bloodshot as he moves closer to the screen. He then looked up as the scene cuts to a shelf with Boomer looking up. As he reached to grab it, a sound can be heard as Boomer suddenly stops and turned to see what made the noise. We both got to see something around the corner but it was so dark in this scene so we couldn’t tell. Boomer continues to stare at the figure for a while before asking, "H-hello? Who's there?” We cut back to the figure up close but it was still too dark.

&#x200B;

Suddenly another figure popped into frame emitting a high pitched screech making us both jump as Boomer was scared out of his skin, put his back on the shelf. There were loads of figures, all of which were so terribly drawn and deformed we couldn’t even make out what they was supposed to look like, Although it did look like some of them were the girls and Boomer's brothers. Several messages appeared on screen and all of them said terrible things as the whispers grew louder and Boomer covered his hands on his face while crying, clearly terrified.

&#x200B;

The figures and whispers then slowly fade away leaving an empty room with Boomer shaking of what he just saw. Boomer then looks up again as the scene cuts to a object he was reaching for which has a big red X on it as the scene gets covered in static.

&#x200B;

The scene then cuts to Boomer walking in the opposite direction in the streets as he carries the flask from the previous scene with him. He also has a smirk on his face, but it looked forced, not to mention his eyes were slightly bloodshot since he was crying from the last scene. As he walked, the whispers from before appeared again and the figures appeared behind objects.

&#x200B;

It looked like Boomer was being tormented by hallucinations from what happened and his realization. It was like this until he reached a building as he flew up to the top. There was what sounded like the wind in the background save for the whispers.

&#x200B;

As he reached his smile dropped to a frown and teared up even more. The whispers were deafening in this scene as it continued. And then without warning, he chugged the flask in one motion and threw it down as the whispers went silent completely as he drank it but the wind still played.

&#x200B;

A few seconds pass and he starts convulsing as dark brown spots appear around him as his skin turns pale. Me and my friend knew instantly what he just drank, he just drank Antidote X. He then falls off the roof from the pain and starts crying loudly. And then a few seconds later, he hits the ground with a sickening splat as the scene suddenly stops and repeats for a while. "Oh my God...!" exclaimed my friend who was horrified at the scene presented before us, Did Craig McCracken really see this? The wind sounded more distorted as his face faded in the screen, horribly mangled.

&#x200B;

And then everything suddenly stops. Everything was white except for Boomer’s entire outline was just blue. There was soft orchestra music in the background as he opens his eyes and looks around confused and dazed.

&#x200B;

He then looks in front of him to a familiar figure. The figure looked like Bunny from the episode Twisted Sister. The Bunny ghost looked at him with some concern and sadness as it asked him if what he did was really worth it. He opened his mouth to answer but stopped, frowned and looked down. The music stopped and the screen cut to black as Boomer said one word, "No.”

&#x200B;

It was just silent for a while until we started hearing Bubble's voice calling for Boomer with her sisters and his brothers. As the voices drew closer Boomer’s face fades in with blood on his left side of his face.

&#x200B;

Bubbles then suddenly screams as Boomer’s left face distorts on screen. The screen comes back to a disgusting sight. It was Boomer, or just his mangled corpse laying on the street. The left side of his face is torn, his limbs were broken, just everything about him was broken. I let out a loudest gasp then I ever did in my whole life. My friend was just shocked at the scene.

&#x200B;

After a while, a figure in the shape of Boomer started to rise above Boomer with those same eyes we saw before Boomer went to the girl’s house. I immediately suspected to be Boomer’s soul that looked over his corpse.

&#x200B;

The screen cuts out to a black screen again but with only the sounds of police sirens. And then a message popped up saying, ”1 day later.” before fading out. We then get to see Mojo and Him in Mojo’s lair just sitting and looking down. Both have a conversation of how they would have known something like this would have. Mojo then asks, "Were we good creators?” Him tells him yes and they did everything they could.

&#x200B;

The next scene shows what appeared to be a hospital with Bubbles, Buttercup and Butch. Buttercup and Butch were having a fight over who’s fault it is that caused Boomer to die and Bubbles just looked traumatized. The argument lasted for a few minutes till it finally cuts to another scene. Though I did see something around the corner during the argument.

&#x200B;

The last scene shows Brick on the building looking over the city. Blossom soon joins him and asks how he's doing. Brick really regrets what happened because he was angry about fighting the girls that his anger harmed someone, especially someone important. Both share their condolences and have a meaningful conversation as Brick contemplates if he wants to be a good guy maybe.

&#x200B;

The screen then plays the normal ending scene but cuts abruptly afterwards with a black screen. Two distorted Photo realistic eyes appeared in the darkness as a spotlight appeared over it. It looked like Boomer, or at least his ghost. He looked at us for a few seconds until it cut to nothing but a message saying, "Your words have your own consequences."

&#x200B;

And after that, the episode ends. We were both shocked by what we just saw. After watching it, we immediately put it on Facebook so that anyone can figure out what it is. No one really viewed it and the ones who did thought it was a messed up parody of the PPG so we kept it and kind of forgot about it.

&#x200B;

We didn’t get anything important until years later when Craig messaged me and my friend. He was confused over how we got hold of this episode and was worried about what we saw. We asked him what happened on that day and he explained that he had this idea of that episode and put two new animators to work on it and the result was not what he intended. He immediately fired the new employees and got nightmares for a month because of it.

&#x200B;

He also urged us not to share this to the internet but we already did that years ago for answers. However, as far as I know, I haven’t seen any mention of that episode on the internet and it should stay that way.

&#x200B;

At least I learned one thing from the experience, everyone has a breaking point, some are weak and some will hold but will crack under pressure. It’s also important to be respectful around people you don’t know what they are going through.

&#x200B;

After all, most people who reached their breaking point break stuff, shout angrily, and just have a breakdown, but some are silent and just go to a place that calms them as they let it out. Unfortunately in this case, this one was abused and wanted to leave this place by committing suicide.

&#x200B;

I guess it’s true of what they say. What you say does have consequences so be mindful of what you say because you don’t know what they are going through.
