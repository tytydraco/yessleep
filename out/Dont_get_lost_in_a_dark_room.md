You know, lots of people like to live on cheap thrills.  There's just something visceral about an adrenaline rush that makes stake-less things boring.  For me though, I just wanted to feel something again.  I should thank a dull life and a disastrous upbringing for that.  I had what I needed--  What was the value of financial success?  I hate people**—**  What was the value of friends or relationships? It's kind of weird the paradigm our society uses to evaluate individual fulfillment.  Maybe I should get a hobby?  But I already have one.  Obviously I do think there's a purpose to life and it's just so damn easy.  Meet certain conditions and your brain releases a chemical that makes you feel good.  I didn't start doing those ridiculous skyscraper parkour stunts, nor did I start gambling, at least with money.  Instead, I just started gambling with my life.  My guilty passion: paranormal rituals.  You probably think of the elevator game, Daruma-san, etc. (relatively popular ones).

I *was* a skeptic of supernatural phenomena, but for a while I've trudged through the deepest recesses of the internet and the most isolated, esoteric, occultist organizations throughout the world in search of them.  Most are pretty bunk: some of them rely on tricks of the mind fueled by your paranoia to imagine the horrors in dark spaces.  Others have the most egregious consequences that would make even the most skeptical of skeptics feel like its not worth trying.  But I did them all anyways.  It was fun taking risks with the demons.  I think I'm stopping now, though.  After doing one from the petroglyphs of an ancient Island community.

It's gruesome, really.  Participants would be blinded (eye removal), surgically deafened, and sealed in soundproof chambers.  The chambers would never be opened again.  Nobody knows what's supposed to happen.  It's just a concept that doesn't exist, a thought that doesn't exist.  And for what it's worth it seemed like an extravagant method to kill people, or at least to remove them from existence.  Like Schrödinger's Cat, nobody on the outside can say what happens to the cat in the box, but for this ritual not even the person on the inside would be aware of *what* is happening to them.  The cult apparently seems to know that *what* exists.  Obviously there's a lower success rate alternative without mutilation. 

You just need a room that is capable of completely blocking out all sunlight, and is over 10 steps by 10 steps in length and width.  Clean up the room and move furniture out.  The floor must be smooth and non-textured i.e. carpeting/tiles.  To what extent, I'm not sure, but none of your surroundings must give away where you exactly are.  Just think that whatever is under your feet is as generic as possible.  Nobody will know that you are doing this and nobody will know what is happening to you.  The room must be completely dark and completely silent.  With any environmental features and their interference, follow the rule that they must not tell you *where* you exactly are.

And in that room I stood on my 10th attempt at the ritual.  Curtains shut, pitch black, and so quiet that I could hear the blood running through my ears.  I sat cross-legged in the center of the darkness facing the shut door, waiting.  I can't say how much time passed.  I'd describe it as a quick eternity.  I presumed to end this attempt by walking to the door and opening it.  But something was wrong.  I couldn't find the door.  Or the wall.  I'd been walking in a straight line though, much further than the room would physically allow.  I tried many other directions, one foot after the other in the darkness.  But no matter what I couldn't find the walls.  Different sounds crept around me.  A soft, mechanical whir, the crackling of an invisible flame, and a deep, ambient rumbling. 

I couldn't deny it was exciting.  I was surprised it worked.  One question lingered:

*Where am I?*

I wandered aimlessly on the endless plane.  I saw nothing but darkness; only strange sounds shifted omnidirectionally in the distance.  Time passed while it didn't.  I stepped on a patch of something sticky and viscous.  The sounds neared around me, getting louder.  I could only call them faintly organic.  Paranoia kicked in.  This was surely real.

The voice in my head: **"You're not going home."**

Steady walking turned to sprinting.

**"You wanted to come here, didn't you?"**

*Something* was near me.  I was exhausted from running around.  Breathing that wasn't my own and a horde of footsteps resounded in my ears. 

**"You think this is fun?"**

I couldn't help but ask myself why I did this in the first place.  

*What was going to happen to me?*  

I bumped into something.  

*Fuck.  How do I get out of here?*

I didn't know what the hell it was that I encountered.  I kept running.  

**"Your fate will be worse than death."**

Something skittered beside me, followed by a laceration to my arm.  I winced, clutched it, and ran in the opposite direction.  

Strange silhouettes engulfed my vision.  The "sky" became visible**—** pure darkness interrupted by blood seeping out of cracks in what seemed to be its boundary.  And as I was about to collapse, the voice spoke again.

**"...Right behind you"**

My head darted backwards revealing the humanoid figure that lurched towards me... 

until everything disappeared.

I saw a sliver of light in the darkness and trudged towards it.  My door was opened a crack.  And I turned on the lights and the room was as I left it.  I don't know why or how my door opened but I got out of that place.  

You know, lots of people like to live on cheap thrills.  I don't anymore.  And neither should any of you try this out.  I mean, it's pretty hard to get right.  But maybe we should all be careful when the lights are off.
