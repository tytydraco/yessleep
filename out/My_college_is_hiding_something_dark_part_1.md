Hi i 47m went to college about 26 years back and something that my friends and I experienced is still etched deep in our minds we usually don't talk about that day's events as a word of it still brings a chill down our spines.


Having unsatisfactory results for my A levels in Singapore i found myself landed in a cheap college in my hometown in India. After serving a few years in Singapore's army i walked in older then most of there freshman. My friends mainly consisted of a seniors whom were around my age with a few juniors. However my core friend group consisted mainly of those in my dorm room. See my hostel is rather perculiar it is made in a c shaped building with three levels over peering a very poorly maintained field where we spent some of our free time. However the peculiar part is where my hostel diverges into two halves with stairs the middle the right wing consisted of us and the other college students while the other wing consisted of polytechnic students who studied in the same campus. Weird isn't it well thats not even the worst part. 

You see the poly students usually have their semestral leave earlier than us by a week. That means the left wing remain dark and silent at night. The seniors joked about rumours of ghosts of unpeaceful spirits roaming the empty rooms of polytechnic wing. My friends were scared shitless i however remain unfazed; i have heard worse in the army. Coincidentally one of our friend's birthdays was placed in that week. You see there's a tradition in Indian colleges which required the birthday boy to be absolutely ransacked by rotten eggs, tomatoes and dirty water of course the list doesn't end here. This spirited tradition was called birthday bumps and for whatever reason we seemed to get a kick off it and it was all light hearted. 

You see after the whole thing died down we were left with a mess at the hallways and the sun had long set. We ( group of 5) were approached by a frail man as he looked up at us we recognised the familiar face our janitor. "You boys never fail to make my life harder" he grumbled as he forcefully coughed. Ours hearts sank we had then realised the consequences of our actions. W offered to clean up and askes him for where he kept the mops. To which he replied that the nearest is accross the dark empty left wing at his janitorial closest in the toilet.
"Anywhere else " My friend asked. To which i replied "why you chicken? To which he replied "No!" I just don't wanna get lost so i ran to my room to get a torch and his primitive flip phone.
We only had two of them mine and his. Then off he wentâ€¦
The rest of us watched as his light diminished into the darkness which seemed to go on forever.
