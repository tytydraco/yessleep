I stepped off the trail for what felt like a minute.

When they found me, I’d been gone for five days.

Everyone kept asking where I’d been. I didn’t have an answer that made sense. I still don’t.

Everyone dreams about going to the Caribbean, but most people end up in places like St. Martin, Jamaica, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. You know the ones: crowded beaches, massive resorts, the tourist traps that feel more like amusement parks than islands. They’re fun, sure, but interchangeable. You could be anywhere.

Saba isn’t like that.

Saba is tiny. It’s basically one dormant volcano rising straight out of the ocean, with a single narrow road that winds through the entire island. That’s it. One road. No sprawl. No chains. No shortcuts. Everything there feels contained, almost deliberate, like the island decides how you’re allowed to move through it.

The only way to get there is by taking a very small plane. Maybe twelve people total, including the pilot. It’s so small that during the flight, the pilot said over the intercom “Ladies and Gentlemen, we’re… actually,” then turned around to look at and speak to the passengers in the cabin directly, “this is easier. We’re about to begin our descent onto the world’s shortest commercial runway. Please fasten your safety belts.” 

The landing is… unsettling.

As you approach the island, the plane flies straight toward what looks like the side of a mountain. At the last second, it banks hard, almost sideways, and drops onto the runway. The runway itself lives up to its title. The airport, a shack no bigger than a shed, is home to a gift shop that sells novelty magnets that say, *“I survived the landing.”*

I remember thinking how ironic that was.

Because if you don’t survive the takeoff, they’re not finding that magnet. They’re finding your body in the ocean with it still in your pocket.

Despite that, the island immediately feels welcoming. The people are friendly in a way that doesn’t feel forced. I stayed at **Queen’s Gardens**, a hillside resort tucked into the rainforest. When you arrive, they hand you champagne before you even check in. From your room, you can see nearly the entire island,white houses and shops with red roofs scattered across steep green hills, rainforest on either side, clouds hanging so low they sometimes feel close enough to touch.

There are no mosquitoes on Saba. No biting bugs at all.

For a kid from the Midwest, that’s how I knew I was in paradise.

There’s also this constant haze in the air. It looks like fog, but it isn’t. It’s volcanic. Smoke from deep underground, but it doesn’t smell like smoke. It just hangs there, quiet and still.

Everywhere you look, there are these tiny green lizards. Anoles. They dart across leaves, cling to tree trunks, freeze when you notice them. Kids love trying to catch them. Locals say they’re lucky.

And then there are the goats.

Mountain goats. Completely fearless. They’re everywhere, on cliffs, on hotel grounds, on the sides of the road. They act like they own the island. The road running throughout the island is so narrow and steep that when locals drive you around, they fly through blind corners at full speed. Sometimes cars brush against each other, mirrors nearly touching, and both drivers just double,honk like, *“Sorry about that,”* and keep going.

It’s terrifying at first.

Then, somehow, it becomes normal.

I was nineteen at the time.

Not old enough to drink back home in the United States,but old enough to drink on Saba, where there was no age limit at all. That fact alone made the island feel like it operated by a different set of rules.

The night before the hike, I was hanging out with some of my younger cousins near the resort grounds. They were fascinated by the anoles. At some point, it turned into a game.

We caught a few.

Then a few more.

One of the anoles let out a tiny sound when my nephew picked it up.

A quick little squeak, almost like a chirp.

It caught us off guard, and then everyone laughed. None of us expected it to make noise at all.

At one point, one of them nipped at my finger. Not hard. Barely anything. No more pressure than a clothespin.

It didn’t hurt. If anything, it was kind of funny.

I remember thinking how harmless they were. How they’d make great pets.

Eventually, we had about a dozen of them in a glass jar with leaves inside, holes poked in the lid. The kids were laughing, proud of themselves. I didn’t stop them.

I helped.

It felt harmless. Innocent. Just kids being kids, and me being the older cousin who went along with it.

It didn’t last long.

One of the local resort employees noticed almost immediately and came over. She was calm, but firm. First, she scolded the kids and told them they needed to let the lizards go. Then she turned to me. I gave her the *‘kids will be kids’* look, but I could tell I wasn’t winning her over.

She didn’t raise her voice. She didn’t need to.

She looked at me like I should have known better.

“This is disrespectful. Not just to the animals, but to the land. This is their home. Not yours.” She said the anoles weren’t toys. That they belonged where they were.

Then she demanded we free them.

We apologized, profusely. I unscrewed the lid, and we watched the anoles scatter back into the foliage, disappearing almost instantly like they’d never been there at all. The kids ran off to play somewhere else, already distracted.

But the look she gave me stayed with me.

That night, I danced to the sound of the steel drum band and drank some of the local beer: **Saba Spice**. Enough to feel loose. Enough to laugh a little louder than usual. Not enough to be hungover the next morning.

At the time, it all felt harmless. It felt like what it was supposed to be, a paradise vacation.

The next day, we went on a hike.

There’s a famous trail system on Saba that cuts through the rainforest. You can take the easy route or the advanced one. No matter which you choose, the guides tell you the same thing:

**Never leave the trail.**

They explain it like it’s about safety. The terrain gets steep. The rainforest is dense. It’s easy to slip. Easy to get turned around. Easy to get lost. 

I should have listened.

We took the advanced trail. It started at a little town called The Bottom and promised a two and a half hour challenging trek ending at another town. From there the plan was to walk the road back to Queen’s Gardens.

At first, it was breathtaking.

I’d hiked trails my whole life in the Midwest. Woods, bluffs, dirt paths, I had hiked it all, but nothing like this. The rainforest was dense and vibrant in a way that felt unreal. Greens layered on top of greens. Thick vines. Broad leaves dripping with moisture. In some places, the trail climbed so steeply that you could look out through breaks in the trees and see bright blue lagoons far below.

It was gorgeous.

It was also easy to see how someone could fall.

As we hiked, I started noticing something that made me uneasy in a way I couldn’t quite explain. There were anoles everywhere. More than I’d seen before. On leaves. On tree trunks. Along the path. Every time I stopped, I seemed to notice another one.

It almost felt like they were watching me.

I told myself I was imagining it. Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling.

At some point, I started feeling confident. Too confident. I was young, in good shape, riding that sense of awe and adrenaline. I decided it would be funny if I cut off the trail for a moment, looped around, and jumped out in front of everyone to scare them.

So I let myself fall to the back of the group and when the timing was right, I stepped off the path.

The plan was to cut back quickly. I didn’t mean to go far.

But the terrain shifted faster than I expected. The brush thickened. The ground sloped more sharply. I tried to angle back toward where I thought the trail was.

I couldn’t find it. It was like my internal compass was spinning.

I was trying to get my bearings when I realized I couldn’t hear the group anymore. I couldn’t hear anything. The vibrant sounds of the rainforest had fallen silent. Completely silent. 

That’s when I heard branches snapping around me. The sound of leaves rustling. 

Then I heard laughing.

Children.

Soft giggling, echoing through the trees.

It didn’t make sense. There were no kids on the hike. No other groups scheduled that day. And the sound wasn’t coming from one place, it was moving. Scattering. Like it was circling me.

I told myself it had to be goats. Goats made some weird noises sometimes, right? I’d seen them everywhere on the island. I’d watched them dart across roads and scale cliffs like gravity didn’t apply to them. Maybe this was just them crashing through the brush.

Then, from the corner of my eye, I saw something move.

Low to the ground. Fast.

It moved the way a deer moves when it’s spooked: fluid, agile, impossibly quick. Again, my brain went to goats.

It had to be goats.

I noticed it crawl across the brush in front of me. It paused for a moment and I realized it wasn’t a goat.

My mind couldn’t comprehend what I was seeing but… it was human.

Everything felt wrong.

It was a small child.

But there is no way a child could move like that. Not in that terrain. Not that fast. It was folded in on itself, scampering through the undergrowth, almost like it was running on all fours. But it was all wrong, backwards… upside,down.

Crab,walking.

There is absolutely no way a human body, let alone a child’s, could move that fast, that silently, especially in that way.

Suddenly, I heard something charging up behind me.

I spun around just in time to see it, for just a split second.

The child’s eyes were sunken, empty, and crawling out of the sockets were little green lizards. Dozens of them. Pouring out, spilling over its upside,down face as it moved.

It lunged.

I didn’t have time to react.

I fell backward, my head slamming into a tree.

Everything went black.

When I woke up, my head was pounding.

A deep, throbbing pain that felt like it was pushing outward from behind my eyes. My neck was stiff, my vision blurry, and for a moment I couldn’t tell if my eyes were actually open or not. My ears were ringing a long, high,pitched scream that slowly subsided until all I heard was silence.

Then I heard giggling.

At first, I felt relieved. Real, physical relief. My first thought was that my cousins had somehow followed us on the trail. That they’d decided to beat me at my own game and sneak up on me while I was out cold, scare me back.

I convinced myself that everything I’d seen before I blacked out, the crab,walking, the speed, all of it, had just been my brain misfiring after I slipped and hit my head.

“Shawn, Zach… you guys can come out now,” I yelled.  
“It’s not funny. I’m hurt.”

The giggling didn’t stop.

As my mind slowly cleared I understood why that explanation didn’t work.

The laughter was too young.

There was no way it could’ve been my cousins.

That’s when I heard something else,and felt it.

My blood ran cold.

Warm breath brushed against my ear.

“Shhh.”

I snapped my head to the side instinctively, sending a sharp pain down my neck that made me gasp. I was sure someone would be there.

There was nothing.

I rubbed my eyes, trying to force them to focus. I realized something was wrong with the light. Even though it was dark. Too dark. Far darker than it should have been but even so, the world around me looked… green.

Not moonlit.

Not shadowed.

Green.

The trees looked like they’d been coated in grass or maybe moss. The ground, what I thought was the ground, was covered in it too. There was no trail. No dirt. No leaves.

I lowered my hand and pressed my palm into what I thought was grass.

It moved.

Not swaying.

Not rustling.

Scurrying.

I froze.

These weren’t blades of grass. It wasn’t moss.

They were anoles.

Thousands, maybe millions of them.

They were everywhere,overlapping, pouring over each other, flowing across the forest floor and up the trees. The green wasn’t vegetation.

It was movement.

The grass wasn’t blowing in the breeze.

The anoles were running.

Something started tickling my feet. My skin was crawling. I looked down and realized it wasn’t my skin crawling, it was theirs.

At first, it felt like static. Like vibration. Almost a tickle.

Then the pressure started.

Tiny pinches, everywhere at once.

I tried to pull my feet back, but the ground moved with me. The biting wasn’t sharp, it was relentless. Like being caught in a thousand clothespins at the same time.

The giggling was still there.

But now that I was aware of what was surrounding me. The sound wasn’t giggling.

Too sharp.

Too layered.

That’s when the sound changed.

The giggling sharpened even more. Rose to an even higher pitch. Layered deeper, a chorus of chaos.

Though it was deafening, I recognized it somehow. I’d heard it before. Once. Just once.

But this wasn’t one.

This was millions.

I tried to focus on it, and that’s when I realized it wasn’t laughter anymore. Or maybe it never had been.

The sound rose and fell in waves,high,pitched, frantic, overlapping. A squeaking chirp. Almost like a squeal.

One of them might have sounded harmless.

But this was thousands.

No, millions. I was sure it had to be millions of them.

I felt my heart pound heavy in my chest as panic settled in. I needed out. So I ran.

I ran until my legs betrayed me and gave out. The smell of sulfur slowly filled my lungs as the world faded to black around me.

When I woke up again, there were voices calling my name. Real voices.

It took a long time before I understood what they were saying. Before I understood where I was.

I called back, my voice hoarse, dry, weak. 

It was people looking for me. They told me I’d been missing for five days.

Five days didn’t make sense. It felt like hours. Maybe less.

The search team walked me out the way they’d come in. Past a weathered sign at the edge of the trail.

**Zion’s Hill**, it read.

Someone noticed me staring at it and said, almost absentmindedly, “Yeah. They changed the name a while back.”

I asked what it used to be called.

He hesitated.

“Most people still call it Hell’s Gate.”

Nobody said anything after that.
