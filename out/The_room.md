They say the mind forgets to protect itself, eventually. That it tires. That the doors it locks start to come unlatched, one by one, until the house of you isn’t a house anymore—just a hall of echoes and dust.
I think that’s what’s happening to me.
It began with a smell.
Not rot. Not death. Not even mildew.
Bleach. And static.
You think static doesn’t have a smell, but it does. Burnt ozone. A scorched kind of silence.
It came from the wall behind my headboard. Just a whisper at first. Then a steady hum. Then words.
Whispers, muffled and halting, like someone speaking through gauze. Like they’d forgotten how to breathe. One syllable always stood out:
“Zero.” Over and over.
Sometimes it sounded like a name.
I live alone. I keep things simple. Everything in my apartment is cream, beige, or gray. Unobtrusive. Clean. My memories don’t like clutter. Or maybe I don’t.
But things began appearing. Small things.
A polaroid photo tucked into the fridge. It showed a hallway, unfamiliar—but somehow it felt like something I’d dreamt before. In the photo’s corner, written in red ink:
“Room 0.”
Then I found a postcard I never bought, depicting a building with no windows. Behind it, a caption:
“You checked in. Why haven’t you left?”
I couldn’t sleep. I started hearing a soft click at night. Like a slide carousel turning behind my eyes. Images I didn’t recognize flashing in my head:
A bed with no sheets.


A doorknob melting.


My own hand holding a key made of bone.


The number 0 carved into my arm.


I checked. There was no scar.
But sometimes, in certain lighting, the skin itched in the shape of a circle.
On the fifth night, I woke up standing in a hallway.
Not mine.
Everything was a little too tall. A little too soft around the edges. Like someone had poorly reconstructed reality from memory. The walls pulsed slightly. Breathing.
There were no doors—just brass plates, every few feet. Each one engraved with a different version of the same number:
“Zero”


“0”


“Ø”


“null”


I tried to turn back, but behind me: nothing. No door. No sound. Just silence that bent inward.
I chose a plate at random and pushed. The wall gave—like flesh—and I tumbled into a room identical to mine.
Only not.
The light was wrong. Too gray, like morning under a migraine. Everything was clean but… flattened.
Like it had been painted onto a memory and forgotten to dry.
The photographs started appearing everywhere now. On the nightstand. Pinned to the walls. Inside the cereal box.
Always the same hallway.
Always that damned number.
Some were blank except for a phrase:
“He’s trying to remember you.”
I don’t know who “he” is.
But last night, I heard him knocking from inside the wall.
Not on it. From within it.
I pressed my ear close. This time, he spoke clearly.
“You forgot,” he said, “but I didn’t.”
Then I blinked—
—and I was in a room with no walls. Just infinite brass doors hanging in black space. And a carousel screen blinking images above me like a god’s slideshow:
Me, screaming.


Me, weeping.


Me, older.


Me, with no face.


And there, across the void: a figure watching.
I couldn’t see his face. Just the glint of brass where his eyes should be. He held something in his hand.
A photograph.
He showed it to me.
It was me, in a straitjacket. Mouth open. Screaming. A brass number bolted to my chest:
“Patient 0.”
That’s when I realized—
I haven’t been trying to escape.
I’ve been trying to wake up.
But this place doesn’t have an exit. It only has more rooms. And each one knows me better than the last.

Because I built this place.
And I forgot I was still inside.
