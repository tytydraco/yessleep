Six days ago, my dad started digging a hole in our backyard. He’s been at it every day, sunrise to sunset, barely taking breaks. It’s a deep pit now, at least ten feet down, with the walls collapsing inward slightly from the weight of the loose dirt. But that’s not the strange part.

The strange part is why he says he’s digging it.

“It’s for your mom,” he told me on the first day, wiping sweat from his forehead. The shovel hit the ground with a heavy thud, sending a chill up my spine. My mom’s been missing for three weeks.

I didn’t question him at first. I mean, who would? Dad was grieving. He hadn’t been the same since she disappeared. He didn’t sleep much. Barely ate. Spent hours staring out the window at the backyard like he was waiting for something. When I asked him what happened to her, he’d just say, "She’ll come home soon."

But after three days of relentless digging, I started to worry. He hadn’t told anyone about what he was doing—not the neighbors, not the police, not even my aunt, who’s been staying with us since the disappearance. He just kept digging, muttering to himself under his breath.

By day four, the pit was massive, and my concern turned into fear.

"Dad," I said, standing at the edge of the hole, "what exactly are you doing?"

He looked up at me, his face pale and gaunt, eyes sunken from lack of sleep. "She’s coming," he whispered. "Your mom. She needs a place to go when she gets back."

"But… where is she?" I asked, my voice shaking. 

He just stared at me for a long moment, his expression unreadable. Then, with a slow, deliberate motion, he pointed to the hole.

I backed away, my heart racing. That night, I heard the sound of something moving around the house—heavy footsteps, creaking floorboards. I thought it was my dad at first, but when I checked his room, he was fast asleep, dirt still clinging to his hands and clothes.

That’s when I noticed the smell. It was faint at first, like damp earth and rotting wood. But as the night went on, it got stronger—pungent, suffocating. I couldn’t sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I could hear the soft scrape of metal against dirt, the steady rhythm of the shovel digging deeper and deeper into the earth.

By day five, the pit had become a nightmare. It was far too big for one person to dig in such a short amount of time. My dad didn’t even seem tired anymore. His movements were mechanical, robotic, like he was possessed by some unseen force. His eyes were hollow, his skin pale and waxy, but he just kept digging, deeper and deeper.

Last night, something changed. I woke up to the sound of my dad whispering. At first, I thought he was talking to himself, but then I heard another voice. Faint, almost imperceptible, but definitely there—like a soft, rasping breath just behind him. It wasn’t my aunt, and it wasn’t me.

I stood at the top of the stairs, listening, my heart pounding in my chest. The whispering grew louder, more insistent, until it was clear as day.

“Deeper.”

My legs felt like lead, but I forced myself to look out the window at the backyard. The pit was darker than usual, almost black, like it was absorbing all the light around it. And something was moving down there.

Something big.

I didn’t sleep at all after that. This morning, my dad didn’t say a word to me. He just picked up his shovel and went back to work, the dirt caving in around him as he dug deeper and deeper into the earth. His clothes hung off him like a scarecrow, his skin a sickly shade of gray.

I’m scared to ask him what he’s doing now. I’m scared of what he’ll say. But more than that, I’m scared of the thing in the pit. The thing that’s been whispering to him, guiding him, pulling him down further and further into the darkness.

It’s almost sunset now, and my dad just stopped digging for the first time in six days. He’s standing at the edge of the pit, staring down into it, the shovel resting loosely in his hands.

“She’s here,” he says quietly, not looking up. “Your mom’s here.”

And then he jumps in. 

I heard something move down there, something heavy and wet, like flesh on soil. The whispering has started again, louder this time. Closer. 

I don’t know what to do. The hole is still out there, waiting. And I can hear it now, too.

It’s calling my name.
