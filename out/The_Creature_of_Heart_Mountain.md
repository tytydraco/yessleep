I moved to Cody, Wyoming with my mom, dad, and younger brother in the spring of 1989— I had just turned 13 years old, and was pretty excited to essentially “start over” in a new town.  I was born in Buffalo, New York, and while I loved the city, I never really “fit in” so-to-speak; in fact, I was quite the “dweeb” one would say.

I didn’t have many friends when I was a kid.  I was a short, chubby kid with red hair, freckles, and glasses— God basically tattooed a “kick me” sign on my back from day one; I never stood a chance, so to say I was excited to move away from the constant torment I experience as an adolescent kid would be an understatement.

I was pretty naive; I thought moving to a new place would make things easier, but all it did was make me the short, chubby, red headed kid with freckles… who also happened to be new.

The house we moved into was a beautiful ranch home right on the outskirts of the mountains.  Every morning I woke up and looked outside to see the beautiful mountain ranges, bushy green trees, and smelled the country air— it was magical.  

The first summer once we moved was pretty uneventful; we spent most of the time finishing the moving process, getting the house sorted and all of the small maintenance issues dealt with before school started.  My dad was a handyman who was a master of any tool known to man, so the “fixer-upper” house they purchased was just another project.

I remember the way the house looked when we first pulled up to the land.  The windows were busted out, the siding was falling apart, and the roof looked as if it was the victim of a meteor shower.  The inside wasn’t much better— it smelled of cat urine, mold, and that old “musty” basement smell that reminded me of my great-grandma’s home back in Buffalo.  My dad, with the help of his brother, got the house in running shape in no time.

I finally had a home.

The entire upstairs was basically a second home, complete with a bathroom, 2 bedrooms, and a living room space.  My brother Sebastian was able to have his own room adjacent to mine.  He and I were four years apart; Sebastian always looked up to me.

I was his hero, and I always made it a point to watch over him and protect him like a big brother should, which is why August 28th, 1989 will always be the worst day of my life.

That Monday started like any other.  I had awoken from a pretty deep sleep to the smell of bacon, toast, and eggs.  My mom called us down for breakfast, and we both raced down the stairs to see who would get to the table first.  Sebastian won, but I let him— I always did.  

We dined like Kings on the feast that my mother had prepared for us.  This time next week, we’d both have our lunchboxes in our hands as we awaited the bus to pick us up for our first day of school, so we wanted to make our last week of summer meaningful.

The plan for the day was to ride our bikes near “Heart Mountain”, which was roughly 20 miles away.  There was a great bike train that led to the front of the mountain, and Sebastian and I were excited to do one last ride together.  Life back in the late 80s wasn’t like it is today— there were no real concerns about what we were doing, as long as we were back for supper.  On our bikes we’d get to the front of Heart Mountain in about two and a half hours, maybe a little more depending how much we stopped.  

My Star Wars watch said 8:08, which means we were late.  Sebastian and I grabbed our backpacks that we filled with snacks, drinks, and our compasses to help guide us on this “otherworldly adventure”.  We kissed mom goodbye, and hugged dad— he wasn’t the affectionate type— and we were on our way.

The ride to Heart Mountain was a joy.  I don’t know how we did it as kids because the thought of a 20 mile bike ride as I’m pushing 50 makes my skin crawl.  Even after all these years I still remember every tree, animal, and rock I saw along the way.  We arrived at our destination at a quarter til’ 11.  We got off our bikes, stretched our legs, and walked around for a bit.  There was a series of dark blue benches that were put there as a rest area for tourists and hikers who needed a rest— it felt like heaven.

We both sat down on a bench and unpacked our backpacks, grabbing a few snacks and water to refuel ourselves.  We didn’t have a plan after getting to Heart Mountain, but we decided to go forward and explore around the mountain.

“Can we climb a bit?” Sebastian said.  “I think it would be cool!”

He was so excited, but I knew climbing the mountain wasn’t something we should do— it was very dangerous and we weren’t prepared.  I put on my best smile and became the bad guy when I told him the bad news, but maybe at a later date when mom and dad were with us we could.  He was devastated, but ultimately understood.  

We continued to rest our legs on the bench.  I started thumbing through a comic book I had brought with me as Sebastian looked over my shoulder.  

“Batman is so cool,” Sebastian said as he pressed his finger on the page.  “Remember when we saw the movie?  It was the best!”

I smiled.  

We both read the comic book together, taking bites of our food in-between pages.  I made sure to not turn the page until Sebastian was done reading; he’d give me a little nudge on my shoulder when he was ready for the next page.

It was a beautiful August day, with the sun beaming down hard.  It had to be over 90 degrees, but with the wind and shade from the mountain, it was nice.  Eventually, Sebastian got bored and got to his feet. 

“I’m going to go look over there,” he said, pointing at the bushes.  “Maybe there’s a cool bug or something.  I’ve always wanted to catch a praying mantis!”

I nodded as I watched him walk over to the bushes and began to look for bugs.  He nearly fell into the bush at first, but quickly maintained his composure and caught himself.

“I’m fine!” he yelled out.

I’m not sure what happened, and truth be told it’s a mistake I’ll live with for the rest of my life.  I must have closed my eyes for just a minute and fallen asleep on the bench.  I woke up to a mosquito biting my leg, which I promptly swatted at it with my open palm.  When I awoke the sunlight was harsh and my watch read 1:12 p.m. - I was nearly asleep for an hour.  I looked around and did not see Sebastian anywhere.

“Sebastian!” I called out, hoping to hear his voice.  “Where are you?”

There was no answer.  I began to look around the bush where he was last seen, hoping he didn’t fall over and down the hill.  I saw broken twigs where he was standing and almost fell into the bush, but there were no signs of Sebastian.  Sebastian’s bike was missing, which made me believe he had rode off somewhere.  I hopped on my bike and started riding down the bike trail back to where we came in from. 

I must have rode my bike a good mile before I came to an abrupt stop.  I found Sebastian’s bike laying on the side of the trail in the grass.  I immediately rushed over to see what happened.  There were no signs of crashing or any damage to the bike— it looked like he got off on his own.  I looked off to the side of the trail where I saw dense woods that seemed to go on for miles.  I grabbed my bag and started to look deeper in the woods, not knowing where it would lead me.

“Sebastian!” I called out again.  “Come on, this isn’t funny!”

I was hoping he was playing a prank on me.  I was fully expecting him to burst out from a bush and scream “Got you!” in his high-pitched voice, but that never came to be.  I pressed forth through the grass and deeper into the woods.  The harsh sunlight was now completely shrouded by the thick shrubbery of the trees, which caused a sudden drop in temperature that could be felt immediately.  

I kept walking until I came to a ravine which separated two sides of the woods from one another.  I looked to the left and then to the right, then decided to head to the right, back toward the mountain; maybe Sebastian heard the rushing water of the ravine and wanted to take a look.

I kept calling out for him, but my voice merely just echoed off the trees.  Just as I was giving up hope, I saw an object off to the distance.  I immediately headed that direction, only to find a single red Converse sneaker— the same shoes that Sebastian was wearing.  

“Sebastian!”

No response.  Just as I went to say his name again, I heard a familiar voice off in the distance.

“Caleb!” 

Sebastian’s voice seemed frantic.

“Sebastian!” I screamed.  “Where are you?”

There was a pause before the same voice called out again.

“I’m over here!  Near the cave!”

Cave?  I didn’t see a cave.  I kept calling out for Sebastian, hoping his voice would get louder the closer I got.  I continued to search furiously, but I came to an abrupt stop at a large rock foundation that appeared to be the cave Sebastian was referring to.  The cave was tucked away near two large trees and shrubbery that almost shielded it completely.  

“Sebastian!” I called out once more.  “Are you in the cave?”

There was no answer.  Suddenly, my sinuses were overcome by a foul stench— to this day I cannot describe it, but it nearly made me vomit.  The closer I walked toward the cave, the stronger the odor was.  I had to stop walking to catch my breath— and maintain my composure to not vomit all over my feet.  My voice was shaking, but I called out again.

“Sebastian!”

The voice answered, but it wasn’t Sebastian’s— it was almost a soft growl, harsh, and didn’t sound like anything I’ve heard before.

“Come closer.”

My eyes were wide.  I slowly approached the cave and peered inside the darkness.  There was nothing to see other than the absence of life and color itself, like a black hole in the center of our universe.  The unknown pulled me closer, and no matter how much I resisted, I kept inching closer.

Until I heard the growl again.

I stepped back as I saw a long, white arm out-stretch from inside the cave; its fingers were bony and thin, almost like branches on a tree.  My heart was pounding continuously, so loud that I could not hear anything but my own panicked heartbeat. Peeking out from the cave was a small, almost perfectly round head. I couldn’t see much, but its eyes were like two pools of oil, completely void of any color or happiness.  The creature stared at me, and I was frozen in place from its gaze.  It motioned its long and skinny finger for me to come closer, taunting me.

“Caleb!” 

Sebastian’s voice called out from inside the cave.  His voice caused me to look away from the creature, and before I knew it, I felt a force around my leg.  The figure’s long arms out-stretched like Mr. Fantastic, grabbing me by my ankle.  Its fingers wrapped around my ankle like vines around a tree as it began to drag me across the ground and toward the cave.  I dug my fingers into the ground, trying to find any sort of resistance, but the strength of the creature was too much.  

I watched in horror as I rapidly approached the creature, realizing there was nothing I could do.  In a last ditch effort to save myself, I was able to grab a loose rock with my right hand and smashed it against the creature’s hand, which was just enough force to break its grasp of my ankles.  The creature immediately retreated into the cave as I sprung to my feet and ran as fast as I could.

I don’t think I stopped once.  I closed my eyes and ran as fast as I could until I came to the ravine.  I made my way back to the bike trail where I grabbed my bike and rode as fast as I could home.  The entire time I kept thinking of Sebastian and how I left him there, but I had no idea what to do.  I just had to get home and get help.  Dad would know what to do.

I arrived home shortly before 5:00.  I rushed inside and nearly collapsed onto the floor from exhaustion.  My mom rushed to my side after hearing me collapse onto the linoleum floor of the kitchen.  She had a panicked look on her face.

“Goodness,” she said as she helped me to my feet.  “What happened?  Are you alright?  Where’s your brother?”

All of these questions were shot at me like rapid fire.  I couldn’t muster a response.  

I collapsed into my mom’s arms and told her what happened.  My dad got up from his recliner quickly and asked what happened.  I told him where we went and what I saw.  I could tell he didn’t believe it, but he got into his truck and made the drive down to Heart Mountain.

I sat at the kitchen table with my mom.  She lit up a cigarette as she stared at the phone that hung on the kitchen wall, waiting for a call from dad, hopefully to hear Sebastian was safe and sound and they were on their way home.

Around 6:15 the phone rang.  My mom leaped from her chair and answered before the 2nd ring could be heard.

“Hello?”

I watched in real time as her eyes started to swell with tears, as the voice on the other end told her the news she didn’t want to hear.  She slid down the kitchen wall, phone grasped in her hand as she sobbed uncontrollably.  I didn’t know what to do or say, so I sat in the chair and just listened to her cries.

My dad arrived home a little before 9.  His eyes were red from crying, and he was a man who I never once saw cry or show any emotion.  Behind him was a police officer who tipped his hat toward my mom, who was now on her 10th cigarette of the night.  The officer looked at me with a smile.

“Sir,” the officer said, looking at my dad.  “Ma’am,” he said as he whipped his head toward my mother.  “May I speak with your son?”

They both nodded as the officer sat down at the kitchen table across from me.  I was resting my head on my arms on the table, looking off into the distance.  I felt completely numb and helpless.   The cop pulled out a pen and a small notebook as he cleared his throat.

“Caleb?” he said.  “My name is Officer Braddock.  I need to ask you a few questions about what happened earlier.  Can you do that for me?”

I nodded.

“Good,” he said as he licked the tip of his pen.  “Can you walk me through what happened today at the mountain?”

I gulped.  I knew I had to admit that I had fallen asleep and lost sight of my brother— this was all my fault.

“We rode our bikes to Heart Mountain,” I said as he took a deep breath.  “We wanted to have one last adventure before school starts.  We were sitting on one of the benches near the front of the mountain and I must have fallen asleep.”  I felt my dad’s eyes glare a hole through me.  I looked at my parents with eyes full of tears and remorse.  “I’m sorry!” I said in between sobs.  “I didn’t mean to!  I was just so tired… I’m sorry!”

My mom came over and held me tightly. To my surprise, my father came over and placed his large hand on my shoulder as a sign of solidarity and support.

“We found his bike,” he said.  “It was near the trail.”

I nodded.

“I did, too,” I said as I wiped my eyes.  “I went looking for him.  I went down near the ravine to look for him.  I heard his voice.”

Officer Braddock’s eyes widened.

“You heard his voice?” he said with a raised eyebrow.  “Where at?”

“I don’t know.  It sounded far, but I kept following the voice.  He said he was near a cave.”

“A cave?” Officer Braddock said, interrupting.  “What cave?”

“There was a cave in the woods, near the ravine.”

Officer Braddock took note.

“Could you lead us there?”

I nodded my head.

We all got into Officer Braddock’s car and made the trip to Heart Mountain.  Sebastian’s bike was still there, although it was blocked off by yellow crime scene tape. I lead Office Braddock and my parents into the woods and near the ravine.  I kept looking for Sebastian’s red Converse sneaker that I dropped when I heard Sebastian’s voice, but it wasn’t there.  I remember seeing a large tree that had a thick stump toward the base, which I treated as a landmark.

“The cave is near here,” I said with conviction. “I remember it all.”

The forest was dark and thick, and the only light we had was illuminated by the flashlights of my father and Officer Braddock.  I saw the two trees that the cave sat between, but there was no cave.  It had vanished completely as if it never existed in the first place.

Laying in the middle of where the cave should have been was a single red Converse sneaker.  Officer Braddock pushed me away as he walked closer to the shoe; he bent down and inspected it without touching it.  He notated a blood stain that was on the laces.

I watched as my mom dug her head into my dads arms, sobbing uncontrollably.  My dad grabbed me and held me close as well, wanting to protect us.

The search for Sebastian went on for weeks, then months, years, and eventually was filed away as a cold case.  The only evidence we had was his lone shoe and his abandoned bike.  

We got updates from Officer Braddock nearly every day, but as the months went on, the updates stopped.  Sebastian’s disappearance went cold, and every night I laid awake, thinking about the creature I saw… the cave… how it wasn’t there when we went back.  Did I imagine that?  Was it all just my mind playing tricks on me?  I saw the creature clear as day.  I felt its grasp on my ankles… I watched as it pulled me closer to it.  I felt every bit of it. 

Even thought Sebastian's disappearance was never solved, I know what I saw that day, and I know what happened to my baby brother.

He lies somewhere in Heart Mountain.

Every year on the anniversary of his disappearance, I make the trip back to Heart Mountain with hopes to find his remains, and every year I leave with more questions than answers.

Sometimes I feel like I can hear his voice through the wind rustling the trees.

And sometimes I see the cave deep in the woods, staring a hole through me.

"He's in here" I hear it whisper.  

Maybe next time I'll finally give into temptation and see my baby brother again.

Until then, I just have his memories to remember, and my regrets to keep me up at night.
