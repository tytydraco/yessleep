My grandfather’s journal demonstrated how as a young man he was not yet the hardened, unperturbable elder I knew. He was still in his twenties at the time he wrote it, but what I found most telling was that the war itself seemed not to be the transformative event for him. It was Wewelsburg. Fighting the Nazis had certainly made a capable man out of him, but whatever happened in that village and in that castle affected him more profoundly. It scared him in a way the battlefield never had. Reading the journal also allowed me a window into his conscience. While he didn’t state it directly, I sensed him weighing a heavy, ethical question as he listened to the things Müller said and he prepared to go into the ritual. Was this the “burden no one else will understand” my grandfather warned me about when I was a teenager? I needed to know.

July 21, 1945

Everything was ready at Wewelsburg Castle by 2200 hours. The storm let up, but the rain clouds that blotted out the stars looked to linger into the night. Müller was still handcuffed when we walked him from his chamber in the southwest tower to the generals’ hall in the north tower. Pettit’s men had already prepared everything as Müller instructed. The Gundestrup Cauldron, the authentic, silver one, was at the center of the black sun symbol on the floor. Beside it was the text of the ritual itself printed in an official Nazi Party book with a solid wooden cover featuring the black sun on the front and double sig runes on the back. The book was intended to look old, but like the gold cauldron, it was entirely of modern construction. Arranged around the silver cauldron were four more items found elsewhere in the castle: a wooden crate, a wooden spear with a metal blade, and a pair of swords. The old-looking weapons were of unknown vintage. Flames flickered from small torches mounted to each of the twelve pillars around the circular hall. Unbeknownst to Müller, Edith was in the corridor outside the room. Unbeknownst to Pettit, she was armed with my Smith & Wesson revolver.

Pettit unlocked Müller’s handcuffs. “You are making a wise decision, Captain Pettit,” Müller said, stretching his arms and cracking his neck. “When this is over, even you will understand what we Germans were so close to accomplishing.”

Pettit did not react. “You’re sure you don’t need the sun for this?”

Müller gave a knowing grin. “We did. But not anymore. Have your men stand between each pillar. That space is mine.” He pointed to the space between the two pillars at the northmost point of the room.

“Do as he says,” Pettit instructed.

Schayes and I followed Arizin, Sharman, and the rest of Pettit’s squad.

Müller spoke once we were in place. “There are eleven of you. With me, twelve. It is fitting this is the exact number required. This was fated.” He opened the crate and held up a smoothed, varnished tree branch slightly over a foot in length. Then he held up a flat stone engraved with a Germanic rune. There were eleven of each, all with different runes, and he handed them to each of us. He then took his spot between the two remaining pillars. “When I salute, strike the rune stone with the branch six times. Like this.” He struck the stone in his hand with the blunt end of a branch six evenly spaced times. He handed the stone and branch to Pettit. Then Müller lifted the book. “I will read from the Gnosis Boreus, translated to German from Old Norse. Before I begin the reading, two of you must cross the pair of swords over the spear of Wotan.” Some of us flinched as Müller picked up the spear, but he merely walked back to his place between the two open pillars.

“Mikan,” Pettit said, nodding at the swords. He and I picked them up from the center of the room and walked up to Müller. He lifted the spear with the blade pointed at the ceiling. Pettit placed one sword across it and I the other.

Müller began in English. “The flame of the resurrection of the polar and spiritual north, the flame of the Hyperborean, will transform civilizational reality. It will be the final restoration, putting an end to the history of false civilizations. The final victory will grant spiritual abundance and will see a lost continent rise out of the abysses of the past. A spiritual continent will reappear in the world of men, and a new age on earth will dawn…Aryans, return your swords to the black sun.”

Pettit and I set them down in the center and went back to our places around the room.

Müller laid down the spear and opened the book, switching to German. “Ancestors, I have tidings for you. The wolf howls. Summer thaws. Winter has gone. The wind is low. The sun is high. Its course is long. The sea runs strongly.”

Then he made a Nazi salute. We looked at one another, uncomfortable. But then, as if all of us suddenly understood, we raised our blunt, varnished branches, and struck our rune stones six times. It produced a series of loud, hollow echos in the circular hall.

Müller continued. “These are my tidings. Blood up to heaven. Heaven down to earth. A cup full of earth. Mead in abundance. The roots are bountiful. Season of sun. These are my tidings.”

He saluted again and we struck the rune stones.

“Power of the raven be thine. Power of the eagle be thine. Power of the storm be thine. Power of the moon be thine. Power of the sun be thine. Power of the sea. Power of the land. Power of the blood. Power of heaven.”

He saluted. We struck. The echoes seemed to persist longer each time, making the flames from the torches blow and flicker. The ritual continued like this for some time. I didn’t know how long I expected it to take for a spirit to appear, but it evidently would not come quickly.

Finally, Müller closed the book. “Captain, have your men take their torches and follow me. They may leave their rune stones here.”

“Do it,” said Pettit.

We set down the stones and branches and lifted the torches from their mounts on the columns. Then we followed Müller single file down the spiral staircase to the crypt. Müller carried the Gundestrup Cauldron himself. We descended beneath the crypt’s 30-foot-high domed ceiling. I looked up at the ornate swastika sculpted at the top of it. I felt a sense of shame for what I was participating in, yet also a begrudging responsibility to root out what this ritual was before it potentially caused more harm than it already had. Müller set the cauldron on the concrete pedestal ringing the cold firepit across from the urn containing the silver Totenkopf rings. There were three bronze bowls, one containing a mound of dirt and another holding pine needles. The third bowl was empty, and beside it, a ceremonial SS dagger. Together, the cauldron, the urn, and the three bowls were placed equal distances from each other in a circle around the pit. On the twelve smaller pedestals around the wall were twelve pagan ritual masks made from bone, wood, straw, branches, antlers, and wolf’s or boar’s fur. They were all variations of the mask Müller wore when we found him. Rough sticks and tree branches surrounded the firepit and curved pedestal in an outer concentric ring.

Müller told us to don the masks. Mine fit snuggly around my face. I don’t know what I expected to happen, but when I looked at the shrouded faces of the soldiers around me, I lost all sense of them as men. I did not make note of who stood where before we put them on. Now, aside from Müller, I didn’t know who anyone was. I realized that was the masks’ very purpose. He had us pick up the branches and sticks and lay them atop the cold pit in the crypt’s center. We each held our torches to the branches until a large fire blazed in the pit. We returned to our places at the twelve outer pedestals. Müller stayed by the curved pedestal and slit his palm with the ceremonial dagger. He squeezed his hand into a fist and leaked blood into the empty bronze bowl. He instructed us to do the same, starting in a counterclockwise order around the room. I was next to last. The mask’s eyeholes forced me to focus only on what was directly in front of me, and when my turn came, I stalled holding the dagger. Without considering why, I slit my palm but did not squeeze blood into the bowl. I did it discreetly so no one would see. Once we all had bled and taken our places along the wall, Müller returned to the center. He took a handful of dirt from the first bowl and dropped it into the cauldron. Then he took a handful of pine needles from the next bowl and dropped it into the cauldron as well. He poured the bowl of blood into the cauldron last.

Müller read in German from the book by firelight. “The bracken is red. Its shape has been hidden. The sun has freed the wings of birds. Season of water. Season of fire. Season of grain. Season of fruit. These are my tidings. I call upon the powers that exist in the land, sea, and sky. I call upon you at the peak of the year.” He waved a hand slowly back and forth over the urn of Totenkopf rings. “Let our dead be remembered. Let them find a place at our table. Let them find vitality and ire in our remembering.” Müller’s voice gradually lowered in volume until it was barely above a whisper. I had to concentrate to hear him. “Hear us ancestors and honored dead. We have made our offerings. We have spoken our tidings. Remember us. Watch over us through the light of the year. And the dark.”

By then I could no longer hear him. We heard only the crackling of flames. Then a low thrumming that grew steadily louder. I watched the men’s masked heads look up and around as the thrumming telepathic voice returned. The single syllables began to run together. It wasn’t German, nor was it English. It was a language I had never heard at all. One of the eight alcoves in the domed ceiling surrounding the ornate swastika flashed. Then another. Then two more. And three more. The alcoves glowed on and off at intervals. The shifting light and dark became disorienting. When lit, they were like windows to the outside at midday. But they were not windows and the night by then was dark. I felt heat radiating down on me. It felt different from the heat of the fire. It felt like the sun. I recalled in Pettit’s briefing how he said the Hyperboreans could conserve light energy and store it within their granite temples. I wondered, had Müller turned the castle crypt into a form of Hyperborean battery? The orange flames in the firepit suddenly extinguished. The pine, soil, and blood mixture in the cauldron gave off fumes, then a thick smoke, and a bright white flame. The light from the alcoves went dark and the thrumming voice ceased. The white flame burned until it consumed the mixture in the cauldron and extinguished. The crypt was now completely dark. If the other men felt as I did, then we were all nervous but too afraid to move.

I heard Müller’s voice again, coming from near the cauldron. “The circle is unbroken. The ancestors awoken. Hail to the ice and the soil. Hail to the root and the branch, tooth and claw, fur and feather, of earth, sky, and sun.”

Then he stopped. The crypt was silent. Then I heard the sound of a body landing on the stone floor. I waited to see if Captain Pettit took any action. When he didn’t, I turned on a small flashlight I kept on my belt and proceeded carefully toward the center.

“Who is that? What are you doing?” I heard Pettit’s voice say from across the room.

I shined my small beam of light on Müller. He had fallen on his back. His mask was still on and I saw his bare chest rising and falling. I removed my mask and then his. I gasped when I saw his face. He looked afraid and distraught. His eyes were wide with terror. “They’re not what we thought,” his voice trembled in German. “I’m lost…I’m damned…If only…If only I could…If…” He stopped speaking and his chest stopped moving.

Another man rushed over to me and took off his mask. It was Schayes. “What happened to him?” he asked.

“I don’t know. He was about to say—” I stopped myself. Something was happening to Müller’s face. He lifted his head and focused his eyes upward. His lip quivered and his nostrils flared. He gritted his teeth and his mouth formed a familiar expression that was truly chilling.

“He looks just like Sabina,” Schayes remarked.

He was right. It was the same look, a frozen grin that bared all of his teeth while his eyes gazed upward as if staring at something invisible to us and knowing something we did not.

Pettit and Arizin dropped their masks and hurried over. “What happened? Did it work or not?” Arizin asked.

“I saw his lips moving. What did he say to you, Mikan?” asked Pettit, pointing another flashlight.

I had to think. “He said they’re not what we thought.”

Pettit was frustrated. “What does that mean? What who thought? Them? We have to snap him out of it. Maybe we can—”

He stopped and we all looked down. Müller’s grin had disappeared. Then Müller sat bolt upright at the waist and belted out a wailing, moaning scream that rattled our eardrums and echoed off the walls and dome. The others scrambled away. I covered my ears and stepped back as Müller stood up. The scream did not cease. A brutal wind picked up inside, seeming to come from Müller himself. The alcoves lit up like flashbulbs in an effect that was almost blinding. I shielded my eyes and backpedaled away from Müller. I saw a change in his eyes, like the human light in them had gone out and another had come in. The whites of his eyes glowed bright and there was another glow deep in his throat as the scream persisted. There was nothing human about him now.

It was like a freak storm had entered the crypt. The wind hurled branches, dirt, pine needles, and embers from the firepit around like a cyclone. The rest of the men tore off their masks and huddled for cover on the ground. The Hyperborean—it no longer fit to call him Müller—wailed and cried out. Tears streamed down its face and it grabbed its head in agony. It bumped into walls and knocked over the urn, spilling the Totenkopf rings, which were then hurled around by the cyclone winds, striking me like projectiles and cutting my skin. While this was happening, the telepathic voice thrummed inside my head. I couldn’t tell just yet, but the thoughts the Hyperborean projected began to resemble English.

I yelled for Schayes. Together, I hoped he and I could escape. I spotted him across the room but tripped over one of the other soldiers who was trapped on the floor with branches grafted to his back and head. “Help me…help…me…” the soldier begged as the branch sprouted twigs that grew out from his mouth and pushed out his eyeballs. He dropped dead on the floor before I could do anything. I stood up and tried to reach Schayes again, but it was already too late. He had ducked for cover against the wall, but now the wall had bonded itself to him. His face was half-embedded in the granite. I saw his eye point toward me. Blood leaked out from under his eyelid and nostrils, blood that immediately turned to sand. Schayes was gone.

I feared I didn’t have long. I saw Sharman facing the Hyperborean. He shouted Bible verses to no effect as glowing embers repeatedly stuck to his body. I shielded my face from the projectiles and wind and headed for the spiral staircase. I looked up at the instant the alcoves flashed again, blinding me momentarily. Once I could see, Pettit was in front of me. Pine needles were sprouting from under his skin, piercing out through his pores. “I’m sorry, Lieutenant,” he said shamefully, with needles growing even out of his tongue. Pettit collapsed and blood pooled around him.

I had almost made it to the stairs when a voice, in English and clear as day, entered my head. “Turn around, Jack,” it said. I shuddered and looked behind me. The Hyperborean was there. It no longer resembled Müller at all. It was misshapen, like Müller’s skeleton was stretching and breaking apart trying to take on a new form. Its screaming had stopped. All I heard in my ears was the battering wind, but in my head, I heard its voice. “Why did you bring me back?” it asked.

“I don’t know,” I said aloud, uncertain if I needed to or if it would simply read my thoughts.

“I’m hurting people. I don’t belong,” it said.

“Are you going to hurt me?”

It held out its hand and looked at it.

I looked at my own palm. I hadn’t added my blood to the others’. “Is that why not?” I asked.

It didn’t answer directly. “We had our age. Long ago. This world now…it would be better if…it forgot us again.”

I tried to understand. “Are you still Wolfgang Müller?”

“I am him. And I am not. Being right about us…does not make him right.”

I tried to think about what it meant. Then the loud crack of a gunshot broke through the howl of the wind. Edith stood behind me at the bottom of the spiral staircase, trembling, holding my Smith & Wesson in both hands with her arms outstretched. I looked back at the Hyperborean. In its chest was a bleeding bullet hole, and on its face was the same idyllic, closed smile I had seen in the villagers when I arrived in Wewelsburg. The Hyperborean, Müller, whatever it was now, fell to its knees and slumped over onto the floor. The wind died and the cacophony stopped. I tried to follow Edith up the stairs, but I could hardly walk. Being near the Hyperborean had drained me. She must have dragged me out of the castle, as I awoke outside some hours later, having passed out in the wake of the terrible ordeal.

United States Army (Ret.)

Addendum: May 1, 1991

I never received an official debrief after leaving Wewelsburg. Major General Barton informed me that as far as the U.S. Army was concerned, Captain Pettit, Lieutenant Arizin, Corporal Schayes, Chaplain Sharman, and six others were killed in action driving an SS remnant out of the castle. Anyone in the federal government orchestrating Operation Oxcart never spoke with me. Anything I could have told the press would have sounded too preposterous to believe. Perhaps it was cleaner and simpler for the government to ignore me and disavow anything I might say. I filed an official request to send a doctor, a rabbi, and a priest to the Wewelsburg villagers, but I don’t know if it was ever fulfilled. Edith and Ella may have lived out their days thinking I abandoned them after I promised them I wouldn’t. I hope they and the others received the help they needed. I did not return to Germany until after the post-Soviet reunification. I ventured back to Wewelsburg when I did. The castle had been restored, and the town around it, while still small, had grown. I met no residents who still knew of the sisters, and no one who had ever even heard the word ‘Hyperborean.’

Final note from Jack’s grandson:

My grandfather’s burden is clear to me now. If what he wrote is true, then everything we’ve been taught about human evolution and the development of civilizations is wrong. Again, he was not an attention seeker and had nothing to gain by writing this account and sitting on it for nearly 80 years. If posting this here gains any sort of traction at all, then the scientific community and historians will be the first to dismiss and criticize it. I think the real ethical quandary is, if what the Nazis believed about Hyperborea is true, is acknowledging that in any way the same as justifying the atrocities the Nazis committed? I believe my grandfather struggled deeply with that question. While it’s easier for me to say given that I wasn’t there, I think the answer is pretty clear. No, it is not the same. And the evidence for that rests in something the Hyperborean itself told him. When my grandfather asked it if it was still Wolfgang Müller, it said “Being right about us does not make him right.” In other words, Müller’s knowledge of and desire to resurrect Hyperborea does not excuse or condone the war crimes he committed in service of that goal. It’s the ultimate expression of ends not justifying terrible means. Even the Hyperborean saw it [that way.](https://connorgunnin.com/)
