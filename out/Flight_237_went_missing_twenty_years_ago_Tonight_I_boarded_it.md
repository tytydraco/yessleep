It was supposed to be a routine business trip for my father and brother. They boarded Flight 237 with every intention of returning home in a few days. I remember standing at the airport, waving goodbye to them, completely unaware that it would be the last time I’d see them.

Flight 237 vanished without a trace. No wreckage was found, no distress signals sent. It was as if the plane had been swallowed by the sky. The search went on for months, and then years, but hope faded into sorrow, and sorrow turned into a gnawing emptiness that never left.

Our family tried to move on, but the shadow of that lost flight hung over us like a curse. My mother never stopped looking at the sky, as if she expected to see them walking back down the driveway one day. I grew up haunted by the mystery, the unanswered questions. What happened to them? Did they suffer? Did they cry out for help that never came?

Twenty years passed, and I built a life for myself far from the painful memories. I avoided flying whenever possible, but some things can’t be escaped. My job required me to take a flight to a distant city, and after much hesitation, I booked the ticket. I felt a chill as I boarded, a sense of impending doom that I couldn’t shake.

The plane took off without incident, and I tried to relax. But an hour into the flight, the cabin lights flickered. The hum of the engines faltered, and the plane was suddenly plunged into darkness. The emergency lights glowed an eerie red, casting long shadows down the aisle. I felt the plane start to descend, not in a smooth glide but in a sickening drop.

Panic erupted. I fumbled for my seatbelt, my heart pounding. That’s when I saw them. My father and brother, sitting in the row across from me, staring straight ahead with vacant eyes. They looked exactly as they had twenty years ago, untouched by time. The other passengers… they were all the same people who had been on Flight 237.

Faces I had seen in the news, in the endless memorials and vigils. They were all here, with me, on this doomed flight. I blinked, trying to dispel the vision, but it remained. The air grew colder, and I could see my breath misting in front of me.

I tried to call out to them, but my voice was swallowed by the oppressive silence. My father turned his head slowly, his eyes locking onto mine. They were empty, hollow, like windows into an endless void. My brother’s hand reached out, skeletal and trembling.

“Why didn’t you save us?” His voice was a whisper, barely audible over the growing roar of the wind outside.

“I… I couldn’t,” I stammered, tears streaming down my face. “I didn’t know how.”

The plane continued its uncontrolled descent. The other passengers began to move, their motions jerky and unnatural, like puppets on strings. They all turned to face me, their eyes accusing, mouths opening in silent screams.

I was paralyzed with terror, unable to move, unable to look away. The temperature dropped further, frost creeping up the windows. The red emergency lights flickered again, casting grotesque shadows that twisted and writhed like living things.

The overhead compartments began to open and close on their own, the sound echoing through the cabin like a series of gunshots. The seats around me started to shake violently, as if something was trying to break free from within.

I could hear a low, guttural moan rising from the depths of the plane, a sound that seemed to vibrate through my bones. The passengers, my father and brother included, started to chant in unison, a language I couldn’t understand. Their voices merged into a haunting, otherworldly dirge that filled the air with a sense of dread.

I clutched my seat, knuckles white, as the plane plummeted faster. The windows shattered, letting in a howling wind that tore through the cabin. Papers and debris flew around in a chaotic whirlwind. My father leaned closer, his face inches from mine.

“Join us,” he whispered, his breath icy on my skin.

I screamed, closing my eyes, wishing it all to end. The plane shook violently, and I could feel it breaking apart. My body was thrown against the seat, and then everything went black.

When I woke up, I was lying on a cold, hard surface. The air was thick and heavy, filled with the scent of decay. I struggled to sit up, my body aching. I was in a cavernous, dimly lit space, the remnants of the plane scattered around me.

The passengers were there too, standing in a circle around a dark, pulsating mass at the center. My father and brother stood closest to it, their faces expressionless. The mass seemed to breathe, expanding and contracting rhythmically, emitting a faint, eerie glow.

I tried to stand, but my legs refused to cooperate. I crawled forward, compelled by an unseen force. As I neared the center, I could hear whispers, voices from the mass calling to me, beckoning me closer.

I reached out, my hand trembling. The surface of the mass was cold and slick, like the skin of a serpent. It pulsated under my touch, and the whispers grew louder, more insistent.

“Join us,” they repeated, over and over.

I felt a sharp pain in my chest, and I screamed as my vision blurred. The last thing I saw was my father and brother, their eyes now glowing with an unnatural light, their mouths twisted into grotesque smiles.

I don’t know how long I was unconscious. When I came to, I was back in my seat on the plane. The cabin was silent, the lights dim. The other passengers were gone, and the plane was steady, cruising at a normal altitude.

I looked around, my heart racing. Was it all a dream? A hallucination? But then I saw it. My father’s watch, lying on the seat next to me, still ticking, untouched by time.

The plane landed without further incident, and I stumbled off, clutching the watch. No one else seemed to remember what had happened. The passengers and crew went about their business, oblivious.

But I know the truth. Flight 237 never really vanished. It’s out there, somewhere, waiting. And now, so am I.
