When I first opened my eyes, the very first thing I felt was the cold humidity creeping through what I later realized was a waterproof suit. The fabric crackled against my skin every time I moved, like it wasn’t even meant for me. Above me, a canopy of interwoven branches blocked almost all the light. The forest felt… like it was holding its breath. And so was I.

I tried sitting up—slowly, because my head was heavy and my heart was beating way too fast. And then I realized: I couldn’t remember anything. Not my name. Not where I was. Not who I was. The only thing that existed in my mind were numbers.

765344.

I didn’t know why I knew them, only that they were there, fixed in my thoughts like a burn scar.

Every attempt to remember something else was swallowed by a dark, suffocating void. I stared at my gloved hands, then at the suit—dark yellow, reinforced, airtight. The kind of thing you’d wear for survival… or exploration. But of what?

Then I heard a rustling behind me.

I froze.
It wasn’t wind. And it didn’t sound like an animal either. Too slow. Too steady. Like background noise.

The numbers started pulsing in my skull, getting louder, more insistent, like a word I was trying to recall but never could.

I walked for what felt like hours, trying to keep panic away—but when you don’t remember anything, what exactly is there to fear?

It was only later that I realized my feet were too small for the boots I was wearing.
And the suit had no zipper. No opening. No way to remove it.

As I kept walking through the shadows of the forest, I came across something impossible: an old rotary phone hanging from its cord in the middle of nowhere. No houses around, nothing man-made for miles. Yet the phone looked perfectly intact, as if someone had placed it there for me.

The forest seemed to hush itself around it, as if waiting for a dial tone that would never come.

I dialed the only numbers I had—765344.

It rang for a long time before the call connected.
Then a silence.
Then a disturbed-sounding voice.

I tried to say I needed help, but the line cut. Moments later, I heard a phone ringing again—but not the one in front of me. The sound echoed through the fog and trees. I couldn’t tell where from, so I followed it, my headache morphing into a deep pressure behind my eyes.

Some time later, I slipped between two trees and tore my arm open. Or at least I thought I had. Blood dripped for a moment, then stopped. When I lifted my sleeve, I expected a wound—but instead, I found a sequence of five numbers carved into my skin:

39526.

No scar. No cut. Just… numbers.
Different from the ones echoing in my mind.

I kept searching until I reached the source of the ringing: another phone. Yellow this time.

The closer I got, the hotter it became inside the suit. My visor fogged over completely. The heat was unbearable. Since I had already torn part of the suit, I tried ripping it more to get some air.

As more of my skin was exposed, a horror unfolded in front of me: numbers. Hundreds of five-digit numbers. Not tattoos—carvings. Deep, necrotized scabs covering my body.

Any hope I had of escaping that forest evaporated.

The ringing got louder, the pain in my skull became blinding. Out of instinct, I grabbed the receiver. The ringing stopped.

Then came a tone—11 beeps.

In desperation, I dialed one of the numbers carved into my thigh. Nothing. Not even a dial tone. I tried again. Still nothing.

Frustration took over—I punched the phone. Hard enough to break my knuckles. But even as the bones cracked, my blood stopped instantly, and I watched my hand repair itself in a nauseating, unnatural way.

The phone started ringing again.

Then something clicked.
The tone. Eleven beeps.
Maybe the answer wasn’t one number, but a sequence.

My eyes scanned my skin wildly until I saw what I’d uncovered earlier:

39526.
What did it mean?
And the ones in my head—765344…

Suddenly, deep inside, from a memory buried so far I couldn’t reach it, a voice whispered the right sequence. I don’t know how, but I knew it was the one.

My fingers shook on the rotary dial. I dialed slowly, painfully, until the last digit.

The tone rang 11 times.
Then a voice—relieved, almost emotional—said:

“You’re back.”

The forest dissolved. Light exploded around me.
I woke up in a white room, in a bed.

A figure with a hat, face blurred, stood beside me.

“Did you find the number?”
Their voice sounded almost desperate.

The number… yes… I had dialed it. It was something like… 39, then 6, then 25, then 76… 55? 44…?
No.

It slipped away. Everything slipped away.

The figure’s posture collapsed. It nodded, disappointed, and walked out.

As I drifted off, I heard one last sentence:

“He’s no longer viable. Move on to the next one.”

I later learned I had been in a coma for six months. They sent me home with no explanation. No identity. No reassurance that the house they put me in actually belonged to me.

And even now, I’m not sure who I am…
or what really happened in that forest.
