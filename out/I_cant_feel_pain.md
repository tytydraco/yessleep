I was born with a really rare disorder. It’s called Congenital Insensitivity to Pain and Anhydrosis, or CIPA, for short. Basically, there’s a disconnection between my pain-sensing nerves and the part of my brain that’s supposed to receive pain signals.

Let me give you an example: when you hurt yourself, your nerves will do you the honour of telling your brain “ouch, let’s not do that again”. Mine don’t.

Another part of my condition is that my body is unable to regulate temperature. Basically, I can’t sweat. It’s starting to sound kind of nice, isn’t it? A sweat-free, pain-free life… what could there possibly be to complain about? Well, because of this, my body is unable to cool itself down, leaving me at risk of overheating and possibly dying from heatstroke. The same applies for being too cold- I could get hypothermia and not even know.

What I’m trying to tell you is my body is fucked.

My first ever memory is of Mum cooking dinner. She’d left the kitchen unattended for a minute, so my four year old brain had the bright idea of grabbing a chair, dragging it over to the stove, climbing up, and submerging my hand in a boiling pot of spaghetti. The bubbling water tickled my fingers, and I watched in awe as flakes of my skin began peeling away, mixing with the pasta. It was only when my mum let out a blood curdling scream that I knew what I’d done was wrong.

When I first started school, I got a lot of questions about my now disfigured hand. My classmates were fascinated to hear about my condition, acting like I was some sort of superhero.

*“That’s Jake, he can’t feel pain! Isn’t that cool?!”*

*“Can I punch you as hard as I possibly can?!”*

*“Would you feel it if I stabbed you with my pencil?”*

It was kind of cool, at first. Having been made to feel like a burden at home with Mum constantly hovering over me (making sure I didn’t unknowingly break a leg or bite my own tongue off), it felt good to be appreciated. Even if it was for being a weirdo.

But when secondary school arrived, being different was the worst thing you could possibly be. The admiration and curiosity was quickly replaced with disgust and repulsion.On the plus side, no bully wanted to beat me up. There was no point. Not only because I wouldn’t be able to feel it, but mostly because my attacker would be left feeling dissatisfied from their inability to assert dominance. The downside was that it meant they got more creative with their insults.

My nickname became ‘Marigold’, due to the rubbery texture of my scarred hand. I tried desperately to blend into the background, not wanting to draw any unnecessary attention to myself. Every now and again, though, my condition would give me away.

While playing football in P.E., an awkward tackle left me with an elbow to the face.

I got up, brushed myself off, and glanced up at the rest of the class.

They stared back at me in horror.

“What?” I tried to say, but my mouth felt full.

I spat, spraying the astroturf with a mix of blood and saliva, followed by a couple of teeth.

Raising a hand to my face, I heard a crunch as I pressed my nose.

After being rushed to hospital and given a series of tests to ensure I hadn’t received any more serious damage such as head trauma, I was allowed to go home having gained a misshapen nose, but having lost my two front teeth.

When I returned to school several days later, I was no longer “Marigold”.

*“Look, it’s Gummy!”*

*“Nice teeth, Gummy!”*

*“Rubber hand, missing teeth,* ***and*** *a dodgy nose?! Sucks to be you, Gummy Bear!”*

While I was immune to physical pain, the same did not apply for emotional torment, no matter how hard I pretended otherwise.

When I finally left school, I picked up a job in a dry cleaners. It didn’t pay much, but I scrimped and saved and after about a year, I finally came up with enough money to get my teeth fixed. I practically skipped my way to the dentist’s office.

“Someone’s eager today!” said the nurse, as she led me to the procedure room.

“Yeah,” I smiled. “I can’t wait.”

“We don’t hear that much!” she laughed. “People don’t usually enjoy visiting us. Ah, here we are. Take a seat. Dr Crawford will be doing your procedure today, and I will be assisting. He’ll be through any minute.”

“Hello!” Boomed Dr Crawford as he entered the room. “So we’re doing dental implants for you today, are we?”

“Yeah, that’s right.” I said.

“Okay, let me get set up and then I’ll administer the general anaesthetic and we can get cracking.”

“Oh, that’s okay, I don’t need it.”

“You.. don’t want anaesthesia?”

"No, that’s okay thanks. I can’t feel pain.”

Dr Crawford and the nurse shot each other a look.

“It’s called CIPA.” I said. “I literally cannot feel pain.”

“There wasn’t any mention of that in your notes.” He said. “Are you absolutely sure you don’t want the pain relief?”

“Yep.” I said, tapping my knees with excitement. “Let’s do this.”

He let out a laugh.

“You’re the boss!“ he said with a shrug.

A little while later, I emerged with a brand new smile and a huge weight lifted off my shoulders. I felt like a different person. Just my nose and hand left to fix, and I might even pass an an average person.

I happily handed my card over to the receptionist, barely fussed about the huge sum of money that was about to be drained from my account.

“Mr Donovan, can I speak to you for a moment?”

I turned around to see Dr Crawford.

“Is something wrong?” I asked.

“Not at all!” he smiled. “I’d just like to run something by you.”

“Oh, um.. sure.”

I followed him to his office.

“Please, take a seat.” he said, pulling out a chair for me. He sat himself behind a large desk.

“Mr Donovan, I wanted to talk to you about your condition.”

“Um… okay. It’s Jake, by the way.”

“Of course. Well, Jake. As it happens, a dear friend of mine specialises in genetic mutations, such as CIPA.”

“Oh!” I said, surprised. “That’s so weird. Normally people have never heard of it before.”

“Yes, it is a very rare condition.” said Dr Crawford. “Now, this friend of mine is currently working in research. Simply put, he looks into all sorts of different conditions and tries to understand them a bit better. I’m sure he would be absolutely fascinated by your condition, Jake.”

There was a short pause.

“Have you ever consider volunteering yourself for medical research?”

Seeing the petrified look on my face, he chuckled.

“It isn’t as scary as it sounds, I promise. It would most likely be a series of small tests, and some scans to monitor your brain activity. Things like that.”

"I dunno, I-“

“You would be compensated for your time.”

That was all I needed to hear. Dr Crawford shook my hand as I left, promising me that his friend would be in touch.

Several weeks later I got a call.

“Hello, is this Mr Donovan?”

“Yes. Jake is fine.”

“Hi, Jake, I’m Dr Collins. Dr Crawford gave me your number. I hear you’re interested in helping out with some research?”

“Yeah.” I said.

“Fantastic! That’s brilliant news. Could you come in tomorrow, around midday? I’m eager to get started as soon as possible.”

I agreed, scribbling down the address.

“Um.. I hate to ask…” I said, awkwardly. “Dr Crawford mentioned I’d be compensated. Is that right?”

“Oh, yes, of course.” replied Dr Collins. “There aren’t many people with your condition, so it’s a very rare chance for us to discover more about the science behind it. You’ll be paid for your time quite handsomely.”

When I went to see Dr Collins in his lab the next day, I felt a little nervous. Obviously I didn’t have to worry about the tests hurting, but that still didn’t ease my anxiety.

Dr Collins greeted me with a huge smile.“Hi, Jake! It’s great to meet you. How are you feeling today?”

“I’m okay.” I said. “A bit nervous.”

“You’re in good hands,” he responded. “You’ll be working with me and a few of my colleagues today- we don’t bite, I promise. We’ll get started with a few blood tests followed by an MRI. Sound okay?”

I followed him through to the testing room where I was greeted by two middle aged men and a slightly older woman. After getting briefly acquainted, I was given a seat and the testing began.

I answered some basic questions about myself and my life with CIPA. I explained about my teeth, hand, and nose, and how pain was a foreign concept to me. I went for an MRI, and watched as the doctors excitedly discussed my results.

At the end of the day, Dr Collins wrote me a cheque for £250. I was ecstatic.

“Are you free to come in tomorrow?” He asked.

I was meant to be working, but felt more than happy to call in sick if it meant receiving over double my daily rate just for being prodded with a few needles I couldn’t feel.

“Of course.” I replied.

The next few days were more of the same: bloods, scans, and questions. It was the easiest money I’d ever made in my life.

On the fifth day of testing, though, Dr Collins wanted to try something different.

“Now, you’re welcome to decline.” he said. “But my team and I have been working on a new form of medicine. It’s got nothing to do with CIPA. In fact, it’s for an entirely unrelated project. However, given your test results, we feel like you’d be a fitting candidate to try it out on. We’d monitor you, of course- make sure there are no unusual side effects.”

“I don’t understand.” I said. “I thought I was just here to help you learn more about *my* condition.”

“Yes, and that’s what we’ve been doing. You’ve been a fantastic help. Like I said, you’re more than welcome to say no, but this could give us the breakthrough we’ve been after.”

He paused, taking note of the hesitant look on my face.

“I’ll give you £2,000 for it.”

So I agreed.

I was monitored carefully over the next few days, but had zero side effects. Dr Collins was ecstatic.

“Incredible, Jake!” he exclaimed. “Amazing!”

And that’s how I became the lab Guinea pig. With an offer of money I just couldn’t refuse, I willingly handed my body over to science.

Not all of the medicines were as straight forward as the first one. Some made me vomit, some gave me spots, some even left me close to shitting myself.. but I didn’t care. I’d have done anything if it meant I could finally pass as normal.

Then came the last one.

“Now, I’ll be straight with you,” Dr Collins said, bluntly. “I'm expecting a bit of nausea with this one, and possibly a slight fever. Given how dangerous that could potentially be for someone with CIPA, I want you to keep track of your body temperature at home using a thermometer. I’d like you to take a reading every two hours, and if it reaches 38°C, call me.”

I went home and put my pyjamas on, ready to hunker down for the night ahead. I set alarms on my phone for every two hours, and made sure to keep a notepad and pen within reach.

*7pm: 36.9°C*

I decided to binge watch Lord Of The Rings to keep myself busy.

*9pm: 37°C*

I felt fine, just tired. I decided to have a little nap before my next reading.

I awoke at 10:37pm with an unusual sensation in my knee. It felt.. weird. Unlike anything I’d ever felt before. I rolled up my pyjama leg to inspect. There was a small bruise.

*That’s weird,* I thought. *I don’t remember banging my knee.*

And then it hit me.

My whole life I’d found unexplained bruises and cuts all over my body. I’d go days without noticing them, and then realise “oh, that must have been from when I tripped the other day” or “that’s probably from when I walked into the table”. Not once had I ever thought to look for a bruise because I could *feel* it.

I sat there, stunned.

Was I… *feeling pain*?

More and more bruises covered my body, and I let out a gasp as I felt each and every one.

*What the fuck was happening to me?*

I heard a loud crunch, and watched in horror as the top of my index finger snapped to the left. I yelled out, grasping it with my other hand in an attempt to squeeze the horrible sensation away, only making it worse.

I needed to call Dr Collins immediately.

I reached for my phone with my non injured hand, but stopped as I felt a tingle, followed by another loud crunch. My wrist broke, and I howled.

It *hurt*. It really fucking *hurt*.

I made another attempt to reach for the phone, but fell to the floor as my vision blurred and my brain pulsated.

*Thump. Thump. Thump*.

My first headache. I swore through gritted teeth, tears steaming down my cheeks.

I really needed to reach my fucking phone.

Before I could even move, my scar began to fizz. I could feel the bubbles on my hand like I’d felt all those years ago, only this time it was different. This time, it felt hot. Really fucking hot.

I screamed as the flakes of my scarred skin peeled away from my hand, floating into the air.

It was then that I realised what was happening. Every injury I’d ever incurred- every bruise, break, sprain, or burn- every single moment of pain I’d never sensed, I could now feel.

I vomited, stomach acid burning the back of my throat.

I felt all the punches my primary school classmates had thrown at me, their squeals of delight echoing in my mind. Then the stab of freshly sharpened pencils. I found respite in these injuries, thankful they felt nowhere near as bad as my burning hand.

I sobbed when I realised what was coming next. I started to hyperventilate, unsure if my body would be able to survive any more pain.

Then it happened. An invisible elbow smashed into my face. I felt my teeth rip from my gums and the cartilage in my nose bend out of place. Pressure gathered below my eyes as my face began to swell.

Every inch of my body hurt. I writhed in agony, wishing I would die.

It went on for hours. I was completely incapacitated, unable to call for help. Having strained my vocal cords from screaming, it had reached the point where it even hurt to cry.

So I lay there, silently, waiting for my body to succumb to the torture.

I couldn’t tell you what hurt worse- having my teeth ripped out or having the dental implants put in. The damaged nerves of my teeth throbbed, causing bile to rise in my throat.

Then came every side effect of all the different medicines Dr Collins had administered.I winced as I dry heaved, my now empty stomach in knots. My body began to overheat- or at least, that’s what I assumed was happening. All of these sensations were new to me, which made it all the more horrifying.

My body shivered relentlessly as my skin turned pale. I sneezed repeatedly, tears streaming down my cheeks. My skin felt moist- hot and cold at the same time.

The warm sun glaring through a gap in my curtains let me know morning had arrived. I’d been this way the whole night. I closed my eyes, drifting in and out of consciousness. My body toyed with the idea of finally giving up. At some point, I passed out.

I awoke a couple of days later, mouth dry and eyes crusted over. I lay still, waiting to feel something.

Nothing.

After several minutes, I carefully picked myself up off the floor and headed to the bathroom, turning on the tap. I put a finger under the water to assess its temperature.

Again, nothing.

I splashed my face and took a large drink from the running water, my mouth softening. I looked in the mirror.

No cuts or bruises. No indication that anything was wrong.

I forced a smile, baring my teeth. My implants were still intact.

Grabbing my razor from the edge of the sink, I gently swiped it horizontally over the back of my hand. A thin little line appeared, and several drops of blood oozed out.

I felt nothing.

The next several days I flinched with every move I made, expecting the pain to suddenly reappear. But it didn’t.

Things had seemingly gone back to normal. And when I say normal, I mean my version of it: my sweat-free, pain-free life with a rubber hand, busted nose, and dodgy teeth.

Is there even such a thing as being normal? I’d endured hell to discover that, no. Not really. Sure, my body works differently. And sure, I’m a little odd looking. But, as it turns out, I’m fine just the way I am.

So there you have it, folks. My story. All wrapped up with a nice little moral at the end for you.

And yet, as I sit here, typing away.. I try desperately to pretend I don’t feel the tingling sensation creeping into my scarred hand.
