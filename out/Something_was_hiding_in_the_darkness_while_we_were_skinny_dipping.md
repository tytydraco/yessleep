That night, I was hanging out with three friends we'll call Sarah, Nick and Mary.  We were celebrating Nick's birthday at his place, which happened to have a hot tub in the backyard.  After a couple hours and a couple too many beers, we jokingly suggested skinny dipping in the hot tub as some kind of birthday present.  It would've probably stopped there if it wasn't for our drunkenness, so we did eventually say, fuck it, let's do it! 

Now for context, Nick's house was by a forest and was very isolated from neighbours.  Adding to that, it was maybe past midnight and anything past the christmas lights of dubious quality that were spread around the yard was basically pitch black.  Being fucking pussies, going out there without Nick's parents home would have been unimaginable if it hadn't been for the wonders of inebriation.  So semi reluctantly, I followed my friends into the night with a towel on my shoulder.  We reached the hot tub that was worryingly close to the edge of the woods and we started stripping.  Everything was fine for the next thirty minutes or so, apart from the occasional branch cracking.  We were having fun, telling stories or rambling about stupid shit and the fear quickly faded away.  That was until a deafening shriek came from the darkness of the forest, lasting for about five seconds.  It sounded like a human voice, but it sounded nothing like a *person*.  We all turned livid, became silent for what seemed like hours, and I even saw Nick lose his boner in a matter of seconds.  We didn't dare try to look into the forest, except Mary who just grew a pair of balls out of nowhere and picked up her phone to use the flashlight.  We couldn't help but follow the light as she pointed it at the forest, who seemed unaffected by it as if the darkness was swallowing it.  Nothing.. 

As we were about to stop looking though, the void stared back at us.  Mary shined her light far behind Sarah, and it reflected on a pair of eyes and a white mass in the distance.  That was the straw that broke the camel's back.  We rushed out of the tub without even giving a single thought about gathering our clothes.  Mary and I screamed, apparently her balls had been blown to smithereens, and we all ran towards the back entrance as fast as possible.  Nick immediately got a knife while we locked every door and window.  We wanted to call Nick's parents, or the police or anyone, but our phones were over by the forest where we'd left them.   Seeing no other choice, Nick put shoes on and made a run for it.  He'd managed to get his phone, but he'd heard loud breathing coming from the forest meaning whatever it was hadn't left. 

What followed were the shittiest two hours of my life.  Nick got his parents to make their way home, handed us towels so we could finally cover ourselves and we gathered in the basement where there were no windows.  We spent most of the time in silence, waiting for something to happen.  Half an hour in, we heard another shriek, more distant.  Only this time, it was shortly followed by knocks on the door that couldn't possibly be Nick's parents.  Sarah actually started crying, but thankfully it stopped after that.  The parents arrived and allowed us to sleep in the basement for safety.  They hadn't heard or seen anything, and were pretty sure we just imagined stuff.  We hardly slept, and once the morning came we went out to get our stuff.  The phones, keys, wallets were all there.  The only things missing were Nick's shirt and  Sarah and Mary's panties (I wasn't wearing any that night).  So that left us with two possible scenarios: A weird pale ass pervert spied on us in a isolated area deep in the woods, or whatever other creepy shit roams in there just decided to spook us.
