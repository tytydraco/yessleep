Now for the people who have already read... I just had my second strange encounter with whatever this thing is last night.

first off, I notice a lot of people "introduce" themselves at the beginning of their posts. I haven't really introduced myself properly because I didn't want to risk any people like co-workers, or family stumbling upon this. And possibly pick up the idea that I'm not mentally well. But at this point, I don't really care how it may make me look. I just need to vent. My name is Jason and I am 25, that much I will say. I'm not sure if what I saw really was something that took the form of my grandpa, or my mind playing tricks on me while the grieving process was still in full force. For weeks since that first incident in the woods, I watched every local news channel I could almost every night. Spent countless nights looking up stories of a random man bleeding out in the parking lot of a random park. But nothing. Not a single source to validate my experience as real. But I know what I saw, and I know it was real.

Although now I don't know what I saw, or rather, what I am seeing. Because it came back. Last week, I came home late after a nearly 9-hour shift where I am a gas station assistant manager. Consisting mostly of mopping, stocking, and helping customers when we get them. The normal work you'd expect from someone you'd see working that job. I carefully maneuvered my car right in front of my shitty, never renovated, and damp one floor house, and walked inside. Hoping whatever was leftover in my fridge that day hadn't gone bad yet. Thankfully, I had just enough to make a turkey sandwich. I hopped in the shower after my sandwich, and decided to watch some TV now that my roommate wasn't there to hog it like he usually is at this time. He's in Florida or some shit for Spring Break. Despite him being well out of college and having a full time job. But hey, who am I to stop him from giving me the house to myself. It wasn't until my eyes began blinking at different rates that I decided to go to bed. 

Hours passed like seconds. Every hour waking up, positioning my head to the clock on my night stand. 9, 10, 11, 12. Finally. 1:26am. I didn't wake up to the normal restless kicking or constant dreams like I do most hours of the night. Instead, it was the sound of a chittering Red-headed Woodpecker. The same exact frequency, the same exact tone, coming from directly outside my window. I stayed in bed, anticipating to hear the sound of shattering glass following it. But I never got that. It may have been an actual Red-headed woodpecker, sure. But with that recent scuffle still terrorizing my thoughts, I don't know. 

But what came next may have been the most disturbing part of this whole experience so far. 

The chittering stopped. I continued to lay in my bed, listening to the hum of the AC. Painful seconds flooded by as I awaited the next noise. The drumming. The chittering. Anything. But instead, I began hearing pacing from outside my house, while whatever was out there started to speak my name. 

"Ja-a-a-a-a-ason J-a-a-a-a-ason" as if a bird was attempting to do its best impersonation of a human. Failing miserably. 

I froze, the hairs standing on the back of my neck felt strong enough to lift my head off the pillow. I laid there, motionless, with my eyes glued to the curtain drawn window to my left. There was a figure. It was looking at my window like it knew my presence, but still hadn't found me yet. I heard a faint yet swift swoosh as the shadowy figure brushed past. Then I heard it to my right. So my head jolted right.

"Ja-a-a-a-a-a-ason" the thing croaked, still sounding more bird than human. The thing had this raspy, almost mucous-y sound to it. Like the first cry you'd expect out of a new born baby. Crying and attempting to finally breath air. 

Whatever this thing is, it somehow knows me. it knows my name, it found where I live. It was too dark outside to completely make out whether or not it was the same man that looked like my grandpa. But there was a figure. Running past both of my bedroom windows. As if it were in a desperate panicked attempt to find me. This went on for nearly an hour. But no way was I going to risk my luck again, only to find out that I used up the last of it back on that trail. I don't know if it was the shock I was in, or what, but I finally decided to call 911 after 45 minutes. Something I obviously should have done two months ago.

"911 what is your emergency?" the operator questioned

Before I could get my words out, I heard the muttering of the creature in a more raspy, hushed, and almost hurt voice...

"S-e-e-e-e  yo-u  tomo-r-r-r-r-ow  ni-i-i-i-ght-t-t  Ja-a-a-a-ason" 

The faint sounds of leaves and twigs crunching rapidly followed. I hung up the phone, not knowing how to explain what I'd just witnessed without the operator or police officers thinking I was high. Yet sure enough, the officers still arrived anyways. I explained the bare minimum. Seeing a figure outside my house. Worried of a forced entry. But since there wasn't actually an attempt, there was nothing they could do. Which I understand.

But the way this thing is now going about deteriorating my mental state scares the shit out of me. If it was going all around the house saying my name, it must have been "looking for me". But the moment I call 911 to try and get help it immediately gives me a sign that it knows I'm here. Refusing to do anything. Like it wants to play this sick little game. Since I refused to participate last time. And since I seemed to have refused this time as well, I'm scared shitless of what it's willing to do next.

I have no fucking clue what this thing is. I'm just scared shitless, and someone in the comments of my last post suggested I get a weapon. I've never been much of a pro gun person, hell, I've never even shot one. But at this point, I might do just that.

Anyways, I thought I should share this here just as an update. I'm currently at a hotel for the next few days. So I can at least be around people if anything goes wrong. And I'm going take off work for obvious mental health related reasons. 

I'll update if anything else happens.
