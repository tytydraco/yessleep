I am a bird watcher. Initially, when my grandfather talked me into joining him one day, I was reluctant. If only I never listened to him and stayed home. I must admit that in the years following our first outing into the smaller wooded areas of Nebraska, I absolutely adored it. I know people find it cheesy (I still do as well) when some say "It's like I'm becoming one with nature" but in a way this is really what that felt like. Identifying bird species to the point of almost feeling like you know them on a personal level. It's refreshing in a way. That is until a few months ago.

I began bird watching with my grandfather over 15 years ago, and being able to spend that time with him that I knew was dwindling felt like such a privilege. At least much more than others can say. He died last year, and I haven't been the same since. Not only mentally, the grieving process has never really hit me as hard as this. No losing family members as a child, no pets, and no friends. 

Just my grandpa. Although, in a strange, unexplainable way, I haven't lost him. At least that's how it seems. I guess that's why I (and apparently many others) am here to do. I don't know if I will receive any answers, but I'll ask anyways.

It all started about 2 months ago. I drove down to one of my me and my grandpas favorite locations to watch and listen for those magnificent winged creatures. It was a rather gloomy day. Clouds of fog filled the horizon, it was slightly drizzling, just enough to where I could feel it on my feet but not enough to fully soak my socks. Annoying to some, but to me... It just caused more memories of grandpa to flood back. Nearly ever spot I looked in that park reminds me of him. My mind connects words or sentences he finely crafted in his raspy, grunted voice with bark on specific trees I was looking at while listening to him.

That's when I heard it. My grandpas favorite bird. Even though it's technically against the parks rules (who follows them anyways), I decided to go off trail to see I could catch a glimpse at the red-headed woodpecker myself. I'm not sure why my grandpa was so infatuated with woodpeckers anyways. Not to say that they're boring, but I've always been more of a bigger bird person myself. The fog continued to cloud my vision, This has always been my favorite part. Playing a game of hide and seek with the birds, hearing it in your left ear, you turn left. then hear it on the right, you turn right. Like a different, more humane version of hunting. No need to harm... just to find. 

I heard it on my right, I turned right. Then on my left, I turned left. Then I found it. peered around at the tree with the bird. About 50 yards away, only it wasn't a bird. It was a man. He was completely naked. Heavily malnourished. His face was drenched in blood. Repeatedly smashing his head against the bark. At the same rapid speed as a woodpecker would, and making the exact sound a woodpecker does. I couldn't take my eyes off it. I watched in horror as more pools of blood cemented itself on the base of the tree. Slowly trickling down. Then, in my own normal stupidity, I attempted to help

"Hey!" I bellowed in a cracked voice, knowing that at that exact moment, I shouldn't have said anything "are you ok sir?" 

The man continued to bash, until the sound finally ceased to echo and the sound finally got to him. The man slowly reeled his head around to me. A mix of blood, saliva, and wood, covered the entire circumference of his face. The excessive dripping from his forehead caused the vast majority of his face to be shrouded in a dark haze. As soon as he saw me he let out a perfect woodpecker call. A high pitched chittering sound, one that wouldn't be out of the ordinary for a bird. Yet much less ordinary coming our of a grown man.

He then proceeded to get into a sprinters start position for a track race. It seemed as though he was giving me a head start, and it didn't take long for me to register that.  

I took my opportunity, retraced my steps, and bolted back to the rickety wooden trail. The wind against my face, mixed with my panicked and fatigued breaths we're loud enough to drown the out the world around me. Run. Just. Run. A loose nail jutted out from the damp wood caught the toe cap on my right foot. Causing my entire body to flail forward. The immediate rush of silence brought me back to reality. I began to hear the rapid wet slaps of bare feet against the wood. 

Before I pushed myself back up, I peered back around my shoulder. The sounds of the woodpecker drumming started up again as he began crawling on all fours, continuing to rapidly beat his head into the rotting wood. I continued into the direction of my car. Now making sure to attempt to watch for any obstructions in front of me. 

I jostled the keys from out of my pocket. Trying to keep my pace as I did so. I successfully got to my car. But the man in my side mirror continued to sprint toward me, still keeping his perfect impersonation of a small chittering woodpecker. I got inside, key in ignition, but before I could reverse... tap tap tap tap tap smash. The man had managed to drum the glass of my driver window so hard that it shattered all across my lap, his blood coming with it.

 I floored it, dragging the man with me for a few feet, giving me enough time to fully see the things face. It had the face of my grandpa.

I attempted to mutter his name, before a shard of glass still attached to the car quickly and silently drove into it's neck. The shard detached and he rolled away from the car. the thing just laid there, motionless. 

I cried for what felt like hours. Losing someone you love and hold dearly is hard enough, but to witness it twice. And not only twice, but he second time holding in the guilt of feeling as though its your own fault. I havenâ€™t been bird watching since the incident, and currently have no desire to.

I don't know how much posting this will help, but all things considered. I actually do feel a bit better.
