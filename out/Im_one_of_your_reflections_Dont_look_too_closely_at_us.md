Fine, I messed up, but it was partly the girl’s fault for making a dumb-ass face, wasn’t it? She was practicing a smile, and I was following along, when out of nowhere she flared her nostrils and stuck her tongue out. I copied her, but half a second too late. Her ugly little green eyes went as round as brussels sprouts, and she stuck her face so close to the mirror that I could see every clogged pore on her oversized nose. Yeah, I had to copy that, too.

Then I had to file a Class 3 incident report. It was my second one in a month, so I was put on baby duty. Boring as hell, but at least it’s easy; babies don’t notice when their reflections don’t match. The only thing you have to watch out for is if a parent is looking at the mirror.

Anyway, back to brussels sprouts girl. Let me tell you what happened to her, so you don’t go checking out your reflection and making more work for me. After I was reassigned to Babies (fuck you, Llib), the girl was given a Senior Reflection, an experienced employee who followed along flawlessly as she quirked her eyebrows and puffed her cheeks at her bathroom mirror in repeated attempts to catch out her reflection.

That’s usually where Class 3 incidents end. The reflector gets bored, gives up, and moves on to whatever next catches their mundane fancy. Importantly, they stop looking into the mirror.

Not our girl. As her antics hit the one-hour mark, the incident was upgraded to Class 2, and a Staff Reflection, Teiluj, was brought in. Those of us on break crowded around her workstation, eager to watch a master at work.

Us low-level employees, we have the simple and tedious job of making the world in the mirrors appear supremely uninteresting. Staff Reflections have a broader mandate: make reflectors look away, by any means possible.

Teiluj began with a smile, small at first and gradually widening into a creepy slash from cheek to cheek. Brussels sprouts girl watched, transfixed, as her reflection put a finger to her lips, reached behind her, and slowly, slowly eased open the bathroom door.

I really think Teiluj almost had it. Another second, and the girl would have turned around to see if her door was open. Before that could happen, the backwards things came.

Some of the backwards things are harmless - cute, even. The cat with its tail on its head. The boy with the upside-down face. They came out of idle curiosity, to see who had noticed our world. The ones to watch out for are the ones who are interested in *your* world.

There was the inside-out hand, knocking on the glass with fingers encased in spongy bone. It used the reflection of a straight razor to saw through a section of bone at the tip of its thumb, slicing deep enough to reveal the rotting skin at the core. Then it wrote, in dripping blood letters, ***WE SEE YOU.***

Next came the old woman with inward eyes. Her thin breath fogged up the mirrored surface that she pressed the filmy surface of her tongue to, as the whites of her eyes roved around sightlessly.

Close behind her was her husband, the man with thirty-two lips. From his full set of perfect white teeth, individually crowned with fat maroon lips, came uncountable discordant voices that asked, ***MAY WE COME IN?***

I have to stop there, because Class 1 incidents - which this one now was - are confidential, and I’d probably be sent down to Comas & Brain Damage if I breached confidentiality.

But you get me, right? If your reflection looks wrong - just ignore it. It’s an ass-load of paperwork for us if you don’t.
