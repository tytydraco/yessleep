I’ve rinsed the bitter taste of police station coffee out of my mouth, but it doesn’t help. Morning mist settles over the Ozarks, and I can’t stop thinking about those poor families.


I work at the Ridgemont General Store, past the gas station on Oxford Street where that biker got shot, if you saw the news article. People often miss it, nestled amongst the pine trees. The area is so quiet, you can hear the electronics buzz.


The night lights arrived in an unmarked cardboard box. Collected and signed for by the day shift attendant, I assumed. I didn't think there was anything odd about the delivery; it's the kind of item a tired parent might desperately search a store for when trying to get their kids to sleep. They emit white noise that's meant to be soothing.


I sold them for about two weeks until I got a call. Not many--maybe four or five of the lights.


"Where do you get off selling this shit? Do you even check?" a lady yelled through the line.


"No, I'm just a clerk." I told her. "If it's about a faulty item, don't stress. I'll organise a refund." 


"What I want is my damn kid to go to sleep. He's terrified."


She said it worked fine at first. Her kid giggled when the egg-shaped bulb lit up, and the white noise calmed his crying. Later that night, she passed his room on the way to the bathroom and found him kneeling in front of the light, talking to it. When she asked him what he was doing, he only said,


“Can I sleep with you tonight?”


We received plenty of complaints, and many we had no way of verifying. Kids have imaginary friends. They talk to themselves. I noted the complaint but wasn't particularly bothered.


Once inventory was done, I had nothing to do during my night shifts other than listen to podcasts. I unboxed one of the night lights and connected it to the socket next to the store counter. As advertised in the information slip, the device released a faint, static buzz. I figured that's all the kid heard--voices in static.


About two hours into my shift, the static made a sudden click. The audio shifted to something more akin to waves pulling in and out, or a jogger who's out of breath. I leaned in closer, and heard the voice.


“Meet me outside,” it said. “Those aren't your parents. They're here, with me.” For a moment, I just gaped at the light, feeling dizzy. "I can hear you breathing. You can trust me, I'm a police officer. We listen to every house in this neighborhood. To protect you."


My lips didn't move--I couldn't speak.


Someone had remote access to the light. Someone who thought I was a kid, because only children are afraid of the dark.


I ripped the device from the socket and let it clatter on the linoleum floor. If they were meeting me outside, that meant they were tracking the device. I raised my foot, ready to stomp.


But I stopped.


Maybe he was nearby--maybe he was already here. Maybe he'd done this before. I'd sold half a dozen of those lights--to real families. If this was real, I needed to know.


I reconnected the light, and whispered in a small voice "Okay."


Not long after, headlights crested a hill and a car came prowling down the road. An ordinary sedan, the kind that drives past all the time. It slowed down once it got to the store. The window rolled down; a gap just small enough for their eyes.


Then it took off.


Faster than I could whip out my phone and take a photo of the number plate. Plus, it was too dark.


I knew why immediately; they'd been expecting a house, not a store.


I spoke with Mike from the day shift. He had no idea what I was talking about. He never collected a delivery.


The police are aware and are investigating the missing children.


To whoever I sold the night lights to, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
