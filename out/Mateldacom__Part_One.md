As a sysadmin, life can get monotonous, especially when you’re good at your job. It’s one of those careers that’s perfect for tech geeks like me—clients rarely know what they actually need, and they assume that tasks will take days or even weeks. In reality, we complete them in minutes, thanks to pre-written scripts we’ve already perfected. That leaves us with a lot of free time, and passing it can be a challenge.

A friend told me about this Discord server for sysadmins—people like me from all over the world. We’d join, share stories, and talk about the random challenges we face. Sometimes, we’d vent about difficult clients. It was a fun way to kill time while waiting for our scripts to finish running on a second screen.

Weeks passed, and then, one day, I received a private message. The sender was anonymous, but the message stood out: just a photo, something that looked like fire, along with a cryptic line: "Are you smart enough? 188.72.\*9\*.\*\*." It was a server IP address, but I won’t share the full IP here, for obvious reasons.

At first, I didn’t get it. Why would someone send this? I did what any sysadmin would do—started probing the IP. I pinged it, checked for open ports, spent hours poking around. Eventually, I found that the server was running on port 666. That made me stop.

For anyone in the tech world, you’d know that the default port for SSH connections is 22. Port 666? Someone had changed that intentionally. A joke, maybe? I tried to connect and eventually uncovered the login details: username “root” and password “password.” Whoever set this up definitely had a strange sense of humor.

Excited, I told my friend from the Discord about the whole thing—how I cracked it, how weird the setup was. He listened for a while and then interrupted: “You think you’re the only smart one here? We all got that message a few weeks after joining. Everyone figured out the port 666 thing and the ‘root’ user. It’s just some old prank server. After you log in, there’s nothing there but broken files and meaningless logs.”

I felt like an idiot. But that night, curiosity got the better of me. I connected to the server anyway, sifting through the strange log files. Most of them were gibberish, just random characters and broken text. But one word caught my eye: Matelda.

That name stirred something deep in my memory. I’m Egyptian, and a name like Matelda—you just don’t hear it around here. Yet, I knew it. Slowly, the fog lifted. It was 2004, and I was 14 years old, spending time at an internet café in Alexandria. That’s when I first stumbled upon a website called matelda.com—or at least, I think that’s what it was called. Back then, we referred to every website as .com.

The site was… weird. Mesmerizing, even. The moment it loaded, the screen turned pitch black, but it wasn’t empty. Pixelated skeletons danced across the screen, joined by demons and ghosts. Every day, the images changed. Sometimes new skeletons appeared, or the ghosts shifted positions. It became our daily routine—logging in, downloading the latest GIFs, and sharing them on forums. It was our way of being cool, back when the internet was still new and mysterious.

One day, a new feature appeared on matelda.com—a chatroom. I spent hours there, chatting with strangers. I can’t remember if I typed in Arabic or English, who I talked to, or what we talked about, but I remember those hours vividly. The chat was addictive, and it became a local legend among the kids in Alexandria. There were rumors about sex images appearing on the site, like nude photos, which seemed so bizarre for a site like that. But for usas a kids, it was incredible.

Then came the real rumor. One of the kids said, “Have you seen the version of the site that shows up at midnight?”

At first, I didn’t believe them. They explained that [matelda.com](http://matelda.com/) had a secret version—a version that only appeared when the clock struck twelve. The usual black background would change. The skeletons would stop dancing. The demons would stop grinning. Instead, the site would turn darker, more sinister. It sounded ridiculous, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I needed to see it for myself.

One night, I stayed late at the internet café. The clock on the monitor ticked closer to midnight. My friends had all gone home, leaving me alone in the dimly lit room, surrounded by the hum of computers. At exactly midnight, I refreshed the page.

The site reloaded, but it wasn’t the same.

The black background remained, but this time, droplets of blood began to drip from the top of the screen. Slowly, they trailed downwards, leaving red streaks behind. The skeletons, demons, and ghosts were gone. In their place were shadowy figures, standing still, watching. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was watching me through the screen, too.

The chatroom was eerily silent, but then, through the headphones, I heard a voice.

“Hello”

I didn’t wait to hear more. I slammed the computer shut and ran all the way home, my heart racing.
