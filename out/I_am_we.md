Yesterday, I woke up at 7am. My girlfriend, Katie, was still asleep. I gave her a gentle kiss and got ready for work. She's been looking for a job since we moved in together, but unfortunately, no luck yet. I've always been excited for the day we can get up and get ready together.

Yesterday, I woke up at 6am and couldn't get back to sleep. My boyfriend, Jordan, didn't wake up for another hour. I pretended to be asleep because I like feeling him gently kiss my forehead. He doesn't know that I have a job interview today, because I'm very nervous and don't want to talk about it.

Yesterday, these were both separate facts about separate people. Today, I woke up with nobody next to me in bed - I woke up as two people, combined into one.

The last thing I remember is getting into bed. Both sides. I wanted to make love to my boyfriend, but I told my girlfriend I was too tired. We cuddled instead and fell asleep like that. It was nice; We usually get too hot, but yesterday, we fell asleep faster than ever.

Today, I realised my partner was not next to me. I realised this twice at once. I was not originally one of these people  - I was originally both. I know myself as Katie equal parts to knowing myself as Jordan. Neither memory is stronger than the other. In the mirror, I look strangely familiar. I have features from both of my lives. I look similar to myself and nothing like myself at the same time.

It feels like I have lost my partner twice. I miss Jordan, and I miss Katie. I knew both of them externally; It feels like I have lost them both. The pain I am going through isn't something I can describe, as the people I've lost are myself. Experiencing someone's existence externally isn't the same as experiencing existence internally. I always thought I wanted to know everything about my partner, and I've gotten the most extreme version of that. These memories are no longer things told to me by my loved one, but things I have personally experienced and perceived. They are very different feelings with very different meanings.

I will never again get to find out something new about my partner. I will never get to listen to a story about their life and not know the ending. I can't even ask my partner what to do or console them. I have no partner anymore. I am grieving the loss of 2 people that are still alive, and quite literally closer to me than anyone could ever experience.

I haven't contacted anyone yet. I have 2 families now, and I don't know which to reach out to first. I want to go back to just being one person, but I don't want to lose either part of me. I am Jordan, and I am Katie. To stop being one would feel like ending my life.
