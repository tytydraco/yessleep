We watched, amazed, incredulous, as their ships descended from the shadow-tinged clouds—the vessels ovoid and gleaming, like brilliant celestial tears. There were about forty of us in the immediate area, standing on the sidewalks or huddled up in the streets, defenseless save for what we happened to have on our persons.  

The ships—massive, sprawling dirigibles—began circling the area as they continued downward, gradually enclosing us in an ever-dwindling perimeter. Some of the children screamed hysterically, and their parents quickly silenced them, fearing that their little ones would draw further attention.   

Some ships landed atop houses, crushing the rooves not with their hulls, but with some sort of outwardly thrown gravitation; while others simply held their elevations in mid-air, occasionally dispelling short bursts of what appeared to be steam or cosmic gas into the atmosphere.  

From beneath the lowest and largest ship came a conical beam of hard-light, slicing through the asphalt of the street below; incinerating several trees and melting a few unoccupied cars parked along the curb. The beam focused, narrowed, and after a moment of blinding luminescence, dissipated in an instant—leaving in its smoldering wake a congregation of extraterrestrial beings.  

They wore nothing save for strange begemmed collars around their slender, elongated necks, and tall, tripodal crowns atop their oblong heads; though in the umbral night I couldn’t tell if these ivory-white protrusions were some kind of personal ornamentation, or scalp-piercing projections of their skulls.  

Where it could be seen, their skin was stark grey and wrinkly, like the mottled flesh of some crypt-preserved cadaver; and their arms—which hung to their buckler-like knees—were virtually without muscle, appearing almost vestigial. And though their torsos were no larger than a human’s--perhaps a little wider—their legs were multi-segmented and inversely jointed, like those of some tree-scaling insect. Overall, they were somehow both mundane and loathsome in appearance and stature, vaguely familiar yet still inspiring repulsion and fright.  

“Cool costumes!” shouted someone from among the human assemblage.  

“Are those balloons up there? They must’ve cost a fortune.” muttered another.  

The grey-skinned visitors surveyed the crowd, their triangularly-situated and lidless sets of black eyes scanning the humans gathered around them. There was a soft trilling sound which seemed to issue from the very air around their bony antennae, and then a voice—deep, grave, and profoundly terrifying—spoke above the murmurs of the crowd: 

“We see that you are in states of infirmity—some of you even seem to be on the very threshold of death, if not beyond it. We’ve deemed it a perfect time to conquer your planet, and we shall start with you, oh low and enfeebled dwellers of this lonely rock. We shall show you no mercy—for we do not care to. Submit and die.”  

Around them, the ghouls, liches, zombies, and vampires, the crypt-spawn and vault-born, the melting and bloodied, all looked at one another in shared confusion; and then, gradually, a revelation dawned on us with great simultaneity: *The ultramundane visitors had mistaken our Halloween costumes for our actual states of life.*  

They saw torn, battered, and shredded flesh, and believed the still-bleeding wounds to be real. They saw skin, leprous and pox-blighted, and figured us for the incurably diseased. They perceived only our superficial appearances—many of which resembled the dead and dying with superb accuracy—and hadn’t the knowledge of the dark holiday to understand that it was all fake.  

Silently, communally, we came to a decision on what to do with the invaders, who’d dare to interrupt our night of jubilant horror and unhallowed merrymaking. Setting aside our bundles of candy, we slowly advanced on the aliens, who in their boldness or stupidity failed to see the hostile change that had come over us. Proudly they stood there as we marched toward them, plastic weapons raised, fangs bared, capes fluttering in the soft wind-currents.  

When the first of our ranks had reached them, only then did the aliens glean that something was wrong; that the people they had come to terrorize and genocide were not going to accept their prescribed fates.  

An acute, deliciously potent horror spread across the face of the foremost delegate as a maggot-bitten corpse gripped its pitiably slender throat. I heard a thin, pig-like squeal as the cadaverous hands tightened around the scrawny neck; and then the other unearthly trespassers too were assailed by sepulchral compatriots of the walking corpse.  

In a frenzy, we humans clad in the visages of the dead and demoniac fought back against those who would murder us.  

A small coven of witches bearing ladles of dragon bone ruthlessly bludgeoned one alien, cackling all the while. Crimson-skinned fiends danced devilishly atop the back of another alien who’d been thrown to the ground; warlocks, sons of the Salem-burnt, uttered unrepeatable blasphemies and Atlantean maledictions; ghouls of Gehenna, their skin blackened by the ever-burning Tartarean pits, bit and clawed at another pair of invaders.  

A pack of werewolves busied themselves with relieving an alien of his obsidian eyes, which they had deemed things spectrally offensive to their lunar idol. Their Lycan fury rang out into the night, as did the shrieks, howls, and satyr-like cachinnations of certain unspeakable incubi. And though not heard, the sub-aural droning of ancient and eldritch beasts could be felt, sensed with a primal intuition...... 

And I, spurred on by the wholesale violence and unhinged diablerie, seized an alien, hoisted him laterally above my head, and brought his wide back crashing down onto my knee—delivering a back-breaker that would’ve felled a bear. Leaving him writhing on the candy-littered street in agony, I leapt at another interplanetary pillager, my eyes alight with infernal excitement, my clawed hands outstretched for slashing.... 

And after the bodies of those arrogantly audacious aliens were left battered and broken—yet, mercifully, still alive—we turned our sights to those sky-suspended vehicles, daring them to send more. Those of us who wore the hides of winged beasts flapped our leathern wings and squawked mockingly; and an age-rotted pterodactyl hopped in place a few times, threatening to take flight and challenge the ships in aerial melee.  

Dumbly believing that we could actually meet them amidst the clouds, the ships, with that same photic power, recalled their defeated envoys and departed as swiftly as they had come. With the threat thoroughly thwarted, we resumed our night of faux devilry and occult mischief. 

**To drink, vampirically, and commune with the dead—in the blackness of night, with a fullness of dread. It is Halloween, and there is evil to be spread.**
