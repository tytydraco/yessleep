This story is mostly to get everything off my chest I guess.

I live out in the Montana countryside and the farm, really more of a complex, my family and I live on with some other families, all of them dear friends of ours.

Each of us have a house, with all the usual rural amenities. Outhouses, ones that suck to get to in the winter, stables just outside for the horses. My family has a few dogs to help with the herding too. All in all it’s 4 families including mine, and 14 people in total, Greg and Melinda were still trying for kids. It’s about 550 acres of bare nothing for the most part. A loose little collection of trees and shrubs that maybe could qualify as a forest of some sort, and a whole lotta open grassland for the cattle we all raised as a group.

Me and my wife Belle have two kids, they’re little bundles of joy and love everything about where we live. Never had a complaint up until recently. The other families were Greg and Melinda, Jeff and Sonya, Rachael and Brian. That’s who made up the adults of the complex, and for the most part the main players in the story here.

Where the story starts is when Brian’s kid went missing. The kids had all been playing about 400 yards from the home and were with my dog Coop, who very likely and usually does watch all of them. He’s a herding dog so he keeps em in line by the creek out that way. For whatever reason though Phillip got away. The kids all came back and said Phillip left before them to come home but evidently never made it. The next couple days the fathers all rode out along the property and tried to find him. We had a pretty good lay of the land obviously, but those Montana hills got pretty tricky to navigate for us older folk. Under brush and little foxholes all over the place he could be in. We searched day and night, camped out most nights too riding out with lanterns and shouting for him.

On the fifth day of this we found him. He was real weary and stumbling in the right direction toward the home but we were…far from where the kids were. Took us almost 2 hours to get back to the complex so we were more than 20 miles out. The kid looked real thin, had these sunken eyes and hollow cheekbones which took me a bit off guard. But he was 7 so, maybe he lost weight pretty darn quick not eating and somehow getting 20 miles out.

When we got back he was mumbling something in his dad’s ear. Brian kept nodding and I could tell he was concerned by his eyes but I don’t know what the kid said.

Few more days passed. Kid was mostly normal, just asking a lot of questions. And some weird ones too, like he asked my son John if “we could eat this?” A whole lot. Pointing at random plants and the sort. Me and the guys all went out for a beer by that creek.

We laughed and talked about Phillip. Apparently besides the random and increasingly frustrating amount of questions Brian wasn’t concerned about his health. We laughed and talked for a few more hours until  the sun crept behind the mountains, and we knew the wives were gonna be waiting for us so we got up to ride back in. That’s when we heard it the first time. A clicking noise like when you use your tongue on the top of your mouth. I pulled my gun out since it was from on the other side of the creek. The Dusk light if you don’t know is the hardest time for humans to see and boy did I figure that out. I saw nothing but shaky grass, everyone said I was jumpy and grilled me the whole way back telling themselves never to try and spook me. Horses didn’t jump either so I figured it was just me; those things, especially my Meredith would sense a rattlesnake from a football field away.

When we got back the sun was gone, and the chill had set in. I went inside and had dinner with my family, all was well.

Over the next 3 weeks we lost 2 more of our kids. One from each family. All by the creek. Each time they’d show up, my John and Jeff’s Tyler both think and stumbling right where we found Phillip a month ago now. We had a meeting with all of us telling everyone not to go by the creek no more. I had a lot of questions. I’m not sure why Coop let them all get away, especially John since that dog didn’t leave his side ever but…coop didn’t hang out much around him after he got back. Both Phillip and Tyler were 9, and oh boy did they ask questions like never before after they got back too. Phillip, Tyler and John got real close too. Maybe a shared trauma I thought.

Me and the husbands agreed to ride out there again…but farther. I wanted to see what was out there where all three of our kids kept coming back from. Greg offered a bit of pushback, he didn’t want to ride out that way especially with something being dangerous, and he was quite the superstitious type. It didn’t go his way though and we rode out the next day. Phillip John and Tyler were very much against us. Telling us that nothing was out there, they just followed the wrong trail.

We rode hard out there, trying to go fast and make it back soon. About 28 miles, near the edge of our land, we found it dilapidated and sad looking. A little shack.

I got off first and walked up to it, rifle in hand. The boys followed close behind, calling out to me to slow down. I didn’t really listen, I creaked open the door holding on by one hinge at the top and it fell over when I did. I stepped in, only to see a tunnel going down. A tunnel. Like an abandoned mining operation. I turned on my oil lantern and stepped down into it. I heard that clicking too…loud from down there. I called back to tell the other guys to all ride back and get some kind of help, I knew this was bad. They listened to me, “be safe” Brian told me. I walked down and it got damp quick. Felt like there was water just on the other side of the dirt walls, I followed the clicking but it was moving back and forth. Pacing.

I got to this opening deep in there and something dripped onto my forehead. I looked up and saw a sac, that’s the best word for it. It looked like a cyst. Just inside was a man, I don’t know who it was but he was stuck in there like an embryo, it’s slime falling onto me and I kept moving. The clicking stopped when I saw a few more…with the kids in them. I stood in shock and backed away slowly. The clicking came back right behind me though and I didn’t turn…it asked very calmly but not with a human voice. I could just understand it barely, I guess it felt like it was just speaking in my head.

“Can I….eat….you?” I stood motionless and didn’t do anything.

“Can…I eat you?” Again I didn’t do anything.

“Can you…help me?” I closed my eyes and pushed past it the way I came. It felt like a sponge as my arm sank into its shoulder, I guess. I ran fast, and when I knew it was behind me I opened my eyes and booked it, there were so many of those sacs, maybe 30? I heard it rolling or something toward me and clicking loud, and aggressively.

Then it spoke in my son’s voice. “Wait! Dad!” I gasped and kept going. I knew it wasn’t him…

I got on my horse and rode fast when I got out. It stopped after about 20 minutes of riding and I heard it rolling back to its hole…

Worst part is when I got home nobody was there. The dogs were playing outside, everyone’s horses were grazing with the cows. But the people were all gone. I write this from my room now, questions were scribbled all over the walls in paint and…probably blood. I’m not sure what to do or what happened, the nearest city is no doubt a good few hours away by car and all of them had their engines torn apart. I can’t get that clicking noise out of my head…it sounds like it’s coming from the walls now, all around me.
