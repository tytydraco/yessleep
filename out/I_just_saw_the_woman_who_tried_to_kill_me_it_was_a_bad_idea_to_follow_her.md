So, In all fairness by "just" I actually mean a couple months ago, but don't let that give you the wrong idea if it was up to her I'd be in more than one piece right now. If she wasn't more concerned about getting rid of evidence than getting rid of me, she could've easily overtaken me, I'll be the first to admit she's in a lot better shape than me, it was mostly weight advatage and the mometary speed boost derived from absolute terror that let me get away the first time.

I had to leave my home-town a while back when I witnessed a murder, committed by a woman I had been recently involved with,  sexually... When she saw that I saw her, she tried to kill me too. I only got away by the skin of my teeth by grabbing the handle of her axe and throwing her down a hill, there was pretty much a 90% chance that scenario would not go in my favor. I'm not sure it specifically did, because a habitual axe murderer getting a little scuffed and dirty, and that much more angry at me, while otherwise unharmed isn't precisely an ideal circumstance from my perspective. 

So, I had to move to another town with nothing but the clothes I changed into. I was glad the coital exchange I'd partaken of with her was at her place rather than mine, because the fact she didn't know where I lived was the only reason she went back to get rid of the body instead of catching up to me at my apartment. Anyway, it was a couple months ago that she showed up in the new town I moved to, i recognized her shiny orange hair right away when I spotted her outside a café drinking an iced mocha, with extra whipped cream wearing a Sweatshirt with Beta Pi (ΒΠ) printed on the back. For the remainder of this posting I'll refer to her as BP, since I don't intend to use her actual name on nosleep. As far as I can tell there isn't any greek honor society called  Beta Pi, so I don't have any idea what the sweatshirt's origin might be.

I couldn't see her face from the angle I was at, so I hoped that meant she couldn't see me either, but I knew it was her. I ducked into an alley and tried to get a look at her reflection in windows across the street. I still couldn't see her face in the reflection, but I was glad to see that the shadows of the alley made me essentially invisible in the reflection, another young woman joined her at her patio table outside the cafe, a woman who appeared to be in her early thirties with long curly brown hair, wearing a turquoise turtleneck and grey slacks. She was holding a paper coffee cup, I have no idea what was in it.

The only time I could hear them was when they were laughing, which was frequently. After a surprisingly short time BP and the woman in turquoise left the café and I decided to follow via the street on the other side of the alley, following the sound of their footsteps, while trying to keep out of sight and muffle my own. I suppose I thought by following them I might save the moman in turquoise from becoming BP's next victim. Retrospectively, it would have been smarter to follow my keen self preservation instincts and gone the other way.

You're probably wondering, why I didn't just call the police on BP at any point. What you've gotta realize about me is the cops are not on my side and never have been. And they'd probably have me put away just for giving her description, she has an unusual face, let's just put it that way, and If I told the cops I'd seen someone who looks like her murder one person and I suspected her of at least one more they'd assume I was making things up, or hallucinating, partly because of how unusual her face is, but also because I'm me. Just like the sheriff in my home-town looked at me like I was crazy when I told him I was sure the old lady who murdered my little brother had been planning too, maybe since before he met her, and there's not even anything unusual about  her, besides being extremely evil. Her version, that he shot himself, was more convenient for their paperwork. But I'm not here to dwell on that, the takeaway is that I can't expect any cops anywhere to be on my side so I don't call them, and I don't wait for them to call me.

Eventually BP and her date arrived at a small cottage on the edge of town, once they were inside I decided to take a closer look, I shudder to think what anyone would suppose if they'd noticed that I, a middlaged man in a black trench coat and fedora, was following two good looking women a little younger than me, and creeping up to get a look in the window. I must've looked like the very picture of the neighborhood prowler sign. I had to remind myself, "I'm the good guy here." Which I hoped I wasn't saying out loud again... 

I couldn't get a good look in any of the windows of the cottage without making myself visible from inside, especially  in the middle of the day. Fortunately for me the lots on either side of the cottage were occupied by an abandoned tanning shed and a condominium construction that was not currently under active construction. I slunk into the tanning shed where a crack in the wall aforded me a partial view of one of the cottage's windows, the kitcken, at first the room was unoccupied but BP an the other woman entered shortly, I could see BP's face at this point and it was definitely her, I've never seen anyone else with a face like that.

They were both naked, carressing each other at that point. I felt that much more like a creep for watching like that, but I legitimately justified it to myself as an attempt to stop BP from killing the other woman, but I don't know how I figured I was gonna do that from the crumbling shed, over a dozen yards away. There was an oblong rosy pink object in BP's hand, she rubbed it against the other woman's body sensually.  Then it seemed like they were having a conversation, looking  each other in the face, they both nodded. BP began to bind the other woman to the counter with cordage. I decided that was the time to act. Act and do what? I wonder, give BP two kills in one afternoon? Well after little deliberation I picked up a brick off the floor of the shed and headed straigt across through the barbed wire like a goat.

As I got close to the window BP was using what I recognized as a tantric crystal wand to pleasure the bound brunette, her back was to the window, so I thought she didn't see me, but with an unsettling suddeness she raised hrerself onto the counter and swung over the other woman to straddle her, she raised the wand and before I could react brought it down vertically in the middle of her date's forehead. Much too late I tossed the brick through the window it hit BP in the head just as though it were magnetized, but it didn't knock her down or anything, she shook her head quickly from the jarring impact  then  delivered  two more blows to her victim with the wand, which were plenty to still the life in her. I picked up a rock of close to baseball size from the ground and tossed it, the ark was good, but BP ducked that time.

She got up from the counter and grabbed a fifteen inch butcher knife from a magnetic rack. "That hurt, y'know?!" She complained.

"That was the idea!" I said so sternly you'd think I was about to wet my pants. "You just killed someone, what the fuck?!"

"Oh come on," She said blandly, "You were expecting that." BP started to climb up on the sink next to the window glass cracked under her tight fitting slippers, which were the only article  of clothing she wore at that point.

"You're coming out that way?" I said, preturbed. I started backing away.

"Worried I'll cut myself?" She asked knocking glass out with the back edge of the knife. "Your concern is touching."

"Not so much worried about you." I confessed. "It just is really inconvenient for me that you're taking  a shortcut." Satisfied with the width of the aperture she started to lower herself out the window. "You really are gonna chase me down  the street naked, huh?" I asked, as I started to run across the road, toward the bigger buildings of the town.

"Well, if I wasted time getting dressed you might get away again." She stated matter-of-factly, as she started running after me, holding the knife poised to slash at me.

"That sounds preferable if you ask me." I Retorted as I hopped up onto the sidewalk.

"Too late now." She said confidently. "Hope you kissed your ass goodbye last time you saw it." She was across the road just as quickly as I was, and she was barely running.

Running so hard I could taste iron and copper with each exhale I knew I couldn't keep up the pace for long, and she could probably close the distance at a whim. Suddenly the back door of a restaurant opened and several cooks stepped out to smoke, I kept running, slower and slower, but BP hid behind a short fence, supinely, when the cooks came out. The delay brought by the opportune interference was enough, I managed to get a ride out of town from an acquaintance. By the time the town was in the rearview the small cottage was a blazing inferno.

So I moved to another town again and it's been a couple months, but as I was writing this I spotted BP in my new town, she was entering her tavern across the road from my new apartment, it can't be a coincidence. I didn't see her face, but I feel like there's no mistaking that orange hair. I followed her from the bar, she left alone for a change, I acted casual kept writing and didn't follow so close she could see, but I tracked her to a condo on the west side of town. I kinda feel obligated to do something to keep BP from killing again, but I don't know what I should do.
