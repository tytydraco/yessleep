I decided to get out of the cycle and took John up on his suggestion to go out. With Dahlia locked in her room, we left to go to our usual bar by the edge of town. I thought it’d help. After days of disposing of the same body, maybe hanging out with John would bring some normality back into my life. I abstained from alcohol, and tried to make myself feel cozy in the company of some of John’s acquaintances. Despite my best efforts to sink into the booth and relax, I couldn’t help but to observe the interaction. Compared to what I’d gone through with John, how many different ways I’d seen him in the near past, they were all entirely unaware of it. And most of all, John had no idea. Ever since Dahlia’s kidnapping, he kept his one-night stands to a minimum. I would’ve even considered him prude, though he still took every opportunity to shamelessly flirt with whichever girl he saw first.

I briefly wondered if this John would treat me the same he had done two days ago, or if this was a mistake he wouldn’t repeat. They seemed to be carbon copies of each other, but I could never be sure. I tried not to think about it.

Even though I tried to get my mind off things, I was stuck on trying to find a solution. I had realized that confiding in him made me look like a lunatic and brute forcing it just brought me back to square one. Definition of insanity, or whatever. I theorized that the cycle wouldn’t break if I kept it up. And maybe I just needed to be kinder, nice enough to where whatever had it out for me would start to appreciate my efforts and let up. Just let John finally die. So, I decided to try a more rational approach, something I should've tried earlier but that had not crossed my mind as something that might work. John’s reaction to the blood yesterday gave me an idea.

“Johnny,” I leaned in, muttering my words under the blaring conversations of the people around us. A group of drunk women was bellowing an off-key karaoke rendition of some *ABBA* song. Despite the noise and the girl laughing at whatever joke he just made, John noticed me and gave me his attention. He didn’t look at me, but he leaned ever so slightly closer.

“Hm?”

“I wanna show you something.”

He was still turned to the girl, but slowly started to realize what I meant. I got his full attention and there was a boyish spark in his eyes. “What is it?”

“I can’t tell you.”

He got what I was hinting at and raised his eyebrows in surprise. The girl long forgotten, he downed his drink and shifted in his seat. “You wanna show me right now?”

I nodded and John slowly but swiftly got the group’s attention. He announced we’d leave and paid for everyone’s drinks. The girl that had laughed at his joke made some remark, mewling about it, but he gently shot her down with the promise of being back next weekend. He lit a cigarette as we walked to his car and I got in the driver’s seat. 

“Gimme a hint.”

“No, you didn’t give me one either.”

He groaned loudly, but it held no genuine annoyance. It was more like a game to him and his questions kept him entertained throughout the drive.   
  
“Do I know them?”

“Mh… yeah, you do.” I mumbled, the question being more uncomfortable than I thought. John took a drag of the cigarette and exhaled the smoke. “Light me one too.”

He did and I took it from him to ease my nerves. We arrived at the road that led to the clearing. I killed the engine and grabbed his arm before he could exit.

“You gonna show me or what?”

“Yeah, just… promise you won’t freak out, okay?”

He snorted. “Sure, promise.” 

“I’m serious.”  
  
“I won’t freak, don’t worry.” He stayed for a moment, tilting his head. “What'd you do? You don't usually sound *this* serious.”

“I can't tell you.”

His brows furrowed and he just looked at me with an expression that I couldn’t pinpoint. My wording was weird, I realized. I just stared back, unsure what expression to make in this situation. I tried a smile, but it didn’t land and I felt the need to look away. That got a reaction out of him.

“*You’re* freaking me out right now.”

“Sorry, sorry…”

John waited for me to speak, but when I didn’t he got out of the car. I had asked him just to ease my mind, as if a dumb promise would stop him from reacting however he would when he would see his own dead body. I could tell him about it all I wanted, but showing him undeniable proof would surely work. I had no idea what to expect, except that his reaction wouldn’t be pretty. I know I would’ve freaked out, maybe fainted, but I’ve never seen John react with genuine fear to anything. Or at least he never showed it. We left the car after I grabbed a shovel and flashlight and he let me lead the way into the woods. He was silent until we got to the clearing. I looked at him one last time, then dug up part of the ground where the second most recent corpse was buried. I uncovered the head and did my best to wipe the dirt with my sleeve. John slowly pushed away from the tree he had been leaning against and looked into the hole when I shined the flashlight at the face. I stood still, tense and focused on only John as he analyzed the body. He took the cigarette from his mouth, the initial anticipation leaving as his brows furrowed into a more confused look. I was sure that horror would follow.

“Who is that?” John cocked his head to the side.

“What? Who is-...?” I looked between the alive and dead John, gobsmacked at his audacity to ask who the double in the grave was. “Fuck! Are you blind?”

John shrugged his shoulders, surprised by my tone. “Dude, I don’t know who that is.”

“You don’t know who *that* is?” I shook the beam of the flashlight at the corpse. John had this stupid look on his face that made me grit my teeth. He looked at his own corpse again, closer this time.

“Oh! No, yeah, I know him. That's-... that guy from the bar-”

“No, no, it's not!” I snapped at him louder than I'd expected. I feel ashamed when I think about it, but at that moment I had half a mind to kill him on the spot and return to a fresh blank slate at home. Anything to drop this conversation, now that I knew that even John seeing his own corpse wouldn't break this limbo. I started to wonder if I would've recognized myself had I been shown my own dead body, or if he was too drunk to make the connection. “Forget it, I-”

“No, I wanna know. Who is that?” 

I didn't reply, simply taking a drag of my cigarette when John pressed again. He groaned in resignation and trudged over to me. 

“I'm sorry I didn’t recognize him,” he started, seeking my gaze with his hands running over my shoulders. I pushed them off. “Did I ruin the surprise? Tell me who it is. We'll dig him up again and I'll act like I knew.”

“No, it's- God, John.” I grimaced. “… it’s not important.”

“At least tell me who it is.”

I rubbed my head, looking off while I tried to come up with a name. I hadn’t anticipated him not to recognize himself. I had been so sure it’d work. How was I supposed to know it wouldn’t? I racked my brain for people we both knew.

“...do you remember Eric?” Some guy who used to bully me, whom I haven’t seen in town in years. It seemed like the safest option.

“From high school?” I nodded and John raised his eyebrows. “No way! Tell me everything.” 

“It wasn’t big or anything… I don’t know, he chatted me up at the store, we met up later, and y’know…” I shrugged, praying that neither of us would ever see Eric again. Maybe he had actually moved.

“Look at you.” He praised with a sweet tone in his voice. “You’re ruthless.”

I didn’t know how to feel about the compliment. If anything, it made me feel worse.

I left the woods and got back into my car, sleeves rolled over my hands to keep the blood off the steering wheel. I must've been too convinced that I'd found the solution, or too desperate for it, as this outcome had hit me harder than the other things the past few weeks. When I came back to the house, I didn’t immediately find John. I went to wash my hands in the kitchen sink, peeking my head around the corner to check if he was in any of the other rooms. He would’ve greeted me by now, had he been here. I looked behind myself as if I could have possibly missed him sitting on the couch, then looked back at the hallway. A weird feeling started to sprout in my stomach when I walked down the corridor, peering into each room, but not finding him. “John?” I called, not receiving any answer. It should’ve been relief, I wanted it to be, but it felt less comforting. A hot flash ran through my body and my breathing sped up. Maybe it was excitement masquerading as a panic attack and I was just misinterpreting it. Maybe the relief would come in a minute. It had to. 

A door behind me opened and I whipped around, only to find Dahlia hesitantly checking who came home. She relaxed when she saw me, but I couldn’t reciprocate it.

“Hi-”

“Where’s John?” 

“Uhm,” She stopped in her tracks, glancing down the hall towards the front door. “He said he’d be at a bar, I think.” With the knowledge that we were alone, she placed her hands on my shoulders and put her head on my chest. The bar, right. It made sense, I supposed. I felt Dahlia’s warm lips on my neck. “How are you?” Her hand trailed down to my chest and she slowly stopped. “Oh, your heart is beating really-”

“Listen, I-” I placed a half-hearted kiss on the crown of her head and pulled away. “I gotta go, okay? I just came here for a quick stop.”

“Where are you off to?” Dahlia followed me to the front door.

“I promised John I'd meet up with him.”

“Then why did you ask me where he is?” I tensed up, thankful that I wasn't facing her. I failed to come up with a response before she gently wrapped her fingers around my arm. “Are you okay?”

“Yeah, I'm fine,” The question was nails on chalkboard, the amount of times I'd heard it from the two. I pulled my arm away and turned the doorknob. “I'm just tired.”

“Can you tell me what's wrong?”

In my urgency, I groaned audibly. I was met with Dahlia’s irritated expression when I turned around. It shifted back to concern, and then hurt. I grimaced.

“I really need to go-”

“Are you mad at me? Did I do something wrong?”

She waited for a reply before turning away. I sighed. Begrudgingly, I let go of the doorknob and walked over, sitting down on the couch next to her. “You didn’t do anything wrong, I promise. I'm sorry, Dahlia. I don’t-... I don't know what’s wrong, I can’t explain it.”

She let me take her hand in mine and I watched my own thumb rub over her fingers.

“Maybe you should talk to someone? You've been so agitated recently, maybe you can look for a professional. I'm sure they could help.” She hesitated, then added. “I'm really worried about you.”

“You don’t need to be.” I kept my eyes on her hand. “I’ll think about it, okay?”

I hoped the lie would satisfy her, slowly getting up again as I let her hand slip out of mine. 

“Okay, okay that’s good.” Dahlia smiled at me, then quickly continued. “Did you guys figure out where that blood came from?”  
  
“What? Uh… not really, no.” It had already slipped my mind.

“It was really scary... I almost fainted when I saw it. What do you think was up with it?”

“John just probably…” I was already by the door again, tapping my fingers on the doorknob. “I don’t know, he probably dragged someone in and just didn’t bother cleaning up after.”  
  
“But he looked really confused, no?” I breathed out, shrugging again and opening the door. “I finished the book, by the way.”

“Yeah?” I glanced back at her, seeing her expectant smile. “I’ll get you a new one tomorrow.” I forced a smile in return. “I’ll see you later, okay? I really have to go now. You know how John gets when he has to wait."

Dahlia just nodded. I’d talk to her later properly, but right now I had something much more important to do. If I could’ve explained it to her I would’ve, but I had to leave her with that disappointed look on her face.

I gripped the steering wheel tightly as I sped down the cracked asphalt road towards the bar. I tried to calm my nerves, but I flung the door open hard enough to make a few of the guests turn their heads. My eyes scanned the bar until they landed on John sitting in the booth we had left earlier tonight. The long-awaited relief finally washed over me, a conflicting barrage of emotions followed. John spotted me and his eyes lit up. His attention was on me and he ushered the drunk girl off his lap as I approached, making room for me next to him.

“Finally you’re here! Took you long enough.”

As I sat down he introduced me to some of the new people among our usual group of friends. I remembered them from before, but they were seeing me for the first time. Like before, I didn’t bother remembering their names. I just gave a forced smile while trying to stifle my labored breathing. I sat closer to John, to the point where my shoulder was touching his. He allowed me to grab his whiskey with a shaky hand and down it in one go while he ordered another round for the table. 

I relied on the alcohol to get through the night and regretted it deeply in the morning. The nausea that forced me awake was nothing compared to the fact that I had reached a dead end once again, but that this time I was completely lost on how to proceed.
