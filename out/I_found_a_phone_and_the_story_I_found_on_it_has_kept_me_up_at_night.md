This was seemingly written by a girl called Allissa, from what I can tell, she was in her mid 20s, and has an incredibly harrowing tale. The phone I found this on was damaged, so I have had to reconstruct some bits, and break it up a little, so it is a more digestible read. I decided I needed to post this, just in case anyone knew someone similar to what Allissa had to deal with.

I need to tell you something, as I write this, my hands are trembling slightly, and I just can't shake this sickening feeling in my stomach, I just need to tell someone about this, and you'll do.

I have a friend, or at least, had a friend, a few years ago, on my university course, he was a clingy, odd guy, who was quite excitable and hyperactive to a concerning degree sometimes, his name was Ed.

He was a good guy, I thought at least, he would pay for everyone's meals when he was out with friends, he would bring snacks to share when you'd invite him over, offer constant support, always finding a way to put a positive spin in even the worst situation, and intently listen when you had to get something off your chest.   


He was fantastic, even if his energy was a little much to deal with a lot of the time, I loved having him around. He was known in our course as the "bug guy", because he was absolutely obsessed with bugs, flies, spiders, pill-bugs, anything with a lot of legs. Ed would always have an obscure fact about whatever weird bug he'd point out on a wall, or hanging from the ceiling, but despite his bizarre obsession, he was a blast.

He promised when our uni course ended, we would stay in touch, even though I was moving away to another state, so we wouldn't be able to meet face-to-face often. And that's when he stopped talking to me, at first, he'd just leave me on read, or only respond a week or two after I sent a message, but one day, I tried to message him, and I was blocked.  


It was weird, we hadn't fallen out, what little we did talk was friendly, and not too different from how we use to joke and mess around in uni, so to me, this made no sense. For a while, I occasionally tried to get back in contact through a mutual friend, but everyone I had access to either never responded, or told me the same thing, that they had also been blocked.  


I decided to put it behind me after that, and just get on with things, maybe he was going through a tough time, and needed some time alone, or maybe he just wanted to move on entirely, and leave uni behind. In time, I kind of forgot about it, there was no drama, so it just didn't stick out in my mind, I've drifted away from a few friends over the years, so it just felt like another instance of that.

Skip forwards to a few weeks ago, I was coming down from my home, staying in a holiday home for a couple of weeks, to visit some other friends from that same university course, the very few I managed to stay in contact with. We were planning a day out, shopping, a trip to the beach, and then a meal at a local restaurant. When we were talking about the meal, one of them brought up Ed, joking that "If he were coming, we wouldn't have to pay for a thing". There was a brief moment of stillness in the chat, before another friend asked if anyone had heard from Ed at all since the end of the course.  


Almost everyone said that from the day our course ended, Ed had vanished, everyone, except me, and another friend of mine, Mike. I told them I had contact with Ed for a few months after, before he cut me off, but what Mike said took me aback a little. Ed hadn't blocked him, the two hadn't talked since the end of our course, but he still had an open line of communication. At the time, this sent a shiver down my spine, but I thought it was the excitement of potentially being able to meet up with him again through Mike. We asked if Mike could reach out and ask him if he'd like to meet up. He didn't get a response, but we looked through his profile on the site, and it was odd to say the least.

Posts from around the time he blocked me indicated he'd moved away from home, but, none of his photos ever showed him in a house, it was always in a wooded location, or out at a restaurant with people I didn't recognise. The content of his account was what I found the most strange, in between the occasional photo, he posted videos with strange, undulating backgrounds, like creepy looking kaleidoscopes of red and purple bramble branches, but the audio was the thing that made my spine itch.  


It sounded like some sort of messed up violin music, it was disjointed, and jarring, but intentionally so, making it strangely hypnotic to listen to. We knew he really liked music, but he never played an instrument in the time I knew him, so this wasn't the most surprising development, but the sound of it certainly was. We came to the conclusion that he was trying to get a following for his strange music, probably wanting to make a career from it.

After finishing up our discussion for plans, finally settling on meeting up two days later, I tried to get to bed, but I found myself thinking about Ed's music, the uncomfortably enticing rhythms repeating in my head, I lay there, trying to sleep for hours, until I heard my phone ping from across the room.  


I wasn't getting any sleep, so I may as well see what the notification was, dragging myself out of bed, and across the room to where my phone was resting on my table. I nearly dropped my phone when I saw what the notification was, it was a message from Ed, just a simple "hey", so casual you'd think he hadn't cut me off for years. I sat down on my bed, staring at the message for a bit, I didn't really know how to reply, all this time, and he just says "hey". I was trying to figure out how to respond, when he sent another message. "Leaving me on read? come on now, you don't need to sink to my level". This was the Ed who had vanished from my life, this simple message was practically dripping with his sense of humour.

We talked for a while, catching up, and talking about the "good old days", the conversation felt like I had never left, like he had never faded from my life. I had so many questions, but I held most of them back, I didn't want to cut the conversation short by bringing up why he initially blocked me, the last question I did ask during this exchange was "so, me and a few of the others are meeting up in a couple of days, to hang out, and catch up, would you like to come along too?".  


He didn't respond for a while, I started to worry that I had scared him off, that proposing a face-to-face meeting was too much for him after all these years, but I soon got my response. "I'm really sorry, it'd be great to get the gang back together, but I have shit to do that day, and I don't deal too well with crowds". I was a bit disappointed with this response, but before I could say anything else, there was another message. "I can't do the full group meet-up, but I'm going for an evening wander in the local forest tomorrow, Tarantula-spotting, if you want to join me, we could meet up and hang out for a bit, if I'm being entirely honest, I have something I want to get off my chest in person".

This shocked me, I was surprised by how eager he was to meet after cutting me off entirely for years, but at the same time, I was excited at the prospect of meeting up with him again, I didn't know when I'd be back in this state, and wanted to seize this chance to rekindle an old friendship. I agreed, and we arranged a time, and a place to meet in the forest, me buzzing with the excitement of seeing him again.  


I laid back down in my bed, even less likely to fall asleep now, but as I laid there, I thought about what he said at the end of his invite, "I have something I want to get off my chest". A detail I failed to mention earlier, was his crush on me, or, at least what everyone thought was a crush. He would be incredibly defensive, and clingy around me, giving me obvious preferential treatment, everyone knew, everyone knew I knew, it seems the only one who thought it was a secret was Ed.  


I dreaded the idea that when we met, he would ask me out, or admit having feelings for me, I didn't feel the same way, but I planned to let him down easy if that's what he wanted to say, and I really hoped we could continue being friends after that, but I knew things would have been awkward for a while after. I shot Mike a message, telling him that I had got back in touch with Ed, and will be meeting him the next evening. Mike expressed some concern, saying meeting up in a forest in the evening seemed suspicious to him, but this was Ed, I assured Mike that I trusted Ed, but if I didn't show up to the day out, he'd know the perpetrator.

The next day, I woke up, and felt a strange, foreboding aura, hanging in the air. I pinned it as being some kind of nervous feeling, with meeting Ed coming up later in the day. I took a brief walk around the perimeter of my holiday home, it was a nice place, with a lovely, large garden, which I had promised myself I would give a brief explore when I had a free moment. There were trees around the edge of the garden, acting as a natural fence between the gorgeously maintained garden, and the fields surrounding the property.  


I was walking alongside the trees, when I noticed something from the corner of my eyes, a glistening strand of web, waving in the wind. I turned to it, and took out my phone, I thought if I could get a picture of an interesting bug or spider, I could show it to Ed later, a conversation starter of some sort, but what I saw when I parted the thick layer of leaves made me yelp with surprise. There were spiders everywhere, and I don't mean there were a few webs, I mean there were spiders on every branch of the tree, every inch of the trunk, and thick layers of web between the leaves, with even more spiders.  


I stumbled backwards, and tried to process what I saw, breathing heavily from the shock. I carefully made my way around the rest of the garden, using a stick to part the leaves of the rest of the trees, and I found the same thing. Every tree, every single one, was coated with spiders, from the exposed roots, to the branches, the arachnid-wrapping always suddenly stopping before the tips of the branches, concealing the creeping coating behind the bright green leaves. I took several photos of them, intending to show Ed later, even getting a video where I poked the phone camera into multiple of the trees using my selfie-stick, ready to drop it if a single spider scuttled onto it, and towards my hand.

Looking back at it, the thing that freaks me out the most, is how still they were, since then, I've seen videos of social bugs, they are constantly moving, scuttling around and over each other, a frenzy of legs and mandibles, but these spiders were all completely still. Even when I parted the leaves, and poked the camera in within inches of them, the most I got was a leg or two, lazily waving in the air.  


This added to the sense of unease I was feeling that day, to the point where I almost cancelled on Ed, but my excitement for seeing my old friend kept me from cancelling. I almost heard Ed in my head, putting a positive spin on this "well at least you have something amazing to show me, I'd love to see a tree covered in spiders", and I believed he would be able to re-assure me that this is just a normal, harmless spider habit.

I prepared to leave for the forest shortly after, still a little shaken, I just wanted to get on the move, and put that uneasy feeling behind me. It was a short drive to the forest, but after pulling up in the parking lot, I had a little way to walk before I got to where we had agreed to meet, a place we use to hang out, and smoke a little weed whenever we'd complete our uni work before a deadline.  


It was a small clearing, with some strange tree stumps, partly rotted, but perfectly shaped for seats. There was even a stump that had rotted in the middle, hollowing it out into a bowl shape, and, as unsanitary as it was, we would put snacks in there, so we could pluck out a treat or two whenever we got the munchies.

I sent Ed a message as I walked, to tell him I was on my way to the clearing, but I had no signal, no 5g, so the message wouldn't send. I thought nothing of it, we'd arranged a time, and if I were a little late, I knew he would wait for me. On the way there, with the sun setting through the trees, I noticed several large Tarantulas, perched on the side of trees and logs, sat on the side of the trail, they made me a little uneasy, but it made sense that Ed would want to come here for Tarantula spotting.  


Something I noticed, yet again, after this whole ordeal, is that none of them moved. Usually, when you think of a Tarantula, you imagine them creeping forwards, with that slow, deliberate, crawling gait, carefully feeling out the world around it, like a blind man, with a painful bite. But these Tarantulas were all completely still, out in the open, as if frozen in place, just like the spiders on the trees earlier.

But I didn't make the connection at the time, I just kept walking, scanning the ground, to avoid stepping on any angry spiders. Then, I could have sworn my mind was playing a trick on me, but, I heard that music, the jarringly disjointed string instrument, It was only just on the edge of my perception, so it took me a while to notice, but as I approached the clearing, it got louder, and I realised I wasn't imagining it.  


I thought Ed must be at the clearing, playing some music whilst he waited. My excitement grew, I wanted to ask him about his new musical hobby, and catch up with all the time we had lost. My stride grew faster as I approached, the hypnotic aberration of sound calling me to a place I knew, where so many fond memories had been formed, towards a dear friend I missed more than I had ever realised.

I parted the branches in front of me, the music blaring in my ears, entwined through every vein of my body, pulling me forwards, when it hit me. A sudden, shockwave of quiet, the music still playing, but somehow muted, and there he was, sat on one of the larger stumps near the middle, Ed. The Ed I remembered, but something was off.  


He was gaunt, what little of his face I could see through the shaggy, unkempt beard, and long, messy, strawberry blonde hair, looked colourless. He wore a brown woollen jumper, torn up around the collar, and with one of the sleeves completely shredded, revealing a malnourished, long, thin arm. With this bony arm, he was holding a strange instrument, it looked like an odd cross between a violin, and an archery bow, with multiple strings stretching between the neck, and the body of the thing, which rested against his shoulder, akin to the way a violinist holds their violin under their chin.  


He played it with a violin bow, carefully sawing the thing across the strings, in an act of discordant elegance. I stood there, watching him play for several seconds, before I realised he was staring right into my eyes, not even twitching upon my arrival.

He must have noticed my realisation because at that moment, he stopped playing, and rested the instrument on his torn-up cargo pants. "Hey", he said, baring his teeth in a familiar, awkward grin, "Been a while, huh?". I struggled to find my words for a moment, but eventually blurted out "yeah, not by choice, Mr vanishing act". There was a moment of silence, before Ed burst out into a heartly laugh, instantly dispelling the awkward tension I had felt upon arriving, and making me feel as if it was only yesterday we had been smoking here, and eating trashy snacks out of a tree stump.  


"Get over here, take a seat" Ed bellowed, as he gestured to a near by stump with one of his spindly arms, "I brought snacks aplenty!". I practically skipped over, seeing packets of snacks, resting in the rotted bowl-stump, just as they did years before. The nostalgia as we talked was blissful, despite looking like a gangly homeless man, Ed hadn't changed a bit, he was exactly the same as he was, same humour, same voice, same speech patterns, even the way he'd always attempt to throw the first snack he opened into his mouth like something from a cartoon remained the same.

His instrument eventually came up in conversation, I asked him "so, you got a new hobby, I heard some of your music through your instagram account, but honestly, I've never seen anything like-- whatever that is, it's really cool, but what the fuck is is?". A look of pride surged across his face, and he straightened his back, towering over me, and making me remember how much taller than me he was.  


"I made it myself" he spoke, in a deep, mockingly posh voice, "I call it, the Archaeidae, based on my favourite spider". I laughed, of course he would name it after a spider, it was the most Ed thing he could do. Ed laughed alongside me, whilst cramming a pop-tart into his mouth, before positioning the instrument, as if to play it again. At this point, the sun light was nearly gone, and I was wondering if we were actually going to go Tarantula spotting before the light was all gone. "hey, so, are we actually going to go Tarantula spotting? I saw quite a few on the way here, so it seems like today would be a good day for it?".

Ed froze for a moment, the bow of his instrument poised to play, before he started rapidly sawing it across the strings, a quiet, chilling, and tension building tune, akin to the build up to a scare in a horror movie. "I was hoping we would have a little more time here" he whispered, barely audible through his music. "Oh, I'm sorry, yeah we can spend a bit longer here" I told him, "we don't even need to go Tarantula spotting if you just want to hang out here?" I proposed. Ed sighed, looking towards the ghost of the sunlight, as it crept over the horizon, now barely piercing the trees.  


"No, I shouldn't put this off any longer, I can't just pretend everything's fine forever..." Ed spat, as if he was forcing the words out of his mouth, back hunched, as he continued to play his music, slowly building in volume. "What do you mean?" I said, already internally cringing at the prospect of him confessing some hidden, undying love for me. The tune suddenly changed, to a slow, peaceful humming, I could feel the vibration of the strings through my entire body. Ed was looking at the ground, his eyes seeming vacant. "Allissa", he spoke my name in a rough, serious voice, one I had never heard from him, my own name hitting me like a baseball bat.  


"I need you to listen to what I have to say, in totality, without interrupting", still speaking in this unheard, rough tone. I nodded my head, still taken aback by this sudden change in his voice, and body language.

Ed took a deep breath, as the last of the sun light left the clearing, bathing us in dull gray late evening light, making Ed look even more gaunt and malnourished. He raised his head, and locked eyes with me, still playing his instrument. "For years, I hunted you", he said, with the certainty of a detective accusing someone of murder, "From the moment I met you, you have been my fixation, my goal, my..."  


He stopped for a moment, biting his lip, before spitting out the words, "my-- Prey". I couldn't believe what I was hearing, It didn't feel real, I was expecting a smile to crack across his face at any second, expecting him to laugh and say "just kidding", but it never came. "I didn't know what I was feeling... Didn't understand what I was doing" Ed said, the look on his face mirroring the confused churning feeling in my stomach.  


"I was assessing you, every second, I thought maybe I loved you, or hated you, but it didn't make sense to me, how every second I was with you, you were my sole focus, everything else seemed blurred, unimportant, everything ceased to exist, except you, and the path between me and you. I tried to convince myself I loved you, that I acted like that because I cared about you, deeply, but I quickly realised I was wrong".  


I felt a shiver go down my spine, as my back reflexively straightened, and feet shifted, ready to jump up and run at a seconds notice. Ed looked at me, he knew I was ready to run, but just continued speaking. "I realised, I was hunting you, I learnt your strengths, and weaknesses" He paused, before looking down at my shoes, "like how you can run fast, but struggle with rough terrain", looking across to the tree line "rough terrain, like tree roots across a forest floor", his gaze slowly shifting back, to lock with my eyes.  


He looked hollow, in the low light, I couldn't make out his pupils, but I knew he was staring directly at me.

"I questioned myself, why? why am I hunting?" Ed said, in a chilling mockery of a question. "am I a psychopath? and Cannibal? maybe, maybe I'm a killer, who just found his perfect quarry..." He straightened his back, and let out a chuckle, but it wasn't his usual chuckle, it was low, raspy, and it didn't seem to come from his mouth, it sounded lower, like it was being projected directly from his lungs.  


"No..." he said, slowly slumping back down to his usual hunched position, "I realised soon after, it was nature" he muttered, the tune he was playing picking up in speed slightly. At this point, I couldn't take this, I blurted out "So you're a wannabe murderer, huh?! You want to kill me because you're naturally evil?! Is that what you're saying?!?!".  


His face dropped.   


He stopped playing his instrument.  


Ed's blank eyes stared at me, for a unbearably long time, there was complete silence, other than the creaking of the trees in the wind. That's when I noticed them, the cracks in his skin. A series of symmetrical cracks, on his face, looping under his eyes, across his forehead, and a couple spreading across his cheeks, looking like an unbearably wide smile. On his exposed arm, I could see more of these cracks, like joints on a doll, they divided his hands into segments, with wet, slimy-looking black flesh visible in the gaps.  


"I thought..." he murmured under his breath, "I told you not to interrupt...", his mouth barely moving as he spoke. I shifted in my seat, I had no idea what to do, was he about to kill me? Why would he tell me all this if he was just going to slit my throat, or strangle me. I managed to croak out "Why are you doing this, why tell me all this? Is this some kind of sick fantasy to you?".

Ed continued to stare at me, yet again, filling the air with a terrible silence, until he suddenly leapt back into his music, making me jump from the sudden burst of sound. He continued to speak, as his melody became more disjointed. "Have you ever heard of the Myrmarachne?" Ed said, in a more playful tone, but dripping with an odd malice. "No, I-I haven't" I replied, afraid of the sudden change in  his attitude. He leapt into an explanation, "Myrmecomorphy is the term for another organism mimicking an ant, the most common of which are Myrmarachne".  


He raised his head slightly, the little light remaining glinting off the damp flesh visible through the cracks in his face, before saying in a low, reverberating voice "Ant Mimicking Spiders", His eyes narrowing. I noticed at this point that I was shaking, badly, obviously afraid. Ed didn't seem to care, he continued his monologue, "These spiders, they evolved to mimic the bodies and movements of various different ants, with the purpose of getting close to their ant prey without setting off any alarms..."

I realised he wasn't right from the second I saw the cracks in his skin, but the sickening realisation dawned on me as he muttered his next sentence, looking away from me, almost as if musing to himself, "I always did wonder why everyone else had parents, the concept just didn't sit right with me, so impersonating my parents over the phone to get into school, college, and university just seemed right...".  


The creature sitting across from me, who I spent years studying alongside, who I told my darkest secrets, and shared my highest and lowest moments with, was a grotesque, human-mimicking spider, I could see it now, the cracks in his skin were joints in his exoskeleton, his visible arm looked more like a pale spider-leg with a human hand on the end, than a normal human arm, were those signs always there, or somehow did nobody notice these features?.

I felt numb, but with a dull sensation in my throat, that made me feel like I would puke at any moment. I managed to muster the strength to talk "so you never cared about me... about anyone then, you were just... mimicking us... so you could hunt us". At this Ed snapped his face back to me, "NO!" he spat, causing me to recoil into my seat, "No, I-- I cared, I-- I still care" His face twisted into a contorted mess, the cracks widening as what I believe was a pained look spread across his face.  


"I-- I found out I was this, I found out I was different, and it hurt! I cared about you, even if it was just mimicking emotion, it felt real to me, and I--". At this point, I cut Ed off, blurting out, "Then why are you telling me this?! You know I'm going to go straight to the police if you let me walk away, you literally just told me you wanted to kill me!". Ed, still playing his cacophony of a tune, lowered his head, and spoke softly and slowly.

"All I have been able to think about, is you. No matter what I did, no matter who I met, I kept looping back to hunting you..."

He looked up at me, "Do you know, Allissa..." Looking like every word was hurting him, "How many times, in the dark winter evenings, I have stood meters from you, hidden by the darkness on the other side of the window, poised, and ready to strike". I felt the adrenaline surge through me, as every inch of my body tensed up at this, he must have noticed this sudden surge, as he lowered his head, saying "yes, yes I know where you live".  


I wanted to scream, call out for help, yell at Ed and call him a monster, but I knew that wouldn't help me. "why didn't you--" I started, but Ed cut me off, "I didn't want to! I told you, I care, I don't want to hurt you, I don't want to hurt anyone". Ed raised his head, his eyes had become oily black, the eyes of a spider, but there were tears running along the cracks and joints in his face. "I hid, out here, in the woods, rarely communicating with anyone, so I wouldn't want to hunt anyone else, b-but". His face suddenly shifted to a deadly calm, "But Allissa, I can't get you out of my head, I need this torment to end".

"What... What do you mean?", I asked the spider, knowing what the answer would be. "Allissa, I need to hunt you, Allissa..." His voice started to distort, lowering in pitch, "Allissa, I need you to run, to flee, hide and don't stop hiding". He suddenly stopped playing his instrument, and spoke in a deep, emotionless voice.  


"I will give you a chance to flee, If you escape me, If you prove yourself to difficult to catch, I will no longer want you..."  


Before I could stop myself, I asked a question I didn't want to know the answer to.  


"What happens if you catch me?"

The Spider stayed horrendously still for several seconds, before slowly opening his mouth, as a pair of long, curved fangs slid from either side of his jaw. The longer I watched, the more fang came out, until they were nearly as long as my forearm, before they suddenly vanished back into the spiders face.

I realised tears were careening down my face at this point, I was terrified to my core, that the person, no, this bug, who had deceived me for so many years, was about to kill me.  


He spoke again, in an almost commanding tone, "I will give you a head start, so you will stand a chance, you will know I'm hunting you when you no longer hear my music", And with that, he begun to play by far the most disjointed, horrendous tune I had heard from him.

I was frozen, processing everything for a few moments, I was trying to think of something, anything I could say, when he spoke again, in an incredibly nonchalant tone, "I call this piece, Ensnared", looking straight into my eyes, as he said "It's not a very long song..."  


Taking the hint, my body flew into overdrive, pumped up on adrenaline, I darted into the darkened tree line, stumbling through the trees and foliage, getting cuts on my hands, arms, and legs, at one point even stumbling face-first into a tree, and breaking my nose, at the time I didn't even notice, with the adrenaline blocking out all sensation.  


I could hear the music in the distance, getting fainter and fainter, praying it would fade away into the distance as I ran, but no such luck. It felt like hours, but was likely only a couple of minutes when I heard the music come to an abrupt halt, bringing with it a veil of complete silence, and absolute fear.  


I found myself muttering "No, no, no, no" under my breath, but quickly silenced myself, I didn't know how fast he could move, I didn't know how well he could track me, I was running blind in a dark forest, being pursued by a giant spider.

I ran, and ran, I didn't want to stop, but the fatigue was getting to me, so I found a ditch, and hid in the shadows for a moment, away from the moonlight, which had since spread itself across the ground, and that's when I saw him. Crawling along, on all fours, his torn up clothing hanging from his spindly frame, and his wretched instrument slung on his back.  


Until that moment, probably due to the many layers of baggy clothing he use to wear, I had never noticed how disproportionately long his limbs were compared to his body, and the way he moved, it will stick with me until I die. His arms flicked out in front of him, before slowly pulling him forwards, as his legs dragged along behind him, lazily keeping his body from touching the ground.  


He was so close to me, I held my breath, and tried to stop shaking, as I saw him stick a long, pointed red spike out of his mouth, poking the ground, at some liquid. I felt icy spider-legs grip my heart, as I realised it was blood, my blood, from the cuts on my hands and legs, and he was using it to track me. He started to slowly move towards me, unknowingly about to end the hunt that had lasted so many years, until his head suddenly jerked up, as he spun around, and disappeared in the other direction, moving so fast I my eyes couldn't track him.  


Seizing my opportunity, I ran for it. I didn't consider stealth, or caution, I just ran. I got so many cuts and bruises on my arms, legs, hell, my entire body, I must have looked like a zombie. I found the parking lot, but as I did, I heard something in the distance, a scream, a blood-curdling, horrified scream, brought to an abrupt end, and in a moment of utter dread, I realised, some poor, unrelated, innocent person, had just taken the fall for me.  


Ed heard someone, and thought they were me.  


Almost as a confirmation, I heard the distant sound of Ed, yelling, in a combination of rage, and, I think, horror, that he had killed someone who wasn't me. I'll never understand him, but as much of a monster as he was, I know he didn't want to be a killer. I got in my car, and drove off, as fast as I could, I didn't look at my speedometer, I didn't care where I was driving, I even ran-down a couple of road signs, and kept going. I just needed to get out of there. I didn't even pick up what little I had at my holiday home, I just drove and drove, heading back to my home.

Aside from stopping at a gas station, the drive home was uneventful, my mind however, was anything but. My thoughts were racing, I didn't know how to process everything, giant human-mimicking spiders exist, one of them was hunting me, it just killed someone, when it should have killed me, I was crying so much I could barely see the road, I just wanted to get away, far-far away from here, far away from that fucking spider.

So, that's what I did, I packed my bags, and fled, leaving for another country the next day, I didn't even check my phone until I was outside of the United States, and I wish I had checked it sooner. The scream, the damn fucking scream I heard in the forest, it was Mike.  


There was no signal, no 5g, in the forest, so I didn't get Mikes dms checking in on me, he got worried, and came to the woods, I found out from later investigation that Ed had always given Mike the creeps, and he was afraid of Ed doing something to me, so, he came to the forest. He searched for me, he was trying to protect me, and he'll never know he's the only reason I got out of that forest alive. It should have been me, I should have died, in that shadowy ditch, ripped apart by a face I once considered my closest friend, and I have carried this guilt, and fear with me for years.   


I know nobody would believe me, but I trust you with this, even if you think I'm crazy, I don't care, I just need to get this out, I just need to tell someone.  


I fled, I ran, I left the country, but I haven't proven myself to be too difficult prey to catch. I hear it every night. That fucking piece of music, "Ensnared", the proof that I never escaped his fucking web. It get's closer every few days, I have a safe room, but I can't hide in there forever.

I'm sorry to say, I don't know what happened to her, I found this story on a damaged phone I found whilst hiking through a local woods, it didn't seem to have a password, and this here story was sent to someone labelled as "Agatha", who I believe from prior communication, was a close internet friend of Allissa.  


I found this phone in early 2022, and have hesitated from posting this anywhere, but the messages were sent in late 2019, so this happened a few years ago. From other information I could glean from the semi-corrupted phone, which I will not be writing down here for privacy reasons, I found the girls social medias, and she hasn't posted anything in years.  


Whether this is her trying to lay low, so this Ed character doesn't find her, or if the poor girl was finally caught by the spider, I don't know, I can only pray she made it out alive.

For me though, the worst part, are the photo's on her social media, and on her old friends social media accounts from the time she was in university.  


There are so many with a guy I believe to be Ed, a scruffy man, with a shaggy beard, and long, messy hair, and whilst these pictures alone may be unsettling, it get's worse. In every picture with Allissa, even the ones where he's at an angle facing away from her, his eyes are swivelled to stare directly at her.
