Hey there, it's Ella. I'm from the Philippines. My country is no different from other countries when it comes to superstitious beliefs. There were times that we'd never believe it until we experienced it ourselves.

This is not a story that I have experienced myself. It's my grandma's. This happened when she was little and one of her neighbors died. 

So you see, Philippines usually hold wakes for more than half a month. They may be waiting for their loved ones to come home before they bury their dead, which happened in this wake I am talking about, or they don't have enough money to pay for the burial which is why they cannot bury their dead right away.

My grandma and her dad were out to pick up some dry wood when they passed by the wake of their neighbor, Pedro, who died a few weeks ago on their way home. Pedro had a daughter who was working abroad at that time and they were waiting for her to go home before they buried him. 

My great-grandpa was shocked when he saw that the wake was very quiet. It's as if no one was inside, which made him really curious because the wake was full of people when they passed by earlier. Due to his curiosity, he decided to go inside and check what might be happening. He left my grandma outside the house to guard the woods they picked up. To his shock, all the people inside the house were sound asleep except for one person who was wearing a Barong Tagalog (traditional men's clothing in the Philippines) and was standing in front of these people who were asleep.

The man was holding a fiber of a plant (which I forgot the name, my bad) that is used to make sleeping mats. He measured all the people sleeping inside the house from head to toe and he's putting all these fibers inside his pants' pocket. My great-grandpa was asking the man what was he doing that time, but he got no response that was why he decided to enter the house. When he checked the coffin, there was no one inside. When he checked who the man wearing a Barong Tagalog was, he was really shocked and frightened because it was the man who was supposed to be dead and inside the coffin.

Due to his fear instincts, he picked up my grandma, left their woods in that place, and ran back home. He was shouting for help, which according to my grandma, also frightened her.  When they reached home, they told my great-great-grandpa, Lolo Genaro, about what they saw. Lolo Genaro was a faith healer during his time. When he heard about this, he asked more people to come with him and check whether what my great-grandpa told him was true.

When they arrived at the wake, all the people were sleeping soundly just like what my great-grandpa had told them. The people who came with my Lolos did their very best to wake these people up, but they were also shocked to know that they're not waking up despite all their efforts. That's when an idea came into Lolo Genaro's mind. He remembered that my great-grandpa saw him putting some fibers inside his pants, so he opened the coffin and checked the inside of his pockets. He was frightened to see that there were fibers inside his pockets and as he slowly pulled them out one by one, the people inside the house who were in a deep sleep started to wake up. 

As he pulled the last string of fibers inside the dead man's pocket, he felt something twitched. It felt like a hand twitched so he immediately closed the coffin and told the family about what my great-grandpa saw, and advised them to not let the inside of their house empty and to designate someone to stay fully awake until the old man was buried already.

They thanked Lolo Genaro for saving their lives. After a week, the man was buried by his family and thanks to my Lolo, they'll never have to come with their dead loved one.

Currently, we are also preparing for the wake of my grandma's sister, and because of this story, my relatives are taking turns on staying up til morning.
