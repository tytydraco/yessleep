I know it's been a while. That's my bad. But a lot has happened since I last wrote, and I feel you all deserve to know what happened.

I don't know if I can ever explain it. But I'll try. 

"Hey, Arden... there's someone on the phone for you. Would you come here?" 

I looked up from the book I had been pretending to read, resting against my folded up legs. I often found myself in this position these days, sitting in my parent's kitchen on the window nook, crumpled up as tightly as I could manage. Every morning my back ached like I had aged forty years overnight. 

My mother stood in the doorway, tapping her foot impatiently. She did it like she thought I would think she was being subtle, one hand on her hip and the other clutching our boxy landline phone. I blinked in surprise. 

"On the landline?" 

"Not everyone has a fancy new cell phone, Arden. Now take it, my hand is cramping up." 

I was surprised at how easy it had been to move out of the apartments, but I wasn't surprised my parents had let me move back in. I expected more pushback from our landlord, but my parents, my mother specifically... it was like she was always waiting for me to prove her right. When I told her I was coming home, she sighed, and I swore I could hear the hint of a smile in her tone. *"What happened now, honey?"*

But I knew I couldn't complain, and she knew it too. I had reached the end of the line. There was nothing else to do... after what I saw, I wasn't sure I could ever live alone again, frankly. 

I stood and walked over to her, thanking her under my breath and taking the phone. She huffed and marched off, and I was left there alone, staring at the receiver, my face slack. It was like I knew before I even brought it up to my ear. 

"Hello? Who is this?" 

"Hey, Arden." Her voice was angry, a hint of red hot frustration weaving between each punchy letter, but there was something else there too. I felt my face go pale. "Sorry to call you like this. You haven't been answering your cell, so I found this number in the phonebook." 

Guilt stabbed at my gut like a hot poker. I glanced over at my cell phone, which sat on the kitchen table... I knew it had been wrong, but I had blocked all of their numbers the day after I got out of there. I didn't want to think about it, any of it. I didn't want any connection to that cursed place. 

"Hi, Gianna." 

"Yeah, hi," she snapped, sounding more annoyed by the second. "Look, I know you had to leave. I get that. We would too if that was an option..." She trailed off, leaving the rest unsaid, but heavily implied: I was simply luckier than they were. "...but you need to come back." 

"What!?" I exclaimed, louder than I meant to. I winced, only continuing when I heard no angry shout to quiet down from the other room. "What? Why?" 

She sighed loudly, and it was like I could hear her face sinking. I could hear her resolve slipping, and her feet pacing around her room. I knew that something had to be wrong, something worse than what had already been wrong. Something big. 

"It's Mey," she said finally, and my heart jumped. The hot poker in my stomach twisted. "Listen, I can't explain over the phone. I just need you to come back. It's important." 

I faltered. I felt my eyes sting. As soon as I left, I knew I could never come back... I could never associate myself with that place ever again. Nothing about that neighborhood made any sense to me, I didn't trust it. I didn't even know if I could trust Gianna. 

But Mey... 

The day I left, her eyes were still swollen. She hadn't stopped weeping since Will was taken. 

"*Don't go,*" she said to me. She couldn't even look at me, her head bowed, sitting motionless on her bed. 

"*I'm sorry.*" 

"*Something bad will happen if you go. I just feel it. Please don't go, Arden.*" 

I knew. I just didn't want to know. I knew if something had happened to Mey, I had to go back. There was no choice, no third option. 

It was my fault. 

"Arden," Gianna said, after the silence had hung in the air between us for a good minute. "Please." 

"Okay. I'll come back." 

"Good. Great. Just... be subtle, okay? They're everywhere right now." 

I heard the phone click, my mouth hanging open to reply, to ask what the hell she meant by that. 

\--

By the time I reached the neighborhood, dusk was creeping across the skyline. I felt a shiver run up my spine, recalling vividly what happened here at night. 

As I drove down our old street at twenty miles an hour, I felt something strange. I felt like I was being watched. When I turned my head curtains pulled shut, people ducked back behind their doors... everything was just out of my sight, in the corner of my eye.

It was even eerier here than it had been when I left, which I hadn't thought possible. 

Gianna met me in front of the apartment building, sitting on the steps and smoking a cigarette between pale, trembling fingers. By the pile of ash and butts beside her, I could tell it wasn't her first. Her red hair was down and frizzy, like she hadn't brushed it in a while, and her eyes looked small and puffy. 

When I parked and got out of the car, she slowly raised her head to look up at me. I couldn't read her expression as she stood, and it occurred to me that she might hit me, or strangle me, or both. 

"Gianna, I-" 

She cut me off, pulling me into the tightest hug of my life. I swore I could hear my own ribs crack. Her wool scarf scratched against my neck, and her hair stuck to my chapstick. 

"Thank you for coming back," she muttered into my ear. "Fuck you for leaving." 

I laughed dryly, patting her back awkwardly. "I deserve that." 

She finally pulled away, and I tried to gasp for breath as subtly as possible. Jesus, that girl was strong. She smiled at me weakly, readjusting her jacket. 

"Come on, come inside. I know she'll be happy to see you." 

I froze, my eyebrows cinching into a frown, my heart pounding in my chest. 

"Wait... Mey's here? She wasn't... taken?" 

Gianna glanced back at me as she mounted the stairs, pressing her lips tightly together. 

"No. She was." 

\-- 

When we got upstairs, Gianna unlocked her door and looked around, her eyes flickering up and down the hallway. I wanted to ask, but I knew better than to do it there. 

She pushed the door open just enough for us to slip inside, and I followed her lead. I heard her lock the door again behind us as I stared, wide eyed, at her apartment. 

It was a mess. There was almost nothing that wasn't broken, shards of pottery, flower stems, and glass coating the wooden floor. Anything that wasn't bolted down was strewn across the room. The walls were streaked with something that looked suspiciously like dried blood. 

In the corner of the room, Mateo was hunched in front of someone. His hair had grown out a bit, it was looking shaggy, and he seemed like he had lost a bit of weight. 

"It's okay... it's okay... it's just Gianna and Arden... you remember Arden, don't you?" 

I heard a choked whimpering sound, and then a gurgle. I stood there in front of the door, unable to move, unable to say or do anything. 

Mateo shifted, turning back to look at us, and I saw her. 

I saw her, but she didn't see me. 

Mey sat in the corner, hugging her knees, which were riddled with bruises and scrapes. She was wearing a blue hospital gown and she rocked back and forth in strange, jerky motions. "Help," she whispered, her voice raspy and painful sounding. "Help, help me..." Her black hair that was so silky and perfect before was wild now, missing patches, leaving bright red speckled spots of skin behind. Her face was swollen, almost in the way it had been the day I left, and smeared with fresh blood, and her eyes... 

She had no eyes. 

"M-Mey-" I choked out, forcing sound to leave my throat. I turned away and bent over, heaving and gagging over the pile of shattered ceramics. Gianna placed a hand on my back. 

"She went after Will," she whispered, her voice barely audible, her palm making small circles between my shoulder blades. "A few days after you went home, we heard him out there again. He was calling us by name. She just... couldn't take it." 

I gagged again, but nothing would come out. Another gurgling moan came from the corner, growing into a whine. Out of the corner of my eye I saw her start to pull at her hair, and Mateo grabbed her wrists. 

"How... why... is she... *here?!*" 

Gianna took a shaky breath. 

"I went a little crazy when she was taken. I slept in the lobby every night, just waiting for her to come back... when I finally heard her out there a week or so later, Mateo and I ran out there and grabbed her. That white van came, but we managed to get her inside before they caught us..." 

I swallowed hard, my throat suddenly painfully dry. Gianna glanced around the room, as if someone might be listening to us. 

"They saw us," she mumbled, hugging herself. "Obviously they saw us take her, and there are cameras everywhere... they know we have her. But no one has come for us. It's like they're waiting for something." 

Mey let out a sob, writhing in Mateo's grip. "Help, please help... hurts..." 

My lip trembled. I stood up straight, holding out my hand and creeping toward her. 

"Hi, Mey..." I bit my lip, fighting back tears. Mey trembled and rocked, her head tilted vaguely in my direction. Where her eyes had been there were only gory holes... *like Shannon. They did the same thing to her that they did to Shannon. It had to be some kind of message...* "It's me, Arden... I'm here now, I came back..." 

"There's one more thing," Gianna said, and I felt her eyes watching me, cautious. "The screaming... it stopped. They don't come anymore, the people begging for help... but every night..." 

Right as she trailed off, the alarm rang out, more deafening than ever. Red lights flashed, flooding the apartment in crimson. 

I was struck with a deeply familiar fear, the same fear I had felt my first night here. It made my bones ache and my ears ring. 

Mey whipped her head around, her body tensing. She began to whine louder and louder, as if she were a dog howling along to ambulance sirens. Mateo immediately reached to cover her mouth with his hand, but after only a second he shouted in pain and pulled away, his fingers trickling blood. 

"Mey, it's okay!" Gianna cried. I started towards her again, reaching out to take her in my arms, but I only made it a few steps before she charged at me. 

Mey tackled me to the ground, and I landed with a loud *THUD*. I reached for her wrists as she screamed and thrashed, but in her desperation, she overpowered me. I felt her fingernails dig into my face, scratching at me like a frightened animal, inching up toward my eyes. 

I screamed, trying to squirm away from her. Finally, Gianna and Mateo took her by either arm, hauling her off of me. I sat up, breathing heavy, and touched my face. It stung, and my fingertips came back stained red. 

Mey slumped over, still behind held up by her friends. I took a few last gulping breaths, just looking at her, trembling. Then I crawled forward, carefully wrapping my arms around her. 

She protested weakly, but not for long. After a moment she went completely limp, letting me hold her, sobbing wetly in my ear. I reached up, petting her hair, careful to avoid the spots where she had ripped it out. 

"It's okay," I whispered, squeezing my eyes shut so my tears couldn't fall. "I'm sorry for leaving you. I was a coward. I'm so sorry." 

I held her like that, cradling her, until the alarm finally stopped. The quiet that came after was almost more unbearable, making everything still. My head ached. 

"Will you stay the night?" Mateo asked me finally, and he sat down beside us. Gianna followed suit. 

"Of course. Of course I will." I sighed, opening my eyes to look at them. "Can I stay with her?" 

"I was hoping you would ask," Gianna said with a weak smile. "We're exhausted. Would you mind if you stayed here, and Mateo and I slept over at his place?" 

I shook my head. Gianna squeezed my shoulder. 

"Thanks, Arden. Really. Tomorrow we can think of something... but tonight I really just need some sleep." 

Mateo nodded in agreement. I realized both of their eyes drooped with dark purple bags beneath them. 

"Yeah. Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll think of something." 

\-- 

After we said our goodnights, I carefully put Mey in the bed. She was silent now, and still beside the shaking. 

I took a wet rag and very carefully cleaned up her face. When the blood was gone, I could almost recognize her again. I brushed her hair away from her face, staring into the place where her eyes had been. 

I still felt wary. It was hard to believe it was really her sitting in front of me... maybe it wasn't, none of us could know. Maybe she really had been transformed into some kind of creature. But in the chance that it was her, I wasn't going to let her sleep alone. Not again. 

I rested my forehead against hers, and she let me, drooling into her own lap. 

"I'm so sorry," I told her again. "I should have stayed. I'm such a coward." 

She opened her mouth and closed it again, like a fish. Like she wanted to say something, but she couldn't. I felt the tears coming again, and now I let them fall. 

When I finally drifted off to sleep, Mey pressed against my side still shaking, I dreamed of Will. I dreamed that he was outside, standing in front of the building, staring up at our window, his eyes wide and his jaw dropped open in a silent scream... but when I woke up and ran to the window, no one was there. 

\--

"Okay," I said, taking the cup of coffee Gianna handed me, smiling at her gratefully. "I know what to do." 

"After one night?" Mateo asked, eyeing Mey warily. She was crouched over, tapping her head against the ground slowly in a rhythmic *thunk thunk thunk*. 

I shrugged. "Do either of you have any ideas?" 

They both shook their heads, glancing at each other. I took a sip of my coffee. 

"Hear me out, then." 

Mey hit her head against the floor a little quicker, a little harder, letting out a low groan. "Help me... help me..." 

"I'll take her," I continued, reaching out to touch her shoulder. She flinched away from me as if I had burned her. "I'll take her out there when the alarm starts, and I'll... I'll let them take me." 

Mateo and Gianna both stared at me, their mouths open. I felt my stomach twist again, but this time not out of guilt. Out of fear. I pushed it down, not wanting to let it take over me again. 

"No, Arden, oh my god! You can't do that, they'll... they'll mutilate you, or kill you, or something!" 

I shrugged again, avoiding their eyes. *Thunkthunkthunk*, Mey's head hit the floor. I  tried to gently pull her back. 

"I don't know what else there is to do. I want to *know*, don't you?" 

Gianna shook her head quickly, crossing her arms. "Not badly enough for that! Besides, if you do that we'll never know. You'll come back like... like..." 

"Like Mey?" 

Gianna glared at me, huffing. "Yeah. Like Mey, or Will, or Shannon. Or you won't come back at all." 

"But maybe... maybe there's a chance, maybe I could get them out of wherever they are. Like how you saved Mey." 

*THUNKTHUNKTHUNKTHUNKTHUNK*. 

Mey slammed her head against the floor, hard enough to leave a bloody imprint. Mateo grabbed her and put her into a light headlock, restraining her. She screamed. "HELP! HELP ME, SOMEONE, HELP! HELP, HELP, HELP, HELP, HELP..." 

"We'll come with you," he grunted, raising his voice to be heard over her shouting, wincing from the effort it was taking to hold her still. 

"No, you can't, you-" 

"We'll come with you," he repeated, looking at me pointedly. "End of story." 

"Yeah," Gianna chimed in, chewing on her bottom lip. "Yeah, that's a good idea. At least that'll give us a better chance..." 

I sighed, taking a slow sip of my coffee. I knew there was no point arguing with them, and to be completely honest, it was comforting to think of them coming with me. I felt like fainting thinking about doing something like that alone. 

"Fine," I muttered. "Okay. Fine. We'll go tonight. Okay?" 

There was silence for a moment, Mey's whines and pleas for help cutting through it every few seconds. 

"Yeah. We'll go tonight." Gianna pushed some hair behind her ear, and I noticed her hand was shaking. "Deal." 

"And we'll bring them back." 

"We'll bring them back," Mateo repeated, smiling like he didn't believe it for a second. 

\--

That was how we ended up in the street, the streetlights flashing a blinding red and the sirens wailing in our ears, ricocheting off every side of my skull and making it feel like my brain was shaking. Gianna held one of my hands and I held Mey's with the other. Mateo was on the other side of her, and together we kept her from attacking anyone or running away or both. 

I could see the people in the buildings watching us from their windows and from their doors, muttering things I couldn't hear to each other and shuffling around. I closed my eyes, not wanting the reality of what we were doing to set in and cause me to back out. 

Right when I started to think maybe nothing would happen, I heard it. Tires peeling around a corner, the screech of brakes, and the smell of exhaust. Gianna squeezed my hand, and I heard her whisper *oh God* under her breath. 

I opened my eyes to see four men climb out of the van. They were wearing blank masks, like ski masks but without any holes, so they could barely even be identified as human, and they had on strange white lab coats. They began to grab us, and Mey screamed and cried frantically, kicking at them as hard as she could as they lifted her off the ground. 

Gianna held my hand tightly until our fingers went cold and white, even as they tried to pry her away. I heard her crying, and even though this was our plan, I could tell she wanted desperately to fight them and run away as fast as she could. I was feeling the same way. 

Mateo barely even moved. He let them wrestle him into the van without saying a word, his face cold and still, his jaw tense. 

The last thing I remember is Gianna finally being pulled away from me, and my body being slammed down against what felt like a gurney. The van sped away alarmingly fast, and a man in another mask approached me, holding a syringe with a long, thick needle. 

"Wait, wait!" I choked, holding out my hands, but it was too late. He plunged the needle into the side of my neck, and the world spun and dimmed into black. 

\-- 

When I opened my eyes, I was in a silent white room. 

I slowly looked around, my eyes struggling to adjust to the bright light. I looked down at myself, and found I was in a blue hospital gown, lying on top of some kind of stiff white bed. It took me a long moment to remember where I was, and why... but when I did, I nearly had to throw up. 

The room had no windows. It only had the bed, a small metal bedside table, and a door across the room that was the same color as everything else. The only way to identify it as a door was the round silver handle. In the upper right corner there was a small black camera. 

Carefully, I swung my legs over the side of the bed. I tested the ground, my knees nearly giving out... but after a moment, I was able to stand up. I shuffled over to the door. I didn't expect it to open, not at all. 

But it did. 

After one turn of the knob I was able to push it open, the door swinging open. I very nearly fell on my face, having not been prepared for it to move. 

The door opened to a long, carpeted hallway. It buzzed with life, people of all kinds wandering up and down and between rooms, all in hospital gowns, talking amongst themselves. I blinked, gazing around warily. A couple of kids sprinted past me, nearly tripping over themselves. I stumbled back, gripping the doorframe for support. 

"Arden!" Someone shouted from down the hall, and I nearly jumped out of my skin. I turned, and I gasped. 

There stood my friends - Gianna and Mateo were there, as well as another girl with strawberry blonde hair, smiling ear to ear, and between them... 

"*Will?!*" 

He grinned at me. I instantly forgot about the weakness in my legs, stumbling towards them like a baby deer learning to walk. 

"Hey, Arden," he said when I was closer, still smiling wide. He wrapped an arm around me, the other one wrapped around the other girl, and gave me a squeeze. 

I pulled away after a second, looking him up and down. No blood, seemingly no injuries at all... he seemed perfectly untouched. I squinted at him in suspicion. 

"What the hell is going on?" 

He shrugged his shoulders, looking around as if he were seeing it for the first time too. "After I went after Shannon, they brought me here... I was locked in one of those rooms for who knows how long. They gave me food and books to read, but not much else. This is the first time the doors have been open..." 

"Does that mean..." my voice faded away. He nodded, confirming what I hadn't asked. 

All of the people around me had been victims. Some of them I could even recognize... I swore one of the old men standing next to a wall, speaking to a woman, was that man I had seen that first night. The one who had looked right back at me and screamed, so bloodcurdlingly that I still had nightmares about it. I shivered. 

"Wait," I whispered, something occurring to me. "Does *that* mean that-"

Someone tapped my shoulder. I turned slowly, afraid to look. 

Mey stood in front of me, her hands clasped behind her back, a shy smile on her face. She was like a snapshot of that first day, the day I had met her. She fluttered her eyelashes at me, her eyes slightly watery. She was *completely fine*. 

A strange groan of relief left my throat, and I enveloped her in my arms, lifting her off the ground and spinning her around. She squealed, laughing and grabbing at my shoulders. As soon as I set her down again she kissed me, wrapping her arms around my neck. 

"I missed you so much," she whispered, resting her forehead against mine. 

*Resting her forehead against mine*... 

I suddenly remembered two nights ago, doing this very thing with a version of her that had no eyes and could only use her voice to beg for help. I bit my lip, frowning. 

"This makes no sense..." 

"I know," Gianna said, matching my expression. "I don't understand at all. How could you all be completely fine if we *saw* you? Who... who did we rescue if it wasn't actually Mey?"

A voice came over some kind of intercom, crackling to life. Everyone in that hallway froze, turning their heads to the ceiling. Mey took my hand and squeezed it, and I let her. 

"*CONGRATULATIONS*," the voice buzzed, so low and unnatural that it had to be altered somehow for anonymity. "*THE TEST HAS BEEN PASSED. THE BYSTANDER EXPERIMENT IS COMPLETE. YOU ARE ALL FREE TO LEAVE, AS SOON AS YOU SIGN YOUR PAPERWORK. THANK YOU*." 

The intercom crackled into silence. The air was heavy, and no one said anything for a long moment. Then, someone began to cheer, then another, then another. Soon cheering was all I could hear, bouncing off the walls, the energy electric all around me. 

My friends hugged me, and I hugged them back, nearly sobbing in relief. It finally felt like that first night again, just sitting and smoking and laughing with them, grateful to have friends... before I knew anything about our neighborhood. Before I believed them about it. 

As we began to file toward the exits, my friends bickering about something meaningless, their faces still glowing with wide smiles, I began to feel uneasy. 

I couldn't stop thinking about the girl I had thought was Mey. I had my suspicions, but deep down I had truly believed it was her... 

My head whipped to the right as I heard a scratching sound, somehow reaching me over the sounds of all the people in the hallway. I stared at the door it had come from, its only discerning feature being the metal doorknob. 

I looked around. My friends didn't seem to even notice I had stopped, still chatting and laughing uproariously. I slipped away from the crowd, my hand shaking as I reached for the knob. 

The door slowly creaked open. The room was dim, and the stench of blood and excrement immediately punched me in the nose. My eyes stung. I blinked through it, squinting. 

In the corner of the room something was hunched over, and I could hear soft gasps and sobs. 

"H-Help... help me... please..." 

Its body was somehow bony and globular at the same time, both wrinkled and decrepit and smooth and youthful. It was impossible to describe. 

It was a mass, an amalgamation, a monster. 

It turned its head to look at me, and I looked back into a thousand faces all at once. I looked back at blood, and broken bones, and teeth, and pain. 

I looked back at the old man with the missing arms, and the children who squawked like chickens, and Shannon with her missing eyes. I looked back at Will.  

I looked back at Mey. 

"Help me..." 

I want to believe what I saw in that room was the real monster: it was whatever we saw each night, taking the forms of our loved ones, and they were all safe in that building the entire time. I want to believe it's maybe something artificial, something made specifically for the purpose of their experiment. 

I don't want to believe that what I saw *was* all of them, somehow cosmically smashed together, crammed into the same disgusting figure. Able to mold itself into anybody it contains. A tortured slave to whatever government force did all of this. 

I don't want to believe Mey is in there. Still blind. Still suffering. 

But I just don't know. 

What do you think?
