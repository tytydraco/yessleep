When I was a kid, I went to a small school in the middle of nowhere. It was a strange place, with strange rules and even stranger teachers. But the strangest of them all was Miss Devlin.

Miss Devlin was my fifth-grade teacher, and from the moment I walked into her classroom, I knew that something was wrong. The room was always dark, with the windows covered by thick curtains that blocked out all sunlight. The walls were painted black, and strange symbols adorned every surface.

Miss Devlin herself was a tall, thin woman with pale skin and dark hair. She never smiled, and her voice was always cold and harsh. But what was most unsettling about her was her eyes. They were dark and lifeless, like two black holes that swallowed up all light.

At first, I thought that Miss Devlin was just a mean teacher. She would yell at us for the smallest things and assign us impossible tasks that we could never complete. But then I started to notice strange things happening in the classroom.

The chalkboard would suddenly catch fire, and then just as suddenly, the flames would disappear. And when one of my classmates tried to sharpen their pencil, the sharpener turned into a snake.

I knew that something was wrong, but I was too scared to say anything. I didn't want to be the one to question the devil.

But then, one day, Miss Devlin did something that I'll never forget. She stood at the front of the classroom and began to chant in a language that I didn't understand. The symbols on the walls began to glow, and the room was filled with a sickly green light.

And then, I saw something moving in the shadows. It was a dark, shapeless creature, with sharp claws and teeth like knives. It slithered across the floor, towards one of my classmates.

I wanted to scream, to run, to do anything to stop the creature. But I was frozen, rooted to my spot in terror.

And then, Miss Devlin did something that shocked me even more. She reached out and touched the creature, and it vanished into thin air. She turned to us, a wicked smile on her face.

"You see, children," she said, "I am not your teacher. I am something much more powerful. And you will do exactly as I say."

From that moment on, everything changed. Miss Devlin wasn't just a teacher anymore. She was something else entirely. And we were her subjects, trapped in her classroom, unable to escape.

Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. And as time went on, Miss Devlin grew more and more powerful. The symbols on the walls began to glow brighter, and strange creatures appeared in the classroom, their eyes glowing with an otherworldly light.

But then, one day, something happened that changed everything. One of my classmates, a boy named John, spoke out against Miss Devlin. He refused to do as she said, and instead, he challenged her.

Miss Devlin's eyes grew dark, and her voice was like ice. "You dare to challenge me, John?" she said. "You will regret that."

And with that, Miss Devlin did something that I never thought was possible. She transformed into a monstrous creature, with wings like a bat and horns like a bull. And she attacked John, sinking her teeth into his flesh.

But then, something even stranger happened. The other students in the classroom began to change. Their eyes grew dark, and their skin turned ashen. And then, they began to eat the devil.

I couldn't believe what I was seeing. My classmates were devouring Miss Devlin, the devil herself, as if she were a meal. It was like they were possessed, like they had been waiting for this moment to finally break free of her control.

I wanted to run, to escape the madness that had taken over the classroom, but I was frozen in place. I couldn't take my eyes off the gruesome scene before me.

As my classmates ate the devil, I could see something strange happening. Their eyes began to glow, and their skin started to take on a sickly green hue. And then, they began to transform.

One by one, my classmates transformed into creatures like the devil, with wings and horns and glowing eyes. And then, they turned on me.

I was surrounded, with nowhere to run. The creatures, my former classmates, closed in on me, their claws and teeth at the ready. And then, just as they were about to attack, everything went black.

I woke up in a hospital bed, surrounded by doctors and nurses. I was covered in bandages, and I could barely move. I tried to speak, to ask what had happened, but my throat was too dry.

It wasn't until later that I learned the truth. The school had been shut down, and all of the students had disappeared. There was no sign of Miss Devlin, or any of the other creatures that had once inhabited the classroom.

But I knew the truth. I knew that something evil had taken hold of that classroom, and that I had been lucky to escape with my life. And I knew that the devil, or whatever it was that had taken the form of Miss Devlin, was still out there, waiting for its next victim.

Years have passed since that day, and I still have nightmares about that classroom. I don't know what happened to my classmates, or if they're still out there somewhere, transformed into creatures like the devil. But I do know one thing.

I will never forget the horror that I experienced in that classroom. And I will always be grateful that I was one of the lucky ones to make it out alive.
