KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK  


My eyes shot open, I stared at the door as the entity abandoned my vision. I focused on the door, waiting to see if it was just the thin walls.  


KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK  


I stood, hesitating, then snuck to the door, noticing they’d installed peepholes, I looked through it to see a short woman in a trucker hat that said “FetchQuest™.” She yawned before looking at her phone, then the paper bag in her other hand. Putting her phone back she reached to knock again, but I cracked the door. “What do you want?”  


Her practiced speech echoed through her eyes as she recited, “Hello, I’m here with FetchQuest due to your recent request for a cashout in Hornet. Unfortunately, we didn’t have cash on hand, so I hope you’re fine with being paid in souls.”  


“Huh?”  


She continued, “Sign here to confirm you received your payment.” She had her phone in her hand again, and before I realized, I had the bag in my hand, so I signed. She hit a button, then held the phone out to me again, “Sign here to confirm you were okay with the payment method.” Again, I signed, still in a daze, the nightmare grasping at me.  


“Hold on, how did you fi-”  


“Thank you for whathaveyou, FetchQuest…” she muttered as she walked away, leaving me with an empty bag.  


Shutting the door, I double-checked the bag, finding two glowing shards the size of toothpicks. Dumping them into my hand, I held one of the crystals up to my eye. Staring at it gave me an odd, looming sense of dread, like the entity from my dreams. I blinked a few times, and with an uncomfortable sigh, I pocketed them. Rolling the bag into a ball I tossed it in the trash, muttering curses. Really, it was hard to complain, it wasn’t even my money. I felt bad for the guy who’d wasted his money on me.  


Dropping back on the bed, I closed my eyes, but my mind was too awake. Each time I took a deep breath to relax, it just spurred more random thoughts. Despite my ever-present exhaustion, I sighed, getting back up to slouch on the balcony.  


Staring into the cloudy night, a warm breeze blew past me, drying my lips. I took slow, deliberate breaths, the entity beyond coming in and out of focus as I switched between it and the moon. I wondered if I should see a doctor if it was the onset of schizophrenia, the thought made me shiver. Jesus, I hope not. The thought lingered. I’ll get tested when this is done.  


“Can’t sleep?” Greg asked as he leaned on the railing beside me, lighting a cigarette with a dollar lighter.  


“Eh, I was…”  


“Knocking wake you up?”  


I chuckled, “My bad, I wasn’t expecting the company.”  


He took a short pull, blowing a cloud into the wind, “Nah you’re fine, I was still awake anyway. Bit anxious is all.”  


I looked at him, his gaze was trained on the grassy sand ahead of us, but his eyes went further, “Yeah, I get that. Never really done anything like this before?”  


“Nah.” A cloud spewed from his mouth with the word as he shook his head.  


“Not sure any of this is gonna work?”  


“Nah, well yeah, both of those are pretty accurate. It’s just… you know you read all this stuff, and even if you say you believe it, there’s always some doubt.”  


I nodded and he offered me a cigarette, but I held up my hand, “I’m good. But yeah, I get you, same thing with the church for me growing up. You see all these people so passionate, but all you can think about is the what-ifs that people tell you only sinners think of… I guess that’s not really the same thing though.” A raspy chuckle escaped me as I let my gaze drift.  


He smirked, nodding, “Eh, don’t sell yourself short, not everything can be compared to. Despite that… well you’re not as wrong as you think.”  


We shared a period of silence, a comfortable one. It was when he lit another cigarette that I broke it, “I wanna apologize, I assumed you were gonna scam me outta my money or rob me or something. You were so cryptic I thought you were gonna try something.”  


He chuckled, “Don’t worry about it, I was half convinced you were a tweaker. But I figured it was worth a shot to help you out if I could, y’know?” He stretched, turning back to his room.  


“See you in the morning,” I said, staring back into the great nothing.  


He ground the hardly-smoked nail into the concrete, “Yeah, goodnight.”  


I stood there, crickets came and went, the odd bat flew by, and eventually, a yawn took me into an exhausted sigh. I smiled up at the now clear moon as the hue of early dawn lit the far reaches of the horizon. “Guess we all gotta sleep sometime.” I headed to my room, passing out on impact with the bed. It was the first in a succession of dreamless nights, one that still follows me. But to be honest, I don’t mind it much.  


\------------------------------------  


We shuttled ourselves separately, taking our respective vehicles to the park. He was following close behind as the sun set again. We’d both overslept and now there was an inexplicable chill in the air, defying the heat of the previous night. Even through the heat vent blowing at my face, I could smell the snow in the distance.  


Pulling into the park my old friends were last seen, I took a deep breath, flicked the car off, and hopped out. The moisture in the air accumulated on the ground, leaving the freshly cut grass frozen enough to crunch under my feet like dry leaves.  


Greg hurried to my side as my legs wandered of their own accord. I looked around the rust-free playground. Glancing at the clouded moon, Greg spoke, “If you know where exactly it was, that might help?”  


“Good one,” wisps of a cloud escaped from my nose. “I assume it was the around the tree line. Even if it isn’t here anymore. That work?” I stopped, looking at him.  


He spun, noting the new suburban homes around us, several oaks still marked the back where a tiny forest had been just a few decades before. “Yeah, a place is a place, shouldn’t matter if it looks different.”  


“Alright.” I continued, heading to the furthest tree. Rubbing the bark, my eyes stung as my doubt plateaued. Should I just head back?  


“You ever astral project?”  


Looking around, Greg sat beside me. I followed his example as I responded, “I… not intentionally.”  


He inhaled, holding his breath, then releasing it over time. “Take deep breaths with me and close your eyes, shouldn’t be too difficult to induce it here. When you feel your mind releasing from your body, let it drift, don’t do anything or you’ll snap back like a rubber band.”  


“Breath with you and relax, got it.”  


“Don’t focus on releasing tension, seriously. We’ll have to keep trying till you get it right.” He asserted, no room for disagreement.  


I looked at him, then straight ahead, closing my eyes, “Whenever you’re ready.”  


Nodding, Greg closed his eyes. As he took in the cold, damp air, I joined. On the exhale, my mind lifted from my brain, and I never stopped breathing out, but I wasn’t holding my breath, or breathing in; I just was as the lightheaded sensation left me. My eyes opened, but my physical eyes were closed. The grounds between the minds-eye and real eyes were what had opened, and everything had a slightly blue tint. The world was wrong, the trees glowed, the grass glowed, the metal poles nearby simply absorbed the light around it as if conducting the light back into the earth. As I looked up at the night sky, the moon was damp, despite the lack of clouds. Even with everything wrong around me, all my mind could focus on at that moment was that the entity in my vision was gone.  


“Greg?” My voice jittered like cups and string, and I looked around, seeing Greg still sitting at the tree, a bluish energy stretching from his body as if glued on. Beside him, my body, reflecting light, but aside from two specks like glowsticks in my pocket, my body wasn’t producing any light. “The fuck?” I squatted next to myself, “Weird stuff, guess the books weren’t lying.”  


“Someone there?” A familiar yet stringy voice rippled to my ears and I jerked my head back. Standing, the world was different, the trees from my childhood had returned. The suburbs returning to the small town I was familiar with. My brain throbbed like an anemic mind after standing too fast. As my brain processed the two different scenes, it hit a traffic jam, before resting on the old scenery.  


“How long you been waiting?” A voice clearer than mine came from behind me.  


I turned to see Greg’s essence standing and stretching. His body seemed to off-put more light than myself or the trees but was also a darker shade of blue. “Not too long, did you hear the voice?”  


He craned his neck, “Nah, just got here, kinda surprised you showed up before me.”  


“It’s the site of my missing friends.”  


“Yeah, that’s true, guess I shouldn’t feel too bad for myself.” He shot out a dry laugh, then looked into the row of houses in front of us. “Thought this was a small town, looks like the onset of the suburbs.”  


“Looking back on it, they’d probably planned it like that from the beginning. But when my family moved in, it was just this row and then a set of shops and stuff in town.”  


“Gotcha, you headed into the forest then?”  


I turned back to him, “Pretty sure I heard someone coming down the street a ways. Think I’ll check it out first.”  


“For sure, I’ll stay here, keep an eye on our bodies so we don’t get possessed or anything.”  


I remembered the odd mention of possessions in a book or two, but it was only ever in passing, “You don’t think there’s gonna be random souls around do you?”  


“If I had to guess, it probably depends on how many people died around this time. Can’t be sure but better safe than sorry. Don’t worry, I’ll keep watch on our bodies, if anything happens I’ll scream or something. Just bring your friends back here and I’ll take care of the rest.” He smiled, I smiled back, before booking it into town.  


Building after building passed me by, each one in the wrong spot, most didn’t exist, not in the real world. I ran straight ahead, the road curving and turning for me. The road was awkwardly long, stretched, and curvy like someone wrapped the original road around a pole. Some houses couldn’t exist with physics. I shifted to a sprint as I stared at the endless path, keeping an eye out for the house I’d seen them in before, back when I ended up on that train that sent me on a journey through that strange place. The place where road signs meant nothing, where space was as malleable as wet corn starch. I would find them again, it couldn’t have been a coincidence that I found them. Not in that tangled ball of spacetime where three days and five minutes were interchangeable. Coincidence was an illusion there, and there was here, and then, and now.  


A dry, hissy gurgle vibrated the sky, bringing a feverish distortion to my surroundings. The buildings were smears beside me, my central vision was wobbly like a heat haze. Each step brought a new cold to my limbs, and I found myself slowing to a walk. Staring straight ahead, the endless ended, and there, a six-story house jostled dead ahead in the everwhen. Each floor was tacked on top of one another like Lego bricks, some lining up, others sitting halfway off the one under it.  


Looking down, my leg jittered, flickering in and out like a spotty connection. I stepped, and I was in front of the door. Behind me, the stretch of road and buildings were streaks, like a spider under a boot, I couldn’t discern them from one another.  


Turning back to the door, I knocked and the ground groaned. Behind me, a shrieking sounded from the sky like a firework, shrill, with a bang. I couldn’t turn around as the shrieks continued, closer and closer. One sounded right after another and another, the ground quaked. My body refused to turn, I could only move one way, and as the shrieking bangs whispered in my ear, I stepped through the closed door.  


My vision returned to a regular blue tint, and everything was silent again. The pans hung still in the kitchen, a round staircase stood in the middle of the room, an end table with a lamp sitting in the center of it. To the right, an open living room. There were no windows, no other doors, just the staircase. Approaching it, I opened the end table, five spindly, spider-like, red flowers sat inside untouched. I reached out to pick one up, my fingers warping as if under water. The closer my hand got to the flower, the further my fingers appeared. Five feet, ten feet, twenty.  


“Henry?” A voice tugged at my neurons like cobwebs, jerking my head up involuntarily. I slammed the drawer shut, sprinting up the stairs. I climbed floor after floor, running against an escalator. Looking at the stairs below, they weren’t moving, but I was. After 10 floors, I stopped, staring ahead at the empty room of the second story. I turned around, and a woman slammed into me, gripping me in a tight embrace. Before I could scream, a stinging cold like dry ice pressed against my shoulder, the sizzling accompanied a horrified crying.  


“Henry, it’s been so long.” It wasn’t the man I’d heard before, but it was still vaguely familiar. If the other voice tangled like spider webs, this one stroked like a thought at the tip of your tongue. It came in subtle rubs until my brain connected the matured voice to another from long ago.  


“Emma?” A chuckle interrupted her crying.  


“God you’ve changed, it’s nice to see you.” She stopped, then pulled away, gripping my shoulders. Her white hair and fare skin reminded me why she always needed an umbrella and sun screen when she went out. “No… I’m sorry, I didn’t mean… I’m sorry you died…” A blush would’ve lit up her whole face, but instead all I saw was the blue tint around her as she looked away.  


“No, don’t be sorry, I’m not dead.” She turned back to me, head tilted, “I came to bring you guys back, where’s everyone else?”  


“What do you mean ‘bring us back?’ Do you know how?” She turned away again, grimacing.  


“Everyone else, where are they?”  


“They should be upstairs, we haven’t talked since the last shift. But how are you going to bring us back?”  


“Do you wanna just wait here then? I can get them and we can head down.”  


“How are you going to do it though, do you have bodies for us or something? Did you kill just for us?” A tear streaked down her face, leaving a black trail.  


I rolled my tongue around my mouth, thinking over what she’d said, “I-I don’t know, or no. I’m not a murderer, I just have someone helping me out.”  


“So there’s two of you?” She turned back to me, her eyebrows nearly meeting as she stared with a mother's concern.  


“Yeah, but he’s pretty smart, we should be fine with him.”  


She stared hard at my face as we sat there, “And you think he can help all of us.”  


I stood, “Yeah, of course.”  


“Okay,” she stood, “Sounds good.” A smirk split her chin from the rest of her face, “Konnor, Tyler, can you come down?”  


“What about Olive?” She didn’t answer as two of my childhood friends sauntered down to our floor. Their faces were blurry, the only defining factor was their hair, Konnor’s blonde, Tyler’s brown. Looking at Emma, her face was also a smear, but I could still make out the line across the bottom half of her face. Each of them looked at a spot near me, but none of them at my face.  


“We’ll bring a couple back for you and Olive.” A nearly unintelligible voice sounded from Konnor.  


“I’m sure she’ll be as excited as I am.” Emma took my shoulders, shoving me to the floor, and pinning my arms and legs to the ground. She spouted on, each second her voice losing more meaning; eventually becoming nothing but a dry crackle, like a distant radio station, too far away to be anything but noise.  


I flickered, and my eyes fluttered of their own accord. I tried to push against her, but the harder I tried, the more she sapped me. I shoved against her again and again, but she just glowed brighter the harder I shoved. Sagging, I tried to recuperate, forcing my eyes open, I glanced my surroundings. Nothing. I took a deep mental breath, searching for anything that could get me out, anything I’d missed, any openings.  


The door. How did I phase through the door? What caused it?  


Another flicker and my mind gave way, locking thoughts down to a narrow road, perpetually shrinking.  


I didn’t think.  


Another mental breath, and I let go of my mind. As I phased through the floor, I was revitalized. Reaching the ceiling of the floor beneath, my mind stirred and I fell. It didn’t hurt, but I had to reorient myself. Making it to the door, Emma fell down the stairs trying to get to me.

  
“Don’t leave us!” I hesitated, looking back at her. Her face was visible again, tears streaked down her face leaving black trails carved into her, “Please…” she stepped forward, “It’s just so hard…”

  
My eyes stung, but I pushed through the door, sprinting full speed back to the park as tears threatened to break free. My mind imploded, stopping me as something unknowable made itself known to me. The buildings around me were smudges, just like their faces. I turned to stare back at the six-story abomination. In the 5th floor, a wispy woman sat, face blurred by distance, she waved to me. “Olive.” I rasped, a piece of myself drifting back to the building. Steadfast, I turned back, letting the tears flow as I sped to the park.  


Time ran past me like the town, and soon, I saw Greg in the distance, “MY FRIENDS!” I didn’t see anyone else nearby, they must’ve been hiding, waiting for a moment to take him by surprise. I looked around for Konnor and Tyler, but there was no trace. No tracks were ever left behind in the gap.  


“What was that!?” Greg yelled back to me.  


I finished my way to the park, “Have you seen anyone?” A gurgle like an empty stomach rang out, vibrating our very souls. We flickered in and out of existence, and my brain was overloaded with danger.  


“Nah, maybe they took a wrong turn or something?” He darted his eyes nervously, “We oughtta get out of here though, whatever that sound is…”  


I picked up the slack, “Yeah… It’s gotta be something fucked.”  


“We can come back for them later right?”  


I paused, looking back at the still visible building, “Fuck ‘em.” As I turned back, I stopped, unsure why, but soon the awareness of pain grew through my chest. As I stared Greg in the eyes, they flickered along with a bittersweet smirk.  


“I’m sorry man, he needed a body to come back.” I collapsed to the ground as he pulled the crystalline dagger away. “You seem like a good guy, and I hate to do this after getting to know you, but…”  


I sank, curling up and gripping my heart as the hyperdimensional entity carved its existence into the sky. My head fell to the ground, and I found it wasn’t in the sky, but in my pupils. The creature’s blinding significance left me unable to see anything else. My vision warped through every color on the spectrum, leaving splotches of previous colors like afterimages from the sun.  


“I’ve known him for so long, can’t just have your partner go and leave you.” There was a rustle, then a whisper in my ear, “I didn’t want to kill your friends, but they would’ve done the same to me.”  


Then, no senses but sight. I stared at the entity that pierced its way through my eyelids. Its ominous hand reached for me as if to take what remained. I let go of myself as another rumble resounded through my soul. I laid there, my body weakening, and then, accepting the inevitable, I reached out my empty hand.  


\-------------------------------------  


I spent eternities, yet seconds in a vast expanse of nonexistence. Like a spaceship in a supervoid, there was only me, no possibility for communication, no chance for salvation. Only, I did have salvation, the entity that had taken to imprinting itself upon me, he had brought me salvation, a new chance for survival. Everything comes with a cost, but the great thing about gods is that they only require praise.  


When I woke, I was standing on a river bed, rocks under my bare feet. A warm, sandy, algae-ridden, breeze blew past me. Gnats bit at my legs, and the sun beat down on me in waves as tiny clouds flew past it. As I looked down, the croaking of frogs peaked its way into the sound of running water.  


In front of me were four, spider-like, red flowers, the same ones from the end table. I picked the first one up holding it up to the sun to get a better look. Strands stuck out past the petals like thread, little bulbs atop them. Staring ahead, I saw four figures, two women, two men. The river flowed past me in all directions, and I stepped toward it, setting the red flower in the water, leaving it to take its own route down the river.  


One by one I set each of the flowers in the river, and each floated off in its own direction and speed. As I placed the last flower, the compulsion left me, and I looked up. All of them were gone, nothing but fog on the other side of the river. I sat there for a while, trying to cry, I wanted to so bad, my eyes stung, but nothing came out.  


Eventually, exhaustion overtook me and I fell to my back, screaming at the empty sky as I laid there. I carried on for a time until a speck came into view. I squinted, and the speck became a blot, then a flower, it landed on my chest, purple, half the petals sticking up, half down. As I held it up, my eyes fluttered.  


The scenery was different, I was staring at a ceiling. I looked around, and I was lying on my couch, my kitchenette sitting with the light on. Books were strewn about my coffee table and floor. I stood, my legs wavering before giving out. Falling back on my ass, something stabbed me. Leaning over, I pulled something from my back pocket. The “something” in question was the two crystal toothpicks, but they weren’t glowing. “The fuck?” Holding them up to the light, they shimmered as I stared through them. They hit the ground as I grabbed my eye two-handed. The pain passed quickly until a similar pain rippled my chest.  


Ripping off my shirt, I paused. There, sat in the center of my chest was a frostbite-like splotch the width of a knife. 

&#x200B;

My head fell to the cushion behind me as the memory of Greg shot me through the head. Soon followed by the man who’d stolen my body.  


The fuck is that guy gonna do with my face?
