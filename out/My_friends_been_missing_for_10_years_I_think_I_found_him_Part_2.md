[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1e5lyja/my_friends_been_missing_for_10_years_i_think_i/)

When you’re younger, memories are like turbulent water that either bubble to the surface, or are lost in the churn of new experiences. With the flooding of new information up on that Mountain top, I quickly ascertained some strange qualities of the entire range.

Specifically, I recall me and my father took a trip up to a peak only 5 or so miles away from\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*. I know, I’m stupid for not remembering. It was just one of those things that don’t fit in the context of a child. Distance is indiscernible to a child. 

It was just an ethereal meadow and steep climb to the “pioneers cabin.” 

(Still going to defend my forgetfulness) The drive from the two places is close to a couple hours. But on the actual map, their location is eerily close in proximity. 

I called my Dad to make sure I was remembering right. He was quiet for some time. My usually bubbly and talkative dad brought a solemn soundlessness. 



“Why are you asking me about it?” He had asked. 

“I was thinking about the man at the cabin.” 

Again some quiet in between us.

“Ah…you remember him then.” 

“In parts.” In truth I didn’t. It only hit me with his next line. The memory.

He sighed shakily, “Do you remember him speaking?”

I hesitated. 

“Yes.” 

“Don’t go up there again son.” He gave his usual i love you’s and then quickly ended the call. The strangeness of his tone set my nerves on edge. The memory replay’s even as I type this. 

  
  


The day was really great. I mean really great. My Dad was a nerdy techy who got bored of the city. That’s why we had moved up to the Northwest. He was tired of the arid desert areas of New Mexico. He wanted some Mountains. He wanted something new. 

My dads still a techy. He codes, and makes the money. Never really been the biggest hunter, thankfully his new friends didn’t mind taking me up with them. Hiking, camping, and fishing was more his beat in his free time. He taught me how to tie a fisherman's knot. How to set up a fire, and how to navigate. 



“Always look behind when walking an unfamiliar path. So on the way back it will make as much sense as going up.” 

I still live by his words. 



I must’ve been at least 9 years old. We had planned the little camping trip for two weeks. We’d never been up the pioneer path. It felt like I was the one lacking enthusiasm with how ecstatic my Father was. 

We started out early, stopping by the gas station. He smiled. He adjusted his thin frame glasses and rubbed his short brown hair. 



“Well Mr. Lewisman, would you care to get a pizza pocket before the drive?” 



“Yes sir yes sir.” I kicked my little feet and jumped from the back seat. My sketchers lit up as I made contact with the concrete. My Father walked up to the door and held it open as I excitedly launched myself into the place. Immediately I found myself at the deli. An older woman with hoop earrings stared down at me. 



“You gonna pay for it?” she smiled.

“No-”

“Yes he is.” My Dad said. I reached into my pockets, and my father turned his back and whistled out loud. His hand outstretched behind him with a 10 dollar bill. I ripped it from his hand so fast, you’d think he owed me the money. 

“One pizza pocket yes and please.” I stated. The woman rolled her eyes, the smell of cigarettes wafting its way down to me. 

She went over to the counter and rung it up. 

“30 dollars.” she said. My heart sank and sweat soaked into the 10 dollar bill. I was had. It was a ruse. The money would not buy my way into pizza pocket heaven. 



“I- uh- um sorry, I-”

“I’m joking honey, give me the 10.” 



I shakily handed it off, and my Dad slapped me on the back. My chest again swelled with child-like pride over my ‘hard earned money.’



“$4.74 is your change.” I grabbed it saying my thanks as I quickly ran to the door. My Dad almost beat me there. I looked out at the pumps and saw a bunch of beat up old trucks. Blue, grey, red, black. 



We were on our way to the trip of a lifetime. We shook along the old highway that led to that sunny valley. Yellow Lines waved off by time and the assault of ominous rays. Trees pressed closer and closer tightening our path to the entrance.

Dad filled the air with chatter. Talking about how at work he had debugged an entire issue with “global scope” in his software. How new techies don’t know,”How to simplify.” My memory goes out there, for obvious reasons. 

Strange how the little details will stick, but the importance of the beginning leaves me. I don’t remember the lot, or even the sign. But I remember the trees. The trees of autumn. Of orange capturing what was the death of an entire forest. 

Clark would always comment that,”Winter only loses to autumn, because its a pretty death, instead of a quite one.”

Admittedly, it was some teenage angst now that I type it. The trees winded a fence-like path along the mountain. My Dad and I crushed the large oak leaves as we went. Birch made it’s appearance further up. Beautiful white bark with plenty of lovebirds carving their mark in the soft wood. I stumbled my awkward little body up the pathway. Taking care to smell that forest scent. The silence that is the ambient breathing of the world. My pack was much too large for me, and a quarter way up, little old me gave it to my poor father. 

I was looking at my shoes. Yes. That’s what it was. My little light up shoes. The world began to seem like a distant memory. Sensation became nothing but incorporeal chatter outside of my reality. Something in the air had shifted.The feeling that my own tension had been hijacked by an alternate source. I peered to the right set of brush. Scattered birch trees that seemed to be moving ever so slightly to show me the new way up the mountain. It was the right way. I walked. Walked. Walked. 

A heavy hand grabbed my puffy coat. 



“Simon.” My Dad barked. “Don’t go running off the path. I’m serious.” 

I nodded dizzily. 

“You know my rules on these things. Here I’ll tell you more coding stories to take your mind off it.” 



If I couldn’t sleep walk before, I could after that statement. The feeling still crawled along the hairs standing up on my arms. For a moment, I was somewhere else. Thinking back I honestly just thought it was a weird childlike fascination with the forest. Adventurous attitude. But the bias inside the strangeness of recent events has tainted every last memory of that mountain range somber and ominous. 



The trees soon slowly shuffled away, the Mountain bidding itself welcome. Balding peak, reminiscent of \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*. I couldn’t quite make out the cabin right then, but it motivated me to climb. 

Dad could hardly keep up. Well to be fair to him, he was packing my stuff as well. I trudged up the mountain with no regard for my beleaguered pack mule. My little shoes sparkling in my sprint. 

God it’s making me wince. Light up sketchers on a camping trip. Maybe I’ve got to remember to give 9 year old me the benefit of the doubt. Never liked kids, it’s a topic of hot debate with my girlfriend. 

We had finally arrived there. That cabin. An empty field lay behind it, rising into a great tidal wave of grass. Below, awash with the forest crashing against the proverbial shore. That cabin, the ship.

I ran up to the little wooden steps and barged in. Lucky to find I hadn’t stumbled on some hippies making memories. The Sunset behind me bathed the room in orange light. Dark wood walls, with names and dates scrawled all over them. Two sets of shelving people used for bunking. I jumped, and a spot right in front of the doorway made a sound like it might give way. I was suddenly a little less enthused. 

Dad finally arrived dumping the stuff next to the wall of words. We stared in mute appreciation of the mural.

Giant ones that said “TAY B,” “Josh Wolfis,” and a beautiful sunflower. Okay beauty is in the eye of the beholder. The sunflower painter wasn’t some art major, but it was nice. My eyes traced over the outer edges as if redrawing the thing in my mind's eye. Until, it was here now. In the part of your brain that recalls the things you will see again when you die. 

Night set in, and my Dad pulled a lamp from his over packed bag. He pinched his shirt and cleaned his rectangular glasses off. He put the lamp down and we laughed about how long it took us to get there. 



“You know, your Mom and I have been thinking about moving back down to New Mexic-”

“NO NO NO-” He put a hand up to silence me, a smirk playing on his face. 

“I’m just joking. So you like it here…truly?” 

“Ya, I love fishing and hunting and running and hiking and camping and-”

Hand up again. 

“So what’s going on at school bud?” 



That brought an air of silence to my chatty 9 year old self. A ball of shame climbed its way to my throat and sat there. Until middle school I hadn’t made a single friend. Kids could sense the nature of my presence. It was a thing that enjoyed solitude and observation. They allowed me to do both. I wasn’t great at the talking thing. I enjoyed being silent with people I liked, not something children are accustomed to. (Not even sure adults can handle healthy silence).

Nobody acknowledged my existence. I almost wished someone would pick on me. Just so I could’ve had an excuse to talk to someone in my grade. I learned an adult emotion, at a juvenile age. 

Apathy. 



“The kids are no fun here. That’s why I like the woods.” I said. My hand retrieving a pocket knife from my bag. A most prized possession. A curvy silver handle with a fat drop point blade. A hunting knife. 



I waddled over to the wall as Dad continued his questioning.

“Why are they no fun.” 

*Because they won’t sit next to me*, I thought. 

“Cause they're all doing kid stuff.” 

“Kid stuff?”

“Ya, like they play with legos. I go on cool hikes.” 

“I know plenty of the other kids go out with their Dads, fishing and stuff. What’s really going on Simon?” 

I started carving my name into the wall. 



*S-i-m*

“They’re…”



*O-n*

*“*Just a bunch of-*”* 



*L-e-w-i-s-m-a-n*

“Assholes.” I finished. I turned and realized what I had said. My face turned red and burning heat came over me. My dad gave me a knowing look. 

A small smile touched his face, "don't say that again. Also, don’t tell your Mother I let you get away with that out here.” 



I grinned. 



“What happens at the cabin stays at the cabin.” He stated. 



We began our dinner. A little propane stove he used to make us some grilled cheese. I sat patiently waiting for the gourmet delicacy to cook. 



That's when the knock came. 



I looked at my father in search of a reason to be afraid. A look like a deer when it hears a twig snap, tore its way across my Dad’s face.

My Dad put his hand on his waistband where his knife was. He wasn’t a big fan of guns. Unless they were used for hunting, he didn’t bring them. 

He walked up to the door, and cracked it. There were some murmurs at the door. My Dad chuckled and let the door swing open. A man stood in the darkness of the outdoors. Some kind of vest on, strings hanging out of the pockets. A round hat that covered his face. It smelled like lake water the minute that door opened. 



“Ah, so you’re down by the river then?” 

“Mmm, I was wondering if anyone was staying up here.” 

“Just my son and I, sorry to say the cabins taken.”

“That right?”

My Dad’s back tensed a little bit. The man glanced over at me. 

He must’ve yelled because of how close it sounded,”Remember the music boy.”

I just cocked my head and stared. My Dad’s voice raised. 

“What are you doing? Get out of the doorway.” 

The man just stared past his shoulder without acknowledging him anymore.

“Stop staring at my fucking kid.” My Dad put his arm up in front of him. I was entranced in something I can no longer remember. 

“Say something you fucking creep.” My Dad said pressing the man through the gap in the doorway.

“But Dad, he did say something.” I said, cocking my head.

My dad’s head turned to look at me. The way I can describe his expression was pure unadulterated fear. Like he was suddenly looking at me through a distorted lens. 



“You guys got a nice little honda. Roads will be slick after the storm, wait till sunlight.” He said more muffled. 



Dad said something quietly, but it was stern and had a hint of rage to it. The man waved a big calloused hand and plodded back down the steps. The minute he stepped down those wooden things, it was as though his walk turned into air. Silence. My Dad stared at the lamp. He began to pack when we heard the thunder. The sky was threatening to crack open. My Fathers face winced, color gone from it. He gripped his hair as if he were trying to keep his skull in place. 



“Fuck…” 

“Dad…”

“Be quiet…” He said simply.



I leaned back against the ground. I looked at the wall and saw a single word carved into the wall. One I didn’t think was there before. 



“Puha \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*” 



This shakes me deeply now. Why did those words not occur to me before? The second was obviously the Mountain we took the trip on. But “puha” is still kind of strange to me. I am familiar with a thistle sometimes referred to as that. I looked it up and possibly it has some like hawaiian dictionary stuff? I’m honestly lost, let me know if you guys know anything please. 

The rest of that night was mostly my Dad standing at any noise around the cabin. I slept just fine through the storm. When I woke up, I couldn’t say the same about Dad. His techy face was etched in stone and he looked more like an Idaho father than I’d ever seen him look. 

“Let’s go.” Was all he said. 

I looked towards my items that had been scattered, already packed into my bag haphazardly. He grabbed my hand and before my legs were awake we were trudging down the muddy field. It really had been a bad storm that night. 

He was determined to get us down quickly. I suddenly felt as though we were being hunted by something. My father pulled me close to him and looked in every direction with a discerning eye. Even me. 

Halfway down Dad found signs of footprints. Fresh human footprints. But no one had passed us. His hand gripped that sheath at his side. I didn’t dare speak a word to him. 

“Hurry up Simon. We’re going home.” Sounded more like he was trying to convince himself. 

We moved our way farther and farther down. Sliding and falling until the car lot came into view. I saw my dad’s eyes soften a little. I came over to the backseat. Before Dad had unlocked the vehicle I pulled the backdoor open. He didn’t notice as he flung himself into the drivers seat. My seat was wet. But the windows were rolled up. I knew he would kill me if he thought I left the window open so I didn’t say anything. Just put my coat down in my seat and sat down. He started up the car and tore out of there. 

He apologized on the way back but his eyes held a hint of apprehension towards me. Like he’d seen his son differently. 

He’s kept that all these years. That’s why I feel strange about it. Just that little pane of glass between a father and a son. 

I’m sorry about that little story I remembered but it’s been turning in my head since my little trip up Hyndman. Theories have been forming. The possibility that a creep lived up in that mountain range seems more plausible now. Multiple even with how many footprints were up there. The fact he had….possibly stayed in our fucking vehicle makes me think that he only lives out in that cabin. Sleeping in whatever he can find when it’s occupied. Which made me consider, what if thats where Clark is buried? Up by that cabin? 

That would mean I’m accepting it wasn’t really him up on that Mountain. But that is hard to accept. It’s beyond hard to. Obviously however, what it was meant me harm. But Clark wouldn’t mean me any harm. It doesn’t make any sense. One thing is clear now that I think about it. 

The sensation of that man in the doorway asking me that question. Feels exactly how the thing on the mountain speaking sounded. “You know me.” I know them?

These are all just loose threads I’m trying to piece together here. I’m planning on going back to Pioneers cabin very soon. I also wanted to thank WolfDKody. He brought up that the truck I had seen going up the day Clark disappeared, could’ve been the same one I saw a couple months ago. I want to reiterate that it's a little too difficult to tell. But now I’ll be on the lookout for a red beat up chevy. Thank you guys, I appreciate it. I’ll let you all know what happens up at Pioneers cabin. I’ve been busy trying to work in between these little excursions. I just got back from a guiding expedition with some wildlife photographers. 

That’s a story for another day. Anyways, I’ve been distancing myself from Stacy lately. That’s my girlfriend by the way, not my real name obviously. This has led to a rift between us that at first was uncomfortable. Something I tried to mend, but now, I see it’s given me more time to follow this rabbit hole. The nexus point of all my life, a gravitational pull I can not escape. A whirlpool that will drag me down until I get to the bottom of it. I will know what happened to Clark, even if I have to cut every person off to do it. I’ve come to peace with that. 

One more thing to mention. My door was unlocked when I got home last night. Stacy and I are paranoid people. We don’t leave doors unlocked. 

Never.
