[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1cq87q1/im_a_single_mom_i_never_knew_who_the_donor_was/) I discovered that children of The Donor turn into killers at the age of seven.

[Then](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1d75r44/im_a_single_mom_i_never_knew_who_the_donor_was/) I went on a hunt to find the biological father of my seven-year-old, donor-conceived son.

The next thing I knew, I was "waking up" inside a vast compound in the deserts of Utah, my memory completely wiped, as if I had just emerged from a coma.

"Mary. Mary." I heard a familiar voice call out, as my eyes began to focus, and I saw...

...Ryan McDonald, the very nurse from the fertility clinic where I had undergone artificial insemination years prior, who had warned me about David's... affliction in the first place.

"Ryan?" I asked, surprised to see him, as I slowly remembered where I was. "What are you doing here?"

"Turns out, the father of your child didn't appreciate me meddling in his affairs, and had me kidnapped." He began, referring to Cassius, the biological father of my son, and the leader of the cult we were currently inside. "But don't worry, I escaped."

"I see that." I replied with a smile, as I looked around at the dark passage we were hiding in, before wondering how much time had passed. "How long has it been?"

"Well, the last time I saw you was at David's seventh birthday party. About a year ago. Next month will be his eighth birthday."

"A year ago?" I cried out, as Ryan put his hand over my mouth, in an effort to keep quiet. "How is that possible? The last thing I remember was arriving here, just a few days after seeing you."

"Well from the looks of the other "mothers," as they seem to call them, I'd say there's some sort of hypnosis going on. Luckily, when I found you, you seemed to snap out of it."

And that's when I remembered...

"David!" I cried out, "Where's David?"

"Shh, Shh," He whispered, "He's okay. Well, as okay as a possessed child can be. He's just... in the pen. With the other children."

*The pen. That's right.* I thought to myself, as I remembered where I'd last seen David, after witnessing one of the mothers getting sacrificed to the other ravenous children, as a ritualistic sacrifice to Cassius' catatonic father.

"The "grandfather"! We need to kill Cassius' father!" I called out, realizing that the children, Cassius, everything seemed to be stemming from him.

"Whoa, whoa. We don't need to do anything." Ryan replied. "You need to lay low, while yes, I'm going after the "grandfather.""

"But-"

"Mary, listen to me. You have a cover. Cassius doesn't know you're out of the trance. Just go about your day, same as the other "mothers" until I put an end to this, once and for all."

—

Despite my better judgment, I did as Ryan had suggested, returning to the great hall in my white gown, and following in the footsteps of the hundred or so other "mothers," as they all gathered in the center of the room and began chanting.

That is, until the thin man with the hunchback stopped me, and asked. "Where do you think you're going?"

Not sure of what to say, and assuming my cover had been blown, I simply remained quiet.

"Over there!" The man said, as he pointed to one of two empty thrones that stood before the great hall.

I nodded, before heading off to the front of the hall, where I took a seat in one of the thrones.

Suddenly, all of the "mothers" stopped chanting, and the room went silent.

That's when Cassisus emerged from an adjacent hallway, followed by two mothers, who were wheeling out his decrepit father.

"Mothers. Today is a special day!" The bearded father of my son decreed. "Today, none of you will be chosen! None of you will be sacrificed."

A mumbling rang out through the hall, before Cassisus continued.

"No, today, we have a special guest. A traitor in our midst. Who will be sacrificed instead."

That's when Cassius turned to me, and smiled.

Suddenly, I was chilled to the core, as I realized that he must have been on to me, and that I... would soon be sacrificed to a pack of feral children, that included my own son.

But I was very wrong.

"Bring him out!" Cassius called out, before the thin, hunched man came barreling out of an adjacent hallway, shoving none other than a restrained Ryan McDonald into the great hall.

"Mothers! This man sought to destroy everything we have worked so hard to achieve here. And worst of all, we found him sneaking into "Grandfather"'s chamber, with this!" Cassius yelled, as he held up one of his own ceremonial daggers. "Bring him to the pit!"

—

A few minutes later, we had returned to the last place I had visited before I had lost my memory, the ledge that dropped into a large pit, filled with countless rabid children, all growling and drooling for a taste of flesh, including my own son.

Once again, Cassius set his father's wheelchair aside, and, along with the tall, thin man, this time led Ryan to the edge of the pit.

"For father." He said to Ryan, making a strange symbol with his finger, ready to push him into the pit, before...

...I suddenly called out, "Stop!"

Suddenly, Cassius whipped around, and shot me a disgusted scowl. "You dare interrupt me, woman!"

That's when he started to approach me, slowly and ominously, as he continued to taunt me.

"You will end up in the pit next, with your wretched child, bride!"

*Bride?* I wondered. I had no idea what he was talking about, but I suddenly found myself returning to the horrific marriage I worked so hard to move past, frozen in place by his taunts, as he got closer and closer and closer.

But before Cassius could lay a finger on me, a puzzled look suddenly washed over his face, as he looked down.

There, protruding from his chest, was the very sacrificial blade, he had just held up in the great hall minutes earlier, now lunged through his body.

He dropped to his knees, coughing up blood, as Ryan removed the dagger.

That's when the thin man charged at Ryan, and I seized the opportunity to grab the "grandfather"'s wheelchair, and push him off the ledge, and into the sea of feral children.

And as they began to ravenously tear him apart, limb from limb, flesh from bone, I looked out into the group of children, and wished not to see David. That's when, out of nowhere, I spotted him, howling and screaming, as he pushed his way closer, and closer, and closer to the old man's body.

"David, noooo!" I cried out.

But just before he could get his hands on the bloody body, all of the children, including David, suddenly stopped what they were doing, and snapped out of it, seemingly returning to normal, and backing away from the body, in horror.

That's when Ryan put his hand on my shoulder and said. "Let's get these kids out of here."

Reconciling what had happened was... challenging, to say the least.

For starters, the authorities never believed our story, and did everything they could to cover up what had happened, whether to save face, or save themselves the paperwork, dispersing all of the children, whose memories were permanently wiped, to orphanages around the country.

As for David. David returned to a normal life. Having never actually gone through with or succeeded in his violent impulses, his innocence... had somehow been saved. Even if his memory had not, and new memories had to be rebuilt.

Memories like, welcoming a brand new member of the family, his newborn baby sister Dana, into his life on his ninth birthday, after Ryan and I had gotten married and conceived a child together.

And if inquiring minds must know, you better believe, that there was no fucking way, that we were ever going to use a donor this time around.
