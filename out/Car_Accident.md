 A daughter and her father were driving through a desolate wasteland. They were returning home after visiting the little girl's mother in the hospital. The girl was about to fall asleep slowly, listening to the sound of the pouring rain falling on the top of the car. 

Suddenly a loud noise was heard. The man couldn't control the steering wheel and the car skidded into a stone wall. Her father, who saw that his daughter was not injured, got out of the car to determine the damage. 

There were large holes in both front wheels and the right bumper was warped by the impact of the wall. "We must have run over something on the way. Whatever it was, it blew both of our tires off," the man told his daughter. “But you can fix it, right?” the girl asked. 

“No,” the father replied. "There's only one spare in the trunk. I have to go back - back to town to find someone to tow the car. It's not far. Wait for me in the car until I get back."

"Okay," the girl said reluctantly. "But come soon, okay?

The man could see that he was afraid of his daughter's eyes. "Sit still. I'll be right back."

In the rearview mirror, her daughter watched her father drive away tiredly in the pouring rain.

More than an hour passed, but his father did not return. The girl was starting to get scared. His father should have been back by now.

She saw someone walking towards the car through the side mirror at that moment. At first she thought it was her father, but when she looked carefully, she saw that he was a strange man. He was wearing overalls, and his beard was quite thick. 

He was carrying something large in his left hand, and it swung back and forth as he stepped forward. Something about him had bothered her. The girl was watching him through the back window of the car as the man got closer and closer. In the dim light she saw what the man was holding. 

The man was holding a large and sharp butcher knife. Thinking quickly, the frightened girl locked the front doors of the car. Then she immediately locked the back doors as well. Looking back at the man, she realized that the man had stopped and was staring directly at him. 

Suddenly the man raised his arm and the girl began to scream. In his right hand the man held the head of the girl's father, which had been severed from his body. The girl was screaming nonstop. 

His heart was beating so fast that he was having trouble breathing. The expression in his father's severed head was noticeably meaningless and terrifying. His mouth was open and his eyes were rolled back. 

When the man got to the car, he leaned his head against the window. He looked at her with angry, bloodshot eyes. His hair was messy. His face was covered with deep wounds. For a moment the man stood in the rain, grinning madly. 

Then he reached into his pocket and took out something. He slowly took out what he had taken out. What he pulled out were the girl's father's car keys.
