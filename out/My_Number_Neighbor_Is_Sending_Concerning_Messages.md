This all started a few years ago around 2023 to the beginning of 2024 when late one night as I was getting ready to go to sleep my phone buzzed on my bed side table. As soon as I pick up my phone I see a number I’m not familiar with, or was familiar with. The text read, “Hey! I’m your number neighbor and I figured I might wanna see what my neighbors doing, so how are you tonight?” I was a little shocked considering the fact that I never even thought I’d have one. I shrug it off as nothing and reply back with “Woah I didn’t even know I had a number neighbor.” That was the only chats sent that night so we never exchanged names or any information about eachother. 

Fast forward a few weeks later a text from the same number pops up on my phone saying, “How are you Matt?” Seeing the text have my name in it I was visibly getting tense. “Who is this? How do you know my name?” I reply. “It’s quite rude to act that way towards a friend.” “Keep this up and you won’t like the results you get.” I bite my gums and block the number, hoping it’ll all be over. Little did I know this would only be the beginning. 

It’s the middle of July somewhere around the 12th when I started getting random packages and letters with no return address. The contents of the unexplained mail were strange, ranging from shards of glass, my name written in dried blood, items that remind me of childhood memories, some even being childhood toys that I’d lost years ago. I took the items to the police but without a return address and no fingerprints coming back there’s nothing they could do. I started to install security cameras on every corner of my house. 

After I did this the packages had stopped showing up for a while, than they showed up to my work, my family members houses and even my daughters dorm room wich was hours away at LSU. I thought about the number and what they could’ve meant by “You won’t like the results you get.” Realizing what this meant I immediately unblocked the number and sat for a minute contemplating whether or not to text it. In the midst of my contemplation the number texts me. “Hey Matt, how’d you like the gifts?” “Pretty neat huh?” “Also those security cameras are pretty neat too…” It’d be a shame if they were to be taken down…..” As soon as I read this I heard the cameras being hit by something. It was strange though, cause all four of them were being hit, at the same time. 

I immediately ran to my basement and unlocked my gun safe, grabbing my newly bought Glock-17 and 12gauge, tucking the Glock into my waistband and holding my 12gauge to where I was ready to shoot anything that tried coming at me. I go to open my front door when the sound of broke glass erupts the house. I quickly turn around and see a group of masked men, about 7 of them all in different parts of the house, one in the kitchen, one on the stairs to the second floor, one on the stairs in the basement, two in the living room, another in my room and one right behind me. I raise my shotgun and pull the trigger, *click*, *click*, sweat starts pouring down my face and tears fill my eyes. “No, no no no no no no nonononononononono…” I yell, as the man behind me puts a burlap sack over my fave and sticks a needle in my neck. 

I awoke inside a small shipping container in the middle of who knows where. I’m tied to a kitchen chair, my kitchen chair. My weapons sit against the wall next to the door. One of the men walk into the container with something in his hand it’s too dark for me to see and tears fill my eyes again. The man walks up and he shoves a phone in my face. “You know, maybe if you were a little bit nicer to me we wouldnt be here.” “I’m sorry just please let me go!” I pleaded. The man chuckles to himself and slams the phone against the metal container walls, smashing it to pieces. 

“Do you KNOW WHO THE FUCK I AM?” he screams. “No, just please let me go.” I say with tears filling my lap. “He pulls a gun out from behind his waistband, aims it at me, slowly points it to himself, and pulls the trigger. The sound of the gunshot and the thud of his dead body is enough to wake me up. Realizing it was all a nightmare I get up to get a drink of water and as I enter my room I get a text from an unkown number.
