"Danny!!  Can you come down here!?  Gamma wants to show you something!!"

"Hang on.....I'm coming!"

I stalled as long as I could.  I didn't want to see my grandma.

She hasn't slept since she got home.  My dad sent her to the hospital for a sprained ankle, which led her staying there a little longer for observation.  She's been telling people that she doesn't need sleep, and that her doctor cured her from her ailments and she just needs to be ready for her "king".  She's always been religious, but it's like she got a personal message from God while she was gone.  If this is what biblical times were like, I'm glad I never got to see what they were like.

"Dannyyyyyy!!  Please!!.....Cmere!!"

I tiptoed down the stairs to see what Grandma wanted.  My parents made me her semi caretaker, which I believe is because they didn't want to speak to her.  My dad had been drifting apart from his mom over the last decade, and now he's nervous to be around her for more than ten minutes.  I wish he didn't saddle me with this job.

"Grandma!  Are you okey?!"

"Oh yes!!  Danny-boy.................he's coming!"

"Who's coming?!"

She gave me a sideways grin that made me think of a jack o lantern made of skin.

"Our kiiiiiing!!  Don't you see!!?  Come sit and watch the rise!!"

I was the only one who spoke to this woman, which used to just be awkward.  I would come down, ask her if she felt cold, she would ask me about my life, and I'd go upstairs and pretend she wasn't there.   It began to be scary, and a little nauseating, after began to ask me if I was ready for the judgment.  I figured it was just normal Christian stuff, but the talk was a little odd.  She was more aggressive and would talk about people getting "what's coming to them".  Up until this point, I always humored her, but now, I would make sure she was breathing and hide in the bathroom till I could sneak back upstairs.  I doubt she even noticed when I'd leave.

"Wow......I see!!"

"Ya see, Danny.......There's nothing wrong with forgiveness, but in today's day and age, we have far to much of it.  It's time we stop letting these new age pegans have a place in our society."

I was about to turn upstairs when she spoke again.

"You think I don't know what you've been doing!?  Who you've been associating with and the things you doing?!"

"Grandma!?  What are you talking about?!"

"When you would run off thinking that I'm just an old kook!  Well, I'm not a kook, and I know the real reason you've been outta here in such a hurry.............!!"

I figured I'd have to explain myself so as not to hurt her, but I didn't expect the following events.

"Youve been praying to false gods!!  Influenced......by that pagan, two timing bastard!!!"

"Grandma!  I don't worship any-"

She snapped her head faster than I could see and grimaced at me before I could finish my sentence.

"You follow the lineage of Agamemnon!!  The lies of Plato!!  Jesus's wheel-house.  I guess I can't blame you.  Jesus had me fooled to!!"

"Agamemnon?  Isn't that the ancient Greek king?!"

"Oh!  I'm sure you love those dirty Greeks, but we have a chance to worship our king in a way that could bring forth our eternal salvation, and save us from the false ways of Christ!......and youuuuuuu....................................... wanna fuck it up!!!!!"

Just like that, my grandma swung her cane at my head.  She missed, but the unnatural strength and weight of the cane left a decent sized hole in the wall.  I jumped back as if I'd been swiped by a Tiger with a drinking problem.

"Grandma!!!  What the fuck!!!"

Her response was eerily calm.  Like she had a sick acceptance of her "responsibilities."

"Don't you try to back-track now.  The only way out is to be absolved............by our kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing!!!!!"

I run to the front door but its bolted shut.

"You silly boy.  I made sure all the doors and windows were sealed shut.  Nope.  There will be no going in or out........not without a battering ram."

I sprint to the stairs and stumble up.  I look down to see my grandma, mouth agape, swinging her heavy cane like a lasso.

"Aw.  Cmon Danny-boy.  Ya know what they say......"If you feel like you're going through hell.............Keep going.""

With the speed I would only expect from someone in their prime, I saw my eighty-five-year-old grandma leap on up inches from my face with a grin that would scare a navy seal.  I pushed her and ran the other direction but didn't see the bar at head level.  The last thing I remembered a close up of a metal object, then darkness.

I remember feeling like my body weighed a ton and hearing the voice of a raspy sounding preacher. The preacher sounded like Pat Robertson if he took too much Adderall and quaaludes.  I opened my eyes to find my grandma sitting on a stool two feet from a tv that looked like the one my family had as a kid.  There were many old knick-knacks that I thought my parents threw away.  I was tied up to a kitchen chair forced to watch, not Pat Robertson, but a preacher type person sitting in a white room and not blinking into the camera.

(Preacher:  "Do ya here that?!  That's the sound of your enemies bursting into flames!!")

"Grandma!!  Please let me go!!  I don't worship Agamemnon or whatever!!  I'm still a Christian!!"

"Danny..............I know you're still a Christian.............That's what this is about."

"What do you mean!!??  You said I was pagan!!"

She turned her head slowly, rocking a malicious grin.

"My boy...............Jesus was a pagan psyop.  It was supposed to be Elijah............"

"What!??"

(Preacher:  "And Elijah will come down from his chariot and slaughter all the false prophets and decapitate their believers")

"Jesus was put here lure people away from God's real message......We shouldn't love whores; we should impale them."

Her calm demeanor is what terrified me the most.  Her blank expression, her meticulous planning, and her acceptance of all these negative feelings!

"There will be no more 'Only-whores' to tempt our young men into sin.  Once Elijah projects himself through a leader, he will incite the masses to kill all the fake ones."

(Preacher:  "I have given God's "medicine" to the little 'Jezebels' in my life.  It's not our job to forgive!  Only to enforce!!")

Feeling the rage in her voice, I was frozen.

"You're right grandma!  I'm sorry for freaking out!  I was just shocked that it was happening so soon."

I had to play her game.  There was no telling what other traps she had hidden around here.  I didn't even know if I was still in my house, as this looked like a replica of a home from the 1930s.

"Oh?  You're trying to pull one over on me.  He heeeeee!!  Don't worry my boy..........Just keep watching Father Groschel and you will see!"

(Preacher:  "'Love thy neighbor?!'  You know nothing of what he's been up to!!!  I say "test" thy neighbor!!")

"I'm gonna test you very soon, Danny boy...."

I acted as nonchalant as I could, but I felt like I was having quite panic attack.  How was I supposed to get out while tied up?!  I almost cried,

"Hmmm??"

"Ahh.  This man's a little terrifying."

"You'll learn to love him and his congregation."

She continued watching the program while I felt around.  There was a connected wire next to my hands.  This place must be very shoddy to have random wires accidentally on this chair.  This was my only option.  I worked on untying my hand restraints.

"Grandma!  I think I see it."

"We'll see during your test, my boy."

She didn't even turn around.

I eventually freed my arms, but I had to keep up appearances.

"I don't know grandma...."

"Hush my boy!  and feel thy beauty."

I saw a glass of water that she used to take her medication.  I slowly grabbed it.

"Grandma I'm starting to feel something!"

"Yes!!  Yes!!!  YEEEEEESSSS!!!"

I interrupted her cheer to jam the wire on her neck and pour water on the end.  In the blink of an eye, that greasy unkempt hair shot up and made her look like dr. Frankenstein took meth.

"AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

I kept the wire in place until I felt her knees begin to buckle.

"GAAAA!!!  Ehhhh......My.......My boywfhdhfhkj"

Her body dropped as she spoke.

I had to act quick!  I had no idea how long she was going to be out or if she had hidden more traps down here.  I searched the room trying to find an exit, but there were no doors or windows.  I was pretty sure my grandma didn't have the skills the climb through the ceiling.  She's batshit, not an athlete.  I figured she had a hidden door, so I started knocking on the walls to try and find a hollow spot.

I knocked for thirty minutes, being as meticulous as I could, when I found a week spot.  I couldn't find an opening but figure I would chip at it anyway considering I had no other leads.  I found a piece of an old broom and got to chipping.  If there were a window I could at least know where the old lady put me, but no luck.

I tore at the wall for five minutes, seemingly getting nowhere, and began to feel more space and chipped faster.  I began to have hope, when I felt a searing pain in my left arm that made me drop the broom piece.

"GAAAAAA!!!!"

I rolled to face the torn look of my grandma.  She looked like a bull that got slapped by a clown.

"Grandam!!  Please!!!"

"I was trying to save you......bring you over to the world of Elijah.......

She slowly walked forward as I clutched my arm in pain.  I think she might have broken it.

"You need help!!!!"

"Now God's going to have to save you.........and he's less forgiving than me........trust me......."

This wasn't my grandma!  I'd never seen such bleak determination in her eyes.  I shook as she gritted her teeth.

"It's like Jesus said............. 'Scalp those who do not conform to God's plan!!'"

"Grandma!!! Jesus didn't say that!!!"

"That's why he wasn't fit to lead!!"

With that, my grandma braced herself to lunge at me.  I covered my face and began hyperventilating, hoping for the best, when I heard the sound of wood releasing and scraping against a board, followed by my grandma shrieking that led to a distant thud.

"Mom!!  What's going on!! What were you doing up there?!!"

I heard my dad say.

"Oooooohhhhh!!  My baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!!  Call the doctor!!"

I called with joy.

"Dad!!  Up here!!"

\*\*\*\*\*

My grandma got sent back to the hospital for observation.  Lucky for her, she fell on carpet and the distance wasn't that far enough to do too much damage.  However, she was being sent to an assisted living facility for a while until they found the cause of her religious psychosis.  I had no idea we had an attic.  My parents said they've never seen that room, but I think they just didn't want another fuck up on their list of others this month.  Leaving me with a psycho was enough of a mistake.  My dad said he heard noises and saw the opening that my grandma was standing on.  She had her own room that she tried to make look like her childhood bedroom with a few extra religious insignia.

I couldn't hate my grandma, despite her attempt to kill me.  I just didn't want to see her for a while.  ya
