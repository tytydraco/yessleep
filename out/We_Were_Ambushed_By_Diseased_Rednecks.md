He told me he knew where he was going. Trevor was the kind of guy who was too proud to use a map, too convinced that he remembered the way from last time. Last year, we drove up to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in a grueling process of trial and error. I swore then I’d never let him back behind the wheel, but here we were. Deep in the thick of Alabama, winding down a road in the middle of nowhere. 

“Did we just drive in a circle?” I asked him, feeling a headache coming. My headphones were barely not loud enough to drown out the music he was playing on the radio. 

“No, everything just looks the same out here. Just trees and mud.” 

Trevor was starting to get the feeling that I wasn’t enjoying this trip, and he wasn’t shy in saying so. He’d driven the whole way and our sleep cycles had reversed. He was wide awake while I was fading out and vice versa. 

I didn’t think anything when the truck slowed down. It was about 11:40 at night and we hadn’t seen a gas station in a couple hours. But Trevor didn’t need to go to the bathroom. He didn’t move from his seat. I looked over to him and his knuckles were gripped tight around the wheel. 

“Trev, you good? See a ghost?”

“The road. There’s bottles on the road.”

I looked to meet his eyeline. A row of empty beer bottles crossed the one-lane road.

“I’ve seen stuff like this before,” Trevor said. “You get out, they take the car, rob you.”

“Just turn around,” I told him. “We’re going the wrong way anyway, just loop back to whatever exit we took.”

Trevor nodded and started to back up slowly, mumbling something to himself. He swung the front of the truck around and pressed his foot on the gas.

One of our tires immediately popped, and the truck slid off of the road. We found ourselves angled downwards in a ditch, the back tires lifted up in the air. 

“Dammit!” Trevor shouted. 

We weren’t sure what to do. Trevor kept a small handgun under the driver’s seat, but he’d never had to use it before. He took it out with a flashlight and we both stepped outside. 

“Watch me,” he said, pointing around. The flashlight and our headlights were the only thing illuminating the forest this late. I could see for about twenty feet in every direction before the scene was overtaken by the dark. 

Trevor shined the flashlight on the flat tire. It was lined with nails and screws. He kicked the deflated rubber and cursed silently. 

“There’s a spare in the back, take it out,” he said.

Even if we did manage to change the tire, we were in such an odd position in this ditch that I doubted we could get out. I had just climbed in the back of the truck when what I can only describe as an ungodly howl nearly gave me a heart attack. 

Trevor aimed the gun in the direction of the noise, his flashlight forming a narrow beam of light in a sea of black. 

“What…the hell…was that?” he asked softly. 

I wished it had been a coyote or something along those lines but the sound was distinctly human. Looking back, it reminds me almost comically of the old Tom and Jerry scream. But here, in backwater woods at midnight, it chilled me to the bone. 

“Should we get back in the car?” I asked, at a loss. I had absolutely no idea what to do. “Maybe we could–”

Trevor hushed me quickly. “Listen,” he said. 

We could hear a sort of dragging. The road was gravel and it was clear someone was scraping through it. It was as if they weren’t picking up their feet when they walked. There would be a noise, and then silence for a few seconds, and then a noise again, and so on and so forth. Whoever was out there was taking their time. 

“I’m going to call out to him.”

“Don’t.”

“What’s the difference? He already knows we’re here.” 

The beam of light was shaking and I saw a fear in Trevor’s eyes I hadn’t seen in him before. He raised the gun up in the direction of where he presumed our ambusher to be. 

“HEY!” he yelled. 

The rustling immediately grew faster. 

“I WILL SHOOT YOU.”

The scraping grew into a gallop. 

“STOP!” 

Trevor began to back up, stumbling towards the truck. The flashlight swung wildly. In glimpses, I saw a figure pursuing him, slumped over, dragging his knuckles. 

“Get in the truck,” I said. “Trevor, GET IN THE TRUCK.”

I had already found myself in the passenger seat as Trevor bounded for the driver’s side door. He slid down into the muddy ditch, dropping his flashlight. He quickly got up to his feet and dove into the truck, slamming the door behind him. 

“What is going on?” he asked incredulously. 

The man slammed his head against his window. We could barely see him in the dim light, but his face was immediately bloodied. He wouldn’t stop thrashing against the truck. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. 

Then, the window started to crack. Trevor tried scooting towards me across the console but there was no room. The man outside never tired, never stopped. We could see chunks of flesh flying off with every hit. His face was beginning to cave in. 

Trevor took aim at that point on the man’s face that was once right between his eyes. “Get out,” he said. “Run.”

I jumped out of my side and climbed out of the ditch, watching the truck. A flash of light and a gunshot quieted the incessant crashing. I slowly inched back to the truck, nervously checking to make sure the man was down. 

Trevor sat with the gun on the console and his hands cupped around his ears. Glass was sprinkled everywhere. I tried to speak to him but it took a while for him to hear me. 

The body was left in a disgusting state. The man’s head had already been bashed from his relentless attack, but looking at it now I could see the extent of his deformity. All across his body, head to toe, were lumps and boils. There were parts of him that looked starved and others that were covered in tumors. It was like nothing I had ever seen before. 

“Trevor, come see this.” 

He got out of the truck shakily. I could tell his head was still pounding. His face was already pale, but it got impossibly paler once he saw the corpse in front of him. It took us a while to come up with any sort of statement. We just stood there, staring. 

After a minute, Trevor broke the silence. “What…I mean what’s going on here? Is he a leper?”

I wasn’t any medical expert, but I knew this couldn’t be leprosy. Whatever disease this man had must have been unrecorded, I told myself. I had never even heard of anything in the ballpark of what I was laying my eyes on. 

Trevor spoke again. “You don’t think we’ll catch it, do you? Whatever he’s got.”

I stayed quiet. I didn’t even want to consider it. I wanted to be relieved, but I felt more and more anxious. My eyes squinted in the darkness. 

“There can’t just be one, can there?” I asked. “Where does he come from? There has to be more.”

Neither one of us had any desire to stay and find out. Over the course of the next thirty minutes, Trevor and I worked the truck out of the ditch using a few 2x4 planks in the truck bed as levers. Once we changed the tire, we were ready to go. 

We started back the way we came. I didn’t say a word about what had happened. There was no signal out there, or I would’ve called the police.

“Are you sure you’re good to drive?” I asked Trevor. 

“Yeah, yeah.” He pointed to the backseat. “Could you grab that water?”

A half-finished water bottle rolled around on the floor in the backseat. I leaned over to grab it when the truck hit a bump and I sprung up, my head hitting the roof. I recoiled in pain. And then my heart sank. 

Through the back window, in the pitch black, a pair of glowing eyes was chasing the truck. And whoever they belonged to was keeping up. 

“There’s someone following us,” I said.

Trevor checked the rear view mirror. Wordlessly, he just stepped on the gas. I planted myself back in my seat. The wind ripped through the truck through the open window, and I watched as the road blurred beneath us. 

My head swiveled, checking behind us and looking forward. I could still see him off by a bend in the road. Ahead of us, in the headlights, a pile of roadkill sat in the road. Trevor couldn’t avoid it, and he drove right over what I now know was a deliberately laid trap. The air hissed from the new tire and the truck spun out of control, slamming into a tree trunk. 

“Shit! Shit! Shit!” Trevor banged on the steering wheel. Tears were streaming down his face now. 

We hopped out. A caltrop protruded from our tire, cloaked in the roadkill’s coat. Far off behind us I could hear the running footsteps of the man chasing us. I knew we’d gotten off too easy. I knew there would be more. 

“Run, just run,” Trevor said. 

Before I could say anything, he was already deep in the woods. I followed, seeing his rough outline dash between bushes and thicket. I tried my best to keep up, shaking off thorny plants and branches. It was hard to maintain speed in the sludge, but we managed, survival instinct kicking in. 

Trevor stopped a ways in, once he was satisfied with the distance. I still felt nervous, but we were both out of breath. A little through the trees, we noticed something like an orange glow. Upon further inspection, we found it to be a lone camper.

“I don’t like this place,” said Trevor. “I’m sorry I brought you here.”

“You didn’t know,” I said. I gestured to the camper. “You think there’s someone inside who can help?” My senses wouldn’t allow me to focus on anything but the ambusher we had supposedly evaded. 

“What if it’s more of them?” Trevor asked. 

“Do you still have your gun?”

	

Trevor tried to knock on the door of the camper, but it crumbled. A thick dust emanated from the hole. He shined his flashlight inside, gun in his other hand

“Do you see anything?” I asked. 

“There’s mushrooms everywhere,” he told me, covering his face. 

When I looked in, I found that when he said everywhere, he meant everywhere. There wasn’t a square inch of the camper that wasn’t completely covered in some sort of crust. All across the countertop were a series of moonshine stills, densely smothered in mold. 

Our flashlight and a flickering lamp provided most of the light, but there was a warm glow coming from the mushrooms. Bioluminescent veiny structures ran throughout the room, covering the floor and hanging from the ceiling. 

“There, in the corner,” I said. “Is that what I think it is?”

A body sat on the floor of the trailer, overcome with whatever parasite had rampaged through the area. Its head had been overgrown and its stump neck was ripe with boils and ooze. I couldn’t completely make out the shape of the body as it was nearly entirely deteriorated apart from a vague outline. 

Trevor was slammed into the wall of the camper, falling in. We hadn’t shaken our pursuer like we believed. Somehow, in the dark, it had found us. Smelled us out. In the light, it was clear that this was not a man, even if it was once. Trevor barely managed to keep it off of him, fighting desperately. The thing scratched at him savagely, producing gashes on his arms. 

I kicked it off of him. Trevor rolled for the gun and fired three shots into it. It fell apart just as the other had and fell to the ground.

“I’m dead, I’m dead, I’m dead,” Trevor kept repeating looking at the blood coming from his arms. “Whatever it has, I’ve got it now. We practically inhaled all the air in the camper. We’re dead, oh my God.”

I tried to calm him down but he was hysterical. I grabbed his shoulders and shook him. And then I saw the sum of our fears: sickly protrusions coming from his face, and an abnormal glint to his eyes.

I backed up. 

“What?” he asked me. “What?” 

I never answered him. I sprinted through the woods, not stopping, never stopping. My adrenaline fueled a mad dash to the highway, and as I began to see the first few cars, I heard the sounds of my friend’s monstrous transformation far off in the distance. 

It has been a week since then. I can’t get the image of Trevor out of my mind. Scared, helpless. I couldn’t imagine how terrifying it must have been for him. He had looked at me and I had run for my life. I only hope the metamorphosis is quick. 

I wanted to suppress this whole experience, chalk it up to a few troglodytic rednecks that tried to rob us. But I know it was more than that. There was something dangerous out there, something unheard of. Something that I would like to leave alone and never think of again. 

	

But yesterday my face broke out in hives, and I woke up this morning coughing blood.
