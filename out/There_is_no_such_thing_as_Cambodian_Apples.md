I don’t know where that book came from, I don't remember getting it. 

But that year as I opened our box of Halloween decorations, it was just there, “Aurora?” I called, sighing as I realized it was impossible for my wife to hear me over her music. 

I hesitated for a moment when I picked it up, halfway expecting it to feel like human skin or something like that. Laughing awkwardly to myself, I decided I might have read one too many stupid creepypasta on the internet. 

Carrying the book to the kitchen, I saw my wife dancing while singing along to The Cramps. This year, she had insisted on making something healthy for the kids, and healthy didn’t mean boring. And so she had blown our entire budget for food to purchase all kinds of weird fruits, nuts and vegetables that she had expertly cut into tiny ghosts, fingers, and the like. 

“Aurora?” 

She still didn’t hear me, and so I went and turned off the radio. This prompted her to stop and turn, frowning. “Why the hell did you do that?” she asked sourly. 

“Did you buy this?” I asked, placing the book on the kitchen island. 

Aurora studied it, and I noticed how she too hesitated before picking it up. She turned it in her hands, opened it, and flipped through the pages. “No, I don’t remember this at all,” she shrugged. “Sure you didn’t buy it in some drunken Etsy session?” Aurora laughed and handed the book back.

“I don’t think so,” I mumbled, opening it as well, flipping through the pages. It looked like a prop from a movie, corny and slightly ominous at the same time. I turned the music back on, and Aurora returned to her task of carving pumpkins out of tangerines.

I carried the book back to the living room and tossed it on the sofa. Perhaps it wasn’t important where the fuck it came from, and Aurora was probably right. I might have thought it looked fun after half a bottle of wine, it was the most plausible explanation. 

I totally forgot about the book and just focused on finishing up the living room and front porch decorations.

The music was turned off, and Aurora came into the living room. “You done with the decorating, babe?” she asked.

“Yeah, unless you want me to add you to the collection.” I laughed as I grabbed her, pulling her in for a quick kiss. “They are gonna love your fruits,” I giggled, “all any kid wants on Halloween night is cucumber and berries.” 

“Oh fuck off!” Aurora pushed me while laughing. Her gaze fell on the book I had abandoned on the sofa, “We could prop it up next to the treats on the porch.” 

"Aurora, we want our neighbors to like us. The last thing we need are those soccer moms accusing us of lesbian witchcraft and bring out their torches and pitchforks," I said. Aurora laughed, even if it sounded a little forced. “Yeah, you’re right,” she flipped through the book and then carried it to the kitchen. Out of curiosity, I followed and saw her take a photo of it with her phone. For a moment, I thought she'd post it on social media with some lame tagline, like ‘lesbian witchcraft - we have it’. But to my surprise, her frown deepened as she was completely focused on the phone’s screen. 

“What?” I finally asked, when I couldn’t stand the weird silence any longer.

“I can’t find it anywhere, look.” She turned her phone in my direction and showed me her reverse Google search, which brought up weird crap like Necronomicon props, and the like. But nothing that looked remotely like our book, “Okay that is weird, but it doesn’t mean a thing.” I smiled at her again and took the book from her hand, “How about you bring some of this meal for the gods outside, otherwise we’ll be the ones eating berries and carrots for the rest of the month.” 

Aurora loved Halloween, perhaps because it gave her an excuse to talk to everyone and showcase her ‘always perfect’ creations. But most of all, Aurora loved kids and was good with them. Before we moved, she had been a kindergarten teacher, and right now I guessed she wanted to impress the damn school board, hoping to make her temporary position permanent. And serving expertly crafted healthy snacks was probably the right way to go. What the fuck did I know? Unlike Aurora, I didn’t have a maternal bone in my body, and to be perfectly honest, I avoided children every chance I got. This was why I took the weird book upstairs and sat down at my laptop, determined to find out where the hell it came from. 

I studied every inch of the book, searching for any form of identification, something, anything that could help me search the internet for its origins. I found nothing, and soon settled for looking through my search history and my online bank statements. However, I couldn’t find a single clue anywhere, and after an hour, I leaned back in my chair, satisfied with knowing that at least I had not been the one to procure this ridiculous thing. 

“Honey?” Aurora called from downstairs.

Leaving the book by the computer, I exited the office and came downstairs to Aurora, surprised to find a man I had never seen in my life standing in my living room, next to my wife. “This is Eric,” Aurora said casually, “he overheard me trying to spook the kids with the story about the weird book, and he asked if he could see it.” 

"What?" I looked from the man to my wife, “a word?” I asked politely, following her to the kitchen, leaving the man in the living room. 

“What’s wrong?” Aurora asked innocently, loading another tray with her snacks. 

“Are you completely insane? Inviting some stranger in here because he overheard you talking about whatever?” I argued in a low voice, “You have no idea who the hell he is, Aurora for fucks sake!” 

“We are not in the city anymore,” she shot back, “there’s no need to be paranoid like that, and he’s probably some kids' dad; I can’t remember them all.”  

She pushed past me with her tray, leaving me to walk back to the man in the living room. “I’m sorry,” I said politely, introducing myself. And proceeded to install our mystery guest in the kitchen while I went upstairs to fetch the book. After all, that was why he was here, right? I couldn’t shake the weird feeling that something was off, both with this book and with Eric. Nonetheless, I fetched the book and trekked back down to the kitchen. Eric was exactly where I’d left him. “So when did you and Aurora meet?” I asked, trying to keep it casual, not wanting to fuck up her chances of getting that permanent position should this be someone from the faculty. “Right out there, on your porch,” he said, looking up at me with a wide smile. “But I know that!” He pointed at the book.

“Excuse me?” I stared at him in disbelief.

“My book,” the stranger said, “I know my book.” 

“Your book?” I asked, and for whatever reason I felt like just tossing the damn thing at him and leave it at that.

“My book,” Eric repeated slowly, as if I were a child with learning disabilities. I just stood there on the opposite side of the kitchen island and stared at Eric, was that even his name? Would he leave if I gave him the book? I wanted him to leave, didn’t I? A cold shiver traveled up my spine, as something irrational, unexplainable whispered that I should not give him the book. 

Aurora entered the kitchen again, smiling at us. “Did you solve the mystery?” she asked in a chipper tone, as she picked up the next-to-last tray with snacks. “Not exactly,” I admitted lamely. Eric was ignoring Aurora, and staring directly at me, making me uncomfortable. I was being studied, observed. 

“Why?” Aurora asked, turning to look at me, still holding her tray. 

Eric leaned in over the kitchen island, observing me closer. “I suppose I owe you an explanation, miss. See, the book belonged to my late father, and when I found that his things were delivered to the local second-hand store after his death, I traveled here to see if I could locate some of his belongings. They told me you good people had bought this book some time ago, and so when I heard your lovely wife talk about a mysterious book, I knew I had found the right house.” He smiled a little too wide, “may I please have my father’s book back? Just name your price, miss. I can pay you in cash.” 

There was no doubt in my mind he was lying. Not only had neither Aurora nor me seen a second hand shop in this little town, but had driven to a nearby larger town to tickle our thrifting bone. Ironically, we had talked about this just yesterday, how we should have gone there to look for something new and neat for Halloween. Surely they’d have something vintage and quirky there. But the way he looked at me; hungry and demanding, set me on edge. The two things combined made me tighten my grip around the strange book that I had pegged for a cheap prop, just an hour ago.  I forced a smile, trying to mask the unease that was creeping into my voice. "My condolences, when did your father pass?"

Eric's expression didn't falter, but there was a flicker of something, annoyance, perhaps? That crossed his face. "I understand your hesitation, miss," he said, his voice smooth and unbothered. “Open it, my father’s name is written on the first page.” 

I hesitantly opened the book, while making a mental note of Aurora leaving the kitchen. Inside the book, someone had written a name with a quill, it was faded and hard to read. Why had I not noticed this the first time I looked through this book? Surely I would have looked that name up had I seen it. 

Because it wasn’t there, a small voice whispered in the back of my mind.

Closing the book, I turned my gaze back to Eric, who was sitting waiting. Whatever drove me to gamble like this, I can’t tell you, but I smiled my most charming and said. “My wife is very environmentally conscious, so she makes me go thrift with her every Sunday, a small sacrifice I suppose. But perhaps we have other items that belonged to your father?” I’m pretty sure he could smell my fear from the other side of the kitchen island, because his grin grew feral, and his eyes glinted with something I can’t explain, something born out of pure malice. 

“Let go of the book, or you will regret it.”

“I don’t think so.” I said, wanting to sound sure and calm, but knew it came out like a squeak. Eric’s gaze rooting me to the ground, and to my surprise I saw something in them which resembled mirth. Was this amusing to him? Whatever it took, I had to get rid of this fucking psycho, and I'd have to talk to Aurora later about letting random strangers into our home. I don’t know how long we stayed like this, just staring at each other, and me clutching that damn book. 

It was Aurora’s voice that brought me back to reality. “Did he leave?” she asked confused, placing the empty plate down on the kitchen island. It took me a moment to realize what she’d said. I felt sluggish and weird, like if I had woken from a nap. "Huh?" I mumbled, watching as Aurora shook her head and went for the last plate.  I just stood there stupefied, staring into the empty space which had held Eric just moments ago. I looked down at the book in my hands. It was not until now that I noticed it felt different to hold, like the cover and weight had changed, and for some reason it felt like a prop again. I can’t put my finger on it, but it felt cheap and light. I idly ran my fingers over the cover, trying to remember if it had felt heavier, or softer before… Perhaps warmer? I wasn’t sure, so I opened the book, and right enough there was no name written in blurry ancient ink. Did he hypnotize me, and swap the book when I was under? It would explain how he had left without me noticing. 

Come to think about it, the back door was locked with a key, and the only other way out of the house was through the front door, right past Aurora. How would he have known where to find the key for the back door? Terror hit me like a bolt when I realized perhaps he hadn’t left, perhaps he was still in the house! Aurora was vehemently against guns, and to be honest, I wasn’t a fan of them either, so we never did get one. This was a fact I regretted right at that moment, but the truth was, even with a gun, would I risk searching the house? After all, he had been a fairly big man, so I decided to call the police. I wasn’t going to tell Aurora yet, there was no need to ruin her last moments of Halloween wholesomeness out there on the porch, and besides, the police wouldn’t be here right away. 

I left the book on the kitchen island and went to get my phone from the charger by the window. I was about to dial the police when I noticed something odd out the corner of my eye. There was something on the floor where Eric had been sitting. I was pretty sure it had not been there earlier, or perhaps it had? I was so confused, this was the weirdest and most creepy experience of my damn life, and somewhere in the back of my mind I was looking forward to kicking back and laughing at this whole thing on the internet. I could already see the subject, ‘dear creepster Eric, let’s not meet again’. 

Bending over, I picked up one of the strange items from the floor. What I had initially thought was a button, and perhaps inwardly celebrating that I could prove Eric had been sitting here. Was slippery and organic, so I turned one of them in the palm of my hand, examining it. Clearly a seed of some sorts, it had a fine fuzz, but apart from it being flat felt mostly like an avocado seed. Was it some nuts that Aurora had dropped without noticing it? I left it on the kitchen island next to the book, telling myself I’d clean up in a moment. 

Leaning out from the kitchen to the hallway, I couldn’t hear Aurora’s voice out from the porch, but perhaps she walked the last trick or treaters down to the road. I dialed the police and told them about the weird encounter I had with a man presumed to be Eric. Dispatch assured me they would be there soon, and to stay in the kitchen just in case he was armed and hiding elsewhere. Apparently acting like normal was safer than potentially alerting the unwanted houseguest, because then I’d just risk them doing something desperate if found out.

As I hung up, Aurora had still not returned inside, which I found really strange. I figured she was caught up in conversation by the road, and so I set about cleaning a little while I waited for the police to arrive and check my house. I had to get a grip of myself, and so I started to clean Aurora’s fruit carnage on the kitchen counter, simultaneously looking over my shoulder every ten seconds. I stopped dead, staring at the tray she had haphazardly left on the corner of the sink when she picked up the last tray. There were those same weird seeds. I noticed a post-it on the tiles over the kitchen counter, listing all the fruits and nuts she used in case of allergies. “What the fuck is Cambodian apples?” I mumbled to myself, rolling my eyes. I knew Aurora would go above and beyond to find the newest trends on whatever social media she was into at the time. And I figured Cambodian apples were just another name for something stupid like peaches. However, I recognized all the other fruits and nuts she had listed, and as I looked down at the leftover fruits on the tray, I couldn’t quite place them. Could they be apples? or perhaps quince? It was hard to tell, because she had made them into little skulls, the seeds cut in half used for eyes. 

Another post-it in Auroras girly handwriting said, ‘the flat apple seeds are much too bitter, even dried. Don't use it for anything but decoration, the kids won’t like them’. And then I remembered buying those apples from a vendor in town. I had not been suspicious because we just moved in six months ago, and how were we supposed to know that pop-up vendors weren't a thing here? I even recall Aurora and I talking about how this place went all in for Halloween season. We had found it silly and somehow quaint that we’d come across this rickety stall, selling stuff that looked straight out of a fairytale witch’s pantry. 

There is no such thing as Cambodian Apples. 

I can’t help but to think, if I had only given the stranger, Eric, that book back. Perhaps Aurora had never poisoned all those children? Looking back it’s pretty obvious to me that the book somehow influenced me, twisted my perception. Made me believe Eric was the intruder, when he was in fact only trying to persuade me to hand him the book. I don’t know how the book came to us, but I have reason to believe that buying those Strychnine fruits from the creepy vendor is what singled us out. Like a timed bomb just waiting to go off, and we were just the gullible, unlucky idiots who happened to be lured in. 

I have kept an eye out for stories like mine, perhaps mostly to explain the unexplainable. And once I found the pattern, it wasn’t hard to find the stories. In one instance it was a guitar, and Eric was a French woman named Fiona, the outcome was the same. They had not wanted to let go of the guitar and the entire building had burned down. In another it was a porcelain figurine of a dog, and Eric had been a young boy. Again the same outcome; the oldest daughter had a Halloween sleepover in the basement, and all nine of them had died of carbon dioxide poisoning that same night. 

I know it sounds crazy. 

But if you find an item among your Halloween decorations you don’t recognize, whatever you do; don’t touch it. Leave it in the box, and when the stranger comes knocking, tell them to take the whole damn box.
