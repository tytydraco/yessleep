“EVERYONE IS GOING TO DIE! YOU ARE GOING TO DIE! EVERYONE IS GOING TO DIE TODAY!”

One of my patients was screaming in one of the rooms. Honestly, it was getting really tiring. I hate my job, I hate the people I work with, I hate this place.This patient, I think her name was Victoria or something. She would always scream this after taking her 9pm medication, it was a common occurrence. My shift was almost over, and I just wanted to go home, my son must be missing me.

I went to the women’s locker room. I changed quickly, because I wanted to get home as soon as possible. And then, the town bell started ringing.

“THE BELL! IT’S HIM!”

The patient screamed from her room. That’s another peculiar thing about her, she screams every time The Bell rings, it’s really annoying. The bell always rings at two in the morning, to let the night staff know when it's time to come back, it was a kind of "tradition". I put on my casual clothes and was ready to finally leave. Usually, this is the time when they turn off the lights in the hallways so the patients can sleep, I hear some of them grumbling as I walk down the long hallway. The bell should have stopped, but it kept ringing, for some reason.

I walked faster because of the next hallway, it was where the most dangerous patients were. I didn't like it there, one of them attacked me once. The bell wouldn't stop, it was already stressing me out. I reached the staff exit door, it was locked. Did Gabriel lock me in here? Today of all days... He must have kept it, I guess. I walked back through the dark hallways, turning them on every time I entered a new one, maybe I woke up a patient or two... Right?

I grabbed the doorknob and heard The Bell make its "clang" sound again. I felt strange, it seemed like with every touch I felt... Happy? It must just be the stress of this damn job. I opened the door to the warehouse, fearing something, something I couldn't see, not yet. When I opened it, I looked at the floor. There was a trapdoor. There was a damn trapdoor in the warehouse of a psychiatric hospital.

It was wide open, with the door open and everything, I wouldn't be curious enough to go in, but... I feel like I need to go in. So I went down.

“EVERYONE IS GOING TO DIE! YOU'RE GOING TO DIE! EVERYONE IS GOING TO DIE TODAY!”

The patient named Carol was screaming, I don't know what happened to her... She's been hospitalized here for about... 6 years, it's really unfortunate, but that's not why they called me here. A child who was the son of the employees disappeared last night, I tried to talk to Alexandre, but he said he was "too busy" with a big case or something, he could have at least been more polite...

I walked through the dark hallways, looking at each door. Aside from that patient screaming, I didn't hear anything else. In a way, that was a relief for me, all it took was for this crazy woman to scream that everyone was going to die. When I was getting tired of opening so many doors, I opened one, which seemed to be a warehouse or something, I could hear someone:

"Everyone is going to die... All of you are going to die!"

I could hear someone whispering softly, it sounded like a boy's voice, coming from... below? I stamped my foot on the floor, trying to find some hollow space, and I realized that there was something right under that carpet. I picked it up, a little scared, I admit. As soon as I finished pulling it up, I saw a trapdoor under the carpet. I froze for a second or two, processing what it was, then I left the warehouse and grabbed my cell phone. I dialed Alexandre's number. I needed to warn him that it could be dangerous. It rang for about two seconds, until he answered:

“Alex? Are you listening? I was here in case” He cut me off, he always does that.

“I already asked you not to call me “Alex”. What happened?”

“I may have found the child. I found some kind of trapdoor here in the warehouse.”

“Then why haven't you come in yet?” He was short and to the point. I don't understand why he is like this with me. He is so kind and polite to other people... I can't be the problem, yes, I am not the problem.

“Okay, I'll go in... You didn't have to be so rude”

He hung up before I could finish speaking

“Damn.”

I put my phone in my pocket, went back inside and looked at the trapdoor, thinking of several possibilities of what could be there. To tell the truth, I was scared. I have always been afraid of the dark, of the unsafe, of anything I might find under my own feet at that moment.

First, I approached very slowly. I could no longer hear the child talking, which made me anxious, very anxious. I touched the handle of the trapdoor and opened it. I saw a staircase going down, turned on my cell phone again and sent a message: "Alex, I'm coming down." Every time I went down a step, I heard someone go that resembled a cell phone alarm, like a bell. I felt a shiver down my spine, I've felt this many times, but this one is different, it's familiar in a way. Weird, but familiar.

I went down to the end of the stairs, and saw a dark hallway. I turned on the flashlight on my cell phone, and took the opportunity to see if any message from Alex had arrived. "Don't call me that, after you sort this out, meet me at my house. I need to talk." Talk? Just like that? I didn't reply to the message, and pointed ahead. I could see a hallway with two entrances on both sides, and a door ahead.

Now down here, I can hear it properly. It's not an alarm that looks like a bell, it's really a bell. But how the hell is there a bell here in the basement? Then, I heard a voice. The worst voice I could have heard in years.

“Mark?” 

I could hear it behind that door. It was his voice... My father's, he said my name. I should have left as soon as he said my name. I couldn't resist the temptation, it seemed like something was calling me to come see, to solve everything. I started taking slow steps towards the door, he kept repeating my name, it was horrible.

I heard the door being pounded, I quickly moved away, afraid of what might be behind it, it was being pounded harder and harder. I couldn't run, something stopped me, He stopped me, and the door broke. I saw the worst thing in my life. After that, I found out the reason why everyone died.
