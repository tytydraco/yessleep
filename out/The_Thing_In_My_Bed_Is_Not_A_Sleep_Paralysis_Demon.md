I’ve always had sleep paralysis. In the last few years, I’ve gone through treatments to lessen the episodes.  I’d hoped I would stop having them at some point. Two months ago, it all started back up again.  

The sensation of someone sitting on the side of my bed woke me up. I kept my eyes closed fearing what I would see. The old fear came back and my body refused to move. I knew this would only last a few minutes but that didn’t help my state of mind.   

The person got closer and I did something I shouldn’t have been able to. My eyes opened and I turned my head to see what was getting closer.   

Shock froze my body. For a long few seconds, I was starting at a completely dark humanoid shape. No, it was like it was a void with two glowing white eyes. It crept closer on all fours towards me and I finally screamed. I shot out of bed. A hand clawed at the back of my shirt as I fled. I frantically hit the light switch and turned around, my heart pounding.  

Nothing.   

This wasn’t like any kind of previous experience I’ve had. But it must have been just the same kind of sleep paralysis I’ve always dealt with. I refused to believe some sort of inhuman thing crawled onto my bed.  

Until it happened again.  

The second night I didn’t wake up until I felt a weight on my body. I was half asleep so I didn’t remember the night before at that moment. It all came rushing back when I saw the same void resting a head on my shoulder. I did what anyone would do in such a situation. I freaked out.   

I go out of bed, legs shaking and screaming. The thing reached out a hand and tightly wrapped it around my wrist. I felt something pop. By some miracle, I got away and turned on the lights. The signs of a struggle and the marks left on my wrist were the only thing that proved what I saw had been real.  

Over the next few hours, I didn’t sleep and a large bruise formed on my wrist. It hurt so much that I wasn’t able to move it for the rest of the day. I needed to figure something out. If I told people close to me, they would assume it was just the sleep paralysis or I wasn’t in my right mind.   

I couldn't find much online so I bought some sage from the local Wiccan store along with whatever they recommended. Normally I didn’t believe in crystals and things like that but I was desperate. I kept all the lights on in the house. A migraine from the sage smoke crept behind my eyes as the day wore on. I’d barely slept in the past two days, so I eventually passed out after midnight. Sleeping with the lights on should have solved my problem.   

It did not.  

Again, I felt someone crawling on the bed. I moved startling to that thing on all fours coming towards me. In a panic, I grabbed my blanket. Just before it landed on top of me with claws out, I wrapped the blanket around the dark shape and held it down tight against the bed.   

I did not have any kind of plan beyond that. I just hoped the fabric would have kept the claws away from my face. It struggled hard and I needed to wrap my arms around the bundle to keep it from escaping. It sounded pissed off. If it got out then I was a goner. My arms became sore from the strain. When I thought it was all over the struggle started to lessen. Did I suffocate it? Did it even need to breathe? What even is this thing?  

I had lots of time to think of questions with no answers. I didn’t dare let go fearing the monster would get free to eat my face off. I was still scared as hell but it also felt awkward holding the bundle for hours. My body gave out near dawn and I foolishly nodded off. When I woke up sun light poured through the open curtains. The blanket was empty. I opened the pile of fabric I saw rips and tears that should have been in my flesh.   

Now what? I couldn’t live holding a monster every night. Who knows if I would be able to wrap it inside the blanket again? I packed a bag and fled to a hotel for a night hoping it solved the problem. If I was lucky my house was haunted. I couldn't function on so few hours of sleep every night. I would get fired from work or run my car off the road if this kept up.  

I waited until midnight in the cheap hotel room before I felt safe enough to drift off. The lights were still on and I brought an extra blanket just in case. My eyes opened around three AM. I was relieved I hadn’t seen any sign of that monster that night. Maybe my place really was the problem.   

Then the pile of blankets beside me moved.  My heart nearly stopped when a pair of glowing white eyes peeked out staring daggers into my soul. The message was clear without any words.   

Silently I rolled over to carefully wrap an arm around the bundle. My chest was tight with fear but the thing didn’t make any threatening movements. It seems as if as long as I held this thing while it slept, I had bought myself some time. I don’t think this monster even knew being held was something it liked until it happened by pure chance.  

Until I thought of a new plan, this needed to be good enough. Two weeks passed with the nightly visitor coming by at random times during the night. It appeared under the blanket and woke me up with either a scratch or a nip. At least I was sort of getting some sleep. This wouldn’t last forever and soon enough that fact became clear.  

One night the creature woke me up in the normal way. A small nip on my arm to announce its arrival. It was enough to draw blood and I was getting tired of these minor injuries. The teeth came down again, harder the second time. I wasn’t able to get the blanket around the creature before it bit down even harder. For a painful minute, I struggled to get free. I tore its teeth away and I fled to the bathroom to look over the damage. The wound freely bled and I prayed I didn’t need stitches.  

This couldn’t go on the way it had been. I was exhausted. Fear and short nights wore me down to the bone. I didn’t know just how much longer this creature would hold back from eating me. I couldn’t ditch it and I didn’t even know who to contact about something like this. A priest? Would one even listen to me?  

I did something I wasn’t proud of. I decided to feed it.   

Wouldn’t raw meat work? Not so much. Turns out this monster, this demon, was a picky eater. No matter what I brought into the bedroom trying to tempt it into a midnight snack my arm remained the target. I was wounded, running on little to no sleep, and desperate when I started my plan.  

There is a small bar in town that serves cheap drinks. I rarely went to it because of the crowd that lingered there. But now I needed to go there for a gruesome purpose.   

Years ago, when I was in high school, I added a bunch of friends to my Facebook account then I never thought to remove them. Even the people who I hadn’t spoken to in over five years were still on my friends list filling up my feed with updates no one but them cared about.  

I knew that Kristen would be at the bar that Friday night. She often posted photos of her drinks begging people to drop by for a hook-up.  

We dated for three months in school. At one point I’d been tall and well-built. I did track and some football. She thought I was a catch. Then, I broke my leg and put weight on. She dumped me shortly afterwards going to the next attractive guy. It hurt a little at the time but I hadn’t really dwelled on it.  

I’ve changed a lot since school. Even though we dated I don’t think she would recognize me. The fact she was a little bit buzzed when I found her helped a little. I sat down next to her ordering us both a drink. She took the bait and within a few minutes, she was all over me. My skin crawled as I tried to play it cool. I needed to keep reminding myself why I was there. No matter how much I justified it, what I was about to do wasn’t right.  

She changed a lot since school as well. Her hair was fried from too many bad dye jobs. Her skin hung loosely from her thin frame and her teeth were stained from years of smoking. If you squinted you could see the girl she had been at one point. With my stomach churning I asked her if she wanted to come home with me after I knew she had drank too much to refuse.  

I hated myself every moment of the way back. We took a taxi because I didn't want to risk driving home buzzed. The driver was a witness but aside from being the last one to see her, I doubted the police would have much else to pin me after tonight.  

She still hung from me as we walked inside trying to act sexy as if I was going to dump her if she didn’t. I hadn’t told her my real name and she wouldn’t have remembered someone like me anyway. I was a minor blip in her high school years.   

I led her to the bedroom and carefully tucked her in. I said I would be out in a few minutes. She slurred her words already starting to fall asleep from being in a comfortable bed. I almost picked her up and carried her away seeing her peaceful face. Then the reason why I was doing this forced its way through my thoughts.  

I walked outside the bedroom and carefully shut the door behind me. Struggling to keep bile down, I listened.   

The second guy Kristen dated was a popular guy. Everyone loved him so it came as a shock when she claimed he forced himself on her and she got pregnant because of it. Her family was religious so the claim was the only way they would support their daughter. Regardless of there being no evidence, almost everyone was on her side.  

Her now ex-boyfriend gave up trying to prove his side of the story. He ended up walking into traffic. He left no note but everyone knew it had been on purpose.   

When she did have the baby, he died three months later. She said it was due to SIDS, but after her previous statements, I didn’t believe her.  

I heard her stir in her sleep on the other side of the door. She was speaking to someone she thought was the one who brought her home. I sank to the ground and covered my ears with shaking hands not wanting to hear the sin I was about to commit.   

I still heard it. I heard everything. The struggle. The screams. The bones breaking and flesh tearing.   

A horrible thought came to mind. Had she told the truth back in high school? And even if she wasn’t innocent, did anyone deserve what was going on inside that room?  

The contents of my stomach came up. I ran to the bathroom to rid my body of everything I’d consumed that day. Dry heave turned into sobs as I sat on the cold bathroom floor. The door opened and I shut my eyes tight not wanting to see the monster I’d just fed. It sat down on the floor and gently wrapped an arm around my shoulder. I sobbed as it patted my head as I still refused to open my eyes.  

I was the same as this creature. No matter what I did from now on, nothing would not change that fact.  

After wearing out my body, I fell asleep in the arms of a demon.  

When I woke up at noon my head pounded. I was alone. For some odd reason, I felt slightly better. Had I gotten rid of that thing for good? Was it only after a meal?  

It took me another hour to gather the courage to open the door to my bedroom to find nothing. Aside from the blankets and sheets being missing, I didn’t see any traces of blood from the night before.  

I really was losing it. Tomorrow, I swore to turn myself into a doctor before I hurt anyone else. Did I really hurt Kristen? Or was last night a delusion? I didn’t have her number but I did still have her on Facebook. I grabbed my phone to open the app that had forced its way onto my home screen.   

I scrolled down praying to see anything from her in my feed. My hands were shaking too much to type in her name to find her profile. My heart stopped when a post came up.  

It was a photo of her cat in a carrier posted four hours ago. She said she was excited to move.   

My knees fell out from under me and I sank to the floor.  

I’ve never been so relieved in my life. I don’t know what caused the mental break down but I was positive the past few weeks had been just that. I should have sought out a mental health specialist right then and there. But I knew once I went down that road, I risked losing some freedoms.   

I would go the next day. One more day wouldn’t hurt. I would take a hot shower, make a nice dinner, and go to bed early. One good day before I started a difficult journey.  

After the shower, I realized I didn’t have anything to make a nice dinner. I triple-checked I locked the door then left to the nearest grocery store. Some people gave nervous glances my way. I didn’t blame them. My arms were scarred and covered in bandages from still-healing wounds. The bags under my eyes made me appear ten years older and I’d lost a lot of weight in the past few weeks. Overall, I looked awful but I felt fine for once.  

I splurged on some good steaks wondering when the last time I had been able to eat one. My good mood lasted the entire way back home.   

My hand reached out to unlock the front door to find it slightly open. All the fear and dread came back with such force it knocked the wind from my lungs. I didn’t want to go inside. Shaking my head I tried to convince myself that I had just forgotten to close the door properly. That the new pair of shoes in the front hallway was something I picked up during the mental breakdown. The empty cat carrier had always been sitting on the kitchen counter. I had always lived with a healthy Kristen with dark eyes and jet-black hair.  

She smiled at my defeated expression. An orange cat jumped up on the table purring as she reached over to rub his cheek.  For a moment I thought the cat was in danger. But she wasn’t a predator to cats. No, she preferred something else. I silently started dinner with her watching every move.  

She attempted to eat as if trying to be polite. She forced a few bites down then got up to have a shower as I cleaned up.  

She had brought in a few bags of clothing while I was gone. New blankets had replaced the missing ones. The shower turned off and I sat on the couch running through my options for a few hours. The sun had long since set by the time I stood up to go inside the bedroom. She had been waiting the entire time.  

Moonlight came through the window making her short white nightgown stand out. If I didn’t know what she was, I would have found her beautiful. I picked up a small blanket off the end of the bed then climbed next to her ready to go back to our normal routine. Carefully, she pushed the blanket away, her hand taking my own. She guided it down to her stomach, a playful smile on her face. Her eyes flashed white. Not a single word was said and yet I knew what she wanted.   

I hate myself. I let a demon get comfortable in my home. I let myself get so worn down I accepted her every wish. I killed a person I had no right to judge. And in a few months, I’ll be the reason for another monster coming into this world.  

I may become the first meal for the new little monster. At this point, I think I deserve it. Until then, I’ll do my best to just get a good night's sleep.
