 

The Gorge

My Family (My dad, my Mom, and my 2 sisters) and I entered a theme park. There are tents and booths on either side of the walkway. On the left, there's a specific tent that's larger than the others, probably 15 feet tall and 20 feet wide with a curtain entrance with red and white stripes vertical on the tent like a circus tent. The man in front of the tent who's dressed like a ringmaster leads us in and it looks to be a house of mirrors and then shifts into a funhouse with many doors. In the back of the tent, there's a door that he attempts to lead us through. 

Ever since I had this dream the first time I always tried to warn my parents about what's behind the door and that if we go in I’ll die. I tried to beg my parents not to follow the man but they always do. The room that appears behind the door is seemingly endless in all directions, just a blinding white room with a thick layer of fog all around. There are no walls on either side, only the door, a long platform that leads into the nothingness and no floor below the platform, just an abyss. A room of complete nothingness.

The man starts walking straight onto the platform and leads us about 20 feet away from the door. I always end up behind everyone. The second I lose sight of the ringmaster on this platform he disappears, and that's exactly what happened. My mom moved in front of me and I couldn't see him anymore. Now he's not in front of us anymore, we look back and he's standing at the door. He turned around and walked through the door closing it behind him.

The platform is now multiple mushrooms, the same large and flat type of mushrooms that are in Mushroom Gorge in Mario Kart Wii. I turn again to face the end of the platform, my parents aren't there anymore and the platform ends on the mushroom I'm standing on. I turn again to face the door, I’m alone and the door is gone. The only thing that exists in this room is me, the mushroom I'm standing on and the endlessness below. 

I soon find out through crying out for help to no avail that there is only one way out of the room, and that is through sacrifice. No matter how many times I have had this dream the only way out is through jumping off the mushroom and infinitely falling. 

Each time this dream appears I know the end result and every time I know that when I jump off the mushroom I will fall further and for longer before I eventually wake up. This brings the fear of not knowing when I wake up and not knowing if I will wake up before I hit the ground if there is one. 

Every time I jump off the mushroom, even though at this point I know it’s a dream I can’t shake the fear of falling or the screams I make when I jump. 

I’m terrified each time I have this dream. I wake up hyperventilating and cold and sweaty. I feel as though I’d died in my sleep and I have to wait hours for my motor skills to behave how they should. Each time I have this dream it takes longer for my arms to stop shaking, my breathing to steady, and for my body to even sit up in bed.

Every time I have this dream I enter the dream at the same age I was when I first had it. I’m 20 now and I've had this recurring dream since I was 5, so now the fall seems to take forever before I finally wake up. 

The Gorge scares me, but finding the ground scares me more.

I think I should type my dreams out more often
