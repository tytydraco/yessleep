When the sun sets on me, it’ll set on you.

I was told that, an age ago, there were thousands of us. Protectors scattered across the world. Forever casting horrors back to the black realm. For darkness can never truly be killed. Only ever kept at bay.

Fernsby often talks of a time before recorded history. Mankind was shielded by gifted men and women who practised spiritual arts. *The Guard*. And all humans respected the power of that which they did not understand. For millennia, the black realm scarcely scraped the edges of our world.

However, as is nature’s way, prosperity invited growth. Humans multiplied. Time passed, and people spread to even *farther* corners of the Earth. As they did, many failed to teach their descendents of the spiritual world. The black realm became nothing but a ghost story. And then it became nothing at all.

Over the centuries, the once-mighty order of Earth’s guards shrank from thousands to hundreds. From hundreds to dozens. Men instead waged war under the banners of individuals, and they abandoned the one true war against the darkness.

By the twenty-first century, only Whitlock remained. The man who gave me this gift – this curse. Fernsby continues to spin fresh fables of the Guard for my yearning ears, but I still feel alone. She is devoted to the order, but she cannot fight for it – she is not splintered.

I should start from the beginning, but recalling that time of my life feels like dreaming of an alternate self.

Eight years ago, Evie and I moved to an island off the coast of England. We docked at a humble wooden pier, held together by rotten beams and misplaced faith. With a youthful spring in my step, I dropped onto the dock and ignored the disapproving groan of its ancient planks. And then I delicately lifted my wife over the edge of the small ferry, softly pecking her lips as we embraced.

There was an elderly man at the end of the modest pier. He wore a well-ironed police uniform and an unpractised smile – as if he hadn’t ever known joy. But I thought little of his sullen face. Evie and I were simply surprised to see anybody waiting for us. We hadn’t expected a welcoming party – even a party of one.

“I’m Chief Constable Arthur Whitlock,” The man broadly announced, extending a calloused hand. “Kane Foster?”

I nodded. “Yes, that’s me. It’s lovely to meet you, Arthur. This is my wife, Evie.”

“Pleasure to meet you both,” The man said. “Welcome to the island.”

It was a nondescript isle in the North Sea. At first glance, no more than a sleepy haven. I was an unobservant boy. As time passes, my eyesight worsens, and yet I see so much more clearly. I’m only thirty-six, but I feel twice that age. On the day of my arrival, however, I was young. Face fresher than the stiff boots on my feet.

“Look at this place, Kane!” Evie gasped.

Whitlock kindly drove us to our new home, and we admired the island from the passenger windows. The main town was quintessentially British, in a modern sense – rows of branded shopfronts and supermarkets desperately tried to tie the forgotten isle to the twenty-first century. We didn’t care about any of that. It was the isolated setting of the idyllic place which set it apart from the mainland. It would be Evie and me. Nobody and nothing else. That was all we wanted.

Our mouths hung loosely as our new home approached on the horizon. We’d seen pictures, of course, but no photo did it justice. The eyes of young lovers may have romanticised it, of course, but the building was a spectacle. A striking farmhouse at the outer rim of town. And it belonged to us. Neighbouring farmlands bordered the property on four sides, but we had abundant space. I knew, for the first time years, that I could actually breathe.

“So, the farming life beckoned you?” Whitlock asked.

“Aye,” I said.

“You’ve chosen a rough season to start,” The man replied.

I nodded, cheerily eyeing Evie. “It’ll be a challenge, but we’ve been through worse. Not that Evie ever shies away from hardship. This one thrives with her back against the wall.”

“So do you,” My wife whispered, chuckling as she suggestively raised an eyebrow.

I stifled laughter, but Whitlock either missed or ignored the comment.

“Are you prepared?” The officer asked. “I’ve lived here for fifteen years. Don’t let appearances deceive you. Island life is not like country life. It’s brutal. Unrelenting. This isle is no more than a glorified ship. We’re stranded at sea, fending for ourselves.”

I nodded politely, believing Whitlock to be needlessly theatrical.

“We’ve been through tougher things,” I said.

“I don’t doubt it, corporal,” Whitlock replied.

My stomach tensed, and Evie’s fingers clenched my hand. Whitlock briefly surveyed me in the rear-view mirror, before returning his eyes to the road ahead.

“Sorry, Mr Foster. It’s my duty to vet newcomers. I protect every last person on this island to the best of my ability,” He explained.

I shifted my eyes downwards. “I understand, but I’m no corporal anymore. I’d rather forget those days.”

“Which regiment?” Whitlock pressed, lacking any semblance of social etiquette.

I sighed. “The Duke of Lancaster.”

“And why did you leave?” He asked.

“Listen, we really appreciate the warm welcome, sir,” Evie interjected. “But Kane doesn’t like talking about that part of his life. It was an obligation forced upon him. He never really wanted to be a soldier.”

“Only fools do, Mrs Foster,” The man whispered.

Whitlock rolled the car to a stop at the entrance to our farmhouse. Expressing uncomfortable gratitude, Evie and I hurriedly collected our belongings. I waited until the police cruiser was halfway down the dirt track to speak.

“What an idiot,” I muttered.

Evie smiled, rubbing my back. “It’s over now, honey. You’ll only have to see him… well, every single time you leave the house, knowing what small-town officers are like.”

“We shouldn’t ever leave the house then,” I grinned, lifting my giggling wife off the porch and carrying her across the threshold.

We had nothing to our name but four walls and a roof. Years of savings had been poured into that fresh start. After the horror of serving my country, farming was an opportunity to find peace.

War, however, always seems to find me.

The first year was a struggle, but we quickly learnt the ropes of farming. The following year, our crop yield improved, as did our standing in the community. Even Whitlock, over time, became more of a bemusing grandfatherly figure than a grouchy recluse. I found the new life a little strange at first, but I quickly adjusted – quickly switched off. And Evie could teach anywhere, so she was more than happy. If I could’ve lived that life until my dying day, I would’ve been buried with a smile.

That life – the only real life I’ve ever lived – lasted for two years. Two cruelly brief years.

On an evening of belligerent rain and thunder, I pulled into Jerry’s petrol station. A rest-stop that bridged the gap between home and town. Usually, the jolly owner would emerge from his shop to greet me. On this fearsome night, he did not appear, but I didn't blame him – the weather was vile. Still, I did find it a little strange to see a brightly-lit shop area with an unattended till. Though he received little custom, Jerry practically lived behind the counter.

*He must be taking a break*, I decided.

As I fiddled with the petrol pump, rain soaked my clothes and chilled my flesh – even the station’s awning couldn’t shield me from the near-horizontal downpour. Once my car’s tank was full, I repeatedly tapped the drenched self-checkout touchscreen. It didn’t register my finger. Every time I dried the screen with my jacket’s sleeve, a fresh curtain of water coated it seconds later.

“Come on,” I huffed.

A sudden crash sounded.

Jolting backwards fearfully, my credit card flew from my hand, landing in a puddle. Once I’d overcome the initial shock, I was surprised that I’d heard anything over the booming rain and thunder. When I curiously peered around the petrol pump, I saw that the store’s power was out.

“Jerry?” I called.

My voice was drowned by a pistol-whip of thunder. Something about the lightless shop filled me with unease. I wish I’d driven home, grabbed Evie, and fled to the mainland.

Foolishly, however, I crept towards the shopfront – propelled by a wilful breeze. The shelter above the petrol pumps cast enough light for me to distinguish a faint outline in one of the aisles. A man was kneeling on the ground, hunched over something. And when I reached the automatic double doors, I was surprised to find that they opened.

*It can't be a power cut*, I realised.

“Jerry?” I called again.

The man didn’t turn. He continued to hunch, making an awful munching noise. It was a visceral chewing sound. So unnatural. I could’ve assumed the man to be a thief, but I recognised that red, chequered shirt. It was definitely Jerry.

*What’s he eating?* I wondered. *Is he okay?*

The automatic doors closed behind me, and the rain became a muted, distant backdrop. Seeing no more than a few feet ahead of me, I walked through the silent shopfront towards the man on his knees. When I reached him, I crouched down and placed a hand on his shoulder.

“Jerry, what are you doing?” I asked.

In a sudden snap that sent me sprawling backwards, the man’s head twisted – twisted farther than any human neck should allow. And he revealed the source of the munching.

*The owner was eating shards of glass.*

Jerry sat in a pile of shattered tube fragments, and I looked above to see a burst light fixture.

“I like the feeling of it...” He panted in a garbled, barely-audible voice.

Chest rapidly beating, I watched the man lean forwards, inching out of the shadows. Jerry’s face was finally illuminated by the lighting from the outdoor shelter.

And it was not a face at all.

Holes tunnelled through the cavities that should have revealed his eyes and mouth, but these gaps instead continued to the other side of his head.

I wailed, scrambling to my feet, and Jerry inexplicably rose in mirrored unison – as if I were puppeteering him. The man howled, widening the tunnel that had been burrowed through his skull. Without waiting for an explanation, I turned on my heel and sprinted to the automatic doors.

I returned to the weighted blanket of a thunderous night, and a vehicle was parked alongside mine – a police cruiser. Beside it, Whitlock was standing in the rain with a bulky pistol raised.

“MOVE!” He yelled over the downpour.

Driven by a soldier’s instinct rather than thought, I dropped to my knees and heard a sound more deafening than thunder – the cold familiarity of a gunshot. With my head between my hands, and sodden jeans pressed into a puddle, I momentarily returned to Nigeria in my mind. It took a while for Whitlock’s voice to permeate my thoughts.

“Kane?” He shouted over the rain. “Are you hurt?”

I looked up at the man and shook my head, before turning to face the store behind me. I expected to see a slaughtered man – or once-man – lying in the puddle, but I did not. Jerry’s hellish form was hobbling into the forest, oozing a silky, shadowy substance from the headless stump that Whitlock had created.

“Come on,” The officer said, grabbing my arm to pull me to my feet.

We climbed into my car and silently eyed the rainy windscreen for a few minutes.

“What *was* that?” I whispered.

“Not Jerry,” Whitlock eventually said. “He died. What you saw was a thing that feeds on physical suffering. It needs a host to remain in our world, and it forever flits from rotting corpse to rotting corpse. It chose you as its next host.”

“Jerry didn’t have a face…” I mumbled.

“It wasn’t Jerry,” Whitlock repeated. “There is a world beyond ours, Kane. I wish you hadn’t seen that. However…”

I paused. “What?”

Whitlock ruffled his grey beard thoughtfully. “We’ve become close. Is it fair to say that?”

“Aye. We’re friends…” I shrugged. “You were a little abrasive at first.”

“Abrasive?” He grunted. “When you see what I’ve seen, you’ll understand. And you must take my place. You’re splintered.”

“Pardon?” I questioned.

“You carry it in your eyes, mostly,” Whitlock explained. “It's an innate gift. The tell is a person's look. I saw it on the day you arrived. You were always broken, weren’t you, Kane? Long before you fought for your country.”

I turned away, eyeing the woods from my side window.

“It takes a splintered person to do what must be done,” The man continued. “It’s not purely about strength or intelligence. It’s not even about the cobalt bullets that send them running back to their world. After all, those dark things return. They always return.”

“What are you saying, Arthur?” I irritably asked. “I don’t understand.”

“I am a guard of Earth, Kane Foster,” Whitlock explained. “And I am the last of my kind. I have long searched for someone to follow in my footsteps, and you are the first splintered soul I have met in a long time. Since my guide passed. I want you to take the Oath of the guards – to fight darkness.”

I turned to face him, narrowing my eyes. “I’ve just seen something that has made me question the very essence of reality. I never want to see anything of that nature again, and you’re asking me to actively pursue such things?”

“Guards don’t pursue,” He said, shaking his head. “We defend.”

“I will forever be grateful to you for saving my life, Arthur. But you need to get out of my car. I’m going home to my wife. And I’ll forget this night, just as I’ve forgotten countless nights of horror.”

The officer sighed, but he nodded. “You’ll change your mind, Kane. The day will come. As I said, darkness cannot be killed. It always returns.”

The Chief Constable stepped into the rain, shutting the passenger door behind him, and I immediately slammed my foot onto the accelerator. I wanted to put some distance between myself and that haunted station.

I was enraged. After two years of tranquillity, I’d finally started to heal – finally reached a point of happiness in my life – only for a fresh nightmare to rear its head. Unable to process what I’d just witnessed, I turned to my old coping mechanism – suppress and forget.

“What’s wrong?” Evie asked.

I’d barely taken my damp coat off, and my wife was already anxiously eyeing me. She could see the whiteness of my face. I never mask trauma as well as I like to imagine.

“Just a bad day. I… hit a deer on the drive home, and I had to call Arthur. He put it down,” I lied.

Evie knew I was hiding something, but she didn’t press the subject. Like me, she was afraid – neither of us wanted to face the possibility of a psychological relapse. We left our pain on the mainland, and I planned to leave it there. So, I resolved to move past the horror of the petrol station, and I thought Evie had forgotten all about it. But she surprised me a couple of days later.

“Come in here, Kane!” My wife giggled from the living room.

I put the food in the fridge and strolled into the lounge to see something entirely unexpected. On the sofa, Evie was sitting cross-legged with a golden bundle in her lap – a Labrador.

“He’s called Benny, and he’s thirteen weeks old,” Evie gushed, playing with his floppy ears. “Somebody abandoned him outside the school – isn’t that horrible? Anyway, I asked Laura, and she said we could foster him until she finds a new owner… Unless…”

I lifted an eyebrow and grinned. “Unless…?”

Evie chuckled. “Well, what do you think?”

I attempted to muster a stern stance, but my disposition softened upon locking eyes with little Benny. The glistening bundle of joy in my wife's lap. Before I was conscious of doing so, I’d slumped next to Evie and started petting the loveable Lab.

“So, that’s a ‘yes’?” She laughed.

I sighed, rolling my eyes. “Sure. Will it delay the talk about kids for another few years?”

It might sound strange to those who’ve never had a pet, but Benny changed me. His calming presence on the farm help to mend old wounds in my battered mind. Evie, essentially, brought a therapy dog home. She knew exactly what she was doing, and I loved her for it. After all, it worked.

*A ‘splintered’ man*, I thought, scoffing. *Arthur’s got it wrong. I’m better now.*

That may have been so if Evie and I had continued to live in peace.

A week later, on a night that I have long sought to forget, a noise woke me. Two noises, actually – Benny’s barking, and the crunch of gravel beneath sturdy feet. I groaned, slipped into a T-shirt, and sleepily shuffled out of the bedroom.

“I’m coming, Benny!” I whispered loudly, attempting to calm him whilst not waking Evie. “Mum’s teaching in the morning, and she won’t appreciate…”

I stopped mid-sentence. Benny was growling at the living room window. The motion-sensor had activated our property’s exterior lights, and something was standing perfectly still in the driveway.

A headless man.

“Jerry…” I whispered.

Keeping my eyes on the horrifying creature, I side-stepped towards the living room door. The headless abomination didn’t even sway in the wind – it was glued rigidly to the spot. And then the outdoor lights turned off – only to return when a skittering sound filled the still night.

The man on the driveway was gone.

And the foundations of our house began to whine under a sizeable weight. He was crawling up the outer wall. He’d scurried out of sight in less than a second. Before I could think, there came the sound of an upstairs window breaking, followed by a shrill scream.

“Evie!” I shouted.

I ran upstairs, and Benny overtook me – barking wildly. We flew across the landing and burst into the bedroom, but we were too late. I witnessed a scene of horror that, eight years later, still fills me with sickness. The corpse of Jerry Black, mutilated by a force beyond human understanding, was slowly digesting the body of my half-living, wholly-seizing wife.

As her upper body was consumed, she immediately became motionless.

I fell to the floor in a detached state as Benny lunged at the abomination. Events passed in a haze – I refused to comprehend what I’d seen. The hellish being effortlessly kicked my courageous puppy aside. Not that my wounded friend was deterred, of course, as he quickly clambered to his feet and began tearing at Jerry’s trouser leg.

The creature didn’t care about the Labrador. Even without a face, I could tell it was looking at me.

Slumped on my knees, tears staining my face, I watched the undead devourer lumber towards me. I closed my eyes and braced for death. Prayed to be reunited with Evie. That didn’t ease my terror, of course. The monstrosity took measured steps, relishing in the build leading to my demise. The stale, rotting breath of the creature rose from the depths of its stump-like neck opening. It billowed against my face.

Inches from me, the footsteps stopped, and I heard floorboards creak on the landing. There sounded a guttural bellow, a squelching tussle, and a human yelp of pain.

When I opened my eyes, I was baffled to see a blade driven through the corpse’s abdomen. A medieval sword which glistened in the moonlight. Jerry’s undignified corpse began to twitch violently, and ethereal matter evaporated in black streams from its near-fleshless body. The hilted blade and the creature crumpled to a lifeless mess on the ground.

Leaning against the door frame, Whitlock was clutching his pained side. A dark, bloody wound stained his shirt, and black vines were spreading quickly across his flesh. I wanted to say something. Do something. But I couldn’t. My eyes were drawn to the empty bed.

Evie was gone.

“I… I’m sorry…” Whitlock wheezed, coughing. “She… I tried to stop it…”

I didn’t want to exist. Benny was sadly surveying me, whilst whimpering softly, but I barely registered him. I barely registered Whitlock. I thought only of Evie – of life without her.

“I’m so tired…” Whitlock mumbled, choking on his own blood. “My time has come. In truth, it came long ago… But I was waiting.”

I didn’t respond.

“I’m not doing the job that needs to be done,” Whitlock whispered. “Earth needs a true guard, Kane.”

“She’s gone…” I sobbed, disconnected from the conversation.

“I know…” Whitlock croaked. “But *we’re* here. The world is turning. And you–”

“– *You must fight*,” I whispered. “*War moulds a man. A man who doesn’t fight for his country? That’s no man at all.* My father said those words to me. That was how he justified his coercion – forcing me into the Army at the age of sixteen. That was how he justified beating my mother and me too.”

“This isn’t… I’m not…” Whitlock spluttered.

“You were right when you said that only fools want to be soldiers, Arthur. I was a fool. *They might teach me how to put Dad in the ground for good*, I thought. So, I did as my father asked. And the cigarettes took him in the end. Not me. Then, I forgot why I even signed up. I became an expendable pawn in someone else’s war. I fought for this country because my life has never been my own. I’ve always served others.”

“Kane, I’m…” Whitlock began.

“– I *loved* this island, Arthur,” I continued. “Evie and I were living for ourselves. We had a *life* here. And I’ve just watched it die in front of me. She was the only person who made the world seem a little brighter.”

Benny whined and padded towards me, brushing his soft head against the back of my hand.

Whitlock heaved heavily, inspecting the wound on his rapidly rotting flesh. “It left Jerry’s corpse… It’s trying to claim me as its host. We can’t kill it–”

“– Can’t kill darkness,” I absent-mindedly muttered.

“No… However, without a host, it has no option but to flee to the black realm,” He whispered. “I must be killed before it–”

“– Killed?” I repeated.

The old man wearily nodded. “You must do it, Kane. This is our chance to stop the creature before it claims anyone else… First, however, you must take the Oath. A spiritual binding that will open your eyes to the black realm, as it did for thousands of guards before you.”

“Guards? It’s over, Whitlock…” I whispered.

“NO!” The man roared violently. “This is about everything, Kane. *Everything*. Reality as we know it. Will you condemn billions of souls to eternal blackness because you lost your–”

“– Don’t…” I sliced into his sentence. “*Don’t* diminish her death.”

“I’m not,” Whitlock grumbled, lowering his voice. “But our world is dying, Kane. For decades, as the last of the guards have perished across the Earth, our reality has sunk deeper into the black realm. I have barely kept it at bay – horrors skirt past me, and they take innocent lives. Without the Guard, Earth's suffering will increase tenfold.”

The man slumped to the carpet, clutching his wound, and we sat in silence for a while. I was thinking. Processing. Contemplating ways in which I could take my life and join Evie in the afterlife.

*There has to be an afterlife*, I thought. *A supernatural realm exists – there must be something after all of this.*

*But what would she say?* My wiser voice asked. *Would she smile? Would she forgive you for condemning friends and loved ones to an eternal torture?*

I loathed what had to be done.

“I will take the Oath, but I will *not* be the last guard of Earth,” I finally said.

Whitlock’s weary, near-lifeless eyes welled. “You are a good man, Kane Foster.”

“A splintered man,” I gruffly said.

“To be splintered is not an evil thing,” Whitlock explained. “It is a reflection of your inner turmoil – not the character of your heart.”

The man tossed his firearm to the carpet.

“Cobalt-laced bullets,” He coughed. “You know Fernsby, don’t you? My dearest friend. She manufactures them for me. Cobalt repels darkness. It’s in the sword. The bullets.”

I picked up the rusty handgun, realising I hadn’t held a weapon in three years. It felt too natural. Too *easy*. Everything else faded away. And that was how I’d survived as a traumatised soldier – when the body is at war, the self dies.

“The Oath…” Whitlock whispered, removing a hefty book from his coat and placing it on the carpet. “I don’t have much time… Place your hand on the cover.”

I obliged, placing my unarmed left hand atop the cobalt-bound book.

“Do you swear to uphold this realm, Kane Foster?” Whitlock hoarsely asked.

“I do,” I answered.

“Will you protect every *earthly* inhabitant? Man or creature? Good or evil?”

“I will,” I said.

“Kane Foster…” Whitlock coughed, spluttering blood with a black tinge. “I… grant you the title of *Guard*.”

An unexpected pressure pierced my palm – as if the book were binding me to it. The world changed, and it has never been the same since. As if I’d unlocked a previously forbidden nook of my brain, I suddenly saw Earth’s darkness. Every rip in reality. Every opening through which horrors had entered.

“What does it mean to be a guard?” I asked, noting Whitlock’s fading eyes. “I… don’t know what’s required of me.”

“You were a decorated soldier, Kane Foster. You already have the brawn and the intellect to face hostile enemies,” He said. “The Oath has granted insight. You will come to understand your role. Trust your vision. Trust…”

Whitlock lost the strength to talk, and his breathing grew increasingly laboured – the black web was coating his cheeks. I rose to my feet, preparing myself for what had to be done. It was painful to be present – even more painful to take note of his death. All I could see was a swirling darkness enveloping our world – the ever-multiplying cracks in reality, inviting unimaginable frights. Exhaling deeply, I lifted the handgun and aimed at the dying man’s temple.

A single shot filled the room with almighty light and sound.

I am the last guard of Earth. I search for splintered souls so that, one day, I might end my lifelong war. On that day, I will be Kane again.

And I will be with Evie.
