I remember walking through a dense forrest of titanic trees, trees with darkened bark and onyx leaves. Wether from the pale blue glow of the moon or something unnatural it's Hard to say. I remember carefully stepping through the thicket of thorns In a place so quiet that bliss had left it entirely and instead had been replaced with something in-between caution And sorrow.
Night after night I have this dream. I start in the same place. I wander for some time and then find myself awake in a cold sweat, attempting in vain to capture stolen breaths. 

It is particularly strange because I don't necessarily have the same dream every time I drift away, the dream simply takes place in the same setting each time. I've come to discover that I can freely explore this blackened wood with little fear of trepidation or danger so long as I mind the bramble that populated the ground so densely in some areas. I've heard slight noises though they are always echos of echos that pass through the trees from somewhere much farther. I hear them when I am awake at times, just after i shoot awake from one of my strange dreams, Though that could be marked up to a sleep addled bout of delirium.

I say all of this to set a precedent for what is already a normal sleep experience for me. I'm using this thread as a sort of journal to log and map out my dreams so I can make some sort of sense to them. That being said if you have any ideas, suggestions, or you've experienced similar dreams I welcome your comments.
I'll start with the reason I decided to begin posting here instead of ignoring my nightly escapades. Last night, for the first time, I experienced something new.

It started as it always does, my eyes opened in an outcropping seemingly placed perfectly in the center of the black woods. Every single time I am laying on My back just how I had been when I fell asleep and I become completely awake and aware the moment my eyes open. Typically I'll stand and begin To walk. I've never really has a destination, it's always just a sort of meandering, I'll glance and the repetitive rows of trees that seem to carry on infinitely, looking to the shadows casted in between them for some hidden entity or sign of life but there's never anything there, I cannot put into word how destitute the forest has always been. When the dreams further started I Had spent most of the time panicking, running, looking over my shoulder but in the more recent nights I've used it as a meditative blessing rather than a terrible curse.
I'm rambling.

I woke up like I always have and stood to walk in the silence. I mentioned early that from time to time I hear noises, distant and dissonant sounds that bounce from tree to tree before being delivered to me. Last night those noises broke through the barrier of silence again and climbed into my ears further than they have before. And I heard words.

I could not make out what those Words had been but they where without any reasonable doubt the whispers of someone…perhaps multiple someone's bit there's no way of knowing for certain just yet.

upon hearing the sounds I stopped for a moment to eliminate the sounds of My footsteps Polluting the woods with sound. They came again and still I couldn't Make sense of the words, they had no pattern, they were not constant, nor did they seem to have a trigger. Sometimes they came, and sometimes they didn't.

I felt them pull at me, As if beckoning me closer but how can one possibly draw himself closer to somthing he can't pinpoint the location of. So I sat. And I listened for each random instance of sound in such a silent landscape.
And this time, I could Make out a simple word laced in between a cacophony of language. 
“path”

to be completely honest making out this one word was more infuriating than making out none at all. Am I to find a path? Am I on the right one? Is there no path?. So many questions pollute My mind from deciphering a single word of what seems to be a pertinent message.
I tried again and again to hear more of the message but they had stopped and returned the wood to a still.

I have walked these woods in every cardinal direction and have never once stumbled on a path of any kind, or anything but the same tree repeating itself over and fucking over again.
I decided at that moment to try and walk in one direction. if I wake up I'll try again the next night and make it as far as I possibly can before being returned back to my clearing. 

The next piece of the puzzle was how to map out a place that mirrored itself end over end to Ensure I was walking in the same direction Each time. yes I wake Up in the same position every time but It'd impossible to tell if I'm facing the same way each time. The easiest option was to go back to my clearing, pick the direction and mark My Path in hopes the changes I made would remain, the most present worry being that the forest resets itself each time I visit.

It has at times been easy to get lost in the woods but I have found myself subconsciously knowing where to find the place of origin. I made my way there,  stood in the center of the clearing,spun Around and then stopped. I walked directly to the tree in front of me and using my finger I scraped a thin line on the surface of the trees bark. Walked to the next tree and did it again. And again. And again. I repeated This until I awoke from the dream as I do. Covered in rivulets of sweat and panicking at the loss of breath.

However this time something Differed from my usual waking. I felt a tinge of pain in my torso, it climbed from my waistline Upward toward my chest. I grabbed at myself in a panic, my chest was wet but it was not the thin and salty Streams of sweat I had been accustomed to. But something thicker and warmer.

I glanced down to see the driving force of my Writings now. From ribcage to ribcage, neckline to navel. I was covered in small thin scratches that each bled a small amount of my vital life. As if something Had barely marred The surface of my skin.

I have to dress my wounds again. I'll be back to update this thread tomorrow morning with my findings
