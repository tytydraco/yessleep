I’ve never liked moving, but for Palisade Gardens, I was willing to do anything. My husband, Peter, and I had found our dream home there, and by some miracle, we’d actually gotten it. I couldn’t believe it when our realtor had called us with the good news. 

We moved in as soon as possible, packing up our cramped two-bedroom apartment in the city and relishing the move to a quieter, more peaceful area. Palisade Gardens was by far the most coveted neighborhood to live in. It had the best schools, was a 20-minute drive to downtown, and had a selection of healthy and organic grocery stores to choose from. Plus, it butted right up against a beautiful forest, a perfect place to hike and explore nature. Location wise, it was the holy grail of neighborhoods—and our little family had snagged us a piece of the dream. 

Kyle, our six year old, carried a small box of his toys up to his new bedroom. The house had four bedrooms, and he’d chosen the one that faced the big oak tree on the side of the house. The primary bedroom was just down the hallway from him, and it was almost as big as the living room in our old place. 

I still couldn’t believe we were here. Life was about to get so much better. 

As I put things away in the kitchen, the pleasant chime of the doorbell filled the main floor. God, even the doorbell sounded heavenly. I placed the pot I was holding onto the sleek granite counter and walked down the hallway to the front door. Bright sunlight shone through the frosted glass, bathing the entryway in a golden glow that made my heart happy. 

I opened the door, and even the sun seemed brighter out here. I blinked a few times to adjust my eyes then saw a thin, bird-like woman standing on our stoop. She had gray hair that fell flatly around her chin, and she carried a small covered dish. 

“Hello,” she said, her pale lips stretching up into a smile. “My name’s Denise. I’m your neighbor across the street.” She held out the dish to me, which contained delicious-looking brownies. Kyle wasn’t a big fan of chocolate, but Peter and I would be more than happy to finish them off ourselves. 

I grabbed the dish and invited her in, stepping to the side as she entered. She looked around the entryway, as if assessing the space. 

“We’re still getting settled,” I said, suddenly self-conscious of the empty space. I’m sure Denise from across the street had an immaculate home, one filled with thriving plants and expensive furniture. 

“I’m Molly, by the way,” I said, leading her into the kitchen. “And thank you for the gift. That’s so kind of you.”

“‘Not a problem at all,” she said absently as she looked around the kitchen. I wondered if her house was a cookie cutter replica of ours or if it was different. Probably the latter; nothing about this neighborhood was cookie cutter. 

“How long have you lived in Palisade Gardens?” I asked. Denise finally turned and looked at me. 

“About 30 years. My husband and I love it here.”

I was about to ask about her husband when she spoke up again. 

“In fact, I need to get back to him. He has dementia and can’t be left alone for too long.”

“Oh, of course. I’m sorry to hear that,” I offered. Denise nodded then glanced around until she saw my phone on the counter. She hurried over to it and picked it up. Before I could say anything, she dialed a number and the phone in her own pocket began to ring. She hung up and put my phone back down. 

“There you go,” she said with a curt smile. “Now you have my number in case you need anything.”

Then, she left the kitchen and headed toward the front door. I followed her out, not sure how to respond. She opened the door and stepped outside then turned back to look at me. 

“It was nice meeting you, Molly,” she said. “I hope you decide to stay. It really is such a wonderful neighborhood.” Then, she was outside and down the walkway. I watched as she crossed the street, unlocked her door, and stepped inside her house. 

For the first time, I noticed that all her windows were curtained, not an inch of sunlight able to poke inside her home. What a shame, especially on such a beautiful day. 

Unpacking had taken most of the day, and there was still plenty of arranging and organizing to do. But we’d reached a spot we were all happy with, so Peter and I got Kyle ready for bed then snuggled up with him on the living room couch to watch some TV before going to bed. 

The neighborhood was darker at night than I had expected. There were no streetlights, only the faint glows coming from the houses, and most of those were muted by curtains or blinds. 

The quiet and darkness were much more intense than in the city, and I fell asleep almost immediately once we cuddled up in front of the TV.

When I awoke, I was alone. The TV was turned off, and the blanket was tucked neatly under my legs. Peter must have put Kyle to bed and made sure I was comfortable down here before going up to bed himself. 

I clicked on my phone, squinting at the bright light, and saw it was almost midnight. My neck hurt from the angle I’d been sleeping at, and I looked forward to getting a few hours of rest in an actual bed before starting the day. 

Yawning, I stood up, stretched, and folded the blanket over the back of the couch. I shuffled as quietly as I could through the living room, not wanting to disturb my sleeping family upstairs. I got to the stairs and had one foot over the first step when a quiet knock echoed through the house. 

I froze, uncertain if I’d actually heard it. This was an unfamiliar house; maybe it was just settling. 

But then I heard it again. A louder knock this time, coming from the front door. 

I wrapped my cardigan around myself and moved to the door. I peered through the peephole but couldn’t see anything. I leaned over and flicked the porch light on, and when I looked back outside, I saw Peter standing on the doorstep. 

I opened the door, looking at him through the glass of the storm door. 

“Peter?” I said sleepily. “What are you doing outside?”

He smiled at me sheepishly. His black hair was tousled and he wore a cream sweater I didn’t remember him having on when I fell asleep. 

“Sorry,” he said with a shrug of his shoulders. “I went outside to check on something and got locked out.”

“But … the door wasn’t locked. And what were you checking on?” I didn’t know what it was, but he was being weird. His eyes kept flicking to the hallway behind me, and something about his face was off. Wrong. 

“I thought the sprinklers were on,” he said. “I just wanted to check on them, but it’s fine. Can you let me in?”

He glanced down at the handle of the storm door expectantly. I didn’t know why he couldn’t just open it himself.

“Are you sure everything was fine? You’re acting weird.” I hovered my hand over the handle, trying to figure out why I felt so strange about this. 

“Yeah, yeah, it’s fine. Just let me in. I’m tired and want to go to bed.” His voice was brusque, very uncharacteristic of him. 

My hand rested on the handle now. Just a tiny bit of pressure down and a push outward, and the door would be open. 

Then, my phone suddenly rang, a quiet chime from my pocket. I jumped at the noise then let go of the handle to fish it out. 

“No, no,” Peter breathed, his voice desperate now. His eyes bounced between me and the handle. “Just open it. Please. I want to come in.”

I looked down at the phone but didn’t recognize the number. I answered it anyway. 

“Hello?” I said, my pulse racing for some reason. 

“Molly, it’s Denise, your neighbor.” I looked past Peter and saw Denise standing at her window, her silhouette barely visible in the night. “Whatever you do,” she said, “don’t open the door. That thing isn’t your husband.”

I stepped back from the door. I didn’t understand what she was saying, but deep down, it made sense. Something was off about Peter, something on a visceral level I couldn’t quite articulate. 

“No, wait,” he cried out. “Please, I just want to come in. I won’t hurt you, I promise.”

The words drained the blood from my body. I grabbed the wooden door and prepared to slam it shut when not-Peter began to pound on the glass of the storm door. 

“Let me in! Just let me in!” he seethed. His teeth had suddenly become pointed, filed white knifes sticking out from his mouth. His eyes flicked yellow, sharp and cruel. 

I gasped and closed the door, the pounding stopping as soon as the door was shut. I locked it then slid to the ground, the phone still to my ear. 

“Molly, can you hear me? Are you there?” Denise’s voice sounded like it came from the end of a long tunnel, but eventually I responded. 

“What was that thing?” I said, still numb from shock. 

“We don’t know, but you did a great job.”

“I need to lock the other doors!” I suddenly shouted, jumping to my feet. 

“No, it’s okay,” Denise cut in quickly. “As long as your doors and windows are closed, they can’t get in. Just don’t open up your house to them, and you’ll be fine.”

I slid back down the door, my heart still beating rapidly.

“What’s going on?” I said, my words catching in my throat. 

“Listen, Palisade Gardens really is a wonderful place to live. It’s got everything you’ll need to make the perfect home for you and your family. But there’s something that comes here at night. You don’t have to worry about it, though. Just keep your doors shut and—“

Denise’s voice suddenly cut off. A beat passed then I heard her speak away from the receiver. 

“No, Roger! That’s not your sister. Don’t—“

Then the line clicked off, silence hanging in the air. I waited for Denise to speak, for her to call me back, but nothing. I called her, but it went straight to voicemail. 

I heaved a heavy sigh, squeezed my eyes shut, and let myself feel the rising fear for only a few seconds. My heart beat, my ears drummed, my tight eyes brimmed with tears, and then I got up. 

I had a family to protect. I was terrified of whatever was outside, but I wouldn’t let that stop me from keeping my family safe. 

With my phone still clutched in my hand, I ran up the stairs and to Kyle's bedroom. I cracked open the door and peeked inside. Kyle laid under the covers, his little chest rising and falling slowly. His room was still messy with half-filled boxes, but the nightlight cast a warm glow over everything. I sighed with relief then quietly shut the door and headed to the primary bedroom. 

I threw the door open and turned on the lights. Peter laid in the bed, tangled in the sheets, but he bolted up immediately when I called his name. 

“What is it?” he said, his eyes wide with fear. “Where’s Kyle?”

“He’s okay,” I said, sitting on the side of the bed and putting my hand on Peter’s knee. “But I need to tell you something,”

To his credit, Peter believed me right away. He didn’t make me feel crazy or like I’d been dreaming it. He just nodded with each detail, his face coming more and more awake. 

“We need to leave, then,” he said matter-of-factly when I finished. 

“We can’t, though,” I said. “We can’t open our doors.”

Peter worked his bottom lip between his teeth, ran his hand through his hair as he thought. But our brainstorming session was interrupted by a noise. 

We both looked at each other, straining to make sense of the sound. And then it clicked. 

Kyle was awake—and he was talking to someone. 

Before I could even think, I was up and out of the room. My feet flew across the hallway; my hands threw open his door. 

Kyle was out of his bed, his blue dinosaur pajamas barely visible in the light. His back was to me, and he was standing at his window, the curtains wide open. 

A figure stood on the roof just outside, its body hunched over to talk to Kyle face-to-face. It glanced up at me when I came into the room, and I recognized the face. 

It was my father’s face, Kyle’s grandpa we’d just seen over the holidays. Except this wasn’t him. It only looked like him.

Kyle’s hand raised, and he placed it on the window lock. 

“That’s it,” the creature said. “Good boy. Let me in.”
