I've always been honest on here, but I feel the need to preface that none of this is a joke. That giddy nervousness I expressed in my last two posts is gone, along with any joy, laughter, relief. All that's left in their place is guilt. 

I worked with Jess again last Thursday. It was an agonizingly boring shift so we chatted throughout. I remember she vented about her annoying little brother, her janky car, and how she'd stopped taking her meds because they were giving her insomnia. I matched her energy with complaints about my fast food habits and the draft in my bedroom because some idiot frat bro threw a beer bottle through my window. I wish I could remember every detail about that night but besides our conversation, most of it escapes me. I can only picture the ultraviolet lights, Shawn Mendes on the radio, Jess' jet black hair and Arctic blue eyes. 

It feels disrespectful to continue writing, but I'm too selfish to stop. Every day since, every passing second, all I can think about is relieving the burden of knowledge I've been left with. 

I was scheduled for Saturday afternoon with Jess, but an hour before the start of my shift I got a call from my boss, Monique. She said Jess couldn't come into work so I'd have to manage things by myself. I asked if any other coworkers could fill in and she promised she would check, but we both knew no one would answer this last-minute. That meant dozens of 6-10yr olds, seven hours, four parties, and just one of me. Our contracts state we're only allowed to work in pairs, but the bowling alley isn't known for respecting contracts. Shit happens; the show must go on. 

I arrived just early enough to set everything up for the parties. I lugged chairs, dragged tables, troubleshot the decade-old computer until all the names loaded onto the screens. By the time the first parent arrived, I was in my zone. I had shoes on half the kids before the families had finished decorating. Once the shoes were done, the names were up, the drinks were bought and bowling had commenced, I took a deep breath. The hardest part was over, I assumed. 

But after an hour or so of playing games on my phone, one of the birthday kids approached the counter. He placed a tiny hand on the false granite and blinked at me a few times. "Hello. Hello...? We don't have any balls left." 

I tore my eyes from the screen and straightened up. "Don't worry, I'm on it." I hopped off the chair and followed him to lane 9. 

When the balls aren't coming back, there are two places they might be. They could be clogging up the ball-return tunnel at the front, or they could have fallen inside the well at the back. Since I'd had a bad experience with lane 9 already (see my first post) I wasn't eager to dive back into the well, so I opted to check the front instead. I lifted the cover on the ball-return tunnel, and though only a portion of the cover is removable, I immediately spotted the problem: There were five or six jammed balls within my reach. I crouched over the tunnel, pulled each ball out, and rolled them back to the kids. Once I couldn't see any more, I asked the kids to throw another ball. That way I can verify that there aren't any jams further up the tunnel, since a single stuck ball guarantees a massive pile-up. The birthday boy nodded, threw a yellow one straight into the gutter, and I waited. I listened for the characteristic sound of plastic and resin rolling over smooth metal bars. 

I kept waiting. Then I heard it drop. 

It was moving slower than expected, but I wasn't too concerned. Not until the rolling came to a slow stop. No knocking, no tell-tale signs of a jam. It just stopped somewhere further up the tunnel. 

I told the kid to throw another ball. 

This one came down fast, smooth. I nearly let out a sigh of relief before it reached the same section of tunnel that the previous ball had gotten lost in and a grating sound filled the room. I'd never heard anything like it. Instead of metal on resin, it was like sand on rock or nails on tin. I looked around and saw that most of the partygoers were unphased. Either the music was too loud, or they were too inexperienced with bowling alleys to know that what they'd heard wasn't normal. But I knew. I began to rise when both balls shot down the uncovered portion of the tunnel in succession and made a perfect landing in the ball catch a second later. The kids cheered and I put the cover back on. I knew something was wrong but I put the cover back on. 

The grinding continued on and off for the rest of the afternoon. While the kids sang happy birthday and ate their cake, I listened to the tunnel gargle, sputter like it was struggling to cough something up. The longer I sat, the more human it seemed. It's stomach growled as motors spun in the back. It's throat, dry and raw, strained itself each time a ball passed through. It's felt-laid mouth delivered them, tempting the children's hands dangerously close to the abyss of its esophagus. My ear had been trained to hear the most miniscule of malfunctions. No one else noticed. 

The last parties were supposed to bowl until seven, but by six-thirty they were tuckered out. As the parents put the used shoes on the counter and rolled their disposable tablecloths, I shut off the lanes with the click of a mouse. Every lane except 9. 
 
It had run out of balls again. That didn't matter to the kids since they'd stopped playing, but it mattered to me. Whoever worked tomorrow would be annoyed if I left them an extra problem to deal with, and besides, I was curious. The sound had returned, this time more tinny as though a penny were rolling around in the dark. There had to be a logical explanation, so before the building emptied out I decided to test it again. I lifted the covers, removed the few balls that I could reach, then threw another. 

It hit the headpin. I sucked in my breath and waited to hear it drop into the tunnel like the others had, but no noise followed. Even the tinny scraping had ceased. The ball must be stuck in the well, I thought. Maybe that's my sign to leave. I got up and replaced the cover before heading back to the counter for my coat and purse. Inventory was done and the cash was locked. I was checking the times for the bus when I heard the the slow roll of something stiff and small down the tunnel. It meandered like a wobbling penny, but kept its momentum as it traversed from the far end toward the ball-catch. The basin. I approached slowly and lowered my gaze, till the exit of the tunnel held my full attention. It coughed and coughed, and spat out a little white ball with dents and shrivels on all its sides. After several rolls I noticed one pole was pink in colour, marked with squiggly veins. On the other pole was an iris, Arctic blue. 

I calmly stood, ushered the parents and kids through the front door, then called the police. 

You may be inclined to tell me that it wasn't Jess' eye, that I was seeing things or making some unfounded assumption. But this isn't one of those up-in-the-air questions. This is real. The police identified Jess' body after unscrewing the cover over the tunnel between lanes 9 and 10. I wasn't allowed to watch when they removed her, but I learned plenty through word of mouth. Her body had been stretched along the edge of the tunnel, wrung thinner with each passing ball. The pressure had knocked her key from her hand, her change from her pocket, her teeth from her gums, her eye from its socket. 

They said she climbed in. The tunnel is narrow but so was she, so it's a possibility. Thing is there was no smell, no blood. That was my first thought. Why did it take so long for me to realize? It was a rational question, because rationalizing was all I could do in my state of shock. No blood, no smell, no reason for her to climb in. It was only once they got me in a blanket and took me into the backseat of someone's car that the terror fully set in. 

Jess was gone forever, and though we weren't incredibly close, it was impossible to comprehend. I'd seen her just two nights ago, animated and well... alive. I can't say that she was particularly vibrant during our boring shift together but she was alive. Now she's so gone that even if her soul were to somehow return to her body, it wouldn't last for more than a few ragged breaths. Her parents will never get to say goodbye, her little brother will never get to hear her apologize for their spat, and Monique will never forgive herself for not being there. She was only 17. I was older, more knowledgeable. Maybe Monique will never forgive me. 

It's been two days but they've already declared her death an accident, the result of a "mental health crisis." She hadn't been taking her pills, after all. And she had the key to the bowling alley on her, so she could have let herself in at any point the night before. The tunnel was just narrow enough for her to squeeze inside but be unable to crawl back out. Plus, the autopsy found that one of her shoulders had been dislocated antemortem. She'd tried her best to escape. She'd fought. They think she was dead before the first ball rolled down that tunnel, but it's not conclusive. If she wasn't, then she was alive until I turned on the machines at the start of my shift. 

Maybe it's just the denial or the guilt eating me up but I refuse to believe that this was just a "mental health crisis." Jess was fine the last time I talked to her, and she was the last person I could imagine climbing into a suffocatingly tight hole by herself at night. I said in my first post that she scares easily and I stand by that. When I told her that something touched my hand in the well on lane 9 she not only believed me; she insisted we only go back there together. She also lived on the other side of town and her car wasn't in the parking lot. Am I expected to believe she walked to the bowling alley? The night buses don't take you out this far. She would have been walking that road for at least 45mins, sometimes in the pitch dark. 

But anything can be explained away with a "mental health crisis," right? I don't think so, and I'm pretty much the only one. Even Monique -who believes in ghosts- told me that it was disrespectful to make up "conspiracy theories" so soon after her death. The more I push and prod, the worse I feel. I already know it was my responsibility to protect her because she was younger, vulnerable. Then to think that I'm turning her death into some spooky reddit story for a bunch of strangers... Even though I've given fake names and kept my descriptions pretty general, it feels exploitative. 

There's only one reason I chose to write this, and it's not karma or upvotes. I want people to hear my side of the story. I want people to know that I grabbed a hand under lane 9 and that I saw something round that wasn't a ball. That I told Jess this, that she believed me, and that now I realize that I should've quit and forced her to join me. Because I've survived whatever fucked up shit is happening here, but I would have never stayed a second longer if I'd known I'd lose Jess. 17 is so young... That past Saturday I was worried I'd scare her; now I wish I'd scared her more. 

I'm going to send in my resignation tomorrow morning. I can't do this anymore.
