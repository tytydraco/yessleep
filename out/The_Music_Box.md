I sat at my sturdy oak desk, willing a creative spark to caress my brain, without much luck. Writers block had encased me for over a week now in its merciless hold, and my next book was promised to be completed by next week. I sighed, sparking up another cigarette and staring blankly at the unfinished novel on my screen.

You'd assume with two novels and a miniseries of books already published that I'd be better than this by now, but the stress and deadlines from my publishers have sucked all the creative energy out of me.

My self loathing was interrupted by a soft knock at my apartment door, forcing me out of my anxious void. I pull myself off the leather chair and walk towards the door, expecting to be greeted by my roommate who'd forgotten his keys again. But instead, I open the door to find nobody. I turn my head left and right, perplexed by this lack of presence and am about to close the door when I notice a small gift bag on the floor.

'Ah, fan mail,' I mutter to myself, almost mustering a smiling. 'What's a failing artist without their petite clan of dedicated followers.' I picked up the bag and retreated back inside. I peak inside the bag, willing it to be something alcoholic (or at bare least, not a dog shit.)

A beige, circular object peaked back at me. I reach in to inspect it, holding it up. It was a wooden carousel, decorated with jet black horses. Underneath it was a winding mechanism.

'A music box, how unusual.' I thought to myself, carrying the carousel with me back to my desk. 'Well, let's see if a soft tune can ignite my mind.' I began winding the base, setting it down next to my laptop to hear an unfamiliar, distorted melody. 'I guess it's broken,' I sigh. 'At least we have that in common.'

'Hey, hey! Are you ok!?'

I slowly opened my eyes, the lamp in the living room burning my eyes like the sun.

'I just got home from work and you were on the floor, what happened?' My roommate Graham knelt beside me, a look of genuine concern on his face.

'H-huh?' I spluttered, feeling groggy and confused. Graham helped me to the sofa, where he gently guided me down.

'Have you eaten today? How long were you out?' Graham asked.

I glanced at the clock, rubbing my neck. 'About three hours.'

Graham walked to the kitchen to pour me a glass of water. 'You need to take better care of yourself,' he told me sternly. 'You get yourself stressed out and don't eat or sleep, it's not good for you.'

Graham forbade me from using my laptop for the rest of the evening, insisting I instead have a bath while he prepares us dinner.

We sat opposite each other at our small dining room table, eating quietly. I broke the silence with the usual question of 'how was work?' Graham sighed, pushing his pasta around his plate with his fork.

'It was shit, the boss was an asshole to me all day and the customers were as horrible as ever. I swear I could kill the lot of them and burn the place down if it didn't pay the bills.' We both laughed.

'So, what about you? Surely something interesting happened to you besides passing out for hours?' Graham teased. I shrug. 'I got some weird fan mail earlier, well I assume it's from a fan anyways. It's that strange carousel music box on my desk. Fuck knows what it plays, some warped sound or something. Must just be some broken thing someone didn't want.'

'Bizarre.' Graham replied, as we continued eating.

I went to bed not long after dinner, per Graham's instruction. I actually woke up feeling rather refreshed, an unusual occurrence for me.

I stretched, got dressed and headed into the kitchen for my morning coffee. Beverage in hand, I sauntered over to my computer desk to try and conquer the writers block with my new fresh outlook on the day.

I see a small post it note stuck to the corner of my desk and pluck it from its position.

'Morning! I took that carousel thing into work to see if I can fix it on my break. Don't overdo it today. See you tonight.'

I smile, placing the note back down and taking a moment to appreciate Graham while my laptop booted up.

An email from my editor instantly flashed up on screen. 'Oh, great,' I muttered as I opened it, 'He's going to be on my case about getting this thing finished.'

My eyebrow raised as I began to scan the email. 'Woah that's early for your deadlines, nice work for getting it done in time. It's quite a bit, well, darker than your usual stuff but I'm sure we can make work with some editing maybe. I don't really understand why you've gone down this route but we can fix it. Just leave it with me and don't send any drafts to the publisher until we can figure this out, ok?'

'What?' I say out loud, and am about to reply when an email from my publisher pops up.

'Hello, we have received your final copy of your recent novel and we must say we don't find it appropriate. The content seems very violent and personally threatening, and upon further discussion it is with great sadness that we must terminate your contract with us. This is very unfortunate as we have enjoyed working with you and had high hopes for your upcoming work. We wish you well in your future.'

My heart felt like it was in my throat, and I began reaching for my phone to call them and explain how there must be a mistake, when I notice the file I'd attached.

It was dated yesterday, around the time I'd assumed I was unconscious.

The story that I'd once had written on the page about a fantasy medieval world was gone, and in its place was a vulgar, graphic slew of the detailed methods on how I wanted to torture each individual publisher in the company. I felt sick to my stomach as I read the disgusting ways 'I' was harming them, committing unmentionable violent attacks on the staff.

I pushed my computer chair back and got up shakily to find my phone, desperate to fix this and find who was responsible.

On my way to my room, I noticed the gift bag still on the floor by the living room table. Their was a note inside which I hadn't seen yesterday. I reach down and pull it out, reading the handwritten note.

'With this device, all your thoughts can come true. An artist can paint whatever image is in their mind, a chef can cook any dish they envision, a writer can put to words all the thoughts scattered in their head. But be cautious, not all thoughts should be let into this world.'

My eyes widen as I piece together what this meant. I drop the note and run for my room to my phone, but a loud knock at the door stops me in my tracks.

I walk to the door, heart pounding, to find two police officers stood in the doorway.

'We're looking for Graham Opson. We understand this is his residence.' On of them tells me sternly.

'Yes, he lives here. But he's not in, he's at work, why what's wrong?' I splutter, barely able to get the words out.

The officers exchange a look, before glancing back at me. I step aside and tell them to look around.

They do so, and within ten minutes we're all stood in the living room with me firmly asking what's going on and if Graham is ok.

One of the officers let out a sigh.

'Mr Opson is wanted for the murder of several people and the arson of his workplace. We've been tracing him on CCTV for an hour but he's managed to escape. If you see him or he makes contact, please let us know.'

The officers left soon after, and I sat on the sofa in a daze for what must've been hours.

I snapped back to reality when I heard a key in the door. It was Graham.

'Uhh, evening. Sorry I'm late, I woke up passed out in a woods for some reason. Maybe one of my bastard coworkers spiked my soda, or maybe what you had yesterday is some sort of virus that I've caught.'

Graham walked into the living room and perched on the sofa next to me. 'You alright, you look a bit pale, maybe we both just need some time off. Oh, by the way, I didn't have any luck fixing that music box. It really does sound distorted though doesn't it. I hope you don't mind but I gave it to a coworker who left at lunch time, he's good with these sorts of things and might get it working. Lucky bastard booked half the day off for his kids birthday party. Anyways, shall we have a takeaway tonight? I'd kill for some fried chicken...'
