I never thought moving could be this stressful. The boxes were piled up in my small car, the furniture squeaking as I carried it through the narrow hallways of the apartment, and the stairs smelled of old wood and something musty I couldn’t quite identify. My apartment was on the third floor, windows overlooking the courtyard, where a few cars sat, but no people. Everything felt quiet, much quieter than I was used to.

On the first day, I only unpacked a few things, arranged the essentials: bed, desk, wardrobe. I barely slept, too nervous, too excited, everything too new. I hadn’t met the neighbors yet, and the building was strangely silent, although you could hear the usual sounds of pipes and doors.

In the evening, there was a knock. I opened the door, and a man around my age stood there, friendly, his name was Tom, living two floors down. He smiled and introduced himself briefly. “Welcome to the apartment,” he said. I nodded. It was a harmless moment, but I felt a slight chill.

On the second day, I brought more of my things into the apartment, trying to unpack some boxes. I noticed sounds, barely audible at first: footsteps, soft knocking, like someone was moving through the building. I thought it was Tom or one of the other neighbors and ignored it.

On the third day, I met Sarah, a woman from the second floor. We spoke briefly about the weather, the apartment, the area. All harmless, friendly. Then she casually mentioned: “Do you know something terrible happened here once?” I laughed nervously. “No, what happened?”

She looked at me seriously. “A man… a killer, years ago. With a chainsaw. It was… horrible. They say some say it’s cursed or something.” I felt a knot in my stomach. Of course, it sounded like a legend, a neighborly rumor, but in that moment, everything felt different.

The following days went normally, I unpacked and settled in. But the sounds continued, especially at night. Steps approaching my doors, sometimes soft knocking. I spoke with Tom and Sarah about it. Tom laughed: “Ah, the old stories. I’ve lived here for years, no one ever…” He stopped, looking at me as if he sensed I wasn’t joking.

On the fifth day, it started getting really unsettling. I lay awake late, hearing voices, whispers, sometimes noises that sounded like someone climbing the stairs, but when I looked, there was no one. Once, I saw a shadow move in the hallway, quick, barely noticeable, but unmistakable. I tried to convince myself it was my imagination.

Then, on the night of the seventh day, I woke up. Sounds. Soft creaking of doors, the typical scuffing of steps on old floorboards. I lay still, holding my breath. Then a sound that made my blood run cold: a loud, metallic screech – like a chainsaw, only briefly, then silence again. My heart raced.

I got dressed, grabbed a flashlight, and cautiously walked through the hallway. Sarah’s door was open. Light spilled onto the carpet, and something I couldn’t comprehend at first: blood, everywhere. The apartment was chaos, furniture overturned, broken glass, red splatters on walls and floor. My heart was pounding so hard I thought I could hear it.

Then I heard it. The hum of the chainsaw, this time closer. Not outside, not on the street – right in the hallway. I screamed quietly, ran back to my apartment, tried to lock the door. But the sounds got closer, heavy steps, then the creak of stairs, as if he was coming up to my floor.

I grabbed my things and ran. Through the hallway, down the stairs, everything chaotic. The buzzing, the screech of the chainsaw behind me, heavy breathing, aggressive. I flung the front door open, ran into the darkness of the courtyard, looking for cover.

No car, no person. Only shadows. I knew he was there, somewhere. I ran around the corner and found an old basement door, opened it hastily, stepped inside. It smelled of mold and mildew, the air thick, barely any light. I crawled behind boxes, hid behind shelves.

And now I’m here. On the floor, trembling, phone in hand. I’m writing this while I can hear his breathing, the sound of the chainsaw, the screeching, getting closer. He’s looking for me. I don’t know how much longer I can stay here.

The basement door creaks. Steps. Buzzing. He’s almost here.

And I… I’m writing this because I have no other choice.
