To start, here's some context. My wife and I had been trying for a kid for a while, we first decided that we wanted kids back during the pandemic, but decided to wait a few years for things to open back up first. We struggled for a long time, which made us a little concerned. We are both still pretty young as far as having a kid goes (Iris and I are both 27) and to our knowledge, neither of us had any medical issues that should be preventing us from having children. Things got a little rocky for a while, we got into a few fights, and I had to stay at my brother's a few times, but we still stuck with each other. 

Finally though, by some miracle, Iris got pregnant, and a good few months later we found out we were having a baby boy. Things were looking up and quite honestly we were happy just to be having a kid, it felt like those years of stress and arguments had washed away over the past few months. Well, in hindsight that is easy for me to say, I didn't have to go through the hard part of having a kid.  Is that rude to think about? Ah, not important right now and not why im here. We were here for the strange stuff.

It started on the day my son was born, I was driving to the hospital from work, racing there after hearing Iris started having contractions. I was working a late shift at my family's restaurant when I got the call, my brother Nate said he'd cover my shift while I drove out and I didn't waste any time, or at least I'd have liked to buy a storm was raging overhead, and I wanted to be alive when i got to the hospital. The rain was hammering on top of the hood of my car. All I could see before me was the road, my headlights and the occasional stop sign emerging from the dark, sometimes I'd get a full view from the light of a thunderstrike. 

I was probably a good 10 minutes away when my gas tank was nearing empty. It wasn't too far but i didn't wanna risk breaking down in the storm, luckily there was a gas station nearby. I pulled in and stepped out of my car, taking shelter under the overhead while filling up the tank. That was when the first strange occurrence of the night took place. I felt a sudden gust of wind blow through the gas station, nothing out of the ordinary for a storm aside from the sudden change in direction, however, the man who was now standing behind me did catch my attention. 

“Hello,” 

He said as i turned to look at him. His voice was soft, and slightly accented, Sounded kinda Italian. I was caught a little off guard as I turned to him and without any idea what to say i just replied.

“Hello”

 That was when I got a good look at him, he was dressed kinda like a cartoon detective, big grey trench coat covering most of his body down to just above his ankles, around which he wore not shoes, but tied-up sacks. He was tall, near towering over me but kept his chin to his chest, using his fedora to obscure most of his face. All I could see was his mouth and part of his neck. The skin was rough, almost like burns, while his mouth and lower face looked almost normal. 

The only notable exception was his cheeks, which seemed to have slits in them, almost as if someone tried to cut a joker smile into him, although it was clean, with no sign of scaring or cuts, just 2 clean slits on either of his cheeks just cutting off about a cm away from the edges of his mouth. 

We stood in silence for a moment, my attention only breaking from his when I realised I was still pumping gas into my car, and made sure to stop that before going over. I was half expecting to look back and see the man gone but he was still there. Hadnt moved. I looked at him and simply asked. 

“Can I help you” 

“No”. 

We went to silence again. I then went to go pay the gas station attendant for the gas but he placed a hand on my shoulder to stop me, his fingers were long, or at least they felt that way, as when I turned to brush him off his hands had already moved and been placed in his pockets. 

“Look im kind of in a hurry so if you dont mind im gonna go pay for my gas and get going” 

I'd blurt out. The man seemed unphased as he shook his pocket, the sound of coins jingling inside them. 

“You should get going, your wife needs you”. 

I was taken aback. His odd appearance notwithstanding I felt some mix of fear, but also anger. I questioned how he knew in my head, but the words that came out betrayed me as I simply said 

“Is she ok?” 

He simply nodded, before pointing over to the car, the line of questioning already started I continued 

“And my son?”. 

The figure once again gestured to the car saying. 

“He will be well.” 

Im not too sure what was with me at that moment, I know how I felt, but my words and body were betraying me, I acted in a sense of false comfort despite feeling far from comfortable. I did what it said though, Even though it didn't tell me to do anything I sort of just knew, as I got in my car, and turned on the gas. Before I drove off it tossed a coin into my car through the cracked open window, and simply said before I drove off. 

“Safe Travels”.

I was 5 minutes down the road when whatever calming effect it had on me wore off, and I felt the anxiety slowly creep back in. It was only then I realised I dont think I saw their lips move. I kept driving. Once I arrived at the hospital, there seemed to be chaos all around, Doctors and Nurses running from place to place. I knew there was a storm but this wants a big hospital and our town is rather out of the way, so it did strike me with some concern when a nurse approached me with a panicked look. 

“Are you here for your wife?” 

she asked assertively, to which I replied honestly with a yes. Gave her my wife's name and she looked at me with what looked to be a sigh of relief as she led me to the room my wife was in. 

I'll spare you the gory details but Iris was ok and our son Luke was healthy, 8lbs 12oz. More than I can say for the other mothers there that night. I feel blessed but somehow also guilty. The news didn't report on it long and just passed it off as a tragic 1 in a million occurrence. 146 babies were born that night, all to mothers within 80 miles of the hospital. Even some who weren't due for another few months, some even more. A good number didn't make it. 

Iris and I tried to focus on the positives, even with that story hanging over our heads, we had a son, a beautiful baby boy. At the time I had so many dreams of what future he could have, so many possibilities. I still do, but now… once we brought him home things seemed to cheer up. Most of the stuff people had warned me about when it came to having kids just didn't phase me, My mom gave me a few months of work to spend time with my son, while Iris was still on maternity leave while recovering. 

When they are still newborns there's not a lot to do with them any way other than keep an eye on them and make sure they are fed and changed. I was already used to late nights at work so I. 

Sorry, I thought it was at the window again. I should probably explain that. Things started getting weird about 2 weeks after we brought Luke Home. The storm had been raging for a long while and had only just cleared the night before. The First thing we noticed was Luke staring out our back windows. Always the back ones facing our backyard. At first, we thought he liked the colour of our fence, it was a bright blue colour and stood out against the gloomy environment, over time tho i realised his gaze was a lot more focused, One day I decided to sit with him as he was just laying there looking outside. I lay down beside him and looked out the window myself and that's when i spotted it. He wasn't looking at our fence, or anything in the yard for that matter he was looking into the trees behind it. 

I didn't know how he spotted it, especially since newborns are supposed to have horrible eyesight but now that I was looking I could see it too. A Bird. The greyish brown feathers were shrouded by the shade of the trees and the gloomy remnants of the past storm, the details of its silhouette now so clear to me but previously obscured by the shrubs and bushes. It was right there. I couldn't pin the kind of bird, not that I know a lot about them anyway but something seemed off, its beak withered and chipped in places, and its feathers while coloured pristinely were ruffled with some looking to have fallen out, mange-riddled skin flickering through the gaps. 

Its stare was the worst part, it was unwavering, almost human with the intensity with which it looked at us, or rather looked at my son. I closed the curtains my son just idly stared at them. This was 2 weeks ago now, and since then I've not seen it move, I've gone outside to try and chase it away but every time I step outside it seems to just disappear. Part of me still believes it's just a strange animal, acting out some odd behaviour. 

I've not told Iris. She has enough on her plate right now and I'd rather not have her worry about the strange animal that seems to be stalking our son. I know for sure it's watching him now, i never see it move between spots but it does change its perch when my son is taken to other rooms. Always in places where it can see through the window. I once called in animal control, they searched our entire yard, but not a trace. I even asked my brother if he could bring his dog over, which he did but the dog didn't find anything. 

Earlier today, I think it got into the house. Im assuming it was the bird at least. Iris was out with her friends on a much-deserved night off from parenting, meanwhile, I was home looking after Luke. It was about feeding time for him, not that it was scheduled or anything, more that he was crying a lot and I'd already worked through all the other options. I was in the kitchen, trying to work quickly so he wasn't left hungry for much longer. I had the baby monitor with me, I could hear him crying as I was screwing the cap onto his bottle.

In hindsight leaving my child unattended in this situation was a stupid move, but I guess at the time I was so used to having Iris around to watch him It didn't occur to me that he hadn't been on his own until now. I was just about to walk back to our room where his crib was before I heard him stop crying, slowing my pace after a brief pause before heading into a casual walk as I heard him cooing. My relief that my son finally felt at peace for a moment was quickly snuffed out by what I heard next.

A woman's voice came through the baby monitor, soft and melodic however with a slight creak to it that comes with age. It said words in a language I dont understand, something like 

“Kimisu tora pedi moo”

. I bolted down the hall to the other side of the house, throwing open my bedroom door to see the window slid wide open, my son in his crib and something looming over him. Looking at it hurt, like starting at one of those checkered moving image illusions, I could see what was in front of me but it left a deep sense of discomfort in my eyes. 

It lurched forward, feathered limbs stretching out toward me in a flash, elongating… or moving closer to me to reach me. I could only concretely understand a few details, it was vaguely bird-like, with brown… or blue feathers, its stomach as engorged and swollen, it stared at me with human eyes as its fingered wings coiled themselves around my neck as it threw me out the door. My shoulder still hurts from the hard impact on the drywall. The thing looked down at my son once more, its elongated face mere inches from his as it spoke once more, whispering this time, before turning to me once more. The eyes on either side of its face… faces? Whatever it was looking right at me with human eyes. Finally, it spoke English, its finger extending out as it pointed directly at me… with an accented voice it said 

“You are believing a lie, and have yet to acknowledge the truth”. 

It took a step towards me, its form shifting as it stepped into the doorway. It put its bleeding mess of a face up to me, my head pounding just from looking at it from a distance, but now I was up close it felt like my eyes were on fire and my brain felt as if the mere image of this thing was trying to tear its way out of my skull, I wanted to fight back, throw a punch, charge it but I couldn't even twitch a finger. 

Then Crack! I snapped back to reality as I heard the sound of rumbling from the clouds above, a flash of light coming from outside as I felt the earth itself rumble. Even with the snap to my senses, I could feel my heart beating out of my chest. he beast's head snapped back, its body rotating with it shortly after before it began to scurry out of my house, its large body snapping in places as it slipped through the window.  Once I saw it leave I clambered to my feet and charged in, slamming the window shut, latching it up as I saw the being return to the woods behind my house. 

It's been a few hours since then, and I've not left Luke's side. I've texted Iris, She is on her way back home now. Once she gets here we take Luke and head to my mom's place. I told her it was a break-in, and that I dont feel safe in my own home. I dont think she’d believe the truth. 

It came back to the window a few times since. It doesn't seem to be able to enter the house, kinda like a vampire. It's gone now tho, I've not seen it in a couple of hours. No sign of it in the treeline either. I'll keep you guys updated if anything happens but for now, im just gonna try and get away from here.
