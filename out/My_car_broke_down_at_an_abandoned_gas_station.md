I'll tell you right now, I don't believe in coincidences. So when my clunky old Mustang decided to give out on me in the midst of a godforsaken storm, at an eerily desolate gas station, I could only blame my awful luck. It was 3 a.m., I was miles away from the nearest town, and my damn car wouldn't start. All I wanted was a quick refuel and maybe some hot coffee to keep the tiredness at bay.  
  
The station was a shabby, outdated structure, seemingly forgotten by time. It was lit by a single, flickering neon sign, and the walls were stained with patches of decay and neglect. But I was more concerned about getting home, so I shrugged off the uneasy feeling that was slowly creeping up my spine.  
  
As I walked into the station, I noticed a disconcerting silence. There was no hum of electricity, no rustle of someone restocking shelves, nothing. It was as if time had stopped. I shouted out a “Hello?” but was only answered by my own echo.  
  
Growing increasingly uneasy, I decided to take a look behind the counter. I nearly retched at the sight. There was the clerk, his lifeless eyes staring into oblivion, a streak of blood running down his white uniform.  
  
Before I could even process the sight, I saw movement from the corner of my eye. I glanced up to the security mirror and saw shadows dancing outside the store. They were masked figures circling my car. Heart pounding, I instinctively crouched behind the counter, the cold touch of terror seeping into my veins.  
  
In a sudden burst of clarity fueled by terror, I realized my immediate peril and darted towards the front of the station. The rain was beating against the windows with a force that spoke of the storm's fury, but inside, my own tempest was raging. My hands, slick with sweat and trembling, fumbled with the lock on the doors. I finally managed to turn it, barring the entrance just as a lightning flash illuminated the outside.  
  
There they were, three masked figures, their white masks standing out eerily against the darkness, the relentless rain cascading off them. Their sinister silhouettes were a horrific tableau of my nightmare come to life. I backed away from the door, heart pounding, every instinct screaming at me to run, but there was nowhere to run.  
  
I pulled out my phone, hoping against hope for a signal, but all I was met with was the disheartening 'No Service' symbol. The storm had taken care of that too. I was trapped, a pawn in a terrifying game that I didn't know how to play.

No longer trying to gain access, the figures simply stood there, in a terrifying picture amidst the howling storm. Their white masks caught in the intermittent flashes of lightning, the macabre sight imprinted on the back of my eyelids every time I blinked.  
  
There was an eerie rhythm to their sway, an unspoken signal passed amongst them that made my skin crawl. They were silent, their haunting masks locked onto me, their unseen gaze tracking my every movement. It was like being caught in the crosshairs of predators, the feeling of being watched, and studied, a chilling reminder of my predicament.

In response to my primal fear, I searched for a weapon. My trembling hands found a forgotten, rusty wrench lying haphazardly behind the counter. Its weight, and its cold, weathered texture, provided a sliver of comfort in this nightmare.  
  
I dared to tear my eyes away from them for just a moment, hoping to find something else, anything to use in my defense. When I looked back, my blood turned to ice. They had moved closer, their masks now almost pressed against the glass, their sway more pronounced. The distance between us, once a small comfort, had diminished considerably, and their intent, their anticipation, was almost visible  
  
With the wrench clutched tightly in my grip and adrenaline coursing through my veins, I found myself stuck in a twisted standoff. It was as if I had unwittingly become a player in a perverse game of Red Light, Green Light with these ominous figures.  
  
Every time my gaze was fixed on them, they were still, as lifeless as mannequins under a store display, the only motion being the rhythmic sway of their bodies. Their flashlights created a ghastly under glow, illuminating their white masks in the dark, stormy night. They seemed almost spectral, nightmarish apparitions caught in a looping sway.  
  
An idea sparked in my terror-filled mind. If these figures didn't move when I watched them, then I had some control. The key was not to blink, not to let them out of my sight. Easier said than done, especially considering the burning sensation already beginning to nag at my straining eyes.  
  
From my peripheral vision, I spotted a jingling set of keys resting on a cluttered pegboard behind the counter. One key, larger and more weathered than the others, stood out. A car key. My mind raced. The clerk's old, beat-up truck was parked casually just outside the station. A risky escape plan formed in my mind, but I was out of options.  
  
Keeping my gaze fixed on the motionless figures, I reached for the keys, my hand shaking. I managed to unhook them, the jingling sound deafening in the otherwise silent station. My fingers closed around the cold metal just as the burning in my eyes became unbearable. I blinked.  
  
In that split second, the world changed. The once-empty space in the store was now occupied by the haunting figures. Their masks, just feet away from me now, glowed eerily under the flickering fluorescent light. Their eerie silence filled the room, the reality of their sudden presence threatening to overwhelm me.  
  
Yet, the terror, instead of paralyzing me, seemed to kick my survival instinct into overdrive. Clutching the keys, I bolted towards the back door, the wrench still clutched tightly in my other hand.  
  
As I ran, I dared not look back, but I could feel them, their chilling presence right behind me. The back door swung open, its rusty hinges squealing under the force. Rain poured in, but I didn't stop. I sprinted through the rain-soaked lot towards the battered pickup, my heart pounding in my ears.  
  
With a quick prayer, I jammed the key into the ignition, the engine sputtering to life on the second attempt. The relief that washed over me was short-lived as I glanced in the rear-view mirror. The figures stood in the doorway of the gas station, their ominous presence a haunting silhouette against the storm.  


I eventually made it to the next town and alerted the police. They found the gas station abandoned, the clerk's body was gone, and there was no evidence of anyone ever being there, except my abandoned Mustang.  
  
The police suspected it was a hallucination, a result of exhaustion and stress. They gave me a sympathetic pat on the shoulder and sent me on my way. But I knew what I saw, what I lived through.  
  
So now, I sit at home, typing this out for you. I hope that my ordeal can serve as a warning. Be wary of desolate gas stations in the middle of the night. And remember, coincidences don't just happen.
