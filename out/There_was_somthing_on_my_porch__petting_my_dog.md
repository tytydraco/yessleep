I'll be the first to admit , I'm not great at using this   phone yet , but I'm learning to be better, I hope this reads well and please forgive my mistakes. I'm still abit shaken up to be honest. 

Recently me and my dog Peanut  moved to a rather quaint house near the edge of the woods. It's a fixer uper but I used to live somewhere worse so I welcome the change. It's  a rather rustic log cabin , one bedroom and one bathroom , but plenty of space for just me and my dog.  


While the inside is small the porch is perfect, a lone rocking chair that looks into the forest , a  old but welcoming wood carved fence that runs around every bit but the opening to the stairs.  Next to the rocking chair is a little worn but fluffy bed , normally  a random toy will be discarded around it depending on the time of day. Peanut loves her toys 

She's a small dog , scruffy  , cute. The kind of dog you can't exactly  tell what she is beyond ' mutt'. But I mean that with love. She's the kind of dog who greets everyone happily no matter if she just met them , no matter what they look like. I remember when I first met her I was nervous, she was the first dog I've ever gotten close to, but she greeted me with open arms, kinder then anyone I've met in my life. 

She's been settling in well, of course I've been keeping an eye on her , making sure  she's  not snatched up by coyotes when she's  outside. I'm sure most pet owners will say this but she really is the best dog! 

I really wish I could spend more time with her. I've been trying , but I'm sure you know how busy life can be. 

Today was a rather cold late winter night, not even the mosquitoes bother to be out right now. While the cold air might be uncomfortable  to most , to me , I find it  relaxing. As much as I like walking in the woods I don't often take peanut with me especially  at night. While I do trust her , is rather not have to sprint after her in the dark too far from home if somthing goes wrong. 

I was just returning home , the warm glow of the porch light. Normally peanut is on behind the glass of the sliding door,  ready to greet me.. but this night instead of seeing her happily wagging  I see something else. A tall lanky figure loomed , sitting on my porch , holding my peanut, petting her. I can see that the figure looks calm though it's  hard to tell with how hideous  their face is. Eyes too small, teeth too oddly shaped, skin that sagged. 

Despite the creatures disgusting appearance  , peanut seems all to happy in his lap , enjoying the pets she is given. I can't exactly explain my emotions as logical. The only emotion  I felt was anger, blinding hot in my bones. 

This ugly creature  puts its  hands on my dog , on my new porch ? I don't think so. 

I grab a near by rake , the noise alerts the ugly figure, it's  small eyes going wide , staring at me in fear. As if it knows its  intruding , that it's  done  somthing wrong.    He gets up , peanut getting off his lap as the creature backs up, looking as if they were going to run. 

I understand  what I did next was rash, cruel even , but you might act this way too if some creature was holding your dog  at night.  I don't regret my actions even the slightest 


 I raised the rake over my head,  before stalking it down into the body  of the intruder. The rake peirced the flesh of their shoulder as they tried to flee , letting out a wail of pain. Blood oozing through the peirced flesh and down it's  body  As I stalked closer it tried to kick me , scratch me ,  but I pulled the rake out , this time swinging  it up  until the teeth of the rake impale it's  mouth  as if I'm trying to correct those freakish teeth.  

The rake pulls away less cleanly then it did from the creatures shoulder ,  soft looking muscle  and skin clingled as I pulled it back , tearing away a chunk of the flesh of the creatures mouth and jaw

The night air echoed with the sound of its  gurgling  the beast  struggling to make much noise with the gashing hole in its  face. The creature paws at the  wood of the porch floor helplessly , looking for something to defend itself  or trying to crawl away Those small disgusting eyes looked  up at me wide , but unfocused,  but we both knew at this point I wasn't  letting it get away. There were no warnings tonight. 
 

Another sick squelch noise as I granted a lethal sweep into the creatures stomach.. Despite my nawing anger that was the end of my rath. The rake was now broken , the thin metal spins snapping from the force , breaking off inside the now pitiful wheezing  intruder. The painful whistling  wheezing slowed  like the soft sound of cicadas on a summers night , drawn out to a fading lull in the night. 

 It didn't  take much longer before the wet wheezing to stop. Thd body below me finally going limp, the threat to my new home is gone. I can sleep alot better tonight knowing it didn't  get away  and won't  be coming back. 


As I drop the handle to the broken rake , a whimper sounds behind me. I look over my shoulder to see peanut huddled in a corner of the porch fence , her brown eyes scared, unsure as if she doesn't recognize me under all the gore.  

I smile at her crouching down,  holding out my less bloody hand  " it's okay Girl. It's  all over ... you're  safe now -" I try my best to assure her. I know dogs can't understand  speech,  but I can see she understands  that it's  all over.  Whoever  that  the figure was , is dead. 


I don't blame peanut  for any of this. Who can be mad at a dog so accepting to even love strange and hideous creatures ? 

Cautiously my scruffy little pup  comes over sniffing my hand before  her tail starts wagging again. Timidly  she moves her head into my hand for affection.  A spread of warmth and relaxation  run over my previously  enraged body. 

After today things wont be the same , i know that. the changes will be rough , but peanut again is a rather Adaptable dog. Even at my worse she still loves me.  I'm sure she will grow to love me more now that we have more time. In a week or two she will be back to normal and forget all about this. 

Getting rid of the creatures body is gonna be pretty simple. One of the perks of those pesky  coyotes is  it won't be long before the corpse is dragged off later tonight. Either way I'll deal with it, clean things up so peanut doesn't  get her paws dirty 

I open the door to my little cabin , holding it wide for peanut as I walk inside, she goes off to hide in her little crate , probably  needing time to process  what just happened. Or maybe just tierd. 

My eyes linger on  the wall, my lips Turing  up into a smile as I stare at a picture on the fire place. Peanut sits happily , a ball in her mouth,  looking only about a year old. It's  a pretty good picture,  taken and framed with care. It's  probably  the only picture Worth keeping on the mantle 


I'll keep a few of the other pictures for awhile. I'll probably  need at least one to keep  on hand. after all It will take awhile to look like the intruder who used to  lived here, to sculpt my face into his,  but  im sure it will help peanut feel less stressed around me. what wouldn't  a good pet owner do for their new pet ?
