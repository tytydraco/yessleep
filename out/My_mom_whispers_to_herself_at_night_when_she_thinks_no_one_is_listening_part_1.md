My family has an odd history of tragedy—at least, that’s what my grandma always says.

The only tragedy I vaguely remember myself is the death of my little sister Hollie, or Hol as I would always call her when we were children. I was 10 at the time so I don’t recall much. I know I was there when it happened. My memory is simply blurry, and I don’t put much stock in memories, they can be as deceitful as anything.

Thinking back now, I guess it always felt like some part of me was missing growing up.

My grandmother would keep on repeating her omens. Talking about past family history of accidental deaths, heartache, and the odd murder.

 ‘’It comes in waves; it comes when it wants to.’ She would ominously say but we all knew she was superstitious and generally odd. She had always been excentric according to my mother who has a much-strained relationship with her.

After the death of Hol, they grew even further apart. Grandma kept insisting something about her death wasn’t right. She would rant about an evil presence. In her worst moments, she would even go as far as throwing accusations against both me and my mother. Having eventually had enough; my mother cut all ties with her. It was the only way she could start grieving properly, she said.

For 12 years we continued as a family and did our best to move on together in what had always seemed to me, a haunted house that was now just a little shorter on love. There were hard times, especially for my mom, but it seemed we were slowly heading in the right direction.

That was until my mother started whispering to herself when she thought no one was around. It started a couple of years ago. Initially, my dad and I thought nothing of it, when we caught her from time to time, she would brush it aside. ‘’It’s nice to talk to a rational person on occasion’ she would chuckle. It honestly didn’t seem like any reason to worry. Many people talk to themselves.

Then one night I heard her whispering to herself from inside my mom's bedroom. I should mention that my that and her had been sleeping in separate bedrooms for a while at that point.

I’m not a person to intrude on other people’s personal space, but I heard her whisper my name. It got my attention. So, there I stood, in the dark upstairs hallway of my parents’ house spying on my mother. I know it might sound weird, but here’s the thing. She had been acting strangely for a while now. Distant. Almost a bit hostile toward me, and I had no idea why.

 We were never any good at actually talking to each other. ‘’the less said, the better’ could’ve been the family motto. This felt like an opportunity I had to jump at.

She spoke in a low, muffled, and angry whisper. It was extremely hard to hear anything, but here’s the gist of what I got: ‘’Simon (my name) blank, blank isn’t blank blank Hol, blank leave blank was blank blank evil blank blank fault.’’

 Suddenly her voice rose above a whisper into a loud command: ’GO AWAY!’’ I nearly jumped backward. Then I heard footsteps approaching the door and retreated down the stairs as quickly as I could.

I paused at the bottom of the stairs in the main hallway and looked up. I heard my mom open the bedroom door and step out. Had she heard me?

Then I saw her face peeking over the stair railing as I looked up. Backlit by the upstairs light her expression seemed dark and inhuman. If you’ve ever tried staring at your reflection in the mirror in a darkly lit room, squinting slightly, you’ll know what I mean. Features start to change.

 I stood there, frozen for what seemed like several minutes. I was sure she couldn’t see me in the darkness downstairs. I was crouched, hiding, yet it seemed like her eyes were staring straight into mine. I remained motionless, afraid to move, afraid she would notice me. Finally, she retreated into the bedroom.

I didn’t sleep much that night. All I could think about was the few words I had heard. Why had she been whispering angrily to herself about me and Hol? Who was evil? I wanted to confront her but how could I? I would have to admit to spying on her.

I had to know more, and seeing no other option, I decided to keep spying on her. The only problem was, I couldn’t hear her properly from outside the bedroom with the door closed. I needed to be in there.

The following nights I would hide in my mom’s bedroom, under her bed. It felt wrong. It really did, but I had to know what she was thinking. Confronting her, as I said, was absolutely not an option for several reasons.

On the fourth night, it happened. I was lying tugged, well, trapped really, under the bed when the low angry, and growling whisper began filling the room. ‘’I’m the only one who cares. The only one who ever cared.’ The whisper crept into the room and seemed to speak from the walls. ‘’They all forgot. They never mention you.’

 I didn’t know until then; how terrifying and angry a person can sound while whispering. I couldn’t believe this sound came from my mom. ‘

’Simon did this, there was always something wrong with him. Always something wrong with that kid.’

I felt an intense fear and unease mixed with sadness. Was this what my mother had always thought of me? I tried to keep myself composed, I couldn’t have her discover me now, creeping under the bed. Then she’d think something was wrong with me.

It became nearly impossible for me when a second whisper, which I KNEW wasn’t my mom, suddenly appeared. The pitch sounded inhuman, yet familiar. To my horror, I realized what made it familiar, somewhere in that angry, resentful pitch, were traces of Hol’s voice.  

‘’Something must be done about him. He must be punished.’

I covered my mouth and started sobbing. I couldn’t help it. I hoped my mom couldn’t hear it. Hearing Hol’s voice again speaking those words. I never really believed in ghosts, demons or any of the things my grandma seemed to believe in, yet how could I explain this? There was no explanation.

‘’I’ll make sure he suffers for what he did, Hol, I’ll make damn sure.’’

My mom was whispering to my dead sister, and they both seemed to hate me for some reason that completely escaped me. I know I probably wasn’t always the best brother, or the best son. Heck, there are a lot of things about me I don’t like, but did I deserve their hatred? Their anger? Maybe I did.

Suddenly the whispering stopped. I could hear my mom moving about the room. Had she heard my sobbing? For what seemed like agonizing hours I held my breath until the light was turned on and my mom went to bed. I waited until I was sure she was asleep and crept out from under the bed. As quietly as possible, I opened the door but just as I was about to close it behind me, I heard my mom.

 ‘’Simon, is that you?’’ I was caught. I slowly turned around. She was sitting up in the bed, bathed in darkness, I could barely see her expression, yet it seemed to be judging me. ‘’I’m sorry Mom, I…’’ Had no words. Nothing to explain why I was suddenly standing there. ‘’Is everything ok?’’ I shifted back and forth on my feet nervously. ‘’Yes, I’m sorry… I didn’t mean to disturb you. It’s nothing, we can talk about it tomorrow.’ Brilliant, then I had time to come up with an excuse. Hopefully, she hadn’t seen me crawl out from under her bed. ‘’It’s late, Simon, you should get some sleep.’ I nodded. ‘’Goodnight Mom.’ I closed the door and instantly felt a panic attack coming on. Like the fabric of my soul was being torn into. I didn’t get any sleep that night.
