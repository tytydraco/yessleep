So the past few days have been really stressful... My friend suggested that I should write about what happened to me and share it on this page, but I don't know how this would make me feel better. I guess in a way it could be a warning, but I highly doubt anyone would believe this anyway...

It all started when I got a call from my uncle shag last week, his real name was Chuck but I've always called him shag on account of his shaggy beard ever since I was little. That's not important. Anyway, his appendix had burst and he had to go in for surgery to get it removed. He asked me if I could house sit for him and get some work done around his ranch while he was in the hospital, feed the livestock, fix the fences, just simple things he normally did. 

I told him I could and asked if I could bring my dog Bear since I had just adopted him and didn't have anyone to look after him while I was gone. He said I could as long as he didn't bother the other animals.

I hadn't been to my uncle's ranch in a few years. It was in a desert area in Utah, but I still knew how to get there, so I made sure to pack whatever I would need for a few days there, some movies since there was no wifi at the ranch, and a couple of snacks for me and dog food for Bear.

It was going to be a two-hour ride and I hadn't eaten lunch yet, so I stopped by a fast-food drive-through, ordering myself a veggie patty, diet soda, and a small patty for Bear to eat. On the drive to the ranch, I noticed deer carcasses on the side of the road. I didn't think much of it besides the fact that it was so weird to see dead deer all the way out here, I thought they couldn't be found in areas like this.

A few minutes later I would drive up to my uncle's ranch. I parked near the house that was farthest from the cattle so they didn't get spooked and run away. As soon as I opened the car door to let Bear out he made a sprint to the cows. He barked and ran around a few of the cows wanting to play, but some walked away, and others just ignored him. After about two minutes of trying to make new friends, Bear gave up and went to do his business and mark his territory. I smiled at Bear, I had a feeling he was gonna have fun here.

I turned my head to see a cow staring at me. It was thin, I mean I could see it had some meat on its bones, but I could tell it was becoming emaciated. I looked down to see that it must've been looking at the burger.

"Hey, it's a veggie patty. I'm on your side buddy." I said as I raised it and pointed to it.

Suddenly I heard Bear yelp, I dropped my burger and ran towards him to see what was wrong. He had stepped on a broken piece of cactus. I quickly pulled out the thorns from his paw while he growled each time, but afterwards, I was rewarded with licks to my face.

I spent the rest of the day doing chores and working around the ranch, I won't bore you with the details of the work I had to do, but there was one peculiar thing that happened throughout the day. Bear kept growling at the anemic cow from a distance, he just wouldn't go near the thing. He would even grab my pants leg if I was heading in its direction. It was definitely strange, but I thought the cow was sick, and Bear didn't want either of us to catch whatever it had. Animals are funny like that. They can sense what humans can't. That should've tipped me off that something was wrong.


By the time I got dinner ready for Bear, and me the sun was already setting. My uncle left me a note telling me that his neighbor went grocery shopping before I came and left their number in case I needed them. There wasn't any wifi all the way out here, but there was a landline I could use.

"This is just like what the pioneers used back in the day." I joked to myself knowing no one was around to laugh.

I had set Bear's bowl down and made my way to the living room. Uncle Shag didn't have cable, but did have an old VHS player. As I set my food down on the living room table, I searched for something to watch. I ended up choosing Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein. When that was finished I rewound the tape and chose Monty Python and the holy grail to watch next.

I ended up falling asleep during the movie. I looked at the clock, 12:09, past midnight. I hadn't finished my dinner, but decided to just have the leftovers tomorrow. I got up and headed towards the guest room with Bear following me, I changed into a pair of boxers and got into bed. I fell right back to sleep as soon as I got into bed. I could feel the weight of Bear as he jumped on the bed and laid his body on my legs, using my stomach as a pillow. The last thing I remembered before I gave myself up to the sweet relaxation of sleep was petting Bear's head.

I was awoken with the sound of a high-pitched yelp. I quickly got up and in the process woke Bear up as well. No... That's not right... It was more like he was awoken by the same sound, I thought it came from him at first, but a few seconds later we heard the yelp again, it was longer by a few seconds. Bear began to quietly growl as the yelp slowly went from high-pitched to a lower tone.

I looked out the window to see if it was a coyote. One of the chores was to set Bear traps around the perimeter so predators couldn't hurt the livestock. I saw nothing to suggest that anything was out there. I left the guest room to see if I had left the TV on before going to bed, and sure enough, I did. It was just static. The yelping sound must've been coming from the movie before it ended and became static. I turned the TV off and made a mental note to rewind it in the morning. For the rest of the night, there was no other disturbance. Bear calmed down as well. I checked the time before going back to sleep, 4:44 a.m.

Morning arrived with the sound of a rooster making its iconic alarming sound. I got dressed and made breakfast for Bear and me, scrambled eggs with a side of orange juice and dog food. 

I stepped out to get started with chores and was horrified to see the mutilated corpses of three cows. They were spread apart in front of the fences, blood from each body colliding into one giant pool, and swarms of flies hovering over the remains.

It...It's hard to talk about the details but I'll try to be as thorough as I can...

Each cow had its stomach ripped open, their entrails spilling out like stuffing from a worn-out toy that's been neglected over the years. The thing I noticed next was their throats, they all had been slit as if they could keep them from making any noise. I was sick. The first thing I see in the morning is cow mutilation. I threw up.

I ran towards the livestock, praying this was the only casualty, luckily it was. The rest of the cows were huddled together in a sort of protection formation. You see, for some herbivores that have young or sick members in their herd, they form a sort of barrier surrounding them so that predators can't get through to them. I looked around to see if there were any footprints of what had been here.

Bear had come out of the house at this point, and he followed me as I searched for clues, but ended up finding nothing, no blood trail, no footprints. I looked over again at the herd. I saw the thin cow from yesterday, it was standing in the same place. If it wasn't moving its tail every few seconds I would've thought it was a cardboard cutout. The only difference from yesterday was that its entire snout was missing.

 I saw something similar a while ago when I was watching this nature documentary about African wildlife. There was a zebra drinking water from a watering hole when suddenly a crocodile ripped its face off. To my shock, the zebra was still alive, but almost its entire face was missing, leaving only a gaping hole of exposed skull a few centimeters under its eyes. I thought how cruel nature can be sometimes, and what was in front of me was just another example.

I went over to approach it, but Bear stopped me. He had jumped in front of me and growled for me to go the other way. It wasn't an aggressive growl, but more like he was warning me of something. I lowered myself and began to rub his head.

"It's ok Bear, I'm going to go get something to put that poor thing out of its misery, then I'll get a shovel to bury the rest of the cattle," I said, still completely confused, not knowing who or what did this.

I went back into the house to get my uncle's double-barreled shotgun. It was going to be a messy outcome for that cow, but a quick one. Just as I loaded the gun, I heard the sound of Bear snarling like a mad dog. I thought the culprit had come back to finish off the rest of the herd, so I ran out as fast as I could. I came back to Bear barking at nothing, like he just chose a direction and started to bark like a mad dog. I noticed that the snoutless cow wasn't there anymore and thought that it wandered off to die on its own. I felt bad, I was about to end its life quickly so it wouldn't have to suffer any longer. Just then I realized something.

"Did whatever do this come back for the other cow? Is that why Bear is acting like this?" I thought to myself as I looked in the direction Bear was barking at.

I put the shotgun away and went to get a shovel and some bear traps my uncle had in his shed. I was disappointed to see there was only one in the shed, to my knowledge I thought he had more, but one was better than none.

When I came back I put the bear trap aside and started digging Graves for the cattle, after which I would walk towards the tractor. Cows weigh a shit ton and I had a better chance at marrying a model than pushing one bare-handed. Bear followed me and jumped into the search next to me as I drove towards the bodies. The first two took effort to lift but were easy to move as I lowered them into the pre-dug graves, however, the last body was lifted without ease compared to the other two. I lowered it back to the ground and got out of the tractor, I could hear Bear growl slowly as I went to inspect the corpse.

I lowered myself and tried to lift the body, it was still heavy, but I could get it off the ground for a few seconds before giving in. I ended up dropping the body, making it topple to its side so it faced me. I was shocked when I saw it had no snout. I was sure that the only surviving cow had a snout missing, but that was nowhere to be seen. Upon further inspection, there was a very large slit down the cow's body, I brushed my fingers against it and saw that the slit opened like a purse. I gagged as I saw that there were no organs inside the corpse, only bone and muscle.

My first thoughts weren't "why did it have no organs?" or "what did this?", the thing I wanted to know the most was "If this corpse was the snoutless cow, where did the other body go?"

I got a sudden chill and stood up to check my surroundings. The atmosphere felt off. Just then, I flinched as I felt a drop of rain fall on my forehead, followed by a few more as the sky began to grow dark and shower the land. I finished burying the last corpse and took Bear with me inside, whatever work I had for the day could wait until tomorrow.

A few hours had gone by, but the rain didn't let up. It was even starting to thunder, which I didn't mind, but Bear whined and hid in a corner. His personality compared to earlier was like someone had flipped a light switch in his brain.

I fed both of us and was about to find a movie to watch, but the power went out. The only source of light I had at the moment was my phone, however, my uncle is prepared for times like this. I took a few candles from his closet and lit a few around the house. After lighting a third candle I looked at the rain through a window, I couldn't see much but darkness and the occasional flash of lightning.

I heard Bear whimper more and rubbed his back, letting him know that I'm here before I put a blanket around him. After dinner, I put my plate in the sink and thought of going to bed early, since there was nothing else to do. As I undressed I looked through the bedroom window. A flash of lightning showed that there was a figure near the cow's fence. I did a double-take, but couldn't see anything for a few seconds until the next flash of lightning struck. When it did, the figure had already been inside the fence, and the flash caught the moment it raised its arm and attacked a cow's throat.

"That must be the cow killer!" I thought as I ran out of the house. A dumb idea to run out during a storm, I know, but if I didn't catch this guy now, then I don't know when I could. I grabbed the double-barreled shotgun and made my way to where I last saw the figure. The only thing I found was a pool of blood with a trail leading away from the fence. The herd of cows within the fence mooed in fear as the adults surrounded the young.

I followed the trail for a few minutes before I stopped. I heard some sort of noise, like something wet and meaty being torn apart. I tried to listen to where the noise was coming from, but as the sound of thunder roared, it stopped. I held my breath.

Suddenly a flash of lightning struck and revealed the figure 20 meters away from me, it was hunched over one of the cows, eating it while it was still alive. Before the light faded I could barely recognize its appearance. It was a cow with a slitted throat. It began to slowly rise, like it knew how to stand up like a person. When the next flash of lightning struck it threw itself backwards and began to spider walk further away. I gasped and turned around, making a beeline back to the house with only the flashes of lightning to guide my way.

I couldn't hear if the thing was following me or not, but I wasn't going to risk looking back. The sound of Bear's barking guided my way to the house as I got closer. I would leap through the door and slam it shut, locking both locks on the door. Just as I did my legs finally gave in as I dropped to the floor, clutching the shotgun tightly against my wet, cold, bear chest.

I kept repeating "what was that!?" in my head for the next two minutes as I began to hyperventilate. When you see something your brain cannot comprehend, it tries to rationalize what it could logically be by filling in the gaps with what it already knows to try and make it make sense. However, there was nothing about what I just saw that made sense whatsoever. Bear's barking was replaced with a low growl as he headed towards me. He watched the door as I was slowly calming down.

"It's ok Bear, it's ok," I said to calm Bear down, but really it was to reassure myself.

I noticed Bear was slowly moving his head towards the window from the door. Then he got up and started walking along the wall like he was prowling side by side with whatever was outside. He stopped moving and raised his head quickly to the ceiling. At the same time, I felt the house shake a little with the sound of a large thud coming from the roof.

Bear must have lost the thing's position because he had spun around, trying to see where it was. It was silent after a few seconds. Bear was quiet. There weren't any sounds of footsteps on the roof, nothing, unless you count my heartbeat which quickened.

I decided to get up and try to hide in a room till this cow monster or whatever it was left. I didn't even take a second step when I heard a voice.

"Abby something"

"Abby something?" I thought.

"Abby normal"

It took me a few seconds but then I realized: it was a quote from Young Frankenstein, one of the movies I was watching last night. My blood went cold. 

"Was it outside the house the whole time?" The thought sent me into a panic.

"JESUS CHRIST" it screamed, setting Bear off. He had snarled and then ran towards the bedroom.

"Bear! Wait," I shouted as I followed after him.

Bear rammed his head into the door, forcing it open, and leapt towards the window. I stopped when I saw that the window was open, and a mixture of what looked like hooved fingers reached inside the house. Bright yellow lights appeared in the darkness outside. 

It was the cow monster's eyes. 

Bear had leaped towards the creature, forcing it to retreat as Bear went out the window and chased after it.

"Bear! Come back!" I shouted as I stuck my head out the window. I couldn't see where Bear was, but I heard the sound of his barks, and there was another sound. A laugh.

I didn't get any sleep that night. I locked myself in the bathroom and cried. I was worried about Bear and what that thing was. I prayed to god that Bear was ok and that he managed to drive off the cow monster. Morning came when the sound of a rooster crowing. I got dressed, armed myself with a hunting knife, my uncle's double-barreled shotgun, and left the house to search for Bear.

I went to the side of the house where the bedroom window would be. I found muddy tracks belonging to Bear and another pair of tracks I assumed belonged to the creature. I followed them for 5 miles, occasionally finding drops of blood mixed in with the mud, making me worry every second I couldn't find Bear.

After 30 minutes I found something I wasn't expecting. A pile of organs covered in mud and blood. I gagged from the smell and teared up when I thought they belonged to Bear. I turned my head to see that there were more tracks.

"There's still hope." I thought.

I followed the tracks for another 15 minutes and found the cow monster's corpse. I pulled out the hunting knife and stabbed it into its head. I've seen too many horror movies and didn't want to risk a sneak attack, but sure enough, it was dead.

I couldn't find any more footprints belonging to Bear, so I searched for another hour before giving up. I couldn't find any more clues leading to Bear's whereabouts, and I was upset and confused. It's almost like Bear just grew wings and disappeared. 

I wasn't in the mood to do anything all day. I know I had work to do, but I just couldn't. Bear was on my mind. I motivated myself to at least feed the livestock, after that, I just spent the rest of the time doing nothing.

When dinner time came I didn't eat. I had made food for Bear just in case the smell attracted him back. As I opened the door I fell back and dropped the food. Right in front of the house was Bear, sitting and staring at me.

"Bear!" I shouted as I ran over to hug him.

He felt off when I hugged him, it was like I was hugging a bag of dried-up leaves. I pulled away and looked at him, his face seemed off as well. His pupils were so delighted that it almost looked like he had no irises at all. He wasn't panting, and now that I think of it, I don't think he was breathing either.

"Hey, Bear?" I said, "Dinner is ready, come eat?"

As I walked inside I kept the door open for Bear so he could get inside. He just kept staring at me, not making any movements at all. 

"What's wrong? Are you coming?" I asked.

Bear just stayed where he was for another minute before coming inside. I picked up the food I had dropped as he made his way towards the bedroom, and I soon followed after when I had picked up all his food. When I entered the bedroom Bear was sitting in front of the open window where he had leaped out from last night. I closed it after putting his food bowl in front of him and went to make myself dinner.

The rest of the night was uneventful. After eating I went to bed early and woke up at 1:25 a.m.

I felt like I was being watched and looked around, but there was nobody there. The door was open and I assumed Bear was sleeping elsewhere. I shut my eyes and lowered myself back into bed so I could get comfy once more, when my head hit the pillows I would open my eyes. I screamed as I saw Bear standing on the ceiling.

He was positioned like a spider, waiting for its prey to get trapped in its web. I could see that his throat was slit, the same way the cows had their throats slit, I realized Bear didn't kill the cow monster, it had killed him and taken control of his body. The Bear-thing must've seen the look of horror on my face, because it had smiled in a way a dog could never smile, it was too human.

Suddenly a pair of hands exited Bear's slitted throat as he leaped down from the ceiling. They tried to grab my throat as Bear's mouth opened wide to bite my head. I took my pillow and smacked him with it, knocking him to the side of the bed as I ran out of the room. It wasn't long before Bear regained his footing and crawled all along the walls to chase after me.

The Bear-thing began to whine like it was hurt, but a pillow couldn't have done any damage. I tripped on a stack of movies and slammed my face into the wall, the Bear-thing jumped onto me and grabbed hold of my neck. Its mouth opened wider as the whine grew louder and more painful, I realized that it wasn't forming the sound from its mouth, it sounded like it was playing a recording, a recording of it gutting Bear alive. It was making me listen to Bear's final moments on repeat. 

"What are you!?" I shouted as I tried to loosen the hand's grip on my neck.

 The Bear-things' mouth had shut on my head, digging its teeth into my head and chin, I was engulfed in the darkness of its mouth. Suddenly, I saw the same bright yellow lights from last night, the eyes were coming from inside the Bear-things' mouth, they watched me as I struggled to free myself. I started to cry, I couldn't do anything else.

The whining continued and it set me off. I rammed my head deeper into the Bear-thing's mouth, its teeth dragged against my skull but it had also loosened its grip around my neck. I slammed my uncle's recliner on top of the monster, which gave me time to grab my car keys and run to my car. I had no time to grab my other things or anything to defend myself.

I slammed the car door shut and locked it before starting my car, I was able to get away few a bruised throat and a few scratches. I looked in my rear-view mirror to see something other than the Bear-thing, what I saw was an old naked woman. Her body was covered in a pattern of blood that looked like it was ritualistic, she was also wearing what looked like a wolf skin rug on her body, covering her head, back, and arms.

My stomach turned as I realized that the wolf skin rug she was wearing was Bear, she had skinned him and wore him like one of those Laplander animal hats. I was on the verge of a panic attack as I saw the woman get on all fours and slowly transform into my deceased dog. She ran opposite of me. I lost sight of her after a minute and just as I did, I let all my emotions out, the tears in my eyes blocked my view of the road. I blacked out as I hit a large rock and crashed, nearly throwing myself out of my car.

I woke up in a hospital bed, apparently my uncle had recovered from his surgery and was on his way home when he saw me in my wrecked car. I was asleep for three days, the whole time he stayed by my side until I woke up.

He had all sorts of questions he wanted to ask me, I thought about my answers carefully. I thought nobody would believe my experience at the ranch and about the woman that wore animal skins and became them, so I told my uncle that a wild cougar had attacked me at his home and killed some of his livestock, including my dog Bear.

My uncle was saddened from the losses, but was just thankful I was alive. I stayed in the hospital a few more days, my uncle never leaving my side. He drove me home after I recovered, it was the last time I would see him alive.

I sit here writing about my experience a few days after I attended my Uncle Shag's funeral. His ranch had caught on fire, I think he had been visited by the woman just like I had, and defended himself the best he could. My heart is filled with nothing but guilt and regret, I kept thinking that I should've told the truth, even if it would've sounded insane. I mean, would you believe me?

I wonder though, when the woman visited him, was it Bear, or some other animal whose skin she was wearing? I don't know... I just wish I could see Uncle Shag and Bear to tell them both I'm sorry, sorry that I didn't tell the whole story to my uncle and sorry I couldn't protect Bear.

There's nothing more I can say. Just to whoever reads this... If you see an animal with a slitted throat, run before it's too late.

The End
