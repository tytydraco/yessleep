I'm an 18 year old female and have stopped babysitting since this incident. I've started other jobs, and managed to exceed the amount I needed by babysitting. 


Okay, for a bit of context, I usually babysit for those in the wealthier side of our town. The reason being that they usually have a lot more to pay, and (in my personal experience) there's a less likely chance to come across sketchy looking homes. Usually, they're well kept and seem normal. They can, usually, hide anything off about them. Well, before I was to babysit for the Jamesons. The Jameson's were an odd family, and they always have been. I've grown up around them, in the same neighbourhood, and my mom had always told me to never talk to them or go near them. I never fully understood why, but now I do. 

It was sometime around December of 2022, and I had just recently turned 17. It was 12PM-ish, and their mother had come over to ask if I could babysit her kids. Now, that wouldn't have been a problem, but it's the fact that her and her husband have 12 kids. I forgot to mention, but I don't usually babysit for people who have more than 3 or 4 kids. However, they offered to pay more than I've ever been offered; $230,000. Honestly, I was taken aback a bit.. like, $230,000!? I knew they were wealthy, but not THAT wealthy. When I grew up around them, they lived in the poorer area. My father, mother, and I did too. I stood there for a moment before accepting, but I eventually did. "Great, see you tomorrow at 4." She said, while sliding down our driveway between fences in an almost phantom like manner. 

I stood there in absolute shock. Again.. $230,000???! But, I closed the front door and walked to my mom. She was sitting the kitchen table, but I realized that she hadn't moved since we all woke up. The only reason I hadn't noticed was because I took a shower, walked the dog, and brushed my teeth. Her back was turned to me, and she was changing this morning, so I was sure there was nothing off. I walked up to her, and tapped her shoulder. Just as I did, I felt a hand on my shoulder. It was my momâ€”but who did I just tap? I turned around to look at who was sitting there, and there was no one. Am I insane? Am I going insane? I confronted her about it, and she told me that she was never down here. It was her first time coming downstairs, and that she saw me standing in the middle of her room. I was facing away from her just like she had been facing away from me prior to that. Were we both going insane? Maybe, maybe not. 

The next day came, and so did 4. As I was heading on over, I turned on my location for everyone, and let everyone know that if I wasn't responding by 7 or 8; something was wrong and to call the cops, immediately. I had finally arrived at their door. I knocked on it and was, immediately, greeted by Mrs. Jameson. She seemed to have been in a rush, and I noticed Mr. Jameson wasn't with her at all. I asked where he was, and she didn't answer. All she did was look at the ground as she turned extremely pale. That was so off putting, but I sort of brushed it off. It was a 15 or so minute walk from there to my house. She, eventually, realized how she was acting and continued acting as hurried as she had been before. "Feed the kids, make sure to leave before the last candle burns out, and don't listen to any sounds from the house." She said, before leaving and driving off in a hurry. 

I walked through the door, and I could tell that something was off. Was it the smell? Was it the feeling of being in a home that felt and looked empty? Where were the kids? I called out for the kids, and only 5 came. They were just as pale as their mother had been, only their eyes were more noticeable. They were droopy, and had heavy eye bags. I'm not one to judge about eyebags, as I have them myself. It was quite alarming. I heard thumping from upstairs and saw the other 7 kids running down while acting jittery and looking just had the other kids and their mother. 

I made dinner, had them go take baths, and brush their teeth. It was only about 7 or so, so I let them stay up for a bit before taking them upstairs to tuck them in. Their house was relatively large, as each of them has their own rooms and their rooms were as big as a school gym (imo, that's a lot). As I was finishing, I received a text asking if I had left yet. 

I had completely forgot about the fact that she told me to leave before dark. I had called my mom to come pick me up, as I didn't want to walk in the dark. The house was dark, and I had cleaned earlier. When it hit 8, I heard every child lock their doors. It spooked me, and I texted my mom to hurry up. "On My Way!" She texted back, but as I went to turn my phone off, I heard the door to the parents room slam open. I immediately ran to hide under the stairs, as it has two doors on both sides and one down the middle on the front and back. I ran to the one that takes the farthest to run to. I shut it quietly and waited. It's not easy to hear anything, even if you're right under the stairs. As I was listening intently for anything, my phone rang. Well, not rang. Just showed up that someone was calling, but it was silent. I put it on silent earlier that day. It was my mom. I answered and there was a long pause from the other end. I whispered "Mom..?" to the other end. There was screaming, and I was sure it was my moms. Then, there was more screaming. This time, it was scraggly, and hoarse.. so loud it sounded like a whisper. "I told you to leave before dark." The voice said. Just then, while backing up, I bumped into something. I used my flashlight to see what it was. Nothing ever couldve prepared me for what I saw. 

It was my mom.. well, what was left of her. It seems she had been dead for nearly 10 years. I started to cry quietly. How was this my mom? Is this real? As all of these questions were running through my head, I heard the voice on the other line. This time, it was different.. It was my moms. It was her telling me to get out of there. I didn't know if I should or not. I asked if it was her, and it was a demonic scream. It was as if it were being burned. "I found you" was the last I heard it say, as the skeleton in front of me started to move.
