“Depressive disorder. That’s what you’re going through. Don’t make me repeat this.”

“But I’m telling you, that’s not my case here. I know my body, and I’m certain your pills aren’t working.”

The doctor scratched his head, yawning. A rusty name tag on his gown slowly oriented upwards as his chest started to swell. It read: Dr. Edward – Psychiatrist. He stared at me for a while and continued.

“I’ve treated more than twenty soldiers with the same disease, so please, do not worry. I know exactly what I’m dealing with.”

Before I could contradict, a blond nurse who had been sitting next to the doctor chimed in with her frail, husky voice.

“Mr. Rider, as a former officer and operator of a special unit, you must have gone through many hardships throughout your career. You are not only mentally unstable, but also physically ruined as well. Some good rest is what your body needs right now.”

I sighed. These morons didn’t even care to listen. I’ve been suffering from nightmares for the past week or so, and they weren’t just any random nightmares. All of them held horrific scenes of me committing murder, slaughtering every living creature I happened to come across. I would suddenly feel this irresistible urge to kill… and despite trying my best not to do so, I always ended up covered with the victim’s blood.

“I’m leaving. I’ve had enough of your monotonous feedback.”

I stood up and marched towards the door. The nurse followed immediately and grabbed my arms, handing me the useless pills.

“Sir, it is you who came to our hospital for help in the first place, and it is our duty to take care of you. You are extremely unstable right now, so please, listen to our advice.”

“Well,” I snarled. “I came to this hospital because my wife told me that a prominent psychiatrist was working here, but she must have been mistaken. What I’m going through is nothing close to depression. This is the fourth time I’ve been having that same bloody nightmare.”

The doctor replied blankly. “How many times do I have to tell you? It is most likely your experience in Iraq and Afghanistan that has been triggering them.”

Oh god. It’s that dumb theory of PTSD again, I muttered.

“Being a member of the advance party, you must have killed a whole lot of opposing forces during your operations, whether you liked it or not, and that memory is now changing its form into a sense of guilt and regret. That is what is causing your depression, which is a surprisingly common phenomenon among soldiers. Do you have any other questions?”

“You’re pathetic,” I spat out. “and so are these pills. They aren’t doing shit. I’m done with your hospital.”

I slammed the door shut and drove my way home.

That night, I had a dream. It was *the* dream, but this time, I had a relatively clear vision of my surroundings. I was in a huge, dark living room with a golden chandelier hanging underneath the ceiling next to a spiral staircase. For some reason, the place seemed strangely familiar. To look around and see if I could remember anything, I started heading upstairs when I saw something bizarre. An antique clock hanging on the wall was ticking backward.

Then, a middle-aged woman wearing a dental mask appeared in front of me, as if she had suddenly teleported into the living room. The moment I saw her, my body jumped forward, both hands reaching out for her throat. I felt my fingernails dig deep into her veins.

“Sa…rah.. hold…..” she whispered.

‘Stop,’ I begged. ‘Please stop. Don’t do this, Ken. For once, please just stop! She’s trying to tell you something!’ But I couldn’t take control over my body.

“What?! What did you just say??” I yelled inside, desperately trying to hear the woman.

“Sarah,” She gasped. "I’m… Sarah Holden..”

A few seconds later, her entire body went limp, and a heavy gush of dark blood started leaking from her throat. My heart thumping heavily, I slowly removed the tattered mask away from her face and froze. That’s when it struck me: Sarah Holden was the name of my ex-girlfriend I had been dating a few years ago before meeting my wife, and there she lay, right in front of me with her eyes bulging, gagging for breath. I sat there, stupefied, trying to convince myself that this was all just a dream, that I *knew* it was a dream, and that I’d soon wake up from this disastrous nightmare when I heard an unexpected voice right behind me.

**“Make sure you finish it quickly. Tonight’s your best chance.”**

I recognized it immediately. It was the husky voice of the tall, blond nurse from the hospital. I tried to warn her to run away from me, that I would turn into a killing machine the moment I saw her, but suddenly a severe headache exploded inside my brain. My vision started fading, and after a short while, I fell unconscious.

When my surroundings came into view again, the first thing I saw was the diamond floor tile of my psychiatric ward. I could tell that I was lying face-down in the narrow corridor of the hospital, still unable to move. Every ounce of my body was like an anchor hauling me to the ground. The nurse spoke again, this time inside the clinic room I was lying next to.

**“Ma’am, you do realize that this isn’t an easy commission, right? Her husband is a director of a famous company…”**

My head was throbbing miserably. The pain was unreal. I tried to yell out for help but to my dismay found myself unable to budge a muscle. Then I heard another voice in the clinic room that instantly sent chills running through my spine.

**“This should be the last one. She’s a dentist named Sarah Holden and here’s her profile. I want the job done until Wednesday.”**

It was my wife, Amanda. Why was she here and what was she talking about? And why on earth was *I* here, waking up in a hospital miles away from home when I had fallen asleep in my room? As if hinting for an answer, my wristwatch appeared in the corner of my vision. The watch, a gift from my secret mistress Amy, was ticking backward. So, this too was a dream. Just another dream…


\- - -


“en…! Ken!!! Are you okay???”

Amanda was shaking me awake. I flew out of bed. It took quite a while to take in what had just happened. Sarah. Amanda. The nurse. All just a bloody dream.

“Oh my god, you’re soaked with sweat. It was the same nightmare, wasn’t it?” she asked, looking worried. “Is this like your fifth time or something?”

“Don’t know,” I mumbled, unable to recover from the disturbing after-sensation of the dream.

“Honey, maybe you should take a bath.” Amanda suggested. “I’ll make you some hot stew.”

I waddled into the bathtub for a morning bath which was one of my older routines I used to take while I was on active duty. It was my ritual of starting a day fresh. Waiting for the tub to be filled, I turned on the waterproof TV inside the bathroom for some news.


*<The new version of C++ available online – download this app on your phone for free…>*

Wow, what a boring advertisement. I slouched inside the tub and switched to the next channel.


*<Edward Howling, a world-famous psychiatrist, performs a new type of hypnotherapy in his seminar, this time with his newly invented pill…>*

Hmm. So maybe he was indeed a prominent doctor after all. I found the issue mildly captivating and was also curious as to how the freak would present himself outside of his hospital, so I decided to check out what he had to say.

“This pill gives the doctor *complete* control over the patient’s body, making it extremely handy during sophisticated surgeries or when dealing with violent patients.” The old man growled eagerly. “I’m trying my best to remain humble here, but in the industry, this is considered as the new level of innovation.”

I recognized the damn pill right away, for it was the very pill the hospital had been suggesting persistently as a solution to my mental disease. Then, he was asked a critical question.

“Now we’d like to hear more about its downside and potential side effects. Would there be any?”

The disgusting smile that had been lingering around his face the whole time slowly disappeared. He scratched his beard for a few seconds as if checking whether it was okay to release the information. Then came his answer.

“Well, theoretically, it could be possible for some patients to sense a mild disruption of their timeline while receiving their treatments. So, for example, they might interpret event A to precede event B when it’s actually the other way around.”

The crowds at the seminar started murmuring. “But don’t worry,” the doctor added. “for I expect such phenomenon to be extremely rare. Furthermore, the patients won’t be able to remember a thing after they wake up anyway.”

Wait, what? A rewind of timeline? Before I could fully comprehend it, the seminar was over and the next news filled the TV screen.


*<Breaking News: A tragedy for the Holdings Company – a director’s wife found murdered in her house last night with her ring finger cut off…>*

I sat straight up. Holdings was the company where Sarah’s husband worked as a director. The news continued: <…the rupture of the carotid artery being the immediate cause of death.>

My heart sank. All I could do was blink. From that moment on, I don’t remember how much time had passed; it was the ringing of my phone that brought me back to reality. My best friend at uni had sent me a text.

\[Brian 8:21 AM\]

\[Hey, why didn’t you attend Laura’s funeral?\]


I doubted my eyes. Laura was my ex-ex-girlfriend during college, someone I had dated in my senior year. What the hell was going on? Was this all a bad joke? A large scale prank, maybe? For a while, I couldn’t breathe. How come she was dead too…? I replied with trembling hands.

\[What??? She passed?? I didn’t have a clue. When was the funeral held?\]


\[Brian 8:22 AM\]

\[Just a few days ago, I thought you knew. She was a big-time model, remember? Her death was so horrible that it was the talk of the town… Did you not watch the news?\]

I searched her name online to see what he meant.

*<July 7, Laura Elizabeth Chu hacked to death and found by the neighbors with her ring finger nowhere to be found..>*

Suddenly, a critical piece of information popped into my mind. July 7 was the date I had my fourth nightmare. I forced myself to adjust to the fact. My recent nightmares. My ex-girlfriends found killed their ring fingers detached. The clock ticking backward. The pills. The hospital. Amanda, Edward, and the nurse. A theory started forming in my mind that soon turned to conviction.

Then, another text message buzzed my phone. This time, it wasn’t from Brian.


\[Amy 8:25 AM\]

\[Hey Baby, I bought you the Balenciaga shirt you wanted for our anniversary, but you seem busy today. I’ll just leave it by your house for you to pick it up after work. Have a nice day. :)\]

No, no, no! You can’t come here now, I pleaded. Not when Amanda’s here with me! I had to tell Amy to go back. I called her and she picked up right away, but a high, petrifying voice stopped me from talking on the phone. Amanda was calling me. Her voice came from right outside the bathroom door, so I hung up immediately.

“Honey, who is Amy?” she asked in a tone that required a cautious reply. I had to be very careful here.

“Um… what do you mean?” I stuttered, trying to buy some time. Was she somehow aware of Amy’s presence? Or had Amy already arrived? How much did she know?

“I saw it written in your watch, Amy - Ken. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?”

This time, the tone was closer to a screech than a question, and my brain was lucky enough to come up with a seemingly plausible excuse in time.

“Oh, that’s a.. a name of a brand. You see, it’s AMYKEN, not Amy & Ken.” But I was trembling and my voice was giving it away. I had to sound confident. “You can check it out for yourself if you want.”

Silence replied. Amanda wasn’t saying anything. Nor was she walking away from the bathroom. What was she doing? Was she seriously googling AMYKEN? For about ten seconds which felt like a decade, her silence strangled me. Then came her reply.

“…Alright. Your stew is almost ready. Tell me when you’re done washing.”

The moment I heard her leave, I sighed and texted Amy to go back, to never come near my house until I told her it was okay. I was anxiously waiting for her reply and was relieved to receive it within a few minutes.


\[Amy 8:30\]

\[Thanks, honey. I’ll be with you forever. \^\_\^\]

After somehow managing to go through the crisis undetected, I began to feel dizzy. My eyelids were heavy despite having awoken barely an hour ago. I just wanted to go back to bed, but I knew that closing my eyes right now might drag me to sleep forever. Who knows what Amanda might do to me if I lay here in the tub, completely vulnerable?

‘She’s planning something. Something of a scale beyond what I can imagine. My exes surely aren’t the end of what she’s been preparing.’

I stood up, slapped my face hard, and told myself, “Make sure, Ken, to never give it away. Don’t let her know that you have grasped the gist of what she has been doing with you for the past couple of days.”

&#x200B;

“Well, it took you some time to get out of that tub. The stew’s gotten a bit cold now.” Amanda was waiting for me in the dining room.

“Don’t worry, I’ll just eat it as it is.”

“Honey, your face.. it’s so pale… and your lips are still trembling.. You should try the stew and see if it makes you feel better.”

In front of me lay a bowl of squishy pale-brown stew that looked very much like thick, slimy beef bone soup. But its smell told me otherwise. I slowly picked up the spoon and stirred it. Some bones clacked underneath.

“Sure. What kind of stew is this?” I asked.

“It’s made of something you love.” Replied a smile. “Come on, take a sip. I’m sure it will suit your taste.”

I stirred the stew again, this time taking a closer look. There was a thin, pinkish-white layer hovering above. I ladled a spoonful to take a sniff. The scent reminded me of a familiar scene.

“Do you not feel like eating?” The smile on her face had suddenly disappeared. She was examining me closely.

“Oh, I was just wondering what the ingredients were. I mean, I’ve never seen a stew this - “

“THEN EAT IT!!!” She screeched. For a split second, her face seemed to be contorted with anger. But she was smiling again, this time a wider smile, as if nothing had happened.

“You asked about the ingredients, so I’ll tell you. It took me about a week to prepare them, and I can guarantee this: you’ll love every single one of them.”

I shoved the spoon inside my mouth. Along with the soup, I felt something small and hard slither inside. A strange flavor started to spread within my throat, an extension of the scent I had taken a sniff of. What was it? After feeling it for a while with my tongue, I munched on it and almost threw up immediately. A sting of bitterness shot through my tongue and into my body. It tasted like a mixture of chemicals and plastic. It tasted like… *nail polish.* The memory of visiting a famous nail shop last week with Amy flashed through my head. So… was this thing inside the stew a fingernail…?

Then, I realized Amanda was wearing a red Balenciaga shirt. She was wearing her apron in front of it, but there was no way I couldn’t recognize the model. It was the same one Amy had promised me. My blood seemed to flow backward.

“Is it good?”

I nodded, unable to swallow the rest of what was remaining inside my mouth. Pretending to drink the cup of water that had been placed next to the bowl, I held the cup to my mouth and slowly spat out the gush of filth with caution.

*“See? I knew you’d love it. As I said, the entire ingredient is made of what you love or used to love.”*

“Th.. thanks. This really is–“ I hiccupped, “- unlike anything I’ve ever tasted before…”

Amanda reached out towards me, holding a napkin. With it, she started wiping my mouth when something glittered. It was a ring. No, rings. She was wearing five of them, all on her left ring finger. My eyes fixed on the ferocious reflection of light from her finger, I wobbled up. I was seconds away from throwing up, and I had to keep it from her.

“Hey, where are you going? Don’t tell me you’re done eating.”

“I’ll be quick,” I croaked, waving my phone. “An important call from work.”

I stumbled into the bathroom, locked the door, and lifted the toilet cover. Trying my best not to make any noise, I let out a gush of some disgusting liquid and saliva. After a few minutes, I felt better and decided to call one of my friends to pretend to be on the phone with my peers at work. That’s when I saw it. I had received a text message from Amanda.

&#x200B;

It read:

\[Amanda 9:43 AM\]

\[Ken. Why did you spit it out?\]
