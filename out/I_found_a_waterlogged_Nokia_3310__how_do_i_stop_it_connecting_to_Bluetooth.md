sorry i didn't pick up sooner, i know, i'm trying, I didn't mean to run away but i'm safe, I got fired and i panicked and I thought

No i'm okay, yeah no it's fine, i get it.

I'm at my parents house in Lincolnshire currently, they left for work maybe a few hours ago but honestly I was asleep.

It's okay. I think once I sell this thing I'll be better. I've already drafted the listing online but it keeps getting taken down.

I guess it was the little blue plastic that caught my eye, it was sticking out of the mud from the side of the bank, unmistakable between the shitty water, sepia mud, and rotting grass.

I don't know if you've ever been to Lincolnshire. There's not much to see.

No, sorry, that was a bit harsh. It's pretty in it's own way, but I was here half my childhood, so the prettiness smudged off. Sometimes I think it's left me with purely the bitterness. I spent so much of my life here trying to escape it that I never really appreciated the twisted prettiness of it.

There is beauty here I guess. A lonely beauty of emptiness. The shops are mostly gone now, the high-street is empty. The Georgian, beautiful facades that used to hold bakeries and coffee shops, little newsagents and antiques are now melded into rows of grotesque purple & green vape shops with magenta lighting.

Have you ever seen those paintings? There was a 17th century artist i saw once in a museum.

She used to draw these beautiful still life paintings of fruits and flowers, beautiful ripening fruit, and flowering buds.

But below them, painted to the same beautiful detail would be dead and dying exotic birds, still beautiful in a way; bright coats of amber and lilac, but still and rotting, flies \[illegible\] carcasses.

This town evokes that same feeling, that same weird beauty.

It's just devoid of things. There's no hills to look out on, even when you get out of the city it's just fields, canals, and little dispersed bits of wood & nature clinging to life between the empty new builds and encroaching pointless developments. It's strange, but there's a wildness to those areas that you don't see in the rest of the UK. You get a dread that comes over you when you approach a larger bit of wood especially, it's this feeling in the back of your head that you can't escape, a question that noiselessly forms towards the wood.

*Why are you still here?*

And sometimes, through the wind, the whistles and straining of the branches, I sometimes used to think that I could make out a crackling, hoarse call in response.

*Interloper*.

I guess that's why I noticed the phone on my jog. There's what i like to call a crossing, a few miles from my parents house. It's one of those spots. You go from a vast metal fence on your left, protecting the docked canal boats from intrusions and a construction site, empty and abandoned on your right.

The paved concrete pathway suddenly gives way to dirt.

And all of a sudden, flanking your sides are willows and oaks, branches on either side winding and weaving themselves into 8ft tall hallways. Rather than canal boats and metal fences, the canal lifts, the corners smudge. The roots of the trees on the left poke out into the water, the trees tilting more and more until they too disappear.

Just past a collapsed willow was where I saw the Nokia. Half buried in the silty mud, it's casing was caked, but it seemed to still be intact. I don't particularly love old tat, but I always find something disgusting with litter covering the beauty of the last small bits of unspoiled nature, so I picked it up, wiped off the mud as much as i could, wrapped it in a bundle of larger leaves, and placed it in my pocket.

As soon as I did, the weight of the phone almost felt comforting. There was something exciting that drew me out of the hollowness of the town.

I started my journey back home, looking for a half empty bin on the way where i could stuff the rubbish tat in.

It was then when I felt my smart-watch vibrate.

A new device has registered.

Hi all - i think i may have found a collectors item, just wanted to check if anyone has any idea how much this thing might be worth? It's a slightly beaten up Nokia 3310, but i think it's special. It seems to have a bunch of other features and here's the kicker, it's got Bluetooth!

The Nokia 3310 never had Bluetooth.
