When trials become overwhelming or even overly gentle, he recalled that moment. Not to ruin his joy or rob him of the current experience, but to put himself above what stood before him. That tragic moment steadied him, despite its subtle yet pervasive mental torment. Drawing upon that experience of great suffering to lessen the burden of current trials did proved useful. Yet, relying on that pain to diminish every moment of his existence began to weigh heavily upon him. When it did, he could see her burning.

As his imagination took over, the bearded man watched the burning woman laughing mockingly in the corner of the establishment. It was only when a voluptuous lady came out to claim him that the vision ceased. She lead the bearded man through a broad room and down a corridor and took off his cloak handing it to a woman aside holding a lantern. Waving the her away, the lady took the man by the hand, ushering him through a chamber of individuals engaged in luscious exploration. 

A cluster of naked women and men smile as they pushed through groups of people, then passing through a curtain into a quiet room. As the two embrace, they begin peeling off each other’s clothes, transitioning into a lengthy session of drawn-out animalistic intimacy.
Later exhausted, the woman slid off the man and gently collapsed beside him. She held her gaze on him with a question bubbling. 

“You were just in high spirits, and now you’re blankly staring at ceiling on the brink of tears? Was it so dire or so wondrous?”

The man rolled to his side propping up his head, “It had never not been wondrous. It is that I must guard against too much elation. It is believed that too much physical exertion and emotional solace could sap a warrior’s strength and vigor.”

Following his lead, the woman propped her head up with the opposite arm to directly face him, “How would one shift their mood so swiftly?” 

“Certain thoughts can do the trick,” the bearded man pulled her closer.

“Pray tell, so you conjure these thoughts to temper your joy? Is becoming overly elated, even in such a place, truly so grievous?” the woman asked, pressing her naked figure against him.

“A warrior must master his emotions. I can temper my feelings,” the man lifted the blanket looking down at his wee member, “But I cannot quell the beast within.”

The pair kiss passionately as the man lifted the woman effortlessly, laying her gently on the other side of the bed.

Shortly after another encounter, the man sat in bed with his hands locked behind his head. The lady rested her head on the man's left pec, tracing patterns with her finger, bubbling with more questions.

"None would desire a woman who cannot bear children, save those who plan to be unfaithful from fearful of commitment. My suspicion grows on you," the woman canted her head up towards the man. “You know, you’re still the only man I’ve ever shared a bed with within the past year? Maybe more.”
“—And I shall find the coin each night to ensure that it remains so,” the man interrupted. “I will not allow you to break your vow to your sister. Yes, you work at a pleasure house, but your days as a whore is over.”

She raised, sitting herself on the edge of the bed with her back to the man, “The vow to my sister… What she did to you was unforgivable. You don’t owe her anything. Besides, it’ll take eons to pay off my family’s debt with you as my sole patron. How will you find the means to rent me all day every day?”

“Assisting you to uphold that vow in never selling your body again is for you, not her. Do not fret my love, upon completion of a new task I have been appointed, neither of us shall have a need for coin for many years.”

“Are not both still wed? You help me abide by my vow to her but break your own?” 
The man lowered his gaze, “One cannot break what was already shattered.” 

The woman had a briefly moment of silence, letting the spoken words resonate before asking, “So, what formidable task is has the King bestowed upon you now?”

“I have to transport a prisoner in exchange for fifty gold and thirty silver pennies.”

“That is an astronomical sum of money! You must be moving someone truly perilous.”

“Aye,” the man turns away uncomfortable. “She who ensnares.”

The woman turned away as well, putting her hand up to hide the ugliness of her pain. She started to walk away in discuss until the man spoke again.

"Be suspicious not my love. I do not fear commitment, and I shall provide you with a child, whether it be from your own womb or by the stork’s grace."

Beyond the castle walls laid a road heading to the heart of oblivion, a path that none among the dwellers dared tread. It began wide at the castle's edge but narrowed to a meager trail winding through dense thickets. When dread began to prowl, he turned to that moment again. That moment he thought of in order to forget everything else. This time, the welcomed darkness conjured her beneath a distant barren tree, her garments surrendering to the flames flickering in the wind. 
As he watched her burn, the apprehension melted into a sadness that made him forget all else. He blankly stood in introspection until the Hand of the King approached him from behind, an elderly man in shiny armor and a long white beard.

“Sir Gizzards—the man discovered beneath a spilled cauldron of gizzards after single-handedly slaughtering an entire coven of witches. The very knight who was instantly dubbed after putting an end to the Heretical Hysteria that plagued our city. Are you well?”

The man, known as Sir Gizzards, stumbled on his words, “Yea I just — I’m well thank you.” 

The elderly gentleman sized up Sir Gizzards from head to toe in unrestrained awe before his gaze settled on the knight’s metal gauntlets. They were a marvel of intricate design with ambiguous aesthetics, from the complex arrangement of tiny interconnected gears to the metal bars and springs lodge in its gold lining. The contraption had the old geezer stricken, “I see the king chose well for this task. Well, here we will wait for the rest of the folk who will be accompanying you on your journey.”

First, a dwarf wielding a bow and arrow came strolling from the gates, known for his extensive knowledge of the terrain. Next, a medic appeared, wearing a mask with round glass eyes and a long beak, skilled in the art of dual-wielding mallets. Following him was a voluptuous woman of barbarous presence, adorned in animal fur with a long-curved blade, presumed to provide additional muscle. Lastly, a shaman, a lanky figure in a ceremonial robe and feathered hat, came to offer his spiritual knowledge and protection from the prisoner at hand.

Once everyone was in attendance, the shaman took charge to explain the dangers of the prisoner.

“Unlike physical assaults, the prisoner targets the victim’s mind and soul directly. The effects may range from conjuring illusions to manipulating the victim’s actions or even inflicting mental torment. Does everyone have an anchor-thought like we individually discussed?”

Everyone nods before the shaman continued, “Good. I wish to be perfectly clear—do not forget it. God forbid one of us fall prey to one of her enchantments, thou will need an anchor to reality—something to draw you back before madness takes over. I have placed a seal upon the prisoner’s cage, so it is unlikely that it shall come to that, but ’tis better to be cautious than regretful.”

The team of five set off on their journey towards the rising sun. The prisoner was shackled and confined in a small cart with a piece of parchment affixed to one of the bars. The page was densely packed with a multitude of word, cramped from edge to edge. The prison cart was drawn by a horse on which the dwarf, due to his stubby legs, had mounted as agreed. The short man would occasionally glance at the towering woman walking beside him, offering furtive winks as the others pretending not to notice.

After traveling for miles, the group decided to settle on a green knoll. Placing his finger in his mouth and then raising it to the sky, the dwarf spoke, “We should rest here for night.” As he offered his advice, he took one more gander at the amazonian-like woman as the last sliver of sunlight faded before his eyes.

“Let your anchor-thought be last thing you think of before going to sleep,” the shaman warned, igniting a fire with a piece of flint and steel.

Sir Gizzards reclined against a great boulder; his feet crossed nonchalantly. The doctor sat upright, their mask still in place and the black cloak cascading on the ground. On the other side of the fire sat the shaman resting in apparent slumber, seated in a half-lotus posture. The dwarf laid beside the horse, ensuring he had a clear view of the built woman resting in the grass, the side of her face pressed to the ground and her broad, well-defined rear end lifted toward the sky.

All was well and peaceful before the dwarf suddenly woke. He rose with his eyes still closed, shambling towards the cart. He tore off the paper from the bars, waking the prisoner known as She Who Ensnares. The dark silhouette of a striking young woman sat up inside the cage, guiding the group’s navigator on top of her into an unspeakable position.

“Dwarf!” the shaman bellowed, almost staggering into the campfire.

The stout man’s eyes widened abruptly as though he were emerging from a trance. He canted his head towards the shaman, then lowered his gaze to his own hands loosening his breeches. Beneath him lay the striking figure that is now an old woman with long white hair, her face dominated by deep sunken eyes. She gazed up at the dwarf with a toothy grin and her legs splayed open, her knees drawn up to her chest.

The dwarf leaped from the cage just as the door, seemingly of its own accord, slammed shut with an aggressive swing. The shaman hastened to apply another seal on the door, fortifying the entrapment. He then demanded the group to gather around the fire. Everyone, groggy, dazed, and fear stricken, looked towards the dwarf, expectant of some kind of explanation. He looked back at everyone else with an expression glazed with sweaty confusion.

The shaman circled around the group with slow deliberate steps, his hand clasped behind his back. “Besides the short man, did everyone have a nightmare?” the group nodded in unison before the shaman went on. “Very well. As you can see, my seals are not infallible, which is why I instructed everyone to remember their anchor-thought.” 
He paused, casting a patronizing stare at the short man before continuing his discourse, “Now, we shall go around the circle, each stating their name, recounting the nightmare they endured, and sharing their anchor-thought, starting with myself.”
The shaman stopped in place, “I am referred to as Mayan. My entire lineage are shamans, including my father and his ancestors before him. The nightmare I endured was of a demon, whose name is forbidden by the naked tongue. It compelled me to witness the torment of my own kin. Only when my anchor-thought, my son, appeared on a steed donning gleaming armor did my nightmare transform into a dream.”

Everyone turned towards the doctor, “I am called Clara. I hail from a lineage of assassins and sought to break the chain, hence my choice of the hammer over the daggers, and thus my pursuit in medicine. My nightmare was being stabbed in the belly. My anchor-thought,” Clara unveils her cloak, revealing a small baby bump. “Is her forthcoming birth.”

The dwarf rose, “Alaric is my name. I am the sole dwarf in my family, born with the stigma of a bastard since day one. Being a renowned navigator stemmed from my youth spent in fleeing home so often. To be brief, my nightmare was of falling through endless darkness, with the never-ending sense that I would soon strike the ground. I was caught by my anchor-thought, my wife. The moment she grasped me, we lay together in passion, which might explain,” his gaze falls in embarrassment. “I beg pardon—I sometimes wander in my sleep when troubled by such lustrous dreams. She passed not long ago but remains ever in my heart. With her ample bosom, round backside, and a form grander than the mightiest men—she was truly a beauty, much like this lady here.” Alaric gestured towards the tall woman, and both blushed.

“Nara is what they call me. I hail from a land where women hold dominion, and men are relegated to roles of cooking, cleaning, and procreating. In my homeland, mating was a mere duty, unaccompanied by companionship. Thus, when my sisters discovered me indulging in pleasure with the one I held dear, I was faced with a grim choice: to witness his slow demise at their hands or swiftly by my own. I ensured it was quick and painless. He was stout and strong, like gristle, shorter than most men—but truly a beauty, much like this man here.” Nara blushed as she nodded toward the dwarf, who offered a faint smirk.

A strong silence pressed at the end of her sentence as Sir Gizzards stared intently into the campfire.

“Come now,” the shaman prodded. “This exercise serves to keep us alive. Begin by revealing your true name at the very least.”

“My one and only true name is Sir Gizzards,” the man said, keeping his eyes on the flames. “Once the seal that barely held the first time comes off again, there is nothing more we can do. These anchor-thoughts are but perceived protection—an ease of mind for a likely death if the direction of our planning plummets once more.”

The shaman intervened, “Unless you prefer to spend your final moments thrusting inside that bag of bones, a demise the dwarf was sure to have, you must give your cooperation!”

Sir Gizzards looked to the prisoner and responded, “My nightmares are the anchors which bind me back to reality. I can’t be drawn from a madness in which I already dwell.”

Although silent, the shift in tension was abrupt and dramatic. As Sir Gizzard’s words hung in the air with the crackling of the campfire, the shaman’s reaction oddly turned from surprised to confused. Trembling as if attempting to speak, the left side of his face began to droop. He took a few steps forward and stumbled over his unsteady gait. Falling to one knee with unfocused eyes, Mayan precariously pointed to the horse and wagon.

“Shaman? Are you well?” 

Ignoring questions and concerns from the group, the shaman charged forward mounting the horse with a sudden, inexplicable speed. He glanced back with eyes as white as moonlit frost, then hastened away. 

Alaric, instinctually drew back his bowstring, tracing the air with the tip of an arrow. Unleashing the projectile into the running horse’s jugular, the animal plummeted into the ground, trapping the shaman’s now fractured knee. 

When the hag fell with the cage, its door side towards the ground, color returned to Mayan’s eyes as though he were reclaiming his mental steadiness. Through sheer wit, he forced the trapped limb free from under the horse, each second agonizing as broken bones scraped and dislocated. Regaining his composure on his good knee, the flailing horse kicked it out of place, knocking the shaman’s joint into a grotesque angle. He collapsed with both legs broken, on the ground face-to-face with the animal. The horse’s milky eyes gradually returned to its natural hue before it succumbed to death.

“It’s the old bitch!” Nara cried out, before making her wild approach. Within only a few steps reach, the Amazonian-like woman stopped in her tracks, clasping her hands on the sides of her head. Growing the same white eyes, her gaze drifted to the wagon, to the group, then back to the wagon as if glitching out.

The doctor drew her hammers, the dwarf aimed his bow and Sir Gizzards went to close in but it was too late. The brolic woman had already set the old hag’s confinement right side up, ripping off the seal.

"Curse it all! We need the bloody shaman to mend the cursed seal again!" the dwarf called out, frantically knocking arrow after arrow in desperate urgency.

Free from her prison with blood gushing from her nose, She Who Ensnares raised her arms, palms facing down. As her eyes oozed a pus-white sheen, so did the barbarian woman’s. Nara, initially hesitant, swatted away each bolt. Obediently, she hurled the empty cage toward the dwarf but missed deliberately in a silent mental struggle against the witch. The strong woman, now fully under the old hag’s control, advanced toward the shaman, as did Sir Gizzards.

Clara propelled herself forward with her torso almost parallel to the ground and arms stretched straight back. With incredible speed, she circled around the fierce tall woman wrapping one arm tightly around her neck and securing the hold placing her other hand firmly behind the head. Nara gasped, her eyes wide as she struggled, clawing at Clara’s arm constricting her throat. The proud hammer wielding medic did not let up as she demanded the others to, “Grab the shaman!” Sir Gizzards did as commanded, attentively rushing over to the Mayan. 

A single touch of the shaman sent a wave of dizziness crashing over the warrior. His heartbeat pounded in his ears, drowning out all other sounds. A coldness seeped through his body, and his vision narrowed, darkening at the edges. A heavy, leaden sensation settled over him as he realized he was teetering on the edge of losing consciousness.

Suddenly, the overwhelming sense of helplessness and confusion drained into a serene blindness. In a void of forever blankness where nothing else existed but a soft nothingness for a far as he could see, Sir Gizzards stood eye to eye with Mayan.

“Where am I?” Sir Gizzards questioned.

“I reside within thy mind, just as you within mine. Our souls converse through a shared consciousness.” Both men stood unclothed, free of worldly items.

“What manner of sorcery is this shaman?!”

“Ahh. I see. Thorne Rosehand is thy name, is it not? I do not merely heal physical wounds, warrior. I have served as a psychiatrist to kings, knights, and nobles alike. Tell me, why thy anchor-thought and nightmares to be one and the same? Do you not rely upon moments of joy to carry thee through the dark times?"

"Good moments in my life perish as swiftly as a candle’s flame. If my nightmare is the only thing that lingers so persistently in my mind, why not harness it to my advantage? It grants me a sorrow that surpasses all other emotions. When I march to war, this sadness outstrips my anxiety. In the face of frustration, I hope for that sadness to prevail instead. Fear, guilt, jealousy, loneliness—they all yield to this profound yet haunting sadness."

“Yet, it even triumphs your happiness, your peace, and your love. Curing bad with worse is not the path to remedy,” Mayan answered, gently placing his hand on the warrior’s shoulder.

"But when I embrace this sadness, all else that I wish would fade, fades. At times, I require that distraction. At times, I cannot afford to be ensnared by such limiting feelings, even those that are blissful. I cannot fall victim to all my emotions." Tears form in Sir Gizzards’s eyes.

"To fall victim to such emotions is the very path to overcoming them. Embrace that happiness, that anger, that anxiety; allow them to surface without letting them linger. Don’t respond or ignore them. Be present in the moment, smile or cry and let it pass, or else that moment will be present within you, festering endlessly. What shall you do when faced with a moment more traumatic, more tragic than that which you refuse to speak of? What will become of you then? Will it become a new nightmare, posing as an anchor-thought, only to draw more into the swirling pool of your mental decay? Whatever this moment may be, confront it so you can release it and begin to grasp hold of better things.”

The shaman’s eyes and hands began to glow, “Now I will leave a piece of myself in you which will protect you from that witch. You must end the life of whosoever has been ensnared by that vile hag, and then complete the mission in haste. Waste not a single moment, for time is on the side of our enemy.”

Before Thorne could respond, he blinked and found himself sitting where he lost consciousness. Motionless for a brief moment, he felt disoriented as he sought to piece together the fragments of what had just transpired. His brow furrowed in irritation, the calm of his self-reflection giving way to sudden clarity and understanding.

The shaman’s head rolled back into the warrior’s palm, his eyes glazing over with an emptiness.

"I shall wisely heed thy words. I am most grateful, Mayan..." Thorne whispered, gently shutting the shaman’s eye closed.

He lifted his head and swept a glance across the knoll. Everything remained unchanged as if the past few minutes had been nonexistent. His two female companions were still locked in their previous positions, their bodies entwined in a tangle of sweaty grit. The dwarf continued to swayed his bow, searching for a clear shot.

Then warrior’s eyes settled upon She Who Ensnares, and realized he was standing directly in her line of sight. With blood leaking from every orifice in her head, she wore a look of knowing that made the warrior feel slightly exposed of what was occurring in his head. In a long, sweaty strain, she flipped her palms face up, curling her raw, peeling fingers.

In a blood thirsty conniption, Nara responded to the witch’s command. The barbarous woman viciously yanked the medic off her back, clobbering the expectant mother square in her belly. Clara is then thrown but caught by the Dwarf. After seating her, he gently pressed his stubby hand against her abdomen searching for the baby's heartbeat to no avail. Alaric gently laid Clara’s head against his lap, calling her name.

Enraged, the warrior gently sat the shaman down and stepped towards the advancing Amazonian. Her curved blade struck the back of Thorne’s left gauntlet, causing him to stumble sideways from the impact, with sparks sailing past his head.

Seizing the opportunity from the recoil, he swung back but missed. Moving too swiftly to recover, he slammed face-first into the barbarian’s knee. Regaining his footing, Thorne advanced once more. Nara swung her blade again, the curved edge crashing into both of Thorne’s raised gauntlets, sending him reeling further back.

He stopped abruptly as Nara stopped her attack and began to vomit, her eyes betraying no hint of enchantment anymore. It wasn’t until She Who Ensnares raised her hands, palms outward, that the warrior’s instincts kicked in allowing him to duck just in time to evade the brutal swing of two hammers from behind. Clara, her eyes now oozing a haunting white sheen, swung until an oncoming projectile erupted through the glass of her mask, striking her right in the eye. 

"Forgive me, Clara,” the short man spat out, along with a few teeth mingled with the blood. Alaric proceeded to shoot towards the witch who was concealed amongst the dead horse, the arrows tearing through the animal’s carcass and the shaman’s corpse.

Thorne looked to Clara as she collapsed to her knees amidst the shards of glass from her mask, vomiting uncontrollably. He glanced at her eyes, which were slowly regaining their normalcy, then turned to Nara, who continued to clutched her stomach and coughing up blood.

“Sir Gizzards, we must put an end to the old hag,” the dwarf ceased his shooting, fixing himself to Thorne with an intense gaze. “And to the ladies, as well as myself. With the witch’s enchantments, once you’re ensnared, you’re forever ensnared.”

Swiftly, the hag plunged her hand into the horse. After briefly rummaging inside, she yanked the heart free, slick of glistening blood. Holding it to the sky, she sank her teeth into the raw organ without hesitation, tearing into it with a primal desperation, blood spilling down her chin with every ferocious bites.

Standing tall and rejuvenated, the hag raised her hands high, the last remnants of skin peeling away from the fingers. With a flick of her wrist, the dwarf, the medic, and the Amazonian woman jerked upright, their bodies moving as if pulled by an invisible hand, compelled by a force beyond their control. Their eyes were glazed with thick white clouds, mirroring the witch’s own. As she twisted her arms, commanding them to surround the warrior, her fingers curled. With each torte, they moved in unison, their faces slack, utterly surrendering to the will of She Who Ensnares.

As the group slowly closed in, Thorne seized the moment, grabbing the dwarf's head with both hands and clenching tightly. As his grip tightened, steam hissed from the warrior’s gauntlets. The tiny gears clicked and turned until the metal gloves were soaked with blood.

It was then the brolic female grabbed the warrior's left metal glove by the wrist, and wrenched it with brutality until the contraption crumbled into metal bits.
Thorne’s grip on the short man came loose as the medic joined the tussle. The two women punched the warrior repeatedly, sending ribbons of red spattering on the grass around. He drops to his knees and they continue pummeling him.

As both women began reaching for their weapons, Thorne seized the momentary pause to deliver a powerful punch to the medical physician’s jaw, sending her weapons flying out her hands. He caught one of the hammers and swung it with brutal force, crushing the tall fierce woman’s skull before she could draw her curved blade. Nara’s lifeless body collapsed next to the dwarf.

As the doctor steadied herself, the warrior seized her by the neck with his functional glove. The dwarf, his face smeared with bruises and blood, arose clamping his teeth into Thorne’s free forearm, tearing into the muscle by sheer weight alone. With both hands engaged, Throne too opened his mouth, and bit down on the dwarf’s nose. The warrior yanked his head to the left as a bulk of Alaric’s nose came free from his face. The short man immediately came crumpling to the grass. His arm now loose, Thorne gripped the back of Clara’s head with his free hand. Mustering power from his overstimulated glove and the last ounce of strength from his bitten arm, he snapped her neck.

The witch, She Who Ensnares, stood discolored and covered in a film of dried blood. She cackled maniacally as Thorne approached.

“I am delighted that you choose to end me, for in my death, I shall become the new sorrow you cling to. Let me be the dark memory that shadows your every thought, the new anguish upon which you will fixate endlessly.”

“Nay, I shall confront it boldly and endure the anguish I ought to have felt long ago. I will not react nor ignore that moment, but witness its entirety. I will allow it to pass just as the shaman said.”

Thorne took the old hag by her prune hands, and forced her rotting fingers to his head. 

Just as before, the pounding heartbeat began anew with the drowning sound, seeping coldness, and darkening vision. The overwhelming sense of helplessness and confusion did not give way to a peaceful blankness but rather to a dull and cruel numbness. Thorne was cast into a place where no steadfast thought could anchor him, where emptiness reigned, and all things that once brought joy seemed distant, as if lost to time’s unforgiving grasp.

Then he saw her, a distant speck at first. She wore the same nightgown that was tattered and muddy at the edges. As she drew nearer, her features came into focus: a sun-kissed complexion, an almond-shaped face with full lips and a gently curved nose. However, her blank eyes were coated with a familiar sickly white sheen that sent a shiver down Thorne’s spine as she passed, staring unblinkingly.

The baby in her arms cooed softly as she gently cradled the small boy. The woman stopped beside a small fire that seemed to have appeared from nowhere, holding the baby over the flames. The warrior instinctively reached out toward them but recalled the shaman’s words and hesitated. Instead, he proceeded to watch in silent apprehension.

The woman abruptly froze with her fingers tight around the baby. She held that same position as She Who Ensnares quietly stepped out from behind her, moving with a foreboding quietness.

"Let us glimpse the buried memory you cling to, the one you use to forget the others you refuse to confront—the distraction from the gripping daily turmoil."

The old woman leans in to get a better look at the young woman's face, then turns back to Thorne, her jaw dropping in surprise.

"I remember her well—she offered her child freely to join my coven," she smiled, a wicked glint in her eye. "She never loved you, you know. She bore your child only to become one of us!"

The two women started laughing so vociferously, their cackles nearly tore from their throats.

"Fear not trembling child, she is with my sisters. Mark my words, you have not seen the last of her."

When the woman dropped the baby into the fire, flames erupted into a storm of embers and black smoke. Their laughter continued unabated as Thorne walked calmly toward them. He watched in despair as the fire slowly crawled up the ladies and around the baby, enveloping them inch by inch until they were completely swallowed by the flames. 

Then… a new anchor-thought was born.

As the blaze dwindled to nothing more than a faint waft of dust, the sound of a baby's cry began to carry. The warrior canted his head down with a face devoid of emotion to reveal a healthy newborn boy. He slowly dropped to his knees and gently cradled the child. Grounded once more in his world of familiarity, he took in his surroundings with his gaze falling upon a fleshy tube. He followed the long cord from the baby’s belly to underneath the expecting, but dead, mother’s cloak. Thorne had found himself beside Clara, the baby already delivered and in his arms as if fate herself had rewritten a new beginning.

Thorne sulked in his overwhelming confusion as he surveyed the aftermath of atrocities he had been forced to commit. His eyes first fell upon Alaric, the spirited dwarf with his nose scattered and a gaping wound across his face. Next, he gazed at Nara, the fierce Amazonian lying in the same position she had slept in just hours earlier, with a hammer lodged in her skull. Then he looked at Clara, the proud medic who would’ve made a fine mother, her neck twisted grotesquely like a doll with its head on backwards. Lastly, his gaze settled on Mayan, the shaman, whose mangled knees and scrambled mind bore testament to the price he had paid for the warrior’s sake. 

Once his eyes settled on She Who Ensnares, the remnants of her head splayed around in a wide splatter of fleshy fragments, an unexpected yet miraculous moment occurred. Tears finally began to flow. As the warrior’s sobs turned into desperate heaving, his entire body shook violently revealing a rawness long overdue. He howled with a mix of pain and relief, smiling despite his eyes red and raw from the relentless onslaught of emotional barriers being broken. Gasping and laughing between wrenching sobs, each cry more uncontrollable than the last, the warrior/ Sir Gizzards/ Thorne Rosehand held the child closer.
