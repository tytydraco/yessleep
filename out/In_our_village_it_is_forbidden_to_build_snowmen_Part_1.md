I was born in the village, grew up in the village and–for whatever reason–stayed in the village. Nestled between fields and a roaring forest, there was nothing special about it. Except, of course, that it was *my* village. I knew everyone who lived there, knew each road, walkway and desire path so well I could’ve walked anywhere with a bandana across my eyes. That’s a hard thing to let go of, and I guess something that does make it special, at least to me. Honestly, for how long I had fantasized about leaving but never actually making a real effort to do so, I knew deep down I’d die in that village. 



In the end, I did leave. It just didn’t happen the way I thought it would.



Like any small community, our village had many unwritten rules. Over at Hook’s Bar, last call never came at a specific time, instead coming when Walter Hook himself decided it was time to end the night, and everyone had to have utmost respect for this time. Sometimes it was well before midnight, and other times–when he was in good spirits, both mentally and physically–it could come as the sun rose. If you didn’t respect it, he’d reach under the counter and push you out the doors with a shotgun getting acquainted with your asscheeks. 



At the general store, you never complained about the old ladies taking their time at the register. Everyone knew that it was the only time they got to just talk and spend time with people, especially the widows, and the cashiers would reciprocate with chitchat each and every day. If you didn’t respect this rule, you probably wouldn’t get a shotgun up your ass, but the looks those old ladies could give were arguably worse.



Many other rules existed of course, ranging from small social cues to the attire one could wear without getting weird looks, but those were not as serious. People are people, and sometimes they can act against the status quo. But there was one rule that everyone had been taught to respect since they were a child. One rule that should never be broken.



*Don’t build a snowman.*



And for the twenty-six years I’d been living in that village–as far as I knew–the rule had never been broken. Although the winters were long and the snow aplenty, I’d never in my life seen a snowman in real life. I think if I’d seen one, I would’ve probably asked it for an autograph.



As a boy I’d asked my mother why we couldn’t do it. Even then, it seemed ridiculous that a few balls of decorated snow would or could affect the world in any meaningful way. My mother looked at me with a patient thought set in her eyes. 



“It hasn’t happened for a long time, and hopefully it never again will” she said. “But when a snowman is built by one of the townsfolk, something bad happens to them. Something *really* bad, William.”



My mother only called me William when she was serious, and being a decent kid, it was not often, so I believed her.



“What kind of a bad thing?” I asked her, pushing the subject to figure out what she had censored, my adolescent mind running through the worst possible things I knew: stepping into quicksand; getting scolded by dad; having my gameboy break.



She looked out the window, staring down at our empty driveway. Her voice was calm when she spoke. Firm, but loving.



“If you build a snowman, you will die by the next morning,” she said, then turned to me and crouched down to meet my eyes. “So don’t ever, *ever* do it.”



Death wasn’t something I really understood back then, but I knew it was serious. I knew what it did, but I simply couldn’t picture anyone I knew ever dying. Especially me. It’s funny how the mind works when you’re still young, like you’re full of pure life itself, destined for death but truly unaware of it for its own sake. Life is feeling the water around you as you sink, seeing the sun’s rays growing weaker, never believing you’ll actually reach the bottom.

When I was twelve, my friend Max dared me to build a snowman. At the time I was too cowardly to take the dare, but looking back, I guess I could describe myself as smart instead. But that’s just me painting myself as something I was not.



Max was neither a coward nor smart, so he began to roll up a snowball from the fresh snow blanketing the field. 



“Pussy,” he said. “You really think you’re gonna die if you make a fucking snowman?”



Max had recently gotten brave enough to swear, and he was seemingly making up for all the years of his childhood he’d missed.



“Probably not, but I’m not gonna try it, either,” I said.



“Baby,” he exclaimed, the base of the snowman pushed to its place. 



When he started on the second tier, I tried to get him to stop.



“C’mon man, this isn’t funny. Aren’t snowmen a kids thing anyway?”



“Kids thing, huh? Well if it’s a kids thing, why don’t you fucking make one. Should be easy enough, Mr. Old Fart.”



Glancing around the field, I wished for someone to come and disrupt us. For once, I wanted some old fogey to come and tell us to get off his property. Just so I wouldn’t be the coward who made Max not build a snowman. 



Nobody came. Max was placing the second tier of the snowman on. 



I tried to think of a way out, but I couldn’t come up with one. Max was bigger and stronger, so it wouldn’t help to try and physically stop him. Besides, I think he would’ve told everyone even more what a pussy I was at school the next day.



The snowman soon had its torso in place. The head didn’t take long to form, but he was having trouble putting it on. The first two snowballs were too big, making the snowman taller than his arms could reach, so the head kept slipping off every time he tried to put it on.



“C’mon, Bill. Help me put the head on.”



“I really don’t think we should,” I said, squeezing my brain for a better answer. 



“C’mon, do you really believe those stories? It’s just some shitty tale. Some stupid shit they tell kids to stop them from doing something stupid.”



*Well, that was something to go on.*



“What would be so stupid about building snowmen? It’s not like some boogieman tale about going out into the woods alone, which kinda makes sense. This doesn’t make sense.”



“I don’t fucking know,” he yelled as the head of the snowman slid off the top once again. “Just fucking help me, dipshit.”



“My mom would kill me if she found out,” I said, immediately regretting the momma’s-boy approach.



“Well, if this thing is really gonna kill you, then you won’t have to worry about that, will you?”



The situation was uncomfortable, to say the least. In my young mind, the prospect of death or losing face were pretty much equally formidable, which sounds stupid, but so it was. 



I wasn’t smart when I let him climb on my back and put the head on. 



That night, I didn’t sleep a wink. When I went to school, I was completely sure I wouldn’t see Max come in, and soon there’d be police coming in to tell the teachers about the tragedy, and then we’d need to be counseled and I’d have to tell them that I’d let Max do it. That I let him build a snowman–that I was an accomplice to his death. A murderer.



When Max showed up, he had bags under his eyes but a smile about as wide as you could get. 



“Max: one. Snowman: zero,” he exclaimed.



“Congratulations, I guess.” 



After a moment’s hesitation, he smirked. “Bill: still a pussy.”

That was pretty much the end of my fear of snowmen. Knowing that the legend was all but made up, I quickly forgot it amidst the mess of puberty and the general trials and tribulations of being young. 



It was on my twenty-first birthday party, smoking in the alleyway behind Hook’s bar, which had quickly become our usual spot, that I was reminded of it once again. 



“You know, it’s not as simple as just building any snowman,” Melissa said as she struggled with the lighter. “It needs to be an exact kind of snowman, you know?”



“Babe, have I ever told you the story of Bill pissing his pants when I was making a snowman when we were kids?” Max said, leaning into Melissa awkwardly. 



“That’s not what happened,” I said. “I just tried to stop him from making it. My mom had told me the story, and… you know. I was a kid.”



“Nuh-uh,” Max said, glee in his eyes. “You definitely had something wet between your thighs.”



Melissa finally got the lighter to work and took a long drag of her cigarette.



“Well. Bill was being smart, then. Maybe I should date him instead,” she said through an exhale of smoke as she looked at Max with a face that winked without her eyelids moving.



I felt like I was blushing, hoping it didn’t show in the weak streetlight.



Max, feigning a blow to his macho-ego, tried to brush it off. “Well, what did I do wrong then, huh? Were my balls too big or something?” There was something vulnerable in his voice, as well, but only for a moment. A breath between the words.



Not taking the bait, Melissa and I kept our faces neutral. 



“It’s just something my grandma told me before she passed,” Melissa said. “The snowman needs to have three tiers, which you got right, I guess. But it also needs two twigs for arms, two pebbles for eyes and a carrot for a nose.”



“You’re shitting me,” Max said. “Well, I know what I’m trying tonight.”



“It’s summer, Max. Where the fuck are you gonna find snow?”



“Oh, right. Well, I’ll make a note in my itinerary for next winter then.”



I don’t know if this needs to be said, but Max never had and never would have an itinerary. Not that there was much he would’ve needed to write down.



\---



Four years later, on Christmas Day, the village got the worst present of all. In the bermuda's triangle between Hook’s bar, the general store and Barbara Shaw’s estate, right in the middle of the road, stood a lone snowman. 



Barbara–one of the resident, chitchatting old ladies–was the first to see it, and immediately called everyone she knew to tell them what had happened. By the time I got there, it seemed like the whole town was there to witness the sight.



While our–so everyone who had family in the village, which was everyone–parents and grandparents gathered around the snowman like a pack of animals, discussing it with serious tones and an almost odd fervency, us youngins stood back and watched. It didn’t take long to find Melissa and Max, forming their own little cocoon within the larger group, the former’s brow furrowed and the latter gleefully smoking a cigarette. 



“Merry Christmas,” Max said as I walked up to them.



“Merry Christmas, guys. My mom got the call. I guess someone finally did it?”



“Fucking right,” Max said.



Melissa gave me a look, then turned her gaze to Max and then the snowman. 



“Max?” I said, his eyes scanning the crowd. “Did you do this?”



“What. Me? No way, Jose.”



I turned back to Melissa. Max never gave a straight answer. For a moment she hesitated, then turned to meet my eyes. Her voice was firm.



“No, I don’t think he did it. But someone did.”



Max laughed.



“Well, fuck. What a way to give the whole town some holiday spirit,” I said, turning around to look at the snowman. It was difficult to see between the crowd, but I saw enough to know it at least had a carrot for a nose and something dark for eyes. Pebbles. 



“Someone’s gonna die tonight,” Melissa said. “I wonder who it is.”



Max turned to her, like this wasn’t the first time today they’d had this conversation. “Nobody’s going to fucking die. It’s an old wives tale! C’mon, you’re really gonna believe this shit?”



It hurt to see Melissa so uncomfortable. I wanted to relieve the tension, but I didn’t know how.



Before the argument could swell and reach an infection, someone from the group of adults–*real* adults–walked up to our group. I think it was Mr. Acker, Zoe’s dad. One of the teachers who I’d somehow never stumbled upon besides in the hallways at school. 



A stubble had started growing around his usually impeccably trimmed beard, which made him look less put together than usual. His usual was dressing everyday in a suit and tie. 



“Hey gang,” he said awkwardly, trying not to shout but to make his presence clear. We turned around lazily to look at him. “I know this must be scary for everyone. We haven’t had an… *incident* in a long while. But we still don’t know who did it. Nobody’s in trouble, we just need to know, okay gang?”



Nobody answered. Looking around me, everyone’s faces shared the emotion I felt–this was all being taken way too seriously, which meant that it wasn’t serious, because nothing that the adults found serious truly ever was. 



Except Melissa, who was on her second cigarette since I’d come in. 



Mr. Acker’s tone took on the note of practiced authority. “C’mon, guys. This is serious.”



“We don’t care,” someone shouted from our crowd.



“It’s just a dumb snowman,” another one exclaimed with a voice that had taken on the first inklings of puberty. 



“That’s not–uhh, that’s just not true. Look, we just really need to know,” Mr. Acker said–was his first name John? I couldn’t remember. “So, uhh. Just tell me if you know anything. Or your parents. Okay, gang? Okay. Just let us know.”



He fumbled his way back to his group as awkwardly as I suspected he would. For a teacher, he had never seemed to learn how to talk to young people, yet he never seemed to try the obvious: just talking to us like we’re people. 



But something happened at that moment. it was made clear that our village had become divided. Something about that felt… well, it felt wrong. Like something that was obvious had been made visible, and it couldn’t be taken back. Could no longer live in the shadows. My stomach suddenly dropped, and a sense that something terrible was about to happen came with it or the other way around.



I turned back to Melissa. Max was no longer standing by her side. 



“Where’s Max?” 



Melissa’s eyes lit up, the worry in them palpable, like she’d been awoken from a nightmare. She turned to look around, at first with a sense of urgency until she turned back to me and gave a shrug. “I dunno. Probably back home already.”



Scanning the crowd, I couldn’t find him either. He wasn’t the type of person you’d miss, not by his looks, but by the sheer gravitas he had. So he was off, then. Off to do what?



Making my way out of the group, I took in the wider scene. Still no sign of Max. 



If he left without saying anything, it usually meant that he was about to do something stupid. 



*Fuck.*



Not wanting to alert anyone, I tried to make my jog seem like a quick stride, dragging my feet on the snow as much as I could. Melissa didn’t seem to notice my leaving, or else she didn’t care. 



When I got to the alleyway behind Hook’s bar, there was no sign of Max. Instead, a small, sloppily made, and with a snapped-in-half carrot for a nose, two unproportionately large rocks for eyes, and two dead twigs for arms, stood before me. 



My vision narrowed. *This isn’t fucking funny. Fuck, Max, you fucking idiot. Think about Melissa, you dick.*



That’s when everything went to shit.



Too late for me to move, I heard footsteps trudging through the snow. People talking with a quickness that gave them long strides, like they too wished to mask their jog. 



And in the middle of it all, Max’s voice. 



“It’s here, guys! The other one’s here!”



When they found me, standing next to the shitty snowman, for what felt like a long moment, nobody said anything. In the forefront stood Max with Melissa tucked behind her. He said nothing, but smirked the way he did when he found something worth keeping. Something worth *pushing*.



From the crowd emerged my mom. She had a look that I’d never seen before, a mixture of fear and utter disgust. Worse than when she’d been angry, and even worse when she’d been disappointed. 



“What have you done, William?”
