I had a rough night, first the argument with my wife and then the work call. They called me to investigate a murderer on the loose and since I’m the only detective in town I had to get my hands on it quickly.

Driving towards the first crime scene I noticed I forgot my pills, if I don’t drink them regularly I get terrible visions, from ghosts to any more bizarre stuff. I figured it wouldn’t be a problem since I was an all-time regular and hoped they didn’t kick in while I’m working. Arriving at the first crime scene, it was this campsite where the murderer took the life of a 16-year-old girl, the inside of her camping van was all with blood like he had fun with her, how crazy! Knives, forks, and any kind of cutlery had been used. Here is where the first vision kicked in, it was like I could see what happened, I could see the murderer the girl everything, every single detail, it lasted for about a minute or so when I got back to normal, standing there shocked of how I could see that but I quickly snapped out of it and continued working. Finished my first crime scene and on to the next one, it was probably 3-4 am now.

Here I come to the next crime scene maybe a kilometer or two next to the first one, a couple of wooden cabins, tents, and so on. It’s a national forest and a lot of people have properties here and also a lot of them camp here. The second crime scene was in a cabin where I entered inside and did my work. The murderer here used an axe to kill an old man and his wife, looking around for clues and here did the second vision hit, same as before I saw everything, I was terrified now because of all this and I ran out of the house took a break and called my boss. After the phone talk with the boss, he let me go home after explaining the condition I was in and could no longer continue.

Driving into my garage and slowly walking inside my house I get terrible headaches and I’m getting dizzy. I'm inside my house now and my wife is nowhere to be found, I yelled around, and searched for her but nothing. The last place I didn't check was the basement, I'm going inside and I find my wife on the ground with blood around her. I immediately call a medic and after I call my boss to explain what happened, he didn't say a word like he was just listening to me, I kept yelling at him to answer and then he just asked a simple question, are u home John? I was confused as he hung up on me, I'm rushing up the stairs and I stop shocked, I don't know if this is a vision or anything... but there is police in front of my house and my hands are all bloody. What should I do?
