[Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zd0ycv/dont_let_mrs_faulkner_sleep_part_1/)  


I sat there trembling for the better part of a half hour. The safety of my already compromised position rested in literally the idea of a woman staying asleep.   


I managed to shove my fear down my esophagus with a deep inhale, a bitter pill to swallow if I must say. I tried hide or die as the passcode. Still. Nothing. It seemed the locker was a dead end for now.    


Even with this unflattering fixation of harm our client had on all of us. The tantalization of curiosity toward this locker was hypnotic. Like an urge to scratch at an itch you just can’t reach, yet you needed too, you had too.   


Prying myself away from it. I had to get out of the safety of this room. I had to check on my client, and I hated that feeling.   


Every step I took on each stair was longer than ever, louder than ever. Felt as if I was smashing plates under my feet each time my foot lurched forward.  


Sweat dripped from my brow, under my arm pits, hell, everywhere. I approached her bedroom, quietly opening the door. She was gone. Blankets sprawled out.   


Another clap of thunder came, a blinding bolt luminating the room for a brief second.   


I expected to see her lurking somewhere in the corner, hunched over with that smile. Nothing.   


Then a disturbing groan, or wallowing came from the attic. Almost like a muffled, hoarse cry. I wanted to rush toward the sound, when I heard a smash come from the downstairs office, along with a drawn out, fake laugh. A disturbing, taunting cackle, and then metal scraping sounds against the walls on the first floor.   


My phone vibrated. Ameer was calling. I wanted to answer the call, but the scraping sounds were moving toward the stairs.  


I needed to play her sick game and hide.        


Carefully I crept around and opened every door on the floor, and then ducked into the laundry room as soon as I heard her moving up the steps.   


There is this small crawl space in the laundry room. Tucked away underneath a sink and beside a freezer. I managed to curl myself inside it and wait, trying to control my hyperventilating.   


Outside she shuffled about. Closing one door after another. She wasn’t even trying to look for me. She just closed door after door.    


The sounds of her feet clapping against the vinyl wood stopped at the laundry room.   


‘Just close the door. Please just close the door and be on your way.’ I said to myself over again like a prayer.    


I squirmed deeper into this tiny hole that would make a mouse feel claustrophobic. Stopping when my feet were plastered between pipe and insulation.   


The door did not close. Instead, she stepped inside. Inching her way forward. That metallic sound gleaming across the washer and dryer, then the freezer until it was nearly in front of me.


‘She found me. I’m going to die.’ My thoughts betraying my sanity. Is this how victims of killers felt in their last moments? Their hearts beating through their chest, as if trying to escape the oncoming cruelty by bursting out of my chest. Stomach acid bubbling till my throat felt like it was going to spew flames. Worst of all was this snap acceptance of my life ending. Accepting the grim reality of the situation. An uncontrollable urge to will myself into a deathly defeat. 


I closed my eyes tight. A silent rebuttal against my feelings of submission. I held my hand over my mouth in defiance, strangling myself of oxygen, all for the sake of survival.  


Her laugh taunted me. My small victory against myself had been in vain. She had found me, and I was in literally no position to fight her. Tucked away in a crawl space, staring at her bare, dark feet as they shuffled toward me. The tips of her toes pointed at me like a knife closing in on its mark.      


She dropped a card in front of me. Then shuffled out of the room, closing the door behind her.   


I snatched the card and moved toward the door, throwing myself in front of it, barring her from re-entering it.   


I looked at the white business card. On the back in pen was a series of random letters, some capitalized, some not.   


It was the passcode to the locker downstairs.      


“What are you doing!? This isn’t you!” I cried out.         


No reply. Nothing. Just the cold, biting shrill of silence was her response. Even the wind against the boughs of this old house subsided in that moment, knowing she, despite her age, her health, and her mental degradation, she was the greater force.     


I mustered up whatever courage I could and pushed out from the laundry room. I kept my back against the wall and looked every which way. I would not be caught off-guard. Not to my own client.       


 The first thing I noticed when I got out to the hallway was that her bedroom door was slightly ajar. I tried to glance through from a safe distance, but it was too dark to properly peek through. As I inched away, I looked back. There I saw in the flashbang of the storm, her smile, her teeth grinding back and forth, her eyes searing into me with an intense stare before she smashed the door closed. In less than a minute she had caught me off-guard. She was already winning this ‘game’.


I jumped from the sound of the door, and then rapidly made my way down the steps, my fingers gliding against open slices on the dry wall, trying to get a quick feel of whatever instrument she had on her.   


Given the marks and the scraping sounds, it was clear to me she had a knife, but how? The cupboards were locked. My mind was spinning. I had to shake it off. I had to press forward and get somewhere safe and secure and wait.   


Playing her game was only going to lead to my death, but it was coming clearer with each passing moment that I had been stuck in her trap for longer than just tonight. I needed to remember it was just me and her. I had the advantage of youth and speed and I had to find a way to exploit these strengths against her. 


Even in these moments, regardless of the terrifying events unfolding, she was still my client, and she was no longer properly sedated. I needed to do what was in our best interests.   
    

That was a sentiment I would not maintain throughout the night.


I ran back into the office. It was in disarray. The computer was cracked and dented. The monitor screen shattered. Books torn from shelves and pages ripped up. There were cuts all along the walls. She had moved fast and disturbingly quiet, even when she ransacked this room. Which means while I was down here. In the office. She was down here with me. Lingering in the night, watching me as I entered and left. 


Another epiphany of impending doom had hit me. She never took her pills. She pocketed them in her cheek or behind her tongue, knowing how to hide it from me and Abi during our routine checks. The old hag was playing dirty.     


The only thing untouched was that stupid locker.    


I closed the door behind me, locked it and dragged one of the bookshelves over to the door. She might have the keys but there was no way she was in any shape to burst through the door, not at her age.   


I wanted to call Ameer, but that locker sat idly behind me, the answer to all my curiosities now in my hand. I caved and punched in the code. The locker gave off a buzz of approval and the hinges unlocked. I clicked the button, pulling open the door. Inside were several news clippings of missing persons or what I could vaguely understand to be murders all around the coast of South Africa. At the top of the locker there was a cellphone that was vibrating, rattling against the metal.   


I slid the green icon and pressed the phone to my ear. I said nothing, just listened to the sounds of muffled cries, sobbing, and shuffling.   


The phone buzzed. I changed it over to speakerphone so I could see what was happening. It was a video request.   


Dreadfully I accepted the video call. Only to see Abigail still in her scrubs, tied up. Snot dripping from her nose, teeth trying to bite through her gag, red eyes filled with tears.   


As the camera backed away from her face, I could see clearly that she was bleeding, badly. She looked like she had been run over by a lawnmower.   


“Attic.” Mrs. Faulkners voice whispered. I could hear her perverse, end-to-end smile through the phone. The flickering lights of what I presumed came from a candle were snuffed out. The screen went back, and then the call disconnected.   


Now my phone rumbled, scaring the ever-living hell out of me. It was Ameer.     


“Are you okay? I’ve tried to call you like three times now!” his voice trembled.     


“She’s got Abi, she’s cut up the whole place. She’s cut up Abi, I think she’s got a history of killing Ameer. You have got to help me.” I could not help myself from just trembling, crying, and spilling out the first words that came to my mind.    


“She has Abi? Holy shit. Okay. Just stay there. The police will be there soon. Just wait. Keep that locker open and away from her. We’ve been trying to get inside it since her uncle passed and we might need the contents. Don’t do anything drastic Kris. I’m-I’m sorry. I should have known.”     


“Ameer. I can’t let Abi suffer. I can’t leave her up there to die. When the police get here. Know that I went up to the attic to get her.”   


I ended the call before Ameer could talk me out of it.    


“You want me to play your game. Then I’ll do it on my terms!” I mumbled to myself, trying to pipe up some courage from the sobbing mess I had become.    


Desperately I scrambled to find a hiding spot for the documents. If she went to this extent to lock them up and use them to scare me, then she too must have been afraid of them getting into the wrong hands. At least, that was my logic at the time.  


I hid the clippings and pages inside of the computer. Yes, inside of it. We always kept a screwdriver handy in the drawers. I quickly unscrewed the side of it. Shoved them in and re-attached it.   


All the cupboards in the kitchen were open. No knives or sharp weapons to grab a hold of. Not that there were many in the first place. Tracy usually took almost all the sharp instruments home. All part of protocol. So the screwdriver would have to do.     


The second march up the stairs was longer than the first by a mile. Every step made my heart sink a little further into my stomach. Every moment making my hands clammy and even my sweat turn cold. When I finally reached the top. I could see all the doors were closed. All except for hers, which was now wide open.   


The image of her smiling and creeping in the doorway speared into my mind out of nowhere, causing me to stumble back. I wanted to curl up in a ball and give up, but I couldn’t. I had to shove it all down. All that fear and defeat.    


I might as well have been sliding against the walls as I approached the opened door, refusing to give that old broad a chance to attack me from behind.    


Inside her room was a calamity of mental and moral deprivation. She had spat out her pills as I suspected. They sat soaking in what looked to be her saliva in an empty glass. All along the room were her decrepit drawings. 


She had drawn a picture of a broken emergency generator. 


A sketch of Abi drinking a glass of water that had Mrs. Faulkner spat up sleeping pills dissolving in it. Which made my stomach howl in disgust.   


And finally, her ‘masterpiece’. A picture of her killing both of us. A shame for her that I was not going to allow that to happen.   


I left that horror show of a bedroom and made my way up to the attic where the steps had been pulled down, as if they were awaiting my arrival. 


How polite of her… 


It was dark. No lights. Nothing. Covered up furniture, old dusty paintings and trunks stacked one on top of the other and a window that had been covered with blankets so I could not see. The distinct smell of candle wax and the burning scent of a recently flaming wick swamped my nostrils.   


I used my phone to navigate around. Shining the light all around the room. Jumping at shadows and wielding my fierce screwdriver like a sword. I aimed my phone all around the room frantically until I saw Abi at the back of the attic behind an old patio set. Tied up, struggling and squirming with all her might. She was trying to scream but her throat sounded dry, even damaged. Likely from being trapped in here without water for hours. Trying to call out to anyone.   


I pushed the patio set aside and undid her bindings and tried to stand her up, she stumbled but found her feet. She was losing a lot of blood and fast.   


“Are you okay? What happened?”   


Abi began to sob, shaking violently, “I don’t know. I remember waking up here tied up. She was standing there with a knife. For no reason she would cut me and just smile. She’s sick, Kris. She’s just fucking twisted.”     


I hugged Abi tight. “Where did she go?” I asked.   


“I don’t know, but I did hear her leave a while ago.” She replied between sniffles.   


I aimed the cellphone back toward the stairs and there she was. Mrs. Faulkner. Hunched over, her arms drooping lifelessly. In truth, it was more like she was bent over. Her hands practically at her knees. My phone battery died and all I could do was hold Abi as we both watched her. 


She was now just a dark figure. One that started to lift herself up. I know that her creepy smile was plastered on her face. Th whites of her eyes piercing through us. A hellish concoction of anger and a malevolent excitement to harm us.    


She began to pop her shoulders back, the bones and the gas between her muscles crackling loud. In a contorted, grotesque manner she stretched, or rather, slithered her spine upright until she was no longer the smaller, hunched over Mrs. Faulkner, but rather a six foot four monster that towered in our path.   


Her head tilted to the side as her dark silhouette waved at us, taunting us for springing her trap. A knife casually slipped out from her sleeve, then another from her other sleeve. The lightning burst down, illuminating the silhouette of a monster into a depraved reality.     


She barred our path, wielding her knives, her joints still popping as she craned her neck from one side to the other. Her smile permanently stretched with a never quenched bloodthirst.   


We were trapped here, in the attic with her, and she was running toward us.
