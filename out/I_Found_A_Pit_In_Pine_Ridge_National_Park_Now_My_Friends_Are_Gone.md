Hey everyone, I know I’m probably going to sound crazy posting this, but I don’t know what else to do. I need to get this out before I lose my nerve. You see, I went camping in Pine Ridge National Park with two friends, Mark and Erin. It was supposed to be a fun weekend trip, just three friends getting away from everything for a couple of days.

We made camp on a Friday evening, set up near a secluded hiking trail. The first day was perfect. We were laughing, roasting marshmallows, just relaxing. It was all easy-going and fun. By the time we crawled into our tents, we were already planning the next day’s hike.

“Tomorrow, we’re finding that secret lake,” Mark said, already with the map out. He always had this thing for tracking down hidden spots. He swore my dad had mentioned it once when we were younger. And yeah, I’ve known them for that long. Well, Mark at least. Erin was newer.

“Right,” Erin said, pulling her hood over her head. “And if we get lost, you’re totally on your own. I’m not going to listen to your directions when we end up on some random cliff.”

We all laughed and I felt that perfect sense of escape you get when you’re surrounded by nothing but nature and good company. Pure, complete peace.

The next morning, after a breakfast of instant oatmeal and coffee, we set off with high spirits. The sun was shining, the birds were singing, and everything felt...perfect. That was the only way to describe it. We were talking, joking, making fun of Mark’s awful sense of direction. But as we ventured deeper into the woods, the trail became harder to follow. The map didn’t match up with what we were seeing on the ground.

“Maybe we should head back,” I suggested, the growing unease in my stomach making me second-guess everything. “None of this looks familiar.”

“Nah, we’re close,” Mark insisted. “It’s just up ahead.”

“I’ve never seen this place before, Mark.”

“You only think that because the memory is so old and foggy. Plus, it’s got kid-warp.”

“*Kid-warp*?”

“You know, when you remember something completely different just because you were a kid when it happened.”

I was positive that’s not what was going on, but we followed him anyway.

And then we stumbled upon it.

It happened around midday. We came across a clearing in the woods where the trees grew unnaturally far apart, like they’d been deliberately spaced. It was a perfect circle, almost too perfect. Does that make sense? The amount of work someone would have had to put into making them *that* evenly spaced would have been insane.

“Whoa.” I was still looking at the trees.

“Whoa is right.” Mark, however, was not.

In the middle of the circle, there was a black pit. Maybe four or five feet wide, but the thing that got to me wasn’t how big it was. It was how *wrong* it looked. The earth around it was slick and damp. The pit itself oozed a thick, black sludge. It looked like tar but it carried with it an almost coppery smell, this sharp penny-tang that made my mouth water unpleasantly.

“What the Hell,” Mark said, walking up to it without hesitation. “That’s...freaky.”

“I don’t like this,” I said, my voice shaking as I stared at it. The pit was a perfect circle too, just like the trees. Thick globules of black tar dripped molasses slow deeper into its cavernous maw. Small bubbles formed and burst at the edges. The grass directly around it was crisp, yellowed—dead.

“Come on, Chelsea, don’t be such a buzzkill,” Erin said, already pulling out her phone to take pictures. She crouched down, snapping shot after shot. “This is *amazing*! It’s like something out of a horror movie.”

“Exactly!” I threw my arm to the side. “This is *straight* out a horror movie. Which is why we should go. Right now. We have that lake to look for anyway, right? Mark, aren’t you dying to go find the lake?” My voice took on a pleading tone near the end.

But Mark, of course, didn’t listen. “I’ll just take a look,” he said, grinning like a kid who’d just found the best secret. “It’ll take five minutes top. The place doesn’t even look that deep.”

“No, Mark, *please*—” I started, but he was already climbing into the pit. Erin followed him, laughing.

“I’ll be right behind you!” she called out, her voice light.

I stood at the edge, watching them disappear into the darkness of the pit. My heart was pounding, and my stomach twisted into a knot. I shouted at them to come back but they didn’t answer. Slowly, I stepped over to the pit, peeking inside, expecting to at least see them making their way down the tunnel.

Nothing.

Just that viscous black, dripping steadily into the shadows.

A sense of unease settled over me. My body was screaming at me to run, to get the hell out of there, but I couldn’t leave. Not yet. I told myself they were just having some fun. They’d come out any second, laughing about how stupid it was. The only reason I couldn’t see them was because it was so dark.

Minutes turned into hours.

I sat down. I stared at the pit.

I waited.

The sun started to set.

“Mark? Erin?” I called, my voice cracking. It was the first time I had spoken in hours.

Nothing.

The forest was quiet, too quiet. When was the last time I heard a bird? I couldn’t remember. When I got up, my body protested, joints stiff from sitting so long. I walked closer to the pit, peering down into the darkness once again, trying to see any sign of them. But it was empty. There was no movement. I called out.

No answer.

It was going to be dark soon. Unease turned into panic and I decided to call them and *make* them come back up. Don’t ask me why I waited so long. I don’t know. I just...did. Maybe it was because I was afraid to admit they were gone. Maybe because I knew, deep in my heart, it wouldn’t matter. Either way, I fumbled for my phone, but the signal was dead. The screen showed nothing. I tried again, tapping frantically, but there was nothing. Not even a single bar.

“Mark! Erin!” I shouted, my voice growing hoarse. I waited a few more minutes, but nothing. No sound. No movement.

I backed away slowly, my feet moving on their own, retreating from the pit. A chill crawled up my spine. It felt like the pit itself was watching me. The scent of copper became almost overwhelming. Several larger bubbles formed in a cluster and popped softly, letting out the unmistakable scent of bile. I couldn’t stay there any longer. I turned and ran back to camp, hoping maybe they would show up there overnight. No, I wasn’t hoping. I was p*raying* that would happen.

The camp was exactly how we’d left it. It was almost fully night now. I flung myself into the tent, then burrowed into my sleeping bag, pulling it tight around me. Sleep came surprisingly quickly. And in the morning...there was still no sign of them.

I grabbed my backpack. My legs felt like jelly, but I forced myself to move. I needed help. I needed answers.

I practically ran all the way back to the ranger station, my breath coming in sharp gasps. The ranger, Paul, was sitting behind the counter, flipping through some paperwork. His eyes flicked up when he saw me.

“Something’s happened,” I gasped, nearly collapsing in front of him. “Mark and Erin...they’re gone. They disappeared.” I quickly told him about the pit, the terror returning just at the mention of it. “They must have fallen in and—I don’t know. Hurt themselves. Gotten stuck. Something!”

Paul just stared at me for a long moment. He didn’t seem surprised. He didn’t look concerned. He looked...sad. Like he had seen this before. Alright,” he said quietly. “I’ll put in a call.” He went to the phone, dialing something. “I’ll send someone out to look. But you should know right now, it won’t do any good. They’re gone.”

I didn’t know what he meant, but his tone made it clear he wasn’t just talking about my friends. It was like he already knew. He didn’t need to search. He knew exactly what happened.

Search and Rescue came that afternoon. They looked for hours, combing the woods, scanning the area. They looked for the pit. They looked for my friends. They found nothing. No footprints. No signs of struggle. No trace of Mark or Erin. Nothing.

After two days, it was announced that they were gone. That was it. There was no pit. No strange sludge. It was as if none of it had ever happened.

The park closed the case, and the local authorities chalked it up to a “missing persons” report. Just another number in the hundreds of disappearances that happen in national parks every year. They called it a “411 case.” That’s it.

I was the only one who wasn’t content with that answer. I started looking, and I found stories—the type people don’t talk about—of hikers who just *vanish* in Pine Ridge. Of places that...don’t exist, even though they’re right in front of you.

There are a lot of 411 cases in the world. There are a lot of them at Pine Ridge.

But I know the truth. I know what I saw.

I’ve been back to Pine Ridge a few times, looking for that pit. I don’t even know why. I guess I keep hoping it’ll be there. But it’s gone. There’s no sign of it. There’s no sign of Mark or Erin either.

Sometimes, late at night, when the wind picks up and I’m safe inside of my tent, I swear I can hear their voices calling to me from the woods. It’s like they’re trying to tell me something, but the words always fade before I can make them out. And every time I think I’ve found that trail again, it slips away.

I don’t think anyone will ever find them. But as I’m typing this, safe in my tent, late at night, once more in Pine Ridge...all I can smell is that coppery tang.

I might not find my friends but tomorrow...I think I’ll be able to find the pit.

And I think I’m going to go in.
