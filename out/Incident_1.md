dHill: "Feel free to look but please don't touch anything, our lovely Senator WILL have me castrated if anything goes wrong with a VIP onsite."

unknownfemale: "Yeah, no, totally. I have no desire to draw further attention to myself, I plan on laying as low as possible for the next five days, then disappearing quietly."

nAlvarez: "What's wrong? Didn't expect your HIGHLY CARBONATED Seltzer Water to explode in Fish's face after footballing it around the damned mess hall for 20 minutes?"

unknownfemale: "Not my finest hour."

dHill: "Yeah, well... we'll all be completely OUT of hours if you pull that shit in here, so please keep your athletic impulses to yourself, or to the mess."

nAlvarez: "Buzzkill"

^16:24-
nAlvarez: "Recording."

dHill: "Thank you for your patience, Mr. Senator. I know, from the recent briefs, that you've had your hands full in dealing with the ongoing matter at C Facility, so I'd like to thank you for taking the time for this progress report. We've encountered a few unexpected bits of data in the first 36 hours of investigation that has given us significant pause."

nAlvarez: *coughs* "To say the least."

dHill: "We determined in rather short order that Item 3B is a Lavender-level object - volatile, advanced, and semi-biological in nature - dated as having been concealed and buried within B Site, roughly 37,000 years ago. It appears to be roughly chiseled from a single piece of fine marble. It is rectangular in shape, with a primitively designed idol carved into it's tallest face, adorned with writing that appears to be in the same unrecognized language as is found on certain artefacts from Sites A, C, and D."

*ceramic coffee mug clacks on surface*

nAlvarez: "Stimuli tests, so far, have been nearly pointless. At first, the object seemed to lightly shudder in reaction to artificial sources of heat nearing 100Â°F, but when presented with a human hand or one of various test animals in our care, the object seems to activate. If you turn your attention to this clip, you'll see that at multiple times the Item appears to be attempting to tear itself apart, violently rattling and shaking."

dHill: "This is where we have decided to take hiatus and reevaluate inspection paths. Pending any changes that we may observe over the week, I will likely recommend that Item 3B be vaulted under close supervision."

nAlvarez: "I am, unfortunately, forced to concur with Dillon in this case. Until proper investigatory and examination practices are developed and observed, we cannot guarantee the safety of anyone who may be present during the process. We look forward to your prompt response in this matter, as we feel it is of the utmost importance that we handle this immediately, citing NatSec Protocol 437. Thank you."

dHill: "Cut."

^16:27-
nAlvarez: "Now it's time to have some fun!"

dHill: *laughs* "Alright Nelle, but please be careful."

nAlvarez: "Sarah, grab your flashlight and your phone, let's see how it reacts to a simulated rave! Dan, can you get the lights?"

dHill: "On it. Sarah, please be careful with your damned water. If that mug breaks and makes a mess in here, you're dealing with it."

unknownfemale: "My bad, I'll be gentle."

nAlvarez: "That's what he said."

dHill: *laughs* "Nice. Nelle, kill the cameras."

nAlvarez: "I know, I know. I'm disappointed too, but instead of wasting our time complaining about this hunk of ancient rock not losing it's shit when I dropped the bass... why don't we just use what little time we have left with the specimen seeing what we can get it to do. Maybe this time we pull back the seal?"

unknownfemale: "Can we do that?"

dHill: "Have you lost your fucking mind, Nelle?"

nAlvarez: "What did I say?"

dHill: "The fishtank fun is fine, but THAT is too far. We already know that these things can be dangerous."

nAlvarez: "Yes, when exposed to intense levels of electric stimulation, a few of these have yielded unpredictable results, but that doesn't mean..."

dHill: "Unpredictable results? Is that what you call 14 charred Marines in an Antarctic research facility?"

nAlvarez: "My point stands. They tortured it with electroshock therapy for 3 days, I just want to expose it to the finer elements of douchey late 2010s dance music."

unknownfemale: *laughs*

dHill: "Sarah, I've already asked you to be careful with that damned thing, the examination table is made of glass, for God's sakes. And FINE, I'll open the seal, but you get 20 minutes then we're out of here. Fucking thing gives me the creeps."
