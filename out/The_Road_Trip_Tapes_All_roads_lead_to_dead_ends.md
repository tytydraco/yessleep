I don’t want to keep this sort of thing under wraps. I am making these posts for the sake of my own well-being as well as for you guys and your safety. I need help piecing this puzzle together. I fear the further I dig through these tapes, the further I am led like a lamb to slaughter. For those who haven’t read my previous post, I will include a link to this at the bottom. Without wasting any more time, this is how the nightmare progressed.

 

I don’t remember much from when I was young. I remember often having bad dreams and I remember being on the road. A lot. I practically lived my whole life in my dad’s car. Unlike the routine Detective Crawford has instilled in me, when we were on the road there was no routine. We would park up in some old rickety-looking town with my dad turning to me with a grin.

 

“Welcome to your new home.”

 

He said this every time. We left at irregular times. Some stays lasted weeks while others lasted only a couple hours. After seeing that motel room in the “Proud” file I seem to remember one of the lessons my dad taught me. I don’t remember the name of the town, but I remember it having a name that was quite unremarkable. We were there for a couple of days, and my dad left me in the motel while he went to “work”. He never told me what “work” was. I remember that room specifically since unlike the other motels we stayed at this one had two separate beds. My dad gave me some loose change and left me the keys so I could come and go as and when I pleased. With all the brain power an eight-year-old could muster, I decided that the best use of this money would be spent on an ice cream. I bought a small vanilla ice cream cone (that was all I could afford with the shrapnel my dad gave me) and made my way back to the motel room. On my way back, however, I remember bumping into someone.

 

“Hey! Watch where you’re going”

 

Looking up from my ice cream there was a girl in front of me. She was an inch taller than I was and had long blonde hair. I remember feeling flustered when I saw her.

 

“Sor- Sorry. I didn’t see you”

 

“Was your ice cream more important than the people around you?”  She sneered pointing at me.

 

It was.

 

“No! I- Sor- Sorry, Sorry.”

 

“God I’m just messing with you, but you do owe me one for getting ice cream on my shirt. What’s your name?”

 

I nervously laughed. “It’s James, and you?”

 

“Anna. It was nice to meet you, James. See you around”       

 

“See you- “

 

She ran past me before I could even finish. I remember watching her as she left. She made me feel a certain way, but I couldn’t explain how. As I walked up the stairs to our room my dad was already on the balcony.

 

“Stay here a minute James, there’s something you should know.”

 

I paid close attention to my dad when he spoke. Probably because I was already in a losing battle with my ice cream and there was no hope of saving it now.

 

“You see James there’s lots of people in this world. We all play a different role but regardless of what role you play we’re all still people, but some people are best left well enough alone. You see James some people don’t abide by their role. Some people like to chase storms. They race towards them at a hundred miles per hour and they won't slow down to the cautions people throw their way. They chase tornadoes, James. Swirling pillars of destruction that suck people up into them and never let go. They are spun around in the air James. Round and round and round again. For eternity. Do you want to chase Storms with these people James?”

 

I remember crying.

 

“No! No, No, No! I don’t want to chase storms. Please I don’t want to spin, I don’t want to spin!”

 

“Hey, hey, It's okay James. Don’t worry. If you stay with me, I promise you won’t end up like those people.”

 

After seeing the “proud” file I’m starting to think back on my memories of my dad in a different light.  I shouldn’t even be calling him my dad, but I don’t know what else to call him. Come to think of it he never actually told me his real name.  If my suspicions were right, then my dad had abducted me when I was a baby. Everything he told me about my mum dying during childbirth was all a lie. There were 3 more files on the “Road Trip” camera. I was the only one at the station given it was so late and Detective Crawford wasn’t answering any of my calls. I had told my “dad” that I would be back shortly before I left. I didn’t want to raise any suspicions and risk him making a run for it just as I was gathering enough evidence so a clear case could be filed against him. There was no point calling the police, I was the police. If this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life then now more than ever, I had to act.

 

When I arrived home none of the lights in the house were on. I thought it was better this way. I don’t think I could act like everything was fine if he got up close to me like he did when I came home earlier.  I opened the door and locked it behind me before tiptoeing up the stairs and into my room. My “dad’s” room is right next to mine and given that his door was closed I guessed he was asleep. I laid on my bed and flicked open the camera screen. There were 3 more files I had yet to watch.

 

File 2, “Romans”. The video lasted 3 minutes. The video was shot from a first-person perspective, the same as many of the “Born” tapes and showed three police cars parked on a dirt road next to a field of wheat. The person filming seemed to be hiding in a tree as the camera seemed quite high up and far away from the police below. The police seemed to be in disarray running between one another. Even seeing them this far away you could tell they were tired. Bags under their eyes and large sweat patches staining their white shirts as they ran from field to car and car to field repeatedly each time saying something into the radio. Crying could be heard throughout, but it wasn’t the baby this time, it was the person filming. Why were they crying? The video ended before I could find out why.

 

File 3, “Visitors”. The video lasted 13 minutes and seemed to be filmed in another motel room. The camera this time was placed in a corner facing a door with a large bed in the frame to the left. After 1 minute, a knocking could be heard as I boy who looked around 3 years old (maybe younger) could be seen jumping off the bed and running over to the door.  I don’t know if it was me. For one I don’t really recall what I looked like at every age I turned and even if this was me, I certainly don’t remember. The boy struggled with the doorknob for a few seconds before opening it. Inside was a bathroom. From the corner of the door, a leg stepped out into the frame. It was a man. He was completely naked save for some black socks, white boxers, and a red devil mask. The boy seemed amused giggling as the “Devil” danced around on all fours making weird sounds like

 

“Ug! Ah! Shaaa!”

 

The “Devil” soon became enraged at the boy’s amusement as they clapped their hands and reached out toward the mask. The figure then stood up in one quick motion slamming the door so violently that it sent the boy falling backwards. The boy began to cry. After 6 minutes of the boy crying the door reopened. The figure was now dressed in a white gown far too big for them as their sleeves came so far past their hands they draped only inches off the floor. The figure's face was covered in white makeup and the eyeshadow was so heavily applied that the eyes looked completely black while their lips were a bright shade of red and their cheeks two large dots of pink. Curling around their face were locks of bright blonde hair. It was the same figure as the “Born” Tapes. The boy began to cry louder at the sight of them, but the figure remained calm. Crouching down beside the boy the figure began to stroke their hair and hold their hand, but the boy still cried and even tried to move away. The figure then grabbed the boy by the face and turned him to face the camera while pointing towards it. The boy then stood up wiping away his tears and walked towards the camera. The entire time the figure remained standing by the door with their hands together in front of them. The boy then picked up the camera and walked back to the figure who took it. The video then ended.

 

File 4, “House”. This video lasted 20 minutes. The video started facing the back of a man who was kneeling. They were in a church. No one was there but the man. It was dark. Very dark, but you could still make out the man illuminated by the moonlight seeping through the stained-glass windows. There was no sound at all. The man seemed to be sitting in the middle of an aisle in between rows of wooden benches. The floor was made up of large grey tiles. There wasn’t an ounce of colour except the light that was projected on the man. The man was dressed all in black, but their head was hidden from view. They seemed to be praying. The man then steadied himself as he raised himself on his right foot using his hands to push himself a little. Even this slight movement on the stone tiles echoed throughout the church. The man was now stood up completely with his back still facing the camera. The man began to slowly turn towards the camera-

 

“That box is still on my bed James”

 

I spiralled. My heart raced so fast I thought it was going to burst out from my chest. It was pitch black, but I still saw him. My dad was standing at the foot of my bed looking down at me. I couldn’t see his face in the dark, but he might as well of been wearing the makeup as I fumbled with the camera closing it and sitting bolt upright. I didn’t hear him come in. How long was he standing there?

 

“S- S- Sorry Dad I must have forgotten about it when I came home. I’ll get it right no-“

 

“No, No. It's okay James. It's okay. Go to bed. I’ll see to it”

 

His voice as cold as ice as I watched him shuffle out of the room.  I didn’t dare look at the camera again as I hid it under my pillow. Sleep was the last thing on my mind as I lay there paralysed. I think he knows. I think he knows I know he isn’t my dad. I stared at my open door all night. I stared until my eyes became sore and fought to close. I stared as the golden hues of the sun rising seeped through the crack in my curtains. I could make an excuse now. Something about needing to go to work early. Yeah. Yeah, that seemed good. I paced quickly to my door, already dressed since I hadn’t even time to change by the time I got in last night, and past my dad’s bedroom on the way to the stairs. I couldn’t fight my urge to look as I turned my head. The sight froze me where I stood. The bed was still as neatly made as the night before, and the box was still on it. This isn’t what scared me. The box of cameras that was under his bed is now gone. I don’t know what my “dad” did last night, but I knew I had to get out of that house.  I didn’t care about making a noise anymore as I raced down the stairs slamming into the door as I unlocked it and drove like a bat out of hell from the house for the second time in the last 24 hours.

 

I’ve contacted Detective Crawford. We’re currently investigating both the “Born” and the “Road Trip” Tapes. This isn’t the end. I’ll update you soon with what we find but I don’t know how long this will be with the rest of those cameras now gone.
