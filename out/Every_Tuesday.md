Every Tuesday night, Rick would come ten minutes before we closed, he would have a scotch, pay in cash, and leave. He was a farmer. Rick was different then everyone else. He was quiet, kept to himself. I’d always strike up a conversation with him. We both served in the military, hunted, and liked the Chiefs. 

 Our town was small. It was in the middle of nowhere, out in the Midwest. Farmers, bakers, and trains. I always felt like I lived a century in the past. Everything ran like it was the 30s. I was the only bar for fifty miles, so I got to know the residents quickly. I made friends with them. I didn’t have anywhere else to go. 

It was last Tuesday; ten minutes before closing, I saw Rick walk in. He always sits in the corner. No one else talks to him. No one else serves him. 

“The usual?” I’d ask. 

“Yeah, that’ll do,” he said softly. 

We talked about the military and the upcoming football season. Rick was acting differently tonight. He seemed on edge. Scared. I went to clean some tables. When I got back, Rick looked up at me with a gleam in his eyes and said: 

“Have you ever seen a dead body?” 

“A couple of times,” I replied. “Back in Iraq, I saw a few. None since then.” 

“You want to see another one?” 

“Haha,” I laughed. “What are you on about?” 

“I live at Parson’s farmhouse down thirty-seven, you know, the old one that burned down? It’s off Bragg Road. Come by if you wanna see it,” and at that, he stood up, paid me cash, and left. 

What the fuck was that? I thought. Old people are weird sometimes. I rang up his tab. He always paid cash and refused to sign his receipt. I wrote my name on the ticket. I don’t know why I started doing that. I kicked the regulars out, finished closing, and went home. 

Next Tuesday came. It was cold for summer. I wanted to see Rick. Our last interaction left me feeling weird and worried for the old man. I waited patiently for him all day, and ten minutes before closing, he still hadn’t arrived. For years, he’d show up at this exact time. Could set your clock to it. Not tonight. I went to the other regular and asked: 

“Have you seen Rick around lately? He’s usually here this time.” 

“Rick, who?” he replied. 

“Rick. Old guy. Big jacket even in the summer. Bald. Always sits by the jukebox. Every Tuesday, he comes in late.” The man stared at me like I was hollow.

“I don’t know who you're talking about, buddy, another one of your fantasies,” he finished his drink. Hey. Why do you always look like shit on Tuesdays? 

I left the man and went to the back room. The owner decided to hire a tech expert to install a secure system after some people went missing. Every day of every week of every year’s footage was on our computers.

I went to it and pulled up last Tuesday’s footage around eleven at night. I watched the footage. My stomach dropped when I saw that Rick wasn’t there. At first, I thought his seat was out of the frame, but then I saw myself stand up, go around the bar, towards the jukebox, and drop off a glass of scotch at an empty table. I stood there and talked to myself. 

What the fuck? Something was wrong. I checked the date, the time, and it was all correct. I went through other Tuesdays. Same thing. No one was there. I talked to myself. Poured a drink for someone who wasn’t there. Was I crazy? No. Something else was going on. 

I kicked everyone out of the bar, flicked the sign from ‘open’ to ‘closed,’ got into my car, and drove down the route Rick told me about. 

I knew Bragg Road. Parson’s farmhouse burned down there about ten years ago. Last I remember, it was abandoned. He lives there? I floored it.

When I got there, I pulled into the grass. This house looked dirty. It was a picture no one would want to frame. Hole in the roof. Rusted cars. The tire swing hung on a dead tree. I couldn’t believe someone lived here. 

I turned my car off and grabbed a flashlight and the bottle of scotch out of the passenger seat. Something in me knew where I was going. Like I had been here before. I didn’t know why I brought the scotch or the flashlight.

I went inside. The door was falling off the hinges. It was wet and cold. The wood was rotten. My foot fell through the floor and I fell. A rotten smell entered my nose. It wasn’t strong. I followed it to the kitchen. 

The kitchen had a broken cot and newspaper clippings pinned on the wall. There was something long covered in a green tarp. The same type of tarp we had used in the military. 

I pulled the tarp slowly, like a child taking off a Band-Aid too slowly. I saw him. Rick. His skin was tight. Eyes gone. His body was rotten, but I knew it was Rick. He had a bottle of scotch sitting next to him. He was wearing the same clothes I always saw him in. Big jacket. Baseball cap. Big boots. He was nearly a skeleton. Only tiny bits of flesh lingered on his near-hollow frame.

There was something else there that I couldn’t explain. A half-full glass of scotch. No dust on the rim, no fingerprints, it looked like it was poured that night. Like he poured it for me. 

I investigated the room. The newspaper clippings on the wall all told the same story about a man who vanished about five years ago. In Rick’s hand, there was a broken, bloody bottle of scotch with the bar’s logo imprinted on it.

Next to the body was a pocket knife with the initials “J.G..” inscribed. That was my knife. My initials. 

Seeing these objects set something off in my head. My mind organized memories like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. A door opened in the back of my brain. I didn’t want to see it. My body remembered before my mind did, but something in me opened, and I saw what had happened.

My vision went dark, and I got dizzy. I saw the bar. It was wintertime. I saw Rick. I heard him scream. Hands around my neck. The knife. The broken bottle. Blood on the jukebox. The tarp. 

My mind restored a memory I had buried deep.

I lost my lunch. Vomit, flying everywhere.  

His hollow eyes stared at me as I panicked. 

I killed Rick. He knew too much for his own good.

That clean glass of scotch. I poured it. 

He caught me doing something I shouldn’t have been doing.

I never left. Not for too long, anyway. 

And now I remember. 

I kept coming back to this place—Pouring drinks for a corpse.

How could I have forgotten this? 

I went back to the bar the next morning. 

Every Tuesday, Rick came in ten minutes before closing. 

And every Tuesday, I pretend he still does.
