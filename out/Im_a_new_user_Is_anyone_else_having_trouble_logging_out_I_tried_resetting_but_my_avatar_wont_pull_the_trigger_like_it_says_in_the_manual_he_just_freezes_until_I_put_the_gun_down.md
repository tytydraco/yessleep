 

Sorry if I am asking stupid questions; I am not really into games like this usually, I find them a little bit old fashioned, I am more of an action or sci fi man myself. I used to play a lot of  the, “Red takeover series” there is nothing more thrilling then blowing bad guys up with a good old lC15 anti-G laser guided grenade on mars, but lately I've been playing mostly sci fi games.  

Since the attacks on Mars, “Red takeover” feels a bit too real for me. That’s part of the reason I tried this, the other is because my mom bought it for me, “its educational” she said.  She hates all violent games, I don’t know why; playing video games is not the end of the world, I am not going to pick up a gun in real life and shoot someone just because I saw it on the game. But, she won’t buy me a new game until I finish this. Which reminds me if anyone has any cheats let me no, I just want to get through this as fast as I can. 

I’m in career mode now, and my guy is useless, he lost loads of challenges, which is so annoying, I was this close to world domination. It's my own fault, I was too impatient, if I had just waited a little bit longer for my supersonic nuke to be finished before starting that stupid war, I'd have won, and my mom would have bought me a new game.  

Doesn’t matter, next time I’ll try an easier mode like the US or China, I think I know what I did wrong anyways. That’s if I can get out of this stupid game. Number 1 open world game out there they said, “Immerse yourself in the past, build entire empires from scratch or choose from our large variety of maps.” It says on the box, “Lose yourself to the most realistic graphics on the market, you will feel like you are really there.” I suppose there not all wrong; I did get lost, and I am immersed, in the most boring game on the market. 

Although things do seem a little bit too real at times, the way you can smell and touch everything, and it's kind of eerie the way everything tastes just a little bit off; the big one is sugar, how could they get that wrong, and the after taste, yuck. But the worst has to be tea, I love it in the real world, but in here it’s like they dipped old socks into hot water. It turns my stomach even thinking about it. And does anyone know what's the deal with sleep mode, it never works straight away, and it's nearly impossible to get out of. I know the game is new, but they really need to fix those glitches, they only make the whole experience drag otherwise.  

Also does anyone know if I will lose my inventory when I reset, and if so, does anyone want to trade with me? I have built up quite a few rare items and I don’t want to waste them. 

I hope I am in the right place, there was like 9 options for inquiries in the manual, and I picked the first one I saw which was no Sleep. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated thanks.  

                                                              

UPDATE 

Finally, someone got back to me on live chat; apparently, I am not the only one having problems, the whole game is glitching. The good news is they have an update to fix it, the bad news is we have to wait 24 hours before it is done, and unfortunately everyone is going to lose their shit and there is no way of getting it back. But they promised free credits as compensation, so it's not all bad.
