It was a typical Saturday morning when I decided to take a hike in the woods. The sun was shining and the birds were chirping, and I felt a sense of excitement as I laced up my boots and set off on the trail.

As I walked, I took in the sights and sounds of the forest around me. The trees rustled in the breeze and the scent of pine filled the air. It was peaceful and serene, and I felt a sense of happiness and contentment wash over me.

But as the hours ticked by, the trail started to get steeper and the trees seemed to grow taller and more dense. The sunlight filtered through the branches, casting strange shadows on the ground.

I started to feel a sense of unease. I wasn't sure how much longer I had been walking, or if I was even on the right trail. My phone had no signal and I didn't have a map. I was completely lost.

I tried to calm myself down and think logically. I knew that I needed to find my way back to civilization before it got dark. So I retraced my steps, trying to follow the trail that I had come from.

But as I walked, the trees seemed to close in around me and the trail seemed to disappear. I was completely disoriented and my anxiety was starting to get the best of me.

And then I heard it. A low, guttural growl that seemed to be coming from all around me. My heart raced and I spun around, trying to see what was making the noise.

But there was nothing there. Just the trees and the shadows and the mist that seemed to be creeping in from all sides.

I knew I needed to get out of there. I started to run, my feet pounding on the ground as I stumbled through the underbrush. But no matter how fast I ran, the growling seemed to be getting closer and closer.

Finally, I burst through the trees and out into a clearing. And there it was. The monster. A hulking, shadowy figure with glowing eyes and sharp teeth.

I screamed and turned to run, but it was too late. The monster lunged at me, its claws slashing through the air. And then everything went black.

When I woke up, I was lying on the ground, surrounded by the twisted, gnarled remains of the trees. I didn't know how long I had been unconscious, but the sun was setting and the sky was awash in a blood-red glow.

I scrambled to my feet and started to run, my legs pumping as I stumbled through the underbrush. I could hear the monster behind me, its hot breath on my neck.

But I didn't stop. I kept running, fueled by terror and desperation. I knew that if I stopped, I would be dead.

Finally, I burst out of the woods and onto a paved road. I collapsed onto the ground, panting and covered in sweat.

I don't know how I survived that day. All I know is that I'll never forget the terror of being lost in the woods, with a monster hot on my heels.
