*“S&S Chess Club, Meets occur in library room R4. 4pm Thursdays.  Join the email list for updates at Delta Phi’s website.” a small note on the fraternity bulletin board read.*

Since pledging Delta Phi (with my older brother’s endorsement) I’ve been trying to be active with any clubs unrelated to school, more fraternity based.  This fraternity was known for being more academic (less partying), but there were wild stories about Delta Phi, but I’m not sure if I believed them yet, we’ll see.

The pledges whispered rumors about a radical, student-made book of sorts, conspiracy shit but rumored to be true, bound in a coiled binder somewhere in the university library; ever since the Delta Phi orientation party when Bob was telling tales around the bonfire, everyone has been talking about this.  

That’s where it started for me- my fascination with this book- I was deeply intrigued.  My older brother was Delta Phi alumni; he may know what the deal is with this mysterious book.

\_\_

My brother told me the book, or books (there were multiple copies), were lost in the university library a few years ago.  It was a real shame he said, his frat brothers all passed it around and there were all kinds of crazy codes in there they couldn’t decipher.  He added that the literature was so radical and weird, nobody knew what to make of it.  A senior student who nobody remembers her name now, created the books and slipped them into the library system.  The library staff found one copy and removed it, but 2 or 3 copies are still there somewhere.

Mark seemed well-prepared to tell me that story.  He added, “Different variations of the author’s name- beginning with “Ch”- have been bandied about: Cheryl, Charity, Chance, Charlotte, sometimes.” he winked, then patted me on the shoulder.

“Stay as long as you need. I gotta split, bro.” He said.

Before closing the door, Mark looked right into my eyes and said *do not look for it*, *it isn’t worth it*; it’s just fraternity hype to get the pledges excited- they want the pledges to make fools of themselves doing stupid shit in the hope of joining the fraternity.  Be careful, he warned, only certain frat members can make you do stuff, others lie and try to get you involved in something, so watch out for those fuckers.

Thursday came and hype over the books turned out to be exactly that.  I forgot all about it and attended the chess club meet up to have time away from the frattitude house.  The chess meet up room was a nice room with plants, and an old, antique oak cabinet with the university letters on it. 

I met two new friends there, Erick and Holden, both Delta Phi frat brothers, Holden being an upperclassman; plus, they were nice guys and expert chess players.  They caught me up on the history of the university’s Chess Club.  A US President was a member once; a couple students went on to become world-class chess players too.   After the meet ended, I stayed behind to study.  The oak cabinet sitting in the corner gently creaked open when Holden opened the chess room door.

“Later bro.” he said.

Inside, I found not one, but 2 bound binders- they were the lost books everyone was talking about! 

And what an unlikely place, underneath an antique chess board (the classy set they bring out once a year for the championship) sitting in this old oak cabinet in the corner of the library.  Since the pandemic Holden said they lost the key and just used a regular, modern chessboard that was easier to disinfect.  The books said Vol 1 and Vol 2.  They weren’t identical copies; they were part of a set.  How many though?

The books *were* unusual, bound in coil, photocopies and newspaper clippings pasted to paper made it appear like a psychopath created it.  There were highly detailed illustrations- despite the poor quality- of demons, angels, circuit board schematics, mathematical equations, pharmaceutical recipes, and some coding I didn’t recognize… An anarchist’s cookbook for the new age.

I put the books in my bag, closed the cabinet, and left quietly.  I was shaking with excitement- I wanted to take this directly to the frat heads- this could get me major fraternity points, but I had to confirm with Mark first.  He lived off campus in his own apartment, being a graduate student now who works.

“Where did you find these??” he asked.

“In the old cabinet in the library, inside that meeting room in the back, R4.”

“You opened that thing?!?” his eyes widened.

He scanned the book briefly, then just as quickly shut it and said, “Take these and hide them*.*”

“What?  Why?”

“I’ll tell you later, but do not lose them, take them to the frat house, hide them and do not show anybody.  Do not read them.  Ok?” he said firmly.  He immediately picked up his phone.

“Ok, Gandalf.” I replied.

*“Don’t fuck around!”*

My brother could be an asshole sometimes, but why can’t I read them?  I kinda did already when I showed Erick after the chess meet, back at the frat house.

“What is the meaning of these books?” Erick asked.

“I don’t know,” thumbing through the pages, “looks like a thesis gone pear-shaped into conspiracy theory nonsense.  The illustrations are fascinating though.” I contemplated.

“It’s probably nothing.” Erick was trying to be practical. “Maybe show Bob?”

\_\_

I knocked on the door of the senior fraternity advisor’s office, Bob.  I knew him well, so I felt comfortable showing him.  He asked if he could borrow one of them for the night.  I hesitantly said, “Sure… I’ll come back tomorrow afternoon to pick it up?”

He didn’t answer right away, he was too enthralled with the book.  My gut was telling me I’m not seeing this book again.

Bob looked up briefly, “I heard there were 3 total.  This must mean the third book is Vol 3, the missing book.  But, don’t let me keep you from your studies.  And Thanks Brother.  You may have a bright future here at Delta Phi, *friend*.”  He then he uttered the Greek words for ‘job well done’.  I can’t recall the words exactly, but I think that’s the expression.  

“Call me tomorrow.” he said as I walked out.

The next afternoon, Bob was absent, and he didn’t reply to my texts all day.  He didn’t return to the frat house either that night. 

The next afternoon a UPS truck delivered a small package- overnighted & signature only- with an obviously phony name: “Jeremiah 7”  What??

It was addressed to Delta Phi, so I signed for it even though there was no Jeremiah 7 here I was aware of, then I opened it (I was on house duty that day).

Inside a white box with a Skull & Swords logo in gold foil on the lid, contained a severed hand inside a plastic bag. I just stared at it in horror; this can’t be real.  Then the UPS truck pulled away revealing a dark blue van across the street, it screamed ‘surveillance’.  A reflection of light on the lenses revealed a man holding binoculars; this set off my fight of flight response, so I ran out back to my car.

I drove quickly down the path between the rows of frat houses to my friend Sara’s house.  I needed to show the other book to someone who wouldn’t take it from me.  I realized I was still holding the white box, so I placed it in a cooler in my backseat.  I couldn’t deal with that horror right now.

Sara and I studied Vol 2, noting it was divided up into chapters, each one containing an illustration, a page of text in Latin, and most interestingly, outdated computer code from the early 80s.

“Nobody uses this computer language anymore, but there are ways around that.”  Sara is an expert on this stuff, so we arranged to meet at a computer lab after classes.

“I think these are early versions of 3D map-making software; think coordinates on a globe and corresponding points in space.” she mused.

We attempted to transfer the code several ways, but to no success; yet Sara wanted to continue working on it.  Instead of lending her the book, we carefully scanned each page onto a hard drive.  It took a very long time to do this, so I used that time to think, with plenty of time to study our shoes- Sara’s pink running shoes were in stark contrast to my old, black Nike’s.  I placed my head in my hands on the library’s copier, trying to make sense of it all.

Throughout the next day I kept receiving calls from random numbers.  Finally, I answered, “Hello?!”

It was Sara.

“Matt, trust me, this isn’t a prank, I got one of the programs to work.  You’re not gonna believe it… (static)… I, I gotta run.”

I didn’t even get a word in before she hung up.  Sara’s cellphone has been shut off too.

Between the severed hand and that phone call, I took the remaining book and locked it in my gym locker until this blows over, or I see Bob again.

Back at the house nobody recalled seeing a UPS delivery truck that day.

“Dude, you’re nuts. Have a beer.” one pledge said, throwing me a tall IPA.

“Has anyone seen Bob?” I asked the group.

Everyone looked at each other confused, then shook their collective frat-heads.

*\_\_*

*I couldn’t reach Sara, or Bob; it was time to speak to my brother again.*

“Mark, there was a severed hand delivered to the house, and…” I paused to catch my breath, on the verge of tears.

“Dude, dude.  It’s ok man, *it’s just a fraternity prank*.  The guys got you.” He laughed.  “Just play along from here, if you make it to the end, they’re gonna make you a frat brother.  Don’t tell them I said that, obviously.”

Ok, phew.  I felt better.  It is a fucking prank.  What was Sara talking about?

Then Erick called.  Shit, I forgot I showed him the books too.  Maybe that was a bad idea…

Before I could tell him to *not* panic, he told me what happened to him earlier that day.

“Matt, I was walking along the path behind the house when a dark van pulled up and someone grabbed me!  He first asked me where those books are, he was wearing a clown mask, then after a couple minutes of me shitting myself he pulled off the mask and welcomed me to the fraternity- it was Bob!  It’s just frat hazing man.”

I sat back and had a few beers with my soon-to-be frat brothers, relaxed.  I guess I am next to be “kidnapped” to complete the initiation.  At least they didn’t make me try to have sex with a goat or something.  Then I remembered the white box in my car.  I ran out to inspect the plastic bag and its contents; I had never opened it.

Suddenly, a dark van pulled up, the brakes screeching on the pavement.  Just like Erick said, someone in a mask grabbed me and pulled me into the van.  He wasn’t wearing a clown mask, this was more ornate, like a Pagan mask.

“Where are the books, Matthew?” the masked man demanded.  He didn’t sound like Bob.

I pretended to be scared until they would eventually drop the act.  The masked man opened the white box, pulled out the contents from the bag, and let out a terrifying scream; the van soon filled with the odor of rotting flesh.  I almost vomited.  I turned to my side, there was a body in a large sack next to me, motionless.  A pink shoe poked out of the bottom of the sack.

The masked man went into a rage, “Why do they do this??” he screamed, then threw the severed hand at the driver of the van- an unknown accomplice wearing a ski mask.

The man in the Pagan mask pulled out large gardening shears from a bag of cutting tools, placed my pinky between the blades, then asked again, “Matthew, where are the books??  *I am getting impatient!”*

“Wait!  No!  Please god, nooo!” I screamed as the van peeled out, and pressure was applied to the…

*“Hey Bob, have you seen my brother, Matt?”*

*“Nah, we’re waiting for him on the corner still.  One of the guys told me he ran out of the house earlier, so we may pack it in.  No worries though, your bro is in Delta Phi.  See you at the party tonight.” Bob finished.*

*He removed the clown mask, threw it into the nearest garbage can, and walked into the fraternity house.  The van driver headed back to the van rental place.*
