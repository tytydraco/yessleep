“So, which one, red or black?”

I sighed and looked up from my paperwork to find Tracy’s glossy pink phone hovering three inches from my face. On the screen, two pictures stood side-by-side of her curvaceous figure in the same provocative pose, adorned in two different sets of extravagant and yet flimsy lingerie.

*Neither.*

Pushing a few stray locks of scarlet hair back into place behind my ear, I shook my head. “Yeah, I’m not really into stuff like that. I’m more of a simple-and-comfortable kind of person.”

Tracy rolled her sapphire-blue eyes, sat upright on her perch atop the corner of my the desk, and blew another bubble in her gum. “You’ll never get a man in your jammies, Andrea. Seriously, you’ve got a killer body, all you need is some lacy stuff, maybe a little school-girl outfit, and *boom*. Instant Maxim material.”

I suppressed a shudder at the mental image that conjured up and focused on going back to filing local police reports by chronological order. “No thanks. If some guy likes me because I’m dressed like a minor in a thong, then I don’t want to get to know him, much less bring him around my little sister. That’s creepy.”

“I think it’s hot.” Tracy grinned, and returned to scrolling through her online portfolio, with all its likes, shares, and countless stomach-turning comments left by her loyal ‘patrons.’ “Besides, the site I’m on pays good money for feet pics. Seriously, I sometimes get more for that than regular photos.”

*Gag.*

I slid my swivel chair back and grabbed a random handful of papers to head for the big industrial copier. “I’ve got copies to make. Hey, don’t forget those account rosters for the water department, alright? Monica wants them by next Thursday.”

Relieved to be away from my coworker’s obsession with herself, I dove into the little side alcove where the ancient copy machine stood and pressed the button for a hundred copies of nothing. While the printer spat out blank sheets of paper, I leaned back against the wall, and rubbed my face with both hands.

Life in Barron County Ohio had always been pretty normal, even if boring. The world seemed to forget that we were even here, and for the most part, the county residents were just fine with that. I’d enjoyed working at the local courthouse, despite being paired with a girl who spent more time chasing men than she did filing paperwork. It wasn’t that I didn’t like Tracy, since she could be rather nice when you got her phone away from her, it’s just . . . she reminded me too much of the one area in life I’d failed at miserably.

It wasn’t that I had problems with getting guys to look at me, especially once I quit my tom-boy phase during freshman year and started wearing dresses instead of hand-me-down jeans. Being pretty had felt nice, until one jerk at high school prom got drunk and called me a worthless slut in front of everyone for not wanting to shag in the back of his car. After that, I hadn’t worn anything girly for months, and even when I did finally work up the confidence to dress nice again, I’d avoided dating like the plague. It made the dreary nights after getting out of work that much lonelier, in my dingy little apartment, with no one to talk to but my pet goldfish, Alejandro. I wanted a solid relationship, wanted to find a nice guy who wouldn’t run out on me like my mother had, but I honestly didn’t know where to start.

*Sean seemed nice.*

That thought put a smile on my tired face, and I shut my eyes to enjoy the memory, like a sweet, gooey caramel chocolate from the local grocery store. Sean Hamond. Talk about a *hunk*. He had big broad shoulders, dark hair that looked soft as silk, and this warm, care-free smile that I could never look away from. Tracy made it her mission to seduce him from the first day he walked in the courthouse door, dressed in that navy-blue sheriff’s deputy uniform that fit like a glove, but he’d only responded with polite disinterest to her not-so-subtle advances. Once he’d gone, Tracy declared in an annoyed huff that ‘he must be gay’, which made me giggle under my breath, since it was clear she would have wrapped her legs around Sean in a heartbeat. Any girl would have.

In my wildest of dreams, I sometimes imagined what it’d be like to kiss him, to hold his hand, and feel his strong arms around me.

Then, over a month ago, the news came in, rocking the entire community to its core. A bloody shooting at the sheriff’s office, multiple dead and wounded, and the culprit . . . Sean Hamond. Sheriff Wurnauw declared him guilty of organizing domestic terrorism and claimed that Sean fired first in a grand scheme to further political hatred. Many people believed it, including Tracy, who seemed to hate Sean simply because he’d been the one man in the county government who turned her down.

Myself, I didn’t know what to think, not when I heard that Deputy James Walker had been killed, and that the security footage had been ‘accidentally’ deleted. Sean never struck me as a cold-blooded killer, and from what little I’d known of him, he and Walker were close, like brothers. He’d always blushed whenever our eyes met over the partition on my desk, which I’d found kind of cute, considering Sean was big enough to snap me in half. He never got impatient with me, and never threw out any of the typical, crude pickup lines that compared me to some degrading number scale like a market cow. Instead, Sean just turned that adorable shade of red whenever I smiled at him and asked me how my day was going. It was almost like he wanted to say something every time he came in, but never managed to work up the courage to do it.

*Tracy would be green with envy, and I wouldn’t be spending my evenings here.*

Opening my eyes, I glanced down at the black nylon duffel bag stowed behind a stack of copy paper where no one else could see it and checked my watch. 7:45. We’d stayed way later than usual to catch up on some backlogged paperwork (and get some nice overtime pay), but I knew Tracy would be leaving soon. She usually ducked out fifteen minutes before any designated quitting time, which was perfect, because it gave me all the space I needed to do my ‘second’ job.

“Hey, I’m heading out.” Tracy appeared like clockwork from around the corner, expensive pink Gucci handbag slung over one arm, and checked her honey-colored hair with her phone as if I wasn’t even there. “You’re good with finishing up here, right?”

*As if saying no would make a difference.*

“Yeah, I’ll be fine.” I plastered on a thin faux smile, and slouched against the stack of paper to ensure she couldn’t see the black bag. “You go, and I’ll lock up. See you tomor—”

“Okay bye.” Tracy chirped and spun on one heel to sashay toward the door, her cherry-red stilettos click-clacking on the floor tiles in a mocking rhythm.

Both annoyed and relieved to see her go, I massaged my forehead, and tapped the cancel button on the printer so that the tide of blank pages would end. More than anything, I wanted to go back to my shoebox apartment above Horten’s Dry Goods store, take a hot shower, slip into the soft cotton pajamas that made Tracy cringe so much, and crawl into bed. But I had important work to do, and even if it meant another short night, and another long, exhausted day at the office tomorrow, it had to be done.

Grabbing the black nylon bag, I hefted it onto one shoulder with a soft metallic *clank* of the objects inside, and marched for the stairwell.

I walked past every office, checked every floor, and locked ever last exterior doorway, before making my way to the dusty Animal Control office in the corner of the third floor.

Black Oak’s animal control department had been vacant since last year, when our old dogcatcher, Mr. Ruscotti, died from a stroke. No one seemed to want his rather thankless job, and so the office sat empty, while the locals were left to deal with problematic animals on their own. However, Mr. Ruscotti left behind all his county-issued equipment in the slender green gun safe that stood behind his old desk, which I’d managed to get the key to after copious amounts of snooping. He didn’t have much, since stray dogs, cats, raccoons, and deer didn’t require a lot to put down, but he did have a long, black .22/250 bolt action rifle with a scope, bipod, and best of all, a fat cylindrical suppressor.

A few weeks prior, I’d slipped into the office late after work, and stole it.

Shutting the door to the office, I made sure the shades were drawn, tugged off my work blouse, dropped my skirt, and stepped out of my slip-on flat shoes. From the duffel bag at my feet, I produced my black cargo pants, a black long-sleeved T shirt, and the dark gray sneakers I kept for running and casual wear. An ebony bandana covered my crimson hair once I tied it back, and I wiped my face clean of the day’s makeup with a towelette, only to daub greasy dark face paint over my porcelain skin.

A pair of black latex gloves slid over my fingers, and I pulled the disassembled rifle from my bag to fit it together, screwing the suppressor onto the threaded muzzle. The rifle didn’t fire a heavy bullet, but it was fast and quiet, thanks to the ‘can’ as my grandfather would have called it.

Having served as an air-cavalry scout in the Vietnam War, Grandpa taught me how to shoot from the time I could walk, despite my mother’s screeching about how she wanted me to learn piano instead. I could still remember holding that old Marlin lever-gun behind our house, with Grandpa behind me so I wouldn’t fall over from the recoil, and my mother watching with a sour, hateful frown from the living room window. She’d ended up divorcing my father, and dad then married the woman who gave birth to my now 12-year-old stepsister, Lucille, so I couldn’t really complain.

*I wish you were here, grandpa. You were always a better shot than me.*

Truth be told, aside from the shooting aspect, I felt as much a fish out of water with this line of work as Tracy would have been in a church, but I had no other choice. No one else would believe me, the sheriff seemed too busy hunting ‘terrorists’ that may or may not have existed, and I was the only one with the cobbled-together bits of gear that could pull this off. Ever since I’d first seem *them*, crawling through the side streets of Black Oak from my apartment window, I’d known that someone had to do something, anything to stop them. They weren’t normal. They weren’t safe.

And there were more of them with each passing night.

Looking myself over to be sure I’d covered anything that could glint, shine, or stand out, I zipped up the duffel bag, shouldered it along with the rifle, and climbed the metal ladder bolted to the far wall.

The sheet metal access hatch swung open with a low *creak* of rusty hinges, and I clambered out onto the flat tarpaper roof on all fours like a cat. Cool wind brushed my painted check, a comfortable 55 degrees, and the stars began to glimmer in the night sky overhead. Below me, the last of the day’s traffic slowed down, people went inside for the night, and lights started to switch off all across town as more working-class people hit the sack. From the top of the three-story red brick courthouse, I had a perfect vantage point over the entire town, and already my eyes picked up flickers of movement in the shadows.

*Early again. If this keeps up, they’ll be moving in daylight soon, and then . . . dear God.*

I opened the black plastic trash bag I’d stashed there a few days ago and pulled out an olive-green rubber yoga mat. This I rolled out over a round wooden turn table from the local flea market, one I’d repurposed to allow me to rotate my prone shooter’s position any direction I wanted to with a simple metal locking lever.

Cranking it around to face the downtown area, I clicked the little metal legs of my rifle’s bipod into position, and set my rifle on the table, along with a red box of subsonic hollow-point cartridges. My black duffel yielded the last two pieces of equipment; a small, lightweight plastic remote-control drone, and a simple hardware store hatchet.

Looking at the smeary black stains that refused to come out of the wood grain on the hatchet handle, I smothered a wave of nausea. I didn’t mind the shooting part, even if it was stressful, and time-consuming. It was the cleanup afterwards, creeping around at 1:00 in the morning through quiet yards and fences, with my hatchet in hand, praying I didn’t get caught. All it would take was one slip up, one terrified person giving the sheriff a phone call, and I’d be dead, or on the run.

*Kinda like Sean right now, I figure.*

My face burned despite being all alone, and I shook the memory of his handsome face from my head. I couldn’t think about that stuff right now, I had to focus. *They* were rising, I could almost feel it in the still night air.

Turning my drone on, I set it on autopilot, and charted the course I’d planned out for it to take over the sleepy skyline of my hometown. Its camera seemed to be in order, along with the onboard thermal sensors I’d ‘appropriated’ from Mr. Ruscotti’s old trail camera he’d kept in a dusty crate in his office. Wiring them into the drone had been tricky to say the least, but the internet is full of people who love doing nerdy things, and I owed a big thank you to the computer geeks of the world.

With an electric buzz, the four engines of the drone whirred to life, and soared off into the sky. I strapped the phone to my wrist with an old gym armband so I could see it with minimal movement, and sighed.

*Okay, it’s go time.*

I took a moment to stretch, made myself breath in and out, slowing down my heartbeat, and got down behind the gun. Digging into the red cartridge box, I clicked five shiny brass rifle rounds into the weapon’s receiver and racked the bolt home.

*Beep-beep.*

My phone dinged with the preset thermal signature alarm, and I looked to find it hovering over a position 200 yards to my west.

Pivoting the jerry-rigged turntable, I swung into the right angle, and locked the orange safety handle down to hold it in place.

“Alright,” I whispered under my breath, and peered down the scope into the shadows of Barron County’s largest town. “Come out, come out, wherever you are.”

As if on cue, a wriggle in one of the outer suburban yards caught my attention.

I let the glowing crimson reticle of the digital scope rest over the distant shape.

The mailbox was like any other in the small farming town of Black Oak. A simple treated wood post hammered into a neatly kept grass lawn, topped by a cheery red metal box, with a little triangular flag bolted to the side. It stood with countless others at the edge of the quiet asphalt street, flag down. To anyone who didn’t know, it all looked perfectly normal, peaceful even, a Norman-Rockwell painting of a rural community caught somewhere between the suburban 50’s and the dusty 40’s.

Barely discernable in the long shadows of the streetlights, I caught a blur of motion as the little mailbox’s flag swiveled to stand vertically upright, all on its own.

*Exhale.*

I pushed the air from my lungs and slid the rifle’s safety switch to the *off* position with my thumb.

*Inhale.*

Placing the crosshairs over the metal box, I watched the wooden post split, the pieces twisting at impossible angles to break away, and plant themselves onto the soft grass in an eerie, beetle-like set of legs.

*Exhale.*

The mailbox shook loose crumbles of dark soil from it’s four sharp wooden feet and stretched in an almost feline way. No longer pretending to be anything other than the nightmare that it was, the creature stood around four feet high, its legs ending just under the small metal mailbox, with several wriggling black appendages slithering out of the vent-holes in the sides. These bobbed and wove through the air, tasting the scent of the breeze, and through the scope, I could just catch the glimmer of no less than six tiny black eyes on the larger stalks peering around cautiously.

My sights floated down at the bottom of my long breath out, and I squeezed the cold steel trigger.

*Snap.*

It wasn’t perfectly quiet, even for the sub-sonic ammunition I was using, but I figured the suppressor had dampened the report enough that most people would never hear it. Despite the scope rocking at the slight recoil, I still grinned at the sight of the thing being thrown to the ground, its wooden legs kicking, black tendrils writhing in death throes. They didn’t take more than one or two bullets usually, and most bled out by the time I got to them. But what they lacked in durability, these strange chameleonized beings made up for in numbers.

“Eat it, freak show.” I racked the rifle bolt to send a smoking, spent casing clattering to the rooftop beside me. “Now, where’s your friends at?”

It didn’t take more than one sweep back and forth to catch a pair of them skittering over a parking lot near Black Oak Elementary School. A blue one, and one with a box shaped like some fairy-princess castle, searched the abandoned playground, their smaller ‘feelers’ probing the ground, as if they could smell the residual scent of children. The blue one perked up by a lonely swing set and turned toward a nearby row of houses, it’s princess-castle companion not far behind.

*They can track people now. They’re getting smarter.*

Under my finger, the trigger clicked back, and the rifle bucked against my shoulder in a soft, comforting jolt.

Down went blue mailbox, a spray of the thick, black goo that resided inside their metallic heads spattering a nearby parked SUV. I felt bad, knowing the owner would be furious to find weird black stains all over their car, but that was better than waking up to the sounds of their son or daughter being dragged out their bedroom window, kicking and screaming. Besides, I’d seen these things pounce on more than one unsuspecting dog, and the freaks liked to feed on their victims before they were dead.

A second spent casing *clinked* to the tarpaper, and as soon as the bolt slid into battery on another waiting cartridge, I panned left to follow the princess-castle mailbox.

*Snap.*

Malicious triumph formed into a grin on my face, as I watched the evil creature fall into what would have been an epic face-plant if it had a face to fall on, the legs flying up in the air like a cartoon character. I had to admit, it felt good, watching them bite the dust.

*Beep-beep.*

My drone moved on, another sensor kicking off as it spotted more mailboxes crawling free from their hiding places. I still had no idea where they were coming from, twice as many tonight as there had been four nights ago, and I dreaded how long I’d have to stay up just to collect all the bodies. I’d found out the hard way that you couldn’t just leave them lay with the hopes that, in the morning, someone might find them and report it to the proper authorities. Whatever strange insides these things had would always dissolve into nothing but fine, ashy powder after death, leaving only a splintered wood post, and a bullet-riddled mailbox. The police thought it was just a bunch of kids playing tricks, though I noticed that Wurnauw had them clean up all the mailboxes that I didn’t manage to get, as if he didn’t want anyone looking too close.

*Less than 10,000 people in this town, and we’ve got more secrets than some small countries.*

*Beep-beep.*

Another alarm chimed from the south side, this one closer, and I spun myself to face it, chambering a fresh round. There were a lot of newer homes on the south side of Black Oak, mostly younger middle-class families with kids. This was a favorite target of the mailboxes, due to the prevalence of household pets like dogs, which made for easy pickings.

“Please be a stupid one.” Electric nervousness tingled in my blood, my mouth ran dry, and I wished I could take a few minutes to grab a drink of water. “Just poke your ugly head out, come on.”

I found a shape that didn’t quite blend in with the other shadows, and all my hopes were dashed.

It was hard to see, but I could just make out the glimmer of a square metal mailbox making its way through a side yard, the warm yellow glow of the house lights beaming through the nearby windows. A middle-aged woman with dirty-blonde hair stood on the other side of one of the windows, folding clothes in a laundry room. One window over, a little boy stood with his pudgy hands pressed to the glass. I could see the toys scattered over his room in the background, little action figures and Legos, but he paid them no mind. Instead, the kid, who looked no older than six, peered out his window with an innocent curiosity.

Sweat beaded under my bandana, and I had to fight rising panic in my chest, whispering under my breath as if somehow the poor boy would hear me from a quarter mile away. “Don’t do it, kid. Just turn around. Walk away.”

Raising his hand, the toddler cocked his shaggy-haired head to one side and rapped a set of tiny knuckles on the window glass, as if signaling to the shape in the yard.

*No, no, no, don’t do that.*

The mailbox froze just beyond the reach of the lights, and from the way the boy tensed, I could tell that they had both spotted each other.

Frozen to the spot, his round pink face now a mask of sheet-white fear, the boy watched as the mailbox crept up to the window, it’s tall black insectoid eye stalks leering down at him.

The mailbox rose to its full height, like some spider from a crazy mushroom-trip dream, and braced itself against the outside wall, one leg poised to shatter the glass like a hammer. Its metal door slid down like an oversized jaw, and a mass of black, sinewy muscle slithered out, opening up to reveal ring after ring of razor-sharp teeth. More black tendrils emerged from the box, spreading out like a fan of tentacles, the eye stalks arching to look straight down at the kid from above. The creatures didn’t make any noise, and they didn’t have to. Just seeing them could freeze someone with fear, and I could only imagine what that poor little boy was thinking.

*It's too close.*

I couldn’t shoot for the midsection, since if the bullet passed through, I’d hit the kid. But if I didn’t shoot, that *thing* would lunge through the window, fasten its multiple jaws over the boy’s head, jam its black tendrils into his eye sockets, and crack open his tiny skull to devour every ounce of the grey matter he had. It was their signature move, one that I’d seen repeated on countless stray dogs, cats, and the one poor old homeless guy down by the library. A truly cruel, and hateful way to kill.

*You don’t have to hit the bullseye, Andrea. You just can’t miss the target.*

Grandpa whispered from days long gone, and I could almost feel his gentle hands under my arms, helping me to hold my rifle steady.

*Snap.*

With a surprised jerk, the mailbox flinched away from the window, my rifle round plowing a neat hole through its extended wooden leg. The glass of the window shattered under the impact of the bullet, and inside, the toddler finally screamed at the top of his lungs and ran for his bedroom door. I could see the blur of his mother dashing from the laundry room at the sound of her child’s cries, and no doubt the boy’s father was doing the same from wherever he was in the house.

Angry, and dripping dark rivulets of ebony from its wound, the mailbox rounded on the window with a pathetic, flopping gait.

*Snap.*

I sent another zipping lead bullet into the wall to it’s left to herd the freak away from the house, my heart ramming against my ribs with barely-controlled panic.

Whirling away from the building, the mailbox cast around the yard with its oily black eyes, searching for the source of its torment.

My clammy fingers yanked on the rifle bolt, and I chambered the last round in the gun’s internal magazine.

“Start running, creep.” I hissed, and squeezed the trigger, sending a geyser of dirt up just to the left of the creature’s right front leg.

Startled by the renewed attack, the mailbox abandoned the house and scuttled back over the yard, trailing that pitch black goo from its broken leg with every step.

I snatched at my ammo box, clumsily trying to shove more cartridges into the rifle, one of the rounds sticking vertically in the magazine to block the bolt.

*“No signatures detected.”* Chirped my phone in a cheery female AI voice.

*Son of a . . .*

It had vanished into the dark shadows, where the mailbox would no doubt lick its wounds, and perhaps even heal enough to regain its full strength for another night of terror. At least the window had shattered so the parents of that little boy wouldn’t know to look for a sniper. Besides, the poor kid had gotten a pretty clear view of what was out there, though I doubted anyone would believe him. They’d most likely file a complaint with the sheriff’s office, tape plastic sheeting over the broken window, and let their son sleep in their room while he tried to warn them about the monsters outside.

*I hate this so much.*

I rested my head against the stock of my rifle and choked back a stress-filled sob. Too close. That had been too close. The first time I’d seen a mailbox attack a dog, it had been unbearable to watch. But when they’d pounced on the homeless guy, I’d been violently ill, and couldn’t sleep that whole night. That had been the catalyst to push me to do this, and yet in my nightmares I still saw him, with both eyes and the top of his skull gone, dark black goo running down his weathered face, staring up at my window from the street with a wide eerie grin.

*Bee-beep.*

Another alert rang out, and I sniffled, doing my best to calm down.

*Beep-beep.*

Confusion wrinkled my brow, and I glanced at the phone. The drone showed that the signatures were moving, both coming closer from the north.

*Beep-beep, beep-beep.*

The blood in my veins ran ice cold, and I cranked my homemade sniper’s turret around to face the direction of the alerts. They kept coming, more and more beeps, and something about the barrage of thermal readings made my heart skip a beat. Why were there so many in one spot? Even these bizarre things only ever worked in ones or twos, never *four* at once.

*Beep-beep.*

Five. Dear God, there were five of them? Try as I might, I panned the scope around the east side of town, but couldn’t detect a shred of movement, my pulse racing faster.

Overhead, the faint buzzing of my drone whirred through the air and hovered not twenty feet away.

Almost like it was tracking a target.

*Oh no.*

Glass shattered somewhere below me, maybe on the second floor, and I rolled in a panic off the wooden table.

*Clack, clack, clack.*

Sharp pointed wooden feet skittered over the brickwork of the courthouse, and my drone whirred in its preset circle above me, oblivious to my terror. My phone lit up with little red indicator dots clustered all around my position, and I feverishly worked the bolt of my rifle to clear the jammed cartridge.

A single greasy black eye stalk slid over the edge of the rooftop, its dark retina blinking with a wet *squish*, and it scanned the tarpaper surface.

We locked gazes, and five more stalks joined the first, with ebony eyeballs of varying sizes, but all leading to the same creature that waited just beyond the edge of the roofline.

Cold fear seeped through my spine, like someone had poured ice water down my back, and I fought the urge to scream. Small whispers in the back of my head told me not to move, that it was better if I stayed still, that it wouldn’t hurt so bad if I just gave in.

In a fluid, spidery motion, the mailbox heaved itself up onto the rooftop, its box coming into view, a yellow one painted like a school bus. A second crawled into view on my left, with the legs of a third groping for traction not far to my right. They were boxing me in, like hounds with a cornered rabbit.

*Come on, focus. Don’t look at their eyes, don’t look at them. Just breathe.*

Breaking my gaze from the school-bus mailbox, I shook my head to clear the now hateful whispers away and brought my rifle up. This close, the scope was useless, so I tilted the gun to simply aim down the long steel barrel, placing the end of the round suppressor over the bright yellow bus.

*Snap.*

Rocked backward by the shock of the bullet, the mailbox’s macabre wooden legs caught on the tarpaper to send it tumbling over the roofline. I didn’t see it hit the hard asphalt parking lot below; I didn’t need to, thanks to the awful *crunch* it made upon impact, like an enormous cockroach being smashed under a boot.

In a blur of speed, the mailbox to my left, a green metal one with a football helmet sticker, leapt into the air with all four legs outstretched.

I dove to one side just as it came down, the little door of the mailbox flying open to let the internal morass of black tissue and white teeth jut forth. The third one lunged from the opposite side, its Boston Red Sox themed box sprouting a forest of black tendrils to reach for me like the drunken jerk from my high school prom.

Pushing the barrel of my rifle up, I caught the thing just under its box with the tip of my suppressor. Too small to hold my own, I was thrown onto my back on the rooftop, the buttstock of the gun ramming into the tarpaper beside me by the momentum of the creature.

Suspended right over top of me, the mailbox’s greasy tendrils wriggled to get at my face, still not smart enough to realize it only needed to bat the rifle out of the way to give itself the room it required.

My pale fingers snatched at the rifle bolt, and I worked it to slam another cartridge into the chamber, yanking down the trigger.

The usual *snap* was muffled by the density of the body it spat up into, and the Red Sox mailbox slumped down on my left, a crumple of twitching wood and wrinkled metal. Black goo sprayed up into the night sky, and sticky droplets rained down on my face and arms.

*Gotta move, gotta get inside.*

But even as I rolled to a crouch, the green football-helmet mailbox pounced again, so close I could smell the stench of wood-rot on its foul breath.

Without time to reload, I instead mimicked the old-school bayonet lessons grandpa had taught me in the backyard all those years ago, and drove the brunt of my suppressor into the open mouth of the fiendish thing.

I grunted and strained, my sneakers slid on the smooth tarpaper, all my tired muscles screaming for relief. But the mailbox was caught off guard, trying to remove the rifle from its mouth without success, and both its back legs slipped over the edge of the roof.

With a final desperate war cry, I shoved, and watched the mailbox fall away into the inky shadows, a resounding *whump* telling me that it had met its fate far below.

*That worked? Holy cow, that actually—*

My bandana was ripped from my head, and a hundred tiny teeth grazed past the skin of my scalp.

Screaming, I ducked, and turned just in time to put the jam between me and a writhing knot of black tendrils.

The mailbox had snuck up behind me, and only my loose cotton bandana saved me from having my brains sucked out, tangling in the fiend’s mouth like an obnoxious candy-wrapper. I shoved at the box, feeling the slimy tendrils snake around my arms to paw at my face, the gnashing mouth grinding on the polymer stock of the rifle with mindless hate.

My elbow bumped the steel head of the hatchet tucked into my belt, and I risked bracing my right shoe against the monstrosity to reach for it.

*Whack.*

I brought the hatchet down on the beast’s head again and again, chopping away spaghetti-like tendrils and eye stalks with every blow. The mailbox fought back, slashing at my face and arms with tiny hooks on the end of its tendrils like razor blades. Sour-smelling black goo covered us both, two angry, hateful creatures locked in a fight to the death in the shadows. But I couldn’t get through the gray metal box of its body, my slender arms aching with fatigue, and I knew I was fighting a losing battle.

By chance, my axe blade caught the last of the thing’s eye stalks, and I jerked away as it writhed in blinded agony.

*Snap.*

It collapsed in a ball of kicking legs and dark blood, and I grinned in primal, adrenaline-fueled glee.

Motion blurred in my peripheral vision, and my smile evaporated.

Wooden legs closed over me, black jaws opened before my face, and the two of us flew in a rolling embrace of fury across the tarpaper.

A weightless sensation took over, and the roofline passed underneath me. Red brick flooded past, cold wind howled in my ears, and gravity dragged me down.

*Bang.*

Pain exploded through my right calf as a flagpole hanging from a third-story window tore right between the mailbox and I, separating us in mid-flight, and chunks of wood scattered from the mailbox’s broken leg. Fear choked the scream in my throat, stars danced before my eyes, and my world spun around me. A fuzzy cluster of black, white, and blue blobs rushed up from below, and I shut my eyes in impending dread.

*Whap.*

Taught plastic slapped against my body, and dozens of strange little angles collapsed under my weight. Disgusting smells erupted, old coffee grounds, rancid chewing tobacco, and sour milk. Everything jolted in place, like the fast-forward of my fall had been interrupted by a gigantic hand, and a chorus of squeals and crunches echoed. The breath gushed from my lungs, and I bounced once, twice, thrice, the third landing a hard, teeth-rattling *slam* onto mist-soaked asphalt.

Darkness nibbled at the edges of my vision, the soft sounds of the wind and a few honking cars in the background. Scattered rain droplets flicked at the pavement around me. A crow let out a low *quark* somewhere in the night.

I opened my eyes, and sucked in a deep, painful gasp.

My mouth tasted of coppery blood and rainwater, I could smell the rank black goo from the mailboxes on my clothes, and pain throbbed hot and fierce in my right lower leg. A thousand little aches and pains rippled over my abused body, but both arms still pushed under me to help me sit up.

Greedily, I gulped down more damp evening chill, and grimaced at the way my head swam, loose tresses of my red hair hanging in a tangled mess around my face. My spine wasn’t broken, that much was sure. All my ribs felt sore, but not so bad that I figured they were fractured. Ebony gore coated my torso, along with fresh spattering of red from my bloody nose, but aside from some nasty scratches, I seemed to be okay.

*How did I not break every bone in my body?*

Craning my head to one side, I blinked at the enormous heap of trash bags stacked up where the old metal dumpster would have been, if the county government had ever bothered to get it back from the disposal yard. They’d resorted to just stacking the trash up in the back alley behind the courthouse until pickup day, which meant sometimes a huge pile could develop. Normally, I would have wrinkled my nose in disgust at the mound of garbage, but now, I was never so thankful for so much wasted copy paper and Styrofoam cups.

*Tok, tok, tok.*

I turned to stare at the crumpled forms of two dead mailboxes, the last one that had tackled me from the roof still twitching enough to drum an eerie pattern on the brick wall beside it. One of its shattered legs had a small bullet hole, and I recognized the mailbox from the one in the little boy’s yard. Black goo pooled in a wide circle around the creature, and it occurred to me that I’d come only a few feet from landing on the wrought-iron bench that had ended it, as opposed to the soft stack of trash that had broken my fall.

*They tracked me. They let the drone see them and followed it right to my perch.*

Shaking my head, I probed my body with trembling fingers for injuries. I didn’t have time to freak out right now. If grandpa were here, he’d tell me to do a battle damage assessment, treat any wounds, and exfil to safety. I’d survived this long with his training, and there was no point in stopping now.

“Pain is just weakness leaving the body.” I murmured, reciting the adage grandpa repeated over and over his entire life.

Climbing to my feet took a solid five minutes, and I decided after careful examination that my ankle was likely sprained, but not broken. I’d go home, ice it down, and call in sick for work tomorrow. It would serve Tracy right to have to do some real paperwork for once.

Three hours’ worth of corpse-collection later, I limped to my apartment and stepped into my shower with every scrap of clothing still on. I only stripped the wet clothes off once the stench of black blood was gone and scrubbed myself down with medical-level precision. Scratches and cuts covered my skin from where tiny sharp bits of trash had poked through my clothes, but nothing too serious.

Dressing in my cotton pajamas just to spite the memory of Tracy chiding me for not being ‘sexy’ enough, I wrapped an ice pack around my calf. The soft mattress of my bed felt like heaven, and Alejandro swam a few happy circles in his tank on my nightstand, as if somehow, he knew how bad tonight had been.

“Hey buddy.” Exhausted, I grabbed my phone to put on some calming music before I let myself fall asleep. “Sorry I took so long. Work was busy.”

I accidentally hit my search engine app, and upon seeing the blinking cursor, an idea hit me.

*Maybe . . .*

Too curious to ignore it, I typed in a few different words, phrases, and names into, sifting through articles, forums, and blogs. Nothing came up about Barron County Ohio anywhere.

Then, with a hesitant finger, I keyed in *Sean Hamond.*

To my surprise, a website came up, along with a series of posts that mentioned my hometown. I read each one with increased amounts of nausea and wonder, until I came upon one that sent ripples of shock through me.

It was written by [Sean.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11vbcyo/beware_the_lights_that_walk/)

That was several hours ago. I’m typing this even as fatigue from not sleeping at all last night weighs on my eyelids, because now I know the truth. I’m not alone, there’s more to what’s going on here than I ever thought, and Sean Hamond is still alive.

Alive, and innocent.

Sean, if you’re out there, if you somehow find a way to read this, just know that I believe you. The monsters are real. Wurnauw is lying, and no one in Black Oak has any idea. But I’ll keep fighting on my end until the day you bring him to justice. I promise you that.

Oh, and if that offer for a barbeque in Collingswood is still open . . . then my answer is yes.

I’d love to go with you.
