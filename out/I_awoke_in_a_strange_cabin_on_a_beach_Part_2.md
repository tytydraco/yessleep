I apologize for the delay in my update. The following events were heavily traumatizing and it took a lot out of me to write it all out. However if anyone out there had a similar experience or knows what’s happening please reach out. I will pick up right where I left off. 

 Dad stepped forward, closing the distance to the center of the circle where Anthozoa lay.

“This creature thought she could hide here under our noses and poison the minds of our children,” he said, his voice dripping with mockery as he motioned toward the weak child lying before him.

“While her brother may have gotten away, let this be a warning to any other celestials who wish to be heroes,” he added, his words full of malice.

He grabbed my arm, pulling me towards the girl. She looked up at me weakly, her eyes filled with fear and pain.

Dad’s grip tightened, and he reached down and lifted her by the neck with one hand, holding her up for the crowd to see. I stood there, frozen in place, my heart aching at the sight of her suffering. However, I felt something new spark within me. At the same time, as I saw her hanging there, there was something else, something burning inside me- a yearning for her suffering.

“Look at how feeble she is!” Dad mocked, and the crowd erupted into laughter. The sound filled the room, and I felt small under the weight of it.

“This is the perfect opportunity to allow Elliot passage. To finally welcome him home,” Dad proclaimed, his voice echoing in the cold, dark space.

The crowd’s cheers grew louder, their voices full of excitement. He dropped her to the ground, and she landed with a sickening thud, her body weak and crumpled.

"My son," Dad said, motioning for me to come towards him. He took from his pocket and handed me a small dagger, its blade shining brightly even in the dim light of the lobby. It was gold and delicately engraved. My hands trembled as I grasped it.

“Anthozoa is the scientific name for coral,” he continued, his voice casual as he spoke to the crowd. "An odd name, I know. But I think I know just what we’ll do with her.”

I looked at the blade, still feeling its weight in my hand. My fingers curled around the handle. The crowd parted as a few members stepped forward, their hands grabbing Anthozoa’s limp body and lifting her up in front of me, holding her upright, helpless.
“Stab her in the heart for me, Elliot!” Dad roared, his voice echoing through the chamber.

I stood there, unable to move. My hands shook violently, the dagger feeling like a foreign object in my grip.

The crowd began chanting in low, guttural tones, words I couldn’t understand. The air was filled with their anticipation, their hunger for blood and sacrifice.

I couldn’t breathe. The dagger felt heavier with each passing second. The girl was still in front of me, her eyes wide with fear. She was trembling, and I could see the tears streaming down her face. I was frozen in place. I couldn’t do it.

As the chants grew louder and the crowd pressed in closer, I felt something shift. A whisper in the back of my mind, a voice that wasn’t mine, urging me, pushing me, compelling me. It was as if the very air itself was calling me to act.

“I... must,” I whispered, my voice trembling as I looked into Anthozoa’s pain-filled eyes. “I’m so sorry,” I choked, shaking uncontrollably. I inhaled sharply, holding my breath, and with a trembling hand, I placed the tip of the blade against her chest.
She winced, her body arching back in pain as her eyes fluttered, looking away.

“Elliot, please,” she whispered in a raspy, broken voice.

I pressed the knife deeper, agonizingly slow, the metal sinking into her fragile skin. Tears streamed down my face, my body shaking violently. The chanting grew louder, more frantic, more demanding. I had to do it. I needed to do it.

“Elliot, please, remember,” she said, her voice rising, but still weak. Her face was now drenched in tears.

I closed my eyes, my hands aching from how tightly I gripped the blade, but I couldn’t stop.

“Remember, Elliot!” she screamed.
The force of her cry shattered something inside me. My eyes snapped open in panic as I stumbled back onto the floor, the world spinning.

In a blur, the cloaked figures swarmed, grabbing me and dragging me into the circle.
“Stop!” I screamed, my voice raw as I clawed at the air, trying to reach her. “Don’t hurt her!”

I let out a cry, but the crowd held me down, pinning me to the ground. The knife, discarded by her feet, was snatched up by Dad.

She squirmed in the arms of the cloaked figures, her body struggling against their grip, but she was helpless. The chanting grew more deafening, the crowd’s voices merging into a choir of rage.

I watched through the sea of bodies, thrashing to break free as Dad reeled his arm back and plunged the blade into her chest.
The sound of her scream pierced through the air, breaking the chanting. I could hear her agony as the knife dug deeper, but there was something else, light, blinding, spilling from the wound in a sudden explosion of brilliance.

Her scream died just as quickly as it had started, and her body went limp. Her body convulsed violently before going slack, her chest rising and falling in shallow, erratic spasms. Dad kept carving, each stroke of the knife brought another sickening crack, her bones twisting against themselves in ways that shouldn’t have been possible.

Her limbs buckled inward as if something inside her was pulling her into herself. The smooth curve of her arms shrank away, flesh bubbling like it was melting, reforming into stubby, malformed protrusions. Her fingers curled unnaturally, bending in jagged angles until they snapped backward and fused into her. Her legs convulsed, elongating for a moment before collapsing, the skin sloughing off in thick sheets, revealing muscle that twisted and tightened like writhing tendrils. Her mouth gaped in silent agony as her jaw unhinged with a grotesque pop, stretching too wide, the skin splitting at the corners. Her nose caved inward, collapsing into a sunken void as her skull pulsed and shifted beneath the surface of her flesh. A wet, crunching noise filled the air as her body continued to warp, her ribcage collapsing in on itself with a deep, visceral crunch. Her spine twisted violently disappearing into the grotesque mass that was now her torso. Her flesh darkened, the once-soft skin becoming hard and rough. 
With one final motion, Dad wrenched the knife free. What remained of her was no longer a body, no longer a person. All that remained was a grotesque, pulsating mound of flesh and bone. I watched in horror as the last of her body solidified.

The chanting stopped abruptly and in the arms of the cloaked figures, where once Anthozoa had been, was now a sickly flesh-colored coral reef. They placed the coral on the ground, and as she touched the floor, she began to melt, her once-solid form turning soft, shifting into a smoky vapor.

The crowd’s chanting began again, this time, the rhythm was different- softer, almost soothing. Dad pulled a flask from beneath his cloak, the same kind I’d seen beneath the vials. The vapor from the coral drifted through the air and slowly found its way into the flask. Soon, all that remained was the container in Dad’s hands, glowing faintly with the strange mist inside.

“It is finished,” he declared, his voice cold and final. As his eyes turned toward me I finally lost consciousness. The walls began to shift, the wooden log walls melted into metal, the ceiling stretched upwards and the people all around me vanished. I found myself on a ship, my ship.

I remembered.

The storm was like one I hadn’t seen in ages. I ran through the loading dock, a vast, cavernous space filled with people scrambling to stabilize what they could as the ship lurched and thrashed against the raging sea. Overhead lights flickered erratically, casting the scene in stuttering flashes of yellow and shadow. Crates slid across the floor, crashing into walls and toppling over as the vessel groaned under the weight of the storm.

Through the frantic movement, my eyes locked onto Clair, my youngest sister, perched atop a ladder, gripping it for dear life. Several crew members held the base, struggling to keep it steady as the ship pitched violently beneath them. I ran, my heart pounding, desperate to help. But it was too late. The ship tilted sharply. The ladder teetered. Clair fell. The paint can she had been using slipped from her grasp, tumbling beside her, its contents spiraling through the air in slow-motion streaks. People reached out, trying to catch her, trying to predict where she would land, but the same force that had thrown her had also knocked them off their feet.

I felt myself stumble, barely managing to stay upright, just in time to see her body hit the cold, hard floor. Her small, fragile frame crumpled upon impact, her neck twisting at an unnatural angle.

I didn’t need to check. I knew. I couldn’t stop. Couldn’t think. If I hesitated, more would die.

Scrambling to my feet, I ran past the others rushing to her side. Their voices were drowned beneath the creaking metal, the cries of the storm, the distant wail of something breaking. I had no time. I sprinted through the loading dock, past shifting crates and scattered equipment, toward the lift shaft.

I looked up. He was there, gripping the railing, surrounded by others as they climbed the spiraling metal staircase that wrapped around the broken lift. Sparks flickered from the machinery, the lights above casting the shaft in eerie pulses of gold and black.

“Wyatt!” I screamed, but my voice was stolen, torn from my throat like smoke in the wind.

I had to climb. The metal stairs rattled beneath my feet as I took them two at a time. “Wyatt!” I called again, my voice growing hoarse.

A deafening crack split the air. A cable snapped, the massive lift jolted downward, a sickening shudder rolling through the shaft as the remaining cables strained under its weight. People screamed, pressing against the wall, bracing for the inevitable. I pushed forward, shoving past frozen bodies. I was so close. Wyatt turned. He saw me. Just a few more steps- 

The ship lurched violently, the final cable gave way. I watched, helpless, as Wyatt was torn from the railing. He had turned because I called his name. If only I had stayed silent. If only he hadn’t looked. He fell, and the lift plummeted after him, the metal groaning like a dying beast as it chased him into the abyss.

It hit the bottom with a thunderous, ground-shaking slam. A final, resounding impact, like the last hammer stroke sealing a coffin shut.

I ran through the hallways. Up the stairs. If I could just reach Theron- if I could save at least one.

The top deck was chaos incarnate. The sky stretched impossibly vast, a swirling void of black and gray, the rain pouring in thick, suffocating sheets. The deck was slick, gleaming with water, waves crashing over the sides in violent bursts. The ship pitched and rocked, climbing and falling, twisting beneath the fury of the storm.

And through it all, I heard him screaming.

I ran toward the bow, my legs burning, the wind trying to rip me from the deck. Below, my voice had been whisked away, but up here- it did not exist. The storm devoured every sound before it could form. I dragged myself forward, the rain hitting my skin like needles, my fingers raw from gripping the icy metal railings. And then- I saw him. Theron!

He clung to the railing at the very front of the ship, his small fingers slipping against the rain-slicked metal, his voice piercing through the howling wind as he screamed.

“Theo! Hold on! Just a little longer!”

I was so close.

And then I saw the wave. A towering endless mountain of black, rising before us like a leviathan from the deep. The ship climbed its impossible height, trembling beneath the weight of its own insignificance. I latched onto the railing beside him, bracing myself as we rode the crest of the wave.

Then the ship fell. His fingers slipped. His body lifted from the deck. He hung there, weightless, suspended in the storm’s grasp before the wind carried his small body away.

I reached out, but he was already gone, swept into the abyss. I screamed his name, clinging to the railing for dear life. The ship slammed into the sea. The impact wrenched my grip free. My stomach lurched, and my breath caught in my throat as the deck disappeared beneath me. I fell,  the darkness rising to meet me. The cold swallowed me whole.

I awoke gasping and shuddering looking around terrified as reality hit me in the face. I sat seated at a booth in the diner. Everything around me flooded into my mind so fast. Seated with me were Claire, Wyatt, Theron, my real father, and my real mother. I looked around the table speechless.

They all looked back at me with quiet, expectant eyes. The diner around us hummed with an unnatural stillness, the fluorescent lights overhead buzzing faintly, casting a sickly glow over the checkered floors. The smell of stale coffee hung in the air. My hands gripped the edge of the table, knuckles white.

“Elliot?” My mother’s voice was soft, almost unsure.

I flinched. The sound of it was wrong. Not because it wasn’t hers, but because it was. It had been so long since I’d heard it.

I stared at her, at the warmth in her expression, the way her hands were folded neatly in front of her, the way her lips curled into the smallest, gentlest smile. She looked just like I remembered. 

My father sat beside her, staring at me with that same quiet patience. He was real. Not the hooded figure, not the man who had stood above me in that circle, who had handed me the knife. This was the father I had lost. The father who raised me.

I felt sick. My stomach twisted violently. I pressed my hands against it, trying to steady myself.

Wyatt leaned forward, his brow furrowed. “You okay?”

I couldn’t answer. I looked to Claire, to Theron. Their faces were blurred at the edges, shifting slightly like ripples in water.

“Where…” My voice cracked. “Where are we?”

Claire tilted her head, eyes glinting under the dim lights. “You don’t remember?”

I swallowed. I remembered everything.

The ship. The storm. The screaming. The metal twisting. The cold, endless water. The cloaked figures. The ritual. The knife in my hands.

“I-” I started, but the words caught in my throat. I turned my head, glancing around the diner. It was empty. The clock on the wall didn’t move. None of it felt real.

I turned back to them. My parents. My siblings. My mother reached across the table, taking my hand in hers. It was warm. Solid. Real.

“You found us,” she said softly.

Something inside me cracked. Tears welled in my eyes. My breath hitched. “But… how?” My voice was barely a whisper.

Wyatt glanced at Theron, who gave a small nod. Then, slowly, Wyatt reached into his pocket and pulled something out. He placed it on the table between us.

A single, small flask.

The liquid inside shimmered- pink, shifting like something alive. I felt my stomach drop. My skin went cold.

“You remember, don’t you?” Claire asked, her voice barely above a whisper. “What he did to her?”

The pink liquid gleamed under the fluorescent lights. My fingers twitched. My breath came in short gasps.

“We have to fix it,” Theron said.

I stared at the flask.

Then at them.

Then back at the flask.

The chanting echoed in my skull, the laughter, the snap of bones breaking.

I reached for the flask.

“Pour it, Elliot,” my father said, holding a vial of brown. “Fix what you've made wrong.”

I held the flask to the vial, tilting it to pour, but as I did so, I saw my mom’s face change. It flickered, behind her warm, dark complexion, I saw Mom, her wrinkled blonde-haired head, smiling, hungry.

“You’re not my mother!” I screamed, lunging across the table and tackling her to the ground. I swung my fists into her face, pounding them into her flesh. With each impact, her face flickered, revealing Mom beneath the guise of my real mother’s face.

The others jumped up from the table. My father reached for me, trying to grab me. I swung my small arms toward his face, clocking him in the nose with inhuman force. His face flickered too, Dad, hiding behind the guise. An uncontrolled rage took over me. I hurled my body weight at him, leaving my mother on the ground. Kicking my siblings off me, I grabbed onto the grown man, clawing and biting at his face and ears. His strong arms tried to tear me off, but I wouldn’t budge. With one final swing, I knocked my hand into my father’s face, and he froze, collapsing limply to the ground.

Then my father spoke, and this time, I could tell it was really him.

“You must remember, Elliot,” he said weakly, looking up at me, unable to move from where he lay.

Behind me, my mother got to her feet and cried out, “You little brat!” She grabbed a chair and hurled it at me. I quickly socked Wyatt in the face with as much force as I could muster, knocking him limp to the ground. As I did, his voice changed. He awoke, speaking softly.

“Save us, Elliot!” He cried, lifeless on the floor.

I turned to face my other two siblings. With tears in my eyes, I grabbed Claire’s head and slammed her small face into my knee with a gut-wrenching crunch. Her body flung lifeless to the ground.

“Save us!” She shouted from the floor. 

Theron and my mother came at me. I lunged past the woman’s arms taking Theron to the ground. I stood quickly and kicked him across the face, his head snapping to the side.

“SAVE US!” My siblings screamed in unison. 

I lunged at my mother once more, tackling her to the ground. I was on top of her, pounding my fists into her face over and over and over again. I grabbed plates from the table and smashed them into her skull. She was bleeding profusely, but she still wasn’t awake. She still wasn’t my mom. As she lay there sputtering, her arms flailing, trying to pull me off, I mindlessly dug my fingernails into her face.

I grabbed at her skin and tore my mother’s face right off her skull in a manner that was completely unnatural.

I held the mask of my mother’s skin in my hands, looking down to see her disgusting, bloody face beneath me motionless. Then, impossibly, the skin I held began to speak. Her mouth moved, twisting in my grasp.

“Son, you must remember… come back to us.”

I flinched, dropping the skin mask onto the floor. Tears streamed down my face.

My family lay there, limp like rag dolls.

“Remember, Elliot,” they spoke together. “Remember!” 

As I stood there, breathless, the door to the diner slammed open.

I swung around to see none other than Erinaceus standing in the doorway. His eyes were full of more life than I had ever seen in them before.

“They are not happy, Elliot!” he shouted, glancing back behind him. “Take this!”

He threw me a sledgehammer, I recognized it from the glass breaking room, its weight slamming into my palms. A crowbar and a fire axe were clutched in either of his hands.

“Follow me!” he shouted.

I hesitated, turning to look at my family.

“They aren’t real, Elliot.” His voice cut through the chaos. “Come this way if you’d like to see them again.”

For the first time, someone had said something I actually trusted.

I turned and ran, following Erinaceus into the room with all the vials.

“You have your vial, right?” he asked, looking back at me.

I had almost forgotten about the brown vial my father had given me. I still held it tightly in my hand.

“Yes,” I said, showing it to him.

“Keep that safe!” he shouted as he swung his weapons with inhuman force into the station holding the vials. The structure exploded into shards of glass and splintered wood.

“Get over here and help!” he yelled.

I shoved the vial into my pocket and swung the hammer into the station. The impact shattered everything. Fragments of glass and liquid went flying in all directions.

And then, I heard it. Shouting and footsteps came from every direction as the doors burst open and people poured into the room.

“That is quite enough!” the man shouted, the man who called himself dad. 

Everyone in the room froze. We were surrounded by cabin members, dressed in their ritualistic attire. 

Erinaceus stood beside me, breath heaving, his fingers clenched around the crowbar and axe. Glass crunched beneath my feet as I turned to face Dad. He stood at the center of the room, calm, composed, but furious, his hood slipped back slightly. 

“I have been patient with you, Elliot,” he said, voice low and steady. “I have given you so many chances.” His gaze flickered to Erinaceus. “And yet, you let him deceive you. You let him lead you astray.” 

“Lies!” Erinaceus shouted, stepping forward.

“Silence creature!” Dad lashed back, shaking his head. 

Then, with a simple snap of his fingers, the room shifted.

The floor warped beneath me, the walls stretched. The light from the overhead lamps twisted and coiled like living things, flickering, dimming. The broken glass and liquid from the vials on the floor began to move, reversing as if time itself had started to play backward. The shattered pieces lifted into the air, mending themselves, clicking into place, the vials refilling drop by drop.

“No…” I whispered, watching as all our destruction unraveled right before my eyes.
“Run Elliot!” Erinaceus shouted. 

And we did. We hurled ourselves forward through the crowd, an ocean of bodies scrambling to seize us. Erinaceus let out a cry he let out a blinding light that split the room, sending the crowd in close vicinity to us spiraling through the air in all directions.
We drove our legs forward, one desperate step after another, through the lobby and up the stairs. I followed Erinaceus, the horde of cloaked figures shouting and surging after us. As we ran, the house began to shift, the walls tightened and the lights flickered. The halls compressed in on themselves, growing smaller and smaller.

“We just have to make it to the door!” Erinaceus shouted, his voice barely audible over the deafening groan of the shifting walls. The hallway shrank with every passing second crushing the space around us into something barely big enough to stand in. As we continued down the upper hall the walls continued to grind and tighten. Soon they pressed into our bodies and I felt myself ache as I desperately tried to squeeze through. 

I looked behind me to see Erinaceus stuck just as I was. He looked at me, his young face carrying eons of wisdom behind his eyes.

“Look away, Elliot!”

I whipped my head to the side, unsure of what was coming. A sudden heat radiated through the air, followed by a blinding flash of light so intense that it burned against my back.

The walls recoiled, widening just enough, just for a moment.

I didn’t hesitate. I threw myself forward, sprinting down the narrowing corridor, reaching the door just in time. With one final, desperate motion, I dove through it.
I turned back… but there was nothing.
The hallway behind me had collapsed in on itself, vanishing into nothingness as the door slammed shut. I sat there, panting, my chest heaving, trying to gather myself.

Slowly, I got to my feet, my mind struggling to process everything that had just happened. The hallway stretched before me, lined with arcade machines, sitting there just as they had the first time I’d come in. Their screens flickered, displaying the same images.

I knew what I had to do. My fingers tightened around the sledgehammer still in my grasp after everything, it felt light, unnatural in my hands. I felt inhumanly strong for a thirteen-year-old. 

Without any more hesitation, I swung. The hammer crashed into the machine, sending shards of glass and metal flying. Instantly, the damage duplicated itself across every other mirrored machine in the hall. I didn’t stop. I swung again and again. Over and over, the heavy hammer slammed into the arcade machine until nothing remained but a heap of twisted, lifeless metal and wires. Not even a single dying spark flickered in the ruin.

My breath shuddered from my lungs. I turned and headed back to the door, wooden and out nof place in the darkness of the tunnel.

I stepped toward it, my hand trembling as I reached for the doorknob, uncertain of what waited on the other side.

I opened the door to see the hallway- red carpet, wooden walls, dimly lit like it always had been. I stood there motionless for a moment, looking around confused. Than I noticed something, small resting on the floor. I saw a hedgehog. It waddled and snuffled around by the base of the door.

I crouched down, staring at the tiny creature in confusion and bewilderment. It was red, slick, and fleshy like the coral Anthozoa had turned into. 

Then it spoke, causing me to flinch with fright. "It's time to go back, Elliot. It's time you remember."
It was Erinaceus' voice.

The hall around me began to disintegrate, unraveling like paper burning away in a fire, revealing a vast void of stars and space. Twisting galaxies and clouds of colorful stars stretched out before me

"Fall, Elliot," the hedgehog whispered, now hovering at eye level. "Go home."
I hesitated, “Don’t be afraid.” He spoke reassuringly. 

I leaned forward, letting myself tip over the edge and fall into the swirling astral sea.
I felt weightless, drifting down, down, down, the vastness stretching and spinning faster and faster around me.

"Goodbye, my child," Erinaceus' voice echoed.

"Goodbye," came the soft voice of Anthozoa. Everything faded to darkness.



I awoke, sputtering, gasping for breath, water pouring from my mouth.

The night sky loomed above me, cold and infinite. The chill of the night gripped my soaking body, making me shudder. The intense scent of the sea filled my nostrils, as I felt the slow rise and fall of a resting sea. I let out a ragged breath of relief.

As I lay there, trembling, I heard an exasperated, tearful sob. Then arms, warm, desperate, wrapped around me.

It was my mom. She clung to me, shaking, her body wracked with cries. "I’d thought I lost you," she whispered, holding me as if she'd never let go.

I held her back, my own tears spilling over. "I'm sorry, Mom. I'm so, so sorry.” I sobbed violently in her arms.

Then larger arms wrapped around us both, the scent of oil filling my nose. My father’s voice was rough, shaking. "At least you're okay, son." Then he too began to sob softly. 

As I cried in their embrace, I knew one thing for certain.

I remembered.
