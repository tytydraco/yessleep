I didn’t think anyone would read my last post, let alone respond, but i appreciate the comments. Thank you. I still don’t know what’s happening, but knowing there are people out there who believe me gives me some hope. I wish I had better news to share, but things have only gotten worse since I last posted.

I’ll start with the good news: I’m still here. I haven’t lost my mind—at least, I don’t think I have.  I’ve been rationing what little I have left even more carefully, and I’ve started mapping out potential escape routes from Lockewood, though I haven’t worked up the courage to leave yet.

The bad news is that the knocking hasn’t stopped. In fact, it’s gotten worse. It doesn’t just happen at night anymore—now it’s at random times, sometimes in the early morning, sometimes in the middle of the afternoon. It’s always the same pattern: three knocks, a pause, then three more. It’s loud enough to rattle the door, but whenever I look through the peephole, there’s no one there.

Last night was the worst. It was around midnight, and I was lying in bed, trying to fall asleep, when the knocking started again. I tried to ignore it, but it was so loud, like someone was trying to break the door down. I grabbed a kitchen knife—I know, it’s not much, but it’s all I have—and approached the door as quietly as I could.

The knocking stopped as soon as I got close. I held my breath, waiting for whatever came next, and that’s when I heard it—the whispering. It was faint, barely audible, but I recognized the voice. It was Mrs. Granger.

She kept repeating my name over and over, like she was trying to get my attention, but something about the way she said it made my skin crawl. It didn’t sound right. Her voice was off—too high-pitched, almost like it was sped up. I wanted to scream at her to go away, but I was too scared to even move.

The whispering continued for what felt like hours, though it was probably only a few minutes. Then, as suddenly as it started, it stopped. I stood there for a long time, knife in hand, waiting for something else to happen, but the apartment was silent. I finally worked up the nerve to look through the peephole, and I swear to you, there was an eye staring back at me.

I jumped back so fast I nearly dropped the knife. When I looked again, the hallway was empty. No sign of Mrs. Granger, no footprints in the ash, nothing. But I know what I saw. I didn’t sleep at all after that. I just sat in the living room with the knife, waiting for morning.

Today, I noticed something else strange. The ash—there’s more of it, and it’s thicker, almost like snow now. It’s covering everything, and it smells like something burning, even though there aren’t any fires. The air tastes metallic, and breathing it in makes my throat burn. I tried covering my mouth and nose with a cloth when I went to the window, but it didn’t help much.

And then there’s the figures. I see them more often now, moving through the ash-covered streets. They’re still slow, deliberate, like they’re searching for something. I can’t make out their faces—they’re always turned away or hidden under hoods. They haven’t come near the building again, but I can feel them watching, waiting.

I keep thinking about leaving, but I’m terrified of what’s out there. I don’t know if those figures are sick, like Mrs. Granger, or if they’re something else entirely. Part of me wonders if they’re survivors like me, but the way they move… it’s not right. I can’t explain it, but I know they’re not like me.

I’ve been hearing things, too. It started with the whispering, but now it’s more like a low hum, almost like a generator running in the distance. It comes and goes, sometimes getting louder, sometimes fading away completely. It’s unnerving, like it’s vibrating through the walls and floors. I don’t know if it’s real or if I’m just imagining it, but it’s making it hard to think clearly.

I’ve also noticed something strange about the radio. Like I mentioned before, I’ve been getting mostly static, but now there’s something else—a faint signal, barely there, but it’s repeating the same phrase over and over: “Lockewood—hold—” followed by static, then it repeats. I can’t make out the full message, but the word “hold” keeps coming through. I don’t know what it means, but it feels like a warning.

I don’t know how much longer I can stay here. The food is almost gone, and the water is running out. The ash is getting worse, and I can feel it seeping into the apartment, no matter how much I try to seal the windows and doors. I’ve started coughing, and I’m afraid it’s only a matter of time before the sickness reaches me, too.

I’ve packed a bag with what little I have left—some food, water, a flashlight, and the knife. I’ve been staring at the door for hours, trying to convince myself to open it, but every time I reach for the handle, the knocking starts again, like it knows what I’m planning.

I’m going to try and leave tonight, as soon as it gets dark. I don’t know where I’ll go, but I can’t stay here any longer. If anyone out there has any advice, or if you’ve heard anything about what’s happening in Lockewood, please let me know. I’m scared. I don’t know what’s waiting for me out there, but it has to be better than whatever is inside these walls.

Wish me luck.
