I did not order the painting. Let’s get that out of the way right now. I was mildly buzzed, yes, but not so inebriated that I’d mistakenly click “buy now” and order the scariest painting I’ve ever seen in my life. Like most people, I like to look at stuff I’d never buy online. Last month it was houses I can’t afford on Zillow. This month, it’s paintings. If I really like one, I might save it to make it my desktop theme. That’s the extent of my commitment to supporting art.

See, I’m too poor to afford to deck my walls in original artwork, even if I wanted to order a painting. Which I didn’t.

Especially not THIS painting.

It depicted a figure in an impressionist style, sort of like the famous Munch “The Scream” crossed with the style of Rembrandt, the figure all cloaked in darkness except for the illumination on the face. The face was the most horrifying part, a fleshy patchwork of light in the otherwise dark canvas. Featureless. Indistinguishable.

Like a nightmarish figure out of a dream.

I remember staring at my phone for several long minutes, zooming in on that figure. Wondering what it was about the not-quite-human-ness of it that made it so creepy. Even through the phone screen, even with no eyes, I could swear I felt it watching me. I took a screenshot, sent it to some friends asking if it wasn’t the creepiest thing they’d ever seen in their lives? That conversation quickly devolved into us sending lots of scary art pictures back and forth, like classic paintings of spooky children, disproportionate babies, a little Bosch, and so on.

Fastforward three days. There’s a package on my doorstep waiting for me when I get home, wrapped in brown paper. I tear open the paper packaging, and it’s the painting.

THAT painting.

The featureless smear of a face stares at me from the dark canvas.

It looks so fleshy I could almost sink my fingers into it.

Now, I assumed, of course, that someone ordered the painting for me as a joke. But none of my friends would admit to it. The conversation turned to teasing about me being cursed. To me, this was just further evidence that one or all of them were playing what they thought was the world’s most hilarious prank.

And honestly, I thought it was kind of funny, too, so I went along. I hung the “cursed” painting in my living room. And that was that, it should have gone down in the book of my life as a mildly amusing footnote, something to tell guests about whenever they came into my home and asked what the hell was that creepy painting on the wall?

But…

A week after it arrived, I was sitting at my desk working when I *swear* I heard a quiet rustle. And… you know how you can feel it when someone in your periphery is staring? The sensation was *so* strong I turned around, and I almost screamed.

The painting had eyes… and they were watching me.

And I swear to God, swear to you on everything holy, it *blinked.*

Maybe the blink was just my imagining. But it definitely had newly painted eyes there in its fleshy impressionistic blotch of a face. Smears of darkness with just a tiny hint of light reflecting from them.

Of course I snapped a photo and sent it to my friends. And of course they all assumed I’d painted on the eyes *myself*. Even I had to admit, when I got up close, it was clear that new paint had been applied on top of the original. I sent another text to the group: *All right, which of you jokers has been in my house?*

Denials all around.

Maybe it was a prank, I thought. Most of my close friends know where I keep my spare key.

But the painting kept changing.

The changes were so subtle I honestly didn’t notice at first. Even when I did, I assumed it was whoever had pranked me by buying the painting—that they were adding brushstrokes whenever we had get-togethers. It almost became “normal,” the way I’d see new additions, just a little at a time. We often joked about it, everyone wondering who the mystery artist was who kept adding details. (My friends would later tell me they all honestly thought it was me.)

But what really started to creep me out was when the changes to the painting made it… look like *me.*

One day I woke up and walked out to a creepy impressionistic portrait of myself and decided enough was enough. I took the painting off the wall, dragged it downstairs to the dumpster, and tossed it in. Good riddance!

But when I came home from work, it was back on its place on the wall.

I was beginning to question my sanity. I tossed it out *again.* But the next morning when I woke up, it was back on the wall. And… its lip was curled. Like it was *smiling.*

I had to go to work, and since I didn’t want to run down to the dumpster again, I just turned it around so it was facing the wall—at least that way it couldn’t watch me.

When I came home from work, I considered trying to throw it away one more time. Or burn it. But I was exhausted after a long day and since it was still facing the wall, its eyes no longer following me, I left it there and had dinner and spent the evening scrolling through images of exotic plants (my newest fixation). Decided I would deal with the creepy cursed thing in the morning. I did notice, though, as I was getting ready for bed, that it was crooked. I straightened it on the wall and went to bed.

In the middle of the night, I was woken by a loud *CRASH*.

When I rushed out to see what had caused it, I found that the painting had fallen from the wall. Its frame was cracked.

Frowning, I nudged it with my toe. Flipped it over. The canvas on the other side was torn… and empty.

*Completely* empty.

There was no figure in the painting.

And suddenly I had that feeling again so strong… that feeling of eyes…

I backed to the corner of the living room, scanning all corners of my apartment. The sofa. The table. The kitchen area across the open bar. The windows. Where were the eyes watching me from? Where? *Where??*

I was still standing there with my heart hammering like I was about to go into cardiac arrest, looking in disbelief at the broken painting and wondering what was going on when—*tum tum tum*—this patter of footsteps. And a *click.*

My bedroom door had just closed.

Immediately, I called the police to report an intruder. But while I was on the phone with the dispatcher, trying not to sound insane while I described the painting and the figure that was missing from it, suddenly it struck me that this might be one more part of the prank. That one of my friends, the one who might have been making alterations to the painting, could have snuck in to make some final adjustments. And maybe after they accidentally knocked the painting off the wall and caused the crash, they ran into my room to hide from me.

Not entirely plausible but then neither were the fears I was babbling to this 911 operator. She assured me they’d send someone out—I think she assumed I was high as a kite but also that it was better to be safe than sorry. Or maybe she just thought I needed a wellness check (I’d have thought so, too, after being on that call with me).

While waiting for their arrival, in case it *was* a prank, I steeled myself and went to the bedroom door. Then, just to be on the safe side, I grabbed a kitchen knife. A knife I swore I wouldn’t use unless I knew for sure it wasn’t one of my friends. And then I went back to the bedroom door, shoved it open, and brandished the knife while yelling.

Standing next to my bed was my reflection—

No. Not my reflection. But that’s what it looked like.

It was *me.*

But the hair was messier, like the brush strokes weren’t quite finished. And the clothes were not quite right, almost a strange mix of everything I wore all put together. Like the painter couldn’t decide on which outfit so went with them all. But the smile was sharp enough. As were the eyes. And the not-me looked at me and raised its hand.

In that hand, it held a painted version of my knife.

“Shit,” I gasped.

“Shit,” its lips imitated.

I don’t know which of us lunged first. Probably the painted me—real me was just standing there in shock. Next thing I knew, I felt the *thunk* of an impact in my stomach. And then… I don’t even know how to describe. The painted knife handle was sticking out of me, and where the blade entered the skin, paint flecked away instead of blood. Instinct kicked in, and I fought like a wildcat, slashing and stabbing, dragging my knife through that other me in a slicing motion, again and again. The other me opened its mouth in a scream, but all I heard was the ragged sound of canvas ripping. It made a final effort to cut through me, but then… my last slice tore it in two. It went limp, only a ragged piece of canvas.

I was bleeding from a deep gash in my belly. I believe I lost consciousness. Paramedics later told me they’d found me on the floor, bleeding from a knife wound. Draped over me was a canvas that I’d apparently cut free from the broken frame.

They made me get a psych eval. You see, there was no evidence of anyone else in my apartment. The authorities believed that I got angry at the painting, tore it apart, and somehow accidentally stabbed myself in my frenzy.

When I finally returned home, the painting, the broken frame and what was left of the canvas… were gone. Not a trace of them. Not a scrap.

And I’ve been wondering ever since… what would have happened if I hadn’t woken up? Was it going to kill me? Or was it going to, somehow… put me in the painting? And perhaps take my place?

I’ll never know. Because the painting is gone. GONE gone. From my life, at least. But here’s the thing. One of my friends sent me a link recently. Told me they stumbled across it on an art website.

The painting is back up on sale.

For the love of God, DO NOT [BUY.](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)
