I’ve only lived in Brighton, Michigan, for three weeks. It’s a quiet, middle-class town, plenty of small businesses, some newer developments, and the occasional “rust belt” decay that whispers about better decades long gone. I moved here because I needed a restart. After a messy breakup in Grand Rapids, I figured a smaller town might give me some peace.

But Brighton doesn’t feel peaceful. Not anymore.

On my first week here, I kept hearing about a place called Bon’s Burgers. Everyone my age (late 20s) shrugged when I asked about it, but the older locals either changed the subject or gave this look. You know the kind. Like you’d just brought up something you weren’t supposed to.

At first, I thought it was just a failed franchise. Maybe a McDonald’s knockoff that tanked in the 70s. But last weekend, I learned it was more than that. Way more.

I was walking down Cross Street when I saw it: a boarded-up building, tucked between an old bowling alley and a Dollar Tree. The faded paint on the wall read:

BON’S BURGERS “Come Join The Party!”

It creeped me out. A lot.

That night, I asked my neighbor, Jim (retired, Vietnam vet, drinks too much), what the deal was. He laughed at first. But then he leaned in close and muttered:

“You don’t want to know about Bunny Smiles Incorporated. Leave it alone, kid. That’s Brighton’s curse.”

Of course, I didn’t leave it alone.

A Google search pulled up almost nothing official. Just some old trademark filings. “Bunny Smiles Inc.” popped up alongside a subsidiary called Cyberfun Tech, listed as a “children’s entertainment & software company” in the 70s and early 80s.

That’s when I stumbled across a forgotten blog post archived from 2008. It mentioned someone being told by their father about “Bon’s Burgers” and everything they could remember. They said lots of stuff, like how it had some of the world’s first arcade machines, and how it had an early form of “animatronics”

The “mascot lineup” was listed as:

-Bon the Bunny (Blue, tall)

-Sha the Sheep (white, bleach, uncanny eyes)

-Boozoo the Ringmaster (Human, Gentleman-looking, uncanny mouth)

-Banny the (Second) Rabbit (Purple, tall, told it ‘starred too long’)

-Billy the Clown (Human, Basically what the title says, apparently actually friendly looking compared to the others)

But halfway through the blog post, the tone shifted. The writer claimed his father said employees went missing. The animatronic mascots acted weird. That Cyberfun Tech and Bunny Smiles covered it all up and tried to start again with tv shows and video games, but eventually disappeared in the early 80’s all together. Apparently the restaurant wasn’t even open a month.

The post ended with: “Don’t go near Saint Juan’s Forest. They never got rid of the mascots.”

Last night, I drove through Saint Juan’s Forest. There was a bunker deep in the forest that read “K-9 Storage Facility” and underneath in small writing, it also said “Copyright 1975, Bunny Smiles I.N.C”. The door to the thing was massive, like bunker levels of massive. Clearly made to keep something inside.

However, when I looked through the tiny peephole that was in the door, I saw something. It was one of the mascots. Bon I think.

Not moving. Just standing there in the floodlight glow.

A big, blue furred bunny with empty eyes.

I nearly tripped over a tree running back to my car.

I didn’t sleep last night. Around 3:15 AM, I heard scratching. Slow, deliberate, inside the walls of my rental home. I told myself it was mice, raccoons, something normal. Until I heard a voice say:

“Welcome to Brighton. Get comfortable.”

I confronted Jim this morning. I told him what I heard, what I saw. He didn’t even act surprised.

Instead, he poured me a whiskey. 9 AM, mind you, and said:

“Back in ’73, Bunny Smiles promised Brighton a future. Cyberfun Tech built those mascots with passion. But passion leads people down dark paths. Just please, stop looking before you really get hurt.”

I don’t know if I should stop looking. I’m tempted to just leave this all behind, but I feel I’m in too deep now.

The other day a thought popped into my mind. The owners. What if I could try and contact them? Could I get answers?

Im going to do research probably tomorrow. I’ll update when I have info.
