A couple miles outside Ashwaubenon, WI, there’s this dive called the Rutten Buck. Been there since before the bypass went in. The neon sign out front flickers like it’s had too much of its own stock, casting a sickly green glow over a parking lot buried in layer after layer of snow. No one shovels it anymore. Won’t till it thaws.

Inside, it’s warm enough. It’s the kind of bar that has Wheel of Fortune playing to kill the silence. It smells like spilled beer and deep-fryer ghosts. The regulars are already settled in folks drinkin’ to remember, folks drinkin’ to forget. Me? Tonight I’m drinkin’ for both.

“What’ll it be?” Hank, the bartender, asks voice like rust on a snowplow. He’s been slingin’ beers since I was nineteen, back when you just had to nod and promise not to be a jackass. A rite of passage round these parts.

“My usual,” I say. He’s already got the Busch Light cracked before I finish the word. “And the shake of the day,” I add. Just want somethin’ to pull my brain off the spin cycle. Feels like there’s been a weight hangin’ over me lately. Like God’s draggin’ his feet gettin’ to the good parts.

Dice rattle in the cup. I’m about to roll when the door bangs open behind me. Cold air punches through the bar, wiping out the smell of farts and those cursed pickled duck eggs someone keeps buying.

“They’ll let anyone in here,” Hank mutters, dry as road salt, sarcasm seeping through his words.

I glance back. It’s my brother, Keith: blaze-orange Carhartt zipped tight, snow dustin’ his beard like powdered sugar. Grease stains on his coat probably from a Kwik Trip burger or patchin’ up a sled again.

“What’s the DNR doin’ in here?” someone behind me slurs sounds like Marty, full of Old Fashioneds and freezer pizza. Doesn’t sound like a question. More like a warning.

“Drinking off my Friday,” Keith grunts, shouldering up to the bar. He snatches the dice cup right outta my hand like he’s owed it, rolls. “Ship. Captain. No crew,” he mutters, like it means something.

I set my beer down a little too hard. Foam spills over the lip.

“Alright,” I say. “Why you really here, Keith?”

He looks at me, and there’s something wrong behind his eyes like something’s taken root and won’t let go.

“We need to talk,” he says, voice low. “About last week.”

My gut tightens.

“When we went ice fishin’.”

The words hit like a walleye through the ice cold and sudden. Before I can respond, he clamps a hand around my wrist. It’s like grabbin’ rebar in January. He pulls me off the stool and toward the door.

We pass the slot machines on the way out bells ringin’, lights flashin’ but nobody looks up. Old-timers just keep feedin’ quarters in like it’s Sunday service.

“What the hell is this about?” I ask once we’re out in the lot. Cold hits like a slap, sharp enough to sting your teeth. “The deer? You’re DNR. You’ve probably seen a dozen this week alone. Why’s this one stickin’ to your ribs?”

Keith stops. Turns real slow. His breath clouds the air like smoke off the lake.

“Why? Because we didn’t do what Grandpa would’ve done?” I offer, tryin’ to break the tension. “Didn’t toss it in the truck bed and make pocket jerky? Big deal.” But he’s not laughin’. Not even blinkin’. His jaw’s locked up like he’s chewin’ on a secret.

And in that god-awful pause I realize I don’t wanna hear whatever’s comin’.

“I don’t think it died,” he says finally.

I stare at him. Snow crunches underfoot. The whole world feels like it’s holdin’ its breath.

“Keith…” I say, gentler now. “You need a break. Maybe a vacation. Something with palm trees. That deer was mangled, man. Skull split like firewood.”

He steps closer. Snow creaks under his boots. “There’s stuff out there,” he says, voice barely a whisper. “Stuff you ain’t supposed to see, Jude.”

He digs a cigarette from his coat, lights it with one of those tiny plastic lighters. Flame flickers, catches in his eyes.

“I thought you told Karen you quit.”

He exhales. Smoke curls like a warning. “I thought deer stayed dead.”

The words hang there thin, frozen, wrong.

The bar door creaks open behind us. Warmth spills out with the stink of old smoke and fryer grease.

It’s Hank. “Judas,” he calls. Voice like gravel in a coffee can. “Call came through. I told her you weren’t here.” He squints. “You… might wanna go to church.”

I snort, but it doesn’t sound right. Hank’s compass has always pointed weird, but he follows it like gospel.

“Put it on my tab,” I say, raising my bottle. I already owe him three-fifty. What’s another five?

He looks at me too long. Snow settling in his hair like ash. Then he turns and disappears inside. Door slams behind him, dull and final.

I turn toward my truck. “Tell Dad I said hey,” I call.

Keith doesn’t answer. Just stands there, smoke curling around his face like fog. I climb in. Shut the door. The thunk of it echoes in my chest.

Engine rumbles to life. Radio kicks on. Sabbath. “I’m goin’ off the rails on a crazy train…” I hum along, pulling onto the county road.

That’s when I see it.

A deer. Dead center of the road, staring like it knows me.

I yank the wheel. Tires scream. “Jeepers cripes!” I lurch out, boots crunching in the snow.

But there’s no deer. Just a puddle of black sludge and a metal tang in the air, like burnt wires and pennies.

I step closer.

Then I hear it. Snappin’ branches. A high-pitched, garbled screech. Not quite animal. Not quite anything. Like a deer with lungs full of water, a scream whistling into the dark.

“What the hell…”

I bolt back to the truck. Slam the door. This ain’t somethin’ that stays down.

And next time I see it? I’m not bringin’ dice. I’m bringin’ buckshot.

Snow howls around me. But whatever’s out there, it’s worse. So I do what I always do: grab the shotgun from behind the seat, climb on the roof like I’m settin’ up a deer stand on four wheels, and wait.

Wind bites hard. Nothin’ comes.

“Keith’s story just rattled me,” I tell myself. But my mouth tastes off, metal, rot, burnt plastic. I’d take cold fish fry casserole over this.

I shake my head, try to shrug it off. “I don’t think it died,” his voice echoes in my skull. “No,” I mutter. “It died. We saw it die.”

But my heart’s still thumping wild, louder than the wind. And deep down, I already know: some things come back. And some never leave at all.

My cellphone buzzes in the cupholder, snapping me out of whatever trance I’d slipped into. It’s Shaniqua.

I stare at the screen for a second, then pick up. “Yellow?” I say, trying for a joke, even if it falls flat.

“As much as we hate each other,” she says, clipped and businesslike, “your dumb greeting still makes me want to roll my eyes.”

Her voice no matter how sharp always had this weird way of calming me down. Even in the worst of it. Like something from a better season.

“I’m just callin’ to let you know…” she starts, tone shifting into gear, controlled, efficient. “My parents want to see Jackie and Heidi this weekend. I know it’s your weekend, but they’ve been asking for weeks now. They haven’t seen them since… what, four Christmases ago?”

She’s always been the one to remember the important stuff. The stuff that slips through my cracks.

“Yeah,” I say. “That’s fine. Just let me have Friday night with ’em, alright? I promised I’d take ’em to the movies. They’ve been on me about that one with the guy who works in a coal mine or whatever.”

There’s a small pause. Not cold. Just… quieter.

“Alright,” she says. “Thanks, Jude.”

“Tell the girls I love ’em.”

“I will.”

The line goes dead, and I’m left sitting in the hum of the heater, staring out into the dark. Snow still falling, thick and lazy, covering everything like dust over something long dead.

I take a long, growl-filled sigh, pinching my nose. Not because my ex’s parents wanna see the kids, but because I have no clue where my life is going. Keith, Lord love him, has me spooked about a deer we killed. This and the whole week of losin’ sleep and everything feels like it’s draggin’. I needed this weekend alone.

The truck kicks back into life with a growl. The shotgun slides back into the backseat as I head back home. Whatever is happenin’, I need to get through this. The drive home is quiet no music, no one on the roads, not even a deer.

I rush back to my house, lock the door behind me, and head straight to the bedroom. The shotgun stays close to me as I plug in the girls’ old nightlight and quickly draw the shades. I sit for a long time, staring out the window like the night sky itself might blink. I feel stupid, I'm too old to be spooked by bonfire stories. I shouldn’t be scared of the dark, shouldn’t be using a child’s nightlight. But tonight, that’s what I gotta do.

I don’t remember after that. I must have fallen asleep. I wake up some time later, groggy, the world mentally in a fog. “Where am I?” I ask myself. I find myself in another room, like I’ve been sleepwalking again.

Everything around me is the same, but it feels cold, not just to the touch, but the feel of the room itself has gone cold. I stumble into the kitchen, grabbing the coffee grinds. “This oughta do the trick,” I tell myself as the coffee machine starts brewing.

The air still feels cold as I wait for the coffee, pulling any food I can from the pantry to fix this fog in my body. The stale salty jerky is soft to the touch, spicy to the tongue it reminds me of my childhood. A wrestler used to be in ads for these things; his muscular body and gravely voice always caught my attention. I remember him saying, “crying doesn’t make me less of a man, yeah.”

He ain’t wrong, but part of me can’t cry, not right now. Not while I’m unsure what the hell is goin’ on. That tohing the thing from the road keeps cutting back to my mind. It looked like a deer, but that sound… no single deer could make that sound.

As I finish the jerky, I jump at a small footstep. “Jeepers cripes!” I almost hit my head on the ceiling at the sound. I turn around to see my daughter Heidibeautiful head full of raven black hair.

“Heidi, sweetheart, you scared me.”

She doesn’t respond at first. She’s always a bit moody, but now that she’s in her teen years she’s mastered the teenage silence.

“Heidi,” I call again. Her eyes,once filled with energy. They. They're almost blank, only confusion in them.

“Daddy,” she speaks, somberly. “There was a sound.”

“A sound?” My ears perk up. Was I so lost in thought I didn’t hear it?

“What kind of sound? You can tell Pop-Pop.” I force a weak smile. She frowns like explaining what she hears would gut her like a fish. “It sounded like a scream like a deer mixed with a mountain lion,” she whimpers. “But its insides were full of Auntie’s church casserole” she can’t find the words to describe her horror, so she uses something close to us.

I put a hand on her shoulder, gentle but steady. “I’ll take care of it, kiddo. I’ll find out what causes those sounds.”

She probably knows I’m lyin’. She probably knows I’ll go outside, look around, and come back. I give a shaky, stoic smile as I walk out.

The air is cold not like a usual Wisconsin winter something colder. My breath escapes my lips like my soul is leavin’ my body. As I walk down the patio, passin’ the long-since dead blueberry plant in the colander, the ground feels covered in small twigs each step rough and sharp.

“Jeepers cripes,” I growl under my breath when I step on the twigs again; it stings my foot.

That’s where I meet whatever was making the sounds the deer. It’s standing on two legs. Its antlers are sharp points, thick like tree branches stuck out of its skull, splitting it down the middle. A tire track runs to the right before the antlers. Its breath is… collected. I try to take a step closer, but I snap another twig.

“Sonova,” I whisper as it slowly turns its head. Its neck twists slowly, bones crackin’ as it does. Its eyes are void of anything I’d call life. It starts stepping toward me, and my stomach turns like its antlers are crankin’ my insides out.

The memories come back, when Keith was drivin’, cigarette in one hand, bottle of Busch in the other. We were both drinkin’ the whole weekend, so a little drunk driving wasn’t something we’d say no to, when the car hit the deer. We hop out, look at each other, then the deer. “That’s gotta be a four-pointer,” I slur.

Keith looks frantic, the deer’s head split open from the skull, blood poolin’ a bit. He’s panicked, full of anxiety and whiskey. Keith rushes to the car, with me in pursuit.

We looked at each other, swore a vow of silence, and sped off. We didn’t stop. Hoping we didn’t get caught. DNR won’t look too good if Keith got caught drunk drivin’ down the country road with a beer in his hand.

The memory slams into me like a deer in the headlights us checkin’ the rearview, a trail of deer blood following our car. “Shit!” Keith screams Busch light breathin’ out of him. “Fuck, we gotta get outta here!” He punches the car into gear as we speed down the road, hopin’ the cold winter snow will wash away the blood.

I blink, return to reality. The deer’s still there. It opens its mouth, but no words come out no mating call just a loud, ear-piercing “EEEEEEERERRERE” a sound loud and harsh, like barbed wire rip­pin’ through my ear.

My knees damn near buckle with fear, and for a moment I’m a boy again shiverin’ in a tree stand waitin’ for Dad to tell me it’s okay to climb down. My heart quickens by the second. That’s when it starts to step forward steam risin’ off its hide like fresh pavement.

“Back off,” I mumble. It tilts its head like a dog. Its jaw begins to unhinge itself, lettin’ out another cry. “EEEEEEERERRERE.”

“Back the hell off!” I shout. I can feel the night start to squeeze around me.

My fingers tighten on the trigger as panic takes over. Smoke curls around the barrel as round after round of buckshot fires into the beast.

As the smoke dissipates, the snow starts to fall again. The beast is gone no blood, no body, just tracks. The tracks ain’t deer tracks, nor human. I smile not ’cause I’m happy, but ’cause my daughters can sleep peacefully for the night.

Then a thought hits me “My daughters.” Panic spikes. The night feels like it’s holding tighter; every move like stepping through molasses.

The house feels colder than the snow outside the kind of cold that doesn’t leave when you kick the furnace up. My breath fogs out like a ghost. Heidi’s not in the kitchen. I bolt for her room, heart thumping hard enough to rattle my ribs. I ain’t prayed in years, but I find myself mutterin’ one now Not for me. For the girls. Because if that thing got inside, it ain’t just Heidi; it’s both of ’em.

I slam into the bedroom door, shoulder first. It groans but doesn’t give. “Girls!” I bark, voice breakin’. I hit it again wood splinterin’. Third try and it cracks open.

The room’s empty. Sheets half-pulled, the window gaping wide. Snow spills in like ash. On the floor, Heidi’s stuffed bear. I pick it up, fingers numb. “No… no, no, no.”

“HEIDI!!” I call through the house. The thought of that thing havin’ her eat­ing her makes my mind falter. I pull the sheets off the bed, hopin’ either girl is there. Pillow there. No Heidi. No Jackie. My throat locks up.

There’s a lump under the blanket on the bed. My chest caves as I pull it back. Just pillows. No girls. I check the closet dresses and school clothes sway in the cold breeze.

Then I hear it muffled, thin: “Daddy…”

I freeze. It’s comin’ from below.

The basement door’s cracked; light spills like swamp water down the steps. I take them two at a time, shotgun ready. Broken glass crunches under my boots old whiskey bottles I never tossed. Under the workbench, small slippers peek out Jackie’s.

She turns when I reach,her hazel eyes wide and wet. Heidi huddled beside her.

“Dad… is the bad man gone?” Jackie whispers. Her voice don’t sound right.

My knees damn near give. I kneel down, gather ’em both close. Their pajamas warm against me, the only heat in the room.

“What happened?” I ask.

Heidi just shakes her head, lips quiverin’. Jackie answers for her. “The bad man was lookin’ in our window. We ran down here when it screamed.” She points to the bottles on the floor. “Then it banged around the window,” she sniffles. Her finger points to my whisky bottles. “And your silly juice spilled.”

I hold ’em tighter. “Don’t matter. You did the right thing.” I force the most reassuring voice I got. “Are we safe?” Jackie asks, small.

I look down at cracked cement, the dim bulb swayin’ overhead, the smell of cold ash in the air. “Course we are,” I say, forcing a grin I don’t feel. “Daddy scared him off.” I flex my arm like I used to when they were barely able to walk and chew gum. They give a weak smile back. It’s enough.

Later, we crowd into my room the smallest one in the house. Walls cluttered with old photos, the dumb singin’ bass the girls bought me one Father’s Day. Heidi nods off first raven hair tangled across her face. Jackie fights it a little longer, then curls into my side.

“Sleep, princess,” I whisper. “Daddy’ll be right here.”

I lay there until the sun drags itself over the cornfields, its beams start to chase away the cold. It’s a slow warmth, like the first sip of coffee on a white-winter morning. Despite the energy spent, I can’t sleep. My mind’s plagued with the beast outside the girls’ window, the sound it made. More thoughts come to me. about Keith’s pale blue eyes, his panic, how he and I both saw this thing and neither knew what to do.

I sneak out of bed, Heidi and Jackie’s heads fall off my chest and onto the pillows, their tiny bodies make my bed look smaller. I grab my phone and call the one voice I didn’t think I would my ex. She’s the only safe person I got right now, and knowin’ she knows the girls are safe is enough.

She don’t answer straight to voicemail.

“Shaniqua, hey, so somethin’ came up. I won’t be in town for a few days.” I’m only half-lyin’. “Can you watch the girls a bit longer?” My voice is shaky. “Call me when you get ’em.”

Voicemail clicks. I feel exhausted, really unwell and spent. I think whatever that was it’s causin’ it.

The coffee pot bubbles as I prepare the girls’ school lunches. I write a note on each one: I love you. You’ll be stayin’ with Mom for a bit. As I step outside, the cold snow pelts me. My phone buzzes. Part of me hopes it’s Shaniqua, but in my heart I know who it is.

The image on my phone is Keith’s goofy full-mouth smile him with his old huntin’ dog in his arms like a baby. “Keith. Are you okay?” I answer.

“Jude,” he calls back, almost a hush. “You saw it, didn’t you?” Before I can answer, he keeps talkin’. I clutch my phone tight until my knuckles go white. “I think I think it’s mad at us,” he whimpers.

My mind flashes back to that damn night the car, the skid, the full thump, Keith sweatin’. Headlights wash the snowfall red. For a second I hear an animal cry. I shake myself awake. “Where are you?” I ask.

“Old town road. By Dad’s old huntin’ cabin,” he groans. There’s a loud growl in the phone, not Keith’s, not the dog’s something familiar and wrong.

I quickly grab a cup of coffee to go and lock the doors behind me. I know Shaniqua’ll kill me if I don’t have a sitter for the girls. Thankfully Mom ain’t got nothin’ but Wheel of Fortune tonight. “Ma. Hey. How’s Dad? Anyways Keith’s been bugging me about goin’ huntin’ with him. I can’t go without a sitter. Suppose you watch the girls till she comes? I’ll pay ya.” She says the girls are asleep and the keys are in the usual spot.

I don’t give Mom a second to respond; I kick the engine into life. Black Sabbath’s “Crazy Train” picks up again. As I speed down the road, I pass the usual spots Fleet Farm, Kwik Trip, Culver’s with the busted neon “ButterBurgers” sign but none of it feels real. Just landmarks in a dream I’m tryin’ to wake from.

County roads stretch on, empty. Snow spits sideways, headlights cut a narrow tunnel. The closer I get to the cabin, the more the woods lean in pines bend low, branches scrap at the glass like they’re tryin’ to pull me off the road. Dad’s old cabin sits at the end of a two-track trail, roof sagging under years of snow and silence. My tires crunch to a stop.

I grab the shotgun, step into the cold. It hits sharper here. Deader. My breath fogs out thick, clingin’ to my beard.
