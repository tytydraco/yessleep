This all started when I was in Clare on holidays. My family have a small cottage in rural Clare in the middle of nowhere. We have no neighbors at all and civilisation is about a twelve minute drive away. It's been my favourite place since I was around 3 and being 17 now it's still the place I spend my summers.

In 2019, I was playing on a small swing set that we have in the corner of the garden. For reference, we have about 4 acres of land here, and what surrounds the land is fields belonged to farmers that are decelate. There's a derelict abandoned house across the road from our tiny cottage, there's a few more small abandoned cottages every few minutes drive down and up the road, and a holy well a seven minute drive away. The swing set was at the top right corner of the acres, our house is situated in the middle of the plot, so, from the swing set, part of the road is covered by the house, if that makes sense. 

I was swinging when I saw someone in blue walk by. This person did not just walk on the road, no, they were in our land, inside the small white wall we had up, and walked until the house covered them. Now, this house is a family house, so cousins running around and random appearances were the norm, but this looked different. The only think I saw of this person was their blue clothes. A strange blue, like a semi-vibrant blue, not light but not dark. I knew for a fact my cousin that was staying with us hadn't anything of the sort. But still I ran and told my mother and we searched, nobody there.

My father worked late, still does, so couldn't make it with us. That was normal and we were usually in the house alone, my mother, my twin sister, me and my older cousin. It definitely freaked us all out, but life moved on. We never really went to the cottage after that, everything got busy and work piled up. So why am I bringing this up now?

Well, I'm in Spain right now, on holidays for the first time in years. I was walking through the old town in marbella when we got a bit side tracked. We were lost. So we started to head up random directions and alleyways, hoping we'd find our rented car. When we passed a man muttering to himself. Now I live in Ireland, So it's Very easy to tell when someone is on drugs. And I assumed this man was, so I was going to avoid eye contact with him. As I do to not start an accidental fight in Ireland. However as he got closer, I realised something. That blue. That strange, semi vibrant fucking blue. He wore this long loose cloth. Like I don't know how to explain it but you know the Preists wear them? That. Once he got close, like breath smelling close, I broke my rule that I made to myself. I looked. His eyes were fully roller back in his head. His dark completion wasn't illuminated in the street lamp. His mouth was drooped, like someone who had had a seizure. I don't know what he was mutterings, but I did Spanish in school and it didn't sound like spanish.

Now I genuinely hope this wasn't a man struggling with some condition or something but I genuinely couldn't sleep last night over that. My hotel room has shutters on it, and I swear through the cracks I could see him standing there. I hope, if he is someone with mental health conditions or some kind of other conditions that he gets the help he needs. But oh my god he terrified me. And the worst part? Nobody else who passed him even gave him a second glance?? I don't know, it was so off putting and his appearance will haunt me forever
