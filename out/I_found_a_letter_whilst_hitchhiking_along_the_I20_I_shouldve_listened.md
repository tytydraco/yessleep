\-The following is a transcript from my smart audio recorder-

**\[Start of audio recording\]**

*The date is Tuesday 1st of May 2023 and the time is currently 9:24pm, I have set this device to automatically upload these recordings to the internet in case I am unable to.*

*My room is cold and I can hear the wind howling against the decrepit walls of the motel, the air smells old. As if no one has set foot in this room in years. I am here because of my love for anything unexplainable and I found the note I previously mentioned. Nothing of interest has happened as of yet.*

*I found it hard to settle in, it feels like someone is watching me but I’m the only one around, the receptionist had told me that it was only me staying. No one has passed through for days. I went for a shower earlier but decided against it. The walls are green with moss and the shower head is filthy, I don’t even want to know what has been in that tub before me…*

*I’m starting to believe that the note I found was just a practical joke.* **\*sigh\*** *The time is currently 10:27pm and it’s been nothing but silence as of yet, I’m going to re-read the Pamphlet aloud to see if that triggers anything off.*

*Thank you for choosing the Ridgeway Motel, this pamphlet contains all you need to know about us!*

*First off, we have a set of rules that we would like you to keep under any circumstance.*

***Rule set***

*1)* *Please keep your room as you found it, we value cleanliness at Ridgeway.*

*2)* *If you are to have any issue with your room, please contact reception.*

*3)* *When you enter your room, if you see anyone who shouldn’t be there, do not alert them and leave immediately and contact reception.*

*4)* *Please keep all windows and doors locked at all times, otherwise we cannot ensure your safety*

*5)* *If you hear tapping on the windows between 00:00 and 00:32 please go under your sheets and stay silent as to not alert it to your presence, when the tapping stops you’re safe.*

*6)* *If you hear children laughing past 22:00 ensure your doors and windows are locked, even if you have just done so, they like to play tricks on the guests.*

*7)* *If your lights begin to flicker, contact reception and stay silent, they will understand.*

*8)* *When using the bathroom past 23:00 do not flush, it will upset the children.*

*9)* *When you are about to go to sleep, turn all lights off and do not turn them back on.*

*10)* *If you hear someone in your room, run, it doesn’t matter where you go just do not enter that room again. Reception will provide you with a new room and your luggage will be available to collect from reception at 08:00*

*Any further problems please contact staff at \[Redacted\]*

*Enjoy your stay,*

*Ridgeway Motel*

*After reading them out nothing happened. Great…*

**\*Heavy breathing\***

*I think there’s something here… I’m not sure if the silence is driving me crazy but I swear I heard something small run up and down the stairs outside my room, giggling. I had my window open to try and air the room out but I can’t get rid of that dam smell.*

*Almost forgot, the time is currently 10:54pm. I’m starting to believe that something more is going on here.*

**\*silence\***

*My doors been unlocked... I swore I had locked it?* **\*Clank\*** *Ok it should be locked now. The time is 11:26pm. Other than the footsteps nothing else more has hap-. Huh? Old lights, I guess.*

**\[End of audio recording\]**

**\[Start of audio recording\]**

*What the fuck was that? The time is 11:32pm. Something has just crashed outside, well I think it was a crash, it was loud enough to be one. I’ve looked outside but saw nothing. Anyway. Tonight, has been odd to say the least. I don’t know what this place is but something is seriously wrong. I tried to call reception about the noise but my phone isn’t working, that’s great isn’t it. So, a rundown of what’s happened so far:*

*There has been a constant feeling that there’s someone or something watching me that I can’t seem to shake no matter what I do and it’s starting to bug me,*

*Someone can’t control their children or something because I keep hearing them laughing and running about. If that isn’t irritating, I don’t know what is,*

*The rooms falling apart and the lights barely work,*

*Then finally there was that crash, I tried to see if anything happened but it was like whatever had happened was gone by the time I went to check.*

*That’s all for now*

**\[End of audio recording\]**

**\[Start of audio recording\]**

*The time is 12:14am.*

*Still nothing has happened. I’m tired, fed up and ready to go to sleep. This motel fucking reeks and I just can’t be bothered anymore. I apologise for the language but its necessary to get my point across. This place is so depressing, anything I do is a-* **\*tap… tap… tap…\***

**\[Start of audio recording\]**

**\*whispering\***

*Ok I think it’s gone, the one rule that stuck in my head:*

***“If you hear tapping on the windows between 00:00 and 00:32 please go under your sheets and stay silent as to not alert it to your presence, when the tapping stops you’re safe.”***

*Whatever it was it’s gone now, I haven’t heard anything for a few minutes. Its 12:32am. That thing just didn’t want to leave.*

*I’m going to bed. Turning everything off and putting this into my pocket, goodnight.*

**\*Rustling and panting\***

**\*Silence for 4min 32sec\***

*Somthings in that room, or was, it saw me leave. I- I don’t know where it is now or where I am. I ran into the tree line to try and get away but I think it followed me* ***\*Leafs crunch\****
