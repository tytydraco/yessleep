\[Part 1 of 2\]

It was a cold winters night when I arrived,

I had booked out a room at a motel somewhere off of the I-59 as I was getting tired on my trip to Atlanta to visit some family. I had drove about 300 miles before I had my first proper rest and I thought I had gotten lucky booking the motel as it was so cheap for a last minute check in, I soon discovered how wrong I was.

Upon my arrival the receptionist looked at me like I wasn’t human and handed my key and a note after a brief conversation. I headed towards my room looking at the motel and it looked as if it hadn’t been renovated in years: The walls where decaying, windows smashed and gutters full of leaves. The smell was almost unbearable but what can you expect for such a cheap place?

After a few minutes’ walk I had found my room and I put the key in only to find it unlocked. I cautiously opened up the mossy door and called out *“Anyone in here?”* No response. I took a step in and screamed like a little girl when I saw someone sleeping in my bed, I stepped back outside and looked at the note in my hands and this is just a brief summary of what it read:

**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

After reading the pamphlet I brushed it off as a joke but I did contact them about the person in my room and they told me it was safe to go back in now. *“You haven’t even been here yet?!”* I exclaimed, but they ignored me and told me once again *“Its safe to enter your room now sir.”*

I opened my door and to my surprise there was nobody there. I walked in and looked around just to be safe then set my suitcase on the floor and went for a well-deserved, all be it grimy, shower.

Once I had finished with my shower I put on some pyjamas and got myself ready for bed, I checked my phone 21:43. I locked my door and windows and walked over to my bed, the floorboards creaking with every step, and placed the rules on my bedside table along with my phone and slowly drifted off to sleep.

I got about a good 30 minutes of sleep before I was woken up by the sound of faint giggling coming from all around me and I grabbed my phone for some light. It turned on… 22:39. I remembered the rules and read them quickly, *Rule 6)* *If you hear children laughing past 22:00 ensure your doors and windows are locked, even if you have just done so, they like to play tricks on the guests.*

I felt my heart skip a beat, *“What if the rules are true”* I said to myself, voice shaking. I had always been one for the supernatural but I wasn’t a strong believer in it. I thought I’d humour myself and check my door. Unlocked. *“Maybe it’s just a faulty lock?”* I said to myself after re-locking it, not wanting to believe the rules where real and not just some joke. I walked to the windows and checked each lock. They where the same, unlocked. “*I swore I had locked them before”* I thought. I re-locked them and got back into bed, finding myself unable to sleep.

I sat there for maybe an hour and thirty minutes just scrolling social media when the tapping begun. Remembering the rule that stuck out most I got under my sheets, turned my phone off and sat there in silence until the tapping slowly subsided. When I thought it had stopped, I took a peak from under the covers trying to not be caught when I saw a unnaturally large figure walking away from my window, its arms bent in ways that shouldn’t be possible when all of a sudden it stopped and arched backwards and stared at me with an ear to ear grin and then left.

I sat there in silence for what felt like years and drifted off to sleep. I somehow managed to sleep through the rest of the night and was woken up by the cold breeze entering my room. My doors and windows where wide open.

I’m writing this not to scare you, but to warn you. Something followed me from that motel and it’s after me. I don’t know how long I have left but stay away from **The Ridgew** \-the writing trails off here, I found this letter laying on the side of a road leading off the I-20, I’m going to see if this is real, I’m typing this from room 23 at The Ridgeway motel. I’ll give you an update tomorrow.

Goodnight.
