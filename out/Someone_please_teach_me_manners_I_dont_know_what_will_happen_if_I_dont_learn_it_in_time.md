 I stood there for quite some time. Pressing my back against the wall, shifting my position yet never finding an ideal spot. It wasn’t comfortable, I had to wrestle the urge to go away. The toothy cold gnawed at my face and fingertips. I expected some chill, but not this. My arm grew weary while holding my phone, which I felt getting heavier by the second. I now understood why the place had gained a haunted reputation. That gas station wasn’t in the best conditions, faded painting in most parts, from the floor to the canopy. Some light bulbs were weaker and dirtier than others, gathering flies stuck in cobwebs, about to meet their hairy, many-eyed, wall walking, eight-legged demise. The view mirrored an old grey photo, all color having retreated under the indifferent grasp of night. The fact that I noticed this proves that I was bored of waiting. Still no signs of the supposed blood stained tire marks that would appear where a person got ran over here a decade ago. I wasn’t there for that, of course, it had always struck me as a made up story with no regards to believability.



 I took the unusual opportunity to go through horror stories put in my ever-expanding read later list. It worked, to great effect. The reckless solitary stay under the dark sky made me feel tense, helpless. The previous boredom dismembered as I read about supernatural monsters and gruesome murders. It was exciting, it brought me to the edge, and you should definitely not do it. Despite being skeptical of the more mystic elements, it reminded me that people are just as horrifying. No criminals went out at night on that town, as something worse takes their place instead, that’s the saying. I was there to learn why. Yet my doubts grew bigger. I consider myself good in putting apart fiction from reality. But something felt different, hazier, dreamlike. I was failing to calm down my fearful side with rational thinking. In a burst of caution, I looked around. The only sources of light being the gas station and copy-pasted streetlights besides the road in front. A single shade of darkness covered everything else. I was ready to go inside the main building, but the humming of an approaching car made me stop.

  
 The last thing you want to do is to run away. I retold these words to myself. If the story was true then the best thing to do is wait. Sounds of the engine got closer, coming from down the road. A faint white fog started to build up close to the ground. The humid air made breathing a laborious task, I felt the cold droplets build on my face. The car sounded more threatening than ever, and the urge to run assaulted my mind. I felt the string of muscles in my legs tense up, ready to work, the act of standing in place instead felt suicidal. I looked at the road, but I saw no signs of the car whose noise spread over the whole place. It was empty despite the feeling that the noise was coming from right in front of me. As I noticed more aspects of the supernatural, an unexplainable wave of drowsiness struck me. The cold hard wall on my back now feeling like an inviting mattress as I closed my eyes. The sound of the car being overridden by noiseless sleep.

 

 When my eyes opened, I saw a hearse parked on the road in front of me. It was covered in black paint and it had a metallic reflection. It was clean and polished. I could feel the aroma of an old car with my eyesight, even if I was too far to smell it. I saw the silhouette of a woman through the side window, she was sitting in the back of the car and looking forwards. The figure’s outline sharply defined, contrasting the glow of the streetlights. She remained deathly still, like a portrait behind the glass. Seconds later, the door on the driver’s seat started to open. Slowly, the way it moved evidenced it’s heavy weight. I heard strained hinges. I don’t know if the sound was actually real of part of my imagination, given how far I was from the car. When the door opened, the urge to run overwhelmed me, yet I didn’t move. However, this time my stillness wasn’t a product of a rational mind, but instead of an indescribable sense of doom that paralyzed my very soul.

 

 A figure stepped out of the driver’s seat. It had a pale skull, which rested on top of a set of long bones, each bone lodged inside each holes on the lower part of the cranium, giving it support. Sets of cloaks, belts and garments that resembled a rich man from a century ago covered the rest of his body. His clothes, grey and black, stretched from his shoulders to the ground, in a confusing array of layers. The fog from earlier thickened, covering the floor as the figure started to move in my direction. He approached me at a constant pace, without any of the fluctuations of speed and body movements of someone on two legs. Instead, he moved like he was sliding on ice. He kept his head high as his posture mimicked royalty. I pressed my feet hard against the ground and started running. Or at least I thought I did, but despite feeling the strain on my flesh, my body remained still. My legs chose to stay in place and my eyes decided to lock on the one who was approaching me. Darkness coated every object in my view as he walked past it. As far as my vision was concerned, everything behind him ceased to exist.

 

 After an agonizing amount of time, he finally reached me. Bringing an ashy smell with him.

 

 “Hello there, friend… Care to hear a story?”



 Surprise slapped me in the face, I took time to process that he was talking to me. The gravely, deep voice carried casual words were delivered with power. The sudden shift in tension stunned me. The dark smoke behind him dissipated and I felt the control of my muscles returning. Yet I remained alarmed, with a shaking feeling inside my chest. I could hear impatient demand from the few words he uttered. Feeling like I was on a timer, I gave him a quick and thoughtless answer as I tried to step away.

 

 “I-I am sorry sir… But I’d rather not… I’m waiting for someone and-“

 

 His unearthly appearance and overwhelming aura mutilated my chances to speak with calm and confidence. I showed out hesitation and fear as I tried to come up with a dismissive excuse. He caught this then moved closer. The void eye sockets kept staring at me as he grumbled with authority.

 

 “I am trying to have a nice talk with you and I am not a fan of being denied, kid. A talk with me is more fruitful than whatever pointless thing you are doing. Show your manners and hear what I have to say!”

 

 His tone was now more threatening and aggressive, ripping through the silent night with hostility. Seeing the danger in the situation, I stopped in place. I then looked at the ground, foggy enough to conceal my feet. I used the break in eye contact to think better of a way to salvage the situation.

 

 “Of course! I… I would love to hear what you have to say! J-Just go on, I’m all ears…”

 

 My words were nervous. My mind raced in anticipation to his answer as I conjured a shaky smile. I tried to back away from him, but a wall behind me blocked my movements. I felt the cold pierce through my clothes and cause shivers on my skin.

 

 “Your fake enthusiasm does not fool me, boy.”

 

 He spoke with a patronizing sting. Then he let the words sink in for a second before continuing.

 

 “I will let this one pass, but I will not tolerate any further disrespect.”

 

 In contrast to mine, his words were firm and decisive. He cleared his non-existent throat then spoke again.

 

 “You see, an immense tragedy has struck my family some time ago. My lovely sister, killed by a terrible, terrible illness! We could only watch as she spat her bones out, one by one!”

 

 He exclaimed in an over the top fashion, his bony jaw opening wide as he did so. Something under his shoulders, beneath his cloak, moved to add to the drama. This made me doubt how much the event affected him, or if it was even real to begin with. Feeling the need to answer, I came up with some awkward words.

 

 “I see… Well I-“

 

 The figure interrupted me before I could finish my sentence.

 

 “She was indeed a very caring and kind person. It is very saddening to see something like this happen… Is it not?”

 

 I felt pressured to show empathy to his troubles. Inside, his words failed to move me. I never lost someone close, neither did I know how to react to it. While I pondered, a sound of approaching steps on wet dirt, then on hard ground, surprised my ears. I lifted my head to look around, doing this reminded of the macabre appearance of the person in front of me. My mind forgot about the sound and stumbled over a more pressing matter, answering before he got angry again. Still, I was indifferent to the death of someone unknown, no matter how much I tried to make it seem otherwise. Any semblance of compassion crushed under my fear of him.

 

 “I-It must’ve been hard for you... I guess it happens…”

 

 Electricity fills the air the moment I stop talking. The figure moves closer, invading my personal space before scoffing his words out.

 

 “It happens? How can you give such a heartless and cruel answer? My sister died and that is all you have to say?”

 

 I’m taken aback, not expecting this kind of reaction. Pointy bones start piercing his clothes from inside and popping out. The sense of having made a mistake grew in my chest.

 

 “I-I’m sorry… I didn’t mean it like that!”

 

 He lunged forward but stopped just as quick. In reflex, I jumped back, hitting my head against the wall in a painful thud. A sudden awareness of how fast my heart was beating struck me.

 

 “Enough! It seems that no one has ever taught you proper manners!”

 I could taste his threats. The ashy stench coming out of him almost made me choke. I felt his cold breath settling down in my exposed neck, like a dirtying smoke. I got paralyzed, and the only thing I could move were my eyeballs. Staring back at the old worn page yellowish skull. Noticing a crack that went from the bump of his nose to half an inch under his left eye socket, which seemed to be growing. We both glared at each other. The only thing breaking the silence were my own uneasy breaths.

 

 His stillness confused and frightened me. I expected him to move and rip me apart at any moment, yet it wasn’t happening. He stood there, like a creepy murder toy watching a paranoid child. After the shock dissipated a bit, I managed to look away from him. Only to set my sights on something just as terrifying.

 

 On the building’s corner, from where the earlier step sounds came, there was a man-shaped shadow. Entirely black and looking at me while also not moving an inch. I averted my eyes again, only to notice other two similar figures. One behind a column, underneath a light bulb but still just as somber. The other behind a bush, right in front of the forest. Lastly, my gaze went back to the car, the hearse which the figure stepped out of. The woman-like silhouette had turned and now looked at me. The newfound awareness of the unexpected audience heightened the sense of dread. Every one of them had the eerie ability to emanate sheer judgment, despite not moving or saying anything. It felt like they were able to read my thoughts thoroughly, coming out with the worst possible conclusions about me. A swarm of possible next actions infested my mind. But it felt like every single one was being unanimously disapproved of before they even came to be.

 

 Time seemed to have stopped around me. Even the wind showed no signs of movement. As my mind wandered, a sharp, booming voice slashed through the fearful peace.

 

 “Don’t you know it’s rude to focus on other things while talking to someone?”

 

 I looked back at the imposing figure in front of me. I felt his anger buzzing in the air. In a sudden movement, his skull started to morph like dough. Acquiring stretched, surreal shapes. Sometimes becoming a bony ball. Sometimes filled with trios of small holes that vaguely resembled screaming faces. I heard more livid words, but the voice didn’t seem to come from him anymore, but from my own eardrums instead.

 

 I could only watch as the figure moved closer. His skull finally settled in the shape of an elongated horse skull, an inch from touching my nose. In a moment, the wind turned warm and started hitting against my face. Stopping for a second then grazing on my skin again. In and out, in the same rhythm of a person breathing. The voice no longer came from him, the calm and calculative nature of a doctor replacing the previous anger. I felt everything around me dissolving into a lightless abyss. Telling me to focus on the thing in front of me.

  
 “Allow me to teach you something. The best way to get someone like you back in line is through fear. Fear will make you think twice before speaking. Fear will help you stay quiet when you should. Fear will teach you respect towards those over you. It is quick, effective and long lasting.”

 

 I saw something rustling underneath his robes, moving around on his midsection.

 

 “And I know the exact way to put this fear into you. Do not worry, this is for your own good…”

 

 From the midst of his robes poked out a bone of a finger, and after it, a hundred more. Some short and chubby, some long and thin, nearly touching the floor. A whole fan of mismatched skeletal scraps opened. Each bone pressing and merging with another. Each pointy finger bursting out of the agglomerate like leafless branches from the trunk of a tree. As he raised his hand, each part of it seemed autonomous and disharmonic. Crushing and snapping each other in half as a buzz of dry crackling reached my ears.

 

 Before I noticed it, a few larger fingers were already holding me in place. I used my full strength break free, but to no result. Not a budge. My efforts weren’t even enough to get his annoyance.

 

 “It will be over soon.”

 

 As he spoke, a whip-like finger slithered out of the mess and started moving closer. I couldn’t contain the shortness on my breath as I saw it aim for my next, behaving like it had a life of it’s own. When the spiky tip methodically started piercing my skin, I felt a sharp pain on my chest and lost control over my muscles. He didn’t let me fall to the ground, and instead kept me in place. I was reduced to what my sensitive nerves could feel, the blurred mess my startled eyes could see and the wordless thoughts my dizzy brain could make.

 

 “The satisfaction of showing someone their place is like no other... Squirm more for me!”

 

 Instead of the expected pain, I felt my flesh opening up by itself instead. It read his intentions and obeyed by allowing passage. I could feel the soft bone entering my neck, slowly, pushing my flesh and blood vessels apart like a surgeon on duty. Wriggling deeper and deeper inside like a worm burrowing through dirt. My focus was on the bone chilling sensation of my throat pressing against his bony finger every time I gasped on instinct. The agonizing sensation similar to having something stuck on my throat took over me. My body tried to fight by coughing, shaking, sweating, aching, anything to make it stop. Make it stop!

 

 In a final display of precision. He wrapped his finger around my spinal cord and gently, oh so gently, pressed down on my nerves. At this point, my organs took over. Reacting in a botched soup of liquid emotions, gut-muddying cravings and autonomous moves. Each trying to escape in their own incomprehensible way. Revoking my mind’s control over them.

 

 Despite this, the figure remained a statue. His inability to have facial expressions doing little to stop the satisfaction coming from his words.

 

 “I sincerely hope that you have learned your lesson now. We will meet again. I expect more from you then.”

 

 With that, he pressed his finger a tad harder on my nerves. My body shut down completely in response. I could only see the inners of my eyelids as I got unconscious. My body hitting hard but numbly against the ground.

 

 It has been a few hours since this has happened. I barely remember the way back home. Only a few quick lapses of memory. Of the empty street and my confusion towards the sudden disappearance of the things I saw.

 

 When I arrived, I had trouble finding the way around my own place because of a terrible headache. On top of that, the repulsive feeling of having something lodged on my throat still haunts me. I’m having trouble to breathe. Whenever I try to eat or drink something, a tingling sensation accompanied by an urge to vomit overwhelms me. Earlier, while in front of a mirror, I noticed a grey spot on my neck, pulsating at its own rhythm. Nothing I did could take it off, scratching, cleaning or poking it. I even got the urge to grab a sharp knife and cut it off, regardless of the implied risks, but for now, I’m able to hold myself back.

 

 Right now, I’m in front of my computer, more collected than before. All my doors and windows are locked. I’m acting like a paranoid lunatic. I’m not even sure if I’m writing this down or if I’m already asleep, having a cruel dream. I heard his threats of seeing me again and I will not take them lightly. I’m going to share this story around the internet in hopes that someone will find it and help me with this. I’m scared. I don’t know if I’ll be able to survive the fated next encounter. So please, help me. I know that I can’t do much in return, but I want to live. Tell me what I did wrong, what I should do now. Anything that can help. I’ll stay awake through the night. I’m counting on you.

 

 Update: I need to write this fast. He’s here! The hearse is here! In front of my house. How did he know? I’m scared of what might happen if I don’t answer. No more editing, I’m posting the story right now. I’m going downstairs to greet him. I’ll try to read any messages hat come. I hope I don’t mess this up. Wish me luck…
