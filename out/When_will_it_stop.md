I know none of you will believe me, but for a moment, JUST for a moment tell me what i could do to get out of this hell.

Several months ago, my wife and i planned a big trip, to a dream destination. Honestly it was such an imporant trip that we had been worked up about it and stressed to say the least. Everything was in order, the tickets, the luggage, the hotel, the spots we would visit, our ride, and the food. 

There was no way it couldve gone wrong... we checked everything so many times. 5 days ago we boarded our train with excitement and curiosity. We got into our seats and put our luggage where needed, now we could just sit back, and soon we'd be at the place of our dreams.

Then, we went into a tunnel, things got dark for a little while but obviously i wasnt scared or anything.. we went back into the open tracks and the sky was visible again. I looked to my side, my wife had fallen asleep although she was awake just before we went inside the tunnel. 

"Whatever.. shes a sleepy girl afterall" I said, and brushed it off. Then i heard it "Honey, look! We are already at the station right before ours!"

I was taken aback, not only was she sleeping and even if she had woken up, she wouldnt sound so energetic and cheerful, but we had boarded the train just 30 minutes ago. "Maybe.. maybe i fell asleep for awhile and never noticed when we arrived.." i murmured to myself then turned to my wife and smiled at her excitement.

Then, in a flash she fell asleep. It wasnt her slowly closing her eyes and drifting off, it was a flash. One second her eyes are gleaming and the next they're closed and shes sound asleep.

"What the fuck? Sweetheart wake up this isn't funny, how the fuck did you do that??"

She woke up confused, she looked so annoyed and her eyes barely forced open "What..? what did i do?" her words dragged as she fell back asleep. Now i started feeling.. uneasy. I tried to play it off as motion sickness but i was definitely uncomfortable and weirded out by what was going on.

Then i saw it, when i turned to the window and looked out I saw our station, finally we arrived! I turned around to wake my wife, when i noticed the passengers were way too quiet, like they didnt know it was time to get off the train. Up until now, it was uneasiness, but true panic settled when i felt the train jerk and continue on.

"What.." i couldn't even fathom the situation. My wife woke up "Whats wrong baby..?" she moved around in her seat trying to comfort me. "We arrived at our station but the train is still going?" i said confused and starting to feel a little insane.

All i heard as a response was a mere laugh, or a giggle. I turned around to look at my wife, the hand she placed on my shoulder to comfort me was wrapped around her torso, her mouth agape as she was asleep with no sign of waking up soon. "Yea no.. you're fucking with me right Claire?"

No response.

Its been like this for.. 2 days. The train is supposed to go on for only 8 hours. The trains just been going on and on, my wife has been asleep for 2 days and she is alive but doesn't wake up no matter what i try to do. Im starting to go insane. If anyone can, PLEASE help.
