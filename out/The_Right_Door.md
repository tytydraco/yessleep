Think it's time I finally write this weight off my shoulders seeing that my third "friend" has finally passed. I wouldn't be who I am now if it wasn't for them. That is if I knew them at all. Couldn't tell you if the time I spent with them was a dream, or some other worldly hand pushing me in the right direction. There's no reason why I should have known how things would have ended for any of them.

I grew up in the city. Middle class I guess. My parents kind of just let me do my own thing with minimum boundaries. Throw skateboarding in the mix and I became that kid. The kid that could quickly lose his way without guidance, or even just a good group of friends.

Didn't take long to make friends at the skatepark. Granted most were older than I was. It was just nice to be acknowledged other than at school. I was eleven when I met those three. Jake was the youngest until I came around. I think he was sixteen when we met. He was really into cars, and was the one that drove everyone around.

Ant was a bit older. I knew he had dropped out of highschool, but that's about it. Other than that if you were looking to get fucked up he was your guy. Nate was the oldest and boy he had a temper. He gave me my first beer the day he introduced himself after beating the crap out of some dude trying to get one over on me.

They seemed like a good group of guys taking me under their wing. I learned so much from them. So fucking much. Went from hanging with them after school to Nate signing me out as my uncle so we can go skate the city.

I was living the dream. Just getting fucked up and skating all day without a care in the world. Shoplift what we wanted. Snatched money from the non-regulars at the park so we can go get beers. Not like they would say anything because Nate would just beat them senseless.

I felt like it was the way things should and would be forever. I was thirteen when my foreseeable future changed for the better. One night in particular. We were on a drunk excursion at three in the morning tagging up the city.

We weren't any good at it. Just being a bunch of misfits fucking up anything within reach. We stopped by one of the schools in the area to steal a bench for the skatepark when we noticed a trailer in the parking lot. It wasn't a book fair RV or anything, but the one that gets hauled by a rig.

It was dusty as hell with the phrase, "Choose the Right Door," written like a gameshow on each side. The four of us walked around it, but the trailer had no door whatsoever. Like, what is the point of a trailer that you can't put stuff in?

Nate was the first to notice the hatch propped open on top. I knew what he was going to say as soon as I seen that stupid look on his face. "Yo Flapjack, get up there and see what's inside," he said with a crooked grin. They called me Flapjack because I looked like some damn cartoon, but that's besides the point.

They basically threw me on top of the trailer before I could get a word in. I popped the hatch open looking inside. It was a lot bigger than the outside. Should have taken it as a sign, but I wouldn't be who I am today if I did.

The inside looked like a white room with a black house door on the side of the trailer where the truck would hook up to haul the trailer. I yelled back at them, "come check this shit out." Nate helped Jake and Ant up, then we all pulled Nate up last since he was the heaviest.

I was told to go in first since I was, "the smallest," which was bullshit. Being the youngest too didn't give me much of a fight either. I climbed in and it seemed even bigger when you got inside. It was like standing in a seamless white hallway with only the black door on one side.

One by one they dropped in behind me. We were all pretty blown away because we never saw anything like it. That's when Ant said something along the lines of, "Uhhhh guys. The window thing is gone." 

Ant was always on another level, so we all kind of blew him off still looking around the trailer. At least until Jake looked up saying, "he ain't lying. Shit's gone." In our defense the guy slurred even when he was sober.

Shit only continued to get weirder. After that Nate pointed out a red door that appeared on the other end of the trailer asking. "Has that door been there the whole time?" We all started to freak out seeing that everything was changing around us. We didn't know what to think since there was no way in or out on the outside of the trailer.

Ant pulled out a blunt right then and there. We sat in the middle of the trailer passing it around trying to get our heads straight as logical as that may seem. We figured we'd hotbox the thing until we heard someone come around to let us out.

That's when Jake pointed out the signs above each door like we missed them or something. We were all stoned and tired, but if anyone was seeing shit it would have been Ant. The sign above the black door said, "WHAT IS LEFT OF THE FUN," and above the red door said, "RIGHT WHERE YOU SHOULD BE."

First thing to come to mind was that Ant had a little bit more than just weed in what we were passing around. Wouldn't be the first time, so I got ready to pull Nate off after he got his piece. That never happened though. Nate was actually the first to approach a door. The black one to be exact.

The three of us just sat there and watched while he looked it up and down. I mean it was a door. There's only so much to see. We laughed wondering what he was looking for, then immediately got quiet when he turned the doorknob.

Nate opened the door, and to our surprise it led outside. Not outside the trailer though. We could see the park on the other side of town. Ant dropped the blunt saying, "I swear I didn't put anything in this shit." We believed him.

We all got up to check it out. Next thing I knew I heard Nate chuckle as I felt two hands push against my back. I staggered through the door yelling, "Yo, what the fuck?" It surprised us all when my voice deepened after I passed through. I turned around to cuss out Nate, but the looks on their faces threw me off.

I asked them, "What the fuck are you guys looking at?" Ant was the first one to speak up after a few seconds of them just staring at me with their mouths wide open. "Uhhhh, bro. You're likeâ€¦.older." I looked down at my hands to see there was a noticeable difference.

We weren't sure what to make of it. It was late so it wasn't like I was able to ask someone passing by if they could see what I was seeing. The door I came out of was one of the houses we tagged up earlier that night, but the wall wasn't tagged up anymore. Plus the park was even a little different.

I watched Nate, Jake and Ant walk through the door one by one to finally see what they were freaking out about. They were all older by a good five years or so. The catch was that whenever we tried to explain what each other looked like we couldn't hear what they were saying. We even tried to look in windows and mirrors, but we were faceless in our own eyes like a dream.

We really didn't know what to think of it since VR wasn't a thing yet. That's when Nate said, "It's probably one of those Japanese game shows or something. You know what that means right?" The rest of us looked at each other having no idea what he was talking about. He smiled showing a couple missing teeth saying, "Means there's a winner."

I wasn't too sure what we would win, or if there was a game at all. The other two seemed just as confused as myself as we watched him walk across the street to the park. Didn't take long for Jake to point out a sports car that was technically from the future. "Check that shit out!"

It was a candy red newer mustang if I could remember correctly. Jake geeked over the car for a few minutes while Nate checked the driver door to see if it was unlocked, and it opened right up. A smile stretched across Jake's face as he told us, "get in. I know how to win."

We all jumped in with Nate in the passenger's seat. Jake hotwired the car until the engine roared with his laughter. He threw it into first, and we were off. We blew past a cop after jumping on the freeway going an easy 120 mph. We all laughed with red and blue lights flashing behind us.

We made it quite a way with the sirens blaring behind us. It started raining heavily, making Jake start to swerve. Ant looked like he was going to shit himself while Nate was yelling at Jake trying to grab the wheel. It got bad enough to the point where Jake was fighting Nate from grabbing the wheel.

He was screaming at Nate, "I fucking got it!" Ant started having a panic attack while all I could do was hold on the handle above the door hoping for the best. There were no other cars on the road, but you can only go straight for so long.

We blasted through the guardrail flying down the embankment. The car flipped end over end tossing Jake out the window until it came to a stop with us trapped inside. I could feel my right arm and ribs were broken. Nate's face was leaking everywhere after being smashed into the dashboard, and Ant couldn't hold his head up so I'm pretty sure his neck was broken.

I've never been in so much pain in my life. My body was radiating with pain as everything started to go black. It felt like I was squeezing my eyes shut. I honestly thought I died until I opened them to see I was back in the trailer with Nate and Ant. We were all still groaning like we were in pain, but nothing hurt anymore.

Everyone got up confused with not a scratch on them, and we looked normal again. Everyone except for Jake who was nowhere to be seen. That's when Nate blurted out. "Looks like Jake lost. You guys ready for round two?"

Ant and I looked at each other surprised he would even want to go back through the door. Then again, it was Nate. He got up, opened the door and walked right through without looking back into what looked like a party. Ant and I ran after him through the door that aged us more than the last time. No one even noticed us since it looked like we walked in through a bathroom door.

Seven, or ten years maybe. I felt the years hit me all at once. The drugs, drinking and that car accident was showing on Ant. He looked like dog shit and could barely move his neck. I could even feel the stiffness in my arm.

I brought up my arm to see a massive scar from my wrist all the way up the back of my arm. Made me cringe thinking back on the car accident that happened no more than ten minutes ago. Took me a second to remember I was at a party, but by that time Ant and Nate were gone. Never seen older people party before at the time. Don't know why it'd be any different.

Same people doing the same doing the same shit just like they did every other weekend. I couldn't tell if I was that fucked up or if I was just that old. Nate was still trying to get the chick that was being given the most attention while Ant went on a bender as usual.

Walked around the party for no more than five minutes when I heard people screaming at someone, "that isn't coke!" I immediately thought of Ant. I ran towards the yelling to see Nate screaming at everyone around him. He was a mess at this point. A weathered man standing over his friend who was overdosing on something they never heard of on the ground in front of him.

He was blaming them for giving Ant something that was cut, but they kept trying to tell him that they warned him. I ran over to calm everything down by putting a hand on Nate's shoulder. He didn't recognize me though. All I saw was his fist, then it all went black again. Just to wake up in that trailer once again except for it was only Nate and me this time.

Nate was still in the midst of swinging with tears running down his face when I got up. He laughed it off saying, "That shit felt real as fuck! This just leaves you and me bro." All I could think about how stupid that sounded while he ran back through the black door. I couldn't let him go alone though.

I went through that door for the third time and felt worse than ever. I felt much older than last time, but at the same time I didn't. Not to mention I could feel the dirt caked on my body like I haven't bathed in weeks. I looked over at Nate and he probably looked how I felt. Like a fucking bum.

We walked out of a massage parlor that was close to the skatepark. Didn't take too long for me to realize the liquor store next door was now a smoke shop. Nate nudged me with his elbow showing me a pistol in his jacket. I looked at him and he just gave me a crusty ass, toothless grin telling me, "let's go."

I was honestly scared to argue with him. Wasn't too sure what happened to us after we died, so I just followed along. We walked in and the guy behind the counter looked familiar. He obviously knew who we were because he was already sketched out when we walked in.

Nate made his way around the store pretending to look at stuff behind the glass as I stood back by the door. I could feel the tension in the air. I could also see the shopkeeper with his hand under the register. Nate had said a few words, but I couldn't hear him.

My heart started racing when I saw Nate reaching into his jacket pocket. It was like he didn't give a fuck what happened to anyone. I looked down at my old shaky hands, then felt my chest thinking I was going to have a heart attack. That's when my hand fell on a tucked away pistol of my own.

I reached into my jacket pulling it out to see if it was real. The pistol caught the shopkeeper's attention, then there was a bang. The top half of Nate's splattered on the ceiling as his body fell limp to the floor. I turned around running out the shop before he could get another shot off.

My feet tripped over themselves as I staggered out the door. Another shot rang out shattering the glass, and leaving a burning feeling in the back of my leg. I dove into a bush thinking it would give me some sort of cover only to face planted on the trailer floor. All by myself between those two doors.

I sat there for hours with my busted ass nose. No one came. Not even a peep outside. I was scared to go through the black door again, so I went through the red door instead. Only choice I really had.

I opened the door to see nothing but darkness. Something told me it was the better of the choices. I stepped through, and just like that I was standing in the parking lot all by myself without a trailer in sight.

Didn't know what else to do except run home and never look back. The sun rose just like any other day. Made my way to the skatepark later in the afternoon to see if Nate and the guys were waiting for me. They were there, but things were far from the same.

We were no more than just a couple guys that hung out at the skatepark. They still called me by that stupid nickname, but everyone did that hung out there. Weird thing is that everyone just went with it as if I wasn't just following them around just the other day.

Over the years each one of their deaths has made the news or was posted on social media. Each one just as heartbreaking as the other seeing that I considered them all friends before we found that trailer. That isn't why I write this though. This is just a reminder that sometimes it's best to choose your own path. It could save your life.
