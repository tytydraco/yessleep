Kyle and I are high school sweethearts. We moved to Illinois so he could attend university, and he offered for me to move in with him. It was a big step — I had to leave my friends, my family, everything I knew. But home was with him. I loved him. I was willing to do anything for him. It’s been three years. He landed a high-paying job straight after graduation, and my nail business finally took off — thanks to his help. We were doing well. Our relationship seemed healthy.

Until three months ago.

It started small. Hickeys on my neck and jaw, like usual. But then they spread — to my thighs, my arms, my stomach. Deep purple and green bruises bloomed under my skin like rotting fruit. In August — the hottest time of year — I couldn’t wear shorts. Couldn’t show my skin at all. I was constantly hiding myself under turtlenecks and long sleeves, like I was ashamed. But I said nothing. Hickeys were normal, weren’t they? That’s what I told myself. But in late September, after he came home excited about a promotion, things changed. During sex, the usual bruising began. He sucked hard on my thigh, my neck, my collarbone — but then he gripped my shoulders and sank his teeth into me. Not playfully. Not teasingly. He bit me. Hard. Sharp. I screamed and shoved him off. My collarbone was bleeding. I touched the wound and felt it — the punctures, the sting. And when I looked at him… his eyes weren’t the same. They were pitch black. No shine. No soul. Just hunger.

“That hurt, Kyle. What the hell?” I snapped. “Enough is enough. I don’t want you biting me or leaving hickeys anymore.”

He stared at me blankly. Then, flatly, “If you don’t give it to me, I’ll just get it from another girl.”

My stomach dropped. I should’ve left. I know that now. A man who loves you doesn’t say that. Doesn’t threaten you. But the thought of being alone in a city I didn’t know — with nothing, no one — terrified me. My business was tied to him. My life was built around him. Without Kyle, who was I? “Okay… I’m sorry,” I whispered. “You can do whatever you want. Just… try not to make it hurt so much.”

So I let him win. And for three more weeks, I lived like that — hiding my bruises, holding in my screams. But he didn’t care anymore. The bites got worse. Deeper. He growled when he did it. Made animal noises. He didn’t even touch me sexually anymore — he just bit and bit until he was satisfied. One night, I needed a tetanus shot. I convinced him I was at risk of infection, that if I got sick, he wouldn’t be able to bite me again. That was the only reason he agreed to take me to the hospital. He couldn’t let his prey go bad. That’s when I stopped loving him. When I realized I wasn’t a girlfriend anymore. I was food. And he… he wasn’t Kyle anymore. As the needle pierced my arm, the nurse asked how I got the wound. Kyle looked at me with those black, empty eyes. I swallowed hard. “My niece bites,” I lied. She didn’t believe me. But she dropped it. 

It’s mid-October now. I don’t love Kyle. I know that. But the thought of leaving still claws at me. I don’t know who I am outside of him. I don’t know how to be free. But today, I couldn’t think about that. He had another big interview. I had to make dinner. I cooked mashed potatoes. Steak — extra raw. His favorite. I was in the kitchen when I felt it — not the floor creaking, not footsteps — just presence. The air thickened. Shifted. Like the house held its breath. I turned, and he was there. Standing in the corner. Watching me.

“Oh, Kyle,” I laughed nervously. “You scared me. I didn’t hear you come in.”

He didn’t answer. I felt him behind me, close. Breathing against my neck, slow and heavy. He didn’t speak. Just stood there. Inhaling. Rejoicing. Then, his lips brushed my ear. Gentle. A kiss. A lie. I knew what was coming.

"New spot," he whispered. "Let’s see how tender you really are."

Then he bit. My ear — the back of it. Not a nibble. Not a playful nip. A rip. A piece of flesh torn from my head like wet paper. I screamed. Blood ran hot down my neck. I clutched my face, dizzy from pain. I turned to look. I had to. And there he was. Smiling. He was looking directly into my eyes, just…chewing. “God,” he moaned, licking his lips, “you taste like metal, honey… and just a hint of earwax.” He smiled, teeth red. A chunk of my flesh was stuck in between his teeth. I didn’t say a word. Blood soaked through my shirt. My body trembled. But inside, I was still. Solid. Today was the day. I was going to escape. I didn’t care what it took.

He could keep the ear.

But he wouldn’t keep me.

The next morning, he left for work. I didn’t waste a second. I booked the first flight to Utah. I packed everything. Erased myself from this house. Disconnected my location. Blocked him on everything. I was nearly done when the pounding started. Not once. Not twice. Constant. Fists slamming against the door again and again. My blood ran cold. Kyle? No — it was too early. He was three hours into his shift. And he had a key. I crept to the peephole.

A man in all black stood there. Face covered. A black mask. Still. Silent.

“What do you want?” I whispered.

Nothing. No reply. I blinked. Looked again.

Gone. I breathed in relief, but fear still sat like a weight on my chest. What if he was still out there? Hiding? Watching? I grabbed something from the drawer — small, metallic. I was saving it. Just in case. I didn’t know what would happen today, but in my gut, I knew something terrible was going to happen to me. I packed the last of my things, shoved cash into my bag, and zipped my suitcase. Peeked out the window. The coast looked clear. It was now or never. I dropped my suitcase. Climbed out. Feet hit the grass. I was free. I started walking — fast — rounding the house toward the sidewalk. I turned for one last look at the house. The last time I’ll ever see it again. I’m free…finally.

I turned back and something caught the croner of my eyes—there he was. Standing in the bushes. Dressed in black. No face. Just… waiting. My suitcase hit the ground.  I ran as fast as I could.  If I could just make it to the roundabout — the sidewalk — there would be people. Neighbors. Witnesses. I hated Kyle for getting a house far from the city. Hidden away from civilization. His footsteps thundered behind me. He was faster. Closer. I'm not going to make it! I have to yell for help. Before I could scream, he slammed me to the ground, his hands pressed against my mouth, silencing me. His weight crushed me. I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe. Then, slowly, he pulled off the mask, and my world shattered. 

It was Kyle. Those dark eyes. Gone was the man I once loved — all that was left was this stranger with those haunting dark eyes. He bashed my head against the pavement.

Again.

And again.

And again.

Blood pooled behind my skull. My limbs went cold. My vision flickered.

“I knew it,” he snarled over and over like a madman. “I knew it.”

He paused. Stared at something behind me. Then, he bent forward and licked the ground. Slurping up the blood like it was spilled wine. That’s when I moved. Twitching. Quietly. I slipped the small cylinder from my pocket. Uncapped it with one hand.

Pressed it to my lips.

Swallowed.

He didn’t notice.

My world went black.

The last thing I heard was the growl in his throat.

And the soft, wet sound of him nibbling at the back of my skull.

***BREAKING NEWS – Illinois Cannibal Case Shocks Community***

***Chicago, IL*** *– Authorities have uncovered a disturbing murder case in suburban Illinois, where a young woman was found dead in her home under suspicious circumstances. The victim, identified as a woman in her mid-twenties, was reported missing just 48 hours prior to the discovery of her remains.*

*Police were called to the apartment of her long-term boyfriend, Kyle Dickens, 27, after neighbors reported a foul odor and strange noises. Upon entering the residence, officers found body parts—believed to belong to the victim—stored inside the refrigerator and freezer compartments. Forensic teams later confirmed the remains included sections of her ear, chest, and thigh.*

*In a shocking twist, Kyle Dickens was found deceased at the scene.*

*“He was discovered in the living room, collapsed near the refrigerator,” said Detective Harold Bishop, lead investigator on the case. “There were no signs of a struggle.”*

*The official cause of death, according to the toxicology report, is poisoning. What kind of poison has yet to be disclosed, but sources close to the investigation have stated that it does not appear to have been self-administered in the traditional sense.*

*“It's unusual,” said one forensic analyst. “There was no note. No ingestion containers. And based on how quickly the substance worked, it doesn’t align with typical suicide profiles. It's almost like… the poison was already inside him.”*
