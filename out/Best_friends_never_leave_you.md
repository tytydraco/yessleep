 

Every single night, for the last two months. Alison would wake up at around 3:00 AM to find the same thing. Her best friend and roommate Melia staring at her from the foot of the bed. Her eyes were always black and soulless and her face frozen in fear. The only movement Melia would make is an occasional slight sway from left to right and then from right to left again.

Alison and Melia had decided to move in together about a year ago,  this was big a step for them as neither had ever lived alone before, but Alison wanted independence and Melia was running from something. 

After weeks of searching they found a small single story home at the edge of town, shrouded by tree's and framed by the mountains behind them. However It wasn't perfect and needed a lot of work, with one of the bigger issues being that the roof was completely exposed in most parts of the home, but they agreed to work on it. Melia insisted they move in as soon as possible, knowing her friends situation Alison reluctantly but excitedly agreed with her.

Unfortunately Everything would start to go downhill on their first night there. As Alison collapsed into bed, exhausted from the nightmare of moving furniture and emptying boxes, another nightmare awaited her. 

In her deep sleep she felt claustrophobic, like she was both emotionally and physically trapped in a situation she didn't want to be. While her body felt free, drifting from right to left in the bed, her head stayed in one place. Almost as if it was unable to move and attached to a rope. She felt a headache and fading feeling envelope her from the outside to the inside and even a shortness of breath.

When she awoke the next morning the nightmare continued. Malia's demeanor had almost immediately changed, she was emotional and became distant from her, claiming to hear creaking coming from the ceiling of the living room. However there was no roof, just a beam running across, with the bottom of the roof tiles completely exposed.

For anyone else this would be strange behavior, but Alison knew that Malia was trying to escape an abusive boyfriend and chalked it down to her being paranoid. She decided to give her space. However she found that in the next few months, the only time they would see each other was when they worked on the house together. However late at night she would hear her talk to someone.

They both worked to fix the problems with their new home and in a few months the inside of the roof was completely done. Now it was a ceiling with a number of small lights shining down on them, giving the sense of a calm and serene setting. Unfortunately the sound of gasping and heavy breathing never stopped never stopped coming from the roof tiles above them.

Malia distance from Alison only grew and Alison honestly never asked why. While they lived in the same home, they couldn't have been further apart. This of course hurt Alison as she had thought that her and her best friend would only get closer living together.

Two weeks before Malia's death Alison had gone to see the real estate agent alone. The house was completely paid off and she had decided to finally get the papers onto their name, However with the papers also came the history of the home. Which dropped tumblers in Alison's mind, giving her a stark realization.

The family who had lived their before them had all died inside it. Murdered by the Mother. For some reason or the other she had poisoned her husband, son and daughters food, before stringing them up from a beam in the lounge. 

All at once, the signs had come together. Unfortunately even though she made the trip from the real estate office to her home in less than a few minutes. She was still too late to save her. Alison found her best friend hanging from the rafters in their newly renovated living room.

For the next two weeks Melia lay in a state of induced coma in the hospital, with only machines keeping her Alive. During that time Alison had done more research into the history of home. While it couldn't be proven, it was believed that their was some form of abuse going on, and that the lady who poisoned her entire family had had enough of it.

On the night that she took her family's lives, neighbors had called for a wellness check on the home, as they sensed that something was off. They found the family hanging from the rafters, however when taking the life of her youngest child the mother had done something terribly wrong. Wanting to show mercy on her youngest child she hung him but didn't drop him from a height like the others. 

This meant that the child hadn't died instantly, but instead slowly suffocated. Emergency services had found the child brain dead with his body still gasping for air. Unfortunately that sound never stopped in the home, even when they tore out the roof, even when Alison and Malia rebuilt it.

When Melia eventually flat lined in the hospital, Alison wasn't surprised. She went to the funeral, barely showed emotion and than went home. She felt intense guilt for not reaching out to her friend in her time of need but She knew her friend would never leave her, just like the family never left, so the first thing she did when she got back home was move all of her things into Melias room.

Now Alison wakes up every single night at around 3:00 AM to find her best friend staring at her from the foot of the bed. Her eyes always black and soulless and her face frozen in fear. The only movement Melia would make is an occasional slight sway from left to right and then from right to left again. As she hung from the ceiling.
