My first encounter, I was super young, we were currently living in an apartment in Orlando, FL. I was maybe 3 or 4, and I just remember looking into one of those large, bulky tvs and seeing rows of what looked like dead people, in this TV which was turned off. In that same house, as odd as it sounds, I was laying down in my parents bed and remember seeing an evil looking shadow of what looked like Crash Bandicoot. My next encounter, I think I was 5 or 6, in Miami, FL at my step dad's house. My family and his always said that the house was haunted, and I guess they were right. They'd mention hearing dishes being moved and things like that, but no one ever saw that face. No one but me.

The first time I saw it, it was only a shadow figure. The way the room.was set up, next to the door frame, was a mirror and across from that mirror was my bunk bed. All of a sudden, the bed started shaking as if a grown man was trying to destroy it. I happened to look in that mirror, and on that top bunk, was this shadow figure that looked as demonic as somethinf can. The most prominent feature were the horns... they curled almost all the way to its back. I covered myself with pillows in hopes to mask or forget about what was going on right above me. To this day, I sleep with at least 10 pillows on my bed..

In that same house, my mom said she'd see a shadow figure walk to our door ways and make some sort of symbol on our doors or doorways... why she didn't say anything to anybody is absolutely beyond me, the crazy woman. 

In that same house, I was climbing a pantry. The top of this pantry, there was a space between the top most shelf and the door frame, probably around 2 or so... when I reached the top, this face popped out at me. A purely white face, almost like a ceramic mask, with eyes that I can only describe as void of light. It came within inches of my face, and I dropped. This was the first time I saw its face, the first time it introduced itself to me. Since that moment, I have never been able to comfortably open a closet without the fear of seeing it. 

Fast forward, I'm more probably 7-9 years old, playing with some legos in a bath. The bathroom had an exhaust fan in the center of the ceiling. As I was chilling in the tub, I recall looking up at it, this exhaust fan, and thinking, "hmmm, that looks kind of like a face" but I was young, so I just told my self it was the fan moving so fast, it just looked still... then, my older brother Justin walked in and then the eyes on this face moved with a speed that I still can not put into words, snapping on to him and following him through out the bathroom. I told Justin, he can not leave that bathroom without me. The face was purely white, with those black, empty eyes. That's when I recognized it. 

I didn't see it for years, but I was terrified to be alone. Next time, I was a sophomore in Highschool, probably like 15 or 16. I lived in the basement of our current house in New Tazewell, TN. It was only me, my younger sister, and my mother in the house at this point. I had a friend who'd come over every now and then to hang out. The way the basement was laid out, my bed was close to this open room that my mom used as her closet, and on the other side of the room was the bottom entrance of the basement. So, when you come In through the basement, you turn to the right and you see the open closet, my bed, and the stairs that lead to the top floor. My friend came over one day, and as I let him in, he starts freaking out. This kid was a very "hard" kinda person, who wouldn't show this type of reaction to most things. So, naturally, I'm trying to figure out what he's freaking out at.... he tells me he saw a white face with black eyes peeking out from that close. Honestly, I didn't like the guy too much, so I hadn't told him about ANY of my experiences. When he told me that, I moved upstairs and that fear was reignited. 
I never saw the face again, but I felt it. 

Then, at 24 yrs old, I was laying in bed with my now ex wife, back to back. She started screaming at me to stop poking her face... I never felt so cold, because I was practically asleep at this point and wasn't anywhere close to touching her face. She quickly realized and backed up to me even more. 

Up until my senior year in Highschool, I thought I was just schizophrenic. It wasn't until I spoke to Justin, my older brother, that I realized, this was as real as real gets. As I told him what happened on that bunk bed, he started crying, hard. I had only seen him cry maybe once or twice, because he made himself to be this macho man. So I ask him why he was crying, and he told me that the same exact thing happened to him, years prior, in that house in Orlando, on the same exact bunk bed. That told me that it wasn't my step dad's house, nor was I crazy. 

There are more things that happened to my siblings and family. For example, in a house we resided at in Warner Robin's, GA, my little sister dreamed of my little brother being stuck in the bathroom of the house, unable to get out, while these green glowing eyes were staring at him from the mirror. When she woke, Keanu, my little brother, was in the bathroom claiming to have seen green glowing eyes. In this same house, Analyz would randomly wander the house, sleepwalking, almost in a trance. My older sister, Melissa, and her wife Lyenne caught Analyz walking around one night and they say that they saw an orb fly past as they saw Analyz in her trance like state. 

I think it was started because my mom and her older sister, my Tia, played with a ouija board when they were really young. They claimed the bed floated and my grandparents, soon after, threw it out. They never said bye. 

I've tried researching this demon, I've gone out ghost hunting in hopes for more info, I've listened to all of your podcast, and nothing. I really wish I knew why it followed me, but it did, and it did not show itself to any one else in my family, but me. This is the closest I could find that looks like it. Just imagine it without a nose or mouth, and the eyes were rounded and empty.
