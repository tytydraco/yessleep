You awaken from a deep sleep and find yourself in the back rooms. No need to panic, simply scale a wall, and punch a ceiling tile until it gives way. 

Now you are in an abandoned school, its light is minimum, but familiar to you. No one is present but you can smell the food wafting in the cafeteria. 

Go there, and eat the pizza, drink the milk, there should be some supplies and you will need to load up on them. 

You don’t know how long this journey will last, so be sure to get as many snack packs and water bottles as possible. 

Put them in a backpack conveniently located in the cafeteria, there are many so you will have your pick, choose wisely however, and pick the biggest one.

 Next door is the nurse’s station, so grab a first aid kit or two. Oh, and use the bathroom. 

When you are ready, go to the exit in the back, set your sights on the next destination, an abandoned bookstore, it’s not far, but run. You don’t want anything to spot you.

 When you arrive stop and take a couple of breaths. By now you are probably full of pizza and will need the extra time to get it together, so close off the entrance. 

Once you are ready, find an exposed place in the ceiling, get up on a chair, and climb through.

You are now in the street, a dangerous place to be in but now for normal reasons. But it’s ok as there’s a bus coming, get on the bus.

 No one will be inside, but it will still drive all the same. It will drive for a long time but don’t fall asleep. Bad things happen when you miss this next stop, trust me. 

It will stop at your next destination and you must get out then. 

This time it will be a mall, set up camp there for the night. By now it’s been days and you’ve only realized when you notice your provisions are low, and your stomach is growling.

 Again despite no one being there, food will be plentiful. 

Take the food and find a new vessel for your provisions. Preferably something much, much bigger. 

Eat as much as you can before finding the store with snacks and water bottles. You never want to run out of water. 

Now there will be some stores to avoid, these are ones guarded by one of them that have been stalking you. Do not go in: 


The “old” bookstore
Carson’s Kandies( the food is expired anyway) 


The first bed store you see(there are three) 
And the movie theater playing Nickelodeon’s old shows (it’s a trap) 

After you finish eating and gather your supplies, go into the third bed store on the second floor, and go to sleep.

 You won’t feel like it at first, but as soon as your head hits the pillow you will be out. However, make sure to secure the front entrance, just in case. 

You will awaken at exactly 3:33am, and you must get up, find a ceiling tile, puncture it, and climb through with your survival pack and nothing else. 

You should be close to your destination, only you will be able to tell. Here are some quick ground rules for this moment: 

Traps to avoid: 
Familiar voices 
Any place “too” nostalgic 
Any smells “too” nostalgic

Sights to ignore: 
Giant lizards walking near you
Clowns, especially giant clowns coming up to you, dolls with the ability to talk and walk, 

Your next stop is a toy store, and it is one of the most dangerous parts of this journey.

 Do not wait around nor even stop a minute. Search the nearest exposed piece of ceiling and get through it. 

K mart is next, again, avoid nostalgic places, it is a trap meant to lure you into a false sense of security and safety. Get out of there fast. 

Finally you will find yourself in your childhood home. It will look exactly as it did when you were a kid. But no one will be home. 

Go in the front, make yourself some Mac and cheese, hot dogs, and a glass of chocolate milk. When it is ready go into your living room, sit in the floor and turn on the tv. 

Nick toons will be on, eat it and watch the tv, ignore all around you aside from those few things in front of you. 

When you are finished eating a bowl of ice cream will appear next to you. 

Don’t question, just eat it. When you are tired, and you will suddenly feel immensely tired, get up, turn off the tv, find your old room, and go to sleepin your bed. 

If you’ve done everything right you will wake up in your bedroom. In your current house and everything will be as it was. 

Good job, you’ve survived the night high on shrooms. Don’t worry about any damage, you were just sitting there the whole time.
