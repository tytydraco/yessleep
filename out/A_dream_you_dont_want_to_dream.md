The morning light streams into the room with wisps of cool air and I'm already awake. I'm staring at the ceiling fan lazily going round in circles almost defiant to do its job. The clock next to my bed reflects it's face in my bathroom mirror across the way-4:27am. This is the fifth night now that I've had this dream. The fifth night where I can't seem to wake myself up no matter how much I yell and scream at myself. I'm so tired but I've got to get up and go study so I drag myself out of bed and get ready for the day. I get on my bike and started riding towards the library while allowing my mind to go over the dreams again. 

It always starts the same- I look down at my hands and find the friendship bracelet I made with my mom. I'm in a small rectangular room with an equally small window in the top right corner of the room. On the opposite side there is a large blue door with a golden handle that doesn't seem to move. There are seven other people in this tiny room with me and we are all equally anxious. A few of the people are trying to climb the flat walls wanting so desperately to just touch the ceiling and have it crack open and let everyone go. Some people were staring sadly around watching those clawing at the walls and the rest stared dead on toward the door just waiting for something to happen. I'm standing in the middle of the room watching all of this going around me in a slow motion without any air in my lungs to carry words out of my mouth to this group. I turn to stare at the window in the corner of the room and start floating towards it, some of the taller people had lifted me towards it with the idea that maybe I could fit through it if it opens. As I got closer to the window so did these loud footsteps towards the door, almost in sync with my proximity to the window. The handle that never seems to turn starts to click to the left as the window clicked to the right, both opened at the same time. I squeezed through the windows opening just as I felt the hands lifting me up fall away like dying flowers on a frosty night. I turned to find everyone in the room had been blasted away to bits along with only a set of evil eyes and shiny yellow teeth facing me. The evil eyes and yellow teeth seemed to crawl closer to me and then



It's 4:27am again. I'm staring at the ceiling fan spin around and around with each blade chasing the other.


I get the library and no one seems to be around aside from the librarian. I find my corner and drop my things to claim the table as my own. Going up and down the isles I grab various articles, papers, and books to diversify my search. After what seemed like hours I found a newspaper that had been rolled up at the bottom of a pile marked "1999." When I brought it back to my table something had slipped out. I stood there, shocked, looking at the top of the table as if waiting for an explanation from the books around me. It was the bracelet my mother and I had made together when I was just five years old. I was sure I lost it but couldn't remember how or when. I looked around almost desperately wanting someone to yell "GOTCHA" in a half assed attempt to scare me. Parts of the bracelet were brown where white string used to be, and parts of it seemed to have broken away. My eyes skitted to the page that let go of the bracelet and locked in to the story titled "1999 April 27th: EIGHT CHILDREN KIDNAPPED IN THE NIGHT- SEVEN FOUND MURDERED IN LOCAL BASEMENT." My eyes started to well up with tears as they met the faces of each of the children in the photos on the page. Four boys and three girls were pictured on the page- three boys were older with ages ranging from 14 to 17 and one boy was only 7. Two girls were both 10 and last was just 3. These were the faces I had met in my dream, the faces that saved me from those evil eyes and yellow teeth. I couldn't breath I, it's just a dream I told myself. It's just a dream. 

"Its just a dream." 

My shock melted into terror as I turned around to see the librarian staring back at me. He imitated my quivering words with a sharp edge to his own.

"Its just a dream." 

His eyes rose away from the somber and tired look while his mouth began to curl and shine yellow. 

"It's just a dream." 

He started to almost float towards me as I stood frozen to the spot. 



It's 4:27am...I am staring up at the ceiling fan in my room standing still, no light peaking through my windows. My calander says it's April 27th. I have an old newspaper rolled up on my nightstand waiting to be opened.
