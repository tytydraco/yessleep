 This is becoming a serious problem.

 

We've tried everything! Ant bait, bug spray, bug bombs. Nothing seems to get rid of them permanently. They just keep coming back in droves. It's infuriating!

 

But I'm starting to think this isn't a normal ant infestation.

 

I don't want to get too into my tragic backstory, but let's say I fell on hard times. Like, evicted-from-my-apartment hard. To keep the long story short, I've battled with addiction for most of my life. It got really bad when I lost my job. I ended up not being able to afford my place anymore.

 

I didn't want to be homeless, naturally, so I thought of places I could stay. My relationship with my dad was rocky, to put it lightly. He wasn't the best dad in the world to start with, but apparently, he only changed after Mum died. I hardly remember a time before that, personally. I didn't want to put up with his shit every day, and I highly doubt he wanted to see me again after all this time, so the only other alternative I could think of was to live with my sister.

 

Shiloh and I had never been close when we were young. She was nearly a decade older than me, so by the time she could afford to live by herself, she pissed off to live halfway across the state. By the time I was in high school, we barely saw each other. I was half-expecting her to say no when I asked, but she said I was family and I could count on her when things got tough. So, I counted my blessings and expressed my deep gratitude for letting me stay with her.

 

"It's no problem. Between the divorce and the flood, you're just lucky I got myself sorted so quickly," she told me. "Oh, by the way. I'm currently going through an ant infestation. You'll mostly see them in the kitchen and bathrooms. Sorry about that, I'm trying the best I can to get rid of them. It'll be a while, though."

 

"Uh, no worries," I replied. "I can handle a few ants. Better than sleeping on the streets. Bigger fish to fry and all."

 

At least, that's what I thought at first.

 

I won't bore you with every insignificant detail that happened over the next few days, but here are the cliff notes.

 

I would live with Shy for the time being until I could get back on my feet again. Adjusting had been easy for me. After all, it was our childhood home. There were already a couple of guest rooms that used to belong to my parents and me. I settled right back into my old room. Not much had changed.

 

After a while, I began to feel a little bad about just living here and not doing much. I had savings in my account, sure, but I wasn't actively earning an income. Now that I was under someone else's roof, I'd take this as a chance to try and find a new job. In the meantime, I felt like I was just mooching off my sister as she picked up the broken pieces of my life and put them back together.

 

When I brought this up to her, she laughed and said, "As long as you can clear the ants out, do dinner when I don't feel like cooking and feed Martie sometimes, I don't care what you contribute. When you get a job, then we can talk about splitting the bills, but for now, don't worry about a thing."

 

That was a good deal, I guess. Didn't do much to shake the feeling, but at least it seemed like Shy'd be happy to have company other than her dog. Living with Shiloh was alright, but then it seemed as if the ant problem was getting worse. At first, it was just annoying. We'd try to get rid of as many as we could, but at this point, it wasn't interfering with our lives.

 

Then we started finding them in our food.

 

I remember it like yesterday, the first time it happened. I'd been in charge of dinner, as usual. I'd been sure to clean everything rigorously since this was a concern we'd already talked about. It wasn't enough. I didn't see any ants in my ingredients as I was cooking, but perhaps that was because I'd been tired from clearing out ants all day. I was about halfway through eating the pepper steak with Shiloh when her eyes widened.

 

"Brynn, what the hell?"

 

"What?" I replied.

 

"Oh my god, Brynn, there's an ant in the sauce!"

 

My heart dropped. "What? How? But I cleaned everything! I didn't see any ants as I was cooking."

 

"Clearly, you didn't clean it good enough! Not if I'm seeing ants in the sauce!"

 

"Shiloh, relax. It's only one ant, just pick it out."

 

Shiloh glared at me.

 

"Is this how we'll eat our food from now on, Brynn? Picking out ants from dinner every fucking night? No, Brynn. I can't live like that. No, this better not happen again."

 

She got up from the table, taking her plate to the kitchen.

 

"Where are you going? You haven't finished it!" I said.

 

"Oh, I'm finished, all right," Shiloh barked back, emptying the contents of her plate into the bin.

 

"Really? Dude, it's just one ant!" I said.

 

"Yeah, well, I don't care. I lost my appetite."

 

I'm unsure what I could've said. Shiloh was insufferable when she was like this. I get that the ants were stressing her out, but why did she have to take it out on me? I didn't want to be at war with my sister, so I extended an olive branch.

 

"I'm sorry," I said, finally.

 

Her eyes briefly flicked towards mine as she walked past me to her room. She didn't say anything back.

 

The next morning, I woke up with ant bites covering my arm. What. The Fuck.

 

No more.

 

I was determined, now more than ever, to get rid of these things. Bug spray, bug bombs, smoke, bleach, I tried everything I could possibly think of. Remedies I read on the internet, even a few of my own ideas. But no matter what I did, they still kept coming back. Shiloh was becoming more and more irritable the more the ants fought back. She's been experiencing the ant bites too, even with bucket loads of insect repellant. I could hardly blame her for acting out over this; truthfully, it was starting to affect me, too. This house was becoming a nightmare to live in.

 

I started to wonder if being homeless was better than living like this.

 

In one of our many, draining conversations about them, Shy explained that the ants must've invaded her house when she got flooded. That's when she first started noticing them. It made sense, but that happened months ago, and her house was probably the least affected out of her neighbourhood. Quite frankly, I doubted if the flood was really the culprit because the number of ants we found each day did not justify this explanation. There had to be something else going on that I wasn't seeing.

 

I asked her point blank if the house was messy before I came. She shifted in her seat. She admitted that okay, the stress of her divorce being finalised made it hard for her to find time to clean up, but even if the house was messy, how could the ants still be showing up now that it was cleaned up? It was a good point.

 

We were well and truly stuck.

 

She mentioned that when we were kids, we had a similar ant infestation, though she didn't remember it being this bad.

 

"Really? When was this?" I asked.

 

"You were too young to remember. I was 13 at the time. It was right before Mum got sick. There were ants everywhere, just like now. Seems this place has always been popular with them."

 

She was right; I would've been around 6 at the time. A thought struck my mind. One I didn't really want to entertain, but I didn't see any other way out.

 

"How did Dad get rid of them?" I asked.

 

Shiloh furrowed her brows at me. "I don't know."

 

"Do... Do you think we could ask him?" I hesitated.

 

I didn't want her to look at me the way she was looking at me right now.

 

Despite the hundreds we must've killed, the infestation only got worse. To the point where it seemed like everywhere you looked, there were ants. In my closet, my bed, my cabinets, the pantry, the walls, the toilet, in the sink, the dog bowl; I swear I saw a couple come out of the shower head.

 

I was at my breaking point.

 

Conversations with Shiloh had become cold and disheartening. She rarely wasn't pissed off, and she only seemed to want to yell and blame me for the ants, or make me feel like shit for things that were out of my control. I began to dread talking to her. I just wanted to stay in my room and live away from her, away from the noise, but my room was becoming unsafe from these monstrous ants.

 

Fuck it; this was *our* childhood home. I'll be damned if I gave it up without a fight.

 

"We *have* to do something about these ants," I told her for the umpteenth time.



"Goddammit, Brynn! What the fuck do you think I've been doing? I'm worried sick! They could give Martie an infection. They could eat my house to pieces! Of-fucking-course I want them gone! I can't stand them!"

 

"I know, I know. We've been trying everything we can. But here's the thing. It feels like we've been fighting these bastards for forever. We can't keep this up or it'll never end. We have to find the source of these ants. The best defence is an offence."

 

I'd thought about this before I psyched myself up to talk to Shiloh. Perhaps they'd formed a nest somewhere in the house. We just needed to find it. Once the nest is gone, there'd be no more ants, right? Well, turns out, it wasn't that simple. But we'll get to that.

 

Shiloh looked at me, flicking between my eyes before resting her own at her feet, deep in thought.

 

"I have no idea where they could be coming from. I tried looking for a source, but I swear, on everything holy, they don't seem to be coming from anywhere! Go scope out the entire house and tell me I'm wrong. I couldn't find an actual trail that these ants are coming from. It's like they're just going wherever they want!"

 

So I did just that. I scoured through every room, pulled every rug, and opened every door. Shy was right. They didn't seem to be coming from anywhere. What looked like an ant trail led to a point where the ants divulged paths, like an intersection. From there, these split paths would lead to even more intersections. They all led right back to each other. There was no obvious source. Shy was right. These ants just seemed to be crawling wherever they damn well pleased. It was both mind-boggling and infuriating — highly unusual behaviour for ants.

 

Scratch that, the whole infestation was unusual. They stuck around for several months after the flood, and they got worse over time instead of better, to the point where it seemed like killing them was only increasing their numbers. They seem to have no source and act extremely strangely for ants.

 

I'm not kidding when I say I've googled this for hours. There's *nothing;* no explanation for what's happening.

 

I don't know what came over me. It must've been the sheer rage and frustration I felt. Can you blame me? I was going around and around in circles with no end in sight. It's enough to drive anyone insane.

 

I kicked the wall as hard as I could. I ended up busting a hole where I'd kicked.

 

A swarm of ants charged out of the hole immediately. There must have been hundreds of thousands of little black ants, writhing around inside the walls. They almost resembled black veins pulsing through the house.

 

What the actual *fuck?*

 

It was enough to make me sick to my stomach. I told Shiloh what had happened. When I showed her the hole, she broke down crying. She told me she was already stressed out about me and how I was doing with my situation, and now these impossible ants that only ever seem to increase are ruining her life. And she's not the only one. Martie has been growing anxious and uncomfortable. Shiloh worried that ants might've crawled inside him, the thought of which terrified the everloving Jesus out of me.

 

I mean, what if they're inside *us?*

 

It was decided. We bought a tent and some sleeping bags and started sleeping outside for the nights. How sad and pathetic it is that our home is now a battlefield from which we must steer clear of? The nights were cold, the ground was hard and uncomfortable against us, we barely got any sleep night to night. We also risked other nasties sneaking into our tent while we were asleep.

 

It was a silent agreement, but we both knew we'd rather take our chances.

 

You could say our eating habits have also been becoming increasingly unhealthy. After we started sleeping outside, we would rarely eat for fear that the ants would spoil our food. They forced us to waste all this food by clearing out our pantries for the tiny chance that they'd go away. They didn't.

 

The only time we eat is at dinner, which consists of my sister ordering take-out and us eating outside where it's safe. We keep the dog food outside too, and Martie eats in the garden.

 

Then we found ants in his food bowl.

 

Nothing could describe the terror we felt.

 

I started drinking again, after that. Call it the straw that broke the camel's back, I don't know. I couldn't handle it anymore. I'm sorry. The bottle was the only thing that gave me any comfort anymore. When we first started living together, Shiloh tried to help me stop. She got me into rehab programs and therapy; the works. It was one of her only conditions for me to live here. I would never drink inside her house, or I was out. I guess it kind of worked for a while, but this shit is killing me.

 

I spent my own dime, using emergency savings. She didn't have to know. I'd do it while Shiloh went to work. Hid the slabs and bottles behind flower pots. I feel so ashamed to admit this, but you must understand how bad it was getting.

 

When Shiloh was at work, I'd have nothing to do except go on my phone and watch over Martie. You have to understand, I was bored constantly, stressed out of my mind and I hated living in a fucking tent. I needed this.

 

It all came to a head yesterday. I had checked out early. Shy said she wasn't tired yet. I didn't think much of it at the time. Pressing her hadn't even crossed my mind. I woke up hours later in the night to a noise that sounded like someone splashing water over something. I zipped open the entrance to find Shiloh holding a bottle of my whiskey, though I was too groggy to realise what was happening. She didn't hear me creep out from my tent as she doused the walls of our house in alcohol.

 

"Shiloh, what the *fuck* are you doing?"

 

A small gasp escaped her as she stiffened up. She whipped around to face me. The flicker of flame from the lighter revealed the tears in her eyes.

 

"I've given up, Brynn. This is the only solution."

 

"B-but that's *mine!"* I stammered. "How did you find it?"

 

"You think I didn't notice your bullshit? All those times you had that stench on your breath? I'm not a fucking idiot, Brynn."

 

The way she spat out the word "stench" made me flinch. A wave of guilt washed over me.

 

"But don't worry, Brynn. You saved me the trouble of buying gasoline," she muttered as she walked past me.

 

What?

 

"Hang on, what are you *doing?"*

 

She wandered over to my stash, picking out another bottle and twisting the cap off. I raced up to her.

 

"What the fuck are you doing? Shiloh?" I tried to grab the bottle from her hands. Shiloh grimaced as she yanked it out of my reach.

 

"Fuck *off!"*

 

She grabbed a cloth from her jacket pocket and stuffed it inside the bottle.

 

"SHILOH!"

 

She pulled out a lighter.

 

"This is insane!"

 

"Oh, what? More insane than living in a fucking tent instead of your own bloody house?" she retorted.

 

"That's our childhood home, Shy! You can't do this!"

 

"I FUCKING HAVE TO!" Shiloh squealed. "This house is pure evil! If we stay in here for any longer, we. Will. Die! Do you want to fucking die, Brynn?" I resigned to stunned silence as she stared at me, panting and shivering in deep, emotional pain. My logical mind was trying to reason with me, assuring me that she had just gotten over-stressed and had finally snapped. And it made perfect sense, it did, but I couldn't shake the feeling. I couldn't explain it to you, I just knew. There was something in the bigger picture I was missing. Something very, very important.

 

I think she saw it too because, in a broken, shaky voice, she spoke.

 

"Go. Go inside."

 

My heart fell to my stomach. I turned and left. Before I found the door, I turned back to Shiloh. She nodded at me. "I'll wait," she murmured.

 

Into the belly of the beast, I went.

 

The fetid smell instantly hit me harder than a brick. Death permeated through the air with a chokehold grip on my throat. Even with barely any food in my stomach, I threw up.

 

I refused to look at the floor that I just hurled on. Barely managing to find the light switch, I hastily flicked it on, desperate to uncover what that horrible fucking smell was.

 

What I saw nearly made me throw up again.

 

I almost didn't realise the animal on the floor was dead until I realised it wasn't breathing that was making it move; it was the ants crawling over it.

 

"Oh god, Martie," I whispered, stepping closer to him.

 

The poor dog had been reduced to skin and bones. Any semblance of life, organ or muscle extinguished at the moment I laid eyes upon his decaying body. His once brown fur was tainted with drying blood, which I noticed soaked onto the carpet beneath him. His closed eyes oozed a disgusting, green, mucus-esque substance. His nose also had this same, sickeningly snotty mucus running out of it. Dozens of ant bites riddled his skin, inflamed so horrendously that I could see them all through his fur. A tiny hole jutted through the nape of his neck. It looked much like the entrance to that of an ant mound. If you know what the inside of an ant mound looks like, you'd be as horrified as I was when I realised what the ants had done to him. The thought of what his insides looked like brought tears to my eyes.

 

I now knew why Shiloh thought this place was so evil.

 

I won't lie to you, we'd known for some time now that Martie had been suffering. We took him to the vet last week because we thought he had an infected ant bite. The vet ended up finding a tumour under his left front leg. I knew Martie was starting to get old; the faint grey around his muzzle proved as much. Shiloh got him from a shelter about seven years ago. At the time, he was already over three years old, according to her. He was due to go in for surgery to remove the tumour next week. We decided to keep him outside full-time until we could sort out this infestation problem. The ants certainly wouldn't have helped his already dire situation.

 

We'd kept him outside ever since...

 

How did he get inside?

 

Wait, how long had he stayed here? How did he get in without me knowing? I... I looked after him. He was *my* responsibility when Shiloh was away. The lump in my throat choked me like a disease as I felt my eyes moisten. How could I have let this happen?

 

"I don't blame you."

 

I whipped around to meet Shiloh's tear-filled eyes.

 

"I'm going to do it now," she whispered, reigniting the lighter.

 

My tears silenced me. I couldn't disagree, even if I wanted to. Letting out a shuddered sigh, I wordlessly followed her outside.

 

There we were, standing outside our home for the final time. A place I could've never imagined becoming so tainted when I was a kid. Despite all the pain this house caused us, a dark, nagging feeling tugged at my brain. *Stop! Stop this now! You can't burn it down! There's something wrong!*

 

I chalked it up to my sentimentality and sewed my lips shut as Shiloh lit the Molotov on fire.

 

"Fuck you!" She screamed as she hurled the bottle towards the house.

 

It didn't take long for the entire place to go up. It felt like an eternity, staring at the fire as it consumed each part of the house, burning ever brighter.

 

"We need to leave," Shiloh said.

 

I snapped out of it. "Huh?"

 

"We need to *leave,*" she reiterated.

 

I didn't argue with her. The neighbours have surely called the police already. We hurried to her car and sped out of the driveway. I didn't know where we were going. All I know is, if the destination were anywhere but here, I'd be happy.

 

Here we are, in a motel room, somewhere about an hour away from the pile of ashes that once was our house. Shiloh is sleeping in a twin bed alongside mine; we've hardly spoken a word to each other since. Truthfully, I wasn't going to tell my story. I was going to take this to my grave and try to move on with my life. Would anyone even believe me if I told them this anyway? I wouldn't blame anyone who clicked off this post, because this is insanity, I get it. But now I have to say something. I need help.
