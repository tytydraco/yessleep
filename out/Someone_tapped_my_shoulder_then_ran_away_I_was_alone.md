Have you ever tapped someone on the shoulder, then ran away? Or tapped their left shoulder, but you were on the right? It’s a funny joke, and people usually laugh, at least for the first time that you do it. However, I was alone in my garage at 3AM when I felt a tap on my shoulder. Yes, I know that 3AM is when all of the horror stories you’ve ever read begin. But it was 3AM, right on the dot when I felt the first tap. Of course, I looked back, in a terrified shock. But there was nobody there - and there was nowhere anyone could have hid. If someone had quickly ran out, I would have heard them, and they would have to be a superhero to unlock then re-lock the door in that amount of time. Eventually, I thought it was just a trick of the mind because I had stayed up for way too long. 

Until, at 3:15, I felt it again. I tried to brush it off as another wacky coincidence but it was concerning. Could it be some throbbing medical issue? Now, I was pretty worried. But I decided to check my cameras before going to the doctors, just in case there was a more realistic explanation. Maybe something had fallen a few times and I had not noticed it. Or perhaps there was really a person doing this. Eventually, once I had found the camera screen in my study, I turned it on to review the recording of the night.

Yes I have security cameras in my garage, some idiotic teenagers broke in a few months ago and I don’t want that to happen again.

I rewatched the events of what had just happened, until I finally got to where the clock would strike 3, if I had a clock in there. I only knew what the time was when I felt the taps because I reviewed the tapes. I was now creeped out - why could it happen at the exact second it struck to that hour. Then, ten seconds before, I saw a figure appear in a flash. I couldn’t make many details about them because of how gloomily lit it was, but I knew they did not break in. They had appeared out of thin air, in a gold-hued flash of light. Weirdly, I had not noticed such flash when the time came. At exactly three, they tapped me on the back, then in a matter of seconds were gone.  What was I even watching? I skipped ahead to 3:15, where the same thing happened. I decided to cut to the current recording, seeing my garage in real time, as to maybe catch them again. I saw in the bottom of the screen it was now 3:44. At 3:45, they appeared again, but they could not find me, and thus they disappeared. 

I went to bed, my mind racing thinking about what I had just seen. Someone, or something, had it out for me. It was not until 4 that I was drifting off to sleep, obviously a lot more tired than I thought I was. I can’t remember anything past 4 last night. I only remember waking up in the today. morning and typing this out. But I do remember one final thing.

Just before I fell asleep, I felt one final tap on my shoulder.
