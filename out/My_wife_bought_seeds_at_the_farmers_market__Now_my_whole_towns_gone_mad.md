My whole town’s gone into a state of mass hypnosis. It started with the tomato seeds.



She got a whole bunch of vegetable seeds, but she talked about the tomato ones the most. 



Apparently, they were the juiciest and most reddish tomatoes she had ever seen. The guy said he got them from a Native American tribe down south. Jokingly warning her how good they are.



My wife planted all the vegetables the day after. Surprisingly, some of them soon grew small roots from the ground, but one rose to dominate above them all. The tomato plant had sprouted, and small tomatoes were growing on it. 



My wife was excited about her gardening achievement. That very night, she picked off the still small tomatoes and put them on toast with some cheese and ham.



 She kept saying how unbelievably delicious they were. Her eyes were rolling back into her head midway through her toast. 



After the first one, she walked back to the tomato plant and picked up the remaining ones. 



Even the ones that definitely didn’t look ripe. 



She knows how bad my acid reflux gets whenever I eat one, but she kept persuading me to at least have a bite. 



I managed to resist. 



The morning after, I woke up early for work. While eating my quick bowl of overnight oats, I looked out into the garden. 



Much to my surprise, the tomato plant had tomatoes growing on it again. This time, they were bigger than yesterday, and there were so many of them. It looked like the plant would crumble under the weight.



I walked out to the garden to look closer at them. I picked one of the plants, but the tomato was strangely greasy with gooey green slime. When I tried to smell them, a foul odor of iron and mold hit my nose.



When I came back from work, I looked out again, and they were all gone. I heard some rumbling in the shed outside. I thought a raccoon had found some trash and was having a feast in our garden shed. 



I walked over, and there was my wife looking for her gardening tools with seeds in her hand.



“What are you doing, honey?”



“Oh, I love how the tomatoes taste! See how fast they grow? I want to plant a couple more of them.”



“Are you sure there’s gonna be space for them? We can barely fit the plants we got there now.”



“It’s okay if there isn’t, I’ll take out the other vegetables and plant them.”



“Oh, but why? I was excited about them, and you know I can’t eat tomatoes.”



“I know, you can’t, but they’re just so good! I know it upsets your stomach, but you should try them.”



“I think a night of stomach acid is not worth it.”



She nodded back, but it looked like what I said went over her head. She started digging through the tools again.



I had a good engineering job at a nearby agricultural company, so my wife was able to stay home and take care of the household. She would usually wake up late, around 8 am. Much later than my usual 6:30 alarm. 



I got dressed up for work and went down into the kitchen. To my surprise, she was already picking the tomatoes in the garden. All the tomato plants sprouted overnight and were overgrown with tomatoes.



“They are magical!” My wife yelled out from the garden. I just nodded my head and started pouring up some coffee.



When I looked back, she was talking to the neighbour and giving him some of the tomatoes from her basket. The basket was already overflowing, but the tomato plants weren’t even halfway picked. I yelled out to her that I’d be on my way to work, and she looked up, waved at me, and got back to her picking. 



Her behaviour seemed strange; she would usually at least give me a hug or even plead with me not to leave the house and stay around for a while. 



Plus, how did all the plants spring up again? The first one grew really fast, but it still seemed believable. How could a plant grow in only 10 hours and have fruit on it? Most of my concerns went away as I got to work and had to focus on other important things.



That day I had to stay at work longer. Some issues with our conveyor belt came up. I tried calling my wife to let her know I'd be coming in late that evening, but she didn’t answer. 



I arrived home at around 8 pm hungry as ever. Excited about my wife's cooking. When I stayed late at work, she would always prepare a meal I enjoyed to cheer me up. 



Walking into the kitchen, I saw my wife sitting at our dinner table, eating tomatoes out of a huge basket. The kitchen looked clean and polished with no food in sight.



“Hi, honey, how are you doing?” I said and sat at the table.



“Good.” She replied. Barely looking at me, and continuing to munch on her tomatoes.



“I tried calling you, saying that I’d be coming late from work, but you didn’t answer.”



“Oh, must have missed it.” She replied coldly.



“Did you cook anything?” 



“No, I didn’t have time.”



“What on earth could you be so busy about? You don’t work.” I said quietly to myself. Not wanting to start an argument.



“Have some tomatoes if you’re hungry, honey.” She said, this time looking up at me with a joyful face.



“You know I can’t have any, my reflux would be crazy.”



“But these are so good. I’m sure the tomatoes wouldn’t hurt you. They wouldn’t do such a thing to you.” She now had a big grin on her face, with her pupils dilated and eyes opened unnaturally wide.



“Never mind.”



When the first basket was finished, she walked out to the backyard to get some more.



To my surprise, the garden already looked way different from the time I left this morning. Not only were all the vegetables gone, but the flowers my wife planted when we first moved in were all plucked out.



When she came back, I tried talking to her again. Asking why she would replace the flowers she loved, but she kept repeating how the tomatoes are so good, and that I need to try them to understand. 



All the stress from work had finally piled up, and made my eyes feel like two heavy bags. I decided there was no talking to her anymore and retreated upstairs. 



Looking from my bedroom window, I could see my neighbours, who my wife had given tomatoes that morning, digging around in their garden.



Like magic, the morning after, all the plants my wife planted yesterday were overgrown with tomatoes again. The backyard now looked like a red ball pit. She was already bringing the first basket in when I was making my morning coffee. She sat at the table and started eating them.



“A nutritious and well-balanced breakfast.” I said, trying to make a joke, but she flashed an angry look. I took my cup of coffee and walked out into the garden to see what was going on there.



“Hey Adam, how are you doing?” I asked my next-door neighbour who I could see standing next to a fence, eating one of the juicy red tomatoes.



“Oh, I’m doing great, Steve. The tomatoes your wife gave us are unbelievable. We planted them yesterday, and they have grown overnight. Have you tried them yet? Your wife told me you haven’t because of some stomach problems.”



“Yeah, I could see you guys digging in the garden yesterday. No, I haven’t tried them. I got a bad case of acid reflux, and tomatoes can ruin my day.”



“Oh, I knew we had to plant when I tried the first one. You need to try them. ” He now had the same manic look my wife flashed me yesterday.



That day's work was slow, which gave me time to think about what was happening at home.



I didn’t want to creep myself out too much, but my wife's behaviour was odd to say the least. 



On my drive home from work, I saw people from my town digging in their gardens. It was the season when people would usually start planting, but why did everyone decide to start today?



Arriving home, I saw my wife and next-door neighbours sitting at our dinner table. We did have good relations with them, but this was the first time they ever came over. 



Everyone was sitting around the table eating the tomatoes and talking about how delicious they were.



No one said hi when I entered, not even my wife. Almost like the tomatoes put them in a state of hypnosis. I said hi to them, but barely anyone seemed to care. Only once I sat down, my neighbour looked at me.



“Come on, neighbour. Still haven’t changed your mind about the tomatoes? Take some, there are a few from my garden there too.”



“I really can’t.” I replied.



“They wouldn’t hurt you, son. Just have a bite.” He tried to push the tomato uncomfortably close to my face. I almost had to slap his hand away. 



The tomato smelled foul. I could see the green gooey slime on the tomato’s skin. My neighbour's fingers were covered with it too. 



After seeing that there was no chance of getting me to eat one, he resorted to munching on it himself and talking to the others at the table. 



I looked out into the garden, and at first I couldn’t believe my eyes. The dirt all over our garden was tilled. I looked over the fence, and my neighbour's garden looked the same.



I tried to walk out onto it to take a closer look, but my wife ran from the table and started dragging me by my arm.



“Stop it, you’re going to hurt them!” She yelled out.



“Jesus Christ, all right, calm down!” I yelled out too. 



She wouldn’t let go of the grip until I walked into the house again. She threw a nasty frown and walked back to the table to her basket of tomatoes. 



Both of my neighbours were looking at me now, too, with a scolding face like parents who learned about your last misdeed.



The morning after, I woke up to a loud banging and rattling like I was next to a construction site. I looked out my window and saw my wife with some of our neighbours taking down the shed in our backyard. 



I hurried out with my pajamas still on, almost tripping on the stairs. I didn’t even put on any shoes. Ran out into the garden and started screaming at everyone to tell me what the hell was going on.



“We’re making room for tomatoes. There’s nowhere else to plant them.” She smiled and looked back at me with a very peaceful expression, like what she said made complete sense.



“What do you mean, make room for the tomatoes?! The garden is filled with them! Where are you going to put all my tools?” I screamed at her.



“They’re in the basement.” She wasn’t smiling anymore.



I ran in front of them, waving my hands above my head, saying they needed to stop and get going. 



Their looks turned from concern to anger. One of the neighbours, Jack, dropped his claw hammer, walked up to me, pushed me, and told me to get lost. 



I couldn’t believe it at first. I stood there for a second with a bewildered look on my face. Then they all dropped their tools and, in almost magical unison, started pushing me and telling me to get away, and that I don’t understand. My wife joined them, too. 



At that point, I retreated into the house. I was panting, my whole body was shaking, and sweat started forming on my lower back. 



I called in sick to work and sat at the dinner table for a while. I had no idea how much time had passed by, and my mind filtered out all the outside noise. 



When my emotions finally calmed down and I came to. They were still working on the shed outside.



I ran back into the bedroom, dressed, and walked out to ask someone for help, but to my dismay, everywhere I looked, people were in their gardens digging up dirt with a basket of tomatoes next to them. 



This happened four days ago. I have not been to work since. Over the weekend, I tried to go to the farmer’s market, but the guy was not there anymore. No matter how hard I looked, he was nowhere to be found. 



People in my town have completely dug up their gardens to plant the tomato plants. The ones who don’t have space anymore have resorted to the same plan my wife had. 



Slowly taking down sheds, patios, fences, fire pits, and all other things taking up space in their yards.



I thought about calling the police, but what was I going to say to them? That some group of avid tomato lovers is tearing up their backyards. 



Reporting the assault is also not an option. I have no witnesses. They’d probably turn it against me.



When they don’t work, they all gather at our house, eat tomatoes, and whisper. 



Nothing else, just whispering and eating the tomatoes. 



I sometimes listen to them whisper the same phrase over and over: “They’re so delicious.”.



Whenever I walk down, they all look at me in unison. Their gaze follows my every move like a shadow.



Edit: I can hear them outside the door now. 



The room is full of the smell of rotten iron.



They’re chanting. 



*“It’s time to try the tomatoes.”*
