\*\*\*

Myer Danforth was as kind a man as they came. A good father, hardworking husband, and an amazing grandfather. He was *my* grandfather.

Above these, Grandpa Danforth, "Pawpaw Dan" I used to call him, was an amazing storyteller. He always loved to tell me stories of his times when he was young. Particularly about the times he'd go around looking for a scoop for the papers. He used to work as a columnist for the *Weeping Willow Ledger* back in the day.

He had enlisted for a short time in Vietnam, where he wrote for their newsletter as well. Those, he obviously was a little more hesitant to talk about. I never really pushed him much about it, either, having been told many times by my folks that that was *not* something you should ever try to push a person to talk about.

Sometimes, when I'd get extra lucky, he'd actually tell me about one or two times where he actually got a laugh while stationed in a watchtower in Saigon with his pals in arms. One thing he'd always told me about was his dream to want to travel the world. One of the reasons, of course, he joined the Army. When he came home, I remember Grandma telling me just how much of a different man Pawpaw Dan was.

"War does things like that to men." she said. She shook her head when she said this, staring off to the right, ironically the same way you might expect a veteran to do coming off the battlefield. Something Pawpaw Dan *did* do on occasion, usually when something was stressing him.

Something I should make clear is that my grandfather was, at least from what he'd tell me, a strict non-combatant. He was a C.O., but still wanted to pursue a passion in writing, as well as serve his country. Again, that's what he always told *me*. God only knows now whether or not he actually *did* have to take up arms against the V.C.s, and I'm sure not even God would actually blame him if he did, and couldn't bring himself to share anything like that -- even with family.

Like I said, *NOT* something you're supposed to really press them about.

Whether he ever took up arms and spilled enemy blood or not, though, it was clear that *something* had haunted him from his service days. He never became an alcoholic or anything like that, surprisingly, but grandma told me of times where his temperament would sometimes make *her* want to down more glasses of wine than usual. As well as this, she told me of times where she'd walk by a room in the house, only to find Pawpaw Dan knelt down on the floor, almost in some sort of prayer, she described, while whispering in these weird tongues.

When she'd say something to him about it, apparently he'd then snap and devolve into a sobbing mess. "He'd always shout out these names, all crazy-like." she said to me.

"Names?" I asked. "You mean perhaps his platoon?"

"Some of them, I guess. He'd shout names of people he showed me in his Army photos, sure. But then there were others he'd shout out." I raised my eyebrows.

"Others?"

She nodded and replied "Yeah, ones I'd never heard before. Ones I'm not even sure were even *real*!"

"What do you mean?"

"I... I don't really know how to describe 'em, Andy, other than they sounded similar to some old pagan or voodoo gods or something." She stared off to the right of me for a moment again, narrowing her eyes, losing herself in concentration. Suddenly I heard her begin whispering "*Jubbilex, zancis melioss..."*

"What?" I asked. She didn't reply. She didn't notice me at all, in fact. or so it seemed. I could hear continue muttering. She was right about them being near impossible to really describe as well.

*"Adrayok aouidin Jehovak... Kaos ralik... Jehovak adrayok melioss..."*

I remember vividly how much this frightened me; a 17 year old kid by that time. I would've almost sworn I was watching my grandmother being possessed by a demon. I had to shake her lightly to bring her back to her senses. She was startled a moment before relaxing again. "Grandma, what was that? Was that what you were hearing from Pawpaw Dan?"

With a grave expression, she nodded her head. After that, nothing further was discussed about that, or about his time in Vietnam between me and her. Pawpaw Dan hadn't said much about it either after that day. He would still tell other stories, of course, usually just ones of the numerous anctics he and his friends would pull on the schoolyard. Those were always amusing, even if he *did* end up repeating a few of them, but if course, they wouldn't have my interest, my curiosity, the same as the mystery of what'd happened to him during his time in the Army.

You may be thinking that I'd have the good sense God gave a tree stump to *not* ask him about the weird chanting Grandma told me about. Sadly, you'd be dead wrong.

It was a few months after the day I'd talked to Grandma about it that he and I were sitting around a fire pit, sharing two six-packs of Budweiser while he told his stories. It was something the two of us did just about every weekend ever since I turned 16. Two guys, sharing shitty beer around the fire.

I guess, to my credit, You could just as easily pass this incident off as me downing one too many and clouding my better judgement. Regardless, things got quiet, settling down, with the flames themselves even starting to die down to embers. That was when I asked him "Pawpaw, who is *"Jubbilex, zanctis melioss"*?"

He looked at me for a moment, eyebrows raised in confusion. "That name," I said, "Who is it?"

"What... What name?" That was when I started to see his body slowly begin to tremble. It was faint, but still just noticeable enough.

"I've heard you whisper that name, as well as some of the members of your platoon from back in..." I froze there. Pawpaw Dan had the look of someone who'd just been shot!

"Where did you hear that name?!" he barked. This caused my heart to jump into my throat. I opened my mouth, wanting to speak, to either try and change the subject or come up with an explanation. Nothing would come out, though.

Pawpaw Dan's body was now shaking a lot more violently. I was bracing myself for any second for him to lunge forth from his chair and come at me. He wasn't violent (or at least -- again -- not that *I* was aware of), but his shaking, the abrupt shift in tone, and the crazed, almost deranged look he had on his face made me wonder if he might end up breaking that little perfect streak, you know?

Fortunately for me, he did no such thing. Instead, he just leaned forward, pushing himself uncomfortably close to my face and whispered, shuddering "Get the hell out of my sight, boy." For a second, I didn't move. I couldn't.

At the snap of his fingers toward the house, however, I snapped out of my stupor and quickly got up to leave. Before I got two steps from the fire pit, though, I felt him grab my wrist. Hard.

I stopped and turned. He stood up and once again got in my face and whispered "And so help me *GOD*, if you EVER say those words in my presence again..." He trailed off, keeping his face chiseled in horror and perhaps... *sadness.*

Terrified out of my mind, I promptly stumbled as fast as I could back into the house. He didn't follow me. He stayed out there all through the night until sunrise. I didn't sleep that night, and I don't imagine he did either, though obviously for two different reasons. I was afraid that, at any moment, he'd come back and wanna beat the hell out of me for triggering -- albeit inadvertently -- some sort of horrid memory for him from his war days. I think he was afraid that, whatever or *whoever* I'd said the names of were gonna come for him because I'd somehow invoked them or something. That morning, I remember he came in and I wanted to talk to him, try and apologize or bury the hatchet between us, but he didn't seem to see me and instead went straight to his own bedroom.

I noticed he still had that deranged sort of sunken look chiseled into his face when he did this. Admittedly, I was scared. Scared that he'd hate me, scared he'd kick me out, which would've been BAD for me, given that I had nowhere else to go after I was taken out of my mother's house when I was young. But honestly, I was even more frightened at the idea that I'd done something to him that could've pushed him over the edge. That my little stunt from that night may push him to... Well...

Well, to my relief, it never became that dire. In fact, it seemed more to me like he'd actually moved on from it. He never looked at me the way he did that night again, nor was the subject ever brought up again. Of course, that was also the end of our weekend hangouts around the fire. Not like I was in any objection after that night, though.

Despite it never being brought up again, though, it never stopped being something that had my head racked at nighttime. For years after that, I'd lay awake for hours, wondering not only who *"Adrayok Jubbilex"* was, but who he was to my grandfather as well. I'd never again mention to him or grandma or anybody else, but I never forgot and I never stopped being curious about it.

Jumping ahead to about 2009 or 2010, and I was then 24 and on my own. Both Grandma and Pawpaw Dan had passed away. Grandma was the first to go, with Pawpaw Dan following behind only 3 months later. I remember it was then that, for the second and last time, I saw that look on Pawpaw Dan's face, the look of horror and sorrow. He was in a bad state of health by that point, to the point where anything but breathing itself was a struggle for him.

Coughing and wheezing, I heard him choke out the question, "A-Andrew... Do you remember?" I knelt down by his bed.

"Remember what, Grandpa?" I asked.

"That... That night around the fire?" My own eyes went wide and I nodded. This caught me off guard for two reasons. First, because of the fact that *he* actually remembered that, but secondly because I wasn't sure how he was going to react now that the subject was breached again. I knew he wouldn't be able to fly off the handle like he almost had that night, but I was still very much concerned about the effect it'd have on him now, bedridden with one foot in his grave and the other tap dancing around it.

"Listen..." he wheezed, "Listen to me... Th-th-there's..." He jerked with a whooping cough before rasping "There's a journal at the old house. When it's... When it's time..." His eyes became heavy and his voice became faint. The E.K.G. beeping began to pick up rapidly. I could hear the nurses coming down the hall as I mashed the assistance button. Pawpaw Dan continued to fade as I heard him whisper "*Read it...* *It's my... My biggest story..."*

His eyes closed after that and his breath became relaxed. I tried to shake him a little but it was no use, he was out cold. The beeping became frantic for a moment and the last thing I heard before the nurses flooded the room and ushered me out was a single word, "*Obelisk..."*

I left the hospital after that in a daze. That would, unfortunately, be the last time I ever saw my grandfather. He passed away that following morning. Peacefully, according to the doctors. The next few days after that, for myself and the family, were a bit hazy. His funeral was that following week and we had him cremated. Following this was when we began going through his will.

He left me the house and everything in it, having apparently decided long ago that my mother wasn't deserving to take it. I decided I'd sell the house after taking whatever was of any real value to me or the family out of it. That's what led me to the journal I assumed Pawpaw Dan was referring to that day.

It was when I was going through his old room, searching through all of his old books, fishing rods, and even a few of his old journaling notes. Scattered underneath these was an old photo of Pawpaw Dan, however I could tell that it wasn't like the one I mentioned before of him and his platoon in 'Nam. In fact, I could tell this wasn't even *in* Vietnam where it was taken, nor were these soldiers or military personnel standing in the photo with him.

They all wore these black polo shirts with a giant "N" plastered over a three-pointed star and khaki shorts. These, I figured, must've been a tourist or journalism crew he'd ran with back in the day. The photo was dated 10/13/1964. He'd been sent home from the service only a couple months later, in January of '65. I wondered then who *these* people could be and/or how he could've met them if they weren't military personnel.

The back of the photo read, in bold red letters, **"Your country might have forgotten you, but I haven't. Some day, our story of what happened that day will be told."** I then began to rummage through the other papers gathered there. Through the miscellaneous mix of letters to editors and the notes for other columns he'd wrote, I found a small, dusty, red leather bound book. It had a lock on the front with no title.

It took me another 10 minutes of rummaging, but I managed to find the key and unlock the book. Immediately, a bunch of small pieces of paper fell out of the front of it. I ignored them, though, as the first page had those haunting words written on them, bold and red, just like the photo, in my grandfather's handwriting.

*"Adrayok aduae Jubbilex, zanctis melioss."*

Now all but spellbound, I hastily scrambled to collect the other slips of paper off the floor before leaving the old house and taking the book with me back to my apartment. From there, I spent the entire rest of the next week and a half reading the journal. By the time I'd finished even half of the journal, I knew why Pawpaw Dan was so afraid that night, as well as why he wanted me to find this journal. The following is the account of Myer Danforth and his team in Egypt in what he had referred to as "The Obelisk".

\*\*\*

# Sept. 4th, 1964

The weather has been hot. Miserably so. Men here wonder how the Congs have always done it, managed to move around so well when the heat alone was likely to sear the skin right from your bones. Some wonder if they're even human at all.

Personally, I could care less. The heat may be bad, but compared to the other burns I've suffered in the field, it's now more a mild nuisance to me than anything else. What's more important was that I was given the opportunity of, quite possibly, a lifetime. Two days ago, a telegram was mailed to me from an unknown organization, "Tri-Nexus", requesting that I attend some sort of meeting in Plai Mei tomorrow night.

Details were sparse, but I figure that, being that the time was promised to be compensated and there were no strings attached, what was the harm? Worst comes to worst, I simply say no to whatever it is and come back here to Saigon.

\----

**\[Western Union Telegram\]**

"To Danforth, M.

Your presence is requested by on behalf of the scientific community of America to attend a briefing conference. The conference is set for 1100 hours on Sept. 6th. There is no obligation to attend, however we promise that the time will be compensated financially, should you choose to attend. We hope you will choose to attend!

Sincerely,

Tri-Nexus Corp."

\*\*\*

# Sept. 6th, 1964

I went to the meeting yesterday. Let me say that I was astonished at first. The representatives of this "Tri-Nexus Corp." explained that they're a budding subsidiary of NASA, one specially designed for cosmic, spectral, and/or generally unexplainable phenomena. They claim to be stationed currently somewhere in the Middle East, somewhere in Cairo, I believe.

Apparently, the purpose of this meeting was to pitch a proposal to myself and a group of others, archeologists, I believe, by the looks of them. This made sense to me, given how much the Tri-Nexus representative's spiel seemed to hold their attention. I, on the other hand, had *very* little clue on exactly what the hell was being said.

From what I could make of it, he was proposing some sort of exhibition to the old pyramids of Egypt. What they want from *there* wasn't made clear. I would've asked, however I was quickly buried beneath all the others in attendance with questions of their own, ones the representative was likely far more interested in answering than the purpose of this crusade. I'd have left then and there, had the promise of $10 per every hour I spent in that conference not been so tempting.

Regardless of this, initially, my mind was essentially made up that I'd pass on this. As much a golden opportunity as this appears to be, I just can't shake the feeling that there's just too much I don't yet know, both about the expedition as well as Tri-Nexus itself. Leastways, judging from the way the others seemed to keep better track of what he was talking about than I, it's likely I would be more of a nuisance than any sort of asset.

Admittedly, though, after thinking about it a bit further, I can't help but wonder if I'm making the wrong judgement call. I would hate to miss what could be a possibility to be a part of something big. Something that could very well build rapport with top tiered journals in the country. I just don't know.

We were told that, should we be interested in the venture, we were supposed to report to the airport in California no later than the 17th of November, where we'd then board a flight to their headquarters in Cairo. To make that deadline, I'd need to come up with a decision no later than the 10th, which would give enough time for me to be flown to the rendezvous spot from Saigon.

\*\*\*


# Sept. 7th, 1964

I talked to one of my friends I made here in the field, Pvt. Rhys Elroy. I gave him a brief overview of the briefing conference as I understood it. For two main reasons, I of course, couldn't give him much detail. The first being that I was willing to bet money they weren't too keen on the idea of their secrets being shared with those that weren't invited themselves to the conference. The other being the fact that, again, I barely understood any of it myself.

I did, however, make it a point to ask him if he'd know any reason they'd want to excavate the ancient pyramids. I figured he may have some sort of clues regarding ancient mysteries, never being solved. As it happened, he said offhand, he wouldn't know of any such mystery or anomaly. The most educated guess he had was perhaps an investigation into the great pyramids of Giza. This *could* have made sense to me, except for the fact, aside from it's mysterious construction and it's endurance through time, there was never any "anomalous" properties to it.

Even still, Rhys had made a point that's stuck with me. He told me, "Who's to say there isn't something else entirely that the world's never seen before? Wouldn't you wanna be the one that shares it to the world firsthand? I know if it were *me*, *I'd* wanna take that bull right by the horns."

I must admit, he has a point with this. God himself only knows what sort of unknown phenomenon happens away from the media there, and I could be the first to change that. For American eyes, and possibly the world as a whole. That would be a dream for me.

I've always, admittedly, wanted to tell a story to the world, one with importance. To leave at least one fantastic legacy behind when it's my time to go. I just wish it weren't equally as difficult to justify going because of this, something being so fantastic, yet entirely false. Or perhaps dangerous.

Either way, I am still undecided. I still have another day to request permission from Command to leave Saigon for the airport. I just hope that's enough time to make my decision.

\*\*\*

# Sept. 10th, 1964

It's taking a lot for me to even write in this journal right now. In so little time, so much happened. It was abrupt and none of us were prepared.

An ambush, in the early hours of this morning. All around us, the grass and the trees all screamed furiously at us while simultaneously bursting forth with a combination of both machine guns and artillery tubes. Rhys's tower was one of the ones on fire watch when it happened. The enemy was smart, too. They coordinated this little attack in a way that allowed them to take out the watchtowers first using the artillery guns.

I remember those were the sounds to wake me up this morning. Following this, I watched men running down the hallway, shouting. The commotion raged on outside and I ran out to see, to my horror, all but two of the watch towers completely engulfed in flames. I wanted to see if Rhys might've been in one of the two surviving towers, but was quickly rushed off the field into our safe house, where I ended up staying well into sunrise.

I, and a few other non-combatants were retrieved when the commotion died down. We'd managed to run them back, but at incurring a heavy casualty rate, as well as the loss of our watch towers. I suppose that was their plan all along. Weaken our defenses with a small scale ambush before hitting us with all they'd have soon after. I found out later that my friend was indeed among one of the watchtowers to fall victim to the artillery shells. Pvt. Rhys Elroy is dead. May he find peace in Heaven.

As for me, it's because of his death, and the earlier suspicion of another, far deadlier attack from the enemy forces, that drove me to accept the decision to join the Tri-Nexus expedition. I still don't know what I expect to find there, what story I'll come away with, be it fantastic or not, but it's a story I'd rather tell than the ones I'd find here, in the midst of heartbreak and carnage.

The last thing I'll say for the time being is this, no matter what story I tell here, this will be my greatest story. My only hope is that the words here may open the eyes of others to something that was before all but unknown to the modern world. Something less traumatic than the horrors of war.

\*\*\*

# Sept. 16th, 1964

We arrived in California earlier this afternoon. Being a day early, there was no flight waiting for me, nor were there any Tri-Nexus representatives to greet me. This led me to having to rent a cheap motel in a shady part of town.

I have to admit, it feels so unnatural almost, being back in such a familiar setting. It feels almost like I don't belong here, having spent so long in godforsaken jungles that it seems more natural to me than city life, despite having actually grown up in the city for most of my life up to the time I was drafted. I'm not sure then whether or not it's a good thing then that I'll not actually be staying long enough to reacclimate. I'm not sure I really could if I tried.

In any case, I plan to leave tomorrow no later than 8:00 in the morning for the airport. I have to say, ever since that night, sleep has been a near impossibility for me. I can't get the sounds of the commotion out of my head. Honestly, that's essentially the only reason I even bothered to write in this damn thing at all today. Sheer insomnia.

Perhaps, a little bit of excitement about the upcoming expedition is to blame as well. That's a slightly more comforting thought, I suppose. That, and the idea that Rhys would be proud. That's about all I got now to keep me from going completely off the deep end; minor excitement and an expectation. I'm taking the bull, right by its horns. I'll witness something firsthand, either to fascinate me beyond all belief, or haunt me more than anything else ever could -- if that were even possible anymore...

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

# Sept. 17th, 1964

It's been at least five hours from the time we boarded the flight to Cairo. Only about half of those that attended the meeting in Saigon actually returned to go through with the expedition, myself included. To say I blame the ones that didn't return would be a lie, but all the same, I *do* pity them. They may never unlock the secrets that, according to the Tri-Nexus Corp., lie entombed with the pharaohs of old.

I'd arrived at the airport around 9:15 this morning, admittedly having a late start leaving the motel. When I arrived, I found that the plane had preceded my arrival, along with the Tri-Nexus representatives and about 12 other men and women, all young and all the archaeologist types I'd mentioned before. Before boarding, the Tri-Nexus representative, a Mr. Ronald Benson, once again thanked is for joining the expedition and shared his goal of finding a long hidden secret beneath the ancient pyramids of Egypt.

He of course never attempted to specify exactly *what* "secret" he was eluding to or how he and the other Tri-Nexus members came into possession of knowledge about such a thing possibly existing. This brought back a bit of my earlier apprehension about this venture. How is it that we're expected to join into something when nothing of its details are made clear?

Ironic really, such a question coming from someone who'd spent at least two and a half years taking orders from military officials, orders that had little, if any, sort of conceivable rhyme or reason to anyone but them. Still, this isn't the military. I'm not on the base in Saigon anymore. And if I'm not mistaken, these people weren't even military funded, either. I have to admit that makes me wonder still why it was that I, specifically, was invited to this.

I wasn't all that well known, not even in my own journalism circles. I'd never won any prizes, nor even nominated for any. They claimed they wanted an American journalist, an American voice, to tell of the events that may transpire to the rest of the country. Somehow, though, I just can't help but feel, deep down, that that alibi is nothing more than that -- an alibi, meant to silence me from further inquiries. My only questions then are exactly *what* is it they're *not* wanting me to tell of and/or why?

On the lighter side of things, though likely due solely to sheer exhaustion from the past few days of restlessness, I actually feel comfortable here on the plane enough to actually want to try and sleep again. Maybe this time, I'll imagine myself in a land far away from here, far from any charted territories. Maybe I'll envision myself upon a long-unknown world that had never before been tainted by human discovery.

Perhaps... Perhaps I'll imagine the very secret of the ancient tombs!

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

# Sept. 18th, 1964

It would appear that I spoke too soon about being able to sleep through the night. It's almost 2 in the morning and I'm unable to stay asleep any longer, though, this time it's through no fault of my traumatized subconscious. Rather, the troubled subconscious of another of the crew members.

The young man was Greek, thin and tall, having to actually slouch over a bit in his seat to not hit his head on the cargo hold up above him. It was around 10 or 11:00 last night, while myself and the others were trying to sleep, that I first heard him grunting. The others didn't seem to take notice of this, but I did. I awoke to see him thrashing about wildly in his seat.

I watched him for the better part of ten minutes, in which time, I also heard him muttering incoherently. Soft as it was, I couldn't make anything of the young man's whispers. Despite this, I *was* able to discern certain, albeit still strange, syllables in the man's disgruntled speech.

Unfortunately, I wasn't listening hard enough to really pick up on any of the syllables themselves to attempt writing them out here. In any event, it wasn't long before the young man settled back into his seat and relaxed. I, on the other hand, knew further rest was out of the question. Once again, forced to cope through this journal through insomnia and anxiety.

I will note however that the man's mutterings weren't of simple chatter or babble, as is sometimes common with those suffering sleeping disorders, but rather more like those of one suffering a personality disorder. What I mean by this was that, not only was the aforementioned "speech" in a dialect wholly unfamiliar to any language known to me -- or likely anyone else for that matter -- but it was done so on growling, almost primal chants. I could hear the sounds, the phrases, being repeated, vigorously, too, as if it were something significant to him on a spiritual level.

Of course, I also understand that this may just be a one time occurrence. That it likely wouldn't happen again and would pose no danger to me, himself, or anyone else. And yet, in spite of even this, I still don't feel safe trying to sleep again. Perhaps I'll have better luck tomorrow.

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

# Sept. 19th, 1964

It was a long ride, having gotten absolutely no sleep. I'm having trouble even now. I might as well rename this my journal of insomnia.

The young man from last night, on the other hand, was almost calm as could be. Almost. He'd never been much relaxed ever since the departure from California. I'd noticed the stoic, almost frightened expression he carried on his face the entire time. I wonder if the two details aren't in one way or another connected.

It would, given any other circumstance, be easy to write off the poor bastard's condition as product of mental disorder. Hell, with the display from last night, I'd have ventured to guess he suffered from an acute schizophrenia or perhaps even a disassociative identity. Again, under *most* circumstances, but if I'm not mistaken, each member of this expedition crew had been evaluated sometime prior to the flight.

I know I was, though likely not quite as extensively as they perhaps were. I was given a simple psych evaluation with questions relating to my personal health and well being, and perhaps any family history of mental illness. I would guess that the others, being men and women of science, that they'd be more heavily screened. How he managed to slip by with a glaring stigma such as what I believe I saw last night, I'm not at all sure.

From what we've all been told by Mr. Benson, the flight is set to land in Cairo in another three days. From there, he says, it'll take a week or two to be able to arrive at the expedition site out in the desert. I wonder if my mind would be any calmer once we land than it is now.

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

# Sept. 23rd, 1964

Quite a bit of time has passed, uneventful. To my relief, I seemed to be able to sleep these past few nights with little to no difficulty at all because of this. In only a few more hours, we'll be landing. The only thing of note that's occurred since the last time I wrote was that I saw the disturbed young man from before having locked himself in the cabin restroom yesterday evening.

He didn't come out for hours and when he did, I noticed just how much more shaken he appeared than he had before. What must have occurred in the restroom in that time is anyone's guess, but if I could, I'd bet money that it and the restlessness from the other night are somehow connected. Since then, he's made no other kind of disturbance or had any sort of manic episodes, though, it is clear *something* troubles him deeply. What it is, I can only imagine...

\----

Something has gone very wrong. The Tri-Nexus crew is in a panic. They're trying to keep the peace among the expedition crew, but I doubt any of them are buying the facade that everything is under control.

I was both right and wrong about the young man. It's true he was disturbed and it's true that he'd been suffering *some* sort of mental illness, at least so it would appear. I was wrong, though to assume that his condition had subsided after the episode yesterday evening. Shortly after writing the earlier entry, I went to use the restroom myself, where I was met with a scene that sent chills down my back.

On the mirror was scrawled in large red letters a phrase that I'd never before heard or seen:

**"Adrayok aduae Jubbilex..."**

The words were smeared across the mirror, running down onto the sink. In the sink next to the drain, covered in red, was a small shard of glass from what looked to be a bottle of liquor. Looking down, I found the rest of the bottle smashed to pieces on the floor under the sink.

Once the initial shock of the situation wore off, realization quickly forced another wave of terror through me when I realized that this had to have been the young man's doing. He'd been the only one to use the restroom in the time that this'd been done -- something I knew from having used the restroom only an hour or so before myself and encountering no such scene -- and the bottle which had been smashed was of Greek *Ouzo.*

I stared for a moment again at the words themselves. Again, knowledge of what the words are, the dialect, what they mean, and/or what significance they had to the young man are details that're all but lost on me. Yet, in a morbid, surreal sort of way, I couldn't help but feel as though they were somehow... Somehow *familiar!*

It's impossible to explain, even to myself at this moment. There's so much I still don't know. But *something* about those words resonated with me in a manner that was primal. Like I somehow tapped into a dormant instinct when I attempted to sound the words out myself.

In another moment, I alerted Benson and two other Tri-Nexus advisors, informing them of the previous incidents involving the young man. Upon investigation, I saw Benson's face bleach white. The others turned away and did their best to not retch. I was told to quietly report back to my seat while they would question the young man.

When they attempted to apprehend him, however, they couldn't get him to move. When they tried to escort him from his seat, he fell over limply onto one of the representatives. His eyes were wide and glazed over. I saw them attempt first aid, believing he'd perhaps suffered a stroke or a minor heart attack, only to find that he'd actually bled out, revealed by the exposure of the vertical slashes that lined his wrists.

Unfortunately, this, of all things that'd happened before with the young man's ominous behavior, didn't go unnoticed. On seeing the man's severed wrists, one of the expedition crew members, a woman of middle age, cried out in fright, alerting the rest in a domino effect. Benson ordered everyone to remain calm, but it was another half an hour before the scene died down, and even then, I can plainly see that it's everything they can do to not erupt into yet another panic.

The young man's body has been moved to the storage cabin at the back of the plane. As far as I can tell at this time, we are set to proceed as originally intended, despite being down a man. The plane will be landing in Cairo in two and a half more hours.

It's getting to be nighttime again. The plane is silent, but I don't believe anyone can rest tight now, and excitement or ambition no longer has any role in it, either.

The past three days have been confusing in a way. A number of ways, perhaps. When we landed in Cairo, we were met by their diplomats. Their lead, a short stocky man by the name of Rasheed Mahaala, welcomed us and conferred with Benson while the rest of us unloaded our cargo from the plane. We were told to wait, though, to collect our things until after the young man's body was removed from the cargo hold.

During this time, I took it upon myself to ask a few of the others of the expedition crew if they had any clue as to what drove him to do what he did. I found that most of them, however, were none too keen on talking about him or the incident -- an understandable feeling. The ones that *were* willing to talk to me were none too knowledgeable themselves. From what I could gather, none of them knew who he was or had ever attempted to speak to him about anything, including the expedition itself.

By all accounts, at least, ironically, until his death, the young man was a ghost. I'd also asked if the strange words he'd scrawled on the restroom mirror were of any significance to them, if perhaps they'd know better of what it was and/or what it meant than I, but was met by the same skepticism. Once the body had been removed and loaded onto a truck, presumably to be carted back to Greece, we gathered out belongings and loaded onto the convoy that welcomed us for a drive through tour of the city.

I will say that it is a calming place, despite its stereotypes of being, essentially, a city-sized slum. We were directed to their nicest hotel to lodge for the night. I share a room with an archaeologist by the name of Lionel Ambrose. In some ways, I can't help but be reminded of Pvt. Elroy. He's a young man, and seems excitable and ambitious like Elroy was. Because of this, I've done my best to limit interactions with him, even if so much of what appears to interest him likewise interests me.

Tomorrow at 9:00 sharp, we set off to the burial site in the desert. I don't know how much of what happens will be recorded, but I'll do what I can when I can. I have to. For the story.

For Pvt. Elroy.

Its only after what I'd learned a little while prior that I continue to write today. In five days, nothing had happened. The brief tour and stay through Cairo was a pleasant enough one. The town itself was relatively quiet compared to what I was used to in the villages and towns back in Vietnam. Trader markets served as the primary focal point of the town's activity.

Today would mark the fifth day we'd spent traveling to the site of the pyramids. In this time, I decided to ask Ambrose what he believed the purpose of this expedition to be.  He answered that he had little, if only a vague clue as to what the Tri-Nexus' purpose for the expedition was. I tried my earlier theory with him that it was perhaps connected to the fabled pyramids of Giza, to which he replied that, though a possibility, was highly unlikely. According to him, "Unofficially" of course, he'd heard slip mention of something they referred to as "The Obelisk".

I asked him if he knew anything of this "Obelisk" beforehand, to which he replied that he hadn't. When I asked what his greatest guess was about it, Ambrose simply replied that he speculated it to be nothing more than a symbol or icon of worship that'd gone unnoticed by most scholars or philosophers. A simple enough explanation, but one I can't understand, at least not in its entirety. If it were only a lost fragment of worship, a tapestry of a long forgotten era, then why was it worth this much effort to seek it? What properties could it possess, what secrets could it really hold, that would make it such a feverish prize in the eyes of the Tri-Nexus Corp.?

It's late. I want to sleep, but this was too important to go unwritten. I have begun having visions as well.

Now, allow me to state for the record here that no, I'm *not* talking about nightmares. Not necessarily. Rather, simply a feverishly vivid dream of strange "people" -- a term I'm obviously using very lightly -- gathered in worship around a monument of stone. They all wore these deep red cloaks and shouted to the sky, holding aloft golden images that I couldn't make any of the details of as a lone figure ascended against the sun above even the pyramids.

Through all of this, though, one thing stood out to me. In their mass, I could hear them collectively call out in a strange tongue dangerously similar to the ones I'd heard on the plane. By this I mean that the phrases themselves were done in a growling tone, garbled and vicious as though I were listening to an animal trying to speak. From this, I discerned the damningly familiar phrase *"Adrayok aduae Jubbilex"*.

That's as far as my vision lasted. This occurred only an hour ago. I want to sleep, but questions regarding those words, that incantation, I suppose it were, are and why I'm seeing such visions has plagued me to such that sleep feels more and more out of the question. My question then is just how long until I, too, succumb to madness as had the man on the plane?
