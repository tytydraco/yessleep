I left the party that night with my heart pounding and my mind racing. I couldn’t shake the feeling of that voice, the icy touch on my arm, the way the shadows had seemed to come alive. I told myself it was just a trick of my imagination, the result of too many beers and too much adrenaline. But deep down, I knew something was wrong.

By the time I got home, it was nearly 2 a.m., and the apartment was eerily quiet. I tossed the keys on the counter and flicked on the light, half-expecting it to flicker like the ones at Mike’s house. It didn’t. Everything seemed normal, but that heavy feeling from the party lingered, like an invisible weight pressing down on my chest.

I tried to sleep, but every creak of the floorboards and groan of the pipes jolted me awake. At one point, I thought I heard a faint whisper, but when I sat up and strained my ears, there was only silence.

The next morning, I felt like a zombie, dragging myself to work with dark circles under my eyes and a gnawing sense of unease. By the time I got home, I was convinced I’d just freaked myself out. It was all in my head. That’s what I told myself over and over.

But the next night, it happened again.

I was sitting on the couch, scrolling mindlessly on my phone, when the temperature in the room seemed to drop. The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end, and the air felt… wrong.

Then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it.

A shadow. Not just any shadow—this one moved, slithering across the wall like it had a mind of its own. I froze, my breath catching in my throat, as it stretched and contorted, taking shape. It wasn’t a human figure, not exactly, but it had a face. Hollow eyes, a mouth twisted into an unnatural grin.

I scrambled to turn on the lights, but the second my hand touched the switch, the bulb burst, plunging the room into darkness.

“Jake,” the voice rasped again, low and drawn out, like it was savoring my name.

I spun around, clutching my phone like a lifeline, its flashlight barely cutting through the inky blackness. “Who’s there?” I demanded, my voice shaking.

The silence that followed was deafening.

And then, the whisper came again, closer this time.

“You shouldn’t have asked.”

I bolted for the door, yanking it open and stumbling into the hallway. My neighbor, Mrs. Sanchez, poked her head out of her door, startled. “Jake? Are you alright?”

I stared at her, chest heaving, my heart threatening to burst out of my chest. “Yeah, I—I’m fine. Just… thought I saw something.”

Her expression softened, and she nodded. “This building’s old. Lots of strange noises. Don’t let it get to you.”

I wanted to believe her. I really did. But when I stepped back inside, the room felt different—colder, darker, as if something was waiting for me.

Over the next few days, the incidents escalated. Doors creaked open on their own, shadows flitted across the walls, and that voice… it wouldn’t stop. It whispered to me at night, called my name from empty rooms, and repeated those same chilling words: You shouldn’t have asked.

I tried everything. Leaving the lights on, blasting music, even sleeping with the TV on. Nothing worked.

Last night was the worst. I woke up at 3:00 a.m. to the sound of footsteps. Slow, deliberate, like someone pacing back and forth in my living room.

Grabbing a baseball bat from under my bed, I crept toward the noise, my palms slick with sweat. The footsteps stopped as soon as I reached the living room, but the air was ice cold.

And then, I saw it again. The shadow. It loomed in the corner, larger than before, its twisted face leering at me.

“Who are you?” I shouted, gripping the bat so tightly my knuckles turned white. “What do you want from me?”

Its hollow eyes seemed to bore into my soul as it whispered, “You asked for me. Now I’m here.”

The shadow surged toward me, and everything went black.

I woke up this morning on the floor, the bat still in my hand. The sun streaming through the windows felt like a cruel joke, the light doing nothing to chase away the lingering darkness.

I don’t know what I brought back from that party, but it’s here now. And it’s not leaving.
