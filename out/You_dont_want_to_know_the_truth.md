There's been a lot of news lately about the UFO phenomenon. Apparently a whistleblower named David Grusch has come forward with some testimonies. Such as that we've recovered alien crafts and bodies.

There is a congress hearing on the 26th where witnesses will be able to speak. But I doubt we will get anything concrete.

There's been a lot of chatter on reddit and other forums. People say they want to know the truth. That it's been a long time coming.

Trust me. You don't.

I can't provide any evidence for my claims in this post, so take it as a warning. Please stop the constant digging for the truth. Because the truth will shock you to your very core.

I will start by telling you a little bit about me. A long time ago I worked for a special branch of the government. As it happens this is exactly the branch of government that mr. Grusch has referred to in his testimonies. My unit in particular was created to deal with the UFO phenomenon. We were separated into field agents and a team of analists that worked on location. I worked for five years in the field, later in the office.

I'm not proud of some of the things I have done for my government. From killing witnesses to burying evidence. This is why I will stay anonymous. But l me tell you, after I reveal the truth about the UFO phenomenon, you won't worry about what I've done or what the government has done.

The short version is that there are aliens. Yes, we've been visited. And yes, they actually look like little grey men with big heads. Some of them at least. Cliche, I know.

They've been visiting us for almost 70 years now, and probably longer. Our government is still figuring out how long exactly. But around 70 years ago they made contact with the U.S. Government for the first time. It was a big thing back then. There was even a meeting that took place between president Truman and an alien. However there was only a small amount of people in the government that knew about it, and the decision was quickly made that the truth was not to be revealed to the public.

At first they seemed good natured. They wanted to share technology with us in exchange for a few things in return. The promise of advanced technology was something the U.S. government couldn't resist, especially during the cold war.

In return for sharing their technology the aliens wanted to study us. Occasionally they would take a person up on a spaceship, they would study them and then return them to earth. They would wipe their memory so they wouldn't remember a thing.

After a while it became clear that the aliens didn't keep their promise. They did a little more than studying. They started interbreeding with us. They experimented on us. And then there were some people that just disappeared. Some people that did return went insane. Or they got sick from being in contact with the aliens. Or they were injected with weird substances that were later discovered in their body during medical examinations.

We also found out that the technology designs the aliens shared with us was very flawed. First we thought it was our engineers making the mistakes. When they tried to reverse engineer spaceships they would always crash. At some point we connected the dots realized we had been fed false information.

Things became only more unnerving after that. We found out at some point that the grey aliens were just a slave species sent by a more sinister, evil reptilian species. They also visited from time to time but they mostly sent the greys to do their bidding.

We thought that they were perhaps manipulating us so that they could take the natural resources of our planet. And in a way that was true. Except they are not interested in gold, silver or oil. They are interested in us. We are the resource.

They are here to farm us. We are like cattle to them. They are here to experiment on us, drain our blood, and slaughter us when they decide it's time to eat. They do this under the radar, and with a limited amount of people so that we won't notice.

600.000 people go missing in the U.S. alone each year. Have you ever wondered what happens to them?

The aliens have underground facilities. They keep people there. These people will never see the light of day again. They are trapped down there, at the mercy of these horrible creatures. They are force fed and injected with certain drugs to keep them calm and obedient. And to prepare them for slaughter.

The government knows about all of this but they are powerless. The aliens are technologically superior in every way. They could wipe us all out with a flick of a switch. But they don't, because they have found another use for us.

The only thing the government can do about all this is keep the truth from coming out so the people won't panic. They put me and my unit specifically in charge of this. For this we have killed people and worse. But I always believed it was necessary.

Hopefully this will serve as a warning for those hell-bent on getting to the bottom of things. Please, stop digging any further. The general public is better off not knowing.
