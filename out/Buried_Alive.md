I don’t know how long I was out before I woke up, but when I did, everything was black and tight and… wrong. My chest hurt when I tried to breathe. My head slammed against wood just inches above me. I clawed at the lid until splinters drove into my palms, but it didn’t matter—I wasn’t strong enough.

At first, I thought it was a dream. But then I realized I could smell it. That sickly sweet smell of flowers and dirt, heavy and close. My tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth. I screamed until my throat ripped raw, but no one could hear me.

I don’t remember dying. I remember the hospital, the beeping of the machines slowing, people crying… then nothing. I guess they must have thought I was gone.

Time passed—I don’t know how much—and then it happened. The coffin shifted. The bottom cracked. Suddenly I was falling.

I braced for dirt, for crushing weight, but there was nothing. Just endless falling, like the ground itself had opened up beneath me. And then the heat hit.

The air is thick here, choking. I landed on jagged rock that burned even through my clothes. When I stood, I wasn’t in a graveyard anymore. The sky is red and split with fire. There are screams all around me, echoing from places I can’t see. Shapes move in the smoke, twisted, stretched, not human anymore.

I shouldn’t be able to post this. I don’t even know what I’m holding—it feels like bones, strung together like wires—but when I touch them, words appear here. Like something wants me to write this down.

I don’t think I was buried alive. I think I was put where I was always meant to go.

If anyone reads this—please tell my family I didn’t make it to heaven.
