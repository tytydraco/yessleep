I experienced this in 2016, along with my older sister and girlfriend. It happened during the school holidays as we took a trip to my grandparents farm, it was one of the places that we loved going to. 

One morning, after having breakfast, my father informed my sister and I to go make a stop at another farmer's farm. He told us that we were to deliver a few farm tools to him that my grandad had supposedly borrowed. My sister perked up when she heard that we could take the car, since the farm was like a few kilometers away. My sister and I decided to let my girlfriend tag along, since she still didn't know my family very well. I can't really blame her for that. 

As we were driving along the gravel road, we joked, talked about small things and other crazy bullshit until we reached a road that had trees on either side of the road. The trees grew in such a way that they blocked the sun ray's from reaching the gravel road, so we were basically driving under a large shade. I want to let you all know that I'm very familiar with this part of the road and I've driven through it many times before and nothing ever strange happened. 

But on this peculiar day, something was off. The birds that usually sang were quiet, even the wind seemed to be silenced as we drove. By now we were all quiet and just listening to the gravel beneath the tires of the car. We passed a large tree that had a white mark on it's bark and I dismissed it as I have seen it many times before, after a few moments I realized that something was not right.  

I checked the time on the radio and it read 14:07, my eyes immediately went wide at this. We left our farm at 12:30 and it never took us this long to reach our neighbour, I was a little confused by this. Then my girlfriend said something from the back seat that confused me even more. 

"Guys, didn't we pass this tree like five minutes ago?". She said. 

I looked up just in time to see us passing the same large tree with the same white mark on it's bark, I knew something wasn't right and I immediately looked at my sister and she had a frown on her face that I couldn't exactly interpret. 

"What the fuck". I said out loud. 

We drove a little more and we passed the same tree every time, until my sister got mad and came to a stop just a few feet away from the same tree. We got out and were met with deafening silence, my girlfriend got spooked and got closer to me and I put an arm around her. 

"Okay. What the fuck is going on?". My sister asked after pacing for like a minute. 

"I don't know. We should have been at the man's farm by now". I said. 

"We drove past this tree like five fucking times". My girlfriend said, a little pissed off. 

I'm no strange to the paranormal. I've had weird experiences before but never at this scale, I was freaked out to say the least. As we got into the car again, we saw a red pick up truck drive slowly past us, my sister immediately started the car and closely followed  the red pick up. We drove through the wooded area just a few feet behind the pick up truck and after moments we realized that the environment started to change, I sighed in relief as I saw the dam that was on the right side of the road. 

We were all glad we got out of there safely. I didn't know if this was a loop or a glitch but it was definitely paranormal. I know it sounds unreal but I know what I experienced that day.

We got home safely without any incident but we never told our family what happened or anyone we knew for that matter. We have heard stories of that area of the road being haunted but I never believed the stories. After experiencing this, I can safely say that my point of view has been changed.
