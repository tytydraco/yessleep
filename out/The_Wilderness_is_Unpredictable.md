 

Ma always told me to never go past the tree line that surrounded our small plot of land.

“The wilderness is unpredictable,” Ma had stated one late afternoon. She flicked the ash from her cigarette and gestured towards the window with her chin. “The bears are active this time of year, preparing for the winter.”

“Give your Ma a hand and bring in some more firewood,” Begrudgingly I pulled my rain boots on and straightened up with a huff. “Keep it up with that attitude, boy, and I’ll have you scrub off Pa’s boots!” Ma’s voice dampened as the door closed behind me.

My face looked disgusted. Pa is out in the marsh checking his traps. The water and mud smells of the dead and rotten plants. I shuddered when I remembered the last time, I scrubbed Pa’s boots. The hot water enhanced the smell. Ma had to scrub and soak my shirt and pants for two days in order to rid them of the smell.

Colorful leaves gently floated down as a powerful gust of wind whipped through the forest. The song of Chickadees and Mourning Dove accompanied me as I rounded the house to the back shed. My boots squelched in the thick mud as I neared the stack of split logs that were stacked neatly next to the shed. The tips of my fingers were bright red as I struggled to stack three logs in my arms. They hit the ground with a thud and bounced off each other.

I groaned as I looked down at the now mud-covered logs. The logs wouldn't burn anymore. I picked them up one by one and stacked them next to the heap of dry ones. I then carefully grabbed three more and smiled proudly when I finally balanced them without trouble.

Carefully, I walked down the mud trail back to the house, but stopped as another powerful gust of wind whipped my hair around. I squeezed my eyes closed to avoid any hair strands getting in my eyes. Among the tree branches creaking and groaning under the pressure of the wind, I heard a twig snap off to my right. My first instinct was to keep my eyes closed. The rustle of the underbrush followed the snap.

“*Pssst.”*

The hair on my neck stood up and my back tensed. I can faintly hear panting.

*“Pssst.”*

The sound was closer this time. My breathing slowed down drastically and my grip on the firewood tightened as I hugged them closer to my chest. My back and legs muscles stung from the tension. I held my breath as I felt a hot breath hit the right side of my face.

*“Help me!”* The thing screamed. In an instant, I dropped the firewood and sprinted back to the house. I let out a shrill scream when I heard the thing run after me. The ground vibrated underneath the thing’s weight.

My heart sank when the thick mud had an iron-like grip on my boot. Everything happened so fast. The tree line in front of me was a blur as I fell forward. Pain shot throughout my face, and I let out a gasp as the fall knocked the air out of my lungs. The thing behind didn’t react and still charged forward. I curled up on my side and finally had the courage or morbid curiosity to look back. I let out a whimper.

The thing that barreled towards me was something I had never seen before. It looked like a deformed deer, its legs bent backwards. Its face contorted and somewhat had a human-like resemblance. Its reddish-gray skin seemed like they stretched it over its skeleton. It had patches of light brown fur jutting out from underneath its skin, as if it turned its skin inside out. 

After what seemed like minutes, my lungs finally took in a gulp of air. I got on my hands and knees and started to crawl. But my arms gave out and my face once again met the cold mud. I let out one more scream for my Ma as the thing pounced on me.

I let out a grunt from the sudden weight. Pain shot through my right shoulder as if it poked me with a fire iron. The thing sunk its teeth into my flesh and shook its head like a dog. My throat hurt from the screaming. My fingers sunk into the cold mud.

Is this how I’m going to die?

I didn’t even get to say I love you to Ma and Pa.

A loud bang rang out through the air. The creature let out a shriek. I was too tired and cold to even look up. I didn’t even notice as someone scooped me up and placed me in the back of Pa’s pickup.

I remembered waking up to the sounds of beeping and bright lights. I wasn’t able to move without my right shoulder throb with pain. It even hurts to try to talk. I looked over to see Ma and Pa, they both shot up. Their hands gently touched my face and brushed my hair out of my face. Both of them had puffy, bloodshot eyes. Ma choked out a sob as she placed her head on the back of my hand.

I had to get 200 stitches in my right shoulder and suffered from a broken nose. Pa told the police that a young bear mauled me, so I also had to get shots just in case. I asked Pa why he lied to the police. He told me that no one would believe him if he told them the truth. Or they’ll convince him that it was a bear.

I don’t know what attacked me, but sometimes I can hear my voice scream out in the middle of the night when Ma and Pa are asleep.
