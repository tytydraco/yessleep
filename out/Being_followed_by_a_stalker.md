I need advice on a situation and whether I’m in danger rn. This might not be the right sub to ask whether I need like an exorcist or something but I don't think I would be able to get one anytime soon so I just want to not have to keep this to myself.

What happened was that I (22M) was on a family trip to New Hampshire to visit my divorced aunt (47F) and uncle (49M) and cousins (one is 27M, the other 11M). They have two cars, one of which belongs to aunt and the other to older cousin. Aunt is a reasonably safety-minded person who has seatbelts in her car whereas older cousin is a New Hampshire style libertarian with a hiccup about seatbelts, nice person otherwise though, not MAGA or anything.

Basically, one person had to go pick up younger cousin and the other go get groceries. Aunt doesn't let the kid go in the car without a seatbelt, so the older cousin was going to take groceries and she was going to pick up the kid. Problem was that 27M cousin was having a migraine and couldn't drive, so I offered to run groceries for him.

I had to miss one of the things that uncle had planned because I got lost on the way there, and both me and aunt would have preferred if my Mom (56F) or Dad (51M) grabbed the groceries, but my parents always disappear on these trips. They’ve liked to dump me on my aunt since I was little and we had no clue why. The one time I managed to track one of them down before we were leaving, Dad was despondent and I suspect a bit drunk. He’s never like that back home, but it definitely means he couldn't do either car-related task safely. Aunt knew about this from me and we both thought Mom might be getting tired and emotional too.

So, when I was driving in the freedom car, something went really wrong. I can't remember what it was, and I haven't been able to remember a lot of things that well recently, but I remember my heart going up, my head muscles tensing, and there being a white blur out the window. I think I went through it when I went out the window.

After that I don't remember any pain. I remember a feeling of weightlessness, and a wood smell. Then I had a feeling of being dragged by the foot, but it was like my foot was far away behind me. The temperature went between being hot and cold a few times before I started to see again.

I was in a bed in an ambulance. I didn't feel any soreness anywhere and the EMTs weren't telling me not to, so I sat up. There was an old man in the car (or room? I don't know the proper term for the inside of an ambulance,) who didn't look like he was one of them. Then I noticed that my proprioception wasn't lining up with my vision, and realized that I was sitting on top of my own body.

Though I felt like I had sat up and could move, I couldn't see anything where it felt like my hands were, and waving my invisible ghost hands at the EMTs didn't get their attention. This was when the scraggly old man started talking.

He told me, “That doesn't work. We can't do that most of the time.”

This is when I started to think that I was dead and not just having a hallucination or weird dream. Not one of the EMTs looked at him when he talked and it really creeped me out.

At this point I had caught up enough with my surroundings to take note of what he looked like. Dirty blond, like me, poorly-kept beard, male pattern baldness. I think he was seventy at most, and how messy he looked is probably making me overestimate. He had an accent that I think is either French Canadian or Russian (yep that's kind of broad, I’m not amazing at telling different accents apart) and had a lisp where he couldn't make a “th” sound.

I didn't say anything else to him, but he went on to tell me “I’ve been with you since you were very little,” and “It's well past time you caught up with me.” I told him I didn't want anything to do with him and he started shouting, but I couldn't catch anything with his thick accent. After a few minutes he calmed down. He’d periodically say “thirty bucks” (or at least that's what I heard) for the rest of the time I was aware during the ride, but didn't look at me.

Then I woke up in the hospital. I don't remember being taken from the ambulance to the hospital room, so I think that they stabilized me before then. The old man in the ambulance was gone, and the doctors told me I was in cardiac arrest when the EMTs found me. I would be bed bound for some time while my ribs and sternum healed, and possibly need occupational therapy after that due to nerve damage from lack of oxygen.

My parents showed up to visit me. Dad was slurring really badly, but Mom wasn't, so I decided to talk to her on her own. I didn't think I’d get much useful from her if I asked about a weird man in the ambulance talking to me, so I asked if she knew anyone who talked like him, with the accent and the lisp and vocal tic. I largely expected her to know nothing, but instead she got really defensive and insisted that no such person existed. I didn't tell her anything about how I met him, so I don't know why she'd have any reason to think that. I tried asking Dad next, and he got very solemn (more solemn than I thought someone that shit-faced could be) and told me that the two of them vowed to never speak of that man and refused to elaborate.

This has got me really worried. I haven't seen the strange man since, and mom and dad aren't talking to me, so it's just my aunt and the hospital staff. What I saw might be funkiness from the cardiac arrest, and this lingering paranoia might be the same or from isolation or the lack of sleep I’ve had. The staff tell me that getting sleep will help me heal faster, but I just can't. I hear this clacking sound down the hallway at night and it keeps me up. I'm too nervous to ask anyone else if they hear it. It sounds like hard plastic on tile.

It sounds like he's pacing.
