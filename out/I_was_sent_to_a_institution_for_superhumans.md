In my relatively short life, I’ve come to find out the true meaning of “special”. In our society, someone who is “special” is really just someone who can do something slightly better than others. Anyone could paint the Mona Lisa if they had enough practice. Anyone could run 100 meters in 10 seconds if they had enough determination. Everyone’s capable of doing everything and anything, some can just do it on a better level. But I’ve learned that “special” really means that you’re capable of things that no human can do. That is what I am, and I am one of many. Although they don’t call us “special”, or “super”, or even “atypical”. They call us Deviants. 

Nobody knows quite how it began, but across the country, people started to exhibit superhuman abilities at random points in their life. Keep in mind, these abilities are very diverse and can be extremely unpredictable. But it didn’t matter how dangerous your ability was, if you were a Deviant, you’d be taken by…*them*. 

Like many others before me, my ability wasn’t unlocked until later in life. It was an accident, and my 10 year old brain could barely comprehend the situation. I was out with my parents until they decided they wanted to go antique shopping, a weird hobby they liked to do together, and stopped by this quaint store that had to have been at least 60 years old. It was only filled with a few people, so it added to the peaceful scenery. The owner went on and on about a certain vase that was priceless and irreplaceable, and I took that to heart. He turned around for only a split second, which was all the time that my dad needed to accidentally elbow said vase off the table. I really didn’t want it to break, so I stretched out my hand to catch it. Though it was too far away, I thought about how much I didn’t want it to touch the floor. You can imagine my surprise when it didn’t. It floated in the air for a few seconds, in full view of my stunned parents. My father quickly grabbed the vase, put it back in its original spot, and grabbed my arm as we hurried home. I was questioned the whole night about how I was able to do something like that, but I couldn’t give an answer. 

The next morning, my parents found themselves greeting a pair of strange men. They wore pale suits, one had his hair slicked back and the other completely bald. I was told to go up to my room, but I knew they were talking about me. I was spying from the top of the stairs, crawling on all fours to listen in on what these men wanted with my parents. 

They explained that they were from the Deviant Correctional Institution, and that I was being chosen for a “special” program, one that identifies abnormal abilities and helps control them.  They were anonymously informed of my abilities and after researching us for a relatively short time, they wanted to meet in person. Whatever my future was going to be, it didn’t seem like I had a choice in the matter. 

The program -at least how the DCI explained it- would carry out as follows: I would spend the next 8 years in a facility with people just like me, learning to control the extent of my ability, and would be released when I turn 18. There would be no contact with the outside world, my parents were only allowed 3 phone calls a year. They stressed this to rule to “maintain the utmost discretion” of their work. 

Not even a week later, I was stepping out of a long black car, staring at the outside of a large, simple looking complex with a main building in the center, about 2 stories tall. Next to me, as I was taking it all in, was a man by the name of Agent Green. I don’t know if that was his real name, but that’s what everyone called him. No first name, or anything close to a nickname. He’s the one who showed me around, and tried to make the facility seem more like a hotel than a correctional institution. 

“I know it seems pretty scary, but it’s all for the best, I promise. There’s lots of kids here your age, I’m sure you’ll feel at home in no time.” He always said that, and at the time believed him. 

I can’t really remember too much of the first few days, it just seemed like hours of introductions and orientations and tours. Whatever information they were willing to spew out just to make me feel comfortable, it barely made any sense. I will admit, everyone was very nice. The people watching over us were called the DA’s (Deviant Associates). They taught reading and writing, we had really good lunch, and we got to learn more about our powers. It was like being a part of really expensive private school. It actually felt kind of cool, like being in an X-Men movie.

There are a few things I will never forget, not as long as I live. The first being how many kids there were. They were all 10-18 years old, and apparently we were all separated by age, like high school. Three different tiers, I assumed it was so that we could always be with those closer in age. I could not have been more wrong. 

The second thing that will fail to escape my memories is the inhibitor wristband - or a “zapper”, as the other kids call it- they put on us. It was small, and tight around our arm, but never came off under any circumstances. The way they explained is still lost to me to this day, but it basically sends certain shock waves to our nervous system that dulls our powers. According to the DCI, this would ensure safety if any one of us should “lose control”. 

The third thing that has stuck with me for all these years are my friends who spent this time alongside me. All the kids my age were given a recess every day after lunch, and the D.A.’s lowered the settings on our wristbands just enough for us to lightly use our powers so we could at least have some fun. I sat in the sandbox alone, trying to lift my toy cars as high as I could. When I managed to get it a few inches off the ground, my concentration was broken by a loud, enthusiastic voice. 

“Woah, you’re a TK?”

I looked up to see a girl with long, curly brown hair and bright green eyes. She seemed too amazed to explain her confusing question. 

“A…TK? What’s a TK?” 

“It’s short for Telekinetic. You know, someone who can move things with their mind? T for tele-, and K for kinetic..get it?”

“Oh right, that makes sense. Then yeah, I guess that’s what I am. I’m a TK.”

“That’s so cool! We rarely get any TK’s, especially in our tier. I’m Ellie.” 

“I’m Mark. Also I’ve heard about different tiers, what’s all that about?”

Ellie took a seat right next to me, maybe a bit closer than I was expecting. “Well, we’re all separated into three tiers. Tier 1 is us, ages 10-12. We learn the basics of our powers, and we get to use them a bit too. When you turn 13, you move down to Tier 2. I’m not really sure what you learn there but it’s definitely more intense. Then when you turn 16, you move on to Tier 3: the last one before graduating. My brother Caleb is here too. We came at the same time, but he’s in Tier 3.”

“Wait, so everyone doesn’t start at the same age?”

“No, some kids don’t discover their powers until later. My brother was 16, so went straight to 3. I barely see him, but he looks so sad…almost every time. I think it’s because he misses his friends, but I’m sure he’s made some new ones.” Her focus shifted downwards, fiddling with her fingers. She seemed afraid of her next words, “Do..um-do you wanna…be friends?”

“Sure, yeah! I don’t really have any here. What’s your power?”

Ellie’s face lightened up with an excitement that would be lost to me in the years to come, I often think back and miss it. “Ok what’s one thing you want right now, more than anything?”

I tried thinking, but the beaming hot sun stumped me in my attempt. Luckily, that put the perfect idea in my head. 

“I really want a vanilla ice cream, that’d hit the spot right about now.”

Ellie held out her hands together, cupping the air. I could see her squinting and her fingers slightly shaking, like she was trying to squeeze something that wasn’t even there. Before I could ask what exactly she was doing, I saw something like little crystals forming from thin air. More and more they circled around each other until it materialized into none other than the ice cream I craved so badly. 

“Woah, you can just make stuff out of nowhere?”

She handed me the cone, “Yup, try it!”

I took it from her, and without hesitation I stuck my tongue out for a taste. But as soon as I made contact, the whole dissipated in less than a second. I saw Ellie’s face drop to one of embarrassment. 

“Sorry, I can only really do small things. Food’s pretty hard for me to do.”

“No, I think that’s really awesome! You’re like the coolest kid here!”

“Ooh! Ellie’s got a *boyfriend*!” I hear a crass taunt from across the playground. A scrappy boy with long blond hair zooms up to us, literally. One second, he was at least 30 feet away, and the next he was standing right next to us like he was there the whole time. Judging by the distance, as well as him dusting off his feet, I deduced he has super speed. 

“Shut up Seth, or I’ll make some duct tape and shut it for you!”

“Yeah, right! You’ll have to catch me first!”

Ellie crossed her arms and huffed. The blond kid looked at me with a smile that displayed a missing tooth. “You’re a TK, right? Not a lot of those come at your age, you’re pretty lucky. Hey, wanna see me run to the basketball hoop and back?” I felt a short gust of wind. “Wanna see me do it again?”

As much of a show off Seth was, he did have a really cool power. It was like being friends with Quicksilver. I told them all about how I found out about my powers, and they reciprocated with their own stories. For so long, Ellie really wanted this small but expensive doll, and when her parents couldn’t get it, she put her hands together and begged for it until it appeared in her hands right before their eyes. Seth was put in sports, and it didn’t take long for his parents to realize that he was crossing the entire field in only a few seconds. 

Seth shifted his gaze to Ellie. “Hey, your brother’s in Tier 3 right?” She nodded. “Well, I heard from Dennis Walker that he’s like super depressed. Something about the DA’s making him do the same thing day in and day out.”

“What? Caleb is the nicest, happiest guy ever. What could be making him depressed?”

“I dunno, but Dennis is in Tier 2. He knows a lot of stuff that happens in there. In fact, he’s been acting pretty weird too.”

“Yeah, I know that, but how could he-

Our conversation was interrupted by a piercing scream, followed by the sound of glass being shattered. After a few seconds, we all collectively saw a body fall from the second floor, like it was pushed. The surrounding DA’s tried to shield us from the sight, but it was too late. The body was burned all over, its skin and bones charred beyond recognition. There was no way to tell if it was a woman or a man, but they were definitely dead. 

Shortly after, a large fireball leaped from the broken window and slammed on the ground. We watched as the fire twisted and squirmed out of control. It only took a few seconds until the flames calmed down to reveal another kid, probably a little bit older than us in Tier 1. He was breathing sparingly, his hands were trembling, and his eyes were twitching. I hear Seth mumble, more out of disappointment than fear, “Dennis..?”

I felt Ellie grab my hand, I couldn’t tell if the shaking was from her or myself. I could barely hear myself think, as all the other kids in the yard backed away from him.

I saw Agent Green, one of the DA’s in the yard supervising us, strategically inching closer toward the teenager surrounded by fire.

“Dennis, was this you? Did you do this?” His voice was calm and even empathetic, like he was talking to a child who accidentally broke a vase because they were playing too rough. 

Dennis answered back, his eyes refusing to move away from his hands. “Yes, I did. I mean, of course I did. Who else can shoot fire from their hands? Who else can control it like me? Nobody in the world, probably. Yeah, I could be the strongest one, or maybe just the only one. I did that, I mean I *really* did that.” His sentences were fast, staggering over every word. It was like he was unsure if he was talking to us or to himself. 

“Dennis, how about we just go inside and-“

“No, no, no, no! Stay away from me! I know what you all do here. You pretend to be nice, and encourage us to ‘find ourselves’ when it’s all just a lie. I know what happens in Tier 3, I’m supposed to transfer in few days. But I’m not gonna spend my birthday locked up like some animal! So yeah, I hijacked my zapper, burned Agent Sydney to a crisp. And I won’t lie, I kinda liked it. She never liked me. The things she said to me, I think she deserved it.”

“Son, you’re not well. We can help, we just want to help you.”

“Don’t call me son like you’re my family!” Tears flooded his eyes as his voice started cracking. “My family. I can’t believe you all kept me from my family for 5 years. I’m not going back, you can’t make me. Not after-“

Dennis was cut off by a whirring sound, his wristband shot volts around and inside his body. It looked so visceral, that I could see the veins in his arms and neck glowing a bright blue for a few seconds. Sure enough, the reaction had his eyes rolling back before he collapsed. Several DA’s crowded around him to make sure he was down, and others rushed us all back inside, refusing to answer  any of the thousands questions being hurled at them. Dennis knew something, I wish I could’ve asked him, but after that day, I never saw him again. 

A few hours later, I was sitting in my small but comfortable room. I only saw bodies like that in video games or TV, but it was a whole different experience to see it only a few feet away from my feet. I could still see the skin burned to a shade of burgundy, and the smell of smoke latched onto me. I relived the moment over and over a thousand times until a soft knock pulled me from my trance. It was Agent Green. 

“Hey, kid. Just checking on everyone, I know we’re all a bit shaken after what happened today.” 

I gave silence as my response. What could I say? That I was traumatized by seeing a murder in a place that’s supposed to keep me safe? I couldn’t articulate that, not at the time. 

Agent Green kept his tall, stiff composure. “I’m sure Dennis was nice, but he was also sick. He wasn’t thinking the way we taught him. There was no hope for him, but there still is for you. You understand that, right?”

All I could do was nod. I had no idea how to disagree, or voice my own opinion. I was too young to think otherwise. The sound of my heartbeat found its way into my ears as Agent Green exited my room, what he said still chills my skin to this day. 

“There’s a place for you here, and you have a purpose. You are safe here.”

I didn’t believe him.
