This is coming from a very deep part of my psyche. Trauma that has reappeared is the best way I can explain it. I don't think of myself as tragic, so to someone who has experienced more severe trauma, this might seem more like complaining. I'm only speaking out about this because I saw her again and I'm afraid that the same shit will happen again. I'll go into more detail about what recently happened to me later, but first I need to set the stage for you.

At my new school, I was in my senior year. I say "new" since I had to change schools after moving. For the record, I only relocated a town away, and that was in my senior year. To be honest, fuck the principal of my former school. In any case, I didn't know many people at the new school; in fact, the only people I knew were essentially distant relatives or cousins of those I knew at my previous school. Sorry, but I'm going to be very vague about names because I know how people can get about tracking down locations or people.

Anyway, I was a stranger at this school, and being the new kid is not how the media portrays it. That shit is awful. No one tries to talk to you unless they are compelled to by their teachers or whatever. I'm not going to sit here and claim I was a loser; I had just a handful of friends, but you caught my ass in the hallway at lunch break is all I'm going to say. Since I was just a town away—literally a few miles—and I was driving at the time, I was still able to stay in touch with my old school pals (thank God). 

To put it mildly, one of the students at my former school was a trend-rider, or as the 2010s used to say, a Hype beast. He was generally self-aware, thus he wasn't as annoying as other members of that group would be. Why am I telling you this? Well, being a Hype beast earned you the supplementary title of fuckboy, or, in layman's terms, womanizer. He possessed not just the appearance but also the disposition of a fuckboy. You should've seen this guy's Snapchat threads. Yes, interacting with a lot of girls on Snapchat when in high school was a sign that you were a fuckboy. Now stick with me.

You must be wondering, "Where the fuck is this going?" at this point. I know it's a lot of disposition dumping, and you're probably screaming for me to tell the story already. I'm just asking you to put up with me for a little while longer. There will be narrative components in this post, I assure you. One advantage of having a fuckboy as a friend is that he will occasionally introduce you to a girl who is seeking something a little more than what a fuckboy can provide. Now imagine yourself in a high school boy's filthy, cocky shoes. When your boy is putting you on, what is the first thing you ask him? "Is she bad?" The desire for a socially desirable girlfriend, regardless of one's own appearance or shortcomings, is a sign of a high school student's inflated ego. This was much beyond confidence at this time; it was textbook delusion; and no matter how hard I try to convince you that I was unique, I was no different from other high school lads. 

The story then ultimately begins with the famous query, "Is she bad?"

	

I hurriedly type to my friend before dropping my phone and returning my focus to my PS4, which was loading the digital mayhem of GTA 5. I didn't anticipate anything to come of the chat. Every time he claimed to have fruit to share, this guy never delivered. It was usually a girl who wanted to confess to him through someone else. I wasn't tryna to play middle man for the hundredth time. My phone vibrated quickly, prompting me to look at the screen. His only answer was, "Yea bro," but then I received another message that caught my attention. "She's from your new school." Now we're talking about something. "Word?" I type in return. Finishing that heist in GTA has suddenly entered the back of my thoughts. I clicked on the Instagram link he forwarded to me. 

"She’s pretty," I mutter under my breath. 

Pretty was an understatement; this girl could have been a model. I exited the app and retried the link to ensure I had the correct account. It was unbelievable to me that my boy was referring to this piece of art. Fuck. He must be fucking with me. I grit my teeth, determined not to give this prick any more of my time. I was ready to dismiss the app until I spotted my school's name and the year she will graduate, a year after me. My eyes widened as I noticed the modest number of followers, which, along with the few postings with a few dozen likes, nearly caused me to cry with delight. This dude sent me a diamond.

I goofily cheesed at the photo of her and her mother on Mother's Day. She smiled like her mother, or at least I believed she did. Flawless white teeth framed by rose-colored lips. But, having been traumatized by my cousins calling my smile unpleasant, I could recognize a phony smile from a mile away. I didn't dig too deeply into it; everyone has their own skeletons. Who am I to pass judgment? All I cared about was her fine self and my chances with her.  

"She said she knows you," is the final text I read from my boy.

"From where?" I texted back, curiously.

"Your school."

"I don’t talk to anyone much there, does she have a class with me?" I questioned. I racked my head, trying to figure out who he was talking about.

"She didn’t say but I gave her your snap, if that’s cool."

"You ask after the fact, bruh?"

The shrug emoji marked the end of our talk. I waited on Snap for this girl to add me, but she never did. By midnight, I had already forgotten about it, so I made the decision to bid the PSN party farewell and head out for the evening. I'm in bed, perusing through Instagram while waiting for the arms of slumber to rock me into unconsciousness. I look at the notification as my phone buzzes in my hand. It was Snapchat: "Ang had added you," I read. Wow, it only took a few hours.

I wasn't in the mood to talk to this girl, especially because it took her hours to add someone on Snapchat. I text her in spite of my better judgment. "Yo," I say, praying this conversation does not go to another dead end. Not even five seconds later, she responded with "hiii:)". I'm so in there. As much as I wanted to talk to her, I was exhausted and had school tomorrow, and I didn't want to appear desperate, so I texted her that I was going to bed and would talk to her tomorrow. She responded by leaving me on read. Being left on read these days was a death sentence, so frustration had already started to set in. I inhaled deeply and tried to relax. What was she meant to respond with, then? I put my phone on the charger, laid onto my side, and fell asleep.

The next day proceeded just as it typically did at my new school. I was texting my friends all day long. I was a senior at a new school; I didn't care about my classes, and neither did my teachers. The amount of time I spent watching student news for a class should be criminal. God, I detested Carl Azuz's grating grin and, let's not even talk about his voice. I suppose it was better than doing actual work. As if I had listened at all. I was too preoccupied with browsing my phone. During that year, my iPhone 8 reached platinum numbers. If I set my phone in Low Power mode and charged it the night before, I would have enough battery life for the day. When lunchtime eventually came, I, you guessed it, spent the time texting my buddies and browsing through my phone. At that moment, I received an odd text from my friend; I glanced up at the photo of me from the back after reading the caption, "is this you?" I have no idea when it was taken, but it was obviously taken during the block transition.

Despite the fact that the caption was a meme, the image seemed strangely menacing. The photograph was shot barely a few steps away from me; the photographer could have reached out and touched my bookbag if they chose. I can't figure out how to interpret the picture. I knew my boy didn't attend my new school, so how the hell did he obtain this picture? I was wearing the exact same clothes in the photo, so it wasn't an old one. I anxiously reply, "yea tf lol who took that?" eager to find out where the picture came from.  

"Yo girl took it lol she said she saw you today," he answers back.

"You talking about Ang?" 

"Yuh why didn’t you tell me y’all talked already?"

"We didn’t…She told you we spoke?"

What a strange fucking picture, especially given that she lied about us chatting. I completely forgot to text her in the morning in the first place, and she sent that photo to my friend with no context other than "we talked". 

"When did she send you that?" I ask.

"She snapped me like 20 minutes ago."

She sent it through Snapchat? That picture was sent without a caption in the app, which is even more bizarre. What a fucking weirdo.  

"She got my snap so it’s kinda weird she’s still snapping you about me," I type out in haste. 

"She’s prob still shy."

Shy? Nothing on her Instagram would even suggest that she is a shy person. It wasn't like she was posting porn, but she wasn't exactly dressed as a 1600s Puritan either. The last quality I thought she possessed was timidity. To me, shyness means avoiding eye contact or speaking quietly; she dead ass just took a creepy photo.  I didn't text my friend back to call out the nonsense because I got a Snapchat notification from Ang. I noticed that she had sent me a picture when I tapped on the notification. It was the exact snapshot my friend had just sent me. The pathetic attempt to strike up a conversation is met with a roll of my eyes. I reply with "yea my boy just sent me that lol when did you take that?" I wanted to know why and when she took that picture.  

She left me on delivered for the rest of the day, and by the time I returned home, she had gone into the background of my thoughts. Around ten o'clock at night, she sent me another Snap, reminding me of her as I was getting ready for bed. When I opened it, a black screen appeared. Streaks? Really? Was she merely looking for someone to do streaks with? When someone wished to do streaks, they would typically send a dark screen with a red "S" painted on it or the caption, "streaks?" What threw me off was the fact that this image included neither. 

I snapped her back with the standard black screen and  red "S". Streaks between the opposite gender usually lead to something else; at the very least, they get you in the door. It provided a reason to speak with someone every day. As I lay down to sleep, I remembered she hadn't responded to my question. 

The following day passed more quickly than usual. The fact that my friend didn't text me another eerie picture of myself irritated me a little. Even though it was strange, it gave me hope that this girl was at least considering me. She was a bad as hell, one-in-a-million kind of girl, after all. I refuse to allow a little strangeness get in the way of this. I shouldn't be shaming this chick; I've seen and experienced stranger things. Perhaps my boy was right about her shyness, so I sent her a selfie to start the discussion in the hopes that she would feel more at ease talking to me. I even wrote her a message that said, "I hope your day is going good:)". It was a half-court shot, but it at least sparked a conversation about her day. Girls enjoy sharing their day with others. In essence, this is a shoe-in. 

I didn't receive a response till midnight. This chick is a true night owl, huh? Does she even get up until nighttime? It was a joke that made me laugh, but it also sparked my interest. It dawns on me that I haven't actually seen this girl at school yet. I understand that she is in a lower grade than me, but I still expect to run into her at least once. Instead of seeing streaks when I opened the snap, I saw myself. Another picture of me today, taken from the rear in another part of the school. That trophy cabinet, which was next to my physics class, is something I recognize. This is on the way to lunch. I'll admit that I was irritated earlier that I didn't get another spooky picture, but when I did, it gave me the chills. Why couldn't she just come and say hello like a regular person? "You ever gonna actually talk to me?" I write her back. I didn't anticipate a response because each time I text back, it is either read or left on delivery. 

Tonight, however, was different. She captioned a photo of herself brushing her teeth with "streaks" in it. The biggest sigh of relief left my lips. Thank heavens she was a little normal. She was beautiful even when she was doing something as simple as cleaning her teeth. I couldn't believe this goddess of a girl was interested in me at all. How did my friend even get to know her? I was able to see her eyes better in this photo. I was unable to determine whether her eyes were truly black or just a deep brown like mine. I can state with certainty that there is no light in them. They didn't even appear real. Whether it was the lighting or her artificial eyes, she had a slightly disturbing appearance. 

Normalcy is disrupted early the following day, around second block, when I receive a text from my friend informing me that Ang will be seeing me on the way to lunch. What a confusing message; aside from before lunch, I didn't get a time or place. What exactly was I expected to do with that information? I instantly realized that I could take advantage of this opportunity to meet her on my own terms. I reply to my buddy's text message promptly, saying, "Cool, tell her to meet me by the science room upstairs."

If she pulls some BS again, it will be the last time I speak with her on Snapchat or otherwise. Those seem like reasonable terms to me. As I idly stow my books and Chromebook in my backpack, I observe my classmates rushing out of the classroom at the ring of the bell. Since I'll be hanging out just outside the classroom anyhow, I'm not in a rush to get anyplace. I leave class with a wave to my tenderhearted teacher and decide to lean against the paper white cinderblock wall several feet from the door. I take out my phone and aimlessly browse; projecting a sense of busyness is enough to avoid attracting the attention of passing educators or students, who are unlikely to express their opinions anyway.  

I keep waiting while periodically checking the time displayed in the upper right corner of the screen. Minutes pass like carnival cotton candy. I started to get annoyed—not with the girl, but with myself; I couldn't afford to waste any more time on this odd girl. She owes me nothing, and I owe her nothing, so why don't I go for the sake of both of us? Just as I was about to move away from the wall, I heard someone behind me clear their throat. I rapidly turn around in an attempt to catch this individual before they vanish. Why would they vanish, you ask? I'm not sure what it is, but things have been getting weirder over the last few days, and I'm just waiting for it all to go over the edge. 

Surprisingly, it was one of the few friends I made at this school. She welcomes me with a grin, as she always does, and as gorgeous as she is, she has a boyfriend. Not quite no man's land, but a bridge I refuse to cross. 

"What are you doing here?" she asks.

"I could be asking you the same thing," I replied coolly. 

"Um I’m not the one loitering outside of Mr.P’s room," she points out with an awkward laugh.

"You right," I agree. "Fine, you really wanna know? I’m waiting for someone."

Her grin immediately turns mischievous. "Oh? And who might that be?"

Then it struck me so forcefully that I lost my smile. I didn't know this girl's name; the only name I've seen for her is Ang, and it's from Snapchat. I don't take Snapchat names at face value because everyone nowadays wants to be someone else. So I give the only name I know.

"Ang."

My friend looks at me, eagerly awaiting me to finish my sentence; it takes her a while to realize I did, and she bursts out laughing at the brief and mysterious name. 

"Ang? Ang who?

"She’s a junior," I added to the already mysterious moniker.

"If you think that helps me, it doesn’t," she chuckles and rolls her eyes at me. "Whatever, I gotta get inside and beg Mr.P to change my grade before my mom tells me that I can’t go to prom."

Throughout the brief interaction, no one messaged or revealed their face. My friend was correct; I am essentially just hanging around outside of this teacher's classroom, and I'm sure it looks really strange. I'm such an idiot for thinking this girl would ever show interest in me. Thus, I carry on with my day as usual, putting the bad thoughts to the back of my mind. 

I spent the rest of the day at home arguing with my friend on the phone. I told him about all of Ang's bizarre behavior and forced him to give me a reasonable explanation for why he sent this freak my way. The only explanation he could come up with was that I was lonely and he was just supporting a friend. What a lame fucking answer.

"Whatever bro, tell her I’m not interested in this game of hers."

My friend laughs, "Tell her yourself."

We spent the evening playing video games, as is customary for teenage lads on Fridays. As I turn off the PS4 for the night, I hear my phone buzzing. I look down at the time displayed on the screen of my phone. Is it already 1:11 AM? My gaze drops to the Snapchat alert. from Ang. I have no idea why I hesitated so much to open the Snapchat. Perhaps I was anxious to let her know I wasn't interested. I've never had a girl who was interested enough to say that to. Or perhaps it was the fact that she never sends me a message at a time that makes sense. Or perhaps a third reason that I was still not fully able to understand.

I immediately understood the third reason when I tapped on the chat. It is fear, and it is currently at the top of the fucking list. I keep looking at the picture while my mind works out rational solutions to the puzzle in front of me. The words "how," "when," "where," and "why" flood my mind. All of a sudden, I was watching over my shoulder as if something were going to happen. I'm not sure how to interpret this. The shot is of my friend and me, taken from exactly behind her, not even 10 feet away. The caption read, "Who is that?" 

End of Part 1
