*This story was shared with me by my* [*friend*](https://www.toodat.com/community/Mysonasked/IWitnessedaCrime/5m6QnXe0l5exrLjl) *who used to be an Overseas Filipino Worker (posted with permission). I find this disturbing and heartbreaking at the same time.*

I was told that sharing the story of my grief and regret as often as I can helps so I’m posting it here. Take note, this happened years ago but I still couldn’t let this go. I was an OFW in Italy. I have a wonderful boss and working there was nice and would have been perfect if I was with my family.

I am a father of two. My first is Daniel who is a very cheerful kid. Whenever we talk over the phone, he would tell how good he is at school and how he liked some of the gifts I sent to him, that sort of thing. But then, at some point, he asked me if I could teach him how to swim. I didn’t find it odd at first because well maybe he saw some kids swimming at a pool back at home and he was fired and wanted to try it himself. I told him, sure, when I get back home, I’ll surely teach him how to swim. This request didn’t happen once, however. Whenever I call back home, Daniel would ask me again if I could teach him how to swim. I kept telling him that I will, when I get back home. I even said maybe mom could teach you and Daniel would say that she refuses because she can’t swim either. Knowing that it will be months before I get home, I asked Jane, my wife, if she could enroll Daniel at a swimming school. She said she’ll try but I guess that didn’t happen because Daniel still kept asking me to teach him how to swim.

December. Finally, I was able to go home, just in time before Christmas and I got to be reunited with my family again. As soon as I got home, Daniel asked me to bring him to a beach and teach him how to swim. But December in the Philippines is not quite the season for going to the beach (since it’s a bit colder) and it was rainy that month as well. So I told Daniel that I will teach him next month to which he cried. He kept saying I promised but going to the beach wasn’t really on my plans that time.

As Christmas neared, Daniel’s request changed. Instead of teaching him how to swim, he asked me if I could buy him a floater. This is when I found it strange now. Why would he ask that? Because I felt bad for not being able to teach him how to swim, I agreed and bought him a floater and wrapped it as his Christmas gift. That night however the rain was extra strong. In the middle of the night, Jane woke me up and told me that flood water reached inside our home. As I got out of bed, I realized that the water was already legs deep and it’s still rising. I quickly woke Daniel up and carried him. I was so scared for the safety of my family.

We tried to evacuate. We really tried. I was carrying Daniel while my wife was holding on to me as we walked away from our home in hopes of finding a higher ground. Despite the heavy rain we kept pushing through. At this point, the water was at waist level. Then I don’t know what happened but a sudden surge of water pushed me and my wife out of balance. The shock made me lose my grip on my son and I tried to get him back but due to the darkness and the rushing water, I lost him in an instant. My wife and I surfaced back up from the flood but we couldn’t see Daniel. This is the most scared I have ever been and up to now, I tremble when I remember the exact moment I lost my grip on Daniel. We shouted all night for his name until daybreak came and we still couldn’t find him.

It took 3 days before we were able to recover his body. He drifted so far away and it broke my heart that I wasn’t there to save him. But what I regret more was the thought that maybe if taught him how to swim, or if I gave him his floaters that night, maybe my Daniel would still be alive.

Wherever you are, know that dad loves you so much and I am so sorry I didn’t listen to you. I am really really sorry.
