It was late when it happened. The fog was like a wet blanket. The drizzling rain didn’t help much. Only a smattering of cars passed in the opposite lane, seeing how it was well-past midnight. Needless to say, visibility was poor.

 
I’m a freelance musician, and I was driving home from some tiny town you’ve never heard of, longing for the comfort of my bed. I was exhausted. During the day, this particular stretch of highway is quite beautiful, overlooking rivers and lush farmland. But at night, it’s pitch dark. No streetlights, no businesses, nothing. Just darkness. And don’t get me started on the deer and coyotes that’ll jump out unexpectedly.


At first, I failed to see the threat. The tailgating car provided much-needed light to the dull and dreary darkness. Besides, I was singing along to Airbag by Radiohead, and trying not to swerve off the road or steer into the oncoming lane. But the tailgating car crept closer. I figured they were nervous, and for good reason. The roads were dangerously slick.
 

Then came the high beams.


“What the?”

 
The tailgater turned on their high beams, blinding me. Grumbling about Drivers-These-Days, I angled the rear view mirror so the light wasn’t as abrasive. By now, the car was kissing my bumper. It’s a two-lane highway, so I slowed down and leaned right, allowing the tailgater to pass.


The car didn’t pass. Instead, it started nudging my bumper. Clearly, this jerk meant harm. The thickening fog made matters worse. I couldn’t see a damn thing, so I sped up, hands wet on the wheel, looking to get away from the tailgating jerk. But my car is a piece of crap with balding tires and shotty brakes. It protested the entire time.  

The tailgater, meanwhile, matched my speed, daring me to drive faster. My hands were shaking. One bad bump and I’m a goner. As I regained control of my vehicle, the tailgater rammed into me. My car jerked suddenly, and nearly lost control. I screamed, my heart pounding like a jackhammer, and pumped the brakes, gently guiding the car towards the center of the lane.  


The jerk started flashing their lights; BLINK, BLINK, BLINK. That’s when I knew I was in trouble. This was no ordinary driver. This was a Bandit. My friend Dano warned me of these dangerous daredevils, a phenomenon which started during the pandemic. Late at night, on this particular stretch of highway, Bandits will force you to pull over, then they'll rob you. If you crash, even better. They capture it on their dashcam and post it on the dark web. Honestly, I thought they were an urban legend.
 

I slowed down, trying to keep from having a panic attack. If I remain calm, maybe this jerk will give up and drive away. Up ahead was the passing lane. Phew! I was saved. Or so I thought. I didn’t notice the other car. Not until it was too late. The other car, which seemingly came out of nowhere, pulled up next to me and matched my speed. When I sped up, they sped up. When I slowed down, they did too. I wouldn’t dare pull over; we were in the middle of nowhere, and I had all my music gear in the back. Musicians don’t make much money. If these jerks robbed me, I’d be screwed.


If only I could catch a glimpse of the drivers, size them up. Or at least jot down their license plates. The passing lane ended, and now I had two cars pestering me. I was boxed in. The driver in front turned off their lights and started slowing down. The jerk behind me, inches from my bumper, was blinding me with their friggin’ high beams. By now, I’m downright terrified. If something were to happen – something bad – who would know? I’m literally miles from nowhere.

 
I fumbled my phone, keeping one eye on the road. I knew this was dangerous, and I didn’t like doing it, but I had to do something. I was about to go Live, which I hoped would get the word out that I was in trouble, but the tailgating jerk slammed into me, and the phone flew from my hand. My heart fell to the floor, along with my phone.

Lightning illuminated the bittersweet sky. Buckets of rain came crashing down. The wipers went to war, streaking across the windshield, but the rain was merciless. My piece of crap car was sliding dangerously towards the ditch. The car in front suddenly slowed down. Screaming profanities which would make a comedian blush, I pumped the brakes, narrowly avoiding collision.


Mr. High-Beams started honking and flashing his lights, like this was my fault. What a jerk. Angrily, I steered into the wrong lane, hoping to pass. I put the pedal to the floor, but the balding tires were having none of it. The glistening road twisted and turned like a rattlesnake. Up ahead, headlights appeared. Coming straight at me was a transport truck, approaching at high speed. 

“Ah crap!” My short life flashed before my eyes. This was not how I wanted to die. I tried returning to my lane, but the Bandits were blocking me. The transport truck was barreling down the highway, blasting its horn. The horn sounded like Armageddon. Screaming at the top of my lungs, I smashed the brakes, and the car came to a screeching crawl. Narrowly avoiding disaster, I edged into the proper lane, and sighed. Now I was behind Mr. Headlights and Mr. NoLights.


The truck zoomed past, rumbling rudely as it rode away. The city’s landscape sparkled up ahead. This cheerless stretch of highway was ending. But the Bandits were barbarous. When the lanes opened up, they boxed me in, not letting me pass. So I turned on my high beams. Let's see how THEY like it.

A Burger King sign loomed large. Finally, I’d reached the outer edge of the city. Up ahead, gathered at the edge of the road, eating take-out, was a group of late-night partygoers. I turned off my high beams and started slowing down. By now, both Bandits had their lights off, and were swerving dangerously between lanes. Then the unthinkable happened: The Bandits veered right and ran over the pedestrians. Blood and bone and greasy grub splattered like fireworks. 


I pulled over, found my phone, and dialed 911. I was weeping. I'd never seen something so horrific. Despite the alarming amount of blood, there was no sound. These people weren’t hurt. They were dead. The impact was so forceful, the young man flew from his boots, and landed in the parking lot. His companions had similar fates. The Bandits, meanwhile, drove off, leaving behind three fresh corpses and one weary witness.


It was a long and joyless night. I told my side of the story, and answered a plethora of questions. The police said they’d look into it, but I’m still waiting. For all I know, the Bandits are still out there, causing crashes, wreaking havoc. I’m sure, on the dark web, there’s video of the crash. But I wouldn’t dare look at it. 

Each night as I close my eyes, I relive the tragic car crash. I see the surprise in the young woman’s eyes, moments before her brains explode. I see the young man’s body being catapulted from his boots. And I see blood. So much blood. Except in my dreams, it’s me driving. It’s me ramming into them. Getting my kicks. Crushing their skulls. Recording everything. And the airbag never saves my [life.](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromStarr/s/3dIldZ2NY7)
