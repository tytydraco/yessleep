I decided to go to the Vertloû Chèrier mountains in 4 days with my friend Luka. I'm starting to write in journals, notebooks and google docs because my memory's getting worse. My doctor said that I have some kind of mental condition. Was it Dementia? Or maybe it was Alzheimer's? It's getting worse by the month, so me and my friend decided to spend some time together. I hope that I won't forget about him one day.

Me and Luka prepared all kinds of supplies like beef jerky, tents, bedding supplies and even emergency kits. I don't know why Luka was so stubborn about buying all kinds of self-defence supplies. When I asked him about it, he just gave me a blank stare and said "It's dangerous in the wilderness". I have no idea what he's talking about, there's nothing dangerous out there.

Luka is a professional at everything wilderness related, to the point I wasn't surprised when I found out that he lives in a forest in Canada somewhere. I would trust him with my life. He's my one and only friend.

You might've noticed that we took way longer than 4 days to get ready. That's because Luka delayed it since he wanted me to get a bunch of licenses and permits. I have no clue what these are all for but we should be able to leave tomorrow morning.

The drive took about 8 hours, so I'm pretty exhausted.
We arrived at a cabin in the middle of a little clearing and brought everything we brought inside. Luka set up a candle inside that repels mosquitos once we were all set for the day. It worked like a charm!

We're planning on having a fire tonight so I left all the preparation to Luka. I guess he didn't like how I was just lazing around so he sent me to get some firewood even though we had plenty already. Now you probably won't believe me, but I saw the weirdest thing. There was a  marking on a tree a bit into the woods behind the cabin. It looked like this ¤. When I saw it and started looking at the trees, I started seeing more. Some looked different but most of them all had the same o in the middle of the marking. I speed-walked back to the cabin while being on guard and told Luke about what I saw. He looked at me and said "It's probably a prank set up by some teenagers to scare people. I mean, you always see that kinda stuff in horror movies." I was still on edge so I locked the doors and windows before going to sleep after the fire.

I got pretty worried when Luka disappeared this morning, but he came back in around 10 minutes. He told me that he went to go look at those markings I told him about. He said that they were strangely perfect even though it was apparent that they were drawn on by a knife. He started to seem pretty freaked underneath his calm exterior and started leaving knives plus some other self-defence stuff around the house. He put up a pot alarm at the entrance of the forest nearest to us. It was a system where if you moved the fishing wire strewn about the entrance of the forest, it would start clanging some of the extra pots we didn't need. He said it was for hunting animals, but I don't know about that.

I haven't updated this journal since nothing happened, but today was different. Luka disappeared before I woke up. I thought he would come back within an hour, but it's already almost night. I worry that he's not coming back.

Last night the pots went off so I grabbed Luka's hunting rifle and loaded it. I crouched underneath my bedroom window but nothing happened after that. I stayed in the same spot until morning. I could tell something was wrong. I grabbed the gun, ammunition, food and water and ran. Just as I was about to get in the truck, something grabbed my shoulder. I spun around and shot before I could even think. Luka was dead, his blood is on my hands. What do I do? Even if I go back, I'll be charged with murder. I don't know how to hide a body either and I would be the primary suspect since I'm considered mentally unstable. God, help me.

I can hear them calling, they're outside the door. They're waiting for me, the ones who did this. The ones who made me kill him. I'm gonna go open the door now. I guess this is gonna be my last time writing in this journal. I'll leave it inside the cabin for whoever came looking for us. I'm sorry Luka, I didn't mean it. Please forgive me.
