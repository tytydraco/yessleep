That damn notebook. I wish i had never found it. if i hadn't touched it none of this wouldnt have happened. I'm posting this for advice on what to do. please, help.

This started around a month ago. I was in class when i got called the reception because i had an appointment to go to throughout the school day. My mum was waiting for me in the waiting room next to the reception. I received my pass to leave and left with my mum. Before i got into the car, i saw a notebook. 

it was brown, leathery and had no label or name on it. I kicked it away, ignored it and got into the car thinking it belonged to someone else and they just dropped it outside, so i just left it there. After my appointment, school had finished so we went home and as i exited the car and neared the front door, i saw it again. the same notebook that was outside my school, at my door. I was confused but i picked it up and took it to my room, thinking that i would return it next week on Monday. As i entered my room i was curious as to what was in the notebook, i thought that there would be no harm in just taking a peek and its not like anyone would know if i did peek anyway, so i opened it. I was confused as to why it was empty but just thought that it was probably new and whoever owned it dropped it before they could get any use out of it. 

The next Monday i took it to the reception saying i found it outside and that i thought it was someones notebook for using at school. They took and said they would check with the students to see who's it was. As i was leaving school i saw someone picking it up and thought that was that. I was wrong. So very wrong. When i got home and entered my room i saw the notebook. Sitting on my desk again. And that when all the weird stuff started to happen. 

First it was just small thing like objects randomly falling off of shelves and cupboard opening. But after a while it would get worse. I would hear whispers in a random language, i think it was Latin but i dont know since i have never learnt it or tried to. I would also start waking up with scratches on me and i had no clue why. I thought i was maybe just scratching myself in my sleep, i knew i was lying to myself but i couldnt think of anything else. that when i started to see him. 

A few weeks after all this started, i saw him. at first it was just seeing him in the corner of my eye or in the window. I put it down to an overactive imagination but when i saw him directly infront of me i couldnt explain it. He was tall, red and his body has the texture of muscles. Like how muscles look underneath the skin and he was dripping with blood. he wasnt slim, but he wasnt bulky either. Just average and his face, his face was weird. its was a child's face. Like he had ripped a child's face off and sewn it on. There were no stitches but its was popping out. I could see the bloody flesh on the sides and his eyes just didnt exist. There was nothing there. Just black holes. He started speaking but i couldnt understand him since he was talking in the same language the random voice did. And his tone of voice was deep and gravelly yet also squeaky. Like a child whining over not getting the candy they wanted. 

I was frozen in fear because, well, who wouldnt be with a giant demon like creature staring into your eyes while it has none. When it started moving, it took me a second but i snapped out of my paralyzed state and darted to the smallest room i could, the bathroom. This brings us to now. I'm sure it broke the internet box so I'm using my mobile data for this. I have to stop using my phone now because my data is running low and i need to make sure this gets posted. Please, give me advice and if i can I'll give an update. I can't climb out the window because my bathrooms window is locked and my mum has the key. I'm begging of anyone to give me some advice and help. Please, help
