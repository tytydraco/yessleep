The Darkroom [facility](https://www.reddit.com/user/Trash_Tia/comments/13o31kn/brightwood_parts_17/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) was huge, and I was slowly getting lost in each expanse of white swallowing the two of us up. Felix pulled me into another familiar looking room. This time, I found myself staring at wall-people once again.  Who were in fact our viewers. I remembered them looking confused the first time I had been there. 

When I broke out of the fabricated trance I had been under and been led to the strange room in the middle of the woods, the room of screens I didn’t understand. Now I did. 

These people were Darkroom’s entertained. The ones holding us prisoner.  

This time, though, each person staring down at us looked to be at their edge of their seat, their lips twisted into hysterical smiles teeming with excitement; a certain hysteria I had only ever seen in Felix. I noticed he was frowning at a screen above us. It was the same screen he had first glimpsed his real self. The first time I saw a different side to my otherwise unproblematic classmate Kaz. It felt like years since the three of us had first stumbled inside this room, discovering our world, our lives, weren’t real.

“Who was that?” I whispered, my gaze trailing across each screen. I glimpsed a teenage girl around my age, gleefully watching us.

Felix didn’t reply for a moment, his eyes glued to each screen, monitors full of people staring down at us. “Hm?”

“That girl.”

“Oh, yeah.” He shrugged. “That was Yuna.”

“And she’s… like you, right?”

His eyes darkened. “No, she’s not like me,” Felix muttered. “She’s worse.” I noticed his hands were trembling. “Yuna is what Ava should have turned me into—and ultimately failed. She’s the product of completely resetting our brains to default once we rebel, back to the mind of a psychotic child. Yuna was always one of the weakest ones in our group, so they took pleasure in completely fucking her up. When she kept coming out of it, trying to kill herself when she got older, they sent her to Ava.”

I sucked in a breath. “And that…”

Felix pushed past me and headed towards the door spilling unnatural light of a fake sun. “Yep. That’s what I would be like right now.”

His words wouldn’t leave my mind as he led us back out into the fresh air. Brightwood. Home. Well, it was Elle’s home. “Here we are,” Felix murmured. “Back to paradise.” His voice was strained, and I knew we were running out of time. When i hit icy cold air, I let out a sharp breath and allowed myself to finally breathe. Looking around, I never noticed that every tree looked the same, and the sky above was always crystal blue. We started back through the forest, retracing our steps back into town.

Now we were out of the facility, I pulled off my jacket and told him to sit down under a tree. The sun was shining above us. Fake, but good enough for me. After spending so long inside the Darkroom facility, Brightwood itself resembled an outdoor dollhouse. Nothing was real.  The dirt we were treading on, or the trees stationed around us. Everything had been strategically placed and man-made. “Sit.” I told the boy. “I need to check to see if your wound is infected.” Looking at the boy, I could tell it was—or at least, something was happening. Healthy people didn’t sweat like that. the state of him resembled when his body had been rejecting the program; glistening skin shining under the skin, hollow and hah-lidded eyes, and a strained smile trying to put up a façade. 

Felix ignored me at first, insisting on us finding Annalise. Before I pulled him to a stop, grabbing his arm. When he protested, I shoved the boy onto his knees, muttering that he was being stubborn. When I attempted to create a makeshift bandage out of my jacket, Felix surprised me with a laugh. “Elle.” He rolled his eyes, swiping at his nose, where the bleed was slowing down. I wasn’t sure if that was a good or a bad thing.  “I love your enthusiasm, but I don’t think wrapping your jacket around my head is going to help.” Unbeknownst to him, however, I was a girl scout when I was eight.

Well, Elle was. But I did have basic survival skills. When I had gotten a proper look at his head wound, however, my stomach recoiled. The hole in his head was seeping a cardinal river, beads of red staining his scalp and drying his hair in thick clumps. The infection was obvious with a greenish like sludge coating the wound itself. Fuck. Unable to help myself, I poked the trauma around the scalp.  I could see exactly where the penetration point had been, and looking closer, seeing specks of white which must have been his skull, Ava’s procedure really had dug right into the root of his brain. He should be dead, I thought dizzily.

It made zero sense that he wasn’t, or under Darkroom’s control. I thought back to the screen in the control room.

I had definitely seen those metal rods enter his skull, so, how?

How was it possible his brain wasn’t reset like Yuna’s?

“Is it bad?”

I could tell he was trying not to laugh, and I shoved him with a hiss.

“No.” I said. “You’re… fine.”

“You’re lyiiiiing.” Felix chuckled. “No offense, but you have the worst poker face.” He shrugged. “I told ya. Ava’s brutal. I can tell from your face it’s infected too.”

He was right. This was something I wouldn’t even be able to make the slightest bit better for him, even if I tried. Felix must have seen my expression, his eyes lighting up with amusement. “Don’t worry.” He jumped to his feet, trying to hide his grimace. “I’ll be fine! It’s just a… you know, a huge, cavernous fucking pit in my head. I’m sure there will be no irreversible trauma—and stop looking at me like that. Looking like you’re going to throw up really isn’t helping me trying not to barf.”

I inclined my head. “So, you’re saying you’re not going to collapse and abandon me?”

He smirked. “Oh, so you’re using me, huh?”

“Something like that.”

When we reached the forest's clearing, the two of us stumbling back into too too-bright sunlight, we were greeted to a cacophony of…. clapping.

Felix frowned, stepping onto the tarmac of the road. We were so close back to my house, back to what I used to think was normal. “What the fuck is that?”

I wasn’t completely sure what it was until stepping onto our neighborhood confirmed my suspicions. I found myself greeted to town’s people. But they didn’t speak to us, or even move. Instead, they stood, eerily still in front of their houses, or on the road and sidewalk. Clapping. I recognised my neighbors. Mr Jenson, and the elderly couple living opposite us, even little kids sitting in yards. Felix’s hand slipped from mine, and he strode over to Mr Kite, our Spanish teacher, who was standing with the rest of them, his eyes empty, lips stretched into a wide smile. Clapping. Felix waved his hands in front of the man’s face, but the teacher didn’t blink. “Huh.” Felix turned to me. “I’m not a rocket scientist, but I’m going to guess this is Darkroom’s doing.”

I had to swallow something slimy creeping up my throat. “So, they’re being controlled?”

“Yep.” Felix winced, struggling to keep his balance. “ I’d say so.” He jumped in front of a woman with bright red hair, poking her in the forehead. “Or… these guys are just really happy to see us? I’m going to guess this is our welcoming committee.”

There was something uncanny about the way they were standing. It was almost like they were anticipating something.

“Welcoming committee?”

I couldn’t move, glued to the spot. “Why are they just standing there?!”

His lips curved into a smirk. “Menacingly?”

"No, it's like…" I could feel my heart in my throat, every nerve ending on fire. "Like they're anticipating something."

Turning to me, Felix looked like he was going to reply before a voice sounded loud and clear across town.

“Really, Elle?”

The announcer.

“Stay where you are.”

Above us, to my confusion, the sky itself seemed to blur in front of my eyes, before flickering to a screen. At first, I wasn’t sure what I was looking at, before I recognised the white room inside Felix’s memory. There they were again. The line of children standing against the back wall. I saw six-year-old Felix, the twist of panic and fear in his eyes as he reached out for a little girl’s hand. He backed away, attempting to run towards the door with several other little kids, before being dragged back. The redhaired woman stepped through the door and held up a rabbit before slicing its throat in front of the line of children, whose screams were muted. Next to me, Felix’s gaze was on the sky, on the screen flickering with old footage, his lips curving into a scowl. “This is a show,” he muttered. “They want to see a reaction out of you. Don’t give it to them, Elle.”

His voice, however, was nothing but white-noise screeching in my ears.

“Oh, Elle,” the announcer chuckled. “I think it’s time to face several truths. What if I told you your life was also a lie? Did you hear that? Oh, our wonderful viewers, did you know that our Elle was also manufactured like our other performers? You weren’t expecting that were you?”

No.

The announcer’s words were like knives perforating me, and I felt my body drop, the impact of harsh gravel digging into my knees. I was half aware of someone grasping for my arm, and then clammy hands attempting to cover my eyes—but it was too late. One moment I was suspended on Darkroom’s puppet strings, and then I was falling, sinking into the abyss, my strings severed. No. Because that meant they weren’t real. The people I had found in  my dwindling memory. My mom and dad, my brother, and Annalise. I found myself scanning the footage for… me. What if I had existed inside that room of children engineered to be psycho’s? What if it was my hand which little Felix had grasped for, and I couldn’t even recognise myself?

Could that… really be it? Could this be their final bombshell?

“Elle!”

Through half lidded eyes, I realized Felix was grasping onto my shoulders, shaking me. A scream was ringing out in my ears, clanging in my skull—and it took me a disorienting second to understand it was… mine. I was trembling, screaming, trying to claw out my hair, my fingernails like claws. Something was bleeding into me, sinking into me and twisting my thoughts, setting fire to my brain.  

I was aware that I was smiling, laughing, and it was feral happiness, the kind of fake happiness, twisted despair turned into euphoria which had been drilled into every Darkroom OG’s head. 

I couldn’t get them out of my head; that they were fantasy. That they weren’t real. I had pieces of them still clinging on, splinters I refused to let go of. Nick. My brother. I knew his face, even when they had tried to wipe him away. I knew my father and my mother, and the day they were brutally murdered. I saw their death, so how… how could they not be… real? 

As if reading my mind, the footage itself twisted and blurred, before I was seeing my six-year-old self kneeling on pristine white tiles. In front of me was what was left of a rabbit, glistening scarlet innards spilling onto my clenched fingers. I smeared the rabbit’s blood all over my face, laughing. The door opened, and a struggling man was brought in, and shoved onto his knees. I knew him. Something in my gut twisted, and my stomach revolted. Dad. With his hands bound behind his back, he was helpless, when I drew the blade of a knife across his throat. Blood spurted onto my face, but I was laughing, sticking the blade through his skull and then into his chest.

I felt it, the slightest prick of pleasure running through me at the thought of my dad –my fake dad’s—blood covering me.

Fake.                                                                         

He wasn’t…real.

Not… real?

I could feel my hands twitching, longing for something sharp to slice though flesh, and perforate wet, slimy innards.

They weren’t… real?

“Elle!” Felix’s voice was like ocean waves barely reaching me. “Hey, you need to fucking snap out of it!”

When warm hands were grasping my face, and forcefully turning my head, the vicious leech of darkness seeping inside me was severed.

I blinked, trying to find clarity. And when I did, Felix’s wide eyes were inches from mine, his hot breath in my face. “This is what they did to me,” he hissed out. “This is how they broke me. Do you remember?” When I couldn’t respond, he shook me violently, until my brain was bouncing around in  my skull. I did… remember. I remembered being a prisoner inside his memory, the small boy engineered into a killer—and I knew how that began. It began with one truth, and a lie. The reality of his existence as an oblivious performer, and the lie.. the lie which planted the seed inside an already fucked up mind. That he had killed his father and brother. And meant it. When in actuality, he wasn’t in control of himself. Felix hadn’t been in control of himself since he was six years old.

Since he was kidnapped. 

“Listen to me!” As if he was following the blurred thoughts trying to be coherent in my head, Felix shook me again. “Hey! Dude, I grew up with those kids! I remember every face, every kid. Every time they fucked with our heads. Every time we killed a rabbit or put a bullet in some guy’s skull. I remember all of them. Yuna, and Sim, and Cassidy. Minho, Ryan, Felicity, and Noah.” He let out a shuddery breath. “But I don’t remember yours.”

Something monstrous was building inside me, a feral fire catching light. I tried to get away, but he tightened his grasp. “They can wipe my brain all they want, Elle. I would remember your face.” His voice broke. “But I don’t. So stop being a fucking idiot, and snap out of it. They’re playing with your head! Hello? You’re literally on a twisted reality TV stream!  You never existed with the rest of us, because if you.. if you did… how would I have killed your parents?” He choked on a sob. “Elle, your brother.” Felix’s grip tightened on my shoulder. I could feel the prick of his nails slicing into my flesh. “I killed him. I…I killed your mother and your father. Sim and I. I can’t keep running away from what we did. I know that now. We sliced them up, and—and that happened, okay? That was real! What you saw wasn’t fake, or an illusion. I killed them, Elle. I fucking killed them, and I… I need you to know that.” 

Somehow, his words latched on, and clarity started to seep back in. In front of me, the white room contorted into my brother’s living room, and the shadow of six-year-old me morphed into a teenage Sim.

Her gleaming smile, and the slither of silver in her hand.  I didn’t know. I didn’t know until I was seeing it, until I was feeling that hollowed out darkness trying to creep into my head and crack me apart, just like it had him.  Back in reality, Felix’s voice was still there, an anchor grasping onto me and pulling me from the gnawing abyss.  “Which means they existed! Do you hear me? Elle, they’re trying to get in your head. They’re trying to break you. But you know your parents existed! Your brother, Nick? He had your birthday as his apartment code…” 

Felix trailed off, catching himself. “I’m probably not helping—no, I know I’m not helping you. But you have a choice to do the opposite to me. You don’t have to break like I did. Hey!” He snapped, when I felt my head slump, my eyes flickering. “They had me exactly where they wanted me, and I had already been fucked up! Can you hear me? Elle, listen to me. You’re not like me. You’re not going to break.” It was my very own Redroom procedure, and I had been too blindsided to realize the screen of pooling red taking over the sky. When I was shoved back violently, the images flickering in front of my eyes dissolved into twitching shapes and spiralling red struggling to take control.

Break.

It would be so easy, I thought.

To just… break.

To become part of Brightwood and submit to the urge threatening to come alive inside me, twisting me inside out.

I wasn’t expecting the slap, a harsh backhand across my face. But this time it was enough to snap me out of it.

I did know, I thought dizzily.

Of course my parents had existed. I had suppressed memories of them which sometimes found the forefront of my mind. I remembered going to the town lake with Nick and taking turns doing cannonballs into sparkling water with him. I felt myself crumple into his arms, and the boy was surprisingly warm, tightening his grip on me. “Listen to me,” Felix whispered. “I promise I’m going to help you find your name. We’ll find out who you were, and…” He paused. “Maybe we’ll find out who I was too.” He laughed. “Actually, yeah! I would actually really like to know who I was before.. this. Because I know there wasn’t all this, you know? But that will count on you, like, not giving into this thing. We’re getting out of here, I promise. We’re going to go home.”

I thought back to his memory, to the two mother’s which had been cruelly torn from his memory—an older brother his younger self had adored. Swallowing the urge to tell him he did have a family, I pressed my face into his shoulder and allowed myself to fall apart. The time to tell him would come, but it wouldn’t be in the middle of a fake-town being broadcasted across the world. When the sky turned blue once again, the sun appearing again, I figured the announcer was finished tormenting me.

“See.” Felix mumbled into my shoulder. “You’re okay.”

“What are you two doing?”

Her voice sent my body into fight or flight, and I lifted my head, blinking through hazy sunlight to see… Her. Golden hair tied into pigtails, and the same wedding dress hanging from a wiry frame, a veil awkwardly perched on a crown of curls. Annalise. I couldn’t recognise her as my sister because those memories were gone. 

The girl was smiling widely, though something in her eyes was different. She seemed almost lucid. I could see clarity pricking in her expression, something I definitely wasn’t used to. Before I could stop myself, I was jumping up, wrapping my arms around the small girl, and pulling her to my chest—which ignited old feelings I didn’t even know I had. She was so warm, and felt… safe. A million memories which were so out of reach imploded inside my head once I was whispering into her hair and squeezing the girl until she squeaked. 

When I pulled away and got a proper look at her face, Annalise looked better than  ever. Her eyes were bright, no sign of that maniacal grin which had stolen away her sanity. I noticed smears of scarlet decorating her lips and nose from her time in the laughing-track room, but she was okay. Annalise was okay, and I couldn’t stop crying. She was the little sister I didn’t even know I had, and she was here. Nick, mom and dad were gone, and yet my sister had made it, and had been right in front of me the whole time. “Hey!” Annalise protested when I tried to hug her again. She stepped back with a wide smile. “Where did you go?”

“Where did WE go?” Felix was next to wrap the girl in a hug which lasted a few seconds, but it was enough. To my confusion, Annalise didn’t pull away. She didn’t hiss at him or call him a Peeker. In fact, the girl seemed happy to hug him, squeezing him until he grimaced, pulling away, his hands going to his head. “Dude, you’ve been missing in action for days! Where were you?”

Annalise cocked her head. “They took me to a room where I laughed a lot…” She frowned. “And then I escaped!”

Felix’s gaze snapped to me. “I don’t mean to break up the reunion, but doesn’t she seem way too sane for Annalise Duval?”

I shoved him. “Felix.”

“What?” He rolled his eyes. “You know I’m right! For all we know, she could have been brainwashed all along! She could be waiting to betray us and drag us back to be lobotomised for the hundredth time. Because, let’s be honest, that’s literally their only gameplan. Acting out? Here’s a lobotomy! Starting to remember your real self? Knock-knock! Who’s there? A lobotomy! If Annalise has been with them for this long, I can guarantee something has been done to her. They wouldn’t be able to resist, and I say this as a former brainwashed moron.” He caught her eye. 

“No offense, Blondie, but you miraculously being sane is too much of a leap—even for Brightwood.” The boy looked uncomfortable, and I knew why. He knew what he had done to her under Darkroom’s control. I saw his memories, where he had sliced into her flesh with no mercy or remorse. Laughing.

No matter how hard he tried, I knew he wouldn’t be able to forget that. And neither would I—after being forced inside his memory. Still though, Felix was right. Annalise being okay, and not screaming about Peekers and wall-people wasn’t how we knew her.  

But I think I was blinded by happiness that my sister was standing in front of me, and not dead, or stuck in that horrific room. She didn’t have to be the version of her from my old life; the glowing ball of confusing light entangled in my memories. All I needed was Annalise. Who was familiar. Even if Annalise was just another Brightwood creation, and Felix Delacroix’s personal toy to play with. “Elle!” Ignoring Felix’s snide comment, Annalise’s lips quirked into an excited smile.

“I think I’ve found a way out!”

Her words twisted my gut, and I shot a look at Felix. Around us, town’s people were still clapping, and the sound was driving me crazy.  “A way out?”

“The school.” She whispered excitedly. “There’s a secret door in the auditorium!”

Felix looked sceptical, but intrigued. “Wait, are you serious?”

“Uh-huh!” She nodded with a grin, and reached out to grab my hand. Even lucid, the girl’s memory had been ravaged. She had no idea I was her sister, or that our parents were dead. She just knew we were living in a fake reality.  “Come with me! I can show both of you.” Before I could tug away, Annalise wrapped her fingers around my elbow and pulled me into a sprint.

“Hey, wait!” Felix joined us, stumbling after us. This time, Annalise didn’t spin and twirl, and giggle like a child. The further we got away from the crowd of town’s people locked into an applause, her expression started to falter, and I finally noticed her sharp gasps for breath, the sobs she was struggling to swallow. “I found the way out, Elle.” Annalise said in a whisper. Twisting to me, she smiled at us—and it hit me like ice cold water coming over me, that her smile was for the audience watching. Was my little sister over-exaggerating her part as Annalise to fool the people watching us, or did I have too much hope?

As we were approaching the high school, Annalise drove us faster, pumping her arms to propel us further. “We need to be quick, or the Peekers are going to get us.”

“Peekers?” I hissed out, almost falling over myself.

“Uh-huh! They’ll be coming!”

“I knew it,” Felix grumbled, struggling to keep up. “She’s still crazy.” His strained breaths were worrying me. Every time I looked behind me, he had stopped for a moment, his hand creeping around the back of his head, glaring down at his fingers slick and wet with blood. When I caught his eye, the boy shot me a weak smile and wiped his hands on his jeans, forcing himself into a run. When Felix stumbled over, this time falling flat on his face, and I turned on my heel to grab him, he scowled.

“What did I tell you? I’m fine.”

The slur in his words, and the pallid shade of his cheeks said otherwise, however. Annalise, still running, turned to him, her golden curls spiralling in a sudden breeze which picked up out of nowhere. “You’re going to die,” she said softly, her expression turning forlorn. “I’m sorry, Kaz.”

Felix stopped running, or trying to run. I saw his expression contort into anger, and then fear. Pain. He wasn’t trying to hide it anymore. 

“Oh wow, I’ve missed your predictions,” his voice broke into a laugh entangling with a sob. “Well, yeah, duh.” He prodded at his head. “Of course I’m going to die, but hey, you don’t need to remind me alright? I would rather spend my last precious minutes or hours or seconds on earth, not thinking about the inevitability of death, or if there’s even an other side.”

Annalise’s smile didn’t waver. “Well, you should stay here.” She said. “You’re dying, so what would be the point in taking you? You’re slowing us down.”

The boy looked hurt for a moment, his gaze flicking to me. “Your sister sucks,” he chuckled. “No offense, of course.”

“Annalise.” I said stiffly. “He’s not slowing us down.”

The girl’s eyes shifted to me. “Kaz Issacs is a Peeker.” She said through a grin which I knew was hurting her. I could see the strain in her face attempting to stay smiling, and keep the Annalise façade. “He did bad things to me, Elle. I don’t want him to come with us.”

I grasped onto her shoulders. “I can explain,” I whispered to her. “But you need to trust him for now, okay? As soon as we’re out of here, I’ll tell you everything.” I felt my eyes start to sting, to prick with tears which were a startling relief on my cheeks.

Annalise’s eyes burned into mine, stubborn, lip wobbling.

She was definitely my sister.

Her gaze flicked behind me, eyes widening. Her real voice came through for a moment, just a piece of the old her.  “If we’re going to help him, we need to… right now.”

Following her eyes, my own found the boy slumped on the ground, curled into himself in vasty pooling crimson.

Fuck.

No. No, I wasn’t going to lose him. The bastard still owed me an apology. He promised. With that in mind, I gathered him into my arms, trying to ignore how limp he felt, how cold his skin was, that his flitting breath was slowing. When the boy’s head went limp, hanging from my arms, I screamed at Annalise to keep going—and she did. I don’t know what I expected. Maybe The announcer was going to come back and tease me with Felix’s death, or they would stage another attempt at snatching my mind. But nothing happened. Annalise led me inside the high school, down the hallway I had spent three years walking down as Elle—as a fictional performer. Felix was far too light in my arms, and I knew he was running out of time. There was nothing I could about his haemorrhaging nose but force his face into the material of my jacket and pray there was enough pressure to stop the bleed. Annalise dragged me to the auditorium, and just like she had in the forest, threw out her hands.

“Tah-dah!”

She pointed to thin air, and when I followed her hesitantly, I walked directly into something metal.

A door.

I could have laughed. The door to freedom was right in front of us the whole time. When my sister pulled it open, sunlight streamed from darkness, hitting me in the face. Real sunlight. Not fake sunlight. Real, proper light bleeding through. I had dreamed of stepping back into the real world through a magical door. I fantasised about stepping straight into the blurry streets of my memory, cranked up to vivid HD now I was seeing them for myself. 

I wanted to see the Starbucks coffee shop, and my brother’s apartment; a whole world I had been torn from for nearly three years of my life. 

What I found, however, was a tunnel filled with waste leading into factory-like building which looked to be Darkroom’s base. The outside world started with shit on my shoes, and spiders scuttling on crumbling wood. When Annalise peeked through a broken metal door before kicking it open, I was greeted to… nothing. There were no buildings, no stores, the rush hour of masses of people which had haunted my suppressed memories. Instead, we were staring into a long, dusty road running into wide expanses of grey sky.

It was late evening, and we were in the middle of nowhere with an unconscious and dying boy in my arms. There was a vending machine nearby. Annalise broke into it with a brick, using bottled water to attempt to clean Felix’s head. Luckily, we managed to hitch a ride. 

The woman who offered almost fainted when she saw Felix, but agreed to drive him to the emergency room. She asked questions, ones we couldn’t answer. The word “kidnapping” came up a lot, though I made sure to keep my mouth shut.  I can and never will able to describe how alien I felt in a world which used to be part of me. 

Sitting in the back of a car which drove by itself, I was suddenly stricken with the realization that I was still Brightwood’s Elle. I was free. I was outside in the real world—but I was still Elle. I was still polluted with her memories. Leaning into warm leather seats, I allowed myself to relax for a moment, with Felix curled up on the seat next to me, and Annalise in the front, I poked my back tooth where the device was still implanted. I thought about ripping it out right then, but did I… did I want to?

Did I really want to go back to a life which had been so brutally ripped away, one I didn’t even know anymore?

Poking at the device again, I made the decision I was going to attempt to extract it when Felix was okay. When there was no sign of Darkroom pursuing us, I would rip the damn thing out. And I knew that thought was in the back of Annalise’s head. Were we being chased? 

Her trembling hands and sudden obsession with nursing Felix made it obvious she was terrified that Darkroom were coming after us. In the passenger seat, my sister ignored the woman attempting to find out more about us, pressing her face against the glass and searching for anyone behind us. When Felix made a mumbling noise, she almost gave herself whiplash, pressing her soaked sweater to his clammy head. It was an odd sight. 

My sister trying to nurse the kid who had turned her into what she was. We weren’t alone in the car. The woman’s teenage daughter was in the seat behind me, and I could hear her fingernails clicking on her phone’s screen. 

At the corner of my eye, I swore she pointed her phone at me.

No. I shook my head. I was being paranoid.

Still though, I made sure to turn my face, shielding myself.

Luckily, there was an emergency room nearby. The woman, whose name was Juliet, offered to help us get Felix inside. I told her we were okay. Thankfully, the boy was taken from my arms once I stumbled through the doors, Annalise following my instructions, and running to get help. I didn’t notice I was covered in his blood until the boy was being swarmed by people in white. Something snapped inside me, watching them crowd around him. I blinked, and my heart started to race. All I could see was the Redroom, the figures in white wearing masks who had pinned him down to pull Kaz from his mouth. I saw him, a blur in hazy white, forced onto his back by the man who slammed his head into marble tiles, greedy hands cruelly tearing the device—his humanity—from his mouth. I didn’t help him. I just lay there paralysed, drowning in my own despair. 

But I could help him now. Watching them force a plastic mask onto his face, and restraining his kicking legs, I could only see the Redroom. I could only see what they did to him. Both as a kid, and a teenager. I started forwards, opening my mouth to tell him to leave him alone—to get their hands off of him-- before Annalise was pulling me back, her warm arms wrapping me into a reassuring hug. “It’s okay, Elle,” she hummed, burying her head into my shoulder. 

“They’re not going to hurt him.”

I knew that, though I still found myself following his bed right to the surgery theatre before I was being turned away and told I couldn’t enter. I had half a mind to say I didn’t care. I’d seen worse. However, when I really thought about it from their point of view, I could understand. I spent five hours waiting for Felix to get out of surgery. Annalise was restless next to me, complaining about the light hurting her eyes, and then telling me she was going to get soda. I wasn’t sure what she meant.

Neither of us had any cash for soda. The sky was darkening when I was trying not to fall asleep. Lifting my head to check the clock, I glimpsed a kid standing across the waiting room. Fourteen, or maybe fifteen years old. He was leaning against the wall, holding up his phone and pointing it directly at me. I thought it was coincidence before he caught my eye, his lips splitting into a grin, and something cold crept down my spine. The boy lifted his finger to his lips in a shushing motion before mouthing something. I saw the curve of his lips, every letter exaggerated like it was purposeful. Like he wanted me to see it. 

*Spoilers*.

“Elle?”

I blinked. Annalise was standing in front of me, her sleepy eyes half lidded. She swiped at them with the sleeve of a jacket I didn’t recognise. Where did she get that jacket? My gaze flicked from her to the boy, but to my confusion, the boy was gone.

“Elle!”

Stepping in front of me, my sister waved her hands in front of my face. “Kaz is out of surgery. Do you want to come and see him?”

I nodded slowly, blinking rapidly. The boy was gone, and when I searched for him, I started to wonder if I’d imagined him.

“Thank god.” I got to my feet, stretching. “Is he going to be okay?”

Instead of replying, Annalise reached out for my hand, slipping her fingers in mine. “Why don’t you come see for yourself?”

The walk to Felix’s room felt otherworldly. 

The place was empty, and yet a doctor or a nurse stood at every corner. I caught their eyes on me. Felix was awake, uncomfortably propped up on a dozen pillows. His room was luxurious for a patient’s. Maybe Juliet paid without me noticing, or maybe the seriously injured got some kind of benefit. Felix Delacroix looked out of place in a room reserved for the sick. He was restless, tugging on an IV stuck into his wrist, a frown carving his lips. I could tell he wanted to pull it out--- with our combined track record, he, Annalise and I were used to it. There was a bandage wrapped around his head, awkwardly tucked under his curls. I had to smile. The kid was like a dog at the vet. 

Sitting cross-legged like his six-year-old self, Felix was glaring at a TV screen mounted to the wall in front of his bed. 

Though there was nothing playing. The screen was blank. When I slipped through the door, with my sister diving into the comfortable looking chair next to the window, I was suddenly unsure what to say. There was a lot I wanted to say—but I think I just wanted to hug him. Now that we were away from cameras and prying eyes, and alone (mostly) I wanted to talk about everything and nothing with him. 

I wanted to demand an apology I would never forgive, but I knew I would try. “You’re okay.” Were the words which slipped from my mouth. I wasn’t sure why my heart was slamming into my chest, why my breath was suddenly stuck in my throat.

It was so.. strange. Now that we were away from Brightwood, I was seeing his real self; a cocktail of both Kaz and Felix, with humanity intact.

“Hey.” I said, when he didn’t answer. 

The guy's eyebrows furrowed, his gaze glued to whatever was so interesting on the screen.

“Felix.” I shot a look at Annalise, who turned towards the window to marvel a vase full of flowers. Black Dahlia’s in full bloom. They were my fake mom’s favorite. When I was a kid—or when Elle was a kid—we used to plant them in her flower garden.

“You are… you, right?” I whispered, suddenly afraid.

The boy chuckled, his eyes straying on the TV screen. “Oh, wow. Are you seriously doubting me right now?”

I scoffed. “No.”

“Good.” Felix patted the bed next to him, and I hesitated before awkwardly plonking myself on comfy looking sheets.

The boy turned to me, gesturing me to come closer with a smile I had grown to trust. 

I did, crawling over to him. The bed was surprisingly comfy. I could pass out right then. The pillows he was propped up on looked far too comfortable, and I hadn’t slept in days; only sedated. Felix gestured for me to get closer, and I did. Before he was pulling me close, his breath grazing the back of my neck, and then my ear. The air seemed to move around him, and his story came to a climax in my head. He was the boy who was kidnapped as a child and trained into a Darkroom influencer, had found his mind against all odds, and..

“Peek-a-boo.” His voice, a sing-song murmur, cut into my thoughts.

At first, I thought he was joking around, before his hands came down on my shoulders, his fingernails biting into my flesh. I pulled away, but he held on, clinging on, clawing like an animal. But I knew those words, that melodic giggle. 

Sim. When she murdered my family.. 

Annalise, her mind ravaged by despair. 

“Seriously,” the low murmur of his voice twisted into a psychotic giggle, and I felt a shift in front of me. I felt his desperation to keep onto me, to continue spewing poisonous words. His grasp was tight, suddenly, claw-like nails digging into my arms. I knew this touch. It was familiar, from the memory I had managed to hold onto. 

His breath tickled the back of my neck, and in front of me, Annalise jumped to her feet, danced over to the TV, and switched it on. When I tried to tear out of his embrace, the boy, the animal, clinging onto me, laughed, and his hysterical giggle was enough to twist my stomach, bile creeping up my throat in a sour paste. “Don’t you just…” The boy drifted off when I found my voice, screaming for help, slamming one hand over my mouth, his other hand gripping my scalp. “Love a fucking plot twist?”

Annalise didn’t move, eerily standing in front of the TV, her arms by her sides. When the screen flickered, I knew what was coming.

When I tried to look away, his cutting nails found my neck, pressing pressure. I choked on a hiss, but I couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe. Felix held me closer, and I sensed it. Without looking at him, his eyes were still hollowed out, still too single pools of oblivion staring back. Thoughts exploded inside my mind, spiralling. 

I made an attempt to lunge off the bed. The way his body moved like a snake, arms latching around my neck. Not enough pressure to choke the breath from my lungs, but harsh enough to keep me still. “Do you know what gets the audience going?” His teeth grazed my neck in another bout of twisted giggles. “Like, I mean views, man. Tell me. In your seventeen years on this earth, what gets attention, hm? What defies expectations? You’ve watched TV, right? Reality TV, the shit they put on Netflix and Hulu. It’s trending on Twitter. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE is talking about it.” I couldn’t speak. The words, along with the answer, were curled on my tongue, choking me.

But I wouldn’t say it.

I refused.

I didn’t reply, and suddenly the room was far too silent, the white noise on the TV growing louder and louder in mu ears, until it was… screaming. It was bleeding into me, and I tried to clamp my hands over my ears, but the bastard pinned my arms down.

“Thaaaaat’s it,” Felix hummed. “You know what I’m talking about!” His hands came to cradle my face, and I found myself staring into nothing. 

I was always looking into nothing, into unchanged oblivion. His grin widened, and the screen at the corner of my eye finally exploded into bright color, images flickering together like a jigsaw puzzle sliding back into place.

“A betrayal, you stupid bitch." He murmured into my skin. 

I tried to bite him, but he was stronger, even with a head injury.  

“Shock value.” Felix continued in a sing-song murmur. He laughed. “We both know how to get an audience’s attention, Elle. To not bore the viewer to death, you have to experiment a little, y’know? Throw the narrative in a direction you THINK you’re following closely,” he continued, his fingers gripping my chin. 

“Only to make a sudden, unexpected U-turn out of nowhere.”
