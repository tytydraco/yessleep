My son is a good boy. 

So when cats and dogs started disappearing from the neighborhood, I didn’t ask questions. Good boys like him would never be involved. 

And if he were, then the insomnia would just prove that he feels guilty about everything. Good boys don’t feel guilty. 

Besides, he’s only ten years old. 

So when the Wilkins girl disappeared, I was scared for him and for all of the other decent, well-behaved people on our block. Jilly Wilkins lived in the house right behind us; our backyards share a fence. I can only imagine how terrified my son is.

That would also explain the insomnia. I don’t think he ever sleeps. 

That explains why he got so sloppy. Two different shirts of his made it into the laundry with spots of blood on them. Boys love to roughhouse, and he clearly didn’t even notice that he’d cut himself. 

So I went to clean his room. 

That’s when I found the shoebox. 

My son is a good boy. But even I was scared when I looked under the bed and found it. 

The smell hit me first, like metal and rot. It was clearly coming from the soggy shoebox. It sagged in the middle, saturated with a brown, crusty stain. 

It looked like I felt inside.

So I didn’t touch it. Out of sight, out of mind. 

“Hi, Mom.”

My heart jackhammered in response to the words. I’d just opened the door to leave his room and found him on the other side.

Like he’d been waiting for me.

He wasn’t smiling. 

“You cleaned my room,” he announced.

I told him I had.

“As a result, I guess I don’t have to hide things anymore.”

“What?”

“I said I don’t have to clean things anymore. Because you’ll do it for me, right?”

I nodded and darted out of the room.

Three days later, I hadn’t cleaned his room again, and they still hadn’t found Jilly Wilkins.

But his room was starting to smell.

Which was to be expected. He was a growing boy who had stopped showering and sleeping.

So I eventually had to go in there. I resolved to change his sheets, because that would help with the smell. I didn’t have to look under his bed. Whether that I was because I was afraid or was just telling myself that it wasn’t necessary, it didn’t really matter.

My son is a good boy. 

I had a smile on his face as I pulled his old blankets off the bed, thinking that he might finally get some rest once he had nice, clean sheets to lie down on. The sun was shining across the room as I popped the pillow out of the pillowcase.

That’s when it dropped to the floor.

I bent down to pick it up quickly, telling myself that I didn’t want to inhale the air beneath the bed. 

It felt like a cold chicken drumstick in my palm. 

I shook as I looked down and saw a severed little girl’s finger in my hand.

I wanted to let go. I really did. But shock had paralyzed the part of my mind that controlled my hand, and the part that let me close my eyes.

I could breathe just fine, though. Crouched down at the bottom of his bed, I inhaled the smell of metal and rot.

“You cleaned my room again.”

My muscles shot back to life as I dropped the finger, stood up, and turned around. His eyes watched it bounce toward the corner. 

I struggled for something, anything, to say.

“You’ve got blood on your shoulder.”

He looked down at his shirtsleeve. “Huh.” He wiped the cotton, staining his fingers red. 

My son didn’t move as I slid past him out of the room, heart racing. He didn’t seem to mind that I could barely squeeze between him and the doorframe.

I ran outside and gasped for air. It was very overcast. From there in the backyard, I could see the Wilkins’s house. I’d heard her mother tried to kill herself after three days.

Now what? I couldn’t leave my son. Even if he had done something bad, his still needs his mommy. 

What am I saying? My son is a good boy. 

I stared at my watch for 31 minutes and 53 seconds before accepting the fact that time would keep going forward despite the greatest resistance I could offer.  

I went inside. We ate dinner without words.

And then we went to sleep. I was certain that I wouldn’t be able to drift off. For the longest time, I was right. 

I don’t remember falling asleep. I just remember waking up.

It felt like I was being watched. So I reached over in the dark and turned on the light, both afraid to leave it off and terrified of what it might reveal. 

I pulled the switch, and I saw nothing. 

I breathed.

Wait. 

I sprang out of bed and glided over to the doorway. There’s something there that wasn’t there before. 

Blood was smudged against the doorframe. It was exactly at the height of my son’s shoulder.

My hands shook.

Then I looked down.

There, lying on the carpet, was [a tiny finger](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).
