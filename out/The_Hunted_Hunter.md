A few years ago, I discovered an abandoned hunting camp deep in an old mining town. It was a place that no one had visited; it seemed to have been left behind years ago, abandoned to the mercy of nature. This camp, accessible only by walking miles down a dirt road, was surrounded by dense forests and felt like a paradise cut off from civilization. But every time I went there, I felt as if I were stepping into another world—a hidden paradise.



The cabin was very old. The doors and windows seemed to barely stay in place. Every time I closed the doors, I would find them open the next morning. I had gotten used to this by now. At first, I thought it was the work of an animal, but over time, these little details began to unsettle me. The cabin didn’t feel like just a part of nature—it felt like a place waiting for something. A home! But whose home?



One evening, I decided to hunt by a creek a few kilometers from the camp. The creek ran through a small valley, formed by water from abandoned mine shafts. The shadows of the tall pine trees made the area much darker than expected. I set up my stand and began waiting quietly. At first, everything seemed normal; birds were chirping, squirrels were darting around in the trees. But without realizing it, the atmosphere had changed.



The sounds had stopped. I couldn’t hear a bird or even the rustling of leaves. Then, I felt a chill. It was as if something was watching me. I had my rifle in hand, but I didn’t feel safe. It felt like I wasn’t the biggest predator in the forest but rather its prey. The darkness was quickly spreading, and the unease inside me was growing. I had planned to stay at the hunting camp that night, but now I couldn’t shake the feeling that this was the wrong decision.



I decided to pack up. Lost in thought, I suddenly felt something moving behind me. It sounded like a branch breaking. I quickly turned and aimed my rifle in that direction, but I saw nothing. The night had fallen much faster than I expected. I had never spent the night here before, but now I understood better. I knew forests were dangerous at night, but I think I had trusted my rifle too much. I had made a mistake. I hadn’t gone that far from the camp. I started walking back toward it, but it felt like everything looked the same. Which way had I come from? When darkness fell, the forest began to resemble a maze. I followed my instincts and had no choice but to keep walking along what I thought was the right path. I had acted recklessly and carelessly. I should have predicted this.



While my mind was preoccupied with these thoughts, I heard something following me. My heart felt like it was about to burst from my chest. I quickly turned around and aimed my rifle in that direction. There was nothing, and the sounds had stopped. Was my mind playing tricks on me?



I tried to continue with caution, determined to reach the camp as quickly as possible. After about 20 or 30 steps, I heard footsteps again, this time closer—maybe 10 meters away. I felt as though I was being followed. In that moment, I could hear my heart pounding so loudly, it felt like it might explode. I scanned the area with my rifle but saw nothing. Still, the sound of footsteps on the ground was undeniable. I didn’t feel like a hunter—I felt like prey. The footsteps lasted for about five minutes before slowly fading away. When the sounds stopped, I wanted to reach the camp immediately and quickened my pace. This path felt familiar; I felt as though I had passed this way before. The hunting camp was just ahead. I arrived at the camp and took a deep breath of relief.



I went inside, gathered some wood from around the area, and started a fire. I had food in my backpack. I locked the door securely and lay down in a corner, waiting for morning. Before going to bed, I checked outside one last time through the window, but I saw nothing. Exhausted, I fell into a deep sleep.



Nothing strange happened during the night. I had expected the thing to follow me, but it didn’t. The night was silent. But the real shock came in the morning. When I opened my eyes, the sun had already risen. And immediately, I noticed something— the door! I was sure I had tightly closed it with a piece of wood the night before. But now, the wood was thrown to the side, and the door was slightly ajar. My skin crawled as I thought about what could have caused it. I didn’t think it was the work of an animal. There was no way. It was as if someone had pushed the door from the outside. But what was strange was that I hadn’t heard a thing. If this had happened during the night, I would have surely heard it. I had been lying in the corner, gripping my rifle. It didn’t make any sense. I couldn’t explain it. Yet, the same thought kept repeating in my mind: What if this is the thing’s den? If so, that would make me an intruder. But there were no sounds, and I had no idea what caused it. Was it an animal, a person, or something else? I didn’t want to stay there for even another minute. I packed my things and left immediately.



I arrived back in the town without incident, jumped into my car, and headed home. I was very curious about what that thing was, but I wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible. I had no idea what had happened there. Was it a person, a wild animal, or something else? The only thing I was certain of was that something had definitely been there. To this day, I thank God that nothing happened to me.



Sometimes I visited these vast, remote places to hunt, but this was the first time anything like this had ever happened. Even though I considered myself a hunter, that day, I definitely wasn’t the hunter. I felt like the hunted. I think it’s time to retire.
