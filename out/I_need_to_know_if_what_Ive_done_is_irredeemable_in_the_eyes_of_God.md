Let me start this question by telling you, I have been pregnant. I’ve blamed many things on so-called “pregnancy brain”, spilling drinks, sleeping in past church service, forgetting to pick my husband up from the airport. These are all completely understandable for a woman that’s going to pop in a few days. I need to assure you that the events unfolding in the past week cannot be explained away by blaming me for the thing formed in my belly. 

My husband works a good enough job, and we were in a good enough place for me to take the last trimester of my pregnancy off of work. I’m normally the youth pastor for the Community of Christ church young women’s groups, leading lessons at 9 AM every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday. I didn’t want to take time off, but my husband insisted I wasn’t able to keep the house clean enough, and dinners were getting sloppy. I’ll admit he was right. Before the pregnancy, I was able to clean both upstairs and downstairs bedrooms, wash the dishes, dust, do laundry, vacuum, mop, clean the fireplace, shop for food, and make dinner. After the morning sickness started kicking in… It became just coming home, vacuuming, throwing together whatever we had in the fridge, and falling asleep. All that to say, I’ve been home for the past month. Hours had blurred into weeks and, for a while, time was only measured by the back pain and a gradually swelling stomach, days leading closer to my due date. That was the case, until only a few days ago. 

I didn’t sleep well last Sunday night. The grandfather clock in the corner of our bedroom moved so loudly, every tick brought about a new wave of nausea. The CPAP machine on my husband was like the buzzing of a thousand tiny insects crawling on my skin. Everytime I closed my eyes, it felt as though fingers were sticking their way through my closed mouth and laying limply inside my throat. My teeth closed tightly and ground themselves. My eyes burned from tears. I finally got up, fully unable to tempt sleep, and sat by the slowly dying fireplace, the only small light in a large, empty home. I felt miserable, and guilty for feeling so miserable. Pregnancy was meant to be a miracle from God, so why did it feel like a punishment? I choked on the tears burning my throat and looked to the only hope I could find when agony felt unending. The Word itself. I looked at the soot falling slowly by my feet, and tried to recall the verse in Isaiah that says “For those who grieve, give them a crown of beauty, not a crown of ashes.” I tried to pray, but instead quickly rushed to the sink to throw up. 

Needless to say, it was difficult to get up on Monday. The exhaustion was palpable, as my husband made known as soon as he saw me get up from bed.

“God, you look horrible, why are your eyes puffy?” The way he looked at me was reminiscent of the way one looks at a spot of mold on bread. He sipped his coffee dryly. 

“Maybe allergies, it is springtime soon after all.”

“Getting closer to the due date, it seems to be harder for you. Difficulty has become the new normal around here, probably more hormones.” This last part, he said in a muttering whisper.

I tidied up in the bathroom, putting a cold rag on my eyes to get rid of any residual evidence of my tears last night. When I came out, my husband was standing in the kitchen, dressed for work, pouring milk into his second cup of coffee. I came up to wish him a good day at work and a kiss, but froze when I saw his newly-filled cup. Inside was a dark, wiggling mass. Six legs pushed the cream into waves and antennae kissed the rim. In a split second, I hit his cup out of his hand and could only look as it shattered onto the linoleum floor.

“What the hell?! Oh, God damn it!” His voice stung at me, I hated when he cursed. 

“I’m sorry! I’m sorry! Ah, I saw a… bug or something in your cup.”

“There wasn’t anything in the cup, I just poured it! You must have… ah fuck, I need to go.”

“I’m sorry, I swear it was right there-” The door hurriedly closing cut my sentence off short, “I love you.” I said to the empty house. 

After the shards were placed in the trash and the coffee scrubbed from the floor, I got dressed and looked at my daily list of chores. Dishes were first. They were always first. I barely knew why I looked at the list anymore, I just did. As I gathered my washing gloves from a drawer, something caught my attention from the very corner of my eye. The soft morning glow normally painted the windows nicely, but today, right in the corner, there was a spider. A small black blotch on a lovely picture. When I turned to face it fully, it had already disappeared from sight. I wondered for a second if there was a web in our room, and if those venomous bites would grace my husband instead of me. My stomach flipped in anxiety as I pushed the thought away. Perhaps, for just today, dusting would be first. 

I was certain I’d cleaned every corner, I’d even checked some of them twice, but there was no trace of the spider. I was checking the last spot I’d cleaned when I saw it again, but this time, there were more. They were big, maybe wolf spiders or brown recluses. Little black pellets just far enough that I couldn’t reach them. I could almost feel their eyes following me, silently laughing at the pitiful housewife’s plight. My heart raced as I felt anger surge into me. The baby kicked. I rushed to the kitchen to grab a bucket and filled it with scalding water and bleach. If I couldn’t brush the creature away, I’d make its living space uninhabitable. I scrubbed the mixture onto the corners of the walls. I would see them skitter in every other room, so I scrubbed harder until I couldn’t see them anymore. It took the whole morning, but when it was finally done, I felt accomplished. I decided I had done so well, I could rest for the latter half of the day. I opened a window to feel the fresh breeze as I lay in bed. No CPAP rumbling made it easy to close my eyes. Rather than the clock’s ticks feeling painful, they lulled me into a soft sort of sleep. We could order out for dinner. 

“Hello? Anyone home?” I awoke to my husband’s tired candor echoing through the hall.

 “Are you okay?” 

My eyes fluttered open. I didn’t answer right away and took time to stretch and take note of how I was feeling. Despite the tenderness of my body, I did feel better. Perhaps sleep is all I really needed. 

“Yeah, I’m in here! Just getting up.” I sat up and saw stars for a moment, blinking my eyes to try and clear them. As my eyes refocused, I looked toward the corner of the room where my husband’s clothes’ hamper lay. Though I had cleaned them not five hours before, there were stains on them. I got up to look as the stains ran red, purple, then white. I felt confused, then quickly fearful. This was only one of the few things I’d done to maintain the house today, and they looked worse than before they were washed. I needed to hide them from my husband’s wandering eyes until I could fix this. He couldn’t know that I had done this. The baby kicked as I grabbed the hamper to place it in the laundry room.

After dinner, the sun had fully set into the earth, and darkness had crept in. My husband had shut the bedroom window when he came back from work, so I opened it after getting my nighttime clothes on. 

My husband poked his head from the bathroom, “Can you keep it closed? The bugs get in when it stays open all night.” 

“No, it’s warm after we had the fire going, I’d like the night air to cool me down. Besides, you said this morning there weren’t any bugs in here.”

“I didn’t say that, I just didn’t think there were any in my coffee. Just, please, keep it closed.”

“There were. There were tons of bugs in here today, they’ll get in whether the window is opened or closed.” My tone had gotten a bit louder than I anticipated.

“Baby… I’ll get a screen for us tomorrow, or we can not have a fire just-” I cut him off,

“No! I’m tired. I’m nauseous. I’m in pain! I’m fucking pregnant! Let me have one thing for me, one choice that I get to make!” I was screaming. The baby kicked and my voice turned into a gnarled groan as I moved. I had never spoken to my husband this way. I never even realized these were thoughts that could get turned into words. These weren’t my words. My body moved like a puppet without my brain actively telling it to do so. My hands were on the window.

“You want it closed? Fine!” With more strength than I had ever wielded, the window slammed shut, wood cracked. “It’s god-damn closed!” 

We were tentative with each other Tuesday morning. My heart pounded and my head felt cloudy as I went through the motions of making breakfast. I tried to keep Ephesians’ 4:31-32  in my thoughts, but it kept slipping away. *Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and… and…*

The baby moved and I lost my thoughts again. I had thrown up twice since five AM. 

“Where are my clothes? I found something that works for today, but I’ll need the rest of them for the week.” I thought I felt a tremor of submerged anger in his voice, my anxiety spiked instantly.

“I… I just didn’t get to drying them. They’re in the washer now.” I lied with a small smile, it felt easier than any other words would have.

“Alright, well, just be sure they’re done today, okay?” He hadn’t recognized I’d lied at all. I was always told by the church that lies were Satan’s words, and God’s true light would always show deceit as it was. I had never lied to my husband before, and he just accepted it as plain truth. My face grew warm with fear, and I turned so he wouldn’t see, blood rushing in my ears. Once I was calm again, I turned but the house was again, empty. 

I could do no more than slowly lower onto the kitchen floor, perplexed. I felt like a different person, out of body from who I was only one week prior. Something had gone wrong with me, not in my brain or body, but in my soul. I felt a deep darkness inside of me, one the pastor’s of my life had warned against again and again. I grabbed my bible from the shelf and immediately sat cross-legged before the fireplace to read. I checked the time, 7:45 AM. I thought that I could begin a routine where I read for an hour in the morning, and an hour at night. I was lost in thought as to how this would change my schedule, when I looked at the clock again, it was 1:13 PM. I blinked and turned to look at the kitchen clock. The same number, 1:13. Was this some kind of trick? Did I really just lose five hours of time sitting and thinking? How?



I looked at the bible and realized I was turned to the book of Psalm. I steeled myself to still read for the hour anyway, when I felt a tingling sensation up my back as though I was being watched. I tried to turn slowly when the fireplace tilted and slided slowly to the right of my vision. My vision melted into a cacophony of whites and yellows as I felt the bible slip from my fingers and my back press onto the floor. The child swam in rotating spirals inside of me as spiders crawled from both corners of my vision to devour me. I turned my head in fear of what I was seeing. My vision faded as I saw my leg and arm shaking viciously. Words were the only thing I could see now. “Behold, the wicked man conceives evil, and is pregnant with mischief.” I tried to speak, but couldn’t.

I awoke in a puddle, breathing heavily. The air felt thick and putrid, so that I couldn’t fill my lungs as I gasped. I knew that days had passed, and yet here I was still lying on the floor. I was able to bring myself up, knowing the Lord gave me a sign. A high-pitched chirping joined the ringing in my ears, as though the birds outside had been replaced by hateful simulacrums of God’s creations. Bugs covered every surface before I could look at them, the small black specks made my once beautiful home look unlivable. Insects make one unclean, make the home a sinful place. I had been happy once, even hopeful about this child, raising him as God tells us to raise all our children. But thinking back to the past week, every time I had a sinful thought, every second I felt angry or hateful, there the baby was. Vengefulness at the spiders, lying to my husband, screaming at him, in each moment the baby kicked and writhed. It gained pleasure from my sinful acts, gained power from my weakness. A good mother would never feel lonely in the presence of her own child, therefore, the creature living in me could not be a child of my making. This thing is the difference in my life that has changed me from pious to evil. So, as God would have me do, I decided to rid myself of all worldly things and turn to Him. 

The door opened and my husband stepped through, seeing me in my clarity. 

“Don’t be afraid!” I stood and walked to him, “I know you’ve forsaken me these last few days, but we can still be a whole family again.” My voice was quickening, unwavering. I knew what I needed to say but I couldn’t hear it over the noise.

He took my wrist and said something. I wrenched myself from his grasp as I felt a dawn of realization. The words I had read before my collapse. 

“You. You must be the wicked man I was warned of! You impregnated me with evil, and left me for days to give birth to a demon!” My hands groped for the knife block behind me near the kitchen sink. My husband was shouting, his words were only an addition to the loud ringing in my head, more noise I needed to block out to do what the Lord was leading me towards. 

My husband looked frightened as my hands touched steel, but as quickly as I brought the knife into view, I turned it on myself. Cold sharpness glided through my stomach easily, shredding through clothes. The point of my pelvis to the underneath of my breasts was open, and I could see the back of the creature through my wound. Blood flowed over its body and the agony was ceaseless as I tried to rip it out. The placenta fell to the ground, cut by the blade, and slapped wetly at my feet. I couldn’t grip the child, slipping into unconsciousness, my fingers grew numb. The demon’s head turned out of my open body, its eyes opening in the darkest red as blood ran from its open mouth. The maw gaped wide and the tongue danced like fire, speaking languages I knew all too well were chants to stop my doing of the Lord’s will. Knowing I had limited time, my hands trembled as I tried to find the point where I could stab the body to end it. Every pump of my heart made my sparks fly in front of me which grew into a haze of white light surrounding my body. Finally, all grew quiet in the heavenly glow, the ground rushed upwards and I heard a thud and felt myself lose all breath in a dulled whimper.

The doctors say it’s only a miracle that I’m alive, that some angel must have me in their wings. I still can’t speak clearly, that part of my brain may never heal, so I speak to most by typing on this computer and having it read aloud. My memory is fine, they seem to think I have some form of “dementia” but, as you can see, every memory I wrote has been recollected clearly. I think my husband has been in contact with them, and decided to blame my “pregnancy” for this. I hear them talking of brain damage, nerve damage, and of the chimney not being cleaned enough. I can’t keep listening to this. The police have come in, but most times I pretend to be unconscious, sometimes I really am. They speak in hushed tones to one another, almost as if they’re afraid of what I may do once I wake. A woman’s voice said that I didn’t look as though I was capable of committing such an evil deed. Evil. That stuck with me for hours afterwards. Family hasn’t visited since I found myself here. My husband is gone, I couldn’t tell you where. All I can think of is I John 1:7: “But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his son cleanses us from all sin.”

I need help. I can feel the Lord has left me since I’ve been here. Can his blood cleanse this? My head is still ringing with the awful sounds of the baby’s wails and my husband’s screams. I have to know, am I still saved? Is what I did sinful? I can’t ask these people, they don’t know anything of God, but to those out there who are truly saved, please tell me what I did was right. Tell me that God still loves me, and that this is only one of his many tests. Please. Anyone.
