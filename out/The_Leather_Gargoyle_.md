pt. 1

Fifteen miles north of Indianapolis, Carmel stretches out—a suburb of spotless facades, where lawns are always perfect and time crawls like molasses. The clocktower at the center of town—resonant, precise—chimes every hour, a mechanical reminder of the beige lives unfolding beneath its shadow. Carmelite drones shuffle in and out of their homes, roundabouts spinning in endless loops like the gears of some corporate mind machine. Suburbia, perfected. White-collar monotony, minivans at the ready, PTA meetings with martinis on the side. The air smells of freshly mowed grass and sterile, unspoken desires.

Carmel was designed to be the antithesis of Gary. Gary, that other Indiana city. The one with the headlines—shootings, gang wars, fires licking at the rotting foundations of a place too far gone to fix. Carmel’s news is cleaner. A house fire, a dog caught in a tree. The kind of shit they can handle. Smooth, controlled. Every lawn neatly trimmed, every mailbox just so. Life in 

It started, like all things in this world, at the edges—on the periphery. A story that no one could believe, because they knew better than to believe. Better to laugh it off, to let it float away like smoke on a breeze. But it wouldn’t float. It hung heavy, thick, like the scent of impending doom.

August 2006. 9:17 PM.

Jamaal Thornton—lifetime Carmelite, native to the suburb, raised on the same streets, walking the same sidewalks—first saw the man. It wasn’t supposed to be anything. A casual evening walk, routine. But that night, the air felt wrong, didn’t it? The air was thick, not just with the usual suburban scents, but with something else. The man was out there, somewhere.

Jamaal saw him just two blocks from home. A figure. Tall. Slender. Too confident. It wasn’t the outfit, no, but the movement. Something twisted. The knees were wrong, backward—unnatural he walked with an inverted bow-leg.

Military boots—clicking, clicking, clicking like some machine that had forgotten how to stop. 

Jamaal walked faster. The figure mirrored him. Always. A step behind, then a step ahead, then behind again. The clicking, a metronome, like a clock ticking down to something—

And then—the sound. God, the sound. A snapping, rhythmic, like the pop of joints cracking. Whistling. 

Not just any whistling, no, but the whistling of someone lost in a dream. Not a song. The tune was that of a homunculus doo-opp group . The kind  that burrows into your skull, rattles around until you can’t tell if it’s in your head or in the air.

Jamaal turned down his street. He didn’t look back—no, not at first. Not until he reached the driveway.

There. The figure. Standing still. Just standing. Like a statue. Silent now. The whistling gone. But the snap-snap-snap—that rhythm, that tapping noise, louder now, closer now, slow, deliberate, as if the world itself had slowed down. Like time was stopping for him, or maybe he was stopping it.

Jamaal fumbled with his keys. His hands—oh, they were shaking. His heart, his chest—pounding. He turned. The man’s lips curled just so. Not a smile, no. A grimace. A smirk. Something darker. And the man—he snapped again, slowly, rhythmically, as if counting down the seconds to his inevitable arrival.

Jamaal slammed the door, bolted it shut. Inside, he watched. Watched through the window, through the blinds, through the glass—his mind cracking, splitting, unraveling as the figure stood there, unmoving, under the streetlamp’s sickly yellow glow. He could still hear it. The snap. Over and over, like a clock that never stops. Never stops.

And then, just like that, the figure turned. Walked away. Boots clicking. Fading. The rhythm dissolving into the night.

The Ball Gag Gargoyle has arrived

Forty minutes after the encounter, Jamaal sat in his third-story apartment, shaking like a leaf caught in a windstorm. The events of the night spun through his brain like a broken record, the snap, the whistle, over and over again, reverberating in the hollow, suffocating silence. He almost let himself believe it was done—maybe it was just some twisted soul wandering the streets, the kind of creature that walked in the shadow of nightmares, but he could almost hear it. That laugh.

A low, guttural cackle, like a voice from the other side of reason.

Jamaal froze. It wasn’t coming from the street. No. The laugh… it was up here. Higher. At the level of his windows, floating in the air like a phantom tongue licking the night sky. His heart hammered in his chest, thumping, drumming, a tattoo of fear. He edged closer to the window, hands trembling, fingers clutching at the curtains like they might hold him together.

Nothing. Just shadows. The trees swaying, the moonlight dripping down like cold sweat.

Then it hit him. The sound wasn’t below. It was *above.* *Above.*

His legs kicked into action before his mind could catch up, locking windows with the urgency of a man fleeing from a beast. Hands shaking, fumbling with latches, pulling blinds down like he could block out the world itself. By the time he reached his bedroom, the adrenaline surged, drowning out all reason. A pulse, an animal instinct thrumming through his veins.

He reached the last window. He went to lock it, but his eyes—his *eyes*—drifted outside.

What he saw could not be real. It couldn’t be.

A figure perched on the branch. A creature. Not human. Not anymore. Dressed in black leather so tight, it seemed to suck the life out of him, the suit reflecting the moonlight with an unnatural sheen. Wings. Wings that *should not have been there.* Huge, grotesque things stretching out from his back like they were made to tear the night itself apart. A ball gag—no, not just any ball gag—engraved with the words *RUB IT SLOW* in old Gothic script, shining like a curse. The man’s face was half-obscured, but his eyes—God, his eyes—black holes pulling Jamaal in, sucking him down, down into some bottomless pit.

Jamaal’s breath hitched in his throat. He stumbled backward, a gasp escaping him, the curtains yanked shut in a panic. But it was too late. Curiosity, that bastard, clawed at him. He peeked again.

Nothing. The branch was empty. Vanished.

His heart jackhammered, and before he could think, he was grabbing his phone, dialing the police. Carmel’s finest—laughable, if you asked anyone who didn’t look like him. Minorities? They don’t get responses. Jamaal knew the game. He knew the score. Crimes like his weren’t worth investigating. Not when your skin was the wrong shade.

Still, he told them everything. The man’s movements, the whistling, the snapping, the way their eyes had met, locked. It was all there, every detail. The officers were polite, all right, and respectful—on the surface. But beneath it, the skepticism crawled like a cold snake through the air. The one officer—young, smooth-faced—smirked at the mention of the ball gag engraving.

“We’ll keep an eye out,” they said, their voices just loud enough to drown out the doubt dripping through their teeth. A surveillance patrol, they assured him. But Jamaal could see it in their eyes.

They weren’t listening. Not really.

Hours later, as the night thickened like tar around him, the cackling returned. Louder. Deeper. More guttural. It wasn’t a sound from this world. No. It was the sound of something old, something savage, playing with its prey.

Jamaal clutched his blanket, his body rigid, his mind on the edge of snapping. He tried to block it out, to push it away like a bad memory, but the laugh kept growing louder, crawling through the walls, a sound that scraped at the very bones of the night. He couldn't move. Couldn’t scream. It was getting closer.

Jamaal, shaking like a cornered animal, gathered whatever scraps of courage he had left. He moved toward the window, fingers clawing at the blinds. With a violent yank, they tore open.

And there he was.

The gimp.

Perched on a branch so impossibly thin it should have snapped under the weight of logic. Inches from the glass, like some grotesque mockery of nature, he sat there, his wings stretching wide in the dim moonlight, casting long, unnatural shadows that crawled across the walls like they had a mind of their own. But something new. Something worse. The man—if he could be called that—had exposed himself. His genitals hung in the open, grotesquely displayed against the gleam of his leather suit, like a sick joke.

Jamaal’s eyes locked with the creature’s. Those eyes. A color no man should ever see. Ice-blue, glowing with that strange, hollow detachment, like the whole scene was beneath him.

A wave of nausea twisted in Jamaal’s gut. He wanted to scream, to tear his mind away from the horror, but it came out—a guttural sound, a wail, like a banshee caught in the throat. He scrambled for his phone, fingers slipping over the buttons, dialed 911 in a frenzy of panic.

The line connected, but the gimp… The gimp tilted his head. Just so. A mockery. Then he waved, slow and deliberate, a gesture more fitting for a dying puppet than a man.

The gimp moved like something from a nightmare. A ballet dancer, maybe, if that ballet had been twisted out of shape, limbs stretching like rubber, unnatural, grotesque. With a graceful, haunting fluidity, he climbed down the tree, disappearing into the dark like smoke in the wind.

The cops came. Again. A repeat of the script. Jamaal, wild-eyed and desperate, described the gimp’s sickening, deliberate motions. His detailed account only fed their skepticism, fed their disbelief. “Unsubstantiated,” they wrote. Another name, another file, another dead lead. Surveillance patrols? Half-hearted, at best.

A month later, Jamaal was dead. The coroner’s verdict? Suicide. But the rumors spread through the cracked windows of Carmel, whispering through the backyards and HOA meetings. Some said it was the gimp. That his shadow had reached into Jamaal’s mind and twisted it until there was no escape. Others said there was something darker at play, a murder dressed up as tragedy.

No evidence. No clues. Nothing to tie it to the *thing* that haunted him. But those few who had listened—those few who had believed—knew. They knew the truth, as sure as the sun rises and sets.

The Ball Gag Gargoyle wasn’t finished.

**Sightings**

Doug Frawley was a man of routine. He had one constant in his life: the smell of stale coffee and the rhythmic scrape of his mop against cold linoleum. It was simple work, solitary work. Doug had been the overnight janitor at the AT&T building in downtown Indianapolis for years, the kind of gig that kept you on the fringe of everything, a shadow in a concrete maze. He didn’t mind. People, after all, were a hassle. It was the quiet that kept him sane, the gentle drone of the fluorescent lights above, the hum of the air conditioning kicking in every once in a while. It was just him, the building, and the endless expanse of glass windows that reflected back the city's sickly glow.

But that night, something happened. Something that didn’t belong in the rhythm of his world.

It was a sticky, humid evening, the kind that made the air feel thick, oppressive, almost alive, pushing down on you. Doug was cleaning the glass windows on the 38th floor—high enough to feel above the city, but not enough to escape it. As he reached for the squeegee, wiping away the smear of the last storm, something caught his eye. A silhouette. It was perched on a rooftop, perched against the glow of the skyline like some grotesque monument to a lost god. A gargoyle, he thought, squinting through the glass. A piece of modern art, maybe—some eccentric millionaire's latest indulgence. It wasn’t unheard of. But this was Indianapolis, not New York or Los Angeles. "Maybe someone just had a wild idea," Doug muttered to himself, trying to dismiss the strangeness as easily as he dismissed the hum of the fluorescent lights above.

But then the figure moved.

At first, it was a twitch—a slight shift that could have been a trick of the light, the wind, or Doug’s sleep-deprived mind. But it wasn’t a trick. The figure sprang into motion. It didn’t just sway like a statue in the wind—it *pranced*. Massive wings, black and leathery, unfolded with a noise that shouldn’t have been possible. They flared open, jagged, bat-like, catching the glint of streetlight as they beat the air with a sickeningly precise rhythm. The thing—if you could call it that—moved like a deranged ballerina, graceful in a way that made the hairs on Doug’s neck stand up. He blinked hard, rubbed his eyes. He’d been working the overnight shift for six years straight. Maybe the exhaustion was getting to him, twisting the world into something he couldn’t trust. His hand gripped the squeegee, knuckles turning white. Surely, this was a hallucination. No one could move like that.

But the thing didn’t care about Doug’s fragile sense of reality. It leapt, twirled, its leather-clad body gleaming under the lights, too surreal, too *wrong*. The wings—spiky, angular, and *pointless*—fluttered, as if it were testing the air, preparing for takeoff. It was too fluid, too precise. A dancer, yes, but a dancer with an agenda—a twisted purpose that Doug couldn't fathom. Each movement carried a weight, a rhythm that made the air around it feel like it was breathing, alive, suffocating. It wasn’t just some eccentric artist’s creation. No, this was something else entirely.

Doug stood frozen. His world had splintered for a moment, cracked down the middle, and this—this *thing*—was standing on the other side of the break, laughing. He squeezed his eyes shut, praying it was the exhaustion. But when he opened them again, the figure was still there, still dancing, still moving in that *unholy* ballet.

He backed away, the squeegee slipping from his hand and clattering to the floor. He couldn’t breathe. The room felt too small. The walls closed in. The lights flickered above. He turned, eyes darting back to the glass. It was gone.

Just like that, it had vanished into the humid night.

Doug didn’t know what he saw. Hell, he didn’t even know if he *believed* what he saw. But the feeling—that gnawing, acidic feeling that something *was wrong*—lingered in his bones long after the shift was over. He never spoke of it. He never told anyone. People would say it was stress. It was always the stress. But stress doesn’t make you see *that*. And Doug wasn’t the only one.

No.

For a brief, terrifying moment, Doug was sure the figure locked eyes with him through the window. His stomach lurched, and a cold sweat broke out across his skin. It was a ridiculous thought—how could anyone on a rooftop dozens of feet away possibly see him? But there was no mistaking it: the figure halted mid-prance, its head tilting slowly, as if it had just become aware of Doug’s presence. Then, with chilling deliberation, it raised a gloved hand in a slow, taunting wave.

Doug’s blood ran cold.

His instincts screamed at him to look away, to turn and flee, but his body refused to obey. He was rooted to the spot, trapped between fear and disbelief. He watched as the creature resumed its bizarre display, moving with unnerving grace and confidence. It strutted along the edge of the rooftop like a performer, an exaggerated villain surveying its kingdom. At one point, it even struck a pose, one hand on its hip, the other outstretched toward the downtown skyline. Its fingers pointed dramatically as if commanding the financial heart of Indianapolis to bend to its will.

Doug’s breath caught in his throat. His mind tried to reject the absurdity of it all—this wasn’t real, it couldn’t be. It was just exhaustion, just too many sleepless nights in a building full of ghosts and echoing silence. But the evidence was right there, mocking him from across the glass.

With a tremble, Doug stumbled away from the window. His body was on autopilot, hands scrambling for something to steady himself, but his mind was already splintering, grappling with a horrifying truth he wasn’t ready to face. He muttered to himself, trying to will the sight away. "Gotta lay off the energy drinks," he whispered, as though the caffeine could explain away what he’d seen.

But deep down, Doug knew. He *knew* it wasn’t a figment of his imagination. No, what he saw was real. Too real. And there was nothing he could do about it.

Doug never came forward. He kept his sighting to himself, rationalizing it as exhaustion-induced hallucinations—the kind that haunt the lonely corridors of a skyscraper in the dead of night. He was alone, after all, and what did he have to prove? A janitor had no business questioning reality when it slipped through the cracks.

But the sightings didn’t end there.

Others started talking.

A woman named Carla Henderson, an assistant manager at a nearby café, was the next to report an encounter. It wasn’t far from Doug’s vantage point—her apartment window overlooked the same stretch of rooftops where the gargoyle had been prancing. She hadn’t seen much at first, just the flicker of a shadow against the skyline. But then, late one evening, she saw it in full: the leather-clad figure, with wings that seemed to ripple like broken wings of a bat, dark and jagged against the lights of the city. It had the same haunting poise, the same absurd theatrics, but Carla was struck by something else—something far more chilling.

The creature wasn’t alone.

Standing next to it, as if in some twisted communion, was another figure—taller, leaner, but equally grotesque, wearing a black mask that obscured its face. This figure didn’t move with the same fluid grace as the winged one; instead, it stood perfectly still, watching, waiting. Carla couldn’t shake the feeling that the masked figure was *aware* of her. It didn’t perform for the audience, but it knew someone was watching.

Carla’s hands trembled as she reported it. Her co-workers dismissed her story—too many late nights, too many double shifts—but the unease lingered. Was she the only one seeing this thing? Or were others, too, beginning to question what they thought they knew about their own city?

each account more absurd, more horrifying than the last. Some said they saw the creature perched atop a building, staring down at them with cold, unblinking eyes. Others claimed to have heard its wings flapping in the dead of night, as if it were circling the city, waiting for something, or someone.

And then there were the whispers—the ones that made you second-guess your own sanity. People claimed to have seen the creature in the middle of the day, strolling through parks or standing outside of local businesses, just out of sight, hidden in plain view. The stories blended together, interwoven with rumors of strange symbols carved into buildings and chilling graffiti painted on alley walls—sickeningly familiar symbols, ones that seemed to crawl out from the deepest, forgotten corners of the world.



The Ball Gag Gargoyle had been watching—and it was ready to make its move.



**Pine Cones and the Ritual**

It started innocuously enough, as these things often do—a ripple in the fabric of normalcy, too subtle for anyone to notice until it was already unraveling. Around two o’clock, while the men argued over charcoal versus propane and the kids filled the air with shrieks of sugar-fueled chaos, a strange man appeared at the edge of the cul-de-sac.

He was walking funny. Bent knees, stiff arms, snapping his fingers like a metronome wound too tight. Snap. Step. Snap. Step. His head bobbed with the rhythm, a grotesque parody of a man trying to catch a beat that only he could hear. He didn’t look at anyone directly, but his eyes darted—fast, birdlike—scanning the yards and driveways with a predatory curiosity.

“Who the hell is that?” someone asked, voice low, as if saying it too loud might invite the man closer.

“Neighborhood weirdo,” Frank muttered, flipping a burger with too much force. “Every street’s got one.”

But Tommy Dellarocco knew better. Something about the man was wrong, and not just wrong in the way people get when they’re cracked by life. This was *wrong-wrong*, the kind that itches at the base of your skull, whispering that you’re standing too close to the edge.

The man snapped his fingers one last time, spun in a jerky half-circle, and shuffled off toward the woods at the edge of the park. The party moved on, the strange figure filed away under Things to Joke About Later, after a few more beers had taken the edge off.

By evening, he was all but forgotten. The beer had flowed freely, drowning the strange vision in a haze of small talk and potato salad. But Tony Dellarocco couldn’t shake the image. Something about the figure’s gait had wormed its way into her brain, a greasy smear on the fabric of her thoughts.

She wandered to the edge of the yard, the noise of the barbecue fading behind her. A pine tree loomed over her like an old god, its branches heavy with sap and shadow. She leaned against the rough bark, savoring the quiet, the faint scent of resin and earth.

And then the pine cone hit her.

It wasn’t a gentle fall. It smacked her square on the head, a sharp, humiliating thunk that echoed through her skull. She looked up, her hand pressed to the sore spot, ready to curse the tree for its betrayal.

That’s when she saw him.

The Gargoyle.

He was crouched in the branches, his body coiled like a spring, his leather skin gleaming in the last light of the day. His wings stretched out behind him, glistening with something wet and viscous that dripped onto the pine needles below. His head tilted, the ball gag in his mouth gleaming like a sick joke.

Tony froze. Her breath hitched in her throat, her mind racing in a hundred directions but landing nowhere. She wanted to scream, to run, but her body refused to obey.

The Gargoyle moved with slow, deliberate grace his eyes blue and soft with a murderous boredom,

With one hand he ripped another pine cone from the tree and bagn cradling it like a sacred object, and began to rub it against his chest in slow, sensual circles. The leather squeaked faintly, the sound grotesque in the stillness.

It wasn’t random. There was a rhythm to it, a ritual. The Gargoyle’s movements were hypnotic, his body swaying like a snake charmed by its own music. He rubbed the pine cone faster, then slower, then faster again, his head lolling to one side as if caught in some ecstatic trance.

Mystified by the pine cone ritual, tony failed to notice until it was almost too late the gargoyle had his gentals exposed.

And then, with a guttural moan muffled by the gag, he launched himself into the air.

Tony watched, paralyzed, as he flew through the trees—not with the elegance of a bird, but with the wild, chaotic energy of a monkey swinging from branch to branch. His wings flapped in spasmodic bursts, propelling him forward in unpredictable arcs. He didn’t fly so much as ricochet, his body a black blur against the orange-pink sky.

The sound of snapping branches and creaking wood filled the air as he disappeared into the canopy, leaving behind only the faint smell of leather and something rancid.

Tony stood under the tree, her heart hammering in her chest, the pine cone still lying at her feet. She stared at it, half expecting it to start moving, to sprout legs and scuttle away.

The party behind her was still going, the laughter and music a cruel contrast to the surreal nightmare she had just witnessed. She took a shaky step back, then another, her eyes never leaving the tree.

By the time she rejoined the group, she wasn’t sure if she’d imagined the whole thing. But the grease stain on her shirt—where the pine cone had briefly brushed against her—told her otherwise.

  
(a never ending conspiracy that has more layers than a volcanic onion)
