If you read this, DO NOT try to find me. She is in the shadows, watching with burning eyes. Anywhere and everywhere. No matter how far I go, or where I am, she is there. Watching.    
  
I’ll try to explain what happened.  
  
It started with a walk in the woods. I usually go there to clear my head, but this time was a bit different. Life has been difficult. My father, the only consistent figure in my life, passed away a few months before. My relationship with my girlfriend broke down. I was working as much as I could but I could never keep up with my debts. Life was becoming a landslide. I had the intention to end it.  
  
What better place than the woods? It was a beautiful day. I went for a walk with a backpack filled with rope and a pre-tied noose. I found a tree off the beaten path I could tie myself to. I expected a dog walker would find me at some point. They always seem to find bodies.   
  
I was securing the noose to a branch when the puppy found me. I didn’t recognise the breed. It had shaggy black fur with a faint silver ridge along its spine and beautiful burning amber eyes. It looked up at me and I felt ashamed. It seemed too young to be walking free in the woods, it must have been lost.   
  
I untied the noose and climbed down the tree. The pup stood waiting, its tail wagging. I knelt beside it and gave it a stroke on the head. He had no collar. He could have been lost, or abandoned.   
  
“Alright boy, what are you doing out here?” I asked. He wagged his tail and licked at my hand.  
  
There was some movement amongst the bushes. I called out to see if an owner was nearby but got no response. The weather began to turn, heavy grey clouds quickly filled the sky and thunder rumbled through the trees. The air became thick with the storm’s energy.    
  
“We should get you somewhere safe.” I decided. Taking the pup back to my car.  
  
That was when I started to notice things were strange.   
  
The rain began to come down, drumming heavily on my car roof. The once beautiful day became dark. I decided to drive towards a vets I knew locally. If they couldn’t take him in they could surely suggest someone who would. They can check for a chip and maybe find the owner. I put the puppy in the passenger seat of my car.  
  
As I drove out of the car park a flash of lighting showed something amongst the trees. A silhouette of a deer or a large dog maybe, barely distinguishable from the shadows. I drove on and with the next lightning flash the creature was close, just off the side of the road. It could have been a man, or it was something four-legged but facing me. Two embers ignited in what could have been its eyes. I didn’t feel like waiting to find out what was watching me. I sped up and pulled away onto the main road.  
  
As I drove the pup fidgeted in excitement, sniffing at the seats, and playfully mouthing at my hands as I tried to hold him in place. I went to the vets only to find them closed. I searched my phone for dog rescue homes. There was nothing nearby.   
  
“Looks like you’re coming home with me, boy.” I told him.   
  
I think he looked happy about that. Maybe I was projecting. Lightning flashed again. If I was going to take him home I thought I had better stock up on some food. It would require dipping into my overdraft but at this moment I didn’t particularly care about anything but this dog. I stopped at my local shop and left him inside the car. At least I thought I did. While I was at the checkout buying a single tin of dog food and some treats he appeared yapping at my feet.  
  
“You can’t bring dogs in here!” The miserable, sleep-deprived shopkeeper snapped at me.  
  
“I.. didn’t… sorry!” I stumbled back.   
  
I scooped him up under my arm and went back to the car with my shopping. The car was locked. He must have snuck out before I shut the door. I was sure he was still inside when I locked it, I saw him through the window, but I must have been wrong. I couldn’t claim to be in the clearest state of mind given my original plans for the day. I bundled him back in the car with the shopping. Despite not necessarily being a good boy, I told him he was and tore open the bag to give him a treat.  
  
As I started my car there was another flash of lightning. It cast a shadow over the road where the thing stood, watching me. Eyes burning. It was getting closer, close enough to make me afraid. I floored it, pulling away from the shop and into the road without even looking, my tires spinning to find traction. I checked my rear view mirror as I sped away to see if the shadow creature gave chase, but I saw nothing.   
  
I looked forward and with a flash of lightning it was there in the middle of the road. Two eyes burning bright as fire hovered in the shadow of an old oak tree. The creature was at one with the darkness, appearing only in the shadow of the flickering lightning. In the brief moments of shadow I could just make out faint wisps of an eerie pale glow weaving through the void. My eyes were unable to make sense of the shapes. I jumped on the brakes, forcing the car behind me to screech to a halt. The puppy tumbled forward into the footwell with a yelp.  
  
“What are you doing, dickhead?!” a driver shouted from his car behind me.  
  
I ignored him and helped the puppy back onto the seat. He wagged in excitement. I looked around for the beast but there was no sign of it. The lightning had stopped, the rain was lighter now and the dark clouds were rolling away as quickly as they came, letting the daylight through. The road before me was clear. The driver behind sounded his horn. He didn’t see anything.   
  
“Are you ok boy?” I asked. He seemed unconcerned about anything that was happening in the world, “We should get home.”  
  
I drove through town wary of every shadow. I felt like I was being watched, but I couldn’t see whatever was watching me. Every flicker of light or patch of darkness put me on edge. Car headlights reflected off the wet road and cast images into my mind. I began to doubt my sanity.   
  
I was heading home for shelter and safety, but I had never felt safe there before. I lived in a room in a draughty old red brick Victorian house riddled with damp. I was overdue on rent to the landlady, Mrs Whittaker, who was a harsh old woman hoarding money to take to the grave. She didn’t allow noise or visitors, she certainly didn’t allow pets. Encountering her with the puppy in my arms was as terrifying as whatever was stalking me because at least I knew Mrs Whittaker was real. But there I was, the noose still in my backpack, I just needed to help out this dog before I could go back to my original plan. Why should I care about anything else?  
  
By the time I had got home the clouds had mostly parted and we were getting the last of the afternoon sunshine. The daylight put me at some ease. I picked up the pup and its food and rushed into the house, hoping to get upstairs before Mrs Whittaker noticed me.   
  
Too slow.   
  
She appeared behind me in the gloomy hallway as I was halfway up the stairs.  
  
“Shouldn’t you be at work?” She asked in a tone that was searching for a problem.  
  
“Day off.” I replied without turning, hoping she hadn’t spotted the puppy.  
  
“Oh…” she said with suspicion, “I hope it’s a paid day off. Rent is due.”  
  
“Of course.” I said, and continued walking upstairs.  
  
“What is that you’ve got there?” She asked.   
  
I turned to face her, resigned to revealing the puppy. But when I turned the puppy wasn’t in my arms. I looked around at the floor but saw no sign of it. Mrs Whittaker had a ghostly appearance, her grey hair and pale face were monochrome in the drab darkness of the hallway. She looked at me impatiently. I eventually replied, “Nothing… just some shopping.”  
  
“Nothing too expensive I hope! You need to pay my rent!” she snapped.  
  
Then I saw it again. Behind Mrs Whittaker in the shadows lurked the beast. Its flaming eyes drew up behind her. The shadow grew, almost submerging her in a shadowy void. For a moment I hoped it would pull her in.  
  
Mrs Whittaker said something but I didn’t listen to her, concerned only with the spectre in the shadows. I turned and rushed to the bottom of the stairs, Mrs Whittaker recoiled from me. I slapped at the light switch and the hallway brightened, the creature disappeared. Then I ran back up the stairs to my room.   
  
I slammed the door behind me and put the light on, then rushed over my debris of dirty washing and litter to the window to pull the curtains open, exposing what remained of the day to erase any darkness from the bedroom. I put the puppy on the floor and suddenly felt disgusted with myself. The room was filthy. Dirty dishes were stacked on the bedside table, every surface was caked with dust, I could barely see the carpet for my mess. This wasn’t a place fit for this dog to live. I had the immediate urge to tidy up. I cleared a small space in the corner and emptied half of the tin of dog food into one of my clean bowls. While the puppy ate I tidied up.  
  
Then I heard stomping up the stairs. Mrs Whittaker shouted out, “What is wrong with you!? Why have you put the light on, that is my electricity you’re wasting!” She then banged at my door. “Have you got the light on in there too!? Open up!”  
  
“Sorry…” I replied, “I just need some light. I’m… tidying.”  
  
“You!? Ha!” This was the closest I had ever come to hearing her laugh, “Turn it off now, or you can move out!”  
  
“Please, just leave me alone for a bit.” I replied.  
  
She banged the door again, “Off! Now!” When she noticed the light remained on she said, “Fine, I'll sort it myself.” and stomped back downstairs.  
  
The puppy was eating happily. I found a half-full bottle of water and emptied it into a small dish for him to drink. I watched him while sitting on the edge of my bed. When the puppy had his fill he came over and sat by my feet. I lifted him onto the bed and he got comfortable, he rested his head on my thigh and his amber eyes looked up at me. He began to sleep as I stroked the top of his head and it seemed at this moment we were both content.   
  
Then the light went out. Mrs Whittaker must have switched my electricity off at the fusebox. The fading daylight from outside the window was not enough to extinguish the shadow in the corner by the wardrobe. Flaming eyes slowly appeared from nowhere as if the darkness was a doorway. The monster was in my room.  
  
I picked up the puppy and edged away along the bed. Soon my back was against the wall and I had nowhere else to go. The fiery eyes grew closer, ethereal whisps danced in the darkness until my eyes could finally make sense of their shape and movement. I could see a vague outline of four limbs walking, hackles raised down its back, a muzzle snarled at me, dripping with drool. The great hound became clearer beyond its spectral hue. Bigger than any dog I had ever seen. It had a pale streak down its back like the puppy. It padded beyond the shadow to show thick, shaggy black fur. I was ready for it to pounce at any moment. It gave a deep guttural growl exposing great white fangs.  
  
While I recoiled helplessly the puppy squirmed free and clambered down my legs to the floor, the ridge of pale fur down its back shone white with an ethereal glow. It ran over to the great beast which never broke its gaze away from me. Then, as if breaking from a trance, it looked down at the pup, lowering its snout towards it.   
  
“No!” I shouted. I couldn’t let it devour the helpless thing, “No!” I shouted again. I picked up the lamp from my bedside table in a pathetic attempt to brandish any sort of weapon. The beast looked at me with contempt, then looked back down at the pup. It lowered its snout, and licked it across its face. The puppy brushed up against the monster and wagged its tail. The great hound inspected its pup with sniffs and licks of maternal care. The mother then picked the puppy up by the scruff of its neck and they walked into the shadow, fading into wisps of spectral light before disappearing.  
  
The puppy appears every so often to play, no matter where I am. Home, work, even when I was in the police interview room. The mother is never far away. They usually disappear back to the shadows before anyone else sees them. Usually. Those who have seen them do not live to tell about it.  
  
I know they think they are protecting me, but they didn’t need to kill Mrs Whittaker. I didn’t notice for a few days until the smell crept through the floorboards. At her door I heard the buzzing of flies. I called the police to break into her room and they found her, mauled. The coroner ruled it was a dog attack, although they could not explain how a dog got in and out of the locked room.  
  
The mother never fully comes out of the shadows, but she watches me. In the corner of my eye I'll catch its fiery gaze. I don’t think she means me harm, but I’ve seen what she can do, it is hard not to be afraid. The puppy is a good boy, but they are both over-protective. I have seen her eyes appear whenever anyone angers or upsets me. I know she intends to kill them. Death seems like nothing to her.   
  
My supervisor at work was found dead in the stockroom after he criticised the time I had taken off work due to my mental health. I admit, it got to me. He was mauled, like Mrs Whittaker. The hounds also appeared after my ex-girlfriend came over demanding ‘her’ TV back. She forced her way in. I was so desperate for her to leave I was going to give her my TV, but it wasn’t about the TV, she was just insistent on arguing. She didn’t make it out of the house. I tried to stop them.   
  
After the deaths I had to run. I am innocent, I swear it. But if the police turn up to arrest me I can’t imagine what the hounds will do to them.   
  
I have found somewhere secluded to live, I won’t say where, but it seems mostly safe and I'm content with a simple life off the grid. I have had occasional trouble. Some men tried to break into the caravan where I have been staying. That didn’t last long. I had to bury their bodies in a ditch one night. The dogs were just protecting me.  
  
At least I’m not suicidal anymore. What does it say about me that I’m now willing to live even when I’m such a risk to others? As long as people leave me alone they will be safe. I can’t control what comes from the shadows.
