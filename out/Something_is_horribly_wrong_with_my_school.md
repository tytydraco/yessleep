Something is horribly wrong with my school

I moved to a small town in Virginia last week. Quiet place. One gas station, two diners, and trees that stretch so high they block out the sky. I needed the quiet, after everything. After the incident.

The school was the only thing I had lined up before I got here. Pine Hollow Academy. I found it online, tuition-free, promised “focused individualized education” and had an old-looking crest with Latin on it. That was all I needed. I enrolled through a clunky website, got a confirmation email, and packed my bags.

But when I asked the old woman at the gas station where Pine Hollow was, she just blinked at me. “We don’t got a school by that name, hun.” “Maybe you’re thinking of Old Mill High?” the cashier offered. “That’s the only one we got left after the district cutbacks.” I showed them the email. The crest. Even the little ID card they’d mailed me. They just stared. “Never heard of it.” I figured it was just a misunderstanding. The directions they sent were weird — GPS didn’t help. I ended up following a winding backroad into the woods, further than seemed reasonable. Eventually, I saw a rusted sign: PINE HOLLOW ACADEMY — KNOWLEDGE IN DARKNESS.

The building was old. Colonial-looking. Ivy-covered and surrounded by thick forest. The bell tower looked like it hadn’t rung in a hundred years.

But there were students. Kind of.

I mean, there were people there — maybe thirty of us. All teenagers, all quiet. I tried making friends the first day, but they mostly just looked past me. Their eyes were glassy. One girl, Mara, said something like “We’re not supposed to talk during orientation” and then didn’t speak again.

The teachers were worse. They didn’t have names. We addressed them as “Instructor.” Their faces were wrong somehow — like I couldn’t remember any of them after I left the room. One had this way of standing perfectly still when you weren’t looking at him, like a mannequin. Another wrote notes on the chalkboard in a language that made my eyes water.

Still, the weirdest part was how normal the school tried to seem. We had cafeteria lunches (gray meat, unseasoned). We had gym class (running in circles around a track that looped in impossible ways). We had fire drills (but the alarms made no sound).

Then last night, I woke up at 3:03 a.m. to the sound of scratching. I live alone, and I sleep with the windows shut. But there it was: skrrrch… skrrrch… from the inside of my closet. I grabbed my phone. The clock was blinking “3:03 a.m” — frozen. I opened the closet door and saw a note nailed to the back wall. “THEY WILL NOT LET YOU GRADUATE.”

This morning, Mara was gone. Not “missing,” just gone. No one remembered her. I asked one of the instructors about her and he just stared through me, and said, “There is no Mara here.” I checked the student registry. Her name had been erased. Actually, I think everyone’s has. The list is just blank now.

The lessons were odd too. There was no Math, Literature, English, all that was written on todays schedule was "Meeting" The so called "Meeting" was to happen in the auditorium at exactly 3:00 pm. I remember looking at the clock: "2:56 p.m" "I should probably go." I said to myself.

Once i got to the auditorium entrance, I remember seeing something that sent shivers down my spine. everybody was staring at me with their soulless, dark eyes. "You're late" The principal said in a angry tone. "b-but there's still two minutes le-" as I was about to finish what I was saying, I looked at my clock- 3:25 p.m. What the fuck? How? It was just 2:58? "Sit down" the principal said in a angry, yet somewhat sad tone. As I sat down, still wondering how time went by so quickly, I looked around the auditorium. I never realised just how big this place was. It looked like the size of a full football field. Why is it so big? From the outside it looked tiny, yet now it looks massive. At exactly 3:30 p.m, the principal started speaking:

 “At this point in the curriculum,” he said, his voice echoing in the cavernous space, “you are no longer students. You are observers. Witnesses.” A hush fell over the crowd. Not that there had been much noise to begin with. Just that weird, pressure-heavy silence you feel right before something happens. My stomach turned. I wanted to look at my phone, but I couldn’t move my arms. “I know this is difficult,” he continued, pacing in a strangely stilted way across the stage. “But Pine Hollow has rules. Old rules. We do not grant knowledge freely. We are not a charity. We are a gate.” The auditorium lights dimmed until the principal was the only thing visible. Behind him, the curtains began to part. What was behind them wasn’t a stage.

It was... wrong.

It looked like a cave, but not made of stone. More like flesh. The walls pulsed like lungs. There was a sound, low and constant, like breathing but wet and mechanical. From the shadows, something began to slither forward. I tried to stand. My legs wouldn’t move. The principal gestured toward the thing, whatever it was, and said, “Your tuition is due.”

That’s when the floor beneath me opened up.

I fell. Or was pulled. I couldn’t tell. Everything was black, but not the kind of black you get with no light — it was thick, like ink. It coated my skin. I couldn’t breathe. Then suddenly: I was in my dorm room. The clock on the wall read 3:31 p.m. I was soaked. Covered in something cold and slimy. My fingernails were broken. My ID card was gone. There was a knock on the door. I didn’t answer it. A piece of paper slid under the door. I picked it up with shaking hands. It was another note. But this one just said:

“You are enrolled. You cannot leave.”

I haven’t been able to sleep since. My windows are sealed. My door is locked. But I keep hearing footsteps outside my room at night. Always stopping right at the threshold. Sometimes, they whisper. Sometimes, they say my name. No one talks to me anymore. Not even to tell me to be quiet. The other students don’t blink. I don’t think they breathe.

I don’t think they ever did.

I tried going back to town today. I followed the winding road for hours. But every path looped back to Pine Hollow.

Every. Single. Time.

I’m writing this because I think someone needs to know. If you find the website, if you see the crest, if you think this sounds like a good opportunity— Don’t apply.

Pine Hollow isn’t a school.

It’s a mouth.

And it’s hungry.
