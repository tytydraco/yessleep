Last year, I took a job as an overnight security officer for the local dog shelter. I thought it was going great until I discovered the truth. 



My first week was during the day, so I could fill out all the HR paperwork and watch the lame videos that they use to “train” you. I met with my trainer, Tim, who informed me that he would be working with me during the night the following week. After that week was over and I flipped my sleep schedule, I came to work on that Monday and met with Tim. He showed me around the shelter, which was huge, but we never went inside. He showed me what keys opened which doors, and where all the security cameras were to make sure you were seen if management decided to see if you were actually patrolling the area. 



Right behind the shelter was a very large public park. It closes at 10pm, and the gates are shut, but that does not stop the mass amount of drug users and party goers that sneak into the park. That was the main reason for them to have 24/7 security around the place. The shelter itself was pretty locked down. Lots of doors and keys were needed to enter the property when it was all locked up. The parking lot was gated and no cars could enter without a code. Needless to say, the job was easy. Just walking in circles for 8 hours every night.



On my second night before going to work, I received a text from my boss stating that Tim wasn't going to be with me and that I would be training with someone else that evening. When I got to work, I was alone. So I started to just walk my rounds. At midnight, I finally found my trainer who told me her name was Dorothy. She was an older, gray haired woman in her 70’s. She told me she had been working there since the county opened the shelter, 44 years prior. She was the original night security guard and told me that id see her once in a while when she worked days, but that she had switched to only working on the weekends to semi-retire.



Dorothy showed me everything. She walked me inside the shelter and showed me the aggressive dogs, the friendly dogs, and the puppy area for when I needed a pick-me-up. She showed me which bathrooms were the best to use, and which ones I should avoid. She had a vast amount of knowledge of the building, how the construction had changed over the years as it grew. She pointed out what areas of the park were the troubled areas and even introduced me to a few regulars at the park. It was nice knowing that the park patrons and the shelter had an understanding. We didn't care if they were at the park and would not call the cops, as long as they left the shelter alone. 



She told me how back in the day, they used to have prison inmates volunteer at the shelter during open hours. One of the bathrooms she advised me not to use was where one of the inmates had hung himself. She said that she always felt his presence in that area and so she avoided it. After that incident they switched to female prisoner volunteers, but had another incident and the county shut down the program all together quickly after. 



After that, I never saw Dorothy again.



So for the last year I have been coming to work, walking around the shelter, and clocking out. My boss worked 9 to 5 so I never saw him. I'd see the same shelter staff leaving as I was coming in, and the openers coming in as I left. I also never saw anyone at the park again after Dorothy introduced me to them, which I didn't think twice about until yesterday. I just thought that they respected the shelter and stayed clear. 



I had to go in for a day shift for one week to watch the yearly training videos and sign off on the same nonsense, and have my annual review with my boss. Yesterday was my meeting and I discovered some hard truths. I met with my boss and this was how it started.



“You know Gavin, I am very grateful to have someone like you working for us. Last year was a rough one for the shelter and I am glad you were able to take the reins without any issues. I know that I had originally scheduled you to train with Tim, but after he quit, I wasn't able to find someone to continue your training and you did not say a word. You have come to work everyday and I even noticed on the cameras that you sometimes walk through the shelter, making sure all the doors are locked. No one has done that since… nevermind. The point is, that you were able to train yourself, and I am very appreciative of that.”



I was all giddy of course, nothing like getting praised for just walking around, doing jack shit. So i said “Well, Dorothy was able to show me the ropes before she went to weekends, so I owe her some credit”



And that's when the room fell silent. It was cold. The look on my boss's face was pale, jaw dropped, almost shaking in disbelief. 



“I'm sorry, Dorothy?” he asked



“Yeah, last year, I had one night with Tim, but then I spent like two weeks with Dorothy who showed me everything. She introduced me to a few people at the park, and walked me through the shelter.” I was starting to become confused when the look on his face didn't change. 



My boss stood up and leaned over his desk. “You’re fucking with me, arent you?” in a very serious tone. I sat there in silence and confusion, mainly because he just cursed at me and I was caught off guard. There was a pause and then he sat back down. “How do you know about Dorothy? Did you see it in the news?” 



“Im not sure what you are talking about” I replied. “Dorothy, the older lady that worked here forever, she showed me around, and told me she was going to work on the weekends until she retired. Im sorry but I avoid the news. I dont have cable TV or social media so its pretty easy, plus… it's depressing.” 

He realized I was serious and he turned to his computer and started typing. “I don't know how to tell you this, but I will pull up the news article so you can see for yourself. Dorothy was our security guard for many years, yes, but we have Frank who works on the weekends.” he turned his computer screen towards me and I saw the headline. 

“County Shelter Employee Kills 4 People At Local Park and Commits Suicide” it was dated the month before I started. 



I froze and stopped reading. “No way. That's not possible. I met her and had full on conversations with her.”



“The police put a full lock down on the park after that, so you should never see anyone there. Honestly, I think people are afraid to go to the park at night after that. Tim quit without notice after working that one night, and I had no idea why. The morning of the incident I am the one who discovered Dorothy's body hanging in the bathroom, so I am telling you with straight up honesty, you did not meet Dorothy.” 



I sat there in confusion trying to remember those two weeks. I continued to read the article and realized it was all true. I never went into the bathroom that Dorothy told me about. 



“So the prisoner that hung himself, was that true?” I asked.



“WHAT? How do you know about that!? That was never reported to the media.” he was now the confused one.



“Dorothy told me about it…” I said. 



“Wow… that was over 20 years ago, and I almost forgot about that. When I first accepted this position 13 years ago they wanted me to find ways to reduce costs, so I attempted to initiate an inmate volunteer program, and the prison had informed me we were not allowed to and told me why, but no one knew about that. Dorothy was the one that found him after everyone had left for the day and the bus did not do their head count correctly when transporting everyone back to the prison.”



“So, basically, what you’re telling me is that I was trained by a ghost?” I started to laugh in disbelief. I am not sure if it has really hit me yet. 



After all that, I ended up with a pretty fat raise. I go back to nights next week… and I think I might check out that bathroom. My interaction with Dorothy was so real. I have to find her, I have so many questions.
