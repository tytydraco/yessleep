When I first moved into the south on a small farm back in 1976 I didn’t think my small, peaceful town would have any way of being somewhat creepy. When I first moved in all was well until I met this new girl named Sarah. Sarah had beautiful blonde hair, blue eyes and she had a beautiful southern accent that just spoke love and hospitality.

   At first me and Sarah started it off slowly as I had just moved in with my parents and barely knew anybody but as we got older me and Sarah got closer and closer and started dating once we were both 12. I didn’t notice anything off about Sarah till 5 years after we started dating. Sarah would often leave to go check if the stove was off at home and she would always come back with stains on her shirt but she always said it was from red juice she drank while she was there. I never questioned her about any of this mainly because I loved her but then we got married.


  “Honey I’m back!” Sarah said and I said back “Hey babe!” And gave her a kiss. I noticed she had meat in her bags of groceries so I figured she had just gone to go buy dinner and was cooking it. Sarah had gone into the kitchen and cooked and as had all of her meals had smelled amazing. I took a bite and noticed an unfamiliar taste. I asked Sarah what was in it and she said “oh just new ingredients” with a smug grin on her face. Once again I didn’t question anything because I loved Sarah with all my heart and didn’t want to lose her.


  One time Sarah had came back home from what she said was work when I smelt a visibly horrid stench from her close. I asked and she got a little upset and stated “I don’t question you about your job, don’t question me about mine!” With a snobby facial expression. I didn’t say anything to her and I figured she was just tired. Everytime I suggest we go to her house she also gets hostile with me constantly saying “Once you pay my bills, we can come over to my house!” This was something that always made me suspicious of her.


  Eventually I had enough so I snuck over to her house while she was getting food and once I opened the door I noticed that same horrid stench from her close that one day. I glanced around the room assuming maybe something died and she hadn’t known it but I found nothing. I walked around her house until I found a locked door with a keyhole barely big enough to see into. Once I looked into the keyhole something or someone rammed into the door begging “LET US OUT! LET US OUT! WE CAN'T SUFFER ANY LONGER!” I got to scared and I ran home without looking back.

   
  I decided not to say anything to Sarah so she wouldn’t get suspicious but then I remembered that I always wondered why her parents weren’t home. One night we were in bed and she got up in the middle of the night so I said “where are you going” and she said back “I think I loved the oven on” after what I had seen earlier I knew I had to follow her. When Sarah left the house I followed her and she did end up going home. I watched through the window as she walked past the kitchen to that same door and opened it. I couldn't see anything but all I could hear was “Sarah please! We are your parents! You don’t have to do this.” Sarah responded “I don’t care! Now shut up” as she kicked them back down the stairs. She started going towards the door so I ran home as fast as I could.


  After that I decided I would go and free them the moment the sun rose. Once Sarah left that morning I rushed to the house with a pair of bolt cutters to cut the locks with. I got into the house and said “Hello! I am here to help!” To no reply. I ran to the door and started opening it until I heard the sound of keys opening the front door. I knew this was it, I had to open this door. I cut the locks off and opened it but not before Sarah caught me. Sarah was furious shouting at me “I TOLD YOU MY WORK WAS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS” shortly after everything went dark.


  As I awoke my eyes took a second to adjust. I looked around and almost puked at what I saw. Sarah’s parents were sitting in the corner skinned alive and still breathing. As I looked around further I noticed more and more dead bodies with chunks taken out of them, I realized that the new ingredient was not new meat but humans. I looked at Sarah’s parents and asked “who are these people?” They said “her ex husbands” I was frozen in shock till the door opened. 


  Sarah came down with a saw blade and I knew I had to do something. She hadn’t secured my hands so I had grabbed a piped and as she approached me I had tried to whack her in the head but had missed. She grabbed my arm and started sawing it off. I screamed in agony “STOP SARAH! DON'T DO THIS!” She didn’t listen so I grabbed the pipe again with the other hand and this time I didn’t miss. I nailed her right in the back of her head and she dropped to the floor, dead. I ran to the door in excitement and a little fear. But once I turned the handle it didn’t budge. I started crying wishing this was all I nightmare but I knew it wasn’t i knew my life was over who had really won me or Sarah maybe I shouldn’t have checked the door.
