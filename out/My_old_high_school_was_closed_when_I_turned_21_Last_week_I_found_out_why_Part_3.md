After I got back from my [last trip](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/18ytqh1/my_old_high_school_was_closed_when_i_turned_21/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to the school, I went to bed. I decided to fill Kira in when she woke up in the morning. I set my flashlight on the coffee table and pulled the yearbook out of my backpack. I figured we could go over the book together in the morning.

\-

“That’s insane.” Kira snapped at me as she paced around the living room.    
  
“I know it sounds insane but she climbed out of the window and got away,” I told Kira as I watched her dart around the living room.   
  
“If she got away, why was she still glowing?” Kira asked me. She had a good point and I didn’t have an answer for her.   
  
“I honestly don’t know,” I said as I sat on the couch.   
  
“And who was in the lunchroom? Do you think someone else is looking around the school?” Kira asked me as she sat in my recliner for a second before getting up to pace again.   
  
“I have no idea,” I mumbled.   
  
“We need to get an idea!” Kira snapped at me.   
  
I didn’t have enough energy to yell at her. I knew why she was getting so worked up about all of this. Headaches might’ve been drawing me to the school but she died there and we still didn’t know who killed her and why.   
  
“We can look at the yearbook,” I suggested to the panicking girl.   
  
“We have to go back to the school and see if someone is there looking around,” Kira said.   
  
I shook my head no.   
  
“We have clues now, okay? Let’s check out this yearbook.” I said again, this time using my good arm to flip the book open. When I saw what was inside, my heart sank. The first few pages were empty. I flipped through the book faster, every single page was empty.    
  
In a fit of rage, I slammed the book shut and tossed it across the room. I got hit with glass for no reason and we were back to square one. We had nothing.   
  
Kira flinched back, she watched the book hit the floor.   
  
“Sorry,” I said seriously. I wasn’t trying to scare her.   
  
“It’s okay,” Kira whispered as she sat in a chair.   
  
I could see it on her face, she was feeling hopeless. There was nothing I could do to assure her we would find anything.   
  
“Tomorrow, we will go back and get answers. Come hell or high water but we have to be prepared first.” I told Kira as I got off of the couch.   
  
“Gear, food, water, and a weapon are a must.” I trailed on as I walked to my bedroom. I grabbed an extra backpack and brought it out to Kira.   
  
“We are getting answers,” I said seriously as I handed her the bag.   
  
Kira took it and sighed, “What do you want me to do?”  
  
“Fill up the water bottles in the kitchen. I’m going to run to the store.” I told her as I grabbed my car keys and left.   
  
\-  
  
The moment I started driving away from the house my headache started coming back. It wasn’t as strong as all of the other ones, and it was something I could push through to make sure I got what we needed.   
  
I couldn’t go too far because the further I went the worse the headache became. I had to settle for going to a corner store.   
  
I got us more water, some food, and each one a special drink. I got myself a soda and Kira an apple juice because she killed three bottles of juice already. I made sure to grab food that would last, and snacks because I knew we could eat them quickly.   
  
The challenge was finding anything we could use that might make a decent weapon. I didn’t end up finding anything, we were going to have to use what I had in the house.   
  
Finally, I bought some gum and scratch tickets. I used the last of my cash to buy a small flashlight for Kira. It wasn’t anything amazing but at least she would have one if she needed it.   
  
I packed up the car and started to head home. Once again, the closer I got to my house, the more the headache began to lift. I was starting to wonder what force was drawing me back to the school, and what it wanted with me in the first place.   
  
\-  
  
“You got juice?” Kira asked as she went to grab the bottle.   
  
I laughed and held it away from her, “I did. But you have to put it in your bag.” I said seriously as I handed her the bottle.   
  
“Are you expecting us to be inside for a long time?” Kira asked me while she was helping me pack the backpacks.   
  
“If we get stuck we need to make sure we have supplies. When I was in the lunchroom I noticed someone had barricaded the doors. If I had to guess, they spent the night or at least were using the room as a base of sorts.” I explained to Kira as we took our bags to my car and climbed inside.   
  
“Before we go in I have to check something out with the groundskeeper,” I told her as we drove to Greenridge High School.   
  
“The school doesn’t have one,” Kira said confused.   
  
“When I was in school we did. But, this guy is different I think. He tends the same plot of grass for hours.” I said as we pulled into the school, I wanted to jump out and check the grass right away but he was standing on it, he was working the same way he was the last time I saw him.   
  
At least I knew where he was this time.   
  
I parked the car and froze, there was another car sitting in the parking lot.   
  
“Someone else is here,” I told Kira as I hopped out of the car. From where we were standing I could tell the car was empty.   
  
“Maybe we should check the car?” Kira suggested as she grabbed our bags.   
  
“No.” I shook my head and took my bag with my good arm. Kira handed me my flashlight and we walked toward the building. Checking the car could be a good idea but I didn’t want to give someone a reason to call the cops on us.   
  
“We have to go to the main office first.” I told Kira. I wasn’t going to leave any room for discussion. The main office could have many useful things, I was hoping for an employee log, keys, or anything of importance.   
  
As we walked through the first floor, I told Kira to stay away from the hallway that leads to the gym. We also kept an eye out for the woman who was throwing glass at me. I was sure that she must be able to walk around the halls freely, if she was in the lunchroom.   
  
“What if there’s a killer in here?” Kira asked as we finally reached the main office. We were fortunate that everything we needed so far was on the first floor. To get to the main office we had to continue down the front hallway, towards the elective rooms.   
  
“We run.” I whispered to Kira. I gave her my flashlight and went to open the office door, but to my surprise it opened for us.   
  
Kira screamed at the top of her lungs.   
  
A voice from the door snapped, “Be quiet!”  
  
The door opened fully, a woman looked out at us and moved the door to let us in. Kira quickly moved into the main office and I followed after her.  
  
The blonde woman locked the door before turning to us. She was pointing a kitchen knife at me, “Who are you and why are you here?” The woman asked me.   
  
“Caleb! My name is Caleb and this is Kira, who are you?” I asked the woman as I kept my good hand up.   
  
“Cassandra.” She said as she reached out to tap each of us. I was confused for a moment, but she must've been making sure we were real.   
  
“I wasn’t expecting anyone else to be here.” Cassandra told me once she was done with her inspection.   
  
“Neither were we.” I told her honestly.   
  
  
“Were you the one who left the blank yearbook in the lunchroom?” I asked her as I moved to start looking around the office. I was looking for student records, keys, anything we could use to help us and finally get answers.   
  
“Yes. I couldn’t figure out what to do with it and I had to get going.” Cassandra told me as she watched me look around.   
  
There was nothing of note in the first area of the office. I couldn’t find any records, it was like the whole place had been cleaned out.   
  
“Why is this place empty?” I questioned Cassandra. I was hoping she would tell me that we arrived as she was cleaning the place out.   
“I was wondering the same thing. I haven’t checked the principal's office yet.” Cassandra told me as she motioned to the only other door in this room.   
  
“Why the hell did you bring a kid here?” Cassandra asked me.    
  
“I found her here.” I explained to Cassandra as I tested the door to the principal's office.   
  
“He saved my life.” Kira corrected.   
  
“She was a spirit, I think.” I told Cassandra as I opened the door. I was expecting Cassandra to be surprised. I thought she would laugh at me or think I was joking.   
  
“Green, blue, red, or orange?” Cassandra asked me as she and Kira followed me into the office.   
  
“She was blueish I guess. Why?” As I asked Cassandra I went right over to the desk in the room and opened every drawer. Eventually, I found a set of keys.   
  
“Because I was wondering if you figured out what the colors were for.” Cassandra sighed.   
  
I looked up at both of them and smiled, “I finally found something useful.” I said as I put the keyring on the desk.   
  
“That’s a lot of keys.” Kira said as she walked over to examine the keyring.   
  
“One of those has to be a skeleton key.” Cassandra told us as she went through the file cabinets. I could hear her swearing and slamming things shut.   
  
“What?” Kira asked her.   
  
“Every file is empty.” Cassandra snapped as she slid her hands through her hair.   
  
I could tell we were both thinking the same thing, someone had to have been in here before. The only other person I have seen here has been the groundskeeper. I haven't seen him enter the building, but maybe he came in here to clean the place out?    
  
Once we finished looking around the room, Cassandra put the empty files on the desk. Lucky for us they were still labeled.   
  
I went through each of the names on the empty files…   
  
Ava Miller, Liam Cooper, Mason Kinh, Harper Scott, Grace Thompson, and Lucas Reed. There weren't enough files for all of the murdered teenagers and the ones who went away. But this was a good place to start.   
  
\-  
  
I tucked the folders into my backpack and looked up at Cassandra, “Why are you here?” I asked her seriously. For all I knew, she could be hiding her crimes.   
  
“My brother died here and my sister, Hannah, got away. I was away from school when I got the phone call. By the time I got here my family's house was packed up and most of the furniture was already gone.” Cassandra closed her eyes tightly.   
  
“My sister left me a note in my old bedroom. It said that she had to run away. But she didn’t leave an address or any indication as to where she would be going. I have been looking for her for months.” Cassandra said as she opened her eyes to look at me and Kira.   
  
I had a lot of questions I wanted to ask but before I could we could hear screaming coming from the hallway. I ran around the girls to get to the office door.   
  
“What are you doing?” Cassandra snapped as she followed me.   
  
“I can help them!” I snapped back.   
  
“You only have one arm!” Kira tried to remind me.   
  
I let my head hang out of the doorway for a second, the commotion was coming from closer to the art rooms. I slowly left the office and walked down the hallway. I was trying to keep my boots as quiet as possible.   
  
As I turned the corner to the art rooms, I watched as a seethrough man slammed a boy into the lockers face first. The boy was glowing orange.   
  
After a few more slams the man lifted the boy and slammed him into the floor. I watched as the tile crashed under the weight, I heard a loud snapping sound. I’m assuming the boy died when his neck hit the floor.   
  
I waited for a second to see if there was anything I could do.   
  
The killer walked over to the trashcan at the end of the hallway: It was also glowing. This is the first time an object was glowing. The yellow glow from the trash can illuminated the killer just enough for me to see his coaching jacket. Most of the back of the jacket was ripped apart, it looked like a cat or something had clawed massive slash marks into it.   
  
I watched as he slowly pulled a girl from the trash can. She coughed and spit blood all over him. She looked different too, her glow was red and despite everything being see through, she was the most clear to me.   
  
She screamed at him, hit him in the face, she was fighting back but it didn’t matter. Using her leg, he slammed her from locker to locker like she weighed nothing. I couldn’t watch him kill her, it was hard enough to listen to.   
  
Once he was done I turned my head to look back down the hallway, the images were fading away. Last time this happened I was able to intercept Kira before she was murdered in the auditorium.   
  
I waited until the killer faded completely before rushing down the hallway. As I ran down the hallway to see if I could interfere with the trash can, Kira spoke from behind me, “What are you doing?”   
  
“I am going to stop two more murders.” I hissed to Kira.   
  
“You and Cassandra pick a spot to hide or get ready to help me.” I instructed. I filled them in on what I knew, both of the girls hid around a corner.   
  
All three of us waited, the moment I heard the girl's voice, I looked up. She wasn’t coming from upstairs, instead she was coming out of the girls bathroom behind me. Her face was already cut up, she was clearly upset about something.   
  
I quickly turned around and ran over to her. I put my arm out to grab her, unlike Kira I couldn’t grab her right away. There was a force pushing me back, but I didn’t care. No one deserved to die the way she did.   
  
I just kept pushing.   
  
“Listen!” I screamed at the girl. She couldn’t hear me.   
  
I was assuming she was attacked before the boy. She had already been put into the trash can before the boy was attacked. We were running out of time.   
  
“You’re going to die!” Cassandra screamed from the end of the hallway.   
  
The girl looked up, confused. She heard Cassandra but she couldn’t hear me. I had no time to think about why. I reached forward and took her by the arm, ripping her out of wherever she was proved to be a challenge. I was fighting with something, there was another force that wanted here.   
  
Once I got her out and watched the color return to her skin. Her school jacket had blood all over the front of it, I moved to get her down the hallway and to Cassandra.   
  
“Once I get the boy we are going to have to run.” I said.   
  
Cassandra took the girl and watched me go back down the hallway. The boy was coming out of one of the art rooms but something was wrong, the killer was already here. I could see him at the end of the hallway.   
  
“Run!” Kira snapped as we watched the killer start running down the hallway.   
  
I ran over to the boy and grabbed him by his collar, I tried to spin us around to get out. I could feel his hands wrap around my wrist as we fell and squirmed on the floor.   
  
I quickly brought him to his feet, like the girl he was clearly confused about what had just happened to him.   
  
“Run!” Kira screeched.   
  
I turned my head and pushed the boy backward, his back hitting the locker. I could see Kira running down the hallway, I watched as she took him by the hand and we started running.   
  
“Shit!” Cassandra snapped as we turned the corner. I screamed loudly and almost fell to my knees, something hit my back. I tried to reach back and pull it out while we were running. Once I finally got it, I was looking at glass.   
  
“The scientist is here!” I screamed at the group.   
  
Something felt different about this chase. Something felt more visceral.   
  
“Watch out!” Cassandra screamed as a baseball smacked Kira. It hit her in the side with enough force to knock her over.   
  
The boy stopped running to help her up. Kira spit blood all over the floor.   
  
I stopped running to see where the attack came from, there was a guy holding a baseball bat standing at the back door. His eyes were bright red, and his baseball bat was glowing yellow.   
  
“You have got to be kidding me!” I screamed as we all ran for the front door. This time I was going to be ready for Mascot Killer.   
  
“Watch the stairs!” I screamed at Cassandra. She moved just in time to have a hatchet miss her arm. I could hear the man laughing from the stairs.   
  
Cassandra ripped the doors open and we all ran out. I could hear my heart beating in my head. The adrenaline was almost too much for me to handle. Feeling the fresh air on my face as a nice reminder that we got out of the school, but I was extremely confused to see that the sun was up.   
  
“Get to my car!” I screamed at Kira.   
“What about you?” Kira called back to me as they continued running across the parking lot. I made a note to park closer to the building next time.   
  
“There’s something I have to do!” I screamed back as I ran over to where the groundskeeper was tending the dirt.   
  
\-  
  
I ran over to the dirt and dug my good hand into it. I was trying to move it as fast as possible. I could hear Kira screaming behind me but I couldn’t make out what she was saying.   
  
As I dug through the dirt, I could hear something running next to me. I looked up and saw the groundskeeper coming. His face was twisted and distorted. His eyes were sunken in, and he was running like an animal.   
  
I was digging as fast as I could and eventually I found something. I ripped it out of the dirt and got up, I was holding a hot pink diary.   
  
As I turned to run away, something slammed into my leg, this time I could feel the blood trickling down my pants and into my boot. I looked down to see a gardening tool sticking out of my shin.   
  
I clenched the book and screamed. I was sure he was going to kill me, I watched his jaw crack and pop as he closed in.   
  
I closed my eyes and heard my car screech.   
  
I looked up to see Kira behind the wheel. The boy was holding my flashlight like a weapon, shining it at the man. The light hit him and made him screech. I watched as he ran away, going behind the school.   
  
I felt a hand grab my arm, I was sure it was another killer but no, it was Cassandra. She pulled me to my feet and got me in her car.   
  
“Kira! Drive home!” I screamed.   
  
Cassandra and I watched as Kira started to leave the school grounds. We followed as closely as possible. As Cassandra drove I looked at the small book in my hand, we finally had answers.
