I left him last month, I was so sick of his infidelity and lies. After 10 years of marriage, you would think that he would communicate that our sex-life wasn't good enough for him. You would think that after 3 kids he would understand that I'm not who I used to be, but I was willing to work with him to fix our problems. 

The first time I caught him was not too long after our second child was born, he was fucking the next door neighbor in the guest bedroom while I was supposed to be at my mom's with our then toddler and new-born. He didn't know that I caught him and luckily our children were asleep so I snuck out the house quietly. I have to hand it to him, then I would have never thought he was cheating. He never distanced himself from me or gave me a reason to be suspicious. After that day, I watched him like a hawk. I never saw messages in his phone or email from other women, and he didn't have a second device he was speaking them to. So since there was no direct communication, I figured it was just spontaneous sex. Something to get him by when I turned him down, so for that I tried to forgive him. 

Life went on as usual, we had another baby about 2 year after our second, and again, I caught him fucking another woman in our guest bedroom while I was supposed to be at my mothers. This time, it was the waitress from the restaurant we had gone to as a little baby moon before our third was born. Again, with me just having give birth I figured it was just sex since I didn't want to have sex so soon after giving birth. I thought that once I was better things would go back to normal.

Boy was I wrong

About 3 years after having my youngest, I suffered a miscarriage. It was hard as we very much wanted that baby. I had the kids go to his mothers home while I went to the doctor to get myself taken care of. I asked my husband to come with but he wanted to stay home and rest. I pleaded but he refused, so I had my mother take me. When I came home, there he was, fucking another woman in our guest bedroom. This time I didn't recognize the woman as I was too hurt and stunned to find out my husband would rather take my miscarriage as an opportunity to fuck another woman instead of being there for me through this hard time.

That's when I went stone-cold. Any love, affection, and forgiveness I had for my husband went out of the window. I became cold and bitter, I stopped allowing him to touch me or come near me. Around the kids I acted as if nothing was wrong, they needed both of their parents still. After about 2 years of this, I finally decided to act, I hired a P.I. to watch my husband and gather evidence of an affair or him cheating, which was a lot. There was enough evidence to warrant a divorce which we are in the process of. 

I did not block his phone number as we have children, I was allowed to stay in the home for the time being. When I served my husband the divorce papers and he was asked to leave, he went AWOL. We could not locate him, and the lawyers and police think that this is a tactic to drag the divorce on. Until last week, he had been missing for a month, countless search parties were formed in attempts to find him. Around 12am last week I got the first message.

"Hi."

It was from an unknown number so I didn't respond, I went back to bed, my phone had a total of 5 messages but 50 missed calls. The messages read,

"It's Danny, please answer"

"I miss you so much"

"I'm sorry for hurting you" 

"ANSWER YOUR PHONE"

"MELISSA ANSWER ME NOW BEFORE I HURT YOU"

I was shocked, I sent screen shots to my lawyer and told him that I am fearful for me and my children now. He granted me a protection order and notified the police. He instructed me to block the number and only answer messages from my husbands original phone. 

Over the past week, he has messaged me through multiple different numbers, hundreds of calls and messages, all documented and sent to my lawyer, until today. This morning I woke up to no calls and no messages, I was relieved thinking that it was finally over with, until moments after I woke up, I received this message.

"I know you have everyone convinced that I'm missing, but I will be coming back :)"

I finally decided to respond.

"How are you texting me?"

After what felt like hours another message popped up,

"Concrete can't hold me forever >:)"

I dropped my phone and ran to the basement where I thought I had buried his body. Where the concrete I had laid was now hole of rubble. 

He can't be alive for long though, all the food in the house is laced with rat poison :)
