Many make up creepy pastas, without realizing at times some truths are within them even if they did not experience as claim.  I can confirm their is other dimensions that you do not see all around you and barriers that limit what access such entity's of those dimensions can do. Their is ways to taint the ground to allow greater access; to lower the barriers. There is some places even on earth so dangerous pray you never find them, as those locations the entity's have greater access and people can go missing, meaning taken captive into another dimension. 

Now I will reveal there does exist entity's that can alter your perception, that can make you perceive reality differently than it is. Some of these entity's have been involved in abductions even as some are what mankind perceive to be 'extra terrestrial' but truth is they are more so inter-dimensional and demonic.

Their are also physical and spiritual dimensions, both good and evil.  Normally you do not have awareness of them as they are not of same density. But a time is coming were the entire earth itself is going to fall through a barrier, in bible it describes it as the fall of Babylon, when earth becomes a dwelling place for every foul spirit for all the creations of devils.  This period is also known as the time of night were no work can be done, were the voice of God no longer protects the earth and Word of God is no longer restraining the forces of darkness. It is the time of reign of Antichrist and days known as the great tribulation, that it is written will be so extreme no other time can compare.

This isn't a creepy pasta really what I am revealing more this is real knowledge about the future and certain things that already exist. I speak from a position of knowing and will warn you this the lower density looks like this and I know it sounds a bit like some creepy pastas, but the sun is red in lower density, the sky is darkened with a red hue, the air is thicker and days are shorter and nights longer. You fear the dark because your spirit understands evil resides in darkness.  Right now the sunlight in this density prevents many things from gaining access, but after Babylons fall the sun itself is changed and no longer protecting mankind as once did, rather it will even burn the skin of mankind if exposed to it, this fulfills the scripture about the sun scorching them in those days.  If alive for this timeline to come if survive the opening cataclysm events that occupy with the fall. Ye will be afraid of sunlight because it burns, but will be more afraid of nighttime as during that time things even darker gain access that hide away till nighttime. 

All the creepy pastas wont even be able to compare to what the world becomes after the density shifts, after Babylons fall when it passes through the barrier. Now ye may ask why would this occur because the position your world occupies and you yourself and even your state of body, is also determined by the state the people of that world are in. The world embracing  sin has a price, and their is people who do know about this and are deliberately leading the nations to make choices that bring the world closer and closer to passing through the barrier. The entity's both spiritual and physical that exist in lower density are beyond anything your horror movies have imagined, the reality itself for those who survive the opening is a living nightmare. People will even be taken captive and kept alive in extreme torture wishing to die but unable too, demonic beings feeding on their suffering and fears. 

This is a warning what is spoken in this post is the future, it going to happen, it did happen and shall, it was known before the world was ever formed how it would end. For most of mankind it is too late to avoid what coming, including most who even die during that time will be captive anyway trapped in underworld dimensions. There is so much more to it all including the flesh itself changing in the fall and reality itself not the same, their is no joy in the lower density it is taken away.  

For now the forces of darkness are restrained but only for a short time longer, for when the Light withdraws so will the Darkness descend upon the earth. The words given by God were a guide for your protection, you had agency to ignore it but in doing so Darkness gains power, all warnings spoken about this time were for your sake, many suffered and died warning mankind about the time that is to come. Know ye will most likely suffer unless find the straight and narrow pathway that few find, which leads to a way out before the fall. But know also hold on to hope, hope is like a shield, hope in Christ in itself will aid with any suffering you endure, and eventually ye will be aided and the tears will be wiped away.
