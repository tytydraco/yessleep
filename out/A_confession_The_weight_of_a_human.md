This is a confession.

I am no longer here.

I  would ask of the father to forgive me, but to be looked upon as a  religious hypocrite would be detrimental to both the truly pious and me.  I do not ask for forgiveness but understanding. To whomever this  portion of my journal reaches, I hope that my inclinations do not  disturb your already structured morality. My intentions are to  introduce, not invade. It is not my desire to leave a lasting legacy  within your mental state, my legacy lives beyond the individual and is  now accepted as an ideology.

I  have made the human life a trivial thing. The fragility of a person, I  have learned. I am a zealous believer of the insignificance of the human  conscience. From trial and error, I have learned that humans exposed to  the crude end of their final hours become animals. Unable to carry a  cognizant thought and losing all dignity of a supposedly intelligent  life form. Ethics and morals I have thrown out. I do not think this was  an active decision I bookmarked in my timeline. I would assume it was a  subconscious decision made for me in my childhood or perhaps my genetic  code.

I am not escaping from  judgement. Nor do I beg for pardon. I am in my shoes by desire and  choice. I chose to stay in the state that I am. What was not available  for me and my interest, I procured it vigorously. The subjects I needed  were meticulously pursued and gathered.

The  initial struggle is what makes my art so arduous. A little bit of  anesthetics and white lies make the job less of a struggle. I rely on  both heavily.

It amuses me how  every single subject holds onto the single thread of hope so  desperately. The white lies I tell become a beacon of hope, when in  reality we are together in the abyss shrouded by black so black that it  seems palpable. They are a guest and visitor to my darkness, for it has  been my abode from the beginning of my existence.

When  it is time for me to gather my sculpting clay, I routinely visit the  socially disadvantaged and vulnerable. The outcasts of society are  easier to forget. The acquiescence of their disappearance is what  allowed for me to continue my art form for many years. With this I have  an excuse to relay the blame aimed towards me to the cruel reality of  society. Partially, the blame is also on you, you who is reading this  journal. You can deny it all you want, but we both know where we stand  in this cold hierarchical world.

Now  I will enlighten you about how I carry my procedure. Drainage of the  blood is key to achieving the luscious color of the blueish hue. The  process may take up to 48 hours, depending on the size of the canvas  being used. Early in my journey of sculpting, I used three strand sisal  ropes to hang the blank canvases but soon realized that a blotch of  blood and a heavier subject quickened the deterioration process of the  rope fiber. Metal chains were a pain to clean up after; I also realized  that the usage of non-disposable materials may hinder the coverage of  trails if I were to be investigated. After sampling different types of  ropes, I found that the double stranded nylon rope was perfect for  carrying out my procedure. The strength and elasticity are clear  strengths of the rope but the main usage comes from its resistance to  chemical exposure. I shall refrain from disclosing any more of my  tendencies for I believe true art should not be emulated but imagined  and individualized.

Do I feel  empathy for my subjects? That is like asking Shakespeare if he feels for  the ink that is smeared for his writing. Does Beethoven rue over the  intensity he has used over the black and white ivory? Subjects born with  an innate dullness are embellished through my craft and become an art  reborn for this grey world. It is a blessing I am willing to share  without recompense.

I will  continue in my expression. The human anatomy is a beautiful thing in and  of itself. The symmetry and balance of the physique conveys nature’s  universal pursuit of beauty. All I do is add to the intrinsic elegance  and hope to satiate the world of its hunger for harmony. Sculpting has  opened a new world of obsession for me. As it will be the case for  everyone else who set eyes on my work.

You  will find my work displayed in a warehouse located around Susana Road  313. Some canvases have been sold overseas for cadaver exhibitions; the  most famous one being the ‘Real Bodies’ exhibition carried out by China.  Some have been shipped around the world to many well renowned medical  schools and hospitals as samples or for cadaver dissection trainings.  Once again, I relay the blame aimed towards me to another section of  society.

When the remainder of the  bodies are found, you have my permission to do whatever with them.  Assuming you have contacted authorities, I sincerely hope that this  revelation does not discourage or corrode your mental fortitude.

But  by in the off chance you, who is reading this, is someone like me who  can appreciate true beauty… my legacy is left to you to carry on. If you  are willing to continue my work, I have written a second journal only  for the eyes of the likes of us. Written in the journal are detailed  anatomical procedures and cautions when dealing with tools and  chemicals. If you are lacking in knowledge and the skills, I recommend  locating my second journal and dissect it thoroughly.

I  have benefited from the facade of society. The art that I have created  has left a mark in this world and I am satisfied. It is up to you,  reader, to continue or to sabotage. What is done already cannot be  retrieved but hemorrhages can be treated.

I wish you luck in all your endeavors.
