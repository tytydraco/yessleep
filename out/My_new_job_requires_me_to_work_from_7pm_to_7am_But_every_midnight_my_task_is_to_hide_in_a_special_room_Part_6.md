\[Part 5\]( [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/16xikzd/my\_new\_job\_requires\_me\_to\_work\_from\_7pm\_to\_7am/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/16xikzd/my_new_job_requires_me_to_work_from_7pm_to_7am/))

The worst has happened. I am still shaking from what I saw. All I wanted to do is to work, being active, earn a salary and take care of my family. Was that too much to ask? Why did I have to face that entity full of hate and grudge?

After consulting a doctor on Saturday, my children and I have been found 'in normal health conditions' even though displaying symptoms of severe lung infection. Hence, we receive treatment and medication aligning with that strange and contrasting observation. Despite the affliction, the kids overflowed with joy and energy about their strange and collective dreams, in each of them encountering the so-called voice, who recently taught them an eerie and irritating song about the black room. I told you last time that my wife is not an open minded person like you people, but now, even her is starting to get very uncomfortable with the strange phenomenon happening to the children.

Monday finally arrived, and I could not wait to meet my supervisor. Before going to the appointment, I checked my contract for the umpteenth time, still flabbergasted by its content that I am sure was not the same when I first read and signed it. At 5 pm, I was already at work, waiting patiently for my supervisor to make time for me. To my surprise, he showed up with several gas masks, indicating that he still reads my posts and showing concerns about the situation. He apologized, himself unaware that the safety of the black room could be bypassed by the entity, also referring to it by its name. The kind of name that cannot be borne by a human, the kind of name that I rather not share with you, for your own sake.

Clearly unwilling to share more and unable to provide better solutions, he handed me a sleep mask, referring to his advice about closing my eyes and not moving if trapped. To be honest, I still cannot see how that item can be useful.

Then came the night. Midnight or not, for any little pause, I would sit in the black room, still traumatized and terrorized by the entity. At 12:00 am, there was no sign of it on any of the monitors. I did not forget anything outside of the room and was no longer interested in seeing that evil being, therefore, I remained in the black room, convincing myself that I had everything to counter its attacks. At 12:17 am, it startledme through the radio, using the voice of a kid to sing that awful song the 'voice' taught my children:

"Little, little sun

In the little, little black room

Come out and have fun

Or I will eat you and the moon."

It repeated while my surprised self just looked at the radio placed on the little desk in front of the monitors. This might not seem concerning to you, however, Sun and Moon are nicknames my wife and I have carried for years since our marriage.

When I decided that I had heard enough, I plugged my earbuds and just watched the screen of the radio flickering. Something else then caught my attention on the monitors, especially the one linked to the camera at the entrance of the building. The man with the black motorcycle helmet stood in front of the sliding doors, looking inside. I wondered what was he looking for, and especially, if he was seeing anything out of the ordinary. But, from what I have seen thus far, as long as it is midnight, even that 'person' could be the entity itself, or at least just one of its tricks. The man walked around the facility, unbothered by the cameras, and just left around 12:40 am. Meanwhile, the entity had kept on with the song as I heard it still singing once I removed the earbuds at 12:59 am, before it abruptly stopped at 01:00 am allowing me to resume my shift.

On the next day, the entity did the exact same thing, being absent from the corridors and just singing through the radio. At that moment, I wondered how this being managed to reach my children, humans that never stepped even a toe into this building or any other location tied to this company from what I know. Just like the day before, I grew irritated with the song and plugged my earbuds. This time however, there was no man lurking outside or anything else out of the ordinary to captivate my attention. Fearing that the entity might get angrier and launch another smoke attack, I looked around, ready to put the gas mask on, only to be struck by terror. Behind the return air vent grid, located close to the ceiling, I spotted a single yellow eye glowing, its brightness amplified by the black paint of the room. I jumped off the chair and let out a scream, followed by many others as I could not stop myself. My fear took me to a corner of the room, curling me up in a futile attempt to protect myself, knowing that I could not even get out of the room to flee.

Closing my eyes and hoping to be just hallucinating, I then heard a thud sound followed by the noise of something falling on the floor. I looked at the object and saw that it was the first screw off the grid. The entity then kept on using its telekinetic powers, removing the other screws, one after the other, until the grid fell on the floor. All I could see was total darkness surrounding the yellow eye. It shone brighter, illuminating the room like a flashlight, except for its own head still wrapped in darkness somehow. That cold sensation of absolute unease invaded my body once again, as I felt that that the thing looking at me, and that I should not be seeing, did not belong in this world. It was still unable to step into the room I guess, so it just stared. Alternating between covering my eyes and getting peeks through my fingers like a scared little kid, I monitored the entity to the best of my ability until it disappeared at 01:00 am.

I rushed out of the black room, on the verge of losing my mind, screaming like a mad man until I exited the building to catch some breath. What more can I take of all this before I end up insane? I did not even notice him until he started his engine. I looked up and saw the man with the black motorcycle helmet, preparing to speed up after watching me from the other side of the road on his motorbike. As if I did not have enough on my plate already, honestly, what does he want from me?

Livid and empty, I returned home the next morning, welcomed by my children who stood right behind the entrance door of our home, waiting for me. Already expecting the worse, I neither greeted them nor addressed them a smile, but rather got to the point, asking them what was that about? The worse I expected, but the worst I obtained, as they told me that the entity was still waiting for me outside of the black room, surprisingly calling that monster by its name.
