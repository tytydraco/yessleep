4 days ago I shut myself into my basement, crushed by the Sun's gravity, forbidden to leave. I spent hours watching the news, looking up info, trying to find anything that confirmed that something indeed was wrong with our star, anything to confirm it wasn't just in my head. Everytime I blinked, thousands of solar flares burst inside my eyelids. She was in my skull, each thought orbiting the idea of her. I had to look at our light again, I had to see what was going on. So I did. 

I called my best friend and fellow astrophotography enthusiast Sam over to the house. I decided not to tell him what was going on and instead bribed him with a cold beer and meat on the grill. Of course, he agreed. When Sam arrived early the next morning we quickly set up his much nicer planetary viewing camera equipped with a spiffy new Sun shade. Then, once the computer elements were in place, I set the grill ablaze and Sam put on that old Hellboy movie, (one of his favorite movies to chill to apparently). Slightly after 4pm we shut the makeshift star viewing station down and began the processing of our prizes. Up until this point I felt completely fine, no paranoia, no weird Sun filled thoughts, nothing. But I couldn't help but feel uneasy as Sam began pulling up the photos. 

“You alright man?” Sam asked, looking over his aviators. 

“Yeah, I’m just excited is all, you know i've been chasing a good picture for awhile now”  

“Alright King, just don’t be getting all weird on me. You space nuts always get handsy with the photographs” He said with a slight smirk. 

Sam unzipped the file and loaded up the first image. It was loading slowly due to the high resolution but slowly it started clearing up. Clearing up into nothing. Just like before, nothing was there. Black, empty space stared back at me through the screen, you could feel the cold air sucking the heat out of you, releasing into the vacuum of space.

“So what do you think? I think they turned out just fine. Nothing original to be honest, but good enough for a wallpaper haha.” 

“What?” I asked Sam. His aviators partially fell down his nose, showing nothing but sincerity in his eyes. I couldn't understand what he meant. There was nothing in the image. 

“Oh I didn't mean anything by it, the image is great. I'm happy with it…really!” 

Sam rubbed the back of his neck and shot me an awkward smile. 

“Bro what are you talking about, there's nothing on that screen.” 

“Alright dude I already said I didn't mean to offend you, I really do think they turned out good.” 

Sam pushed up his sunglasses and continued to click through the images. He was looking intently at each one as if something really was there. Was I losing it? If I was off the deep end before I don't even know where I am now. 

“You're right Sam the images did turn out great, can you send them to me when you're done processing them?” I said, my tone slightly elevated to indicate I was ready for him to leave. Luckily for me Sam gets those kinds of things and we soon said our goodbyes. 

That night my bed was on fire, the fan was on full blast and I was on my third pillow rotation. But nothing alleviated the hellfire I felt. My bones were heavy, my eyes followed the spinning blades around the fan blending my thoughts together like a smoothie. 

“Come see my light” whispered something in my head. 

I shot up, the feeling of being watched filled the room. It was hot, so hot. My bed was soaking wet from the sweat pouring off my body. I heard a sweet voice, like a mother whispering to her sleeping child. The feeling of being stared at, no, stared through, filled my soul. I wanted to duck under the covers even if it burned my skin. But I felt drawn to the backyard. She wants me out there, the Sun wants me out there. Should I go? Do I have a choice? I’ll keep y’all updated.
