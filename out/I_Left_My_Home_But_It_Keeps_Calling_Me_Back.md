A few weeks after graduation, one of my professors got me this job.
Said it’d be good for me—get out of your hometown, see new places, work instead of sitting at home every day.
I thought it was a good idea.
I’d almost burned through every friendship I had back home.
And my family wouldn’t stop bothering me to find a job and “get out of their ass.”
I had a new girlfriend too, and she made me want to change.
Made me want to be better.
So I packed my stuff, left everything in my old home, and moved here.

A small coastal town that exists mostly to sell boat rides, sightseeing tours, and overpriced souvenirs to people on vacation.
It’s the kind of place that doesn’t feel real in the off-season.
Too many empty hotel rooms.
Too many fake smiles.
And me, stuck behind a desk, answering phones.
They gave me a phone to carry around.
Told me to always answer it.

At first, the calls were normal.
Tourists asking dumb questions.
Families booking day trips.
Guys calling at 2 a.m. to cancel their boat tour because they’re hungover.
That kind of thing.
But somewhere in the second or third week, the calls started changing.

I can’t remember exactly when. The routine makes every day blur together, even the first week felt like a lifetime.
One night the work phone rang just past midnight.
I answered because I needed to. My boss says I have to pick up unless I’m asleep.

The voice on the other end sounded like someone I used to know.
Back home.
This wasn’t some tourist trying to cancel a tour.
This was…
A friend I haven’t talked to since I left.
“Why didn’t you pick up before?” they asked.
Their voice was gritty, buried under static like the call was coming from somewhere far past bad reception.
I checked the screen again. Private number.
I told myself it was a glitch. Or a dream. Something stupid.
I hung up. Turned the phone off.

But the calls kept coming.
Sometimes it was friends I stopped talking to.
Sometimes it was people I didn’t even know—but they knew me.
The phone started ringing at random times—3:11, 4:42, 1:59.
Voices slipping through the line like they were stuck halfway between here and somewhere else.
My head always filled with static after these calls.
I opened them anyway.
I was scared to disappoint my boss.
 
One call came while I was standing in the kitchen, staring at my personal phone because I didn’t know what else to do except wait for calls.
Can’t play games—I might miss a call.
Can’t watch a show or a movie—the Wi-Fi in my apartment is shit.

The work phone buzzed, and I answered without thinking.
The voice on the other end sounded like me.
Not exactly—but close enough.
It sounded rusty, tired.
Like it was already dead but didn’t know it yet.
“You left,” it said.
The words weren’t angry.
Just… resigned. Like they’d been wanting to say them for a long time.
“You left us back here.”
“Just lying around.”
“We are fading without you.”
I tried to say something, but the line clicked off before I could.
Then my ears started ringing so loud I thought they were bleeding, but when I checked, there was nothing. I was fine.
And it was right.

Because the truth is, when I left home, I didn’t just leave my town.
I left people without saying goodbye.
Didn’t even call to say I was moving.
I left friendships unfinished—not that they were working that well to begin with.
I left versions of myself behind that I didn’t want to be anymore.
And now they’re calling.
 
The other calls came fast after that.
I got a call from them again.
I don’t know what they are—they are all different, but they all sounded similar yet different still.
One of the voices was hollow, like he hadn’t slept in weeks.
I think he was taking a second to cry after every word he said.
“Must be nice.”
“Having someone who gives a shit if you’re still breathing or not.”
Then silence.
Like he was waiting for a sorry or—I think—he just wanted me to be there for him.
But I hung up.

After that call, I thought my head was going to burst intoa soup made out of brain… stuff?
My ears started ringing again, and I heard crying coming from seemingly nowhere.
But this time my brain was in pain.
Like it was its first time feeling it.
 
Another call. His voice was sharp, cruel.
“You think you’re better now?” he asked.
“Because you left?”
His breathing got heavier on the other end.
“You’re not better. You’re just far away enough to pretend you are.”
 
After each call, my headaches and ears got worse.
This time it stopped after an hour, I think.
I couldn’t even get to my bed.
I just fell flat on the floor, holding my head, puking.
 
Another night, the phone rang again.
I was sweating before I even answered.
Felt my every muscle tense up.
When I did, I swear I felt something tear inside my head.
I’m not kidding—it was a real sensation, like my forehead muscle just ripped away.
 
“You could’ve stayed,” he whispered.
“Could’ve stayed and dealt with it. But you left it. You left it here for it to keep hurting us.”
The line crackled, but I could hear him gritting his teeth.
“I’m still there,” he said.
“I’m still in that place. Still rotting in it and it hurts.
While you’re out there pretending you’re new, different, better.”
 
My vision flickered in and out like a bad signal.
Static in my ears. Black spots crawling at the edges of everything.
When the phone met with the ground, I was already throwing up in the sink.
My vision kept tilting sideways, like the floor was trying to roll me off.
The pressure behind my eyes built up so bad I thought they’d pop out of my skull.
 
I’ve started losing track of what day it is.
The job feels fake now, like I’m working in a cardboard cutout of a town.
No one here stays.
No one here remembers you when you’re gone.
Except for the phone.
It never forgets.
It remembers every version of me I tried to leave behind.
And it knows I’ll always answer.
 
Sometimes I think about getting rid of it.
Turning it off for good.
Throwing it around just for it to always appear near me again and keep ringing.
 
Last night, the phone rang again.
Battery was dead.
Screen black.
No number, no caller ID.
Just those stupid answer or decline buttons glowing on a screen that shouldn’t have been working.
I answered anyway.
 
It wasn’t one voice this time.
It was all of them layered on top of each other.
Some yelling at me.
Some crying.
Some laughing maniacally.
Some just whispering.
But they all stopped after a while and started talking at the same time in the same monotone voice.
It was my voice.
Not the one people hear.
The one you hear when you’re talking to yourself.
 
“We didn’t get to move on.”
“We didn’t get to start over.”
“We stayed exactly where you left us, still trying to figure out which one of us is real.”
 
I pressed the phone harder against my ear.
I tried to hang up.
I couldn’t.
The last thing I heard was a voice—my voice— All angry, screaming and had a static tone to it yet somehow clearer than the other voices. Like it had been waiting for the right moment to cut through the noise. It said
 
“You can’t run from us. We are you, we will be here forever, waiting for you.”
 
I don’t know how long I’ve been sitting here in silence since that call.
Now that I think about it—it’s too silent.
I didn’t hear anything.
Not even a single crack.
Only my breathing.
I think my ears finally gave up.
The phone is still in my hand.
I think it’s ringing again.
Its screen almost broken, all cracked up.
I can’t hear it.
It’s not even vibrating.
But I can feel the call coming in.
I’ve been feeling it for days—weeks.
It didn’t stop even for a second.
 
Fuck—how long has it been since that call?
For how long have I been sitting here?
 
I can’t stand it anymore.
I think I’ll answer it.
And this time,
I’m not sure I’ll come back from it.
