It’s been three years since the dancing man took her.

It was the first weekend of summer vacation. We lived on a quiet county road in a very safe but rural area in Ohio. We had a large back yard that shared two borders with different corn fields. The other two borders were shared with some woods that had a small but healthy creek running through it. My wife, my daughter and I spent our summers outside enjoying the freedom and safety in what felt like a little slice of heaven.

It felt so normal. The day felt like the first day of summer is supposed to feel. We were on the porch enjoying our coffee. We were just watching her play.

I remember she was picking the clover. Picking clover and befriending a host of harmless insects, discussing her summer plans with them and complimenting the way the sun made their wings look. I thought this is what she was doing when I first saw her chatting to something in the woods. We were so safe. Every instinct told me so. 

He had such a warm and casual demeanor when he stepped out from the tree line. He was old…frail…very thin, even gaunt, and hunched over an old wooden cane. He was dressed in a grey tweed suit and wore a black felt hat with some type of wildflower tucked in the band.

Despite his non threatening appearance and friendly demeanor, the circumstances of his arrival immediately set off every alarm bell and protective fatherly instinct.

It felt like reality was bending. Though panic and adrenaline fueled my pace and the path to my daughter was unobstructed, I could not close the distance. It felt like faulty dream logic had seeped into a waking nightmare. I would trip over imaginary obstacles, get turned around mid-step, feel like my shoes were tied together, or like everything was coated in lubricant. I can’t explain it. Reality was shattering. I couldn’t reach her.

I watched in desperation as the man sweetly presented her with the wildflower from his hat, which she gratefully accepted. 

The man then looked at me with wide unblinking eyes and lifeless grin and began to dance. His dance was unnatural. It lacked rhythm, or any kind of pattern whatsoever. The movement was spasmodic, but felt primal and meaningful. He was unnaturally limber and appeared to be double jointed in several places. He never blinked or broke eye contact. It was grotesque. 

I was about to be sick when my daughter slowly turned to face me. Her face had changed. She was wearing the same empty grinning expression as the man. She turned until she was squarely facing me, at which point she briefly paused before beginning to dance.

She danced in horribly perfect lockstep with the man. Though she didn’t seem to be processing pain, I could hear her joints snap due to the unnatural range of motion the dance demanded. 

Neither of them blinked or broke eye contact as they backed into the woods together, their movements perfectly synchronized.

It’s been three years. No trace of my daughter or the dancing man has ever been found.
