Josh was dancing. Just like he did every day. On the same patch of dried dirt that his feet had worn away the grass of years prior. The air was crisp and sharp, yet that didn’t bother Josh. When he was dancing nothing could stop him. He had been doing this same dance for over 40 years. Same dance, same location, same time, day in, day out.

Just like every other day the locals had come to watch him dance. Some looked out of pure disbelief, even though they had seen the dance hundreds of times, they could never seem to get used to it. Others were there just for the event but didn’t dare look. A few of the children that were present were screaming and crying clung tight to their mothers. Many of the viewers had resorted to violence, picking up what objects they could and tossed them towards Josh. Very few left even left marks as they struck his bare flesh.

 Just like every day Josh was nude. His tallywacker joining in with his hypnotising dance. flopping freely with every jump he made. Josh was just like any other young male in the prime of his life, full of life and energy. The only difference is that he was without a head. That had been lopped off years prior. A futile attempt was made by one of the locals to stop the daily naked waltz. They had rushed him and had their way with a freshly sharpened axe. Took the head clean off his shoulders.

They had all celebrated that night. The whole town got together and danced and celebrated the death of the dancing man. You should have seen their faces when he appeared the day after. Same place, same time. Only this time, fresh volcanic eruptions of crimson replaced where his head should be. Showering the dancing man with a deep crimson war paint that made the dance all the more disturbing.

They tried to ignore him, all stay indoors while the man danced. But that only resulted in a towns person getting plagued, brainwashed, void of all composure. Drawn to the dancing man, to join him in his eternal dance. There were around 16 others who had ended up joining the moonlight masquerade before they gave up on this idea. All stripped bare, free to Mother Nature.

No attempt to wake the cursed locals would work. The only thing that stopped the plague and halted the headless pied pipers calling was to observe. Every local had to come, every night to witness the great dance. Those who didn’t, doomed to join and dance.

This continued for the next 20 years up until the great fire. The town was so preoccupied trying to save what was left of the burning homes and ashes of their supplies. They didn’t even realise the time.

This night Josh did his greatest dance of all. A dance so great that the pull was unbearable. The locals all stopped at the same time, dead in their tracks. struck with sudden shock. Then step by step, springed heel, by tipper toe. They all made their way down the cobbled streets to the clearing and they danced. O’ how they danced. 

Hundreds of bodies. All ages and sizes. All finally together, backlit from the embers that approached down the tree line. They all danced as the fire consumed them. The dancing man’s work was done. His great event now complete. Only one thing to do. On to the next town.
