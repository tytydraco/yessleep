[Yesterday's silly concern.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1cih16m/the_graveyard_down_the_street/)  
  
It was cold the next morning, a cold that chilled the windows and left all of the lawns in Stone Brooke gilded with frost. When I hadn’t heard Nicole stirring by nine, I padded up the stairs and inched our bedroom door open. She was fast asleep, or I guessed she was; my wife was somewhere hidden in the middle of a mountain of blankets. I moved to gently close the door but Nicole must have heard me. She asked me to turn the heat up.  
  
“Are you sick?” I asked. “The heat’s already 70 or so.”  
  
Nicole didn’t respond with words. Instead, she started to…hiss from under the covers. The sound started so low at first I chalked it up to my imagination. But the hissing got louder and louder until I backed out of the room, slamming the door. I fumbled with the thermostat cover before finally getting it open and cranking the heat up to 80-degrees. The hissing gradually trailed off until the house was quiet again.  
  
I went to check on the kids next; both were hanging out in their rooms. Anna was sitting at her window, sketching the view of our new neighborhood. She didn’t notice me so I stood watching her. It always struck me how much Anna looked like her mom with her dark hair, bright eyes, and little Roman nose. Bryan was the opposite, blond like his dad and ever in search of new things to put together or take apart. I found him sitting at his desk, working on assembling his computer from a box marked FRAGILE STUFF CAREFUL CAREFUL CAREFUL.  
  
Bryan was sitting at his desk setting up his computer. Charlie was waiting by the backdoor when I got downstairs so I let him out into the yard and stood on the deck while he did his business. After filling his bowl with kibble, I started searching for anything I could cook for the family for breakfast. We hadn’t made a grocery run since moving in and the food and snacks we’d brought with us for the trip were tapped out.  
  
I closed the last empty cabinet and sighed. Maybe it would be good for us to all get out of the house for breakfast, anyway. A sniffle caused me to freeze, mind snapping back to Nicole’s weirdness the night before. But it was only Anna standing in the living room watching me fail to forage.  
  
“Do you remember where we packed the Pop-Tarts?” she asked.  
  
“I don’t think we brought any, honey-bee,” I said. “We might have to run to the store, first. Do you want-”  
  
I stopped talking when I spotted Nicole watching us from the bottom of the stairs. Bryan was right behind her.  
  
“Do you guys want Pop-Tarts?” Anna asked. “We don’t have any but I think we will soon.”  
  
We gathered together to brainstorm a solution to our lack of groceries. I kept glancing at my wife as subtly as I could. Nothing she was saying was all that strange but the way she was speaking was making me more and more anxious. Nicole peppered her words with brief pauses from time-to-time and longer pauses when she was responding to questions. It was almost like she was double-checking her notes before opening her mouth.  
  
Could it be a head injury? I wondered. That might explain all of it.  
  
But other than the verbal delays, Nicole seemed perfectly healthy. Hell, she was practically humming with energy. It was her suggestion we finally followed to solve the breakfast crisis. She would take the kids on a walk around Stone Brooke so they could explore the neighborhood. I…I wasn’t in favor of the idea at first but I had a hard time articulating why, to my family or to myself.  
  
In the end, with no good reason why Nicole and the kids shouldn’t go on a walk together, I reluctantly agreed. There was one line I drew, however; I would take Charlie with me to the grocery store.  
  
Nicole’s nose was bleeding again, just a trickle of red under her nostril. “Don’t you think the dog would rather be outside on a walk? You can’t leave him in the truck; it’s too cold. And it’s not like you can take him into the store.”  
  
“Sure I can. Hey, your nose again. Are you okay?”  
  
“Are dogs allowed in stores now?” she asked, ignoring me, and quickly wiping above her lip.  
  
“I’ll tell ‘em he’s a service dog if push comes to shove. Won’t be in there for more than fifteen minutes to grab some essentials, anyway. Half an hour tops.”  
  
Something was bothering Nicole; she almost seemed angry. I saw her open and close her mouth a few times like she was attempting to form an argument but the words refused to stumble into existence.  
  
Nicole rubbed her temples. “Fine.”  
  
I was having a hard time swallowing and couldn’t find my keys for the longest time. Anna was the one who finally found them where I’d tossed them behind the television. The three of them stood on the porch while Charlie and I drove away. I know what you’re thinking. I know.  
  
If I wasn’t comfortable leaving my dog with Nicole, how could I ever leave my kids? You have to understand, right then at that moment, I didn’t realize how dangerous my…my wife was to all of us. As far as I could tell, she was just acting a little odd. I never thought she’d hurt them. Never. Never. Keeping Charlie with me was nothing but a reflex, more good luck charm than anything else.  
  
The kids are fine with their mom, I told myself. Everything is fine.  
  
I repeated that mantra over and over in my head the entire drive from Stone Brooke into town. Charlie and I passed acre after acre of empty cornfields on the way into town. The sky was that sharp winter blue that’s so clear it seemed fragile. We got an odd look or two walking into the grocery store but nobody said anything and we shopped fast. Ten minutes after entering the store we were back loading food into the truck then roaring home. I was driving so quickly trying to get back that I caught the attention of a State trooper.  
  
All told, the trip plus ticket ended up taking about forty minutes. I pulled into the driveway like it was a NASCAR pit stop.  
  
“I’m home and I have Pop-Tarts,” I called out as soon as I opened the door.  
  
The house was empty.  
  
“Okay,” I said to Charlie. “It’s been less than an hour. They’re still probably on their walk. Let’s give them a few minutes before worrying, okay?”  
  
I waited for another ten minutes then I called Nicole again. And again. I called her every five minutes for the next half-hour, then every three, then I just kept calling every time it went to voicemail. I was getting near the point where I called the police when Nicole and the kids walked in the front door. All three were covered in dirt.  
  
“What happened?” I asked, running over to Anna.  
  
Her face was dark with soil; black lines ran down from ears, mouth, eyes, and nose. Bryan was the same and neither of them were looking at me, just staring at nothing. Nicole was looking at me, though, watching me closely.  
  
I wiped at Anna’s face. “What happened to you all? Is anybody hurt?”  
  
Nicole shook her head and smiled wide but nobody answered. The only sound was a low growl. I turned to see Charlie backed all the way up to the opposite wall from us, teeth bared, a quiet snarl growing louder until it erupted in a series of vicious barks. I couldn’t stop staring at our dog. Charlie was the sweetest, mildest, afraid-of-his-own-shadow big dog I’d ever met. I would have been less surprised to hear him sing opera then growl at the kids.  
  
“It’s okay, buddy,” I said. “Everything’s okay.”  
  
I held my hand out and Charlie approached, slowly. When he got close, he began to whine. Just as he was starting to calm down, Nicole took a step toward him. More of a lunge, if I’m being honest. Charlie was out the still open door in an instant, running out into the neighborhood and disappearing behind our neighbor’s house before I was on the porch.  
  
“Charlie,” I shouted into the bright, empty day. “Come back.”  
  
I got ready to run off after him but hesitated on the second step. When I turned around, Nicole was watching me from the doorway, still smiling. The kids weren’t in view behind her.  
  
“What happened on your walk?” I asked, forcing myself to sound calmer than I felt. “Why are you all covered in dirt?”  
  
She didn’t answer me. After a few moments of silence, Nicole walked back into the house, walking up the stairs with the kids following in her wake like a pair of remora gliding after a shark. I experienced an intrusive thought watching the three of them: this is not my family.  
  
My family is gone.  
  
I shook that existential crisis off and hesitated. Something was wrong with my wife and my children and, as much as I loved Charlie, they needed to be my priority. Besides, Charlie was a relatively cautious dog and would most likely come back on his own soon enough. Knowing all of that, I still found myself walking out the door instead of up the stairs.  
  
I’ll find him real quick, we will come back and sort everything out with Nicole and the kids, and it’ll all be fine, I told myself as I looked around the sunny neighborhood for any sign of Charlie.  
  
The search was surreal, like I was dreaming. Some part of my mind, a big part, was screaming the entire time that I had to go back home immediately. Something was wrong with Nicole and the kids. They were in danger. They needed me. The thoughts banged around like bricks in a washing machine but, to my shame, I couldn’t force my feet to turn around. The fear was too great; this hanging, heavy dread that yawned behind me all the way back to my house.  
  
I didn’t stop looking for Charlie until I reached the graveyard. The field inside the fence was disturbed, with deep rows furrowed into the dirt in what looked like a completely random pattern. At least two of the graves lay partially open, though I didn’t approach either edge to see how far down the holes went. Everything was rough; not the kind of regular lines and trenches I’d expect to see from heavy equipment or even shovels. It appeared the pits were dug out by hand.  
  
A few minutes of staring at the torn ground snapped me out of whatever fugue state I’d been in all morning. Charlie would be okay on his own; I had to get to the kids, to Nicole. Maybe they were sick, a shared fever that was making them act distant and strange. Or there could be a gas leak at home. I remembered reading that CO2 poisoning could do terrible things to people before becoming lethal.  
  
I got ready to run back home then stopped so suddenly I almost tripped. My eye had caught one of the trenches in the cemetery. It was shallow, maybe a foot deep and three feet long, carving out a slight curve at the base of a crumbling tombstone. At first, I thought pieces from the marker had fallen into the rut. Little white debris stood out against the black dirt. But then I noticed the specks moving.  
  
Near hypnotized, I walked over and knelt on the ground next to the trench for a closer look.  
  
Worms.  
  
Dozens of pale, thick worms the length and width of my little finger squirmed around the hole. There was a smell to them from that close, not awful exactly, but also not something I’d want to buy in candle-form, either. It reminded me of rain and the scent released by trees when they first open in the spring. There was a sharper odor under that; musty and faint.  
  
We had a neighbor who was a hoarder when I was a kid. Dad and I helped clean out their house after they died. I found two dead cats under their sofa, so ancient they were practically mummified. The worm smell was like that house, sickly sweet.  
  
The white worms were milling around while I leaned closer and closer, still trying to convince myself that the shapes were just buried roots. When I was only a yard or so above the trench, all of the creatures suddenly froze. A moment later, they all began stretching up in my direction like flowers turning to face the sun. Then they stretched farther, a cluster of balloon strings reaching out three inches above the dirt, then six, then I was falling back onto my ass, crawling away from the pit.  
  
jumped the low fence at a full sprint, stumbling when I landed but managing not to fall. The way the worms had stretched toward me…it was too deliberate for a bug, too synchronized.  
  
Maybe they were all reacting to my shadow blocking the sun, I thought, rounding the corner beyond the graveyard hill. Maybe-  
  
About a quarter of my neighbors on the adjoining street were watching me run. Men, women, children, even a few pets were out on their lawns or looking from open doorways as I sprinted back to my house. I recognized Walter and June standing in their front yard. The U-Haul was back in their driveway. Even as surreal as my day was going, I still found it odd that they appeared to be moving in now instead of out. Their kids were marching boxes back into the house but stopped to stare as I jogged by. I was struggling for breath by that point, two decades removed from my high school track days with not much running done in-between.  
  
Everyone that I saw out watching me seemed to almost be attached on a hinge, their eyes following me together, synchronized, craning their necks to track me. The way they all turned together made me think of the worms. I ran faster.  
  
It was still late morning when I limped through my front door, utterly spent and gasping for air. Despite the early hour, my house was dark; every curtain was closed and heavy towels were duct taped over the blinds, completely strangling the light.  
  
“Ni…cole,” I wheezed. I cleared my throat and took a deep breath. “Nicole, where are you?”  
  
“Here,” she said, from the kitchen.  
  
I tried flipping the switch next to the door but the living room remained pitch black. Some faint whisper of caution prevented me from ripping the towels and curtains down from the windows even though I desperately missed the light. I compromised by partially opening the front door, allowing a cloudy stream of sunshine to creep into the house. In that dimness, I saw why the switches weren’t working; the bulbs had been removed from the lamp in the corner and the ceiling fan.  
  
The missing bulbs were sitting in a pile on the kitchen table, a small pyramid of glass and filament threatening to roll off at any moment. Nicole was up on a step ladder fiddling with the lighting fixture over the oven.  
  
“Honey,” I asked. “Why are you changing all of the lightbulbs in the house?”  
  
“I’m not,” she said, plucking the bulb from its socket. “I’m just taking them out.” Nicole looked down at me from the stepladder. For a brief moment, I didn’t recognize anything about her. “Could you close the door when you come in? You weren’t raised in a shed, were you?”  
  
“Do you mean a ‘barn?’”  
  
“Sure.”  
  
I didn’t move. “Nicole, what…what is happening?”  
  
My wife hopped off the ladder and added the bulb to the pile. “What do you mean? Be specific? And close that fucking door.”  
  
The last part came out as a hiss. I struggled to swallow and part of me, a large part, wanted to just walk out the door into the sunlight and keep walking. Then I thought of Anna and Bryan and their dull, drained faces, and I decided that whatever the fuck was going on was about to stop.  
  
“You’re not my wife,” I said.  
  
I wasn’t planning on saying that to her but I recognized the truth of it as soon as I blurted it out.  
  
Nicole nodded. “It feels better to say it out loud, doesn’t it? She thought you would have figured it out earlier but it’s okay. We know it’s a lot.”  
  
Her agreeing with me was the last thing I expected. Laughter, annoyance, confusion, even outright anger I could have dealt with but her casual acceptance of an insane thought made my brain reset. While I stood, open-mouthed and dumb, Nicole walked past me into the living room. I heard the door close gently and then the light was gone completely. My wife’s homemade blackout curtains left the kitchen one big shadow I was soaking in.  
  
“Sit down and I’ll tell you everything and then I’ll ask you a question,” Nicole instructed, walking back into the room.  
  
I fumbled around until I caught hold of the back of a chair then dropped into it. My eyes were adjusting to the gloom; there was just enough light leaking in that I could make out shapes and forms, if not details. So I heard more than saw Nicole sit across from me at the table.  
  
“This is scary,” Nicole began. “But everything will be fine as long as you pay attention. Your wife is safe.”  
  
In the dark kitchen, her voice sounded less like her voice than before. Thinner.  
  
“Where’s my wife?” I said, barely able to get the words out.  
  
“Right here,” Nicole said. “Your kids, too.”  
  
A ringing started in my ears and it was hard to breathe normally, like I had to fight for escaping oxygen.  
  
“What is happening? What the hell is going on, Nicole? Why are you acting…”  
  
“Different?” she asked.  
  
“Insane,” I countered.  
  
She wrinkled her nose like I’d just commented on new wrinkles on her face.  
  
“Some cognitive inconsistency should be expected during the transfer,” Nicole said. “Your wife resisted. Aggressively. That resistance caused a lot of damage before it was put under control. Her mind isn’t exactly what it used to be.”  
  
My night vision was fully in and just good enough that I could see my wife leaning over the table between us. It wasn’t quite clear enough for me to be sure but it did seem like she was smiling.  
  
“You sound fucking crazy,” I managed. “I’m going to call an ambulance.”  
  
I tried standing up until only to feel an iron-strong hand push me back into the chair.  
  
Bryan put a hand on my other shoulder, as well, rooting me in place.  
  
“Relax, dad,” he said, voice rough like he was recovering from a cold. “Just listen to what she has to say.”  
  
I struggled against my son for a moment but he was immovable. Anna was with us in the kitchen, too; I could make out her silhouette watching from the corner.  
  
“If this is a family prank or something…it’s great,” I said, trying not to shake. “It’s hilarious. Let’s go outside and laugh about it.”  
  
“Too bright,” Nicole whispered. “We don’t like it. Now, I’m sensing the same resistance from you that your wife had. That’s a caustic emotion, you know. Your stubbornness.”  
  
Nicole slid her chair away from the table and padded behind me deeper into the kitchen. I tried to turn with her but Bryan held me tight. She began humming softly, which was occasionally interrupted by the rasp of metal drawn across wood. When Nicole sat back down across from me, there was a long knife in her hand.  
  
“I used to remember what specific task this one was for,” she sighed, jamming the tip of the blade into the table. “Another memory lost because she had to put up a fight. Anna, sweetie, turn on the kitchen light for your dad but thumb the dimmer down, okay?”  
  
“What are you doing?” I asked as the weak but sudden light left me blinking. “Why do you-OH GOD STOP.”  
  
Nicole splayed her left hand out on the table at an angle. She pressed down on the knife, causing the edge to drop down like a paper cutter. The knife took off almost all of her pinky, most of her ring and middle fingers, and the tip of her index. The room was silent until I’d sucked in enough air to start screaming. Nicole’s expression was half-way between patient and bored.  
  
“Look close,” she said, pushing her maimed hand closer.  
  
Spurts of blood gushed from little, white veins, already soaking into the tablecloth. I gathered a deep breath to scream again then choked when I got a better look at the blood vessels, which were already slipping away into her hand.  
  
Worms.  
  
The worms inside of Nicole’s ruined fingers were the same pale color as the ones from the graveyard, only these were smaller and thinner than the goliaths I’d seen squirming in the ground.  
  
“Wh... … …what?” I gasped.  
  
Anna brought her mom a dish towel from the sink, which Nicole wrapped around her new stumps.  
  
“Don’t worry,” my wife promised, “they’ll grow back. That’s one of the gifts we can give you. It is a shame about the few we lost,” she added, nodding toward the pile of digits bleeding out on the table. “But I do believe this has saved us a heck of a lot of time getting you caught up, right dear?”  
  
I couldn’t answer, couldn’t break away from staring at Nicole’s fingers. They were twitching as tiny white worms and pieces of worms fled the flesh. Blackness closed in quick and the next thing I remember is waking up in the living room on the couch. Nicole, Anna, and Bryan were all sitting around me, Nicole still pressing a red towel to her hand.  
  
“Are you okay, daddy?” Anna asked.  
  
I sat up, slowly. “What the fuck are you and what did you do to my family?”  
  
Nicole smiled. “It’s us. We’re us. Just different. And more. A lot more, actually. You saw the cemetery already, right? Down the road?”  
  
“Couldn’t really miss it,” I whispered.  
  
“Everything started there,” Nicole continued. “Now, a long time ago–long for you but even longer for us–we crawled there in the dark earth thinking nothing, blind, deaf, and dumb. But then the Voice. Oh, the lovely Voice.”  
  
My wife was smiling; Anna and Bryan looked nearly rapturous.  
  
“She came and spoke to us every single day after they buried her husband,” Nicole continued. “He was a farmer and she was his devoted wife. They used to live here when this was only one little farmhouse and acres and acres of fields. She visited his grave each morning and evening for many, many years. The widow left her dead husband flowers and gifts but, best of all, she talked to him. Which meant that she also talked to us as we ate what was left of him. Oh, and she sang.”  
  
Anna and Bryan began humming a catchy tune that I slowly recognized.  
  
“They'll throw in dirt and they'll throw in rocks,” Nicole sang. “And they won't give a dam-m-n if they break the box. The worms go in, the worms go out, the worms dance nightly up-on your snout.”  
  
Nicole wrinkled her nose again, this time with a grin.  
  
“We listened,” she told me, leaning over the couch. “We listened and learned from the Voice. She told such wonderful stories. She made the world sound perfect and good, each memory of a day with the Farmer seemed worth a thousand of our lives. The widow made us envious, you understand? We began to hate the Voice in our own, tiny, mindless way. We hated her constant, mewling joy.  
  
“It wasn’t fair that she got to live above, to feel seasons, to feel anything. That hate brought us together, made us less deaf and blind and dumb but there was only so much we could process as we were. So we decided to change. To grow. To take from you everything that we were lacking. To make the world fair. Do you understand? Or would you like to see more?”  
  
Now it was Anna holding the kitchen knife, the tip of it just under one bright, blue eye.  
  
“I don’t mind showing you, daddy. Nothing hurts anymore.”  
  
“Stop,” I moaned. “Please, God, stop. Stop. Stop. STOP IT STOPITSTOPSTOPSTOPSTOPSTOP.”  
  
“Easy, dear,” Nicole cooed, brushing the stumps of her missing fingers across my cheek. “There’s no need to be upset. We won’t show you anymore. We know you understand.”  
  
I turned away from her touch. There was a smear of her blood from my nose down my jaw and something else, something more solid. Something squirming.  
  
“Fuck.” I wiped my face clean against a couch cushion. “This isn’t real.”  
  
Nicole sighed. “It is real. Say it. Say it now or see everything.”  
  
She lifted the hem of her shirt to just above her belly button. Her stomach was a mass of knots, twisting and untwisting just under the skin. Anna handed her the knife.  
  
“It’s real,” I whimpered. “It’s real, I understand, it’s real, I’ll do whatever you want, it’s real, it’s real, I believe you. Don’t show me anymore.”  
  
The three of them were smiling, beaming even. Nicole put the knife on the coffee table and smoothed out her shirt.  
  
“I knew you’d get it,” she said. “They weren’t sure you’d be the right one but we knew.”  
  
“Right one for what?”  
  
“Well, here’s the question I mentioned earlier: have you ever wanted to be a tour guide?”  
  
I couldn’t stop staring at the red and white stain on the cushion. Parts of it were still moving. I turned the pillow over.  
  
“Huh?” I asked.  
  
There was a knock at the door that stopped Nicole from answering. Bryan walked over and opened the door. A few of our neighbors walked inside, then a few more. I recognized Walter and June and their children along with a dozen more I had only glimpsed during my walks with Charlie or hadn’t seen at all.  
  
Everyone was watching me, waiting.  
  
I understood. Slowly, terribly, inevitably; I understood.  
  
“Of course,” I sobbed. “I’ve always wanted to. Where do we start? What do you want to see?”  
  
We put up posters for Charlie all over Stone Brooke. He’s been missing nearly a week but I’m sure he’ll turn up. I thought I saw him a few days back at the edge of the forest but it couldn’t have been him. That dog had the same dark gray coat as Charlie but it ran off as soon as I called his name and threw a rock at the tree next to him.  
  
But I’m sure he’ll turn up. The whole neighborhood is keeping an eye out. They really are lovely folks and there are more moving in every day. I doubt there will be any houses still available within, oh, three or four months, at most.  
  
That was fine with us. It meant our property value would keep going up, up, up and away.  
  
We started a neighborhood watch; movie nights, too. Mostly documentaries but a great mix of everything. We set up a projector and screen right outside the little graveyard so families can set up lawn chairs around the stones and spend the whole night together.  
  
I even got elected as secretary of the HoA. It mostly involves planning: planning community events, open houses, and trips. Gosh, so many trips.  
  
Museums, theme parks, beaches, cities; there’s so much curiosity in Stone Brooke. Just another of the million reasons this place is so perfect with the most incredible neighbors. Lovely folks, all of them.  
  
Lovely, lovely folks.  
  
Lovely.
