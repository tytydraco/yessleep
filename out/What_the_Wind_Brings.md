I don’t leave town for hurricanes. It’s part of growing up with them. My grandfather waited out every storm on his screened-in patio with a cigarette hanging from his mouth. Sure the rocking chair might slide a couple feet, and he’d grumble, but he never went inside. Grandma, scarier than any hurricane, didn’t allow smoking near the grandchildren, and she was happy to let him waste his time in the rain.

I’m not quite as brave as my grandfather. I board up my windows and pile sandbags at the door. There’s a fat emergency medical kit next to rows of baked beans, green peas, and mixed fruit underneath my kitchen sink. Category fours have slammed trees into the walls of my apartment and I’ve slept through every one. When it gets really bad I get away from the windows and spend the night in the interior bathroom. I never leave.	

Hurricane Niles didn’t look like anything new on the radar. Sure, it was big, and it was going to make landfall with 140 mile per hour winds, but I’ve been through worse. I watched news footage of the initial impact as the zephyr ripped umbrellas from beaches and shook piers across Florida’s west coast. The ocean was hungry, swelling over docks and stealing away whatever it could gather. Shutters and roofing tiles flew off and destroyed windshields. Store signs ripped themselves apart and rode the air for a block or two before shattering against walls, streets, and cars.

As intense as hurricane footage can be, a category 4 was cause for caution, not panic. Being inland helps a lot. It gives time for the hurricane to weaken as it passes over Tampa or Miami. I expected Niles to be a category 3 by the time it hit me.

Then Niles sucked up enough hot water on the coast to become a category 5. Even my parents called and said they were going to run upstate to try and beat the worst of it. I assured them that the storm would calm down some by the time it hit us. They disagreed, and they were right to.

I finished my preparations hours before Niles reached me. My defenses looked watertight from the outside, but inside I could see slivers of light between the thick plywood sheets that covered my windows. It would have to do. I came to think of it as a blessing, since one of the gaps was just large enough to let me watch the house across the street.

Most of my neighbors evacuated the day before. The family across the street was an exception. Their windows were exposed and the yard was covered with plastic tchotchkes ranging from pink flamingos to fat concrete frogs. A shaky picket fence surrounded their front yard at hip-height. Their license plates were from New York.

The inside of their home, or what I could see of it, was full of shelves and knick-knacks. Commemorative mouse ears stuck out from behind a row of snow globes while a singing bass waited just inside the hallway for someone to activate its motion sensor. The kitchen was all the way to the right with its harsh white overhead light and cluttered countertops. In the living space between the kitchen and bedrooms, their television faced me from above a brick fireplace. The hint of a long couch stretched the length of the windowsill.

I try to give people their privacy. The way I see it, if you snoop in on somebody else’s business then you have no right to complain when they look in on you too. Still, between the lack of house-prep and piles of bagged yard trash on the lawn, I felt the need to stick my nose where it didn’t belong. The father, a tired man in his mid forties with sunken eyes and jolly cheeks, came to the door. I got him to clear his yard with me, but we didn’t accomplish much aside from gathering his yard trash under a tarp. He said he was happy to let God handle the rest.

I gave up on my doomsaying and went back to my apartment. I made sure to fill every piece of tupperware in my kitchen with filtered water. This is in addition, of course, to the dual 24-packs of bottled water I kept beneath the sink. The sky was graying fast and the wind picked up enough to tell me that the tarp over the neighbor’s trash wasn’t going to make it. Already it pulled at the stakes and filled with air from below like a balloon. To make things worse, this was all preamble. A series of gentle warnings from Niles. We weren’t even in his arms yet, and the eye wall marched across the radar in our direction.

I made the best use of my electricity while I had it. The weather was still gentle enough that I sat at my computer without fear of a power surge. I peeked through my boards and saw the classic American family at work through the windows across the street. Mother was in the kitchen with her apron while Sister and Brother played games on the television. Father sat on the couch, the back of his bald spot shining in the streetlight, just watching them. 

The storm came in fast from there. The wind grew as dead branches flew from shaking trees. A corner of the neighbor’s tarp was loose, ripped from the stake, and leaves billowed out from below like smoke. The weather app confirmed my assumption: we were in the outer layer of the hurricane. The only saving grace was that it had, indeed, fallen in strength to a category 4.

Niles, by way of introduction, threw a dead palm frond on my power lines. Sparks of electricity buzzed at a few connection points like little dots of hot plasma. After clearing it with a long stick, I decided it was time to unplug the expensive electronics and stick to my decade-old personal dvd player for entertainment.

The clouds moved like time-lapse footage. The lazy pace of the last few days was replaced by sudden speed and the rain followed. I would’ve called it a real downpour if it were any other day, but we were still just getting started.

The family across the street had their power. Mother finished her cooking and called the others into the kitchen. Father received two large scoops of stew first. Brother and sister, about thirteen and fifteen from the look of it, elbowed each other until the older shoved her way to the front. She smirked at the younger, and his scowl promised that he would get her back for that. Mother, sensing a learning opportunity, served brother first. I laughed as the kids traded expressions.

I focused on my movies for a while after that. Just because I could spy on them didn’t mean I had the right. I made an exception when the first crack of thunder burst overhead with a bright flash of lightning.

Their house was dark now, and I could only just make out the shape of things inside. I thought Father was still in his seat, and maybe Mother did the dishes with bottled water. No sign of the children. I would've been in my room at their age.

Candles appeared one by one as Mother walked the length of the house with a book of matches. Father, rising from his seat for the first time in hours, followed her with an emergency lantern. They lit each candle one at a time, not talking, just looking at one another with the satisfaction of folks whose emergency preparations have paid off. 

The storm, of course, grew worse. My own yard was clear of rubbish, but I did not like the look of the old palm tree next door as it swayed and shook. My amateur assessment told me that it would fall on their house if it came to that. My more immediate problem was that the roar of the gale drowned out my little dvd player’s buzzy speakers. The weather app informed me that tornadoes were forming to the south. 

A splintering crack broke through the pandemonium. In the time between turning off my entertainment and checking the situation, the palm tree had slammed into the roof of the house next door, leaving a massive hole for the rain to pour through. The fence between us bent and splintered under the weight of the trunk. Their power was out.

Across the street, the tarp tore itself loose and followed the rain until the air stream lifted it up and took it far over the neighborhood. A similar but vague item, maybe a huge trash bag or black canvas tent, flew up from beneath the fallen palm tree next door. I wouldn’t have thought much of it, but it soared to the clouds and came back down like someone dropped a brick on it. The canvas dived somewhere I couldn’t see. The tarp never returned.

My own lights flickered and I got wise enough to take my eyes off the neighbors for a while. My ears, however, kept me informed. A window shattered. A long high whistle like a large bird sounded overhead and was cut off by sudden creaking as the fence behind me fell flat against the lawn with a wet slap. Nothing else made it to me over Niles’s deafening wail.

The constant wind started to have an effect on my nerves. When I was a kid, hiding under my covers, my mother told me that the wind wasn’t anything to be scared of. It was what the wind brought with it that could hurt you. It comforted me then, but now it makes me remember that anything can be a fatal projectile. Something clattered against my back window and I wondered if it would’ve broken through without my preparations.

The heavy splatter of rain marched on until, over the course of about twenty minutes, it stopped altogether. I unlocked my door and stepped outside to a windless night. The moon shone down over us while I stared up at it through the eye of the storm. Everything was quiet and the sudden silence gave everything an unsettling stillness.

The eye can last anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, depending on the storm. I double checked the walls and knocked more sticks from my power lines. As suspected, the fence behind me was flat and my next door neighbor’s roof looked even worse in the moonlight. There were no cars in the driveway, but I walked over the fallen fencing and knocked on their back door to be sure. No answer.

In the home across the street, about half of the candles were still lit and I could make out the top of Father’s head on the couch. Mother was gone, but it was well past midnight by then and I assumed she was in bed. A pale light, new to me, lit a small portion of the kitchen. Straining my eyes, I made out Sister’s head pressed up to a laptop screen. There must have been a dining room table that I couldn’t see.

Clouds approached from the west and I gave the house a wave goodbye to show I’d been staring out of concern. Sister, to my slight embarrassment, waved back. I gave her an awkward thumbs up and she did the same. The first of the new rain began as a few heavy drops on my shoulders and grew in seconds to a proper downpour. I was in my house and toweling off by the time the wind returned.

Not only did it return, but it did so with great violence. It was as though Niles was upset that we’d received a break from his wrath and would now, without holding back, make a demonstration of his power. The wind, almost deafening before, was now oppressive. I found it difficult to move and harder to relax from the mental weight of it. I stood in my kitchen without moving for half an hour before a whistle, identical to the strange bird-call I heard before, shook me out of it. It was much louder this time, beginning high and ending low, and another crash followed it.

I thought I could categorize any sound or object that Niles threw at me. The noise of a falling fence sounded different to a shaking tree or a collapsed roof. That whistle, however, sounded more like a falling bomb. I had no label for such a thing and, for that reason, I braced myself against the wall whenever I heard it.

It was about time for me to retreat to the bathroom. A rare thunderclap vibrated my windows and rattled my teeth as I gathered up a few water bottles and a handful of protein bars in a tote bag.

Another whistle screeched with the wind, louder than the others by a large margin, and crashed down like a cannonball. When I checked it, again peeking through my front window, I found nothing in my yard. Across the street, however, rain poured through a shattered kitchen window.

Father still rested on the couch, less than ten feet from the break. I assumed he was trapped in a deep sleep. Mother, who must have been resting her head on his lap, stood and stared at something below the edge of the window. I wondered what broke the glass. A branch was the likeliest suspect. 

She used the end of a broom to lift up something like a black sheet. It was the same kind that the wind took from beneath the palm tree next door. I watched her lower the broom, but the sheet did not fall with it.
Mother stepped back. It hung from a point in the air like it was stuck on a coat rack. We watched together as it seemed to fill out, inflating until it became a floating cloak draped over large shoulders. It, I realized, was not storm debris, but a man in a raised hood that stood before the horrified Mother.

Someone, under the cover of the storm, must have broken through the window to rob the house. Maybe they, like me, had trouble seeing the people inside and picked a full house by mistake. I wasted no time in getting my bat from behind the couch, but the wind kept me inside. My door would not budge against the outside pressure. Throwing my shoulder into it let the smallest draft of air pass through before sealing shut again.

I hurried to the window. I could not see the burglar anymore. Mother held his cloak in her arms with it draped over one shoulder behind the broken window. The storm, I thought, must have been playing tricks on me. Father stood, stretching his arms, and jolted at the broken window. If I were him, I would see my wife, notice that the rain was soaking her from the waist down, and call her name. If he did, she did not respond.

Another whistle shrieked overhead. It was the nearest one yet. Again I felt the need to drop and brace myself before it landed, but I did not. I raised my head to the window in time to see another sheet fall like a rocket from above. It made contact with the family’s roof and punched through with a sound like thunder.

Wreckage buried Father like a magic trick. There one second, gone the next. The punctured ceiling retched broken boards upon him and left bits of wire and insulation hanging from above.

The children, God help them, appeared in the living room window and stared with open mouths. Sister, gathering her wits first, covered Brother’s eyes and forced him back down the hall. She returned alone and crawled over the couch to get past the fallen debris and kneel in front of her father. I had to assume that’s what she was doing. I could still see no sign of him from the window.

Mother, unmoving, held the sheet as the warm rain poured in through the break. Without warning, she collapsed like a dropped weight.  The cloak remained standing and filled out into the shape of a hooded man. Sister and Father rose up, the latter being supported by the former, while a second cloak stood from amongst the rubble.

I screamed until my throat hurt. I wanted to call in the neighborhood cavalry. I’d seen the big trucks in front of the house behind me. If they stayed, they might still hear me. Or it might startle the bizarre attackers across the way. It could do something, in the right circumstances.

Instead, the cloaks leapt, spreading open like falling parachutes, and covered the fleeing Father and Sister. They stood with the cloaks draped over them until their legs buckled and they collapsed. The cloaks floated there for a moment, perhaps in thought, before levitating down the bedroom hallway.

The two cloaks returned, seeming more solid in their odd shoulders, and turned toward me. Not toward my house. Toward me. I made eye contact with their strange faces, hidden until this moment. I believed that their large eyes were painted on until they blinked. Their features were like pale dolls with deep red stains around their large mouths. I couldn’t see anything of their bodies. The cloaks hid too much.

We watched each other. The one on the left deflated and fell. A moment later it flew up like it was caught in the wind and raced into the sky. I realized that the near-black clouds above the house were full of even darker black streaks. The gale carried them in its spiral and spat them out whenever the zephyr called. 
The cloaked one in the window stayed much longer than its companion. I think I knew what it was waiting for. My neighbor’s power was off when the tree fell onto their house. The family’s power was out when their window and roof were pierced. I told myself that I would be safe as long as my electricity lasted.

The downside was that another branch hung from the faulty wire outside. It made my lights flicker before stabilizing again. I have no idea what time it was. Everything in me screamed that the thing across the way would strike the moment I broke eye contact. It was a childish rule. I watched the other one fly away, after all.

There’s no telling how long we stood there. The diving sheets whistled on and crashed through the night. I had moments when I knew, with all my heart, that it would never end. This was hell and I was locked in a staring contest with the devil.

Two whistles heralded another massive crack followed by a splintering break. The wall of my neighbor’s plastic shed soared into my yard. It struck the covered window in front of my eye. I flinched from my post for a fraction of a second and the hooded doll was gone.

I ran into the bathroom and wrapped myself in a blanket. My bathroom has no large windows, but the door has small frosted glass squares. In a normal storm it would never be a problem. In a normal storm, I wouldn’t have seen the vague impression of a hooded man on the other side.

My power flickered again. I saw the figure’s sea green eye pressed against the door. There was also, I knew, a small porch light outside. If I was right, and they hated light, or electricity, or whatever, then I had to try and chase it off before my power went out for good. The light switch was to the left of the door. I wouldn’t even have to go outside.

My legs shook like I couldn’t believe, but I managed to steady myself on my washing machine. The thing’s mouth was open. It had no teeth aside from two long fangs which jutted down from its upper jaw. One of the teeth scratched lines across the glass that separated it from me. 

I summoned my strength and raced for the lightswitch. I flicked it and dove back behind the foux-safety of my washer. The window glowed with a bright yellow light. There was no more sign of the cloaked thing.

To condense the next hour of waiting into a single sentence: I made it. The lights held until morning and by then the storm was on its last legs. Grey light shone through the last of the gathered clouds and gave everything a strange weight to it. Realizing I still had power, and that my home was unharmed, I burst out of my front door and ran to the house across the street. Not bothering with the door, I peered in from the broken window. 

I found Mother first. She was face-down in the broken glass and thinner than the night before. The fat and muscle of her body seemed to have disappeared. It left her wrinkled like crumpled paper. Her limbs, near-skeletal, curled on themselves like spider legs. The soles of her bare feet were covered in various white scratches from the glass, but there was no blood.

Sister and Father lay crumbled together, their skin torn in bloodless chunks where they fell on the sharp ceiling debris. His body covered hers, maybe trying to protect her, or maybe by accident. Their thin arms curled around each other in a weak embrace. The collapsed ceiling showed the sky. The hole was large enough for me to crawl through.

I found Brother in his room down the hall.

I called 911 when cell service returned. I didn’t mention ghouls or flying sheets or vampires. I told them that there was a home intruder and the ceiling collapsed while he was in the house. No, I didn’t get a good look at him. Yes, I’m certain of what I saw. No, I don’t know how their bodies ended up in that state.

It felt important to stay at the house until emergency services removed the family. Each came out under a covered sheet. I cried until one of the paramedics tried to drape a blanket over my shoulders. Then I screamed. Everything from the night played through my head in fast forward, which was useful because I remembered the sheet that flew out of the house next door. A few minutes later a police officer called the medical workers through the opening made by the fallen tree. A heavy stretcher came out with another bent corpse. 

I cleared my yard and gathered the fallen tree limbs by the side of the road. I cleaned both of my neighbor's places as well. It didn’t feel like enough, even after stacking enough lumber to form a wall between me and the house across the street, but what else can you do for the dead?

In the months that followed, the police followed up once or twice to ask more questions. No arrests have been made. Part of me still hopes I was wrong about what I saw and some chain smoking detective will find a mundane explanation. Things like this just don’t happen.

It's been almost a year since Niles came to town. I promised myself that I’d be in a different apartment by now, but rents skyrocketed all around me. There wasn’t anywhere else for me to go. Another storm, Hurricane Tanis, is forming right now over the Gulf of Mexico. There is almost no doubt that she will be a category 5 when she reaches central Florida. Once again, the eye is projected to pass right over me.

I tried to find a way out of state, but it was a hard year and not even my parents have the money for their own tickets out of here. To make matters worse, they’re insisting that they stay with me. Niles, they told me, almost rolled their trailer. I can’t tell them what happened last year. I’m letting them stay.

There is always the chance that I’m wrong about all of this. Maybe I’m hallucinating. A gas leak could be responsible for the hooded things outside. A misfire in my brain could explain everything but the damage, and the bloodless death. I think I’d rather be crazy.

Tanis is heading my way now. I’ve boarded my windows. I’ve readied my water. There’s emergency food enough for twelve under the bathroom sink. Six high-lumen flashlights wait on their charging ports, as they’ve done for the past three days. I tell myself I am ready. I tell myself the power will hold again this year and that my family will be safe. I know that I have no guarantees. All I can do is prepare. All I can do is hope that the wind will not bring any more of those things to my door.

Everything else is up to luck.
