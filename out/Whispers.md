I, like many others, have a compelling urge to keep my house clean. Not the normal, standard level of cleanliness but to the point where every surface in the house needs to be as reflective as a mirror and the house itself smell better than freshly picked roses. As you would expect, this leads to me spending a lot of time in the cleaning isle of my local supermarket, to the point where i know the place inside out. I could probably walk the place and pick out all my cleaning products blindfolded. But thats beside the point.

If it wasn’t for my freakish level of obsession around cleanliness, I wouldn’t be in such a dire situation. But theres no going back now. I got myself into this situation and it’s entirely my fault. i just hope maybe this post will give you the information i never got and just maybe save you the pain i was inflicted with

As I was browsing the almost endless shelves of antibacterial spray and kitchen cleaner, something caught my eye that shouldn’t have. It was an air freshener. Yet, something was off. It looked out of place, like it didn’t belong. Unlike other ones with elegant floral patterns and exquisite sounding scents, this one was matt black, with nothing but , “Whispers”, printed on the front in block capitals. Even stranger, it was the only one there, even though it didn’t seem like the type of product to sell out quickly. 

I needed it. But I had a feeling the staff wouldn’t let me purchase it, due to it having no barcode. I resorted to stashing it in my rather large coat pocket.

When i returned home, i placed all my purchased products in their designated
places and got to cleaning my kitchen for the 3rd time today. Since it had already been cleaned, i didnt need to spend too much time on it. When i was done, and i could see my reflection on every surface as if they were mirrors, i sprayed some of the new air freshener. But i didnt smell anything. Instead, i heard. I heard whispers. In shock, i dropped it and stumbled back, unsure as to where the voice had come from. I brushed it off as my imagination but they came again when i sprayed it. 

At first they were just noises, but the more i sprayed it, the more it began to form words. The voice was heavily distorted, but i could start to make out the words. It spoke horrors. So called, “Truths”, that i didnt want to hear. Yet, i couldnt put it down. It told me of the world and its secrets. However, the most disturbing part by far was when it began to talk about my personal life. 

Its for that very reason i write this as a warning to you all. I stand over my wife’s cheating body and my cannibalistic dads corpse, not knowing if the spray told me truths or lies. None of that matters now. I need to know more. 

No matter the circumstances, dont spray it. You wont like what the Whispers tell you.
