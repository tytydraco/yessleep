**I Accidentally Stopped Time**

I don’t know if anyone will read this. I don’t know if anyone *can* read this. Sometimes I’m not even sure I’m real anymore, and I think if I write this down—if I put it into words—it will make everything stop unraveling. Or maybe it’ll speed it up. At this point, I don’t care. I just want it to end.  

I stopped time. I didn’t mean to, but I did, and I’m trapped here now, and I think something else is trapped here with me.

---

It started with a wish. Not the birthday-candle, genie-in-a-lamp kind, but the kind that slips out of your mouth when you’re not paying attention. The kind you think doesn’t matter because the universe isn’t supposed to be listening. But maybe it was.  

I saved a woman’s life. I don’t know her name. She looked ordinary—like someone you’d pass a hundred times in a grocery store and never notice. She stepped into traffic without looking, and I pulled her back just before a delivery truck could flatten her. She stared at me, breathless, and said, “You’ve given me my life. Let me give you something back. Your next wish—granted.”  

I laughed it off. Who wouldn’t?  

A month later, running late for work, I forgot my wallet. I cursed under my breath and muttered, “I wish I could just stop time.”  

And then it happened.

---

The first thing I noticed was the silence. Not just the absence of sound, but a silence so deep it felt like the world had stopped breathing. A bird hung motionless in the air, its wings curved mid-flap. Cars on the street were frozen, their drivers staring straight ahead like wax figures in a museum.  

I reached up and poked the bird. It didn’t move.  

I thought I was dreaming at first, but dreams don’t last this long.  

It’s always 8:07 AM. July 8th. The sun is stuck low in the eastern sky, casting long shadows that never shift. I’ve walked thousands of miles, and it’s *still* July 8th. I’ve circled back to where I started more times than I can count, trying to find something—*anything*—that will fix this.  

There is nothing.  

---

At first, I panicked. I screamed until my throat burned. I ran to my wife, shook her, begged her to wake up. She didn’t. Her eyes were open, staring past me, her lips frozen mid-smile. Even my dog was still, stuck mid-roll in his bed, his tongue lolling out of his mouth.  

The loneliness was unbearable. I sat in the street and cried until I couldn’t anymore. Then I stood up, broke into a bakery, and ate an entire tray of danishes. What else was I supposed to do?  

---

The first year—or what I guessed was a year—was survival. Supermarkets were full of food, and water still flowed when I turned the tap, though I didn’t dare question why. I stopped sleeping properly after a while. The sky never changed, and my body no longer seemed to care about time. I napped when I couldn’t stay awake anymore, curling up on park benches or in strangers’ beds.  

After survival came boredom.  

I started wandering. First my city, then the surrounding towns. I walked west until the shadows started to grow shorter—until the sky began to glow faintly brighter. I kept walking, and soon it hit me: I’d crossed a time zone. The sun was rising because, technically, it was earlier where I’d arrived.  

That’s when I realized how big this was. Time wasn’t just stopped where I was. It was stopped *everywhere*.  

I kept walking.

I reached the west coast eventually. I don’t know how long it took. Months? Years? The Pacific was still, its surface glassy and unbroken by waves. I walked along the shoreline, listening to the sound of my own footsteps.  

It was then that I noticed the first sound that wasn’t me.  

A soft tapping, faint and distant, like footsteps on stone. It was so quiet I thought I’d imagined it, but every time I stopped walking, it was there. I turned around, but there was no one behind me. There was never anyone behind me.  

I left the coast and headed south, cutting through deserts and abandoned highways, past frozen cities and motionless forests. The tapping followed me.  

---

After a while, the tapping changed. It grew louder, more distinct, until it sounded like claws clicking against tile. It wasn’t behind me anymore—it was *around* me, everywhere at once. Sometimes I caught glimpses of movement out of the corner of my eye: shadows shifting in shadows, shapes too tall and thin to be human.  

And then the whispers started.  

At first, they were just sounds, soft and indistinct, like wind through dead leaves. But they grew louder. They began to form words.  

“We know you’re here.”  

---

I turned east, walking until the ocean turned into plains, then forests, then mountains. The whispers followed me, growing louder and more insistent.  

“We know you’re here.”  

I started talking back. I screamed at the sky, at the frozen people, at the whispers themselves. I begged them to show themselves, to stop hiding in the shadows.  

But they didn’t.  

---

The worst part is the way the world feels *wrong* now. At first, everything was frozen, yes, but it was familiar. Comfortable. Now, it’s… off. The shadows are longer than they should be, stretching in directions that don’t make sense. Reflections don’t match the objects casting them. Buildings look normal until you stare at them too long, and then they seem to *breathe*.  

I don’t think the world is frozen anymore.  

I think it’s… rotting.  

---

I reached Key West a few days ago. Or weeks. Or months. Time doesn’t matter anymore. The whispers are constant now, overlapping in an endless cacophony. I can’t understand them anymore, but I don’t think they’re trying to talk to me.  

Last night, I saw something in the water.  

The ocean was black, as still as ever, but something was rising out of it. A figure, impossibly tall, its limbs stretched like shadows across the surface. Its head was wrong, twisted at an angle that hurt to look at. It didn’t move, but I could feel it staring at me.  

I ran.  

---

I’m in a hotel now, barricaded in a room on the top floor. The whispers are louder than ever, and I can hear the tapping outside the door. It’s not claws anymore. It’s something *wet*, slapping against the floor, like raw meat dragged across stone.  

I’m writing this because I need you to understand. This isn’t about me. This is about *us*.  

Time didn’t stop.  

*We* stopped.  

And something else started.  

---

The sound is inside the room now.  

It’s here.  

---

If you’re reading this—if you’re *real*—don’t wish for anything. Don’t *ask* for anything.  

The universe doesn’t give gifts. It makes deals.  

And it’s always hungry.
