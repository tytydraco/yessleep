I work with an Aeromedical evac unit for the military. Our job is to treat and evacuate wounded soldiers in dangerous situations. Recently, my unit was assigned to a military facility known as the Tantalus Site where they developed a deadly biological toxin that wrought unimaginable havoc on their test subjects. A leak at the compound was reported before the entire place went dark.

When we arrived, we encountered a mess of people torn apart by something monstrous, I was chased by emaciated humanoids, and we were told by the final survivor that the creatures were in fact prisoners of war who’d been used as test subjects. Despite their deteriorated state, they were still intelligent and unimaginably vicious. 

After locking us in with them, we tried to access the radio and door controls. We were able to get our location out, but have no idea if help is coming. We weren’t able to get the door working as a shin bone had been jammed into the lever controls and Bronson was attacked before Sikes could get all of it out. Bronson was killed in the attack and I managed to kill the creature as a result. 

When we got back to the lab, we discovered Ketterman had also disappeared. With no other options, we hunkered down for a few days until our food ran out. Keys, Larson, and I headed into the canteen to get food where we were ambushed by more creatures. They were able to kill Larson. As soon as we killed the last one, we heard screams from the lab where we discovered Sheaf was dead, Connors battered but alive, and Sikes had been taken by a deranged and mutated Ketterman. 

We’ve decided to go after Sikes and hunt the other bastards down or die trying.

************

Stepping into the nest was like stepping into the throat of a giant, dormant monster. The air was hot with meat-tainted breath. I turned my light through the engulfing gloom of the cavern. I couldn’t see anything move, but skittering sounds echoed off the walls. 

We kept ourselves tightly packed near the center of the cave. Behind us, the grate glowed like a doorway to another dimension. It shrank with each step we took. 

“Sikes?” Connors whispered over the metal of his rifle. 

Keys nudged him and shook her head. I understood what she was thinking. We needed to find her silently. 

Moving as one, we crept toward the rear of a cavern easily the size of the one at the front of the facility. My light revealed strange structures tucked up against the walls. We drew closer and my throat filled with bile. 

They were small lean-tos: simple shelters normally made from stretched canvas and wooden supports. But these huts had been bound with bone gut for the supports and flayed human skin for the canvas. All different shades, crusted with blood, sliced and broken in some places. 

I was almost grateful when I heard Sikes moan from somewhere deeper in the cavern. Beside me, I could feel Connors tensing, ready to run for her but I caught him this time. 

“Ketterman,” I mouthed silently. We already knew he could vocalize human sounds. What was to stop him from mimicking Sikes’ groaning to bait us into a trap?

“Forward together,” Keys whispered. 

It was a good plan. We covered our angles well and our lights gave us at least twenty feet of visibility. 

Then Ketterman started taunting us. 

“Yoooooou let me take her, Cooonnnnoooors,” he sang. Well, “sang” wasn’t exactly the right word. It was more of a hiss punctuated by wet giggles. Like someone fighting for air. “She begged and screamed. Maybe I should just slice her open nooooooooow.” 

Sikes gave a choking gasp of pain. 

I gripped Connors’ arm iron tight. We couldn’t lose him right now. 

“I’m gonna kill him…” Connors growled through his teeth. 
“Keeeeeeeeeeeys.” Ketterman’s voice pierced my ears again. “So many dead. Sikes will be soon. You failed. Faaaaaaaailed.” 

Like Connors, Keys stiffened but held strong. We could hear Sikes’ labored breathing from somewhere beyond our lights. The cavern grew narrower toward the rear. For a flicker of a moment, I thought I detected something moving in the shadows. 

My name rasped out of Ketterman’s throat. “Larson fixed you,” he sang. “Heeeeeealed you. And you let him die in the dark. Cut open like a piiiiiiiiiig.” 

It was my turn to tremble. Ketterman’s words cut me to the bone. Something about his voice dredged up my worst memories. My guiltiest fears. I wanted to rush at him through the darkness and bash his brains in. A hand slithered under my arm and squeezed my bicep. 

Connors held my gaze and nodded toward the darkest part of the cavern. I squinted. Someone was there. A tall, gangly figure standing over another kneeling one. 

Sikes screamed. 

Connors rushed at him. Keys and I followed, not even bothering to shout. 

We came upon a horrific scene. Ketterman stood in front of another skin-hut with Sikes’ skull clasped in his inhumanly long claws. His fingertips burrowed into her temple and lines of blood leaked down the side of her face like melting candle wax. His tallowed flesh looked almost transparent; rotting organs pressed against the sides of his abdomen, oozing blackened blood as they struggled to function. Sores the size of my hand crusted his face, neck, chest, and torso. Malice burned in his lidless eyes which were pointed straight at Keys. His lips peeled back in a cruel smile as he sank his claws deeper into Sikes’ skull. 

She cried out again. 

Connors lifted his gun, but Keys stopped him. On either side of Ketterman lurked more creatures. They tilted their heads as they tried to pinpoint where we stood. 

“Ahhhh, Keys,” Ketterman rasped. “The one responsible for my personal hell. Do you know what these things did to me when they took me from the lab?” He slid his long fingers around the neat bullet hole in his forehead. Then he pushed inside it, withdrew a sliver of brain matter pulped with maggots, and ate it. Sikes looked glassy-eyed as she hung from his grasping hand. “They cut me open,” he hissed. “Packed my innards with the organs of my colleagues.” He trailed a finger down the side of his face. “Then they sprayed me with that infernal fucking gas. I cannot tell you how incredible the pain was. My body felt like it was liquifying in acid, slowly eating away but never dissolving. Burning for eternity.” He spat tar-colored bile on the ground. 

Keys tilted her head ever so slightly. “It’s no more than you deserve,” she said, “you fucking monster.” 

Ketterman bared his disgusting teeth. “Very well.”

He lifted his hand up to slice Sikes open, but Connors charged at him. 

One of the creatures leaped on him, sinking its teeth into the nape of his neck and tearing out a bloody chunk of flesh. Connors collapsed, Keys and I yelled, and Ketterman laughed up to the moment Sikes rammed a sharpened femur into his ragged groin. 

Hell unleashed itself. 

Sheaf’s words came back to me as two creatures launched themselves my way. Relax, breathe, squeeze, fire. I did so, but I kept squeezing and the bullets exploded out at an incredible rate, ripping through both monsters. They screamed and collapsed on the ground next to a gaping Connors whose neck gurgled blood down his shoulder and face. He still didn’t hesitate in taking out his knife and stabbing the creature closest to him over and over. 

Keys was half a moment slower than me getting her weapon up. She dumped half her magazine into the third monster, but got taken out by the fourth. The two of them rolled away with her knife flashing as it drove into the thing’s scabby back and its teeth gnashing at her chest and shoulders. 

Sikes had managed to roll away from Ketterman whose seething, strangled outline collapsed against the wall, fingers scrambling at the bone shard between his legs. I took a step towards him when fire lanced my calf. The creature Connors hadn’t stabbed sank its teeth into my leg, opening up flesh and muscle. Roaring in pain, I tried crushing its head with a well-aimed stomp, but it lashed out and knocked me off balance, pulling me to the floor and wrapping its hands around my hips to drag itself toward my neck. I thrashed for all I was worth. The grip these creatures possessed was otherworldly. It crushed my thighs between its arms as I scrambled for my knife but found it had gone flying toward Sikes in the melee. 

The creature dragged itself closer, those claws digging like molten pincers into my ribs. Saliva flecked its jagged teeth and a wave of nauseatingly hot breath washed over me. Out of sheer desperation, I made a fist and rammed it down the creature’s throat. Decaying flesh engulfed my knuckles and wrist up to the elbow and the creature choked. Squeezing my eyes closed, I twisted my arm and wrenched upwards, ripping the monster’s head away from its neck in a gout of blackened blood. 

Free once more, I rolled to my knees and immediately vomited.

Nearby, Keys continued wrestling with her humanoid, though it was now bleeding from multiple mortal wounds.

Across from me, Ketterman finally wrenched the bone free and turned toward Sikes who was crawling toward my knife. He stalked after her, the bone shard gripped in his long claws. He raised it above his head when something slammed into him from the side. 

Connors had somehow lumbered to his feet and tackled the ex-scientist into the skin hut. The structure collapsed under them as my best friend started bashing Ketterman’s face in with his bare fists. 

“Fuck you!” he yelled. “Fuck you and this whole goddamned fucking nightmare!” 

Ketterman didn’t stand a chance. His body, weakened from everything it had gone through, collapsed like paper mache under Connors’ fists. His face caved in, his teeth disintegrated, and his eyes burst when the bleeding man atop him gouged his sockets. 

CRUNCH!

Connors tore the doctor’s head in two and he went still. The bloodied man swayed atop the creature before collapsing on his back.

Behind me, Keys yelled as she drove her knife deep into the point of the final humanoid’s chin. A moment later, it was silent. 

I staggered to my feet and limped over to help Sikes up. She looked battered, but not broken.

The same could not be said for Connors. 

His breathing came in ragged, watery gasps. Each one flecked the deep wound in his neck with bubbles of blood. He grinned up at me and we clasped gore-soaked hands one final time. 

Sikes knelt beside him and smiled shakily. 

“S-Safe?” he whispered. 

She nodded. 

Connors smiled, finally content. I watched as his eyes settled on the darkness above where they became unfocused. He was gone.

Keys watched respectfully. She cradled her injured arm and winced when she helped Sikes to her feet. Both of them pulled me up and the three of us surveyed the carnage. 

We were alive. Wounded to various degrees, but alive. 

We spent the next hour constructing a litter for Connors to drag his body out of that place. If there was one thing we could do for him, it was that. 

I almost cried when we dragged ourselves back to the hole. The light shining through it felt almost blinding and the fresh air never tasted sweeter. 

It took a long time to get Connors back up to the main center. Our wounds slowed us down considerably. The bite in my leg had bled quite a bit before Keys wrapped it up in a tight bandage. I was worried about potential infection, but that would have to wait. 

Presently, we made sure to bring everyone out into the cavern where they could be laid to rest side by side. We owed them that much. 

As we worked, another worry ate at us. Would help be coming?

Keys checked the radio again but found it smashed to bits. Most likely Ketterman’s work while we were holed up in the lab. She shrugged and looked at Sikes and me. 

“It’s out of our hands now.” 

So we waited. We treated one another’s wounds as best we could. Keys had to cut away a considerable amount of loose flesh from my calf and clean it out. The ligaments in her right shoulder were permanently injured and we had to set it after discovering it had been dislocated. Sikes experienced trouble with blurry vision in her right eye from where Ketterman cut her with a claw. She also had nerve damage in her right hand from where the bone shard cut into some tendons. We also displayed plenty of minor cuts and bruises that we fixed up with our dwindling supplies.

All in all, we were a sorry bunch of bastards. Bloodied, broken, fear shifting around in our guts like broken glass. But there was nothing left to do now. 

I ate cans of cold soup, slept on a stained cot, and made small talk with Keys and Sikes when they were in the mood. 

The bodies of our comrades lay cold under sheets in a neat row near the doors. If rescue did come, we wanted them to be the first ones to enjoy it. 

Time became shapeless in that cavern. 

Then, one day (or night for all I knew), I awoke to a faint rumbling. I staggered out of my cot, finding Sikes and Keys already on their feet, looking equally confused. 

We stared at the doors as they began to vibrate and grind inward. We eyed one another breathlessly. 

Rust shivered off the cold metal doors, lab equipment trembled around us, and rays of winter light spilled over my face.
