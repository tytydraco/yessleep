  This originally happened a few years ago when I was 13. I've always had insomnia but slowly it got worse. Every night I would wake up and couldnt go to sleep but one night I couldn't move. I was frozen, eyes forced open as if my body wasn't mine anymore. I looked around my room and suddenly I saw it. A creature easily 8 feet tall.

  It was pitch black, skin like a void, it's outline was blurry. It's eyes were the worst. Two white dots just staring at me, unmoving and never blinking. It stood outside my door frame at first and all I could do was watch in fear for what felt like days. It had a smile. Like his face was torn through with a dull knife. I cried in fear as it just stood there watching when I suddenly passed out.

  The next night wasn't better by any means. I awoke frozen again, too scared to look at my door but I regretted it the second I did. It was closer. It was inside now. Just like the night before it stared at my the entire time, adrenaline running through my veins yet still unable to move a muscle. 

  Every night carried on like this, the demon getting closer. One night I thought I was safe, I didn't see it standing anywhere. But it wasn't standing. It hung upside-down from the ceiling like a spider, it's arms and legs bet in horrid ways and it's neck twisted so it can still face me. This night I was able to close my eyes but at thus point I was too scared to. What if it moved when I close my eyes? What happens then? 

  The final night. I felt myself wake up but refused to open my eyes. I was terrified of what I would see. I couldn't prepare myself for what I would see though. I slowly opened my eyes only to start having a panic attack. It stood by me. Right next to the bed. I could see it up close and I wish I never opened my eyes. It was so thin I could see it's bones but the skin looked like leather. Black ooze spilled out of its mouth, smiling down at me. I fought harder that night then I have ever before. I slowly gained control. First a finger, then a foot, then an arm. Once I was in control I hid under my blankets, praying for it to leave me alone. Next thing I remember I was waking up to my alarm.

  Every night since then it has stayed away. Maybe because I now had control. I've wondered for years since then what would have happened to me if I didn't force myself to move. If I had just waited one more night. But now I always have a knife by my bed. While I've never seen it fully again like the nights I woke up I still spot it in the corner of my eye. My only hope is this never happens to my daughter. But for now hes still here. Always smiling and watching.
