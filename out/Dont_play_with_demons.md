I've always had an interest in the occult but never really felt the need to partake in it. Even while consuming all of the media I possibly could I never really wanted to try anything myself but one thing always stuck out to me. It was always the demonic stuff that I liked the most, more than ghosts or any of the other supernatural stuff that you find associated with the occult. 

Well I finally decided to join a Facebook group for it and for the last six months I've found some new friends and even developed a close relationship with a particular individual who I'll just call E. E was super into this stuff even more than I was and while hanging out with them dove deeper into it, more than I would ever do on my own. Every single time we hung out demonic stuff was brought up and they recently gave me their favorite book, the book of black magic and of pacts. 

E was more than happy to share all the knowledge they had about this kind of stuff with me but it got a little out of hand and about a week ago or so I finally agreed to do a ritual with them. I'm not sure if  it's more because I'm a people pleaser and really wanted my friendship with them to continue or because I was admittedly a little more curious than I should have been. I'm not religious and I was very skeptical that something like this would work. I think in my mind it was all childs play. Things like this only happen if you believe in them right? If you don't believe in the existence of a god then you can't truly believe that these things exist and you can just summon them out of nowhere. 

I wont go into detail about what happened that night because I truly don't want any of you to have to experience what I've been going through, but I will say that during this ritual E started to act very very strange. Not like their normal self at all, they were growling and thrashing around pretty violently. I can honestly say that I thought they were just playing with me at first to add to the experience but as our night continued things started to get worse. Their behavior turned violent and they began hurting themselves. Their body contorted and twisted in ways I don't think are possible, it sounded like bones breaking and ligaments tearing. The sounds coming from them were unlike anything I've ever heard in my life. Even if they were just messing with me I think exerting that kind of energy even for a bit would be pretty exhausting and should've ended long before it did. It wasn't until I blew out some candles and turned on the lights that it finally stopped. 

E was more than angry at me for stopping what had occurred but I felt that it was necessary especially because by the end E was bleeding. After yelling at me and scolding me they grabbed their stuff and left. I don't know what happened but, I've tried multiple times to reach out and received nothing. I had just assumed they were still pissed at me but their Facebook activity also stopped. None of our other friends have heard from them either. 

For the past three days now I've had a feeling that something stayed with me that night, something dark, something evil and my suspicion was proved correct when last night I woke to something standing by the side of my bed. It was tall and very skinny, I couldn't make out any details of it but I know for a fact that it was watching me, just standing there watching me sleep. I'm not sure what it's intentions are but I know that whatever they are they aren't good. I don't know that to do, I don't know how to get rid of it and I'm very scared. I've never done this before and I can't tell you what to do but I will just say, don't play with demons.
