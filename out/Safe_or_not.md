"I wouldn't go in there if I were you." my friend, Kate told me as I approached the woods.

"Why? It's not like there's anything lurking." I turned back to face her, chuckling a bit before stopping. 

"There's a legend regarding this specific woods. Multiple people died from it, did you forget?" She asked me, she glared at me and I stuck out my tongue and ran inside, despite her protests. 

"Whatever, catch me if you can!" I ran inside, laughing and closing my eyes before crashing into one of the trees. I moaned as I was bleeding. I looked around to see if Kate was with me. Everywhere was filled with trees. "Shit." I got up and grabbed my phone to look for service. Nothing. I ran straight since I didn't turn and twist when I was running. It felt like hours before still being lost. I looked at me and Kate's text to find out if there was anything regarding that pathetic legend she was talking about. As I was scrolling I found a long piece of text, it told the story of how the trees move constantly so that there would be no actual exit. Monsters that cannot be explained exist. I gulped. I turned off my phone and pocketed it. 

"KATEEEE?!" I yelled, hoping for a response. I ran in different directions, waiting for an exit to appear magically. All that seemed to be was trees and more trees than I could ever imagine. The sky was getting dark, and my backpack had limited supplies. my stomach growled, so I got some snacks that I had packed. We were initially going on a hike, but we got sidetracked when I wanted to catch a Pokemon near the woods. *Not so proud of that now* I thought to myself. I heard a croak behind me, and my hair stood on its edges. I slowly turned around and saw a significant figure standing probably 20 meters away from me? I wasn't going to count. 

I strolled, fearing for that thing to start running at me. It didn't, it just croaked. *Weird.* I looked around trying to keep it in my range, but I noticed more of this figure everywhere, ranging from different sizes to colors. I panicked and started running. "Please, Kate. Please save me." My eyes began to tear up, my vision was getting blurry, and I kept seeing long things around me. It was as if they were circling around me.

*Ding!* My phone has service! I quickly took out my phone and stopped running. I started to search for "long figures spotted in the woods" and saw that these things are not hostile, and circle around people to protect themselves. How did people die from this exact wood then? I tried contacting 911, but there was a voice as soon as it went through.

*We're sorry, but the subscriber you tried to reach is busy. Please try again later.* 

"Fuck." No service once again, but those things looked like they were getting closer in now. I looked through my backpack and found a pistol, some snacks, water, a towel, and a lighter. I drank some water, before hearing a large unison croak. They started to walk towards me, and I grabbed my pistol and aimed it at one of them. I looked around, trying to find a way to get around them as soon as possible. I ran under the biggest one but was caught by its large hand. I eyed it carefully, scared to make any movement. It seemed as if it was inspecting me. It let out a different sound this time.

&#x200B;

*Weuurhhhooooo...*

*The others replied,*

*Oooohuuuureeee...*

It started to put me down before all the others quickly went towards me. All of them grabbed me at once and stretched my limbs. "Wait, wait, no! I am not made to be eaten." I yelled, squirming and kicking its large fingers. I started to feel the excruciating pain it was giving me. I cried and moaned loudly at the feeling. My limbs seemed to fail and my heart was beating at an intense speed. One of them pulled at my right arm and it detached. I let out a scream before the others pulled at the same time...my  bag, and my phone dropped on the floor, and I could hear something before all became dark. 

*Ding!*
