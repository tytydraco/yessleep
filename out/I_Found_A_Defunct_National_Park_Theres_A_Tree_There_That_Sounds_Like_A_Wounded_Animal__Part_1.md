Part 1



As it turns out, there are actually multiple defunct national parks in the US. You won’t find their names or locations on the surface of the internet, or in virtually any tangible archives available to the public. I just happened to be in the right place, and at the right time, to find one for myself.



My parents inherited a few acres of land in central Kentucky when my grandmother passed. Apparently, it’s been in the family for some six or so generations. I can vaguely remember going there as a small kid. I remembered the basic landscape: uneven, filled with deep, narrow valleys and rocky outcroppings everywhere. And in the center of the property was a hill where was a small, almost rotting cabin where my grandparents lived. In fact, the one time we went up there when I was a kid was to help replace some of the beams and add on to the back for extra space. My grandparents were always protective of that house, so it took several years to convince them to have the repairs done. I wouldn’t be surprised if it hadn’t seen any kind of serious maintenance in 90 years or so. 



Now, as a grown adult, I get that familiar feeling that I get when visiting other places from my childhood. Everything felt so much bigger back then, and now the cabin looks so much smaller: a plain, rectangular building made from cross-linked timber and caulked with concrete, no larger than the living room in my own house. 



That day, I went there to help my parents extract the old family records, which my grandmother insisted on keeping in the loft of the cabin, despite the threat of humidity damage. The loft was one place that my grandparents, understandably, forbade me from going. As I stood there, I remembered that janky ladder made from tree limbs leading through a trapdoor and up to the storage space above. Of course, the first thing we did was replace the ladder with one we brought with us from the nearest hardware store. 



Then, climbing up to the loft, we found at least ten plastic tubs containing all manner of documents, photos, and memorabilia from the past hundred years or so. Most of these were fairly mundane. The first artifact I picked up was a tax document from 1940, then a coin labeled 1927. But one thing in particular caught my eye in the midst of the piles of history.



 It was a small black-and-white photograph, smaller than the palm of my hand. The image featured a white wooden sign driven into the ground by two large timber beams, with two older vehicles surrounding a shed in the background, with a line of trees behind that. 



The sign was painted with bold black letters: 



Crying Tree National Park



I had never heard of this national park before, but the landscape was unmistakable: a meadow clearing in the midst of dense forest, the kind that you find every now and again out in the woods of central Kentucky. After staring at the image, analyzing every detail for a solid minute or two, I flipped the image over, revealing a label written in faded pencil:



Gray Road Entrance to Crying Tree - May 1, 1925



I slipped the photograph into my coat pocket to investigate later. I spent the next hour or so sorting through more mundane legal documents and trinkets, the meaning and sentiment of which have long been forgotten. At the bottom of my second box, there was an old, weathered folding map. The front of the flyer displayed the familiar title: 



Crying Tree National Park Map



At the bottom, there was a copyright indicator telling me that the map came from the same year: 1925. Upon unfolding the map, I found a familiar road map on the far left, showing Elizabethtown, KY to the west, with streets running north and south of the park, Colesburg Road to the north, and Gray Road to the south. To the right of the road map was a magnified version, showing individual landmarks and trails throughout the park. The area was fairly small, at least by comparison to nearby national parks like Mammoth Cave. 



There was an information building and a parking lot, leading to three different trails. One of these led from the parking lot to the center of the park, where there was a single point labeled ‘The Crying Tree’. After examining the other extraneous details of the map, I flipped to the back, where there was a short script explaining the significance of the tree:



*The Crying Tree of Kentucky has stood as a wonder of nature* 

*among the hills and hollers of this beautiful state since time* 

*immemorial. It was discovered by brothers Oliver and Gregory*

*Hasting all the way back in 1830 when hunting on the vast* 

*landscape surrounding their cabin home. They supposedly* 

*mistook it for the screeching of a wounded elk, only to find* 

*themselves at the base of this magnificent organism. It*

*remains a mystery as to the purpose of the tree’s cry, or*

*exactly how long it’s been there. It’s speculated, though,*

*that the tree is related to the native Shawnee tribe’s* 

*long-standing tradition of restless tree-spirits.*



Gregory Hasting…that was a name I remembered. It was my grandmother’s great-great-grandfather. She spoke about him quite a bit actually, like a family patriarch, but she never said a word about the tree or the park or anything like that. And not to mention, something this…strange…how could I have never heard of it before? I mean, I’m a pretty avid hiker, and I love going to National Parks, even several times a year, but this…this was entirely new to me.



That night, I opened the map on my laptop and searched for ‘Crying Tree National Park’. When it loaded…there was nothing. I looked at the area specified on the flyer, and there was nothing there but open forest with small roads winding through. I tried googling the name…I just got redirected to Joshua Tree National Park out in California. I tried every combination of relevant terms that came to mind, ‘Crying Tree’, ‘Kentucky Crying Tree’, ‘Tree that makes crying noise’...nothing. I searched every nature-lover forum imaginable, asking if anyone had heard of this place. Most people who responded had never heard of such a place, even suggesting that I had fallen victim to some kind of elaborate and niche prank. 



But there was one person…a user called Harbinger237 on a small forum that will remain anonymous to respect their privacy. This user was the first to reply to my query on this particular forum. 



He simply stated, “Probably a defunct np, there’s actually several places like that.” 



Indeed, I knew there were some areas that were once national parks, but were later revoked. But a place like this, that seemingly never existed, was still definitely a first. I shared that thought with Harbinger, who promptly responded with, 



“This is a different category. These weren’t just revoked from np status, they were deliberately buried. Forgotten. Whatever records you found, they’re likely the only ones still in existence.”



Skeptical, I retorted with, “Okay? How would you know about them, then?” 



Harbinger responded, “Forums like this one. You’re not the first to find evidence of these kinds of parks. At the current time, I’ve collected sufficient evidence for 14 such places, now including yours.” 



I probed further, “Can you give any examples of such a place?’



Harbinger replied, “There’s a reason these places were buried.”



At that, a sharp chill ran up my back and shoulders in spite of my skepticism. Frustrated, I ended that chain of replies and closed my laptop for the night. As I laid in bed that night, I stayed up just thinking about the whole thing. Honestly, I thought Harbinger’s idea was ridiculous. Just some wacko conspiracy theorist who had one too many joints that fine evening. That aside, in the pit of my stomach, in the very core of my being, I knew something was very, very wrong. Just my possession of the artifacts truly felt like eating of the forbidden fruit, or something along those lines. 



I knew in my very bones that I ought to have ended my search then and there…but I didn’t. The way I saw it, this place, this tree, was practically my family’s forgotten legacy. To leave it alone, in my mind, would have been a disservice to those who came before me. How wrong I was. I should have heard my ancestors, practically screaming from their graves to forget it, but I didn’t. I made up my mind to go to the location on the folding map the very next day.



Early the next morning, I made the half-hour drive to the side of Gray Road, almost exactly where the road to the south entrance should have been. The whole area was overgrown with trees and shrubs, thick even in winter, and no sign of a path anywhere. Grabbing my pack of standard hiking gear, I locked my car and trudged into the dense treeline. Honestly, I didn’t care if it was private property or not at the time. I guess I was too blinded by curiosity to think too deeply about that. In any case, it was close enough to the family land that I could plausibly claim that I got lost, at least that’s what I told myself. 



For the next three hours, I hiked north, in and out of canyons and across shallow ridgelines. It was probably only a mile-and-a-half hike in reality, but the incline made it feel like ten. As I approached the area where the park entrance should have been, I found a familiar clearing…the one from the photo. But like with the not-road where I parked my car, there was absolutely no sign that the area had even so much been touched by mankind. 



For this very purpose, I brought a pocket metal detector and a trowel, hoping to find some remnant of the former settlement. I covered what I believed to be the general locations of the old sign and the shed, and got not a single hit. Over the ensuing hours, I searched nearly the entire clearing and found, again, absolutely nothing. I had expected to find something, even if modern, like a shotgun shell, an empty can…something. But there was still no sign that this area had ever been developed. 



It almost felt like hallowed ground, a place which could not, would not, see corruption by our species within its premises. As such, I felt like a stranger there, an intruder in a holy place. I wanted to run, and as I was about to turn back to make the trip toward my car, that’s when I saw it. Off in the tree line to the north, there was a game trail. Obviously not made by humans, but still well-used and clearly leading to somewhere important to the woodland creatures who made it. 



That’s when I made the single worst decision in my life…I followed the trail back into the woods. The actual trail itself was maybe a few inches wide and clearly made by deer having trotted through there for many generations. 



It seemed to go on for miles along this relatively flat woodland plane, until about halfway through my trip when I found the first sign of any human development since the day began. If I had blinked a second too late, I’d have probably missed it. It was a simple wooden post with a small metal placard with the logo of the National Park Service printed on it, as well as the words ‘Land Boundary’. I felt my stomach drop. This place was real? And what’s more, the sign looked brand new. 



Hands shaking, I took a picture of the post and continued on. Past the sign, the land visibly began to dip. Subtly at first, but then becoming a deep hole in the ground about half a mile in. At this point, I was effectively climbing down the cliffs in a spiral motion around the hole, and it got warmer. I still don’t fully know why, but it felt like a nice spring day down in the hole. 



My nerves started to ease as I approached the solid ground beneath me, but I was still terrified by looking up above me and seeing the sheer height I had climbed down from without any gear and without having told anyone where I was. In all probability, if I had been injured there, nobody would have found me in time



Inexplicably, the game trail continued from its ending a few hundred feet above at the bottom of the sinkhole. Now I could clearly see another sign of human activity: a six-foot tall wooden fence, painted black. The game trail ended at the edge of the fence, and circled around its circumference, which appeared more well trod than the rest of the game trail, like animals had been just circling around the fence over and over for days on end.



And, upon closer inspection, there were. Thousands of ants, interspersed with beetles, wasps, and even a lizard or two making their twisted, symbiotic death march around the fence. And the smell hit me all at once. It smelled like goats, like a barn with farm animals, and it only became stronger as I climbed over the wooden fence and trudged forward. As soon as I landed on the other side of the veil, my head immediately began pounding, like I was suddenly plunged to the crushing pressures of the deep ocean. Looking up, I saw it at long last…the Crying Tree. 



It was still fairly small, but there was no way I could be mistaken about it. It was by far the strangest organism I had ever laid my eyes on. Its bark looked like large fingernails, giving it an unnaturally smooth, plated exterior. It was clear to me that the smell was coming from whatever viscous sap was oozing from underneath the bark-plates. I covered my mouth and nose with my coat to keep my stomach steady enough to investigate further. 



It branched off toward the top like a tree, but in the wrong ways. Its branches twisted at unnaturally sharp angles, almost like a monkey’s limbs. But what really stood out to me is how it twitched. 



Subtly, almost imperceivably, the limbs twitched against the direction of the wind, like an octopus getting electrocuted. I stood mesmerized, trying to make sense of what I was seeing when I realized something: it wasn’t making any sounds whatsoever. Even the movements it made, it moved without so much as a crunch. 



It was like it was trying to become a tree, but got confused and became this grotesque, branching obelisk. At that moment, I felt something I had never felt before in the depths of my heart. It was like a homogenized blend of nostalgia, inspiration, awe…perhaps infatuation? The thought went through my mind: this is it. This is my family legacy, it’s like the tree and I were fated to meet long before my birth.



Without even thinking about it, I stepped forward, toward the tree. Then another…and another. I don’t think I blinked for the entire time I was walking, and started involuntarily grinning as I approached. Before I knew it, I was mere inches from the tree, all my senses numbed by its presence. 



All at once, I placed my right palm on the sticky-smooth surface of the tree, and it tensed up like a cat’s skin when it doesn’t want to be pet. And, immediately, the tree let out the most blood-chilling scream I had heard in my entire life. Indeed, it was like an elk or caribou call, but its tone shifted and modulated up and down, like it was trying to speak, but using an elk’s voice. It repeated the same warbled pattern over and over:



“Waaaooouukh…Nēaoaaaah…Waaaooouukh…Nēaoaaaah”



I stood there in my trance until well after the sun went down, then I collapsed, feeling a surge of…electricity, possibly?  I became unconscious, and with time tuned out the wailing of the tree so I could hear my own thoughts. What insanity would lead someone…anyone…to bring this thing to public attention, much less make a national park out of it? It wasn’t a wonder of nature, it was an abomination, an amalgamation of countless traits of hundreds of creatures…a mockery. That’s what it was. 



Like a twisted divinity, standing in the midst of God’s good, green Earth…and laughing at Him. How could anyone stand to share the same land–no–the same *planet* as this thing? In my insanity, I wanted it all to end. Right then…right there. I begged a God who was ever silent to my pleas to take me away from this thing…this world…just so I didn’t have to spend another moment with that unholy being. 



And in a moment…I was back in my car on the side of Gray Road. I didn’t remember the trip back, but the aches in my muscles told me enough about that part of things. I wondered for a moment if I had hallucinated, but in the deepest core of my being, something had broken, irreparably, and that was enough for me to know that what I went through was very, very real.



For the rest of my life, I would hear the tree’s crying playing in the back of my mind. But not like a memory…more like a telegraph, like it was continuing to attempt to torment me, consciously. All the way back to my home in Elizabethtown: 



“Waaaooouukh…Nēaoaaaah…Waaaooouukh…Nēaoaaaah” 



As I drove, I began to know things. Not like visions, or voices, but deeper than that. Thoughts, ideas, memories that became evident to me through means I could not even begin to understand. 



The wailings I continued to hear, they caused me to remember something from the deepest annals of time. Someone had tried to teach that thing to speak. When this land was young, when the Shawnee lived here, someone taught it those two accursed words, if they *are* words.



Small bits of information like this entered my mind on a regular basis throughout the drive home. The realizations hit me such that I nearly wrecked at least five times on that drive alone. After an eternity in my mind, I arrived back at my house, remembering little from the drive itself. And upon entering my room my mind went calm. It had probably been at least twelve hours since I had that level of calm in my head. I just laid there in my bed until late in the afternoon out of the physical and mental exhaustion of the previous day. Throughout that time, the words in the back of my head softened, but never stopped, like waves against the seashore, each time bringing with them new meaning that I could only begin to know how to process. 



But in the midst of the noise, I managed to find one thought of my own to bring me back down to reality: Harbinger. Of course, there’s no way they *wouldn’t* know *something* about what was going on. So, still feeble and shaking, I opened my laptop on the other side of my dark bedroom. 



The forum page was still open, but upon scrolling through the page, yesterday’s thread was gone. No ‘this thread has been deleted’ notification…nothing. It was just gone. I scrolled through the forum for hours, thread after thread, looking for any sign of the user Harbinger237. Under a random thread about aquatic fungi, I found the user. It was a single comment, agreeing with another user about some piece of niche information about a fungal species. I clicked on his nametag and sent him a private message. 



I typed away, frantically, but with caution, “Harbinger237, this is the guest user from yesterday, the one asking about Crying Tree National Park. I went to the location on the map. Tell me what you know about the tree, or whatever that thing is. I trust you know what I’m talking about.”



They responded within a few minutes, “I guess that makes idiots of the both of us. So can you see the Titan now? I trust you know what I’m talking about.”



“The Titan?” I responded



“Is it night where you are?” Harbinger asked



“Yeah, why?”



“Look out your window. To the west.”



I just sat there stunned, trying to understand what I was reading. I thought there couldn’t be any harm in following his instructions. Nobody could see me, anyway. Cautiously, I went to the window in my room, which faced roughly northwest. I stood there stalling in front of the window, the parts of the brain that were still my own screaming at me to keep the shutters closed. To forget everything, but I knew I had long passed the point of no return, and had to follow this road to the end. That was the only way forward I could see that involved me staying alive. 



Grabbing the painted wooden lever, and pulling it down, I gazed out into the distance, and saw exactly what he was talking about. There was a silhouette off in the distance, one so massive that it covered most of my view of the sky, the lower half of it’s torso falling behind the curvature of the Earth. It was dimly lit by the light of the set sun, like the moon, but no one else below seemed to notice it. It had a thin frame with no discernible details, save two dots, or perhaps singularities, or something like that–I don’t know—on its head that I assumed were its eyes. 



And it was staring at me.



Now that I was aware of it, even when I turned away from it in disbelief, I could still feel its gaze. Through walls, through space and time, it seemed that nothing could separate me from its long, dispassionate gaze. It felt like ice piercing my body constantly. That’s how I knew it was watching me. 



In morbid curiosity, I took a double take, and this time stared at it for as long as I could bear it. Still, I could discern no details, but behind it…as I allowed my eyes to adjust, I saw that behind the one most prominent, there were hundreds, thousands, uncountable hosts of them stretching out into the distance and filling the endless void. 



And the stars were gone…and also the planets and the moon with them. I couldn’t understand what I was seeing, but I thought I knew at least that, somehow, the cosmos was gone, replaced by this divine assembly of unknowable giants that only I and Harbinger, apparently, could see.



And something else broke inside of me. I always loved space, but all in a moment, my fundamental understanding of what that even is was broken. In desperation, I ran back to the laptop, trying to shut what I had seen out of my mind, and typed to Harbinger:



“What are those things? What do they have to do with the tree? What’s going on? Is this some kind of alternate universe? I’m losing my mind! Please, just tell me!”



He responded, vague as ever, “They call themselves the Powers, actually. If you listen closely, they will tell you what you need to know. But I can at least assure you of this: you’re in the same universe you’ve always been in. You and I just see on different spectrums than the rest.”



At this point, I knew I’d had enough. I knew if I took one more step down this road, my mind would break, and there’s no way that kind of life would be worth living. I closed my tabs and performed a hard reboot on my laptop in an effort to remove any trace of information about the Crying Tree. And it worked. I went to bed at around 2:00 AM and tried to live my life normally from that point forward. 



I just took it one day at a time. I went to my job as a software developer the next day. It was actually the first time I had been in-person at the office in several months. I knew that this kind of human interaction would be important if I was to forget about the events of the past three days. The following week, I met up with a psychiatrist and tried explaining my symptoms in a way that made it sound like I had Schizophrenia, and it worked. The doctor prescribed me Olanzapine, which admittedly did help a bit with the tree’s voice in the back of my head, and with the help of the medication, I learned to tune it out entirely with time. As for the Powers, I just triple-covered my windows with blinds and blankets and I never went out at night. Yeah, I’ve had to make some pretty dumb excuses on that front.



Although I tried to forget, there was no way I could manage that level of recovery, I could only learn to cope with my strange new reality. And I had some time to think about the park, and ask myself why something like that could have happened. I’m not going to pretend that I have an answer for that. But I do completely understand now why it was buried and forgotten. It has nothing to do with government cover ups or conspiracy theories or the like. It’s simply a human response to the unnatural. No human being could possibly come into contact with that thing and bear to remember it. 



For a whole year I lived my normal, mundane life, and even found a girlfriend, Karah. My world became more beautiful after the incident, so maybe, in some messed up way, my encounter with the Crying Tree was for the better. Perhaps it was the thing that pushed me to get back into society and truly live life. 



At least, that’s what I thought…until the tree suddenly spoke in breathy, monotonous English, only once:



“Come back to the window. We miss you.”
