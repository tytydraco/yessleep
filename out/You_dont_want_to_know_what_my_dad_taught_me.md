I was seven the first time my father took me into the woods at night.

I didn’t think it was strange then. He said we were walking because walking was how men spoke to God when words failed.

He carried a lantern with a blue wick that burned low and steady, and he told me not to look behind us no matter what I heard. 

I remember the cold more than anything else—the way it pressed through my coat and into my bones, as if the forest had decided I was something it could keep.

The church sat in a clearing that didn’t belong there. White stone, too clean for its age, with narrow windows sealed shut. 

My father told me it had been built to sanctify what came before it. Years later I would understand that sanctification can also mean containment.

Inside, the floor was stone, worn smooth except for the mark at the center. Two triangles, interlocked. Six corners. 

The Six-Cornered Covenant, my father called it, as if naming it made it obedient. I believed him. I believed everything he said then. I believed because belief was safer than asking.

The lamb was small. Too small. He cradled it the way other fathers held babies, murmuring prayers I didn’t recognize. He handed it to me and told me to feel its heart. It was racing. He said that was good. Fear made the offering lighter.

I didn’t cut it. He never let me cut anything. He said it was mercy. I held the bowl. 

I watched the blade open the lamb’s throat, watched and heard as the tendons and muscles tore as blood spilled into the grooves of the covenant.

The lamb screamed as he’d wrap his arms around it’s stomach and held it upside down. It would plead as it kicked its last embers of life away.

No remorse.

The stone drank eagerly. 

When the blood reached the last corner, the lamb’s head burst—not violently, not like an explosion, but as if pressure had finally been released. 

Its eyes bursted out of its socket with impressive force, the eyes splatting against the stone base of the front pews. 

Its neck swelled and expanded before whatever pressure was building behind it finally gave way. Its head ripped from its body with a terrible sound. 

Fur ripped and muscles were stretched far more than ever intended before tearing. As the lamb’s head came off its spine shattered and hung out of the gaping bloody hole where the head once was.

As the head finally tore free it exploded into innumerable amounts of chunks of gore and viscera. 

I screamed.

The sound echoed through the church, sharp and wrong. I scrambled backward, slipping on the slick stone, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might tear me open next.

My father sighed.

“For God’s sake,” he said. “Get up the fuck up.”

“That wasn’t supposed to happen,” I sobbed. “You said it would be ok—its head—”

“It’s always like that,” he snapped. “You just don’t remember. You never do.”

He stepped over the lamb’s body and loomed above me.

“Look at me, son,” I stared at the body of the lamb.

“Damn it son, fucking look at me.”

I didn’t want to, but my body obeyed before my mind could refuse.

“That’s what protection looks like, that’s what keeping you alive looks like. You think the men in this family die young because of this? They die because they didn’t. Because they get soft. Because they were pussies.”

“I don’t want to do it again,” I said. “Please.”

His expression hardened.

“You will do it again,” he said. “And next time, you won’t cry like a baby. You should want to. This is your responsibility.”

“I’m scared,” I whispered with the only breath I could muster.

He crouched in front of me, close enough that I could smell iron on his breath and see the hard.

“No, you’re not,” he said calmly. “You’re grateful. You just don’t know the difference yet.”

He stood and wiped the blade clean on his coat.

“We’ll come back when it’s time,” he added. “And you’ll be ready.”

He left me there with the cooling blood and the ruined lamb, the covenant dark and full beneath my feet.

That was the night I learned fear could be renamed.

And that if you hear it often enough, you start answering to the wrong name.

That night he told me I was protected.

For a long time, I thought I had grown up devout. We kept no synagogue. We spoke to no rabbi. My father said the Law had been softened by men who feared its weight. He said what we practiced was older, truer. 

I believed him because I was a child and because he was my father.

Looking back now, I understand I wasn’t raised devout.
I was raised obedient.

There were other things. Small things that only arrange themselves into a pattern once you’re old enough to name them.

Silence was holy. Questions were dangerous. Certain words were never spoken aloud; they were whispered into cloth or dirt, where they couldn’t be overheard. 

I fasted on days that meant nothing, ate when I shouldn’t have. Hunger, he said, made room.

Animals didn’t like our house. Dogs strained against their leashes. Birds avoided the yard. Any pet we kept didn’t last long. My father said they were witnesses, and witnesses were fragile.

My mother is the absence everything bends around. 

I was told she wasn’t strong enough for the covenant.

Later, much later, I learned she had tried to leave. I don’t know if the lamb was slaughtered before or after that.

The men in my family die young. Accidents. Illness. Suicide. 

One disappeared into the woods and was later found dismantled—head removed, arms taken from the elbows down, legs from the shins. He had been gutted with care. It was only afterward that they realized parts of his spine were missing too.

Each death was followed by another lamb, another night walk, another assurance that the curse had been delayed.

Delayed. Not ended. Never ending.

Then, there was the night my father buried me.

He didn’t call it that. He said we were “connecting and listening.” He said the earth remembered better when it could feel your shape.

We drove out past the tree line, farther than we usually went, to a place where the ground dipped unnaturally, as if something underneath had settled and never risen back up. 

He handed me a shovel and told me where to dig. I remember how hard the soil was, how my hands blistered even through the gloves. He didn’t help. He corrected me.

“Wider,” he said. “You need room to breathe.”

When the hole was finished, he told me to lie down inside it. I hesitated. That was enough to earn the look—the one that meant I was about to disappoint something larger than him.

“This isn’t punishment,” he said. “This is preparation.”

He placed a folded cloth over my mouth and nose, loose enough to let air through. “So you don’t waste your breath,” he explained. Then he began to shovel the dirt back in.

It was slow. Deliberate. Each scoop landed with a soft, final sound against my chest, my legs, my shoulders. I tried to keep my breathing steady the way he’d taught me. 

Panic, he said, made you louder than you were allowed to be.

Halfway through, I started crying. The dirt muffled the sound.

“Stop that bullshit nonsense,” he said from above me. “You’re not trapped. You’re being held.”

When the soil reached my chin, he crouched down so I could see him.

“You feel that pressure?” he asked. “That’s the covenant noticing you. Most people go their whole lives without ever being noticed.”

“I can’t move.”

“I know, isn’t  it wonderful?”

He finished burying me and laid a wooden board across the top of the hole. Not sealed. Just heavy. Enough to remind me where I was.

I don’t know how long I stayed there. Definitely multiple hours. Time did strange things when the dark pressed that close.
 
I remember thinking about the lamb. About how quiet it had gone at the end. I remember wondering if that was what being protected felt like.

My tears turned the dirt near my face into mud. Very little, but even then it made it worse.

The mud seeped under the cloth and into my mouth where I couldn’t do anything but swallow. It tracked into my nose too where it slowly made its way all the way down my nasal passage and led into my throat.

All I could feel and taste was dirt, mud, and the regret of being born.

When he finally dug me out, I vomited dirt and bile onto his boots.

He watched without helping.

“Good,” he said. “You didn’t cry for help.”

“I didn’t want to,” I said, because that felt safer than telling the truth.

He smiled then, proud in a way that made my stomach hurt worse than the earth had.

“That’s my son,” he said. “You’re learning what you need.”

I left as soon as I could. I learned real prayers. Real law. I learned, with a kind of nausea, how thoroughly wrong my father had been. Animal sacrifice is forbidden. Blood rites condemned. Isolation rejected. Everything he taught me was the inversion of what he claimed to love.

I locked the memories away. I built a life that didn’t leave room for stone floors or bloody animals or six-cornered marks. For a while, that was enough.

Then my son was born.

The first lamb appeared two weeks later.

It was standing in an alley behind my apartment building, white wool already grey with city grime. It didn’t run when it saw me. It just watched, chewing slowly, as if it had all the time in the world. I told myself someone must have escaped a truck. I told myself I was tired.

But they kept appearing.

A loading dock at dawn. A patch of grass between two highways. Once, reflected in the dark glass of my car window—gone when I turned around. Always alone. Always calm. Always where they did not belong.

I don’t think they’re following me.

I think they’re waiting.

I haven’t told my partner. I haven’t marked the floor. I haven’t stepped into a church, white or otherwise. I haven’t touched a blade.

But I’ve started memorizing where the lambs appear.

Just in case.
