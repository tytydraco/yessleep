*My name is Evelyn Shaw. I am a young True Crime Journalist. These journal entries and conversations you are about to read come from an interview I performed with Thomas Hale. Mr. Hale is an incarcerated serial killer who was charged with the murders of 25 women and children, over the course of 50 years in the Pacific Northwest. He is believed to have taken as many lives as 350. Some believe the actual number could be much, much more.

At the time of this interview, Thomas Hale is 78 years old. He has been incarcerated for almost 5 years and is scheduled to be executed in a little over 3 months. He invited me to come perform this interview with him, and I walked into it not knowing his true intentions but with the impression he just wanted to share his life story before his end. I hope by the end you may rest with some of your questions answered as I have.

Some of the scenes and situations that Mr. Hale describes during this interview could be found extremely disturbing. DISCRETION IS ADVISED.*

December 22nd

As I was being escorted through Blackridge State Penitentiary by three armed guards I could instantly feel the dread that filled the air. I could see the rust colored condensation, old and new, running down the cinder block walls originating from the mesh point of the ceiling and bricks. A continuous chill ran down my spine ever since I left the reception area knowing that the disgusting insects and rodents that the run down building attracted were the least of my problems compared to the disturbed humans that occupy the cells that these walls surround.

On our way to the interview room we had to pass through one of the holding areas.. I looked up at the doorway and in black, stenciled spray paint it read, Cell Block C. We are about to make our way through and I realize that I am the first female that most of these prisoners have seen in years. My realization is confirmed by the horrible and obscene things they yell at me as I pass. Yet the first thing I notice is the horrid smells that fill the room. The smell of body odor and what I can only assume to be excretions violate my nostrils. Then I notice that the only light the room has is from the sunrise starting to shine through the room length window on one side. The orange rays that shine onto the two floors of cells on the opposite side of the room add a subtle beauty to the horrific visual they’re allowing to be displayed. The men are pounding and shaking the bars of their cells. The way they foam at the mouth, revealing their rotted black teeth and their animalistic actions only makes me think of an exhibit at a zoo. But only if the exhibit was holding rabid chimps.

The prisoners' yells and disgusting version of cat calling cause my face to redden and use all of my will power not to grab ahold of the prison guard’s arm beside me for protection all at the same time with the horrific things pouring from their mouths in my direction.

We exit the cell block and it feels like we performed some sort of teleportation. The building flips on a dime as soon as we walk through the door way and it turns into a clean white hallway. Almost like a hospital. The guards lead me down a few more lefts and rights through the hall and escort me through another open door. As soon as I step inside the door slams and I hear the mechanism lock the door behind me. I turn to see the guards man their positions in front of the door through the small rectangular window.

I turn back around to see an empty chair on my side of a stainless steel table. On the other side of the table I see Thomas Hale. His head is down, appearing to be staring at the handcuffs that are attached to his wrists as well as the table. Mr. Hale seems to be much different from the men in the cell block I had passed through earlier. He has clean, well kept hair and only has a mild bald spot for someone his age. His grey, thick mustache rests on his lip and is finely trimmed. I also notice his finely trimmed finger nails and can smell the sandalwood aroma that I assume is coming from his soap. He’s wearing an all white jump suit that he fills out nicely for being 78. I can tell that he was a well built man in his younger years. Mr. Hale tapped his brown sneakers on the white tile floor. I can’t tell if it’s his own impatience or boredom. Hoping to ease him if it does happen to be his impatience, I approach the table and take my chair. I pull out my recorder and place it in the middle of the table. I press record and begin our introduction interview.

“Good morning Mr. Hale! I’m Evelyn Shaw. Thank you for allowing me to come in and have this interview with you. Are you okay if I record this for my records later?”

“Yes, that’s fine. But, please just call me Tom, sweetheart.”

The rasp in his throat told me that he’s an avid smoker. Yet, his voice was still surprisingly soft and comforting. His baby blue eyes gleam with some sort of childhood innocence. They make me want to play a game of checkers or cards with him as if I were spending a Wednesday afternoon with my own grandfather. I think I actually shook my head to remind myself that I was sitting across the table from a serial killer. I gave him a polite smile and continued, “So, is there somewhere specific you would like to start? How did you grow up?”

He chuckles, “Yeah, no reason for pleasantries, we can start there… I was born to a single mother in a little shack outside of a small town in Missouri.”

“What happened to your father?”

“Who knows darling. I never knew him or had any idea where he’d have been.”

“Do you think not having your father in your life played a role in the actions you performed later in life?”

Mr. Hale’s eyes went deathly serious. A look that made me want to curl up in a ball, “Sweetheart… You’re not a therapist. You’re here to document what I want to tell you. So how about you keep those pretty little lips shut and let me talk.”

I stared back at him with disbelief but in my mind I asked myself what I was really expecting him to say. He continued, “Anyway, as I was saying. I was born to a single mother. I don’t remember anything abnormal in my early childhood, and Mama was a good mother for awhile, but I remember getting sick when I was real young. Probably 9 or 10. Mama ended up taking me to some lady in town that I later found everyone thought had hit every branch falling out of the cuckoo's nest. The lady had lit a bunch of candles around me and had some sort of dust in an old jar that I remember smelled like burnt hair and some sort of rotted produce that she rubbed all over my face. I questioned her methods in my own head but whatever the crazy witch had done worked on me. We was real poor so I didn’t know for sure how we had repaid her. But I knew Mama had given her something, because Mama… Mama wasn’t right in the head after that. She couldn’t work anymore cause of it, so she just laid up in bed all day and night staring into an abyss and talking to herself. Talking all kinds of nonsense of how, “The angel saved her baby” and praising God for his miracle. Mr. Hale shook his head and chuckled to himself. I’ve come to believe, just as I’m sure that most of the world will as well, that it wasn’t God that woman used to save my life that night. But anyway, I ended up having to leave school at about 12 years old in order to actually keep some sort of real food in the house and try to take care of Mama. That’s when I met Mr. Winston. I got a job with him collecting animal hides to sell. Winston was the one who taught me to skin and gut an animal. He ended up becoming more of my father figure, I suppose.”

“Was Mr. Winston a good father figure? Did he end up teaching you any valuable lessons?”

Mr. Hale lets out a deep, belly laugh, “Winston was a violent old mule! He mostly just taught me how to gut animals and what spots you can beat someone an inch from their life without leaving any marks in places that you could see them at Sunday dinner. But I respected the man.”

“So, how old were you when you started to realize you had your violent urges?”

Mr. Hale thinks hard about my question, “I mean, I suppose I’ve had them for as long as I can remember. Though they never really extended past animals and things until I was about 16. That’s the first time I killed someone.”

I can’t help the look of confusion that paints my face, “16? But your paperwork says you didn’t start killing until you were 18.”

His eyes seem to turn from his baby blue to a much darker color. The way they dug into mine was unexplainable, “Darling, I’m here to tell you that most of the things in my story are not going to be found in that little folder.” Mr. Hale leans back on his chair, “She was a cute little thing, just skipping down the sidewalk in her yellow sun dress. I think they said she was 11 or 12 at the time. I just remember seeing her as she was walking down Main Street. Her blonde hair shimmered from the sunlight and it roped me in as soon as I saw her. I couldn’t tell you the exact reason why, but I had to kill her. I followed her down a little alley, came up behind her and struck her with the handle of my hunting knife I had. The way she dropped like a bag of rocks — mmm —the feeling was unexplainable. It almost ticked me off because I couldn’t believe I had waited so long to do something like that. I threw her over my shoulder and tossed her in the bed of my truck. Once I got her into the woods I could hear her starting to stir. I dropped the tailgate and pulled her out by her ankles, letting her flop on the ground. I remember not knowing if it was a branch or a bone that snapped when she hit the ground. The way she felt as I ran my finger tips along her skin was more than I’d ever dreamt it could be. I pulled out my knife and traced the tip of it from her collarbone to her wrist. I put just enough pressure to draw the faintest line of blood. It had given her just enough discomfort to wake up. That’s when she started to scream. I placed my hand over her mouth and tried to calm her down, but she was fighting and scratched my cheek with her finger nails.”

Mr. Hale’s expression told me that he thought about this encounter quite often with the way he wore his grimace.

“God that pissed me off, Ms. Shaw, I lost it. But that loss of control felt so good. Like some sort of animal instinct I started to—“

“Okay, Mr. Hale, that’s enough please. I think I get the point.”

He gave me a smirk and it made my blood go cold, “Are we a little squeamish Ms. Shaw? I understand. Anyway, from that day on I knew I had a taste for what I had done. The power and control I felt. It was as if the sun shined brighter and flowers were more colorful. I felt complete and was determined to keep chasing that high again and again. But, I knew I couldn’t fulfill my thirst in my little hometown. So, that’s when I saved every penny I got and moved out to Oregon. Once I got there, that’s when everything changed. I’m not sure exactly how it happened but it was the best thing that could have happened to me.”

“And what was that Mr. Hale?”

He leaned in towards me and gave me another one of his smirks, “Once I realized what was truly under the skin. I was able to become something new. I was able to use my animalistic side to truly fill my new found hunger.”

That’s when the guards knocked on the door, telling us our time was up, “Well, I guess we’ll have to talk about that more tomorrow Ms. Shaw.”

After that first interview I didn’t want to spend another minute with that man. Being in his presence made me want to be sick. But, I reminded myself that it’s my job and stories like this are what people in my field work years to get. So, I took a long shower to wash my skin of the filth that I felt coated me from Blackridge, and tried to get some sleep before my next interview with Thomas Hale.
