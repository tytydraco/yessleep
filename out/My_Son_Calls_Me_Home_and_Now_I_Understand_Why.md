My son, M, is a pretty typical 2 year old. Maybe a bit of a velcro baby. He’s never called me “Mama” or “Mommy,” only “Home.” I take great pride in this little idiosyncrasy. It’s freaking adorable.

My husband, C, affectionately calls him my goiter. I choose to see past the obvious hurt behind this little nickname. Like it or not, my son is my number one priority.

M has had some sleep regression lately, so he started sleeping in bed with us.

That helped for a while until M, for lack of a better term, grew territorial over me, exiling C to the guest room. He actually bit C a few weeks back when he attempted the highly illegal act of kissing me goodnight.

He proudly presided over his newfound property (me) every night and took up the very cute habit of curling up right on my belly.

This recent change in behavior had been a mystery until recently.

We hadn’t been explicitly trying for another baby, but we were putting more effort into our intimate life, and that yielded a (perhaps obvious) side effect. I’m pregnant.

I think M could feel that something shifted, and he started acting up right around when the new baby was conceived. My husband disagreed with my theory.

The nights were tough since the happy discovery. With C barred from our bed, I slept a bit less soundly. Plus, M picked up a new habit of whispering into my belly button in the middle of the night. Though I didn’t enjoy the sensation of his hot, damp breath on my belly, I saw it as an early sign of sibling bonding.

The night before last, I woke in a cold sweat to the feeling of M’s small, clammy fingers clawing at my navel. I heard his hurried panting and incoherent babbling. I sat bolt upright and pushed him away on instinct. He tumbled backwards and bumped his poor little head on the footboard.

I apologized about a million times in frantic, hushed whispers. He finally drifted off to sleep after showering him with kisses and allowing him to ball up on my stomach once more. In his sleep, he murmured “Home.” All was forgiven.

I couldn’t get back to sleep for the rest of the night. I felt a strange tugging in my core, and my belly button ached where M had burrowed.

The morning finally relieved me of mattress duty. I got him washed and fed, then was mercifully left to my own devices once C took him to daycare on his way to work.

I had avoided looking at my navel all morning, unnerved by the raw, pulsing sensation.

By early afternoon, I couldn’t avoid it any longer, and stripped down in the bathroom. What I discovered horrified me infinitely more than my expectation of a ruddy, scratched up mess.

In my belly button's place was an inflamed, gaping maw, slick with stringy discharge. It possessed a distinctly animal smell, pulpy and thick. It pulsated and twitched, and I could not ignore the intense feeling that gnawed at my insides: an emptiness that can only be described as hunger.

A strong wave of nausea overtook me and my knees buckled.

I awoke some time later. I’m not sure how much time passed, but the sun was setting, so my husband and son would be home soon.

I hastily dressed myself without looking down at my own body. I sincerely believed (or deeply hoped) that what I saw was not real. I assured myself that my body was flooded with hormones causing weird hallucinations. You know, regular first trimester stuff.

All throughout dinner, I tried to act as normal as possible, but I don’t think I succeeded. My husband gently probed me while we washed and dried the dishes.

“You okay, my love?”

“I’m alright, just pregnancy stuff I think.” I (self) soothed.

“I hear ya.” He playfully patted his belly and winked at me sympathetically. He always knows how to cheer me up.

Just as my nerves began to settle, I was wrenched back to reality by his next question: “Do you smell that?”

“Smell what?”

He scrunched up his nose. “It smells like something died. Oh god.” He gagged.

“I don’t smell anything.” I shot back, very clearly agitated. I attempted to smooth things over with a nonchalant addition. “Maybe an animal wriggled into the crawl space and met his maker. You remember the raccoon last year?”

“Jesus, I don’t know. It's really intense right here.” He sniffed, attempting to locate the source of the stench like a bloodhound.

As he inched closer, I snapped, “You’re just trying to get out of helping with the dishes. As always.”

He halted, weighing his options. Luckily, he took the bait. “You’re right, I’m sorry. Hand it over.”

He relieved me of the last sudsy dish, and slid his warm fingers across the small of my back with his free hand.

“I know what would make you feel better,” he teased.

I tensed up, praying those hands wouldn’t drift any farther. I prepared to make a hasty excuse and retreat, but was saved by an outraged M rocketing in from the den.

“Home mine! No Daddy!” he screeched.

C threw up his hands as if caught by the police. He chuckled and scooped him up, hoping to make amends.

I had never seen M the way he was then, like a rabid animal. He clawed and kicked and wailed… toward the yawning orifice in my core. He reached out to me, eyes filled with pure, mammalian need. Ropes of saliva launched from his snapping jaws as he hurled himself closer. My own body seemed pulled toward him, as if an opposing magnet lived deep within me. In that brief moment, I was wholly terrified of my two year old son, yet I yearned for him.

My husband managed to drag him back into the den, flailing and convulsing and crying out for me.

Later, I showered with my shirt on. I preferred the clinging sensation of wet fabric to the horrifying reality of my own beastly anatomy, but I could not escape my own occasional downward glance. That unnatural, cavernous tunnel remained, wrenched wide open like a monstrous gullet.

I firmly shut down my husband’s insistent suggestion that we put M to sleep in his own bed that night. I just couldn’t bear the thought of being separated from my baby for that long.

Shortly after, C said goodnight, and M took his rightful place on top of me. He was nothing like the monster I glimpsed earlier. He looked peaceful and angelic. He only wanted to be with me, to be Home.

A dreamless, floating slumber possessed me.

I was vaguely aware of an otherworldly sensation in that barren coma. Digging, tugging, tunneling. Then nothing but a satisfying sense of fullness. I was whole.

I awoke softly at first, welcomed by cheery birdsong and a warm shaft of light streaming in. I then became aware that I was alone in bed. Where was my son?

Panic seized me. I snapped straight up, causing a lightning bolt of pain to shoot straight through me. My vision darkened momentarily, then cleared as I realized my belly was so swollen that any sudden movement might cause it to pop.

I wasn’t frightened or even confused. All at once, I knew that we were always meant to be this way.

I stroked my stomach, shiny and taut, and it pressed affectionately into my palm. The maw was gone, and my belly button sat happily in its place, plump and glistening.

“Where’d he go?” I cooed, tapping on my tummy playfully.

Nestled safely behind organs, muscle, and fat, his sweet little voice answered: “Home.”
