A few weekends ago I was out on a camping trip with some of my extended family. The cicadas were singing real loud as they usually do at this time of the year, and my Uncle might as well have been singing too.

My Uncle Roy, or Bud as everyone seems to call him, was telling the kids in our family a ghost story. I hadn’t heard him tell any spooky stories in a long, long time so I decided to join in. Although what he told me has shook me to my core, especially since all his tales never before involved himself at all.

I felt it was best to share it around online so anyone else who knows of something like this could possibly help me come to terms with what he told me.

“Lemme preface this with a warning little ones. Never, and I mean never ever, disobey a no trespassing sign." Bud croaked out with the most serious look in his eye I've ever seen. His beady eyes felt like they were drilling into my soul. "This little tale is one I don't tell often, but as I age I'm running out of stories to tell at these family expeditions so I feel like It's time."

Some of my younger cousins, the youngest around the age of 11 and 13, both shifted nervously. "It all started many years ago back in My hometown of Fort Finley." He paused for just a moment with recognition sitting behind his eyes. "My younger brother, Wiley, and I had been creepin' around the woods outside of town with a couple of our pals. Now I must admit, we were partaking in some underage drinking but it was a different time back then." He admitted with a slight chuckle. takin a cloth to his forehead as he turned to the nearby campfire. "We heard legends and tales of a treasure hidden in the woods guarded by the ghosts of criminals who had robbed tons of cities back when the town was first comin together." He paused to cough roughly. "Wiley was always the adventurous type and had been known to get into trouble especially if money were involved. So of course he and some of our buddies had wrapped me up in their plan to scour the woods during our summer break to find the lost goods."

"Uncle Bud, Ghosts aren't real." My cousin Missy had interjected, clearly she wasn't the good type of listener. "Missy, why don't you just listen." Her brother Bill popped her on her arm. "Calm down now kids, Anyway where was I..? Oh yeah. Around a few weeks into this expedition I seemed to be wrapped up in, We finally Found what we could call some sort of clue." he continued. "10-ish miles outside of Fort Finley we found a property deeply hidden in the woods. We didn't see much at first just a couple warning signs. All of em No trespassing signs. we passed a few that seemed to be in various foreign languages, I recognized a few in some Latin languages but some just looked like scratched up messes of wood staked into the earth."

"We hiked past these signs for hours. One of our friends Frankie was acting strange, speakin about how he was seeing glimpses of a deer, or something like that, following us. Of course we all called him a wuss and kept trucking along." He smiled lightly, I think that was one of the only fond moments he had left from this story. "The signs were dotted along a barely legible dirt path for a while until suddenly we hit a wall, at least a hundred feet wide of just clumsily put signs all reading 'No trespassing' in English, though it was carved into the wood with a dull knife, these by far were the most strange signs of all." He coughed again, a bit rougher than before. "All the birds we heard singing before had gone quiet, It was so quiet you could've heard a pin drop a state away. We all had an understanding to tread lightly and whisper to each other, as if to keep the peace."

"We decided that was enough and hiked back the way we came, We were efficiently spooked into leaving the area for a while if not for good. Though the silence of the forest followed us home, Long enough to where we could all tell we shouldn't turn back. Not ever." Bud chuckled darkly, sipping on a cheap beer he had that by now was surely warm. All this was getting to my younger cousins, bill and Missy, who wandered off leaving just me and Bud.

"I think that's enough ghost stories for now, I'm getting tired." Bud said as he stood up slowly, groaning. I was craving to know more. "What happened next Roy?" He stopped in his tracks but didn't face me. "Don't worry too much kid, Just head my warning, ya hear..?" He sauntered off to bed.

He wouldn't budge for the rest of the trip. Something tells me what he was saying wasn't just a story and that same something was calling to me to find out just what really happened. I managed to convince my friends to take time from their Fall break away from college to help find out more. Someone back at Fort Finley surely had to know what he was talking about.
