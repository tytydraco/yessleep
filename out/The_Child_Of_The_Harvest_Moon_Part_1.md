It was a night like no other, a night when the harvest moon hung low in the sky, casting a golden glow over the world below. The air was crisp, yet warm enough to whisper secrets only the stars could hear. On September 16th, 2016, in the quiet of a room filled with love, I gave birth to a child.

The room was calm, yet alive with a sense of magic. The walls, painted in soft shades of lavender, seemed to breathe with the rhythm of my labor. Outside, the full moon loomed large, casting its silvery light through the window, its glow bathing the room in a peaceful, almost ethereal glow. It was as though the moon itself had come to bear witness to the beginning of something extraordinary.

The air outside was crisp, cool for mid-September, but inside the room, the temperature was strangely perfect—66.6°F. It wasn’t too warm or too cold. Balanced, poised, serene. A reflection of how I’d hoped this new life would unfold: in harmony with the world, a part of the quiet beauty that nature offered. It was as though the world had conspired to create the ideal environment for the birth of my child, my child born under the harvest moon, at precisely that peculiar temperature.

But when they emerged, everything shifted. For a moment, there was silence—a pause before the cry that would soon fill the room. When my child was born, they were slightly purple, their skin an odd lavender hue as though they had been kissed by the twilight itself. It was a moment suspended in time, and yet, there was something unsettling about the stillness.

The doctors and nurses worked quickly, gently rubbing their tiny body, coaxing the breath from their lungs, and in that instant, the room held its collective breath. The cool air, the soft glow of the moon, the steady rhythm of the night—it all seemed to pause. As though the room itself was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen. 

And then, with a soft, almost delicate gasp, my child let out their first cry. It was as if the night itself had exhaled in relief, welcoming this new soul into the fold of the world. They had arrived, but their spirit had taken a moment to find its footing in the world.

As I held them for the first time, their skin warming to a soft peachy hue, I marveled at how they had come into the world—just as they were meant to, under the harvest moon, a symbol of both challenge and growth. The purple tint had faded quickly, leaving behind a vibrant, healthy child, their wide eyes searching the world around them.

But as the years passed, something... strange began to unfold. At first, it was small—innocent, even. I thought it was just my imagination, the weariness of motherhood, or the excitement of seeing them grow. But as time wore on, the inexplicable moments became harder to ignore.

It started when they were about three years old. I had tucked them into bed, as I did every night, with their favorite stuffed bear cradled in their arms. As I left the room, I caught a glimpse of something—just a shadow—darting across the floor in the corner of the room. My heart skipped a beat. But when I turned back, the room was empty, save for the soft glow of the nightlight and the rhythmic rise and fall of their breath.

"Just the light playing tricks," I whispered to myself. Yet, something lingered, a tension I couldn’t shake.

Then, one evening, as the moon rose full and high on another September 16th, I found them standing by the window, staring out at the night. The harvest moon hung heavy in the sky, its light bathing the earth in silver. My child didn’t blink, didn’t move. I called to them, but they didn’t respond.

"Sweetheart?" I asked softly, stepping toward them. When I placed a hand on their shoulder, they turned slowly, their eyes wide and unblinking. "Mom, the moon is calling me," they whispered in a voice that wasn’t quite their own. The chill that ran down my spine was unmistakable. This wasn’t the child I knew.

That was only the beginning.

As they grew, so did the unsettling occurrences. Toys would turn up in strange places, far from where they’d been left. At times, I’d hear them talking to someone in the other room, only to find they were alone. "Who were you talking to?" I’d ask, but the answer was always the same: "The man in the shadows."

One night, I woke to the soft sound of humming coming from the kitchen. The clock on the wall read 2:47 a.m. I tiptoed downstairs, only to find my child standing by the window, humming a lullaby I’d never taught them. The moon was full again, casting its eerie glow across the room. Their face was shadowed, but their lips never stopped moving, their eyes staring out at the night. They didn’t even seem to see me.

"Who are you singing to?" I asked, my voice trembling.

"The moon," they replied, without turning around. "It’s my friend."

The next morning, I found their drawings scattered across the floor—strange, intricate symbols I couldn’t recognize, spirals and shapes that seemed to pulse with a life of their own. "What are these?" I asked, but my child only smiled and said, "They’re for the moon."

Every year, on September 16th, when the harvest moon rose high in the sky, I would watch my child become a little more... distant. As though the moon itself was pulling them in, drawing them closer to something I couldn’t understand. And no matter how much I tried to hold them close, to shield them from whatever strange force was at play, the connection between them and the moon grew stronger.

I couldn’t help but wonder: was my child simply born under a celestial omen, a child of the moon itself, or was there something more—something darker—hidden in the shadows, waiting for the right moment to reveal itself?

And perhaps, just as I had felt that perfect temperature the night they were born, I too was being pulled into a story that I couldn’t escape—a story written in the stars, in the shadows, and in the strange, unexplainable moments that only grew more intense as the years went on.

One thing was certain: the harvest moon would always have a claim on them. And with each passing year, I could feel the mystery of that night growing—creeping—into the depths of their soul.
