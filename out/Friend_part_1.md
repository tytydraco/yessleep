When I was a kid, my father use to drop me off at my grandmother’s work often. He was busy often. I should have been glad since he wasn’t an easy person to live with, but instead I was terrified. See, my grandma used to run a small retirement home. I say retirement home, but I could say a morgue and I wouldn’t be very far off. Most of the folks were very old. This house was, more often than not, a one-way trip.

I would spend my days outside as much as possible. There was a school and a park just up the street, so I’d manage to occupy myself just enough not to get bored to death. That was long enough ago that there were still some trees and semblance of forests still alive where I could hide and play all on my own. But every once in a while, too often if you ask me, it would rain, and they wouldn’t let me go outside. 
I say “they” because it wasn’t my grandma. The folks there wouldn’t let me leave.

Every day that it would rain, hours before even a single drop would fall, dozens of them would get up and go to the front door to stand there, blocking the path. Those who wouldn’t stayed in the living room with me. Now, I could be remembering this wrong since it was so long ago, but I swear I can remember them staring at me. I would keep my eyes glued to the tv watching boring soap operas simply to avoid eye contact with any of them. The few times I managed to sneak away before they’d stop me, I would come back home to find them staring through the windows as I walked back in.

On rare occasions, my father would leave me there overnight. I’d lay on a couple of pillows in the middle of the common area, falling asleep from exhaustion to the sounds of horror or adult movies on late night tv, and woke up to people standing over me, staring.
I’d talk to my grandma about it, but she mostly shrugged it off. After a while, she even started to get angry at me. “These people have had a long hard life, they just enjoy spending time with young polite children, it reminds them of older times. You’re being mean.”

I felt bad, so I stopped bringing it up, but it still freaked me out.

Things turned bad when my dad booked a weeklong vacation with his new girlfriend, leaving me stranded in this bad dream of a building. I was five years old, and that damned week just so happened to be a record-breaking week for rain. It poured every single day. My captors spent days on end standing in front of the doors and windows in complete silence. 
I never really looked around the building before. I would usually stick to the common area, but I was growing stir crazy. So, I grabbed my Garfield book, my bionicle and my water bottle and went into the unknown.

 I snuck from my grandma’s gaze while she was reading her romance novels and descended into the basement. The end of the stairs gave way to a long hallway with over two dozen doors, many more doors than there were residents, giving me hope that one of the rooms might have been empty, waiting for me. But as I walked my way through the corridor, I could hear noise coming out of every single room. 
Moaning, crying, mumbling. Screaming.

I tried a few doors where I thought I couldn’t hear the noises, but the few silent ones were far worse. I’d open the door to find strangers staring, residents I couldn’t recognize. I finally arrived at the last door, the one at the very end of the hallway. As I looked back behind me, the distance between myself and the doors to upstairs gave me vertigo. I turned back to the door and put my hear against it. Silence. I took a deep breath and, summoning all my courage, I opened the door.

It was empty. No beds, no cupboards, no windows. Completely empty. I sighed in relief. I’d finally found my sanctuary. I spent what I thought was a few hours there, reading through my book from top to bottom twice, before I got bored. I Decided to go back to the surface to find that it was night-time. I got to the common area and saw my grandma in her lazy boy, sleeping. I pulled my pillows from the closet and went to sleep, giddy from the day’s discovery.

 The morning after, she didn’t bring it up. Thinking I’d gotten away with it, I decided to go back to the room. My jaw dropped when I arrived. Someone had brought a tv. It was lying there on the ground. “Grandma must have brought here for me” I thought. I looked at it but couldn’t find a power cord. Now that I think about it, it wouldn’t have mattered since there was no power outlet in the room anyway. In desperation, I pushed the “on” button anyway. To my delight, the tv turned on. I flipped through the channels looking for cartoons and I did find some, but there was a problem. The tv must have been broken because while there were indeed cartoon characters on the screen, the sound didn’t match. I could hear the news talking over moving images of SpongeBob, which was funny at first, but it quickly grew old. So, I found the news channel where the cartoons sounds were coming from and switched occasionally to get a grasp on the story.

I got annoyed and stopped to go back to reading my books. It was nice of grandma to give the tv, but the thing was busted. The background noise was fun enough though, so I left the news channel on to bask the rooms in sounds of children’s show.
After a while, something caught my attention. A voice came out of the tv.

“Edward! Edward! Come on buddy!”

The voice sounded familiar. It was high pitched and squeaky like pretty much every cartoon character ever, but I couldn’t put my finger on it. I approached the tv and changed the channel to see what cartoon it was from, but there was only static. When I switched back, my stomach dropped. The tv showed the woods where I would usually hang out on sunny days, but there were piles and piles of dead animals. Birds, cats, dogs, the camera would pan around until it focused on a deer nailed to a tree, its chest crudely ripped open with the flaps of flesh stapled onto the trunk as you would a poster for a lost pet. 
The camera finally settled on the deer’s head, and I heard the voice again.

“Eddiiiiie, stop ignoring meee!”

“Are… are you talking to me?” I asked aloud, surprising myself.

“Well, I don’t see anyone here, do I?”

“But my name’s not Edward, it’s…”

“I like Edward better.” It cut me off. “Don’t you?”

I felt very uneasy. Not really knowing what to say, I just nodded.

“See? I think we’re gonna be good friends you and me! And you know what friends do?”

“Uhm, no?”

“They give each other gifts, of course!”
I remained silent. The deer winked at me, and my stomach churned.

“Do you like rings? I’ve always loooved them, they’re so pretty, aren’t they?”

“Uhm… sure…” My eyes were glued to my feet, I couldn’t bear looking at the screen anymore.

“Get me a ring Eddie.” The voice was changed, deeper, meaner and tainted by static.

I nodded nervously. I took a few steps back, tears rolling down my cheeks, until my back reached the door. I closed my eyes and ran away, up the stairs and back to the common room. I reached the surface, and it was dark again. I built my makeshift bed and cried myself to sleep.

When I woke up, the main room was already filled with the residents. They were all sitting in their usual spots, which confirmed to me that it wouldn’t rain today. I finished dismantling my bed when I heard a clinging sound hitting the ground as I grabbed the last pillow. I looked at the floor and saw a ring lying there. I grabbed it and inspected it. It was a single gold band, simple and smooth except for a inscription engraved on the inside of it. The words were crudely written, almost as if a child had done it, and the engraving was rough and rugged, covering the inside of the ring all the way round. I instinctively tried to put the ring on but pulled it off fast when I felt a prick. The words had scratched my skin to the point of drawing blood. I glared at the ring, angry, as the word filled with my blood. I didn’t know how to read at the time, but I remember now.

The inscription read: From Eddie, To his best friend.
At the time, I simply put the ring in my pocket, still grumpy from the scratch it had given me. But my anger swiftly subdued to leave room for unease when I realized that everybody in the room was staring.
I went outside to clear my head. I walked down the sidewalk, and the weather was great enough to make me forget about the basement and the ring. I arrived at the park to find David, my summer buddy. We lived very far from one another so usually, we wouldn’t see or talk with each other, but every summer, the circumstances forced us to become best friends year after year. 
We played for a few hours before he asked me if I wanted to go play in the woods. Blood drained from my face, and I didn’t answer Immediately, images from the dead animals filling my thoughts. I tried to change subjects since I didn’t want to talk about the tv. As I searched for a good excuse, my hand wandered into my pocket where I found the ring. I had an idea.

“Hey look what I found earlier!” I said, showing off the ring. “It must be worth a million dollar, maybe we could trade it for candy at the store?”

My friend quickly forgot about the woods when he heard about the possibility of a bounty of candies. We both ran to the store, and when we got there, we were very sad to meet the owner at the cashier. He was old and mean, and more importantly, not as prone to fall under the charm of two annoying boys as the cute cashier that was usually there would. We presented the gold band to the man, and he barely glanced at it before falling into a fit of laughter.

“Buddy, I’m not a pawn shop. It’s money only, now scram.”

My friend cursed him, threatening him that he lost a very good customer (which we weren’t) and that he would never see us again (which was also a lie). The owner just scoffed and waved goodbye. 

We got out of the store and my friend announced that he would have to go back home, but he’d be at the park tomorrow morning if I wanted to play. I accepted the terms and went back home. When I arrived, I felt goosebumps on my arms and down my neck. The residents were standing at the windows, waiting for me. I went in thew building and rows of people were standing and glaring at me. They formed a path where I knew all the well it ended. I descended into the basement and entered the room, my heart beating blazingly fast. The tv, still in the corner of the room, light up on its own. I stared and the same deer on the tree stared back.

“Hi Eddie.”

I nodded in acknowledgement, my eyes fleeing to every corner of the room.

“Edward, you’re not being very polite. Look me in the eyes when I’m talking, ok?” it snarled.

“S-sorry sir.” I said, focusing on the screen. The deer had started to rot off, its eyes gone to leave two gaping holes.

“Hey, it’s ok buddy! We’re learning together to be very good friends, aren’t we?”

“Yes…”

“I think you have something for me Eddie, don’t you?”

“Uhm, sure.” I said as I dug into my pockets, looking for the ring. I found the wretched thing and placed it on the tv. 

“Man, does it look good on me Eddie?” it asked, excitedly.
I nodded yes.

“I feel like you’re lying.” The voice’s pitch shifted down as he spoke, the same angry tone as before.

“No, I-I swear! I’m sorry!” I started sobbing.

“It’s okay Ed, You’re right.” Its voice returned to normal. “Its just a ring on a tv, nobody can see it right, you know?”

I was still crying.

“You know what every ring needs? A finger of course!”

My tears stopped as I heard that. The words filled me with chills and dread. I rubbed my eyes and looked at the screen to see the deer’s teeth bare, as if it were trying to smile.

“If you’d just get me a finger, it would look awesome, wouldn’t it?” The creature laughed as the sound distorted, fired with static. I remained silent, not knowing quite what to say.

“I think I should go. It’s getting late and I need to sleep.” I shyly said.

“You can sleep here, can’t you? I can sing you a lullaby if you want.”

“But I don’t have a bed here…”

“I’ve seen your bed Eddie, it’s not much better than sleeping on the floor. Sleep here, at least you’ll be with your best friend.”

I didn’t know how to answer, so I just sat in the corner of the room furthest from the screen, sat on the floor and hid behind my knees. The voice called my name, or rather the name he chose, but I didn’t answer back. He stopped after a while and I was finally able to doze off. But as I drifted into sleep, I heard it murmur something.

“One day you’ll love me as much as I love you, Eddie.” It sang.
