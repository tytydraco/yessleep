I’ve been driving long enough that the road starts humming back

  


Not the engine. Not the tires. The road itself — like it’s thinking. Like it knows me.

  


2:47 AM. Nine hours since I left the warehouse yard in Arkansas, hauling some bullshit shipment of retail shelving no one needs.

  


Somewhere along I-70, Kansas or Missouri — I couldn’t tell you anymore. The map in my brain’s gone soft. Like it’s been left out in the rain too long.

  


Radio gave out around midnight. Just static now. I leave it on anyway.

  


It breaks up the silence. Makes me feel like someone might still be out there. Someone human.

  


I’d been waiting for a rest stop for the last sixty miles. Either I missed one or it never existed to begin with — wouldn’t be the first time the highway played that trick.

  


When I finally saw the glow of a gas station sign in the distance, I almost missed the exit. Swerved onto the ramp like my life depended on it.

  


The sign said OPEN.

  


But I didn’t see any lights behind the glass.

  


I parked beside one of the pumps. No other rigs. Just my truck and the shadows it dragged behind it.

  


The lights above flickered like they were hanging on by a thread, buzzing that high-pitched electric whine that makes your teeth ache.

  


Wind pushed the door open for me.

  


I stepped inside.

  


Nobody behind the counter.

  


No radio. No bell. Just the smell of bleach and something underneath it.

  


Something metallic.

  


I called out once.

  


No answer.

  


So I headed toward the bathroom.

  


That’s when I heard the humming.

  


Low. Slow. Off-key.

  


And weirdest of all — I knew the tune.

  


But I couldn’t remember how.

  


The bathroom was in the back, past a shelf of expired sunglasses and beef jerky that looked older than me.

  


The door creaked open like it didn’t want to.

  


Inside, the fluorescent light flickered like a dying wasp — buzzing hard, then stuttering, then buzzing again. Like it was glitching out.

  


One of the stalls was closed.

  


And someone was humming.

  


I froze.

  


It wasn’t the humming that got me — it was the song.

  


It sounded like “Green, Green Grass of Home.” That old country tune my dad used to whistle on Sundays when he was fixing the truck, before the beer kicked in.

  


Except it wasn’t right.

  


The notes were bent. Off somehow. Like someone trying to remember it from a dream and getting it twisted.

  


The longer I listened, the more wrong it felt.

  


Like it was humming me.

  


I knocked.

  


No answer at first. Then:

  


“Be out in a sec.”

  


The voice sounded like mine.

  


Not just close — exact.

  


I swallowed something bitter and waited. Pretended to scroll my phone with fingers that wouldn’t stop twitching.

  


The humming stopped.

  


Then the stall creaked open.

  


He stepped out.

  


Denim jacket.

  


Faded cap.

  


Same damn tired eyes I’d seen in every rest stop mirror since I was twenty-three.

  


It was me.

  


But not just some lookalike — it was me.

  


Except his hands were shaking.

  


And his face looked… grateful.

  


“Oh thank God,” he said, voice low. “You found it too.”

  


I took a step back, hit the edge of the sink.

  


“What the fuck is this?” I managed, but it came out half a whisper.

  


He smiled. Not creepy — relieved.

  


“I thought it was me,” he said. “But I guess it wasn’t. Not really.”

  


His eyes were glassy.

  


Like someone who just woke up from a long dream and didn’t know if they wanted to go back.

  


He stepped forward.

  


Raised his hand —

  


Reached for my shoulder like he was gonna steady himself.

  


Or pull me into something.

  


I didn’t wait to find out.

  


I shoved him back.

  


Hard.

  


He hit the stall door, thudding into it like he’d done it before.

  


Like this scene had already played out.

  


I bolted.

  


Didn’t look back.

  


Didn’t want to see what face he made when I ran.

  


I slammed the door open so hard it bounced off the wall.

  


Cold air hit me like a slap.

  


But something was wrong.

  


The lot didn’t look the same.

  


The pumps were a different color now — pale yellow instead of rusted green.

  


The flickering sign above the awning didn’t say “Denton Gas” anymore. It just said WELCOME in blocky black letters. No price. No logo.

  


And my rig…

  


My rig wasn’t mine.

  


Same model, sure. Same chrome grille, same rust stain on the passenger door.

  


But the decal on the side was different — a company I didn’t recognize.

  


Everline Logistics.

  


Never worked for them. Never even heard of it.

  


The cab door was unlocked. My boots hit the metal step like thunder.

  


Inside, the CB was on.

  


I don’t remember turning it on.

  


But it was on.

  


And it was humming.

  


The same broken country tune. Low. Tinny.

  


Like it was coming from the speaker — or from under it.

  


There was a photo on the dash.

  


My daughter.

  


But she wasn’t five in this one.

  


She looked nine. Or maybe three. Or maybe both at once.

  


Like her face was shifting. Like the memory was misfiled.

  


I turned to the mirror above the dash.

  


Checked my face.

  


It looked fine.

  


Tired. Cracked-lipped.

  


Still me.

  


But then it blinked.

  


I didn’t.

  


I stared.

  


It stared back.

  


We held each other like that — me and the thing pretending to be me — for maybe three full seconds.

  


Then I heard it.

  


The humming again.

  


But this time it wasn’t through the radio.

  


It was behind me.

  


Right behind me.

  


I turned fast.

  


Cab was empty.

  


Just my duffel, my coffee thermos, my logbook.

  


But when I looked back at the mirror—

  


He was there.

  


Same me.

  


Only not.

  


Paler. Eyes brighter. Like he hadn’t slept in weeks and liked it.

  


Mouth curled up.

  


He mouthed something.

  


“Tired yet?”

  


That’s when I knew I wasn’t gonna make it to sunrise.

  


I drove.

  


Didn’t think. Just gripped the wheel like it could save me.

  


The road stretched out forever.

  


But it stopped making sense.

  


Signs repeated.

  


Rest Area – 6 Miles

  


Then again.

  


Rest Area – 6 Miles

  


Then again.

  


Same torn billboard for that fireworks stand in Indiana — even though I was supposed to be heading west.

  


I passed a diner I knew I’d seen three states ago.

  


Same flickering neon. Same cartoon pig holding pancakes.

  


Even the same couple arguing in the window booth.

  


Nothing was straight anymore.

  


Everything looped.

  


Hours passed. Or minutes. Or days.

  


Eventually I saw lights. Another gas station. Different one this time.

  


I pulled in, heavy with dread but too numb to care.

  


Bathroom was cleaner. Brighter.

  


Soap still in the dispenser.

  


I splashed water on my face, watched it drip onto the porcelain.

  


Then I looked up.

  


He was still there.

  


Not humming now.

  


Just smiling.

  


Like he’d already climbed in.

  


Like he was waiting for something.

  


And I think I know what.

  


I’m scared to fall asleep in the cab.

  


Because I think he’s waiting for that.
