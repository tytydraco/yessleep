i know this sounds crazy, i thought so too, but after what happened, it’s not as crazy. I’m a 17 f and i grew up in a relatively normal family. I’ve always been the center of attention, so i guess i might have a bit of only child syndrome. Everything has been fine until yesterday when my parents sat me down in our living room for a “family meeting.” I didn’t know what to expect, we never had really family discussions. They seemed even more on edge than me though. My father looked at me with a smile that seemed almost fake. that’s when i was hit with a major bomb, i was gonna have a new sister. I didn’t understand, i was 17 and my 18th was coming up, why would they choose now? i didn’t really know what to say, so i simply shrugged and said okay, then i left to my room.

 not too long after i heard a knock on my door. “come in!” i called out. my mom crept in through the door, a teacup in hand. she handed me the mug and left. i assumed this was her way of calming me down so i just drank the tea and went back to scrolling through tiktok. A little bit later, i heard another knock. “come in!” i said once again. this time my father stood in door way. “how are you feeling?” I felt fine, i assumed he was asking how i felt about the new child. i just shrugged and said i didn’t mind. he left. 

it was getting pretty late now so i decided to lay down and go to bed. I was beginning to lay down when i felt a sharp pain in my stomach. i clutched my stomach and fell to the floor. “mom! dad!” i called out, hoping one of them would come like they always did. nothing. “mom? dad?” i called out again, maybe they hadn’t heard me the first time. still nothing. i felt the room around me begin to spin and then darkness. 

When i woke up, i was in the living room. my vision was still blurry but i could make out my mother and father in the kitchen taking. “we need another method” “kill him”  “failed before” i could only make out bits of what they were saying, but what i could make out scared me. Then the worst part of it all happened. right in front of my eyes i saw my mom turn into this shadow like creature. i clapped my hand over my mouth in order not to scream. What the hell is going on, i have to be dreaming. “daniel, if we don’t kill him soon, we’re going to be stuck in shadow form.” Daniel, who is daniel, my mom had never called him daniel. i’ve got to leave.

 i tried to get up but i felt stuck. i mustered all the strength in me to get up and tiptoe to the basement. i know that sounds like a terrible decision but they were blocking the exit. i creeped down the stairs of the basement, but one of the stairs was too loud. i knew we needed to get new stairs. there was silence and then loud footsteps. there was no point in being quiet now. i ran down the stairs and into the laundry room. there was no where to run to, so i hid. 

i can’t tell you where im hiding in fear that they will know. I don’t know what to do next but i can hear their footsteps and their slow breathing. i’m trying not to move but i don’t think im the only one in this hiding space, in fact i don’t think im the only child they’ve had. something’s going on (obviously) but right now there’s nothing i can do except hide.  typing this out in hope that you guys can help me before it’s too late. please.
