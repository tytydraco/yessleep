Cambria never existed, that’s what they want you to believe.

But I watched her die.

Now they’re coming for me.

I might already be gone by the time you read this, but it doesn’t matter, I need to tell you the truth.


Cambria and I met during freshman orientation at Forester University, both pretending not to be scared.

She wore a Misfits shirt four sizes too big and duct tape around her boots — not for style, but to “hold the nightmares in” according to her.

We bonded over cheap coffee, obscure metal bands, and our mutual hatred of small talk.

Most nights we would put on some music and do our best impression of being rockstars or stay up late and watch horror movies together.

She and I would take turns reading Lovecraft and Ligotti stories in deadpan British accents to see who could make others laugh the hardest before bed. 

Cambria wasn’t just my best friend; she was the only person who ever made me feel like I mattered. So, when she disappeared, I knew something was horribly wrong.


The university claimed she’d gone home for a “family emergency” but the problem with that excuse was that Cambria didn’t have a family. 

She had no parents, no siblings…only me.

I called, I texted, and I even emailed her professors, but nothing ever came of it. 

Her student email? 

Gone. 

The login screen just said: “User not found.”

When I checked her dorm, someone else was living there — a girl who insisted she’d been there the whole semester.

I went to campus police, but they told me that if she went home due to a “family emergency”, there was no point in investigating. 

No one seemed to be that bothered by her disappearance and what was once hot gossip on university campus eventually quieted.

It was like she’d been surgically removed from the world — and my memory was next.


One night, I lay in bed, rereading the last text Cambria ever sent me repeatedly:

“I’m looking into something I found here on campus. I’m going under to fight it. If something happens to me don’t go looking.”

Was this about the sleep study she talked about signing up for on campus? 

I remembered her telling me about it once.

“I thought maybe they could help me shut the nightmares out for good.” 

That was her reasoning for participating.

We used to joke about our sleep paralysis demons like they were nothing more than late-night hallucinations.

But now? I’m not so sure.


A few weeks after she vanished, I saw them walk for the first time.

I remember waking up to the sounds of beds creaking — one after another, slowly.

All down the hallway in sync.

Confused, I crept to my door quietly and cracked it open to see students filing out of their rooms — maybe fifteen, maybe twenty — moving in complete silence.

Their eyes were half-lidded; arms limp at their sides. They had that eerie weightlessness you see in the movements of sleepwalkers — like the body’s running on instinct instead of thought.

Their footsteps clacked in a soft, dragging hush across the linoleum as I tried to process what exactly I was witnessing.

Jenny, one of the girls from down the hall, passed my door. 

Her lips moved, barely audible.

“Vel-kirash...”

It sounded like a breathy, nonsensical syllable…not like a word.

I wanted to step out and speak but I stood frozen in the dark, watching them walk in unison down the stairs until they disappeared into the dark…


The next morning, it was just like any other day on campus.

I casually asked around to see if I could get a better understanding of what I saw.

“Did you have any weird dreams last night?”

I received some blank stares, a few laughs, and a lot of questionable looks.

No one seemed to remember anything about the events of that night.

Everyone seemed to think I was the crazy one.

However, I did receive a lead from a random person on campus who told me to check out the campus sleep study. It was apparently Forester’s “best-kept secret”.


I searched the university archives and found the sleep study — sort of.

I found it tucked away under an archived projects folder in the psychology department. It was called, “The S.S.M. Protocol — “Sleep State Manipulation.” and it was supposedly terminated two years ago.

There were no names of any participants listed, but the folder was labeled “Group C.” 

I couldn’t shake the thought — C for Cambria?

The only name tied to the project was Dr. Isaac Trenholm, one of Cambria’s professors. 

His faculty page was gone.

The only result I could find was an old PDF titled: “On Induced Conscious Dissonance During REM Cycles.”

It was forty pages of dense medical jargon, but one paragraph stood out:

“In a guided hypnagogic state, the mind can be gently urged with the word “Vel-kirash” (translation: to hollow the vessel so the womb may be filled) to accommodate a second tenant. Dream entities cannot enter the waking world unless the mind is first emptied as it is only dangerous when paired with autonomy. A lucid mind can be a prison — or a doorway. We are simply…opening the door.“

There was that word again.

Vel-kirash. 

What was Dr. Trenholm talking about? 

What was he hoping to accomplish with this?

I thought about the text message Cambria sent me and how she could have known something was wrong with the sleep study. 

She didn’t just fall into this, she volunteered to go under to stop whatever it was they were doing. 

But it cost her everything.


That night, at 2:33 am, the beds creaked in a dreadful domino-like rhythm as the students got out of bed and began walking.

Instead of watching, I followed closely behind this time.

The procession moved past the quad toward the faculty buildings, their bare feet slapping softly against the pavement. 

My heart pounded as I mimicked their pace behind a tall boy from my statistics class. 

His head lolled slightly as he walked, his jaw slack as he whispered under his breath:

“Vel-kirash…vel-kirash…”

They stopped at a locked maintenance gate on the east side of campus. 

A student stepped forward and pressed her palm flat against the metal. 

The gate creaked open slowly and they walked inside.

I froze at the entrance,  the air seeping out was sour and carried a faint chemical sting that burned my nostrils.

One of the students turned her head towards me. Not all the way — just enough that her half-open eyes brushed over me. 

For the first time, I thought I saw recognition flicker there. 

“Vel…” she breathed.

My pulse spiked as I stepped back too quickly. I panicked and tripped over my own foot, the sound echoed, causing every head in the group to turn at once.

Their eyes glinted in the dim lamplight; dozens of slack faces locked onto me.

I bolted, my footsteps thudding across the concrete as I ran. 

Behind me, their murmurs swelled into a chorus of chanting. 

It chased me across the quad, growing louder even though I didn’t dare look back.

By the time I reached my dorm, the chanting had stopped — but I didn’t dare close my eyes.

I never took my eyes off the hallway the rest of the night.


I saw them walk three times before I followed. 

I told myself I was gathering information, but really, I was just afraid. 
 
I wasn’t ready to go where she went, not yet.

However, my mind was made up.

The longer I waited, the more I felt her slipping away, like the world was actively forgetting her.

I was terrified that if I waited too long, I wouldn’t even remember who I was trying to save.

That’s what motivated me to practice in my room until I could mimic the limp limbs and shallow breathing of the unconscious mind.

I practiced in the mirror, swaying with my eyes cracked just enough to see — until I couldn’t tell where pretending ended and becoming something hollow began.


At exactly 2:33 a.m., when they rose from their beds to sleepwalk, I slipped into the already full hallway and joined them.

No one looked at me.

We moved together, barefoot — a slow procession of blank faces through the dark.

Outside the campus, the air was dense like underwater pressure.

The lamplight didn’t stretch as far as it should’ve across the quad as we passed the fountain toward the old biology lab.

Its windows were boarded, and chains were wrapped around the doors where a “DO NOT ENTER” sign hung crooked, the red ink sun-bleached into pink.

One of the students in the front of the pack reached out and touched the chain.

There was no rattling, no snapping, it simply fell apart, causing the doors to swing open on their own.

Inside, we passed through narrow, decaying corridor as the doors shut behind us.

Fluorescent lights hummed and flickered overhead. One buzzed so violently it blew out — and stayed dark for a full minute.

In that darkness, I felt the breath of one of the students upon the back my neck.

When the light returned, the hallway was unchanged, but I couldn’t stop shaking.

Symbols covered the walls — spirals, slashes, intersecting circles. 
 
One had been scratched out violently, gouged deep into the plaster.

Then came the stairs.

A narrow, concrete stairwell slick with condensation and no railings led us down.

Every step echoed like we were walking inside a throat.

A flickering light above us died again, and in that moment of darkness, I heard a voice echo faintly from inside the pipes:

“Vel-kirash...”

The syllables bounced off the walls strangely. It was as if they were being spoken in reverse.

When the light came back, everyone continued walking without reaction.

The walls shifted gradually from cinderblock to smooth, cold stone as we traversed across the uneven floors.

And then...we reached the lab.

Or maybe it was never just a lab.

At the center of the room stood Cambria, her breath ragged. 

In front of her was Dr. Isaac Trenholm, chanting in a language that felt older than words.

She wasn’t restrained; she chose to be there.

Maybe she thought if she gave herself willingly, she could stop him from taking someone else.

But whatever she’d hoped to fight…was winning.

The others stood around with their eyes closed, not watching, but chanting.

Each word that escaped their lips tightened the noose around her heart.

The carved symbols on the walls pulsated a sickly green in time with their chants.

The thing inside Cambria was not merely emerging — it was consuming her from within.

Her lungs convulsed. 

Something slithered beneath the skin of her ribcage, pressing against her heart.

Spider silk like tendrils entwined with her blood vessels, siphoning the life from her body as she twitched involuntarily.

I watched through squinted eyes as her muscles spasmed in a desperate attempt to let out a scream that she couldn’t. 

She silently mouthed a desperate “help me” from her cracked lips.

I wanted to cry out her name and tell her I was there but instead, I watched in horror.

Her eyelids fluttered in anguish as something tore free.

Dr. Trenholm staggered forward as the cracking of Cambria’s skull filled the chamber, his face shining with sweat. 

His lips trembled with joy as the creature, slick with afterbirth, tore itself free.

Trenholm exhaled a sigh of relief as it emerged from her skull, its skin thin, translucent, and showing twitching veins.

Tears dripped from the corners of her eyes and down her cheeks as its limbs moved in all the wrong ways, jerking violently.

Her fingers twitched and curled into a fist, then opened like a flower wilting in fast-forward.

For a second, her eyes cleared — no longer glassy but wet with terror. 

She looked at me, mouthed my name — and for a moment, she was there. 

Then she was gone.

The creature’s mouth twisted into a terrible imitation of a smile, but it wasn’t a face built for warmth.

And then, a barely audible whisper:

“Don’t wake up...”

The words pierced me, a desperate plea, and a warning all at once.

The creature’s head snapped toward me with impossible speed.

Its vacant, half-formed eyes locked onto mine, and I felt a cold click inside my chest.

I couldn’t stop the scream.

“Get her!” Dr. Trenholm commanded, pointing at me.

I didn’t think, I just ran as fast as I could.

I sprinted through the dark, lungs burning, the air thick with blood and chemicals.  

Claws scraped against concrete behind me, gouging deep into the walls.  

Emergency lights flickered, casting warped shadows as I ran.

My chest tightened as the sound of footsteps dragging softly but deliberately just out of sight grew louder behind me.

All the students from earlier…they were hunting me as well.

I could hear the creature’s movements close behind. 

I turned to see its limbs dragging and then snapping forward unnaturally fast like watching stop-motion in real time.

It let out a wet, gurgling rattle as it pounced, its ice-cold claws grazed my shoulder.

I twisted away, my shirt ripping as I felt warm blood drip down my back.

The students were practically breathing down my neck but the adrenaline coursing through me wouldn’t let me stop.

A door ahead shimmered faintly and desperation made me sprint for it with everything I had. 

I slammed into it with all my weight and finally burst out into the cold night air. 

I kept running beneath flickering streetlamps that buzzed and sputtered like they were dying. 

Every step I took felt heavier, the world around me tilting just slightly off balance.

My heart hammered like a frantic drum as I collapsed onto the cracked sidewalk, gasping for air as I dared to look back. 

The building loomed behind me, its boarded windows like dead eyes.

Somewhere inside, the creature still waited.

I know the truth.

I know what I saw.

I never went back, and I’ve been running ever since.

I found her…and I failed her.

I wonder if she was still in there.

If her last feeling was pain… or if she was already gone — carved out, emptied like a house no one remembers living in.


It’s been a week now and I’m at a bus station three states away typing this.

My friends say they don’t remember me. 

Not just Cambria — me. 

One of them even asked who I was before hanging up.

Last night, at the motel I stayed at, I thought I saw someone standing across the street watching me.

I shut the blinds, locked the door, wedged a chair under the knob…and still, I heard it. 

At 2:33 a.m., the faint shuffle of bare feet against the floor…and a harsh whisper through the vent:

“Vel-kirash.”

I don’t know how much longer I can run before they take me back underground, before I forget why I was running at all.

If you’ve ever dreamed of stairs that only go down — don’t follow.

Please. 

For me. 

For Cambria.

Just run.
