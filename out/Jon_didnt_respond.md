It started as a joke, as many things do. Jon sent a text to his friend James one lazy afternoon:  
“Guess what? I’m in Japan!”  
  
James, being familiar with his humor, responded with a simple,  
"Sure you are."  
The two exchanged jokes, with Jon sending a blurry image of Mount Fuji that looked like it was pulled off the internet. James laughed it off, knowing full well that Jon was sitting in his cramped apartment a few blocks away.  
  
For the next few days, the Japan joke became a running gag between them. Every time Jon would text, it would be something similar, “Just tried sushi in Tokyo!” or “These vending machines are wild!” James played along, sometimes responding with mock skepticism, sometimes indulging the joke, pretending to be jealous of his friends imaginary trip.  
  
A week later, James casually asked Jon to hang out. He hadn’t seen his friend in days, and he missed their usual routine of grabbing a drink or playing video games.  
Jon replied, “Can’t. I’m still in Japan.”  
  
James rolled his eyes and texted back, “Yeah, sure. Seriously, though, let’s hang out.”  
  
“I’m serious, man. I told you, I’m in Japan for real now.”  
  
James chuckled and called Jon out. He sent him a photoshopped picture of Jon standing awkwardly in front of Shibuya Crossing, with pixelated edges and mismatched lighting.  
“Come on, Jon, you can do better than this,” James typed, laughing at the absurdity of the fake photo.  
  
But then, things got weird. Later that evening, Jon sent a video. It was a first-person view of someone walking through the neon-lit streets of Tokyo. Jon’s voice narrated the scene, pointing out landmarks, commenting on the bustling nightlife, and even saying he had learned a few Japanese phrases. The footage looked legit, and the way Jon narrated it made it feel like he was really there.  
  
For the first time, James hesitated. Was Jon actually in Japan?  
  
Still, something felt off. The voiceover seemed slightly delayed, and some of the phrases Jon used sounded out of place. But James, not wanting to admit he'd been fooled, texted back,  
"Wow, okay, guess you're really there. Weird flex, but alright!"  
  
Jon didn’t respond.  
  
Days passed, and Jon’s silence became unsettling. James tried texting him again, calling, but there was no reply. Worried, James decided to drop by Jon’s apartment. Maybe it was all just part of the joke, and Jon was hiding out, ready to reveal the punchline.  
  
When James arrived at Jon’s building, he knocked on the door but got no response. The lights were off inside. He twisted the handle—unlocked.  
Inside, the apartment was dark and eerily quiet. As James stepped in, he called out, "Jon?"  
No answer. He wandered through the apartment until he reached the living room—and there, sitting on the couch, was Jon. His back was turned, his figure perfectly still.  
  
"Man, you had me going," James chuckled, walking over. "Alright, let's end this joke now. Where have you been?"  
  
As James approached, something felt wrong. Jon wasn’t moving, not even shifting his body slightly in acknowledgment. James reached out and touched his shoulder. That’s when the figure fell forward, collapsing onto the floor with a hollow thud.  
  
It wasn’t Jon. It was a life-sized cardboard cutout.  
  
James staggered back, his heart pounding. A cold sweat washed over him as he stared at the lifelike cutout of his friend. What the hell was going on?  
  
Frantic, he ran through the apartment, searching for any sign of Jon. The place was empty, abandoned. It was as if Jon had never lived there. He grabbed his phone and called Jon again, his hands shaking. The call went straight to voicemail.  
  
James’ mind began to spiral. He scrolled through his phone, looking for pictures of them together—there were none. Photos that once showed them hanging out, laughing at parties, or at concerts had vanished from his gallery. In their place, there were blanks or pictures of James alone.  
  
Confused and terrified, he called up mutual friends. Each time, the response was the same:  
"Who’s Jon?"  
"I don’t remember meeting anyone by that name."  
"Are you feeling okay, James?"  
  
It wasn’t possible. Jon had been his best friend for years. They grew up together, shared memories—didn’t they? But now, no one seemed to remember Jon, and the more James insisted, the more people questioned his sanity.  
  
His phone buzzed. A message from Jon: “Are you sure I ever existed, James?”  
  
James dropped the phone. His thoughts raced, a flood of fragmented memories and distorted reality. Had Jon ever been real? Was this all some sick joke? He started to wonder if his mind was unraveling, if he was slipping into some nightmarish delusion.  
  
The gaslighting continued. Jon—or whatever was posing as Jon—kept sending cryptic messages, planting seeds of doubt. James found himself losing track of time, questioning every memory, every experience they had shared. He isolated himself, consumed by paranoia. Friends who once knew Jon now avoided James entirely, whispering behind his back, as though he had lost his mind.  
  
One night, driven to the brink, James returned to Jon’s apartment for the last time. The door was still unlocked, the cardboard cutout still lying on the floor. James sat down in the empty living room, staring at the walls, his thoughts swirling in a void of confusion.  
  
He opened his phone, scrolling through old conversations, trying to piece together some proof that Jon had existed. But there was nothing. No photos, no texts, no videos. Only the echo of Jon’s voice in his mind, mocking him.  
  
“Are you sure I ever existed?”  
  
James couldn't take it anymore. The weight of doubt, the crushing loneliness, the feeling of being trapped in a reality that didn’t make sense—it was too much.  
  
He stood up, walked to the window, and stared out at the city below, the lights blurring as tears filled his eyes. The world outside felt distant, unreal, just like Jon. The only way to escape the nightmare was to end it.  
  
And so, James stepped forward into the void.  
  
Later, when the police arrived, they found no traces of Jon, no indication that anyone had ever lived in that apartment. To them, James was just a troubled man who had lost touch with reality. A tragedy. Nothing more.  
  
But in the back of James’ phone, in a hidden folder, a message lay unopened:  
"Goodbye, James. It’s better this way."
