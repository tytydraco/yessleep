I can't stop thinking about this for the life of me. Maybe someone here can help me figure it out. 

I was walking home through the woods at 2am in June two years ago -- just after one of my field courses had ended. I had walked these paths through these specific woods countless times during the day and also at this point at night, but that night felt different. Pleasantly so to be honest! This was the first night - to my surprise - that i wasn't *afraid* of the dark. I felt confident, for the very first time. Didn't feel the need to check behind me, be vigilante of every shadow, sound and movement. I was *vibing.* Well, until the light showed up. 

Maybe my newfound confidence was already a sign that something had been off. Or maybe i'm wrong to be suspicious at all! Now that I think back at it, the forest had been oddly quiet. No insects, no wind. It was a dense beech forest - so it was super dark, too. For context, this was in the dead center of Germany. I'm honestly more familiar with North American folklore than I am of our own.

All of this must've happened in the blink of an eye but to me, it seemed to drag on for ages. 

I was approaching a turn, walking downhill, the path beyond the curve was hidden behind the dense undergrowth.  Which is where suddenly, the light approached. Round, slightly golden hue. Bright, but soft. Not blinding. Uniform, not wavering. It was just kind of there. 

It took a few "steps" until it stopped. I stared at it and it ... looked at me, i suppose. It was right on the path in front of me, some 10-15 meters away i suspect. I rarely see people here during the day.  Best case, this was just an animal. Or something entirely different. 

We stood there forEVER. I was trying to figure out what i was looking at. The light stood idly, unmoving. I didn't know what to do. There were no alternate paths, i would've had to walk -- haha, or *run* back a long way until i could take a different path. Before I could decide, the light left towards the way it came from. *Great!* i thought. *Crisis averted.* I still could't move, didn't know what to do. "Should I risk it?" i spent a heartbeat contemplating if the shortest way home was worth risking running into that ... thing again.   
**Didn't matter!** Cause the light came back sprinting towards me -- not stopping this time! -- with a ferocious energy that sent me running up that damn hill :3c  what was calm before turned strangely wild. And well, suddenly not so cautious of me anymore. 



Here is the awful part that I couldn't make sense of. My train of thought was as follows:

• the light is at eye level. It's either a large animal, or *worse,* **a person.** 

• I turned my light off to see if it was emitting light, or reflective. When i turned my light off, it disappeared. Okay, reflective! So it's not a flashlight. Not a person, then?

• My next thought: animal. Of course: the eyes are reflective! But ... there's only one. And it's huge. Okay. **one eyed deer it is!** (we don't have large wildlife here. Wild boars, deer, european badgers, red foxes. That's about it.)

• if it's an eye, why is it ALWAYS facing me? If it was a reflective eye, it would've shifted if the animal moved their head etc. It was always the same shape, and had a slightly yellow-ish tint. 

Whatever. it's an animal. *No big deal, right?*

• the light was on the same path as me. **gravel**. thick, lose gravel all the way down. it was dead quiet in the woods. As it was moving towards me, it didn't make a damn sound. Any animal that size/ height would've made noise. Anything with feet, really.

• it was also ... huge. It was too big to BE an eye. And if it was an animal, why the heck would it disappear, only to come running back *towards* me?

  
It also didn't move in a way that an animal would have. Or a person with a flashlight. The light was bright, but soft, not blinding. It didn't move up and down. It moved in such a way as if it didn't have a physical body. It didn't seem to be affected by gravity, if that makes sense. Part of me is wondering if this was neither animal nor person, maybe it was clever enough to turn off/ hide itself as I was turning my light off? In an attempt to hide ... or alike?

Once it came towards me with a speed that drained every thought from my brain, I ran uphill and never looked back. Once I reached the top of the hill, i took a few turns, in attempt to confuse and ultimately lose whatever was following me. I flung myself into a thorn shrub (ouch) and waited it out. I stayed there until sunrise some 4h later and ... took a different path home. Nothing ever happened. Maybe I was fast enough to escape it, maybe I was never in any danger. 

Maybe I had just met the only one eyed owl in the forest? I sure hope so! :\^)

It drives me nuts not knowing what that was. Do you guys have any idea?
