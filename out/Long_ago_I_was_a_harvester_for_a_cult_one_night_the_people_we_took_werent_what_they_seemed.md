My task was always relatively simple, scout the isolated roads provided by Mother&Father (M&F), set the bait, sedate and abduct. 

Typically I would use road kill, a dead kangaroo or a dog or really anything big enough to draw attention, sometimes I would gore it up a bit to make it more enticing, it usually worked fine.

The process of reprogramming back at Homebase was typically long and always barbaric, M&F were always insistent on using the limits of the subjects capacity to endure pain as their means of indoctrination and it worked, people break a lot easier than you'd think when they're isolated in unknown territory and pushed to their limits. 

We were based high and deep in the hills, far enough from suburbs that nobody would know they're gone or even where they'd go missing, but close enough that we got people coming through, granted it wasn't very frequent, but that's how we liked it, no need to build our numbers up too fast and raise any red flags to the area we were in- I spent many of my working nights just sitting and waiting, chatting to my brother and hoping we get some action. 

This night in particular was warm and still, the road kill we had was a fully grown kangaroo we found that had been presumably hit by a car a little further towards the nearest town, it was perfect bait. All we needed was for them to stop and get out for about a minute and we'd have them. 

My brother would use a dart gun that was laced with a strong sedative, one to the neck for each of them and they were incapacitated within seconds. It was always clean and simple. One of us would take their car and ditch it in one of many spots we scouted previously,  while the other transported them back to Homebase in the truck and then come back to pick the other up. It was clockwork, we'd been in it for years, we grew up in it, it was all we knew. We were good at what we did. M&F had most of the local PD in their pockets, so we didn't really need to worry, but still had to be very cautious as not to draw attention, there's only so much leeway the police could give before having to actually do their job, so discretion was paramount, it was part of the agreement we had.

There was good money in trafficking people, which we'd do on a rotation. One for the cult, one to sell, it kept us afloat for as long as I'd been alive.

We had what looked to be tourists driving along the road, probably lost or some such, and so we went to work, we waited for them to stop and gaze at the kangaroo we had placed for them, and brother wasted no time, his accuracy was incredible. In the dark of night and from quite a few metres away he'd always manage to get them right on the neck, pin point accurate. They didn't even know it happened before they passed out, one minute they're inspecting a dead roo and the next they'll be awoken by M&F as they began the ritual.

Tonight was different, though. 

The ritual began as it normally did, Father chanting and Mother poking them with hot needles, she knew every specific nerve point to cause the most pain, and they were screaming, as they often did. Father began to bleed them into a cup and feed them. It was all going to plan.

Then the woman's eyes turned black, pitch black. 

Not the kind of black you get with dialated pupils from adrenaline and fear, her eyes were entirely the darkest shade of black I'd ever seen. 

Her blood that she'd been fed was was dripping from her mouth, she began to growl and with seemingly renewed strength, she fought against the chains she was tied up in. I was nervous. We hadn't seen this before. The more it went on the less human she appeared, and the husband was just giggling to himself - "you're all fucked, you're all *fucked*" he repeated as she grew more frantic.

Father was beside himself with excitement, what an asset this thing could be for us, a creature not known to any recorded history at the disposal of our humble cult of worship. An asset, he truly believed she could be turned. That she could be tamed.

It all happened so fast, the chains snapping free as she lunged at him, scratching and biting his face with a feverish and animalistic delight, tearing and ripping until Father's face was nothing but loose meat, his skull had become visible.

Most of us fled, the husband was laughing manically, "you're all *fucked*! I told you, I told you, *fucked fucked fucked!*", she lunged from person to person, snapping ones neck, slashing the other with her finger nails, I barely managed to get to the truck in time. She had wiped out everybody. Every last one. I sped off and saw her barreling towards me on all fours, before seemingly losing interest and turning around so fast I could barely comprehend it. 

I didn't stop driving. I drove for miles. I took to the highway and didn't stop until I was the next state over. I've never been able to make sense of what she was, what had happened. Maybe I had gone mad, I don't know. It all feels like a dream now.

It was 15 years ago, there were never reports of the massacre in any news articles, like it never happened. 

I mourn mother and father, my brothers and sisters, I didn't know how to even live for many years. That family was all I knew. 

Whatever it was, I pray to whatever gods that will themselves to listen that I never encounter it again. 

But in the back of my mind it feels like she's watching, stalking, waiting from afar, never did I think I'd be so desperately wishing to be in a state of unfounded paranoia.
