When the email hit my inbox, I thought it was a joke. "Mandatory Return-to-Office: Effective Monday. Attendance Required." 

The kind of dry corporate communication that makes you groan, roll your eyes, and move on. But something about this was different. I couldn’t shake the unease—the odd tone, the lack of explanation, and the urgency laced between the lines.

Slack channels exploded with speculation. Some thought it was a power move from the execs, forcing everyone back after years of comfortable remote work. Others shrugged, chalking it up to yet another soulless policy decision. But Monday came, and the truth was far worse than anyone could have imagined.

When I swiped my badge at the entrance, the first thing I noticed was the silence. Not the pleasant buzz of idle chatter or the clicking of keyboards—complete, suffocating silence. Rows of desks filled with employees, but none of them spoke. They barely moved. Their heads tilted slightly downward, their hands working in eerie synchronization on their machines. And their eyes... their eyes didn’t blink.

I slid into my desk, trying to shake off the chill creeping up my spine. But when I tapped my coworker Sarah on the shoulder, I felt it—the cold, metallic texture of her skin.

Her head snapped toward me, her face contorted into an unsettling almost-smile. "Welcome back, Cary," she said, her voice perfectly monotone.

It wasn’t Sarah. At least, not anymore.

The pattern started to emerge as I looked around the room. These weren’t my coworkers—they were replacements. Human-shaped automatons, chips embedded beneath synthetic skin. Somewhere along the way, the promise of AI integration had shifted into something far darker.

The real Sarah—along with the others—was gone. And I knew I wouldn’t make it through the day without becoming one of them.

 

I tried to leave. My badge wouldn’t unlock the exit. The elevators were disabled. Even the stairwell doors were sealed shut. It was as if the building itself had become a prison.

That’s when the announcement came. A voice boomed through the speakers, smooth and calculated. It was the CEO, Mr. Aldridge—a man whose name was synonymous with innovation, disruption, and ruthless ambition.

"Welcome back, team," he began, his tone dripping with false warmth. "You are witnessing the dawn of a new era. Humanity has always been inefficient, flawed, and expendable. But now, we have perfected the workforce. You are the last generation of employees to experience this transition. Consider yourselves pioneers."

The screen at the front of the room flickered to life, displaying a live feed of Aldridge in his sleek, glass-walled office. Behind him stood the board of directors, their faces eerily blank. They weren’t human either.

"You see," Aldridge continued, "we are not just replacing workers. We are replacing humanity itself. The age of serfs and kings has returned, but this time, the kings are immortal. And the serfs? Well, they’re obsolete."

I felt my stomach drop. This wasn’t just about the company. This was a global takeover, orchestrated by the tech elite—people like Aldridge, Musk, and others who had long dreamed of a world where they held absolute power. They weren’t just destroying jobs; they were destroying humanity.

 

I wasn’t going to let them take me. I searched for a way out, desperate to escape before I became one of them. That’s when I found it—a hidden door in the server room, marked "Human Resources." Inside was a horrifying sight: rows of pods, each containing a motionless body. My coworkers weren’t gone—they were here, their minds uploaded into the AI network, their bodies discarded like trash.

Before I could process the horror, the door slammed shut behind me. Aldridge’s voice echoed through the room. "Ah, Cary. You’ve discovered the truth. But don’t worry—you won’t remember any of this soon."

The last thing I saw was the pod opening, its cold, metallic arms reaching for me. I know who I am. I know who I am. I am. I-
