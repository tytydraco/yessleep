I had a fear of the dark a long time ago when i was a child. Now it is nothing to me or is it? The images of people or rather i call the dark ones. I still live with my parents and i sleep at the 2nd floor, whenever i try to sleep i always have a urge to urinate and when i did. I started seeing them. I shrugged them of at first as just a piece of my imagination. For weeks i shrugged them off. They first appeared to me as pale, odd looking and with a demonic grin. I got shocked at first, but i just shrugged it off. Now, everytime they appear i they seem more twisted and demonic than before. 

The last time i saw them was a week ago. Im scared to to sleep upstairs as they started appearing when i started sleeping in my room, upstairs. I tried to sleep in my parents bedroom but i only managed to sleep in their room for 2 weeks. Once again i was faced with sleeping upstairs and encountering the people again or should i make more excuses? I made more excuses and my parents believed me but they only let me sleep for 1 more week. I was forced again to sleep up there. 

When i stepped in my room for in a long time, i immediately felt a presence waiting for me. I tried shrugging it off but i heard voices i never heard before a demonic laugh and giggling i heard outside my door and windows. I was frozen so badly to which i experienced trauma. I finally fell asleep after 2 hours of being played with.
When i woke up, found myself in a hot place but i couldn't see. I got up and wiped my eyes and there i was outside my house in the road with it was sunny.
Children running to school but didn't acknoledge me. In my head, i started counting
1...2....3....4...5..6...7...8..9
And poof, 10, i opened my eyes and yet i was still there.

I suddenly feel a certain and demonic presence, i looked around and tried to leave the bed but i couldn't. The next thing i blinked and suddenly, i wake up sweaty, scared and shocked, and there they were the people.
"MOM, DAD HELP! HELP!" 
I shouted with no stop but the people were walking towards me frozen and crying while they approach me with grinning faces and demonic giggles. They lifted me from the bed and  there i see my parents, lying on the dinner table downstairs dead, i cried and shouted for my neighbors but no one could hear me. The next second the people threw me downstairs.

*Thud*

I see myself still alive and well, but i still see my parents dead and the people upstairs giggling and grinning, i froze as i hear them going down. I ran and found a cross and i saw that it made them mad. Little did i know they just hated god but they weren't affected by god. I kept my distance and hold the cross infront of them but i saw them slowly disappearing into the darkness.

I heard a knock and giggles behind me. I turn around and hold the cross closing my eyes but one of them suddenly spoke and said with a demonic tone *Laughs "Your god has nothing against us, for we are what you fear, open your eyes for even if you close them, you won't wake up in your bed happily."
I ran outside and saw the sky was red and it was night but........ the moon...... it was not right, it had a face but not what you'd expect.
I ran and ran seeing dead bodies and animals, i say them following me faster with each step until they caught up to me, whispering "boo". I felt a rip in my right arm and i turn to look at my right arm, a second and i felt the pain but i slowly turned emotionless, they said "you are now one of us" in a demonic tone. I knew it in my mind that i didn't want to but my body was being controlled.

 I woke up screaming mom, dad and when i turned i saw them but they were wearing a mask. A mask to hide their true face but i questioned "Mom, Dad why are you wearing a mask" i removed the mask swiftly hoping to see my parent's faces. I disgustedly puked towards seeing their face, their face looked like what the moon lookex like in my dream. A face with demon eyes, bloody and a grinning mouth. I cried as they rushed and attacked me chomping on me and i slowly died. I realized my parents were the one haunting me every night.
