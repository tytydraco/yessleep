Marie thinks I should try to keep a diary. So: Hello dear diary. I don't know what to write, not much happened today.

*12/19/22*

The diary does not work so well. I'll try to think remember more often. Today the mailman just threw my mail on the floor because the box was full. Stupid asshole. That's all that happened.

*12/26/22*

I found a bitten burger in my kitchen today. I don't remember buying it or why I should have left it after one bite. Nothing indicates that anyone was in the apartment. Nothing is missing, the locks are fine. I briefly thought about calling the police, but then I thought about how I would probably react in their situation. It's disturbing, but what should I do now? Maybe I should go see a doctor.

Threw the burger away.

*12/28/22*

This morning there was a bird stuck INSIDE my living room window. Right in the middle of it! Looked like it flew through and got stuck. I've never seen anything like it. It was up to its neck in the splintered window, dead. I don't know how this is possible, shouldn't they just break their necks when they fly into a window?

*01/01/23*

Jesper gave me a clock. I don't know how he got the idea, there was no reason. But he suddenly stood in front of my door and handed me the package, smiling with joy. He insisted that I hang it in the kitchen above the door.

Ugly thing.

When I asked him why he gave me this clock he shrugged his shoulders and said he just had to think of me when he saw it.

Strange day.

*01/02/23*

My bathtub has a crack in it. It stretches from the drain to the edge. Is this caused by temperature fluctuations? It has been mild late summer weather here for weeks. Dr. Kline says not to read anything into everything and not to worry so much. Annoying anyway. 

*01/03/23*

Nothing special happens today. I don't like the watch. I think I'll take it off again.

*01/04/23*

Okay Jesper just called me and told me to put the clock back up. What?! When I asked him how he knew that I had taken it down, he said he had seen it by chance through my window.

I live on the third floor.

He hung up. The clock is now in the trash, with the burger.

*01/05/23*

The carpet in my living room was rolled up. It wasn't me! Again, no one in the apartment. I think I'm going crazy. Have an appointment with Dr. Kline tomorrow, I think the pills would be useful after all. Or an MRI.

Hardly got to roll it out again, as if it was encrusted.

*01/07/23*

The emergency scan was unremarkable. Dr. Kline says a psychologist could probably help me better. I don't go to him anymore.

By the way, the bathtub now has several cracks. The landlord is just putting me off. Things aren't going so well at work either.

I think this diary thing is useless.

*01/09/23*

I took the garbage out a few days ago. When I got home from work, the fucking rotting burger was on my kitchen table. ON THE CLOCK. Called Jesper and yelled at him, I mean who else could it have been? I don't know how he got in, maybe he copied my key.

He said he doesn't know what I'm talking about and doesn't want to get yelled at for a gift. I think he's offended, but screw him.

It's both back in the trash.

*01/10/23*

The tape on the hole in my window came off. You'd have to **scrape** it off, it doesn't come off that easily. I really don't know what's going on here anymore. I think I really need to see a head doctor.

The parts of my bathtub somehow keep coming apart. I don't want to look into the cracks, I think there's mold underneath or something.

The landlord says I have to pay for a new lock myself.

*01/11/23*

The whole day I got the feeling someone is watching me. I sat down in the corner of the living room. Of course, no one is watching me. But after the clock just hung in the kitchen again when I woke up, I no longer feel safe here. Marie also thinks I should talk to someone. I am already on the waiting list.

There are critters coming out of the bathtub. Looks like silverfish or something, no idea what it is. The landlord says someone will come next week.

I let the clock hang now.

*01/12/23*

It's not funny anymore, I want to get out of the apartment. When I came home my carpet was lying upside down and a tuft of hair was lying on it. Could have been mine, don't know. I immediately went downstairs and called the police.

They say they can't do anything, I don't have any suspects and nothing was stolen. I honestly don't think Jasper did it either. They think I should change my lock, but I don't have the money for that.

*01/15/23*

I've been staying at Marie's for three days now, but I think it's time I went home. She calmed me down a lot. Tomorrow I have to be there anyway, then the craftsmen come because of the bathtub.

*01/16/23*

There is some kind of nest in my bathroom. They said I should first call an exterminator or something and left again. Fucking shit. I don't want to get on Marie's nerves again. I'm going downstairs to Mr. Keller's kiosk to use the bathroom.

The landlord does not answer, I'll try again tomorrow.

*01/17/23*

Instead of helping me, my landlord is now threatening me with eviction. Because of the bathroom and the window and he says something is dripping from the ceiling in the apartment below me. I can't do this anymore. By the way, I now have another broken window.

*01/20/23*

I haven't opened the bathroom for two days. The landlord refuses to pay an exterminator and I can not afford one. I don't know what to do. There's some stuff coming through the wall between the bathroom and my bedroom. I pushed the bed away after it dripped on my face.

Marie says I should get out of there right away. Jasper doesn't talk to me anymore.

*02/03/23*

Sorry for the radio silence. I've been with Marie for two weeks now. We got my stuff out of the apartment last week. No idea what it is but most of it was rotten. My ex-landlord is threatening to sue. Asshole, like it's my fault.

Left the clock hanging there.

*02/04/23*

This morning a bird woke me up by flying into Marie's guest room window. I still don't have an appointment with a psychologist.

*02/07/23*

Marie didn't come home today. Doesn't answer the phone either. Found the fucking clock in front of the door.

*02/21/23*

Found this crappy diary down here. I'm in the basement and can't get out. I don't know what's up there but it's all over the house. Dripping more and more from the ceiling. I keep hearing shattering glass and the dull sound of something hitting a window. I don't know where Marie is. I don't know why no one is coming. After the sink burst in Marie's bathroom, I wanted to leave, but I didn't know where to go. The police wouldn't help me with Marie either.

There is no signal down here for some reason. I'm scared. I don't know what I'm being punished for.

*??/??/??*

It's nice down here.

Hey guys, I found this diary in the basement and transcripted it for you. There’s no trace of Mika. The police don't know how to help me. I don't know what Mika is describing, my house is fine and I’ve seen and talked to her the past couple days and weeks. She was acting weird though. Maybe someone of you has an idea what I should do now. Mika is unstable and missing, but unfortunately she is an adult, so I can't report her as missing.

I'll get back to you after I fix the stupid window.
