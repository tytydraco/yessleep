So I guess I should start with: I work at a haunted house. It’s been around since the 80s and I love my job. People might expect a 50 year old haunted house to have its ghosts but other than an old man who had a heart attack in 98 there hasn’t been anything dark or grisly. 

I started working here a couple months ago. It was great. The people who work here are a little odd, but you kind of have to be in order to be a scare actor. 

Me—I’m not usually one of the scare actors. Most days I work in the box office. I let people in and I have the amazing job of setting the scene of the house. I give them the rules and put on a really creepy facade to make them feel like they are walking to their deaths. It’s ridiculously fun.

The house itself is located on the oceanfront, so there’s always a good amount of tourists this time of year. The entertainment scene really picks up during vacation season. You’ve got performers everywhere. There’s people on stilts walking down the street and, my personal favorite, rave Chewbacca—it’s exactly what it sounds like.

But this one guy… I remember one of my coworkers telling me about him before I ever saw him myself. A scrawny white dude in a busted wig walking up and down the street blurting “WHOOO!” and “HEE-HEE!” I was so sad I missed it, but he actually came through the house once. Apparently he was scared shitless and was reciting “Billie Jean” in a shaky voice the whole time. It sounds like it was hilarious. 

The only thing about my coworker’s story that seemed off to me was when he told me that MJ—we’ve been calling him MJ at the house—came back around after he went through and just stood across the street staring into the box office window.

It’s a haunted house, so you’ll get the odd person every now and then who tries to scare the workers there. Scaring the scarers or whatever. It gets old fast. So when word got around that MJ kept showing back up to mess with whoever was in the box office, people started expecting it.

It was around half past 11 when I saw him for myself. No wig. No sequins. Just a dude in jeans and a hoodie. He walked up to the window and said, “Is Dave there?”

We tell the unsavory guests we’re all named Dave—it’s a bit. So when someone asks for Dave, we know they’re being annoying. I didn’t say anything.

One of my favorite things about working here is that the customer isn’t right, we are. So I ignored him. 

Then he hit the pose. The MJ hat-grab, knee-bend thing. And I realized who it was.

I tried to hold a poker face, especially now that I knew it was MJ. He held the pose for a lot longer than I thought he would and the silence was starting to get to me a little.

As soon as I was about to tell him to get lost he smashed his forehead against the glass right where my face was and screamed, “WOOOO!” His face seemed distorted, like his jaw unhinged a little more than it should’ve.

I flinched so hard my sunglasses flew off.
Then he just… stayed there. Breathing against the glass. And then he whispered. Not angry or even playful, just curious.

“What’s wrong with your eyes?” He said it, but his mouth never moved. It was like the words seeped from his gaping jaw. 

Then I blinked, but it was like I was blinking for the first time in my life. Like the lids didn’t fit anymore. They didn’t even feel real.

Then he turned and walked off like nothing happened, muttering “Smooth Criminal” like it was stuck in his head.

I know that’s not much, but ever since he said it, I keep checking my eyes in my phone camera. They’re blinking out of sync. Left, then right. It’s like my brain can't handle it.

We decided to look over the security tapes after I told everyone about the incident. It was exactly like I remembered it. He walked up, asked for Dave and hit that pose. 

The only difference was when he slammed his head against the glass. I remember it only being a couple of minutes in the moment, but the security footage said he sat there staring into the glass for 12 excruciating minutes.

Looking back at the rest of the security footage we caught him at the back door. 
Just yanking on the lock.

We tried rewinding. Fast-forwarding. Doesn’t matter—the video *freezes* right before he shows up and again just before he leaves. Like he’s skipping through time. Or the camera doesn’t want to see him.

I’m trying not to freak myself out.
I’ll [post again](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/NBRQoHHYJg) if I see him.
