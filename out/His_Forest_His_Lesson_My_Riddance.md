Haze, haze, so much haze. 

It was like the whole world had evaporated, clouding my vision with an endless sheet of grey steam. 

The process of adjusting my eyes was a strained labor. It was difficult to even keep them open, it felt like I had woken up at midnight after just a couple hours rest, groggy and delirious. 

I tried to breathe but it was stifled by a dry cough. A dull ache was wrapped tightly around my windpipe, I was being constricted. Something was pulling me backward by my neck. 

Amidst the cloud I was drug through, someone was walking by my side about eight feet from me.

I felt around my throat and looked down, a rope had been coiled around it. I was at the end of a noose.

I dug my heels into the floor, hearing them hit and scrape concrete. I grabbed the rope with both hands and pulled it away from me, as I did I brought my head back with my mouth towards the sky. With my efforts I had managed to breathe a little easier, though nothing I did hindered whoever was dragging me

The figure beside me stopped, “Cease, he has woken.”

The rope loosened and as it did I came to an abrupt halt. I gasped.

The figure stepped closer. He was boyish, almost feminine-looking. In spite of his young appearance he stood like a giant, too massive to be human. He had to have been at least ten feet tall.

“He has given you the right of knowledge and I as his messenger am to bestow it unto you.” The juxtaposition between his voice and his appearance was absurd; a deep bellow strained upon epochs of use, fitted to one who didn’t even look to be an adult.

“You are to experience the consequence of what you have made of free will. You are to see sin as you have constructed it and you are to see yourself. You are to be punished, you are to learn. This is your price for bliss and your price for redemption.”

He took another few steps forward and crouched to meet my eye level, he was sizing me up.

“He has some sort of pity towards the youth,” his tone was now much less orderly, more colloquial.

“I do not understand it, you are all the same; one huge wad of phlegm, a gross sickness upon the world you tread,” he tilted his head, looking quizzically, “Just how young are you?”

My throat stung, I hardly had the energy to reply, “Eighteen.” 

He shook his head and raised his eyebrows for a quick second, “Old enough to know better.”

He stood upright and sighed, regaining his composure. “You have three questions you may ask before your arrival,” he turned to me and leaned forward, “Choose wisely.”

I had hardly processed anything he said. I was cold, freezing like a popsicle at the back of a freezer. My brain felt like it was boiling in my skull and faintly in the distance, I could hear some sort of siren echoing above me.

I wheezed, “What’s that noise?” 

He looked up and smirked, “A savior's chariot. Its charioteer, its passengers,” he looked down at me, disgusted, “much too gracious for the likes of you.” 

As he stared at me his wear became more vivid through the fog. He had a silver fit of armor covering him from the neck down. Underneath it sat a coat of chainmail and underneath that sat white padding. On his waist was a belt and connected to that belt was a holster concealing a short sword.

Frankly, he looked foolish. His attire reminded me of some costume at a Renaissance Fair. 

“Why are you dressed like that?” I was less afraid of who I spoke to and more confused.

He looked to the person who had been dragging me, “Carry on.”

There was a pause then a similar voice spoke out of view, “But he said-” 

“Carry on,” each word was slow and drawn out, he was furious. 

Before I could speak I was dragged, carried further and further as the mist around me blurred into one big mess of grey color. 

I kicked across the floor and brought the rope outwards but the strength with which it held me seemed impregnable. I was essentially drowning on land, reaching my head up desperately to suck in whatever air I could. If the rope had been any tighter I would’ve had my esophagus crushed. 

It was an agonizing couple of minutes before I finally reached where they planned on sending me.

\_\_\_\_\_

At once we came to a stop. The ‘messenger’ walked behind me. From where I laid I could hear him draw his sword and spear it into some sheet of metal. I could hear the metal twist and turn till an ear splitting creak came and lasted for about ten seconds, a gate had been opened.

Suddenly I was drug again for just a few more seconds. I had been brought through the gate to a land of ebony darkness, the bleak fog seemed lively in comparison. 

Surrounding the gate was just more darkness, it was attached to nothing. It stood like a portal to another dimension. 

My captor dropped the rope and walked backward towards the gate, keeping a watchful eye on me. He was nearly identical to his partner in appearance. 

If a wrong place existed this was it. Only ten seconds had passed since I arrived, but that had been enough.

I sprinted for the gate but as I did I was pushed five feet backward by his long arm. Wordlessly he exited and closed the gate, he and his partner not turning back and paying no mind as I ran for it and shook it as thoroughly as I could. 

As they faded into the fog I gave up and turned to face what I had been thrown into. 

Dead Trees stood like black obelisks, jutted from thick mud strewn as far as my eye could see. What little light there was reflected the ground beneath my feet, revealing a film of some ooze or slime caked atop the mud. Across the land was a trickle of leaves, remnants of a lush woodland. 

At each side were two wooden signs. Across the signs were arrows pointing ahead and below the arrows read one message each: Riddance

One step forward and the leaves under my foot crunched so loudly it was as though just stepping upon this ground was a violation, a disservice towards my innate desire of self preservation.  

Progressing forward in any right went against every born instinct I have, but I still did so, hesitantly.  

It felt wrong, felt like I was approaching a horror unknown and invisible but all too consuming within my mind. Yet all the while, a part of me buried deep within seemed to inexplicably long for whatever awaited me.

The trees were menacing, like soaring monsters just waiting for an opportunity to cut me down.

The hostility of each and every crevice I passed was bewildering. Even the air was oppressive, a sharp cold that sat stagnant; no breeze was present but my body still shook each second I spent in its embrace. My jacket did little to protect me from the onslaught.

Observing the air further I found it had an odor; smoke, burnt wood. There are no good memories that come with smoke of any kind, even in this hellscape I could still see myself in my Mother’s car, coughing as she took drags from her cigarette with the windows up. Whether it be from the visual or the cold, I found myself shivering as the thought came to mind.

The odor wasn’t necessarily that surprising; the forest looked completely ravaged. It looked war-torn, like it had been lit ablaze with napalm.

Most of the trees had been blackened with soot though the ones that had any color on them shared one discernible attribute; they were all engraved with one of two markings: wide slits or eyes. Each marking had been etched in manually, around the eyes were rings that made them look sunk into the trees.

One of the trees has both a set of slits and eyes. In the darkness it was hardly visible. I approached it to get a better look.

\_\_\_\_\_

If you’ve ever heard a death rattle, a hack from a sick or dying animal, or if you’ve ever been sick and near death yourself, retching and groaning, then perhaps you may have the faintest idea of what I heard at that moment. 

Imagine standing beside a track as a train heads your way. Imagine the earth shaking and bubbling as it strolls along. That same bubbling and quaking seemed to come out of the mouth of whatever was behind me. And as it’s voice shook and quivered it rasped, like air leaving a corpse. 

I turned around, there was nothing but the dead forest I passed. Seeing this, I thought that the tall trees and long shadows engulfing me were more dreadful than the sight of any monster could have been. 

Isolation is a helluva thing, isolation within nothingness however, is an entirely different beast. This land was nothing, so devoid of everything that my very essence within it was an anomaly. 

I turned back to see the tree I had been looking at. From the eyes it cried some sort of clear liquid like the condensation on a cold beverage. From its slits it bled, a crimson trickle smelling of metal, smelling of iron. 

I should have been scared, or at least confused, but I was remorseful. The tree appealed to me somehow, its eyes began to look afraid and sorrowful. It was like a need, I needed to show pity, sympathy, empathy, and care; I needed to be there for it when there couldn't have possibly been anyone else who could.

I caressed the side of it, its bark was soft to my touch. Perhaps I recognized the emotion within its eyes, perhaps I recognized the slits, perhaps I knew just what this tree was feeling.

I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, shaking just a little under the cold. I took one last glance at the tree and headed forward. 

Out of the corner of my eye a darkness like a shadow moved out of sight. Turning its direction, I saw nothing.  

I seemed to have a change of heart the very second this unfolded, to put it bluntly, I was scared straight. The very idea of a monster in here with me, sharing my anomaly with its presence alone, *was* worrisome. Downplaying the threat of a monster had been utterly stupid, if not maybe even disrespectful and facetious. Because, realistically, in this void expanse I’d probably never see it coming.

I shuddered, now bug-eyed and checking each side of me.

As I approached where I thought I saw it, the reek of smoke began to become suffocating. I coughed and wheeze, unable to move any farther,  hunched with my lungs about ready to collapse.

And then it subsided. It was like a pestilence had been lifted from the air. As it went away I heard shuffling by where I saw the mass of darkness. 

I cocked my head to see a young man. He was wearing a green field jacket. He had long black hair and brown eyes. It didn’t take long to realize that man was me. 

This man, this twin, was laid across the ground. He was writhing, one hand grabbing towards the sky and the other wrapped just below his throat. He was opening and closing his mouth like a fish on dry land. Each time his mouth opened it looked like he was trying to scream, to suck in all the air in the world, but he just laid silent, flailing and convulsing, he may have been seizing. 

No remorse was felt for the thing laid in front of me, that’s what it was after all. It was a thing, the monster I had been dreading oh so dearly. It may have had my face, my body, my clothes, and my hair but it wasn’t me because I was, and I am human so clearly *it* must not have been. It was some copy, some replica, something to be feared. 

I ran off deeper into the woods, at the thought of turning back came the thought of the locked gate and the single word written on the signs: Riddance.

I hated everything about this place, I hated everything about heading further, but there wasn’t any way of avoiding it. I had been sent only one direction to go, one hope perhaps, amidst everything. No matter what I felt, I had to see it through. 

\_\_\_\_\_

A brief respite had been set during my journey. I spent most of it waiting for something to happen, but it never did. Eventually, I realized that I didn’t even know how I got here. I had memories of my early childhood, good and bad. I had memories of my early teens and even memories that seemed to be from just a few days ago, but any recollection pertaining to how I ended up in this place seemed to be erased from my mind like an artifact lost to time. 

Since arriving here I hadn’t had the time to ponder much of anything. I didn’t even consider for one moment if this was some nightmare or some fever dream, something made up. Things like this didn't happen. Places like this didn’t really exist. This was something fake, something *I* conjured, because the alternative was preposterous, a belief in fiction and an insult to common sense. 

*This isn’t real*, I thought, watching each tree and each piece of land as though it could hear me.

*I am going to wake up in my bed. I am going to forget this place as it should be forgotten. Because this place holds no bearing; it is not rea-* 

THUD!, THUD!, THUD!, THUD!, it sounded like someone smashing a slab of meat against something hard. 

As I looked to see what it was, I was as embarrassed as I was anxious. If it wasn’t real then why was my heart racing? If it wasn’t real then why was I looking in the first place?

It took about five seconds- five resounding THUD!’s- to make out what I was seeing. It was me, same face, body, and clothes. My copycat was slamming its head against one of the trees. One huge wound sat like a burst abscess below its scalp. Its forehead was reddened and layered with soot, across its arms were blood stains seeping through its jacket. It didn’t bother looking at me, only grimly casting its gaze to where it would slam itself next.

I ran because nightmare or not, I refused to hear that things face squelch against the bark any longer.

With each step I took through the woods I swore I saw some dark figure pass me by, but each time I looked it’d be gone.

Once I was far enough the squelches faded and I was rid of the thing that had been releasing them,

aside from the figure, the forest remained still and lifeless; silent in noise and in exuberance. The quiet sent a tension through my body, halted when it was broken yet again.

It was almost impressive how diligently the creatures of the forest had made themselves in my image. With each encounter I had with them, including this one, I questioned if I was somehow looking in a warped mirror. 

It had its hands across its face. It was screaming, muffled, but not by its hands. Its mouth was closed and set in blank expression, not even so much as twitching as it howled, nor did the rest of its face. Whatever voice it had was trapped beneath its skin. And with that skin it pulled. It pulled and pulled on its face until it completely tore off. It sounded like tearing chicken from the bone of a drumstick; it sounded like a spread of wax being torn off someone's body; it sounded like the worst thing I’d ever heard. 

Its screams got so much louder in that moment, they were so guttural, so agonizing. A mad thought danced in my head, telling me to rip *my own* ears off just to have a chance of silencing them in my mind.

I had known these things weren’t human but seeing what lay just beneath their skin cemented that fact even further. It had no muscle, no fat, and no tissue to speak of. As it turned to me, grabbing its head, I saw nothing but a charred skull with splotches of ash peppered across it.  

Before I could even run I was met with another one. It just stood completely still. From the top of its head sat a gaping hole, spilling a pool of blood and pink brain matter.

More and more of these things just kept showing up, I had no time to linger, I had to get away.

\_\_\_\_\_

I made it about thirty feet before the figure emerged, this time staying in frame as I turned to meet it.

The whole time I had been in these woods I thought this figure had a face, a body, some sort of form obscured by the darkness. The truth was this thing was the darkness, a complete absence of color. It was like a black hole constructed in the shape of a man. The only image of light on its body were its two eyes, plastered like sores on the front of where its head was shaped. And seeing that those eyes were not looking my way, nearly made me collapse from relief. 

“I hate you.” I jumped, if I hadn’t known any better I would have thought I said it. I turned to see it.

“I hate you.” The sight of it disturbed and disgusted me, it looked like a pathetic reflection of what I was, face reddened and tears pouring over its cheeks.

“I hate you!” It spoke much too loudly. I couldn’t be seen or heard by that shadow lurking in the woods, I had to shut it up.

I was sick of seeing these things, sick of running from them. Seeing its face- my face- look so pitiful made me furious.

I punched it straight in the nose, sending it sprawling to the ground. 

I stood over it. Through a stream of blood running across its lips it spoke, “You're awful… You’re awful, you’re awful, YOU'RE AWFU-”

I kicked it in its stomach then stomped on its face, over and over until it was mangled unrecognizable and looked nothing like *me*. 

I killed it. I didn’t know what to feel. It wasn’t human but did it really need to die? It was out cold by the second stomp, why did I keep going?

The smell of burnt wood rose once again. It was worse this time, I thought I’d suffocate. I collapsed.

Curled into a ball, just about ready to die myself, I looked towards where the scent reigned strongest.

It was the figure, its eyes trained on me as I writhed on the floor. In each hand, he held the two copies of myself I had seen previously. Their faces were burned and beaten, they were dead. From where the figure held them by the neck, their skin bubbled and melted before my eyes.

Wordlessly it moved away from me and went off out of sight. 

It made no sound as it left, remaining as silent as the land it inhabited.

The thick smoke released its grip and I was given a chance to reflect as I knelt across the thing I had killed. 

*Did I enjoy it?,* I thought, *Why am I like this? Rushing to hurt whatever I can.*

I took off my jacket and got ready to roll up my sleeves. I was freezing, but I needed to concede with the ramifications of the deeds by my own hand. I rolled them. A part of me had set it to be that I had made up each wound in my imagination, but the sight before me was damning. 

I stood, looking at my victim. *Am I really above this thing?*, I wondered, *Am I really much different?* *Or is that just what I’m telling myself? I seem to like hurting myself, I seem to like it a lot.* 

The memories of the night prior to entering this place flashed in an instant.

I had hurt myself. I wasn’t going to come back, this time the wound was just too deep.

Staring at my body lying dead in the mud, I wondered how I must’ve looked in my world, aside from the beaten face, it surely couldn't have been much different. 

I was sure it wasn’t human, but was I? What human does such things to themselves? What humans act so thoroughly against their own instincts for survival? What human could land themselves here? In here I was nothing but an accessory to the mean forest I walked through, hardly human because that’s what I had reduced myself to being. 

The frigid air stung even more now, internally I felt colder than this forest ever could. I thought back to the sign; Riddance. I didn’t know if I could ever really rid myself of what I’d done, but I needed to try, I needed to follow the arrow. 

\_\_\_\_\_

I had put my jacket back on and set out.

After that point the forest had lacked even further. My copies, the figure, none of them made any sort of appearance. 

It was like this for hours, in hindsight the memory has become just a blur of suffering, near hypothermic in a barren darkness, completely alone.

A large empty patch of land opened and became more and more observable as I proceeded.

Now close enough, I began to realize what I had stumbled upon. It was a structure, it was a building. 

The building was like a mansion, rows upon rows of windows stretched across its front and a set of two doors at the top of a long staircase.  

Above the doors, a label of identification: Hospital 

The irony of the label was almost humorous. The 'Hospital' was like a spec of dirt upon my vision. Its white brick walls were riddled with patches of black grime and large cracks. It looked decayed; a sick building meant to facilitate health and wellness.  

The space of land between the trees and each side of the hospital was so great that it looked like they were rooting themselves as far from it as possible.  

It was a gaping wound upon the desolate forest, and within that wound- as seen through its open doors- was infection. 

I could hardly make it out but it was apparent enough.  

The entrance led down a hallway, the tiled walls stained yellow, falling apart and leaving large clumps of rubble littered across its floor. Spread through the walls were large red-ish brown patches.  

As I peered through the doors a light bulb within the hallway flickered; a dim LED. As it did I saw the rubble move across the floor, pushed by some odd gust of wind, never yet seen in the stillness I passed through.  

The hospital was hideous, repugnant enough to send the Devil hightailing it back to hell. But this was what I came for, this was riddance.

It would be grueling, it would be wretchful, but if that was the price then so be it. I had come so far from the gate and so far from the monsters, I would not go back now.

\_\_\_\_\_

My confidence and bravado dwindled with the first step up the staircase; it felt like reaching to climb a mountain. I started having to psych myself up just to move any further. It was daunting and my apprehension grew each second. Step after step I became more and more conscious of what awaited me. If this place wasn't safe for the Devil then what chance was there of it being safe for me? I couldn’t think about that, I had to keep going.

I finally reached the top. I looked down to see just how many steps I had taken. There were ten of them, sure didn’t feel that way.

As I saw the doors I looked away, I didn’t want to see what I’d have to head through. Averting my gaze I saw the figure about twenty feet away in the distance. It was not moving, it just stared at me. It was like it wanted to see if I’d actually enter; I did.    

The breeze was the worst thing about that place. It came in odd intervals, Pushing through the hall for a couple seconds and then steadily pushing backward and toward the doors. 

The hallway reeked of ammonia and rubbing alcohol, as if someone came to wipe this infrastructural stain clean from the land with a bunch of chemicals.

The length of the hallway made absolutely no sense when considering the exterior, it stretched endlessly and couldn't have possibly been attached to the building. But sense and reason had lost their value long ago.

“I’m so, so sorry,” I had been examining the filth across the walls, the voice sent me reeling. It sounded like a woman, sending some meek and hardly felt apology. I looked to all sides, finding that the voice had no apparent source.

A sudden warmth started flowing through my left hand. This was the first bit of heat I had felt since my arrival. My hand grew hotter and hotter, at first it had been pleasurable but it steadily increased to feeling like I had shoved it inside a mound of fire ants, and from there it began to feel like I had shoved it inside a bucket full of molten metal. The heat just kept growing until finally my hand ruptured, exploding like a landmine. 

My hand was gone, nothing left but a stump at the end of my forearm. I was screaming, I thought I’d pass out. Adrenaline rushed through my veins and I shot as quickly as I could down the narrow passage. With the rubble whistling past my feet, I reached a doorway at the end of the hall. 

Just like the previous two, this door was open, open and revealing more tiles and more patches, except here the patches were dark red and covering the entire corridor, turning it into nothing but a smudge of dull color.

Running through the doorway I was hit with a wall of familiar scent; woodsmoke. 

The lights dimmed even further as I reached this area. At each side sat rows of rooms, inside were hospital beds and armchairs. 

The rooms were nothing but a small clump of sand within the vast desert of my psyche. My hand was gone, the cold breeze of the hospital burning into the stump left behind like a frigid cauterization. It was a miracle that I hadn’t lost consciousness and I was going to take advantage of it. I was going to get out of here. I had to get out of here.

\_\_\_\_\_

Each room passed like frames on a strip of film, moving lazily at a slow rate. In an instant the interiors of each of them changed. The walls were blackened and on each bed laid one of me. 

Their sudden appearance had shocked me, it had been hours since I had last seen any of them. 

They were burned, clothes in charred tatters. Some of them had been melted to the bone, others had just large blisters of pink, red, and yellow; *all* of them, no matter how damaged, had their eyes visible; all of them stared at me. 

My legs were aching, my chest was heaving, but I ran even faster. 

Looking forward I saw a trapdoor on the floor about one hundred feet from where I was. As I spotted it, the patients in each room began to choke and squirm in their beds. I wasn’t looking at them but I didn't need to; rustling sheets, caught breaths and faint squeaks pierced sharply through the muted hall, providing me with a vivid visual of their suffering.

I kept moving, the strained breathing and creaking bed frames becoming something of a cacophonous soundtrack fitted to my journey. I was fifty feet away from the trapdoor when the noise stopped dead. I almost stopped dead myself, the silence was harrowing, a profound suspense. 

Above me the ceiling tiles flew off into nothingness, revealing hollow darkness, a black sky.

A single pill fell upon me, followed by a trickle of water. Then one more, then one more, until they came through the void in a number so great they looked conjoined as one huge mass of color. A flood poured in behind them, sending me off my feet and crashing to the floor. I stumbled upright, gasping and shivering. 

The water was like a liquid flow of ice. Being this damp in this temperature, I’d die before it even dried from my clothes. I wouldn’t give up on myself like that, not again. I needed to live, I needed to leave. 

A second storm of pills cannonaded across my body, I knew what’d follow it. 

The trapdoor was now just ten feet away. I was so cold but the heat of my will seemed to ignite in that moment, this was the one and only chance I had. 

I nearly leaped the distance. I grabbed the latch and ripped it open. Escaping and falling through the door just before the flood sprawled across me.

\_\_\_\_\_

I looked up, the trapdoor was nowhere to be seen.

I was on the roof of the hospital. 

There were two huge tubes starting from each side of the building, they looked to be clung to it by two massive bandaids. The tubes conjoined and fell behind me to connect to the doorway. I looked at them further, they were carrying wind. 

Behind me something rasped. I turned around, there was a hospital bed accompanied by an armchair, on the bed laid the void figure.  

Its empty form trembled, it was shivering. It was laid flat on its back with its head turned, looking at me. 

Beside it and just a few feet from me was a short sword resting on the ground. Its silver metal stood bright against the darkness.

The message was as clear as the signs, it was the only thing holding me back, this thing needed to die. 

I grasped the sword with my remaining hand and approached the figure, it smelled like damp earth and a dying flame.

I raised the blade above my head and plunged it into its chest.  

Its eyes widened and its body shook for just a second, then it fell limp. 

From my back something glowed, sending yellow rays of light spilling out in front of me.

I turned to find a golden ladder, descending it were the two captors I had faced upon arrival. They met the ground and stood abreast in front of it, preventing me from making a climb of my own. 

“He really never expected you to still be breathing, no one did, but that is just what you’re doing,” he somehow held more animosity as he began for a second time. 

He stepped even closer, just short of being in my face. “You can not act orderly for one moment. You just need to find a way to disrupt all you can. You were successful. You’ve freed yourself from your sin and you’ve slayed your beast, but you reap no reward because- as much as you do it- you can’t even sin properly.” 

He looked away and sighed, “You will never know how lucky you are, none of you will.” 

He looked back at me,  “You get to go back home,” he said in mock enthusiasm, “You get one more chance.”

His face hardened so thoroughly I thought he’d try and punch me in the face, “We both know where it will lead you.”

The floor crumbled beneath my feet. I was sent falling through a vast nothing, a sinking pool of darkness.

\_\_\_\_\_

Haze, haze, so much haze. 

I was in a small room, a respirator had been suctioned to my face.

Beside me, a woman stood in front of an armchair, she was holding my hand.

My vision adjusted, I looked up at her; she was my mother.

She didn’t even look like she wanted to be there. She looked down at me.

She stared for a full second or two before she said anything. To her I was the least interesting thing in the world, until that point I had never seen such a lack of care within someone's eyes. 

At some point she remembered I was her son, her eyes widened a little, “He’s awake, he’s awake!”, she paused, “*You’re* awake.”

Her eyes were empty, leaving an unsettling juxtaposition as they collided with the smile across her lips. I saw my reflection against her dark pupils; even laid weakly across my bed, I still looked rageful.

*We both know where it will lead you,* his voice played in my head and seeing myself made me realize he may be right.

I hated what I was more than I hated the woman standing beside me. I hated that I landed myself here, hated what I did to myself, and above all, I hated that I hate.  

Throughout history, there have been thousands of stories detailing how hateful and self-destructive people have grown easily into a healthy state of mind, but those stories are lies, lies meant to simplify a very complex issue. 

It's been two months since I left the hospital. I still don’t have a very positive opinion of myself, I still think I’m worthless and occasionally I don’t even see much point in living when I am who I am, but I still do so.

I live, I don’t hurt or punish myself no matter how tempting it gets. It’s not worth it, I know where it’ll lead me.

When I began writing this account I didn't do so as a way of preaching some tale of what comes after. I wrote it as a way of warning you just where your hate can send you and just what all it can really do to you.
