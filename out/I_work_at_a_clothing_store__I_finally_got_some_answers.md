I stared at the bill [Jacque gave me last night](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10j6j47/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_i_actually_made_my/) the entire bus ride home. I couldn’t comprehend what this meant. Do our custom clients know about Eleanora? Can they sense her somehow, or better yet, communicate with her? I might have finally found a way to speak with her, and walking into work today, I think she knew. In the stairwell, I felt like the walls were watching me. It wasn’t necessarily threatening, just a feeling I’ve never had before. I paused for a moment, considering an idea I had thought about late last night. I wanted to see if I could simply talk to her.

&#x200B;

“Eleanora?” I whispered, barely loud enough for even me to hear. A chill ran down my spine, and I heard the building creak, as if it was an old house getting hit by wind. I knew this had never happened before, and I felt like she was trying to speak.

&#x200B;

Of course, this moment was quickly ruined, as the door opened and Corey strutted in, barely noticing me before running into me.

&#x200B;

“Oh, good morning Harper!” She looked around, then eyed me suspiciously. “What are you doing just standing in here?”

&#x200B;

“I thought I heard someone walking in, and here you are!” I replied, trying not to sound sarcastic, before quickly turning around and finishing the three story climb.

&#x200B;

It was *supposed* to be just Patrick and me today, but of course, Ms. Corporate still won’t leave. I said a quick hello to him as I clocked in, and he seemed to beam at the sight of Corey. I rolled my eyes, knowing full well why he felt so comfortable and happy around her, but I couldn’t explain that to him. I wasn’t sure what would happen if I told him about what she can do while he’s under her control, but I didn’t want to find out. I simply faked my best smile at them before heading to the floor to open. The appointment board caught my eye on the way out, and I felt my heart skip a beat. This was the perfect opportunity to find out if our custom clients knew about Eleanora, and if they could communicate with her.

&#x200B;

Koro was coming.

&#x200B;

Now listen, I don’t necessarily trust Koro. I’ve worked with him a few times since my first custom fitting, and he’s cool, but I can not get a read on that guy. Maybe it’s the lack of facial features, or the lack of face, but I don’t know if he is fond of me or not. I think he has fully forgiven me for my initial reaction to him, but that doesn’t necessarily mean he will answer any of my questions. Regardless, if anyone is willing to break some rules, it’s Koro. He’s the kind of guy who isn’t afraid of consequences.

&#x200B;

I was lost in my thoughts all day, just waiting for closing time. I didn’t even notice that a client was staring in my face, trying to ‘politely’ ask me if we had any more sizes in the back (we never do, don’t bother asking). Patrick seemed to notice I was distracted, and pulled me aside.

&#x200B;

“Hey, you okay, kid?” He asked, and the sincerity in his voice broke my heart when I noticed the foggy look in his eyes. She had her grips on him, and I didn’t know how to stop it. I wondered if Daniel was the same way, and why Sam wasn’t, but Patrick was growing more concerned the longer I stayed in my thoughts.

&#x200B;

“Yeah, yeah, I’m totally fine. My cat just got sick last night, that’s all. Just a little distracted.”

&#x200B;

He seemed to believe me, and mumbled the classic Patrick half-assed apology before telling me to get it together. I tried to focus, and finally the day ended. I just about sprinted to lock the door before setting up for Koro’s appointment.

&#x200B;

“Alright gang, I’m heading out,” Corey said, giving us both a wave. “I’ll see you tomorrow, Harper!”

&#x200B;

“Actually, I’m off tomorrow,” I said, trying not to rejoice in front of her. She gave me a glare, before repeating herself, more stern this time.

&#x200B;

“I will see you tomorrow, *Harper.*”

&#x200B;

“Okay, see you tomorrow.” I quickly looked away, trying to avoid watching her face melt into that disgusting scowl. Looks like my day off just got canceled. Fantastic.

&#x200B;

I heard the door close behind her, and Patrick looked at me concerned.

&#x200B;

“You’ve been here a lot lately, why don’t you go home early tonight? I’ll handle the appointment.”

&#x200B;

“NO,” I basically shouted, clearly throwing him off guard. “I mean, no, it’s fine, I’m excited to see Koro. Actually, if you’d like, you can go early! I heard you telling a client about a certain big date later, and I know you’d love extra time to prep,” I teased.

&#x200B;

“Just for that, I am going to leave,” he said, trying to put on an angry face, but he was clearly excited. It was good to see some genuine emotion from him, and I hoped some time away would loosen Corey’s grip on him. He came out with his bags, and said, “Are you sure you’re good here alone? I know Koro can be… tricky.”

&#x200B;

I swallowed the knot that had been forming in my throat since this morning. “Nah, he’s a good guy. I’ll be fine, go have some fun!”

&#x200B;

He gave me a quick pat on the back before basically skipping out the door. I wish I could’ve enjoyed that image of him for longer, but I had other things to do. I needed to figure out the best way to slyly ask Koro what he knew without angering him (an almost impossible job in my mind).

&#x200B;

After about thirty minutes of stressing over every possible outcome, I heard the elevator ding. Out walked Koro, wearing a slightly translucent forest green three piece suit with matching top hat, which he set on top of the coat rack as he entered the door.

&#x200B;

“Good evening, sir,” I signed, trying to keep my hands from shaking.

&#x200B;

“Good evening.” He looked around, and signed, “Just us tonight?”

&#x200B;

Feeling fear creeping up my spine, I began to regret telling Patrick to leave. I had never been alone with Koro before, and I quickly realized how fucking stupid I was for doing this.

&#x200B;

“Yes sir, I hope that’s alright.”

&#x200B;

He paused for a moment, and I could feel him studying me. I avoided eye contact, keeping my gaze on his transparent hands instead, and finally, he signed, “I would prefer we do my fitting before you begin your questions, if that’s alright with you.”

&#x200B;

My jaw dropped, and my eyes snapped to his face before I quickly looked away, embarrassed. It seems I’m not as sly as I thought.

&#x200B;

“Yes, of course, sir. I apologize.”

&#x200B;

“No need,” he signed, then took off his jacket and hung it below his hat. “I’m surprised you haven’t asked me sooner. I was beginning to think you were truly stupid.” I flinched at his insult as he walked in front of the mirror, adjusting his vest.

&#x200B;

“My apologies. We can start now if you’d like. What are you looking for today?”

&#x200B;

I got him fitted for a burgundy tuxedo, and a matching bowtie and complimentary pocket square. He opted for a black tuxedo shirt, which I respect, but decided against the black top hat, which I found disappointing. After all was said and done, he sauntered in front of the couch and motioned for me to sit down. I obeyed, and felt like a little kid at school with this creature, my teacher, towering over me. He adjusted his jacket, then signed, “I will warn you, I am only going to answer questions I choose. I’m not going to hold your hand through what is being asked of you. I am simply indebted to your friend, so it is only fair I give you a helping hand on her behalf. You may proceed.”

&#x200B;

I thought carefully before starting.

&#x200B;

“Is your friend Eleanora?” He corrected my fingerspelling (which he often does, and I deeply appreciate) before answering.

&#x200B;

“Yes. That was a stupid question, but you may continue nonetheless.”

&#x200B;

“Why are you indebted to her?”

&#x200B;

“That is none of your concern, girl.” I could tell I upset him, so I tried to quickly move on.

&#x200B;

“How do I help her?”

&#x200B;

“I will not answer that.”

&#x200B;

I felt anger flutter in my stomach, before quickly composing myself. “Who are the voices we hear when we are in her world?”

&#x200B;

“Finally, a good question,” he started, and I had to stop myself from rolling my eyes. “Those are lost souls, people who have been taken prisoner by your company. Employees who were deemed unfit or unable to complete their duties, and were sent to travel the vast ocean of her reality. When she returns home to rest, they take refuge in her walls, finding some peace within.”

&#x200B;

“How many are there?”

&#x200B;

“Too many.”

&#x200B;

I thought about this for a moment, then remembered a question one of you asked in my previous post. “How long has this company existed?”

&#x200B;

“Very good. The owner of this business has existed for longer than even myself, but she did not start this venture until 100 years ago. It started innocently, a being looking to live a life that would be viewed by you humans as productive. She really enjoyed what she did, I believe, until the war. When the economy crashed, this shop was threatened with bankruptcy. She made a decision to start investing in a different demographic; those like me, who seek the fashion of humans, but for pleasure, not necessity. She knew of Eleanora’s sentience by then, and was able to barter an agreement: keep the humans separated from those like me, who may seek to harm them, and she would keep Eleanora clean, organized, and inhabited. Soon after the war, she found herself needing to expand her business, since she could no longer make all of the fabrics and clothing on her own. Now, here we are.”

&#x200B;

I took a moment to process all the information he had just told me, but I could tell he was getting impatient, so I quickly asked, “Who is the owner?”

&#x200B;

“I will not answer that.”

&#x200B;

“Where is the warehouse?”

&#x200B;

“I don’t know the answer to that. I have never been, I have no reason.”

&#x200B;

“Is Corporate a being like you?”

&#x200B;

He paused for a moment. “She is. Not like me, per say, but a being of greater power than you, yes. I would advise you to stay away from her. She does not have anyone’s best interest in mind, least of all Eleanora.”

&#x200B;

“Does Daniel know about Eleanora?”

&#x200B;

“No.”

&#x200B;

I felt relief wash over me. He wasn’t lying to me. Suddenly, I thought of something I hadn’t considered asking. “Is Sam like you?”

&#x200B;

He paused for what felt like an eternity. I thought I had signed it incorrectly and he didn’t understand, so I began again, but he put up his hand for me to stop.

&#x200B;

“I will not be answering that.”

&#x200B;

*Fair enough,* I thought, but quickly moved on, hoping I hadn’t upset him. “Is there any way for me to speak to Eleanora directly?”

&#x200B;

“Very good. You can, but only while she’s in her natural habitat. You must wait until the next visit, and when you hear the voices, you must go to them. You will find her in a form you can comprehend. Be warned, it may be hard to find your way back, and Eleanora waits for no one. Do not get lost.”

&#x200B;

With that, he walked over to the coat rack and placed his top hat on his head. “You now have all the information you need. Do not ask me these questions again. If I am asked, I will deny having given you any information. Good evening.” He tipped his hat to me, and left.

&#x200B;

I stayed there for a long time, thinking about everything he had said. It was too much to process. I don’t know where my head is at right now, but two things are for sure - I need to learn more about the warehouse, and I need to be there during the next trip to the other side.
