I gulped nervously, "O-kay."

I closed my eyes again and stifled tears. I was so scared, it was all I could do to stop myself from shaking.

Just then I felt something flash before my eyes and suddenly I was in my room again when he was missing, except this time, I could see him in the shadows, lurking.

He was transparent, he was watching me. When he realized I could see him and we made eye contact, he lifted his hand and I flew into the air. He flitted his hand about and my body jerked around to wherever his hand directed.

I felt like I couldn't breathe and stared at him like a deer in headlights. Before I could process what was happening, he abruptly threw me against the wall.

“Ouch! Fuck!”

I rubbed my head where it hit the wall as he sauntered over to me with a shit-eating grin on his face.

He didn't speak but started to stroke my chin for a long moment, eventually lifting it toward his face. “You're very cute in this position. What a shame it isn't real.”

I looked at him incredulously. “‘Isn't real?’ What the hell are you talking about?”

He said nothing but looked at me expectantly. As if I did know what he was talking about and as if he were testing me. Was this a test?

I felt myself sweating, I didn't know what to say. I didn't want to experience the consequences of failing whatever test he was giving me but I was truly baffled. 

“That's a shame, you couldn't guess.” He exaggeratedly shook his head and clicked his tongue in a condescending manner.

“Tell me, how do you know I'm not making you hallucinate all of this? Are you entirely sure of the reality you're experiencing?”

My jaw fell, mouth agape. I didn't know what to say.

He sighed. “I'm fucking your brain so utterly and completely and you can’t even tell. I feel a little insulted that you don't appreciate my handiwork.”

I glared at him, furious but still in shock. What on earth was I supposed to say to that?

“How sad that you didn't provide me with more of a challenge, I assumed you were stronger-willed than that.”

My eyebrows knit together in frustration, “What the hell are you talking about?”

He laughed, “Look at your fingers. Tell me, how do they look?”

I began breathing heavily and then found myself at the dinner table once again. What just happened? A hallucination? It… wasn't real. 

I looked from the table to him and then down at my fingers. The singeing that I saw earlier was gone. 

“No, no, no! This can’t be happening!” I clenched my fist and tried to regain my composure. 

How could he do that? Was he making all the “punishments” elaborate hallucinations in my head?

He hummed in response to my distress, trying to provoke me. 

I refused to take the bait and again, we fell into silence. 

He barely touched his food but seemed encouraged that I had almost finished my plate.

"Do you like it?"

I nodded and stuffed my face as normally as I could manage. I just wanted this to be over.

After I finished eating, I started fidgeting nervously. The ‘atmosphere,’ as he called it, was dark and tense. As much as I hated to admit it, mom had been right all along.

I was petrified to say what I was thinking, but I was going to put up a fight, I was not weak. 

“Please tell me what you have planned with me. I cannot stand it any longer."

Dr. Moskowitz gave a small smile, “Of course."

He paused.

"You're to stay with me here, forever." 

He eyed my panicked face, "Relax."

And to my horror, I felt immediately calm. 

"As I said, I'm not going to hurt you, I am true to my word."

He was speaking slowly and deliberately as though I could only soak up small bits of information at a time. I was starting to feel crazy.

"I am going to give you a gift."

"A gift?"

"Yes."

I felt my stomach drop. 

"Are you finished eating?"

"Yes," I said, perhaps too quickly.

"Clear your plate and then come to my room. We will continue this conversation there."

I watched as he ascended the stairs to his room and then cleaned my plate. I paced around the kitchen and covered my face to stifle tears. I wanted to scream, I was so fucking scared.

I steadied myself and ran into my room. 

My eyes immediately darted to the sticky notes pad. I grabbed the pen beside it and slipped it into my back pocket. I had to have some method of defending myself, no matter how feeble.

I paused for a moment, remembering that this was the pen that made me bleed. Perhaps it wasn’t a useless weapon after all.

Either way, I had to try something. I was not oblivious or passive. He would eat his words.

I checked the recording device in my front pocket, and thankfully, it was still recording. If I made it out of this alive, at least I had evidence of everything that happened. 

I wasn't crazy, there were parts of my mind Dr. Moskowitz couldn't touch and the world was going to know exactly who and what he was.

"Are you coming?" He called from the other room.

"Yes," I said tepidly, "I'm coming."

I walked up the stairs slowly, trying not to think of all the horrible things he could do to me, and frowned as I faced the door. I opened it and saw him sitting on the bed.

He eyed me and gestured for me to sit down beside him. I sat about a foot away from him on the bed. He stared at the distance between us and laughed, proceeding to scoot closer.

He rubbed my shoulder reassuringly, "I promise, you're going to be okay. Okay?"

"Okay."

"Alright then." He gripped his knees and exhaled. "Will you… accept my gift?"

"Huh?"

"My gift, will you accept it?"

I was starting to feel the panic rise in me but I knew this was another test.

I closed my eyes and inhaled sharply. "Yes. Yes, I will accept your gift."

There was a brief, silent pause.

I took the opportunity to grab the pen and stabbed him, right in the heart.
