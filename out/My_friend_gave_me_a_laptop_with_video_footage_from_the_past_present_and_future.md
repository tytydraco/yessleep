I have a good friend named Jessica, who I've known since high school. She was very enthusiastic about all the media she liked, being able to talk about any of it for hours on end.


One day, her interests changed. She went from talking about movies and music to astral projection, quantum immortality, and premonition through meditation. She told me she thought she could see the future by closing her eyes, then imagining a mental circle representing the idea that one couldn't see the future. According to her, the circle had a free space in the center. She would put most of her focus on the circle, so she could see the future through the space. None of it made sense to me, and it kinda came as a surprise, but I let her air it out. She was pretty enthusiastic about these concepts, and it was normal to switch topics.


After talking about her new obsessions for about a week, she stopped talking to me. She wouldn't answer my messages, I no longer even saw a single ‘seen’ receipt under any of them. She wouldn't even answer my phone calls either. I went through two years of anxiety attacks with some sleepless nights here and there. Was she okay? Did I do something shitty without realizing? She was the only friend I had, as I was a bit of a loner with no more avenues to make friends. The biggest downside of her ditching me was me not having anybody to talk to about my daily stresses or anxieties.


Some hours ago, there was a knock at my front door. Upon answering it, there was a dark gray laptop sitting on my doorstep. There was a note taped to it. This is what it read:


“Hello, Heather. I have no time to address the past couple of months. I wanted to look for something interesting and I can say for sure I found it. Sorry if you felt abandoned, especially with how much of a loner I know you are. I am giving you this laptop to warn you about what is to come, so you can prepare and be safe. There are a bunch of video files on there. Watching the videos will give you a small taste of what's to come and what I've discovered. I'll be happy to go into more detail in about a month. Also, do not put anything else on this computer.”


I brought the computer inside, expecting there to be some videos by untrustworthy psychics, or guys in robes speaking nonsense. Jessica wasn't like that though. She always called those people out. I set the computer down on my coffee table, then booted it up. There was one icon on the home screen. A folder. The folder's name was a bunch of numbers: 5181195


I double clicked the folder, then a list of files popped up. Each of them had a calendar date as their title. I double-clicked the first file, July_26_2000.mp4. A grainy view of a cornfield began to play. The camera operator zoomed in, then out as a woman spoke in a bold tone.


“There. We're here. What do you want me to look at?”


The camera was turned to film a taller man with dark hair and a tank top. He looked like he was in his 30s. He spoke with a shaky tone.


“I just need you to look. Don't stop looking.”


“At what?”


“The field! There's-”


The woman gasped. The camera was turned to the field, but shook and fell into the grass. Painful screams erupted from off-camera. They sent chills far down my spine. What was happening? Was I watching a video of two people's last moments?


Something dark and round hovered around within the nearby patch of corn stalks. It made a sudden jolt to the right, making my stomach sink. The thing hovered off camera, then the screaming got more intense. The video ended. All I could do was sit still and wonder what any of that meant. What was that thing hovering around in the field? What did it do that made those people scream?


The next file had October_10_2001.mp4 as its title. Upon opening the file, the footage began to play. This footage was grainier. It began in your average small living room. A lamp provided a little bit of light to the room, until someone off-screen switched the lamp off. The room went dark, then a beautiful transparent orange and yellow orb formed in the center of the room, emitting a dim glow. It was calming to look at. A welcome change from the previous video.


The next video was July_15_2002.mp4. Dozens of horses gathered around in a circle on an open field of green grass. They stared at the area of grass in front of them as if something was there, then the grass flattened. Like an invisible force punched down on it. The horses took a couple steps back, then, seconds later, they hurried away. Some ran in circles. It was an odd video. Nothing much to understand, but seeing a bunch of horses looking genuinely terrified still set off an alarm. Something happened, but I don't know what.


The videos that came after had a similar inexplicably weird tone. Some showed phantom orbs of light. Others showed people and animals running from invisible forces flattening and pushing things. Why did my friend want me to watch these? Despite how confusing, and at times somewhat silly, these videos were, I grabbed a USB stick and copied the files from the computer onto it. I lost a year's worth of photos last September, and I wasn't going to let that happen again. Every time I receive videos from someone I care about, I back them up, then put them on a USB I lock away in a box.


Anyway, I made it to a file titled January_30_2016.mp4 when I looked at the time. 1 AM. This was the first technical interaction I had with Jessica in a long time. I also wanted to know what she wanted me to prepare for. With that, I decided to stay up for another hour.


The 2016 footage began with a young boy, probably around the age of 10, red-faced and bawling his eyes out on a couch. He screamed.


“Get it out!”


A ball was held up to the kid's nose. Then, a long thin insect with long legs began to crawl out of the boy's left nostril. Chills ran all over me. They got worse as the insect seemed to have no end. More of it kept crawling out of the boy's nose as the boy shut his eyes and continued to scream. Even when the insect reached the floor, it still hadn't left the boy's nose. I wanted to look away. I was terrified of insects and what they could do to the inside of one's body… and this was most definitely not an exception… but my curiosity got the best of me. The ball was placed on the floor, then the insect wrapped itself around it. Even when it had covered the ball, it still hadn't left the boy's nose. If I saw that thing myself, I wouldn't know what to do with it. An image popped up, showing a similar long insect on a kitchen floor. It managed to cover half of the floor. I gagged. The video ended without showing the insect completely leaving the boy. Not that I wanted to see any more of it.


There was a loud banging on my front door. When I answered it, a middle aged male police officer stood at my doorstep. He asked me if I had received a new laptop. I told him yes. He then asked me if the laptop had a file containing inexplicably weird videos. I told him yes. He then asked if he could see them. I offered to show him, then ran downstairs, grabbed the laptop, and carried it up to him. Hopefully this man had answers about Jessica. Watching one of the videos, the officer's eyes widened. He took out a phone and started texting. Some seconds later, he slid his phone back into his pocket. He grabbed his radio, then held it up to his face.


"This is the one. Move in."


I leaned out of my door and watched as he walked off down my gravel driveway. Before I could utter a single word, a team of people in dark tactical gear marched around the corner. Once they reached me, three of them grabbed me by the shoulders. I was gripped by the arms as well. A woman’s voice ordered the agents to search for any reproduction or notes taken of the footage, and so a dozen of the agents stormed inside. I was padded down, even scanned, then I was held tight with rifles aimed straight at my face. My legs were trembling. What in the hell was going on? Who were these agents? What did they want with the videos?


Out of the corner of my left eye, I saw a woman with dark hair wearing a suit. She walked up to me, then gave me a deep stare before speaking.


“Tell me your name.”


“Heather Wilson.”


“We traced a personal computer containing footage you're not authorized to view. Can you tell us where you obtained it?”


“It was given to me by my friend, Jessica Rowan. We've known each other since high school.”


The agent pressed on until giving me an NDA to sign. An hour later, the team left. I had looked for labels and agency logos, but there were none. These guys were unmarked. I shut my door, then locked it. I was almost limping as I walked back to my living room, wondering what the hell just happened. I removed the rug, lifted the carpet, grabbed the box, then opened it up. To my relief, the USB stick was still sitting there.


What was there that I wasn't allowed to see? I plugged the USB into my laptop and the files loaded up. As I scrolled through the files, I noticed the file names had dates post-dating April 2024. The last file had 2026 in its title. I dread finding out something terrifying I cannot prevent will happen to me. Although, maybe it will be something I can prevent. Or maybe my friend got a hold of some test videos she wasn't supposed to see.


(Nevermind. As I wrote that sentence, I saw what I thought was a centipede crawling out from under my couch. My heart sank, but what made it worse was that the thing was too long. It kept crawling out from under the couch, then, at one point, it turned to me, then sped at me. My guts sank, then I sprinted around then away from it. That thing isn't crawling inside me and causing a mess with my organs. I hid in the bathroom, and eventually fell asleep. Then I woke up to the fucking thing digging into my nose. My head was tingling too. The pit in my stomach was like an electric shock. I grabbed the insect, then I pulled it, attempting to yank it out. Big mistake. I went lightheaded, then woke up on the bathroom floor with a tingling all over my head and the constant feeling I'm about to vomit. I called my doctor. I have no idea what this insect is or what it's going to do to me. Honest to god, I hope this won't have any long lasting effects. I need to watch those videos. Fuck, I wish Jessica would answer my messages again.)
