ok this happened around April 2023 literally the week after Queen Elizabeth II had died. My great grandpa was around 90ish when he passed. We knew he did not have much time left, as the poor old man was practically blind and deaf. He had memory issues as the last time I saw him he thought I was my mom. He was still strong and could walk on his own, but we knew his time on earth was coming to an end. He had 6 children I believe, (my family is too big for me to remember) and he lived in a rural town in mexico, where my mom's family is from. He was born there and he died there, I don't even think this man went to go see the city of mexico while he was alive, he was a farmer, and worked for his family. Don't get me wrong he was an ass but we all loved him anyways. A little bit of family drama, for context: after my great grandma died he made his will and left everyone but two of his children land. One being my grandma and the other being her baby brother. Why? I honestly dk, 

( I think it was bc my grandmas sister wanted everything; and she got everything while her other siblings got barely any land, and she has something against my grandma. As for her brother he's gay ( The Machismo in latin america is tough, and i'm telling you he was an ass but even so; his children forgave, but we never forgot how he humiliate my grandma.) The deal was that since his daughter got mostly everything, she would take care of him when he died. Well, the poor man got some karma, bc his daughter was shit at taking care of him, and we knew she just wanted him to die so she could get the inheritance. 

He would go to and ask my grandma for food and even asked if he could just stay with her, as he didnt want to be with her sister anymore since she doesn't take care of him. She never refused to feed him, or offer him a drink but she also never forget how he treated her that day ( i won't go into detail but there was resentment), also there would be drama with her sister; and she didn't want that so she refused but would tell him he could come the next day to eat if he wanted. Well, then came the day when he got sick. He was sick for days, my grandmother's sister and her daughters would "take care of him"; or so they say they did, but his health deteriorated and he eventually died. We were all sad but he was finally resting and that brought us peace... at least my grandmas side.

 In Mexico there is usually a 9 day mourning period where we have rosaries, and just remember the life of the deceased then we bury him. All went well, until the ninth day of the rosary. After the ceremony, every one of his kids said goodbye, my grandma said she just wished him well, and asked him to greet her mom on the other side, then she sat down, Then came her sisters turn, she and her daughters were crying and wailing, when all of sudden there was silence.... and then screams.
Everybody rushed towards my grandma's sister and her daughters and they just kept screaming and crying pointing to the coffin. 

I was not at the funeral I live in LA and finals was coming up so we missed it but my grandma told me that 9 days he had laid in his coffin eyes closed, he looked like he was sleeping, but they checked and there he was laying unmoved with his eyes WIDE OPEN. I thought there was no way! but yep many family members and family friends confirmed it. In rural parts of mexico especially in indigenous communities, we all grow up with certain beliefs and traditions. Well many elders believe that this was my great grandpa's way of saying: my daughter basically killed me. We had heard rumors that my grandmas sister didn't feed him and refused to bathe him after he grew weak etc, not keeping her promise basically. Many believe that she refused to care for him when he got sick so he could die and she gets the inheritance. I jokingly said what if he wasn't dead, I even tried to search it up but from what I can tell it can happen according to google. 


IDK but I firmly believe she didn't "take care of him " on purpose, and she has a guilty conscious. Anyways yep he opened his eyes, then the coffin was closed and he was buried. The doctor was called to make sure he was dead, he confirmed it and he was buried.

When I say the old man was an ass; he really was, and he was petty. Many believe my great
