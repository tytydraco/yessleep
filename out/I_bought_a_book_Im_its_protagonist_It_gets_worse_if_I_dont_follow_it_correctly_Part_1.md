I know, this title is surreal, but, it's as self-explanatory as it can be. Usually, people would feel proud or happy to know that, in a book, story or a short; they are part of it. But, in my case, I want this nightmare to be over.

I am no older than 20 years old, I love so much the literature. Even though I have some gramatical errors and issues with the language, I still can enjoy a good piece of art written in a paper or a website.

Last month, I went to a book festival at the center of the town, yes, like a kid inside a candy shop, eh? I went here and there finding good books and buying them. But then, one book caught my attention. There was an auction for classic books, that included the Christmas Carol 1st edition, a diamond in front of my eyes.

Of course I tried to get it, but it was useless, it was so expensive and, even though I've got money, I couldn't reach to pay so much for it. So there I was, watching good books finding their new owners. After a few introductions, one book was placed. It wasn't titled, it was just a book with scrapped cover and a symbol that looked like a stickman, yes, those things kids use to draw, the guy with the circled head and the torso and limbs of lines.

That was the last entrance, and the auction said it costed $50. Everyone this time didn't even think in offer anything, so, I raised my pallet and offer. "$55!". The man in the auction mentions the book is a masterpiece that only a fan of reading would enjoy. Countdown, and the book was all mine. After getting the book on my hands, I inspected it, the cover was made of leather, the corner of the papers were gold and scratchy, hate to say it, but it cut my finger.

I decided to not open the book there, full of people smoking and coffing would damage my new treasure.

After some hours, I reached my house, took a nice dinner, a bath and a play on my console till it was midnight, perfect time for a read without the noise of my parents at home. The book was just sitting there on my bed, ready for me to read it.

I opened the book, and I can see the book is really old, pages were degraded and stained with any liquid. But, "no wonders, surely the previous owner gave such an awful treatment to this poor book" that's what I said while shrugging. The first three pages were totally blank, or at least, that's what it looked like, not even a light under the page could reveal a word or any ink mark. But, the first title laid at the fourth page.

"Chapter 1 - The Brave Warrior"

Fancy title in my opinion, I covered myself with the blanket and started reading it.

"Once upon a time, a young adult, enjoying of the wonders of the life, assisting the college to become great in the future. Till one day, one of the students decided to surround the brave warrior and punch him with fierce and hate, but the brave warrior stood up and fought back with a victorious screech"

Kind of cool in my opinion, but the letters are quite big for the page, literally, this whole paragraph covers it all. I tried to pass to the next page but the papers were sticky, as in, something between the pages prevent for them to flip. "Aw well, I guess I can do this for later" I thought.

Closed the book and took a sleep. At the next day, it was a normal day at college, class after another, getting good grades. But there was this feeling, don't know why, but I had the urge to looks behind or on the sides, as in, I feel something looking at me. Weird.

Last class finished and I was walking to the cafeteria to get something to eat, but suddenly one guy pushed me to the ground, and punch me in the side or my head. The only I could do is covering my face. Why is it that nobody is trying to stop him!? I screamed for help, I needed help, but nobody even tried to get close.

After a time, the guy just gave me a last kick on my stomach and I cofed my breath out. "What the hell is your problem!?" I yelled.

After standing up all by myself, I lost my appetite and walked to my bicycle, as best as I could, I went to my home and let myself fall on my bed. The book, that was lying there also on my bed, bounced and fall on my back. I felt it, and took it. Yes, I remembered, I took my lighter and opened the book to the first chapter and put the flame right in front of the pages, I gotta dry whatever it was between pages. It would take a time, but while I was with it, I noticed the page was weird.

Have you ever memorized so much a context that, if something changes, you notice it but you cannot point it with the finger? Well, this was it, I felt the text was different, and I re-read again.

"Once upon a time, a young adult, enjoying of the wonders of the life, assisting the college to become great in the future. Till one day, one of the students decided to surround the brave warrior and punch him with fierce and hate, friends of the bully arriving and making the brave warrior suffer with more intensity, but the brave warrior stood up and fought back with a victorious screech".

My lighter turned off, my eyes were wide open passing over the text and my body started to shake. "This can't be true! That part wasn't there in the last time I read it!" I dropped the book to the pillow and my breathing was hard and confused. "This can be only a coincidence." was the quote I tried to repeat till convince myself, but my head repeat over and over again that "what would you do if this happens again tomorrow?".

Nothing to be done for now... but skipping classes tomorrow wasn't an option.

Next day, I was in class, but this time, I was more than nervous, I couldn't pay attention for more than 5 minutes before looking everywhere looking for the guy. But, nothing at all. Classes finished and I tried to run quickly to my bicycle, but, once again, as fast as the first time, I was help by the back of my shirt and pulled to down, now I can visualize like 3 guys before they started to punch me. It repeated once again, I was screaming, I was yelling for help, but it simply won't happen. Nobody came to help me.

After some minutes of intense pain, they just left me there on the ground, my tooth was broken and I was coffing blood. I had to go to the medical room of the college and the nurse put some alcohol on my body, a cream for the bruises, and recommended me to go to the dentist. I told her about the people who punched me, and she quickly wrote the report and took me to the principal office and personally see him mentioning to take actions... but how much time that would make effect...

The principal paid me a UBER and I went home with my bicycle at the college's garage. I dropped myself on the hall's sofa, my body was hurt and my brain was spinning with so many thoughts at same time. "This isn't a mere coincidence..." I thought, but as soon as I wanted to relax, I opened my eyes wide again, stood up, ran to my room and open the book again... just what I was afraid of...

"Once upon a time, a young adult, enjoying of the wonders of the life, assisting the college to become great in the future. Till one day, one of the students decided to surround the brave warrior and punch him with fierce and hate, the principal was useless for this, the bully and his friends knew the poor try of the warrior to save himself on the easy way; so, they prepared something worse for next day, but the brave warrior stood up and fought back with a victorious screech".

The book... this time... recorded just what I did today... the principal would not save me... so... The only thing I can do is... wait for them to punch me to death... Couldn't help myself... I screamed. Distraughted. Scared. Panicked. Everything was a noise into my brain! My mother ran into my house and tried to calm me but I was just lost into my thoughts. She tried and tried until, after I lost my breath, I finally realized she was hugging me, so I tried to think straight and breath, but I simply didn't know what to do.

What could I tell mom!? "This book I bought at the last sunday has a story that transform my life into a terrible adventure I must live against my will, and everyday it becomes worse than ever"? I rather she think I'm crazy for my sudden screaming than for thinking that a book has an effect in my life.

After I told her that I was having issues at school, not specifying what exactly, my mom told me that she'd do my favorite food so I can calm myself while tasting the nectar. But in the moment that she was gone. I just looked at the book again. I won't let them hurt me!

Next day, I had everything prepared, but my nerves were killing me, this time, the voice of the teacher became a cruel high-pitched static, while on my surroundings was a bunch of people with repulsive smirks on their faces.

The bell rang, I walked to the garage of the college for my bicycle... That place was lonely, so... this time, I knew they were coming... I could hear their steps... Opened the door, and right next of the door from inside the garage, I left my father's baseball bat, grabbed it as fast as could and swinged all I could, sometimes I hit, sometimes I didn't. My eyes were closed shut, my instinct was weak and after some hits and loud "Clanks". I opened my eyes. The three guys were on the floor, not moving, like some kind of dolls, some blood on the floor coming from their mouths or noses...

Panting from the horror, I screamed of such horrifying scene I just provoked, more after see that I was holding the baseball bat as a weapon. Hop on my bicycle and rode as fast as could back to home. Ran to my room and lock myself in, the baseball bat bounced on the floor and I sat against my door and scratching my head, sobbing and scared of what I just did.

But... like a heartbeat... I remembered the book... I looked at it with my red-teary eyes and slowly opened the book. The chapter 1 stood the same, except... my signature appeared at the bottom right of the page.

It's over... But... as soon as I sat, the page flipped, as in, that sticky thing was long gone, and my eyes caught the next title:

"Chapter 2 - The Victorious Warrior"
