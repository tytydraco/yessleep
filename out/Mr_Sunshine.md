I used to work for the FBI. I did my share of drug busts and tracking organized crime, but I’ve only hunted one serial killer. In the early 2000s, my team and I were assigned to hunt down the serial killer known as Mr. Sunshine. As is the case with many serial killers, he gained the nickname through his M.O. 

His victims—fifteen that we know of—were always found in locations facing the East and at times when they would be discovered at sunrise, and based on the reports from the coroners, they were all killed at dawn, just minutes before the sun would come up. They were all found with their faces forced into smiles. It wasn't that he had mutilated them to create the smile; they had been found with their throats cut. 

Their smiles, though, had been determined to have been the result of the muscles in their faces somehow pulling their lips back into a forced grin that stretched literally from ear to ear, to the point that their lips had torn like rags. 

This would be odd enough, but unlike most serial killers, he had witnesses on multiple occasions, but when it came to describing his face, all they would ever say was that he smiled. Naturally, we considered the possibility that perhaps we were dealing with multiple killers, or that Mr. Sunshine was drugging the witnesses somehow. What was even stranger, though, was the fact that the victims had no apparent connection, nothing to connect an M.O. to. They were seemingly picked at random. Furthermore, their bodies all vanished at numerous points, even with an increase in security. 

My team—Agents Langstrom, Prescott, Martinez, Kilpatrick, Rosencoff, and myself—had received a tip that Mr. Sunshine had been sighted in an abandoned warehouse. By this point, he had claimed the lives of eight people, and we were getting desperate. So after getting the proper clearance, we entered the building, guns drawn, intending to arrest or put down this creep. The second we entered, we heard it: the echoed laughter. We didn't turn on our flashlights, as the lights inside were on despite the electricity being cut off two years prior, something Kilpatrick confirmed.

He took Langstrom first. 

We had only traveled a few paces in and were getting used to the light when it suddenly flashed off, like someone had flicked a light switch, then immediately turned it back on. It disoriented us at first, and even before I looked around, I sensed something in our footsteps, or more accurately, the absence of one pair. We turned and there was no sign of Langstrom anywhere. No blood, no noise—he was just gone.

 We began getting worried, reporting back to HQ of our situation. We were told to proceed with caution. HQ then told us to begin investigating separate parts of the warehouse, two agents to search for our missing comrade as well as potential victims/survivors and the remaining three to continue our sweep for Mr. Sunshine. 

As Kilpatrick and Rosencoff broke off from the main group, we continued traversing the warehouse. Martinez noticed it after we’d traversed a quarter of the warehouse. She looked from the back to the front, then pointed it out to us pale-faced. 

We hadn’t moved further than twelve feet from warehouse’s entrance, where Langstrom had been taken. 

As we noticed it too, we heard Rosencoff begin to give his report, before stopping. “Wha—” His radio cut out, and the light flashed again. We kept trying to call him, and at one point, Prescott, a close friend of Rosencoff, yelled out for him. Our radios broadcast the same deranged laughter we had heard before. Then the light flashed again, and we quickly did a headcount. Martinez, Prescott, and myself were still there. That meant…

We began calling frantically for Kilpatrick, to no avail. We radioed to HQ for orders. We received nothing but dead air. At least, so it seemed until a man’s voice giggled childishly.

Our professionalism left us then. We began screaming into the warehouse, demanding that Mr. Sunshine show himself. Whenever we heard laughter in any given direction, we would begin firing at it. Then the lights flashed twice. I kept my eyes shut, expecting to be taken like the others. But as I opened my eyes, I saw that I was still standing in the dusty, bright warehouse. Instead of relief, I felt my stomach drop, and any bravado I had left evaporated. I didn't need to turn around—I felt the absence of Prescott and Martinez. 

It was resignation rather than courage or hope that drove me onward. I wasn't holding out hope that I might be able to save my teammates; I just moved forward, going through the motions. Somehow, I managed to push through the oppressive light, and that was when I saw him on a catwalk above me. 

Mr. Sunshine was dressed in an immaculately white two-piece suit with a red button-up shirt and a pair of red gloves, as well as impossibly shiny black shoes. On the lapel of his jacket was an ornate pin of something I couldn't identify. And his face was hidden in the light, except for his toothy, equally shiny grin. I made my way up the metal stairs, aiming my gun at him and telling him to get on the ground. 

Then he raised his hand, and the light dimmed just a little. But it was just enough. Enough for me to take in the horror of what he had done. I understand now what the witnesses meant when they said they couldn't place any distinct features—they probably had their memories locked away from the horror.

Above him hung my team, along with the other fifteen. They were suspended in midair, held aloft by this unholy light in various positions. Except I realized that it wasn't just their bodies he was keeping; it was *them.* Their souls, their energy—he was keeping *them*, feeding on them. Like how a spider saves its prey wrapped in silk, so too was he holding them wrapped in these infernal rays. And even now, they gazed down vacantly, forced smiles on their faces and tears running from their eyes. 

Not knowing what else to do, I aimed my handgun at Mr. Sunshine and unloaded each round into him, tears of grief, rage, and terror running down my own face. The bullets struck him, and blood began staining his suit. He staggered back, his smile turning into a pained grimace, and in an instant he was inches in front of me, his gloved hand around my throat, lifting me up. I heard vicious words in my head, saying that I didn’t belong up there yet. 

He told me that if I knew the truth about my team, I would understand why they were up there, and why the other victims were as well. He threw me off the catwalk, resulting in a broken leg. Just like that, the light vanished, and he along with his victims were gone. The radio came back to life, with HQ frantically demanding a status report. 

I was unable to provide a plausible explanation as to how my team had vanished without a trace, or why our radios had suddenly stopped working properly. It wasn't as if they had been turned off; they were receiving signals. But all HQ heard from my team was laughter. *Their* laughter. I was cleared of suspicion; there was simply no evidence pointing to me. 

I resigned after my leg had healed up. The trauma of losing my team coupled with what I had witnessed was too much for me. In the years following the incident, I often wondered what he was talking about, what the victims possessed that made them desirable to Mr. Sunshine, and what I lacked. I studied up and down, looking in obscure places for knowledge on the occult that might tell me who or what Mr. Sunshine was. Then I received an unmarked envelope this morning. Inside was a letter addressed to me.

*Dear Sir, 
I hope you’re doing well. I understand our last meeting was brief, and we had little time to spare. I’m sure you’ve had questions aplenty about why I let you go. The simplest answer was that you were to me what a minnow is to a fisherman, or a fawn to a big-game hunter. Your team and my previous smilers all had something I wanted: pain.*

*I suppose Kilpatrick never told you about the time his four-year-old brother was swept away by a river current when he was six despite his best efforts to save him, and how it had happened after they got into a childish argument that caused the brother to slip, or how Martinez accidentally shot her father thinking he was a burglar as he drunkenly stumbled back into her home when she was nine. And don’t get me started on how Prescott left his son unattended in a supermarket for a total of ten seconds, only for the boy to vanish. The others all had similar issues.*

*You, though? You were remarkably ordinary. Disappointingly ordinary. Oh, you had the odd death in the family here, a failed relationship there, but nothing that truly haunted you. But then you met me. I’ve consumed your thoughts like rabies to the nervous system, corrupting every thought you’ve had. You barely smile, if ever, because it makes you think of me. You never leave your home because you know I’m out here. And I’ll show my hand here: you surprised me.*

*Before then, I had been confident that you would be too consumed with terror and awe to pull the trigger. Perhaps I had grown too arrogant. In any case, perhaps a little reunion is in order. The anniversary is coming up, after all. Why not meet us at the same place? You can decline if you wish, but it would be wonderful to see you again. And who knows? Maybe you can do what you tried to do the first time. Or maybe not. You never know until you try. 
Regards,
Mr. Sunshine.*

The handgun I’ve kept in my home has been sitting on the coffee table in front of me for hours, along with several mags, the letter, files on Mr. Sunshine, and a picture of my team and I. 

I don't know what to do. I want to move on with my life, leave Mr. Sunshine in the dust, but at the same time, I want to finally close the book on this. If I could make him bleed once, I can do it again. I just don't know. 

Something happened a few minutes ago that may be tipping my indecision, however. The broken radio I kept unbeknownst to the Bureau crackled to life, and I heard laughter on the other end. 

Laughter from Martinez, Kilpatrick, Rosencoff, Prescott, Langstrom, and Mr. Sunshine.
