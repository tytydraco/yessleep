When I was a kid, my father had a friend I had to call Uncle Ben. He stayed over way too often. Back then, I had no idea why this old man had to stay at a friend’s house so frequently. To this day, I have no clue why Dad even kept him around.

Uncle Ben used to sneak up into my room at night a lot, as if he were some nocturnal predator.

*As if… I say – how ironic.*

He’d get in my bed, saying he was cold and needed to warm him up. Being a little kid, I didn’t know any better. The bastard told me to keep it a secret, or else a dire wolf would snatch me and drag me away into the forest, far away from my parents.

Ben had something convincing about him, at least until I started grasping what he was doing to me. By then, he had manipulated me using my shame and feelings of inadequacy against me. His games continued until the day he died.

On that day, I tried to resist. That left me a bloody mess.

*Brutalized.*

*Humiliated.*

*Violated.*

He had his way with me and went back to sleep, and I was left curled up in a fetal position at the edge of the room. Crying myself to sleep, only to be haunted by nightmares of a pitch-black and dire wolf emerging from the darkness at the edge of my bed and dragging me into the wilderness.

The sound of claws scraping against the floorboards kept penetrating my consciousness until I woke up to a scream.

*Hysterical and on the verge of choking.*

I screamed so hard in my nightmare that it woke me up. Ben’s tearful, and for once powerless gaze locked onto mine. His face, half buried in a pillow. A shadow repeatedly pressed him into the bed as he sulked and gasped for air.

He cried through his bloodied mouth, practically whispering

*Help me!*

It was barely audible, but whatever was on top of him heard his plea loud and clear. I distinctly remember a pair of jaws emerging to clamp on Ben’s shoulder. I saw the pain in his eyes for a fraction of a second before his face vanished into the pillow. Blood splashed on my face, and I instinctively covered up.

Shaking with fear, I could only listen to the cacophony of horrendous sounds in that room.

*Muffled screaming*

*Squeaking bed*

*Wet tearing*

*Sickening pops and cracks*

*And finally –*

*Deafening silence*

When I gathered the courage to open, Ben wasn’t there anymore. There was only a mess of exposed bone and flesh. Guts crudely pulled out from between spread legs. Leftovers from a feast conducted by wild beasts.

I wanted to throw up, but my body stopped itself when I caught *him* staring at me, wearing Ben’s face, from the edge of the door. Covered in gore, he flashed me a horrible smile.

Scraps of meat still hanging between his crimson-colored and inhuman teeth.

Something feral gleamed in his crazed eyes

*Something predatory*

Before I could even register anything, the wild man was crouching over me. His presence alone felt like it could suffocate me if he wanted it to. Nothing but hunger burned in those bestial eyes. His face seemed inhumanly long.

And with the unmistakable stench of rotten flesh, he snarled at me, only to laugh when I winced.  

I thought I was going to be next – just like Ben.

I begged him, with tears running down my cheeks, not to eat me, but the beast man ignored my pleas, merely placing a finger over his lips.

*Don’t tell your parents, or you’ll anger the dire wolf*

He instructed, mimicking Ben’s voice almost perfectly, before standing up again and walking toward the door. Once he moved from my sight, I was stuck staring at Uncle Ben’s mangled entrails with only the sound of dog claws scrapping against the floorboards echoing in the distance.

I stayed like that until the next morning, when Mum came to wake *us* up. My thoughts were so deep in the recollection of the night’s events that I barely even noticed her screaming at the top of her lungs.

I never told them what truly happened that night, even though they gave me more than enough reasons to tell them everything and *piss off the dire wolf.*

Every time they’ve mourned their *good friend* or lamented me being such a *weak and broken shell of a man* whenever they thought I couldn’t hear them.

Some days, I wonder, what will he do if I tell them the truth; will he devour them just further torment me, or will he decide that I have to die this time?

The only reason I can’t bring myself to do it is because I genuinely can’t tell which outcome is better...
