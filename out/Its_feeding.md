My family and I went to my grandma for the weekend. But something was off. She's not the same. Mostly her face. Its unsetting. The whole environment is unsettling. My parents, my brother. It seems like they haven't noticed. Its only me. I tried to hide it and I successfully did in the first day. The second day it was more off. Her eyes were different. They were dark as the void of space. Pure emptiness. And in the center a bright white dot. Like the light that you want to see in the end of the tunnel.  
  
The day passed but my brother was nowhere to be seen. And my parents ignored it. Like they were hypnotized. I went to sleep and I woke up to a scratching noise around 2 am. It saw me. It became aware of me. It knows I'm here but it didn't care. My grandpa was a hunter and he had a lot of old guns and knives for decoration. I grabbed a rifle and I went to see what it is and what it wanted from my family. I followed it outside. It knew I was following it but it ignored my presence. Like it wanted my to follow it. I felt a sudden shock and I passed out. I woke up in the same bed not remembering anything. But my grandma's eyes had become more filled with that light like they fed on something. The day passed but my dad was nowhere to be seen same as my brother. Night again, I went to bed and the same noise again. I saw it. My grandma was in front of it. It raised its hands. My grandma began to float. I could see that the light in her eyes drained as the entity's eyes filled. I dropped my phone from the nightstand and it dropped my grandma down. His head turned. It looked more human. My grandma didn't. It fed on her soul.  
  
I got into my bed and I covered myself in the covers. I could feel his aura getting closer and closer until it disappeared. I waited in the covers until my mother was awake. My alarm rang. I closed it. I woke up. I went downstairs, they were all there. My mom, dad, and brother. I was puzzled. I thought I was losing it. Its over for me. I officially lost it. I tried to interact with them but they disappeared. It was again, late at night. Same scene. The entity fed on my grandma. His eyes became full. It was complete. It took the form of my dead for years grandpa. The entity was him. I know that he was found dead in the woods while hunting. That "thing" killed him.  
  
Now it became him. I went to sleep again. I woke up in the morning. He was there, talking with everyone. I'm crazy. My grandma was in the kitchen making breakfast. Completely normal. We ate then left. We passed through some woods because grandma lived in a village in the mountains. It was looking at me. It was there. In the place my grandpa died. There was a memorial we made next to it. It wasn't human anymore. It was back at its original form. It looked at me in the eyes then became dust. I never saw it again. Or my grandpa. My mum goes regularly to my grandpa's grave. My grandma lives alone. Three months have passed since then. To this day I cannot tell what happened then.
