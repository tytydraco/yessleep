**Guestbook Entry, July 9 / The Keeper**

The nigh day-long bicycle ride through the fir-laden backcountry to my uncle-in-law’s reclusive seaside cabin was a pleasant one, though its conclusion wasn’t lost on me. The gales that July day were the kind to stab straight through you, leaving you a bag of brittle bones in their wake. Even cocooned in a hardy layer of wool garments, the frigid Pacific cold front couldn’t be kept at bay. By the time I reached the door my hands had long since gone white, and drowsiness beckoned warmly.

I lingered outside on the porch for a while nonetheless, so that I might take in the lighthouse by the water in all its splendour, and bask in rays of sunshine now ephemeral, the dissipation of their delicate heat into my skin no doubt soon to be thwarted by the incoming evening storm creeping over the horizon.

Finding the moment just, I decided to give my uncle a call, if only to thank him for lending me the property for my weekend getaway and notify him of my arrival.

“Fret not!” he reassured me in his customary hearty tone. “Well, good. *Good*… What simply wondrous news. How was the trip over?”

I laughed and spoke to him of the things I’d seen on the way, recounting rolling flowery fields and cotton candy-looking clouds that floated idly by. It was when I made mention of the lighthouse, and how beautiful it was, perched there on the end of the bay, that he went eerily silent.

“R-really?” he finally sputtered.

“What: *really?*” I asked light-heartedly.

There followed a lengthy pause. My uncle’s voice was monotone when he answered.

“Are you outside, watching it as we speak?”

“Why, yes,” I replied. “The view truly is something, is it not?”

“Describe it to me.”

“Describe wh-”

“The lighthouse. Describe it.”

I opted to disregard his sudden peculiar state and play along. I took a gander at the lighthouse, nestled between a crag and the sweeping sandy beach.

“It’s a quaint little thing, an unassuming one at that. Light yellow with a tiny window in the midd-”

“With a red cupola and gallery atop the tower?”

“Um, yeah?”

“You see it too?”

“Of course I see it,” I said, uncertain whether my amusement ought to be concern. “It’s *there*.”

Another pause, longer.

“Alice... *Normal* people don’t see it.”

“You mean, they don’t *notice* it in all likelihood? It isn’t exactly in-your-face. Nor does it stick out like a sore thumb.”

“No,” he sighed deeply. “I mean they *can’t* see it. It doesn’t *exist*. I mean it *does*, just not to *them*.” When he felt my confusion, he added: “I know this is your first time visiting my cabin, but I can assure you there isn’t supposed to be any lighthouse there. There never was for me until very recently.”

I chuckled to myself.

“Perhaps they built it over the winter,” I offered. “After all, you only just opened up the shack for summer last week. You’ve been away in the city the remainder of the year.”

“No no. Nobody ever built it. It doesn’t *really* exist!”

“I’m *not normal* then, am I not? Seeing as I’m seeing it...”

“Well, you’re the only other person I know who has. You and I were *chosen*.”

“Chosen? Whatever for?... Uncle Barry, is everything okay? You’re scaring me.”

Was this some attempt at a ruse? I’d never known my uncle as being much of a trickster.

“Further, the family came along with me last week,” he persisted as though I hadn’t spoken.

“Pardon?”

“The lighthouse, it isn’t new, in fact it’s surprisingly old. My family, they were with me.”

I shook my head.

“And what did they have to say about this?” I queried sternly.

“Oh, God forbid they ever find out about the lighthouse!”

“So you’ve not talked to them about it at all?” I exclaimed.

“Most certainly not. I was... *prepared*. Quite serendipitously so too.”

“Prithee, tell me why not,” I responded sarcastically, frustrated by his seemingly purposeful lack of clarity.

“It’s best they not find out about it, lest the lighthouse reveals itself to them as well. We were all present, yet the lighthouse only became visible to me, the sole individual who knew about it beforehand.”

Waves crashed and washed away rhythmically off in the distance, severing my uncle’s words and rendering them more incoherent than they already were.

“How can one have knowledge pertaining to something no one has seen?”

“As I said, I was somewhat prepared, hence my not telling them about it.”

“I don’t imagine seeing a lighthouse is the most special of events, and could see seeing one not cropping up in conversation. How are you to know your family didn’t see it?”

“They didn’t.”

I felt exasperated, the migraine that had pestered me since dawn now exacerbated by a discussion resembling more a merry-go-round than it did an actual discussion.

“You fear telling your family, yet here I stand, beholding a lighthouse I knew nothing of. How can your theory thus possibly hold?”

“Listen, I get that you’re ups-”

“And whatever would you be trying to achieve in the first place, sparing their eyes from something as innocuous as a lighthouse?”

“I really can’t explain...”

“Then *try*.”

It felt to me he was beating around the bush, stalling, like there was something more.

“I probably shouldn’t.”

“Fine,” I said. “I think it’s time I went to bed...”

My uncle sighed again, clearly ambivalent about something.

“Alice, you see, the hut’s been in the family for centuries. For generations it’s been the place where our ancestors spent their summers. And of them all only one ever wrote about a lighthouse in a dusty journal I happened upon in the attic. A lighthouse that appeared overnight, one that only he could perceive. He said everyone thought he’d gone mad.

“Naturally I didn’t believe a word of it either, but studied the entries regardless, and from those unknowingly gathered enough to be prepared for when I would eventually see it for myself, not that I expected I ever would.”

“I’m... I’m not sure I follow...” I began. Nonsensical and lacklustre though my uncle’s postulations were, there was a seriousness underlying them that simply couldn’t be ignored.

“That written account is precisely a hundred years old, but that’s not all. I found a discarded painting, caked in cobwebs, predating the journal by another hundred-odd years. It’s a depiction of a lighthouse. *The* lighthouse. It reoccurs periodically. So it appears.

“I need to know now, the door at its base, is it open? Is the entrance open?”

Asking why he took interest in something as mundane as a door was pointless. I didn’t much care. I simply peered at the lighthouse, at the doorway facing me.

“It is indeed, happy?” I said. Had it been open from the start? I’d been outside for so long I could no longer remember.

“Oh. I see.”

“What?” I pressed.

“Well.”

“Will you quit keeping things from me!” I snapped.

“The **Keeper**.”

“Huh??”

“The Keeper’s coming for you. Once the door is open, it means the Keeper’s seen you.”

“Who?”

“*The lighthouse keeper.*”

“Who’s that?”

“It’s what inhabits the lighthouse. An ancient curse that runs in our bloodline. Alice, I’m so terribly sorry, but there’s absolutely nothing you or I can do anymore. It was meant to be me, but I ran, managed to get away in time.

“I’d understood from reading the journal that the door isn’t always open. Once it is however, that’s really all she wrote. Our ancestor’s writings spanned over a handful of days, time during which he described the lighthouse and recurring unsettling visions he was having. In his final entry, he stated that something had changed: the door had mysteriously been opened.”

“What’s any of that got to do with me?” I blurted out after fruitless reflection, my words unable to help taking on a more morose character.

“Granted few and far between, it’s well known within the family that over the years there have been... acciden- *No*, fuck this, I can’t...” My uncle stopped, audibly overcome with emotion.

The sun suffocated in a thick veil of grey then, and the cold swooped down on me with great fervency.

“*Uncle Barry?*”

I waited anxiously, the questions swirling around in my head plenty.

This seemed real enough. The lighthouse was, wasn’t it? I mean, obviously it was real. After all, there it was, right? Right *there*. But was it *real* real, the type of real my uncle propounded it was? The type that wasn’t *really* real for most but for some was? Was that really what it was?

Was the Keeper *real* too? And what if the Keeper was?

I didn’t want to talk to any keeper. I didn’t want to be disturbed while on my solo break. I didn’t wa-

“I didn’t want it to be one of my children,” Uncle Barry continued grimly. “I knew it was merely a matter of time before it revealed itself to someone else, given that I would never return. So I sent you there under the pretence of spending a nice relaxing weekend. *Fuck.* I’m so- I- Fuck, fuck, fuck, fu- *What the hell have I done?*”

His breaths were heavy. Short. Almost mimicking the ocean’s to-and-fros.

A sniffle. Another sniffle. More sniffles.

Quiet. How I detested that. In it I tried drawing some semblance of sense from the mess my uncle had laid out before me, to no avail. None of it was true, I tried telling myself over and over.

“I hope you can find it in you to forgive me, for though this was a decision, it was no choice…” were his parting words, and swiftly he hung up, leaving me alone with the howling wind and its hardly comforting touch, on a beach with a lighthouse bearing some degree of existence.

I didn’t know just what to do then, and so, ensconced within the confines of the cabin—with the apprehension my uncle had imparted to me festering and indignation gnawing away at any thoughts outstanding—frantically in a makeshift journal of my own I wrote, before darkness swallowed the world and I was unable to see the lighthouse and its gaping door anymore.

&nbsp;

Rain battered the windows incessantly as night dragged inexorably on. The first traces of pale light eventually did start to bleed through a stagnant sea fog that clung to the world like a wet rag, staining everything a sickly sheen of silver. I ventured out onto the porch once more, a mug of scalding coffee in hand to counteract the nip in the air.

It had dawned on me just what a gullible idiot I was. A series of missed calls followed by a pitiful text from my uncle validated as much: *‘I regret what I said. Don’t leave the cabin! I’m on my way to make things right…’*

I overlooked the shore and wrote in my trusty guestbook to kill the time, ready to tear into him—provided he wasn’t taking the piss about coming here too.

**Guestbook Entry, July 10 / The Keeper’s Keep**

There was an inertness to Barry as engrossing as it was dismaying. One spreading to you like a sickness as you watched, *swallowing* you in its undeniable reality.
	
Barry’s expression had softened, from that of discomfort to something approximating (dare I say blasé?) disorientation, though placing it precisely wasn’t elementary without his eyes anymore. They were the first things to go.

Intently, I watched the earth beneath Barry change shades until none of him remained, after which what he’d gone into promptly watched me, those eyes affirming what I’d reluctantly come to expect: that room had been *kept* for me.

I’d have died for Barry to suffice, something which had in a certain respect proven to be true given the last of him hadn’t been wolfed down with quite the same vigour the rest had.

But it wasn’t. A dark *descent* of my own would come.

For this wasn’t a question of mere satiation.

This was *sport* above all else, and the shift from need to desire an immaterial dichotomy I could never derive benefit from.
