It started when I was on a road trip, stopping at a dingy roadside motel off the highway. The sign buzzed weakly in the night, and the old man at the front desk barely looked up when I checked in.

“Room six,” he muttered, sliding a key across the counter. I didn’t even have to sign anything.

The room smelled like mildew and cheap cleaner. It wasn’t good but I wasn’t in a good place. My husband—soon to be ex—and I had gotten into another fight. He shouted. I shouted. The dog barked. I left. And then I was there, at Palm Island Motel, just three miles south of the Georgia border. My mood was so far south there wasn’t any map left for it to travel down.

The flickering bathroom light annoyed me. Big surprise. Everything was annoying me. I decided to turn it off and wash my face in the dim glow of the nightstand lamp. I turned the faucet—

—and fell.

Not onto the grimy motel tiles. Not onto anything solid.

Just—down.

I woke up on my back, staring at a ceiling lined with flickering fluorescents. The air was thick with chlorine. When I sat up, I realized I was lying on smooth, damp tile, inches away from a shallow, still pool.

It stretched out infinitely. The water was the most picturesque shade of blue. Cartoon-blue. The air was humid, pressing against my skin, and as I sat up, I realized that stark white walls surrounded me.

“Hello?” I called out. My voice echoed into nothing. “Holy shit, what the hell just happened?”

There was no answer. No doors. No windows. No signs of life.

I started walking. The walls formed a maze around me, leading to more pools, more tiled corridors. More silence. I’ve never been more afraid in my life.

I don’t know how long I wandered before I saw the first sign that I wasn’t alone.

A ripple.

The water in one of the distant pools shuddered, just for a moment, before going perfectly still again. My pulse pounded as I scanned the empty halls. Nothing. Just the endless pools, the buzzing lights.

Then I saw them.

*Wet footprints.*

Not mine.

They led around the corner, disappearing into another room. I didn’t follow them. I thought, “Shit, if someone else is down here, what if they aren’t friendly?”

It felt like the sort of place where unfriendly people would congregate. Unfriendly things.

I should have. Hindsight, right? It’s always twenty-twenty.

That night—if it was night—something whispered my name.

*Maria.*

I sat upright. My eyes scanned the small room I had taken shelter in. White tiles. Blue water. Bright lights. No one else was there.

“This isn’t funny.” My voice shook. I pulled my knees closer to my chest and tried to ignore the grumbling of my stomach. “Ron?”

I don’t know why I called out for my almost-ex. I didn’t really think he was down here—wherever here happened to be. I just...didn’t know who else to guess.

Silence greeted me.

I didn’t sleep again that night. It was the start of a habit. I don’t sleep much here. I try really hard not to, mostly because...someone always calls my name, right when I go to sleep. It feels dangerous. But exhaustion gets the best of everyone and several days—though they felt like years—into being here, I must’ve drifted off because I woke up to a splash.

A deep one. Close.

My stomach twisted as I sat up.

The pool beside me had ripples spreading outward. Something had been there. Maybe still was.

Then I heard the breathing.

Slow. Wet. Just beyond the next hallway.

I pressed myself against the tile, barely daring to breathe.

A shape moved. A figure—tall, lanky, dripping with water—stood at the edge of a pool just beyond my sight. It didn’t move like a person. It swayed, almost floating above the tile, as if deciding whether or not to step into the water. The skin looked almost like wet wax in the bright neon-white, the limbs elongated and seemingly jointless.

Then, it bent at an unnatural angle and disappeared beneath the surface, without a splash.

I didn’t wait around to see if it would come back.

That was days ago. I think. I’ve been moving constantly, keeping my back to the walls, avoiding the water. That’s hard. There’s not a lot out here *other* than water.

But today, I found something new.

A metal door, rusted and slick with condensation, stands at the end of a narrow hallway. It’s the first thing that doesn’t belong here. The only way out. It *has* to be. I know that it has to be.

But I hesitated.

There are wet footprints leading up to it.

None coming back.

I don’t know if I should go in there or stay here and keep hoping that creature doesn’t come back. If anyone finds this, remember me.

And don’t trust the water.
