I’m not sure how long I stayed sitting outside that night, the bowl of milk at my feet. Sitting alone in the silent dark, the hours contorted. The bright constellations above reminded me of old lectures on relativity, the way time slows as you approach the speed of light. I felt for a moment that if I stood perfectly still, the night would pass in a blink.

The cat never did show.

In the morning, Mark found me shivering outside.

“How long have you been out here?” he asked.

“Not long,” I said.

He gave me a measuring look, evaluating the goose pimples on my skin and the curdled milk at my feet.

“Maybe you should get into town today, see the sights, you know?”

“Sights?” I raised an eyebrow.

“Get a coffee. Hell, maybe a glass of wine. You’ve been cooped up.”

*Stop telling me what to do,* I wanted to scream at him, but that’s probably just because I was tired.

“You’re right,” I said. “Of course.”

After Mark left for work, I curled up in a delicious sunbeam on the bed and closed my eyes. I dreamed I was eating live mice, reveling in their squeals as their bones crunched in my jaws and swallow them in two or three gulps. 

I woke up starving. Nothing in the house looked good.

*Get a coffee… wine,* I heard Mark saying. 

Okay, maybe I would. And a sandwich too. I figured that should make him happy.

I took our old sedan into town. In the city, I’d always appreciated its size–perfect for squeezing around streetcars or into a parking spot. Here, it could barely operate, struggling down the bumpy dirt driveway to the main road. Too many trips into town, and I’d need to find a good chiropractor. 

As far as coffee or booze went, the town really had only one option: General Joe’s, which I’d never had the courage to visit yet. It was a kind of bar slash lunch spot slash general store. The whole exterior was American flags and camouflage, windchimes made of spent rifle shells. 

I walked inside, expecting to find something rank and dark, maybe a little bit neon, but the place was actually pretty cheerful. Music was playing, some kind of top 40’s channel, but the sound felt blessedly normal compared to the forest silence. The decor was woodsy minimalism, and friendly pictures of local events adorned the walls. 

This wasn’t the kind of spot where people day-drank themselves to death–it was a town hangout, well-maintained and almost exclusively friends and family. I didn’t expect to be welcomed as either, but the bartender gave me a huge smile when I told her the three-sentence version of how I ended up there.

“So you’re the one in old Bill Mitchell’s place. About time you came around here. We’ve all been wondering about you. I’m Jenny.”

I took a seat at the bar. My first drink was on the house, a light beer from some local brewery I didn’t recognize that tasted suspiciously like Bud Light. I was half way through it when the bell above the door chimed and a group of six stalked in.

At first glance, they looked like bikers passing through–they’d rolled up on motorcycles that I could see out the window–but there was something a little off about them. One had bright green hair, spiked straight up, another had a leather necklace and jacket studded with nails, all had tattoos over every piece of visible skin. 

It was the tattoos, I realized. They were in a language I’d never seen before, one that didn’t have a recognizable alphabet. And there were symbols that seemed familiar, but I couldn’t place where I might’ve seen them before.

Jenny scowled when she saw them.

“Thought you said you were just passing through,” she said.

“Still got some unfinished business,” said an older man. He was at least 70. Seemed a little old for the biker life. I tried not to look at him, but when I saw his arm, I couldn’t help it. A long wound, running all the way up his forearm, had been hastily stitched up by some unskilled hand. The flesh smelled rank, like he needed to get to a doctor right away. 

“We’re not here to cause trouble,” he said. “The other night, that was us celebrating. We’re just here to get a little drunk, maybe eat some chicken wings.”

“Fine,” said Jenny. “But I told you, she’s underage.”

She gestured to an asian girl who couldn’t have been more than nineteen. The girl stuck out her tongue and flipped her off before grabbing a pool stick.

“Dorothy’s not drinking this time,” the man said. “I talked to her beforehand.”

Jenny crossed her arms.

The one with the spiked green hair jumped onto the bar, which was equal parts impressive and terrifying. He was awfully big to have a vertical leap like that. I suddenly realized how muscular he was, like he could crush a bowling ball with his bare hands. He stuck out his tongue, and I saw that it was tattooed too. 

“You gonna make us leave?” he asked.

Jenny squeaked and backed up. “I… I…”

“You, you.” The guy laughed. “That’s all you ever think about. How small.”

“I don’t get paid enough for this,” Jenny muttered, but she didn’t move. The older man scowled at the green-haired one. 

“Get the fuck down from there, Pez. You’re on guard duty. Make sure none of these small town hicks scratches my ride.”

“But Stan–”

“Now.”

“Make Dorothy do it,” whined Pez, as he got down. “She can’t drink anyway.”

“It wasn’t a request,” said Stan, lightly touching a knife tucked into his belt at his hip. Pez made a face, but he trudged out of the bar. Soon, I could see his back pressed against the front window of the place as he smoked a cigarette and watched the passing cars.

I thought about paying up and going, but it seemed like that might draw their attention. Instead, I just sat frozen, pretending I hadn’t noticed a thing. I nursed my beer, trying to let it calm my nerves.

The bikers took seats at the bar, with Stan settling in right next to me. Jenny begrudgingly fetched them a round of beers. They didn’t hide their distaste for the brews, but that didn’t stop them from pounding a few each. The gang barely talked, occasionally grunting out orders for additional drinks. 

I couldn’t help take a quick look at each of them in turn. One was fifty and covered in scars. He was missing an eye and possibly a tongue. At once point, I saw him open his mouth to reveal a dark void inside.

The last was a woman in her forties that wore two dozen mismatched rings and as many bracelets, which clinked and jangled whenever she made the slightest movement.

“How much longer we gotta stay here?” she whispered to Stan. “This place is depressing.”

“We stay until the job is done,” he said.

“But it is done,” she said.

He shook his head, “Not all the way.”

“You gonna pay for all this?” asked Jenny.

When Stan reached for his wallet and shuffled through three of four credit cards looking for the one he wanted to use, I couldn’t help but notice something odd: each of his cards had a different name on it. I didn’t catch them all, but I was pretty sure one read *Beth Green.*

I tried not to react, sipping my beer casually, but Stan looked up at me, catching me eying the cards. He sniffed the air around me.

“You a local?” he asked.

I shrugged, “I’m getting there.”

He sniffed again.

“You got a cat?”

I shook my head.

Stan looked at me more closely now, and his fingers played with the knife at his belt. He plucked it out, ran his fingers along the blade as he watched me. I swear, the blade started to shine a weird black color.

He looked over at Dorothy. She was eating chicken wings while she watched the others shoot pool.

“Dorothy,” he called.

“What?” she asked, sounding annoyed.

He nodded his head at her.

“Oh. That,” she said, her tone changing. She whooped and flipped over the table she was sitting at.

Jenny groaned and ran to clean it up, leaving me alone with Stan at the bar.

I started to stand up, but he reached out with his free hand and grabbed my wrist, his hand rough and hard. I flinched, tried to twist away, but his grip was inescapable. 

Then in one swift and merciless motion, stabbed his knife through my palm, pinning my hand to the bar. The blade pulsed as my blood rushed around it. I tried to scream, but it stuck in my throat. I felt tears streaming down my face. I *heard* screams. I felt hot blood spilling out.

“I don’t like liars,” he said. 

“Please,” I rasped, my throat so dry I could hardly talk.

“People think it’s so easy to lie. But it’s not. It’s the hardest thing. People aren’t any good at it,” he said. “Now, tell the truth. You got a pet? Maybe a new one?”

While he waited for my answer, he pulled the knife out of my hand, and this time I did scream. Before I could move, he stabbed the blade into my stomach at the navel, and I could feel it cutting through my skin as he began to slide it up.

“I saw a cat… out in the woods,” I said. “Stop! Don’t–”

“This cat–”

He seemed about to say something else, but just then, Pez ran in from outside. 

“Stan! We gotta move,” Pez shouted.

“Shit,” Stan said, standing.

When he moved, reality itself seemed to ripple and snap.

I put my hands to my stomach, to feel the blood and entrails spilling out, but there was nothing. My hand was fine. The terror that I had been about to die gave way just a bit to relief.

I realized I was shaking, though I tried not to. And the harder I tried to stay still, the harder I shook.

I looked around, noticing that they had all left.

Jenny slammed the door behind them and gave a sigh of relief.

“You alright? You look pale as a ghost.”

I must have looked bad because she poured me some whiskey and I drank it down before I trusted myself to speak.

“Who were they?” I asked.

“No idea,” she said. “First time I ever saw them was last night. Came in looking like they’d been through hell. Creeped out the regulars. Hopefully that’s the last time we see them.”

By the time I got home, it was nearing dark. I was happy to get back, safe from the dangerous group at the bar, but my relief didn’t last long. The silence was back, heavier than before, especially in contrast to the busy human noise of the bar.

I ran the sink, listened to my own footsteps. I tried to play music, but for some reason it seemed to make things worse. Then, as I turned off my radio, I heard a soft thump outside and looked out to see the cat. It started up at me through the sliding door and made a soft meow. 

*“You got a cat?”* I heard Stan’s question echo in my mind. Why had he suddenly been so curious. Why had he sniffed me? And what had happened with that knife?

Maybe I should have let the whole thing go. Maybe I should have let Stan and the others hunt that cat down and do what they wanted. But fuck that. The cat was mine. I wasn’t going to let them have it.

I filled a new bowl with milk and walked outside. When I did, the cat startled and retreated toward the treeline.

“It’s okay,” I said. “It’s okay.”

I began walking after it, the milk sloshing slightly in my hand. Finally, I put the bowl down. But I didn’t stop walking. I continued following the cat.

*Don’t do it,* I heard an imaginary Mark warning in my head. *Bears. Mountain Lions. Men.*

But my gut told me to go. The forest was black all around me now, the canopy of pine needles catching the last bits of sun.

I heard a sound again out in the forest. It was a low growl, like the engine of a large, slow vehicle idling in place.

“Hello?” I shouted out, mostly to hear my own voice.

*Go back,* said Mark. *Go back in the light. That’s where it’s safe.*

*No,* I thought. *The dark is where it’s safe. That’s where no one can find you.*

I took a step out into the woods, and the roar became louder, but as it did, I realized what it really was: a purr. It was out there, calling me. The sound grew louder with each step I took into the darkness. I had been afraid for days, maybe years. I wasn’t afraid now.

I began to walk faster, the loam and dry needles cushioning my steps. I’d never felt the ground so soft. The city streets had never bent for me. I was running, chasing down the great big thing in the woods.

Before I knew it, I had reached a clearing. No paths led in or out, but I knew right away that I wasn’t the first human to come here. Five large stones had been arranged at exact intervals around the clearing, with smaller stones dotting lines between them in the shape of a star. In the center, the earth was harder. I bent to touch it and my hand smelled of iron when I lifted my fingers to my nose.

All the while, the big thing in the forest continued to circle me, never quite coming into the light. It was as if it was waiting for me to do something, but of course I didn’t know quite what that was.

Time passed, and the moon rose overhead. The sound began to grow quieter. Every once in a while, I thought I saw white paws through the lines of trees surrounding me, but that might have been my imagination. This was no cat though. If I could trust my eyes, the thing stalking me was larger than any bear or moose I’d ever seen.

Hours later, I found my way home. When I got in, I found a squad car in the driveway. Mark ran to me, wrapping me in a tight embrace.

“Where were you?” he shouted. “Do you know how worried I’ve been.”

As he spoke, a sheriff’s deputy approached from behind.

“Ma’am, are you okay?”

“Of course, officer,” I said. “I was just taking a little walk in the woods and lost track of time.”

“All by yourself?” asked Mark. “In the middle of the night? You could have stumbled across a bear, a hunter--”

“I’m fine,” I said to him, smiling cheerily. “Don’t worry so much.”

Eventually, the officer cleared out. As he walked to his car, I followed after him, hoping to get a moment alone.

“Thank you for making the trip all the way out here,” I said.

“No problem, Ma’am.”

“There’s… one other thing. I was in town earlier and I saw some bikers… I’m pretty sure one of them had a credit card that had Mrs. Green’s name on it. I thought I should tell you.”

The officer scowled. “I know the punks you’re talking about. Brought ‘em in for questioning this morning. If you’d be willing to pick them out of a line up…”

“Of course,” I said. “Anything to help.”

The officer left, and I returned to the house.

I thought that would be the end of it, but Mark sulked all night. He’s asleep now, and I’m out with my laptop on the porch, a bowl of milk at my feet.

From time to time, I hear the splintering of wood out in the forest, and the low growl returns. But it is still waiting. Watching.

We are still trying to tame each other, this thing and I. We are still waiting to [come out of the dark.](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/)
