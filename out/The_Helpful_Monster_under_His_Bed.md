I crouch by my child's bed for the third night, face on the blankets, weeping. 

Another day of begging the police for updates, and getting none. Of putting up posters. Of spreading the word on Facebook. And still, no news. The last of my hope is starting to drain from me. What kind of mother can't look after her own child?

Suddenly, I hear something clear its throat. Surprised, my head jolts up, wiping the tears from my eyes. I look around until I see something that makes me scream.

Some kind of baby-faced doll head is poking out from under the bed, and looking directly at me. I think rationally: It must just be a toy. My vision is still blurry, so I'm not seeing it right. I go to rub my eyes again, but then it speaks.

"About your child," it says, "I need your help."

Acting purely on animal instinct, I stand up and run to my room. Shuffling through my night stand, I grab my gun, and stand there with my back against the wall, trying to figure out what to do. Do I hide here, or go back to Andy's room? An answer is given to me as the doll head extends itself from my own bed, and I see that it's attached to some kind of stalk.

"There's no need to be afraid. I'm Andy's friend."

I shoot, but I miss, putting a hole in my floor. The head retracts back under the bed.

"Okay, I see you're disturbed. Adults' minds aren't as flexible as children's, so this reaction is expected. Would you be more comfortable if I talked under here?"

I crouch down and try to see under the bed, starting to regain some calm. I left my phone in the other room, and the light switch is on the opposite wall, so only the dim light from the hallway illuminates... Whatever it is. All I can see is some kind of amorphous shape, and the faint outline of the doll's head.

"Like I said, I'm Andy's friend. I was quite disturbed when he didn't come to bed two nights ago. Normally, I'd find him at a friend's house, but I couldn't find him anywhere. I returned here to hear you talking to the police, and that's when I knew something was wrong."

Finally managing to speak, I stammer, "What are you?"

"That's not really important right now, but let's just say I'm a protector. Unfortunately, my influence is limited to the undersides of beds."

A protector? "Are you saying... You can help me find Andy?"

"Not quite. Actually, I've already found him. I just can't get him out."

I spring to my feet, ready for action. "Where!? Tell me where to go!"

"Unfortunately, I can't tell you where it is in terms of your world's geography."

"In terms of- What?"

"I can't guide you there... But I can take you there."

My head is spinning. "How can you do that?"

"Well, you'll have to join me under here, and allow me to envelop you."

I'm not sure what that means exactly, but it sounds terrible. I don't know if I really trust this thing, but it's the only lead I've got. "If you can really do that, let me get my phone."

"Of course."

I go to the other room and grab my phone from the nightstand. As I do, I look down, and see the doll head watching me once more from Andy's bed. I crouch down, aiming my phone at this creature, and go to turn the flashlight on.

"I wouldn't do that," it says, "I think it will make your journey more... Distressing if you do."

I'm not sure if that's really true. Wouldn't it be better to at least *know* what I'm working with here? I consider turning it on anyway, but decide that it doesn't really matter. When I get under that bed, it's either going to kill me, or take me to Andy. Knowing what it looks like won't change that.

"You should hurry, I'm not sure how much longer it will be safe. I'd recommend to close your eyes and crawl under the bed, and let me take it from there."

I follow its instructions. At first, I lay under the bed, not feeling anything. Then a warmth starts to envelop me, but not a pleasant one. I feel like I'm being covered in fresh, raw meat. It squeezes itself all around me, even smothering my face, and for a terrifying several seconds I'm unable to breathe. Then it retreats, and I find myself no longer laying on the carpet, but on hard concrete.

I look around, but can't see anything. Of course, it's dark. The creature is nowhere to be seen. I turn my flashlight on, exposing a bare concrete floor. I crawl out, and my heart drops as I see Andy lying on the metallic cot. He seems unharmed, but he's tied up, blindfolded, and gagged. "Andy," I whisper-scream. I almost normal-screamed, but decide against it, not knowing if the person who did this is nearby. I get to work untying him, while trying to comfort him. "Mom's here for you. Everything will be okay now. I promise." Even after un-gagging him, he's silent, most likely too terrified or traumatized to speak.

I hug him tight for a few seconds, and then get back into action. Finally not focused completely on my own son, I look around the room. It's a large room, perhaps an abandoned workshop of some kind, and there other children tied up similarly. Quickly, I take some pictures, as well as a screenshot of my location on my map app, and text them all to the police.

I start to untie the next closest child, but then I hear footsteps coming from outside, getting closer to the room. I think to the gun still in my pocket, but don't want to risk anything, especially with Andy here. For all I know, it's multiple people coming, and they could all have guns too, and would probably be a better shot than I am. I crouch back down under the bed. "Pssst, thing, get us out of here!"

No reply.

Not knowing what else to do, I grab Andy and pull us both under the bed. I hear the metal door screech open, and several men enter the room. The lights come on, and I hear one of them say "Hey, one of the kids is missing!"

They start getting closer, and I know the cot doesn't provide much cover. I grip the gun in my hands. Luckily, I don't need to use it, as I feel the warmth start spreading itself across my back again. "Apologies," the thing whispers, but provides no explanation for its tardiness.

After another disgusting transport, Andy and I are back on our warm carpet. I hold him close and sob, and feel the warmth lay itself on both our shoulders, in an apparent attempt at comfort.

I tuck Andy into his bed, and it's not long before the police call me, asking how I got into that building, and how I even found it in the first place. I'm unable to give them a proper answer, but I don't care right now. I'm just overwhelmed with joy to have Andy back.

Not getting any information from me, they let me know they'll be conducting a raid shortly, but I'll have to do a better job answering questions when a cop arrives at my door in a few minutes. Unbothered, I simply say "Okay", and lay in bed with my child, spending as much time here as I can until I have to go face the consequences.

[As I lay there with him, the doll head rises above the edge of the bed, and its smile seems wider than before.](http://www.cjohnson57.com/Stories)
