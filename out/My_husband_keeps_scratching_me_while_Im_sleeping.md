I have been married to my husband for 7 years now and we have no kids yet, I have always been aware of his extreme fantasies in the bedroom but in our 7 years of marriage, they get worse every year. My husband gets off by hurting me, physically, to be specific. At first, I found this weird but as years went by I got used to being hit during sex, by hitting I don't mean mere spanking I mean being really hit till I bruise. 

"I'm sorry sweet pumpkin, this is the only way I can get off, I have no intentions of hurting you", he'd say after sex.

Because I love him, I took it but i had to hide in crazy amounts of make up so that people don't think my husband is hitting me. 

I recently experienced virgina irritation and its been two weeks since we angaged in anything sexual and honestly this is frustrating him but what can I do? What can we do? One morning I was making breakfast downstairs while my husband was showering upstairs to go to work.

"Breakfast is ready pumpkin pie", I yelled with a huge smile on my face calling him downstairs 

"Give me a second honey", he responded back.

Breakfast was going well but it was rather quiet than usual and this was not like us as we are used to talking about everything and anything. 

"How did the doctor's appointment go yesterday, did he say we can have sex anytime soon like tonight", he asked with a serious face.

I giggled and said "very funny sweet pumpkin, he said it could take two more weeks".

I noticed a sudden change with his face, he looked more angry, more bitter it was unsettling. He got up angrily, spilling the juice in his glass.

"I guess I'll have to masterbate again tonight then", he stormed out of the door.

I was shocked as to why he would be so angry, I have never seen such anger in his face before.

Later that night we got ready for bed as usual in dead silence again, I was honestly waiting for an apology because of the way he acted earlier but we got to bed and switched off the lights. The next morning I woke up with a painful back, I rushed to the mirror to check what was wrong but I was shocked with what met my eyes. Sharp scratches on my back as if I was being scratched with a knife, I called my husband in panick as he already went to work but he did not respond. The first thought that came to my mind was that he scratched me and ran to work.  

This happened the next night too and the next one too and my husband kept saying I'm insane, but how could I explain the deep marks in my back and butt. I decided to pull an all nighter the following night to see what exactly was happening to me while I'm sleeping. Exactly around 11 pm, my husband was breathing in an odd way, almost like a blood hungry beast out to kill, I was shivering but I had to keep still before I could ruin everything plus I was not sure if it was my husband making those noises. 

I felt a hand brushing my bruised back, it was painful but I didn't want to make any noises as I could disturb whatever was happening, I saw my husband's hand moving towards my breaststroke and scratching me till I bled I screamed so loud as I couldn't handle the pain anymore.

"Shhhh honey, calm down, what's wrong are you ok?" My husband asked me as if he didn't know what was going on.

"Fuck you, so you have been scratching me all along?", I asked in anger but I got no response just a weird stare and deep heavy breathing as my husband just ejaculated from scratching the hell out of me.

It's been two weeks now since I left my husband alone at our house as I needed some break from the scratching.

One evening I decided to go back to my house as I was ready to listen to my husband as he explains what's wrong with him but as I entered the house I found my husband masturbating to squirrels that he hung on the ceiling bleeding.
