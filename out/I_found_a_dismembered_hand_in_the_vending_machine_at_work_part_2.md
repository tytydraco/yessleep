Slowly, my vision began to return. My head throbbed as if vice grips were pressed to my temples. I raised my head and looked back towards the large office room and gasped.  
  
The walls had turned black and crumbled to pieces all around the entrance. The floor had collapsed. Cracks curved their way down the hallway, looking like snakes made of shadow.  
  
All the windows looking out on the endless void had blown out in a fifty-foot circle around the office room’s door. Somehow, that seemed worst of all. Would those strange abominations witnessed in the void crawl in now that our defenses had been breached? I hoped not, but I wondered whether perhaps they already had.  
  
I saw Alvin behind me, slowly rising to his feet. Agent Kleiner strode forwards, covered with a light layer of dust but otherwise totally unharmed. I groaned and he reached out and helped me up.  
  
“Stop complaining,” he said. “Now if those spider-things had caught you, then you’d have something to complain about.”  
  
“Are we trapped here forever?” I asked, putting my fingers to my forehead. I pulled them back and saw a few drops of fresh blood. I felt lucky that was the only injury I had suffered. “And what do you guys carry, nuclear grenades?”  
  
“Do you think I would come here if I didn’t have a way home?” Agent Kleiner asked, raising an eyebrow. “And no, it’s not nuclear. It’s… something new. No radiation. They’re called positrons. We contain a very, very tiny amount and release it to react with matter during…”  
  
“You could have got us out of here the whole time?!” Alvin interrupted, color rising in his pale, withered cheeks. His eyes looked red and irritated. I figured the smoke from Agent Kleiner’s grenade had caused it. “Why didn’t you just take us out of here at the beginning?” Agent Kleiner shrugged his muscular shoulders, his expression bland and apathetic as he looked down at the small man.  
  
“I had a job to do,” he said. “I told you that at the beginning. The Agency didn’t think they needed more than one Cleaner to handle this anomaly. I mean, I’m sure they didn’t realize how far advanced it was. But, of course, this isn’t the first time I have had to escape something like this.” We walked down the hallway towards where this had all started. I saw the door to the broom closet still stood open a few inches. I must have not closed it completely during the chaos of the day.  
  
I peered in, making sure no torn, eyeless faces looked out on us. I stopped suddenly, realizing there was a figure in there. It looked like it was levitating a couple feet off the ground.  
  
“What the…” I said. Agent Kleiner and Alvin stopped a few feet in front of me, turning to look. Alvin gave an uncharacteristically wicked smile. I saw his sharp teeth glistening behind his pulled-back lips. But I remember thinking earlier that Alvin was nearly toothless…  
  
I flung open the door and saw Alvin’s dead body, hanging from the ceiling. The rope had been tied to a large pipe that ran overhead. It looked like he had committed suicide with the rope in the closet, but I knew it could have been a homicide. His swollen, purple face bulged over the tight noose pulled around his neck. The tip of his black tongue stood out between his cyanotic lips, his staring pupils dilated and blank.  
  
Then I saw the note, and I felt my suspicions of suicide confirmed.  
  
Agent Kleiner and I looked at the fake Alvin, backing slowly away from him. His face started to age, as if some video of a human face ran on fast-forward. His eyes grew more and more sunken, his flesh started to wither and pull back, and after a few moments, it became the face of a skeleton.  
  
The lips turned black and rotted off in pieces, the sharp teeth underneath lengthening as the jaw chattered. The skin on the face grew drier and older before falling off the skull in clumps, looking like old, discarded leather laying on the floor. The dessicated corpse in front of us began to give off a smell that quickly permeated the hallway- an odor like embalming fluid with subtle notes of cinnamon and pistachio, like a mummified body. A sense of revulsion ran through me as I tried to breathe through my mouth, gagging slightly as I backed away.  
  
Its clothes melted into a dark-red robe, the last mask of the janitor dripping away as the monster fully revealed itself. The dark blue janitor’s uniform seemed to suck into its skeletal body, dissolving in patches as if acid had eaten through it. Underneath I saw the robe forming, its hood down to show its full head. Random cracks ran through the top of its skull. I saw a pale, red light shining out. It looked like it had some powerful lightbulb in the center of its head, its ruby eyes glowing dark as its jaw began to chatter ceaselessly.  
  
“Whatever happens, don’t let it invade our world,” I whispered to Agent Kleiner, transfixed with horror as I stared into those soulless reptilian eyes.  
  
“I did not invade your world. I was invited,” the creature hissed. Agent Kleiner raised the Uzi and fired, pulling me into the broom closet and locking it. I don’t know if he hit the creature or not. I saw the bare bulb overhead still turned on from earlier, slightly swaying now with the gentle wind. A frenzied pounding began at the door. I feared it would crack open at any moment.  
  
Agent Kleiner pulled out something from his inner jacket. It looked like a walkie-talkie with intertwining silver and gold threads running across its length. Underneath the threads, I saw a flat, glassy obsidian surface with pyramid and spiral-shaped buttons running up and down its sides. He pressed a pyramid-shaped button on the top. I grabbed the note from next to Alvin as Agent Kleiner grabbed me with his left hand. He kept an iron grip on my arm.  
  
“Get ready,” he said as the door burst open in an explosion of splintered debris. I felt shards of wood hit me in the face and neck, and I flinched.  
  
The Red Messiah ran in, thousands of those abominable hissing spider creatures skittering across the floor behind him. As his skeletal arms reached out to grab me, I felt myself rising through the ceiling at an amazing speed. I looked down and saw the building falling away, like an elevator with its cable cut. A sense of vertigo caused my stomach to flip as I flew up and up, Agent Kleiner still holding my arm.  
  
He had the Uzi on a strap around his shoulder, and in his other hand, he held the alien walkie-talkie device- the one that had saved our lives. I wondered where his Agency got such toys, and then I figured I was better off not knowing.  
  
A few moments later, the world returned with a popping sound. I felt myself dropped a couple of inches onto the sidewalk. I landed heavily, nearly falling, but Agent Kleiner put out a steadying hand.  
  
“Yeah, the first time is always a little weird,” he said, smirking. “That thing never gets you perfectly on the street. It’s always dropping people from slightly above it. Hell, my partner nearly broke his ankle rolling on an empty vodka bottle last time.” I felt speechless, like I had just suffered a thousand years of Hell and then woken up to find it was only a dream.  
  
I looked around, seeing I stood in front of the office building. But when I looked back, I only saw an empty lot covered with garbage and debris. It was as if the building had never been there at all. A fence with graffitied boards and razor-wire surrounded the property. I saw a sign on it. Squinting, I moved nearer.  
  
“Coming Soon: The Church of the Living Messiah.” I looked around and saw no signs that the construction had begun. I pulled out my phone and found nothing about the office. No one I knew remembered it or me working there. It was as if someone had erased it from reality, except for in the minds of two scarred people.  
  
I looked down at the note Alvin had written before his death, hoping for some answers.  
  
“I’m sorry. God, I’m so, so sorry for everything.  
  
“Lucius convinced me to help him summon the Red Messiah. He and his cult members said summoning the being would bring us power over the world. As part of the ritual, Lucius had to give a piece of his flesh as an offering. He chose his left hand, and I put it in the vending machine, so as to let the terror of the lambs and fools mix with the power of the Red Messiah as his consciousness filtered into the building.  
  
“I saw the Red Messiah take over Lucius’ body after the ritual finished. His clothes just melted, as if burning away, then his skin started melting too. Underneath, I saw the skeleton king, the Red Messiah, and I knew I had made a mistake. The horror of seeing that thing once would give me nightmares for years. If we let it take over the world… well, the dead would be the lucky ones, in that case.  
  
“I don’t know if Lucius is still in there somewhere, screaming and crazed. But I know now that I was wrong. No amount of power is worth this.  
  
“God forgive me. -Alvin”  
  
I gave Agent Kleiner the note as black SUVs rushed in, securing the area. Dozens of men in dark suits with mirrored black sunglasses appeared. They came up to Agent Kleiner and congratulated him on a job well done, telling him he had, once again, contained the spread of the anomaly.  
  
I could only stand there, hoping the agents spoke truthfully. Because if the Red Messiah escapes into our world, then Alvin’s note would be right.  
  
The dead would be the lucky ones, in that case.
