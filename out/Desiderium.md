I recently just purchased my suburban home after my wife divorced me, took the house  and the kids a couple years ago. The company said the  2nd delivery van would arrive in a couple days.

Thankfully, the 1st delivery van had my bed, furniture, coffee maker, fridge, and all the other essentials. Within about an hour, I got everything out and set up. I was on my PlayStation late at night so I figured I should get some rest for work tomorrow. 

I wake up and make my coffee as I glance out the back door window. I see a hole, not to big, about the size of a baseball from where I’m standing. I head outside and look inside, I can’t see the bottom. I shrugged it off thinking it was a mole.

I called my friend to see if he can come over after I get off work to hangout. He says yes to the invite, but it will have to be in a week because he’s going to visit his family and relatives. Family was always a top priority for him.

I start too think about my family. My parents past a couple years back and I’m an only child. I always had a good time when I was with my wife and children, I miss them.

After work, I go to lay down on my bed exhausted. Eventually, I wake up to go look at the mysterious hole……. this time, I counted 2. My heart stops for a moment, both are at least the size of a basketball.

The second truck finally arrives and I can get the rest of my stuff. This truck on the other hand, held unneeded, but personal items. Decorations,pictures, sports trophies, etc. I invite my friend over to help set up. After we’re done, he sets up his game and we start playing Red Dead Redemption 2 for about 3 hours, then he leaves. I Sit in my chair, I smile wistfully as I remember my teenage years, nights spent immersed in video games. Back then, responsibilities were minimal, homework was his biggest concern. I recall the thrill of leveling up, the camaraderie with friends, and the freedom to play for hours without a care. Now, amidst the pressures of adulthood, those carefree gaming sessions felt like a distant, cherished dream.

As I’m remembering nostalgic memories, I hear some commotion in the back yard. I look through the window to see 2 giant holes. Both the size of a small trampoline. my heart is trembling with fear. Why did I purchase a home with such a weird backyard? What is wrong with this place? I don’t know how to explain it but, it’s calling too me. Im right in front of the holes as they morph into 1. The call is stronger, stronger than ever before, like a rope tugging at my back trying to pull me back. it makes want to find the source. So I do the unthinkable, jump.
