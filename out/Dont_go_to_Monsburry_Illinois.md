I just wanna say, if you are reading this right now. Never, EVER, go to a little town in southwest Illinois called Monsburry. Don’t go to the town next to it, don’t even go to the next nearest town 15 miles away. You’ve been warned.

For some background, I was a biochemistry major in my junior year of college at the time of these events. I grew up in Indianapolis and for a summer internship I somehow got a position in a small research institute that had maybe 8-10 people in the town next to Monsburry. It was 1994 at the time and I was 20 so any opportunity to leave my home town felt refreshing. Unfortunately leaving my hometown of Indy meant I had to move 300 miles away for around 2 and a half months for this internship. That’s where Monsburry Illinois comes in.

The Local institute, let’s call it M.I.R.D for short, had discovered a new type of vine growing in an open field between Monsburry and the town I moved to and despite the boring nature of it, the way the plant seemed to react to stimuli like touch and heat got government eyes and eventually wallets to turn towards MIRD’s way. Which lead to internship spots and also jobs opening up in the area.

My first day on the job was basically just being a desk jockey but with everyone being in a mobile lab in the middle of nowhere I could hear quite whispers from scientists and the squelching of rubbery dry plant material being cut, pulled, and burned. It took less than 3 hours for one of my coworkers to get sprayed in the face with what I can only describe as bile, it dyed his skin a purplish green and made all the veins from his shoulders up thrum with anger like a bulging rupturing intestine. He reeked of death and was quickly escorted off the site, from then on anyone within a 80 foot radius of the tent housing the plant specimens was forced to be in reinforced Hazmat suits. The simple face shield and N95 mask he had on were torn through like a hot knife through butter by the acidic bile it spewed onto him.

By day 3 on the job, I was one of the only Interns who either hadn’t been somehow thrown to the figurative wolves to test what the plant would do if something smacked it hard or etc. most either like I just mentioned were sent in for tests, or just quit on the first day.

I had nowhere else to go unless I wanted to drive for an entire day and something about the plant was drawing me in. On day 4 it was my first time seeing the main body or what I thought was the main body at the time. Suiting up was a long 45 minute process with one of the main scientist who had a whole process and routine I had to follow to a T “or else the plant would sense something was up” as he put it. He sounded about as insane as he could. But I also felt the seriousness in his voice.

What came was me stepping into the small tent face to face with a short 3 foot tall weed like plant, a small set of green and red speckled leaves lined most of the upper side of the weeded section. With thick roots holding in the dirt. Roots almost as thick as my skinny forearms. I could feel a sort of energy radiate from the ground beneath it. It felt like it was sucking the heat from my boots. I noticed out of the corner of my eye an eye. No bigger than the eye on a Barbie doll, in between a couple of the leaves. I didn’t dare make eye contact with it. I stood there staring at the almost poison Ivy like leaves as I slowly watered it like I was supposed to. Unfortunately the watering can was only a quarter full so it didn’t have its fill. The roots undulated and recoiled like it was a starving and angry snake shivering in pain.

I dropped the watering can, almost sweating through my glove. The eye followed by at least 3 more all slowly moved out from the weeds into my peripheral vision and stared right through my skin to my bones. Like it had X-ray vision. I heard whispers just barely too far into the back of my mind to understand. Like Wingdings read aloud and muffled behind my head. Yet when I screamed they still sounded closer than even my own voice.

The tent couldn’t hold me as I bolted faster than my legs could take me. Falling face first about 40 feet from the tent and accidentally head butting the opening door to the Mobile lab trailer. A security guard and the Head scientist looking at me like I was insane as the visor to my suit was smashed in and cutting into my face. Bleeding profusely and still sweating buckets, I looked like I was dying as I could barely see and dragged myself away from the tent holding whatever that fucking thing was.

“That’s enough!” I heard someone scream. But I didn’t stop. I could feel the dirt below us adjusting and gyrating slowly. I could feel the ground turn cold and go from soft and wet with summer morning dew to dried out and dusty in moments. Once the glass in my eyes fell out with a couple blinks the blurry sight of the tent growing till it ripped like a sad ballon popping was in my sight behind the screaming security guard. He failed to notice that the beast we had been studying had grown to the size of 2 fully grown adult grizzly bears and was standing over him.

Whatever kind of maw it had, it was surely not one to give you a swift painless release. The man I had worked around for a measly 4 days had been picked up and crushed like paper and twigs. Bones cracking and crushing, the gushing of brain matter and blood as it sprayed onto me from my position of only 5 feet away. His body contorted into a pretzel as it squeezed him for all his innards like a man juicing an orange for breakfast. There was so much blood.

I slowly stepped backwards as quietly as possible. I thought if I was slow and quiet it would notice me. Like a dinosaur in Jurassic park. Foolishly I didn’t notice the root that had been.. well uprooted behind me. Causing me to take another concussing fall. I landed with an “oof!”and a loud thud. I prayed to god to let the beast not come near me but I knew I was heard by no one. I felt a giant quake as it stepped. Almost titanic in weight at this point. I looked up and saw the blurry shape of a Venus fly trap looking thing with an eye the size of a beach ball in the center of its mouth. It made eye contact with me and I heard its voice but didn’t know what it was saying. It spoke to me for eons and I don’t remember a single word. I don’t even know if I was dreaming about the voice. But every now and again since that day I still hear it whisper incomprehensible things to me.

It let me crawl away in that moment that day, I’m not sure why. It watched me every time I stumbled and had to claw at the tall grass to get back up. I could feel it staring at my back as I dragged my injured and exhausted self 15 miles to Monsburry town center. I felt it watch me as I was presented a gruesome graveyard of a town covered in red speckled vines. All almost as thick as a firehose or as tiny as a little twine.

Animals, people, buildings. Crumpled for the nutrients or being puppeteered around like they were toys in a childhood playroom and I was the only one not suffering.

The scourge of plants took my hotel and car with it. So I had to walk 30 miles or so to find the nearest bus station in my half torn and cut up Hazmat suit, I don’t know happened to that thing but I know for sure that the town of Monsburry isn’t a place I’ll ever go back to ever again.

Ive been coughing up leaves.
