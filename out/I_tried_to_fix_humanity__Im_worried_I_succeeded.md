This is a confession. Of what I did to a helpless child, yes. But more importantly, of what I’ve done to all of us.

\---

I flexed my fingers. That’s how you avoid arthritis in your later years, they say.

The incision ran the length of the scalp. Blood blossomed out in a slow trickle, like molasses. Soon the thin layer of shaved skin parted to reveal brilliant white. “We’ll do the burr now.” I said, flexing my fingers. The room filled with a piercing whir. It reminded me of the sound of dad’s old sander. That was a crude tool, I thought to myself, as metal slid into bone. This was precise work.

Glistening beneath the white glare of surgical lights was my destination: grey matter. A network of synapses and neurons more sophisticated than any computer. Forged by the twin mallets of biology and luck. The human brain.

Neurology is a lot older than most people think. Archeologists have found evidence that humans were drilling holes into their skulls before they’d figured out writing. Countless heads have been opened over the ages to learn more about the strange condition of consciousness. Attempts to observe the changes that one small tweak can create. Valiant efforts to remove and repair, extending life or healing mental illness. Some of our best and brightest have been interrogating that unassuming tangle of meat for centuries.

But as I grafted the *lacuna*, a small yellowish-red mass of flesh, to the most delicate organ of the human body, I was certain I alone walked across a new bridge in neural science, and in history. I was *adding* to us. I was *improving* upon the human. Changing not because the blind will of nature allowed for it, but because we *demanded* it. Untold millennia of neural development transpired over the course of a 15-hour stint in the operating room. A comparative blink of an eye. The attendant nurse offered to complete the last of the stitching so I could rest. I told him to leave.  

I alone walked across the bridge.

\---

I was nearly touching the glass, watching her. Her head was slightly misshapen – an unsavory result of the surgery’s novelty. It wouldn’t matter in the end. A thin layer of reddish fuzz already covered her scalp, once it grew longer no one would ever notice.

She silently read the dictionary in front of her with a furrowed brow. One of our earliest observations was a dislike for speech. This isn’t to say she was bad at it. In fact, she was multiple levels ahead of her age group. I understood. She preferred to listen. To study. I could see it in those pale eyes that darted so quickly over the page. 300 words per minute. Over double that of her would-be peers, and improving every day. She eventually closed the book with a heavy thud.

She slid it across the table, in front of her tutor. He smiled, and opened the book to a random page. A moment passed as he scanned, angling the book so she couldn’t peak at it. Her eyes stayed fixed on him with a dispassionate intensity. He didn’t notice.

He prompted her. “Renumeration.”

Her voice, quiet but certain, responded. “Page 589. Money paid for a service or work.”

He scoffed in disbelief before continuing. I was filled with pride.

\---

“She still sleeps for less than three hours a night, most nights.” A pang of concern shot through me. This trend had begun around one-year post-op. Her lack of sleep had been on and off since then, until two weeks ago. Now she was consistently failing to sleep. And the meds weren’t working.

Insufficient sleep during youth could severely stunt development in a control brain. There was no telling how negatively it could affect her. There was something else beneath the concern, though. A paternal rather than clinical anxiousness. This was an unwelcome feeling. Our relationship was, and would remain, a one-way mirror. We had never even interacted, which was a status quo I intended to keep. It helped keep me focused and objective. As I picked up and began to review her med sheet, the doctor continued, “She seems to go catatonic instead. Perhaps a type of ‘meditation’ is more accurate? She’s sensory, but not conscious.”

It was then I looked at her, through the viewing window and into her quarters. At that moment she was building a structure out of Legos. After she gingerly placed the final piece, she paused, as if to consider her creation. Before her was a well-made, if plain, looking building with one giant bottom story topped with a smaller second level. Her face rarely changed from its passive expression, and this moment was no exception. It remained unchanged even when she suddenly, in one sweeping motion, she sent the building across the room into a violent explosion of colorful plastic against the wall. The doctor and I took a moment to digest what we’d just seen. I flexed my fingers as I felt myself awash in another unexpected, unwelcome feeling. “Let’s begin some sleep studies. We’re overdue for that anyways.”

That same night I devised the Bedtime Protocol. Just in case. Of what, I wasn’t yet certain.

\---

“The activity is almost indistinguishable.” With the two scans of brain patterns side-by-side, I saw what she was saying. It’s meaning, however, was lost on me. It would normally be impossible for even an average person to mistake waking brain waves for sleeping ones. Annie’s, however, were indistinguishable. It’s as if no REM at all occurred during that semi-conscious catatonia of hers.

Many late nights were spent by the whole division on this issue. We started to reach a consensus that the *lacuna* may have diminished the need for sleep, at least as we understood it in control brains. One by one, our experts began to ruefully shrug their shoulders, insisting that as long as no other symptoms were showing that we just needed to keep her under observation. That sentiment almost made me laugh, for all it was worth. There was no corner of Annie’s existence that wasn’t already under observation. Still, eyes turned to the project leader as each of our leads came up empty. Finally, I said, “It’s possible she under-stimulated. She needs socialization.”

I had been entertaining the idea for weeks by then, and that seemed as good an opportunity as any to push for it. Deliberation over what ‘socialization’ entailed for Annie had luckily already concluded long ago, before the procedure had even taken place.

She would be given a pet rat.

\---

The incident happened at 2 A.M. I was not on call. But I did watch the footage after the fact.

Very quietly, as if she had never been asleep in the first place, Annie rose from her bed and padded over the cage in her room. Her hand reached in, and reemerged with her pet rat, Noodles, as it had hundreds of times in months prior. Annie had taken to the animal well enough, and spent much of her down time observing or interacting with it in some way. Oftentimes she spent the morning sitting with Noodles in her lap, gently petting him on the head with an index finger. Whatever else was true, I thought Noodles had made an excellent addition to her routine.

But she’d never gotten up in the dead of night for him. In the video, I saw how she held the rodent in her hands, lips moving lightly, as if she was speaking to it.

In a mechanical, almost rehearsed motion, she smashed Noodles against the corner of the table, killing him instantly. She gently set the body down and began working at it with her hands. Her back was to the camera at that point, obscuring what she’d been doing. After a minute or so, she could be seen tucking the body back into the cage and burying it in the bright blue and pink bedding. We’d let her pick those colors when she’d first gotten him.

An investigation the following morning found that Noodles had been peeled open from the top. One noteworthy absence from the corpse was later discovered under her pillow.

Its brain.

They conducted an interview with her before I’d returned to the facility that morning. After viewing the footage for the dozenth time, I asked the attending doctor if anything meaningful had come of the questioning.

Annie’s only explanation was, “I wanted to fix it.”

We replaced Noodles with a sealed fishtank. The glass was shatterproof.

\---

After the rat, it was easy enough to convince the others of the need. We were keeping her in an ancillary enclosure for the time being while we modified her permanent residence in accordance with the Bedtime Protocol. I observed as her tutor prompted her with questions about the problems sprawled across the table in front of them. She had taken up a recent interest in geometry, of all things. The division insisted it would be “psychologically beneficial” to entertain her curiosities. I had agreed.

Today they were working on something concerning ratios, or some such. At that stage of development, I had stopped concerning myself with the minutia of her lesson plans. Whatever she was learning looked like, to my outside observation, a canvas of beautiful shapes with numbers dissecting their hidden meaning.

Yet I felt a cold pit in my stomach as Annie pointed to a diagram on the opposite end of the table and asked, “Why isn’t this being treated as a right angle?”

To understand what was wrong with what she said, and why what happened next could have been prevented, you would have had to have spent years listening to Annie’s peculiar speech patterns as I had. Not since her first month of post-op had Annie asked a question. Even then, at the very start, they had only been questions about why her head hurt or where her father was. But then that stopped altogether. We had long ago learned that Annie’s questions were instead always framed as statements of fact: “I don’t understand why they’re not treating this as a right angle.”

Her asking a question in the traditional way was extremely out of character. Hence why upon hearing as much I sat up in my chair. This was only, however, that poor man’s second time one-on-one with Annie. His name was Clark, I believe, and he stood up slightly out of his chair and craned his head to get a better view of what she’d been pointing to.

I was almost unsurprised when she brought the sharp edge of a mathematical compass up into his neck. The pattern in which the blood immediately ejected across the table in sputtering, pressurized bursts told me that she had hit the artery. He shoved her hard and cried for help, not realizing he was already dead.

Annie wasted no time. Her hands hurriedly worked at the keys on his hip while he slumped against the table and feebly attempted to staunch his wound with his hand. He opened his mouth as if to protest, instead pouring more crimson onto the beautiful shapes and angles they’d been studying a moment ago. She had just gotten the door open when the orderlies arrived to stop her. It was all over in thirty seconds.

The tutor, Clark, bled to death on the way to the infirmary. A later interrogation with her revealed that Annie had committed the specific key pattern of the door to memory. There had been nine keys on his ring. Had she feigned an interest in geometry just to get a hold of that compass? A weapon?

I filed a request to expedite the work on her new residence. It was approved. 

\---

“Fainting could be caused by anything.” I took off my glasses and rubbed the tiredness out of my eyes, replying “Yes, very helpful.” Fainting spells were the newest puzzle about our Annie, and one that bore much greater potential for her to injure herself than the others. Our first thought was that she’d had an adverse reaction to the agent used during the Bedtime Protocol. We’d had to use it on three separate occasions since the equipment was installed, and after each successive use the fainting spells only became more frequent. Our training for tutors had changed significantly since those early days. More than just a focus on learning objectives and benchmarks, tutors had to be taught how to defend themselves from her.

But the fainting was new. Multiple physicals, diet changes, allergy screening, CAT scans, PET scans, the works. We couldn’t make heads or tails of it. Then one day, it stopped without ceremony. Annie fainted no more.

Even so, there were many sleepless nights in the observation room. Meticulous monitoring and cataloguing her every action. Nights spent just watching her breathe. Our special project, our *lacuna*. She was something more than human, and obviously resented her captivity. But why exactly? This facility was all she’d known for most of her life. Even in less-than-ideal circumstances, humans have the remarkable ability to acclimate. Even through interrogations, she’d never articulated the exact reason behind her escape attempts.

For all the years spent on every facet of her existence, I still had endless questions for her. Did she know how important she was? How many hundreds of thousands of man hours had been spent on her by now? What did she know about what was on the other side of the mirror? She was my creation. Other members of the division had come and gone, each only seeing a piece of the journey. The only constant had been us. Us walking across the bridge.

Yet I was separated from her. Cut off by a sheet of glass that may well have been the gulf between the earth and sun.

Even so, one night spent watching her, I could not shake the most unsettling feeling that I’d yet had.

The feeling that she knew me.

\---

When you’re focused on something to the point of obsession, everything else has a way of sneaking up on you. As the scope of the project was becoming bigger picture, so did the division. More experts for Annie’s care and study required more funding. More funding required more oversight. More oversight meant more outside penetration to the relatively small team that I’d kept for the life of the program.

I hadn’t realized it, but the reigns had been slowly getting wrenched away from me. For all the trouble we’d had with Annie, she’d been a marked success. What was a few casualties compared to the promise of redefining human achievement? She was barely into puberty and had already surpassed your average doctoral student in her critical reasoning skills. Her powers of observation were obviously well above the average person, possibly even greater than she let on. The lack of sleep, which had progressed to near zero, was worth the price of admission alone. Her aggression was explained away by the circumstances of confinement, the stressors of her living conditions. These outside factors frustrated the otherwise uncomplicated victory that was the *lacuna*. Suddenly, Annie was everyone’s success.

People from outside the program began to make demands. They wanted to “better define” the outer parameters of her abilities. What they really meant by this was that they wanted to see her perform parlor tricks. Tourists holding the purse strings wanted to see how Annie performed on standardized tests. Then specialized tests. Then they wanted to gauge if her physical aptitude had been improved by the *lacuna.* We had long ago tested and confirmed her overachievement in these areas. That didn’t matter. They wanted it done on their terms.

I did what I could to shield her from this interference. A sense of protectiveness over my project, my Annie, had gotten the better of me. Because I was so busy contesting the whims of our stakeholders, I didn’t see the planets slowly aligning. A disaster written in the stars, if I hadn’t been too stupid to notice. Sometimes, I wonder if she’d somehow been responsible for that, too.  

\---

It was the night before everything fell apart.

Drowsiness had nearly overcome me by then, but I snapped to full attention when I saw her sit up in bed. A deviation from routine. Reflexively, I found my hand hovering over the switch to initiate the Protocol.

She made no rash movements. The white of her bedclothes and her curly red hair stood out against the blueish, artificial nighttime of her quarters. Only the dim, watery light of her fishtank illuminated the room. There was a certain softness to her at that moment, one that stood out against the detached person I’d always known her to be. I remember thinking that I had been right all those years ago. To the average person, she would look completely normal.

Slowly, she got up. Then, with all the weightlessness of a ghost, she padded over to the viewing window. My face burned when she came to a stop at the very center, directly in front of me. Annie stood all of three feet away from me, and for no discernable reason. A deviation from routine. Still, I did not initiate the Protocol.

Impossibly, we looked at one another through the window. She could see nothing but her reflection. Yet I could feel our eyes meet. An eternal barrier, carefully maintained between us for the entirety of the program, suddenly gone. I felt utterly exposed, naked. The wizard behind the curtain no more. In that vulnerability, I awaited a terror to finally befall me as it had the others. I waited for her to scream, to throw herself against the plexiglass, to bludgeon her head against it and shatter every bone in her face. She did something much worse.

Annie began crying. Her usually placid expression silently broke, like porcelain shattering in space. This display quietly unfolded before me, and I found myself unable to reconcile what was happening. Unless it was from physical pain, Annie had never shed a tear.

She closed her eyes, pressing her hand and forehead against the glass. Her mouth began moving. Out of body, I flipped the interior microphone back on.

“Please… you can still let me out… we can still leave this place…” A voice, like that of the girl she’d been before, choked out these words. “Please…”

I could do nothing. Had I moved, whatever I did next would have been out of my control.

After a long moment, her sobs quieted. She pulled herself away from the window. Her face was stone again, and she wordlessly turned around and settled back into her bed. After a few minutes, I summoned another nurse to take over observation. I left the facility, and made the dark drive to my empty corner of facility housing.

For the first time in the eleven years since the operation, I cried for my daughter.

\---

The next morning was the beginning of her triannual examination. The purpose of these tests, a recent invention of the expanded division, was to get an exhaustive read on Annie’s professional aptitudes. Though they spanned the course of a few days, they were “necessary” to locate her benchmarks and set new ones. They had quickly become some of the most tedious days of the project.

Nonetheless, I planned to be in attendance. If they were going to have us frivolously poke and prod her, I was going to ensure it was over as quickly as possible. Still, I had arrived late thanks to the events of the night before.

A custodian was in Annie’s empty room, fiddling with something in the unlocked panel of her fishtank. An attending doctor, one of the handful of holdovers from the old division, was tidying up the observation area. “Just missed her, doc. They just took her to Room C for the exam.” As we continued to make small talk, my eyes drifted back to the custodian’s work. The water of the tank was slowly draining, and I saw that a small constellation of bodies bobbed limply on the surface. Nearly a dozen fish, belly up.

“What happened there?” I asked. The doctor ruefully replied, “Oh. Not sure. He said it was probably the filter going bad.” I watched the fish rock back and forth with the sway of the vanishing water. “Huh.”

Just as she had in past examinations, Annie sat down and followed instructions. The padded baton affixed to the proctor’s hip belied a different truth than that obedience. It had become a standard issue for all personnel that interacted with her directly.

For the better part of the day, the examination proceeded as drearily as it always had. Outside, it was nearly 7 PM, and dusk was falling. Near the finish line.

Then Annie had a seizure.

First sign was when she went to take a sip of water and instead pushed the cup off the desk. Loss of fine motor skills. The proctor flinched and backed away at the sound, but Annie merely spasmed and began arching her neck backwards, bending so far I thought that her spine would break. She’d had one once before, shortly after the operation, but it was nothing compared to this.

The attendant medical director immediately called a code. I remember feeling thankful she was there, since I found myself frozen. An unspoken, long-held fear of the division was finally coming to pass. Many of my colleagues had anticipated that my novel surgery wouldn’t take, and that any number of complicators would lead to an untimely conclusion. With each year, that fear vanished over the horizon, until the naysayers had all moved on to different projects. But now it was happening. Her body was rejecting the *lacuna*, and it was going to kill her. As I watched her writhe and seize, two of the medical staff now doing their best to restrain her, I felt like it was going to kill me, too.

Each of the med staff began their lifesaving efforts in earnest. One leaned down to check her heart rate, probably trying to confirm or deny cardiac arrest. The other began preparing oxygen. I’d begun to fall so deep into myself that I didn’t notice Annie stop seizing. It took the hysteric scream to bring me back to reality. My eyes swam back into focus, and I joined the others in the observation deck in witnessing a murder.

Annie’s mouth was coated in red. She’d bitten the one of the medic’s face so fiercely that most of his right cheek was now an angry red hole. He thrashed away in instant agony, now unable to form words. The other medic stumbled backwards in shock. Annie’s right foot was already hooked around her ankle, causing her to fall hard to the ground. It didn’t take more than a moment for her to bring the supplemental oxygen tank the medic had been preparing high above her head and down onto the woman’s skull. On the second strike her cries took on a strange, hoarse quality. I imagined a face caved in, struggling to make a passage wide enough to scream. On the third blow, she fell silent.

Out of my stupor, I lurched forward and triggered the Bedtime Protocol. Small apertures in the sealing began hissing loudly, flooding the room with a scentless, colorless sleep agent. The door to the examination room relocked itself. I dimly heard someone else in the room begin to call for security. Annie stalked the proctor around the room like a lion in a cage.

She still held her newly bloodied weapon in her hands, while he did his honest best to keep the bolted down exam desk between the two of them. “Annie! Stop! Stop!” He pointed the baton towards her, clutching it fiercely in both hands. It was difficult to hear anything over the continued wailing of the medic she’d bitten. Annie must’ve thought the same thing, because as she paced past him, she brought the oxygen tank into a baseball swing against his temple. It was odd, seeing the way his head didn’t split, but instead just dented inwards at an unnaturally severe angle. A blood bruise slowly began to darken the skin around the blow, but it wouldn’t for much longer. He’d be dead in a second. Then the hiss of the agent filling the room was the only sound left.

Thirty seconds. That’s how long it would take for the gas to saturate the space. A lot could happen in that time, sure. But given how the proctor managed to keep his distance, I thought he was going to make it. He was much larger than her, as well, and could have defended himself long enough from a young woman for them both to lose consciousness. He was following our self defense training to the letter, which is what killed him in the end. Personnel were not supposed to physically engage Annie, for risk of injuring the miracle of medicine rattling around in her skull. But as his movements became sluggish and uncoordinated, hers remained steady.

Security was now posted outside of the examination door, but someone in the division was arguing that they needed to wait for the Protocol to kick in. Given the violence, there was a high risk that she’d injure herself resisting. Always avoiding that altercation. Their squabble was far away in my mind. I could only study my creation. She was calm. As if this was just another examination.

A loud thud broke the tension as he hit the floor. The proctor finally surrendered to the agent. Impossibly, Annie didn’t. She loomed over him for a moment, as if curious. The tank was set on the floor with a dull clank as she traded it for the padded baton. Her pale blue eyes cast a sideways glance to the viewing window. To me. Then she set to work.

For over a minute, she bludgeoned the helpless proctor. Down came the baton, again and again. Painting the room, the window, Annie, in scarlet. It hadn’t been a particularly dangerous tool, meant for self defense really. Nor was she all that physically strong. I suppose that’s why it took so long to reduce his head to the red pool that she did.

A new argument had broken out around me about why the sleep agent wasn’t taking. Conversation about what to do next began, division members struggling to find consensus. But as I watched Annie’s attack, I realized. Her chest wasn’t moving, her mouth remained tight-lipped. Finally, in the midst of this crisis, I spoke, “She isn’t breathing.” She hadn’t been since I’d initiated the Protocol. All of nearly three minutes now, and with such physical activity. How?

After a moment, another realization, months too late, dawned on me. The fainting spells. Each time increasing in frequency after successful implementation of the Protocol. She’d been practicing holding her breath to the point of fainting. At some point, she decided she could long enough. There was no telling how long that was, and I never found out.

Dropping the soaked baton, he returned to the tank. Annie fished the oxygen mask out of the medical bag, and methodically connected the tubing. “Oh my god.” Someone muttered in disbelief. Some part of me was filled with hideous pride.

Placing the mask over her face, she twisted the nozzle to flood herself with fresh oxygen. Still, she took a controlled breath in, as if conserving what she had. It stayed in her hands as she moved over and sat on the desk, cross legged. Whatever monstrous reasons she had for this tantrum could be delt with later. But what damage she could do had been done.

My helpless colleagues continued to falter. Suddenly, something came over me. Of course this had happened. For too long, I’d left Annie in the care of people who couldn’t hope to understand her. We had all agreed that my presence would only prove a distressing distraction. But now, only I could fix this. It was our bridge to cross, no one else’s.

I turned on the observation microphone, and for the first time in over a decade, spoke to her. “Annie. Are you finished with your outburst?”

No one made a sound. A break from routine.

Annie didn’t respond. She simply stared back through the window at us, the members of the division. At me. “Clever thinking with the air supply. I suppose you’ve been paying more attention than they’ve all been giving you credit for.” Another pause, nothing. “But we both know it won’t last forever. You’re going under in the next ten minutes, regardless.” Did she even recognize my voice anymore?

“So, I’d like you to make the most of this moment. Nobody else here is going to listen to you. But I will.”

The hiss of the apertures. “Tell me why you’ve done this. What do you want, Annie?”

Her face had taken on a strange, distant quality as I spoke to her. A long silence gripped the division as we awaited something, anything to happen. For a long while, it seemed this would end in an unceremonious standoff. It took me another moment to realize that it wasn’t just a faraway look. Annie was in that catatonia of hers, that place of waking consciousness she had long ago replaced sleep with.

The man standing next to me was a doctor that had worked with the division for seven years. I’d had lunch with him yesterday. We’d joked about our alma mater. I turned to him as he made a burbling, then popping noise. A majority of the blood in his brain was ejecting through his tear ducts.

He fell first to the desk, then to the floor, dead. There was a strange crease crossing over his face diagonally, as if some great pressure had pressed the top and bottom half of his head together. A scream, more pained than the rest, rose up in the already scrambling room of white coats. The doctor I’d been speaking to that morning had joined us shortly after the exam began. She was clutching her chest, her face twisted into a confused and tragic expression. With an earthy crack, the front of her clavicle bowed outwards. There was a queer shape to the internal explosion of the wound. As she collapsed, allowing me a different angle to the carnage, I realized what I was looking at. It was the impression of a hand, pressing out from inside of her body.

Annie was in the room with us. She’d never been asleep.

People crashing together, a mad dash to the door. Esteemed academics and medical experts, now clamoring over one another, all pretenses gone. Just a desperation to survive. Rats in a cage. The observation door wouldn’t open. If Annie could do this, it wouldn’t have been hard to jam a door. Seeing no escape, I pondered all that had happened in my time in the program.

A tutor, one of Annie’s oldest, began vomiting a mix of bloody bile and intestinal lining. Some of her puzzles began to make more sense to me. One of the division stakeholders, who wanted to personally see how his little investment was coming along today, folded in half until the back of his head touched his ankles. She’d been walking around the facility all along, out of body. A security guard, ex-military, screaming himself raw as Annie churned his insides, displacing his organs, causing him to bulge into a less than human shape. A building thrown against the wall, an explosion of colorful plastic. The newer nurse, one who had immediately been itching for an opportunity to leave the program, had her windpipe eject from the left side of her neck, as if it was a burst pipe. One-way mirrors. A constellation of dead fish, bobbing back and forth.

It was over. This facility wasn’t as you’d see in movies, equipped with a full military dispatch in body armor. Our single security interest, for over a decade, had been an adolescent girl.

The rampage moved beyond the room I was trapped in, but all was quiet after a few minutes. I sat on the rim of the observation desk, trying to get as little blood on my shoes as possible. For some reason, that mattered to me in that moment. Out of my periphery, I saw a movement in the exam room.

Moments later, I heard the soft click of the observation room door. Together at last. Annie stood all of ten feet away from me, an ocean of red between us. She walked across its surface, staring at me with that inscrutable face of hers.

Now she was only a foot from me. It was hard to recognize her – as my project, my patient, my daughter. Everyone’s success. Her voice, for the first time alighting on the air and not through a speaker, reached me, “You asked me what I want.” She leaned in, and a wry smile spread across her face for the first time since I turned her into this.

What she said next, she said with all the playfulness of a deeply held inside joke between us.

With it, she turned around and left me. Annie disappeared out of the room, and then the facility. Somewhere out there, Annie felt the cold night air of the desert we were stationed in for the first time in her living memory. I wonder how long she took to drink it in. Not too long, of course, since we never found her.

\---

I conclude my confession with this. We’d all better be very careful from now on. Because I loosed something more than human upon us. And if she is anything like her father, her final words to me carry a terrible meaning.

“I want to fix us.”
