My brother killed my mother.


He did it in the shadow of the lighthouse. He did it in the dark, where you couldn't see the ivy twisting up the lighthouse bricks, where you couldn't see anything but the night and those things that wished to be seen within it. He split her open at the ribs. He shoveled her insides into his mouth, starting with her lungs before finishing with her heart. 

I know this because I watched him do it. 

Wesley smiled at me while he ate, the sweeping beam of the lighthouse casting his features in an ethereal glow. “I’m doing this for you, little brother,” he rasped between mouthfuls. “I’m doing this for all of us. Someday, you'll understand." 

That was an eternity ago. Thirty years, give or take, and I still don't understand. I doubt I ever will. 

I was only three years old at the time. What I was doing there with Wesley, how I even got there, I can't recall. It's a labyrinth of memories, a maze I've never stepped inside for fear of losing myself within it.

All I know for certain is that Harriet found us. My sister. She wandered down from the cottage, calling our names for supper. I remember her lantern bobbing in the black, her light spilling across us, her look of nausea as she saw Wesley's blood-stained teeth and our mother's twitching limbs. The scream she loosed sent ravens flying from afar. 

Father came running. He appeared with a hatchet, and I think he would've taken Wesley's head if the bastard hadn't run. He tore off into the dark. He ran right into the Phantom Wood, that clutch of pines and oaks we were forbidden to enter, and that was the last time any of us ever saw him. 

"He's dead," Father told us. "The wood devoured him the same as he devoured her."

If you ask my sister, she'll say it wasn't my fault. Harriet insists that there's nothing I could've done, that I was only three years old, and Wesley was seventeen, and if I'd so much as made a peep, he'd have killed me too. But Father insists differently. 

Or at least he did. 

He's dead now. Harriet found him strung up from a tree, hanging limply in the autumn sunset, his corpse dressed in hungry crows. Two sticks jutted from his eyes. Sigils had been carved roughly into his cheeks. Pieces of him that belonged inside were spilled out onto the yellow grass, while his intestines wound a twisting trail toward the Phantom Wood. 


*I won't follow them,* Harriet wrote in her letter. *The intestines, I mean. I know that's what it wants me to do, whatever killed him. I saw him speaking with the Decrepit One recently, down by the creek, but you don't think that she could be involved, do you?*

The implication sent a shiver across my spine. The Decrepit One was a creature my family knew well, an ancient being that held vast, terrifying power. She had long sought control of our land, our lighthouse, and I hated to think of what she might do if she got that, but this didn't sound like her. The Decrepit One cared little for theatrics.  She took lives with ruthless efficiency, not ritual torment. 

This was different. Whatever had killed Father had done so with rehearsed cruelty, taking care to leave a spectacle behind. It wasn't murder. It was desecration. Father's corpse represented a message, but what that message was, I couldn't say.   

Harriet had her own thoughts.

*It's an omen, Jasper. Even I know that. You can't run from this. You can't hide from it because we're tied to this land. Our blood belongs here.*


Tears pockmarked the page. Her writing became sloppy, haphazard, and hardly legible beneath the smudged ink. 

Father's words echoed in my mind. The last words he spoke to me. He told me that abandoning Gloomfall meant consequences far beyond our land, that the horrors our lighthouse kept at bay would begin to seep into the rest of the world, corrupting it, haunting it. 

Eventually, possessing it. 


*You want the truth? The truth is that I'm afraid that whatever killed dad is going to come back, and when it does, I'm not sure I can deal with it alone. I need you, Jasper. I've never asked you to come home, but I'm asking now. If only for a while. Think about it, would you?*

*-Harri*


My eyes scanned the words. Once. Twice. Half a dozen times. Tears leaked down my cheeks, and I wiped them away, crumpling the letter in my fist. Ten years. Ten long years, I'd been gone, adjusting to normal life, forgetting my nightmares, moving past my guilt, and finding a slice of happiness. And now this. 

Harriet was calling me back.


"You've gotta be kidding me..." I seethed, pacing my bedroom. 

My mind raced for a reason to throw it in the trash. To forget I ever read it. I hated Gloomfall, the lighthouse, the wood-- but what I hated most of all was that Harriet was right. Father's death was an omen. I knew that better than anyone. Omens belonged to me. Father called them a gift, but if he'd seen them, he'd know they were a curse. 

I'd seen things. Always. As a boy, I saw our chickens stricken with disease long before the illness ever came. I saw storms before we ever felt the rain. I saw creatures, awful and twisted, picking apart travellers through the Phantom Wood, feasting on their bones and drinking deep of their blood. I saw all of it the same way I'd seen my brother eat my mother, a week before her heart ever touched his lips. 

Tragedy. That was all the omens were. They told stories of grief and pain, and I thought if I left Gloomfall, then maybe I could save my family their torment. Salvage what remained. I hoped that deep down, all of the terrible things we suffered were actually my fault. That I just took my omens and left, then all of it would go away. 

"Idiot," I said to the mirror, shaking my head. "Nothing but wishful thinking, was it?" I knew then that my life wasn't the sort of bad dream I got to wake up from. I never would. The lighthouse was calling to me, pulling at my mind, begging me to return to it. 

So I did.

Like a whirlwind, I swept my keys from the counter and flew down the apartment steps. I couldn't stop and think. If I did, I might do the smart thing and reconsider. I might turn back. I flung open my car door, got inside, and twisted the key in the engine. It rumbled to life. My foot hit the gas pedal. I backed out of the driveway, then I backed out of the city, my job, my happiness. I backed out of the only peace I'd ever known and hit the open road, driving toward hell on earth. 

I drove a thousand miles. Then I drove a thousand more. 

I drove on until the road turned to gravel, to dirt, until it ended in the heart of a forgotten forest. Only then did I hit the brakes. A knot of trees rose before me, their limbs twisting and interweaving as if to create an archway. From the branches hung red-orange leaves, swaying weakly with the cold breath of autumn. 

I gazed into that tangle of wood, that ocean of darkness so pure that even my headlights couldn't pierce its surface. My fingers trembled as I opened the car door, my knees nearly buckling as I took my first steps onto that ancient land. My breath fogged in front of me. Even here, on the outskirts, I felt fearing seeping into me. It infested me like insects, scurrying across my mind. 

Such was the magic of the Phantom Wood. 

I pulled my jacket tighter about myself, stalking around my car to the dull crunch of leaves. My fingers found the cold metal of the trunk. I opened it. Inside was a lantern along with a bag of letters. I'd written them hastily. They described things I was looking forward to. Things I cherished. My father taught me a long time ago that safe passage through the Phantom Wood didn't come freely; you had to prove you deserved it. You needed to light your way with your will to live. 

I lit a letter aflame, stuffing it inside the lantern housing. It crackled. The paper curled as black smoke swam upward, providing me a dim glow. It wasn't much. It was hardly enough to see my own two feet, but it'd have to do. My only hope was I'd written enough letters to last me the trip. Gloomfall was hours away. 

If I had more time, I would have written a surplus. But I didn't. Truth was, I had no time at all. 

Like I said, omens belong to me. I own them. The night before Harriet's letter arrived, I'd been visited by a new omen, a fresh one in the form of a dream. In it, I saw a being. A vast creature with eyes of burning embers and long, crooked limbs. It sat perched above a body. A woman's. Her hair was the color of chestnuts, and her eyes were an ocean blue, but she had a head that was lying six feet from her corpse.

A head that belonged to my [sister.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1651jtd/i_inherited_a_lighthouse_in_the_woods_but_im_not/)
