My brother killed my mother.


He did it in the shadow of the lighthouse. He split her open and shoveled her insides into his mouth, starting with her lungs before finishing with her heart. 

I know this because I watched him do it. 

Wesley smiled at me while he ate, the sweeping beam of the lighthouse casting his features in an ethereal glow. “I’m doing this for you, little brother,” he rasped between bites. “I’m doing this for all of us, you know. Someday, you'll understand."


That was thirty years ago.


At the time, I was only three. The whole thing played out like a bad dream, like some twisted vignette I couldn't quite process. How I got there, what I was doing there, I still have no idea. All I know is that Harriet found us. My sister. She came calling, her lantern bobbing in the dark, and when she saw Wesley's blood-soaked lips and our mothers twitching corpse, she let out a scream that sent ravens flying from far.

Our father ran over. He came running with a hatchet, but by then, Wesley had already fled. He'd torn off into the dark. He'd run right into the Phantom Wood, that clutch of pines and oaks we were warned to steer clear of at all costs, and just like that, we never saw him again. Dead, Father said. Devoured by the trees just the same as he'd devoured mom. 


Harriet will tell you it wasn't my fault. She'll say that there was nothing I could've done, that I was just three years old, and that Wesley was seventeen, and that if I had made a sound he would've slit my throat as easily as he'd slit our mother's. But my father would tell you differently. 

Or at least, he would have if he were still alive. 

Harriet sent me a letter today. In it, she said father was dead, that she'd found him strung up from a tree, hanging limply in the autumn sunset. Sticks pierced his eyes. Sigils had been carved into his cheeks. His stomach had been cut open, and his blood soaked the dry leaves while his intestines wound a twisting path into the Phantom Wood.


*I won't follow the intestines,* Harriet wrote in the letter. *I think that's what they want me to do - whatever killed him, I mean. I still don't know what it was. I saw him speaking with the Decrepit One recently, down there by the creek. You don't think that monster's involved, do you?*


I shuddered. The Decrepit One was a creature my family knew well, an ancient being that held vast, terrifying power. It had long sought control of Gloomfall Lighthouse, and I hated to think of what it might do if it got that control, but this didn't sound like its handiwork. The Decrepit One cared little for theatrics.  It took lives with ruthless efficiency, not ritual torment. No, whatever had killed our father had desecrated his corpse to send a message. The question was, what message?


The letter continued. Judging by Harriet's sudden change in tone, I guessed that she'd found some booze to numb her grief. 


*It's an omen, Jasper. Fuck! Even I know that. If you still think you can run from home-- from Gloomfall, then you're wrong. We're tied to this land. Our blood belongs here. If we abandon it, then it's only a matter of time until the darkness takes the lighthouse. We can't let that happen. You know that. YOU KNOW THAT!*


Tears pockmarked the page. The writing became sloppy, haphazard, and hardly legible beneath the smudged ink. I sighed. Harriet was right. We'd both heard Father's sermons plenty, and he made it clear that abandoning Gloomfall meant consequences far beyond our land. The horrors the lighthouse kept at bay would begin to seep into the rest of the world. Corrupting it. Haunting it. 


*With father gone, I need you back. I'm afraid that whatever killed him is going to return, and if it got Father, then... Please, Jasper, just come home, will you?*


My eyes scanned the words. Once. Twice. Half a dozen times. Tears leaked down my cheeks, and I wiped them away, crumpling the letter in my fist. Ten years. Ten long years, I'd been gone. I'd been adjusting to normal life, forgetting my trauma, moving past my guilt and my pain, and finding some slice of happiness. Now this. 

Harriet was calling me back.


"Un-fucking-believable..." I muttered, pacing my bedroom, shaking my head. "You've gotta be kidding me!"


I hated home. I hated the lighthouse. I hated the Phantom Wood. Most of all, I hated that the more I read Harriet's letter, the more I realized she was right. Father's death *was* an omen. I knew that better than anyone. 


Omens belonged to me. They were my curse. My burden. They were the entire reason I'd left, the reason I'd abandoned home and buried myself in the monotony of an office job. 


I'd seen things. Always. As a boy, I saw our chickens stricken with disease long before the illness ever came. I saw distant storms before we ever felt the rain. I saw creatures from the Phantom Wood, saw them picking off travellers, hikers, and tearing into them in the dark. I saw all of this the same way I'd seen my brother eat my mother, a week before her heart ever touched his lips. 


I'd seen so much future tragedy, so much pain in Gloomfall that I thought if I left, then maybe I could save my family. I hoped *I* was the cause of it all. That maybe everything was my fault, and all I had to do was leave to make it all go away.  

 
But of course, that was wishful thinking. My nightmare wasn't the sort I could wake up from. Not now. Not ever. Sooner or later, I realized I'd have to go back-- and the longer I waited, the worse it'd get. 

It's the reason I left that night.

I flung open my car door, slumped into the driver seat and turned the ignition. There was only one choice left to me. There'd only ever been one. My foot hit the gas, and I left the city behind, along with my job, along with my happiness, along with the only peace I'd ever known. 

I left it all. 

I drove a thousand miles, then I drove a thousand more. I drove on and on until the road turned to gravel, then dirt, then ended entirely as I found myself deep in the heart of a forgotten wood. A cluster of trees rose in front of me like an archway, red-orange leaves clutched their frail branches, swaying in the autumn breeze. 

I gazed ahead, gazed into that tangle of wood so dark that even my headlights couldn't pierce it. My fingers trembled as I opened the car door. My knees nearly buckled as I took my first, crunchy, steps onto the dead leaves of that ancient land. Fear filled me. It infested me like a family of insects scurrying across my mind, making me shrink and shrivel. 

The Phantom Wood.  

Shivering, I opened my trunk. Inside was a lantern along with a bag of letters. They described things I was looking forward to. Things I cherished. My father taught me a long time ago that there was only one safe path through the Phantom Wood, and to walk it, you needed to prove you deserved safe passage. You had to light your way with your own will to live. 

I lit a letter aflame. Stuffed it inside the lantern housing. It crackled and popped, curling as black smoke swam upward, fogging the glass. The glow was dim, but it'd have to do. Normally, I'd have written a surplus of letters, but tonight, I didn't have the luxury. Time was everything. My only hope was I'd scribbled enough to last me the trip because if I hadn't, then I'd soon be begging for death. 

See, the night before Harriet's message came, I'd seen another omen. This one came to me in a dream. In it was a crooked shadow with eyes of burning embers. It stood over a woman, small and pale with auburn hair, and a head lying six feet from her body. 

A head that belonged to my sister.
