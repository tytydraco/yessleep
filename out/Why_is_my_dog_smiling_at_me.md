Max was an outside dog. Always had been. Rain, snow, or shine, he’d never once begged to come inside. His place was in the yard, under the open sky, guarding his territory. But tonight was different. It wasn’t the weather—though the cold gnawed at my bones—it was him. Max scratched at the door with a desperation I’d never heard before, his whimper low and mournful, almost like a baby crying. It sent a chill crawling up my spine.

At first, I tried to ignore it, figuring he’d calm down eventually, like he always did. He was a tough dog, after all. But the sound only got louder—more frantic, more urgent. Each scratch against the wood made my nerves fray. I couldn’t take it anymore. “Alright, alright,” I grumbled, dragging myself to the door.

When I opened it, Max darted in without hesitation. His tail was tucked tight between his legs, his eyes wide and frantic, darting around the room like he expected something to leap out at him. I’d never seen him like this before—shaking, almost vibrating with fear.

“Max, what’s wrong, buddy?” I asked, kneeling down to his level. He stuck to me like glue, his whimpering relentless, even as I tried to comfort him with soft words and reassuring pats. But he didn’t seem to hear me. His body was rigid, his muscles tense. I chalked it up to coyotes or maybe a distant thunderstorm spooking him. He’d never been scared of much before, but there’s a first time for everything.

Then, I noticed something odd. Max wasn’t wearing his collar.

I frowned. I’d clipped it on him just this morning before I left for work. He never took it off. “Did it fall off outside, buddy?” I asked, reaching to pet him. But he flinched at my touch, shrinking away from me like I was a stranger. That wasn’t like Max—not the Max I knew.

The hours ticked by. I couldn’t shake the unease creeping over me. Every time I glanced at him, he was already staring at me. Not his usual, loving gaze, but something colder. More calculating. His eyes, normally full of warmth, seemed empty, like they belonged to something else entirely.

Then came the barking.

It echoed from the yard, loud and desperate, a sound I recognized instantly. It was Max—or at least, it sounded exactly like him. But that couldn’t be possible. Max was here. Right here in the house.

Heart pounding, I crept to the window and peeked outside. My breath caught in my throat. There, in the yard, was Max. The real Max. His tail wagged weakly as he let out another pitiful whimper, his eyes locked on the house. He looked cold and scared, but alive. Alive and real.

I turned back to the dog in my living room, my chest tightening. He was still staring at me, but now... he was smiling. Not a dog’s smile—a grotesque, impossible grin that stretched wider and wider, his jaw cracking as if unhinged. His limbs began to lengthen, twisting and contorting until he stood on two distorted legs, towering over me.

“Why’d you let me in?” it hissed, the voice no longer belonging to anything earthly. It was deep, guttural, and filled with malice.

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. The thing that stood before me wasn’t Max. It never had been.
