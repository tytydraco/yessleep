Before we get into this, I need to make one thing clear: Cory Dittmer is dead. Dead and buried, put into the earth fifteen years ago after a car accident had robbed him of several fingers, a leg, and the right hemisphere of his skull. I know it firsthand, because I was there when his broken and bruised body was lifted and pulled from the burning wreckage of his F-150. I saw the mucus flush out of his nose while his limp body was laid out on the ground. I saw the moment he died, because it was my fault. Because I was the one that caused his death.



I'm not proud of it, and it's something that I've been dealing with, using the assistance of a multitude of medications, after the first few years had been spent staring down the necks of empty bottles, seeking just one more drop of blissful numbness. I have the full understanding that what happened was, by all means, an accident: I had a blowout on my driver side steer tire, it caused me to swerve, and by a form of luck that must have been designed by the devil himself, Cory was directly in my path.



I saw his truck roll. I think I heard him scream, or at least begin to before a heinous harmony of crunching metal and bone put a quick end to it. That could have been a mercy, I've been telling myself, that maybe he died before the truck stopped rolling. But I also know that, in the end, it's impossible to really know, and that kind of wishful thinking only serves to comfort the person that survives. I was at his funeral. I apologized to his sobbing parents, getting on my hands and knees despite the cast I had to wear causing me to stagger. The man is as dead as dead gets. 



So why did he knock on my door two weeks ago? 



I guess now is as appropriate a time as any for some background on myself. For the purposes of anonymity, as good as that'll likely do me, you can call me Riley. I'm in my mid-30s now, and for the majority of my life I've been struggling with substance abuse of a variety that, to be frank, would be meaningless to divulge. I've been clean for a while now.



There's just something about taking a life, even accidentally, that stays with you, sticks to you, in ways you don't expect until it happens. The human mind is hard-wired to memorize and photograph images that bring you stress in the present moment. The evolutionary purpose of this, so far as I'm aware, is to prevent you from putting yourself in the same context that gave you that stress in the first place. The drawback of that, of course, is the constant reminders of the guilt, the agony. Seeing their face in places they have no right being. Catching a phantom whiff of blood as you sit down to drink your morning coffee. 



As time passes, trauma can sometimes become routine. It becomes a part of your daily life, and after my recovery, I was able to start working, both physically and mentally, to try and regain a control of my life that I had lost in the crash. With enough time, open wounds closed, and became ugly scars that would force themselves in front of my eyes, just to make sure I couldn't forget. I had saved up a nest egg, got my affairs in order, and bought some property in the wilderness of a certain mountainous state. Some time for construction later, and I was the proud new owner of a hermit's trauma shack, complete with all the amenities someone like me needs. Extra locks, hardwood paneling, a rain catcher, a fancy pneumatic bathroom system, and the best WiFi someone thirty miles from the nearest post office can afford. 



Maybe it was a way of punishing myself, of getting away from everything. I've never been particularly close to my family, so when it happened, it could have been the perfect excuse to seclude myself. It sounds horrible, I know, but I learned a long time ago that sometimes, selfishness can benefit you. I finally had peace and quiet, finally had time to sit with my own mind without any outside influence, and just when I was starting to approach the point where I was making a new routine for myself, the knock came. 



It was quiet at first, and so I didn't immediately catch on to what the noise was. As silly as it sounds, at that moment, I thought, “a woodpecker? In September?”, before the knocking grew to a volume and depth that left no mistake as to what it was. At the time, I think I was more confused than anything else. Had a package been delivered to me? What could it be, by who? Did a family member die? Why not call me, then? Although the confusion held me in place for a few moments, the knocking never actually stopped. It kept on, at a steady pace, a 'one, hut, two, hut, three, hut” sort of pattern, evenly paced out, but growing in intensity. By the time I had reached the door, all I wanted to do was to put and end to the sound. Now I'm wondering if bearing it would have been better than this. 



When I opened the door, it was as though time froze. What little wind there was died out in my ears, what birdsong surrounded my cabin was snuffed out as easily as a candle's flame in a blizzard. What stood in front of me was, of course, Cory Dittmer. Dressed up in the same gaudy suit jacket and vest he was wearing in the photo placed above his casket at the funeral; the one he had worn to his prom night, that his father had passed down to him, matching the details all the way down to the fake orange flower in the chest pocket. The spitting image of that picture. Younger than how he was in death. 



I would have fainted, if he hadn't reached forward to rest a warm, solid, real hand on my arm. For as many times as I had seen this man's face in the shadowy corners of my room, for all the echoes of his voice I heard, sometimes that cut-off scream and sometimes the words he spoke in home movies I watched later on, I had never touched the man. For some odd reason, that touch forced some part of my brain to accept the reality of what was going on. That this dead man had come to visit me like a bad Christmas Carol parody. Then, his pale blue eyes not leaving mine as the words passed through his lips, he spoke in a gentle tone that replaced the chill in my spine with an icicle in my gut. 



“Sit down, Riley. Let's talk.” Spoken like a father trying to convince his toddler that it was bedtime. I didn't move. I mean, how could I? He repeated himself, a little louder. But still, the voice was so soft. What is that feeling, where something FEELS dangerous without showing it? The feeling you get seeing a snake on its back and not knowing if it's actually safe to walk past it. The feeling of threat, I guess. Regardless, after a few moments, I felt my feet, nearly of their own volition, step back. I let him into my home. My sanctuary. 



I nearly fell back onto my sofa within the living room of the shack, my eyes refusing to leave his. So far as I recall, I don't think I once blinked while they were connected. He was so much taller than I first figured, now that I was sitting in this new position. Though, I never saw Cory standing up, so maybe that was just always how he would have been, if I knew him. I felt my voice, quaking, return to me, first silently mouthing and then finally recalling how to make sound. 



“Who... What-”, I started, but the words meant to come after kept fumbling after themselves. Eventually, one of the lines of thought came to the forefront and found its way between my lips. “How are you alive?” 



A dry chuckle. A smile, seemingly warm, before Cory took a small breath and, with a small air of drama, shrugged at me. “How are *you*? Ten years of shooting up, for little old me? I'm flattered, really.” The smile wasn't friendly after all. It was the smile you make when you have a joke you want to tell, but know that it'll get you in trouble. His hands, rough and wide, returned to his sides before continuing. “So, this is what you're doing these days, huh? One little car accident, and you go full on Ted K?” Another chuckle, decidedly with less mirth now. “You know how many people you left behind, Riley? You know how many people you hurt when you left? Hell, at least you were quick with me.” Something about how he said it made my skin crawl. 



I had regular communication with the people in my life that I cared about, even if I had left behind others; it wasn't as if my companionship was really worth much. This corpse rose up to tell me that? Some of that confused frustration was starting to creep into my voice, Cory putting those hands in his pockets and taking a slow, sweeping look around the room while I answered. 



“You... came back to life to guilt trip me? Is that a, a ghost thing? A God thing? Should I have gone to church, or tried to commune with you like that fortune teller told me to? What did-”.



He cut me off, eyes now narrow and sharp, to match the new tone of voice. “Shut up,” it was spoken a little indignantly, “No, that's not what I'm here for. I don't exactly have clearance to give you all of the details, but the guys that run the hereafter have a proposal for you. I'm here to offer it to you, since if they sent some random guy, you probably wouldn't believe it.”



As the man walked from one corner of the room to the other, my eyes flicked downward to his lower half. I'm not really sure what drew my attention to start, but I noticed two strange aspects to this person. First of all, his outfit was immaculate. He bore no dirt, no stains, no tears, no rips, no sign at all that he was even outside to knock on my door. Point of fact, his button-up shirt was seamlessly tucked under his dress pants, but there was something about it that threw me off. It never creased when he moved. It stayed smooth and fluid as he walked, which clothes just don't do. He interrupted my train of thought. 



“Look, Riley. I'm not upset about what happened. If you're thinking this is a forgiveness thing, or a vengeful spirit thing, put it out of your mind. It was an accident. You'd be surprised how much time you have in the afterlife to come to terms with that kind of thing.” “So you are dead. That's what you're saying.” It slipped out without me really thinking. My brain was mush, and had elected to confront the revenant before me. Some of my own bitterness had injected itself into my words. Maybe it had been pent up. “Yeah. No, I'm not going to tell you what it's like, much as I'd like to. And yes, I'll be gone and back to being dead once our business is done here.” His voice was dry, and he finally took a seat across from me, grunting a little as he settled against the cushions. 



“I... Okay. Fine. Cory. It *is* Cory, right? You said you had a proposal?” 



“Well, it's not exactly from me, more like it's from the people above my pay grade. The powers that be have determined that the act which killed me was a true accident. As in, it wasn't meant to happen. The crash was never meant to take place, both of us were supposed to go home that night, and your tire blowing on that curve? It has the people upstairs very, very confused.” 



I could feel the gooseflesh rolling up my arms and legs as the implications started to settle in. I had never been too religious of a person, but if there were greater powers, and something happened beyond their control, what exactly did that mean? Did something break the threads of fate? Surely nothing that dramatic. But there was a sinking feeling in my gut, which only grew as I let the words settle. 



Cory took my silence as a sign to continue. “They perceive time and space a little different than we do, so it's taken as long as it has on our end for them to really digest what happened and suggest a solution. A fix, I guess. For both of us. I was never meant to die, and you were never meant to kill me. So... they're offering to make it so it never happened.” 



What? I couldn't vocalize it, not at first, so the word just rang out hollow in my head. Then it ran through again. Then, I could finally verbalize the word. And what came out after. 



“What exactly does that MEAN? God snaps their fingers, and it just never happened? You come back and we forget it all? I don't understand.” 



His response was, for some reason, quieter than his previous ones. “No. It wouldn't be that clean of a job. That's not how he does things.” 



“That doesn't exactly clear it up, Cory. You walk in here, with the face of the man I've been seeing in nightmares for over a decade, you tell me that gods are real, you tell me heaven has, what, a returns center that wants to reimburse me for time spent traumatized? Maybe I hit my head this morning. Maybe I'm going goddamn stir crazy. Maybe I did a while ago.” 



He let me get it out. For that, I was thankful enough. Though, afterwards, his face tightened into that grim, stone smile. “I'm gonna be honest with you here, Riley. If you hadn't suffered like you did, if you carried on after I died like it never happened... I don't think we would have gotten this offer. Atonement and accountability are kind of a big deal to the higher-ups.” He placed one hand into the other on his lap, wringing it absentmindedly as he looked away from me. What was he so nervous about all of the sudden? 



He continued. “In that way, it's almost like a reward for gritting your teeth and bearing the universe's mistake. They realized what happened, and they saw how you made the effort to improve yourself, and now they want to offer you the opportunity to be healed, I guess. To take the weight off your shoulders.” I was still so hung up on all these revelations coming at me, but there was a single errant thought nagging at my mind. 



“What about you, Cory? Will they bring you back? Let you carry on, like you would have? See your parents again? Your sisters? Will all of them just... forget everything that happened?” His expression grew more and more stern with each question. 



After a pause, he answered, seemingly exasperated. “I don't know, okay? Not a lot of people have come back, and events like this are so rare that there's nothing to really compare it to. I think...”, he trailed off. I could see the gears slowly turning in his head. It wasn't that he didn't know what the conclusion of the line of thinking was. Instead, it was the struggle to try and word it in a way that lessened the blow. 



Eventually, he came out with it. “It'll be another me. A me, plucked from a time and place where the wreck didn't happen, and put here to continue the life I started. Everyone will forget the crash happened, my truck will just have been scrapped for one reason or another, and that'll be that. The path souls take after death is one-way: Mine can't be brought back, so they'll bring in another me to live that life.” He sighed after getting it out in the open. I could tell that this 'solution' was what was bothering him so deeply. 



Of course, my mind was having trouble even keeping up with the mechanics of the whole thing. A good chunk of it flew over my head, and the room had begun to spin as I tried putting the pieces together in a way that was coherent to me. “So, you'll still be dead. There will be another you, living the life you should have had. How is that anything but cruel? And, and what about me? Would I be replaced, or something?” 



“From what they told me, they'll find another you, but you'll merge. You'll keep your identity, your overall memories, but your lived experience will be one where I never died. Even I have trouble wrapping my head around it. As for me, I'll get my own memories altered as the new me lives on. It's the best consolation they could offer.” He then, maybe to try and lighten the mood, ended with: “I guess actual resurrection is a 'VIP' only perk.” 



I needed to take it in for a good while. He was saying that this was an 'offer', which implied that I had a choice in the matter. But, at the same time, it appeared as though my decision would be the one that determined Cory's fate as well. I guess it made sense, it was both of us that was wrapped up in the entire affair. Odds were high that the rescue workers that came to us that night hardly even remembered us beyond his gruesome injuries. According to the specter of the man, a specter that my own hands had created, the one opportunity to alleviate his suffering and my own would be to agree to this deal. Otherwise, what would happen? Would both of us continue on, me with my aversions and him in whatever afterlife he existed in? Was it worth it? 



In the end, I simply said, “Okay. I accept.” 



His body immediately seemed to shimmer, as if the waveform of my voice rippled through his being, and Cory smiled. It was genuine, like a weight had already been lifted from his shoulders. The man breathed a deep, relieved sigh, and stood up, his clothes still immaculate, despite the lazy position he was in. 



“Riley, thank you for this. I mean it. For me, it's a consolation, maybe, but you... You deserve to have the life of someone without this burden. In the place I've been for so long, I've been able to see you, see you struggle, see you try your best to be there for my own folks after it all happened. Sure, I was mad at first, but being a spirit lets you see everything that goes on, if you wish. Trust me, you're gonna get what you deserve.” 



And, before I had time to even process it, before those final words could register to me in a way that would have allowed me to ask their meaning, he was gone. There wasn't a fade, not a noise, not any indication of motion. In a nanosecond, he went from standing, smiling at me in a way that showed contentment, to gone. All that remained was his footprints, which, after a few moments, faded away as well. Despite the positive response he gave me, despite how earnest he had been, I couldn't help but feel more alone than I ever had, out in my shack in the mountains. Even when the wind kicked back in, and the chimes hanging on my front porch announced their return to me, I felt as though I had made a mistake. Like I made a deal without reading the fine print. 



For the first few days after Cory's visit, nothing much happened. It was difficult to return to my routine after the event, and my mind was occupied with a constant rush of questions to myself that I had no way of answering. Didn't he say that my memories of what happened would fade? That another me, that another life I could have led, would become my own, where that night never happened? Did I mishear, or misunderstand? It wasn't as though I could ask him, and the gnawing sensation in my intestines only grew as I realized how little I actually knew. 



Maybe that's why I decided to hike up the mountain. During my time in rehab, I had developed a great fondness for hiking, nature trails, and so on. My psychiatrist, who first recommended nature trails to me back when I lived with my family, had said that for many people, physical activity was a good way for the mind to flush itself of junk information that it holds onto. In other words, it clears your head and allows you to reflect more easily on the issues that you're facing. Which, for someone who was constantly being reminded of what happened, could have been useful for me. In that regard, it would make sense to resort to the hobby again in this new stressful situation. I still wasn't feeling any different since Cory arrived and vanished, and so the chaos in my mind compelled me to look up towards the mountain at which my home claimed the base of. Where I'm situated, the mountain range that runs across for several miles from north to south experiences wet, humid summers and mild autumns. 



The forest surrounding and covering the range is primarily made up of conifers, sagebrush, and a variety of plains roaming animals that will occasionally use the mountains as a shelter during thunderstorms due to the number of grottoes, inlets, outcroppings, and dense tree cover they provide. They're a challenge to scale at any angle, but this was the best time of the year to do it, and I felt in my heart that this would be the only way for me to get the peace of mind necessary to really think over my situation. Knowing that the worst could still manifest itself even during a time such as this, I left a letter at my front door explaining what I was doing. As I recall, it went as such: 



"Hello there! If you've come to visit me, I'm currently climbing the mountain to the direct northwest of this house. Please return tomorrow. If I am not back by Sunday (three days time), please alert the local forest rescue office, and direct them to the mountain." 



Short, simple, to the point. Although Cory had been the only visitor I'd had in months, it was never beyond the realm of possibility that someone else could come by. Thus, on the fifth morning after his visit, I started my trek. The lack of rainfall had been a boon for me as I scaled the somewhat familiar hills, the natural paths created by the local wildlife being enough to keep me steady. After the passing of a few hours, I had reached the summit without any real trouble. At the point I had stopped, I was able to overlook the horizon, and by extension the plot of land I owned. I could even make out the outline of my home from my position, since there weren't any trees tall enough in the sight line to mask the structure. As nightfall began to set, and my tent was built up and fortified against a sturdy juniper, I built myself a small fire within the open area of the summit, using surrounding stones and some old bird nests. 



As I reached into my pack, though, it finally hit me. The thing that had troubled me about the fire: the noise. When I lit that fire, it had been the first distinct noise I had heard the entire trip up the mountain. In my recollection, there hadn't been a single moment of an animal's call, of a distant plane, nor of any vehicles or even the rustling of leaves as I ascended. This fire had been, for the past several hours, the first sound I'd noticed, and it threw me off. Of course, it hadn't thrown me off enough to tear away my hunger, and a flat pan I kept strapped to the back of my pack went over the fire, followed by my desiccated, and soon to be hydrated, meal. The night was clear, and the stars vibrant. Watching them as I ate, as I laid back after putting out my flame, I was prompted to think about Cory. Was he up there? Did the afterlife have a sense of direction in relation to Earth? Was I just insane? There was always that possibility. 



My drowsy, exhausted mental wandering was interrupted by a crackle. I sat up, annoyed, and then stood to walk over to the small fire pit I had made, seeing where I had failed to put out an errant ember. It wasn't uncommon, I had only needed to build a fire a few times in my life, so I usually ended up needing to double-tap the ashes. But the dirt and wood remains beneath my feet were cold, and I could still hear that crackling noise. I scrambled, tearing my eyes to scout the woods surrounding me. Had an ember floated out? Had I started a damn forest fire? I wasn't prepared for that. But no, I didn't see anything between the trees. And, in that moment, I realized how strange that was. It was almost ten at night, under a bright moon. In my past experiences on this mountain, the underbrush should have been abound with noises, deer, rabbits, and any number of other wildlife. But, there was nothing around my camp, even when I started intentionally seeking those familiar shapes and sounds. All there was, was that strange crackling noise. The realization hit me like a brick. Audibly gasping, I tore myself to the edge of the summit, my stomach sinking as a distinct, orange glow came into direct view across the mountain. A glow slowly growing in intensity, focused on what would have been the most desirable target for a fire to grow. I witnessed, my mouth opening into a panicked yell, as my house was being engulfed by an inferno. And, standing at the foot of it, a silhouette that was familiar. 



It was Cory, standing still in front of it all. His face turned. I knew he was looking at me. 



I woke up a little bit later, my face sore and my nose pressed against the cold dirt. At first, I was confused, straining and pushing myself up, trying to get my bearings. Looking up only revealed the ledge I was standing on, and the moon shining above it. After a moment, it clicked, and I realized that I likely fainted from what I saw. Speaking of, I tried to catch sight of my house again, but my lower elevation pushed the trees up too high to get a clear view. All I could see was the rising smoke and embers above the treetops, dancing along the chilly winds gushing from the mountaintop. It was only when my situation fully sank in, that I had no way back up to my supplies, the steepness of the ground I was on prevented me from climbing with my bare hands, that I realized exactly how much danger I was in. 



It was night, perhaps eleven PM, and I was surrounded by motionless, almost freakishly-still spruces and junipers, my head pounding from my fall, a sharp pain in my side indicative of a bruised rib or two. I started to breathe in short, shallow huffs. Infinite directions, but nowhere to run. In a haze, I darted towards the smoke rising along the horizon. If nothing else, it would act as a beacon of sorts for me, though any hope I had of salvaging my home was dwindling with each painful step. I had lost one of my boots in the fall, likely torn off by some rock or branches. Every other step as I dashed through the nearly pitch blackness of the woods brought searing agony to my sole, between stones, brambles, and who knows what else. 



My heart was in my throat, it wasn't long before I started to limp, and after a few minutes, or maybe only seconds, I was out of breath. I slumped to a tree, sliding down to catch myself. I was stuck like that for a while. Short bouts of tears would be cut off by me burying my mouth into my sleeve to try and maintain some sort of silence, although I wasn't exactly sure what it was I was keeping quiet from. The woods were still vacant, still quiet, but now where it was once an oddity, a malevolent air had taken root within the branches and grass. In all my time hiking, climbing, even in the most remote places in America, never, once, had the wilderness been totally silent. The longer I sat there, the heavier it all felt. Every direction was a blanket of night threatening to smother me the moment I turned my attention away. 



That's the moment I heard the distinct, though distant, sound of a twig snapping underfoot. Then another. And another. I couldn't scramble to my feet fast enough, every moment was like an eternity as a singular point of motion approached me at an increasing speed I could only describe as “locked on”. I chose a direction, away from the sound, and bolted as fast as possible, which was admittedly not very fast at all. I had sat too long, allowing the pain in all my extremities to compound, the adrenaline to fade. 



It was no surprise, then, as something heavy crashed into my side, flinging me against the ground with enough force to bounce my head off of it. Immediately, I saw stars, my arms failing to move at my commands, instead lying limp against the lichens and blades of grass. I could barely even turn my head to look at my assailant before a heavy blow struck against my cheek, followed by another, each accompanied by a hoarse, broken laugh. They were on my chest, flinging their fists into my face wildly, squealing in a delight I had only ever heard when a sty of pigs was given a full trough of slop. It was only after several strikes that my arms finally fell back under my control, rising up and shoving whatever it was off of me. 



Coughing up blood and tooth fragments, I pushed myself back and tried to stagger back to my feet. My eyes weren't focusing anymore, one of my orbitals was likely fractured, but I could make out the shape of my assailant in the dark. They were a person, of average build, longish hair, and they were taking their own time to get onto their feet. It was almost as though they were letting me up, though I couldn't fathom a reason why. Only once I was braced against a tree, did my good eye finally manage to make out details of my attacker. I stopped breathing. What I saw in front of me, smiling warmly like this was a warm summer morning and we were passing one another in a store, was nearly incomprehensible. 



At the worst of my addiction, slumming around the destitute, seeking a new fix to ease my mind, I saw the worst physical effects that drugs could have on a person. Patchy skin, ribs pressing into the chest like trapped caterpillars attempting to burst through a cocoon. The telltale signs of degradation that revoked the humanity from the appearance of the one cursed to bear the addiction. I nearly ended up there myself, only torn away from the needle by a timely intervention through my parents. I had believed that those people, despite the goodness that remained in their heart, had had their visage stolen as much as possible away from them. This was wholly different. The creature in front of me, standing eye level with an unblinking blue gaze, was as antithetical to that description as could be possible. 



They were lean, wearing nothing aside from small smudges of mud and dirt, their hair a matted tangle of brunette that frayed limp below their shoulders. Their muscles, visible through outlines and twitching, quivering veins, slid mechanically as they stepped forward, with an impact that warranted a noise but rendered none against the placid ground beneath them. Their chest did not heave, did not sink or rise any more than was necessary to continue their movement, despite the effort they must have expended in our clash. There was no sway in their gait, no sign of personality behind those pleasant, predator's eyes. Eyes that I had seen before, every morning when I got out of bed, half lidded as I made sure my hair was brushed through and my stubble was shaved. It bore my face. And it smiled ever wider as it noticed my realization. 



Finally, it stopped it's pace, perhaps a dozen feet from where I leaned, shivering and unable to tear my eyes from their own. When it spoke, it was quiet, not quite a whisper, but clear over the deafening silence of the woods around us. 



“Disgusting.” The voice was almost bemused. “So this is what became of you.” A small shake of their head followed, followed by a small, barely noticeable sigh. “Our life. Wasted. All because of your weakness. Disgusting.” 



Some part of me tried to form a response. It failed. Even now, I'm not sure if it was due to the sheer frozen fear instilled inside of me, or the physical barrier of my jaw swelling. Likely both, likely more. I lost control of my knees and slipped down to sit facing out against the tree. I wasn't stupid, I knew what this was. Despite the fear, despite how otherworldly all of it was, I understood, and that understanding lifted from me any sense of fight that remained in me. It clicked, the moment I recognized their voice. This was the 'me' that I had been promised. The me that never suffered the events of that night years ago, the me that never needed to undergo the journey I had. The me that I would have been. Whatever divine providence in charge of the agreement that I made, plucked this version of me out of that world and put it here. This was God's way of correcting the mistake that was me.



 Spitting out a glob of congealing blood, I could finally manage words with some difficulty. With everything going through my mind, some part of me held firm to the notion that I could at least talk to it. So I just let whatever that part of me could come up with to fall from my cracked lips. 



“The fire...?”, was what came out ahead of everything else. 



Slight confusion, then the scant shift to annoyance lighted their face. “Everything about that night needs to be erased. Including the results. You escaped here after it all happened, which means it needs to be removed.” 



The smile never left their face, even if everything else shifted. I waited for more, but more words did not come. Instead, more slow footfalls as they continued their approach. Perhaps it was fight or flight, perhaps it was some other quirk in my mind, but I pushed my hands against the ground, gaining enough of a foothold to rise. As I stood, still slightly leaning against the trunk of that solid juniper beneath the observant stars above, anger to bleed in thin streams into me. My heart quickened. I was no fighter, but I wasn't going to accept being butchered without some sort of struggle, not after everything I had been through. Their smile seemed to widen ever so slightly as they lunged. I was barely able to begin turning as the fist smashed into my cheek, sending another deep electric shock of blunt agony through me. But I gripped at the bark of the tree, giving me enough leverage to stay standing, and I swung my own arm as a guttural, crying wail shot out from my lips. 



My strike landed on their upper chest, and they staggered ever so slightly. Needing distance, I tore away, forcing my feet to land true on the ground despite the searing pain of my calves. I knew they were behind me, their silence now broken by angered stomps, but I had the advantage in terms of a head-start, and a thought rattled through my mind: They had to be able to come up from my home. From ground level. I didn't know if they were just plopped down in a random place, but they came at me from the direction of my house. That was enough to go on. 



Excruciating pain and the sensation of blood spilling raked along my back as I approached a downhill slope near the edge of the treeline in front of me. They laughed, pulling their arm back for another swipe. I staggered forward, but threw myself down, deciding in a split moment that a death by impalement via tree was better than whatever this thing intended. Spotting the rising plume of smoke as the slope overcame me, I flung myself down the hill, trying my best to curl myself into a fetal position as my body struck the ground and began to clumsily roll, picking up as the descent became more and more steep. It was almost all brush, a small mercy, but I still recall sharp stones and thorns embedding themselves into me as I descended, my curled position breaking after a few moments and forcing me to take the brunt of what the mountain had to offer. By the time I came to a rolling stop, I was shaking, both from the hundreds of cuts and the sheer shock rattling through my body. 



For almost a full minute, I couldn't move. The connections between the mind and the neurons dictating the body simply failed to spark. Instead, I lay there, the smell of smoke and sound of crackling fire the only accompaniment I had. At that moment, was it fear that ran through me? I remember a strange numbness as the weight of everything was given the time to be digested. This is who I was meant to be? That thing, feral and so gleeful in violence? Why? Why would whatever heavenly host above consider this as a way to make up for their mistakes? Or were they so above human emotion, so above the insignificant span of time of a human life, that they just have no care for this part of the bargain? I threw up, managing to roll my head over just in time to stop myself from choking on it.



In all of my life, even as a non-believer, even in my lowest moments, I had taken a small comfort in the knowledge that my life was my own. That, despite my mistakes, and despite my misfortune, an uncaring universe meant opportunities to take for myself, to improve. The idea that the world had no oversight was scary, but there were silver linings. There, on the ground, in blood, vomit, and a gradually growing amount of burning embers, it finally hit me that an uncaring creator is far, far less terrifying than one that selected you and you alone to be in their sight. 



As my motion returned, I slowly forced myself up against the stump I had rolled against and sobbed. The adrenaline was gone. All that remained the burning woods encroaching ever close. The noise of grass rustling from the hill I rolled down. The wreckage of the culmination of all my years of trying to atone and get better. All that was left was the consequences. Part of me broke, then. My legs weren't working, my whole body was shaking, and fear like that I never known gripped me like ice, my only relief as the heat grew and the trees behind me caught fire. During it all, a thought kept replaying in my mind, over and over again, as I sat atop the stump, heaving. He lied. He knew exactly what this would be. Angels wouldn't make bargains. And Cory was no angel. He got his new life, at the cost of mine. 



The creature came into view, having descended the hill on all fours, their back end hiked as their muscular limbs came forward in mechanical, plodding motions. Their eyes bulged in an otherworldly glee as they spotted their prey, alive, sharp teeth biting down on a hungry pair of bleeding lips. As they barreled down the last dozen yards, a new sensation began to overtake me, not replacing the fear, but joining it; anger. Anger at the thing racing towards me. Anger towards Cory for taking revenge on me, regardless of how unfair his death was. And, most of all, anger at myself for choosing in the first place to throw away everything I had done, every step towards betterment, out of misplaced guilt. I was defiant. 



The decision was made in the briefest of moments. If it didn't work, I would die, or be subsumed by that thing, or whatever else happened when a demon has your soul. My eyes flicked down, and in the brush and grass, illuminated by the fire, I saw my opportunity. There was no time. I had to allow myself to become the animal that the other me embraced long ago. 



As the creature hit the bottom of the hill, I kicked forward with all of the energy left in my legs that I could muster. While I shot out from my position, my hand swung low, finding and scooping up the sharp, palm sized stone I had locked eyes with. The other Riley couldn't stop their momentum, even as they tried to use their arms as brakes. It only put them off balance. As they crested the bottom of the slope, I clutched the stone, and swung my arm to catch the side of their head. A sickening, wet snapping noise joined the cracking woods around us, and I pulled myself over their waist to straddle them. 



I didn't shut my eyes. I couldn't afford to. Squeezing the rock hard enough that bloody cuts were dug into my hand, streaming red down my forearm, I brought it down on their face. Looking back, I think they had started to say something before the chunk of granite smashed into their nose. I raised the stone once more, and kept bringing it down on their face, screaming and heaving, until I could no longer recognize that face as my own. Even at the end, they never stopped smiling, even as that stone broke through their skull and scrambled whatever could be considered the mind of this animal. When it was done, I threw the rock aside, dry heaving, pounding my fists to their chest, cursing it for bringing me to this point. It was then, as I let out one final wail, that the world turned to black. 



I don't claim to understand everything about what happened to me.I don't claim to understand everything about what happened to me. I don't know if what I did was murder, and I don't know if that really was another me, or just something wearing my skin. I don't know why, when I awoke, I was laying against cool, bare earth, surrounded by burnt trees that had seemingly long been extinguished, nor why the body I had collapsed upon was gone. In the end, after I walked back through the silent woods, after seeing the destroyed foundation of my home and the slowly widening eyes of the reborn man standing in the rubble, I knew only one thing.

 

Cory Dittmer had to die.
