About a decade back i used to work at a brewery/pub. It was set in a pretty big and old building, from the early 1900’s. 

I worked there for a couple of years, and most of the time the it was pretty chill, but backbreaking at times. On my time working there i had two experiences that i can only describe as supernatural.

The first one, it was a particular late night and i was task with closing up the hangar/loading docks. Closing it up was making sure there wasn’t anything obstructing where the trucks would park, stacking up any loose crates, turning the lights off and locking it all up. 

I was about done, so i turn of the lights and as i’m making my way to the door a beer bottle comes rolling towards me from the dark between the tall stacks of crates. It wasn’t forceful or anything, it looked like someone gently placed it on the floor and rolled it towards me. 

I didn’t thought too much of it, so i picked up the bottle and placed it inside a half empty crate. I turned around and as i started walking another bottle comes rolling from the same place, than another one. Tired and thinking it was a coworker trying to fuck with me i shout “Hey, alright, you got me. Come on i gotta close it up” I expected to hear laughter or something, but instead i was dead silent. 

I waited for a couple minutes, turned on my flashlight and started looking around the stacks of crates for what I thought it would be a giggling coworker. After searching each corner and turn i gave up. I was a little weirded out at this point, but i just picked up the two bottles from the ground and placed in the same crate as the first one.

I turned off my flashlight and shouted at the darkness “Alright, I’m locking up. See you tomorrow” just as a finished saying that a crate full of bottles fell from one on the stacks and landed two feet from me, glass shards and beer exploding everywhere.

The next day i told my boss about it and he said it was probably a rat. The thing is, those crates when full probably weights 20 pounds, how could a rat push it? 
Talking to my coworkers they told me that they’ve also experienced weird stuff during closing hours.

My second experience happened again when i was closing the place. This time i was closing the pub.

When closing the pub the last thing you usually do is restock the walk-in freezer. The freezer is probably just as old as the building itself and it sits underground, right beneath the bar. 

I was down there filling that enormous thing with kegs and crates. Being a very old freezer from a time when safety wasn’t a big concern the thing doesn’t open from the inside, no handle, nothing. Just a flat, plain steel door.

So i did what I always did when i had to go inside that thing, i put a keg securing the door open. I was halfway through the task when i hear the door slamming shut, i rush towards the door but it’s locked shut. I started pounding on it, but the only other person there was my boss in the office, two floors above me, probably with his door closed. I tried my phone, but since I’m locked underground inside a steel and led box i had no service.

I was wearing only jeans ans a T-shirt so things were getting chilly pretty quickly, my face was going numb and my hands were getting stiff, i made a blanket out of cardboard but it was doing very little keeping the cold at bay. 

The only reason I didn’t freeze to death was because i had a date with a regular and she went there looking for me. She asked my boss where i was and when he couldn’t find me he went to the basement and found me inside the freezer. I was there for about 45 minuted when he found me and i was starting to consider writing a letter to my parents and drinking myself to sleep.

My boss installed a chain to keep the door open after that, but i refused to ever walk in to that death trap again. Weirdest part, the keg i had holding the door open was at the other side of the room when i got out. It was a full steel keg, not something that just slides away, let alone quietly.

I stop workin there shortly after for unrelated reason.

Thoughts?
