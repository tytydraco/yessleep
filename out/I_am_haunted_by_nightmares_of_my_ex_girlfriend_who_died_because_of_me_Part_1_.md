"I love you so much, Niel. Please don't leave me." 

I woke up with a start, drenched in sweat. I saw her again. Christ, I can't catch a break. I glanced at the clock on my nightstand as I reached over for my sleeping medication. 3AM it read. It was an ungodly hour, but I couldn't go back to sleep. Hell, I can't sleep at all. All I see is Elizabeth, my ex girlfriend, who took her life 2 weeks ago after our breakup. And I've felt like shit ever since then.

Our love had started off so innocently and sweetly, like any adolescent romance. We met at a dog park as Elizabeth was walking her golden retriever. I was awestruck by her beauty; auburn hair framed her heart shaped face. Freckles dotted her porcelain white skin, and she had a smile that made me weak at the knees. We hit it off in an instant, and our relationship was just perfect. Until it wasn't. We had been together for 2 years when she began acting strangely. With every passing day she grew more jealous, more selfish and possessive of me. Random accusations of infidelity were thrown my way. I let this drag on for months, until I reached my breaking point and decided I had enough. Even though I loved her, I had to leave the relationship to regain my sanity. A week after we broke up, she showed up at my doorstep every single day, begging me to take her back. I wouldn't back down, and neither would she. The last day I saw her, she approached me on campus at my university, carrying a bouquet of pink roses in her hands. I lost my temper and yelled at her to leave me alone. She ran off in tears, and I thought surely that had to be it. Little did I know my wish would come true in the worst way possible. She was found dead in her father's basement later that day, with a noose round her neck, and a note declaring her undying love for me. 

My vision blurred as my eyes welled with tears. Fuck! Why the fuck did she do this to herself?? To ME?! Why didn't she talk to someone..why didn't she seek help? No. I can't blame her. Why didn't I stay with her? I should have been stronger, I should have been a better boyfriend. Even if I wasn't happy, at least she'd still be here. 

I snapped my mind back to the present. Maybe Dad was right that I needed to see a shrink, I thought to myself. Maybe I am going insane. 

No. I furiously shook my head and dabbed at the corners of my eyes. I am NOT going crazy. I couldn't afford to. Not with final exams coming up in 2 weeks. Exams that I just HAD to pass, no matter the bullshit in my personal life. Getting admitted to a psych ward was the last thing I needed. 

I flicked the light switches on as I went to wash my face in the bathroom before making my way to the study. Maybe studying is the perfect distraction from my inner struggles. I would study until my eyes fall from their sockets. It's hardly an effective learning technique, but at least it would keep my mind off of...her. 

After 3 hours of studying, I found myself slowly losing the battle to stay awake. Eventually I relented, and closed my eyes. 

I found myself at a park I loved playing in with my friends when I was a child. It looked more vivid than before. The grass and bushes were a luxuriant green, the flower bed appeared as if it was glowing, and the pond shimmered brilliantly in the afternoon sun. The scene looked wonderful, ethereal even. I walked around, taking in the sight and mesmerized by every bit of it. I rounded a bush, and...the scene changed. It appeared I had stumbled into a wedding ceremony. I gazed at the guests. Everyone wore black. Must be a goth themed wedding by the looks of it. I stepped closer to take a look. I could hear music from an organ. It sounded...eerie. Something was off. I turned round to look at the guests again. Everyone's eyes were trained on me. Their faces were expressionless, some even saddened. Why would people look sad at such a joyous occasion? I turned back around and froze in place. There she was. Elizabeth. Walking towards me in a flowing black gown that hugged her figure. She carried a familiar looking bouquet of pink roses, with a wide grin on her face. Was I dreaming? Was any of this real? She uttered words which made my blood run cold: "There you are, Niel. I will always be by your side. I love you so much."
