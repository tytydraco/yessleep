The year is 2024, I still live with the regret and trauma of the events that happened to me in 1997. No one believed me, the police force, my family, my community. The only person that believed me is the woman I married, so thank you Clara, you're the reason I'm writing this book now, maybe other people will see the truth in my story that you've always been able to see.

# 1. The Things with the Glowing Heads

Time is an interesting thing. The length of every minute, every hour, every day and even every year does not change yet as many people grow older time seems to move faster. People lose the time to appreciate life sometimes. The beauty of life. The beauty of nature. The beauty of the world around us. It is the most gorgeous thing that i’ve ever experience—don’t tell my wife I said that—but with all the beauty the world can bring it can often be quite eerie. Sights that instill fear into your heart though there may be no reason to be on edge. As night comes these feelings can come easier, but certain areas—night or day—never fail to put a shiver down my spine.   
The Louisiana Bayou was one of these places that i’d keep far away from me if I had a choice, yet in July of 1997 I did not have a choice. My parents lived down in Houma, a choice made after I had left for college—I would’ve never supported such a decision. We had previously lived in Kansas but after the house fire and grandpas death my mom couldn’t stand to go near the place so they decided to move here.   
My dad had grown up in the town, a low income family eating broken meals out of a house at the very back of the trailer park. He only had his mom, his dad died in a fishing accident when he was two, the trailer was the only thing she could afford. No siblings, no pets, nothing but his mom—and for his mom it was nothing but him but work always came first, if you think about it, work coming first may as well be putting him first too, that job fed him but she was always gone and he started getting into trouble. She died not long after his 18th birthday, an overdose—that really got him off of the drugs, he didn’t want to die, not yet. I guess coming back home made him feel closer to her.  
I was driving along Route 90 that night closing in on Morgan City. It was getting late and decided to head off an exit to find somewhere to stay. Probably a moldy old motel built in the 30s, good enough for a night. As I pulled off the exit the roads narrowed and the lighting went away, only my dim headlights lit up the world. The roads curved, left, right, left, right, and left again. I was surrounded by dry trees with their branches arching over the path and overgrown vines strangling them.   
The hum of my pickup truck soothed me halfway to sleep, the swamp was warm. My eyes began to shut, eyesight blurry, foot pressing heavier on the pedal I tried to keep myself on the road. I tried. I felt myself sinking away, sinking into the seat, into my dreams.   
Next thing I knew I woke up with glass all around, my head hurt and I had a gash on my arm. The front end of my Ford Ranchero was crinkled like damn parchment paper—this angered me most about my situation, that car was everything to me—and was half submerged in water. A puddle had formed at my feet, it was like I was sitting on the edge of a pool, my feet dangling into the water. Relaxed. Calm. This was nowhere close to any of those. My ears rang, my old straw hat my mom had bought me when we first got Kansas in 1979 ended up on the hood. Most concerning of all the symptoms of the crash was footsteps. I could hear footsteps. Splashes of water in front of me, for half a second I thought it might be my own feet but the stationary state I was in proved that wrong.   
I looked up slowly and saw the silhouette of 3 men standing side by side in the swamp. Believe me I was as scared as hell, but my body couldn’t bring me to even react to what was in front of me  I couldn’t see any features but the one in the middle was extraordinarily tall—7 or 8 feet maybe.  The two on the outside were up to their waste in the water while the middle being had water rising to only his mid thigh. Bright lights beamed from where there heads would be, if they had heads that is. Hell for all I know they might not even be human beings, they could be something more. Aliens? Demons? Ghosts? I looked to my passenger seat, almost as if I was hoping someone was there, hoping someone else was seeing what i’m seeing. There was no one, I was alone and I knew this. By the time I brought my eyes back forward the things were gone, this time without a noise. Silent. I stayed silent. The world was silent. Thwack. Out like a light.

# 2. Welcome to the Community

Riverine (PBR) boats were small hull boats made of fiberglass utilized in the Vietnam War. They roamed along the Mekong Delta and in the Saigon River disrupting the communication and supply lines of the Vietcong. The boats housed a crew of four men led by a captain, the other three consisted of an engine man, a seaman, and a gunner—armed with a .50 caliber machine-gun, the warden of death for his team—though they may be accompanied by a South Vietnamese police officer. Conflict came quick and fast for the men in the shallows. It might have been one of the most terrifying roles you could play in the Vietnam War.  
My dad never talked about his time over there much. I had no doubt he remembered what had happened, hell half of what he saw will at least be in the back of his mind forever. He got drafted in 67’ and was off to war by the end of that year, came back in the fall of ‘69 and got out. My mom helped him, she was a therapist at the time. She was the only one he trusted with the thoughts that swallowed his mind. Mom never told anyone else what he told her except one thing she told me when I was nine or 10. She told me that for dad certain things never disappeared, still his ears ring out in the cadence of the .50 caliber, still he feel the vibrations of the gun in his hand, and yet still his mind can’t forget everything he saw. I never fully grasped how much it affected him and when I did I was too young to understand.  
Me and him used to go fishing, we would stay out on the lakes and rivers all day. This story happened around the time I was about 6 or so I can’t quite remember but we were on the little river that led out of the creek behind our house. I liked that house. He always brought his M1 with him on our fishing trips in case we needed it, you know, life or death situations, I mean I guess. We lived in a quiet country town in Indiana, doubt any commies or bad guys would end up there but who knows, lots of good people can do evil things. The reason we were on the river is because dad had heard about a lake not far down the stream from his co-worker, I guess in his eyes he thought it might be a good change of scenery.   
The little river had murky, brown water and was surrounded on both sides by a small sandy shore that transformed into tall grass the further away from the water you got. That day we were listening to the radio, some Bruce Springsteen I believe, I sat behind him as he rowed our way down the river. I played with the worms, squeezing the life out of one, getting bored, and moving to the next. Life can be taken for granted, if we don’t take the time to live it we may go into the afterlife regretting all we didn’t do. My dad reached behind him and turned down the radio.  
“So buddy, how’s school been going?” He asked with an uninterested tone. I think he just wanted to talk to talk.   


“Fine.” I respond, my dirty blonde hair waving over my eyes in the wind. Little did I know in five years time it wouldn’t have a lick of blonde left in it. Funny how hair does that.

  
“Well, as long as you’re doing better than I ever did then...” He went silent. He looked to his left and scrambled his hands around for the rifle.   
The grass rustled, I could hear it but it was quiet. It sounded like nothing to me, a white noise, a soothing noise. The noise got louder, and louder, and louder even more till it sounded like it was surrounding us. My father still kept his aim, his eyes looked dead. I started to see the sway of the grass go back and forth. Something was coming towards us. It let out a noise, a yell? A grunt? What was it? Well soon my answer would come, the thing came bursting out of the brush and my dad fired. It collapsed, he re-racked the rifle and fired again. Double Tap. It was a boy, maybe the same age as me, he had a toy plane in his hand. My dad kept his gun pointed at him, the first shot hit him in the leg the second one... a headshot.  
“Da-... Daddy...” I said quietly. cautiously. fearfully.  
He snapped his head in my direction and quickly back to the body. He threw his gun to the side.  
“Oh my... God-... Shit.” He said slamming his fist down against the boat before sinking his face into his hands. He started sobbing, rocking himself and the boat back and forth as he did.   
He couldn’t bring himself to say a word till later that night, he told me that this was a special secret between me and him, and to never tell anyone about it or a big monster is gonna take daddy away for a very long time, he called it the cover n’ mint—man was I dumb to not see that one. I was young, I was stupid, and he, he was my father.   
The sky was blue that day, as my father, my killer of a father—though I can’t blame him for that—rowed us back home I curled into a ball and cried, cried as far away from him as I could looking up through blurry tears at the bright blue and cloudless Indiana sky. I was scared of him for a while, probably up into my teenage years until I understood it more, yet like his memories that bloody child and the blue sky stay in my mind like a photograph that cannot be deleted.  
That day in 1976 came back to me when I awoke again. I wasn’t in my car anymore, I could hear the roar of a motor and the bouncing and rocking of the water. It was silent except for the constant—maybe even annoying—buzz of the engine like a fly zooming around the shallows of the Bayou.  
I was alive. I was awake, but I was most definitely not alone, the fact that I was on this boat and this boat was moving told me that. I was frozen by fear to even look around, what would happen if I did, maybe even a naeve thought came across my mind that if I didn’t move this trip would never end but at the same time I didn’t even know what awaited me off of this boat. I couldn’t help but think who was driving this thing, or should I say what was driving this thing. It was utterly silent—at least if we’re talking voice-wise—except for the sounds of the boat being propelled through the water filled my mind.   
I could smell smoke, cigarette smoke I assumed—it seemed the most probable in my opinion. I had never been much of a smoker, I mean yeah I smoked pot a few times with my friends but nothing crazy, addiction never overtook me. The smell of the swamp made me want to throw up, it smelt like death, decomposed and rotting death. I wanted to plug my nose, I couldn’t move, I felt like I couldn’t move. I didn’t really know what would happen if I did but that fear of the unknown is not uncommon and not weak enough to empower me to move.  
Eventually the boat started to slow down, I could feel it shift as it maneuvered into dock—quite recklessly I must add, I got thrown into the interior wall of the vessel as a result. This only fed my fear about the things around me more. Maybe they were reckless and dangerous things that could tear my guts apart with one foul swipe of its claws or it was some cannibalistic group that is gonna use me for food and pleasure among other things.  
As the boat came to a standstill I could hear the shuffling of footsteps around me, maybe 2 or 3 people, or things, I didn’t know yet, of course I know now, I wouldn’t be writing this for you to read if I wasn’t. I have to keep it from you on the basis of suspense and the way I recount this story can change the way you digest the information.  
Words are important, and often what people say in important moments sticks with people for longer. The first and last words may have a bigger impact than any other said across a whole story. Writing this book I struggled most with how to start it because simply a bad first sentence can lose you just as easily as it can draw you in. I’ll never forget any of the words that were said in the summer 1997, but the first words said were during the shuffle and scuffle of feet while the things got off the boat. One man barks orders:  
“You two pick him up and put him up on the Cross of Initiation while I go get the Warden.”   
The Warden? The Cross of Initiation? What was all this? It terrified me. I closed my eyes, tried to pretend I was asleep. I could feel the presence of the men leaning over me, a light shined over the lids of my eyes. My eyes squinted in response, that's what gave me away.   
“I know you're awake boy” he says, I could feel the particles of saliva on my face as he talks. The two men laughed the most disgusting and strange laughs i’ve ever heard, it was a cacophony of- I don’t even know, i'm rambling.   
I felt their arms entangle under my armpits and drag me a few feet before throwing me off the boat onto the dock, the splintering wood pierced through my shirt as I rolled to a stop. I just laid there, I didn’t know what to do. What should I have done? Well if I could tell you what I would do now all I would say is one word. Run.  
“Well c’mon now get up.” The other man said, it had to be the other man the voice wasn’t the same. The first had a deep and raspy voice, basically he sounded like a vocalist in a metal band, while this guy had a deep southern drawl, he sounded like he was from Texas I don’t know maybe I'm stereotyping.  
Yet still I lay, I could hear the shift of the water as they stepped off the boat and picked me up, I never looked at them, not yet, I didn’t get a chance. They brought me to my feet again. Taking a look around my surroundings it was damp, I couldn’t make out anything significant in the darkness, I could barely see 15 feet in front of me, all around was murky water—I kid you not, up, down, left, and right was damn swamp water—except for a wooden bridge path that I assumed is where they wanted me to go, it was the only place to go. I was timid, I think they could tell.   
“Now walk, c’mon now.” The man with the southern draw said. Yet still I could not move. I did not move.   
I was paralyzed, they wanted me to walk but my legs seemed to not like that. The man came up behind me, he put a hand on my shoulder and I could feel the barrel of his gun on my lower back.  
“Now if you don’t get to fucking walking I swear to god I'll blow a kidney and half your damn stomach out of ya’. fucking. walk.” Texas whispered in my ear. That seemed to fix my paralyzation.  
He kicked me forward pushing me to a knee. You’d have me damn wrong if you thought I wouldn’t be up and moving after what I just got told. I scrambled to my feet and walked, my head stayed down out of fear but it seemed the same, wood panel after wood panel with the odd exception for a missing panel or half a panel or event two missing panels, I mean this thing was old, very, very old. The two men stayed silent through every step, it started seemed like a trait of theirs by now.   
Bridges were always a fear of mine, the fact that you are putting your life in the hands of metal beams made by some deprived and starving dude in the 1930s that probably died trying to build the thing. Always puts me on edge for as long as i’m on one which is why my favorite part about bridges, coincidentally,  was getting off them, it gave me a sense of relief. Stepping off of this bridge did not give me that same sense of relief.  
The soil was muddy and moist, the air was moist too, sticky, I hated being sticky, in fact the ground was also sticky, couldn’t even pick up a foot without a force wanting me to keep it on the ground. Though we were finally on solid land a stream remained to my left, it followed where I went, or maybe I followed where it went. Eventually the stream moved away from me and now it was only me, mud,  and the two mysterious men.   
A gut feeling is an intuitive feeling or response to something even when it may go against what your brain is telling you. For example, though I had kept my eyes firmly on my feet for the entire walk so far I suddenly had a gut feeling to look up. I did so, I still remember the sight vividly, if I had to describe it now I would say it was the entrance to hell but at the time and literally what it was goes as follows: A muddy dirt path surrounded on both sides by fencing, old, old fencing, it still held up though, straight ahead was a sign, almost like the entrance to a summer camp if you know what I'm talking about, like it arches over your head as you walk or drive under it, on the sign the words HILL were carved into it—a family name no doubt. As the fence met where the legs of the sign are it split off to the left and the right and darted into the tree lines that further encompassed the area.   
I kept walking though, how dare I stop, I know I wanted to stop but the threat given to me at the start of this march kept my mind firmly on walking. The rest of the trip wasn’t anything special, the scenery didn’t change for a while after the sign, still more muddy roads and trees, those damn trees. I complain about it now but this would be the last bit of peace I would have for a while. This part has became a blur in my mind, or maybe it wasn’t important enough to remember I don’t really know but the next thing I remember happening is walking towards a church.   
It was an old one, white with pieces of siding missing from its facade. The tower housed a bell at the top and the whole building had a slight lean, an unmistakable lean, maybe even more of a lean than the tower at Pisa. Maybe if you stepped wrong while inside the whole thing would just tip over. Just maybe. But more importantly was in front of the building I could see the cut outs of two men, they were dark, I couldn’t see any details but a light protruding from the head of one of the men.  
As we got closer and I started to pick out the features of the two, the man on the right—the one with the light—was wearing camo pants with a light tan shirt on, his face was wrinkly and worn, dirt in the crevices where the skin folded over, a green bandana seemed to be used only as an accessory on his outfit because he had quite the lack of hair. He also had a lack of fingers at least on his left hand, yet he still had one, his middle finger. What an ultimate fuck you to the world.  
The other one though—the man on the left—didn’t seem to have anything wrong with him, well at least nothing physically wrong with him. He was younger with a black goatee and long wavy hair that matched the color of his beard. He wore a suit vest—a maroon and black one—with a long undershirt that matched the maroon on his vest rolled up to let his forearms free, it looked expensive. His eyes widened as he caught mine, they were bright blue, it felt like he was piercing my skin with his dark and cold stare. He must’ve been the Warden.  
“Ah, got me a good one like you promised uncle.” He said never breaking eye contact with me, craning his neck forward as if he wanted to be close without moving his legs. Strangely he did lick his lips as he said this I recall, that detail still sends shivers down my spine.   
He broke the stare and started circling around me. Touching me. Inspecting me. Circling around one time, two times, three times, maybe even four. It wasn’t quick either, on the last lap he came to look me in my face, maybe 2 or 3 feet away.   
“Why so sad...” he says, he paused to see my response.   
“Wha- wha- what.” I said through fearful breaths, broken words were all I could utter at the moment.  
“Your smile, has it gone into hibernation?” He responds in a calm tone, he had his arms crossed now.  
“I- I don’t know.” I say quickly in one breath.  
“Well now that’s okay...” He leans closer to my face now, maybe a few inches. Close enough I could feel the breath on my skin, his cold breath in the warm air. A smile crept across his face.  
“...You’ll be happy soon” The voice sounded almost darker now, like the voice that someone would use while telling a scary story around a fire. I would’ve done anything to be around some stupid campfire with friends listening to some dumb story right then. I suppose I was living that scary story now.  
He stepped away from me, backing up and spreading his arms out, his wingspan was impressive, almost unnaturally large. I could see Uncle make a movement with his hand and suddenly a rag was put to my face and arms were wrapped under my armpits once again. The chloroform knocked me out pretty quickly, a few seconds maybe, but as my body got let down and my eyesight got blurry I could hear a final few words out of the mans mouth, it sounded as if I was listening to someone talk above water while I was underwater but the words he said, i’m almost sure it is what he said. It has to be what he said.  
“Welcome to the community, son.” I’m almost sure that grin was still spread across his face. That Creepy Smile.
