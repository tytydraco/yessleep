I didn't believe it at first. None of us did. And it's not until today, after the constant stream of broadcasts and breaking news announcements, that I've finally realised just how fucked we all are.

A global pandemic has emerged once again, spreading through the human race via airborne molecules and direct contact. It's faster than 2019...it's deadlier than 1918...I can only imagine how long it'll be this time before I can touch another human...My parents, my partner, my kids...


Interestingly, they're calling it,-Stage One.


**Stage One: "Infection"**


Once infected, people are quickly changing. We already have our own words for it, like it's some sort of trend; *The changing, the turning*. Although, these terms are used mainly by the older generation, while the youngsters are calling it, *modding* or, *altered*.

We're all fucked and it seems like one big joke to some people, or even an investment. I can't see this lasting long though, the sick fuckers.

**Stage two:-Revolution.**


After 106-days of pure hell, what's remaining of the human race, which isn't much, have sought refuge underground. I am one of the lucky few, or, unlucky few, depending on how you look at it.

I hate this. I miss my family.

**Stage three:-Aftermath.**


We've somehow made it work. What with thousands of years of survival information and the modern day brain, we've actually managed to recreate a world viable for a small society to last for decades underground if needed.


A sweet 10-year-old girl called Bella lost her family during Stage One too. We keep each other company down here. She needs a Mom, and, to be honest, I need a reason to live too.


I still hate it here. If you think life was hard before all of this?...HA!

I miss our beautiful planet. I miss the simple things.

**Stage four:-Resurfacing.**


Our soil has been contaminated for multiple years now and our reservoirs are slightly poisoned from the once diseased "people's" blood and decaying remains.


But....we have won!


The human race has *some how* beaten the viral apocalypse. That's what we've decided to call it anyway.


Bella squeezed my hand as we felt the sun upon our faces. 


We're finally home.


**June 27th 2027**


No one could imagine what's come now.


After rebuilding our lives on the surface, albeit very slowly, the nourishment we've sucked and absorbed from the atmosphere, and the food and water we've consumed from the contaminated earth, was no longer working in our favour. It was all poison...a complicated and silent poison, and now...it's very quickly evolving our DNA...


It begins with a rash. The rash starts on the face and then spreads to the hands, forearms, and the torso. The person becomes highly contagious and are highly irrational and delusional. They can lash out at any one who comes near them, scratching and biting. If they successfully break the skin, the next person is doomed.


Within two days of appearance, the rash develops into abscesses that fill with fluid, breaking open and spewing green pus in all directions. The scabs will eventually fall off, taking all remaining layers of skin with it.


By day three, the patient is no longer considered human. They rapidly grow and change their molecular structure, and their rage is something incomprehensible.


I guess this is now, "Stage-Five?"

I have a rash...


Bella has locked herself in the bathroom...


That won't last long.
