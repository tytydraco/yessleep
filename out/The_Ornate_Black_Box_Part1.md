I’m writing this in the hopes that someone out there will find this and take the contents seriously. This is a warning. Do not open the ornate black box with the brass fittings. Let me explain.

My name is Grant. I’m 35 and I don’t know how I ended up here. Well, that’s not completely true. I do know what events fell into place to put me in this whitewashed hell hole, but I don’t understand how or why they happened to me. My life was simple and straightforward. I grew up in a normal town in the middle of the Great Plains. After college, I went on to stumble into a relatively successful career and an adoring wife. I always tried to be pleasant. A glass half full kind of guy and that got me far in life. That was until I found the box.

It all started a few years ago. I got a call from one of my mother’s friends. My phone rang and I rolled my eyes looking at the bright display. I had just settled down for the night after a long week of your regular run-of-the-mill office work. My job was in no way incredibly taxing and I enjoyed it, but it had its days. After a deep breath in, I released all the sarcasm from my voice and tapped the green button. “Hey Susan. What can I do for you?”

“Grant? Have you heard from your mom? She and I were supposed to go shopping at that new outlet mall in town yesterday morning, but I never heard from her. I tried calling a few times, but she hasn’t picked up.”

My eyebrows furrowed together slightly. “No… I haven’t. Is it going straight to voicemail or are you letting it ring?” I didn’t find anything immediately alarming or out of place. My mom would lose her head if it wasn’t screwed onto her shoulders. “She probably just misplaced her phone and forgot.”

“Well” Susan’s light southern accent pitched skeptically through her words. “I’d think that was the case myself if I didn’t just talk to her the day before. We’ve been chatting about it all month. Would you call her for me just to be sure, honey?”

I swiveled back and forth in my computer chair looking at the splash screen of a game I was getting ready to play on my computer. “Sure.” The thought of the adventures I was about to set foot on would have to wait. “I’ll give her a call and let you know if I hear anything.” We said our goodbyes and I hung up the phone. My wife tilted her head, asking me what was wrong. I explained while I brought my phone back up to my ear with my mom’s contact on dial. I remember her scrunch of concern as I heard the ringing tone on the other end. My wife was gorgeous. Curly brown hair and forest green eyes that looked like someone had tossed speckles of amber paint through them. I miss her. The phone rang and rang. No answer. I tried again.

“Nothing?” My wife questioned.

“Nope. Weird. She always answers when I call. She even has that stupid ringtone set just for me. The one of that annoying kid calling for his mom over and over.”

“You may want to consider a welfare check.” As much as I didn’t want to get the police involved, she was right. My mother lived a few towns northwest of us and it would take a few hours to get to her doorstep. Better safe than sorry.

About two hours after getting off of the phone with the police for the check, I received a call back. My mother was found on the floor of her bedroom, severely dehydrated in a pile of her own urine. She had suffered a stroke, but her vitals were still active and she was breathing. The paramedics explained that she had most likely been having seizures on and off for a day or two and was unable to move or comprehend where she was so she could call for help. I was shocked. My mother was the only person I was close to in my family. She was only just past 60. My father and her had been divorced since I was a child and he passed away a few years earlier. “Will she be ok?” I huffed through the phone leaning over in my chair. They explained she was being rushed to the hospital to be treated, but that the worst of it was over. We immediately packed up the car and headed out to drive the handful of hours to reach the hospital. My wife was very comforting the entire time, exclaiming that no matter what, she would be there for me.

I don’t remember much of the drive or walking into the clinically sterile rooms of the ER, but I will never forget seeing my mother for the first time after her stroke. All the machines that were strapped to her body monitoring her vitals made it look like she was trapped in some wicked clinical web of misfortune. Her head turned to me, eyes glazed over and unaware of who I was. They were milky with the haze of brain fog she was clearly experiencing. I didn’t blame her. The doctor said it was one of the worst strokes he had ever seen. A giant blood clot had cut off circulation to one side of her brain for what he presumed had to have been at least 24 hours. It was sad seeing her face drooping to one side, but I didn’t care. She was alive. Unable to speak or use her left side, but alive.

My fingers reached out to gently rub the back of her hand. I was careful not to bump any of her IVs and cause any discomfort. “Hey there, momma. It’s me. It’s your son, Grant.” She looked at me, eyes still as glossy as when I walked in. A trickle of drool bubbled at the corner of her lips and fell onto the course white and green speckled hospital gown she was wearing. I turned around to pull a chair up to her bedside and sit, but stopped when she quickly grabbed my hand. Her eyes were wide, tears welling up in them. I could see the white of her knuckles.

“Baaaagghh!” She forced out. I jumped back, but her hand clung tight to mine in desperation. “BAAAHCUH-SH” The steady rhythmic beep of her heart monitor started to skyrocket. It got faster and faster as she tried to pull me closer. “BAAHKSH! BAAAHKSH! NO BAAAHKSH! NO OPEH! NO!” Footsteps blasted down the hallway as nurses ran into the room. I scrambled back, allowing them room to work.

“She’s having another seizure, please leave.” One of the nurses was already working to keep my mother on the bed and roll her into a safe position. “We’ll get her stabilized and call you when we do.” I took a few steps back, eyes still locked onto my mother’s face. I thought it was twisted in agony or pain, but when the cold glass door of the emergency room slid shut in front of me, I could tell that it wasn’t pain. Her face was drained of all color. It was fear.

By that time, it was late in the night. I was exhausted. The sizzling buzz of the ER parking lot lights were an eerie reminder that we were far from anywhere comfortable. I didn’t have the energy to drive home, so I told my wife to drop me by my mom’s house. I could stay there for the weekend and she could go home to make sure the dogs were taken care of. Despite her plea to stay and comfort me during that hard time, I assured her that I would be alright. My mom lived in a quiet neighborhood. The kind that is surrounded by white fences and full of old retirees. Besides, I had a spare key for the place and I was likely going to need to spend the money we would use to board the dogs for the weekend to repair any damage caused by police officers or firefighters breaking into the house for the welfare call. In the end, my wife conceded to my request and drove me to the house.

After arriving, we exchanged a long hug and a few kisses. I pushed the key into the lock of my mother’s front door. It clicked over smoothly. Turning around, I waved goodbye and watched my car’s red tail lights disappear around the neighborhood corner. I shut the door behind me and turned the deadbolt. No damage here. They must’ve come in through the back door. Yawning, I walked through the large living room toward the back of the house. Lamps that were left on, likely because they hadn’t ever been shut off, cast light on the high vaulted ceilings. I remember thinking how uncomfortably cold I was, which was unusual for the central US in May. I walked past an old Native American painting. It was an art piece of a tanned figure standing in the middle of a field of lavender blue with white wisp-like clothing draped around her in a flat artistic style. She stared back at me with a blank face. I never really liked that painting and the others like it. Not because they were creepy or distasteful, but because they just really weren’t my style. The frame was crooked, so I adjusted it until I felt like it was as straight as it could be without a bubble level and continued on to the back door.

For what it was worth, the police officers tried their best to minimize the cracks in the siding of the back door. By the looks of the paneling, someone had slipped a crowbar into the wooden frame. It must’ve eventually cracked and given way just enough for them to force the door open. I sighed and gave the deadbolt a twist. There was another satisfying click even though the bolt dragged the entire way through. “At least you didn’t lock yourself up too tight.” I said aloud. I was thankful that the paramedics were able to get in.

I turned to head into my mother’s room through the kitchen. Out of curiosity and some loud prodding from my stomach, I stopped to open up the fridge. The cold, dull light illuminated the contents of the chilled portal. My mom lived alone, so I wasn’t surprised to see a few boxes of leftover takeout in the fridge. My eyes stopped on a box of boneless wings in a bright yellow and brown box. Honey barbecue was my guess and I was right. The receipt sticker on the top of the lid said they had been picked up four days prior. Dinner was served. “Lucky me.” I sighed sarcastically. I didn’t feel like there was much to be thankful for at the time. Popping the cardboard box into the microwave, I shut the front and let the beep of the buttons take me into a brain haze. The loud whirring noise hit my ears and I stared at the warm orange light through the protective mesh of the window. My eyes drooped lazily. I watched the box go around and around again. After a moment, my vision shifted showing my reflection. God. I looked like I hadn’t gotten sleep in days. I guess stress really did wear me down. Motion flickered to my right in the reflection. I didn’t turn at first thinking it was just the dots of the metal grating playing a trick on me. Then, it happened again. This time, it looked like a figure standing right behind me. Cold air curled across my shoulder like that feeling you get when you think you are being watched. I whirled around in a panic only to see there was nothing there. My hand dragged across my face pulling my eyelids down with my fingertips. I took a deep breath in then heard a loud DING! Right behind me. “Shit!” I made another about-face and slammed my hip against the granite countertop. The microwave. Of course. All I could do was shake my head at my reactions and grab the electric-charged chicken wings.

In traditional modern appliance fashion, the surface of the wings had reached the temperature of the sun, so I went around the corner to check on my mom’s room while they cooled on the counter. She always loved large wooden furniture; the gaudy kind that she paid too much for and that was always too big for the room it was in. There were a few picture frames on her dresser. Reaching out, I grabbed one and tilted it up to get a better view. The dim lamp in the corner of the room showed me a picture of one of her five dead husbands. This was the newest one. Bob was his name. I hardly even knew him and they were only together for a few months before he passed due to an illness. I was starting to think my mom was some kind of secret black widow who married men for their money and their life insurance policies. I inhaled deeply through my nostrils only to choke up a cough. That was right. One of the paramedics did say she had been on the floor for more than a day. Stepping around the bed, I could see the dark stain on the ground that wreaked of urine. She must’ve pulled the blankets down with her, because they sat askew off the bed. Did she have her stroke in bed and fall out trying to get help? My thoughts darkened at the notion. It was too soon to think about all of that.

On my way out of the room, I spotted a small ornate black box on her bed. My mother always liked to go antiquing, but I had never seen this particular box before. I picked it up and turned it end over end in my hands. The wood was a deep ebony with soft waves carved into the sides. To me, it looked like the ocean at midnight. Each corner was adorned with a brass bracket to help reinforce the joints. Holding the lid shut on the front was a latch of the same bright metal. Looped through a pin, a lock hung open. My curiosity got the better of me as I pulled the lock from its pin. Pushing up the latch, I opened the box. What I saw inside brought a gut-wrenching curl to my stomach, but it shouldn’t have. It was empty. Blank white inner walls loomed back at me. I slammed the box shut and just like that, the feeling was gone.

Box still in hand, I made my way to the couch in the living room with my honey barbecue wings along for the ride. I sat both boxes down on the coffee table and flipped on the TV. Some old black and white monster movie was playing and I felt a smile hit my lips. My mom loved old monster movies. I remember staying up late just her and I watching Dracula or Frankenstein. We’d curl up in her bed with a bowl of popcorn and she’d tickle me when it got to the scary parts. Needless to say, this creature comfort had me slipping off to sleep after the third boneless wing.

My dreams that night were filled with a spattering of what-ifs. I saw my mom, splayed out on the floor. She looked back at me, the cry for help clear on her face. I tried to reach out, but a large spindly hand grabbed my shoulder and pulled me back out of the room. My heels dug into the carpet beneath me, but it was no use. That bone white hand pulled me back with a strength I was no match for. I heard my mom gurgle out a scream as the door slammed in front of me. “No!” I shouted. “Let me go!” Only to be met with silence and dread. I was continually pulled down a long hallway through another door. Just like the first, it was slammed in my face with a bang.

A second hand came from behind. Long spider-like fingers curled around my face. They dug into my skin, ripping my head back. I forced myself forward only to slip to my stomach. “Let…me… GO!” I grunted out while pawing at the floor beneath me. Two more hands gripped my ankles and yanked me back like I was a sheet of paper being effortlessly torn from a book. I saw door after door whiz passed my eyes. Another. Slam. Another. Slam. Another. SLAM. They came faster and faster until I could no longer keep track of how many I fell through. Falling? I was falling. I could no longer tell what was up or down. I tumbled through doorway after doorway, occasionally slamming my side into a frame. One door I flew past caught my elbow on the knob which forced me into a death spiral. “Stop it! Make it sto-“ My words were cut short with a wet splat. Ears ringing, I opened my eyes. The room was blinding and lacked any details. Above me, I saw a doorway. I couldn’t move. My body was broken and bleeding. Another unnatural hand reached around the edge of the doorway above me and grasped the knob. Salty tears rolled down my cheeks knowing I had no other option but to watch in dread. I saw the face of the door rush towards me. The gap grew smaller.

SLAM! I sat up on the couch shivering in a clammy sweat. The TV host of the late-night monster show was rambling on about how the creature from the Black Lagoon was simply a misunderstood sweetheart. I looked behind me at the guest side of the house. A door to one of the guest bedrooms was opened and I could see out the window. It was still dark outside. To calm my frazzled nerves, I flipped off the TV and swung my feet over the edge of the couch. I needed to check the rest of the house. When I stood, I felt my foot press into something soft and damp. It gave way to my weight and I rolled my eyes. My first thought was that I knocked the rest of the wings off the coffee table in my tossing dream state. “Can’t catch a break, can you?” The annoyance in my voice was so thick you could stir it like honey. That annoyance faded fast when I spotted the leftovers still on the table. “Wait, what?” My eyesight traveled to the floor where the black box laid toppled over not far from my feet. I bent down to pick it up. There was a dark substance that looked to have spilled from the box. Pinching it, I rubbed it between my fingers. “Dirt..?” I examined the inside of the box. It was the same bright white, but at the corners I could see a sprinkling of soil. That didn’t make any sense at all. It was empty. Another slam wrecked my train of thought and my head shot up to the guest bedroom. The door was no longer open. I stood in that living room for what seemed like hours, dead silent. All I could hear was the clock ticking on the wall and my heart beating in my throat.

The gold handle to the guest bedroom creaked then slowly began to turn. “If there is someone in here, I have a gun. I haven’t had a good day and I will not hesitate to empty this thing into you if you don’t say something right now.” I didn’t have a gun, but that’s all I could think to say at that moment. The handle continued to turn ever so slowly until the mechanism inside gave way. “I’m warning you!” I yelled at the door, but my eyes searched for anything that could help. I held the box out in my hand like I was holding a pistol towards the door. The door began to creep open at a sluggish pace like something out of a horror movie. The hinges groaned and creaked loudly in protest. “Screw this.” I darted for the hallway and through the dining room towards the garage where I knew my mom hung her keys. “Please, please, please…” I begged. “Please be there.” The keys hung right where they normally did. Snatching them off the hook, I bolted for the garage door. One of the chairs in the dining room toppled over right as I got into the garage. I smacked the door opener. I was not going to test my luck with whoever was in that house.

I hit the side of the garage with my mom’s SUV door, jumped in, and threw the black box into the passenger seat. Pulling into reverse, my head craned over my shoulder so I could follow the short twist in the driveway. I remember rain pelting the windshield. Through the droplets, my headlights lit up a lanky pale figure. I didn’t care to stick around long enough to see if they had a weapon. I floored it down the road, not looking back. It was hard to see through the rain, so I slowed down a little and reached for my phone to call my wife. The rain was really picking up which made it hard to hear my wife's voice over the drumming of water on the roof.

“Hello? Are you ok? It’s four o’clock in the morning, sweetheart.”

“Listen to me.” I stammered. “Someone was in mom’s house. I don’t know who they were, but I woke up to them slamming one of the doors. I wasn’t staying around to find out what they wanted. I’m in my mom’s car and I’m heading to the police station now down Willow Road.”

“Oh my gosh! I’m so glad you’re okay. Please drive safe, baby.”

“Me too.” I managed to gasp. A prickle of pain ran up my side and down my elbow. Looking over, I was greeted by a large purple bruise. It looked fresh. “How the hell did that get there?”

“What? What’s happening?”

I shook my head. “Nothing, sorry. Call the police and tell them to head to the house. I’ll drive to the station, but I need to focus on the road.” The wipers on my mom’s vehicle were working overtime. Each second, they splashed across the windshield with a rhythmic thud-thud, thud-thud, thud-thud. “I’ll let you know when I get there.”

“Of course! I’ll do that right now. I love you.”

Before I could get those precious words out of my mouth in response, something big dashed across the street. I dropped my phone into the floorboard and swerved the wheel to the left, barely missing whatever it was. Over correcting, the SUV splashed back to the right catching water under its front wheels. I began hydroplaning at around fifty miles per hour. I did my best to remain calm with a loose grip on the steering wheel and tapped the brake pedal, but I was already completely sideways. I felt the rims of the SUV hit the grass and gravity leave my seat as I pitched over. Blurry street lights mixed with tossed earth through the cracked windshield. They quickly rolled out of view. A splash of cold water hit my face. I was launched out of the driver side window and into the ditch.

I coughed up murky water and flailed for purchase on something. My feet weren’t touching the bottom. The rain waters were sweeping me down the ditch towards a barred drain at the end. My back connected with the bars. Thud. I did my best to right myself, but I was having a difficult time feeling my limbs due to the crash. I could see the wheels of my mother’s SUV turned towards the sky, steam emanating from the vehicle’s undercarriage. Managing to turn myself around, I grabbed hold of the bars, but couldn’t push myself past the rushing flood current. Cold iron pressed against my face. After some time, I was able to see into the large drainage tunnel. The rain had let up enough that the morning sun was peeking over the horizon. Light reflected off the water and up into the tunnel in eerie hues of orange. A familiar item floated past me. I followed it with my eyes, head cocked over to one side in exhaustion against the bars holding me back from getting swept away. It was the black box.

It floated a little way down the tunnel then stopped. Was it caught on something? Long white fingers emerged from beneath the brown water surface and wrapped themselves around the box. My blood ran cold as the rain that hit my neck. I watched the box rise out of the water. A humanoid figure, pale as snow, rose from the water clutching the object. It hunched over the box. I couldn’t make out any features on its face, but its skin stretched taught over spinal ridges and gnarly joints. It was unnatural, whatever it was. It turned to look at me. With a curious canter, its featureless face wandered back and forth like it was sniffing the air in search of something. It stopped after taking a few steps closer to me. My eyes widened. With a slow, gruesome rip, its skin tore where a mouth should have been. Rows and rows of serrated teeth smiled back at me behind tattered lips. The edges of this thing’s mouth kept widening until I could no longer see the corners. My vision went blurry and the last thing I remember of that crash was the figure taking another step towards me, jaw unhinged.

I woke up in the back of an old couple's car. The people in my mom's town have always been friendly, but I didn't ever think I'd be indebted to people I hardly know. The husband's name is Frank. He said his son is a doctor that we could go see right away. I need medical attention and they are offering. I'm not going to look a gift horse in the mouth. We're on our way their now and they've let me use their phone. I had to get this out somewhere while the details are still clear. I'll write again soon.
