Hey, so…Have you guys ever, like, watched the trees in a storm before?

Or, anything similar, really – Windy days, drizzles, hell, hurricanes even! Doesn’t matter, just anything that makes the trees swish and howl underneath the force.

Because I’ve been here, sitting at this window for, like, twenty minutes now, and though it isn’t *storming* necessarily, it’s definitely windy. Windy, as in, tornado levels of windy, the crashing of all the nature outside my home is why I even checked in the first place. And, while I’m not an expert necessarily on physics or, storms or anything, what I’m seeing here doesn’t exactly look…*rriiigght?*

One of the bushes is swaying the *opposite* direction.

No, like, the *entire opposite direction.*

How do I describe it? Uhh…So my yard is pretty big, I’d say. Clean mostly, imagine this small little white house surrounded by a good 25 yards worth of grass, with a nothing but trees and shrubbery trapping it all in: Yeah, that’s me. It’s an older house I think, middle-of-nowhere type thing, my parents have been doing a good job keeping it looking nice.

Well, in the middle of this yard out front, there’s this sorta weird, shrubby, bush-sprout-sapling thing, that’s been there since before we’ve moved in. My parents have been planning on getting rid of it for a while now, saying it sticks out or looks ugly or yada-yada-yada- I don’t know. I’ve never payed any attention to it until now honestly, besides maybe a passing appreciation for its beauty (Have any of you ever seen a white bush before?? Wild!) but now that I’m here? Watching it under the wind? This is the first time I’ve ever noticed something directly *off* about it.

The trees sway left? The bush yanks right. The trees sway right? The bush yanks left. Isn’t that weird?

This is my first time posting here, so forgive me if this breaks the rules lol, but I’m hoping someone here is some plant expert or something. Or, a wind expert? A physicist? Anyone who’s got an explanation, really. Thanks (:


**EDIT**: Okay so some people are asking me what the bush actually *is.* Uhh…I’m not sure, really. It’s about knee-height (So like, a foot and a half?), white leaves like I said, white branches too I think? For the guy who asked what the leaves looked like; uhh…It’s got six “points” or whatever you call them, sharp too! I think I cut my finger while I was trying to take a pic, only for this subreddit to not allow photos, sigh…Oh well. Keep you all updated!

**EDIT 2**: Holy shit. Okay, I don’t know how this happened, but literally just this morning, I checked outside on the bush, and oh my god.

It fucking *grew.*

It GREW.

No, I mean it; it’s not even a bush anymore. It’s not even a damn bush! I cannot stress this enough; I’ve been living here for eight years now and not once has it changed, yet I wake up after making this post *one day ago* this morning, and it’s a fucking *tree.*

My finger hurts like hell too. It burns like the worst paper cut I’ve had in my entire life, it doesn’t look that bad, but man…I swear, I can feel the pain all the way down to my bone. I woke up with blood all over me, all over the sheets, my shirt – God! Guess that narrows the search, for all of you still looking for the species of this thing: White, poison ivy bush-tree-thing that somehow grows overnight. Who woulda thunk! If any of you can find some ointment or cream for whatever it is, then please tell, because… Geez…

Everyone’s been freaking out about it. My parents are stumped, my brother’s laughing about it on the phone, they’re all gathered outside now as I type this. It’s..weird. If I were to guess, it’s around 15 feet tall, with big bunches of those same white leaves I described in my last edit. The bark is this grayish-white too, just like the bush – besides from this one spot on the side here with some smudgy, red hue. 

Least my parents are finally doing something, lol. My dad’s calling the tree-chopping guys down town, but it’s gonna take a while for them to get all the way here: Middle of nowhere and all, yada-yada…We’ll be closing off the area until then. You know, in case it’s some new, undiscovered species and all, my brother’s bragging about how he’s gonna steal it and get rich, lol.

My dad says not to go near until then, and I’ve put a bandage over the cut to stop the bleeding. It’ll heal in no time, I’m sure; and the tree guys should be here by the end of the week. 

edit: 

I’m sorry.

There’s goinf to be no more updates.

The tree grew this mornimg. A lot more. The leaves blocked out the sun. The roots cracked the earth. I woke up early in pain, a lot if pain. I was drowning in blood. I got up at the crack of dawn to replacw the mbandages, and I passed the windows, and I saw the tree outside. It was huge. It as wrong. It almost reachef the house.

I don’t know why, I went outside. I went to the tree, it was dark, the red spot has grown. It was dark. I coulsn’t see. It was dark, I tripped.

I tripped over the roots. It tore at my knees, my ankles; I scraped everything. I was bleedinf everywhere. It was dark.

I winced, and I tried to grab at my leg, but the roots swayed in the wind. It was daek. My eyes were dark too.

The roots swayed opposite of the wind. And when it was no longer dark, the roots were everywhere. Everything feels wrong gere, the roots are wverywhere, and the wind sways opposite. The wind sways opposite, and I can’t stop bleeding. I can’t stop bleeding. I can’t stop bleed. And everything is dark.

…Where am I?
