[the Burger King Crown Customer](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/DVzyfxwDnZ)

Honestly, I have never liked talking to the local cops, but not as much as I did when they came knocking on my door. My apartment building is in *that* part of town, where its sketchy, you hear gunshots and screams and blatantly ignore it and hope it resolves itself on its own. I’ve heard the cops beating down my neighbors doors so many times, I actually knew a couple of them by name, also they stop in at the gas station to buy fountain drinks and check in and make sure there were no suspicious characters wondering about. 

But opening my door to one of the more friendly of the local cops, Nolan, knocking on my door as I was getting ready for work, didn’t make me start off the night on the right foot. Nolan had explained to me that my boss had put in a missing report for Terry, you know the stoner part-timer that wondered off with the customer in a Burger King crown and cape, that one. 

Before he had knocked on my door, moments before I had watched the local news, I don’t know why I do, I know our city is a shit hole, I know there is a high rate of crime, homelessness, our politicians are idiots. But I still do it out of pure background noise, that is until a report of a missing woman was being talked about. That grabbed my attention. A woman’s body was found on the local hiking trail that started at the base of the mountain by the gas station, but when they reported it and showed her face. 

My stomach sank; I knew her. It was the same woman’s face on the ID shown by the man who bought matches from me just a few nights ago. I remember how he seemed not human, with the blank stare, staring passed my shoulder as whatever behind me held his attention. How I barely glanced at the card before handing over the box. The bloody debit card that was used to pay for said matches. Now, seeing her face again on the news, I realized that encounter forced me to realize that I perhaps had possibly sold her murderer a box of matches. 

Fast forward, after the cliché story of her going hiking up on that trail by herself, and her family never heard from her again, her body found by one of the local rangers who walk those trails ‘just in case’ possibilities. The were a loud knock on my door, and Nolan was standing there with that next door boyish frown. For half a second, I thought he was going to ask me about the woman and the man buying the matches. But no. 

He wanted my statement on the missing persons case that is now Terry. I had relied to him what happened that night, how some weirdo in a Burger King Crown and cape, lured Terry out with some weird quest, and how I tried to tell Terry not to do it but left and disappeared towards that very hiking trail. 

Because everyone goes missing on that trail, every local who lives nearby calls it the Devil’s Path. That winding stretch of dirt and tangled scrub has its stories, rumors so old you can’t tell if they started as warnings or just excuses for why people vanish or end up dead. Some say it’s cursed, some say it’s just the perfect spot for things to go wrong out of sight. But lately, with bodies turning up and reports stacking on top of each other, it feels less like superstition and more like an ugly truth no one wants to face. The moment the cops heard that someone went up Devil’s Path, they instantly knew they weren’t looking for that someone alive anymore.

But it was principle and protocol that the cops have to take the reports seriously even if its for the Devil’s Path. 

Nolan took notes on a notepad and listened to me as I told him what time, and what the guy looked like that lured Terry away. “But he didn’t want to listen,” I said. “He was focused on whatever adventure the guy promised him, like a kid chasing after a magic trick,” I continued, watching Nolan’s pen scratch across the page. I emphasized how Terry seemed almost drawn to the stranger, ignoring every warning I gave.

“Thanks, Arlen, I know this must be hard . . .” he said softly as he clicked his pen. 

I nodded, unsure how to respond to Nolan’s sympathy. The weight of everything that had happened lately pressed down on me, leaving a tightness in my chest. As he tucked his notepad away, there was an awkward silence, as if neither of us wanted to acknowledge the grim reality that Terry probably wasn’t coming back. The world outside my door felt colder than usual, and for a moment, I wished I could forget all about the Devil’s Path and the ghosts it seemed to collect.

But life moved on and if I didn’t start leaving now, I was going to miss my bus for work, I told Nolan this, grabbing my jacket from the hook by the door. He nodded, understanding, and stepped aside to let me pass, his gaze lingering on the quiet street as I locked up behind me.

“If you see or hear anything, and I mean *anything*, you got my number, call me immediately.” He said with concern. 

I promised I would, though my words felt hollow, swallowed by the uncertainty swirling in my thoughts. As I stepped out onto the porch, the air felt thick with memory and dread. Each footstep toward the bus stop echoed with questions I didn’t want to ask and answers I doubted would ever come. In the quiet, I glanced back at my apartment complex, half-expecting to find Nolan still watching, hoping for a sign, any sign, that things might turn out differently this time.

It didn’t matter who you asked, those who grew up in this city knew things that sounded weirder than what went on at the gas station. Its not just the Devil’s Path, but its certain areas, there is also a legend about one of the parks near me, if you walk passed it at a certain time at night, you’ll see swing sets moving back and forth as if were children swinging and hear their laughter on the wind. 

Some folks swear they’ve seen tiny handprints left in the dew on those swing sets come morning, and others refuse to walk past after midnight, claiming the shadows underneath look all wrong. There’s even talk of an old oak tree at the park’s edge, where people leave trinkets hoping to appease whatever lingers after dark. It’s just another patch of earth the city avoids when the sun goes down, stitched into the fabric of local caution the same way Devil’s Path is.

But its all about how you deal with it, how you cope with knowing the grim and dark history of our dreary city, surrounded by mountains, rain, and occasional skin walker. Most of us shrug and go about our business, that’s why when an out-of-towner comes in and sees or hears something strange, they are aghast at our nonchalance about it. Because to us, it’s a normal Tuesday haunting. 

As I waited at the bus stop, I couldn’t help thinking, if I had had questioned that ID the guy held, would he have harmed me? would I have been killed and dragged to Devil’s Path too, or would I have been stuffed in the cooler like Jimmy? It was another overnight shift story, Jimmy was one of the best employees who could handle anything, Mary mentioned once he helped write the overnight manual to help other newbies. But according to whom you ask, how he ended up dead in the cooler. 

Some said it was an accident, others whispered it was something more sinister. a message, maybe, or a warning for those who poked around too much after dark. No one talked about it openly, but the story lingered like a chill draft, passed between shifts with uneasy glances and half-finished sentences. I wondered why these places, these stories, always seemed to find the ones least prepared for them, and whether I'd ever really believe what is said unless I see it for myself. 

The bus ride to work was per usual with the same riders as me, occasionally there’s a weirdo or two. Tonight, the regulars sat in their usual spots: the older woman with her tote bag full of knitting, the tired man in the stained uniform scrolling through his phone, and the college kid staring blankly out the window with headphones on. The city rolled past in streaks of orange and blue, streetlights flickering over puddles and empty storefronts. Every so often, a new face would get on, eyes darting as if searching for something, but most of us just kept to ourselves, wrapped in routine and quiet understanding that some things were better left unspoken.

The only good thing about starting my shift was finding out that Daren was able to come back, still recovering but seemed well enough to pester me. I did miss the guy, even though we worked one shift, he rarely asked me a million questions how to do something or leave a trail of mess like Terry. I watched as his eyes lit up, seeing me walk in, I’d heard he had an arm sling, but he wasn’t wearing it. But he still had a huge white bandage on his forehead above his right eyebrow where he got his stitches. 

The moment I saw him, I slugged him in the shoulder that was the one that was dislocated, “nice to see you survived.” I’d said. 

“For one, ouch,” Daren said, rubbing his sore shoulder where I’d just slugged him. “And B, why does the mustache have a name?” His gaze flicked to the tip jar on the counter, the one I used to contain the supernatural, sentient mustache. Written with permanent marker across the glass in surprisingly neat handwriting was the name “Reginald,” permanently marked for all to see.  

“You can thank Terry; he thought the stash needed a name.” 

“*Terry*? Who the heck is that?”

I forgot that Daren is a transfer from a sister store from across the city, so I had to explain to him he *was* a part-timer during the day but worked with me after the incident with Reginald. but he’s gone missing, and I told the story again for the third or maybe the fourth time of how Terry gone missing. 

After the greetings and catching each other up on stuff, Daren told me about how they had to numb up his forehead to stitch, and how the cops hounded him about the incident. He described how the officer in charge kept circling back to the same questions, like they were looking for a slip-up, his answers scrutinized for inconsistencies he didn’t even know could exist. 

Daren’s voice had that edge, a mix of irritation and fatigue, as he recounted the way the fluorescent lights of the station had made his headache worse and the endless forms he’d signed, all while the bandage itched beneath the tape.

But concluded, they got tired of asking and finally let him go, apparently Daren isn’t as likable as I am. I tell them the same thing, and they let it go, Daren on the other hand got the third degree. 

I also told him about the call I got, “I don’t know who I was being warned about,” I shrugged my shoulders. Which reminds me, I still need to get a new number. I even showed him the creepy unknown text I had gotten. 
Daren’s eyes were fixed on my face, as if he was contemplating whether to wrap me in bubble wrap or report this to the police too.  

He didn’t say anything for a moment, just tapped his fingers against the counter, lost in thought. The silence stretched out, heavy with all the things neither of us wanted to admit, not about Terry, not about the tip jar, and definitely not about that unnerving message. I could tell he was weighing whether all this weirdness was turning into something more dangerous, or if we were just letting our nerves get the best of us.

“Don’t worry too much about it, I’m sure its just some dipshit messing with me,” I’ve got scammer calls all too often. It felt like that, I wasn’t that concerned about the warning I was being given. 

Still, there was an uneasy edge to his silence, a kind of tension that lingered in the air. Even though I tried to brush it off, deep down I couldn't help but wonder if this time was different, if there was more at play than some random prank. 

After that, the night went on like any other night. Except for two events that happened on our shift, the first one was more of a don’t pay-it-any-attention. I didn’t want to stress Daren out more than he was, and he volunteered to do it anyway. I’d warned him about the freezer ghost knocks, not to open the door. 

He gave me a skeptical look and asked, “what happens if I do?” 

“I don’t know, why don’t you find out.” I challenged him. 

Daren took my advice and didn’t open the freezer door when there was knocking. He just stood there for a moment, staring at the handle, then shook his head and stepped back, muttering something about not wanting to tempt fate. I could see relief on his face as the knocking had eventually faded away, leaving only the steady hum of the cooler around him when I would check in on him.

But the peace was over before I knew, when I heard a loud crash and Daren screaming. It was the type of scream you’d hear in a horror movie, it didn’t sound real, but real enough to make you think twice. 

My heart jumped into my throat, and for a split second, I froze. Then instinct took over, and I rushed toward the source of the noise, adrenaline surging through me. The cooler or the vault was a mess, boxes toppled over, cans and bottles rolling across the cement floor, and Daren standing in the middle of it all. Breathing hard and wide-eyed. It took a moment before he managed to get any words out, but when he did, his voice was shaky with genuine fear.

“There was a face, it said my name,” his words tumbled out as I looked at what had startled him. 

I peered further into the cooler, in the far back behind some energy drinks, was a huge jar filled with pickled eggs. First of all, gross, and second, why were there pickled eggs hiding behind energy drinks? That wasn’t there the night before. Or at least I don’t remember it being there, it could have been, and I just ignored it. 

“I’m sorry, what?”

Trembling in fear, Daren repeated himself, voice barely above a whisper: “There was a face in the jar, and it said my name.” His words hung in the cold air, making it really hard not to laugh at his words. 

Trying to hold back a smirk, I shot back, “So what, did the pickled eggs ask if you wanted to join them in their salty brine, or was it more of a friendly hello?” I couldn’t help but let a little laugh slip out, the absurdity of his story making it impossible to stay serious.

I know I got it. The mustache, the freezer ghost, and all the other oddities of this store, but I couldn’t help but mess with him. I wasn’t sure if I should take him seriously or not, because it comes down whether you accept the weird things that go bump in the night in this gas station, or you fear what’s in it. 

He glared at me, “not funny,” he hissed. “You think I’m making it up.” He shot another uncertain look at the pickled eggs. “And I love pickled eggs, why does this have to ruin it for me?” 

I walked in and walked over towards the pickled egg jar and swished the contents around to see if I spot a face in it. I didn’t. I even knocked on it, “Hello? Anyone trapped in there? No?” I looked at him, the same look a parent gave, a trembling child who wanted the closet to be checked for monsters. “See, no face.” 

All the blood drained from his face, his lips trembled, “its grinning at me.” he whispered, the cold air in the cooler made his breath visible. 

I turned back around and saw no face, just the pale eggs bobbing in cloudy brine. The silence felt heavy, broken only by the hum of the cooler and Daren's shaky breathing. “We could put Reginald next to it, and have it watch the eggs.” 

Daren didn't seem amused by my attempt at humor; his eyes darted between the jar and me, desperate for reassurance. I tried to lighten the mood, but the way he hugged himself and kept glancing over past my shoulder made me uneasy. I believed him, we were just both a little too tired and jittery for our own good. Still, the way that jar sat there, quietly looming in the corner, made it hard to shake off the creeping sense that something wasn't quite right.

I grabbed the pickled eggs and took them out on the floor with me, and set the jar next to Reginald, who didn’t seem to like the idea. The mustache hit the glass jar of his own prison, as if trying to get away from it. “You too? I don’t see anything in it.”  The murkiness of the brine looked so old, I wondered if it really was brine or something else. 

Daren stayed in the cooler longer than I liked but during that time I had an encounter I know I couldn’t tell Daren about, knowing it would scare him to death like the invisible face in the pickled eggs. While I was wiping down the counter, I caught a flicker of movement outside the front door, something pale and quick that darted out of sight before I could turn. 

My hands froze, rag midair, as the hum of the lights seemed to grow louder for a second. I told myself it was just a trick of the fluorescent bulbs, but a chill crawled up my spine, lingering far longer than I wanted to admit.
That’s going to be a nope, I glanced towards the brightly lit up pumps, Sweeper was nowhere in sight, I figured it must have been them just right outside the door. I went back to wiping the tables, I got that eerie feeling I was being watched, and flicked my eyes back at the door, and a scream froze in my throat, until my brain comprehends what was staring at me from outside. 

A deer. 

Weird. 

Deer don’t usually come through here, if any at all. Perhaps it came from the Devil’s Path. I didn’t make an attempt to go outside; I stayed rooted where I was. In fact, I was questioning how a deer could be this far in the city. And why was it outside the gas station, its big round eyes, and yet something was off, it stared at me with big black eyes that seemed to glint like cat’s eyes do in the dark. Do deers eyes glow? 

I couldn't shake the thought that maybe it wasn’t a deer at all, not really. The way it held my gaze felt deliberately almost human, almost challenging. Shadows from the flickering neon sign danced across its fur, making it look ghostly and unnatural. My heart thudded in my chest as I considered whether I should call Daren, but I stayed quiet, not wanting to draw attention to myself, or to whatever that thing was on the other side of the glass.

It was like something wearing the shape of a deer just well enough to fool me, but not quite well enough to put me at ease. The hair on my arms stood up as its eyes seemed to bore right through the glass and into me, silent and unblinking.

*“invite it in …”* a voice said, I glanced around furrowing my brows. 
My breath caught, and I almost laughed at how ridiculous that suggestion sounded, but the words slithered through my mind with a weight I couldn't ignore. I pressed my lips together, shaking my head as if I could dispel the echo, but the urge lingered, an insistent, prickling itch at the base of my skull. For a moment, the world seemed muffled, the only sound of my own heartbeat thumping unevenly in my ears.

I walked closer towards the door, the deer’s head tilted like a dog, his eyes perked and flattened and went straight up. That gut feeling that something wasn’t right, it didn’t sit right in my stomach. 

It opened its mouth, and the disembodied voice, not the one I just heard, but this was much deeper, much more bone chilling. “Ar—len,” it paused. “Arlen …” and paused again and I shook my head, I took several steps backwards, I wasn’t going to mess with a talking deer. “Come outside …” somehow its voice shifted from that deep unsettling tone to Daren’s voice. 

“I don’t know what you are, but please leave.” I mustered the calmest tone I could. Inside I was flipping out, I was internally freaking out, I’ve never delt with something like this before. 

The deer took several steps back and lifted its front hooves and started standing like a human, not like a deer who magically discovered it could stand on its hind legs, but its hind legs were more human shape than deer shape. 

Its body twisted, joints popping as if trying to remember how to move like a person. The skin stretched and rippled, fur thinning in odd patches, and for a split second, I swore I saw fingers where hooves should be. A chill ran down my spine, and I stumbled backward, my mind scrambling for any explanation that didn’t involve the supernatural. Whatever stood before me now was neither fully deer nor human, but something in between that was caught mid-transformation, and every instinct told me to run.

I heard the cooler door opened with Daren let out a low burring noise, when I whipped my head towards his direction than back to the front door, the deer humanoid was gone. What was left was an empty spot. 

For several seconds, I just stared, expecting the thing to reappear, my heart still pounding and the air thick with unease. The neon sign buzzed louder than before, casting fractured shadows over the linoleum, and I realized I was trembling. My mind raced, grasping for rational explanations, maybe it was a trick of the light, or my nerves playing games. But deep down, I knew this encounter would haunt me, lingering in the corners of my memory long after the night was over.

“You, okay? You look like you saw …” then his eyes flickered to the pickled eggs in the jar. “You saw the face too, right?”

I didn’t answer. My throat felt tight, and words hovered just out of reach as I stared at the jar, searching for some reassurance in the glassy murk. My silence seemed to hang between us, thickening the tension, and I could tell Daren sensed something was off before I could admit it myself.

Slowly I crept over to the front door and opened it, just slightly, to see if whatever that deer humanoid thing was still there. But what I saw on the ground was much worse. A blood stained ID was on the sidewalk right outside the door. I bent down and picked it up and flipped it over to see the woman from the news I saw earlier, the ID I saw the man use those few nights ago, the picture of her face staring back at me. 

And I heard a woman’s voice in the distance, from the shadows. “Ma’am, can you come and help me, please help me, *please* . . .” I shut the front door. 

“What’s that?” Daren asked. 

Before he could see, I shoved it in my pocket, not wanting to explain or even look at it any longer. My hand shook as I did it, trying to act casual while my mind reeled with questions and dread. “Its nothing, nothing at all.” 
He stared at me skeptically.

His gaze lingered on my pocket, clearly unconvinced. The silence pressed in, broken only by the steady hum of the refrigerator and the distant rattle of branches against the window. I tried to steady my breathing, forcing myself to focus on the mundane, but every sound now seemed tinged with menace, every shadow suspect. I wondered if Daren could hear the tremor in my voice or see the fear etched across my face. 

“Really, its nothing . . .” I looked back at the glass door. 

The reflection warped as headlights swept across the parking lot, and for a split second, I thought I saw antlers silhouetted in the shimmer. I blinked, desperate to ground myself in reality, but the feeling of being watched crept in, colder and sharper than before. I fiddled with the hem of my uniform shirt. 

“I just dropped something . . . “ I said as Daren watched me, I didn’t want to implicate Daren in anything, I wasn’t sure why I kept the bloodied ID in my pocket, but somehow, I felt like I should keep this from Daren for now.
