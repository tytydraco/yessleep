I didn’t want to write this. The words don’t come easily to me. But on the advice of my therapist, I’m willing to try. She thinks it will help. And at this stage, what do I have to lose?

She told me to just be honest and not worry about what anyone thinks of the quality. With that in mind, maybe this will be written and stuffed into a dusty drawer or a folder marked ‘For my eyes only…Actually, for nobody’s eyes only. Ever’. I don’t know. I’ll give it a go. So here goes. Here’s what I remember:

\*\*\*

My name is Chris and I’m 44 years old. At about 3pm on August 14th 2016, myself, my younger brother David and my two sons, Lucas and Billy, aged 11 and 10 at the time, entered the line for the *Stampede* roller coaster at *Golden Spur Adventure Park* near Charlotte, North Carolina. Any theme park fans can skip the following description but for those who aren’t part of the white knuckle brigade (and I count myself amongst their flock), Stampede opened on May 3rd, 1993 and was a hypercoaster - that’s a rollercoaster with a height or drop of 200 ft or more. Track length or top speed can vary (5,057 ft and 72 mph for Stampede, if you want to know), as long as the all-important height of 200 ft is met. Stampede wasn’t the world’s first hypercoaster - that belonged to *Magnum XL-200* in *Cedar Point*, and I promise that’s the end of the coaster trivia - but it had one crowning distinction: it was the first hypercoaster to be near enough on my doorstep.

I watched it being built. My schoolbus passed Golden Spur everyday; a cruel joke if there ever was one, to be ushered past a place of utter joy and delivered to a place of utter despair. Everyday my friends and I would gawk out of the windows, hoping to see more of the gleaming purple track reach up into the sky. There was always a slight disappointment on the rides back from school if we couldn’t see any progress, though we’d always disagree. *It’s definitely got higher*, I said. *What? It’s just the same. They need to hurry the fuck up*, Brian said. He was my best friend at the time. But as May 1993 neared, the construction seemed to go into overdrive, almost as if the construction workers were hurrying to satisfy us. Everyone showed their appreciation by gawking through the glass even more. Everyone, except for Philip.

Philip was in our group but very much on the periphery - literally. Whenever we hung out, he’d always stand slightly apart from us, as if worried that if he stood any closer we’d notice him, realize we didn’t need him and then cast him out. He was an awkward kid. Bad clothes, bad face and physique. He didn’t smell but we didn’t shut down the rumors to the contrary. I went to his house once, forced to by Mom who pitied him and had promised his mother I’d visit, and I remember smirking when I found out he still had an ordinary Nintendo well into the era of the Super Nintendo. I told the rest of the gang and we laughed, no doubt when Philip was standing just a few feet away. He probably forced a laugh himself to fit in. Yes, he was very much on the periphery and we did everything we could to keep him there.

My friends knew why Philip would only sneak quick glances at the rollercoaster. *Does it scare you, Philly?* Peter T would ask, adding a stretching, whining sound to turn ‘Philly’ into *‘Phiiillllyyy’.* Whether he was scared or not was irrelevant, though I suspected he was. He was the weakest of the group so he was the easy target. Whenever we passed the giant steel snake looming on the horizon, we’d return to our favorite subject. *You won’t go on it. You’re too much of a pussy*, Charlie B shouted. *I will. I’m not scared*, Philip would shout back and we’d all laugh.

We didn’t have to wait long to test whether Philip was a pussy. On May 1st 1993, as part of a big press event to celebrate the rollercoaster’s launch, Golden Spur invited local schools, including ours, to come and ride Stampede. It was going to be the best day ever. And Brian cooked up an idea to make it even better.

\*\*\*

Just after 3pm on August 14th, 2016, my younger son Billy whined.

‘*Eighty minutes*? Do we really have to wait eighty minutes, Dad?’

He had just spotted the digital sign that showed the line waiting time and now his enthusiasm for riding Stampede - an enthusiasm that woke me up by diving onto my bed at 6:30 a.m. - had waned.

‘Don’t worry, it will be more like forty and it will move fast.’ I knew Golden Spur operations were solid - operations referring to the efficiency of the staff at loading and unloading passengers, a crucial factor that affects waiting time. Again, I’m a theme park fan. Plus they were running two trains on the track. No way it would be eighty minutes. But my confidence didn’t convince my son who gave me an unsure look.

‘I promise,’ I added.

‘OK,’ he said, looking at the ground.

‘Yeah it will definitely be forty’, Lucas said. I smiled. My oldest had a habit of taking my side in almost everything.

I felt vindicated when we turned the corner and arrived in the first section of the snaking line to find it was empty.

‘See, what did I tell you? Thirty minutes tops.’ But before Billy could acknowledge he should have more faith in his dad, he and his brother ran off, rapidly ducking their heads underneath the wooden beams that formed the line barrier.

‘I remember doing that at their age,’ David said. ‘My back would scream at me if I tried now.’

‘Mine too.’

My brother and I took the more dignified approach and threaded along the entire path, left and right, left and right. Billy and Lucas giggled at us. We must have looked ridiculous to them, walking up and down the empty line, obeying the rules like stiff robots, when no one was around to tell us otherwise. *Wait till you’re our age boys,* I thought.

After we caught up with the boys and they led us through a few more empty lanes, we finally arrived at the back of the line - or more precisely, at the back of a group of sweaty teenagers whose shirts stuck to their skin. From here the line led to a staircase which climbed to the second floor aka the boarding area, where people would huddle around their desired riding row. The fearless would gather at the front row, but fellow rollercoaster fans would always gather where the best g-forces were to be found: right at the back.

As the ride ‘boarding and dispatch’ area was above us, we’d hear the clamber of feet rushing onto the ride through the roof , followed by the hydraulic hiss of closing shoulder restraints and then excited whoops and exaggerated screams as the coaster’s brakes were released and the train rolled out of the station. Then the people on the first floor would catch sight of the riders, some thrilled, some terrified, as the train dipped down, turned a corner and began its long climb up the first drop. This process repeated itself every ninety to one-hundred and twenty seconds, provided the Golden Spur staff were on form, and on that day it looked like they were. *Definitely thirty minutes*, I thought.

‘How long does it take to climb to the top, dad?’ Lucas asked. He tried to sound as nonchalant as possible, but I could tell his nerves were starting to fizz. Indeed, I knew days before, when he asked me ever-so-casual questions - *erm, how long does it last? ... How high is it?* \- that he wasn’t keen on the coaster, unlike his daredevil younger brother. But there was no way he was going to gift him the everlasting bragging rights of being the sole rider while he watched from the sidelines.

‘How long? Twenty seconds, if that,’ I said. It was more like thirty-five, but for some reason that number sounded too high and I didn’t want to give his nerves the fuel they needed to bail. Sometimes a kid needs to hear a little lie to push themselves. He nodded, buying my fib, and went back to talking to his brother.

David gave me a wry look.

‘You know he’ll count it as we go up,’ he said quietly.

‘By then it will be too late. Am I a terrible father?’

‘The worst.’ He smiled and folded his arms over his big chest. ‘Shall we do this one, then the log flume, then get something to eat?’

‘Sounds good.’

David and I then chatted about how the Knights were sucking that season, a conversation subject we’d deployed numerous times before. My brother and I loved each other but we weren’t close and in those kinds of relationships you need pull-in-an-emergency topics. The Knights’ woes were a reliable go-to of ours. After a couple of minutes we’d exhausted the subject and settled into an agreed, well-earned moment of unembarrassed silence.

I wished he’d kept it going, but when I saw him stare at the teenage boys ahead of us I knew what he was going to say before he even said it.

‘Hey, do you remember…

‘Don’t,’ I said, shooting him a cold, *shut-the-fuck-up* stare that came out of nowhere. He shut the fuck up and nodded, instantly catching my meaning. *Not in front of my sons, David. I know what you were talking about, but not in front of them*.

Our silence became awkward and we’d used up all our baseball ammo. The truth was I had been thinking about *it* too since I’d spotted the teenage boys. They were a gangly bunch much like my friends. I hadn’t thought about it at all much over the years. Things that feel like they’re going to be forever burned into your brain fade away with time and its companion, maturity. Would I have thought about it if the teenage boys weren’t there? To my shame, probably not.

But I think it was around then, in that silence with David - and I can’t be 100% sure because this is where my memory becomes hazy - that I felt what I can only describe as a profound sense of disquiet. That word might seem too slight, but that’s what it was. Not agitation, certainly not dread. Disquiet. And I found its presence in the place of utter joy disturbing enough.

I put it down to seeing the teenagers and remembering what David was clumsily referring to, but even then I knew it couldn’t be explained by mere guilt for past actions. I felt the guilt in my stomach, but the disquiet, that wasn’t inside me. That was outside, in the air, lurking around.

Then again I might be remembering this all wrong. I might have been laughing and joking the whole time in that line and felt zero disquiet whatsoever. It was over eight years ago. Maybe I’ve made it up. At least that’s the lesson my therapist tries to teach me; that I’ve - and I’m paraphrasing her - “Created a fiction where I was mystically forewarned over what happened to compound my feelings that I could have avoided it.” Maybe she’s right. But I don’t think so.

Another train left the station and the line moved forward.

\*\*\*

I never believed Brian created his idea. I figured he stole it from some other kid in some other school who probably stole it from another kid in some other school. But when he pitched it to us in the lunchtime cafeteria, checking beforehand that Philip wasn’t around, we didn’t care about who the legitimate author was, we only cared that it sounded like the coolest, funniest prank ever.

This was ‘his’ idea: Stampede had a purple-coloured track. That meant it had purple-coloured nuts and bolts. So what if we got hold of some nuts and bolts, painted them purple, then one of us sits next to Philip on the ride, and as we’re climbing up we sneak the nuts and bolts out from our pocket, show them to Philip, and tell him that we just found them underneath his seat. Imagine the look on his face when he thinks his seat isn’t bolted on right. He’ll shit his pants!

It was genius and more importantly it didn’t require a lot of effort from a bunch of lazy thirteen year olds. Peter volunteered to source the nuts and bolts from his dad’s tool shed and Charlie said he could supply the paint and the labor; that made sense as he was the best amongst us at art, though slapping on some cheap purple gloss wasn’t exactly going to stretch his burgeoning talent.

That left someone to fill the role of ‘one of us’ - i.e the person who would sit next to Philip and be the prank’s front man. There wasn’t much discussion on that job. I was viewed as the funniest of our group and the most theatrical, though that boiled down to being in the school play. I didn’t object to carrying out the prank. In fact I jumped on the offer, knowing that it would go down as one of the all-time best and I’d be at the center of the glory. Yes, despite my therapist’s protestations, I was a real asshole as a kid. No, it’s not true that all kids are. Some are on the side of decent, I was firmly lodged on the other side.

A few days before our school’s visit to Golden Spur, Peter and Charlie completed their tasks and I took delivery of three shiny purple nuts and three shiny purple bolts. I then had to carry out the next phase of the plan: making sure Philip rode Stampede with us. That meant being both extra friendly to him and allaying any concerns he had about riding. I thought the best approach was to be direct.

‘Dude, you’re going to go on Stampede with us, right?’ I asked him in Wednesday morning science class. We never called him ‘dude’ and I could see a vague sense of suspicion come over his face, but it was pushed out by a stronger desire to finally be included.

‘Erm, yeah. I’m not scared of it,’ he said, convincing nobody.

‘I know you’re not, dude.’ I instantly knew that was one too many ‘dudes’, but before his suspicion returned and he smelled a rat I made him the offer he couldn’t refuse.

‘Would you sit next to me?’ *Boom*. Whatever concern he had vanished in a big grin.

‘Yeah sure,’ he said, pulling his grin back a touch so he didn’t look too keen.

*Awww, he thinks he’s part of the gang*, I thought.

‘Where do you want to sit?’ I asked.

‘Erm, I don’t mind.’

‘I don’t want to sit at the front. I’d shit my pants.’ That was a clever touch. Show him you’re the pussy. Get him on side. Win his trust. Yes, I was a real asshole back then.

‘We could sit in the middle?’ He said.

‘Yeah good idea.’ Great idea, Phil. A perfect location; center stage where there’ll be no hiding from our laughter as we all disembark and see your shitscared face.

For the next few days, I was Phil’s best buddy. I made sure he was never alienated and my friends were able to push their acting abilities, smiling, laughing and playing pals with him the whole time. Then May 3rd, prank day, arrived. Our year climbed on board three coaches and I sat with my bestest friend Philip on the twenty five minute drive to Golden Spur, laughing with him all the way.

Three shiny purple nuts and three shiny purple bolts stuffed into my right pocket.

\*\*\*

‘Billy, get down from there.’

He’d been copying one of the teenage boys who’d been sitting on top of one of the wooden barriers. Billy jumped down. The teenager stayed sitting, then slumped down ten seconds later - an amount of time which told me he had decided to come down on his own volition, and not because he heeded the words of a stern man. I smiled to myself. I would have done the same.

We were now on the boarding floor. There was a marked increase in people’s joy from the first to the second floor. Walking up the stairs felt like entering a higher atmosphere of excitement. The train was in sight. People were edging forward, filling in the spaces between each other more quickly than downstairs. Ride time was almost here.

‘Are you OK boys? Excited?'

‘Yeah,’ Billy said.

‘Yeah, dad,’ Lucas said. He didn’t look as nervous now. Excited adrenaline was winning the battle over freaking-out adrenaline. My lie was worth it.

Billy started pulling himself up on the barrier, performing his own versions of tricep dips. Then he’d jump down, take a step forward when space appeared, and pull himself up again. I let him do that. His energy had to go somewhere.

‘Where do you boys want to sit?’ David asked. ‘Front row?’

*Great. Just when Lucas’s nerves had settled. Thanks bro*, I thought.

‘Erm, we could do…’ Lucas said, but I could see his mind screaming *fuck that*.

‘I’ll sit in the front,’ Billy said, providing his brother with no help. I offered a get-out.

‘There’s lots of people waiting for the front. We’ll be here at least another fifteen minutes. Let’s just sit in the middle.’

David got my point and backed me up. ‘Yeah let’s just do the middle.’ Lucas failed to hide his relief.

We walked forward, just two snake lines from the boarding area. I gazed up at the metal roof and grimaced: the faded purple beams were speckled with chunks of dirty, discolored gum. Golden Spur operations obviously hadn’t pushed themselves to attain a one hundred percent cleanliness record. I wondered *how the hell did the gum get up there?* and *how many years has it built up?* Maybe kids in my year had been the first to christen the beams. I certainly didn’t, I wouldn’t dream of being that bad. It’s amazing to think that my oh-so precious moral code would draw the line at hurling gum but was fine with the prank.

Philip. My mind returned back to him. *I* *wonder what he’s doing now?* Then I thought, *duh, you know you can check.* I took out my phone, brought up Facebook, typed his name into the search bar and narrowed the search filters to ‘Charlotte’. Of course there were quite a few Philips, but I knew what my one looked like, adjusting for aging. I scrolled down and spotted a black and white, somewhat pretentious photo of a mid forties man with a thin face, glasses and hair that was fading fast. I dialed back this man’s face twenty years in my head and it more or less matched the Philip I knew. That’s got to be him. I clicked his profile.

And that disquiet I felt earlier turned all the way up to dread.

\*\*\*

I was grateful the right pocket on my shorts had a zipper. If it hadn’t the purple nuts and bolts would have fallen out, especially as we ran, near enough sprinted, all the way from the park’s entrance to Stampede. I made sure Philip was right beside me, slowing down or encouraging him to keep up if I thought he was falling behind.

When we got to the ride, puffed out and already sweating through our shirts, we were thrilled to find the place surrounded by TV news cameras. My mum would tell me later that morning news reporter Gloria Hanford had ridden Stampede and a camera positioned right in front of her face showed her shrieking the whole way. We waved at the cameras as we ran through the entrance, not knowing if they were filming, but promising ourselves we’d watch the news - for the first time ever, no doubt - to see if we were going to be famous.

We almost threw ourselves under the wooden barriers, tackling each one like inverted hurdles. Then it was straight up the stairs and onto the second floor, where eager Golden Spur staff - or at least the ones who could do their best impression of being eager - greeted us. A few more hurdles to duck under and then we were at the track. I quickly counted the rows - there were fourteen of them - and I led Philip straight to number seven, slap bang in the middle. My friends were either side, the really cool kids of our year amassed at the front, and the rest slotted into whatever rows were left.

Another news camera on the opposite platform filmed us boarding. We waved and the cameraman waved back with a lot less enthusiasm. Then an empty train rolled into the station and our whooping and hollering blasted out.

‘Shit, shit shit!’ Brian said, his face bursting with excitement. We each swapped final knowing looks and I performed the ostentatious move of patting my pocket. Philip didn’t notice. He was watching the train come to a stop, the nerves he’d denied sparking inside him.

‘Don’t worry, dude,’ I said. He gave me a weak smile.

The shoulder restraints jolted up, the gates opened and we barged on board. Then we pulled down the restraints, hearing that gear-crunching sound only roller coasters make

‘You good, pal?’ I asked, deliberately swapping out a ‘dude’.

‘Yeah all good.’

Two attendants scampered down both platforms, thrusting the restraints deeper into our bodies if they suspected there was the tiniest chance of us being able to breathe. Luckily they didn’t push down too hard on mine; luckily because I didn’t want my circulation cut off, and luckily because if I was restrained any more I wouldn’t have been able to reach into my pocket and take out my props. What a catastrophe that would have been.

A staff member’s voice came over the PA system: ‘Welcome James Oakland High…’ There was a cheer across the station. ‘...You are about to ride Golden Spur’s newest attraction, Stampede. Reaching speeds of 72 mph and a height of 206 ft, prepare yourself to face the brutal power of the mighty beast of the Great Plains.’ He wasn’t the greatest actor, but we weren’t the most discerning critics and we just lapped it all up. ‘Keep your arms and legs inside the…'

Our attention flat-lined the moment he read the mandatory safety briefing. Then ten seconds later the hydraulics hissed, the train rolled out, and we exploded into cheers. As we turned the first corner, I unzipped my pocket and took a firm grip of the contents inside. They dug into my palm, not going anywhere. We then inclined forty-five degrees back and began the climb, the morning sun warming our faces.

\*\*\*

*‘I’m so sorry Philip…Wish I could have been there for you…I’m in utter shock. Reach out to me if anyone wants to talk.’*

You didn’t need to be a detective to realize that the comments on Philip’s Facebook pointed to him committing suicide. The funeral had taken place at St Christopher’s Church, January 14th 2014, just over two years ago. The invitation, written by his parents, was posted on his wall and showed an enlarged version of the same black and white photo from his profile. That explained what I had dismissed as pretentiousness; this was the artistic, dignified photo people use of their loved ones for their funerals.

I felt a sudden rush of guilt, coupled with a need to dive in and learn everything I could about Philip in an attempt to fill in the last twenty-something years. I tapped on his photos. There weren’t many. A shot of him in an office somewhere doing some office job. Him and a couple of friends out at a bar. No wife, girlfriend or boyfriend for that matter. I then looked at the comments and noticed there weren’t many of those either. The guilt inside of me stirred. It didn’t seem that Philip had lived much of a life. I turned to David.

‘Erm, that thing, what you were going to say before…’

‘Yeah, sorry about that,’ he said.

‘No it’s fine. Erm, did you know about…Philip?'

His head tilted back and let out a deep sigh. ‘Yeah I did. Horrible wasn’t it?’

‘I just found out,’ I said, keeping my voice low. ‘Fucking Facebook.’

‘Shit, really? Yeah it was bad.’ He then saw what I was thinking. ‘Hey, don’t be thinking…you know…’

‘I’m not,’ I said. But I was thinking just that. At least the irrational, paranoid side of me was. That was saying *you might not have caused it, but you didn’t exactly help, Chris. You served him an appetizer of shit in the twelve course taster menu of shit that was his life.* But then the rational side, the one that says you’re not the center of the universe and that people move on, forget things, shake off the past (a side whose voice funnily enough sounds very much like my therapist’s), that side said *what you did had nothing to do with what transpired some twenty years later. Frankly Chris, get a grip*.

We were almost at the boarding rows.

‘Dad, you were right. Thirty minutes on the dot,’ Lucas said, showing me his phone’s clock.

‘Oh yeah, I was.’

‘Are you OK?’ My perceptive son could always tell when I wasn’t.

‘Yeah fine. Just thinking about what we should go on next.’

‘The log-flume,’ Billy squealed, his mind now racing towards the next source of fun.

‘Sounds good,’ I said.

A train pulled out of the station, cheers and pretend screams following behind it. We filled in the space in the middle boarding rows. David and I were in row eight, Lucas and Billy were in row seven …

Row seven. It lit up in my mind. And suddenly the dread swam around me. I could feel it everywhere, distinct and undeniable. I felt the sudden urge to grip the wooden barrier tight, worried that if I didn’t I might faint. David saw my face. I imagined it had turned gray.

‘Bro? You OK?’

I nodded, trying to compose myself. ‘Yeah, just a bit of a shock.’

But the dread was suffocating. My irrational side was banging pans together in my mind.

Another train came in, stopped and its shell-shocked passengers disembarked.

We boarded.

\*\*\*

‘Phil! Holy shit, Phil!...’

I should have been the lead in the school play. My performance was perfect.

‘...Are these from your seat?!’ My hand revealed my props. ‘I just found them on the floor!’

When spitballing the prank, we were pretty sure Philip would be scared. We didn’t think however he would experience abject terror. If we had, would we have gone through with it? Probably, yes.

I remember his eyes flicking rapidly from the nuts and bolts in my hand to my mock concerned face. Then he jolted his head forward to try and look underneath his seat, but the shoulder restraints kept him in place. Then the color rushed out of his face.

‘St…Stop the ride.’ He almost whispered the words, as if he were too embarrassed to say them out loud. In my head I thought, *say them louder Phil. Let’s hear you scream them*. 

‘Please…Stop the ride.’ He managed to push some volume out of his narrowing throat, but not enough to beat the loud *click-click-click* of the roller coaster’s chain, and certainly not enough to satisfy us. Then came a real proper cry:

‘Please! Help! Help me!’ That was more like it. We started giggling. Philip looked at me, his eyes turning white. I could tell he was thinking, *he’s not helping me, he’s not helping me!* And that’s when the real horror set in. He started thrashing wildly against his restraints, his body convulsing with pure, blind panic.

‘Let me out! PLEASE! Let me out! HELP!’

And then whatever residual embarrassment he had left in him disappeared because that’s when he screamed. It was an unashamed, desperate scream that no one could argue was funny. Our giggles, which we had kept to a respectable volume, suddenly turned way down. We didn’t think it would be like this. This wasn’t the cartoony depiction of fright we had imagined. This was horrific. He screamed and screamed, like a man being dragged to his death, which I suppose he thought he was. The scream was ear-piercing. I suddenly felt the need to bring the show to an abrupt end, if not to save my hearing.

‘Philip, it’s just…’

But that’s when we reached the top, our inclined bodies shifting from forty-five degrees to ninety and back to forty-five, and we went over.

Our collective screams were no match for Philip’s. He felt death teasing and prodding him through every twist and turn, every corkscrew and every helix. There was no excitable adrenal rush for him, just sheer awful horror. The ride lasted one hundred and seventy-six seconds for us. I’ve no idea how long it lasted for him.

As the train slowed, I could hear him whimpering and saw tears on his red cheeks.

‘Phil, it was just a joke. You were OK.’

He didn’t respond. I didn’t know if he could hear me or if he was just ignoring me. Brian and Charlie, having not sat where I was and not been up-close spectators to the horrific meltdown, began to resume their giggling. I tried to twist my head and give them a look, but the restraints stopped me from turning.

The train pulled into the station. The restraints released. I got out and turned back to Philip.

‘I swear, it was just…’ And that’s when I realized why he hadn’t said anything to me. His light-red shorts had turned dark-red, a stain moving from the crotch all the way to the hem.

Brian was the first to laugh. Charlie followed a second later. Then everyone crowded around, wanting to see what was so funny. Philip tried to cover the stain with his hands, but it was too big. With whatever dignity he had left, he forced himself out of the train and that’s when the laughter exploded into manic hysterics.

His front stain had a twin. Just a little one, but enough.

Everyone pointed and howled. He looked at me. To this day I’ve never known a look of such painful betrayal. Then he fled. Out of the ride, out of the park. I think he phoned his Mom who picked him up.

Brian and Charlie looked like they were going to pass out from laughing. I pretended to laugh - I knew it was wrong - but I still pretended anyway. Then as we walked out of the ride, we were treated to a final curtain call of unforgettable comedy: the Ride Photo booth.

‘Oh my god! Look!’ Brian said.

There on the screen was Philip, his agony captured for all of us to enjoy again.

‘Shall we buy it?’ Charlie asked.

I had to draw a line. We had our fun. Time to grow a fucking conscience.

‘$3.99? No way. Let’s just go do the log flume.’

\*\*\*

And now here we are: the part I really don’t want to write. But I will. I must.

I wasn’t cheering as we turned the first corner and started the climb. Everyone else was, my kids certainly were. I remember just being very still, almost as if I didn’t want to spook anything.

‘You OK?’ David asked, his face wrought with worry for me.

‘Yeah I’m good.’

I shut any conversation down. I just wanted to do the climb, go over the top, give a few token yells of tepid joy and get to the goddamn log flume.

Stampede’s chain, slick with oil and grease, dragged the train up the track. *Click-click-click-click*. A voice in my head told me to relax. *Just enjoy the ride*.

We were about a quarter of the way up when I heard the first sound - a clanging noise of metal hitting metal. I couldn’t tell where it had come from, but I knew it was close and I didn’t like it. Then there was Lucas’s voice:

‘Dad…what was that?’

Through the gap in the headrest, I saw him look down at the bottom of his seat. I could only see half his face, his brown hair hanging over his cheek, but I could tell he’d gone completely white.

‘Dad?’

‘What’s wrong?’ I shouted, but somehow I already knew. Another metal clang. That was number two. 

‘Something’s…Something’s falling on the floor.’

*I don’t want to write this.*

There was this unspeakable fear in his voice. I can hear it now.

‘Daddy…help!’

The third clang. Then Lucas’s chair began to rattle. We were almost at the top. I think I said ‘it will be OK.’ A final stupid lie I told my son and then we went over.

You’ll have to imagine the rest. I can’t do it. Besides, you could always read the official report, if you’re so inclined. According to investigators, seat 7A - Lucas’s seat - was ejected from the train due to ‘insufficient component bonding’ i.e the nuts and bolts fell off…Three shiny purple nuts and three shiny purple bolts fell off. Make of that what you will. God knows I have.

A year or two later, Stampede was demolished.

In truth, I can’t remember too much after the drop. They say one’s brain shifts making-happy-memories down the priority list when you’re in a trauma situation. I do remember flashes though: coming into the station, an awful sound of whaling coming from people I didn’t know, clawing at my restraint, screaming at David to stay with Billy, running out of the station in some dumb attempt to find Lucas and maybe make him whole.

I might also struggle to remember because that day happened over eight years ago now. My brother and I have drifted further apart, but my marriage has clung on. We avoided the *death-of-a-child* equals divorce cliche, but when Billy leaves for college and the house is quieter, we’ll probably succumb to it. He’s become a fine, young man, by the way. There was a year or two of nightmares, some therapy, but it hasn’t defined him. His life is full of new things, new friends, new distractions, things that can’t help but push the old into a corner. When I ask him if he thinks of Lucas he says ‘all the time’, but I think he’s lying to make me feel better. I’m not angry at him, I envy him. His brother is going one way in his life, receding into the past, further and further, while he’s moving into a bright, big future.

I think of him though. Not every day, but most, and when I do the thought is accompanied with the same pathetic question: *did I cause it?* Over the years I’ve reached ninety-percent for ‘no’, that it was just a horrendous coincidence, not cosmic revenge. But ten-percent stubbornly remains and it’s connected to one memory from that day that refuses to fade away in time, a detail my therapist would love for me to rationalize and just let go: I’m running out of the station, past the Ride Photo booth, my eyes flick to the screens, and in the space where Lucas and his chair were meant to be, right beside my terrorized Billy, a face looks right at me. Philip's face. He smiles. I suspect I’ll still remember that smile when I’m an old man and I don’t remember much of anything else.

Evidently, some things just can’t be forgiven.
