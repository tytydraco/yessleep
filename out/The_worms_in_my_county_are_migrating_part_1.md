Sorry for the repost, everyone. I just realized there's so much more I want to get across after what happened today. When I made my original post yesterday, April wasn't planning on coming back until the week was over, but surprise, surprise, she paid the unnecessary cab fare, and now we are here.



The worms in my county are migrating—that’s the text that started this investigation. February had been at its rainiest when I first started to notice it. For added context, I moved to the county of Cheshire, specifically the city of Chester, two years ago when I graduated. Computer science jobs are hard to come by, so when the university offered a bit above minimum wage, I bit the bullet, said goodbye to my mom, and came here. Two years later, I work 9-5, play zombies, and take orders from my cats. On one of these monotone days, I woke up in a cold sweat late into the witching hour, unable to go to sleep, the pitter-patter blasts of rain keeping me conscious.



I tossed and turned for a few hours. I was used to it from a pretty young age—I never had the best knack for sleeping easy. Ever since the water lines were being worked on, every night had been more or less the same: being woken up by wind and rain or the morning construction. I looked out the window next to my bed as the moonlight lit the streaks of water squirting in slithering patterns. It was mesmerizing. The streaks and waves managed to make so many colors as the moonlight shone through them. My cat, Betsy, slowly purred next to me in her sleep, encapsulated by the warmth of the bed. I wanted a cigarette.



Slowly shimmying Betsy off my palm, I grabbed my supplies and made my way down to my garden. The parasol stood erect there, keeping the small table and ashtray dry in the heavy shower. As I stood out and lit my cigarette, my eyes found their way to the moonlit visuals of nightfall again. The rain around the parasol fell like icicles, keeping me encircled. The fences and the garden were surrounded by the same old swirls and curves from my window. The water rolled and streaked over the fence like a snake slithering down to the ground. I was mesmerized, following these trails as if my eyes could do nothing but follow them. As the cigarette reached its conclusion, I followed the streaks to their ultimate end. When it hit the ground, I noticed the patterns were replicated there, though the moonlight wasn’t as visible now. The rain pattered hard on the ground as the swirls swirled on the floor.



With the cigarette finished, I threw it, aiming at one of the swirls. As it hit one, I noticed something strange. The streak of water I had been noticing on the ground squirmed and writhed. Then it hit me—how could there be streaks and swirls on the ground? Moonlight was now barely present; the only illumination I had was from the kitchen window. A garden in an area like mine in the UK isn’t like a traditional garden. We have stone floors with grass growing from the crevices. I turned on my phone flashlight and pointed it at my cigarette butt. It was a worm. Not just one, but so many worms. They encircled me in a sense, not daring to enter the bounds of the parasol. They weren’t just writhing; they had a sense of unity to them. As they writhed, I started to distinguish the sounds of the rain. It wasn’t just pitter-patter; there was an ungodly sloshing going on faintly. With the sequential sloshing came the unity of movement. This movement looked like a march of nature—squirming, writhing, and moving toward the storm drain.



When I woke up, I didn’t know what to think. 



Was it extraordinary, or was it just a normal thing? 



Maybe they wanted to get out of the rain. Maybe it was a migration habit—that’s the excuse I gave when I described it to April. It was the first time I noticed it, so I gave it no mind. Now knowing what I know I should have, things would have gone differently then.



I’ll keep it at this, me and April are going to the old drain now so I’ll explain later.
