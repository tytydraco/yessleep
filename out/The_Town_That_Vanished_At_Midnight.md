I don’t even know why I’m writing this. Maybe I just need someone to believe me. Maybe I need to get it out of my head before it eats me alive.

There’s a town that shouldn’t exist. It’s not on any map, no records, nothing just a name whispered between truckers and late-night travelers. Black Hollow.

No one plans to go there. It just shows up.

If you’re ever driving down Route 29 past midnight, you might see a road that wasn’t there before. A cracked asphalt path winding into the fog, with an old wooden sign barely holding on. The letters are faded, peeling. But if you look close enough, you’ll see it.

Welcome to Black Hollow.

I made the mistake of taking that road.

I was driving through the backroads, running low on gas, GPS acting up. It was one of those nights where the world feels empty, where you go too long without seeing another pair of headlights, and it starts messing with your head.

Then I saw it.

The turnoff.

A gas station’s neon glow barely visible through the fog. I figured, why not? Fill up the tank, grab a coffee, keep moving.

But as soon as I turned onto that road, something felt… off. The air got thick, like it was pressing down on me. The fog swallowed my car whole, my headlights barely cutting through. My radio crackled, then died.

Then my phone screen glitched out.

That should’ve been my first warning.

The town looked frozen in time—rows of old houses, a diner, a gas station. But no streetlights. No sound. Just stillness.

Yet, the gas station lights were on.

I pulled in, relieved, but the place was empty. No attendant, no cars, no sound. The pumps were ancient, the kind with rolling numbers instead of a screen.

And then I heard it.

A whisper. Right behind me.

I spun around, heart hammering. Nothing. Just my own shadow stretching too long under the flickering station light.

I hurried inside. The bell above the door jingled, but the store was empty. Shelves were stocked, but covered in dust. It was like everything had been waiting for someone to show up.

And then I saw the newspaper on the counter.

"BLACK HOLLOW MISSING AGAIN. TOWN DISAPPEARS FOR 30TH YEAR IN A ROW."

The date? Exactly one year ago.

My stomach dropped. I turned to run.....

And that’s when I saw them.

Figures. Standing outside. Watching me. Their faces weren’t right—blurry, like looking at a reflection in broken glass.

My pulse pounded in my ears. The store lights flickered, and for a split second, I saw their faces clearly.

They weren’t strangers.

They were people I’d seen before. On missing posters. On the news. Faces of people who had vanished.

And then.....

The lights went out.

I don’t remember running to my car, but I must have. My tires screeched as I tore down that road, the town stretching on like it didn’t want to let me go. The fog thickened, twisting like it was alive.

And then I saw the sign again. But this time, the words had changed.

“WELCOME TO BLACK HOLLOW. YOU CAN CHECK IN, BUT YOU CAN’T CHECK OUT.”

Then—blackness.

I woke up on the side of Route 29. My car was parked neatly on the shoulder, gas tank full. My phone worked again. The time on the dash? 12:30 AM.

Like nothing had happened.

But when I got home, I checked the missing persons reports.

And there, in the latest update…..

My face.

It had only been a few hours since I left that town. But the report said I had been missing for a year.

I don’t know how much time I lost in that place. But I know one thing for sure.

Black Hollow is real.

And it’s still out there, waiting.

I should have never turned down that road.

So if you’re ever driving on Route 29 past midnight…..

Keep going.

Because if you see the turnoff, it means Black Hollow has already chosen you.
