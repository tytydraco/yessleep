I didn’t sleep that night. How could I? My face was on a missing persons list. A year gone. Just like that. The moment I got home, I locked every door and turned on every light in my apartment, but no matter how bright the room was, it didn’t help. The feeling was still there, that creeping, gnawing sense of being watched. Like I never really left.

At exactly 12:30 AM, my phone buzzed.

UNKNOWN CALLER.

I stared at the screen, my pulse hammering in my ears. I wasn’t answering that. No way. But as soon as the call ended, another notification popped up.

One New Photo Saved to Gallery.

My blood ran cold as I opened it. It was a picture of me. Standing in front of the gas station. But I never took that picture.

And worse, there was someone standing right behind me.

Tall. Blurred. Wrong.

A cold wave crawled down my spine. My mouth felt dry. I told myself it was a prank, but deep down, I knew better. My hands shook as I set the phone down.

Then I noticed the silence.

I live in the city. There’s always noise of cars, sirens, distant chatter. But now? Nothing. Not even the hum of the fridge. Not the ticking clock above my desk. Just emptiness.

Then the lights flickered.

And the air changed.

Thick. Heavy. The same dense, choking air from Route 29.

I turned toward my door....

And my stomach dropped.

The wood looked old now. Warped, cracked. The handle, rusted. Like it had been there for years.

And carved into the surface, deep and jagged, were the words I never wanted to see again.

WELCOME TO BLACK HOLLOW. YOU CAN CHECK IN, BUT YOU CAN’T CHECK OUT.

My chest tightened. I took a step back.

Then, KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.

Slow. Deliberate.

I shook my head. No. No, I left this place. I escaped.

KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.

Louder now. More forceful.

Then, my phone buzzed again.

LIVE VIDEO - NOW STREAMING.

I didn’t open it. I couldn’t.

But then, the video opened on its own.

The screen flickered. A dark, grainy feed appeared. The camera was pointed at my apartment door.

The very same door standing right in front of me.

But I wasn’t holding my phone anymore.

My breath hitched. In the video....

The door was already open.

A shadow stood in the hallway. Still. Waiting.

Then movement.

The figure tilted its head.

And then, in real life....

My doorknob turned.

I staggered back, a strangled noise escaping my throat. I squeezed my eyes shut, muttering that this wasn’t real, that I was just imagining things.

But when I opened them, I wasn’t in my apartment anymore.

The walls were different. The air smelled stale, like dust and rot. The lights above me flickered dimly, their bulbs swaying as if disturbed by something unseen.

I turned to my hallway mirror.

And I saw it.

At first, my reflection looked normal. Same clothes. Same terrified expression.

Then it grinned.

Not a normal grin. It stretched too wide, teeth too sharp. Its eyes black and empty.

And then, it moved.

Not in sync with me. Not like a reflection should. It took a step forward. Closer.

"You never left."

The lights went out.

And this time....

I knew I wasn’t waking up in my apartment again.
