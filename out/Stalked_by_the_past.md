 It has been two years since my ex, Sophia, and I broke up. I am now in a happy relationship with my current girlfriend, Lily. Things are going great, or so I thought until Sophia's recent behavior made me realize that she is not over me yet.

At first, her attempts to contact me were harmless, but as time went on, her behavior became more concerning. She started leaving notes on my car and showing up at my workplace.

One day, I came home to find something was off. The house was too quiet, and there was no sound of Max's barks. It was strange because Max would usually greet me at the door. I searched the house, calling out his name, but there was no response.

As I walked into the living room, I saw something that made me sick to my stomach. There was blood smeared all over the walls, and the lifeless body of my beloved pet dog, Max, lay on the floor. I knew in my heart that Sophia was responsible for his death.

Days after Max's death, my pet bird Kiwi went missing. I searched for her everywhere, but she was nowhere to be found. I could not bear the thought of losing another pet, but I knew deep down that Sophia was responsible for her disappearance.

Her behavior is becoming more erratic, and I am afraid for my life. I feel like she is obsessed with me and is trying to hurt me in any way possible. She is always watching, and I am never truly alone.

One night, I am home alone, and I hear a noise outside. I look out the window, and I see Sophia standing there, watching me. I feel my heart racing, and I know that I have to do something to protect myself.

I run towards the door to lock it, but I realize that I have left it open. I quickly shut it and look around the room for something to defend myself. The only thing I can find is a kitchen knife, so I grab it and stand near the door, waiting for Sophia to make her move.

I can hear her footsteps getting closer, and I feel like my heart is about to burst out of my chest. Suddenly, the doorknob starts to turn, and I see Sophia's face through the crack in the door.

I scream at her to leave, but she just stares back at me with a crazed look in her eyes. I hear her hand hit the door, and I know that she is trying to force her way in.

I can feel the adrenaline pumping through my veins as I try to push the door closed with all my might. I know that I have to protect myself and Lily at all costs.

Finally, Sophia gives up, and I hear her footsteps retreating from my apartment. I am shaking with fear, and I know that I cannot stay in this apartment any longer.

I never found out what happened to Sophia after that night. I never heard from her again, but I always feel like I am being watched. Every time I see someone who looks like her, my heart races, and I feel a sense of panic.

Lily and I are going to have to move to another apartment, but I know I'll still feel uneasy. I have changed the locks and installed a security system, but I still feel like I am not safe. I know that Sophia is still out there somewhere, and I am always on the lookout.
