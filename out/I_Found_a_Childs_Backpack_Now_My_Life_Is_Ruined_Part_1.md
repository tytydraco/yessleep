I'm here because I don't know where else to turn. I've tried every supposedly responsible authority. I've scoured the darkest recesses of the internet. No one and nothing has helped. My life has been so comprehensively destroyed, I'm not sure what anyone can do. These posts are my final attempt to find some answers before...I'm not sure. I've lost the will to live, but, after what I've experienced, I'm more terrified of death than ever.

I can't stay in one place for long, so it will take me some time to tell you everything that's happened. I'll post as often as I can. I hope I can make it to the end.

My wife died three years ago this October. I'd taken the anniversary off work to eat the dumbest foods and wallow in self-pity. Our dog - really *her* dog, a Schnauzer she named "Saskia" for reasons unknown - woke me far too early. I remember standing at the bathroom mirror, wanting to put my face through it. Doing anything that morning besides hiding from humanity felt like staring into the sun. But Sas needed her thousand-mile morning walk or she'd be an adorably furry terrorist for the rest of the day. After mainlining ice cream for breakfast, I slipped Sas into the hideous electric blue collar my wife bought her for her seventh birthday and set out on the walk I'll regret for the rest of my life.

Of course, I had to deviate from our normal route. Of course, I had to visit her roadside memorial. I placed flowers at the base of the tunnel wall where her SUV had slammed on the way to the OB/GYN. The concrete still bore scars from the impact and the fire that followed. As I traced my fingers along the deepest gouges, I tried not to think about any of it: whether my decision to skip the appointment for a non-essential work presentation was some kind of subconscious premonition, how long she might have been conscious after the tire blew, whether the last scent she registered was her own roasting flesh.

I continued to fight these thoughts to the death as Sas and I started down the trail by the tunnel. It's a mostly paved, mostly tree-lined path running along some creeks and behind some of the newer neighborhoods up-county from our apartment. About a mile in, there's a wide-open clearing at the top of a hill looking out over a tract of McMansions. Despite the houses littering an otherwise pleasant panorama, it's a worthwhile detour from the main path. We didn't walk Sas up that way much, but when we did, my wife always insisted on walking through this clearing. So that's what I did. That decision, more than any other, is the reason I'm writing these words right now.

I remember it was early enough that the sun was all light and no heat. The grass in the clearing was still lush and green, except for the trodden line marking the most common walking path. The last mow of the year had already come and gone, so things were a bit shaggy, but the clearing was close to the state it would remain in until spring. As usual, there were seemingly random patches of tall grass throughout. I remember wheat grass swaying in the breeze. How much I'd wished my wife were there with me. I remember the heat of the tears and sting of the slap I administered to my own cheek to keep them from running down my face.

Sas noticed it first: a dark shape beyond a tall patch just off the path. She pulled so suddenly, so insistently that I almost fell. When a gust of wind cleared some fallen leaves away, I saw what had caught her attention. A backpack. Small and nondescript. It looked dated but not vintage, though it's not like I have my finger on the pulse of backpack design trends. No superhero logos or bright colors, but something about its vibe read as "child's." That's when the first pang of anxious queasiness hit. That feeling has since become my baseline state.

Sas sniffed the bag intently. I wondered if it had food inside. I also wondered, without really wanting an answer, why a child's backpack had been abandoned in this clearing. It was a bit dirty but otherwise in decent condition, not soiled or saturated from exposure. Lost or discarded recently, but not that morning. I told myself whoever owned it might still come back. I should have left it there, but I've always been one to shoulder other people's burdens to distract from the weight of my own.

I picked up the backpack. Light as a feather. Something crinkled inside as I turned it over. I'd figured some loose paper. At the top, between the shoulder straps, was a transparent pocket with a yellowed address card inside. The card had fields for "Name," "Address," and "Phone Number," but they'd been filled out in green crayon with zero regard for size or location. All handwriting looks childlike in crayon, but the chaotic letters and numbers suggested a hand becoming acquainted with its capacities. No name or phone number, just an address: "15707 Lemorne Way." No city or state, but I figured it had to be nearby. If my phone showed it was within reasonable walking distance, I'd drop it off on their porch or in their lobby, whatever.

"Did you mean 15709 Lemorne Way?" the app asked. I wasn't sure *what* I meant. Kids mess up their own addresses all the time, but I presumed they usually get the street right. The suggested address was close by, not far off our intended route. Maybe fifteen minutes extra. Sas would appreciate the longer walk. We set off to reunite the backpack with whoever had left it behind. At least, that was the idea.

I felt strange wearing the backpack on my shoulder, so I carried it like a lunch pail. I'm not sure why, but that stretch between the clearing and the destination felt interminable. Nothing happened, but my joints felt coated in rust. Like walking against an intangible gale. If Sas hadn't been pulling me forward, I might have just dropped the bag in the woods and moved on with my life.

The path led to the terminus of a neighborhood street. Modest single-family homes stretched out in either direction. Not exactly ritzy, but the oppressive uniformity screamed HOA. Even with GPS, navigating the labyrinthine layout was a nightmare. After several wrong turns and dead ends, I finally found Lamorne Way.

It was a short connecting street with a grassy island hosting a half-hearted playground. Only three houses on either side, more generously spaced than the others. First came 15701 Lamorne, a soft-yellow rancher guarded by a battalion of garden gnomes. A boat of a '90s Crown Vic sat beached in the driveway. Then 15705, a taupe colonial sliding into neglect: overgrown lawn, weed-choked beds, newspapers moldering in the drive. Finally, 15709. A white craftsman, already sporting Halloween decorations. No 15707. Only the craftsman looked like it might house children. I looked at Sas, said "Here goes nothin'," and left the backpack on the porch.

As I walked away, an angry voice called out from behind. "What are you doing?"

I turned to see a tense woman standing in the open doorway. She glared at us, finger pointing down at the backpack. "What is this? Who are you?"

I sheepishly walked back and told her the short version of how I'd ended up on her doorstep. Her face cycled through every possible scowl as I stumbled over my words, liberally sprinkling "ums" and "uhs" throughout. "Look," she said, "I don't know whose bag this is, or why you'd think it would be mine, but I live here with my elderly mother. There are no school-aged kids on this street. You should just take this to the cops or the elementary school principal's office and be on your way." She shut the door in my face.

I was incredulous. Surely this bag wasn't just my problem now. We walked over to the island so Sas could pee by the playground equipment of her choice. I sat on the curb with the bag in my lap, considering my next move. I was ready to dump it in the nearest trash can, but felt a nagging obligation to try once more. It struck me I hadn't looked inside. I'd instinctively refrained from rifling through a child's backpack, but maybe something within would identify the owner.

The first two compartments were empty, save for some crumbs. The third and largest held a folded sheet of worn white construction paper. I unfolded it to reveal a drawing. My jaw dropped.

The picture showed the exact scene in front of me, rendered in crayon with childish precision: a yellow one-story with dancing gnomes, a tan two-story, and a white house with a porch. The houses even bore their street numbers in the same chaotic green crayon from the address card. But there were differences. Small ones first: the houses were drawn closer together, and the yellow house was labeled 15703 instead of 15701.

Then the difference that made my stomach drop: between 15705 and 15709, the drawing showed a fourth house with a red-shirted figure looking out a window. A light green rambler with pink flowers in front. Number 15707.

Sas suddenly went ballistic, scaring the tar out of me. She has the body of a Schnauzer but the bark of a Mastiff. I jumped up and turned to find a youngish couple holding hands, walking the world’s most timid German Shepherd in a green collar. I apologized for Sas’s outburst.

"Everything ok?" asked the tall, brown-haired man holding the Shepherd. He glanced at his husband, blonde, shorter, as if prompting him to speak. He didn’t. I picked up Sas to calm her, then ran through the same spiel I’d given Ms. 15709, with a bit more finesse this time. I showed them the drawing.

“Um. We’ve only lived here a few years, but I mean, obviously, there are only three houses there. The yellow one is like this eccentric silver-haired cowgirl, the brownish one I think is empty, and the white one is some ancient lady and her Nurse Ratched daughter.” I told them I’d met Nurse Ratched. “To be honest,” said the man holding the dog, “I don’t think I’ve ever even seen a kid use this playground. I’ve seen drunk teens use it, but no young kids.”

His husband finally chimed in. "My sister's friend works the front desk at the police station. If you want to give me the bag, I'll give it to her next chance I get." Relief seeped into every wrinkle of my brain. I agreed and thanked them profusely. They seemed bemused by the intensity of my gratitude. "Do you want us to give them your phone number in case they..." I cut him off, declining the offer and handing over the backpack. We exchanged some rote valedictions, they left, and my life felt like mine again. For a bit.

I got home and had the day I’d intended to have. Pizza rolls and ice cream with a side of the trashiest shows I could stream. My wife and I used to spend every weekend like this until the day she surprised me with a plus sign on a Clearblue Easy. Weekends then became about farmers' markets, yoga, and apartment hunting. For seven months anyway.

Day turned to night turned to day again. After a week or so, I didn’t think about the backpack much. After two weeks, I’m not sure I thought about it at all. I carried on with my easy, comfortable, lonely, gray existence. I worked, I picked up Sas from doggy daycare, we walked, we played, we missed mama, we slept. It wasn’t exactly good, but it was fine.

On an unseasonably cold November night weeks later, Sas and I were in bed watching TV. Out of nowhere, I felt a lightning strike of queasiness. At first, I worried I’d eaten something off, but then it dawned on me: I was having the same anxious queasiness I’d felt when I first laid eyes on the backpack. That brought it all back. The clearing, the drawing, the missing house. I pushed the thoughts away and turned up the TV. It didn’t work. I shut everything down, hoping to sleep it off. That’s when Sas started growling.

Her growl revved up. Faster, higher. She shifted her weight back on her hind legs, ready to pounce. I asked her what she’d heard, as if she’d answer. Petting her didn’t help either of us. I felt her hackles raised, her musculature pure brick. My stomach filled with hot, acid-tipped blades. The room was suffocating, evacuated of oxygen. The windows were as black as the door. I’d never leave this room. I was entombed in an endless abyss. Sas sprang off the bed and darted toward the door. She was less than a foot from the void when she dropped to the floor, shaking violently. I ran to her and tried to scoop her convulsing body into my arms. I couldn’t get a grip. Her mouth released dollops of blood-streaked foam. Her bladder and bowels followed suit. I held her tight, letting her soil my pajamas. I screamed my wife’s name.

And then the sun. I felt it greet the back of my neck. I opened my eyes to find myself no longer screaming, lying next to Sas on the softly lit floor. She slept soundly on the soiled carpet, her chest delicately rising and falling with each breath. I inspected myself. I wasn't sure which stains were from Sas and which were mine, but the pajamas were definitely trash. I looked back at the windows. Outside existed again. Everything looked normal. I was heartbroken that Sas had had a seizure, but relieved that whatever hallucinatory panic attack had gripped us both was over. I didn't know how I'd gone from screaming to sleeping, but I didn't care to reflect on it.

I slowly picked myself up, trying not to wake Sas. I thought I'd shower, change, bathe Sas, and take her to the vet. I had just taken my first step toward that version of the morning when I saw the backpack sitting outside the bedroom door. I slammed the door shut, startling Sas. She darted to me and pressed herself against my leg. I picked her up and frantically searched for my phone. It lay dead on the floor, unplugged from the charger. I reconnected it, shouting in a voice an octave higher than normal that I'd just called the cops, and whoever was out there better leave.

I don't know how long it typically takes for a dead phone to turn on after connecting to power, but mine took all of eternity that morning. I held Sas as we waited for it to come to life. My heart was a rapid succession of controlled detonations. Over the bursts, I registered nothing but silence. No voices, no movement. All was still except my heart.

The phone remained stubbornly blank. Sas squirmed free and went back to the door. She jumped up, paws against it, and whined. She needed to go out. I wanted out, too. I wanted to find the farthest place on the globe from my bedroom and go there immediately. Sas jumped at the door again. I remembered I had a putter buried somewhere in the closet. I threw out everything I'd lazily tossed on the closet floor over the last few months. Found the putter hiding under a suit that had gotten too tight fifteen pounds ago. I raised it like a katana and joined Sas at the door. I threw it open, ready to brain anyone lying in wait. No one. Just the bag.

Once I was satisfied no one else was in the apartment, I grabbed my finally functional phone to report the break-in to the cops. Except it wasn't a break-in. The door was locked and chained. No shattered windows. The dispatcher said someone would be by to talk. Because I said I wasn't in immediate danger, it would take them almost five hours.

In the interim, I tried to ignore the bag. I hated it. I didn't want it in my home, but didn't want to touch it either. If I could have, I would've torched it with a flamethrower. Instead, I quarantined it with Sas's collapsible playpen. Sas was able to let it be; I felt it leering. It wanted something. It wanted to be opened. I struggled against answering its call. I chided myself for even considering it. That lasted about forty-five minutes.

After my resolve crumbled, I walked over and poked the bag with the putter to make sure it was...I don't know, still inanimate? It didn't suddenly sprout wings and fangs and fly up to tear my throat out. I opened the little door to the pen and unzipped the bag. Just like that day six weeks earlier, it held a lone piece of folded construction paper. I took a breath and berated myself again. Then I unfolded it, as I always was going to.

This drawing was different. Instead of four houses, there were three figures. They stood in a grassy patch next to what appeared to be the playground on Lamorne Way. Beneath them, in the familiar handwriting: "Mamma," "daD," and "CharLie." Mom had squiggles of red for hair. Dad had a brown scribbled beard. Charlie was drawn much smaller with yellow hair and a red shirt, set back from his parents. The backpack clearly belonged to this Charlie, or someone wanted me to think so. Strangely, unlike the parents who were drawn with smiles, Charlie's mouth was a straight line. Also, unlike the parents, his right arm was raised toward the top right corner of the paper. That corner was filled in with deep black. The crayon had gone over itself so many times, the paper looked waxy. As the black mass widened from the corner, it gave way to black strands reaching halfway to Charlie.

When the police finally arrived, I'd returned the drawing to the bag. We sat in the living room as I walked the two officers through the story of the backpack...though with some calculated omissions to enhance believability. They fixated on the couple I'd left the bag with six weeks earlier. I didn't know their names or where they lived aside from somewhere in the Lamorne Way neighborhood. I didn't know the name of their friend who worked for the police. I could only describe them and their dog.

One of the officers volunteered that perhaps the couple had decided to play some kind of very mean, very illegal prank on me by leaving the bag in my apartment. I dismissed the suggestion. I hadn't even told them my name, let alone where I lived. She suggested they could have followed me, or perhaps another person I'd told the story to had found a similar backpack and used it to scare me. The couple following me seemed possible but unlikely. I hadn't told anyone else about the backpack.

They said they'd request security footage from the landlord and check the police station's lost and found logs to see if the bag was brought there. They recommended changing my locks and installing a security system. I would end up doing both. For nothing.

The moment the officers departed with the bag, my apartment felt two thousand square feet larger. The air was rich with oxygen. Sas and I played, I fed her dinner, and eventually we found ourselves back in bed. I didn't feel sick, the door and windows didn't turn to colorless voids, but I knew immediately upon climbing under the covers that I wouldn't be able to sleep in that room. Maybe ever. I checked Sas and myself into a pet-friendly hotel about twenty minutes away. We stayed there for a week. I still didn't sleep much, but the distance helped my anxiety. Eventually, the fear of my credit card's interest rate outstripped the fear of my apartment, so Sas and I went back to the building, rested but wary.

I wasn't two steps into the lobby when I heard a familiar voice. "That's him. Hey, you. Hey." I looked over to one of the seating areas to see the couple from Lamorne Way approaching with an aggressive gait. The man who had been holding the leash that day pointed at me.

"Stay right there, psycho." His husband, though also staring daggers, grabbed his arm to slow things down. He wasn't having it. "Get off, babe, I got this."

In a few strides, they were in my face. I noticed the angrier husband held a stack of folded papers in his hand. Construction paper.

"Look, I don't know what kind of weirdo stalker nonsense you're trying to pull here, but we know..." He held up and shook the papers. "We *know* this was you." He threw the papers at my chest. They bounced off and exploded into a dozen or so individual sheets before hitting the floor. Sas barked ferociously. "Get that dog under control or so help me..."

I protested that I didn't know what they were talking about. I pointedly told them the police thought *they* were potentially stalking me and accused them of lying about their intention to turn in the backpack. They both scoffed.

"Look, pal. We turned it in that afternoon. Then these papers started showing up all over our house. Drawings, just like the one you pulled out of that backpack." I looked down to see he wasn't kidding. Some of the folded papers lay open on the floor. Drawings. One was clearly another picture of the four houses on Lamorne Way. That's when it hit me: it was all them. They'd put the first drawing in the backpack. They'd left it for someone to find. They'd followed me after I found it. They'd been following me ever since. I said as much. Sas barked, adding an exclamation point to my accusation.

"You listen to me," the more aggressive husband said. "You can try to turn this around, but we know you're lying. *You* know you're lying. We dropped off the backpack. Then, after all the drawings appeared, our friend who works for the cops told us a guy called about a break-in involving a backpack. The guy says someone gave it to the cops already. She checked the lost and found and saw the bag was gone. We got your address from her." He pointed to the floor. "I don't know how you got it out of there, and I don't care." I started to say I didn't get it out, but he threw up a hand. "I'm going to make this real simple: he's a lawyer" - gesturing to the quieter spouse - "and I'm a social media director for a major marketing firm. If we find even one more of these drawings anywhere near our house again, we'll report you for stalking, and I will personally ruin your life. Your job, your apartment, and even your ugly dog will be gone. Do you understand me?"

I seethed. Who did these people think they were? I responded in kind about what would happen if I ever saw them anywhere near my apartment again. I'm not proud of all the things I said in that moment, but judging by the looks on their faces, I'd made the desired impression. They stormed out without another word. I picked up the scattered drawings and headed up to my apartment.

Once inside, I laid the drawings out on the kitchen table. There were fourteen. All but three appeared to be unremarkable childlike doodles.

First, the drawing I'd seen on the ground was essentially a replica of the original backpack drawing, with a few major differences. There were figures drawn in the foreground. Mamma and daD, again labeled, appeared to be working in the garden out front. Charlie looked out at them through a window, frowning, a cartoonishly large teardrop drawn beneath his eye. A black mass, like some combination of worm and cloud, stretched from one side of the picture to the window next to Charlie. It appeared to be moving into the house through the window. Looking closer, I could see black just creeping past the edge of Charlie's window.

Another drawing showed three figures, much like the playground drawing found in my apartment. Except where that one portrayed a happy family, these adult figures were drawn with cruel smiles and exaggerated, amorphous black eyes. The child figure, presumably Charlie, floated above them, ensnared in tendrils deployed by a black mass above. The third depicted the same scene, but Charlie's figure had vanished, and the adult figures, with the same smiles and eyes, lay atop a crayon's worth of maroon scribble.

I looked back at the other doodles and realized some of the figures were given names: "LuiS, "tiff," and "MiNg."

I grabbed my laptop and started researching. I wasn't sure how to begin. I tried "missing child Charlie." Turns out there are "Charlies" missing all over the place, but none anywhere near my zip code. I tried "Charlie Lamorne Way." Again, nothing useful. I kept trying and failing deep into the night. Then, sometime around 1 a.m., I tried "Luis, Ming, Missing Children, Drawings." I was about to move on to another search when, deep in the subreddit listings within the search results, I found "Why was r/NeverMissingChildren Nuked?" on r/OutOfTheLoop. The question, by HofmanisaurusRex88, was posted six years ago. In the body, the user further inquired, "Last I saw, someone had found more evidence of Ming." There was a smattering of responses, most seconding the question. One response read, "Leave it alone, bruv. Every flavor of antisocial/parasocial bollocks on that one." Then, about a year after the original post, was the final response in the thread, from TNMCArtifacts: 'tnmcartifactsxkp4id7oewzq6hk5yfpa3dcgh2jxnwqbz4vr5h3nugvqd.onion' (link now dead). The string looked like gibberish to me at first, but I soon discovered it was a dark web URL.

I'm not sure whether the events that followed my decision to continue into the digital darkness would have occurred anyway, but much like the choice to take the detour that led me to the backpack, I'd make a different one if I could.
