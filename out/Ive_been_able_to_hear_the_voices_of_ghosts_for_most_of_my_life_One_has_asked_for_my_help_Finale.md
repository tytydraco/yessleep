The musk was the first thing I sensed after I came to. The mildew and humid, heavy air that filled my mouth and lungs. The second thing were the handcuffs holding my wrists together in front of me.

Soon afterwards, I was jolted upright by the vicious barking of the dog gnashing its teeth at me. I slid quickly to the brick wall, putting myself as flat against it as possible.

The german shepherd yanked at its rusty chain leash to get to me. Pulling and pulling and pulling at the thick PVC pipe it was tied to. I begged for it not to break.

The snarls of the dog and the clanking of metal were not the only sounds, however. The basement was also filled with the bellowing and overlapping cries and calls of countless spirits. The voices of so many men and women whose ghostly forms were tied to this cold, stinking space. Every spirit that I had never heard in town was clearly trapped here.

“TRACER! SHUT UP!”

I heard the heavy footfalls of a single individual on the floor above me. The dog, Tracer, stopped his barking but kept his teeth bared. He licked his lips as I heard a door somewhere in the room open and descending footsteps creaking at old wooden stairs.

“Are you awake?” Haines asked, before he rounded the corner to see me.

We made eye contact and he grinned at me. The ghostly wails continued. They filled my brain with layers upon layers of crying and yelling. Constant barrages of sound so that I could hardly think.

“FUCKING SHUT UP!” I screamed with every ounce of ferocity my voice could manage, but the voices did not stop.

Haines began to laugh even as I said,

“Not you. The ghosts. The damn ghosts. Shut up, for the love of God.”

Haines continued his snickering, but the otherworldly sounds began to fade.

“You're losing it much faster than the others,” Haines taunted. “You’re already crazy.”

I managed to calm myself even as the spirits muttered amongst themselves. I closed my eyes and tilted my head up to the ceiling.

“You have to help me. The ghosts of this house, please, you have to help me.”

As I looked back down at the officer, his face filled with equal parts bemusement and disbelief.

“I think the fumes got to you, girlie.”

“I’m not crazy. You are the fucking crazy one.” 

I shook the cuffs at him to emphasize my point. Haines chuckled, rubbing his hairy paws together.

“What are you gonna do to me?”

The ghosts began to rile up slightly but listened to me when I again told them to be quiet.

“Wow. Gotta say this is the strangest kidnapping so far.”

He sat down on the floor across from me, petting the fur coat of his canine, killing companion. The dog never broke its gaze with me, nor did the bloodlust leave its eyes.

“When my babygirl gets back home, we’re gonna kill ya, doll. We’re gonna do it slow. You know. Have fun with it. Enjoy our date night.”

My eyes darted from the hairy beast and back to the german shepherd which gnashed at me once.

“Oh, yeah he’s gonna get a taste too. He likes the hunt whenever we go on the trails, but that’s a little riskier than just feeding him at home. He didn’t even get to finish last time before you stumbled across Alice’s body.”

“You were still there?”

Haines snorted. “Course we were. If you hadn’t darted out of there so quick, you probably woulda seen us standing in the tree line watching you.”

My stomach churned. I had been so close to death so many times without knowing it.

“Why did you wait so long to come after me?”

“We weren’t gonna. Don’t usually like to kill so fast after the last one, but… well you seemed kinda off in your interrogation. Seemed like you were holding back. Talked about it like a murder and we had to make sure you didn’t see us. My girl was sure you did, that’s why she dyed her hair.”

“I didn’t see you, though. I only saw red. Everywhere.”

“Then how’d you know?”

I mulled over my answer for a moment, but since he already thought I was crazy and since I had nothing to lose, I answered truthfully.

“Alice told me. I spoke to her ghost when it followed me down the mountain.”

“Oh, really? Is she here now?”

I heard a distinct *Yes* among the chatter of spirits.

“Yes.”

I won’t lie to you. When she said that I felt a little bit better.

“Then at least you’ve got company,” he said with a smile. He stood up and rounded the corner mumbling, “Schizo,” before ascending the steps.

The second the door closed behind Haines, the ghosts began to shout again.

“Stop. Please, Christ. Alice. Only let Alice talk right now.”

After the clammer faded I heard the faintest *hello...*

“Don’t worry, Alice. I’m not mad, okay. Just… just help me please. I helped you, you help me.”

*What can I do?*

I had to think for a moment. What could she do? What could any of them do?

“Go upstairs. Keep an eye out and give me a warning if you see anything.”

She agreed, leaving me in the basement surrounded by spirits and an angry hound. I placed my cuffed hands together to my forehead trying desperately to think.

**May I speak,** said a deep melodious voice from the ether. It was one that I hadn’t heard yet.

“Why not?”

**I was a police officer,** the voice continued. **I started catching on to what those two were up to, but I wasn’t able to stop them before… well. But forget that. I can help you out some. Do you have a bobby pin in your hair?**

The question snapped me to attention. I quickly ruffled through my messy hair to eventually find and pull out a single bobby pin.

**Perfect!**

“Yes!”

**Okay, listen close. Do you know how to use that to get out of those cuffs? Don’t worry, that's okay. Some drifter got out of mine once using this trick and I’ve learned how to do it. I need you to flatten out that pin.**

“Done.”

**Do you have some slack in the cuffs?**

“A little bit.”

**Awesome, now listen. I need you to slip that pin into the cuffs where the hinge piece inserts to the base. Shove it in there. Now squeeze them tighter. Let it click a few times.**

“It worked,” I said in disbelief as the cuff fell off completely. I quickly undid the other side.

Unfortunately, as I began to work, Tracer got the hint that something was wrong and his snarling increased. Just as the second cuff was off the snarling turned to barking.

“Tracer!” I heard from the top floor. “Tracer, shut up!”

The steps once again moved towards the door. Alice screamed at me that he was going straight for the basement.

“What do I do?”

**Into that room! Quick! You’ll find some weapons in there.**

I hurried into the only sectioned off room in the entire basement and locked the door. The scene on the other side was horrific. A blood stained wooden table was in the center. Five leather straps were located in spots that indicated one for each limb plus an extra for the neck.

Along the wall was a large rolling toolbox equally smeared in dry brown blotches. I rummaged through the drawers as quickly as I could. Haines screamed in the background and so too did the spirits.

Pounding and slamming and screams and wails. All order ceased. The voices overflowed once again. I grabbed a black metal hammer from the toolbox just as the burly man broke the door off its hinges with a final kick.

I swung but he leaned backwards to avoid it then lunged back in to grab me by the throat. He knocked the hammer from my grip. As it landed on the table’s edge, I landed hard on the concrete floor with a 200 pound police officer above me. Both hands clamped firmly on my windpipe.

I could not breath. I could not speak. All I could do was stare upwards and mouth to the spirits, help…me…

Black edges began to fade in from the corners of my eyes but on the edge of the table I saw the black hammer begin to move. 

I had never witnessed any spirit move objects before. I thought it was another myth. But perhaps because of the circumstance or perhaps because of the amount of them, the hammer moved. Only slightly at first. Only subtly but it grew in power until it fell to the ground.

It was a meaty smack. I had managed in my desperation to land the hammer’s blow directly at the officer’s temple. He fell to the side, clutching his head and giving me enough opportunity to wrestle myself from underneath him.

His left eye was bloodshot and his right one stared at nothing. He seemed to try and speak to me, possibly begging. But as his hand went up to try and stop me I unleashed a flurry of swings downwards onto him.

Again.

And again.

I cried as I did so, but didn’t dare stop until nothing was left but red. Red everywhere. Just like that day. Just like the visions.

I didn’t have time to pity myself, though. I heard my look out once again screaming at me through the voices and the furious barking.

*THE LADY IS HERE! GET OUT!*

The windows were barred and I found no door to the outside world. As the steps indicated that Trittle was directly above me, I ducked underneath the stairs. She opened the door and immediately ran towards the body.

I took my chance to bound up the stairs and lock the door behind me. I stole keys from the coffee table and rushed outside. I did not care that the car was a police vehicle, in fact I welcomed it.

I pulled away onto the road with siren blaring and lights flashing. I spoke frantically over the radio, begging for help. Eventually a swarm of police vehicles, sheriffs, and highway patrol stopped me while I sped down the highway.

They arrested Trittle. She won’t get the death penalty, it was abolished in Colorado in 2020. She will likely spend the rest of her life in prison. Although she’s trying to claim I murdered Haines in cold blood, the evidence is pretty stacked towards self defense. Especially, since they’ve started uncovering the bodies.

I went back to the house yesterday. From the outside, it looked completely normal and it was even in the same neighborhood as mine. It was quaint. It was quiet. Soft breezes swayed the branches of the evergreens in the yard.

**Peaceful now, isn’t it? They’ve all moved on.**

“I never got your name,” I said to the ghost of the man who saved my life.

**James Chisholm,** he said. **But thanks to you now everyone will know what happened to me. My wife and my little girl will know. That’s all I wanted. Thank you.**

The wind picked up and the branches swayed more. For a moment the sun broke through the clouds and let down a ray of light.

*And thank you from me too,* said a familiar voice.

I smiled. “I’m not good at goodbyes.”

*You don’t have to be.* 

Though I could not see her, I know that we spent a few minutes just admiring the nature. The same nature that had made us both avid hikers. That had, through unconventional means, brought us together.

*Can I ask you a question?*

“Of course,” I said.

*Where will I go? Now that I’m leaving for good.*

“To be honest, Alice, I don’t know. No one’s ever come back from the other side to tell me.”

*Well… wherever it is, I hope you get to go to the best version of it. After you’re done down here of course.*

I smiled again. She passed on just as the raindrops started to fall. I continued my drive out of the neighborhood and out of that little Colorado town. And after I passed the sign that said I was leaving, I looked into the sky and saw a rainbow.
