The first thing I recognized when I woke up was that it hurt, the thought smashing against my skull. Pain radiated up my arms from my fingers, across my chest, and down through my knees. Blinding sparks of agony whited out my vision, leaving me breathless, my mouth agape in a silent scream as my body seized. 

My flesh folded and caught on the ground I was lying face down on, my mangled skin scraping on rocks. I drew in a breath and choked, my lungs spasming as I was smothered. I couldn’t move—I couldn’t even turn my head to the side—or do anything but choke and sputter as waves of fire seared down my limbs and poured out from my stomach across the ground. And the ground—I remember it being so, so cold. It made my blood feel like it was burning me from the inside out and freezing the blood in my veins. It hurt so badly but I couldn’t scream. I couldn't make a noise. 

What unbroken fingers I had curled, shredded nails tearing into my palms. I could feel torn muscles begin to knit and bones snap back together. Their grating felt like tinnitus, the sound pounding behind my eyes and rattling my sensitive nerves.

I lied there gasping wetly into gravel for what could have been days or minutes, waiting for the pain to ebb away. Eventually, my vision faded from the fireworks of black and white. My breath caught violently as a rib snapped back into place sending me into a coughing fit, which caused the rest of my broken ribs to ache before they too began to mend, one by one. 

Weakly sputtering, I rolled more fully onto my front, ignoring the dragging, uncomfortable feeling it elicited. Sensations stretched out from my body, nerves tingling where they shouldn’t. Though, shifting around alleviated some of the ache in the shoulder I was half lying on and allowed me to breathe easier. Molten blood rushed back into my arm, licking my veins with fire and finally warming the limb. I gritted my teeth and rode out the stabbing pins and needles in my shaking fingers.

Gingerly, I peeled open my eyes. There was tension in my brow and jaw that pulsed with my pounding heart. Soft sunlight greeted me and I clenched my eyes back shut with a groan. After a moment, I peeked my eyes open. My outstretched arm was the first thing I saw. It was sprawled out straight from my side, cutting through my blurry vision. Beyond my twitching fingers sat a wall of green. The trees were gently swaying in the hint of breeze that I could feel brushing over my body. It was cold, almost icy against my wet clothes and tingling skin.

I cringed. Fuck, I thought, my clothes were absolutely soaked. They were heavy as shit and stuck to my skin. My teeth twinged and I forced myself to relax, to release the tightness in my jaw. The shifting of my mouth came with some stiffness and I frowned, licking my chapped lips—only to gag at the sharp tang of copper that coated my tongue. 

My arm shifted across gravel with my full-body shudder, drawing my attention as I fought to not throw up. My skin was painted red, as was the ground beneath my cheek. And it reeked, thick and metallic. I gagged again, retching nothing but bile. It thinly trickled into what must be a pool of blood.

I pushed myself up with shaking arms and sat back on my knees. Chunks of thickened blood fell from my skin and clothes in clumps, plopping wetly in the mess beneath me. The shift from lying to upright made my vision white out, my heaving breaths echoed loudly in my ears. The sensation of soreness was even more prevalent. It was an ache like nothing I’d ever felt before. I sat, trying to catch my breath, and took in the carnage I was kneeling in—because there’s no other word for it besides, maybe, a massacre. But I was entirely alone.

Blood pooled in a messy circle around me, congealing the thickest where I’d been splayed out. It clung to me, saturating my clothes, which—I grimaced—were nearly torn to shreds. My bare knees poked through the holes in my jeans and pressed uncomfortably into the uneven rocks. My shirt, I realized, glancing down towards my lap, was ripped. A tear ran diagonally along it from under my arm to my waist on the opposite side. The bottom half hung loosely at my side in a sticky lump.

The breeze that gently swept through the trees made another appearance, the melody of leaves brushing against each other barely audible. Though, now that I was upright, the wind felt much brisker against my heated skin. Especially against my stomach.

I ran my shaky hands across the tingly skin of my abdomen. It definitely felt different, more sensitive, I mused, as my fingers trailed white lines across red patchy skin. It reacted to the light pressure. My exploring turned into desperate attempts to wipe the blood off. Frustrated, I gave up. The blood wouldn’t come off. It only smeared. I can still smell it.

Another gust of wind bracketed through the clearing, frigid on my damp skin and matted hair that fell to hang limp in my face. I dropped my hands to the slick ground with a shiver. Groaning, I heaved myself onto my feet—my knees buckled. My breath shook when I nearly came crashing down. Frustration soured my gut as my legs wobbled like a newborn deer.  

Instead, I just swayed precariously, my stomach cramping tightly. I thought I was going to hurl from the feeling of my intestines or spleen or some other organ shifting and moving around—oh my god. I swallowed the rush of saliva that cut through the insistent bite of blood I’d been tasting since waking up.

There was a pinch of pain, but it was distant, overshadowed by a horrific, dragging realization. The pulling from my stomach when I’d rolled over—I didn’t want to look, but I knew. My eyes betrayed me, glancing down. Smears in the gore—lines cut through the mess of congealed blood at my feet—streaking away from where I’d been lying. Like ropes had been dragged through the blood starting some ten feet away and ending at the dark outline of my body. Like something had been torn out of me and then pulled back in. My stomach twisted violently. Oh god—oh god. I’m actually going to throw up now.

My breath was panicked when the tightness in my guts finally released, sending wave after wave of painful cramps through my sensitive abs. A meager amount of bile splashed onto the ground from where I’m folded over, hands on my knees. I gagged again; my mess is mixing with the dark red. My vision blurred with tears that didn't fall. What the fuck is happening?

I didn’t remember…much, then. I knew my name and, maybe, how old I was. But, anything beyond that, like why I was in some deserted forest or how I’d managed to bleed pints and pints of blood and remain—standing isn’t the right word, all things considered, but maybe alive? When I tried to push myself to remember more, all I was met with was a blinding pain in my temple and that’s that. Nothing. Anything beyond the blankness is guarded by agony. Frustration pooled in my empty stomach. There’s nothing, just the nagging feeling that I was forgetting something. It was on the tip of my tongue., like the thought should be there but my brain just couldn’t grasp it. 

Being fully honest, the memory issue was not the most pressing issue right then. At that moment, it sat at a solid second place, after the now-coagulated pool of my own blood I sat in. And, when I really looked, chunks of debris and viscera. My breath went a bit shaky because that’s definitely shards of bone mixed with some kind of grey, mushy bits.

\- - - - -

By the time I found a road cutting through the trees, the sun had long since set. I’d been trudging through the foliage and mud and cold for hours watching it dip further and further into the horizon. The temperature had dropped dramatically. Where it was cold but bearable with the steady warmth of the sun before, now the darkness left my teeth chattering and my breath very nearly visible. 

Though, my clothes have long since dried—stiff and cracking with every step. Flaking chunks of blood left a faint trail from, what I’d taken to calling, my Death Scene. Like a crime scene, but, you know, where I died. Or, where I was supposed to have died. I must have, at some point. There’s no way I didn’t bite it—there was so much blood, too much. 

I frowned, glaring at my bare toes flexing on the edge of the asphalt. The material was harsh on the scuffed soles of my feet and so different from the rocks and hard-packed dirt from before. I wiggled my fingers tucked under my arms in time with my heartbeat that pounded in my ears. My nose and extremities twinged, the cold bearing down with its numbness which helped with the residual ache steadily fading.

A distant humming cut through the near silence of the woods. It was followed by lights beaming out from the tree line. I perked up, focusing fully on the approaching car. My breath caught in my throat alongside my heart. Within a few moments, the car—truck—roared into view. I let out a rush of air and threw my hands into the air, waving them frantically. Please please pleasepleaseplease—

The truck’s high beams flashed once, the lights blinding me. I groaned and flinched to cover my face.

“Fuck—” I coughed, eyes burning. Blinking away the spots, I almost missed the sound of the truck passing. “Wait—wait! No!” The words ripped from my throat.

My stomach dropped. The truck kept going down the road.

Disbelief sank into my chest like hands clamping down on the back of my neck and shoulders, forcing my back to bow. It mixed seamlessly with the fear that’s been crawling up my back since I woke up. 

I stood there, breath sharp, head spinning. 

They didn’t stop. 

They actually left me.

The fear crested like a wave—sweeping up and over me, dragging me under the surface of the water.

It clamped around my chest in a crushing bind. 

I was dizzy. I couldn’t breathe. 

Because I was drowning. 

All I could hear were my useless gasps and the ringing in my ears, rattling my bones. 

I’m—oh fuck—

I’m going to die again. 

I was stuck in the middle of nowhere.

And I’m going to die and it’s going to hurt. It’s going to hurt so badly—like it did when I woke up.

Distantly, I felt my knees hit the gravel that lines the road. I could feel the sharp stones cutting through my skin.

But the darkness was folding in around me.

I’m going to die—

A car door shutting cut through the fog and the darkness jumped back. I was suddenly aware of my body again, my aching knees, my fingers knotted in my hair and pressing over my ears to stop the noise, and I drew in a full, shuddering breath. 

A hand landed on my shoulder and I froze, folded over my knees. There was a voice, but the words were muddled like I was hearing them from underwater. Right, I’m drowning—

“Boy.” My eyes flew open to the man crouched at my side. He just regarded me silently for a few beats as I tried to breathe through the wave. He sighed and stood, “Come on, up you go.” 

There was a hand in my face that I stared blankly at. The man cleared his throat, “On your feet, kid. Let’s go.” He reached down and grabbed me by my upper arm, hoisting me to my feet and ignoring the panicked gasp that forced its way out of my mouth. He didn’t let go, though, when I tried to take a step back. His fingers stayed locked around my arm as he led me down the road where the truck from before is parked idling off the side of the road.

He guided me to the passenger seat of his vehicle. I sat sideways, legs hanging out, toes brushing the gravel. He leaned against the open door, arms crossed—casual, but it caged me in.

Guilt clawed at my chest when I spotted the smears of copper along the front of his plaid button-down, so I tried to keep my eyes away from it. Instead, I found myself meeting his eyes—they were green. The kind of green that draws your attention through a crowd. He was already watching me. He didn’t say anything, he stood there and watched me.

He also didn’t mention the blood covering his chest or staining the hand he grabbed me with. Nor did he bring up how bad I must’ve looked. I don’t know what the original color of my shirt was—one of the memories I never recovered. The blood was stiff on my skin. It pulled. 

The man just waited.

The blood was peeling, pulling on my sensitive skin, and it hurt. But I sat silently, my eyes dropping to stare at my hands where they curled loosely in my lap, palms up. As the seconds ticked to minutes, my shoulders began to hunch forwards, and I gazed emptily at the staining in the lines of my hands. Dark brown—almost black—streaks were stark on the lighter skin of my palms, but they faded as they bled to the back of my hands where my skin tone better matched. 

From my peripheral, I saw the man’s arms, bare from the elbow down. His olive skin was pale and weathered with age, veins and sunspots visible through more translucent skin. Though, he didn’t look particularly old.

The rattling of the truck’s vents pushed warm air against my frigid skin, sending goose bumps up my arms. I relaxed a fraction as some of the ache in my fingers and toes started to fade. I’d forgotten how cold I was.

The truck’s internal clock clicked with each passing second, audible over the engine, and I could still feel the man’s eyes on me. My neck prickled. He regarded me with an intensity that I guess was warranted. I would be cautious too if I’d found some stranger on the side of the road and covered in blood. It wouldn’t really matter if it was just some kid.

When the clock ticked past the five-minute mark, the man spoke.

“Kid, listen, I’m not going to ask.” He ran a hand, the clean one, down his face. His voice had a gentle cadence and was distinctly Southern. His accent filled me with something warm and my attention faded into a foreign nostalgia enough that I almost missed what he said next, “—you—you know—” he paused, “Do you know where your parents are?”

Parents? The thought hadn’t even come to mind, not even once since I’d woken up.

I just stared blankly at him—well, over his shoulder. I didn’t want to meet his green eyes again. He sighed through his nose, “What’s your name, kid?”

My eyes flicked once over to him through my bangs. That I did know. It’s about all I knew, really. Then, I looked back down at my hands, tracing a nail through some blood that’d clumped between my index and middle fingers. After a long, vaguely uncomfortable moment, I realized that the man was still waiting for an answer. I combatted that by focusing harder on my hands, worrying the brown crust in my nail beds, probably pushing too hard.

A hand grabbed mine, startling a hoarse gasp from me. Surprised, I went to yank my wrist from his grasp, leaning back in the seat so that my spine pressed against the center console. The man’s grip didn’t falter in my struggle. It wasn’t hard, per say, nor was it violent. He wasn’t leaving finger-shaped bruises on my skin yet—yet?

Panic surged through me but I didn’t know why. It was like a primal force raging through me. I felt like a rat in a corner. 

I tried to tear my wrist away again. It did nothing. The man didn’t even look like it was a struggle to hold onto me. My breath sped up and my lungs hurt.

“Kid—” My anxious whine and the sound of my struggle cut him off, “kid, come on—”

I’m not listening. He needed to let go. But his hand was huge wrapped around my wrist, fingers easily encircling my thin limb.

“Calm down.” The man’s face hardened, “Miles. Enough.”

The world lurched and slowed to a sudden stop. I froze, my heart literally skipping a beat in my chest.

“What—” my voice wobbled, “how—how do you know my name?” I didn’t tell him. I know I didn’t. I don’t even know this guy! How does he know? “Let go of me!”

The man didn’t let go. Instead, he started pulling me closer. Something snapped—probably the tightly coiled restraint I had on my fear—and I catapulted myself backwards, wrenching my wrist out from the man’s grip and slamming the back of my head against the driver-side door. 

Hard.

My breath stuttered in my chest. The man lunged—grabbed me. He locked a hand around one of my ankles still draped over the center console and yanked me back halfway. My back bent awkwardly against the stick shift. 

I flailed with a cry, kicking out wildly like a wild animal. One foot hit the frame of the truck, jarring my ankle. The other made contact with the man’s face. Stilted pleas still spilling from my mouth, I rolled to my front, hands fumbling with the door handle.

The driver’s door flew open and I tumbled to the ground. From beneath the vehicle, I could see the man’s feet shifting to start around the front of the truck. The passenger door echoed loudly when it slammed shut.

A sob bubbled out before I could stop it. My arms buckled. I couldn’t push myself off the ground. My thighs were cramping and I was so tired. Grinding my forearms on the asphalt in some bastardized version of an army crawl, I half-shuffled, half-crawled away from the truck—away from the man as he rounded the hood.

“No, no, sir, please don’t—” My arms wouldn’t cooperate with me and my fingers scraped uselessly against loose gravel scattered across the blacktop.

Tears finally fell, freely cutting tracks through the filth coating my face, “Please—I’m sorry,” I cried; my voice broke with a hiccup.

The man stopped then. His heavy boots took up much of my vision from where I lay on the ground. He just stared down at me. His face was hidden with shadows, expression swallowed by darkness, as his figure was backlit by the truck’s headlights. Green eyes seemed to glow.

“Miles.” His voice was different and it left me cold, colder than the road did. Colder than waking up in my Death Scene. A shiver rolled down my spine. The cadence in his words was gone—different. He’d been faking his fucking accent the whole time. 

“What do you remember?” The question sent a pulse of pain from temple to neck like a pinched nerve. The block from before was back.

“I don’t—I don’t know…sir, please—”

“I need you to try.”

I heaved as more sobs racked my body, my breath short and shaky. I stared at his boots, anywhere but his eyes, trying to think, “I—nngh—I don’t know. It hurts. I—I remember waking up and—and that it hurt.”

“Do you remember the place you woke up in or why you were there?”

“No—no, I don’t.” The clearing, trees—it was all unfamiliar. I didn’t think I’d ever been in a forest, let alone that one. And I had no idea why someone would want me dead. The ache got worse. My eyes jumped to his and I found I couldn't look away. They locked me in place.

“Which part?”

I paused, trying to gather my thoughts through the haze of pain that grows the more I tried to think back. “Both?” 

The man just hummed, contemplating, his gaze holding mine like a vice.

“Tell me, Miles. Do you know who I am?”

The burning in the back of my head pulsed with a vengeance. It felt like my head was splitting. I distantly recognized that I was shaking my head, but I could barely see.

“Who am I, Miles?”

And then something was there. Something flickered in the emptiness of my memories. The first spark since I’d awoken to blood: “Misha.”

And he smiled. 

A horrific thing that stretched across his face. 

My face was damp. I couldn’t stop crying and I was so scared.

“Oh, so you do remember,” he drawled, squatting down to be more eye level with me. His green eyes catch the light—almost glowing again. They might actually be glowing. “What did I tell you the last time you tried to hide stuff from me?”

His hand lashed out, striking me hard on the cheek. I wailed, “Sir, wait—” he grabbed me by the hair, yanking my head up and back. I could hear strands of my hair crunch between his fingers. Instinctively, I threw up a hand to claw at his wrist, but it’s caught by his free hand.

My face burned. The back of my head burned. Everything burned.

“I—just your name…” I trailed off with a grimace, going limp in Misha’s hold.

“Just my name?” He’s being so mean, why?

“It hurts to think—to remember things from before. My head.” My eyes fell shut as I panted into the early morning air.

He dragged me up higher, his fingers tightening in my hair, ripping another cry out of me, “It’s always so fascinating. You’re conscious and aware without being completely revived,” he muses, almost excitedly. “What does a healing brain feel like? Can you feel the memories slotting back into place? I can imagine it is quite unpleasant while you’re awake.” Grey matter. Oh fuck—

I gritted my teeth when Misha gave one last tug on my hair before dropping me. I collapsed like a doll with its strings cut onto the ground, exhausted. My scalp tingled.

“I’d actually expected this to take a lot longer.” I didn’t bother responding. I just weakly shifted. He continued, “I’d gone back to check your progress, when, to my surprise, you weren’t there anymore. It was my luck that I saw you on the side of the road up there.” He gestured with a nod. “Had it gone like before, you should have still been recovering until tomorrow evening or the next at the latest. But here you are.” He reached out a hand that I didn’t flinch away from fast enough. His fingers brushed across my swollen cheek before cupping my face in my hand.

“I suppose I should introduce myself again,” he ruminated with a tone I couldn’t place. He pulled away his hand, dropping my head back onto the ground with a thud that rattled my mind. “My true name is Mshai. The people of this era call me Misha. You and I have been working together to explore your gift and learn how to utilize it.”

“I don’t know what that means.” My head hurt, the ache up my neck flaring up again. I was trying to remember things and it hurt.

“It means, Miles, that you can’t be killed.” Misha’s voice was calm, almost amused. He was enjoying this, explaining this to me. “Death doesn’t affect you the way it does everyone else.”

I swallowed my initial rebuttal because—it was true. I should have died in that clearing. 

“You’ve come back before,” he continued, ignoring my silence. “Again and again. You just don’t remember it right now.”

“This has happened before?”

“Of course,” as if it was obvious. “We are testing the limitations of your ability. I’ve never met someone as special as yourself. Sure, I’ve run into many with prolonged lives, yet death took them all the same. They couldn’t outrun the clock.

“People of the Halted, though.” His eyes flash with that look again. The tone I couldn’t place came to me—condescension. Patronizing. “I have met a scarce few of my own people. I remember a young girl from Chang’an. Her curse took life when she was just a child, freezing her in her pubescent body for centuries. She remained trapped in that body until her death in the Wenxi fire.”

There was a foreboding sensation building behind my eyes. The familiar-but-not feeling.

“You, I have met only one other like you.”

“Like me?” 

“A defier. A defiler. Unchained and unkillable. You age, yet you cannot die.” Misha shifted, reaching under his jacket to pull a long hunting knife from a sheath in his waistband. 

My eyes flew wide and I scrambled to pull myself away. 

He grabbed me by my shoulder, pushing me flat on my back.

“Wait—”

“No matter what is done to you—What I do to you.” The knife came up to press against the soft skin of my throat, stilling me in place. My pleas went silent and I could feel the drag of the blade when I swallowed. “You always come back to me.” The knife slid across my neck.

\- - - - -

I could feel the rumbling of the truck. It hummed something soothing, mixing with the fuzziness in my limbs. My eyelids were like lead when I peaked out through my lashes. Grey fabric worn with age rubs against my skin as I lie curled up across the backseat of a vehicle. 

My vision is too blurred to make out much beyond the seat, so I shut them with a groan.

“Two hours. Remarkable.” I flinched hard against the back of the seats. My eyes locked onto Misha’s rapidly clearing figure behind the wheel. I must have been louder than I’d thought, or he’d been listening for me to wake up.

I opened my mouth to respond but my throat burns viciously, like I’d gargled glass.

“I wouldn’t try speaking yet,” he tutted at me, like I was a child. “I severed your carotid artery and trachea.” 

My lip wobbled and I ran a hand across the undamaged skin of my throat, smearing fresher blood. No wound but it still hurt. 

“The last time we studied a cut-throat injury, it took you seven and a half hours to revive.”

I curled into myself, hugging my knees to my chest. Tears welled in my swollen eyes again and I choked down the sobs that threatened to spill out. I swallowed hard, “Why?” My voice warbled, raw and barely above a whisper. “What do you want?”

“Oh, kiddo.” The truck hit a bump, jostling me, “I’m not doing anything to you. We’re learning together.” I could hear the smile in his voice, as well as the fake twang that bled in when he tries to be nice. It just pissed me off. I held onto that anger, using it to smother the fear that has been suffocating me. I had only ever been afraid. I was tired and that anger was slowly kindling into something greater.

“We’ll be done once we figure out what allows you to come back and how to reproduce the results.”

Reproduce…?

“Sir, why—why are…” A flash of pain and buried memories shot down my spine. I trailed off. My thoughts were all over the place, I needed to focus. I squeezed my eyes shut. The ache in my head was back, like before. I found it sitting in the nerves at the base of my skull. Navigating through errant pings and phantom injuries, I could see the nerves in my mind's eye. With two metaphorical hands, I wrenched it forward. 

With a pop and a rush of agony followed quickly with relief, my mind opened up. I could see Misha’s profile. The gauntness of his hollowed cheekbones cut deeper by the starkness of the headlights that bled into the cabin of the truck.

It felt like relief after pressure was released, like balm on a burn, like an epiphany. Misha was sick. It’s written into his every feature.

“Are you dying?”

Misha was quiet in the driver’s seat as seconds ticked by on the truck’s clock. I realized my mistake too late—

“You remember waking up in the glade, right?”

—and I was derailed entirely, floundering, “What?”

“We’ve had this conversation before, Miles. You just don’t remember it.”

He sighed.

“I have lived for tens of centuries. I have seen millennia go by. The rise and fall of empires. I watched the end of Rome. I felt the heat of the fires that consumed Edo. I have watched nations destroy each other. 

“Yet.” His knuckles creaked with how tightly he gripped the steering wheel, “My flesh is as fragile as the mortals who live and die as frequently as ants. We were created to outlive and outclass humanity, superior in every way except for our shared weakness: the ailments and dangers of the flesh. What unnaturally claims mortals threatens the Halted all the same.”

He paused before exhaling, slow, “Even gods rot, Miles.” Our eyes met in the rearview mirror. “But, with your help, with the sacrifices of your blood and body, I will transcend. You are my Grace. My godhood.” 

Holding his gaze, I say, “You think you’re a god?”

“No, I am a god,” he emphasized. “Just not a fully realized one.”

He hummed after a moment, “I was mortal once. I met a prophet one day in my hometown that only exists in stories now. He tried to curse me as his life slipped away. Only, it wasn’t a curse. His sacrifice helped me take that first step towards divinity. He blessed me.

“That prophet was like you. They killed him and strung his body up so that the crowds could mock him. They paraded his corpse through the streets.

“But, he awoke from his grave, marching out untouched. Just like you have done. His mother went to his tomb and found it empty just as I found your glade barren.”

My sobs had long since petered out by the time his rambling had come to a stop, the tears dried on my face. I gazed unfocused on the back of the seat in front of my face as I listened to him. His words were rushed. Not in panic or in any kind of fear. He sounded almost excited, like he was getting some kind of sick pleasure out of narrating his life story. I grimaced. How many times has he told me this? Is this part of his ritual? Of killing me until I can’t remember anymore and getting to start over with this sick trip? 

We drove in silence once again, the sound of the engine’s hum, white noise.

Time passed. It gave me a long time to think, to remember. Or, try to, I guess. Misha. Mshai? He looked old, but he moved like a man years his junior. There was something wrong with him. Beyond the obvious of course: fucked in the head. I let the anger fester in my stomach. I let it feed on the frustration of not knowing.

“What is it?” I asked before I even realized I had, immediately regretting that decision.

“What is what, Miles?” He was still focused on the road.

I licked my lips, carefully sitting up onto the middle of the backseat, “What’s killing you?” What can kill a god?

Misha didn’t answer immediately and I wasn't about to push my luck any further. The silence was oppressive. The road we’re driving on was winding with thick trees lining both sides. The man had his high beams on, illuminating the bleakness of their surroundings.

Finally, he said, “Cancer, believe it or not,” he laughed humorlessly, “My telomeres don’t shorten. I do not age; yet, my cells still fail and mutate beyond my control. Yours are the opposite. You still age, evidenced by your continued growth since our first meeting. You're four inches taller than when we first met. Did you know that?” 

I didn’t, but he wasn’t expecting an answer. He tapped his fingers on the steering wheel rhythmically, “But, no matter the strain put on your body, your cells, they remain the same. Evolution, along with the permanence of death, have no effect on you. Though, I suppose, age may be the only thing that is capable of taking you from me.” 

I frowned at my lap where I was twisting my fingers together. My heart is rabbit fast, “I’m not yours, though.” Misha’s eyes cut to mine in the rearview mirror, but I continue, “I don’t belong to you.”

“You do.” I try to hold his gaze. “You are mine until your grace is served. Until I am saved.” What the fuck is he saying?

“But what if it fails? What if I can’t help you, what happens to me then?”

Misha just smiled at me, his crow’s feet visible in the mirror, “For your sake, my child, let’s hope you can.” 

I looked down again, my eyes tracking over the middle console, locking onto the man’s knife sitting carelessly in the cupholder. The phantom brush of steel danced across my throat. It was just there, casually in sight, instead of being returned to its sheath on Misha’s belt. I swallowed, hard, throat dry, and forced my eyes away. Back towards Misha. A beat, two—

He didn’t notice. My heart hammered and my hands trembled. Good—fuck, holy fuck.

Then, Misha smiled again and my heart dropped to my feet. Oh fuck, he saw.

“Do you know why I took you to your glade?”

For the second time, I’m lost with one question. My glade?

I blinked, mutely shaking my head. When Misha didn’t continue, actually waiting for an answer, and didn't make a move towards the knife, I answered out loud. A mumbled, “No.”

“You told me that you didn’t want to help me anymore. You decided that you wanted to leave.”

My eyebrows furrowed, “Leave?” The tingling of nerves in my spine was back. A gentle reminder, right now, that I was missing something.

“Yes, you tried to run.” Misha paused, “You tried to hide, but I’ve been doing this for a long time. You aren’t the first child I’ve taken in, though hopefully you're the last. You didn’t understand why our time together was so special.” The man shook his head, “I helped correct that notion.” It was all so casual, almost mundane.

“Correct that…” I was so confused, “You—” my voice breaks “—you did that?” Intestines slide against cold gravel and arterial blood sprays out in an arch. My head pounded. Someone was screaming, begging for help—for mercy. A blinding pain on the back of my skull as my nose caves in on hard rock. Agony and, with a wet crunch, black.

“Why?” I wanted to rage, to grab the knife from the cupholder and carve his face with my anger. If I moved, even twitched, from where I was frozen, I'd become hysterical and he'd pull the car over and put me down again. I have to wait. I grappled with the wildfire in my chest. I have to wait. I hardened that flame into tempered steel. I have to wait. Not yet—just wait.

With barely a whisper, “You bled me.”

“I did, and much more. You needed to learn and that was the most efficient way—”

“By torturing me?”

“Torturing,” he scoffed, “that was not torture, child. That was discipline.”

“Discipline? What—How is that discipline? Getting spanked is discipline!”

“What is spanking to a being who can recover from any injury, any poison, any malady. I could throw you in a woodchipper and you would wake up a week later without a scratch! I did what I had to, to make you better. To help you learn!” He ended in a roar. The sound of heavy breathing filled the car before the man sucked in deeply and let out a long exhale.

“I am not a monster, Miles,” he continued calmly, back in control. “It’s just a shame that you don’t remember why we have to do this yet. You understand our mission. It’s just a shame, not a setback.”

I was silent in disbelief and rage. How much pain has this man put me through? The memories were all still…fuzzy. Still out of reach for the most part, dancing along the tips of my fingers.

Misha was quiet as well, eyes on the road.

He needed to die. The tingling on my neck prickled with agreement. He needed to die and—I’d realized this before. I’d come to this conclusion before. This was not a new truth. He’d tortured me and he wouldn’t stop until one of us was dead.

Resolution settled heavily in my bones. My eyes flicked briefly to the knife again before I looked up. I took a breath. Another. I wouldn’t let this chance go to waste again. Last time—last time I tried to run. I wouldn’t run again. This ends tonight.

I turned to look out the window to my left. I just needed to draw his attention for a moment. A moment—a single second—was all I needed.

Steady.

I took a third breath and let it out as a gasp, eyes widening, mouth agape. My eyes tracked something beyond the truck’s window as it zoomed past, my head whipping around to follow it.

“What is it?” Misha mirrored me, shifting to look over his shoulder like he’s checking his blind spot. When he turned, eyes searching for an imaginary threat. I moved. I lunged across the middle console, curling my fingers around the hilt of the knife before yanking it up and sinking it deep into the side of Misha’s neck in one continuous motion. The blade sank deep, only stopping when it hit bone. The full force of my assault sent Misha’s head snapping to the side, striking the side window.

Violently, he jerked the steering wheel with a wet gurgle, sending the truck careening into the other lane and off the road entirely. 

The truck ran directly into a tree. 

I didn’t feel the glass or my head going through the windshield.

I woke up lying in a patch of grass, surprisingly pain free, and more importantly: alive. The same could not be said for Misha. If the knife hadn’t done him in, the tree certainly did. It’d crushed the entire front driver side. The corpse behind the wheel was nothing more than a mangled lump of flesh and viscera interspersed with glass shards and the warped remains of the frame and engine. 

It's over. Actually over. Misha is dead. Thousands of years of experiences were gone in a split second and the world is better for it. 

I know it’s probably weird that I’m writing about this on reddit of all places, which is fair. But I really don’t think anyone else would give me the time of day. The police didn’t. Well, they didn’t until the car crash was reported. Misha’s house was full of his crimes. Particularly his basement full of corpses, of the unfortunate souls who’d come before me and didn’t have my curse. 

Because that’s what it is—a curse. Not a blessing, not a gift, not anything relatively positive. I’m still struggling to remember things. That last month before I tried to run away, Misha had killed me back to back, over and over again. I think he was trying to stress my ability, see how much I could take before it faltered and I never woke up. I’m lucky, I guess. I hope I never get those memories back. The ones I did—well. Yeah. I’m glad he’s dead.

I have a chance to start over. They considered putting me into foster care but one of the detectives applied to foster me instead. She was one of the first people I’d talked to about everything I knew. She’s also very nice and her eyes are a dark brown, like chocolate or tree bark.

This is the end of my ability being used for other people. I won’t post again. Good bye.
