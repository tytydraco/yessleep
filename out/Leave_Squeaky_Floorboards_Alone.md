The dark floorboard in the spare bedroom- when pressure was applied to it- produced an uncanny sound resembling a voice, easily startling any poor soul who happened to plant their sole on it. I noticed “the voice” (as I eventually named it) shortly before Tyler moved out. 



I was preparing the room for the next tenant, Nicole, Tyler’s friend and fellow student at the local university, when I first stepped on that dark panel of wood, many shades darker than the others. The "voice" startled me- was someone speaking to me?



"Tyler? You here man?", I yelled down the hallway. But it couldn't be, Tyler went to school. I saw him leave.



The contrast of this panel of wood flooring with the others was difficult to ignore- you couldn’t *not* notice it, the unusual arrangement compelled you to study it, drawing you near.  I couldn't figure out why this one panel was so different from the others.



A cozy little corner room with two windows, the morning sun illuminated the pale blue walls on nice autumn mornings.  It was a pleasure to sit on the windowsill, sipping coffee and gazing at the neighboring houses.  Two letters "MB" were etched in a beautiful cursive on the frame of the north-facing window, the flowing drapes occasionally revealed the letters when the wind was high.  In very small writing underneath the letters was a date, 10/3/84, and a number “39”. Above that near the top of the frame was yet another date, 10/3/45, but in a blunt font and painted over; really only noticeable when the sun was setting.



I heard “the voice” before when the room was occupied, the sound cut through the muffled conversation and laughter of Tyler and his friends, smoking weed and listening to music.  The cacophony of noises kept my mind off more troubling thoughts, plus the aroma of weed brought me back to my college days, when life was full of promise, and not responsibilities.  What the hell was that sound though?



Tyler said to me when walking out of the house on his last day, “Hey Rodger, that dark floorboard by the closet makes this weird noise when I step on it.  Maybe you got rodents down there or somethin’.  That sound though, I dunno man…  *spooky.*”, mimicking a shudder.  Call it instinct, but something in his delivery sent an electric surge up my spine, the hairs on my arms felt electrified. I knew exactly what he was talking about, that sound was indeed spooky.



Before he stepped off the porch, I assured him I would check the floorboard before Nicole moved in.  I forgot to ask Tyler when she was coming, but the rent and deposit were already paid so I didn’t worry.  We shook hands and nodded farewell. Tyler’s stay here was brief, he just needed a place to crash for a few weeks in September until he secured a room at his fraternity house I imagine. I liked him though, he could have stayed here longer if he chose to.



“Best of luck at your new abode, brother.” Tyler nodded thank you and off he went.



When I "inherited" the house and moved my stuff in, I soon realized grandma didn’t have many tools, plus I was a lazy bastard when it came to house repairs (which there were many), so I decided to simply fix the panel with a hammer and an old nail I found in the garage.  The only other tool in the garage was a crowbar, oddly. Boxes of old newspapers, photo albums, and vinyl records lined the walls. Maybe one of these boxes contained more tools, but I wasn't ready to go through them yet.



*I recall as a child, when my parents would drop me off at grandma’s house to attend a gathering or some function, grandma never once entered this room.* 



*One afternoon when boredom and curiosity overcame me, I tried entering. I reached for the doorknob, but something gave me pause; I kneeled down and peered into the room through the old fashioned key hole. The room was dark- and it was only mid-afternoon- yet I... I saw something, an object resembling an eyeball slowly gliding towards me, towards the door, me and the "eye" now mere inches apart.*



*Not a second later, grandma began screaming, “Never, ever go in there!!  Do you hear me?!?”. Grandma never raised her voice at me before or since.*



*My fear of the unknown germinated in my mind then and there.  When an elder (especially one who barely ever spoke), without warning screams at you to NOT do something- for reasons you couldn’t possibly understand- it changes you.  The world wasn’t the cozy, safe place I previously thought.  I never again went near the room after that when I stayed at grandma’s.  Hell, I slept on the couch during those visits.  After Love Boat or some shit, grandma would put her cup of tea in the kitchen and wander off to bed, leaving me on the couch with the TV and my imagination.*



I learned later the corner room used to be her twin sister’s, Mary Beth.  On a stormy night in autumn 1984, Mary Beth went missing. One moment she was there, then... gone. Grandma was never the same after that, according to my father.  He waited a long time before he told me about Mary Beth.



Grandma passed away in December '23 and the house became my responsibility, and my new home.  For some reason my uncle didn’t want anything to do with the house and basically signed it over to me.  I have no doubt Mary Beth’s disappearance affected him too in ways I couldn’t imagine.



A gold chain with locket containing both twin’s photos- two beautiful brunettes in their prime, grandma on the left, Mary Beth on the right- dangled from a picture frame in the living room that had an old photo of a small boat inside. My uncle told me at the funeral reception that Mary Beth had an identical locket, but with a silver foxtail chain.



Every time I glanced at that picture frame, I felt pangs of guilt for renting the room out, but I really needed the extra money, and to be honest, being alone in the house creeped me out.  I’d hear strange, unexplainable sounds at night.



*I moved in officially in late summer '24, finally getting an opportunity to examine the interior of that room for the first time. I was so accustomed to avoiding it- I almost forgot it was even there. There was no one around to stop me.*



*I turned the knob. To my surprise the room was completely empty, and clean, besides some dust and cobwebs. I always imagined it would be full of Mary Beth's things, but no. Then I saw it- the strange, doesn't-belong-here floor panel. Odd, yes, but otherwise this was a cozy, unused little room. I listed it for rent that very night. Sorry, grandma.*



When the hammer struck the nail- penetrating the wood with ease- I heard an extraordinarily loud, blood curdling, inhuman scream; followed by a wailing howl of an unimaginable variety. I recalled the Tall Man’s agonizing scream when Mike cut off his fingers in Phantasm.



With trembling hands, I removed the nail.  The screaming ceased, but gentle weeping continued for a short time.



After the weeping subsided (and a few glasses of bourbon were consumed), I removed the adjacent panel to see what made that horrible sound.  Was it an animal?  Did I puncture an old pipe of some kind?  No animal I was aware of could make that sound, *and pipes don’t weep*.



My cellphone flashlight revealed what lied beneath- a large, bloodshot eye moving rapidly from side to side, surrounded by a darkness the flashlight couldn’t penetrate.  Then the pupil constricted, focusing its gaze directly at me; the hairs on the back of my neck stood up, the room grew darker, yet I remained transfixed on the Eye.



It spoke.



“Hello, Rodger.”



It knew my name.  The voice felt like it was coming from inside my own head, yet very far away.



“Can you put the panel back on?  It is getting cold down here.” it quipped.



I hurriedly placed the panel back on and scampered out of the room, dropping the hammer on the floor.



“Thanks mate.” the voice replied, sounding a bit muffled with the panel back in place.



I laid on the couch, my eyes sealed shut, never once looking in the direction of the spare room until I eventually fell asleep.



The next morning it spoke again, “When are you getting another lodger in here mate? I’m lonely.  The time is coming, soon.”



*The sentence echoed in my head, "The time is coming, is coming, coming..."*



What did this mean??



I somehow convinced myself none of this was happening and continued to look for that hammer.  Where did I put it?



Later that evening, again, “When are you getting a new lodger, Rodger?  Don’t ignore me”.



I drove around the neighborhood for hours just to get out of the house, but eventually I returned and attempted sleep in my bedroom, which was oddly cold. 



“Goodnight, Rodger.” 



The words came from underneath my bedroom floor, adding, “I don’t want to be down here.”



*Neither do I, I concurred. Neither. Do. I.*



The next morning was blissfully quiet.  I peeked into the spare room- completely empty save a whiskey glass on the windowsill.  The rays of the morning sun streamed through the curtain, coating the walls with a pleasing amber hue against the walls of pale blue.  I opened the window to breath in fresh autumn air when a knock came from the front door. Oh fuck, Nicole!  I grabbed the empty whiskey glass and shuffled over to the foyer.



Nicole, a pretty blond-haired woman, entered carrying an inflatable mattress and a few bags.  She was dropping off some belongings, then would spend her first night in the room the following day.  She slapped a post-it on the bedroom door with a phone number.  I got the impression this was only for emergencies from the gaze in her eyes.  I already missed Tyler.



“See you tomorrow.” she said as she skipped out of the house and into her black Volvo parked in the driveway.



Just to have something to say in return, I yelled out to her, "Street cleaning days are Mondays and Thursdays 11am-1pm", followed by a curt “See you later”. I don't think she even heard me.



That night, furious scratching sounds emanated from the spare room.



I screamed, “Stop it!”



The voice openly sighed, no doubt coming from underneath the floor in my bedroom again, then said something I'll never forget, “You better start praying this one stays you FUCKING LITTLE SHIT!”



I moved to the couch and turned on the television, loud.  The floor in the sunken living room was carpeted, no squeaky floor panels.  Thankfully I didn’t hear anything from the “voice” again the rest of the night. 



I awoke the next morning on the floor cradling an empty bottle of bourbon.  The details of the previous evening forgotten, erased from the chalkboard of memory.  If you’ve been there before, you know what I mean.  I threw the empty bottle of bourbon into the backyard brush, vowing to never touch the stuff again.  Of course this was bullshit, but the storm on the horizon was not, and approaching fast.



Nicole returned later that evening with more luggage, soaked from the rain. During the night she repeatedly had to re-inflate the mattress.  Between the noise of the motor, thunder, pounding rain, and Nicole’s frustrated sighs, was the squeaking of that damn floorboard.  A paralyzing realization swept over me... I didn’t nail the floorboards back in!  Oh, please God, I hope she doesn’t try to open it.



I slept fitfully that night on my bed- although I really wanted to sleep on the couch- but with a new tenant in the house, that would be weird. Tyler didn’t give a shit when I fell asleep in the living room.



I had a terrifying nightmare of being absorbed into an amorphous ether, a black void absorbing all sound and light.  Deep within this nothingness were sharp, stained teeth.  Mere words could not describe the horror of this… *thing.*  Even if there were, the words themselves would be consumed by its insatiable hunger.



I awoke at 9am and moved into the living room to lay on the couch, trying to forget the nightmare I just had.  The house was dead silent all day, the storm passed, all seemed well. I made a pot a coffee just to appear that I was a person who does something, anything.



Later that night I knocked on the door to ask Nicole if everything was ok, I hadn’t heard a sound after waking from that nightmare.  Nothing.



After no answer for twenty minutes, I let myself in.  No Nicole, just the deflated mattress and her luggage, her black Volvo clearly visible through the window.



I waited an agonizing four days before calling the phone number she wrote on the post-it.  Does she walk to her job?  Does she have a boyfriend that lives nearby?  Something felt very, very wrong.  A few more glasses of bourbon were poured before I had the nerve to reach for my phone.  I squinted at the date to make sure I wasn’t losing my mind, which felt more and more like a real possibility.



I reached the voicemail of an office she worked at.  I struggled to speak, “Hi, Nicole?  Umm… this is Rodger, just checking in”, already regretting calling the number. Nicole is gonna walk through the front door any second now... I hope.



I threw the phone across the room in a fit, almost hitting the picture frame and locket. The name of the boat, "Eye of the Sea", was clearly stenciled on the side. I stared at it until it appeared the letters were moving around. A small fly buzzed my ear, snapping me out of my daze.  I opened the front door to shoo the fly out, then walked around the block to the liquor store, leaving the front door wide open. After that intense storm, the neighborhood was now calm, serene, with a gentle breeze.



*“Nicole, where are you?!?” I shouted inside my head, repeatedly.*



The neighbors were hanging Halloween decorations on their garage door when I returned.  I politely nodded, pausing to admire the skeletons, witches and smiling Jack-O-Lanterns.  I nervously turned away and spotted an orange parking ticket on Nicole’s Volvo. The admiration of my neighbor’s Halloween decorations turned to apprehension. 



I slammed down a huge slug of bourbon and laid sideways on my bed, staring across the hallway to Nicole's room.  I could see a small bundle of blond hair poking out from between the floorboards.  The deflated mattress obscured it somewhat, but there was no doubt it was a clump of blond hair.



Pulling up the panel slowly with the crowbar revealed a ripped, blood-stained blouse, torn away from the mutilated torso lying next to it; covered in a sea of squirming maggots, dozens of small flies escaped into the air.  



From the neck down to the pelvis- one arm missing entirely- were deep gauges, bites, shredded internal organs, blood, mayhem.  I did not have the nerve to pull up another panel, where I imagine was Nicole’s head, but I could see the side of her face, frozen in a terrifying grimace.  There is something else, lying beyond the horrifying remains of a person who I only knew as "Nicole".



With crowbar in hand, I pull on the object.  A dusty, yet well-preserved skull with brown hair rolled onto its side. The front of the skull now facing me, revealing a slightly degraded silver foxtail chain around it's neck, reflecting the rays of the late morning sun.
