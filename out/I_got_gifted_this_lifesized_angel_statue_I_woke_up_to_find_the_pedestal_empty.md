I grew up in a family of collectors. 

It's a rather strange profession, but I consider myself an artistic person, and living among antiques has shaped my life in a unique way - I built my career around it, and now my time is spent on various activities, such as research, authentication, finding pieces at auctions, estate sales, flea markets, antique shops, or through private collectors. I also do a bit of restoration work and I assess the market value of antiques based on rarity, condition, provenance (history of ownership), and demand. It feels like a game of hunting down rare pieces and selling them to the right person, and I can't really describe the rush of getting your hands on something that everyone's after. It's thrilling, really.

I know you'll say it's not viable. *You don't make real money out of it.* You'd be surprised! If you've done this for a long time, like my family has, a single sale can set you up for a few years. Get there before anyone else and organize an auction, and if you're lucky you're set for life. I network with the richest and most pretentious families on an international level, and I love my job.

After my parents died, I took over their 18th century mansion and did a bit of restoration and remodeling, to get the authentic Victorian look. My house is old, and so diverse - I have three studios, where I keep my current works-in-progress, and the foyer and hallways are filled with paintings. I often host game nights, and have friends over - other antique enthusiasts.

Such game night happened last month - I had a few people over in the game room upstairs, for some wine and gin, and beer, and vodka, and rum, and more. We were on the second floor, and one of my friends, Walt, stumbled into the hallway, took a drunken look at the arched window at the end of it, then turned to me. 

'You know, that ficus over these doesn't do the window justice. You need something more grand to fill up all that space.'

I followed his pointed finger and stared at the plant, bathed in moonlight. 'It's a long hallway, and the ending is underwhelming. A statue or something would work better. A... *ficus...*' he'd spit it out like an insult, '... feels lazy. Trust me. I'll get you something better.'

'What, you gonna get me a statue for my birthday?'

'Yeah, why not. You should trust me. I know my way around antiques, unlike other... amateurs.' He smirked at me. 

'Sure, why not.' I replied, tilting my head and still staring at the poor ficus plant.

A week passed, and I'd forgotten all about that, when I got a call from Walt. He asked me if I was home, and said his present was ready for me. I told him he could come, and in a few hours there he was, with two other guys and a truck. Sometimes, I hated having eccentric friends. Some people give you an Amazon gift card. He shows up with a fucking statue in my driveway.

He unwrapped it, and I didn't exactly know what to say. *Should I... thank him? For this?* 

I won't lie, it felt too much, even for me. Judging on the tall, elongated figure and the solemn, sorrowful face of the angel, the detailed clothes and wings, it was sculpted in a gothic style. It was beautiful, but I felt like it didn't... fit. It would've fit in a cemetery, or a forest, not at the end of my hallway, especially at night. I was unsure, very unsure, but some voice in my head encouraged me to get out of my comfort zone. I kept thinking about the Donna Tartt quote. 

*Beauty is terror*. *Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it.*

'What do you think?'

'It's... beautiful.'

'Right? You seem... unsure.'

'No, it's just... I was expecting a more baroque look. But it's fine.'

'Great. I'll have the guys move it inside.'

For the next few days, I had to get used to going up the stairs and seeing the angel statue in all its glory, at the end of the hallway, crowned by a halo of sunrays and frozen in a mournful look, clothes windswept, wings half-stretched. I avoided going up there at night, or turning my back on it. I know, that was kid-like behavior, but I just needed some *time* to accommodate. 

I guess it was the most human-like thing I owned. I had other statues, sure, but not as... real as this one. I admired the artist who had sculpted it - accuracy is one thing, but you rarely find a piece that has a human feeling attached to it, that... moves something inside you. Even if that something is fear. I was a little fascinated by it, and by the uneasiness it gave me, the feeling of it actually *looking at me, seeing me.* The feeling followed me as I showered, slept, worked, ate.

I didn't know whether to feel as if it was watching over me or just watching *me* in general. 

One time, a powerful thunderstorm rattled my home. I was afraid the top window would shatter, so I went upstairs to watch over it, as if I could stop it. I wasn't paranoid enough to check if the statue moved - I knew it's just a statue. I sat on the carpet for a while, just staring, until I noticed the storm growing weaker, so I went downstairs, into the kitchen. 

At one point, I heard loud thuds coming from upstairs. My first thought was *oh, shit, the window broke and now it's raining inside.* I hurried to the hallway, and as I was going up the stairs, my stomach tensed up. The thuds had stopped. The rain hadn't.

When something, *anything* happens, the reflex is to attribute it to something rational. The way you'd think the noise outside is an animal, not an intruder. The way you'd believe the knocking on the window is a tree branch, not someone. The way you'd assume the thuds upstairs are from the rain and not from... someone running across the hallway. Even if it sounded more like that.

I made up the courage to climb an extra step, so that I could peek into the hallway. The angel statue stood at the end of it, proud and solemn on the pedestal, watching (over) me.

I ignored the knot in my throat, and went downstairs. I texted a friend about it, and then put on some show to calm down. I had a big fair to attend in the morning, and I needed to rest.

The night was uneventful. However, then I woke up, I found my front door unlocked and opened. A sudden wave of dizziness hit me - if someone had broken in, they could've stolen thousands of dollars worth of pieces. Hell, they could still be inside.

I went through the rooms rapidly, my vision blurry from fear, and my rushed search stopped at the second floor, where I froze at the top of the stairs, staring at the empty pedestal at the end of the hallway.

*That's what the running was. They stole my statue.* 

Part of me was still shaken, thinking of how easily someone had broken in, and wondering if they were planning to come back. On the other hand, I felt somewhat relieved that they'd taken it off my hands. And then there was confusion. Why steal it? Of all the things I owned? And how did they manage to move it downstairs? It was really heavy, and I would've heard it.

Then, the door wasn't broken through. It looked as if it had been unlocked and opened from... the inside.

The instinct was to call the police, but I didn't have time for that yet - I was running late to the fair. I left, planning to call them when I get back.

Evening came and so did my return - I parked my car in the driveway and phoned them, without even going inside the house. I told them everything - the noises, the feeling of being watched, the running, the opened door and the disappearance of the statue. 

When they arrived, I let them inside. They returned after 10 minutes, looking at me funny.

'Sir, what exactly was stolen?'

'What do you mean? My angel statue. Right at the end of the hallway, second floor, an empty pedestal - you can't miss it.'

'Your statue is *there.*'

My eyes widened. I frowned, looking from one officer to another and shaking my head. Then, I walked past them, into the house. It was starting to get dark, and long shadows clung to the furniture and the walls - I didn't feel afraid. I just wanted to know what was going on. 

At the top of the staircase, oddly enough, the angel statue stood upright and proud, staring me right in my eyes. The hallway was cold - the source of the breeze was a window I'd probably left open.

I turned back to the statue. I swear, I must've been tired, because I blinked and the statue seemed to blink, too. I rubbed my eyes, then stepped closer to it. It didn't look damaged. I ran my fingers across one of its arms, and the stone felt... warm. 

Suddenly, I got grossed out and stepped away. My chest felt hollow and dread and disgust had taken over me. I felt sweaty and a silent headache was making its way in - something wasn't right, and I couldn't stand to look at the statue anymore. 

I slept in the attic that night. Somehow, I felt better to be *above* it. That thing was grotesque, and the more I looked at it, the uglier it got. I began forgetting the beauty I had seen in it first. I needed to have Walt over and tell him I was giving him the statue back, so I texted him, Shauna, Penny and Louis to come over the next day for some drinks.

That evening, as I was fixing him a drink in the game room, I asked him about the statue.

'Listen, as much as I appreciate the gesture, I feel like it's not the right fit for me. I'm a bit superstitious, and it scares me.'

'Bullshit. You're not superstitious. I know you.'

'Maybe he *became* superstitious.' Shauna said, smiling. 'Who knows. You can have religious awakenings in your thirties too, you know.'

'Look, I'm not taking back my gift.'

'If you don't, I'm throwing it away.'

Silence followed. 'Really? It's that... serious?'

'I fucking hate it. Look, man, I'm sorry. I hate it. It ugly, and cursed. It follows me around at night and I haven't told anyone this before but, I think it goes through my stuff while I'm gone. It's scary.'

'A... statue?' Penny laughed. 

'Yes, a fucking statue. Have you seen it? I'd rather die than sleep one more night in the same house as that thing. If you don't believe me, go look at it. Come on, touch it. Right in the hallway.'

Penny shook her head and, still smiling, stood up to check it out. I couldn't decipher Walt's expression - disappointment? Amusement? Concern?

Penny opened the door and stepped out in the hallway. I saw her eyes widen and her eyebrows tremble. She looked back at us, then at the end of the dark hallway. She squinted. She wasn't saying anything. Why wasn't she saying anything?

'Very funny, Pen.' Walt mumbled.

'It's gone.' She spit out, her voice trembling.

We stood there perplexed, in the candlelight. 'What do you mean, gone?'

'The pedestal is empty.'

Another pause followed. Shauna rushed to the hallway to look. 'Holy shit. Did you already take it out, Tony?'

'No, we-we walked past it when we came here.' Pen muttered. 'Right, right past it... and it was there. In the hallway, at the end, on the pedestal in front of the window... in the dark...'

I shut the door.

The house was silent, and every time the furniture creaked it startled us. We were still trying to convince ourselves that it was fine, that something... *explainable* had to have happened... and, yet, our minds were working overtime to no avail. It was fucked up and unnatural.

'Listen, should we... look for it?' Walt asked, and his voice reminded me of his existence, of the fact that he was the reason why this all started.

'Why didn't you sell it? Why did you give it to me, Walt?' I blurted out.

'What? I gave it to you as a *present...*'

'You *couldn't* sell it,' Shauna said, calmly. 'No one wanted it. You *knew* something was wrong with it.' Her eyes met his, and I sensed his annoyance through what he wanted to maintain as a calm exterior. 

'I did not.'

'I don't believe you. I think you just wanted to get rid of it, and-'

*Knock knock.* 

Silence.

*Knock knock.* 

I shook my head, and mouthed to Walt to stay where he is. I don't think he wanted to move, anyway. No one did.

Then, we heard other knocks, downstairs. Nothing could have scared me more than what I heard next. 

It was Louis' voice from outside, excusing himself for being late.

I turned to Shauna in horror, and Pen bolted to the window. I heard the front door open, and Louis' voice.

'Louis, get out! Right now, please! You're not safe here...'

'What are you guys talking about? Are you upstairs? I brought some wine, I haven't tasted it yet and I think it's a little cheap, but hey...'

A pause. 'Tony, is that you? Are you playing peekaboo with me from the staircase? What have you gotten into?'

'Louis, *leave...*' Shauna insisted.

'What? I didn't know you didn't want me here... why did you invite me, then? You think I don't see you? What's with the lights? Why are we in the dark, are you playing some sort of game...?'

I had to open the door to get to him. I couldn't just yell like a coward. I placed my hand on the knob, but something was holding it from the other side. I started banging on it and yelling.

I don't exactly remember what happened next. It's all blurry. I never actually saw it *move...* and, yet, I know. I heard the crack loud and clear, and I remember looking down and seeing an unfamiliar shape, which later became a skull split open and a broken flower pot. I can't get the image of brains mixed up with dirt out of my head and the metallic smell still hasn't left the staircase. I screamed until my voice became hoarse, and I looked around for the angel, but I couldn't find it anywhere. 

No one believes us about the night Louis died. I've had the police question me, and they called me crazy, especially when they saw how shocked I was that my new angel statue was intact the next day, and how I claimed I'd found it clutching a strand of his hair... They said it was unusual for me to tie up a *statue* that could never move.

Worst thing is, they won't allow me to leave my house until they find me innocent. And last night, I found the ropes I'd tied the statue with broken, and the pedestal empty, again. I made the mistake of throwing it out the window, hoping its owner will follow it.

Now, the statue had no place to stand on anymore. Which means it keeps wandering around the house. I never look directly at it. I thought it might be one of those weeping angels, but I think I might be wrong.

I don't know where it is right now.
