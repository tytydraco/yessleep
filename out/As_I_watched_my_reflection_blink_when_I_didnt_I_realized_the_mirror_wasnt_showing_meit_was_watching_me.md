I was brushing my teeth when it happened. A quick, almost imperceptible flicker. I wouldn’t have noticed if I hadn’t been staring at myself, lost in thought.

But I *was* staring. And I *did* notice.

My reflection blinked.

I didn’t.

I froze, toothbrush clutched in my hand, heart hammering in my chest. The air in the bathroom felt thick, pressing against my skin. Slowly, I raised my hand. My reflection followed. I tilted my head. So did it. Everything was normal. Almost.

I leaned in closer, eyes narrowing at the reflection. I studied every detail—the way the light from the bathroom overhead cast a soft glow across my face, the way my hair shifted as I moved. I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong.

Then, I saw it. My reflection blinked again. And this time, I was sure—*I didn’t blink*.

My breath caught in my throat.

The reflection didn’t seem to be *me* anymore. Its eyes were too dark, its movements too fluid, almost like it was more *alive* than I was. I swallowed hard, trying to calm myself. Maybe I was imagining it. Maybe I was just tired.

I stepped closer to the mirror, eyes locked with my reflection. The bathroom light flickered above me, and I noticed a strange unease crawling up my spine.

I raised my hand again. My reflection did the same. But this time, there was a hesitation—just a beat too long.

I tried to tell myself it was nothing, that I was just overthinking it. But I couldn’t shake the sense that something was wrong. *That wasn’t me in the mirror*.

I leaned in even closer. The reflection mirrored my every move—until it didn’t.

It *smirked*.

A slow, unsettling grin spread across my reflection’s face, its eyes glinting with a malevolent gleam. The grin wasn’t mine. It wasn’t something I would ever do. My pulse raced. I jerked back from the mirror, knocking over a bottle of shampoo in the process. My heart pounded in my chest.

I stared at the reflection, waiting for it to return to normal. But the smirk remained, stretched across my reflection’s face like something out of a nightmare.

It blinked again. And this time, I *didn’t*.

A cold sweat began to form on my skin. I reached for the light switch, but my hand trembled so violently I could barely grasp the switch. My reflection’s eyes never left me.

I turned the light off, hoping that the darkness would make the unease go away, but as the room fell into shadows, I could still feel its gaze—cold and unblinking. The reflection’s eyes seemed to pierce through the dark.

I rushed to leave the bathroom, but something stopped me. I don’t know what, but I felt compelled to look back.

I turned. And there it was—*my reflection* still staring, but now, it wasn’t just a reflection. It was *waiting*.

I stumbled back into the hallway, my hands shaking. My own footsteps echoed in the silence. The hallway light flickered above me, casting strange shadows that seemed to move on their own. But as I moved away from the bathroom, a faint noise reached my ears—a subtle tapping, like knuckles gently rapping against the glass.

I turned around, my stomach twisting in knots, but the bathroom door was closed. I could still hear the tapping, though.

It wasn’t stopping.

And the mirror on the other side of the door—*it wasn’t empty*. It was waiting for me to return.
