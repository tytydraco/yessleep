I always knew that drugs were dangerous, but I never thought that I would become a cautionary tale. All I wanted was to get high, to escape the monotony of my life and feel something, anything, other than the crushing weight of my depression. But I got what I wished for, in the worst way possible.

It all started when I stumbled upon a stash of pills in my friend's medicine cabinet. They were labeled "Lyrica" and I had heard that they could get you high, so I decided to give them a try. I took a big dose of Lyrica, hoping that it would take the edge off my anxiety and depression.

But as the hours passed, I realized that I had made a terrible mistake. I was too high to be human anymore. My limbs felt heavy and sluggish, and my mind was a jumbled mess of thoughts and emotions. It was like I had stepped into a nightmare, one that I couldn't wake up from.

As the sun began to set, I stumbled out of my friend's house and into the woods. I don't know why I did it, but at the time it seemed like a good idea. Maybe I thought that the fresh air would clear my head, or that the trees would offer some kind of solace.

But instead, I found myself lost in the woods, with no idea of how to get back to civilization. The trees loomed over me like dark sentinels, casting long shadows across the forest floor. I stumbled through the underbrush, my heart pounding in my chest.

That's when I saw it. A cabin, nestled deep in the woods, with smoke rising from the chimney. It looked warm and inviting, a beacon of light in the darkness. I stumbled towards it, my mind foggy and confused.

As I approached the cabin, I realized that something was off. The windows were dark and empty, and there was no sign of life. But the door was unlocked, and I pushed it open, stepping inside.

The interior of the cabin was dimly lit, with flickering candles casting eerie shadows on the walls. The air was thick with the scent of woodsmoke and something else, something metallic and bitter.

That's when I saw her. A woman, huddled in the corner, her eyes wide with fear. She was chained to the wall, her skin pale and bruised. I tried to speak to her, but my words came out garbled and slurred.

I felt like I was trapped in some kind of twisted nightmare. But as I looked around, I realized that this was all too real. My heart pounded in my chest as I saw a blurred figure standing in the corner, grinning at me. 

It was looking at me, smiling, and Its eyes seemed to glow with an evil hunger. I could sense that he was there to torture me, but not kill me. He had plans for me, just as he had plans for the woman lying next to me. And at this point, I realised that I was caught in a web of terror, and there was no escape.
