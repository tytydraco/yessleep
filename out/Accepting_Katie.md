Katie was an amazing woman, there really wasn’t anyone else like her. I couldn’t begin to describe what my life with her was like. I've never felt the joy, the comfort, and the love she gave me, anywhere else before meeting her. She was all I had and all I really needed.

Though Katie wasn’t without her flaws; no one is. She used cocaine, she used it a lot. I never got on her about it, she didn’t deserve that. I was fine with it, just so long as it made her happy. 

I also knew getting on her would make her upset. Katie was an amazing woman, I can’t state that enough but everyone has their rough moments. She wouldn't get upset at me often but when she did I hated every second of it. 

Her vitriol was scathing, it felt like she tore into me each time she’d lash out. The worst of it was when she hit herself. She knew I hated it when she did that. I wanted to stop her; I wanted to grab her arms and make her stop but each time I tried she’d fight me off and just hit herself even harder. 

I don’t want to go on about her flaws, she doesn't deserve that. I tell you all this to give you an understanding of the state of our relationship at that time.

It was a late night, I had just gotten off work and was driving back home. 

Our house was located about fifteen miles from where I worked, I had inherited it from my grandfather two years prior. Miles of dense forest were sprawled all around it, the foliage consuming any light the full moon offered. Rain poured lightly and a slow wind passed through the trees. It was nice, it was peaceful. The slight dribble of rain and the whistling breeze served to put my mind at ease after what had been a long day.

That morning I had upset Katie. I accidentally left the stove on and what had been a couple of judgmental comments from her eventually turned into a grueling and utterly hostile argument between the both of us. I left for work when she started to hit herself. 

With every foot closer I got to the house the serenity the forest gave me dissipated and a feeling of dread and  apprehension took its place. This wasn’t the first time we had an argument like that, I knew that it could carry into the later half of the day. When Katie got angry she could stay that way for days, the thought of having to come back to what I just experienced that morning was devastating.

I glanced down at the stereo and checked the time, it'd only be five minutes until I saw her. My stomach dropped, heart racing. I had to pull over, I had to get a grip. I was breathing out my mouth, heavy and labored. The feeling in my stomach worsened, I felt like I was going to throw up. I got out of my car, my legs barely managing to carry me out. I leaned against the side of it and rested there, taking in the fresh air.

This wasn’t a new occurrence, I have an anxiety disorder. I learned that fresh air does help, even if just a little. Even still, nothing I did could make it go away. 

I spent about ten minutes resting outside my car and focusing on my breathing. When I got back inside I still felt horrible, but just well enough to keep driving. I couldn’t just sit outside all night, whether I wanted to or not, I needed to get back home. 

I was pulling into the driveway, our house was about twenty five feet away from the main road. The distance made the drive there feel like an eternity. My chest felt tight, My heartbeat reached my throat. I didn’t stop driving, the sooner I’d be home the sooner I could go to sleep and rid myself of the heartache this day brought. 

I finally parked and left my car. The panic I felt slowly faded as I approached the front door, numbness rose in its stead. I opened the front door and saw Katie lying in an armchair with a small plastic bag of cocaine on the stand by her side. 

The entire upper half of her body was leaning off the left side of it, her long brown hair sprawled across the stand. Her neck was hung back and her mouth was agape. She was pale, her face discolored and bruised from the beating she had given herself that morning. I stepped closer to see that her eyes were half closed and rolled back. As I stared at her I saw that she wasn’t breathing. 

I called 911 immediately, she had overdosed and I knew it. The paramedics arrived after twenty minutes; It didn’t even matter, she was gone as soon as I found her. Fentanyl was found in her system, the coke she bought had been laced with it. She suffered a respiratory failure followed by cardiac arrest, shortly before I arrived home. She suffered and died while I panicked like a bitch.

I couldn’t even explain all that was taken from me the night she died. Her loss took away any hope of a joyous future, there is no joy to be had without her. Her loss made me a husk of who I was, I may as well have died with her. I realize the selfishness in talking about what I lost when she died in such an awful way, but I don’t care. I didn’t care if it’s selfish to feel that way, I was suffering, I couldn’t accept it. 

The idea of bringing her back; bringing myself back, was as absurd as it was alluring. Ever since I was a child there were rumors about the woods that surrounded my home. There’s a small walking trail that leads off the road only about fifty feet away from my house. It was said that at the end of the trail was a ritual site, a site that could be used to bring back anyone you desire. All you needed was their remains. 

The specifics of the ritual were never stated by anyone. No matter who I asked, no one had any sort of explanation as to what happened during it; no one except my grandfather.

My grandfather was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia six years before he died. He had lived alone for fifteen years before his diagnosis. His wife, the woman he lived with, died from a stroke a year before I was born. My dad hardly visited them before her death, and whenever he did it was only to see his mom. My grandfather suffered from PTSD following his service in the Vietnam War; he was a tunnel rat, one of very few to survive unscathed. 

His PTSD caused him to have a completely strained relationship with my dad, if you could have even called it a relationship. My dad never spoke to him for a long time, he only started opening up after the loss of his mother. My grandad had an odd relationship with her, growing up my dad constantly heard the crashing downpour of invective insults they struck upon one another. These were essentially emotional shouting matches used to vent the stresses of their unsteady marriage. In these moments they seem to stand each other, but not even a few minutes afterward, no matter how badly he scathed her; my grandfather would start praising his wife like she was the most important thing in the world. They’d always end up making amends. 

The two of them had lived isolated from the outside world for nearly a decade, they only had each other. My dad knew that her death had to have devastated him. Despite the detachment my dad felt towards him, he didn’t feel that Granddad deserved to suffer alone. It wasn’t a quick process, my dad still didn’t show up to visit too often, I was only taken twice to see my grandad before his diagnosis. Even still it showed that he and my dad were slowly starting to reconcile. As I got older my dad told me that he would have never taken me to see him if it had been before his mom died.

Each time I visited my grandad sternly told me not to venture to the woods around the trail near his house. His stern warning kept me away from the area until I owned the property. I headed through the trees and brush only to find a small dirt mound about forty feet from the walking path. I didn’t make much of this until recently.

I visited my granddad more often after he was diagnosed. He grew kinder and more caring after his diagnosis, treating me and my father with a surprising amount of appreciation. I think he knew he had to show that he cared before it was too late. 

His dementia eventually started to take hold. He had been pulled out of work and his driver's license had to be revoked. He started leaving sticky notes as reminders of how to do different tasks, all around the house; he stopped leaving them when he lost his ability to write. He was soiling himself, eventually not even bothering to clean himself after he did so. My dad and I came by frequently to care for him, he’d often ask to see his wife as well. 

As we stayed to try and help him he started becoming aggressive toward us, he would grow furious anytime his condition was mentioned. My father had been pleading with him to try and get him to be voluntarily placed into a treatment facility, he’d be bickered or yelled at in response. The decision to place him involuntarily into a treatment facility came after he snuck out one night while we were sleeping. My father woke up about thirty minutes after he left, my dad searched and found him on the trail. The oddest thing was that he wasn’t walking down the small path, he was crawling on it. He was crawling on his stomach, he had a flashlight in his mouth and both of his arms were at his side, he was pushing himself forward with his feet and shoulders.

I later visited him in the treatment facility he was in. This was about four years after he had been diagnosed. By this time he was mostly distant from everyone and everything around him. He would stare into space and he hadn’t spoken a word to me in months. I still visited him though, my father did too. We stayed adamant that we’d be there for him. 

I pulled up a chair next to him and asked how he was, I didn’t expect a response. To my shock he said he was well, he even gave me a warm smile. His reaction left me stunned, though I didn’t have time to think about it, I needed to make this short moment I’d have with him. 

I asked him a variety of different things and got surprisingly articulate responses. After spending about fifteen minutes conversing I realized that I had never asked why he had been on that walking trail that night. I was afraid it would sour the moment I was having with him but I was curious, I had been wondering about it for the two years since it happened. After debating myself on whether I should, I finally asked.

“Why were you heading down that trail a few years back?”

His warm features dropped instantly. The question shocked him, his eyes widened. He inhaled slowly and explained.

“I had to see my wife.”

 I paused, “What do you mean?”

“She was at the end of that tunnel. There’s a tunnel out there, at the end of the trail; I had to pass through another to bring her back.”

I felt my mood dampen, I thought I was losing him, he wasn't making sense.

“What do you mean?”

“She was at the end of the tunnel; I brought her out of it.”

He was still hard to understand but I started making sense of what he was saying.

“So you were trying to go down a tunnel because you were trying to bring your wife back?”

“Yes.”

My mind went to all the different stories I’d heard about that trail as a kid, and how it led to a place that “Brought people back”.  

“Are you talking about that old rumor I always heard about? The one with the ritual?”

“I didn’t know they still talked about it. Yeah, I guess that’s what it is.”

My granddad looked at the floor and remained silent for what seemed like minutes. I thought he’d stay that way until he looked back up and stared at me. Staring into his eyes I noticed they were completely empty and dead, his pupils were wide even with the bright LED lights that illuminated the entire treatment facility. 

He finally spoke, his voice was rough and he slightly shook his head side to side with every word, “Don’t you ever go down that trail, kid, you won’t want ‘em back.”

For the four years following that conversation, I pondered on what he had said. I eventually concluded that his story had likely been an instance of different recollections he had of his wife, his time as a tunnel rat, and the stories he heard of the ritual, being combined and turned into one memory. After accepting this explanation, I didn’t think about it; that was before Katie died. 

The idea of a ritual that could bring her back was ludicrous. There hadn’t been anyone to actually claim they brought back anyone. The only person who claimed they brought someone back suffered from an illness that ate away at his mind; that said person was the only individual to give any account as to what even happened during the ritual.

It was completely unreasonable to find any validity to the claims of anyone who spoke of the ritual and its properties, however, I only needed one reason to see if their claims held any merit: Katie.

That was all the incentive I needed to head to the ritual site.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It was four in the morning. The sun rose in the horizon turning a sliver of the black sky above to a dark pool of blue. A familiar breeze passed through the thick foliage surrounding me, leaves were rustling and falling on the path ahead. 

There hadn’t been anyone to mention how far the ritual site was from the start of the trail so I put on my hiking boots and left early to give myself enough time to reach it before nightfall. I brought various essentials in case of a long hike; a one-person trekking tent, provisions, and a Swiss army knife were just some of the items I had in my backpack. Though I carried something that was completely invaluable: Katie’s ashes. 

She had been cremated a week after she died. I had asked her family for her ashes and didn’t expect them to say yes. I imagined that they thought I was partially responsible for her death; I was. To my shock they didn’t seem to mind me asking, they gave them to me without hesitating, it was like they didn’t care. 

The forest was barely visible, I had to use a flashlight to illuminate the path ahead. As I walked the trail, the foliage lessened, making it easier to see through the trees. I could hear the sounds of rustling to my left. I turned and raised my light to see what I heard, it was two black vultures picking flesh off the bones of a dead deer. I turned forward and looked above me to see three more vultures flying in to join them. 

As I was walking along I entered a state I could only describe as autopilot. My body carried me along but my mind was lost in thought; thoughts about Katie, thoughts about the warning given by my grandfather, and thoughts about the vast wilderness I headed through. The quiet ambiance of the woods helped fuel the state of transfixion I was in. The chirps of crickets, the singing birds, and the slow wind, all formed into a chorus that was almost hypnotizing. 

The chorus stopped instantaneously leaving me in a deafening silence. This immediately broke me from my trance. I had been looking down just in front of my feet for the past five minutes. I finally glanced up to find that the forest had completely changed. As far as I could see the trees were all dead, not a single leaf in sight. I turned around and saw the same thing, a completely dead and barren forest.

I continued despite this, the only sound being that of my footsteps and my increasingly erratic heartbeat. 

I was walking along looking straight ahead with my light revealing the path. I stopped when I heard the sound of hissing directly to my right. It sounded deep and raspy; guttural like the roar of a lion and fading in and out in a rhythm like steady breathing.

I looked to my right and brought my light up, it was a black vulture atop the branch of a tree. It was facing me with its head lowered, staring down at me.

Its beak was opened slightly and its body remained almost completely still, the only movements It made were violent shakes every time It hissed at me. It was furious. 

I didn’t even have time to process what I was seeing before I heard more hissing further to my right; another vulture met my gaze. As soon as I noticed It the entire forest gradually erupted with the cacophony of hundreds of these black vultures. Their sounds morphed into a deep rumble that burrowed itself into my mind like a parasite. There were no coherent thoughts amidst the bombardment of harsh noise around me, only a feeling: absolute dread. 

I was now running, sweeping the beam of my flashlight all around me. Atop the branches of every single tree in front of me and behind sat one vulture, one tormentor. 

I kept running until I saw it, the dirt trail I had been following had led me to a large cave opening, the hissing of the vultures stopped as soon as I reached it. The opening was huge, spanning about thirty feet in diameter. This was the ritual site, this was the tunnel.

I processed its enormity as soon as I saw it, I didn’t care. 

I turned away from it, looking and seeing that all of the vultures were still watching, not making a sound. I paced the trail, my hands grabbing the sides of my head and eventually moving to my face. 

“What the fuck is happening!” I screamed, muffled by my palms. 

I started running my fingers through my hair. I couldn’t take my eyes off the vultures around me, I didn’t even think I could continue. 

My anxiety always leaves me panicked and in a state of pure stress. This was something entirely different; I was terrified. I couldn’t begin to process what was happening, I had seen nothing like this before. I didn’t know what to do. 

I stood silently, staring at the vultures, completely lost in the moment. Thoughts of Katie slowly emerged in my mind, eventually bringing me out of my stupor. They had become a reminder as to why I was there in the first place.

As I was brought back I finally turned to see what was inside the opening. I held out my flashlight to reveal a massive slope leading about forty feet beneath the earth. The slope was rough, a misshapen staircase of sharp and jagged rock. It was just vertical enough to head down on foot.

A descent into this cave would be dangerous, only one misstep would send me through an onslaught of crushing impacts that could kill me. 

I hated even looking at the slope, I hated knowing that it was my only path if I wanted to continue onward. 

A part of me still wondered if this ritual was real. Maybe strange things did happen in these woods; the vast expanse of sudden death of the trees, the absurdly deep hisses of the vultures, and the ferocity with which they hurled them at me were all strange occurrences that I couldn't disregard. But the resurrection of someone I loved was simply so ethereal in concept that I couldn’t help but question it. These questions were mostly spurred on by the danger I faced if I chose to move forward. 

Staring into the descent before me I was presented with another thought, the thought of turning back. The thought of turning back and heading home, never to see Katie again, never to know joy again. I would never know what was in this massive pit that lay just a short distance from my home, I would never be able to say that I actually tried to push forward once the going got tough. Nope, instead I’d be left as someone who failed all they loved not just once, but twice; all because I was too much of a fucking pussy to be there for her. 

With that realization the decision had been pretty much made for me, I was going to descend. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I trekked the slope slowly, carefully placing my feet onto the largest and sturdiest rocks I could find. It was completely pitch black, I was using the flashlight to reveal what was below. Each step I took let loose a cluster of stones that’d tumble and crash against the floor, a reminder of the cruel fate that could await me. I gazed up from where I stood and shined my light on the great cavern in front of me, it was like an entire world beneath the one I knew. I had no time to ponder it, I had to keep pushing.

I was now almost five feet away from completely descending the slope and standing on flat terrain, I gently placed my right foot onto the nearest rock when suddenly a thunderous woosh roared behind me. I turned to my left, facing the direction of the noise growing louder each second. As I looked I saw the vivid outline of beak and feathers heading straight towards me, before I could react the bird flew into me. I fell, toppling onto the flat ground, laid on my side. I rolled onto my stomach, surprisingly unphased by the collision. I looked up to see hundreds of vultures just a few feet above me. There were so many of them that it was like one mass of shuffling feathers, their combined sounds of flight formed an earplitting stampede. As I saw the last of them fly by I slowly rose to my feet. I brought up my flashlight and found nothing but an empty cave, they hadn’t left so much as a feather. Their stampede ended and the cave was mute once more.

My heart was thudding, quaking my whole body. I turned to the opening and brought my light upwards, wanting to get a full glimpse of the chasm they emerged from. The opening I had just used to get down here was gone, completely covered by the stone ceiling that lined the cavern.

I stood staring at it, my jaw hung open and my eyes began to water. I was trapped here, completely alone in the dark. 

“No, no, no…” each word left me as a trembling whimper. 

I rested myself on the cave wall, my arms crossed and my face pressing into them. I wanted to stay that way. I wanted to rest there forever, shielded from the catastrophe this journey had become. 

The reality was that staying here would do nothing for me, I needed to move forward, I needed to go deeper.

I pressed on, each step labored by my weakened legs. The cavern stretched far out right from the slope. It was enormous, my small flashlight unable to capture its full size. I lowered the beam of light down, keeping it low enough to shine the ground but elevated in a way to reveal the cave wall. I stuck along the wall of the cave, not passing through the middle of the cavern to avoid getting lost in the darkness that encased it. 

As I went, my grandfather's warning came to mind. I pondered why he had been crawling when this cave was so vast, and most importantly why I never met my grandmother if he brought her back? Along with the thoughts of my grandfather came something much more pressing: What am I even heading into? 

As suddenly as that thought came I stepped on something and it shattered, echoing through the silence. I looked down to see what it was; a white and brown egg. 

The faint sound of footsteps came to my right, I turned my flashlight. A vulture was walking towards me, its eyes locked onto me. 

As my light revealed It I noticed that behind it lay another egg, pressed against the cave wall and about 6 feet across the one I stepped on. The egg was accompanied by two more vultures, one sat on top of it, and the other sat near it.

I realized that the cave must have narrowed while I was looking ahead. I didn’t rest on this thought as I saw the other two vultures stand, eyes focused on me. 

I started jogging down the center of the cave, I scanned both my sides and saw eggs lined up perfectly from one another like office cubicles, two staring parents resting near each one.

I heard multiple birds moving behind me, as I jogged I looked behind me, every vulture I passed was following me, some moving in to join them. 

As quickly as I saw this I progressed into a full sprint down the cave tunnel, I stared down it to see something I missed. It was a light, there was a light at the end of the tunnel. 

I hastened down the tunnel and started seeing insects; flies and beetles all passed me by. 

I didn’t care, I needed to reach the light.

The amount of insects was growing, I could hear myself crushing beetles beneath me, the flies didn’t pass, instead slamming into me. It didn’t matter, I was getting closer.

There were now hundreds of vultures chasing me, herding me in further like shepherd dogs.

As my chest ached and my legs flared, as I felt the weight of beetles giving in under my feet, I finally reached the end of the tunnel. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The stench. Before anything else, the stench hit me first. It was as if the entire Earth was dead and rotting. It loomed in the air and placed itself within my lungs, I could practically taste it. 

As I stepped through the light I headed into a different world. The sky, the ground, all of it was a dark shade of red; a heavy fog permeated, tinged with the same color. The dark red landscape forced my eyes to readjust. The sky hummed with buzzing akin to that of a fly. It was just above my head but I was unable to locate its source. 

The ground squished with every step I took, maggots and beetles embedded within it. My body was frigid; I found myself clattering my teeth, shivering despite the multiple layers of clothing I wore. As I walked I saw two vultures about three feet apart, pecking at the floor like pigeons with bread crumbs. They stopped once a muffled whaling was heard behind them. 

I checked to see what it was. There were figures, something giant stood over a man, animals circled his abdomen. I stepped closer and inspected the scene fully. 

A giant vulture held the man’s head in its beak, he screamed but the beak trapped the sound. The man was half laid, the vulture holding him upright. The man’s skin was melded purple, gray, and blue; riddled with various pockets of exposed flesh that crawled with maggots. A large cavity opened from his stomach and his intestines were hanging out, a hoard of flies pooled around them. A few feet away stood four vultures, two on each side, slowly pulling out his exposed entrails like they were playing a game of tug-war. The man thrashed, kicking and swinging his arms, but the vultures gave him no mind. 

As I heard this, more screams bellowed from out of the fog. I stepped towards them and saw that the man wasn’t alone. I looked to find two more figures lying on the ground, both suffering at the hands of the vultures.

There was a woman, she was chalk white pale and being held down by another giant vulture. It was stepping on her, using its right foot to keep her in place as another vulture of normal size dug into her left eye. It had its beak lodged deep into the socket, It scraped it around inside as blood trickled. The woman shrieked in pure agony, her screams were so strained, so painful; I had to cover my ears, if I hadn’t I would have snapped and broken down, succumbing to a myriad of overwhelming emotions. The second figure was a skeleton lined with strips of red flesh. The skeleton lay still as the vultures tore away at the little flesh It had and It responded by unhinging its mandible in a silent howl. 

Watching these victims, one thing caught my eye, all but the skeleton were wearing hiking boots and backpacks. 

As this came to mind a giant maggot nearly my size burst from the ground and started squirming towards the screaming victims.  

I felt weak, taking in long raspy gasps of air, but I didn’t hesitate; I ran as fast as I could the way I came, slowed by the wretched feeling in my stomach. 

As I ran my aching stomach churned, reducing me to a light jog. It was becoming unbearable, I had to stop. I bent over with my hands on my knees. I vomited, it hit the floor, landing on the insects beneath me. 

As I let out the contents of my stomach I noticed my hands. They were pale; just as pale as the woman I had seen moments ago.

I heard two large footsteps rumble through the ground under me.

I rose and looked up, a massive vulture stood over me with its head hung low. It was over twice my height, with a wide frame that made me feel microscopic. Its eyes two massive bulbs of darkness that stared right through me. 

I started backing up slowly and It started moving closer, matching my pace. As I backed up I remembered the knife I had in my backpack. It was my only option, my ability to run was shot as my breathing worsened, I just needed to halt it in any way I could. I felt my way behind me, unzipping my backpack and eventually grabbing the knife. I raised it above my shoulder and plunged into the vulture's stomach with both hands on the grip.  

It stopped and stupidly, without realizing, I did the same. A small stream of blood seeped from the wound, It never took its gaze off me. It pierced the air with a long hiss, its voice like no living creature on this planet; I can only describe it as a death rattle of thunder, the sound nearly blew out my eardrums. As It hissed It shook viciously and started to march towards me.

I didn’t even run, I just stared at It, barely moving back. 

“Stop, stop it… G…Get away…” I was hardly audible, using whatever voice I could muster for weak pleas of mercy. 

It could have easily struck me down, It could have grabbed me, maimed me, or It could have crumpled me with one of its large wings. But It didn’t want to, It wanted to scare me, It was playing with my dread.

It kept hissing as It approached, each hiss lasted about ten seconds, fading in and out. I eventually gathered the strength to turn and jog in the opposite direction. Once I did I found a large formation with a hole in the middle, an entrance to some sort of cave system. A woman ran just feet from it, leading a group of flies. As she got closer I saw her left eye; a black socket with a trickle of blood just below it, she was one of the victims. Her movements were so stiff that it looked like he was running in stop motion. She passed me, not giving a glance to the exit directly next to her. 

My jog was turned into a full sprint, I felt rejuvenated in a last-ditch effort for survival. I heard the vulture flying towards me as I raced towards the entrance, I barely made it before the beast grabbed me with one of its massive talons.

The passage was too small for It to pass through. I had escaped.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The entrance led me to a room that was only about fifteen by twenty feet, the ceiling reached just above my head. It was too dark to see all this initially, I once again had to use my flashlight. As I observed the room I noticed that it was lined with the same red texture as the area I just left, I saw insects still embedding themselves in it. As I looked inside the room I found another opening, it was so narrow that it could’ve crushed me, but I saw no other passage of escape. 

I didn’t hold back, I cried. I paced the room, each step I took was followed by the squishing floor. I was hysterical.

“You can’t make me do this, you can’t make me do this…” This became my mantra, recited to the world around me. I didn’t want this to be my only way out, out of this hellish realm, out of the rut Katie’s death brought me. 

As I saw the opening I was struck with a memory that left me reeling. It was Katie, Her neck hung back and her mouth was agape, she was dead and I had let her die while I was whimpering on the side of my car. I couldn’t leave her that way, not a second time. 

Hyperventilating and practically gasping for air, I rested my backpack and pulled out a small plastic bag containing her ashes. I held it firmly in my right hand and put my flashlight into my mouth. I pressed myself against the ground, laid on my stomach. My face was laid on its right cheek, larvae crawling underneath it. My arms were at my side, I was using my feet and shoulders to scoot myself forward. 

I scooted myself into the opening, using the fingers on my left hand to slightly boost myself as I pulled myself forward; I stopped doing this once I felt the squirming bugs slither onto them. The tunnel I pressed against was moist and fleshy, its smell was repugnant. I felt the life being squeezed out of me, there wasn’t so much as an inch of free space above me. As I passed through, the tunnel started rumbling, growing tighter as it did so. I could feel the tunnel's moist lining pressing further against my arms and legs, the ceiling lowered, threatening to flatten me like a hydraulic press. The smell grew worse, now a sour, all-encompassing aroma of rotten fruit and eggs. I vomited into my mouth, its ejection was so violent that it nearly took the flashlight out of my mouth. I was forced to swallow it. I kept pushing myself forward and as I did so the tunnel slowly declined, eventually dropping steeply. I slid down, the rumbling tunnel getting tighter and tighter until it dropped off entirely. The tunnel widened; I was falling, heading face-first into a black void. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I hit the ground hard, landing on the top of my head. Harsh light burned into my eyes. 

The pain in my skull was dull and searing. I raised my left hand and placed it on my head; a clump of maggots crawled through my hair. I Looked up to find that I was out of the tunnel and out of the hellscape. I was in the center of the ritual site, the massive cave opening now completely covered by dirt. I looked up further to the sky and saw no trace of where I had emerged. 

I was finally under the light of day, white fog fell upon the land and I couldn’t see ten feet in front of me. 

Slowly a dark figure limped out of the fog. Its body was large and swollen, its skin a disgusting shade of gray. It had green and dark blue veins creeping from its swollen ankles all the way to its stomach. I saw its torso, It had a large gash stretching across it, flies swarmed the incision. I met its gaze to see that It had brown liquid pouring like snot from its nose and mouth, I met its gaze to see its long sheets of hair.

It was everything I refused to accept, everything that ate away my heart. It was everything I had journeyed for. It was death, It was Katie.
