Who among you honestly didn’t hide from monsters under the bedsheets when you were a child? I did. I swear I saw them but even when I screamed no help came. Just got a shriek back from my parents and a smack across the chops for disturbing them.

So, I watched the shapes in the night lurk and hid out of sight waiting for the dawn. After a while they didn’t seem so bad. I stopped screaming, the bruises mum and dad left just healed but still I saw the shapes of the monsters. No one told me why I shouldn’t be afraid.

I was maybe 8 or 9 when the thing came along. My room was on the ground floor next to the patio dad had laid. I heard the scrape of the wooden table and chairs on the concrete slabs. Something settled down with a rattled breaths and I could feel its gaze fixed on me through the closed curtains.

Its glassy eyes met mine as I peeked through the curtains. It’s flesh too loose to make expressions. 

‘Good eeeevening…’ it breathed. ‘How was your day?’

I said nothing. I made no more sound.

‘It’s ok. I know how it feels if you’re not ready’.
I stared at the thing for a while. It sat cross-legged covered in grey rags, gaunt with barely any muscle left, with white flowing hair down to its neck.

Knowing it wouldn’t move, I went back to bed and listened to the breathing all night. I also knew I better not tell anyone about it.
Over the next week, I heard it every night. Breathing and unchanging it sat on the table always staring at me. 

‘How was your day? It’s ok if you’re not ready.’
On the seventh day I said ‘hello.’ I told the thing I was scared of it, that it looked bad, it was ruining my sleep and it was making school hard.

‘That will pass. I just have nowhere else to be and I just think no one listens anymore.’ The breathing slowed. ‘But thank you for telling me. I’ll see if you can sleep now.’

It uncrossed its legs and stepped off the table. The thing was taller than I expected and was gone in a few strides.

The thing was back the following night. But this time the fear wasn’t the same. ‘How did you know how I’d feel better? How did you know I wouldn’t run away’ I asked it.

‘I’ve been just where you are now’ it replied. ‘Tell me about your day.’

And so, night after night I did. Countless days went by, as the thing told me things I needed to hear.

‘The monsters are there. You can see them can’t you?’ It breathed. ‘You just need to stand up to those monsters. You don’t need to be afraid.’ I told the thing that I was scared what the monsters would do to me if I left my bed. ‘I won’t let them hurt you.’ The thing replied. ‘I haven’t let them yet, have I?’

The thing was right. The following night, the monsters came back as usual. This time though, the thing stayed away. I knew I had to take back control. I threw off the covers and darted to the light switch. They were gone, as if they’d never been there at all and my room looked the way I always wanted it to.

I barely heard him stomp down the corridor as I took in my victory until the door swung open and smacked the back of my head. Something picked me up by the hair and pulled me upwards. The pain seared on my scalp and through the tears I saw my dad pull back his fist and fire a punch into my stomach. Sickness spread through my abdomen. I felt the need to vomit but held it in.

‘Do you know what we do for you?!’ He shouted, ‘There’ll be no food on the table if mum and dad can’t get up in the morning!’ I couldn’t hold the vomit anymore. It sprayed out on the rug as I tried to keep it behind my lips. He told me to clean it up: quietly he emphasised as he switched off the light.
I could tell the creature was watching me through every window as I moved around the house at night hunting for carpet cleaner in the dark. It felt everything I did the gasped back tears the bilious feeling in my belly and the forming bruise on my skin.

‘There’s something you’re not telling me’. It said the following night. I wasn’t sleeping anyway. The bruising made it painful to lay the way I usually do. That night I let the thing talk. ‘It’s ok,’ it said. ‘I’ve seen it for myself now. There are things that push you down here. Stop you being what you’re supposed to be.’
It continued, ‘it might hurt now, but where are the monsters now?’

The thing was right. Any shapes on the ceiling were just shadows from the trees outside.
‘Tomorrow, you’re going to do something for me. You’re going to make someone else feel the way you do now. You’re going to see how strong you are.’

It didn’t take me long to figure out what I’d do. There was a boy from the year below, he played alone and didn’t seem to know anyone too well. But every break time at school he’d disappear somewhere. I was going to find out where. 

My plan was straightforward, I’d be kept in by the teacher that day. All I did was grab the whiteboard eraser at the start of the lesson and held it under the table until the teacher needed it. Then as soon as they did, I hurled the thing at the board, missing their head by a foot or so. 

The classroom roared with laughter, the teacher didn’t seem to know what to do. It was kind of weird I guessed. But I had my wish, I watched the boy walk to the school fields with everyone else before he peeled off and walked just to the edge of the school grounds. It wasn’t clear whether he was even supposed to be there. No one was watching or bothered him but me as he climbed half-way up the old windmill on the grounds and jumped behind an old stone wall.

He did the same thing at lunchtime. Difference was he had an unexpected visitor. The boy was crouched down when I perched on the stone wall from above. I jumped down at him, kicking him in the back of the head and shoving him to the floor. Now I was kicking his stomach. I struck two or three more times until the cries came out. He barely saw me through his tears. I’d been smart, no visible bruises. No one said a word to me the rest of the day.

The thing looked different that night. Meatier, stronger, but friendlier. I on the other hand felt different. ‘You know how it feels now.’ It said, the lips had grown now, and its teeth were whitening. ‘Tomorrow you’ll do what I’ve done for you. Then there’s one last favour I have to give’.

I didn’t expect the boy to head back to his spot. My mum told me I didn’t look great so told me to stay home that day, but of course she didn’t bother to stay home and check on me. So, it wasn’t too hard to sneak back to the windmill and wait just out of view.

The boy came back anyway. I gave him a few moments to settle himself before I asked him. ‘Why did you come back?’ He was silent at first, so I gave him an olive branch. ‘It was me that hurt you yesterday. I won’t do it again if you tell me why you’re here’.

‘It’s easier to do what I want to do here’. He said sheepishly. The boy decided to look behind the stone wall. ‘You don’t look great’. He told me. I smiled back at him: I feel fine.
I listened to the boy for the rest of the hour before he asked, ‘will you be back tomorrow?’ I was happy to make the promise.

The thing had changed clothes that night. A suit and tie covered most of his skin and colour had returned to his hair. ‘Thank you for the favour, now I the one I promised. Do you know where to find a screwdriver?’ I nodded. ‘Do you know where the boiler is?’ I nodded again. ‘Well, I’d like you to take that screwdriver and jam it in every hole on the boiler you can find. Keep going until you hear it hiss.’
‘Won’t that wake my parents?’ I asked the thing. 

It shook its head, ‘I’ll make sure it doesn’t.’
I found the thing easily enough, but I didn’t get what I was supposed to do with it. The screwdriver didn’t really do much when I poked at it, until I decided to take the panels off. A few blue rubber pipes let out a hiss with just a few jabs.

The house was silent now. I expected my parents to still be up or come running for me at any moment. But there was nothing, their door was even open, and I could see them lying together... Motionless.

The thing was stood by my window when I came back to my room. With a twist of its hand the handle turned on my side and he pulled it open. It was leaning in now.

‘Where would you like to go?’ The thing asked me.

‘I’d like to wait by the windmill if that’s ok?’
The thing nodded at me, reaching out its hand. Its hair was full now, its eyes a deep brown. I reached out and felt warmth in its paper-thin skin as I looked at his full lips and white teeth. He looked almost charming.
