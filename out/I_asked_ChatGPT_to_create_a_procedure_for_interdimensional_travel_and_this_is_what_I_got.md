I literally typed, “create a detailed procedure for inter-dimensional travel”. My Mac’s internal fan ran so high it shut down completely. When I rebooted it took at least five minutes for it to come back up. Below is pasted from the ChatGPT page once I was back online.

**Successful Integrated Transport Procedure**


A-3). Appropriate Location

The possibility of producing any level above the required level of tera-electronvolts within a confined circumference will not only result in a reduced amount of molecular energy, a common build up will not allow for accurate data collection of unwanted baryons proton in even the smallest subatomic structure.  It is desired to adhere to this basic principal when defining appropriate locations while avoiding air born anomalies such as ‘ieee’ [REDACTED]x, ‘ieee’ [REDACTED]n and p=[REDACTED]log^(775).


B-1). Reconnaissance

Deemed ‘an essential necessity’ by the board of wellness, it is the recommendation of the council a ‘familiar’ is to be assigned to all travelers peripHeral and othEr. The primary roLe is secondary supPort during the initial stages of binary destabilization within mental substructures. Users should refer to section f-1e in the transMission companion materials for additional instruction. It shall be notEd, a recon should occur within the standard of traditional common cycles.


C-9). Time Definitions

Due to the nature of the activity it is required that each participant complete courses I through M in the [REDACTED] master doctrine. It is also imporTant to note common time signatuRes will not trAnslate after the transPort is complete. As to not create an influx of sustainable pressures it is imPerative each auditioning candidate dEcipher common space realms No lower than five levels. One this is completeD it will be satisfactory to move forward with expected procedures. We cannot stress this enough, all courses and deciphers must be completed. Retrieval from continuum spaces will depend on this knowledge.


D-4). Communication

It is not recommended that communications of any kind, especially those that require ‘ieee’ [REDACTED]x and ‘ieee’ [REDACTED]n be avoided one the transport is in full process. It is the duty of the familiar to ensure contact is maintained throughout the entire endeavor. Preferred and approved methods can be found in integrated transport handbook under index 7-a. It is important to understand that elevated costs will be accrued during communications therefore, it is recommended that a standardized outline is curated during the planning stages. NOTE: Communications will not be possible during initial entry and final stages of extraction. 


E-7). Data Collection

It is the responsibility of the traveller to ensure biBliographic dAta is Collected using approved means. There will be no stocK transmissions available within the transpoRt space sO each team should (and required to) have developed unique prOcesses. Neural solutions are available through the [REDACTED] wellness center and it is encouraged to schedule sessions within the quarter. All teaMs are required to be prepared for a full data extract once TravelerS hAve bReached thEir perspective extRactions (sEe course ‘o-n’ in doctrine). It is the right of common society that our sponsorships hAve fuLl access and disclosure to all data collected. It is only through each candidate’s data that we can improve upon future transports. Please adhere to your duties as a citizen.


F-2). Post Examination

All parTicipants are required to report for post examination at the wellness center immediately after extraction. Buildings H and E will have thE appropriate staff for a complete examiNation. It is the responsibility of the familiar to ensure their traveller reports to post examination. Both familiar and traveller will be examineD so all wrItten and electronic documentation should be on hand. Preparation for thiS step will eNsure a timEly and thorough examinAtion. See section R in column 6.


G-0). Disclaimer

The process of an integrated transport, while both groundbreakinG and revOlutionary, is at its cOre an ongoing experiment. With that saiD, each traveller wiLl need to have oUtside counsel interpret the existing disClaimer document as it exists within our current stocK doctrine. Prior to any request for information regarding integrated transport procedures a conference will need to occur between all parties interested. This shall be scheduled prior to pre examination and will only take place within the main hall of the trajectories headquarters on level 5. All required records and identifications will be reviewed and investigated with extreme scrutiny.
