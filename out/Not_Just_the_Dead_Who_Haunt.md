Perhaps you thought only the dead can haunt you?  
No.   
You all will be familiar with the first part of my story. If not happening to yourself and your own parents, then you would have seen something similar happening with your grandparents, or heard about it from your co-workers, or even through a popular TV show- maybe *The Sopranos* or *Grace and Frankie*.    
One parent dies, and the other grows absent-minded. At first you think it’s just silly little mistakes- anybody can misplace the keys, or lose their way to the grocery they have shopped at for the past twenty-five years, or accidentally call you by their wife’s name. It happens all the time. You laugh it off.   
That phase lasts from two weeks to six months.   
Then something terrible happens. Maybe police become involved- hopefully no-one gets hurt. After that, everything happens fast. Family phone calls, frantic meetings with bank managers, forms and forms and forms, then waiting, more waiting.   
Finally, moving day arrives. Their new home. The care is great, the photos look so glossy and pretty.   
They don’t want to go. They hold your hand and ask when you’ll take the home. It’s terrible- like a sick joke about the first day of school.   
I blocked out the day I left my dad at the care home. There was nothing else to do. Nobody even bothered to console me, everybody just assumed it was the right thing to do. A few told me I was lucky to get a spot close to my own place, so I could visit easily.   
Then the haunting started.     
I first woke up to the crackling sound, a few days after my father was placed inside the home. I knew what it was at once, even though I hadn’t heard it for over twenty years. That crackling noise.   
My dad, crouched on the living room floor over giant, absolutely giant newspapers, his radio crackling beside him. Occasionally he would reach out and fiddle with the dial, and the crackle would change. I could understand some of the words.   
Dad never read newspapers seated on the armchair “like normal men”, as mom said. He liked to spread out newspapers on the floor around him, a human island in a veritable ocean of inky smelling paper, and sit in the middle. His evening routine.   
The crackle of the radio.   
It was dark. I tried to push away the old memories mixed up with the dreams I had just woken from and concentrate on the present.   
“Paul” came through said the crackle. My eyes were wide open, staring at the ceiling. The cracking static grew louder. It was Dad’s voice, but his voice I had known as a child.   
Another layer of static filtered through the wall “*the Soviet bloc*” and then “Paul, you’re gonna die soon.”  
The rush of fear into my heart was so strong that I thought I would die on the spot.   
“Dad?” As ridiculous as it was, I said it out loud. I knew Dad was miles away, well looked after.  
“The food here is so good. Your mom such a good cook. She was here.”  
Crackle mom had died five years ago.   
His voice rang through, as clear and close as if he were in our living room, when I was a child, pushing my cars along the newspaper edges. The pattern of the carpet so big and brown. The friendly crackle of the radio as Dad stretched out to twist the knob.  
The crackle subsided, and I heard Dad’s voice again.    
“I’m sad you’re gonna die sooner than me. No father should have to see the death of his child, it’s unnatural.”  
*“according to Reuters”*  
“I really like this place.”   
I flopped back in bed, trying to bury my head in the pillows, but Dad’s voice was crisp.   
“I like this place, you know. But your mother is very upset. She says the nurses are quite saucy.”  
The crackle was louder than ever, seemingly drilling through the pillow.   
*“During his visit with Reagan”*  
“I don’t want to hear about your death. It’s too bad your mom isn’t here. She would tell you.”   
*“In other news”*  
“Remember your first bike son?”  
The crackle dropped in volume. Now it sounded like the rustle of newspapers.   
I whimpered out loud “Dad, I’m not going to die”  
Crackle crackle *Lady Diana Spencer and Prince Charles… and now, our favourite song of the year…”*  
The faint beat of a pop song echoed in my bedroom “*Better Davis eyes*”  
“That’s your mother’s song! Should probably play it at your funeral. I won’t come though. I can’t bear it when your mom cries.”   
*Bette Davis eyes*  
The song faded. I was alone in my bedroom, everything was quiet.   
The next day, I took a couple of hours off work and visited the nursing home.   
The nurses and attendants smiled and showed me to his room. “much as expected!” they said in cheery voices.   
Dad was seated in a large comfy armchair, with a tray propped in front of him. There were colourful magazines and squares of fabric on the tray.  
“Hi dad” I called out.   
He looked at me and smiled gummily. “Your mother would make something of this!” he said, holding up a piece of cloth. I smiled back, and left shortly after.   
How am I supposed to bear to see him like this?   
An extra loud crackle woke me up that night, followed by Dad’s voice, as strong as when he was forty.   
“You’ll die very soon Paul. Then what am I going to tell your mother?”  
“*John Wayne Gacy known s the Killer Clown was sentenced to ”*  
“Dad please!” I cry out in the dark room. “I’m not going to die!”  
“Shhh son I’m trying to listen to this. Go to your mother”  
A moment of silence. Then the crackle grew loud, layered with the rustle of the newspaper. I could see Dad clearly, crouched low over the papers, and my toy cars neatly arranged round the edges, the border between the paper and the carpet.   
Dad lifted his head and his voice rang through my dark bedroom. “You’ll die before me Paul. All these poor young men- their parents grieving their hearts out. Isn’t natural”.  
“Dad” I said to the lonely darkness. “I’m not that young myself anymore, but I’m not planning to die soon.”  
A sharp burst of static punctured the air, and then nothing. He was gone for the night.   
 The haunting continued much like what I have described. Not every evening, thank god, and I went on sleep medication to block some of it out. But at least two or three times a week, I would be jerked awake by the sound of the crackling radio, and Dad’s voice predicting my imminent demise.  
I booked a full medical check up for myself.   
I could hardly bear to drive, let alone cross the street. Sometimes I caught myself standing by the kerb, with my eyes stretched in terror looking both ways, unable to step into the grey road.   
Slowly I was becoming paralysed, unable to participate in normal social life.   
That phase went on for about a month.  
Then I received a call from the nursing home. Dad had passed in his sleep.   
I was terrified of what he would say to me that night- I stayed up for as long as I could before I fell into a curiously peaceful sleep.   
That day, I found myself crossing the street without going through a paroxysm of fear first.   
He didn’t come back. And I haven’t died. He was wrong.   
Although I can sleep through the night now, I miss the crackle of the radio. I miss hearing dad’s voice incorrectly predicting my untimely death, layered with headlines from the 80s.  
I will never hear him again.
