Hello again, I’m Ranger Jackson and I work at the National Park that doesn’t exist, Forest National Park. It’s a Canadian National Park with trees that get taller, blocking out more of the sun, the deeper you get. Also, anyone who comes here forgets their visit the moment they leave. If you haven’t read my previous story, ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h9vnn6/i\_work\_at\_a\_national\_park\_that\_doesnt\_exist/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h9vnn6/i_work_at_a_national_park_that_doesnt_exist/) ) I recommend checking it out because I go a little more in depth about the Forest. I’m glad that most people were able to remember the story, I was worried that the internet would “forget” too once I sent the post out. I guess it works the same way as Julie’s walkie-talkies though.

One of you was interested in the stories of the other cars that are in the parking lot and, to be honest, I don’t know what happened to the majority of those people. Not to brag, but not many people die on my tours. Most of our disappearances happen because people believe they don’t need a guide to navigate the Forest and wander off on their own. We don’t see them come here, we don’t know what happens to them, and they don’t ever leave. 

That being said, there was one abandoned car whose owner was seen again. This was during summer a couple years back. One day after bringing a tour group back, I noticed a new car sitting in the lot. The owner was already gone. At this point, I don’t even question new cars showing up. It’s always the same conclusion, some time later the government guys just take it away. I assumed that this one would be no different.

A week or so later, Smith, the park scientist, asked me to accompany him on a dive to explore geologic features adjacent to the East Stream on the boundary of the Sunlight and Twilight zones. Usually I don’t do any of that exploratory stuff because that’s what did in Ranger Daniels, but I used to have a lot of respect for Smith and I didn’t want to leave him alone to the whims of the Forest. We started out shortly after 3pm and our plan was to be out by 8:30, before the sun set. When our lux meters read 10, just on the edge of the Twilight zone, we placed a stake on the bank of the East Stream and made our way into the southern tree-line. 

I really wish I could say that some weird things happened, but it was about as ordinary as something can be when you’re working in near darkness among trees taller than skyscrapers. To be entirely honest, I was bored. It didn’t help that I know next to nothing about geology so I just had to stand by while Smith was poking at rocks half-buried in pine needles with all sorts of scientific equipment. I took to using my binoculars to look around for something to do. I didn’t expect to see anything because where we were is deeper than most normal wildlife stray and too shallow for the other wildlife, but I noticed movement far off in a deeper part of the Forest. I thought at first that it was some trick of the Forest, but there, weaving through the trees like a drunkard, was a distinctly human silhouette.

Without taking my gaze off the figure, I moved over to Smith and hit him to get his attention. 

“Hey! Watch it.” Smith said. Then, noticing what I was doing, he stood and asked, “What is it?”

“I want to make sure I’m not going crazy, get out your binoculars.”

He grumbled something about not being cryptic and looked out into the trees. “Well, that’s no animal I know of.”

“Do you think it’s a person? Like, an *actual* person?”

“Let’s not chase after if just in case it’s not. Get your gun out.”

I pulled my service pistol out its holster and held it at my side. It was close enough now that I could tell it was a woman and she looked much worse for wear. She seemed to be moving with some purpose, looking up to the tree tops before stumbling to a tree to the left, then to the right, and repeating. The movements felt far too human to be a farce, but I’ve seen a lot that felt real and ended up being a trick. She was on track to miss us some 40 yards to the south. “She seems legitimate. I don’t think it's right to leave someone for dead even if it’s 50/50 that it’s a trick.” I said.

Smith scoffed. “Fine, Daniels. Hand me your gun and go risk your life, I’ll stay here.”

After glaring at him for his morbid joke, I handed him the gun and walked towards her. Once I was about 30 yards away, I called out to her, “Are you alright?” She jumped and turned to me, a look of primal fear in her eyes. She stood frozen, as if waiting for me to make a move before she could decide what to do. I raised my hands to show that I meant no harm and she seemed to relax. When she spoke, her voice came out scratchy. “Where am I?”

“You’re in Forest National Park. I’m Ranger Jackson,” I pointed towards Smith, “that’s Smith. We’re going to get you out of here.” I turned to Smith and waved him over to us. 

The woman hunched over and crouch-walked over to me, reaching a hand up tentatively to grab my shoulder. Her eyes got wide and under her breath she muttered, “You *are* real.”

“Yep, now just follow us. We know the way out of here, alright?”

She nodded and straightened up a little bit more. Smith seemed annoyed that we were leaving earlier than he had intended, but the woman seemed grateful that we were helping her out. On our way we asked her some questions and learned that her name was Grace and it was her car that had showed up a week ago. Whenever we tried to ask about her time in the Forest, though, she would clam up. As we got further into the Sunlight zone, it was no wonder why. She was covered in scrapes and bruises. Though, strangely, her skin was a sickly grey and wrinkled, like those hairless cats. I figured that it was just because of the humidity, but it rubbed me the wrong way.

When we resurfaced, we took Grace into the visitor center to get her food, water, and medical attention. I wanted to get her to leave immediately since nothing we could do could help her as much as leaving the park and forgetting ever being here, but Smith wanted to keep her for questioning since he hadn’t met someone who had spent a week in the Forest and lived to tell the tale. I tried to argue, but Smith went so far as to threaten to get me fired. Getting fired is a fate worse than death and Smith absolutely had the power to do it, so I had to concede.

I left the visitor center and it wasn’t until 3 days later that I got any news. First thing in the morning as I was getting dressed for the day, I got a knock on my cabin door. It was Smith. Without so much as a hello, he said, “I can’t get anything out of her. She asked for you.” Then he turned and, without looking back, started walking towards the research building. I followed him to the building and through its sterile hallways to an unmarked door which he unceremoniously opened to reveal Grace bound to an interrogation table with handcuffs. She looked terrified, staring at her hands and rocking back and forth. Without a word, Smith pushed me into the room and slammed the door behind me.

Before I could do anything, Grace looked up and her face slowly stretched into a smile. “Ranger Jackson. Your friend is a very bad man.” 

“Smith is not my friend. What has he done to you?” I said, backing towards the door. I knew she was restrained, but something about her smile made me feel like I was in immediate danger.

“What hasn’t he done, Jack? He wants me to tell him about the Forest and he’ll do anything for the information. But you… What do *you* want, Jack?”

My back slammed into the door, handle digging into my spine. Maintaining eye contact, I tried the door. Locked. I cursed under my breath and consigned to my fate, walking to the interrogation table and sitting down across from Grace. “I want to get you out of here, out of Forest National Park.”

“Why?”

“When you leave the Forest, all your memories of it go away. I can tell you are distressed, I think it would be best if you forgot your visit here.”

In a flash, her face transformed. She lunged towards me. In a panic, I kicked backwards, flipping my chair. I hit the ground hard and scrambled backwards. “WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I *WANT* TO FORGET?” In the next moment her face relaxed into a smile again and she looked at me in amusement as I laid on the ground trying to catch my breath. “Look at you. All you’ve seen and you’re still scared of something just like you. Don’t you want to be just like Smith? Don’t you want to learn more?”

I shakily picked myself up and walked a few steps back from the table. I noticed that the skin around her wrist where the handcuffs were attached had peeled back and blood was spilling onto the table. “I don’t. I just do my job, I’m not a scientist.”

Grace sat back down, an almost professional demeanor taking over despite the deranged smile across her face. “I know. That’s why I wanted you here. I’ll tell you what I know because I know you won’t benefit from it. Please, sit.”

Hesitantly, I picked up the chair and placed it some distance from the table before sitting. 

“Good. Ranger Jackson, what do you remember from before you came here?”

For a moment I mentally stumbled as I tried to recall what came before the Forest for the first time in years. I knew of the world outside- locations, events, cultures, facts- but I had no memories attached to any of them. I found my earliest memory to be feeling nervous as Ranger Daniels taught me the ropes of being a tour guide. “I guess… I guess I don’t have any.”

Grace nodded. “That’s right. The Forest is pruning your mind. It’s a gardener, clearing weeds for a new, beautiful bed of roses. It’s doing the same for me and I am open to its shears. I’m jealous of you, all of you, even Smith. You’re barren patches of soil. But, at the same time, I’m not jealous because you kill its seeds. I embrace them. When I was down there, stumbling through the darkness among terrible beasts, it killed me. Killed and reshaped me like the plow does a field so I could be sowed. The seeds have just begun sprouting and soon I will be as wonderful as those beasts. Smith could never do that, he would sooner die. But you? You could. Right now you are a shell, but if you just walk among the trees you could become so much more.”

She stared at me expectantly as if she was waiting for me to jump up and run into the Forest at that moment. “I’m content as a Ranger, I don’t need anything more than that.”

Grace’s smile faded and she almost looked sane. “I understand. One day you will. Joining me is a far more gracious fate than choosing to leave. Daniels learned that and you will too. Goodbye Jack.” She was too far gone for reasoning. I tried the door again and it was unlocked. I left the research office and went to clock in for work as if nothing had happened. 

That night I woke up to Smith pounding on my door. “Ranger Jackson! Come out here right now!”

I got up, quickly pulled on my ranger uniform, and opened the door. I was met with the barrel of a gun, my gun. Instinctively, my hands shot into the air. Smith looked mad. “Come out of the cabin and walk to the research building.” I did what I was told, there’s not much you can do when someone has a gun pointed to the back of your head. He guided me through the halls of the research center back to the room where Grace was being held. There were drops of blood around the base of the door which was wide open. Grace wasn’t in the room anymore, but the handcuffs had never been unlocked. On the interrogation table was her arm, laying in a pool of blood and covered in bite marks from where she had chewed it off. On the wall behind where she had sat, scrawled in blood, was a note that read, “See you soon Jack”

I felt the cold barrel of the gun slam into the nape of my neck and Smith said, “Look. See what you did? You freed her and she ran right back into the Forest.”

“I didn’t free her, she chew…”

“SHUT IT! I don’t know what you did, but she asked for you and you’re the last person she talked to. One thing is right, though, you will be seeing her soon. She’s in the Forest somewhere and you’re either going to find her or I’m going to kill you. Which will it be, Jackson?”

My mind was racing for any way out of the situation. Both options were a death sentence, but one afforded me a little more time. Smith marched me to the East Stream entrance and handed me a headlamp. Under the dark of night, the Forest is much more foreboding. Every zone has the same light level so it’s almost impossible to know just where you are outside of measuring the width of tree trunks. The only person I knew who had done a night dive was Ranger Daniels and he told me that, just like in the ocean, deep animals come up for food in the darkness. 

I started down the stream, every sound making me flinch. As I swung my flashlight around I thought I saw eyes reflecting back at me from the darkness. Now and again I could’ve sworn I saw something moving with me just at the edge of my flashlight beam. Eventually, I made it to the point where I usually turn tours around and I stopped. If I thought there was a chance I would die going this far, then going further is like digging myself a grave. Suddenly, I heard movement further down the stream. Distinctly human movement. I steeled myself and walked into the unknown. 

I followed those footsteps for over an hour deeper and deeper into the Forest. Eventually, the sound started coming from my north and I had to stray off the stream and into the tree line. It was only a few more minutes until I saw her, curled up with her head between her knees at the base of a tree the width of a building. “Grace! You need to come with me.”

She slowly looked up at me and her mouth stretched into an unnaturally toothy grin. “Ranger Jackson. I told you you’d be seeing me soon. I’m not coming with you, you’re coming with me.” She stood and I finally got a good look at her. She had changed since I last saw her. Her sickly grey skin was loose and hung off her body like a burlap sack. The place where she had chewed her arm off had already healed and a sharp piece of bone stuck out from the stump. Her eyes looked rough, like they were made out of stone, and her irises had gone almost white, giving her eyes the appearance of marble spheres with holes drilled in them.

At that moment I decided that maybe getting shot to death wasn’t that bad of a way to go and took off running, but before I could make it more than ten feet, she was on top of me. My head slammed against the forest floor and stars filled my vision. I tried scrambling away, but she jabbed the broken bone sticking out of her arm through my calf and started dragging me deeper into the Forest. My vision swam from the pain, but I knew passing out meant potentially never waking up again, so I gave up struggling against her to save energy. 

I’m unsure exactly how long I was being dragged before I noticed a deer standing behind a tree just ahead of us, watching us. Grace noticed it too and stopped, yelling some nonsense at it. This seemed to scare it and it ducked out of sight. Grace huffed in annoyance and continued dragging me, but there it was again, standing behind a different tree, only its head peeking out, just watching us. Grace stopped and yelled again and the deer disappeared again, just to reappear on the other side of us moments later. She seemed to be getting extremely agitated and she pulled my leg off her arm, letting it fall with a very painful thud. She ran full speed at the deer, yelling profanities, but this time the deer didn’t move. She lunged at it and it dodged out of her way, leaving her sprawled on the ground. In that moment, I saw fear, real fear, cross her face as the deer reared up and its body split open revealing rows of molars before coming down and engulfing her whole. Muffled screams emanated from its body for a moment until a sickening crunch silenced them forever. 

It continued chewing, the awful sound of Grace’s body being rent to slurry, for several minutes as I laid in shock, pain, and fear on the ground where she had left me. Once it was done, it convulsed, body distorting as it swallowed the mush into a larger body somewhere just out of sight, and turned towards me. It walked out into the open and seemed to never end. Leg after leg with horribly twisted hooves attached to a flattened, hairy body emerged from behind the tree as it walked towards me. When it was right over me, I felt its hot breath on my head as it sniffed me. Then, by some miracle, it moved on. It walked right up to the base of a tree and its malformed hooves crimped into the bark allowing it to climb up the tree. It moved like a centipede and it took quite some time before the whole body, which ended in a flat tuft of fur, disappeared into the darkness above me. 

I didn’t move for a long time, but eventually I stood and limped south, back towards the stream. I felt like I was in a dream as I made my way back towards the surface. It wasn’t until I was well into the Sunlight zone, barely brightened by the pre-dawn twilight, that I remembered Smith was going to kill me. When I got to the edge of the Forest, there he was, sitting on a log in the clearing. He hadn’t noticed me yet, so I ducked into the tree-line and made my way south, just within sight of the clearing, until I could just barely make out the roof of my cabin through the trees. Then, I made a break for it. Smith saw me and fired off a few rounds, which missed. I made it back inside, grabbed my lamp off the desk by my bed, and waited for Smith. He burst through my door and one swing knocked him out cold. 

Smith left Forest National Park that day. He didn’t tell anyone, leave a note, or even take anything more than the clothes on his back. Everyone was surprised, he had worked there for decades and had no inclination to leave. He wandered back into the park that night with no memories, a concussion, and a red welt on his head. It’s a miracle that he survived, even the normal Canadian wilderness is a force to be reckoned with.  Andy, our honorary on-site medic said that he must’ve passed out when his memories went and cracked his head on the road. Smith stayed with us, though he’s a completely different man now. He relearned all his research and does frequent dives to learn more about the Forest. I don’t join him anymore. 

As for Grace, her car got taken away by the government guys a few months ago. To be honest, when they did I hoped it would be my last time thinking about her, but here we are. Despite her delusions, the Forest isn’t a gardener, it’s a lumberjack, cutting down healthy trees to plant invasive species.

It’s just started to snow as I’m typing this. There should be fewer visitors now that winter is really setting in. I won’t have to go into that damned Forest as often and maybe I’ll have more time to write stories like these. Oh, one last thing, if any of you visit the park and have a lamp with you for some reason, I’ll buy it off you. Julie won’t get me a new one. Until next time!
