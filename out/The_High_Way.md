 I have never gone on a road trip, since I always travel by plane. But since it's a holiday and the company I worked for closed for a week, I dicided to go on a road trip. It's summer so I chose to go to a cold place. From my city I had to drive for almost 36 hours. It was a long road trip so I packed my bags and I was going to head out in 5am.

When I left my home, I had to go 7 miles to arrive to the High Way. The high Way has 6 lanes, 3 on each side. With small trees in the middle. When I arrived to the High way gate, they gave me a small piece of paper. It reads:

Rules for the High Way
1. Don't drive for too long, rest your car every    2 hours. You may park on the dirt road on the side of the high Way.

2. Never rest at night on the dirt road, you may sleep in Highway Oasis. They are 15 miles apart from each other. You don't want "them" to follow you.

3. Never pick up people asking for a ride, they might not be who you think they are. (Don't ask for a ride yourself either)

4. If you see someone on your back seat, stop the car immediately and run around the car for 15 times screaming "leave" without stopping. ( This rule only apply if you are driving alone or no one is on the back seat)

5. If you see a red sports car on your rear view mirror, drive as fast as you can until you arrive to a Highway Oasis. Never let it catch up to you.

6. In 115 miles, you will see rotting corpse chasing your car, floor your gas until you see a High Way Oasis.

7. The Highway Oasis is the only safe place to stop and eat. Our Highway Oasis signs are painted in blue. Never go in when the signs are a different color, they are fake.

Always wear your seatbelt and drive safe

I was confused. Is this a prank or something. I just crumbled it and dropped it on the floor. 75 miles have passed and I saw an old lady on the back seat. I looked at her and asked, "Who are you and how did you get here" She didn't answer. Her eyes turned red and she said in a deep voice "Oh, I think it's you who should be polite." I remembered the rules. They were real. I immediately got out of the car and did as rule 4 said. She disappeared.

"What the fu- did I get into" I thought. What type of High Way is this? This is not real. Then I passed mile 115. I saw a man in my backseat and a bunch on rotting corpses following me. I was in a dilemma. Do I floor the gas or should I do rule 4. I did rule 4 fast. A corpse grabbed me on the back of my shirt. I kicked it and the man has disappeared. I floored my gas almost hitting 90 mph. Thankfully I was 2 miles away from the High Way Oasis. Thank God I didn't die. I was 2 steps away from my grave.

But then when I got out of my car to stretch, I saw the sign of the Highway Oasis that I parked in. A red sign. My heart sunk. Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck. All the drivers on the Oasis stared at me all saying "Wrong stop Buddy". I got into my car and started the engine. It didn't start. I did it again, nothing happened. Fuck. My life fashed before my eyes. I ran to a  nearby 7/11. Things were distorted. I ran into the security room and closed the iron door. In the cameras I could see drivers banging on the door. I saw a note on the table. It reads

If you are seeing this, you broke rule 7. Don't worry, you can get out but not as safely as you think. Take the pistol in the drawer. Run out of the window into the woods until you see a different road. "They" will chase you but don't even think of stopping until you see your car on the road. Get in your car and don't stop until you see the actual Highway Oasis. They will chase you until you arrive there. If they catch up to you, shoot yourself or die with a painful death which is worse than being skinned alive.

Alright. Either I live or die. I immediately jumped out of the window. They woods were filled with red eyes which were chasing me. I tripped but luckily I kept my balance and didn't fell. I got into my but I couldn't trun on the engine. Fuck. I forgot my keys. The dark figure with red eyes were surrounding me as I write this. I don't know if I would get out alive. If you see my car. Please help. I don't want to die.
