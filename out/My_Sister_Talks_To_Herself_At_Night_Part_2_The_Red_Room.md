The Red Room dance club had a reputation for sleaze even when our parents were young, and the decor hadn’t changed much since then: badly painted crimson walls, fake chandeliers, dark wood booths that formed a circle around a scuffed-up dance floor–and mirrors *everywhere.*

Colored lights swept through a rowdy, sweaty, packed-tight crowd. Ugly as The Red Room was, its nearness to the university and dirt-cheap drinks meant it could always count on a full house.

It was after one A.M. when she finally showed up.

I could have believed she was just a look-alike, a coincidence, a blurry vision brought on by the two-for-one cocktails I’d been throwing back all night–

*If she hadn’t been wearing clothes from my sister’s closet.*

I recognized the golden hoop earrings I’d bought Maia for Christmas in 2015 and the sparkling sleeveless shirt that had been the cause of so many arguments with our parents. The black jeans she wore were the same ones I’d packed away in a cardboard box when we gave up hope that my sister would ever wear anything but pajamas.

The way she smiled, her energy–it was all Maia. Suddenly I felt like an awkward preteenager again, watching my popular older sister move effortlessly through a crowd, pick out a guy she liked, and effortlessly lead him away to dance with her alone–

But that’s where the similarity ended. The longer I watched, the more wrong and twisted the sight became. The slender, mop-haired boy who Maia was dancing with began to look tired, even sick–but he kept dancing like he couldn’t stop. Sweat poured down his pale forehead and his legs trembled as he tried to follow her rhythm. Maia pressed herself close to him, forcing him to move with her even though he clearly didn’t have the strength to keep up. She clamped her lips onto his and he went limp, like he was some kind of horrible human puppet held up only by her mouth. *I had to do something!*

The two (*or was it four?*) cocktails hit me like a truck the moment I left the stool. By the time I’d staggered across the dance floor to where the pair had been, Maia was gone. The boy stood where she’d left him, swaying like a light wind might blow him over. I grabbed his shoulders and shook.

“Wha…who are you?!” He puked a sickening quantity of ruby-red blood all over me. His eyes widened. “What the fuck did you do to me?!” he groaned–

And  his knees gave out. He was on all fours now, retching up something dark and hideous. More of it leaked out of his eyes.

People nearby had stopped dancing. The back of my neck prickled as more and more stares turned toward me; even the bored-looking bouncers on the wall had started moving. I shoved my way through the crowd and out to my car, my hands shaking.

I drove home as fast as I dared, hoping I’d beat my sister home–

Hoping she could give me an explanation for the insane scene I’d just witnessed.

*“Maia!”* I flung open the door to my sister’s bedroom, expecting to catch her taking off her club clothes and slipping back into bed after…*whatever she’d done*…to that boy. Instead, I found her just as I’d left her earlier that night, unmoving in her bed. With a massive effort, Maia turned head and looked at me. Her mouth opened and closed, but no sound came out…

*There was no way that this girl had just spent the night dancing at The Red Room.*

“What do you think you’re doing, yelling like that in here?!” My father shouldered past me and ran to Maia’s bedside. He knelt beside her and turned to me. “Don’t you know your sister needs her rest? Who knows what all that excitement might’ve done to my little girl…” he stroked Maia’s hand, his big brown eyes full of concern.

“Are you *drunk?!*” My mother asked. She’d appeared silently behind me–just like she always had when I was about to get in trouble– “Don’t tell me you *drove home* like that!”

“I’m going to bed…” I muttered, backing into my room and locking the door behind me.

“This conversation isn’t over!” my mother whispered through the keyhole. I was acting childish and I knew it, but the truth was that I felt guilty. I really *did* reek of The Red Room’s cheap liquor, and Maia’s eyes had filled with fear and surprise when I’d shouted at her. Maybe I really *had* made things worse, and for what? A weird hunch I’d had?

I was laying awake, angry at myself and wishing I could undo the whole thing, when I heard my sister’s voice through the wall for the third time.

*“It felt amazing to dance again!! I need a new outfit though, something modern and stylish….I’d give anything just to go to the mall and try something on…”* I gulped, my throat dry from fear at the wispy, impossible sound of my sister’s voice. All noise from Maia’s room stopped; I could feel her suspicion from the other side of the wall. *“I’ll be beautiful…”* she finally went on. *“I can’t wait.”*

“Rough night?” my father asked the next morning, when he saw me down my fourth cup of coffee.

“Mmm.” I grunted. I was still trying to piece together what I *thought I knew* about Maia.

One, my sister or someone who looked just like her was running around while she was supposedly in bed.

Two, each time my sister went out, she talked up her plans to herself–or to this mystery person.

Three, Maia’s excursions always happened at night…and her next target would be the local mall after hours. If I could catch her in the act…

“Look, I, uh, lost my temper yesterday. I didn’t mean to take it out on you.” I was so lost in thought that I didn’t realize that my father was apologizing to me. “It's just been so long since we’ve had any good news about Maia, and I can’t stand the thought of her getting worse, or even…” he didn’t have to say the word *dying.* It was always in the back of our minds.

“It’s okay.” I forced a smile. The tension dropped from my father’s shoulders.

“Good. Just, uh, get outta here before your mom wakes up, yeah? It’s gonna take her a while to forgive what you did…”

*And how long would it take her to forgive what I’m doing now?* I wondered to myself that night in the mall parking lot. I’d just called home to confirm that Maia was still in bed, apparently asleep. My mind was running so fast that I couldn’t even remember the excuse I’d made up for my own absence, although my parents seemed to accept it without question. *Maybe they needed some space too*, I thought glumly as I looked at the dark shape of the massive building ahead. I’d parked at a nearby apartment complex and snuck through a gap in the face to arrive here: on private property after hours. Ordinarily the mall would be locked up tight, but since half of it was under renovation, I figured I *might just* be able to sneak in through the construction area.

I was right.

Looking back, I wish that I hadn’t been.
