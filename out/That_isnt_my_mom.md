I am currently typing this from the public library as even the idea of being at home sends a shiver down my spine. My mom had been diagnosed with cancer 4 years ago, but it wasnt the chemotherapy/loss of hair type of cancer. It was a tumor on her spine, pushing slightly on the base of her brain. She got really bad 3 months ago. Barely able to walk without assistance, constant pain, the pressure would build up in her head so much she could tell when and where it was going to rain even from avout 4 states away.

I give you this information because last month she wanted to go camping on her own. She wanted to call an uber, have it drop her off at a camp site, and she would camp for 2 nights. I didn't like the idea of this but I only allowed it because I didn't know how long she had left and I didn't want to deprive her of a possible last source of entertainment. Before she left she hugged and kissed me with a huge smile showing her five freckles. She was still beautiful after all she went through. I wished her goodbye and told her to call me if she needs help with even the smallest thing. The car door closed as it drove off. A few days later, she came back as a different person.

She was super positive all the time, like when I was a kid and the tumor didn't exist. She made breakfast, she was active, and seemed to have her pain under control. We went to an scan the next day and the tumor was gone. She spinal cord was still slightly damaged but she could (after a few weeks of physical therapy) resume full mobility.

Now this was great, the doctors had called it a medical miracle, and I didn't leave her side for two weeks. She made me breakfast 2 days ago and gave me a huge grin. I looked at her face admiring her radiant, glowing smile. Her hazel eyes, cinnamon hair, and her 3 freckles. Wait, 3 freckles? I recounted, 1, 2, 3. Where are the other two? My mom has always had 5. And that was just the first thing I noticed. Every night my mom would write me notes on the counter for me to see when I woke up for school. I hadn't seen one over the past month. I know it's petty, but, ever since my sudden sentience at the age of 3 I saw those notes. I was embarassed by those notes. I missed those notes.

And the biggest thing that bothered me was her smell. She always had a scent of cedar wood and lavender. Now she, doesn't have a smell. She smells sterilized, like there is no sign of humanity within her. There is something living in my mother's body but it isn't my mom. My mom is somewhere, I hope, not completely lost. When I left the house to go she gave me a kiss and told be to be safe. There was this glint in her eye. She knows I know. I don't feel safe and I don't have anyone to call. I'm posting this here before I go home hoping that people may give some advice. If I went to the police they'd call me crazy, then she'd find out. I just want to know what to do, if I live long enough.
