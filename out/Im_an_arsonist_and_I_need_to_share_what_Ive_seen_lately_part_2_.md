I’m freaking the fuck out right now. Ever since my first encounter with those shadows or demons or whatever the fuck I saw that night I’ve been having nightmares that wake me up in a cold sweat. My life has been a shit show ever since my encounter with them. I can’t shake the feeling that I had the night when I saw all three of them staring into my soul. I’ve been hunkered down in this motel consuming more Xanax and Percocet to sedate a horse just to have a momentary escape from this. 

The nightmares. Don’t get my started on the nightmares. I fall asleep and then find myself in a whole different realm. 

Last night I fell asleep passed out drunk and on xans when I ended up in a completely different reality then our own if that my best way to describe it. 

I was in a dark room with a swinging light tied to a chair. I struggled trying to break the straps that held me down when I heard foot steps starting to grow closer and closer. As the figure of a man approached me I stopped struggling. Bracing for whatever was coming my way. 

The figure getting closer and closer to me stopped just outside of the dim light that was provided by the swinging light that hung right in front of me. When he stopped walking towards me all I could see was the cardigan sweater, dress pants, Rolex watch, and dress shoes he was wearing. His face was still covered in the darkness that the light refused to cover. If only that swinging light was a couple feet higher I would be able to see this monster. He stood there still as could be for a few minutes until he spoke for the first time 

“Jackson.”

“WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT!”

“To talk is all.”

“FUCK OFF! LET ME GO! WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS!”

“You will learn soon just be patient”

“FUCK YOU! I WILL KILL EVERYONE OF YOU PRICKS!”

“I doubt you will be able to do that Jackson.” 

“FUCK YOU LET ME GO!”

“I can’t do that Jackson.”

“WHERE AM I! WHAT IS THIS! LET ME GO RIGHT THE FUCK NOW!”

“You have a lot to learn Jackson. I will say that there is something special about you. You are resilient, calculating, and willing”

“I swear to god show yourself before I fucking break out of this chair and BEAT THE FU….”

“You can’t do that Jackson. You know you can’t.”

I slump down into my chair. Half excepting that this person i can only see from the torso down is most likely correct.

“You are so talented. It’ truely a shame that you waste such a talent on such terrible activities”

“Fuck off I don’t care about a single thing you have to say.” I say in a defeated tone 

“Suit yourself”

I wake up in a cold sweat. Frantically looking around this dark motel room. 

These are the nightmares I have been having almost every night. 

This isn’t a problem for me to be honest. I’ve had many nightmares like this when I was younger. I’m not gonna freak myself out over dumb shit like this when it really doesn’t affect me in my day to day life. 

It’s the morning now. I drag myself out of bed still hungover and forcing myself to get the day started. I take a Luke warm shower, get out and get dressed in the same bum ass clothes I’ve been wearing for the last 3 days. 

As I leave I put the “do not disturb” sign on the door handle outside. I don’t need these cleaners coming in to clean the room and finding my stash and taking it. I’m smarter than that trust me. 

When I leave I do my usual routine which consists of going to the liquor store, picking up some bars from my plug in a city over from mine, taking 2 2mg hulks and going to the bar. This isn’t a great way of living. Obviously I’ve not made the best life choices  but I’m not going to let a bunch of random fucks in the comments tell me how to live. 

As I usually do I stumble out of the bar around closing time and hop in my car for the drunkin ride back. There’s not a lot of other cars around the 2am around my parts so I get a peaceful drive home almost every time. It gives me a lot of time to reflect on things which may be for better or worse depending on who you ask. 

As I come flying into the parking lot just thankful I didn’t crash I take up two parking spots and stumble towards the door to my room. As I’m grabbing the key card to my room one of the workers calls out to me.

“Yo my man”

“What’s good”

“Hey you’re Jackson *********** right”

“Yeah why?”

“Some guy left a letter for you at the main office. Lemme go grab it real quick. We were going to give it to you in the morning but as long as I here I might aswell give it to you” 
 
He walks away leaving his carts of towels and cleaning sprays behind as he walks to the main lobby. 

I light a cigarette and look up at the night sky while I’m waiting for this guy to come back. You can see a lot of things out in the sky at night especially around here where it’s not too polluted but I’ve definitely seen better.

The cleaner comes walking back and tells me that a guy dressed in a black suit dropped this off this envelope in the afternoon and asked to give to me. 

“That’s weird what do you mean he just left this?” I’ve never gotten mail or a letter especially when staying a a motel.

“Hey man I don’t know I was just told to give it to you” 

“Alright thanks.” The worker walks away from me as I take a look at the sealed envelope that says “to my protege” covered with some drawn rose flowers around the words. I tear open the envelope and take out the card inside of it. It’s a get well soon card with a dog that has an ice pack on its head and a thermometer in its mouth on the cover. When I open the card it has 2 words written all over the inside. 

“Suit yourself.”
