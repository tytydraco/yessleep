I’m a remote worker from the Philippines. Quiet, efficient, unproblematic.

I’ve worked in tech support, admin, and client success roles for years—and I’ve always been the kind of person who just… gets things done. No drama. No attitude.

Then Paisleigh showed up. Paisleigh, with an *eigh*, because of course.

She wore pink. *All* pink. Hair clips, scrunchies, neon sweaters, platform crocs. Her Slack profile picture was a Barbie selfie with a motivational quote that said something like, *“Our teamwork makes the dream work 💕👑💅🏼✨”* right before she threw me under the bus in every meeting.

She screamed at me. For fun.

“I already told Aida to do it! Did she not READ the thread? Ugh, whatever.”

“Aida, babe, are you gonna invoice the client or just nap all day in your time zone?”

“Mister CEO Sir, I really *tried* to work with her but like… she doesn’t communicate? I’m literally begging.”

And Mister CEO Sir would nod. Of course. Because Paisleigh wasn’t just loud. She was *sleeping* with him. They're both married. Scandalous, right? Well, everyone with half a head knew they were doing it in the office and sending each other really dirty messages and pics on Slack. That's why she likes wearing a zipped up hoodie because apparently Mister CEO Sir likes her boobs. 

So when the client files were wrong (which she edited), it was *my* fault. When the delivery was late (because she forgot to reply), *my* delay. When the client complained? “Aida needs more training. Or like… a LinkedIn course or something.”

I smiled.

But deep down, I called on the old ways.

Because I’m not just Aida, their token diversity hire. I’m Aida, daughter of Albina, granddaughter of Rosalina. I was raised by a *mambabarang,* a healer when she wants to be, a curse-weaver when she must. I know the jars. I know the roots. I know what names sound like when insects carry them in the dark.

So I found Paisleigh’s. (I didn’t even need a strand of hair, just her Slack name and a screenshot of her digital tantrum.)

First came the sniffles.  
“Omggg I think I’m sick but it’s sooo annoying like I’m not even sneezing, it’s just like... leaking??”

It wasn’t a cold.  
It was cerebrospinal fluid.  
A slow, steady leak from somewhere deep in her skull. But doctors couldn’t find the cause. CT scan? Normal. MRI? Clear. Still, the leak wouldn’t stop.

Next, she lost her voice. Not hoarse. Not sore. Just… gone.

She opened her mouth during a team call to blame me again, and all we heard was a *wheeze*.

She tried again, this time typing in the chat.  
But her keyboard kept glitching. Her trackpad lagged. Her screen flickered.

She blamed her laptop. Then her Wi-Fi. Then me.

But her Slack history told its own story. And someone, *not me, of course,* forwarded those chat logs to the client and HR.

Mister CEO Sir? Quietly “transitioned out.”  
Paisleigh? Put on “personal leave.”  
And then, after one last late-night Zoom where she tried to whisper, *“Aida, what did you do?”,* she vanished.

She left the workspace. Her Slack went gray. Her Barbie quote profile? Deleted.

I still work here. Quiet, consistent, helpful.

No one yells at me anymore.  
No one forgets to cc me.  
No one calls me “babe” unless they want to cough uncontrollably during QBRs.

If another drama princess shows up in head-to-toe pink?

I won’t say a word.

But I’ll light a candle.  
I’ll whisper their name.  
And let the shadows carry it.

Because we mambabarangs? We’re still here.

Even in remote work.

Even on Slack.

Sometimes, even in pink.
