You weren't going to do it. You were never going to do it. You simply couldn't because you had a kindness in you that would never let you commit the cruelty that I can do. That's why I spoke for you in front of the councilors, in front of your superiors, and told them exactly what had transpired and what led to it. I told them exactly who to blame and yet in your kindness you made excuses for the guilty. You obfuscated for them. And you protected them in their folly and grave error.

What purpose did that serve? What did it lead to, Vivian?

It lead to the destruction of half the world and the other half waiting to die as the wave of unholy abominations made it's home in our world.

How many people had to get their souls torn apart, quite literally, for you to realize that Coltrane, Haverson, Himika, and Verpelis were the four horseman of the apocalypse?

But i'm only getting ahead of myself.

To cut a long story short, man played God and didn't win. The consequences meant the extinction of every living thing on earth. There's no denying it anymore. This is our extinction event. Not just of mankind, but even the animals and flora. They've become twisted nightmares of their selves that if they aren't prey become the predators that assimilated them.

But to understand a little better, monsters always existed. Not just the human variety in all it's frailty and sadism. There's been stories and legends of them going back before Jesus walked the earth. And it was our research team that was tasked with exploring the reality of these creatures. Or should I say demons? Since that's what they really are. Misbegotten miscreations that escaped from Hell and somehow found the ability to walk this earth without punishment from the Kingdom of the Lord. Anyways, after we learned what they really were, Coltrane, Haverson, Himika, and Verpelis had formed a secret pack in that they could create a cage for the Devil and control the ruler of the underworld.

Their reasoning was that if they could do this, it would prove that man was superior to both God and the afterlife. That we could conquer this world and the beyond on all it's fronts and that we maybe even able to conquer death and become immortal. That was what they confessed to before they were publicly tortured to death. It wasn't a simple execution, we were beyond humane standards now. Our world was dying. People lost so many loved ones and families. Cities, towns, and villages were being destroyed and recreated in a hellish mirror of what they once were. And the air was becoming thin and stale thanks to the assimilation of the flora. That certainly wasn't the worse of it, these things called demons were moving fast. Incredibly fast. It had only been one month since the four horsemen of the apocalypse opened the gates to Hell, that the world fell as it did.

The chaos in the untouched lands made the chaos during the great war of 2071 look infantile. There were suicides. There were riots. Rule of law would have vanished if it wasn't for the competence of the Monarchic Elite, the military arm of our Autocracy. They brought down the swift hand of law better then what was given in the deadly riots of 2020.

I should know, I was under their conscription and assigned as personal security to Vivian's team of researchers for my pertinent ability to infiltrate.

But back to the epitaph on the gravestone of mankind.

I managed to spare Vivian from a fate worse then death, for now at least, as I fabricated evidence to her presumed innocence. I spared her from death but she was tarred and feathered and forced to walk through the crowds, so to speak. Everything about her was released to what was left of the populace, her home, what was left of her family, what town she lived in, the works. And so the Monarchic Elite decided that the public could do what they wished against her.

I saved her because I loved her with all my heart and soul and wished to God Almighty that she had chosen otherwise. But wishing isn't going to change a motherfucking thing, is it? It's already done and over with and there's no going back now. We can only decide what course of action we take to advance the path forward...or stand still in an eternal moment of despair.

Even though we all know this is the end, many of the Monarchic Elite have chosen not to abandon their posts, their statures, or even their allegiance to our grand leader. Maybe it was because they trained with the utmost brutality so as to harden their character. Or maybe it was because they had an unshakeable faith in what was in the beyond that rule mattered, that character mattered, that what you do, no matter how insignificant it was, echoed across a vast plane of existence that determined everything.

As of this moment, the Monarchic Elite are still putting up a voracious fight against these demons trying to kill and rebuild our world in their unholy image.

As of this moment, our grand leader is personally heading the offensive against the evil threatening to blunt out God's flicker of life.

I feel honored to have lived under such a courageous regime that never shirked the nobility of having to face evil on all it's fronts. Strong, proud, unflinching, determined. I only wish I could go out the same way. But I know i'll have my body assimilated into their unholy works and i'll spend an eternity in Hell if they don't rip my soul apart first. I know it may happen to all of us.

The thought of killing Vivian and sending her to the Kingdom has crossed my mind so many fucking times it's hard to even think clearly.

But that's what I did.

And that's what I did to the rest of my loved ones.

I made it quick and painless, at least I hope it was. I could say i'm happy they're safe now from this shit. But all I feel is an empty hollowness in my chest where my heart use to be and it's threatening to take my whole body over. I don't deserve the grace of what they're having now but I do deserve the honor of going out and taking as many of these demons with me.

This world is worth fighting for. These people are worth sacrificing everything for. This is our world. This is our moment in history where we decided to we won't go out with a whimper but with a fucking bang that will ripple across time itself.

I know I won't be going to the Kingdom, but at least you will and you will know the kind of happiness and peace that you deserve that I could only give so much of on this earth.

For the future. For the soul of the human race. For a chance of survival at all costs.

This fight is not over yet. Not for me. Not ever
