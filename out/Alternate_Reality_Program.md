  I was stunned sitting there on my couch at 3 am in the morning. I was having one of those many restless nights so I turned on the t.v and to my surprise there on the screen was a new channel. 


  ARP - Alternative Reality Program


 What the hell? Where did this come from? Usually there are only TNT and TBS. (The ones I usually watch). Now sitting smack dab in the middle was this. ARP. 


 For the programs that are listed it just has one show. Your life. Confusing title but it grabs your attention. As for the new channel I thought it was just that. A new channel. One that I will probably receive a email on it later.


 I clicked on the program then I heard a door creak in one of the rooms upstairs. I thought nothing of it. Just thinking that it was just a coincidence. I watched the new program with the new show and was opened up with a memory that I knew real well. 


 What the hell? I thought as a memory plays of me as a young boy swinging. How is this possible? I hear myself laugh as my father pushed me up and down. 


 How is this possible? This is my memory! I grab the remote to change the channel not before something metal hit the upside of my head. Immediately I went down while not getting a look at the person who done it. 


 I hear footsteps along with the ringing in my ears as the perpetrator rummaged through my house and went out the front door. He must have left it open. It is getting chilly in here. I try to get up for help but everytime I move I make a noise because of the pain. A line of blood going down my forehead. 


 I'm going to die here! I thought. I'm going to die at the exact time no one is moving around outside unless they are a restless sleeper like me. The only direction my head was looking towards was the t.v. that somehow was playing my memory of that day on the swings at the old park. 


 Then the program changed to another one of my memories. This time to me at my first dance. I was dancing with Shirley Templeson. Something is wrong here though. I looked happy there but I didn't really looked happy at that dance. Whenever I asked her to go with me she laughed and all her friends laughed with her as I hung my down the hallway.


 Yeah, that's what happened. The whole time at the dance I was just sitting there with my friends watching all the couples move around. Is this thing showing me what could have happened? 


 I heard of people saying that before you die you are shown your whole life over again. Maybe this is the other way around. I'm being shown what could have happened had my choices been different. Unless other people were also shown this and they want to make the last few seconds before death seem like a happy one to console people. 


 I mean I would. I wouldn't tell my future kids if I have any at all when I turn 40 that death just shows you if the choices you made were the right ones. I am then shown another memory or another alternate choice, of me with my not dead dad getting out of the hospital with all our friends cheering. 


 This one made me tear up a bit. I was 19 when my dad died of cancer. I wanted him to pull out of it. It was because I loved him but it was also because I wouldn't have anyone left since my mother died while giving birth to me. 


 But that never happen did it George? Your father died with a smile as you cried your tears flying onto his cold hands. Since then I've had to make do on my own the way I know how. My dad didn't leave me woth nothing to prepare myself for. He left me our house and a stable job at advance auto. 


 I was glad of him for it. I stayed there and helped people. It was where i met my now girlfriend Carrie. Carrie! I think. If i died now i would be doing what i did with dad to her! I need to pull through for her! 


 I then try to move again as more memories played out on the t.v. My hand it moved! I try to pull my hand onto the armleg of the chair. I was able to pull myself up on it with more blood going down. I'm losing a lot. I then grab my phone on the nightstand. 


 I call 911 and told the dispatcher that someone broke into my house and that he hit me. The way i was actually saying it was one word was missing for every third word. It actually went like this. Some broke into house got head. She must've known I was in distress so she sent the cops. 


 After I was taken to the hospital and me and Carrie were laughing together that I was ok. I went and asked the cops if there was anything out of the ordinary in my house. They said when they came in they saw the blood splatter on the walls and the metal pipe on the porch. My heart froze when they told me that the t.v was just blank when I asked them if it was still on when they found me.
