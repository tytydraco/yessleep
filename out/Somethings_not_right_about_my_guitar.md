I brought this guitar in may, just your standard Fender Telecaster. Wasn't my first guitar, just something to mess around and modify, everything seemed like normal, until about 3 weeks after I brought it. I have this feeling that someone's watching me at all times, even though I live completely alone. I've checked around my entire house, sleep with a 9mm under my pillow, but I've never seen anyone. I'll hear footsteps in my apartment, check with the gun and no one nor anything is around. 

Then I noticed there were claw marks in the carpet around the guitar. I don't own any pets, and never have friends around, I'm too busy to have a social life. Then claw marks started to appear around my room, one on the wall, one on my door. 

I decided to set a camera and tripod up and stay in a local hotel the night. The next day I went back to see my apartment had claw marks all over it. My furniture had moved, my kitchen sink was dented inwards, the camera had fallen over, and the tripods aluminum legs were bent in all sorts of directions. I check the camera footage, which showed seemingly nothing happening, until a split second of static at 10:52:43, then the apartment was in the state I found it. The time on the camera was continuing as normal. 10:52:43 (static)  10:52:44, 10:52:45. Everything happened at the same time. I asked my neighbors if they had heard anything strange. None of them said they heard anything happen at any point. 

I call the police, who 'looked into it'. One officer tells me it's possible someone broke in and smashed my stuff up, but there was no signs of a break in. The only thing in my apartment that wasn't damaged nor moved was the guitar I brought in may. All my other guitars had strings broken, scratches on the body, my prized Ibanez was on the floor, strings gone completely. 

I moved out of that place, moved into a new place in a different town completely. I had peace for 1 week. I'm scared for my life now. 

I can hear voices in the middle of the day, from seemingly that telecaster. I thought at first it was just the neighbors doing their thing. Then I started to hear unintelligible whispers at random times of the day. Then I started to get the nightmares. Oh good God. Nightmares of horrific things. I saw myself burn, I felt the pain, felt my skin melting, smelled the smell of burning human flesh, felt my strength deteriorating as my muscles were burning off. 

The worst one yet felt like a bad acid trip. My 'son' (I don't have any children, not even a girlfriend) and I were at a campsite, and for some reason I kept repeating to him 'before you go to sleep, make sure it's not under your pillow'. Fuck knows what it could have been, but later that dream we were walking along some local park, and we saw a guy playing a little gig, with a Fender Telecaster, just like the one on my wall. A few moments later me and my son are walking through the town. Next thing I know he's just been hit by a van, the driver of the van was wearing a Fender Telecaster t shirt. 

I woke up in a cold sweat, to see the telecaster had blood on the fretboard and strings. 

I tried to sell it, to pawn shops, facebook market, ebay, craigslist, no one wanted it. Hell the charity shop didn't even want it for free. I tried leaving it on the street somewhere, so someone finds it and gets better joy out of it, I even stuck a little note on the guitar saying 'take me for free, my previous owner doesn't want me anymore and doesn't want money for me'. I went back to my apartment to see the guitar right where it would have been, drenched in vomit, blood and smelling of blood and piss. 

I woke up this morning with a message cut into my forearm 'i know everything, I see everything, I hear everything. You are no longer safe'. 

Help me....
