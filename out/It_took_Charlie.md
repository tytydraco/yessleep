Me, Charlie Baker, and Marcus Kennedy sat by the campfire with our cub scout troop. Three best friends all enjoying each other's company. Charlie was in the middle of one of his infamous scary stories. He was always the best storyteller. Everyone would joke that one day he would become an author or something. Gosh if only that were true. If only he’d just made it past that night. 

Charlie reached the climax of his story, and we all screamed as the character of the story was attacked by the axe-wielding goat-headed man. Then it ended and our screams of terror turned into affirmations and applause. As usual, it was a great story.

The others started to tell their scary stories. Marcus told a story about a hook-handed man nailing people to their front doors. Another scout told a story about a werewolf stalking a family on the night of the full moon, but none of them matched. None of them reached the terrifying levels of Charlie’s stories. We’d always wondered about his secret, how he’d gotten so good, but he always told us it just came naturally to him. We didn’t believe that, but it was mostly because we still hoped we’d be as good as him one day.

After a long while of sitting by the fire, I noticed Charlie slip away from the fire exclaiming that he was tired. Not much longer later I agreed with that sentiment and retreated to our tent. It was quite a distance away from the other tents. I was still warm from the fire and pulled myself into my sleeping bag next to Charlie in an instant, I was out. My sleep was good, long, peaceful; that is how it should have been all night, but it was interrupted. 

That night I experienced something that has haunted me to this very day. It started with me sitting up in the tent next to Charlie. I was hearing things outside the tent. Strange grunts and what I can only describe as barking purrs. They were odd. I can’t really describe it but they almost had a bird-like quality to them. Along with the strange noises were heavy, heavy footsteps in the leaves. With each footstep I slowly began to realize how big the thing must be. I looked around every which way worried about what could be outside. Bracing myself I put one hand against the nylon wall only to feel something press against it on the other side. I wanted to scream but I couldn't, my body seemingly in such a state of shock wouldn’t let me move. 

The sounds the creature was making shifted. The barking purr like sounds slowly shifted into this low droning growl. I shook so violently I thought I might pass out. I’d never heard anything like it. There was absolutely nothing to compare it to. With this new sound came a new horrible, overwhelming feeling.

Dread.

That was the feeling that came over me. It was so incredibly all-encompassing that I couldn’t move. It was so immense that it felt like I was being suffocated by the emotion, but I don’t even know how that’s possible. It felt like I was drowning. Like one of those nightmares when you’re in a car slowly sinking deeper and deeper into the ocean. You know there is nothing you can do to escape so you just sit there and shake and shake dreading your inevitable death. That was the feeling that came over me in that tent. Then another sensation hit me. It wasn’t a feeling, it was something much worse, something much more physical.

The Smell. 

The putrid smell of the thing almost made me want to puke. It smelled like a massive dumpster of burning trash, but there was something else there too. The horrible smell of something dead, something rotting and dead. It smelled like how I’d always thought a skunk would smell. A wet, dead, and horrible smell that just makes you not want to smell anything ever again. I wanted to cover my mouth but I was so afraid I just sat there drowning in the fear and the horrible smell.

I listened to heavy footsteps patrolling around the tent. They rustled the dry leaves and broke branches. It kept going in concentric circles that slowly seemed to close in on the tent. Suddenly I began to regret putting our tent so far from the others. That afternoon I’d convinced Charlie to help me move it far from the others. We both liked to go to sleep early and hated being kept up by the other scout’s endless chatter.

It was getting closer. Its heavy steps grew louder and louder. I imagined the thing growing larger and larger, seeming to feed off my fear. I shook and shook, I wanted to be anywhere but here. I wanted to escape, to see my mom, my dad, my brothers, anyone and anywhere but here.

Then I heard things begin to drag against the nylon of our tent. It sounded scratchy and weird. It sounded similar to nails on a chalkboard mixed with the sound of dragging your nails on a piece of nylon. The noise of the dragging on the nylon was so shrill it stung my ears but I was so frozen with dread and fear I could do nothing. I didn’t reach to cover them afraid somehow it would know I’d moved. I felt weak. I wanted to do something, to move, to scream, but my petrified body refused. I felt lightheaded and sick in the stomach, the smell, the sound, the fear, it all felt so overwhelming. 

It lasted hours. The whole time I felt I was on the edge of puking, or screaming, but I could do nothing but sit there and listen. At some point, a light drizzle began. At first I hoped that it might drown out the horrible sounds, that it might protect me from the unknown I so desperately did not want to face. But it just added to this cacophony of horror and terror. I felt like I was on my breaking point.

I still sat there absolutely petrified. My eyes followed the footsteps as they slowly made their way around the tent. Each heavy thump sent a shiver down my spine reminding me of the immense size and power of whatever horrible thing was out there. That's when I heard it, the sound of ripping nylon. I looked to see something cutting through the tent wall along the zipper. Or I don’t know if cutting would be the right word, it was more like an exact rip than a cut. I looked to see what it was, but it was far too dark. I watched the dark shape slowly rip further and further down until there was a gash from the top to the bottom of the tent. I shook so violently that I had to assume the thing or person knew I was there.

Once the large gash had been made something dark started to make its way into the tent. I looked but the smell intensified as it approached the tent. The smell was so bad my eyes watered up. It was such a thick overpowering smell that it was choking me. I felt like I could taste it and it was horrendous.

I endured through the pain of my teary eyes and looked once more, and I saw it begin to come inside. It was very long and very hairy. From the small amount I could see it looked to be a limb. It reached into the tent seemingly being careful not to let any more of its body in. Its limb, its arm slinked further and further in and I almost wanted to puke. That thing, that arm was way too big, way too long. It could reach from the door to me without even putting its shoulder into the tent. It felt so uncanny and wrong, it looked like something you might see in a night terror, but the worst part was it was real. 

It seemed to reach around the tent seemingly trying to find what was inside. Then its arm bruId against my backpack which lay on the floor next to me. It grabbed hold with what seemed to be freakishly long fingers, before slowly and eerily dragging the bag out of the tent.

My fear didn’t die but gradually lessened knowing it was only here for that. The thing just wanted the bag. As it slowly lifted the backpack it struggled. The large bag hardly fit through the hole. Little pieces and parts of it kept getting caught as the thing tried to yank it through. The still omnipresent droning call was interrupted with a growl followed by a loud rip. The bag disappeared through the now significantly larger hole. 

The hole flapped opened and closed with the light breeze, and I could make out the massive dark shape of the creature. I looked away horrified at the size of the thing.

Silence, for a split second. 

I listened to the thing as it rustled around with the bag letting out slight grunts that sounded frustrated. It fiddled with the bag for an amount of time I can’t determine before it let out one especially loud grunt before a loud ripping sound, and then a clatter of the contents of my bag falling to the ground. I recognized all the different sounds. The thunk of my water bottle, the thump of my clothes, the crash of my utensils, and the crinkling crunch of a bag of chips. It fiddled around with the objects. Crack! The sound of it shattering something made me jump internally. I was still so scared of this thing. Up to this point it hadn’t actually shown any aggression. It had seemingly just been curious, but the mere thought of it breaking something changed that idea. I prayed in my head that this thing would just go away. I just wanted to go back to my peaceful sleep. I didn’t care if it took my things, or whatever. As long as it didn’t hurt me I didn’t care.

I listened to the shrill noise of a plastic bag of chips being torn open. Heavy sniffing followed, and I could vaguely hear the crunching of the thing eating a chip. It ate all the other chips as slowly as it had eaten the first. It seemed to be enjoying them taking its time with each individual delicacy. Once it was done I felt through the ground its weight shift back toward the tent. My heart started thundering like I was in a marathon. That temporary relief had been destroyed in a mere instant.

That horrible call began once again and all the fear returned in a full overwhelming force. Unable to move still I watched helplessly as the arm forced its way back through the hole. I felt its long wet finger briefly brush against my sleeping bag. They were so long. They reminded me of gnarled branches or the long legs of some spider thing. The fingers seemed to examine the bag for a second before pulling it. My life flashed before my eyes. Me a ten year old boy had to consider that I might be about to die. That something that shouldn’t exist was about to drag me out and kill me. I shifted slightly, petrified imagining it pulling me out and eating me whole. It let go of my bag. I closed my eyes in relief praying it would just leave, but the arm slowly drifted over to the other sleeping bag.

Charlie.

I’d been so terrified I didn’t even think about him. So occupied with my own well being that I hadn’t thought of my best friend. 

He lay next to me, still sleeping soundly with a slight grin on his face. I wanted to do something and say something, but I could do nothing but stare as the thing began to grab at the end of his sleeping bag. Charlie didn’t shake, move, or even react. Time seemed to freeze as its hand glided to the end of Charlie’s bag. It seemed to caress the bag for a moment before it gave his bag a yank. I felt his weight shift about within the confines of the tent. I can’t explain, though Charlie seemed to satisfy it better.

It got a tight grip on the bag and began pulling the bag and him out of the tent. It was prolonged as he was slowly pulled out one inch at a time. His eyes opened wide and without moving his head he looked toward the hand. His face flaId with terror but like me, he just froze in fear, as it slowly pulled him outside. His fear only seemed to grow when the end of the sleeping bag disappeared beyond the rip in the tent. Gradually more and more were pulled out. I shook as one of my best friends disappeared through a hole in the tent's wall. Just before he fully disappeared through the hole his eyes met mine, they were terrified and seemed to plead for help, for someone to save him from this horrible fate, but there was no one.

Once he was completely pulled out I heard shuffling and fabric ripping as the sleeping bag was shredded. I imagined some giant with long fingernails clawing away at the sleeping bag trying to get to my friend. Then the ripping sound stopped and I heard a slight thump through the pitter-patter of the rain. Then the sleeping bag was thrown into the puddle with a splash sounding much lighter now. It was then I realized that it had ripped him out of the bag and was now taking him away. I heard heavy footsteps grow fainter and fainter before fading. Once the footsteps couldn’t be heard the sound stopped, that horrible droning sound finally stopped. 

Sobs and cries escaped my mouth which quickly turned to agonized screams. I cried out words and phrases. I can’t tell you what I said. I was in such a panic it was just a word salad of pure panicked thoughts and sounds. I think I may have said “monster” or “Charlie” but I can’t say for sure.

I heard the yelps and screams of the other scouts in reaction to my own. I shook in the corner of my tent, as I heard my leader make his way over to the tent. I heard the thunks of his boots until they stopped. He hadn’t reached my tent yet so I couldn’t comprehend why he’d stopped walking. Then he gasped, the thinking turned to slam as he sprinted the rest of the way over and peeked inside the tent calling our names. He saw me alone and shaking, too traumatized to even speak, besides a single phrase: “Ch- Charlie, it took Charlie.”
