Hello everyone. Before anything else: I’m not a writer, nor a ghost hunter, nor anything like that. I’m just a guy trying to understand what happened last week. Maybe by putting this here I can sleep a bit better when night comes.

To begin with, I’m a freelance translator. My specialty is old documents like contracts, wills, parish records, etc. It’s a very specific job, as you can imagine, but it pays well. With that in mind, I nearly fell over when I saw how much my client was willing to pay me (not to mention covering lodging and transport) to review some 18th-century papers, written in archaic German, probably land titles, which needed to be deciphered urgently. The place: a tiny village tucked away in the Alps called “Steinwald.”

I accepted immediately. Good money, a chance to see a different place, and maybe even go skiing a bit and drink some hot chocolate. Naive, right?

I took a packed train to a bigger city and then a tiny bus that climbed up the frozen, winding mountain roads. I arrived in Steinwald at night, the driver dropped me off in an empty square and left without even turning off the engine. I found it odd, but the cold didn’t let me think too much about it, so I made sure to find the inn where I’d be staying. I walked along the quiet cobblestone streets, hardly a soul in sight, a comforting peace emanating from the dark night, the dense forest, and the mountain air surrounding me. I stopped in front of the small guesthouse, the words “Rooms Available” scribbled in red marker on a small wooden sign, in a few of the region’s common languages.

I stepped inside and was immediately flooded by the warmth of the house. The smell of eucalyptus crackling in the fireplace filled my nose and my spirit. The lady behind the counter smiled when she saw me, her green eyes blending with the yellowish reflection of the lights.

“Hello dear!” she said kindly. “You must be Maxwell, right?”

“Yes, that’s me,” I replied.

“Very good! I’ve been expecting you,” she rummaged through some things as I walked closer. “Here’s the key to your room, it’s number 23, second floor.”

I was about to go upstairs when she let out a surprised sigh, as if remembering something important.

“Wait!” she shouted. “Wait!”

I looked at her in surprise.

“Here, read this, please!”

She handed me a paper printed on what I assume was a mimeograph, some kind of local press. I just nodded as I went upstairs, making a mental note to read it before going to bed. I entered the small room, a cozy little shelter, indeed. The window looked out onto the town square, its flickering lamp posts in the snow contrasting with the darkness of the night sky and its twinkling lights.

I sat on the edge of the bed, the mattress creaking under my weight. My body was sore and exhausted from the trip. The bundle of papers I was supposed to translate was already sitting on a desk in the opposite corner, and I stared at it thinking, “I’ll start tomorrow.” Then I remembered the paper the lady had given me, letting the yellow lamp light illuminate the slightly smudged letters.

It was a notice, an obituary. Pretty common in small towns like this. Apparently, an important member of the community had died, his name was Hermann Blatzer, “father of many here,” according to the text. The name sounded familiar. I racked my brain trying to remember until I looked at the desk again. Of course, it made sense, he was the owner of those deeds. I turned the page after a brief biography about his role in founding Steinwald. At the top of this second page, written in stylized Gothic letters:

“INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE AWAKENING OF THE DECEASED”

What? I read the rest:

1. Attend the hall before the first chant and do not leave until the final bell.
2. Touch the body with your right hand, three times, in silence.
3. Do not laugh (too) loudly.
4. If he calls your name, do not answer.
5. When leaving, do not look back, no matter what you hear.

I stared at that for a good few minutes. My German is good, but I confess I read it two or three times to be sure of what I was reading.

I sighed, left the paper on the nightstand and threw myself onto the bed. I figured it must be some strange local custom, a folkloric ritual of sorts. You’d be surprised how weird country folks can be. Maybe they did it to say goodbye with humor, or to ease the weight of death. Soon, exhaustion overcame me and I fell asleep, with the wind brushing the window to lull me.

I was woken up hours later by a persistent sound at the door. Three sharp knocks. I looked at the clock: 11:45 p.m. I got up, staggering, groggy with sleep, wondering what it could be, but then I remembered the leaflet, and a different kind of chill ran down my spine. It wasn’t the mountain cold, but something more primal, what Rudolf Otto might have called the *tremendum*.

I got up slowly, the cold floor freezing my feet. I put on my thick socks and opened the door. On the other side was the same lady from the reception, now wrapped in a dark green shawl. Her smile seemed a bit more… tense.

“Come, my dear. We’re about to begin,” she said in an almost conspiratorial whisper as she handed me a heavy fur coat.

I sort of understood her. I went downstairs. Outside, the village was bathed in torchlight, the flames fixed to iron holders stuck in the snow. Small groups of about five people each walked silently toward a community hall, a stone building with long windows, from which an orange glow spilled out. The wind carried sparks to where I stood, cutting into the skin of my cheeks.

The lady led me to the entrance. A huge man, dressed in a dark fur coat like mine, greeted me with a restrained nod and opened the door.

Inside, I caught a strong smell of burning wax and rosemary. The hall was packed. Men and women sat scattered on long benches, murmuring to each other. Children ran back and forth, but always in circles, never passing close to the center of the hall where, on top of an oak table, lay the body of Hermann Blatzer.

They had dressed the corpse in a white robe that reached his feet, adorned with small red ribbons on the sleeves and collar. His face, instead of stiff and colorless, looked strangely more relaxed, almost serene. His hands were uncrossed, palms facing up, as if waiting for something.

A chorus of female voices began to chant a simple, repetitive melody, almost childlike. The lady who had brought me nudged my arm, discreetly pointing to the body. I knew what I had to do; it was on the list.

I took a deep breath, walked up to the corpse. My right hand felt like lead, but I stretched it out anyway and touched his cold chest. Three times. The fabric was rough, damp in some spots, maybe from the moisture in the room or… I didn’t want to think too much about it, I was already scared enough to feed my mind’s paranoia.

I backed away quickly, feeling my face flush, maybe from shame or fear. I sat down on a bench further away, trying to look indifferent, like a mere spectator of local traditions, a stranger politely attending a strange ritual. The women’s voices stopped so abruptly it was almost painful to my ears. A brief silence filled the hall, broken only by the crackling of the giant candles dripping long threads of wax onto the stone floor.

Then, as if someone had given an invisible sign, people began to approach the table, in small groups, sometimes two or three at a time. Each did something different. A young woman leaned over Hermann’s face and whispered something quickly, like a secret. A thin, hunched old man poked the dead man’s belly with two fingers, the almost playful gesture clashing with the strangeness of it all.

Some children were brought by their mothers. I saw a little boy, maybe six years old, pinch the dead man’s bare arm and then recoil, eyes wide, as if he really expected him to react. And, God, I think they did expect it.

A fat, flushed man came up next, his face red and eyes gleaming, maybe from drink. He slapped Hermann’s shoulder hard, almost laughing, and shouted something way too loud for the mood of the room:

“Wake up, you old pig! You’re not going to leave us hanging now, are you?”

There was a brief chorus of muffled laughs, quickly stifled. The fat man stepped back, wiping his hands on his dark tunic while glancing around quickly, maybe checking if he’d gone too far.

Then it was the men’s chorus. Four burly men formed a half-circle in front of the dead man and began to sing a deeper, heavier melody, almost liturgical. Their voices made my chest vibrate slightly. Hermann stayed there, still, but… something felt different. I swear I saw a slight twitch in his fingers.

My heart started pounding. I remembered the leaflet… The paper felt like it weighed a ton in my pocket. I found myself gripping it inside my pocket, like it was a talisman. The rough texture of the mimeographed leaflet anchored me to the present, to the material, while the men’s chant seemed to pull my spirit somewhere cold and hollow.

Hermann remained still, but the fingers… no, I wasn’t losing my mind: they moved. A slight tick, almost imperceptible, like someone dreaming and stirring in bed. No one seemed to notice. Or they chose not to. The men’s chant faded, dying out in a collective sigh. The hall returned to being just the sound of dripping candles and the wind outside.

Then came what disturbed me most.

An old man, with a long white beard split into two thin braids, walked up to Hermann carrying a small bronze bell. He stopped beside the body, lifted the bell high, and rang it three times. The sound was sharper than I expected, too metallic. I couldn’t help but cover my ears.

When the echo finally died out, he stepped even closer to the corpse and said something quietly, so quietly I could only catch one word:

“Zurück…”  
(“Come back…”)

He then closed his eyes and recited what sounded like a short prayer. The whole hall joined in with dragging murmurs. I tried not to move, barely breathing. That’s when I felt a sudden twinge deep in my gut, like something had lightly tugged me from the inside.

I opened my eyes (which I didn’t even remember closing) and saw that Hermann’s hands were closing, his fingers curling slowly, tense, as if grasping something invisible. A collective gasp rippled through the room. A woman brought her hands to her mouth, stifling a scream.

Then the dead man’s eyes opened. Not all at once, but peeling open like someone fighting through centuries of dust. First thin slits, then wide open, revealing gray, cloudy pupils that slowly wandered around the hall until they stopped… on me.

I shrank back on the bench, unable to move. Hermann’s mouth opened in a grimace that was almost a smile but twisted, as if he didn’t quite remember how to do it. His thick, purple tongue slipped between his lips, letting out a wet, slurred sound. I was already trembling when, in a hoarse whisper, he said:

“Max…well…”

That was the most primal moment of fear I’ve ever felt. Instinct told me to answer, to say “Yes? What is it?” like an idiot, but panic kept me silent. The list, that damned list, hammered in my head:

“If he calls your name, do not answer.”

Hermann seemed confused for a moment, his head tilted to the side, mouth trembling, until he let out a guttural sound, almost a sob, and started babbling incoherent words. Then, as fast as lightning, he lunged off the table, charging at me. I wanted to scream, to call for help, but my throat was frozen shut.

I could feel his cold touch on me, tearing open the coat and exposing my skin to the hall’s air. He was shouting and shouting like a madman, thick drool dripping onto my face, sending me into a frenzy of terror and disgust.

Honestly, I don’t know how I didn’t just drop dead right there from sheer terror. Hermann’s screams echoed in my head, ringing far closer than I wanted them to. His breath was cold, damp, smelled like something halfway between almonds and mold. I felt rough fingers, hard as roots, clutch my shoulder and dig their nails (or what was left of them) into my skin through the coat.

He shook his head from side to side, foaming and moaning words that made no sense to me. Amid the rush of sounds, I could make out fragments, dragged laments spoken in that tongue too heavy for a dead mouth:

“...Erben… Mein Erbe… nicht… sie haben mich… sie… betrogen…”

I only understood one word clearly, repeated more than once in a whisper so mournful it chilled my bones:

“Erben… Erben…”

Inheritance. Heirs.

At that moment, someone yanked me back violently. I fell on my back, landing hard on a stone and smashing my tailbone. Lights danced before my eyes and pain shot up my spine, making me let out a howl. I saw men holding Hermann down, trying to restrain him, tying ropes around his chest and arms like they were binding an animal. He kept screaming, his wide eyes locked on me, until three others showed up carrying torches.

Someone clapped a rough, heavy hand over my eyes and whispered in my ear in an almost fatherly tone:

“Don’t look at this, Junge… for your soul’s sake, don’t look.”

I was lifted by the armpits and dragged out of the hall. The freezing air slapped my face like a whip. My knees were too weak to hold me up, so I had to steady myself against a wooden post soaked by melting snow. In the distance, I heard Hermann howl, then the muffled sound of something heavy being dragged. And the chanting came back, now even stronger, smothering any other sound from inside.

I don’t know how I got back to the inn. I have flashes of the old lady guiding me by the arm, whispering comforting words that meant nothing to my numb mind. I just know I woke up in my room, the lamp still on, the leaflet crumpled in my sweaty hand. I was trembling so hard I could barely let go of the paper.

The next morning, I left Steinwald on the first bus I could find. No one stopped me. No one said a word. I told my client, and he agreed to let me take a copy of those documents to translate remotely.

It was only days later, already at home, reading those old wills that I realized. In the middle of the moldy paragraphs about land, debts and possessions, I found an addition written in shaky, more recent handwriting. It said something like:

“If any of my children dare betray me, taking for themselves what is not rightfully theirs, may my voice find its way back and demand what is mine. May they be marked by my memory.”

In the list of heirs, there was the name of the firstborn, underlined several times. Just below, a municipal stamp confirmed his death just a few weeks before his father.

But that wasn’t what truly froze my blood. It was seeing the other names on the list: two younger brothers, a son and a youngest daughter, and a distant nephew. All alive, all with registered addresses in Steinwald. As I read them, a cold shiver ran through me… I recognized those names. The innkeeper lady… was Hermann’s daughter. My client, her younger brother.

And then I remembered what Hermann had babbled that night, and now I could fully understand his words as his cloudy eyes locked onto mine, repeating between sobs:

“Sie haben mich… betrogen… meine Kinder… meine Erben…”

“They… betrayed me… my children… my heirs…”

Suddenly, everything made a terrible kind of sense. Maybe it wasn’t just old age that killed Hermann. Maybe that night was the desperate cry of a man betrayed, who saw his own blood turn against him and his firstborn.

I can still feel his touch.

Ever since I understood this, I haven’t slept properly. Sometimes, in the dead of night, I feel a weight at the edge of my bed, like someone is sitting there, watching me. The mattress sinks slightly, but when I turn on the light, there’s nothing there. Just the outline of a damp stain on the sheet.

I don’t know what Hermann wants from me. Maybe for me to bring him justice? I don’t know. I’ve tried to contact my client and the innkeeper lady, but ever since I got paid, neither has responded. I hope that by writing this, by telling others Hermann’s story, his spirit might find the peace it needs — and leave me in peace, once and for all…
