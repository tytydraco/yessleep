# Part 1

Do you ever feel like you never really know somebody? It’s like you know the persona they present whenever they’re around you, but you can just tell it’s not their true self. I hate people like that. And I think that's why I despised my next door neighbor, Rob, when we first met.  

When he moved in, I barely paid him any mind. At the time, I lived in a run down apartment building. This place was nasty. The formerly white, now yellowing walls with peeling wallpaper contrasted nicely with the flickering single light that lit up the hallway. I had no idea the last time anyone had cleaned the hallway floor. Nor did I care.

I was making my way up the winding stairs when the door to my floor suddenly swung open. A young guy in his mid twenties stepped out. He was noticeably different from the usual tenants of the building with his athletic build and the brand new clothes he was wearing, I immediately suspected he was a cop as we’d had our fair share of them going undercover there before. I’d almost been caught by a certain nosy one a few times so I ignored his overly friendly greeting and slipped past him to walk down the dimly lit hallway. 

Right before I reached my door, I noticed the one directly across was propped open with a few boxes laid in the entryway. I groaned slightly as the realization dawned on me. After a fumble with my keys, I managed to slip into my tiny apartment before my new neighbor came back. 

I stumbled toward my bedroom as the all too familiar feeling set back in. Cursing silently, I slipped the small bottle I’d concealed in my jacket onto the night stand. After retrieving the syringe from the drawer, the familiar process continued. I laid back in bed, moaning softly as bliss overtook me.

Despite my best efforts, my nightmares always seemed to find me. I stood up to find myself back in that forest again as a scream pierced the morning silence. My body surged forward despite my protests. I knew what was happening, but I couldn’t stop it. My younger self tore through the woods, desperately yelling, “Dad? Dad!” The screams continued as I ran into a clearing. Far away on the other side, my dad was locked in a struggle with someone. I sprinted towards them and yelled for him again as he collapsed.

When I finally got to him, he was laying on the ground wheezing. I scanned the clearing, catching a glimpse of someone moving into the trees. “Asshole!” was all my child self could think to yell as they slipped away. 

My attention turned back when gurgling sounds erupted from my dad. He was coughing blood and struggling to breathe. “Dad? Daddy?” I cried as my hands wrapped around his, unsure what else to do. He clawed at his shirt, so I helped lift it up to reveal his entire chest had caved in on itself. I fell backwards, my lips trembling as tears began to fall. 

We locked eyes and his mouth opened, “I l-lov,” he gurgled before beginning to choke. A few of the other campers finally arrived as I sat there frozen, still holding his dead gaze. Movement in the trees finally broke my trance as I looked past the frantic campers to lock eyes with a pale face staring back at me. Its glowing eyes engulfed my vision before I frantically shot up in bed, the image of my dingy apartment slowly filling my view. 

Shuddering slightly, I slipped off my sweat drenched shirt and tossed it, knocking over the bottle on my nightstand. I cursed vehemently as I dove to grab it, but most of the contents were already on the floor. I threw the bottle across the room, shattering it against the wall in a whirlwind of curses. 

Seconds after, a knock at the door filled the silence. “Hello? Are you okay in there?’ a voice asked. I groaned as the image of that cop immediately came to mind as I shuffled towards the door, stopping right in front of it as I slipped on a sweatshirt. 

“I'm fine. Just dropped a bottle,” I slurred through the door.

“It sounded pretty bad, I can help you,” the voice responded.

I rubbed my temple as a headache began to form, “No, I’m fine. Really.”

The doorknob jiggled slightly as the voice insisted, “Let me help you. I can help you.”

“The hell?” I mumbled. “I said I’m fine.”

The door banged loudly as the voice began to grow more gravely, causing me to jump back, “Let us in. I can help you. Let me in. Let me in!”

“Screw off asshole!” I shouted, “I’m calling the cops!” I lied as I backed up to my small kitchenette and grabbed a knife. 

The shitty door groaned as the person slammed against it, giving way after the third attempt. I let out a shriek as it fell to the ground, revealing what looked to be a guy in a tattered hoodie standing in the doorway. 

“What the fuck? Who are you,” I cried as the knife shook in my hands. I tried to steady myself, brandishing it at them. 

“Help…..you,” the man gargled as he stepped into the apartment. Sweat and tears poured down my face as he approached. Paralyzed with fear, I shut my eyes tight. I could feel him standing right in front of me as I braced for whatever plans he had in store for me. 

Rough, coarse hands clasped mine as he knocked the knife away. I whimpered, cowering in fear and refusing to open my eyes. Fear became confusion as the rough hands began to gently stroke my own. Reluctantly, I opened my eyes to see the man examining my hands. He held them carefully, tracing my palm as if in awe. I looked up, his face was covered by the hood. 

“W-what's going on?” I finally stammered. 

That's when it all happened. He looked up, his shiny pale face looking back at me. I screamed instinctually, backing up into the wall. “Please,” he groaned ,”I l-lov,” his jaw suddenly detached, causing his mouth to open wide. A sickening *thud* sounded, causing the creature to collapse in a heap. 

I looked up to see my new neighbor standing there, holding a baseball bat. He looked at me with a look of terror and confusion. “What the hell is that?” he shouted. 

I didn’t have time to answer. The thing on the ground sprang up, tackling him. It perched on all fours above him. Drool dripped down its face as it opened its widened jaw and shrieked at him, their faces inches apart. 

Wildly, he swung his baseball bat, knocking it into the doorway. I grabbed my knife again as I helped him up, both our gazes locked on the creature. The pale eyes shined in the dim light as it backed away on all fours. With a shriek, it flipped around and scurried away. We ran into the hallway just in time to see it jump up and shatter the light, leaving us in darkness.

“Shit,” my neighbor mumbled, “Shit, shit, do you have a light?” 

“Yeah, follow me,” I gripped his arm as I felt my way back inside my apartment. I fumbled around the wall, finally finding the light switch. “Dammit,” I muttered when the light wouldn’t turn on. 

“Power might be out,” he whispered. 

“Over here then,” I felt my way into my bedroom. With little struggle, I reached my nightstand and flicked on my lighter. His worried face illuminated my view. 

“Okay, I have some flashlights in my apartment,” he said as he handed me the key. “You light the way, I’ll fight it off again if we have to.” I nodded as he brandished the bat. I gripped my knife and the key in one hand as we walked into the dark hallway.

“Go,” I whispered as we ran to the other side. I could hear shuffling as I inserted the key and threw open the door. We dove in and slammed the door behind us. 

“All right,” he said after we caught our breath. “Can I see the lighter?” 

I handed it to him and followed as he walked over to a pile of boxes. A few seconds of digging later, the entire room was lit up by a powerful light. 

Sighing, I slipped my light back into my sweatpants. He stood up and turned to face me, a flashlight in his hands. “Here, I’m Rob by the way.”

“Valerie,” I responded, taking the flashlight. “So what now? Can you call your friends?”

“Friends?” Rob asked

“Yeah, your cop friends?”

He looked at me confused, “How’d you know I was a cop?”

I shrugged, “You stuck out. That doesn’t matter though, we need to call them.”

Rob shook his head, “I don’t have a phone set up yet. They were gonna come sometime next week.”

“Dammit, I don’t have one in my apartment either.”

“Does the front office have one?”

I looked up, “Yeah, there’s a few phones downstairs, but how are we gonna get down there?”

Rob looked grim, hesitating before walking over to his kitchen. He opened a small box to reveal a pistol. Turning to me, he said sternly, “Stay behind me. I’ll only use this as a last resort.” 

I nodded, gripping my new flashlight as Rob creaked the door open. He panned the flashlight down both ends of the hallway, pausing on the dead end side before shining it back towards the side with the stairs. We crept out of the apartment, making our way towards the stairs. My heart pounded, anxiety jolting through me at every small creak and groan.

Rob let out a sigh of relief when we reached the door leading to the stairs. But relief soon turned to confusion, then frustration as the door didn’t budge. Cursing, he shined his light through the doors window to reveal a lock had been placed on it. “No no no,” he cried as he slammed against it.

“Rob,” I muttered in shock. 

“Dammit, dammit!” he yelled as he threw himself at the door. Noises in the hallway drew me back as I flicked my light back towards it.

“Rob,” I shook him but he continued to curse. 

“Rob!” I shouted. 

“WHAT?” He shouted back. 

I pointed towards the hallway. He looked up to see the few other residents pouring into the hallway. I could see the pale faced creature in the back as it slowly morphed itself into a normal looking resident. In an instant, I realized I couldn’t tell who it had become as familiar faces all looked back at me. 

“It’s one of us. It’s a resident,” I said as the group approached.
