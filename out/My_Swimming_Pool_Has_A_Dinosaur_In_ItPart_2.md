[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lwkavc/my_swimming_pool_has_a_dinosaur_in_it_part_1/)

Things have escalated-I'm not going to sugarcoat it. I'm thinking about buying a gun-lest I be either eaten alive or lynched. 

The day after I called animal control, I had a group of "concerned citizens" at my door. It was my neighbors-livid that I had called the cops on "Lucile." Standing at the front was a tall woman with lanky auburn hair. She wore a stained wife beater and blue jeans and had a bouncy baby boy cradled in her arms.

Besides her was a short pot belly pig nosed man with the fakest hair piece I had ever seen. I recognized them as the couple who lived across the street from me. They were always giving me dirty looks and making noise complaints, just being a pair of tumors on my ass.

He wore a green tracksuit with wildly unkempt chest hair-you could actually count each bead of rancid sweat clinging to each follicle. They were the spear head of the mildly upset mob; the rest were people I vaguely recognized in passing. Lot of faded hairstyles and leathery skin.

The tall woman-whose name was Tessa-pointed a boney finger into my chest.

"What gives you the right to call animal control on Lucile. She's lived here a HELL of a lot longer than you young man." She squawked. There were a lot of "Yeah!" and "Loser." coming out of the crowd. I stepped outside and tried to put on a confident face.

"Look-you people are nuts. It's a giant lizard living in my pool, what was I supposed to do-charge it rent?" I bellowed. 

"Lucile's been an institution in these parts since I was a kid-she never harmed nobody." Her husband replied. He had this thick Jersey scumbag draw to his voice-like if I cut him, he would bleed grease. "You've had this stick up your butt ever since you moved here-never come to the BBQs, always playing loud music, now this." He shook his head. 

"Am I the only sane person in this town?" I gasped. "Get the hell off my property before I call the cops, go on git." I tried to shoe them away but they wouldn't budge. In fact, they grew closer, throwing out accusations that I was going to poison Lucile or call the news about her. I was surrounded by middle-aged, sun-dried goons. The greaseball- whose name was Lucas-was getting right up in my face and wagging his sausage link at me. 

"I mean it-nice vacation spot ruined by douchebags like you-don't respect the community, don't respect nuthing." He spat at me. I slapped his hand away and towered over him, ready to give the little meatball a shove.

From behind the crowd a sharp whistle rang out. The crowd parted to reveal Wayne-packed clipboard in hand and cop on his side. I recognized the tan clad uni with him. She had blonde braided hair that ended in a pony tail going down her back. She wore blackout shades and had a cool expression on her face. Her gold-plated badge read "Barton County Sherif Dept."

Wayne held up his hands to calm the crowd as they began yelling at him now. His voice boomed with command as he began to reassure the mob. 

"People please-it is too damn hot for this. Now I know we're all upset at Sam's callousness-but lord knows he ain't the first to overreact. Who among you can say differently?" The crowd grew silent. Wayne grinned and laid on the charm. "Now why don't y'all head home-Office Sydney and I can handle it from here. Go on-before the heat drives, ya crazier." he joked.

There were a few polite chuckles as the crowd dispersed. Lucas and Tessa shot me a dirty look as they retreated back across the road. Wayne-who had grown more robust since I last saw him-waddled up the walk with officer Sydney in toe. He stuck out a meaty claw-and I took it firmly- a stoney look in my eye.

Sweat dripped off his brown in droves, and he wheezed with much effort as he stained his grey blazer to wipe it off. He had a tired look to him-saddled bags forming under his baby blues. 

"Now Sam-is it alright with you if we have this conversation inside?" He offered kindly. I stepped aside without a word and Wayne squeezed through the tight doorframe. He admired the decor of my place-eyeing the carefully place art on the walls.

There were a few pieces I am particularly proud of owning, like a watercolor overview of NYC. It hands right at the base of the stairs so even on a rainy day I can see a vibrant sunrise when I first wake up. I find it inspiring.

Sydney idled around the house-giving the place a distant glance. Wayne was parked in front of a portrait I commissioned of me and my old lab Sparky. It was of me in summer cloths, big old smile on my face as Sparky clung to me-fat and chocolate as the day I got him. I saddled up next to him, pride washing over my face.

"Nice huh? Cost 10K but it was worth every penny. Miss that dog everyday-died young, cancer in the bones or something." I casually explained. Wayne nodded, feigning interest.

"You certainly wear it all on your sleeves don't you Sam? Not a hint of modesty in ya huh." He grinned. I gave him a friendly jab in the shoulder."

And proud of it." I said. Wayne gave a fake laugh and cleared his throat. 

"Now then-I'm sure you know why I'm here. First let me just say-don't worry about those AC boys saying anything-" He started.

"I wasn't" I interrupted.

"-right, well Sydney took time out of her day to uh-intercept them on their way out of town and persuade them of what they saw."

"I bribed them." Sydney pipped up from the den. Wayne's face flashed crimson and decided the floor looked mighty interesting. He turned his attention to the kitchen, walking over with a hint of nostalgia on his face. He pointed towards the pool.

"She's out there now, right? Lemme-" He stopped near the door, breaking out in childish giggling. "-Heh, I'll be, she's barely aged a day I reckon." He was admiring Lucile from afar-who had been unbothered by the commotion at the front. She was still listing about in the pool-relaxing like she owned the joint. "I saw that girl grow from a pup-her parents were, let's say troublemakers but she was always sweet." He smiled, remising on some fond memory, I'm sure.

"She keeps trying to bite me-she nearly crushed me her first night here." I complained. He turned to me, fire in his eyes.

"Keep up that attitude I'm liable to try it as well." he barked. Now it was his turn to lecture me- he wagged the clipboard in my face with pointed fury. "Now I tried to tell you about the swamplands when you first moved in. You kicked me to the curb-and I've had a linty of complaints bout you ever since." 

"Lucas and Tessa right-hey you saw how they acted-"

"I'm not at liberty to disclose any names-"

"No, you saw-they were right up in my grill. I could have been beaten on my own property; you'd have a lawsuit on your hands buddy." I threatened. He narrowed his eyes at me. 

"Whatever you say Sam. Now here's the deal. The marshlands are protected grounds, and anything inhabiting that land is classified as endangered. We keep out of their hair-they keep out of ours." He explained. My eyes darted to the Spinosaurus taking a bath in my pool. Wayne held up his hands in defense.

"Now that said-these are animals, they can't be expected to abide by frilly things like federal law-they were here long before the township was first settled, and I expect they'll be here long after we're gone. I won't lie and say they're completely harmless- but they rarely venture out of the swamp."

 "They-so there are more of those things out there?" I said.

"Oh, my yes-few pods of different sizes and species, we strictly prohibit residents from exploring the area without supervision so I can't be sure how many for sure." I absorbed that bit of news, head swirling with the possibility of more of those things popping up. I took a seat at the counter and Wayne took that as an invitation to plop down next to me. He grunted as he tried to fit himself comfortably, his stool crying out in agony.

"Now I know it's a lot to take in-hell it seems downright impossible." He placed a sympathetic hand on my shoulder. "But you're part of a learned community now, people who've dealt with these animals their entire lives. I consider this a fresh start-there are a lot of good folks who wanna get to know you. In time-you'll get used to it. Someday you'll see a raptor rutting around your garbage can no differently than you would a raccoon." he smiled broadly. I shook off his grasp and pulled away from him. 

"Look I don't want to get used to it. I just want it out of my yard. How do I get rid of it-is there uh, uh a service number I call-local dino removal what?" I offered. "Money is no object." I added. Wayne furrowed his brow. A serious look grew on his pudgy face. 

"I'm sure it's not Sam. I'm afraid as of right now the animal does not meet the criteria for removal. It hasn't seriously threatened you outside of defending itself from you bugging her." He drooled on. 

"Are you-" he put up a hand. 

"Let me finish. Should any harm come to Lucile while she is on your property-I assure you there will be a VERY thorough investigation on the cause." He threatened. I backed off, stewing in my seething annoyance. He motioned Syndey over-who produced a pink slip from her belt. 'Now since you bring it up-" 

"-This is a fine for attempted unlawful removal of an endangered species, as well as additional surcharges for services rendered." She said in a husky voice. I snatched the fine out of her hands-eyes widening in shock.

"You're taxing me the cost of the bribe?" I screamed at them. Sydney gave me an unfazed look. 

"Failure to pay in a timely manner could result in higher fines or jail time. You have a nice day now." She said. Wayne hefted himself off the stool with a pained grunt and singled the crocked cop to follow his lead. I followed them to the door-struggling to comprehend it all. 

"Now don't take that fine personally-like I said I consider this a clean slate. Be mindful of Lucile-treat her kindly and she'll regard you as such. One other thing-" He spun to meet my gaze. "Like I said-too damn hot out here lately. Causing all sorts of things to wander out further than normal. Watch your step, secure your garbage, eh lock your door at night. You'll be fine. Haven't had a bite in over ten years." He boomed proudly. With that he turned to leave me. I closed the door behind them and heard him shout- "Oh and Sam-she likes fish." 

I texted Laura all this-she was ecstatic at the idea of seeing more dinosaurs. I felt ill. From the yard I heard the methodic crunch of bones as Lucille dug into lunch. She was chowing down on some sort of fuzzy black thing and a pile of stripped sunfish.

The rainbow pile of viscera she had piled up on my pool deck reeked of rotten tuna. Fish-she liked fish Wayne had said. There was also a rule about not feeding the damn things, but she was pretty much the damn town mascot, so what the hell, right?

I doubt I could lure her away completely-she had a pretty good thing going lounging around in the water all day. But if I fed her a few scraps maybe she'd stop snapping at me at least. Or she could rip my arm off and maul me to death.

Either way sitting around listening to her mew and chew was driving me nuts-so I decided to go to the store. On my way to the driveway, I ran into Rick walking his snow-white poodle. He waved me over and I begrudgingly humored him. He was a talker-but he always seemed nice to me. 

"Oh, hey there Sam-another hot one today, eh?" he jabbered. I nodded in his direction His Poodle-think his name was Rod-sat impatiently by his feet, painting up a storm. "Heard Wayne finally came by-hope he didn't come down on ya too hard." He spoke softly, almost out of pity.

"Yeah-it was certainly, something." I said, starting to edge out of the conversation. "Listen I got to run to the store so-"

"Oh, you remember the other day I was saying somethings been in my bird feed?" He lit up. I stared blankly at him, honestly forgetting what the hell he was talking about. He fumbled around in in his cargo shorts and pulled out this brick of a phone. He leaned in, beckoning me closer. 

"I caught one of the little rascals on video." he giggled. I squared my face, curiosity getting the better of me. He showed me this trail-cam footage he had from his backyard. There were a lot of hedges and playground equipment, and right next to a worn sandbox was this lean pole with bird feeders hanging off it. The hedges were all trimmed to look like giant chia pets.

Besides the sandbox there was also a tire swing near the edge of the yard and one of those old plastic playhouses with the slides that burned you when you slid down them.  It was time stamped 5:38 am. For a few seconds there was nothing of note-then this two-meter-tall thing appeared behind a hedge.

I gasped at the sight of it. It had long slender legs with two clawed toes and a third protruding at the base. It was curved like a hook, and the nail obsidian black. It had a long tale-it looked like a bi-pedal monitor lizard. The upper torso was covered by these magnificent feathers than ran all the way down its spine.

Violent reds and depressive blues swirled around it in strange patterns. Long thick feathers jutted out of the elbows-mock wings. Each stray strand was a beautiful shade of parrot red or orange spheres. If you looked at the creature from behind-you'd think it was flaming eyes staring at you.

The creature's neck was a shade of azure, blue you might find on a corpse; yet its skin looked lively and wrinkled. It had a snout like a bull terrier-and lemon eyes in an oval shape. There was a light crimson comb running down the skull, the leathery cockatrice flopped to the side of the beast as it looked around the yard.

It seemed to be sniffing the air-the scent of a free meal drawing it in. It spotted the bird feeder and it cooed-this warbling noise that sounded like it was hiccupping. It crept towards the feeder-stalking its inanimate prey. It sniffed and raised its head-pawing it with tiny little hands as it tried to break in.

The pole rattled and waivered-a shattering sound was heard as the raptor stuck his beak in and went to town. A porch light went off-the creature's eyes glowing in the sudden light. I heard a woman shout as the raptor ran off back into the brush. The video ended as Ricky put away his phone, chuckling to himself more than anything.

"Heh-wife can't stand them, thinks they're creepy. Kids get a kick out of them though. One time they got right up to the backdoor-I tell you man there is nothing greater than seeing a look of pure amazement on your kid's face."  He said. 

"I-didn't even know you were married." He slapped me on the back in response-it stung like hell. 

"Hell son, there's a lot you don't know. You're always couped up in that house of yours. I tell you what me and the wife are having a BBQ tonight-why don't you come over, meet the gang proper." He offered. I mulled that over and smiled back at him.

"Ya know what why not-hell I'm going to the store anyway, I'll pick up some extra dogs." 

"Thatta boy." Rick slapped me again, and I almost doubled over. "You'll see-we won't bite." He joked. I shook his hand-then asked a question that was starting to burn.

"Say Rick-you aren't worried about your kids being near those-raptors?" Rick laughed at this.

"Awe you seen too many movies, Sammy. I've lived here fifteen years-the raptors are little more than nuisances. Overgrown parrots more like." He scoffed. Then I noticed something, a slight twitch like he had second thoughts, but he brushed it off as quickly as it came. "Eh-in any case the kids know better than to get close to them. Besides-got old Rodney here to scare 'em off huh boy?"

He aggressively rubbed the Poodle's head-so much so it broke out in sneezes.

I'll admit that eased my worry a little bit-and I went off to the market in higher spirts. The market was ways out of the city bounds-So I put my top down and enjoyed the breeze blasting by as I sped down the highway. The swamp lands were a muck scented green blur as I blew by.

At the store I stocked up on plenty of BBQ food-hot dogs, mike's hard, and do it yourself smores. You ever try roasting marshmallows on a charcoal grill-it's awesome it absorbs the smoke and really seals in the flavor.

When I was a kid, my dad would take us out back and fire up the grill and we would gorge ourselves on smokey smores until the cows came home. I was looking forward to sharing that tradition that night. I also stocked up on about one hundred pounds of every fish they had in stock.

My car smelt like a fisherman's wharf by the time I was done packing it in. I think I broke the sound barrier speeding back home but I wanted it out of my car before the stench stained the inside forever. The early evening sun hung low-and I swear the heat just kept getting worse.

The air around the sky was sizzling-I swear I could hear it burning in the atmosphere. It took me a good while to store all that fish-I have a shed near the back porch. Temp's so low it's pretty much a walk-in freezer. Near the end the smell of charcoal and sizzling steak began to walk over from next door, and my tummy did a leap for joy as it growled in anticipation.

The whole time though Lucile was mad dogging me from the pool. The whiff of fresh fish piqued her interest, but she didn't make a move. She just watched with those curious emeralds. She slightly opened her jaw-making this croaking sound as she watched me work.

The pool was a mess-discarded limbs and half eaten muck floated around the now murky water. Every time she leaves, she drags more and more of the wetlands back with her.

Next door I heard the sharp barking of Rodney filling the air.

I placed a container of fresh salmon on the ground, never breaking contact with Lucile. She's like a big crocodile, right? Can't tame them-but you can teach them not to bite the hand that feeds them. The salmon felt raw, and putty like in my hands. I swear she started drooling at the sight of it.

I stepped towards the pool as she began to lift herself out. She slowly moved one claw forward after the other-completely focused on the meat. My heart was pounding out of my chest-every rational part of my brain was screaming at me "*This is it-this is how you die*." But watching her crawl out of the pool-the muck falling other her gilded scales-a tiny part of me said "*Go ahead, it'll work out*." Laura would have already tried to tie a saddle to the thing-let alone hand feed it.

I wasn't there yet-so I tossed the pink, floppy mess into the air. She eyed it like a hawk-those steady eyes on it like radar. In a swift motion she snatched it out of there and chomped it down in one gulp. Her tail lifted and crashed down-and she let out a mild bellow.

Her eyes landed on me and the crate of fish at my feet. She began her advance once more and I staggered back.

Rodney was howling now, having some kind of fit. I heard Ricky call out-"Rodney down boy, ease up."

As Lucile inched closer. I quickly fumbled around for another slab of meat. It felt so slimy to the touch but as soon as I held it up, she stopped in her tracks. I stood my ground, looking her dead in the emeralds as I tossed it once more.

Again, she caught it-cooing as she savored the meat. She was fully out of the water now and cautious in her movements. Despite her bulky size she actually moved quite gracefully-every step, a methodical movement like she was a dainty dancer. She knew how to softly step as she staked the grounds-eyes on the prize as she debated pouncing on the box all together.

I reached down to grab another hunk-and let me tell you if anyone ever tries to tell you a dinosaur can't salivate? Well, they're lying to you. She surged forward like a greedy lapdog. Panic struck my face as she inched closer and I put my hand up and spoke with some base in my voice.

"Stop." I commanded.

She did not stop-in fact she began to pick up the pace.

Next door Rodney was going mental over something. He was snarling and making sounds I didn't know dogs could make. I head the slow slide of Ricky's backdoor open as poked his head out and called out to his pet.

I wasn't focusing on that too much unfortunately, as Lucile was about to chomp my hand off. I tossed the fish in the air as she was inches away from me. I staggered to the ground as she caught it mid ear-she did a little front-end hop like a trick seal. As she chewed, she brought her head real low to the ground.

I could feel her hot, steamy breath as she drew her head closer to me. Her teeth were small and curved, like fishhooks. Perfect for tearing into flesh. She was so close I could count them actually. I held my ground-sitting there in the moist dirt mind you-as she towered over me.

She let out a groaning hiss as she locked her gaze on to me-the stench of salmon and decay wafting out of her maw. I tried not to tremble as I pushed any thought of death and dismemberment out of my mind.

Her nostrils puckered-and she turned her attention to the salmon box. She gently picked it up and stomped back to the pool-her tail brushing past my chest as she did. I exhaled sharply, as I dusted myself off and watched her lumber back into the water.

That's when I started to tune in on the screaming coming from next door.

Rodney's sharp bark had been replaced by pained howls and rapid yipping. There was the sound of frantic running and a bloody scuffle on the other side. Ricky was yelling, his booming voice crying out in fright and righteous anger. 

"No-get away from that, GET AWAY FROM HIM." He bellowed-pain and suffering oozing from his voice. There was this chattering noise from the far end of his yard. It sounded like a heckling cough mixed in with a hissing chirp.

My heart froze as I realized what was happening.

I rushed over to the fence as the choked yipping died down and Ricky's own cries of ache started. Without hesitation I began to scale the fence, little more than a skip and a leap. I was halfway over when I saw the raptor gnawing on Ricky's forearm.

Its dead yellow eyes were full of ravenous fury as it bit down, struggling to tear it off at the socket. The raised claw on its foot was covered in fresh crimson, and Ricky was clasping down on his side with his free arm- a thick pool forming on his floral shirt.  Tossed aside to his right was a steel carving fork-two prongs glistening in the heat.

I hopped over with a grunt as I watched Ricky wrestle with the feathered monster. The raptor was grasping the bitten arm with its stringy hands, two claws wrapped around as it used its maw to shake and tear. Ricky grunted as he bit his tongue and held back his cries of agony.

Rodney was nowhere to be found.

His backdoor slide open and a red-haired woman rushed outside, stopping inches from the door as she clasped her hand-forcing a premature end to her startled yelp. The raptor rattled its head and shook it like a rabid dog, blood pooling from its gums as it tore into the muscle tissue with serrated fangs.

I rushed over without a second thought, my mind racing on how to pry this thing away from him. My gaze flicked to the shinning fork-and I scooped it up and butted my way in.

The raptor took a mindless swipe at me with a paw, treating me like an annoying gnat at first. I tightened my grip on the grill fork and raised it above the base of the raptor's skull. I jabbed downward and rammed the prong right into its oval eye.

One prong went right in-like a fork into jelly. The other scrapped the leather hide, a deep laceration forming. The beast relaxed its jaw as Ricky pulled away and collapsed to the ground. The raptor was blindly snapping at the air as I twisted the fork deeper into its skull. A gooey mix of red fluid and yolk-like pus oozed out of its socket.

The raptor raised a leg to try and slash me. But as adrenaline surged through me, I pushed it back, raising the fork and stabbing at its face in a frenzied motion. It stagged back, two fresh sanguine lines forming across its face.

It whined-a loathsome chirping scat. The veins in the raptor's neck waned and warbled as it vocalized its frustration. It took a quick glance at me-pure hatred radiating off it's one good eye and scampered away, almost hopping on two feet as it disappeared into the brush.

Ricky lay a couple feet from me, rolling on the ground as he groaned and held his arm. The wound on his side was short yet deep, the dark pool of blood on the ground almost a shade of pungent purple. I cursed under my breath and came to his side, careful not to move him too much.

The woman-who I would later learn was Rick's wife Marla- rushed over in near hysterics. From inside we heard a child's voice squeak out. 

"Mom? Is everything ok? We heard yelling." she asked from inside. A small shadow lingered by the door, not daring to come to the light. Marla whisked her head to the door in quick response. 

"E-everything's find Jane. Don't come out here right now daddy had a- a little grilling accident. Go into the TV room with Stevie until I come get you ok sweetie?" She croaked out-desperately trying to hide the panic in her voice. Jane was silent, but the disappearing shadow confirmed her compliance.

Ricky grunted and tried to sit up, but Marla pushed him back down. My hands were warm and bloodied as I applied pressure to his side. 

"Don't try to move baby, you're in shock." Marla whispered as she examined his trembling arm. The wounded limb was shaking, a great circular bite throbbing with tender bruised flesh. Some of his skin had been torn away by the thing's teeth- mishappen puncture wounds littered his bloodied arm in an oval that was pouring crimson. Marla grimaced and turned her gaze to me. 

"S-Sam go inside and get some towels, it'll help the pressure." I nodded and rose but was startled by the sudden grasp of Ricky. His eyes were full of sorrow and salty regret-he could barely grunt out his command."

Go get-get a blanket. Behind the bush-I don't- the kids can't see him like that." He Let go and pointed behind me towards a cutesy hedge in the depiction of a pig. I didn't question him; I just rushed inside the house.

A lukewarm breeze greeted me as I walked into their home. I looked around the well-kept kitchen looking for fresh towels. They were piled up neatly next to the sink. I grabbed them as from deeper in the house the sounds of a sponge giggling to himself filled the air. I followed that noise to the living room- it had two bulky couches with a young girl nervously eyeing the tv while her brother was sprawled on the floor-glued to the show oblivious to everything.

When I entered Jane gave me a side eye but said nothing. There was a grey blanket laying soft on the backrest. I awkwardly reached over-tugging on the corners as it swayed my way. 

"Is my dad ok?" Jane softly spoke, her facing unmoving yet the quiver in her voice betrayed her. I put on a brave smile like you're supposed to do when you lie to children and reassured her. 

"Of course-he just, he had a little burn on his arm. Grilling too much steak haha. He'll be ok I promise." I said, fully collecting the blanket. Jane said nothing in return-though a hint of doubt washed over her. I got out of there as quickly as I could, I sucked with kids and didn't want to worry her any more than she already was.

The blazing air greeted me with a harsh smack as I came back out. A small crowd had started to gather on the edge of the yard, worried onlookers and curious busybodies choking the side yards. Tessa stood before a mummering crowd with her hands raised.

"Why don't y'all make yourself useful and go grab Sydney? She's usually sleeping one off down the road a bit by now." She muttered that last part to herself as a couple broke away and ran down the road in the sweltering heat. Lucas emerged from behind the pig hedge-somehow looking paler than Rick. He grimly approached me, reaching for the towels. 

"I'll take care of him, kid. You-look after Rodney. Don't let anyone else back there." He sounded sickly, grabbing the towels and kneeling besides Rick. His eyes swirled in his head and he was starting to mumble nonsense. He was so pale, like he had just risen from the grave. With a grunt Lucas gently pushed Marla aside and took over wound duty. He reached down and took Rick's hand as he did. He put on a cocky smile-the kind you use when you lie to dying men.

"Better ways outta hosting, I'll say that much." He brayed. Marla put her head down and laughed in spite of it all, a quick sniffle as she held Ricky's ghostly head in her lap. In the distance I heard sirens approaching from all sides. I made my way behind the hedge, and I noticed speckles of dried blood on the blades.

I smelled him before I saw him-the blazing sun making quick work of the corpse. I held my nose in disgust as I examined the scene.

What remained of Rodney lay strewn across the yard. The raptor had split him open belly up, half eaten entrails piled at his paws. His once snow-white coat was now plum stained and matted-hazel eyes sunken and milky as he stared up at me.

A coagulated pool of brown stained his neck, another slit cut into his jugular. I'd like to believe his death was quick enough-but as the image of his mangled body seared into my brain, I knew that was a pipe dream.

I covered what I could of the poor mutt and stood guard by the hedge. In my silent vigil I watched the paramedics come and take over, Lucas leading a sobbing Marla away while a ginger head peeked out from the upstairs window.

I watched as they took him away in an ambulance, sirens wailing mournfully as they sped away-the onlookers dispersing as quickly as they came. I watched Tessa take a grieving wife into her arms and lead her inside while Lucas gave a boastful statement to the cops.

He talked with his hands, flailing around like a drunk child as he spat out a tale of horror and heroics. He pointed towards me a few times, a knowing look on his face.

In my yard I heard distant splashing and bellowing-the excitement stirring her from her early evening nap. As the yard became a haze of uniforms and gruff questions I felt a cool hand on my shoulder. It turned me towards her and the tired face of Officer Sydney was tugging at the pronged weapon still in my hand. The prongs were bent and busted; I imagine more than a few bits of it stuck in that feathered horror. 

"I'll need this for evidence sir." She said point blank. I stared at her, numb to the world in that moment. 

"Why-you going to fine me again?" I spat coldly.

 "Well-we'll tell Wayne I did anyway." She shrugged. She took the fork from my hands and motioned past me. "You should go home, get some rest. Nothing you can do tonight." 

"What about Rodney." I muttered, still glued to my spot. She looked past me to the foul-smelling blanket behind me.

"I'll make sure it's taken care of. Marla already told the kids he ran off chasing squirrels. They're not dumb though-well Jane isn't anyway." She explained. She took my hand and gently escorted me back to my house. The reality of it all was starting to beat me over the head. How stupid it was to just charge in like that, I had no plan could have easily gotten us both killed.

I expected Sydney to chew me out over it but instead she left me at my front door and said that Wayne was already working on a "Statement" and to expect it slide under my door in the morning. There was disdain in her voice as she said it. She thanked me for what I did and left me with a "Have a good night now." as she slunk into the night.

I checked my phone and had over a dozen messages from Laura ranging from concerned jokes about Lucille eating me to begging to tell her how feeding her went.

I'm parked near the back door right now, watching her float in her "den." I'm dreading telling Laura about what happened. She was so giddy at seeing more of them-like a kid at the zoo for her first time.

Now who knows if she'll even want to come over again.

Outside Lucille is mewing at the night sky, who knows, maybe it's a mating call or something. The fireflies are out in droves tonight. I see them dancing in the air, yet as I type this a feel a chill running up my spine.

There are shadows hiding among the trees, whispering things with pairs of glowing orbs, watching me from afar.

One of them only has one eye.
