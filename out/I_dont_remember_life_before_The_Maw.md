It’s always just… been here. An unavoidable part of our lives. No questions asked.

Weird opening, I know, but please stick with me.

For context: My name’s Thomas. I live on an island in the northeast Atlantic called [redacted]. Ever heard of it? Didn’t think so. My parents say we moved here when I was three. But I can’t remember a single goddamn thing before this place. Nothing. Not a face, not a smell, not even a childhood toy. Just static.

It’s not just me either. my sister Sammie (she’s three years older, making her 6 when we moved) says the same thing. Total blackout before [redacted]. And anytime we brought it up to our parents growing up, they’d change the subject like we asked about sex or murder or something.

Eventually, as a candle flickers out after being alive for so long, we stopped asking. Don’t get me wrong though, it always stayed in the back of my mind.

But that’s not even the weirdest part. Incomparable to what I’m about to tell you.

The real problem with this island is The Maw.

Every year, seven names get drawn. Seven people from the island. Doesn’t matter if you’re rich, poor, young, old. Once your name’s called, that’s it. No goodbyes. No funerals. You’re taken. And you feed The Maw.

They say The Maw isn’t something you can see. That it lives deep in the earth, beneath the cliffs on the north side, behind a gate that only opens one day a year. You don’t get to come back. You don’t want to.

Everyone had their theories to how the maw came to be. Some speculated The Maw was a creature; ancient, unknowable, hungry. Others believed it was an actual person with a thirst for blood(that was mostly a story told to scare kids, like an urban legend) But Sammie found something last year. Something that changed everything.

She snuck into the towns archives (don’t ask how, she’s the kind of person who gets in where she shouldn’t) and came back all pale and shaking. All she said was: “It’s not a beast. It’s not even alive. We built it.”

I thought she was messing with me. Until the screaming started. Until we started seeing things at night. Metal teeth and creaky jaws, wet with blood, opening under the cliffs. Steam. Machinery. Chains clinking.

Turns out, The Maw isn’t a monster. It’s a machine. A man-made thing with a hunger nobody can fathom to grasp. Maybe it was punishment. Maybe it was out of spite. All I know is it eats people. Tears them to shreds. I’ve seen the cliffs stained red the morning after a sacrifice. Once, Sammie found a hand lodged between two rocks. It looked like it tried to crawl out.

And now?

**My name was drawn.**

I have three days.

If this post disappears, you’ll know why.

But if this reaches someone, I’m begging you to look into whatever the hell island [redacted] is. Find out who built The Maw. Find out why.

Burn it down, I don’t care. Do whatever it takes to stop it.

Just don’t let it feed again.
