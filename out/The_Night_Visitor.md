One day, Liam was on his way to his Grandma’s house. She lived in a secluded log cabin in the far woods of Maine. After hours of driving, he arrived. Liam knocked on the door. A knot tightened in his stomach as his Grandmother opened the door. He stepped inside, the light of the fireplace flickering in the distance. Multiple animal heads were strapped on the walls. She led him through a door on the right, leading into a dimly lit living room. The air was thick, with the smell of old wood.



“Do you want anything to eat, sweetie?” she asked in a calm voice.



“No, thank you. I still have food in the car.” Liam answered feeling that same knot again. His Grandma led him to the guest room



“You can sleep here. I set everything up just for you!” She said in a happy tone.



Liam thanked her and stepped in the guest room, his eyes scanning his surroundings. There was a wooden window with a cross-shaped rim above the bed, a dark oak closet barely being lit by the moonlight, a round wooden table and two old wooden chairs in the corner shadow. Liam went to bed with an uneasy feeling nagging at him.



All of a sudden he got ripped out of his sleep in the middle of the night. He heard something. It sounded like a crash. He looked at the time. ***3 AM***. Liam gulped with a bare sense of uneasiness.



He reluctantly looked outside of the window. In the far distance hiding in the shadow, barely illuminated by the moonlight. Liam could make out what looked to be a dark human figure, watching him. Liam frantically jumped under his bed and hid, his heart racing. He grabbed his phone, dialing 911.



“911, what’s your emergency?” the operator asked.



Liam, breaking down, said: “There’s somebody standing outside my window. It was just staring at me. Please send somebody. I’m scared.”



The operator halted for a bit and then said: “Stay calm, we’ll send somebody over. What is your current location?”



Liam, now breaking down, answered: “I am.. East of the Allagash River by, by the Three Mile Island in a cabin. Please help me!”



“Calm down, help is on their way, just stay hidden and everything will be alright.” The operator answered Liam.



Liam calmed slightly, but was still on edge. The operator hung up and Liam listened for any incoming sounds from outside, still startled and terrified by what he just saw.



Suddenly there was a rattling sound coming from outside. Liam’s heartbeat skyrocketed and he started hyperventilating.



Panicked, he grabbed his backpack and pulled out his gun. He frantically loaded it after multiple failed attempts and tried to calm down unsuccessfully. Suddenly Liam heard glass shattering right above him. Glass flew all over the floor. His mattress was creaking and bending down.



Liam was shaking at this point, sweating and trying to breathe as quietly as possible. A pair of black gas shaped feet hit the floor. Liam took his chance and aimed the gun at it. He swiftly shot, still shaking, but the bullet went right through only releasing a small cloud of black smoke.



The being noticed Liam and walked towards the bed. It grabbed the bed and threw it through the ceiling. Liam saw the figure more closely now. It had no face or any other features. It was just a human-like figure of black smoke. Liam was panickingly trying to stand up and when he finally did, he shot the being as many times as he could, but every bullet just went right through.



The figure grabbed Liam and jumped out the window pulling Liam with it. Liam was knocked to the ground. He opened his eyes and stood up, looking around, still shaking. It was gone. Liam calmed down a bit, thinking it was finally gone and this nightmare was over.



All of a sudden he heard air whistling from above. He looked up to see the being crashing down onto him. Liam was knocked unconscious immediately as it landed. The being grabbed his gun, standing menacingly above him. It aimed and shot Liam.



He was found dead a few minutes later when the police arrived. They had no leads. There were no footsteps, fingerprints and the weapon was gone. The only lead they had was scratch marks on the tree next to his body where it presumably jumped off of.



As the paramedics were cleaning up the scene, a police officer came up to Liam’s Grandmother.



“Hello Ma’am, did you see or hear anything during this incident?” The police officer asked calmly.



With tears flowing down her cheeks, she answered “No officer, nothing. My poor young boy!”



In the following weeks there were multiple other incidents with the same scratch marks somewhere nearby. No other evidence was ever found. That was until 3 years later. A total of 121 victims had been killed up to that point. It was on that eventful evening west of the Davis Falls in New Hampshire that the mystery got a new clue.



On *April 2nd 1998*, a *Thursday evening*, the police got a call from a woman named Mary Jones. The following call pursued.



“Hello? I need help, I am at the Davis Falls. Somebody is stalking me from the woods.” Mary said in distress.



The operator said “We’ll send somebody over right away. Stay in groups of people if possible and avoid going into a secluded area at all costs!”



“Okay, please help, quick!”



Mary made her way towards a bridge and hid under it. She was hyperventilating and trying to breathe as quietly as possible. She looked around, but nothing was there.



All of a sudden she heard footsteps coming from above her on the bridge. The figure suddenly ran towards her and Mary screamed, frantically running off. It was extremely fast. Mary grabbed the nearest stick she could find and tried to fight it off while screaming for help.



It ripped the stick out of her hand and beat her with it until she blacked out. A few minutes later the police arrived. When they arrived they already had paramedics with them. She had a concussion, a few broken ribs, a collapsed lung, a broken arm, a sprained ankle and she was deaf in one ear.



The police had another lead. She was still alive and the stick was still there. After being searched for any DNA, they found out that the stick contained carbon monoxide. Mary described a lifeless figure that could not be hit. It was just black gas. Mary reported blurry vision, chest pain, confusion, shortness of breath and a headache.



This led the doctors to a carbon monoxide poisoning. Using this the police had set up flyers, posters and posts on social media to grab attention to it and try to get in any reports. After one week on another *Thursday, April 9th 1998*, the police had their first report of a sighting. There was an image attached. It was taken near the green bridge in Maine.



The picture showed a dark figure standing behind trees staring at the camera. The poster was found dead two hours after posting this. As the weeks went on there were more and more sightings. A total of 30 in just one month. Every poster was found dead shortly after.
