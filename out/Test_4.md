Hello, my name is Jonas and I never had planned on telling anyone what I'm about to tell you, but I just can’t keep living with it and I have to get it off my chest. So about 4 years ago I worked as a night guard at an office. It wasn’t really a big one but not a small one either so when I had to walk around the office to make sure every door was closed and locked, and no one was still there it would take a while until I was done. Usually there wouldn't be a problem with it but one day something happened and that’s what I'm going to talk about now.

It was a cold night in March, and I had just arrived at the office before I would go up to the camera room, I had to make sure everything was locked, and no one was there. Now after I really regret that I stayed that night for what I saw haunts me to this day. After I was done with my little trip it was already 12:00 Pm I went up to the camera room which is on the top floor.

When I got in, I turned on the computers and took a quick look at all the cameras and it all looked as usual, so I turned on another computer that’s not for the cameras and put on a movie. After only about 45 minutes into the movie I could see that a door opened on one of the cameras and something just running through it quickly. Since it ran by so quickly, I didn’t get a really good look, but it looked like a black silhouette at the time I thought it was just because I didn't get a good look, but I would soon realize that wasn’t the case.

I thought to myself that it was just some kid wanting to mess the place up. So I paused the movie, took on my belt consisting of only a baton and a flashlight and went out to see who it was. The door had opened on the first floor, and it was the back door meaning either it’s got to be an employe with a key to the back door which only about 3 people had and if it wasn’t one of them someone must have locked it.

After about 1 or 2 minutes I was at the back door but weirdly it was closed and locked again. I thought it was weird since from what I knew the “kid” hadn’t done anything. Then suddenly I heard a loud bang. I jumped up and thought “what the hell is this kid doing in here” I went towards where the bang came from forgetting about the door being locked and being focused on the bang. The bang sounded like it came from the basement. There isn’t really anything in there except for some trash and chairs and some stuff. I hadn’t really been in the basement at all since I had no reason to be there, so I didn't really know what was in there.

I started going down the stairs towards the basement when I heard another loud bang now, I could clearly hear that it was coming from the basement. When I got down to the basement I didn’t see anything, all I could see was trash everywhere. I looked around for a bit and found a door hidden by the trash at the end of the room. The door was already opened a bit and it looked like someone just went in since trash around the door was compressed as if someone had walked on it. So I went in through the door and there was a long hallway with a few flickering lights and the floor, roof and walls were just completely white. After a bit of walking I felt chills in my neck as if someone was breathing cold air to it I looked back and saw nothing but the white hallway and the door a few meters away. I just ignored it and kept walking and then suddenly BANG I looked back and the door was closed I ran towards it but when I tried to open it was locked. What the hell I thought

-Open the door, I yelled

I didn't get a response. I was mad but I didn’t have a choice but to keep going. I had never been down here, so I don’t know what’s down here. After a while of walking, I found an intersection where I could either go left or right. I looked around for a sign or anything but saw nothing but the white walls all around me. I decided to go right and started walking. Then suddenly I heard another loud bang but this time it was louder than before. I screamed

-Come out kid you shouldn’t be here

But yet again no response but I heard another loud bang but this time it was closer than before I started walking quickly and after about 2 minutes, I found something a sign that said “Do not enter” I thought to myself what choice do I really have so I walked towards the door and tried to open it.

It was unlocked, I went in and closed the door behind me. In the room there was a computer showing one of the cameras, a chair, some drawers, a table with some papers on it and a pretty big locker. I decided to look at the camera and saw that it was in the camera room where I sat.

I was really scared now I had never seen a camera in the room nor had anyone told me about one that’s in there.  The computer screen had a piece of tape on it with something written on it. It was hard to read it, but it looked like it said “Test 4” I thought to myself what do you mean test 4 what is this place. I decided to look at the papers on the table, which I would regret really quickly. The papers showed pictures of 4 Different people and had a label. They said, “Test 1” “Test 2” “Test 3” and “test 4” all the papers up to “Test 3” showed a picture of someone and a text that said “Test (1-3) failed (their name) dead” what the hell is this who are these people i thought then I looked at the paper that said “Test 4” the text said “Test 4 ongoing Jonas alive” What the hell is this is this a prank what do you mean test 4 ongoing this is crazy.

At this point I was terrified of this place, and I no longer thought that there was a child that broke in. But then suddenly I heard it again the loud bang and again ang again it was coming towards me quickly I was scared I needed to hide I thought I looked around and saw the locker. I quickly opened it and got in it was tight but it was better than nothing. I had to hold the door so that it would close on me for if it did I would be stuck.

The bang kept getting louder then I heard the door open and through a little hole I could see what looked like a black silhouette just like the one on the camera before. And I realized that it wasn’t an employe it probably wasn’t even a human it walked toward to computer looking at the camera. From what I could see it had claw like hands and long legs. I was scared I hoped that it would go out of the room so I could get out cause I it hurt like hell being in that locker. After a few minutes it left I stayed in the locker for a bit to make sure it was gone and then went out it hadn’t closed the door after so I peeked out and saw nothing.

I thought about what to do and decided that I should go back to where the hallway intersected and try to go left in hopes of there being an exit there. So quietly but rapidly I started walking back from where I came and a few minutes later I was there. Without wasting time I started walking the other way as soon as I started walking the other way I got the felling that I was being watched and any second the thing that's down here would just take me. But I had no choice but to keep walking. At this point I was mad at myself for going down here, why did I go down here I thought. After what felt forever I saw a sign it said “Exit->” I was so happy and started walking right.

Then I heard it again a bang and again it was walking towards me I started running and so did it I was terrified but I just kept running without looking back. Every bang behind me scared me even though I knew it was going to happen. I ran and ran until I found it an exit door I went I tried to open it but is was locked. Shit Shit shit I said I took out my keys out of my pocket I only had 4 different ones first one didn't work second didn't either the bang was still getting louder. Then as I tried the third one it went right in and I tried to open the door and it worked the door opened I quickly went in and closed it right away as soon as I closed it I could feel a bang to the door it almost got me i quickly locked it and finally I felt safe I felt relived. There was a staircase in front of me and I stared going up it at the top there was a door I opened it and saw. The sunlight I was so happy. I had never been so happy in my life to be laying down on the road. I stood up and went to the front entrance there were cops talking to all the workers. As soon as they saw me they ran towards me and asked me where id been. I tried to tell them but they thought i was crazy and that I just was in shock. After that day I never came back to the building again and I suppose test 4 has failed.
