Hi everyone.

Usually I tend to go to work with public transport. It's safe, fast and convenient as I can work on my laptop in the meantime. Yes - it's crowded, but I don't mind as long as I can sit down and mind my own business.

So lately I've been arguing with myself to improve my travel time. I love listening to music, so why wouldn't I invest in a higher quality headphone? I would say I am a bit old fashioned with my cheap, wired earbuds. So eventually I persuaded myself and decided to buy some expensive wireless headphones with something called noise cancelling. And yes, I know, i found out this technology exists for years. I just never researched it.

I should've done that way earlier as it's amazing. Whenever I travel, I'm completely in my own world. It's somewhat similar to being in a luxurious hotel room. Closed off from everyone else, enjoying the fresh smell of a clean room, the soft linen, the soundproof walls... But something has changed since I got to use these headphones.

As one day I was travelling again to work by train and I decided to just enjoy my new headphones. While I was listening to some music, I was staring outside through the, probably just cleaned, windows. I was watching the beautiful landscapes, farms, little houses as the train went on. As suddenly I felt a strange, tense feeling, as someone was poking his eyes in my neck. As I looked around in the compartment, I couldn't catch anyone watching me. 

It didn't really bug me as this wasn't anything special. Everyone has this feeling sometime. But as I was enjoying my travels, staring outside again, it was right there in the reflection of the window: a man was watching me behind the chairs in front of me. He had a big grin on his face and was watching me persistently. He had a penetrating look in his eyes, it was like he was locked on to me. What a creep, I thought. But, as I stood up to look behind the chair, the man didn't have a big grin on his face. In fact, he wasn't locked onto me; he was locked on his own phone,  doomscrolling tiktok or something.

As I sat down I couldnt believe if what I saw in the window was real or not. I thought about it but I just couldn't care enough about what happend, so I decided to just return to my own 'luxurious hotel room' again.

But on the way back home, the same thing happened again.

I felt this same feeling of being watched. Instead of looking around me, I kept watching my phone and tried to pry around with my eyes to see if I could catch a glimpse of someone watching me. But it wasn't just someone. It was literally everyone in the whole compartment. Everyone had a big grin on their face and was giving me a dead stare, hyperfocused on my, watching all my movements with great interest. It felt insanely tense, like I was hallucinating. As soon as I looked up, everyone turned back to normal and no one was watching me.

I was scared shitless because it happened that morning as well. It feels like everyone was just making a fool out of me. As I was walking home, paying half attention to my phone just to see if it would happen again, I noticed everyone walking by was actually watching. I don't know what they want from me, they never ask me anything, they don't even come closer. They just stare at me with a big grin and eyes.

The last couple of nights the faces of these people stick with me. It's like they are burned in my eyes. The faces are a bit blurred, as I never can catch someones face completely: their face turns normals as soon as I look at them directly. So I haven't really slept anymore: my brain just replays these faces over and over.

It must have been the earbuds, I thought.so I just wouldn't use the noise cancelling earbuds anymore. This morning I went with the train to my work again, because I'm so tired, I fell asleep during the travel for just a brief time. 

I've felt asleep before in the train, but today, Immediately as my eyes closed I felt hands going over my whole body. In my dream I must've been thinking I was getting a massage. The hands felt hot, figuratively and literally. This quickly changed to burning hot. I instantly got shocked awake and saw people their face returning to normal. Meanwhile I still felt the burning hands on my body. As I checked, I noticed I actually got burning marks on my body, exactly on the places where the hands have been during the short moment I was sleeping.

I don't know what is happening. I don't know what to do. I'm at work now, keeping myself awake with as much coffee as possible. I am afraid to ever fall asleep again. What if they know where I live? I'm not superstitious per se, but what if these burning hands are me being dragged down to hell? I must be crazy to even consider that.

I don't even trust anyone reading this anymore, but if anyone knows what to do in my situation, I would consider to act on it.
