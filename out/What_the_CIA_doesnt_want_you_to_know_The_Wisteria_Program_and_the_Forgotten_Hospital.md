First I apologize to everyone who read my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zvw1fc/my_friend_used_to_work_for_the_cia_he_told_me/) and have been waiting for an update. I've been trying to figure out the best way to share the information I know.

Having said that here is the first (of many) secrets, covered up by the CIA.

For years, the CIA ran a program called "Wisteria" (yes, named after the flower). Officially, the program didn't exist. As with most top-secret CIA operations though, that was a lie.

Wisteria wasn't your typical CIA "mind-control" experiment. Oh no -- the branch of the CIA working on Wisteria had achieved total, remote mind control years ago (but that's for another day). Instead, it was built around psychological triggers.

The goal was to implant memories into people that could be triggered by certain events or stimuli. The CIA wanted to be able to manipulate people's memories and make them believe things that weren't true. But, as with most of the agency's work, the results were far more sinister than they had imagined.

When the CIA first began Wisteria, there were a few promising results. People could be triggered to remember things that never actually happened, and with long-term exposure, the memories seemed to stick. But there were some unexpected implications — namely, the memories could become almost impossible to reverse.

Initially, the CIA was elated. This meant they could manipulate memories and control people without ever having to reveal themselves. But as the experiments continued, something strange began to happen. Multiple subjects started exhibiting strange physical symptoms — disorientation, confusion, and violent outbursts were all reported.

The CIA continued to monitor the experiments, but the psychological trauma began to take an even greater toll. People experienced severe depression, panic attacks, and even episodes of psychosis. They became deluded, constructing their own versions of society. By manipulating a few select memories, the CIA had changed a person entirely. As one scientist put it, the Wisteria project was “a Pandora’s Box of nightmares that unleashed the darkest parts of the human psyche.”

Here are the notes from one scientist.

“After further review, it seems clear that our previous experimentation has had a catastrophic effect. This ‘memory manipulation’ seems to have caused the subjects to suffer permanent psychological trauma. We have come to believe that the memories we implanted were too powerful to control. In some cases, the memories were so intense that they began to permanently alter the subjects’ sense of reality. In other cases, subjects were left with severe psychological trauma and severe psychological disturbances.

We had not anticipated such a reaction. We now believe that our project has caused irreversible psychological damage. We can only advise the powers above us to never attempt such a dangerous experiment again. The consequences are simply too much to bear.”

The organization running Wisteria was disbanded after a final catastrophe, where an escaped subject went on a rampage, killing three people and injuring many more in a mailbombing campaign (you may have heard of him). But it gets worse. While the program was disbanded, the people involved continued to run experiments.

In secret, they continued to conduct experiments in mind manipulation and control, using the victims of their initial experiment as a test bed. They kept them alive and kept them in a facility deep in the woods of Arizona – now known as the “Forgotten Hospital” – but this time, there were no limits as to what they could do. They injected their victims with drugs that caused terrible night terrors and subjected them to unspeakable physical and psychological torture.

These human experiments went on for years. People were subjected to experimental surgeries, including brain implants, chemical treatments, and even sensory deprivation. The results were horrific – many of the victims were left in a permanent state of disorientation, confusion, and fear.

Worse - experimenters forced their victims to breed, creating generations of mentally unstable children and people.

A few of the victims eventually managed to escape, and some even made it as far as the press. Not in a good way (let's just say they are all either dead or locked up for life). The program descended from memory manipulation into madness, with the scientists having gotten consumed by some mysterious drive to create an utterly savage race.

In fact, it got so bad, even the CIA thought it had crossed a line, trying to shut the rogue program down. They sent in squadrons of soldiers to raid the Forgotten Hospital and end the terror once and for all.

Except that file is empty. The soldiers never returned.

It turns out, as the years passed, the scientists grew more and more paranoid. They became convinced that the government was out to get them and that the subjects in the Forgotten Hospital were the key to their survival. They began to see the subjects as more than just test subjects -- they saw them as comrades in their fight against the government.

The scientists then became increasingly erratic, conducting experiments on subjects that were more and more extreme. They wanted to see how far they could push the subjects, to see if they could break them completely, and turn them into weapons. And then, one day, they did.

One of the subjects, a woman only named F12, snapped. Her mind had been twisted beyond recognition. When the scientists came to her room to conduct yet another experiment, she was ready.

F12 grabbed a scalpel from the tray of instruments and began to slice through the scientists' veins with utmost precision. She killed two of them before anyone could react, and then she turned on the rest. The scientists fled in terror, barricading themselves in the control room as F12 stalked the halls, killing anyone she came across. Those who weren't killed by F12 died of starvation.

Without people to maintain the systems that held the Forgotten Hospital's victims, they soon were able to escape. These people were no longer human -- their minds believed they were something else, and their bodies had changed to match.

When the CIA came barging in, expecting to take down a team of scientists, they were ripped to shreds by monsters instead. So, the CIA burned it down. Everything. They burned down the buildings, the hospital, and acres of land around it, causing a fire that quickly grew out of control and started one of the worst fires in Arizona history (officially, it was a "lightning strike").

And as for the CIA, they learned a valuable lesson. The pursuit of knowledge and power should never come at the cost of human lives. The Wisteria project was a tragedy, a cautionary tale of what can happen when people play God.

Just kidding. The CIA never learned anything, and that's why I have many more stories to tell.
