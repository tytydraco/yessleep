I’ve never been one for posting my experiences online, but after what happened last week, I feel like I don’t have a choice. I need to get this out of my head. Maybe someone will believe me. Maybe someone will know what I’m supposed to do next because I can’t stop thinking about it.


It all started when I went back to my hometown in New Mexico. I hadn’t been there in years, but my parents still lived in the same house I grew up in, and guilt had been gnawing at me for avoiding them. It was a small, quiet desert town surrounded by endless stretches of wilderness. The kind of place where stories linger longer than the people who tell them.


One evening, during dinner, my dad mentioned the hiking trails we used to explore when I was a kid. He said they’d reopened recently and casually suggested I check them out. “But stick to the main paths,” he warned. “A lot of strange stuff happens out there.”


I brushed it off as a typical small-town superstition. Growing up, I’d heard my share of stories about weird lights, unexplainable noises, and the ever-popular skinwalker legend. It always felt like a scare tactic to keep kids from wandering too far. I’d spent hours out there as a teenager and never saw anything unusual. So, the next evening, I grabbed a flashlight and headed out just before sunset.


The trails were overgrown but still recognizable. The air was crisp, and the fading sunlight painted the horizon in warm shades of orange and pink. I took my time, letting nostalgia guide my steps, until I reached a fork in the path I didn’t remember. One direction led uphill, toward the ridges overlooking the valley. The other curved downward, following the sound of rushing water.


The river wasn’t on the original trail map, but the sound of water was strangely inviting. I figured it might be worth exploring. I turned my flashlight on, even though the fading twilight still offered some visibility, and started down the slope.


The air grew colder the closer I got to the river, and the trees became denser, their gnarled branches arching overhead like a tunnel. The sound of water grew louder, echoing off unseen rocks. Something about it felt… off. The rushing water had an uneven cadence, like it was stuttering. My footsteps, too, seemed to echo strangely—just slightly out of sync with my movements, like something was walking a beat behind me. I kept stopping to listen, but every time I did, the forest fell completely silent.


When I reached the riverbank, the sight was both beautiful and eerie. The water reflected the pale moonlight, shimmering as it flowed over jagged stones. But the landscape didn’t feel right. The trees along the bank seemed unnaturally twisted, their trunks warped as if they’d been bent by unseen hands. The air smelled metallic, sharp and out of place. That’s when I noticed the tracks.


They were in the mud near the edge of the river—huge, elongated prints. At first glance, they looked human, but something was off about the proportions. The toes were too long, the heel too narrow, and they sank deeper into the mud than any person’s weight could justify. I crouched down to get a closer look, and that’s when I heard it.


A voice. My voice.


“Help me.”


It came from the other side of the river, low and rasping, but unmistakably my own. I froze, my heart hammering in my chest. It wasn’t an echo. It wasn’t the wind. It was me, calling out from somewhere in the trees.


“Help me,” it said again, louder this time, a desperate, broken plea that sent chills down my spine. The flashlight trembled in my hand as I scanned the opposite bank, the beam cutting through the darkness. That’s when I saw it.


It was crouched near the water’s edge, its pale, sagging skin catching the light. At first, I thought it was a man, but the longer I stared, the less human it became. Its limbs were unnaturally long, bent at strange angles like a marionette with tangled strings. Its head hung low, the face obscured by matted hair, but I could feel its eyes on me—black, soulless pits that seemed to drink in the light.


“Help me,” it said again, but this time its mouth moved, and the words didn’t match the sound. The voice was still mine, but the thing’s lips jerked open and closed like a bad animatronic. The pauses between the words were wrong, fragmented, as if it was struggling to piece them together. “Help… me,” it croaked again, dragging out the last syllable.


It stood then, rising to its full, impossible height, its head nearly grazing the branches overhead. The skin around its joints cracked and stretched as it moved, like it was wearing a suit that didn’t fit.


I stumbled backward, my foot catching on a root, and fell hard into the mud. The flashlight slipped from my grip, rolling a few feet away. In the chaos, I looked back across the river, but the thing was gone.


My breath came in ragged gasps as I scrambled to my feet, searching the treeline with shaking hands. The forest was silent now, even the sound of the water seemed muffled. Then I heard the crunch of gravel behind me.


It was on my side of the river.


I didn’t look back. I couldn’t. Every instinct in my body screamed at me to run, so I did. I tore through the trees, branches whipping at my face, the flashlight beam bouncing wildly ahead of me. Behind me, I heard it crashing through the underbrush, its movements uneven and wet, like something crawling and stumbling all at once. And then it began to mimic me.


It called out my name, over and over, in my voice. “Come back! Please!” it wailed. “Wait… for me!” The desperation in its tone was uncanny, like it was trying to crawl inside my head, to make me feel sorry for it.


I don’t know how I made it back to the main trail. I don’t remember the details. I just remember the relief of seeing my car in the distance and the sheer terror of hearing its footsteps growing louder. I dove into the driver’s seat, locking the doors and starting the engine in one motion. As I peeled out of the parking lot, I caught a glimpse of it in the rearview mirror. It was standing in the middle of the trail, its head tilted at an unnatural angle, watching me. Its mouth hung open, that horrible grin stretched wide across its face.


And then it waved.


I don’t know how I made it home that night. My hands were shaking so badly I almost crashed twice. I spent the night sitting in the corner of my bedroom with the lights on, clutching a baseball bat like it would make a difference.


The worst part came the next morning. When I opened my front door, my flashlight was lying on the porch. It was clean, I’d seen it fall into the mud when I tripped, rolling down the slope toward the riverbank. There was no way it should have been here—clean, spotless—like it had never left my hand.


I haven’t gone back to the trails since, and I don’t think I ever will. But sometimes, late at night, I hear something outside my window—a soft knock, followed by the sound of my own voice, begging me to let it in.

I didn’t sleep much after that night. Even with the lights on, even with the bat clutched in my hands, I couldn’t close my eyes without hearing that soft knock on the window or the distorted echoes of my own voice calling out to me. Every sound outside—branches brushing against the house, a coyote howling in the distance—set my nerves on edge. I started to question what was real and what was in my head. But I didn’t dare look out the window.

The knocking didn’t come every night. Some nights were eerily quiet, which almost made it worse. At least with the knocks, I knew where it was—or thought I did. On the quiet nights, I could feel it watching me, its presence like an unseen weight pressing against the walls of the house. I kept every door locked, every curtain drawn, and the flashlight within arm’s reach. It wasn’t enough.

Three nights after my encounter, I woke up to something new: the sound of footsteps on the roof. Slow, deliberate footsteps, like someone—or something—was pacing back and forth. My bedroom is on the second floor, so it was right above me. The ceiling seemed to creak with every step, each one sending a chill down my spine. I gripped the bat tighter, my breathing shallow, trying to convince myself it was just an animal. But deep down, I knew better.

“Let me in.”

The words were muffled, coming from somewhere above. It was my voice again, but weaker this time, like it was strained or dying. The footsteps stopped directly above my bed.

“Please… I’m cold.”

It spoke again, but this time it wasn’t just my voice. There was something else beneath it, like a guttural growl trying to mimic human speech. I clamped my hands over my ears and squeezed my eyes shut, willing it to stop, willing it to go away. The pacing resumed, faster now, erratic, like it was angry. And then it was gone.

Morning brought no comfort. There were no signs of footprints on the roof, no damage, nothing to prove I wasn’t losing my mind. But the smell—that metallic, coppery tang—still lingered faintly in the air. It was the same smell from the river, the same smell that clung to the skinwalker. It was real. And it wasn’t leaving.

I thought about telling someone, but what would I even say? No one would believe me, not without seeing it for themselves. Even then, would they? I debated leaving town, driving as far away as I could, but I had this gnawing feeling that it wouldn’t matter. It had found me once. It would find me again.

That afternoon, I decided to confront it. Not because I was brave, but because I was desperate. I needed to know if it was real, if it was still watching me, or if I was losing my grip on reality. I waited until dusk, when the shadows were long and the air carried that faint metallic edge. I left the house with my flashlight and bat and started walking toward the river.

The town was quiet as I made my way out to the trails. Too quiet. No dogs barking, no cars passing by, not even the faint hum of insects. Just my own footsteps crunching against the gravel. By the time I reached the trailhead, the sun had dipped below the horizon, leaving me alone in the dark with only the beam of my flashlight to guide me.

As I moved deeper into the woods, the air grew colder, heavier, like the forest was holding its breath. I could feel it watching me, even before I saw it. My flashlight flickered as the sound of rushing water grew louder, and I knew I was close. But I wasn’t prepared for what I saw when I reached the riverbank.

It was standing in the middle of the water, partially submerged, its head tilted at that unnatural angle. The moonlight caught its pale, sagging skin, making it almost glow. Its eyes—black, endless pits—locked onto me as soon as I stepped into view.

“Why?” I managed to choke out. My voice sounded small, pathetic, even to me. “What do you want?”

It didn’t move at first. It just stared, its expression unreadable. Then it smiled. That same horrible, too-wide grin that stretched its face like a rubber mask.

“You,” it said, its voice layered and distorted, shifting between my own and something inhuman. “You brought me here.”

I don’t remember running. I don’t remember much at all after that, just fragmented flashes of terror. The crashing sound of branches behind me. The flashlight flickering wildly as I sprinted down the trail. The growing realization that no matter how fast I ran, it was keeping pace, its footsteps uneven and wet, always just out of sight.

When I finally broke out of the woods and into the edge of town, I felt like I’d crossed an invisible boundary. The air felt lighter, cleaner, and the oppressive sense of being watched lifted, if only slightly. I didn’t stop running until I reached the first lit building I could find—a gas station on the outskirts of town.

The clerk gave me a strange look as I stumbled inside, gasping for breath, covered in sweat and dirt. I tried to explain what had happened, but the words wouldn’t come. All I could manage was, “Please… don’t let it in.”

I stayed there for hours, too scared to leave, too scared to tell the full story. The clerk humored me, locking the doors and keeping an eye on the windows, though he clearly thought I was crazy. At some point, I must have fallen asleep in one of the plastic chairs near the counter.

When I woke up, the gas station was empty, the doors unlocked, the lights flickering. I was alone.

And that metallic smell was back.

The faint sound of footsteps echoed outside the door, slow and deliberate. I held my breath, praying it wouldn’t come inside. And then the lights went out.

If anyone has heard of something like this, please let me know. I don’t know how to make it stop, and I’m running out of places to hide.
