He was just a guy. A regular guy. You probably wouldn’t have noticed him if you passed him on the street.

When I looked at him, though, I could see he was an angel, a sweet fruit that god made just for me. He had the kind of warmth that could make everyone feel comforted and safe just by walking into the room. Getting hypnotized by those soft, blue eyes was like floating in a warm pool filled with cuddly otters while you're being served cake and ice cream on your birthday. Every single person felt like the center of his attention when he was around and it seemed so effortless for him to be adored.

That’s why I deserve what happened to me after I killed him.

I really just couldn’t help myself; his kind has always been my favorite. All that selfless energy going unappreciated by the world can leave a person desperate for someone to notice, longing to be held, begging for a moment calm. That blood practically pours itself down your throat when you bite down and then radiates the feeling of deep comfort and warmth through every artery and synapse in your body for days as you digest all that goodness and love that everyone else took for granted.

He didn’t see it coming. They never do. He should have been thankful, really; I gave him way more time with me than I’d given any of the others. He kept me entertained, he was funny and cute and I really just lost track of time. What’s a year or three when you can’t even count the centuries anymore? He was just fun to be around and so full of that delicious warmth that I could feel it pulsing from him just by being near him and his velvet touch made my skin respond with intoxicating electricity.

Looking back, I don’t know why I didn’t just let this be good enough. If I had it in me to live like this with him, why did I have to take more? I wasn’t even hungry. I was happy. I think he was happy too. It didn’t have to end this way.

It was our anniversary and we’d gone to the restaurant he’d taken me to on our first date. Watching the sunset reflected in his eyes filled my soul up so full it felt like I was overflowing and I just couldn’t bear the thought of anyone else seeing those beautiful eyes or the warmth of his presence being wasted on someone else. Just his laugh could lift a whole party and suddenly I felt nauseated by the very idea that anyone else gets to feel this feeling he gives me too. None of them could ever appreciate his essence the way I do.

It was like instinct took over and another beast came out to hunt. I saw the way the bartender tucked her hair behind her ear and smiled at him when he ordered our drinks. She sobbed and cried and desperately tried to trick me when I caught her by the back door on her break. “I’m jUsT DoiNG mY jOb. GuYS giVe YoU bEtTer TiPs iF YoU fLiRT”. Bitch couldn’t fool me. I could still feel the way his warmth lingered on her mind.

I’d spent so much time focused on \*him\* that I must have forgotten what good blood even tasted like because I couldn’t even stop myself as I gorged on her menthol flavored throat. Or maybe I was just desperate to taste a pathetic little crumb of his warmth on her…

But she just made me feel empty instead…

All that golden energy I was just overflowing with was gone and I was covered in blood and standing alone in the alley behind an expensive restaurant holding the limp body of what used to be a bartender. I didn’t even feel the pop when her neck snapped. I hadn’t been that rough with my food since I was a child. How embarrassing. I pulled up a manhole cover and tossed her into the storm drain with a wet thud. Someone else’s problem now.

I couldn’t let him see me like this so I texted him that I was feeling sick and took a cab home. The driver asked if my costume party was fun and I just quietly nodded. I’m glad not everyone can smell blood because my last kill was still making me nauseated and I wasn’t in the mood. I just wanted to get comfortable at home.

I peeled off my sticky dress and threw it into the fireplace and then stepped into the shower. I stood hypnotized as I watched the bright red streaks of what used to be the bartender spiral down the shower drain. It felt peculiar, like a piece of me was missing. I turned up the water temperature but I still felt cold. It felt like I was still homesick even though I was here in my own goddamn hot shower.

Since when does it feel so gross to feed? I forced myself to vomit up the bartender out of fear she had some sort of blood cancer. I honestly don’t even think that could hurt me but I just needed to try something. Why did she make me feel so empty? She wasn’t even worth all this anguish. Even after I rinsed everything down the drain, I still felt empty.

I crawled into bed and pulled the blanket over my head and just… sobbed. I didn’t know if it was actually happening or if I was just mimicking something I’d seen humans do until I couldn’t get it to stop no matter how hard I tried. Writhing and retching, I balled myself up and bawled my eyes out for what felt like a century before I finally heard the lock on the front door click open and the warmth came flooding back into my home.

His hands were still cold from the winter air but his gentle touch felt like a lifeboat in a storm. I pulled him onto me, still damp from the tears and the shower, and wrapped him up in my arms tighter than he probably realized I was capable of. He looked up at me with those empathetic eyes and squeaked out “did something happen?” as I squeezed the air out of his little lungs.

I eased off a little and pushed his head down onto my chest. “No,” I said sweetly as I stroked him, “I just felt sick but then I missed you once I was gone. I felt bad for leaving you there.”

“I’m sorry you felt so awful. I know we were both looking forward to tonight.” He gently kissed my collarbone and I kissed his forehead and smelled his hair. “Why don’t we make another reservation for next weekend when you’re feeling better?” I nodded with my lips still pressed against his head and sighed deeply as I felt the tension in my body dissolve.

“Do you smell something?” he asked. My eyes shot open. Terror. That cold, sick feeling. “Like wet pennies and… menthol?”

I don’t remember what happened next, I just remember feeling alone and homesick in my bed, desperately holding open the eyelids of a limp body to get one more glimpse of the eyes that used to fill me up with happiness. He must have seen the shock on my expression as I realized what I’d done because his bloody face twisted into a sympathetic gaze looking up at me as he let out one last wet, bloody sigh and whispered “See… you… soon…”

He had no idea what he was saying. Couldn’t have. No way he knew how special he was. Generations of being prey had quietly turned the tables in a way neither of us could have ever expected.

This wasn’t the way it was supposed to go. Everything was wrong. I drank this man’s golden essence. I was supposed to feel radiant right now. Overflowing, goddamnit! I couldn’t remember the moment I swallowed him for some reason but I could still taste how pure he was on my lips and I just… felt… EMPTY…

It was still right here. Every piece of him was still in this room but he was gone and all the color had been drained from the world with him.

At some point I got up and carried him to the bathtub. I’d never felt unsettled by the squishy feeling a corpse has like this but I couldn’t just leave him that way. I washed the blood off him and wrapped him up in the blanketa in bed. I wanted him to look peaceful but I couldn’t make his damn face do the thing it used to do when he laid his head down on my chest and slept. He just looked like a doll now, a husk I dressed up in his clothes and put in his bed.

I cried again for the second time in my endless life as I watched our home burn. Countless men I’ve swallowed this way and I’d never stuck around for this part before; never felt the need to say goodbye. I stood there in the cold and watched the humans deal with it until our home was just a steaming pile of memories and blood.

I didn’t try to feed again for a long time. Just the thought made me feel sick until the hunger became excruciating that I could think of nothing but the desperate need to consume someone else’s warmth. It’s Valentine’s day and I’m watching a couple get engaged on the beach from the bluffs above. My stomach’s growling and I can picture the happiness in her eyes and how he put it there but when I get down there, the scene isn’t at all what I imagined… She’s pregnant and he reeks of the sweat of another woman. This kind of happiness is fleeting. It’s a lie he tells her to feed off her warmth.

Maybe I can get a taste of that warmth if I put her out of her misery. I could comfort her as she drifts softly into me. She won’t ever have to know how much mercy I’d be giving her. I took a step toward them and suddenly, like a veil lifting, I felt his embrace from behind and I froze. The couple, lost in their own bubble, paid me no attention as I watched their moment like a statue caught mid-stride.

Years had passed since I felt this hug but I knew it was his, warm and comforting, nowhere but everywhere all at once. Arms of air. Arms of nothing. Arms of warmth and joy. I could feel them wrapped around me, firm and strong like I remember, but at the same time, I knew I was completely unbound. I could step forward. I could feed on this couple. I could feel their fleeting warmth…

But I’d have to leave these arms…

I stood there in the cold February air, lost in time like a memory that never happened. He held me for hours and no one paid any attention. The couple left. Others walked by. The sun set, the sun rose. I don’t know how long but when it was over, I didn’t feel hungry anymore. Cold again, but not hungry.

There was color back in the world again after that. Not everywhere, not like before, but I could see flickers of it once in a while. I followed the color to a park a few days later and just sat, watching the kids sort of sparkle as they played. It’s hard to describe what my eyes were seeing but it just looked warm and for the first time in my life I just wanted that warmth to stay where it was so I could admire it for a while. While it lasted.

A birthday. A picnic. A game of tag. Core memories being formed in real time in front of me. Little fireflies of color in a sea of sepia.

Then a little sparkle drifted down from somewhere and rested in my palm. It tingled with warmth and I closed my hands around it and let it radiate into me. Without words It told me and I understood that I needed to stand up and then it pulled me around the corner by the baseball dugout and that’s when I locked eyes with someone. A man, short and hairy in all the wrong ways like a toe with an ingrown nail. He was holding a speck of warmth of his own so tightly in his fist that his knuckles were white. What I saw in his eyes was less than nothing, a void that could never be filled demanding warmth but never giving.

He still had the unhinged grin of a man who thought his plan had gone off perfectly right up until I broke his wrist. The little girl asked if he was okay and I smiled warmly and told her I just needed to give my uncle a shot because he’s not supposed to be away from the hospital and sent her back to her mom.

I drug the toe man back to his ugly white van, threw him in the back and then tore the engine apart with my bare hands. Maybe I should have killed him but I knew it wouldn’t make me warm. I just left him stranded and wounded and covered in his own shit.

That night I felt him cuddle me. It was faint, but I knew it was him. A dream of a feeling of a cuddle but for the first time I slept like I did in his arms back then. When I woke up, I couldn’t feel him anymore but there was no mistaking him.

It took time but we figured it out together. His body died but he’s still there, wedged inside me, showing me the light. We speak through feelings and nudges, warmth and color. I can’t hear his voice but I know it’s really him, aware, alive and guiding me. I honor his memory now by being the person he saw in me, the person he was looking at when I was focused on the sunset reflected in his eyes.

Thousands of years of evolution finally taught a human how to kill vampires; I just wish he didn’t have to die to do it.
