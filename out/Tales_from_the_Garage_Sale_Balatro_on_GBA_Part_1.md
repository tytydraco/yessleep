I found a copy of Balatro for the Game Boy Advance at a garage sale on a blistering June morning, a small grey cartridge with a pixel-font sticker and a price tag that said “$5.” I stood there holding it, baffled; new games hadn’t come out for the GBA in almost two decades.

I’ve been writing weird stories for longer than I care to admit—enough to smell the unordinary from a mile away—and nothing about that table of outdated consoles, with its loose controllers hanging off the side, looked staged. It just looked forgotten. 

Yet the box art looked modern: 2024, PLAYSTACK STUDIOS, BALATRO. To say my interest was piqued was an understatement.

“I thought this was only on modern consoles?” I asked no one in particular, just trying to air out my confusion.

I paid the man without bargaining. He shrugged like the sort of person who’d found something in a box and couldn’t, quite frankly, be bothered to care what it was. He told me, “Found it in the attic. Thought it looked old, but the date made me question it.

Grandkids don’t come around no more to play these old things anyway.” His smile sank into his face when I asked his name, wrinkles showing his age. 

He chattered about grandchildren and the weather, then excused himself to rearrange a stack of VHS tapes. “Die Hard is not a CHRISTMAS movie!” I overheard him argue with another patron as I was leaving. He never did mention his name.

At home, I dug my old GBA out of a drawer. It smelled of dust and nostalgia, with its age being shown from the years of neglect. The cartridge slid in with a small, satisfying click, the label catching the light: BALATRO — blocky letters, an upside-down clown graphic, and underneath, in a font that belonged to a hi-res era the console shouldn’t know how to render, *© 2024 Playstack*.

Nothing like it had ever been on any official list of releases. The little plastic tab at the back—where the serial number should be—had been ground down smooth, like someone had scratched the number clean with a fingernail, leaving only the smooth and fine lines of their nail markings.

The menu screen came up with a smear of synth that sounded like half a lullaby and half a ringtone. Then one option appeared, with the title screen showing in clear display the word Balatro. 

All it said underneath was “Play.” I wondered where were the other options? I know it’s been a long time since I touched a GBA, but this title screen seemed odd.

Curiosity sated for now, I wanted to try playing the game with fresh eyes in the morning—it was getting late. The GBA’s plastic refused to release it when I tried to pull it out, my fingers scraping the groove to no avail.\\

 I found a butter knife I’d left on the table from toast that morning and attempted to pry it free, but a strand of the label tore.

“Stupid fuc—” I stopped mid-swear. Under the torn piece, the cartridge’s plastic was not grey but the same color as a dead thing—pale, almost skin like. 

When I peeled the rest of the label back, there was, beneath, an embossed name. It was not a serial number but a single word, pressed deep and invisible until the sticker was gone:

“BALATRO,” with a small jester smiling beside it that resembled the box art. Another jester, upside down, was frowning.

“What the fuck is this…” I mumbled to myself as the skin pulsed.

Then the GBA started up again without any prompting, on its own volition.

Not with the same title screen I’d seen on first start-up, but with an ominous, directed message saying, “I want to play a game,” accompanied by a laughing, disembodied head of a jester hovering overhead.
