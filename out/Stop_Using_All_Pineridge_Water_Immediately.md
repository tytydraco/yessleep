**DO NOT DRINK THE WATER.**  
Not boiled. Not filtered. Nothing. Stay away from it.

I just poured through Doc Marlowe’s notes and I need to get this down ASAP.

It isn’t bacteria.  
It isn’t algae.  
Hell, it isn’t even a virus.

Marlowe wrote that it looks like *eggs*.  
Parasitic eggs — like a tapeworm or something.  
He boiled them — they didn’t break down.  
Heat didn’t change a thing.  
Still intact.  
Still alive.

That means boiling is useless.

If you’ve been drinking it, cooking with it, brushing your teeth with it, or even bathing in it — it’s already inside you.  
In me.

That must be what this sudden sickness is.  
People complaining of fevers, headaches, joint aches… some even tingling in their fingers or brief bouts of vertigo.  
Maybe it’s a reaction to ingesting this stuff. Maybe the body is just trying to fight it. I don’t know. I’m not a doctor.  
But it lines up too neatly with what I’ve been seeing in the water.

In Marlowe’s exact words:

*“Sample resembles ova. Size irregular but consistent with parasitic class. Resistant to high temperature and typical chemical antibacterial purification treatment. Unknown origin; no comparative match in reference texts. Recommend avoidance until further study.”*

Avoidance.  
Not treatment.  
Not caution.  
*Avoidance*.

I don’t know what we’re up against.  
And I don’t know what’s worse — that these things survive boiling and water treatment, or that a doctor with decades of experience can’t even identify them.

The clinic was empty. Quiet. Blinds down, like they left in the middle of the night.  
He only left me those notes, right where he said.  
Proof I wasn’t losing my mind.  
Enough to tell me he believed me.  
And then… nothing.  
He and his family are gone. Gone before they get infected.

Now I’m alone again.

As for the Board? Silent. No messages. No warnings. Not even a knock on my door.  
Maybe I’m out of their way now — the “crazy guy” who got suspended.  
The one nobody listens to.  
That company-wide memo worked.  
Even leaked into the public eye.  
My coworkers won’t talk to me. People in town avoid me. They think I’m paranoid, gone off the deep end.

And maybe that’s all it is.  
Or maybe… maybe they want it that way.  
The hospital too, quick to wave everything off as “just the flu.”  
They must know more than they’re saying. Unless they really don’t. God, I don’t know anymore.

Marlowe confirmed it.  
I was right.  
There’s something in the water, and it doesn’t die during treatment.

That also means something is putting a constant stream of this stuff into the water supply, right?  
I don’t know where it’s coming from, but it has to be upstream.  
Somewhere feeding into the reservoir, into the plant, into every tap in Pineridge.  
That means it’s in every home already.  
Oh god.

If you’re reading this, don’t wait.  
Don’t trust the Board.  
Don’t trust the hospital.  
Don’t wait for someone in a suit to tell you it’s safe.  
Stop using the tap water entirely.  
Find another source. Bottled, rainwater, anything.

This is real. This is happening.

I don’t know what to do.  
But I have to do something.  
It seems I’m the only one who can right now.

I’ll report back as soon as I know more.  
But for now:

**Stay away from the water.**  
**Stay away from Pineridge.**
