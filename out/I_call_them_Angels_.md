There is a misconception regarding the paranormal. 

We often humanize things we can’t understand to make ourself feel at ease, at least you can understand the idea of a person living on after death. It gives you a sense of control and strangely , a sense of normalcy. Ouija boards and ghost stories give us a strange sense of comfort since it allows us to understand something that fundamentally contradicts our understanding of the world. For instance, what’s more terrifying? If you left a glass in your room and while you weren’t looking your dead grandma moved it into the kitchen, or if it just DID that. Nothing to humanize or understand, it just happened? 

Any story our minds can make up is far more terrifying than a translucent dead woman trying to do our dishes for us eh? And this opens up other questions. What if next time I look away it transports into my gut? What if it shatters unexpectedly? What if the contents of the glass are replaced with gasoline? It’s unlikely grandma can or would do those things. Our stories limit the things that thump in the night. Our stories of are meant to comfort us, not scare us. 

Now I grew up in a decaying city as deep in the rust belt as you can imagine. Abandoned factories that once rang with hammers on steel emptied, now nothing more than another spot for their teenage children to get drunk at. Strangely I always found the landscape of the abandoned industrial district rather charming. The weeds breaking through the gaps in concrete, rusted “no trespassing” signs hung over a broken gate, tattered American flags flying over buildings nobody has visited in ages. The rotting city never bothered me, but there was something always deeply wrong about this place. I’ve never believed in the paranormal but I’m not suborn enough to ignore the strangeness of it all. 

Before I tell these stories I want to touch on something, you know how in horror movies everyone complains about when something strange happens the protagonist seems to desire to put themselves in harms way? Like “oh look that door opened on its own for no reason let’s go investigate”? I find this to be a valid critique of horror films because nobody investigates that shit here. If you are in the woods and a deer is staring at you on its hind legs you turn and walk in the other direction. There is no discussion, you always get the feeling and you fuck right off. I’m known for being curious and impulsive and even I know when it’s the time to dip. So my apologizes for many of these stories lacking detail and explanation. But I likely wouldn’t be able to tell them if I chose to seek that information.

When you’re around all this weird crap enough, you learn to not think about it much. It’s not taboo or anything, as if speaking on it will bring on unfortunate events. It’s not uncommon me and my buddies will get drunk and share our stories to pass the time. But the strange becomes mundane over a long enough period of time. The world is just strange. It’s a fact of life. You don’t spend much time talking about the weather do you? So why bother? There’s some that are more fascinated by it than others. Like Jason. When we were teenagers he was the one that didn’t listen to that gut feeling every time. He’d chase after that cat with too many legs. I mean that literally by the way. He had a notebook where he documented every last strange event, trying to understand aspects of the world that didn’t line up right. I hear the last thing he told anyone was he found something in the park, his voice bubbling with excitement. Then he was gone. There was a search of course, but that was that. As I said, the people who have stories are the ones that are smart enough to walk away. Once it was clear he was gone, we walked away from that too. Every now and then someone will mention they think they saw him in that park. Always peaking behind one of the trees with a goofy grin on his face. But we just let him be. Hopefully he found what he was looking for.

We all had names for it, my buddy James called it “Weird Awkward Earth” when I asked him why he didn’t call it “weird wacky world” for alliteration, he would say it was intentionally to empathize the weirdness of it. To make it almost hard to say. He had a reason for thinking about it though, everywhere he went it seemed only the number 133 popped up around him. I know what you’re thinking, and no, it’s not like some of the stupid shit when people are like “I always see that number!” I mean you would glance away from a price tag and the tv that costed 149.99$ now costed 133.99$ one hell of a flash sale. We tried to use it to save some money, but the only place it worked consistently was a local burger joint.   Normally their steaks were 25$, but the menu would always show 13.33$ if he was with us. He always had his birthday there for that reason.

There’s some people that these things just happen around more often. Usually it’s pretty benign. Someone who whenever they flip a coin it shows heads, or whenever they wake up their shoes are tied. I had an ex once that physically couldn’t eat bacon. Well technically she could, but it would burn in her mouth. Didn’t matter who cooked it or provided it, if she put bacon in her mouth she would cough up ash. Just one of those things you learn to live with. 

I was pretty adventurous as a kid. Me and Jaret ran into a decent amount exploring the crevasses of this cesspool. Once we were walking on a trail at night, and we both looked at each other at the same time with panic filling our eyes, and we both bolted towards the main road. We knew the feeling and we wanted out. Once we felt safe we just started laughing for being so ridiculous, until we looked back at the trail and noticed all the signs had shifted to face us. “City sewer” signs seem much more menacing when they swivel on their own. Nowadays we make jokes that it must’ve been Jason moving them when we weren’t looking. When we walked on a frozen lake and came face to face with a murder of crows staring at us in a line, that was far more terrifying. They watched us for a month after that. I don’t want to know what they didn’t want us to see.

Honestly my experiences here make me think that some of the myths and cultural phenomena you see on the internet have a touch of truth in them. I’m sure you’ve heard of the Mandela effect. We had a similar thing happen here. We all remember small rehab center at the edge of town called “Faircrest” my sister claims she was institutionalized there for a bit. But one day it was gone. No records of it being there, only thing left was the fence surrounding it with that so so familiar “trespassing” sign. We remember my father in law working there for 15 years, and when I asked him about it, he said he just moved into town. Despite the objections from my wife, whom I grew up with. His wife choose not to think or ask about it. Smart woman. I can’t help but notice he isn’t fond of meat nowadays though. He will eat it to be polite it seems, but I can hear him vomiting it up after every meal. He still cooks an amazing burger though.

Again, best not to think about it.

That’s just now life is here though. Every few months you’ll see a car with no driver, a tree that wasn’t there before, a bug you don’t remember existing. Hell a brick from the old factory fell down my chimney a few days ago. Stamped and certified 1890. First thought that it was just the original brick, but Problem is that my house was built in the 60’s. I gave it to the historical society. Typically if you want something off your hands that doesn’t feel right they’ll take it. I’m not sure what they do with any of it. But they have a massive turnover rate. Surprising since it’s one of the only places hiring anymore.

I said that everyone has a name for whatever is going on around here. Same for me, I call them angels. 

To understand this story, it’s worth noting that me and my sister didn’t exactly have a great home life. Violence booze and drugs penetrated our lives earlier than we could talk. The strangeness of the city is far less alarming when your dad is a much more real and serious threat than mysterious footprints ever could be. And so when my parents were fighting, and we were hiding in our room, my sister asked why the windows were making faces at us, I told her they were angels. Watching over us and making sure we were safe. Dad was a staunch atheist, so when my sister said that the neighbors were replaced by angels, he laughed at her. Even as he hurriedly rushed us inside when he realized they now had webbed hands. But she still clung onto that idea. She wrote to me about the angels in jail and rehab, and she always said that as long as they were around there was some normalcy. That she knew she could continue on another day. 

She’s sober, and a mother now, and when her daughter asked her why the trees in the yard are in different places every morning, my sister told her that it was just the angels moving them around so she can witness a new view every morning.

I’m so proud of her. And as I write this, I can see Jason grinning at me from behind a tree in my yard. Normally I’d shut the blinds and go on with my day, but today I like to think he’s just proud of her too. 

He is an angel after all.
