I leave this here now as a warning to everyone who might find themselves involved with archaeological excavations in Peru, because I don't know how much time i have! It's the only thing I can do to prevent that others share my fate. It happened five years ago, when I was at a dig at a site in proximity of Sipán and my memory of the time when we made the discovery that destroyed my life is still as vivid as if it happened yesterday.

The sun dipped behind the jagged peaks of the Andes, casting a pallid glow across the excavation site. I stood amid the remnants of a Moche home, heart racing as the weight of centuries pressed down around me. For months, I had dedicated myself to this dig—this chance to unearth a lost civilization—and yet as each day unfolded, I felt something darker start to coalesce beneath the bright surface of keen curiosity and academic fervor.

The Moche were infamous for their fascinating yet macabre practices, but nothing could have prepared me for the stark reality that enveloped each excavated wall. The very essence of the Moche resonated through these skeletal remains encased in the sunbaked mud, their bones entwined with the walls, a confounding tableau that shed light on life—and death—in their world.

“Check this out!” My colleague, Sarah, called from her station, enthusiasm lacing her voice. I turned to her, momentarily distracted from the creeping unease that had begun to pool in the pit of my stomach. She knelt beside what appeared to be a crude stone slab, brushing aside dust and debris. A sharp intake of breath caught in my throat as I approached, soon to join her crouched beside the lateral section of the wall.

Protruding from the mud were fragments of bones—thin, delicate phalanges of fingers stretching out like ghastly weeds. Just as Sarah began to sweep her hand near them, I saw an unsettling glimmer shake free from the darkness in the recesses of the wall; something else, curious and horrifying.

“Wait, don’t touch it,” I cautioned, but the warning slipped from my lips too late. She brushed the surface, her fingers dancing recklessly over the fragile remains.

The moment she made contact, an unsettling sensation prickled along the back of my neck, sending shivers cascading down my spine. Sarah’s expression shifted from interest to alarm, and for a moment, all voices faded into an oppressive silence as we stared at the wall. I could’ve sworn I saw the finger bones twitch, as if responding to touch, as if life were still lodged within them.

In frantic attempts to shake off the sensation, I pulled my gaze away, wandering deeper into the excavation site. Shadows wove between the ruins, and all at once, I was enveloped in a darkness that felt sentient. I felt the cold grip of trepidation as a whispering wind slithered over the mounds, a beckoning that pulled at my mind.

Night fell quicker than anticipated, shrouding the site under an ominous veil as our lanterns flickered and cast erratic shapes against the roaring rafters of the ancient architecture. The others had retreated to camp, but my curiosity gnawed at me—a hunger beckoning me to stay, to delve deeper into the grasp of history.

I took refuge behind the crude walls, feeling the vibrations of age wash over me. I could still hear Sarah’s muffled laughter from afar, the others carrying on, unaware of the weight of the past surrounding them. I leaned in closer to the wall where the bones had protruded, their hollow presence drawing me in.

But then I heard it—a thin, rasping whisper that clawed at the edges of my hearing. I leaned closer, my ear against the cold mud, straining against the whisper as it coiled around my thoughts. The words were fractured, sporadic, but it was the familiar cadence that sent an icy tremor through my body.

“Let me out… please…”

I jerked back, heart hammering, the chill sinking through my skin as realization hit me. The voices of the damned, never laid to rest, never set free. Desperation clawed at me—what if this place was not as static as I had presumed? What if these bones were not just remnants, but a conduit for the lost souls, still trapped inside of them?

“No,” I whispered, wrestling against the creeping dread. My breath quickened, abandoning the rhythm of calm thought.

Yet, it was in that moment of panic that the very walls seemed to pulse, like a breathing entity, and I felt the weight of unseen eyes boring into my back. I spun around to face the darkness beyond the excavation, but there was nothing—only shadows that danced along crumbled ruins.

But I felt it, a presence lurking, something that transcended the bounds of time. I could sense the bones intertwined in the walls laughing at my terror, mocking my anxious mind as it spiraled into the abyss.

“Help me…” The whisper echoed again, much closer now, wrapping around me as though the air turned to ice. I recoiled against the wall, gasping in horror as I spread my hands along the crude surface.

Then, without warning, I felt the bones shift violently, a rumble that shook the very foundation of the ruins. The once-solid structure seemed alive, the air dense with a choking sense of urgency. I stumbled backward, terror consuming my senses, and in that blinding moment of dread, I ran—fleeing from the darkness that sought to encase me.

As I burst into the open air, the feast of laughter and conversation continued, oblivious to my harrowing encounter. I collapsed on the edge of our camp, the flickering lanterns seeming to mock my fear..

In the days that followed, I struggled to articulate what haunted me—the whispers lurking in the recesses of my mind, the urgency in those bones standing sentinel over their lordship of the past. I knew I could not stay, not with the chilling call that awaited me within those ancient walls. But it didn’t matter; I was at the mercy of these cursed parts of a dark history.

Afraid to return, yet called back by the lure of something dark and powerful, I still see the Moche home in my dreams. The walls are alive; the finger bones reach toward me, seeking connection, pleading for release. Each inclusion in those kind of excavations only fuels my obsession - and every passing day deepens my trauma. In my waking hours, I try to find the strength to escape, but the darkness whispers alluringly, promising a soon end of my terrors.

And deep down, I know what I once sought to unearth will become my very grave.
