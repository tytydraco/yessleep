They aren’t an object— I know that’s what you’re probably thinking. That “flashlight goggles” sounds like some crappy headlamp you wear on your face instead of your brow. It’s not anything like that, though—at least, I don’t think so. That’s not what the evidence seems to point to… Maybe I’m freaked out about this for no reason, and I hope I’m not wasting all of your guys’ time with what I have. I’ve never made a post of this manor anywhere online before and I really don’t know how to go about what I’ve found, so bear with me if I’m a little disorganized with my thoughts. I guess none of what I’ve said so far even makes any sense without context, however, so perhaps I should stop rambling and get to the point.

What I've done can get me in some serious trouble—I’m talking prison time and a hefty fine to tag along with it—so there may be a few details of my story that are left intentionally vague. I apologize for that in advance.

The bottom line that you need to know is this:

I work as a property officer for the US government at a forensics lab, meaning I receive, store, and all-around handle evidence admitted into federal cases and investigations. My job is to keep it safe while it’s not being used for forensics or court cases, as well as keeping track of where it goes when checked out.

I enjoy my job and have been at it for a few years now. It’s always interesting to see different pieces come and go; hearing the cases they’re tied to and guessing if they’ll really decide a man's fate or prove to be a useless piece of scrap. While maybe a little morbid, there’s admittedly something a little fun about being able to play detective myself from the storeroom. Puzzling together my own story behind a case I’m not getting all the info to. Imagining the journey that an incriminating piece of hair had to take to end up in a plastic prison at my doorstep.

 Sometimes it’s not so fun, though. Sometimes you get things like a stuffed animal covered in blood. Things like children’s clothes sent straight over from the morgue… The stories behind those are never amusing to imagine. They’re only sickening and all too disheartening…

What came to me the other day was, unfortunately, something like this, although it wasn’t a toy or piece of clothing. It was a notebook.

Part of my duties as a property officer is disposing of evidence once the case has closed and enough time has passed for the object in question to be considered of no further use. There are several ways that this process happens, but for our station in specific, we have an incinerator in the basement that we simply burn it away with. It’s not often that evidence is destroyed, but when it is, it usually takes the better part of a day. We get a list of all our “dead objects” then take it all at once to be burned. It was a few days ago when I was scheduled to complete this process for the month.

That day's pile was huge, burning through (quite literally) most of my shift. It wasn’t until I was down to the last few scraps, though, that the child’s book found its way into my hands. It was small and light blue, sporting Blue’s Clues on the cover. Written across the front in the best script a child could manage was *Roxy’s Adventure Dairy.*

Despite knowing what holding this object entailed, I couldn’t help but smile at the misspelled “Diary”, so innocent and sweet. I strummed my fingers across the edge of the stained pages, hearing the chorus of age played with each parchment crackle. The thing had clearly seen a lot of use. Normally, it’s only my job to toss things into the furnace and move on—never am I supposed to prod around with evidence. I had been having a particularly heavy day, though, and even though I knew the tiny book might only add more weight with it’s grim context, it had made me smile once already. I wanted to know if there was any other droplets of joy still soaked into those well-loved pages.

The diary had most of its sheets used—a little over half—among which contained the logs of what seemed to be a young girl with quite the imagination. All of it was about what you’d expect. Nonsensical tales of her day-to-day life, doodles and drawings that could pass as a Rorschach test if you squinted enough, and of course, every small thought and blurb that popped into little Roxy’s head.

It was hard to read—the kid couldn’t have been very old considering the handwriting and spelling errors. The whole thing really did brighten my day, though, reading about how much the girl loved her family and watching her discover all the little unknown intricacies life has to offer.

That lasted until I reached the last few entries.

Around the middle of the journal, the pages of Roxy’s scribbles and scrawling abruptly cease, ending with only a few logs that notably differ from the rest. The kid is young, but pick away at the ‘childese’ enough and one can easily find a coherent story within. What she learned in school that day, what snacks she ate at lunch, what toys she played with when she got home. The last entries of this journal, however, are not as easy to follow.

They tell a story, but it’s one that’s seemingly clouded by the lens of a child, and given its content and the fact that it ended up in my locker, I’m worried that it might be recounting something much more sinister than merely a bad dream…

When I first stumbled my way through them, trying to clamber over the misspelled words and broken grammar, I began to convince myself that the journal must not have been written by a kid at all. That the whole thing must have been some elaborate prank gone wrong by a group of teens, or a cover up piece linked to an actual crime. The more I thought about that theory, however, the more impossible it became. The patterns of the girl’s spelling errors were too consistent, and the script in which she wrote was just too authentically rough.

I set the thing aside for a while as I began burning the rest of my pile. I couldn’t tell you why. The investigation linked to the book was already long done and over with if it had ended up in that basement with me. Still, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Something impossibly wrong with its content compared to anything else I had ever received. Maybe I had translated it wrong, I thought. Maybe I was freaking out over nothing, and it was simply the overactive imagination of a child. That reassurance may have been enough to satiate my rationale; however, my curiosity was still starved. And so, when I reached the end of my evidence pile, and only the notebook remained, I did something I’ve never done in all my years of working at the locker.

I snuck it out and took it home.

I needed more time with it. I had to figure out for sure what the pages said, because if they were truly saying what I thought they were, then the words within held some terribly disturbing implications. After several hours of transcribing, I believe that I do have an accurate translation, but the final product only leaves me more confused than before, and those disturbing revelations a little more threateningly real.

That’s why I’ve brought this all to you. From what I understand, this forum is for people to share stories that fall outside the realm of the known. That you all understand strange things like this in a way that I just don’t. I think what I have might be something that falls into that category.

Below I’ve written out my full transcript of the diary's first strange entry. I have done my best to correct spelling mistakes and also added some punctuation in order to make things a little easier to read. Rest assured, however, that what I’ve included has been entirely unaltered otherwise. I haven’t tweaked wording or grammar; this is exactly how Roxy, whoever she was, told her tale:

*Daddy is driving very fast. He's going faster than a policeman would like, I think. I tell him to be careful because there are lots of other cars in the road , but he says it's okay. They aren't moving like we are. I think they must have gotten tired and stopped to sleep since its night time. I feel tired too. Mommy and Daddy don't ever let me stay up this late. That's okay though because I don't like the dark. It's scary.*

*I asked Daddy if I could have a flashlight since it's so dark, but he told me no and that it isn't allowed right now. He says it's too late to be shining lights around. I asked him why all the other adults outside are allowed to have flashlights, but he told me it's because they are bad people who are breaking the rules. He says I need to stay away from them. I don’t know why they are bad people just because they are scared of the dark, but I hope that doesn’t mean I’m a bad person too.*

*Daddy’s hands are covered in red paint that smells funny. Mommy would be very mad at him for getting paint all over the car, but she’s not with us right now. Lucky Daddy. I asked him where mommy and Abby are, but daddy didn’t answer. I asked him again, and he said that they were already on their way to vacation while we go get uncle Charles and aunt Sarah. He said we’ll see them later.*

*There are a lot of bad people out with flashlights right now. I see them on the side of the road and in the houses. They look like they’re looking for someone.*

*Daddy said I was asking too many questions and that I should write in my diary so that's what I'm doing. It's hard to write with daddy driving so fast though. With how fast we go, we’ll make it to Uncle Charles’ house very soon, I think.*

*The people outside are walking around on sidewalks and in front yards and they all turn and shine their flashlights at us while we zoom. I can see them better now that they are closer to the car. They aren’t holding flashlights like I thought. They’re wearing flashlight goggles! Flashlight goggles are a good idea because then the light goes wherever you look, and you can still use both hands. If I had a pair of flashlight goggles right now, it would be a lot easier to write in my diary.*

 *The light shines out from their eyes in bright beams that hurt to look at. Some of the goggles have two beams, but some only have one. I think they need to change the lightbulb. All of their faces look messy like they fell in a mud puddle, and their clothes are dirty too. I wonder why they don’t go change their shirts and pants, but maybe whoever they’re looking for is important and they can’t take a break to go do that.*

*I ask Daddy who they’re looking for, and he tells me again to stay away from them. He says if they see me, they’ll get really angry that I’m out so late and try to catch me, so I should run if they start chasing me. Now I’m writing on the floor of the car so they don’t see me in the window.*

*The people with flashlight goggles make funny noises that I don’t like. It sounds how Abby did when she still had her crib and would cry. I ask Daddy if the people are crying, but he doesn’t answer. I think they must be crying because they’re scared for the person they’re looking for. I hope the person is okay so that they’ll stop. Mommy had been crying earlier too, but Daddy said she’s okay now and that I shouldn’t worry. I asked him why she was crying, but he didn’t answer that question either. I think it must have been because of Abby.*

*Abby woke me up when she went to go get mommy. She isn’t a big girl like me, so she doesn’t know how to use the potty without help. I stayed in my bed because I was tired, but I heard her and Mommy go into the bathroom. I heard them talking through the walls because Daddy says they’re too thin. That’s also why he tells Abby and I to be quieter when we play sometimes.*

*I heard the toilet flush, but then Mommy screamed really loud. Abby yelled also, but hers didn’t last as long as Mommy’s. Mommy called Daddy’s name, but then there was a loud bang against the wall and she stopped talking. Me and Abby have a night light in our room, but even with it there, Mommy’s scream still scared me, so I just hid under the covers. Daddy came out of his room and he ran straight to the bathroom.*

*I heard Daddy say some naughty words and then more loud banging against the walls. That’s when I heard Mommy’s crying. Abby too. I was so scared but I peeked out of my covers anyway because I was so worried and called for Daddy. He seemed really mad because he yelled at me to stay in my room and to not come out. I just went back under the covers to hide some more.*

*There was even more banging and yelling from Daddy, but the crying from Mommy was getting quieter. I heard her and Daddy go down the hallway toward the kitchen in a hurry, but Abby stayed in the bathroom. She was still crying. I called out for her since I was worried, but I stayed under the covers because I was still so scared. I heard her start walking back to our room, but she stopped in the door. She had a flashlight and was shining it all over. I knew because I could see light against the blanket sometimes. She wasn’t talking and was still crying, so I called her name again. I was still so worried. She started to move toward my bed, but then daddy ran back down the hall from the kitchen. I heard him stomp into my room like he was angry, and he must have grabbed Abby because her flashlight started spinning all over the room.*

*I almost peeked out my blanket because Abby made a funny sound. It was like the sound she used to make when she was littler and would throw up. I wanted to know what Daddy was doing, but he told me not to look. I stayed under the blanket. Then I heard daddy and Abby leave, but I think Daddy must have been carrying Abby. Maybe it was to sleep in his and mommy’s bed because that’s what Abby does when she’s scared. Daddy didn’t come back for a bit though, so I disobeyed him and looked out. Please don’t be mad at me if you read this, Daddy.*

*Abby made our room very messy. The floor was all wet and dark and smelled funny which I wasn’t happy about because that meant mommy would make us stay awake until she cleaned it. Abby and Daddy were both gone but I could hear him in the hallway next to my room. He was breathing hard, and it sounded like he was crying. His was quieter than Mommy and Abby’s, though.*

*I called out for daddy, and asked if he was okay, but he didn’t answer. I heard him stand up and come back to my room, and he seemed in a much better mood than a little bit ago when he was angry. He told me I could come out, and when I did, he gave me a big hug and lots of kisses. His body was all shaky, so he must have been cold. I asked him why he was covered in mud but he just told me that it was red paint. I asked him where the paint came from but he didn’t answer. It smelled funny like paint does, though, so I believed him.*

*Daddy told me to stay in my bed while he went to go get his phone and when he came back, he shut my door and locked it. I asked where Mommy and Abby were, and told him that Abby would not be able to get back into the room if the door was locked, but he told me they went to lay down in his bed, and that I should be very quiet since they were sleeping. Daddy used his phone to make a phone call, but the person he was calling must have been sleeping because I don’t think they answered. He kept trying to call people over and over, but when they didn’t answer he got angry again and said more naughty words. Daddy went to the window to look outside the curtains and something out there made him have an idea.*

*He told me we were going to go for a drive. I asked him where we were going, and I was excited because I never get to be up so late. Daddy told me that we were going to go on a vacation where we would leave our house and not come back for a long time. That made me sad because all of my favorite things are at my house. I was happy again though because he told me Uncle Charles and Aunt Sarah would be there too, and that we were going to go visit them right now. That’s where we’re driving to right now.*

*Daddy made me get dressed while he looked out the window some more. When I was done, he put me in my jacket and put more of my shirts and pants in my adventuring bag. I told him that Nuzzle had to stay in the bag because that’s where he sleeps, but daddy told me there was no room for him. That made me sad, but he told me I could carry him, so I am.*

*Daddy put my hood on and picked me up. He told me to close my eyes and keep them closed until we were in the car. I couldn’t see already because Daddy was holding me really tight and had my head pushed into his neck. It wasn't very comfy.*

*When we went through the house to go drive, I disobeyed Daddy again and peeked. It was so dark without my night light and very scary in the halls. There was a little light coming from the bathroom night light that was shining, so that was less scary as we went by. I could see on the floor there was more red paint and it was very messy just like my room. There was also funny little lines laying on the floor. I thought it was more mess but they were animals I think. They were all squiggly like Abby’s drawings and looked like the snakes that Daddy shows us sometimes, hiding in the garden. They were laying in water that glowed like the glow sticks Daddy let’s us play with sometimes. I thought they might slither after us but they didn’t move. I still closed my eyes again.*

*Sometimes I see things in the dark and I’m so scared that I call for Mommy because I can’t sleep. Mommy tells me not to worry, though. She says that if I look at the dark too long, I’ll see scary things in it, so I should just shut my eyes instead. I must have seen the snakes because it was so dark.*

*Daddy took me outside and ran fast to the car. He must be really excited for the vacation since he’s been going so fast. I opened my eyes when he closed the door and saw that there were other people awake like us. They all had flashlight goggles and were walking around in the street. Daddy always tells me and Abby not to play in the street or we might get hurt. I hope all of those people are okay even though they were playing in the street…*

*We’re almost to Aunt Sarah’s and Uncle Charles house now. I know because I just saw the park they take me and Abby to sometimes. I wonder if we’ll have time to play on it before we go on vacation. I don’t know if it’s allowed since it’s so late, though. Daddy looks like he’s crying again, but I think he’s getting angry at all my questions, so I don’t think I’ll ask why. I hope daddy is okay.*

 

I'm terribly sorry to leave things there, but you have no idea how long it took to transcribe this diary into something readable with all of its misspelled words and unintelligible sentences. Unfortunately, I have responsibilities in real life that are being neglected with all the time that this journal has taken up, and given the fact that stealing it was already a huge risk, I think letting it become a larger part of my life might not be healthy. Still, I hope there’s enough for you all to get the idea. Something happened to this girl, and whatever it was, it seemed like it hit the whole town around her.

Nothing I search up online is yielding anything, though—Is there any cases of areas that big in the US getting evacuated or mysteriously having accidents that caused mass death? Like I said earlier, the evidence I handle comes from a lot of different places, so this thing could have come from anywhere… I’ve never been a conspiracy theorist (working for the government, I know that's a rich statement) but could this have been some sort of cover up?

As I said before, if I had found this notebook anywhere else in the world, I probably wouldn’t bat an eye at it. I’d probably just assume that this whole thing was some elaborate joke made by some kids to freak people out. Remember, though, I work with *evidence*. Objects that are specifically collected to shed light on a real situation that actually happened.

A prank notebook wouldn’t just wind up in our locker unless there was something tied to it; especially my division. This diary just feels too real. The handwriting and the numerous normal entries before… whatever these last ones are. Am I wrong for thinking something is off about this? Sure, kids have an active imagination, but I can’t imagine a kid coming up with something so specifically strange…

If nothing turns up from this post in a few days, I may sit down to transcribe more. There’s some stuff in the later entries that have more information, I think. It’s honestly hard to tell when I’m forced to look at it through the eyes of a girl who can’t be any older than 5 or 6 years old. Either way, it might help. But from what I’ve given you so far, can anyone answer my original question?

What the hell are flashlight goggles?
