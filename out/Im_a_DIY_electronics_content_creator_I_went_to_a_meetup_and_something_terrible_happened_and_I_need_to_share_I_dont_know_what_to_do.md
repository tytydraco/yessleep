I recently had a really bad experience, and I need to share about it.



I've been attending various DIY electronics meetups for many years. My personal specialty is finding interesting new ways to use LEDs, but I love to share anything involving electronics, especially if I've never seen it before. People will work on their pet project for years, and it can be something so strange and special. I recently posted a video of a lady who made a robot that juggles ping-pong balls which didn't quite work. She'd been working on it for almost five years! I love interviewing people like this and sharing it.



This time, however, I cannot post any footage of what I saw. I can't stop thinking about it though. I don't know what else to say, but that I'm losing my mind, and I need help. I have to tell someone.



I was going to a conference on the other side of the country to film attendees for an upcoming video series that I'm working on. I went to the library to print out some imagery for my interviews, and I a flier on a cork board in restroom corridor caught my attention. It said that that night there was going to be an electronics hobbyist meetup, they were working on "super cool LED perceptual-visual interface sci-fi tech" and they wanted "collaborators and volunteers". There was a picture of a dog wearing a virtual reality headset. It looked really innocent, like it was probably made by high school students, which, to be honest, usually means it's a different version of a project I've seen many times before. However, the phrase "perceptual-visual interface" was just odd, and something about the flier made me feel like this might be a novel DIY project or at least a good interview.



I took down the address, and looked it up on my phone. It looked like a warehouse.



I went back to the conference and honestly had a really good day of filming, and then I went and got some dinner, and then I drove to the address from the flier.



I drove to a part of the city that was really run down. A lot of the streets had abandoned houses and I saw a lot of graffiti. I don't really like taking my expensive camera and microphone to places like this, but I hoped that I would end up someplace that I would feel comfortable, so I kept going.



I found the warehouse. There were no people anywhere. The building was old, and it looked like it hadn't been used for a years. I decided to leave my gear hidden under my jacket in the car until after I found where I was going. Then I decided that I wanted a more journalistic aesthetic that I'd been cultivating, so I put my audio recorder in my pocket, just in case I wanted to get some audio to play over other footage.



I didn't know where to go at first, but I found a steel security door on the side that was just open, and I walked in.



Inside, it was big and dark and dirty. I would have turned around and left right then, but I heard a voice. "Hey! You're new! Who're you?" I didn't see anyone, but then I noticed a really old webcam just sitting on the floor, the kind that was a little white plastic ball, almost like a weird eyeball. Next to it was a really old desktop computer speaker and a tiny, cheap microphone on a stand. If I had found these items at a thrift store I might have bought them for a couple dollars just because they were almost antiques.



"Hi, my name's Simon. I saw your flier. I'm a guy from out of town who likes electronics meetups, and I wanted to check this out."



"Cool!" the speaker said. "Head on back!"



I looked around.



"Back!" the voice said. "You'll find us."



I started walking. I noticed that there was a black box up ahead. As I got closer, I saw that it was an area the size of a room draped off with black sheets that were taped together. Facing me, I saw another webcam clipped to the rod at the top, and a handwritten sign that said, "GO AROUND".



Behind the sign, I found a couple people just standing there.



"Hey! You're new!" one of them said. He was a thin man with glasses. He smiled and extended his hand. "I'm James."



"Hi, I'm Tabitha," said the other person, who was a lady who was dressed somewhat professionally. They both looked like nice people.



"Hi, I'm Simon. Are you the person who posted the flier?"



"No. We're just attendees," James said.



"Is that person here?"



"I think so? I don't know," he said, and shrugged. Tabitha shrugged too.



"Well, I mean, if it's a meetup, they should be here, right? Do you have any electronics projects to share?"



"I did, at first," he said. "Yeah, I originally came to share some stuff I was working on."



"Yeah, I guess I did too. Gosh, that was a while ago! And we didn't know each other at all," Tabitha said, and they both laughed nervously. I was feeling pretty confused.

  
"And now we're friends," James said. "Well, more than friends." He and Tabitha smiled knowingly at each other.



"If you don't have projects, and they're not here, then how is this a DIY meetup?"



Simon smiled and crossed his arms. "You'll see, just hang on!"



"What's back there, behind the black sheets?"



"You can look eventually, when you're ready," James replied.



"We've been trying to get another person for a while," Tabitha said. "We're so excited that you're here!"



Then, I heard something. It sounded like a small motor.



"Here it comes!" Tabitha said.



There was another webcam and microphone attached to the upper rod on this side of the black room as well, peering down at them. Below it, at the ground, a remote controlled car came out from a mouse hole in the black room. It rolled up to us and stopped. On it sat three items that looked like small VR headsets. I picked one of them up.



It was attached to a wire that ran back to the black room. It was an old pair of the kind of cheap boxy sunglasses that fit over regular glasses. On the inside, I saw that there were a lot of tiny surface mount LEDs glued around the inside of the lens frames.



"What are they?"



"Pure bliss," Tabitha said. "You've never, ever, felt anything like this, Simon."



"You are in for the experience of a lifetime, Simon," said James. "This feels better than anything you have ever, or could ever feel. It's really... it changed my life."



"Yeah," Tabitha said. "I've been thinking about this for weeks. I keep looking for the fliers, hoping there'd be another session. We should start."



I was feeling apprehensive. I didn't know what I was getting myself into. James and Tabitha were smiling, but I felt like they were too excited about this.



"Before I put these on, I think I need to know more about this. I came here to interview people who are making electronics."



"They won't start until all of us put them on," Tabitha said. "Just trust us." She smiled again, but it wasn't exactly a happy face.



"I don't want to."



"Simon," James said. "Listen to me. This is the most... incredible thing you'll ever experience. It's going to change the world. I don't care about the rest of my life any more, honestly. Nothing else really matters once you try this. But you have to put it on. Whoever is doing this, whoever made these, they won't start it until we all put them on, and if you leave, they won't run it. I don't want to have to say this, but now that you're here, you have to do this."



"Gosh," Tabitha said, "I don't want to tell you... I really don't want to tell anyone what to do. It's not like me. I'm not normally like this, Simon, I swear. But James is right. Now that you're here, we have to all do this together, or they won't start it. Please, Simon."



"I'm not comfortable with this," I said. At this point, honestly, I was afraid. I decided that I needed to leave.



"Please, Simon! Please!" James fell to his knees on the dirty warehouse floor. "Simon! Please!"



Tabitha was wearing a nice looking green skirt. She looked like my high school chemistry teacher. She also got on her knees. "Simon please! Trust us, Simon! This is the best, the greatest thing!"



James grabbed my free hand. "Simon!" His eyes were crazy. I dropped the glasses.



"Simon be careful!" Tabitha screamed. She lunged for my glasses, crawling across the filthy floor.



"Are they broken?" James asked.



"No, no, they're fine! Simon be careful! You can't do that! If anything goes wrong they won't start it!"



"I'm leaving," I said. I pulled my hand away and started walking out.



"Simon stop!" James yelled after me. "Stop right now Simon!" I started to run.



"Stop stop stop!" Tabitha screamed.



I was running for the open door.



Suddenly I heard a loud bang. I turned and looked. James was pointing a gun at me.



"STOP!" he screamed. I froze.



"STAY RIGHT THERE!" He kept the gun trained on me as he ran over. I felt so afraid that I was cold, and I started to shake uncontrollably.



"COME WITH ME! WALK!"



I took a step forward, and he circled around behind me. "FORWARD! GO! That's it."



I started walking. "Go left, towards the back left corner over there.



I started to cry. I was shaking badly, but I did my best to walk steadily where he said.



"I didn't want to do this, Simon, but I have to show you."



Tabitha came up and walked alongside me. "Listen, Simon. If someone leaves then they won't start it. So if someone comes, and they are stupid, so stupid! And they refuse to put on the glasses with us, then we can't start. So we have to do something about it. Coming here and then not having the experience, it hurts, Simon. It hurts so bad! So we had to find a way to make sure it happens. It's awful, but we'll show you, and then you'll see that you need to join us in the experience. You won't regret it, Simon."



"You know, I'm really just a normal guy. We're both normal people who first met here to work on electronics," James said. He continued, "But this has changed me. It's really worth this, worth everything! It's like the sun is in your heart. It's the most tranquil, beautiful feeling. After the first time, I tried everything. I mixed street drugs with anesthetics and psychedelics and sex and anything I could think of. Nothing else even comes close."



"It's holy," Tabitha said. "It's my religion now."



"Yeah," James said. "That's kind of a good way to put it. I don't know, maybe if I meditated for decades I could get there."



"I doubt it," Tabitha said.



We were approaching a doorway to a smaller room. I began to notice a really bad smell.



"Okay, Simon, listen," James said. I don't want you to freak out. I just want you to see that we're serious. We're just going to look, okay? You see, you weren't the first person who came here and didn't want to join in."



"Stay calm, stay calm," Tabitha said.



We approached the doorway and I looked inside. It was a smaller room. On the floor I saw figures. Looking closer, I clearly saw that one of them was a bloated corpse with maggots on the face. The smell coming from the room was vile, overwhelming. 



"Okay, Simon, let's turn and walk back. Listen carefully, and stay calm. Don't run. Let's just walk back to the glasses, okay?"



I turned to the right, and started to walk back towards the black room, to the glasses.



"Don't run. Just listen to me, and stay calm. Those are people. I mean they were people. Those were people who came here and they just wouldn't listen. Those are four people who I shot. I killed them with this gun. I did that because if they came and left without joining us, then the experience wouldn't start, Simon. They won't start it if anyone leaves. But if they die, then, Tabitha and I still get to have the experience. I killed them, because that's how important this is, Simon. You understand, Simon, we're normal everyday people, Tabitha and me. You get that, right? But this is just that important. So, now that you know that, now you're going to join us, okay?"



"Okay," I said.



"You're doing really good, Simon. I met James here, and we haven't found anyone else yet. I wish there was another way to do this."



"You said you're a visitor, right?" James said. "I guess you're going to have to move here after this." Tabitha laughed.



"I'm so happy we're about to start!" Tabitha said.



I'm not a fighter. I've never been in a fight, and frankly, I have no idea how to fight at all. If I ever had to fistfight I'd probably get destroyed. But something came over me. I didn't even think, it just happened. And if it had gone slightly wrong, I'm sure I'd be dead.



I pulled the audio recorder out of my pocket, and I spun around and threw it at James. It hit him right in the head, and he almost fell over. Then I ran up and I kicked him in the stomach, and he fell over. Then I turned and pushed Tabitha over as hard as I could. Then I turned and I kicked James in the head as hard as I could. Then I turned and I ran as fast as I have ever run in my life for the door to the outside. I heard Tabitha screaming. Thinking of action movies, I started jumping left and right as I ran. I heard the gun fire. Then I got to the door, and I was outside, and I got in my car, and I started it and I started driving. I drove off the curb and I hit the median berm and I just kept going. I drove away at freeway speed.



I kept going until I was in a normal part of town. I actually ran a couple stop signs, but no one noticed. I kept looking behind me, and I was sure no one was following me, but I drove back to the airport.



I had been crying the entire time, but I didn't care. I just wiped off my face and I returned the car and I got a flight and I left.



I haven't told anyone, because I'm afraid. I don't know who made those glasses, or if they know who I am, or anything about them. I've gone back over what happened a thousand times in my head. I don't feel bad about anything I did. I don't care how badly I hurt James. But I can't stop thinking about what happened. Overall, it doesn't make any sense. But I have to tell someone, even if it's risky, because I don't know what to do any more.



If the audio recorder is working, then someone could figure out who I am from that. I have literally hundreds of videos online. I'm all over the internet. I do things to hide my identity, but I'm sure it's not perfect.



I can't even make myself go outside any more. I keep looking out my window, thinking someone's going to come to my home when I'm asleep, or something. I don't know what was behind the black curtain, who or what they are, or what they can do. Obviously the flier was designed to look innocent, so there's no clues there. It could be one person, or a company, or an entire government. I have no way of knowing. I don't know if they care or not. I don't know anything. It's just a black box.



What should I do?
