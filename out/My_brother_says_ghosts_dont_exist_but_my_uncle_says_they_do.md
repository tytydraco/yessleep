“Ghosts don’t exist.”

My uncle, a man whose blue, wrinkled eyes had already seen everything, carefully rested the metal cutlery on the white plate, reflecting the yellowish light of the lamp above our table.

He chewed a few more times, calmly.

Then he began:

At the time Hellborn was founded, I arrived there with nothing but a suitcase and a few cents in my pocket.

I wanted to explore the world, but instead I found that hole, where I stayed for a few months.

Back then, the place was called Port Beacheo, before it was given the name Hellborn, which came from the inexplicable events that occurred there.

Its land was filled with trees, with a minimal population, composed mostly of indigenous people.

I rented a small house made of dark wood, using candles to light the place.

I survived on small jobs, which was enough to live, but not enough to quench my thirst for adventure.

I was beginning to adapt to that routine of rainy days, strange looks, and inexplicable happenings when a proposal reached me: a job as a construction watchman.

I did not question it when the offer came to me, spoken by an elderly man. I simply took my hat, placed it on my head, put my gun at my waist, and set off for the site.

It was a house under construction.

A wealthy couple wanted to move into the region.

Mr. Kim, a young man of thirty-one, with black hair streaked with a few white strands, wearing simple clothes, came to meet me.

He handed me half the amount for supervising the first month. I flipped through the bills with a dirty finger, a smile forming on my lips.

Over the days, everything went well. I walked around the poorly built house, a hammock tied to the wooden pillars of the unfinished porch, in case I felt sleepy.

I watched the stars in the clear sky. A half-smoked cigarette rested between my fingers, the wind ran through the place, making the sound of creaking wood blend with the rustling of leaves in the trees.

A thud.

Footsteps echoed through the place. I turned, my hand going to the revolver at my waist.

I let the cigarette fall to the ground.

All my senses sharpened toward that sound.

Someone was there.

I walked slowly, avoiding stepping too hard so as not to scare off the intruder.

Hellborn, at that time, was not known for being a safe place.

Muggings, robberies, and strange happenings were common there.

That was when I saw her.

A small little girl, half her body hidden behind the house. Her eyes were black holes, contrasting with her long black hair and her white, almost pale skin. She wore a white dress that nearly blended into her skin.

I leaned forward, trying to appear less intimidating to that thing.

The small being only watched me for a few seconds before turning away and running toward the back.

I followed.

I drew my gun, pointing it to the sides.

When I reached the back, I spotted the small thing at the edge of the well, her eyes fixed on me over her shoulder.

The child turned her face, resolute, and jumped.

I ran. Not away, but closer. When I reached the well, I braced my hands on the edge, looking down, eyes wide, my breathing uneven.

The being sat at the bottom of the empty, dark well, hugging her own knees, murmuring incoherent words.

Then she stopped, lifting her head upward, her large black eyes widening.

That was when something brushed past me.

A man, dressed in peasant clothes of a yellowish tone, stood beside me, holding a large white sack in his arms, stained with red marks.

My body froze.

I drew in a breath, my hand tightening on the edge.

As if unaware of my presence, he threw the sack into the well.

That was when I focused on his head.

His face was blurred.

A piercing scream echoed from inside the well.

As if a spell had been broken, I blinked, swallowing hard, my eyes returning to the inside of the well.

There was no one there. Nothing.

I left the place, staying outside the house, with a few bottles of warm liquor I had brought with me.

I drank them all.

“When I woke up, the sun was shining in the sky.” My uncle blinked, meat being crushed between his yellowed teeth.

My brother only sighed.

“Maybe you only saw that ghost because you were drunk,” he gestured, his thin voice still marked by the puberty of his fourteen years.

My uncle simply pressed harder with the knife, cutting the meat. He brought the fork to his mouth, his red tongue touching it. Then he said, “Just because you can’t see it doesn’t mean it isn’t real. Many times, we need to believe in what we have not seen.”
