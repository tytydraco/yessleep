Have you ever wondered what it's like to attend your own funeral? 

I had a first class seat. 

Six feet under the ground. 

Lying in my grave and listening to my parents say their tearful goodbyes, I was struggling through Mario 64, the flickering light of the screen my only saving grace. The last time I played it was as a kid so I was a little rusty, especially on an outdated Gameboy. 

With one arm pinned behind my back with tough rope, my body chained to the coffin, and the hollow pit I had been lowered into, I could barely get through the first few levels with one hand. There wasn't  time to register my death, or that I didn't really *feel* anything. That I didn't need to breathe because my lungs no longer craved air, and my body was more of a shell. 

I was dead and that was it. 

My coffin was too small and cramped, my feet crushed at the bottom. 

Our funeral had been going on for almost six hours. 

Six.

Sure, there were four of us. Four bodies. Four families saying goodbye. 

But six hours?

What else was there to say except, "Goodbye"? 

First, I guess I should introduce you to Chaos Head. 

We didn't even like each other. 

Imagine that. 

A band who could barely tolerate each other's existence. 

Well, we were a high school band for one. The four of us all had our reasons for being there. I was there for the extra credit for my college applications and to find a semblance of friendship. 

We were like a fucked up family. 

Sam and Maddy were bitter exes after a messy relationship in junior year, and Jordan was the unwanted comic relief. 

I didn't like our band. 

None of us liked our band. Sam was loud and obnoxious. He was a good singer and wanted everyone to know it. 

Maddy was insufferable, staying put to torture Sam (and herself), and Jordan was a quiet kid who used sarcasm as a coping mechanism, harboring comedy at inappropriate times to hide his awkwardness. For example, Sam's dog died, and he went on to strum *the dog days are over* on his guitar, toe-tapping and head banging to the beat. 

Jordan was lucky our lead singer had a semblance of a sense of humor. 

I wasn't perfect myself. I put exactly 0.1% into band practice, because we sucked… 

And I *mean* we sucked. 

Our first (and only) concert pre-death was at the sophomore homecoming dance. We were booed off the stage. Sam's vocals were all over the place, Maddy was constantly off beat on the drums, and Jordan was bad on purpose. 

I knew he could play. It was rare, since he could barely get through a performance without laughing and fucking everything up, but when he did, I found myself in awe. He was probably our best member. 

Jordan's voice was unique, and I personally thought he would make a better lead singer. I'm not saying Sam was bad. Sam was a great vocalist, and leader. Jordan, however, brought something different to the table. 

But instead of actually using his skill, Jordan hid behind sardonic humour– and was definitely afraid to accidentally upstage Sam, our so-called Golden Boy lead. Not to mention his crippling stage fright, which meant taking a step back and only offering mumbled backing vocals that sounded like he was singing against his will. 

My last day as a human was mediocre. 

I headed to practise early. The band room was kind of our safe place. 

Our school couldn't afford an actual music room or studio, so we were using an old IT room, which we had fashioned into our own. It wasn't amazing. I mean, we brought our own instruments, and Maddy’s drums were falling apart.

We did our best to decorate,  but we were four seventeen year olds with zero savings. We stuck posters on the wall, and there was an attempt at paintwork. 

Maddy tried to paint the wall loud yellow, but Sam preferred a mellow pink. 

So, our decor ended up looking like a bad Fall Guys Skin. 

With conflicting hobbies, conflicting personalities– conflicting everything, we were in a powder keg gearing up for an inevitable explosion, the breakfast club, but without the wholesome bonding. 

Sam was our Jock, Maddy was our princess, Jordan, our weirdo.

The four of us barely spoke outside of band practice. 

Madelaine Cassidy was head of the school newspaper, Jordan a household name on the basketball team, while Sam fit into the popular sphere by default because of his looks. I used our music room as an escape. I was a pretty introverted person and avoided social interaction, so it was nice to find silence away from the suffocating noise in the cafeteria. That particular morning, I didn't feel great. I had a headache brewing between my brows and a twisty feeling in my gut that wouldn't go away. 

The day prior, I'd strode straight into a bottle aimed at my head. 

It was supposed to hit Sam, but he had good dodging skills. 

That morning, I prayed band practise would go smoothly. I had a crummy headache and the idea of just vibing with them, picking songs to play at the festival and going over our track list seemed like a chilled out morning. 

Those types of hangouts were rare but they did exist. Maddy brought cake and we would chat or freestyle. I found myself clinging onto those moments. 

Because I could almost delude myself into believing I had friends. 

However, these were the same people who got into a heated argument over the existence of life after death. 

So, I wasn't surprised to walk directly into a screaming match between my bandmates. I didn't even have to ask what it was about. Maddy and Sam were standing inches from each other, the air prickling with tension. Jordan sat on a speaker, legs crossed, gaze glued to his phone and earphones corked in. 

Lifting his head, he caught my eye, his lips curling into a smirk. 

On the long list of things our base guitarist couldn't take seriously, fighting was at the top of the list. The first thing I saw was Maddy’s dark red ponytail bouncing up and down. She was waving a sheet of paper in Sam’s face. 

The school concert sign up form. 

There was only one name on the dotted line. 

Sam Brightwood. 

*Of course.*

It was Sam’s worst kept secret that he was trying to go solo.

Despite his stubborn attempts to prove otherwise. 

“You're leaving us?” Maddy paid no attention to my entrance as usual, her dagger eyes on our lead singer. If we lost Sam, we lost our band. The school was strict in their policy that there must be at least four members in a club. I didn't exactly like our band, or my bandmates. 

But it was all I had. 

I didn't fit into any group or clique, so this crummy high school band we had built from scratch weirdly meant a lot to me. 

Sam folded his arms, on the defence as usual. Sam Brightwood was what I liked to call a football reject. He had the physique, broad shoulders and toned muscles. His face was attractive enough, though he was more of a labrador retriever than player. His thick head of reddish curls was his best attribute. 

Sam had girl's (and guys) running their fingers through it every day. His hair routine was impeccable. 

“No,” he rolled his eyes, running his hand through his hair. A nervous tick. We all had them. Jordan chewed his nails, Maddy bit into her lip, and I was told I blinked a lot. Sam shrugged. “I'm just going solo for the music festival.” 

“That sounds exactly like you're leaving us,” Jordan spoke up from the other side of the room. Jordan Anzai was half Japanese on his mothers side, handsome features and thick dark hair. He didn't look up from his phone, though from the slight hint of seriousness in his tone, Sam had pissed him off too. I didn't realize how attached we were to this room, to this band, until Sam hinted that he was planning on going solo. 

Sam shot the boy a pointed look. “Relax. I’m not leaving the band, I'm just…” He shrugged. “Broadening my horizons.”

“Bullshit.” 

If looks could kill. 

Maddy shoved the flyer in his face. 

“You've been trying to get away from us since the start of the semester.” her voice broke around her words and I caught Jordan's smile crumpling. 

Maddy didn't give a shit about the band. All she cared about was Sam. 

She made that abundantly clear, announcing that where Sam went, she would follow. Jordan knew this, and had pointed it out numerous times. 

Maddy was only here for Sam. Which meant she didn't give a shit about us. 

“Tell us the truth,” Maddy pushed. “You want out of the band.”

Sam pulled a face, but he didn't deny it. 

Jordan actually stood up, pocketing his phone. “She’s right,” he said dryly. “Sammy can't wait to get away from us.” 

The guy was smiling, though, just like Maddy, he looked equally hurt. Usually, he used sardonic humor to avoid expressing feelings, but this was a rare moment when I was seeing raw, unedited Jordan. Who had not fashioned his lips into his usual joking grin. Jordan had been wary of the two’s relationship being detrimental since day one. 

During our first practice session, he'd grabbed the mic, going on a long, winded rant about staying together no matter *what*. Jordan had emphasised his words, spitting them into his mic. 

“Till death do us part, am I right?” he’d finished with a grin, cementing his place as the joker of our little group. 

His gaze, though, never strayed from the ex lovers. 

The thing with Sam and Maddy was a convoluted mess. They dated in junior year. Sam proposed they had an open relationship so he could date guys too, and that kind of broke her. Maddy wanted him to herself. They fell apart and met new people. Maddy was dating some random guy I can't remember the name of, and Sam was having casual hook ups. 

Maddy was an insane drummer. 

When she wanted to be. 

When she auditioned, Sam couldn't say no. 

He had a sparkle in his eyes, a smile on his face, that was reserved for Maddy Carlisle, regardless of his sexuality. 

Sam let out an exaggerated sigh, crumpling up the flyer. 

Sam Brightwood, lead singer of Chaos Head, was very different to Sam Brightwood who walked around school with his music corked in, a dopey smile on his face. I guess we all showed our true colors in the band room but Sam was remarkably different to the facade he put on. “Can we just practise?” 

He took his place at the main mic, twisting to the two of them. “Are you happy now? I said I was sorry.” He tipped his head back like a child having a tantrum. “I am sorry for trying to be better than–” 

“Better than what?” Maddy was following his words waiting for him to trip up. “Us?”

“No, that's not what I–”

“Yes, it is,” Jordan cut in. “You think we suck.” his lips broke into a grin, a darkness in his eyes I didn't know existed. Jordan usually smiled with his eyes. Not his teeth. This was a different side of him. “You think you're better than us.”

I expected our lead singer to stubbornly argue. And it looked like he might, creases in his brows and a red blush speeding across his cheeks. 

This argument had been building for a while, passive aggressive smiles and biting comments shot on all sides. A silent war through the power of raised eyebrows and scoffs. Instead though, let out a sharp exhalation of breath. 

“Okay, yes. We suck. And I’m sick of sucking. We were booed off of the stage,” Sam twisted to Jordan. “You may have found it funny because you can't take *anything* fucking seriously–and let me tell you, it is a chore trying to get anything out of you that isn't some a pretentious movie quote, or a shitty joke because you, Jordan Anzai, have the personality of a cardboard box.”

“You can talk,” Jordan quipped back. “At least I have a personality. You just wear a mask.”

“And you *don't*?!” Sam exploded with a splutter. “You accuse me of wearing a mask, and you hide behind this pretentious, I'm-better-than-you shit, because you're scared of actually making friends and showing your real self. You use humor to hide how painfully boring you are, and to avoid actual feelings. You're a sociopath.”

Jordan was clearly hurt, but he just scoffed. He tipped his head back, laughing. “That's a big word, Sammy. Have you been reading a dictionary?”

Sam’s lip curled. “Stop calling me that.”

“Why? It fits your little tantrum.”

Maddy was next in his firing line, and Sam didn't hold back. “You are fucking *stalking* me, Mads. I don't want you here because it clearly hurts you. But I don't know what to say! Do you want me to straight up tell you I feel uncomfortable that my ex-girlfriend won't let me have a life?!” The twist in his lips and glitter in his eyes made me realise Sam had been feeling this way for a while, slowly simmering away, all of these words twisting on his tongue. 

Only for him to erupt on us. 

Maddy opened her mouth to speak, her eyes wide, a scarlet smear blossoming across her cheeks. But he continued before she could respond. “I don't like you, Mads.” He spoke through his hands. 

“I don't like *any* of you. Do you want me to be honest? Fine.” Sam threw his hands up. “I want to go solo because we’re not even a band. We barely know each other, or *like* each other. We’re pretending for the sake of keeping the band together, and it's tiring. I am fucking tired of trying. It's like neither of you want to even *try* and hang out and get to know each other.”

He turned to Jordan. “You need to get over your stage fright shit. I'm sick of covering for you when you freak out on stage. Maybe if you actually opened up, I'd understand you more. Mads, you're always on your phone, and constantly late. Not to mention the songs! Where do I even start?” I could sense months of pent up frustration bubbling in his words. “I'm sick of singing indie shit. It's boring. Our songs suck. We need to be different. You want the crowd to like us? We give them something to like!”

He turned to me, finally, red faced with pointing fingers. I would have laughed if it wasn't for his next words. “And who the fuck even *are* you?” He spat at me. 

“We could replace you with a plant, and the *plant* would be more entertaining!” Sam folded his arms, lips curled with spite. I realized then, that I really was delusional. These kids weren't friends. 

They just tolerated me. 

“Do any of you even know his name?”

“Nick.” I spoke up, my face on fire. 

Sam mocked a look of shock. “Holy shit, he talks!”

“Well of course you never noticed Nick,” Jordan rolled his eyes. “You’re constantly fucking singing over everyone. You drown the poor guy out.”

He sent me a sickly smile. “It's not your fault your voice doesn't stand out, dude.”

Ouch. 

Sam clucked his tongue. “Well, at least I can actually sing.”

Jordan was biting his nails, nibbling on the stubs. “What's that supposed to mean?”

“Well, you can sing, can't you? Some might say you're the best singer in here.” 

Sam’s jealousy was showing, and I knew he'd taken Maddy’s off handed comment she'd made three weeks prior that Jordan had a stronger voice, to heart. 

He turned to face the lead guitarist. “So, why don't you sing? We all know you're playing it down to not upstage me, so why not fucking sing?”

Jordan, for once, was speechless.

Our lead singer wasn't finished. “And to make it even better, why don't *you* lead?” Sam laughed. “Oh, wait, you have stage fright! You're the one who hides behind me when we’re performing, and I have to face the crowd that treats us like shit. But do I step down? No. Because, weirdly enough, I actually want to protect you.”

“Sure.” Jordan snorted, muttering something under his breath. 

Sam curled his lip. “I'm sorry, what? Are we preschoolers now?”

“I said, oh, here we go,” Jordan shot Sam his signature grin. “The master manipulator is at it again.” he straightened up, though I could see the creases in his expression, the frustration and anger in his eyes. Our base guitarist's mask was slipping. I had never seen pain in his eyes, but he was struggling to keep it on. “I could play in front of a huge crowd. And be better.”

“Do it, then!”

Sam made a deal of stepping from the mic. “The stage is alllll yours, Jordan!”

The boy didn't move, his gaze dropping to the ground. 

He was so stubborn. 

Refusing to be wrong, and then backing down. 

At least Sam had a backbone.

Sam’s outburst left an awkward silence, only for Maddy to break it with a laugh. 

“Please,” she threw her sticks in the air and caught them. I thought she was going to use his face as target practice, but she just sighed and leaned back with a smile. Like all of us, Maddy Carlisle also wore a mask. “We could replace you in a heartbeat, Sammy.”

“That's *enough*.”

The new voice caused a rift in the room, the four of us twisting around. 

Maddy dropped her sticks in a panic, bending down to pick them back up. I didn't even notice the man standing in the doorway. If the men in black were real, I was pretty sure he was of them. 

Dressed in a perfectly pressed black suit and matching raybans, he stepped inside holding a briefcase. “Are the four of you finished acting like children?”

This guy was looking down his nose at us, lips curved in distaste. When he slammed the door and strode forward to take a seat on a plush chair, Sam shot Jordan a *what the fuck?* look. 

Jordan shrugged, mouthing, *How am I supposed to know?*

I caught Maddy’s wry smile. 

At least they shared a mutual enemy. 

“Well?” the stranger folded his arms. I wasn't a fan of him hiding his eyes. Eyes were the best judge of character for me, and the fact that I couldn't see his was a major red flag. He cocked his head, drinking us in through tinted lenses. “Let's see what you've got.”

Sam frowned. “I'm sorry, who the fuck are you?”

“Yeah,” Jordan kept his distance, scooting over to Sam who didn't push him away this time. **Progress.** 

“You can't just walk into a school.”

“I'm a talent agent,” the man said with a sigh. “I'm looking for a band to play at my boss’s kids birthday party. Thirteen years old. He wanted Kanye, but I'm not a miracle worker. It's short notice, so you could say I'm…” He seemed to hate his own words, sucking on his teeth. 

“Well, I guess you could say… desperate. I need an act for tonight.”

Maddy frowned. “You're a talent agent for some big shot, and you think you're going to strike gold in a high school?”

The man shrugged. “Prove me wrong.”

We did exactly the opposite. 

Our first song wasn't even finished, and this guy was waving his hands for us to stop. 

“You're bad,” he said. “No, you're fucking awful. You're the worst excuse for a band I've ever met.” He pointed to Maddy. “Who taught you to drum?”

The girl shrunk back into her seat, grasping onto her sticks. “I taught myself.” 

He nodded, pressing his lips together. “That makes sense. You are terrible.”

The man turned his attention to Sam, who for once, looked like he would rather be anywhere else. “You can't sing. Who told you that you could sing, kid? You're all over the place! There is essense of a voice. But you're not reaching your potential. You're the worst kind of singer. A coward who steps back, refusing to bypass limits.” 

“Limits?” Sam repeated in a breath. 

“Limits!” the man thundered, and the four of us jumped. “Breaking your voice! Singing until you are bleeding from the lips, until your chest is aching! I expect you to scream until you are mentally and physically tired and beg me to stop. That is what being a singer is. I work with vocalists who would laugh at you. And I would go as far to say you could be better than them.”

Sam had been humbled at last. 

Before the boy could reply, he moved onto Jordan. “You *can* sing.” 

The man stood up. I noticed Jordan stumble back. “Sing the chorus for me. Not backing vocals. Escaping into the background. I want your raw voice. Right now. Chorus, and then the first verse.” when my classmate turned to us for help, the man snapped. “Did I tell you to look at them? Look at me! If you want to stop running away from your own talent, I suggest you start singing.”

Jordan's eyes almost popped out of his head. “W-wait,” he started gnawing on his nails, his voice shaking. We called it **Jordan Mode** during performances. 

It was like going into shock. Jordan lost the ability to string sentences together, his eyes glazing over. Sam had to rescue him until he caught a hold of himself. This time, though, he was in too deep. “You really want me to sing?”

“That's what I said.”

Jordan shook his head, stepping away from the mic. “I can't.”

“Why not?” he gestured to the rest of us. “You're all friends, correct?”

“No, I…” Jordan was shaking. 

“You *what*?” 

Jordan didn't respond, bowing his head. 

“That is exactly what I thought,” the stranger tutted. “You're running away.”

He inclined his head at me, after smoking my bandmates. “You’re neither good nor bad. You're painfully average. Your voice is mediocre and your stage presence is awkward.” 

I swore Sam snorted behind me. “You're too stiff,” he strode over to me, pushing my shoulders down and adjusting my guitar strap. He stepped back, still with that distasteful curl in his lip. The man directed his question to the four of us. 

“Mmm bop,” he said loudly. 

For a moment, I thought he was having a stroke. I caught Jordan's slight smirk. 

“By Hanson,” the stranger continued. “Do you kids know it?”

We just stared back at him, exchanging looks. 

Silence. 

I raised my hand, eager to get away from the awkwardness. “Could I go to the bathroom?”

The man’s expression didn't waver, nor did he look at me. “If you want to miss my climaxing words, go ahead.” his lips quirked into a smile. “It's your funeral.”

I already knew them.

Sam couldn't hit high notes. 

Jordan could barely sing without freaking out. 

Maddy was offbeat.

And I was an inanimate object. 

We sucked. We were shattered beyond repair, and you can't make diamonds out of glass bottles. I placed my guitar down and made my way to the door. 

“Nick, wait.” Sam twisted around, shooting me a panicked look. I knew from his wide eyes, his parted lips, exactly what he was trying to cry out. 

*Get help* 

“Get a teacher,” he said out loud, cautious of being caught. “For that… thing.”

Jordan nodded, snapping out of it. “I need my meds,” he paused, raking his mind for a worthy drug. “My insulin. If I don't take it, I'll, uh, I'll pass out.”

“Right.” Sam spoke through gritted teeth. “Get Mrs Simons. The nurse.”

As the resident *house plant* (their words, not mine) in the band, I ignored the two of them. After all, my voice was too low, I was invisible, and could be easily replaced by a household object. But when they needed help, *now* the three of them noticed me? 

I wanted out of that room. 

Out of the band. 

So, I blanked them, slamming the door on their faces.

I wish I could go back and be less fucking petty. 

I wish I could stop that door from closing behind me. 

I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary until I was reaching the end of the hallway. It was way too quiet for a school day. Initially, I thought I was seeing things. There was something glittering in the air, cutting off the end of the hallway. I started toward it, a shiver slipping down my spine. It was a barrier, as if the ocean was hovering in mid air. 

I pressed my hand against it, tiptoeing my fingers across the surface, when I saw her. Mrs James, my math teacher. 

I saw the smear of scarlet first, a pooling red gliding across the marble floor. 

Then I saw what was left of her head, her skewered corpse spilling glistening innards. It was her eyes I couldn't stop looking at. What was left of them, deep caverns carved into her skull. There were remnants, pieces of bone fragments and what looked like burned fat, the pulpy mess of what used to be my teachers eyes. They had been burned directly from her head. I don't remember taking a step back, dropping to my knees and heaving up my breakfast through strangled gasps. 

Twisting around, a countdown began in my head. 

10.

I threw myself into a run. 

I left them.

9.

I left them with that psychopath. 

8. 

The world didn't feel real, my shoes slapping on the marble flooring. The air stunk of blood. Inside the barrier, time had come to a stop at exactly 8:38am.

7.

6.

5.

Almost there. 

4.

Reaching our band room, I couldn't breathe. 

3.

2.

I couldn't move. 

Pushing the door open, I stepped into a seeping scarlet trying to escape. 

Our band room was no longer ours. 

All I saw was red. Sam was crumpled on the floor in front of me. His body wasn't his anymore. It didn't look like him, barely a body at all. I just saw the burned remnants of his shirt still clinging to a fleshy mess where his head used to be. 

I had a moment of hysteria, taking in fleshy masses dropping from the ceiling. 

*Were we that bad?* 

Did we suck enough to be violently murdered? 

Stepping over Sam, I staggered. 

Jordan was next to him, a headless torso bent in an impossible position. 

He had been snapped in two, his limbs like doll pieces scattering the floor. I saw an arm, then a leg, and three charred fingers. No sign of his head. I don't know why I was looking for it. 

I needed him at that moment. 

I needed his stupid humor, his endless movie quotes.  Jordan was dead. 

Very fucking dead. 

His intestines were stuck to my shoe. 

“Nick!”

Maddy's strangled sob snapped me out of it. The world swam around me. 

I twisted around, just in time, to see my band mate crawling across the floor. She was covered in blood that was not hers, trembling, her movements almost twitchy. I thought she was just frozen in fear until I noticed the seeping red leaking from her nose and ears. She had already been hit, clinging onto life. 

Maddy’s fingers clawed into the carpet, desperate, her eyes flickering, rolling back and forth. I don't think she could see me anymore. The strange man in the back suit loomed over her, and with zero expression, used the remnants of Jordan's base to finish her off. I saw everything. Paralysed, my eyes were glued to the first impact. I saw bone fragments scatter the carpet, chunks of fleshy pink staining the instruments. 

He didn't stop until she was nothing. I couldn't even see her face. The guitar came down in one final slam. When Maddy hit the ground, a vivid explosion of nothing, no longer human, no longer recognisable, my body started to move. 

But he was fast. 

Inhumanly fast. 

The world went in slow motion. I was moving, but my surroundings had stopped. I tripped over Jordan's body, and dropped to my knees before diving to my feet. Sam’s grisly remains covered me. He was all over my hands, staining my jeans when I was on my knees trying to crawl to the door. The man was behind me, taking his time. 

I wondered if he'd done the same with the others. 

Did Jordan *feel* his death? 

Was it too quick to register? 

A thought slammed into me, and I let out an uncontrollable sob. Would I feel my own death? What comes after? 

Did death mean endless darkness and nothing?

I didn't want nothing. 

I was *terrified* of nothing. 

I was on my feet, and it felt like I was walking on air. 

One step, and then two. My hands were slick with blood around the door handle when something pierced the back of my head. I knew what killed me. Maddy’s drumsticks forced through my skull.

One stick, which crippled me, sending me to my knees. 

And the other finished me off, piercing my brain.

I remember white hot pain that was too brief to truly register. 

The suffocating feeling of no breath in my lungs, and the world closing in on me. I waited to die. But death didn't *feel* like death. It felt like going to sleep. I thought death was a slow process, especially after being murdered. Except I barely felt it. There was that searing pain striking through the back of my head, and then nothing. 

Nothing to suggest I was actually dead. 

Until I woke up at my own funeral chained to my coffin. 

I would say I was scared, but I wasn't. 

I didn't feel fear. 

I think that part of me had been cut out. 

When I opened my eyes, the world was different. 

Duller, and yet also bursting with clarity. I could see every individual dust particle inside my coffin, each stitching on the suit I was buried in. My arms were bound behind me, cold chains wrapped around my wrists and torso. 

I wasn't expecting to find a battered Gameboy sandwiched at the end of the coffin where my legs were.  

It took a lot of stretching and struggling, hearing my mother's sobbing from above. 

I managed to tear one wrist free, though the other was stubborn. After a few hours of Mario 64 and the silence that quickly blanketed the world above, I concluded my funeral was over. The Gameboy ran out of battery soon after, so I was left stuck in the dark. 

Until footsteps. 

I shouldn't have been able to hear them, and yet they were in perfect clarity.

I heard the sound of a shovel hitting the dirt. 

“Nicholas Sinclair Cartwright,” the voice was familiar. 

The man who murdered me. 

The shovel hit the ground again, and this time he was quickening his pace. I could sense his slight panic. He was digging me up. “It is 11:58pm. Two minutes to midnight. You died exactly 248 hours ago. When the clock strikes twelve, you will be faced with a choice that will determine your afterlife.”

I opened my mouth to respond, when the chains wrapped around my torso began to tighten, and I swore my coffin jerked. In a single breath, the ground rumbled and I felt myself be pulled… 

Down. 

“Nicholas, can you hear me?” 

I could see them filling my coffin, creeping up from the ground like bugs and twining themselves around my arms, snaking across my neck. Rusted chains that seared my flesh. As if they were sentient beings, they skittered across my face, burrowing into my flesh and bones. 

I found my voice when my coffin was thrown open, and I found myself face to face with the man in the black suit illuminated in unearthly moonlight. 

“Yes,” I managed to grit out. 

“Yes! Get me out of here!”

I was dragged further down, straight through my coffin this time, and into the earth. The man didn't move, and phantom church bells began to ring in my head, signalling midnight. 

The chain secured around my ankle pulled me again, and my vision blurred. I could sense it, feel it, burning into my back. Heat that was so intense, I couldn't move. “You have a choice,” the man said. “Freshly deceased souls cannot escape the core,” he said. “It is neither heaven nor hell, a purgatory where young souls who meet an untimely end are judged and sentenced by God's, and bound to them.”

I lost my breath when something white hot licked across my back. 

“However.” The man cleared his throat. 

“You can escape this fate by coming to work for me. You will never truly escape the core. Without my protection, they will send beasts to drag you back to your grave. Nicholas, once you accept, you will no longer be human. Your soul will stay bound here. Without judgement or a soul, your body will crave…sustenance."

I was going to burn alive. 

"However, I can help with that. I just need you to agree to these terms and I will free you. Once I pull you from the ground, you have a thirty second head start to run away from my contract. Succeed, and do as you please. Fail, and you are mine. In fact, I have your first concert booked for tomorrow night. You're headlining.”

Straining against the unearthly restraints trying to drag me into the ground, I heaved out a breath. “What?”

He reached out his hand for me to grab. “Just say you accept, and I’ll get you out. Oh, and do not look at the moon. Without my protection, her light will command you back to your grave.”

Whatever these terms were, fuck them. 

He was giving me a chance to run, and I was taking it. 

“I accept,” I said in a breath, when my body was yanked deeper. “I accept!”

He nodded, and with a simple click of his fingers, the chains binding me to my grave were gone. When I lifted my head, the man was true to his word. He stepped back, gesturing for me to run. 

Climbing out of my grave was easier than I thought. My body was lighter than I remembered. Under the dull light of the moon, I was surrounded by tombstones. I didn't know where to run, fight or flight catapulting me forwards. 

I didn't stumble or stagger, my bare feet easily skimming across uneven ground. 

Until it hit me in waves of ice water that I was dead. 

Not just dead. I was shackled to my murderer, bound to an afterlife of hell, if I didn't escape. That was when I started to stumble, dropping onto my knees and then diving back up. 

The suit my Mom had buried me in was too much weight. I threw off the silk jacket and yanked off the tie. I could see it. In front of me were the cemetery gates. And beyond that, my freedom. 

I was going to make it. 

Something was tugging at me, though, a presence creeping down my spine. 

I could still sense that phantom chain binding me to my grave. 

I reached the gates. 

No sign of the man in the black suit. 

I should have registered his words more carefully.

The man said he would give me a head start. 

But he never said he would be the one hunting me down. 

I was pushing through the cemetery gates when I heard them. Sensed them. 

Running footsteps treading through dirt and leaves. I didn't move when heavy bouts of breath tickled the back of my neck. “Where the fuck do you think you're going?” the voice stung. I saw his corpse. I saw his brain leaking out of his skull. So, how exactly could Jordan Anzai be standing behind me? 

Maybe the man was fucking with me. My so-called judgement wouldn't be being dragged into hellfire. It was facing my bandmates I had left to die. 

His fingers were quick to leech around my neck, forcing me to face him. 

Chaos Head looked a mixture of horrifying and unearthly beautiful. 

Maddy, dressed in a long white dress torn up and smeared with filth, her hair curled, ghostly white skin almost illuminated under the moon’s glow. 

Sam and Maddy’s parents must have been playing a sick joke making them match. Sam’s tux was already ruined, torn straight down the front. Jordan's tie was loose around his collar, his blazer hanging off of one shoulder. The three of them had a certain glitter in their eye, a curl in their lips that wasn't anger. Sam’s jaw twitched, and Maddy cocked her head, dragging her tongue across her bottom lip. Jordan's grip tightened around my neck, his mouth splitting into a grin before a voice stopped him. 

“He's not food,” the man in the black suit chucked. “He’s your friend. And besides, even if you do eat him, you would spit him out. He is old flesh, already dry, separated from its soul. Condiments may help but I would advise against eating your colleague.”

“I’m not going to eat him,” Jordan spoke through a snarl. I really did not like his new teeth. Or his attitude. Gone was my classmate who hid behind sarcasm. 

This guy didn't give a fuck. 

Being dead meant all of that was gone. All those barriers stopping him from reaching his potential. Stage fright and finding his voice. Gone. But I don't think a human was there either. His eyes were drowned in darkness, moonlight bleeding around his iris. I realized, then, that I was staring at our new lead singer. 

He tightened his grip.

“I'm going to fucking strangle him.”

“That's not necessary,” the man spoke in a sigh. “Refrain the urge to murder your bandmate, please. If we’re going to build your reputation, you need chemistry.” 

His lips curled into a smirk. 

The asshole was laughing at us. 

Jordan tried to escape. When he got the chance, he attempted to run, only to be yanked back. The man may have made us think our chains were gone, but they were still there, still binding us to him. Sam attacked the man, only for his voice box to be ripped out, a long, slithering red string pulsing through his lips. The man teased him, pulling it from his mouth, teasing and severing it. 

One thing about being both dead, soulless, and bound to an organisation specialising in entertaining demigods, our bodies always stitch back together. 

So, we could be burned, ripped apart, tortured until we were begging for a human death, our souls tortured beyond pain, our flesh and bone impenetrable. 

There was no escape. 

On the way to our first concert, we were briefed. 

Human concerts were rare, and underground. 

If a human looks at us, their soul will be burned, carved, directly from their body. 

Demigods, however, hold their parties between heaven and earth, a world especially for them. If you want a mental picture, imagine a never ending party held between the sea and the sky, filled with insufferable teenagers with no respect and a *literal* God complex. 

Our first official concert was for a kid named Pollux.

Thirteen years old, and a fucking brat. He spent the entire time throwing bottles of soda in our faces and yelling, “You suuuuuuck!” while his friends shouted a multitude of insults. It's not like they weren't wrong. They called us feral, disgusting excuses for humans, and monsters with human faces. But we were feral. We were yet to feed, and our faces were haggard and pale, our eyes sinking into our sockets. We may have looked beautiful to a human, in a ghostly way. 

To a demigod, however, we were grotesque. Jordan was told that he sang with his teeth, and that was a major turn off for the audience. 

He argued that he couldn't help it. He was hungry. 

We all were. Our last meal was a woman we were forced to feed on.

Still though, we couldn't complain or argue. We were physically bound to the stage. A boy threw his bottle of beer at Sam’s face, and he finally snapped. 

“Dick!” he coughed into his mic.

We got a warning for that incident.

Though, on that paticular night, a girl tapped me on the shoulder when I was packing up my guitar. She was my age, and yet I knew she was only part human, almost painfully beautiful. Her hair was velvet black, skin luminescent under a sun that never seemed to set.

“You're a Feral,” she remarked, offering me a drink. She nodded at the shackle around my ankle. “Human kids that they kill and fashion into entertainers.”

Feral was, admittedly, something I would call myself knowing my new eating habits. 

“It's Nick,” I corrected her, exhausted. I was keeping an eye on Jordan who was sitting on the edge of the stage, legs dangling. He was staring a little too intently at the crowd, fangs slightly slipping from his upper lip. *Oh, God.*

If he attacked and fed on a demigod, we were finished. 

Maddy seemed to read my mind, grabbing the dishevelled boy and pulling him off stage. 

“Do you need help?” the girl lowered her voice. “I know someone who can get you out of your… “ her smile faded, eyes darkening. “Your predicament.”

“Nick, we’re leaving!” Sam grabbed and pulled me away before I could reply. I twisted around to at least say goodbye to her, but the girl was gone. 

So, here I am on my free day on Earth. 

I don't have a home to go back to, so I’m just chilling in Five Guys. 

Glasses on, obviously. 

We’re performing tonight under a new band name.

It's an underground concert. 

Demigods like to play around on earth too.  

The real world is different to what it was when I was human. The moon calls to me even in broad daylight and every so often, a skeletal hand will erupt from the dirt I stand on, and try to pull me down. 

My boss was right when he said I'm being lured into the core, and only his presence will scare those voices away. 

Sam was caught by the moon a few nights ago. 

He got so close to his grave, clawing into the dirt with his fingers, the moon in full control. The idiot forgot to wear his protective glasses, his mind captured by her glow, unblinking eyes skating the sky. 

We almost lost him. 

Luckily, he was pulled back. 

Maybe I should try finding that girl, wherever she is. 

And whichever God she is the son/daughter of. 

I think she might be able to help us. 

Until then though, I'll see you (if you can make it) at our performance tonight!

Just, please. 

Do not look us in the fucking eyes.
