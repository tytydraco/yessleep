This is probably not the scariest or most coherent stories on here, but it's been driving me crazy for the past half a year, every time I forgot about it, it happened again, and now I keep coming back to it, and noticing more and more strange things in it... Also, english is not my first language, so excuse me if some things that I say sound strange.

Firstly, I would like to say, that I am a very audio-centered person, if that's the right word. I don't look around as much(don't have a good eyesight anyways), cant for the sake of me remember people's faces or names, but I always remember everything I heard, from voices, to song, notes, and that's even how I learn the best, listen to the theory.

I am also not  entirely sane. I have been hearing stuff in my head for a long time, it started when I was 14 or so(20 now), with incoherent speech that felt as if it was consuming my brain resources, pressuring at my ability to think, laughter, cries, screaming, arguing, all of these sounds were overwhelming me sometimes, especially when I was stressed out. The worst things I heard were things I called "weeping of the house" and "song of the world", first being the sound of weeping on the edge of my hearing, coming from all directions, from behind the walls of the building I live in, and second being a song, something that I can't even properly hear, as if it's playing from very, very far way, but it kept following me for a while.

I am telling this, because at first I thought this was one of those noises, a hallucination. I have a good friend who I spend a lot of time with, and sometimes we watch movies, or creepypasta on youtube at night, using a special site called "hyperbeam". It just allows us to open a virtual youtube page that plays in sync for both of us, nothing fancy. One time I decided to go to sleep while listening to a creepypasta, it was about some sort of a hotel with monsters I think, but then, as I was falling asleep, I suddenly started hearing some... Groaning, or growling coming from my speakers. I didn't even pay any attention to it at first, thinking it was just an audio effect in the video or something, until it got louder than the narrators voice... But I wasn't very scared by that point.

I stood up from my bed, and walked up to the pc, more confused than anything, took control, and paused the video, but the sound didn't stop for a while, until the entire web page... Closed, and we had to restart the group, and the video... I described that sound as slow, heavy, labored and wet breathing, with the basses being unnaturally loud for my pc's settings, and my friend later described it as a mix between a ghast noise and an amnesia monster noise, but here's the thing... I, with my perfect audio memory... Cannot remember it. I couldn't remember it 5 minutes after I heard it, however much I listen to it, it doesn't matter, I forget it the moment I stop focusing on it so much...

Now I only remember the description I gave to that sound, and the strange uncomfortable, pure fear feeling it started summoning in me. It was like waves of shivers were going through me every few seconds, and that is still happening as I'm thinking of it. I am even getting a headache as I'm writing this... But at least I remember it happening.

There was three people in the group that day, I was the only one who heard it, and got everyone else annoyed by pausing a video. At first, I thought I was being trolled, the friend I talked about does troll me about my "insanity" sometimes, but he was just laughing at it, and then when he figured out I was serious, got offended... I couldn't sleep that night... That sound, this entire situation, was haunting me for the entire night until the sunrise, and only then I fell asleep. It felt like a fever dream to be honest... From fear, and panic. I only felt like that once in my life, when I was a very little kid, never again I felt such pure fear.

And then, I forgot about it quickly... Until, it happened again, three days later, but this time, to my friend. Same exact sound, he even recorded it, except his reaction was confusing... He started laughing like crazy, he found the sound... Funny? Or the situation maybe, or my fear. After that, it was on my mind for around a week, until I forgot about it, and I wish that was the last time I heard it... But no. After a month or two, it happened again.

Next time I hear it, same situation, night, around 03:00, and it just... Appears, from nowhere, same site, and then again, after around a minute of the sound persisting, the web page closes, and I'm left alone in eerie silence. And when I speak to my friend about it he... Doesn't remember ever hearing anything, or us even talking about it. I send him the video HE HIMSELF recorded, and he says that he doesn't remember doing that... Or hearing that, but starts laughing again. Meanwhile I am losing my mind...

I genuinely don't know what is this, or why this is happening, maybe it's just a prank from my friend, maybe it's a prank from the site we use, but... I cannot keep thinking on how quickly and easily... I forget about it, and how quickly my friend entirely forgot it ever happened... My brain keeps pushing me into a direction that hurts me, physically. I have a headache thinking about it, but I cannot stop, it comes back every time, and I dread randomly hearing it again... It feels like some sort of a memetic virus...

Please, if you did hear that sound before, tell me, if you have your theories, anything, I just... I need to know why this keep happening. I found nothing by googling, posting here is my last resort. I tried uploading the video with that sound onto here, but I can't for some reason, sorry, I'm not very experienced on reddit. I do have the MOV file though, and someone tells me how to post it here, I will.
