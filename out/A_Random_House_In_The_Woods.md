Ok. I’m 29 years old, and this happened back when I was 15-16ish and the friend I was with that day unfortunately passed a few years back due to a battle with addiction, so I’ll try to remember it the best I can. 

I used to go stay at my dads every summer when I was a kid for a week or so. My dad lives in the country so not much to look at except for giant sprinkler systems corn fields and soy bean fields, and the occasional patch of woods here and there. I always remember when I was really young my dad would constantly tell me and my brother to NOT leave the yard after it got dark. I even remember asking him “why?” One time to which he replied “There’s a lot of weird fuckers out here, just don’t do it.” “Ok” I thought he’s just trying to scare the shit outta me. Typical dad shit to a 9 year old. Stories of the boogeyman etc etc. I could go on. Anyway fast forward 5-6 years later. 


I had convinced my dad to let one of my best friends accompany me for my stay with him that summer. One afternoon after being there about 3-4 days. My buddy turns and says “Hey, I brought a bag of some bomb ass purple Urkle, wanna go smoke.” To which I ecstatically replied “Fuck yeah bro, but we gotta walk somewhere, my pops will flip if he catches us.” So start walking we did. My dads place is on a dirt road in the middle of nofuckingwheresville, USA, with woods on one side of the road and bean fields on the other. We walked for what seemed like half an hour or so. And then my buddy spotted a little path that went off into the woods. Let’s go through there he muttered. 

We started walking down the path and within 15 mins or so we came upon this clearing with a shitty run down house in it. “Oh bro we gotta go burn in there” he said. I agreed. We walked up the steps and as my buddy opened the door I put my head down to light a cigarette, when I ran straight into the back of him. My Cherry went everywhere, burned the shit out of me. I went to yell what the fuck dude, but as I looked up I only got half the sentence out. 


This place was fucked. All kinds of weird shit written in dog and whatever else’s blood on the walls. Shit like. “It lives” and “13”. There were two decapitated dogs hanging in a closet with pails underneath them. An oven in the kitchen that was tied shut. With what looked like carcasses in it. Fuck no I didn’t open the fridge. I turned to my buddy and said something along the lines of “we need to get the fuck out of here before whoever did this comes back. I went to walk across the kitchen and fell through the floor into the basement where I landed on a pile of bones. I could see me buddy peer over the hole and asked if I was ok. I think so I yelled. I saw some stairs in the corner and I bolted up them with pure adrenaline. We left quick as shit. I’ve never been back. Though I’ve thought about it.

It’s nearly 15 years later now, and last week I started getting these odd ass envelopes in my mailbox. No return address, nothing. There first one just said. “We know you were in our house”
The second one had an old Polaroid in it and it was a PICTURE OF ME AND MY BUDDY RUNNING OUT OF THE HOUSE. And a message that said “you will pay if you tell anyone of this.”
I haven’t gotten anymore envelopes. Will update if I do. I’ll probably be ok right…..???
