We buried my wife on a cold Tuesday in March. The cancer had eaten her away until she was a whisper of the woman she used to be. The last thing she said to me, through cracked lips, was: *“Don’t let me be alone.”* I told her I wouldn’t.

But death doesn’t care about promises.

Three days after the funeral, I woke up to the sound of the front door opening. I live alone. Or, I did.

I grabbed the bat from under the bed and crept down the hallway. The smell hit me first. Honeysuckle and lavender—Sarah’s scent. Then, her voice: *“James? Why is it so dark in here?”*

She was standing in the living room like she’d just gotten home from work. Same jeans. Same flannel shirt. Same slight smile. Except... she’d been buried in a white dress. I chose it myself. Her favorite.

I didn’t speak. Couldn’t. I just dropped the bat.

“Babe?” she said again, walking closer. I saw no scars, no rot, no sign she’d been underground. She was… perfect. But there was something wrong with her eyes. They looked at me like they remembered me, but couldn’t quite place me.

“Sarah?” I finally managed to whisper.

“Of course it’s me,” she laughed, but it sounded rehearsed. “What’s wrong, James?”

I lied. I told her I was just tired. I told her I missed her. I told her I loved her. And when she wrapped her arms around me, her skin was cold.

That night, she climbed into bed beside me, her breathing shallow and mechanical. Every once in a while, she'd whisper my name like she was practicing it. *James. James. James.* Like she wasn’t sure it belonged to me.

I didn’t sleep.

Over the next few days, she acted like nothing had happened. Cooked dinner. Watched reruns of shows she loved. But she didn’t eat. Didn’t blink. And she never left the house.

I checked the cemetery. Her grave was still there. Undisturbed. The caretaker swore nobody had touched it.

Then I found the photo.

It was on my phone, timestamped at 3:17 a.m., two nights ago. A picture of me sleeping. Her face barely visible in the mirror behind me. Smiling. Watching.

I didn’t take that photo.

I confronted her. I had to.

“Sarah,” I said, holding up the phone, “what is this?”

She looked at it like it was a foreign object. “Why would I take a picture of you sleeping?”

“That’s what I’m asking.”

She tilted her head, like a puppet unsure of its strings. Then she smiled. “Maybe you took it yourself. People do strange things when they’re grieving.”

That night, I locked the bedroom door. At 2:00 a.m., I heard scratching. Not on the door. From inside the closet.

I haven’t opened that closet since.

She’s still here. Every day, pretending. But there are cracks. Her smile stretches too wide now. Her voice sometimes echoes, even when she’s standing right next to me. She hums a lullaby we never knew. One that makes my nose bleed when she sings it too long.

I think whatever came back isn’t her. It wears her face, remembers her laugh, mimics her habits. But it isn’t Sarah.

Two nights ago, I woke up and she wasn’t in bed. I found her in the basement, standing perfectly still, staring at the boiler. Whispering to it.

It whispered back.

I packed a bag the next day. I told her I had a business trip. She smiled and said, *“Don’t be gone long. I hate being alone.”* The exact words she said before she died. Word for word.

But she never knew I lied to her.

The last thing I ever said to her on her deathbed was: *“You’ll be fine. I’ll see you again.”*

Not *“Don’t let me be alone.”* I never said that back.

So how did she remember it?

I’m writing this from a motel three towns over. It’s been two days. I thought I was safe until I checked the mirror this morning. There was a handprint on the glass. On the inside.

She’s coming.

And she remembers everything.
