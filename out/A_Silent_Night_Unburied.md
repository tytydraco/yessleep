The roars seemed to come from all directions, I began to panic so was everyone else. They began to run and without a thought, I saw the sheriff run even faster than I had ever seen him before. The forest felt like it was closing in and I was running behind the group but I kept my distance as I wanted room to manoeuvre in case I needed to and was right when I saw one of the Marsh boys being dropped by a thrown trunk, I did not stop as I narrowly missed hitting a tree when I tried to look at the direction the trunk came from. A scream emanated from the front as I saw Old Jeb being picked off as he just broke through the tree line, the other Marsh boy was firing in every direction in a panic. There 5 men that remained were through the treeline and scrambling to get into a single truck, a couple of them scurried to the back and began aiming at the trees waiting to see if the things come out. I ran for the sheriff’s cruiser, it was then I noticed he wasn’t anywhere. I stopped for a second to look around and could not see him, I turned to my right and that is when I saw something fly out of the woods.

It landed a few feet away from me and it was a head ripped of its body, I did not have to have a second look and ran for the cruiser. The balding head was too obvious and I did not have time to mourn an old friend’s brutal end, managed to get to the door and that is when I heard the firing from the already moving truck and roars. Getting in I did not have time to see what was happening in front the car as I started the car and  wanted to get as far as I could from here. The engine started and I looked up, the smaller of the 2 things was racing to the moving truck and the men were concentrating fire on it, looks like what they were doing was working because just a few feet it dropped like a stone. A roar again emanated from the trees and a tree trunk flew at the truck but it missed they were gone. I hit reverse and gun the cruiser’s gas pedal. I needed to get out of here, the radio came to life it was the lady at the station.

She was calling for the sheriff, I was too busy to pick as I looked back to where the other truck was the bigger one was running for me now. I spun the wheel and shunted the gears to forward and turned the car to move away from the carnage, I needed to get out of here and that thing was baying for my blood. Blood for blood right? I guess my blood is what it now wants and it will not stop.

I picked the radio and spoke “Paige, this is Will Mason, Sheriff is dead I am sorry. Those bastards got him, one of them was taken down by the surviving men and the other looks to be coming for me. I am going to lure him to Nelson’s place away from town. If anyone can help, please let them know where I am.” I dropped the radio and drove. Nelson’s farm wasn’t far from where I was and there was something there that I knew gave me a chance to survive.

I drove while keeping an eye in the rear view making sure I did not get a surprise I did not want. I was scared but knew this was the only way I could survive, I could not fight that monstrosity and knew no one is going to help either. The radio was a buzz of requests for help but there were no replies, no one comes to our assistance because we were considered lost people here in the Appalachia. As I neared the farm I remembered that Nelson’s wife could still be at home so I needed to make sure got her out of the house. I stopped the car in front of the house and ran to the front door. I knocked on the front door and waited impatiently but there was no answer, I looked around the place and saw her car wasn’t around. I ran to their shed and tried to open the door but it was locked, I had no choice but to smash the lock.

I heard the familiar roar and knew the thing was close and I did not have time now, I grabbed the nearest object I could use and hit the lock repeatedly, the roar was closer now and I was sweating heavily. With a final smash it opened, and I ran in, at the end of the shed was a door build into the floor. That door was unlocked thankfully so I opened it and ran in locking it behind me. I was lucky as I heard the thumps from the thing just outside the shed. Once inside I hear the front door of the shed getting smashed in, I stood behind the bunker door and waited.

Nothing happened for the first few minutes but once the thing realised, I was in here it began trying to smash the heavy door in. Nothing could break that industrial door I installed with Nelson, he was also Vietnam veteran like me but the it was like he never left the battlefield. He built this place to appease the paranoia and have a place to hide when his mind went mad with the old memories, his wife let him build it as a way to work off the anger within.

I made my way to the main room within, there was a radio I could use and wanted to let the station know I was safe and they should find Nelson’s wife and keep her there. This thing was walking around the property trying to find a way in and I was stuck until it was out there. The old ham radio still worked so I tried a few channels I knew of and managed to find the frequency of Barker who lived near the town.

“Barker, you there?”

Static.

“Barker, pick up you old fuck!”

“Barker here, is this Mason?”

“Yeah it is, listen. Call the station and let them know I am in Nelson’s bunker, see if they can find the wife and keep her from coming back here. Do this first then I will tell you what the fuck is actually happening.”

He replied with a yeah and then I waited for him. It took 20 mins before he came back to me, “hey Mason, I told them what you said. They sounded scared shitless, what the actual fuck is going on there? I heard sheriff is dead?”

I told him everything, he listened and when I finished he whistled. “Looks like the ‘squach you pissed off wants your blood brother, no one here wants anything to do with it. Listen if you can hold out for a while I think someone might be able to do something but I cannot promise you anything.”

“I don’t care, as long as this thing leaves this place I am good but right now I am out of options.”

Barker told me to sit tight. I had nothing else to do so I sat and looked out the observation slits, it was noon by now and I saw the shadow move across the slit. I knew it was looking for a way in, I was the mouse and this was my trap. How am I going to survive I don’t know.
