Every day we walked to the park at the end of our street in Evergreen, the town's name, where the summer was coming to an end. However, today was different because anny noticed something...  a light in the midst of the woods, no one saw it but her, everytime she saw the light....she would stare.

Her friends began to worry, referring to her as "the crazy kid." Despite this, she persisted, and the light became real, and everyone who questioned her understood she was not insane. They followed the light, which led them to a floodlight. Men wearing lab coats, masks, and rifles were too advanced to be anywhere close to their little community.

Demanding to know how the kids got through the gate...what gate? they aimed their weapons at the kids wanting answers, but their where none to give, one tried to run.. "Do any of you have a superpower...?" one of the guys said after Jane was shot, although she did not feel any pain. Like an abnormally high pain tolerance.. or super hearing..?" The second youngest one came forward.

Max. Age 14, "I can hear really good. My parents even put me through a test.. but why do you ask sir..?" Max was a well behaved boy.
The masked man led max into one of the RVs,
"Sir.. I think we found an abnormality.. a "c21"
What should we do?"The lone man without a mask, a horrible scar on his neck, proudly exhibiting it for everyone to dread.

"We use him.. we see if he knows about the crying man.. tell me child. Have you ever stayed awake past your bedtime?" Max nodded, somehow expecting his response " have you ever heard a faint crying? But no one else would? Specifically around 2:43 to 3:35?"
Max began to tear up immediately. What he previously believed was nightmares were real..

Max said quietly. Choking on his words  " yes sir.. but those were dreams.. h-how do you know about him..?"
The man leaned slightly in and gave Max a shoulder pat. " you see this scar son? The same man did this to me.. we're here hunting him..
We let all your friends go, so you can stay and tell us everything you know.. if you don't he'll hurt people.."

A few hours later, max was given a bed, food, and drink, and put into a strange room, "goodnight max" he heard via an intercom, and suddenly... max felt exhausted, he lied down, and almost immediately went into a deep slumber.  "all systems check, begin phase 1."
Almost immediately, a lullaby began to play.

"One two three.. close your eyes with glee, tonight the crying man sings.. the scream of joy, is not a toy, after 3, it turns to a boy, wails of pain are yet to gain, after 4.. he is no more.."
" begin phase 2. Evergreen." A poison in the room caused Max to start dreaming. When he awoke in his own bed, feeling warm and cozy, he believed it was all a nightmare. He walked down stairs and his mother greeted him," max, your gonna be late."

He was confused, today wasn't a school day.
"Late for what mom..?" His mother returned the look of confusion.  " for your friends? Yknow, mark, Steven, lilly," max just became more confused.. he's never met anyone with those names.. "mom? Are you feeling ok?"
She nodded with a hint of sarcasm, giving max his lunch and sending him off, he had no idea where he was going, but something was wrong...the faces of the people around him were all blank...

He ran home almost instantly, he ran inside straight to his mother, but her face was blank too.. but in his mother's voice it said " max!? Whats wrong? You ran in like you saw a ghost.." he started to cry.. everything was wrong, what was the dream? The man with the scar or this? He just- cried.. but the thing didn't move... "max... please.. look away so I can move.. you know, he doesn't like when I move.. he cries.. he hurts people, especially me... please look away.." he did as it instructed, he looked away.

The sounds that came after.. weren't normal...the sound of a wooden doll, mixed with the breaking bones of a human.. he tried so hard to keep his head down... it felt like he was there forever before it stopped.. " max... where is your mother... I thought I told you she couldn't move! I-I need her... here.. forever max, forever! " he kept his head down...

 hearing the crying man wail.. his father was the crying man.. he suddenly opened his eyes, looking down at his hand.. covered in cuts and multiple bruises..  his thighs stung.. he knew exactly what it was, the cuts from the razor that helped him escape the real world, into a dream.. this was real, his mind was slipping.. between the cuts, depression, and every girl he loved but couldn't have..max finally looked up,

A 6.4 man stood above him, crying on his knees, every tear hitting the ground sounded like a ticking clock, one two one two one two
His mother was gone.. he sat in the exact chair shed killed herself in, his heart hurt, he didn't want to blame his father, but he had no choice.. he loved her too much to let her go, she died 4 years ago today.. lilly and mark were the people he trusted.. they used him, for emotional torment, he was constantly getting made fun of by them.

Max knew he wasn't ok, but he couldn't die like he wanted.. his father couldn't handle it, he waited.. until 25, no one had faces, just blank skin, he held the knife to his wrist, thought of everyone that hated him for no reason, his mothers suicide, fathers abuse, but Adam.. was the only person that ever cared.. he'd be giving up adam, and the potential of joy, just to figure out what happened when we go... like the crying man.. The end.. I love you. Just know that<3
