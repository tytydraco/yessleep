I always knew Victor Henshaw was a little mad. He was brilliant—smarter than anyone I had ever met—but there was something unsettling about the way his mind worked. While others saw limits, he saw opportunities. While most feared death, Victor saw it as a puzzle to be solved.

And now, standing at the door of his remote laboratory, I felt a deep, gnawing sense of dread.

His letter had been brief, almost frantic:

"Jonathan, I’ve done it. I need you. Come at once."

No explanation. No details. Just urgency.

The wind howled through the surrounding trees, rattling the windows of the old Victorian house. I hesitated before knocking, but before I could second-guess myself, the door swung open.

Victor stood in the dim light of the entryway, looking worse than I had ever seen him. His skin was pale, his eyes sunken, and his lab coat—once pristine—was stained with something dark.

"Jonathan!" he breathed, gripping my shoulders. His fingers were ice-cold. "You came."

"Of course," I said, forcing a smile. "But, Victor… you look terrible. What’s going on?"

He grinned—a wide, unsettling expression. "Come inside. I have something to show you."

I followed him into the heart of the laboratory, my boots echoing against the wooden floor. The place reeked of chemicals, metal, and something else—something organic. The flickering candlelight barely illuminated the chaotic workspace. Beakers bubbled on a long table, connected to wires that snaked across the room. Papers were scattered everywhere, covered in frantic, scribbled notes.

In the center of it all stood a large metal table, draped with a thick, bloodstained sheet.

My stomach turned.

"Victor," I said slowly, "what the hell have you done?"

He turned to me, eyes alight with feverish excitement. "I’ve broken the final barrier, Jonathan. Life and death—do you see? It’s all chemistry. It’s all mechanics. And I have discovered the key to transcendence."

I felt a cold sweat break out on my skin. "You’re talking about—"

"Resurrection."

I took a step back. "Victor, this… this isn’t right. You’re playing with forces beyond your control."

He let out a sharp laugh. "That’s where you’re wrong. I understand them better than anyone. And tonight, I want you to witness my greatest achievement."

Before I could stop him, he ripped the sheet away.

I choked on my own breath.

The thing on the table had once been human, but now… now it was something else entirely. Its limbs were grotesquely elongated, stitched together with metal rods protruding from its joints. Its skin was a sickly shade of gray, its mouth frozen in an eternal scream. Tubes ran from its veins into Victor’s infernal machines, which hummed with a sinister energy.

I staggered back, bile rising in my throat. "Dear God… what have you done?"

Victor turned to me, his expression almost childlike in its excitement. "This was only the prototype. A step toward perfection. But now, I need a living subject for the final phase."

The words hit me like a blow to the gut.

"You… you want to experiment on me?"

Victor smiled. "Think of it, Jonathan. Immortality. Enhanced strength. A body free from disease, decay—death itself!"

I shook my head, heart hammering against my ribs. "You’re insane."

He sighed, almost disappointed. "I was afraid you’d say that."

Then, before I could react, something struck me from behind.

A sharp, blinding pain exploded in my skull. The room tilted. My knees buckled.

Darkness swallowed me whole.

When I came to, I was no longer standing.

I was strapped to the same table where the thing had lain, my wrists and ankles bound with cold iron restraints.

Panic surged through me as I struggled, but it was useless. Above me, Victor loomed, his face cast in eerie shadows. In his gloved hand, he held a long, gleaming scalpel.

"Don’t struggle, old friend," he murmured. "This is the beginning of something extraordinary."

The blade hovered over my chest.

And then—

I screamed.

When I woke up, everything hurt. My head throbbed with a dull, constant pain, and my limbs felt heavy and unresponsive, as if they were no longer my own. It wasn’t just the physical pain that terrified me—it was the realization that I had been betrayed.

Victor had strapped me down. He was going to use me for his unholy experiment, and it would kill me if I didn’t find a way out.

I strained against the restraints on my wrists and ankles, panic flooding my veins, but they were solid, unyielding. The chains of metal dug into my skin, cutting off circulation. There was no escaping by force.

I tried to keep calm. That was the first mistake I had to avoid—letting panic overwhelm me. If I couldn’t escape with strength, I’d have to escape with my wits. My eyes darted around the dim room. Victor had left me alone for a moment, to prepare something, I think. The lab was full of strange equipment—tubes filled with foul-smelling liquids, machines humming with eerie life. But there was something about the atmosphere, the air—thick and suffocating—that made everything seem more alive, more dangerous.

A series of thoughts began to form, slow at first, then gaining momentum. There had to be a way out. I scanned the room again. The table I was strapped to—it wasn’t just metal. There were wires running through it, connected to machines that hummed with power. If I could get close enough, maybe I could rip them out, cause a short circuit, something that would give me a chance. But I didn’t have that kind of time.

I noticed the small vent near the ceiling, its edges rusted, just wide enough for me to slip through if I could somehow break free of these restraints. The air in the room was cold, colder than it should have been, and the smell of chemicals was suffocating. The vent seemed to be my only option.

As I willed my mind to focus, my fingers trembled against the metal bindings. I had to be quiet. I had to be fast. Every minute was one step closer to Victor returning, and I wasn’t sure how much longer I could pretend to be still.

I focused on the restraint on my left wrist first. It was tight, but there was a tiny gap between the metal and my skin. Just enough for me to slip the tip of my finger into, just enough to work at the screw holding it in place. I gritted my teeth against the pain as I worked it loose. Every creak of the metal seemed to echo through the room, and I swore to myself I could hear Victor’s footsteps, but it was just my mind playing tricks.

The screw came free, but I was too slow. The door creaked open.

Victor stood there, his figure silhouetted against the pale light, his expression a twisted mix of amusement and contempt.

"Jonathan," he said, his voice too calm. "I was wondering how long you’d last."

I froze. My heart pounded in my chest.

"I gave you a chance," Victor continued, stepping forward, his eyes gleaming. "But you just don’t understand. This is for your own good. For humanity’s good."

"Let me go!" I shouted, struggling against the restraints with renewed strength, though I knew it was futile. The more I struggled, the more my body screamed at me to stop. But I couldn’t. Not yet. Not while there was still a chance.

Victor’s lips curled into a smile, but there was no warmth in it. He approached me, reaching for a syringe on the nearby table. "You should be honored, Jonathan. To be the final piece in my masterpiece. Immortality, strength, power beyond human limits."

I couldn’t wait any longer. I had to move.

In one desperate lunge, I reached up to the nearby shelf with my free hand, knocking over a beaker. The glass shattered on the floor, and the sound was enough to make Victor hesitate. For just a moment.

I grabbed a shard of the broken glass and started working at the other restraint. My hands were slick with sweat, my muscles aching, but I kept at it. The metal began to give way, just slightly. It was enough.

I heard Victor’s voice again, low and mocking. "You think you can escape?"

In a panic, I twisted the restraint free and bolted. My legs were shaky, but the rush of adrenaline gave me enough strength to stumble forward. I ran toward the door. The door.

I couldn’t believe it was locked. The handle was cold beneath my fingers, but it wouldn’t budge. Panic set in. This was my only chance. There had to be something else, anything else. I couldn’t go back to the table.

I spun around, my heart racing. Victor was right behind me. He wasn’t running; he didn’t need to. His steps were slow, measured, but I could hear the sinister calm in his every movement. He was savoring this.

In a blind frenzy, I looked around for another way out. A narrow staircase caught my eye. It led down, deeper into the bowels of the house—into whatever dark places Victor had hidden his other "experiments."

I had no choice.

I turned and bolted for the stairs. My legs buckled beneath me, but I pushed through the pain. If I could make it to the basement, maybe I could find a way out of this house, out of his reach.

But as I reached the top of the stairs, I heard it. The unmistakable click of the door lock turning. The door I couldn’t open.

Victor’s voice called after me, colder than I had ever heard it. "You’re not going anywhere, Jonathan."

I scrambled down the stairs, my hands shaking as I gripped the railing. What was waiting for me below? Could it be worse than what Victor had already done? The walls of the house seemed to close in, and every step felt heavier than the last. The air down here was damp and thick, the faint stench of decay hanging in the air. But I didn’t have a choice.

I heard the scrape of footsteps behind me. He was close.

Victor wasn’t going to stop. And I had no idea what lay beneath his house, but it was the only place I could run.
