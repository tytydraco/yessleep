After the bath, I felt like a new person. The grime and stickiness of the cave were gone, replaced by the clean, almost silky feel of my skin. My hair was washed, my muscles finally relaxed, and for the first time since this nightmare began, I felt human again.

The clothes Henry provided were a revelation. A soft linen shirt, sturdy trousers, and boots that felt like they had been crafted specifically for me. Even the belt was finely made, with a gleaming buckle that caught the light. Along with the clothes came something unexpected: equipment. A leather satchel, a small dagger, and a pair of gloves lined with faintly glowing thread.

Henry had thought of everything.

“You clean up nicely,” Maple said when she saw me. Her voice was light, teasing, and she gave me a smile that was warm enough to make my chest tighten.

I nodded awkwardly, still uneasy around her. “Thanks. The clothes… they’re great.”

Her gaze lingered on me a moment longer before she turned and gestured for me to follow. “Dinner’s ready. Father’s waiting.”

The dining room was magnificent. A long, polished table stretched almost the entire length of the room, lined with high-backed chairs that gleamed in the flickering candlelight. The walls were adorned with tapestries and paintings, each one depicting scenes that felt both familiar and alien—battles, celebrations, landscapes that seemed too perfect to exist.

And then there were the butlers.

Ash, one of Henry’s younger sons, called them foxes, and he wasn’t wrong. They were literal foxes, walking upright on their hind legs, wearing perfectly tailored tuxedos. Their movements were unnervingly precise as they carried silver trays, poured wine, and placed dishes on the table with practiced ease.

One of them stood in the corner, strumming a lute with delicate paws, while another sang in a hauntingly beautiful voice. It was surreal, and yet none of Henry’s family seemed to think twice about it.

“They take good care of the household,” Henry said as he gestured for us to sit. “They’re more reliable than any human servant I’ve ever had.”

Gregory and Tianna exchanged a glance, their unease palpable. I could see it in the way Gregory’s jaw tightened, the way Tianna’s eyes darted around the room as if she were trying to find the cracks in the perfect veneer.

For me, though, the sight was almost mesmerizing. The foxes moved with such grace and care, their manners impeccable. One poured me a glass of something that smelled faintly of apples and cinnamon, bowing politely as he stepped away.

“Please, enjoy,” Henry said as the food was served. “It’s not every day we have company.”

The meal was a feast—roasted meats, fresh bread, steaming vegetables, and a variety of sauces and side dishes that looked almost too beautiful to eat. The smells were intoxicating, and my stomach growled loudly as I sat down.

Henry sat at the head of the table, with Gregory and Tianna on one side and me on the other. Maple took the seat beside me, her presence impossible to ignore.

“So,” Henry began, leaning back in his chair with a relaxed smile. “What brings you to my little corner of paradise? It’s been a while since I’ve seen you two.”

“Passing through,” Gregory said, his tone curt but not unfriendly. “We’ve been keeping busy.”

“Busy doing what?” Henry asked, his smile never faltering.

“Looking for answers,” Tianna said, her voice flat.

Henry chuckled, shaking his head. “Still chasing the dream, are you? I told you, there are no answers. Only choices. And I made mine a long time ago.”

“You’ve certainly… settled in,” Gregory said, his eyes scanning the room.

Henry laughed, a deep, hearty sound. “Why fight it? This world has its quirks, sure, but it’s better than whatever we left behind. You’d be surprised how much peace you can find when you stop struggling.”

The whole time, Maple sat beside me, her presence magnetic. She didn’t say much, but her occasional glances, the way her arm brushed against mine, the faint, knowing smile she gave me—it was a constant distraction.

“You seem quiet, Glenn,” she said softly, leaning closer. “Does the food not suit you?”

“It’s amazing,” I said, my voice slightly hoarse. “I’m just… taking it all in.”

Her smile widened, and I could feel the warmth of her gaze. “You’ll get used to it. This world has a way of growing on you.”

Her words lingered in my mind as the conversation continued. Gregory and Tianna exchanged barbs with Henry, their tension growing more apparent, but Maple’s presence kept pulling me back.

It wasn’t just her beauty—it was something deeper, something I couldn’t quite put my finger on. She seemed to know exactly what to say, what to do to keep me hooked, to make me feel noticed, desired.

And that’s when it hit me again.

This was the snare. The comfort, the beauty, the warmth—it was all designed to trap me, to make me forget the outside world and accept this one.

I shifted uncomfortably in my seat, trying to focus on the conversation, but Maple’s gaze stayed on me, her temptation like a weight I couldn’t shake.

Dinner was in full swing when the sound of bells cut through the air.

At first, they were faint, distant, almost melodic. They chimed irregularly, like the echo of a song half-forgotten. I thought I might be imagining it, the remnants of some distant memory bleeding into this surreal world. But then I saw the others stiffen.

Henry’s jovial demeanor shifted slightly, his hand pausing mid-reach for a glass of wine. Gregory and Tianna exchanged a glance, their faces tense. Even the children, who had been chattering happily moments before, grew quiet, their eyes darting toward the window.

The bells grew louder, closer. Their chime lost its melody, warping into something discordant and unsettling. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up as the sound seemed to vibrate through the very walls of the manor.

“What is that?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

No one answered.

Henry stood, his expression unreadable. The fox butlers froze mid-step, their precise movements halted as if waiting for a command. The bells were louder now, echoing just outside the walls.

And then, thunder rolled across the sky.

The sound was deep and heavy, rattling the windows and shaking the floor beneath our feet. It wasn’t the sharp crack of a lightning storm—it was slower, heavier, as though something vast and ancient were shifting above us.

“We should go outside,” Henry said, his voice calm but firm.

“Do we have to?” Tianna muttered, but she rose with the rest of us, her hand resting uneasily on the hilt of her dagger.

The children stayed behind, watching silently as we moved to the grand double doors. The fox butlers swung them open with a flourish, revealing the darkened forest beyond.

The bells were louder outside, their chiming distorted by the oppressive atmosphere. The night was unusually dark, the moon and stars obscured by a thick, swirling sky. Thunder rumbled again, closer this time, and the sound seemed to carry a weight that pressed against my chest.

And then, through the trees, I saw movement.

A reindeer emerged from the shadows, its antlers glistening faintly as though coated in frost. It moved slowly, its hooves crunching softly against the dirt path. On its back was a saddle, and sitting in that saddle was… something.

As it came closer, the figure resolved itself. A small man—no, a gnome. He was barely three feet tall, his body wrapped in a patchwork cloak that seemed too large for him. His face was lined and weathered, his beard short and scruffy, and he wore a wide-brimmed hat that cast a shadow over his sharp, piercing eyes.

He pulled the reins gently, bringing the reindeer to a halt a few yards from the manor. The bells, I realized, were tied to the saddle, their chimes softening as the gnome dismounted with surprising grace.

He looked up at us, grinning. “There’s a storm coming,” he said, his voice rough but oddly cheerful. “Figured I’d stop by and see what’s for dinner.”

Henry laughed, his tension breaking like a dam. “Skibidi! You old bastard, you scared us.”

Tianna rolled her eyes, though a faint smile played on her lips. “You could’ve announced yourself, you know.”

“Where’s the fun in that?” the gnome shot back, his grin widening.

Everyone seemed at ease, but I stood there, bewildered. “Skibidi?” I asked, unable to stop myself. “What kind of name is that?”

The gnome turned his sharp eyes on me, his grin fading slightly. “I’m like you, assface. Trapped here.”

I blinked, taken aback. “I didn’t mean to—why do you—”

“Why do I what?” he interrupted, his voice dripping with impatience. “Talk like this? Look like this? Hell if I know. It’s just how I showed up here.”

“And the name?” I pressed.

He shrugged, turning his attention to the reindeer as he unhooked the bells. Gregory spoke up, his tone dry. “It’s the only name he’s ever given. Take it or leave it.”

I frowned, studying the gnome. His face, lined and weathered, made him look like he was in his mid-fifties. But something about him didn’t fit the image of an old man.

“How old are you?” I asked, unable to resist.

Skibidi turned to me, his sharp eyes narrowing slightly. “I’m twelve.”

The words hit me like a punch to the gut. “Twelve?” I echoed, incredulous.

“Yep,” he said, smirking. “Been here long enough to outgrow whatever the hell I was supposed to be. But yeah, twelve. You got a problem with that?”

I shook my head, my mind reeling. This place was stranger than I’d ever imagined, and Skibidi was living proof of just how twisted it could be.

“Come on,” Henry said, clapping his hands together. “Dinner’s still warm. Let’s eat before the storm hits.”

As we turned to head back inside, Skibidi gave me a sharp pat on the arm, his grin returning. “Relax, kid. You’ll get used to it. Or you won’t. Either way, you’ll live.”

I wasn’t so sure about that.

As we walked back into the manor, the firelight from inside casting long shadows across the polished floor, I found myself falling into step with Skibidi. His small boots clicked on the stone as he chatted away, full of energy. For someone who looked like he was in his mid-fifties, he carried himself with a strange, almost childlike enthusiasm. To add to that, he didn’t shut up.

“So, uh,” I began, still trying to process everything he’d said earlier. “You’ve been here three years?”

“Yep,” he said, grinning up at me. “Three whole years. And, lemme tell ya, it’s been wild. Way better than the boring old real world.”

I glanced at him, studying his lined face and scruffy beard. “No offense, but… you don’t look like someone who’s only been here three years. You look… older. A lot older.”

He chuckled, his grin widening. “Yeah, I get that a lot. But, I mean, come on—doesn’t it make sense? I’m a gnome! Gnomes are supposed to be old and wise and stuff, right? So, boom, here I am. Small, wrinkly, badass.”

“You’re just guessing, aren’t you?” I said, narrowing my eyes.

He stopped for a moment, his expression faltering. “Okay, fine, yeah, maybe I am. But think about it! When I got here, I was nine. Nobody’s gonna take a little kid seriously, right? So the world, or whatever runs it, must’ve decided I needed to be this.” He gestured to himself dramatically, as if presenting an award.

“Nine?” I repeated, the number catching me off guard. “You were nine when you ended up here?”

“Yup,” he said, starting to walk again. “Pretty crazy, huh? One second I’m screwing around online, and the next thing I know, bam—gnome life.”

“And now you’re twelve,” I said, frowning.

“Exactly!” He flashed me a grin. “Three years here. Though, honestly, sometimes it feels longer, you know? Like, I’ve done so much, it’s hard to believe it’s only been three years.”

I nodded, still processing his words. “Do you really think it’s been three years, or… do you think time moves differently here? Faster, maybe?”

He stopped again, turning to face me. His grin faded slightly, replaced by a thoughtful expression that made him look even older. “I don’t know,” he admitted. “I’ve thought about it a lot. I mean, how would we even know, right? We’re in here. The rules are different. But does it matter?”

“Yeah,” I said after a moment. “I think it does.”

He laughed again, the thoughtful moment vanishing as quickly as it had come. “You’re overthinking it, dude. Anyway, it’s not so bad. I mean, I’ve got my own stronghold, my own brigands. I’m practically a legend.”

I raised an eyebrow. “A stronghold?”

“Hell yeah,” he said, puffing out his chest. “Big ol’ fortress up in the mountains. Got a bunch of guys working for me. We run the roads, take what we need. Total warlord vibes.”

I stared at him, incredulous. “You’re saying you’re a warlord?”

“Yep!” he said, grinning like it was the most obvious thing in the world. “What, you don’t believe me? Go check it out sometime. The brigands practically worship me. It’s awesome.”

I was about to call him out, to point out how absurd the whole thing sounded, but then we reentered the dining hall.

The warm glow of the firelight filled the room, and the scene inside was eerily perfect. A’Rhea, Henry’s wife, moved gracefully around the table, guiding the children back to their seats. Her movements were fluid, deliberate, her voice soft and melodic as she spoke to each of them.

Skibidi hopped onto a chair without hesitation, grabbing a piece of bread from a silver tray and leaning back with a smug grin.

“Anyway,” he continued, speaking louder now that we were back in the group, “being a warlord’s great. You wouldn’t believe how much power I’ve got. And the brigands? They’re loyal as hell. Do whatever I say.”

I glanced around, expecting someone to laugh, to challenge his claims. But no one did.

Henry chuckled, shaking his head fondly. “Skibidi, always the adventurer. It’s good to see you again, my friend.”

Gregory and Tianna exchanged a glance but said nothing. Even A’Rhea, who was busy settling the younger children, didn’t seem to find his words unusual.

I sat down slowly, trying to wrap my head around it. “Wait, you’re not going to question him?” I whispered to Gregory.

Gregory shrugged, his face unreadable. “Doesn’t matter if it’s true. Here, perception is everything. If he believes it, if the system believes it, then it’s real enough.”

I looked back at Skibidi, who was now enthusiastically describing his latest raid on a caravan. His crude language and exaggerated gestures made him seem like a child pretending to be something bigger than himself. But in this world, where rules bent and reality shifted, maybe that was all it took.

And that was a thought I didn’t know how to feel about.

The storm outside grew louder as we resumed dinner. The wind howled through the trees, carrying with it the occasional crack of thunder. Rain began to patter against the windows, a soothing rhythm that contrasted sharply with the tension lingering in the room.

The fox butlers continued their work, moving with their unnerving precision. One poured wine for A’Rhea, who sat beside Henry, while another stood in the corner, plucking a haunting tune on the lute. For a moment, I tried to let the atmosphere relax me, to focus on the food in front of me, but the unease never quite left.

Gregory leaned forward, his elbows resting on the table, his gaze fixed on Henry. “I’ve been following a lead,” he began, his voice low and steady.

Henry raised an eyebrow. “Oh? Something worthwhile?”

“Could be,” Gregory replied. He glanced briefly at Tianna, who nodded slightly before he continued. “Julie took a group to Naamah’s palace a few weeks ago. They haven’t returned.”

Henry’s expression darkened, his usual jovial demeanor fading. “And you think that’s a good thing?”

Gregory nodded. “Their bodies were never brought back to Mama Webster. If they’d failed, that’s where they would’ve ended up. But the vats are empty. No sign of them.”

“Which means what?” I asked, cutting into the conversation.

Gregory turned his sharp gaze to me. “It means they might have found a way out.”

A heavy silence fell over the table, broken only by the sound of the storm outside.

Tianna shifted in her seat, her fingers drumming lightly against the edge of the table. “It’s a long shot,” she admitted. “But it’s the only one we’ve got.”

Henry leaned back in his chair, his arms crossed. “Julie’s group… they were ambitious, sure. But Naamah’s palace isn’t just some stroll through the woods. It’s the heart of this place. The rules are different there—worse. If they made it, it’d be a miracle.”

“Miracles happen,” Gregory said firmly.

Henry gave him a pointed look. “Not here.”

I glanced between them, trying to piece together the implications of what they were saying. “So… Naamah’s palace. That’s where she is?”

“If you believe the stories,” Tianna said. “It’s her domain. Her… throne, or whatever you want to call it. Supposedly, it’s where she draws her power. Where she keeps her secrets.”

“And her captives,” Gregory added.

A chill ran through me at his words.

“And you think Julie’s group made it out?” I asked.

“I think they might have found something,” Gregory said. “A path, a weakness—something we can use.”

Henry sighed, rubbing his temples. “Gregory, I respect your determination. I really do. But chasing this lead could just as easily get you killed. And for what? A slim chance at freedom?”

“For some of us, that’s enough,” Gregory said.

The tension in the room was palpable. Even the children, who had been quietly eating, seemed to sense it. Their chatter had faded, replaced by the soft clinking of silverware against plates.

Skibidi, for once, was silent, his sharp eyes darting between Gregory and Henry as if watching a game of chess.

Henry finally shook his head, his expression softening. “You know I won’t stop you. But just… be careful, Gregory. You’ve seen what happens to people who go too far.”

“I know the risks,” Gregory said.

The storm rumbled again, the sound rolling through the manor like a warning. I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were all standing on the edge of something far greater than any of us understood.

Gregory leaned forward, his hands gripping the edge of the table. “So, Henry, will you come with us?”

The room went still. The storm outside seemed to pause for a moment, the thunder rumbling faintly in the distance like it was waiting for his response.

Henry’s expression, usually so warm and jovial, darkened. His easygoing demeanor cracked, and for the first time, I saw a spark of anger in his eyes.

“What’s the point?” he said, his voice low and sharp.

Gregory blinked, taken aback. “What do you mean, what’s the point? You’ve been here as long as any of us. Don’t you want to get out?”

Henry laughed bitterly, leaning back in his chair. “Get out? And go where? Back to the real world? To what I left behind? You think that’s some grand prize waiting for me out there?”

Gregory opened his mouth to respond, but Henry cut him off, his voice rising. “This is real, Gregory. This.” He gestured around the room, his hand sweeping over the table, the children, the fox butlers standing at attention. “It feels real, doesn’t it? The food, the warmth, the people. It’s better than anything I ever had out there.”

“What are you talking about?” Gregory asked, his tone sharper now.

Henry’s jaw tightened, and he looked away for a moment, his eyes fixed on the flickering fire in the hearth. “You think I had some great life before this? I didn’t. I came from nothing. A terrible home, a terrible life. Parents who hated each other, who hated me. I barely got by. And then I end up here, in a world that actually makes sense.”

He turned back to Gregory, his voice softer but still edged with anger. “I built this, Gregory. This manor, this family—it’s mine. It’s good. And if it feels real, then why isn’t it real? Why do you and Tianna insist on throwing it all away for some pipe dream?”

The words hung heavy in the air. Even the fox butlers seemed to pause, their movements slowing as though they were caught in the tension of the moment.

Tianna broke the silence, her voice calm but firm. “Because it’s not real, Henry. It’s a trap. You know that.”

Henry laughed again, but there was no humor in it. “If it’s a trap, then it’s the nicest trap I’ve ever been in. Look at this place! It’s a paradise compared to what we left behind.”

“You’ve just convinced yourself of that,” Gregory shot back. “You’re comfortable here, so you’ve stopped fighting. But it’s still a cage, Henry. A gilded cage, sure, but a cage all the same.”

Henry’s fist slammed down on the table, making the silverware clatter. “And what if I don’t care? Huh? What if I’ve decided that this is enough? Not everyone has something worth going back to, Gregory. Some of us are better off staying right here.”

The room fell silent again, the storm outside picking up as if echoing the tension inside.

I sat frozen in my seat, watching the exchange with wide eyes. Henry’s words were like a punch to the gut. His anger, his pain—it was raw, undeniable. For all his charm and warmth, it was clear he’d been carrying this weight for a long time.

Gregory leaned back, his expression unreadable. “Fine,” he said quietly. “If that’s how you feel, I won’t push you. But if Julie’s group found something, I’m going to see it through. And if there’s even the slightest chance of escape, I’m taking it.”

Henry didn’t respond, his eyes fixed on the table in front of him.

The rest of us sat in tense silence, the storm’s thunder rumbling louder as if the world itself was unsettled by the conversation. For the first time since arriving in this strange place, I began to understand just how deep the cracks ran—and just how hard it would be to hold onto myself in a world like this.

The heavy tension in the room was broken by Maple’s soft voice. “Father,” she said, her tone calm and sweet, “may I show our guests to their rooms?”

Henry exhaled, running a hand through his hair. “Yes,” he said after a moment. “Go ahead, Maple.”

She stood gracefully and gestured for us to follow. “Come, I’ll make sure you’re all comfortable.”

We rose from the table, the storm still murmuring outside as we left the dining hall. The manor was quieter now, the fox butlers moving silently as they tended to their tasks. The children had long since gone to their rooms, leaving the corridors dimly lit by flickering sconces.

As we moved through the halls, I noticed that Maple led Gregory and Tianna to a single room. I raised an eyebrow at the sight. They hadn’t mentioned being together, but seeing them share a room, it made sense. This world was hard and isolating—maybe they’d found comfort in each other.

Skibidi, ironically, was given the largest room of all, complete with a grand four-poster bed and a fireplace that crackled warmly. He grinned as he stepped inside, muttering something about how it “fit his vibe.”

Finally, it was my turn. Maple led me down a quiet hallway, stopping in front of a door next to a large, intricately carved wooden arch. “That’s the library,” she said softly, nodding toward the arch. “And this is your room.”

She opened the door and stepped inside with me, her movements fluid and deliberate. The room was simple yet elegant, with a soft bed draped in warm blankets and a small table by the window overlooking the forest.

Maple lingered, her presence filling the space in a way I couldn’t quite describe. She turned to me, her gaze steady and warm. “Do you like it?”

“It’s… nice,” I said, suddenly aware of how small my voice sounded.

She stepped closer, her hands clasped in front of her. “You seem tense, Glenn.”

I hesitated. “It’s just… a lot to take in. This place, your father… everything.”

Her lips curved into a soft smile, and she reached out, her fingers brushing against my arm. Her touch was warm, almost electric, and I felt a shiver run through me. “You don’t have to be strong all the time,” she said, her voice gentle. “Not here. Not tonight.”

Her words cut straight to the core of me. The loneliness, the weight of everything I’d been carrying—it all seemed to bubble to the surface. I opened my mouth to respond, but no words came.

Maple stepped even closer, her hands resting lightly on my chest. Her eyes met mine, and there was something in them—something knowing, something that saw every part of me. “You don’t have to be alone, Glenn,” she whispered. “Not tonight.”

Henry’s words echoed in my mind. If it feels real, why isn’t it real?

I didn’t have an answer. The warmth of Maple’s hands, the softness of her voice—it all felt so real, so right in that moment.

I gave in.

Her touch was intoxicating, and as the night went on, it was as if she drained every ounce of loneliness from me. That aching, hollow part of me, the part that had screamed for connection—it was gone. But so was something else.

I felt lighter, freer, almost euphoric, but it was a strange, hollow kind of bliss. Like I’d lost a part of myself—not a good part, maybe, but a part of me nonetheless.

As I lay there, the storm rumbling faintly in the distance, I couldn’t help but wonder: what even was real anymore?

I awoke to the sound of shouting.

It ripped me from a deep, dreamless sleep, and for a moment, I was disoriented. The world around me was too vivid, too sharp. The warmth of the blankets, the soft glow of morning light filtering through the curtains—it all felt surreal.

Then the crash came. Steel against wood, splintering loudly, followed by heavy, deliberate footsteps.

The door to my room exploded inward, the frame shattering as two hulking figures stormed inside. Orcs. Massive, brutish creatures clad in jagged red armor, their tusked faces twisted in snarls.

“Up!” one of them barked, his voice guttural and commanding.

I barely had time to move before one of them grabbed me, yanking me from the bed with a force that made my head spin. My arms were wrenched behind me, and I felt the rough bite of rope as they bound my wrists tightly.

“What’s going on?” I stammered, struggling against their grip.

The orc didn’t answer. Instead, he shoved me forward, out into the hallway, where chaos unfolded.

The shouts echoed throughout the manor, blending with the clang of metal and the heavy thud of boots on the wooden floors. Tianna and Gregory were ahead of me, similarly bound, their faces tense but determined. Henry was there too, his expression grim, his shoulders slumped in a way that made him look smaller than he was.

But something was wrong. As we were dragged through the halls, I couldn’t help but notice the eerie stillness in the air. The fox butlers were nowhere to be seen. Neither were Henry’s children.

Instead, there was blood.

It streaked the walls and pooled on the floors, the once-pristine manor now smeared with crimson. The sight of it made my stomach twist, and I couldn’t bring myself to ask the question burning in my mind: Where was Henry’s family?

We were hauled outside into the cold morning air, the storm from the night before leaving the ground damp and muddy. The orcs moved with brutal efficiency, shoving us into a circle at the center of the courtyard.

I stumbled, falling to my knees as one of them barked an order. Gregory and Tianna were beside me, their faces hard with defiance. Maple knelt on Henry’s other side, her once-graceful demeanor shattered, her eyes wide with fear.

And Henry… Henry looked broken.

He didn’t fight, didn’t resist as they forced him to his knees. His head hung low, his expression hollow, his hands trembling slightly against the ropes binding his wrists.

The orcs stood around us in a ring, their weapons glinting in the morning light, their armor splattered with blood.

And then they parted.

A figure emerged from their ranks, small and familiar, striding forward with an air of confidence that turned my confusion into cold dread.

Skibidi.

But this wasn’t the Skibidi I’d met last night. Gone was the scrappy gnome in the patchwork cloak. He was clad in jagged red armor that matched the orcs, the plates clinking softly as he moved. A sword hung at his hip, and his once-cheerful face was now a mask of smug triumph.

“Sorry, Henry,” he said, his voice loud and cutting. “But you’ve got a lot of loot. And this house? It’s too nice not to be mine.”

Henry didn’t respond. His shoulders sagged further, his defeat palpable.

I stared at Skibidi, my mind reeling. “What the hell is this?” I demanded, my voice shaking.

Skibidi smirked, tilting his head as he looked at me. “What does it look like, assface? A takeover. Gotta climb the ladder somehow, and Henry here’s sitting on prime real estate.”

“Skibidi, you little—” Gregory began, but an orc cut him off with a sharp shove, sending him sprawling into the mud.

“Careful,” Skibidi said, wagging a finger at Gregory. “Don’t make me regret keeping you alive.”

I couldn’t wrap my head around it. Skibidi, the loudmouthed, arrogant gnome who’d been joking and eating with us just hours ago, was now orchestrating this?

“This isn’t a game,” I said, glaring at him.

“Sure it is,” Skibidi replied, his grin widening. “And I’m winning.”

He turned to Henry, his expression softening in a way that was almost mocking. “Don’t take it personally, Henry. You’ve had your time. But you know how it is—big fish, little fish. Circle of life, all that crap.”

Henry finally lifted his head, his eyes meeting Skibidi’s. “You don’t understand what you’ve done,” he said quietly, his voice heavy with something deeper than anger.

“Oh, I understand perfectly,” Skibidi shot back. “I’ve done what nobody else had the balls to do. You got soft, Henry. And I’m here to fix that.”

I glanced at Maple, her face pale, her eyes filled with terror. For the first time since arriving in this world, I realized just how fragile this supposed paradise really was.

And just how dangerous Skibidi could be.

Skibidi circled us like a predator savoring his triumph, his small frame carrying an air of exaggerated authority as he addressed his captive audience.

“See, here’s the deal,” he began, his tone smug. “You lot? You’re the perfect tribute. Naamah’s gonna love this. Three of her enemies!” He paused, his gaze falling on me, his grin widening. “Whatever the hell you are.”

I glared at him, my anger bubbling beneath the surface, but I held my tongue.

“Naamah’s been good to me,” Skibidi continued, pacing in front of us. “Real good. You think this armor just happens? You think these orcs just follow me for fun? Nah. She rewards loyalty. Power. And with you as my offering, I’m gonna get a seat at the big table.”

“You don’t even know what you’re doing,” Tianna hissed, her voice sharp.

“Shut up,” Skibidi snapped, pointing a gloved finger at her. “You don’t get to talk, miss high-and-mighty. You’ll see soon enough.”

Then, Henry spoke.

“Naamah’s gonna chew you up and spit you out, kid,” he said, his voice low and steady, though his eyes burned with anger. “You think you’re climbing the ladder, but you’re just another pawn. You’ll never be more than a scared little boy playing dress-up.”

The insult struck Skibidi like a physical blow. His confident smirk faltered, replaced by a scowl. “What did you just say?”

“You heard me,” Henry said, his voice gaining strength. “You’re pathetic. Always were, always will be. A child pretending to be a king.”

Skibidi’s face twisted in anger, and he stormed up to Henry, his small frame dwarfed by the man’s bulk. “You think you’re better than me? Huh? Sitting in your fancy house, pretending you’ve got it all figured out? Newsflash, Henry—you lost. You’re nothing. Nothing.”

Henry chuckled, a bitter, humorless sound. “Says the gnome throwing a tantrum because he can’t handle a few words.”

Skibidi’s face turned red, his composure cracking. “Shut your mouth, old man!”

Henry leaned forward slightly, his voice dropping to a mocking whisper. “Or what, Skibidi? You gonna cry about it?”

The insult struck deep, and for a moment, Skibidi looked genuinely shaken. Then, as if to prove himself, he stepped closer, his face inches from Henry’s.

And Henry spit in his face.

The courtyard fell deathly silent.

Skibidi stood frozen for a moment, his hand wiping the spit from his cheek. His expression twisted into something feral, a mix of humiliation and unbridled rage. “You… you son of a—”

Before he could finish, one of the orcs stepped forward, picking up a hammer from a nearby workbench.

The weight of the moment hit me all at once, my breath catching in my throat as I realized what was about to happen.

“Wait!” I shouted, struggling against the ropes binding my wrists. “Don’t—”

But it was too late.

Out of respect for Henry, I won’t describe what happened next. The orc moved with brutal efficiency, his expression unreadable as he brought the hammer down. The sound echoed through the courtyard, a sickening finality that left us all stunned.

When it was over, Henry lay lifeless on the ground, his body still and broken.

For a moment, even Skibidi seemed shocked, staring down at the man who had dared to defy him. But then, as if to reassert his dominance, he began yelling insults at the corpse.

“That’s what you get!” he shouted, his voice cracking with anger. “You think you can talk to me like that? Huh? You think you’re so much better? Look at you now, Henry! Look at you!”

Each word felt like a dagger, twisting the horror of the moment deeper into my chest.

Maple let out a choked sob beside me, and I couldn’t bring myself to look at her.

Gregory and Tianna sat silent and rigid, their expressions masks of fury and grief.

And me? I couldn’t move, couldn’t think, couldn’t process what had just happened.

The storm rumbled overhead, the rain starting to fall again as if the world itself mourned the loss of Henry.

Skibidi strutted around the circle like a peacock, chest puffed out, his jagged armor clinking softly as he moved. The smug grin on his face was unbearable, the satisfaction in his eyes a cruel reminder of the horror we had just witnessed.

He wiped his hands together as though brushing off dirt, then turned to the orcs, his voice sharp and commanding. “Alright, boys, get them ready to move. Naamah’s waiting, and I don’t want to keep her waiting too long.”

The orcs grunted in unison, stepping closer to us with rough hands and heavy footsteps. One grabbed Gregory by the shoulder, shoving him upright, while another yanked Tianna to her feet.

Skibidi’s gaze roamed over us like a predator inspecting its prey, until his eyes landed on Maple.

He tilted his head slightly, his expression twisting into something colder, crueler. “Get rid of this one,” he said, his tone dismissive, as if he were throwing out garbage.

Maple froze, her face paling. “What?” she whispered, her voice trembling.

Skibidi smirked, gesturing lazily toward her. “Naamah doesn’t care about…” He paused, his eyes narrowing slightly as if savoring the words. “Locals.”

Maple’s breath hitched, and she looked desperately to Henry’s lifeless form, then to me, her eyes pleading.

“No,” I said, struggling against the ropes binding my wrists. “No, you don’t have to do this. She hasn’t done anything!”

Skibidi turned to me, his grin widening. “Oh, relax, Glenn. It’s nothing personal. She’s just… not part of the package, you know? Naamah only wants players. Not some random little NPC clinging to daddy’s coattails.”

“She’s not an NPC,” I snapped, my anger boiling over. “She’s—she’s—”

“She’s what?” Skibidi interrupted, his voice mocking. “Your girlfriend? Please. You’ve known her for all of, what, a day? Don’t get so attached, buddy. It’s just how the game works.”

One of the orcs grabbed Maple by the arm, pulling her roughly to her feet. She struggled, her movements frantic, her voice breaking as she begged. “No! Please! I—”

“Stop!” I shouted, my voice cracking as I tried to lunge forward. The ropes bit into my skin, holding me in place as the orcs dragged her away.

Gregory and Tianna were silent, their faces dark and unreadable, their hands clenched into fists.

“Come on, let’s move,” Skibidi said, clapping his hands as if this were all just a routine. “We’ve got places to be, and Naamah’s got tribute to collect.”

As Maple’s cries faded into the distance, I felt a pit open in my stomach—a hollow, gnawing emptiness that made the world around me feel suddenly colder, crueler.

And Skibidi? He just kept grinning, like he was already imagining the rewards waiting for him at Naamah’s palace.

As the orcs dragged me away, I was in a haze, my mind spinning with everything that had happened. Henry, gone. Maple, taken.
Skibidi, strutting like a king over his twisted empire. I couldn't make sense of it, couldn't find a foothold in the chaos.

But one thought clung to me, like a shard of glass buried deep in my chest: Was Skibidi only a warlord because he believed he was?

Gregory had said it, and it gnawed at me now, even as the world seemed to crumble around me. This place-this cursed, twisted world-seemed to justify itself, to warp reality to match the will of its prisoners. Skibidi wasn't powerful because he was powerful.

He was powerful because he thought he was, because the system let him be.

So why couldn't I?

The thought took root, sharp and burning in my mind. I focused on it, clinging to it as the orcs dragged me through the mud. I didn't know how this place worked-nobody did— but if Skibidi could shape it to his will, then so could I. I had to.

I squeezed my eyes shut, desperation giving way to determination. I can do this, I thought.
I can get us out of this. I just have to believe it.
Something shifted.

At first, it was subtle—a faint hum in my ears, a strange warmth spreading through my chest. But then it became unbearable.

A searing, white-hot pain tore through my body, radiating from my bones outward. I screamed, my voice raw and broken, as my muscles spasmed uncontrollably. The ropes binding me snapped like thread as my body convulsed, twisting in ways that felt impossible.

My skin bubbled and split, the pain so intense that I couldn't even tell where it ended and I began. My hands stretched, the fingers elongating into claws that ripped through the remnants of the bindings. My legs bent unnaturally, the joints snapping and reshaping themselves with sickening cracks.

I felt my face stretch and warp, my jaw elongating into a snout lined with jagged teeth. My vision blurred, then sharpened, the world becoming unnervingly vivid as colors and shapes shifted in impossible ways.

Hair—no, fur-erupted from my skin in patches, the sensation like needles stabbing through every pore. My spine arched, a tail forcing itself free with a grotesque pop. My chest expanded, my ribs straining against my skin as my heart hammered wildly, threatening to burst.

The pain was relentless, a consuming fire that devoured every part of me. My screams turned guttural, animalistic, as my voice gave way to a deep, rumbling growl.

And then it stopped.
