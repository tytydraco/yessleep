I’ve been asked many times if I’ve ever had to use the gun that I carry. The short answer is no, but you should know by now that there is never really a straight answer in my line of work. I would like to share a case with you all today that involves one of the more dangerous encounters I’ve had involving a man from approximately eight or so months ago. Just a quick warning, this case deals with sexual assault.

During our phone interview, he advised me to have my gun ready at all times. I must admit this frightened me somewhat, but also intrigued me. When he arrived, I was quite surprised to see an objectively very handsome young man: tall with dark hair and jade eyes. I’m not even interested in men, but he was strangely beautiful. I greeted him politely.

In lieu of a greeting, the man only said “please, take your gun out. Keep it pointed at me. I need it to be clear that if I come near you, I will die.”

This startled me, but I followed his instructions, drawing my weapon and training it on him. “Better?”

“Yes, thank you,” he replied gruffly, appearing oddly relaxed with my gun pointed at him.

“Okay, good,” I said, somewhat nervously. “Please take a seat on the couch over there.” I gestured in the direction of the living room with the gun.

The man proceeded toward the sofa, and I trailed after him. We both took our seats simultaneously.

“Did you bring the payment I requested?” I inquired, crossing my legs.

He nodded as he reached into his coat, retrieving an envelope. He passed it to me. “I’m sorry, would you mind grabbing me a glass of water?”

“Not at all,” I answered, springing out of my seat to fill a glass with ice and water from my fridge. I wandered back to the living room as I called, “Did you want any lemon or –“

I was cut off by the young man blocking me in the doorframe between the two rooms. We stood in a quick moment of silence before he seized me by my waist. The glass of water crashed to the floor and broke on impact. Acting purely on instinct, I rammed the butt of the gun against his head. He crumpled backwards.

“Jesus, fuck. Sit your ass down,” I commanded, following him with my gun as he made his way back to his seat.

Now, I could have insisted that he left my home immediately. I probably would have, but a look of incredible remorse spread across his face as he stammered, “I – I’m so sorry. I lost myself there for a minute. Please, don’t let me hurt you. Shoot me if you have to.”

“Believe me, I will,” I declared. “Now, I’m going to go get you another glass of water, and when I get back you better not have moved.” I left the room again, returning with a new drink. I handed it to him and resumed my position in my chair.

The young man took a long sip. “Again, I’m so sorry.”

I sighed. “It’s okay. You just flustered me a bit. When you’re ready, please begin.” I steadied myself in my seat, keeping him firmly in the sight of my gun.

“Well, for starters, I cheated on my girlfriend,” the young man began.

I had to hold back a scoff as I waited for him to add more.

“I’m a recovering sex addict. It’s hard to explain, but sex is just as addicting as alcohol or any other drug,” he explained. “I’ve been pretty good for a few years, but I guess it was a matter of time before I screwed up. My girl was out of town, and instead of staying home like I should’ve, I went out to some dive bar. I met an incredibly stunning girl there, and when she asked me to come home with her… I just couldn’t say no. She was irresistible.”

I gestured for him to continue.

He gulped down another sip of water before placing it on the end table beside him. At least he used the coaster. “I was hoping I could forget about it and just get away with not telling my girlfriend, but I wasn’t so lucky. A few weeks later, I came down with a nasty fever. Then the blisters popped up,” he described with a long sigh. “My suspicions were confirmed by my doctor. I’d contracted herpes. My girlfriend left me, and I don’t blame her. I cheated on her, that was fair.”

“I’m sorry that happened,” I assured before adding, “but, people with STIs can live happy lives and have healthy relationships with treatment.”

The young man chuckled in response. “I know, the doctors told me all that as they sent me off with some antivirals. I’m not here because I’m sad that I got herpes.”

“Oh? Why are you here then?” I pressed.

“The disease progressed in some… unexpected ways.” He paused his tale to take another sip of water before elaborating, “The blisters kept spreading past my genital area. That wasn’t initially too concerning as the name herpes literally means to creep in Greek, but the blisters do tend to be confined to more specific areas such as the mouth, genitals, or eye. I tried to stuff my worries down like I normally do, but it just kept taking over more and more of my skin.”

I nodded. “Did you see your doctor again?

“No, not right away,” he replied, shaking his head. “I only set up another appointment when I noticed some other symptoms.”

I skewed my head to one side, propping it up on one hand. “Like what?”

The young man wrung his hands together as he remarked, “There was this really weird sensation that accompanied the rash. I was told there would be some tingling and pain, but it just felt… *weird*. On top of that, I completely relapsed into my sex addiction. But it wasn’t the same as before.”

“How was it different?” I questioned.

He looked off into space for a moment, seemingly trying to find the right words to explain his circumstances. “With my sex addiction, I always had *some* control. It wasn’t much, but I knew I was doing something bad for me even though it felt great in the moment. Following my infection, I had absolutely no control. It wasn’t just a compulsive thing anymore, it was mandatory. And I hated it the whole way through. I acted differently, too. I am not a smart guy in many ways, but I always have safe sex. After I was diagnosed, I found myself pulling off the condom during sex without telling my partner. I’ve never been a great guy, but I would *never* do that. That is literal rape.”

I adjusted the gun in my hand as the man downed the rest of his water.

“When I finally saw the doctor, he was apprehensive about the changes I had seen in my personality. Because I had also developed some pretty severe headaches, he worried I might have something called herpes meningoencephalitis. Do you know what the means?” he asked.

I shook my head, no.

“Basically, that would mean that the disease creeped to my nervous system, causing swelling of my brain and the tissue that lines the brain and spinal cord. I had to have an MRI,” he sighed. “Of course, the results came out normally. Well, almost. The image was a little fuzzy, and the doctor brushed it off as accidental movement during the exam. I didn’t feel any better after that.”

“What happened after that?” I inquired.

The man’s eyes had been locked on the ground for so long that I hadn’t even noticed him beginning to cry. “It all came to a head yesterday. My sister took me in after my girlfriend dumped me, and she’s my best friend. I’m lucky to have her. Anyway, we were hanging out and just watching TV together last night. I was suddenly overcome with the obligation to… copulate. I tried to fight it, tried to get away, but my body didn’t belong to me anymore,” he sobbed. “I forced her down and raped her. Even worse, the blisters that studded my skin burst all at once and a surplus of tiny *worms* wriggled out of me. I held her nose closed and forced her to consume some of them.” By that point, he was hysterical.

I stared in silence, unsure of how to respond.

“I know now that I do not have herpes. I’m not sure what I have, but I’m harboring something that is controlling me. We know that parasites exist that can change behavior, such as toxoplasma gondii. Rodents infected with this parasite lose their natural fear of cats. That way, they are more likely to be eaten up by one of them so the parasite will be at home in its preferred feline host,” he ranted. “I’m not sure what the hell kind of parasite is inside of me, but it’s making me unfit to live in society. I raped my damn sister and I couldn’t do a thing about it. I don’t know what I’ll do next time the blisters are ready to pop.”

I waited a moment until I was sure he was finished. “If you’re ready, please lie down. I’m going to prepare the injection.”

He breathed a sigh of relief. “Thank you, miss. I’m not sure what my body will do when you try to inject me. I don’t think the parasite will let me go easily.”

As I got up to ready the procedure, I called back over my shoulder, “I figured as much. That’s why I crushed some Xanax into your water.”

When I returned with the needle, he was almost asleep. I asked him if he had any last words or wishes.

“Please, miss, just find out what the hell is inside me,” he slurred.

I requested for the medical examiner to do a full examination of the body following his passing. Indeed, there was something quite strange inside of him. I’m not sure how to explain it exactly, but I was informed that a long worm had attached itself at the base of his spine, stretching up his spinal cord all the way into his brain. The movement detected on the MRI was the creature writhing in the sulci – the creases and indentations – [of his brain](https://www.reddit.com/r/hercreation/).
