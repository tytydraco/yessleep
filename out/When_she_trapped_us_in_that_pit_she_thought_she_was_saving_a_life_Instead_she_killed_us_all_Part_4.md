[Time slowed down.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15592q9/when_she_trapped_us_in_that_pit_she_thought_she/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) First, the stench hit me with an overwhelming mixture of strong decay and wet dog. And then with a strangled cry, Alice kicked at the monstrous hand. Her movements were frantic and desperate, but the grip only seemed to tighten, making her wince in pain. Slowly, the minotaur's head emerged from the water, one side skeletal with its empty eye socket, and the other marked with a glowing, scarred eye fixated on Alice. Dark blood and tar seeped out as Ryan stabbed it, and it made a loud grunting sound of annoyance and pain. Abruptly, it turned its gaze on Ryan, releasing Alice and seizing him instead. With a powerful yank, Ryan was brought down hard onto the ground.

With Alice free from its grasp, I made a desperate attempt to strike it in the face with my walking stick, managing to land only a single blow. But just as quickly as it had appeared, it suddenly receded back beneath the water's surface. My last memory of Ryan is of his hands clawing at the ground as he was forcefully dragged into the water. And I still remember his face. That poor boy's face was filled with terror and panic as it vanished under the murky surface.

I got Alice up. Our clothes stuck to our bodies, drenched in water. She clung to me, tears streaming down her face. Together, we rushed towards the edge of the water. We had to get away from the water, away from the monster. We had to find someplace safe, to recollect ourselves and to figure out our next move. But Alice was limping badly. I held my arm over her to assist, and we knew there was no way to avoid the fact that we were going to be even slower now.

I continued to look behind us, but the water was now still. We reached the edge and she suddenly pulled out the lighter and bug spray out of her pocket and began spraying the leaves with her now miniature flamethrower. *Ryan must have handed it to her at some point as we were walking. Why didn’t she use it? We might've stood a chance if she had.* “Fuck this place!! I’m going to send all of it to Hell, all of it!” As expected, the soaked leaves didn’t catch, but she didn’t care. I watched as she stood there shaking, spraying all of it to no avail. She was screaming at the forest like a madwoman, seemingly uncaring that the creature might hear her and come for us. She was mentally collapsing. She was at the point where she wasn’t able to function anymore.

I debated whether I should run and leave her.

But I couldn’t. I couldn’t leave Alice to face the creature alone, any more than Ryan had been able to. He had given his life trying to save her, and I owed him, at the very least, the honor of his sacrifice.

"Come on, Alice," I said, grabbing the flamethrower from her and pulling her away. "We can't stay here. I’m sorry. We need to move." Alice didn't protest, but she didn't say anything either. She simply allowed me to guide her away, her eyes blank, staring ahead into the thick undergrowth of the forest. We continued along the trail. “Are you okay?” I asked Alice. Her breaths were ragged, matching the rhythm of her limping walk. She nodded but didn’t look at me. Her gaze was somewhere far off, lost in her thoughts. The fear in her eyes from before had been replaced by a shell-shocked emptiness. She looked filthy and exhausted, covered in mud and grime. I probably looked the same.

And then the whispering started again.

This time, I couldn’t tell from what direction. It was as if it was all bouncing off of the trees and was all around us. Alice’s face switched back into the look of terror, this time mixed with frustration and a look of surrender. She was done, and I knew it. In a hushed voice, I pleaded to her. “Alice, we must leave. We have to run, now. I can... I can try to carry you.” She just shook her head. “No Micheal. I can’t. He’s gone.” She let out a soft whimper. “My sweet Ryan is gone. I can’t do this anymore.” Some rustling sounded from the right side, somewhere in the brush where we couldn’t see it. I placed my hand on her shoulder and looked her in the eyes. My mind flooded with panic as I tried to think of what I could say to convince her. “Alice, please. Please! We need to leave.”

She calmly took my arm off, placed her pepper spray into my hand, and said “just go”. She then sat on the ground, leaning against one of the half-sunken trees. More rustling, much closer now. And so, just like always, I ran away. Like a coward, leaving my friend to face their death alone. I ran as quickly as my feet would take me through the mud and silt. But not far away enough to miss hearing her wailing scream and then the sounds of several voices screaming through the trees.

***“DON'T LET IT CATCH YOU... \*sobbing\*…THIS PLACE... TORMENT... DESTORY...\*inaudible\*… WE’RE TRAPPED... SAVE US.”***

I could hear Ryan’s voice amongst them. Alice again screamed. And then silence.

As I continued running, I once again began to recognize the trail. Apprehension hit me as I knew what was happening. I looked off from the trail, and not too far, there was the cave staring back at me. Inviting me back inside, tempting me that it was safe. I understood Alice's torment – the overwhelming exhaustion, the suffering, the enticement to surrender and bring it all to a close if it meant escaping the Hell I was trapped in. I might have succumbed to the temptation, were it not for the horrific screams that erupted from the beast's mouth. Those screams were a chilling hint that no matter how dreadful my situation felt, there existed a place of even greater horror from where those cries originated.

A hollow gnawing sensation ate at my insides, pushing me towards the elevator, yet I found myself resistant. The choice seemed hopeless, to either perish from the beast among the crocodiles and mud, or to perish from the beast after being found somewhere down there like a cornered rat. I turned around and my eyes investigated the swamp. Crickets chirped amongst the trees. An occasional bird in the distance flew across the sky. I*t is peaceful, in a way. Peaceful to finish out here... even if it is all just an illusion.* The thought of venturing back onto the trail crossed my mind, but after evaluating the forward path, it was clearly flooded.

I turned back to the elevator. *No. I need to find a way out. I need to make sure my friends didn’t die in vain.* I only took one step in, afraid that it could close on me before I could change my mind. Its single light bulb was almost blinding after I had been in the dark for so long. Same case as before, the only button that was lighting up was the down button. I took a look at the elevators map.

I exhaled a heavy sigh, pressing my back against the cold steel frame of the elevator's entrance. A sizable gash marred the elevator wall, a memento of the minotaur's hurled spear. I stared at it for a moment, and then began to sob. *How did we get here? How did all of this happen? I miss my friends. I miss my family.* Moments turned into minutes as I debated to myself whether going back into the elevator was the stupidest thing I could do. What if I really was outside? What if there was a way out and I was about to turn my back on it?

I decided to take a short video on my phone of myself saying goodbye to my family and attempting to explain what happened to Tanner, Ryan and Alice, although I realized none of it made any sense. I then took my second step into the elevator. I stared out at the forest, scanning the trees. And then I clicked the down elevator button, sealing the decision.

As the elevator began descending, I opened my backpack and pulled out a granola bar. I took a bite of it, chewed on it for a moment, and then placed it back into the backpack. I hadn’t eaten all day, but my stomach felt as if it was sitting in my throat. The descending elevator slowed, and the floor number changed from 4 to 3 with a \**ding*\*. The doors opened. My last ounce of hope of getting to safety was quickly reignited.

The room resembled the grandeur of an expansive Catholic cathedral, its proportions striking me with its immensity. A panorama of intricate etchings filled the walls, stretching on either side of the expanse, leading one's gaze toward a raised platform at the room's farthest end. A trio of colossal skeletal statues etched into the stone loomed overhead the platform, each holding a large cup in front of them. High above, fractured and cracked stained-glass windows punctuated the upper reaches of the walls. Their elongated frames ascended, intersecting at the apex to sketch an artwork of Xs on the ceiling.

I hesitantly stepped inside. The room was much brighter than any other area since we had walked into the cave. I squinted as I saw several grand chandeliers radiating white light from the ceiling. I was about to continue onward when I remembered the elevator map. “Floor three,” I whispered to myself. “Catacombs”. My gaze returned to the titanic skeletal trio, noting now the doors that lay beneath each. Beyond their offered cups, their other hands clasped distinct objects: a compass, an hourglass, and a scroll, from left to right.

“I can’t go where it expects me to. I need to escape, and that means taking a route it won’t expect.” I walked along the wall and peered outside one of the windows. The stained glass masked the outside world with its vibrant hues, revealing only a blur of white. Scattered around the room were several stout tables with old vases on them, each one showcasing artwork of people. With only adrenaline left to fuel my exhausted body, I grunted, hefting one of the tables towards the window. To my surprise, the heavy table met the glass with an impactful crack, and a web of fractures bloomed across the surface.

With some hope, I picked up the table again and threw it into the window, this time shattering a large section of it. Immediately, wind filled the room with circulating air. Filled with anticipation, I rushed to look outside, hoping against hope to find a way out

A sea of swirling clouds.

Not above me, but below me in every direction. The sudden scene left me breathless in shock and I looked around and could see that whatever building I was in was at the top of some exceedingly high mountain. Being an almost entirely vertical drop, I knew it was steeper than anything possible to climb down. There were windows lining the side of the castle I was in, some with broken steel bars and others with more glass. Other than that, the side of the building was bare with dark colored bricks. *Could I make it down somehow? What if I found some rope, or bed sheets like in the movies?* I knew it was impossible, but I was trying to convince myself there was still a chance I could survive this.

As I stared out the window into the endless clouds, a small thought that I could jump entered my mind before I quickly brushed it away. Thoughts of escaping reentered into my mind, and I decided my best odds were to step back into the elevator. *It’s my only chance to get out of here, is getting to floor one and finding an exit. Remember, all of this is an illusion anyway. Some kind of trick.*

I hit the down button and was startled as the skeletal figures together all pivoted their heads at me during the last second before the elevator doors shut. The next level was titled “Ritual”. Trying to anticipate what the next floor would embellish, I pictured a room like the last but with an altar in the middle of the room and candles strewn around.

After a few seconds of descending, the elevator rang out with its \**ding*\* and I stood at the rear of the elevator as the doors opened. What unveiled was unexpected – a compact space, awash in the pristine sheen of polished white marble. The room was minimalistic, with not a single imperfection catching my eye. Centered in the room was a large mirror protruding from the floor, a bowl in front of it filled with black liquid, and protruding from the bowl was a single candle with a green flame.

Desperate to just find an exit, I stretched my arm out to hit the down button again, but it froze, like I had just touched an electric fence. My sight suddenly moved back to the candle. An unseen force tugged at my being, compelling me to draw nearer and walk to my reflection. I hardly felt in control of my own body.    
  
“I must see. I must see." I found myself whispering out loud.    
  
The room contained no doors and no windows, and the only light source was the small green candle fire and a soft hue of white light illuminating from beneath the floor. No matter how hard I tried, my feet refused to turn back. Drawn to the bowl, my finger skimmed its surface, emerging coated in the inky liquid. It smelled like ink. Raising my eyes, the mirror revealed myself in its reflection: muddy, wearied, and marred with scratches.    
  
Though a corner of my mind screamed in urging retreat, I was ensnared in a spell that rendered my body a mere puppet. My ink-dipped finger, seemingly of its own volition, approached the smooth, cold surface of the mirror. As my finger made contact, the dark liquid flowed seamlessly onto the mirror, crafting unrecognizable symbols and letters. My left arm grabbed my right and attempted to pull it away from the mirror. I literally had to yank it to get it to stop writing. Blinking, I strained to comprehend the symbols I had just written, but they were gibberish and cryptic.    
  
The scene in the mirror began to distort and change. I had no choice but to watch in horror as my self reflection began to twitch and then slowly grew taller, hairier, and skin began to peel off. From the top of my head emerged a small horn, and my reflection showed me a large, twisted smile. *I have to get to the elevator, NOW.*    
  
But I couldn’t move. I was paralyzed in place, doomed to whatever trap I had fallen into. My brain rushed to think of a way out of this, and then I remembered something I had learned in my college physiology class called withdrawal reflexes, or the ability for muscles to move without your brain deciding to do so. I was right next to the candles flame. If I were able to move towards it just a little, I could touch it with my elbow and maybe that would kick me out of this hypnotic state. It took all of my strength to move only inches, but I succeeded as my elbow was pushed into the fire and my body jolted backwards.    
  
Still not in complete control, I lifted one foot in front of the other as I forced my body back to the elevator. Each step I took felt like an eternity as I moved, and as I walked I extended my hands, reaching for the elevator's edges so I could propel myself into it once reached. A voice came from behind me. It was my voice, but deeper and distorted. “YOU CAN’T RUN! YOU’LL NEVER ESCAPE THIS PLACE!” The reflection then laughed. As I finally climbed back into the elevator, I turned around and looked back at the mirror. From my point of view, I couldn't see exactly what was in the mirror anymore. I didn’t stay to find out. 

As I sat in the elevator waiting for it to reach floor 1, I began to feel sick. My body was giving out on me. I clutched my stomach, leaning against the elevator's cold steel wall. The elevator gave its groaning sounds of the machinery and a soft vibration under my feet. My breaths came short and ragged. I could feel a dull ache in the center of my chest. The whispers, the swamp, the tricks, it all twisted together in my mind as if it were squeezing my brain.

There was an image that played in my mind, uninvited and unwelcome: the face of the minotaur, the scarred eye staring hungrily, the monstrosity killing my friends. My friends... I could still hear Ryan's voice, calling out in anguish, Alice's terrified screams, Tanner's legs kicking in the air. The minotaur... the beast. It had taken them all.

After the elevators normal chime signaling that we had reached floor 1, the doors opened for the last time. It was dark... so dark that I couldn’t see anything past the elevator light. It reminded me of the vantablack videos on science youtube channels I had used to watch. I pointed my flashlight out and flipped it on... but nothing. It was dead, which made no sense because it was brand new. I opened the backpack and pulled out a second flashlight. Same thing, it wouldn’t turn on. My eyes squinted as I looked out of the elevator, but I couldn’t pick up a single inch of texture.

"It won't end like this" I whispered to myself. Tears welled in my eyes. “I can’t be afraid”. I stood up straight and pulled out the bug spray and cigarette lighter. I tested the miniature flamethrower, and it worked as well as you’d expect. It was lighting up the ground though, and that was better than walking through complete darkness. “Either I escape from this nightmare and come back with the police, or I kill that damn monster here and now.”

I rolled my shoulders back and took a deep breath. I looked up at the elevator light one last time, thinking of the last time I had seen the sun. How much I had taken it for granted. "If it's death it wants, it won't be mine without a fight."

And with that, I started walking [into the darkness.](https://www.reddit.com/user/UnderdonetoastHorror)
