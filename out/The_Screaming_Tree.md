I know that this is long and deeply irrelevant to your life, however recent events have forced these memories to resurface. I am writing this down to catalogue what happened and maybe find a way to move on. Anyways, here goes.

 

You know how when you’re a kid the whole world is yours to explore and make your own? The never-ending new discoveries made together with your friends and the perpetual search for the next place to hang. This is what I did during the short years I was an innocent child in the early 2000s together with my brother and his friend, George, and my best friend, Ellen. I didn’t really know George that well because we only ever hung out when my brother was around but even, I can tell you that his pale and freckled face always had the biggest smile on it. He was our expeditions leader when we were out adventuring, it was like he was born to do it. My brother Kevin and I were very similar, and still are, in the fact that we love the outdoors and to this day continue exploring the untamed wilderness around the world. We recently finished a trip in the Argentine Patagonia where we flew into Santiago, Chile, hiked and hitched rides down along the border between the two countries until we reached the Patagonia region. From there we essentially went in a straight line to the Argentinian coast where we bathed in the salty and firm waves of the South Atlantic, basked in the heavenly glow of the warm sun and eventually started hiking to Buenos Aires for our trip home.  
Then there was Ellen, my best friend and the most amazing person I’ve ever met even to this day. We met in primary school when we were around 8, she’d recently moved to our town, so she was completely alone and to be honest, so was I. I had friends during my early years but never someone I could just sit around with doing nothing, let alone call them my best friend. Ellen radiated the most amazing energy and always seemed to brighten the space in which she would inhabit. Her golden hair would always glisten and draw attention, her piercing yet soft sky-blue eyes could spot you feeling down from a mile away and she would never hesitate to help you with whatever you’d need. At that age when all girls were disgusting and being kissed by one was considered punishment if you lost a game with your friends, I could tell that Ellen was beautiful. Even with all these qualities, she never really would make that many friends but the friends she made, like Kevin and me, were to die for. This never made sense to me as a kid, how could someone so radiant and kind only really have two friends? If I didn’t understand why when I was younger, I do now.

During the year of 2005, we had remarkably ramped up our expeditions in terms of length and the level of extreme. Extreme as 10-year-olds usually meant staying the night without our parents coming along with us. We kept learning new tricks when camping, using our gear properly and being able to plan, and pull off, some impressive hikes for primary school children. All this eventually accumulated into us building up our courage to follow Ellen’s parents up to their lodge up in the North-Western part of the Swedish mountains. Since all our parents had gotten to be good friends, we waited for the perfect opportunity to ambush them when they were all gathered. Them drinking wine also made this operation go smoother, because we knew that wine made the more malleable. George, our de facto leader, took to the stage.

“Ladies and gentlemen of the court, I hereby demand your full attention” he shouted with a clearly rehearsed demeanour, but it sure did work. All the grown-ups now paid attention to us like a captive audience waiting for the climax of the show. He continued.

“As you all know, our good, nay dear, friend Ellen and her parents have a house in Lappland and we would like to go there.” He said with a muzzled tone, obviously forgetting the rest of his planned speech.

“Mom, dad, can they please come next time we go? Their parents can even pack their own food, so you don’t have to worry about it!” Ellen interjected while giving a not-so-subtle wink to my parents. The parents sat silently while holding in their laughter.

“I’ve never had friends over there and I think it would be fun, we were thinking about camping there too and you guys can even come if you want to! Please?” She was now jumping up and down with her tiny, freckled hands held together in a prayer.

“Oh honey of course!” Ellen’s mother began. “But it’s really not up to us, I think us grown-ups have to chat about it first, okay sweetie?” All the hopeful joy drained from her face, and she simply nodded and then left the room with us following suit.

We all sat there just outside the room were our parents were, waiting for the verdict to arrive and if it came back that we couldn’t go, we knew who the ones would say no. George was raised by a single father, as adults our parents told us that his mother had died in a car accident soon after George was born. His father had become somewhat of a recluse and never really did pay much attention to him, he practically raised himself. He would always be at our house hanging out with Kevin and I always assumed it was because they were best friends, but now I see that there was so much more to it. His father would be the easiest yes to acquire, since it really seemed that he didn’t care to be honest. Ellen’s parents always loved when we came over, they loved seeing her with friends and they had basically already said yes. Our parents were the roadblock, they were the last to let us stay the night by ourselves when camping and they were always first to say no when we asked to explore deeper in the woods. Surprisingly, George’s dad called us back into the room rather quickly and they all told us the good news, Ellen and her parents were heading up this weekend and we could all go. We all celebrated and immediately started to plan what we were going to do and where we would explore. We all thought it would be the greatest weekend ever and one to remember until the day we all grow old. I have been trying to push this memory out of my mind ever since.

Their cabin was a humble house. It had everything you’d need, but not much more. One bedroom, one small kitchen, a living room and an outside bathroom. This was heaven for us young globetrotters because it forced us to be outside all day. We arrived late in the evening, so we started to unpack all our stuff to make sure everything was in order while Ellen’s parents were making dinner. We went over our plans for the weekend when Ellen’s demeanour changed abruptly.

“Actually guys, I have something I want to show you in the morning, but we can’t tell my parents about it, got it?” She said in a shushed, blank tone.

“Show us what? Is it a cave? Or a ravine? Or.” Kevin got cut off midway through his sentence by a kick in the leg by me. He looked at me like he was going to take my leg off in revenge but that would have to wait.

“It’s not a cave, Kevin, it’s something much more special. I’ll show you.” At this point Ellen looked almost possessed with all the softness of her eyes turning into a jagged gaze. I glanced at her with a confused and concerned look.

“What do you mean Ellen? Just tell us, you know how easily George gets spooked by ghost stories” I said and shot him a grimaced look.

“Hey at least I didn’t lose a game of arm-wrestling with a girl” She shouted while shifting into a defensive stance.

“That was one time George let it go, plus she was really fat so it’s unfair anyways.” I said, knowing that defeat had already befallen me.

Ellen’s parents called us for dinner and Ellen seemed to snap out of whatever state she was in and shouted “Coming!”. Kevin and I exchanged a confused look, and I made a mental note to check in on her later, but later never came. We were all beat from the 5-hour drive over, 4 kids sharing 3 seats is a recipe for fighting but it was mostly just some pushing and George farting while blaming it on Ellen.

When the morning arrived, I think we’d all forgotten about Ellen’s new plan for us, so we ate breakfast, packed our stuff, went over our route with her parents and off we were. It was a beautiful summer day, the sun welcomed us as we stepped out, the cool breeze pushed us forward and the birds cheered us on as we went. We followed the trail for about an hour when suddenly we heard Ellen, with the same hollow tone as yesterday.

“Turn left here George.”

It seemed we all repressed her change of plans as we all stood on the trail, confused.

“Oh, right the special thing, is it far? I really don’t want to waste much time looking for something that I’m not even sure exists, Ellen.” Kevin said with a tired tone. “We can take a break to talk about it, yeah?”

“Hell no man!” We heard George shout from faraway, seemed like he had kept walking. “You don’t change the route last minute, Ellen! You should’ve mentioned it sooner!”

Ellen didn’t even react to what Kevin or George had said, she just stared into the forest, eyes wide open.

“Can you hear it?” She whispered to herself and like a deer hearing danger, shifted her head and perked her ears to listen to her environment. At this point George had made his way back to us and we were all just standing here, in awe, of what is happening to our friend.

“You guys coming?” She whispered, but to us this time.

“Ellen what the hell are you doing? Let’s just keep going on the trail” George shakily said while his eyes darted back and forwards between Ellen and the trail. Ellen’s head slowly turned back into the forest and started marching.

“Suit yourself, but it really is something special.” Her tone had shifted from hollow to jolly, as if in love and waiting to meet your soulmate just a few kilometres into the thick bush. I ran in front of her and grabbed her shoulders and quite dramatically started shaking her.

“Let her go damn it! Take me instead!” George, Kevin and I had watched The Exorcist the week prior. It seemed to work for a few seconds because she just looked at me, her eyes had shifted back to their beautiful normal.

“I want to take you, take you all. Guys it’s not that far can you just come with?” Her tone was now normal and put us all at ease, and for better or worse, we took us to see the special tree.

As we were marching, Ellen now leading, Kevin tapped me on the shoulder.

“Dude, tell your girlfriend she’s crazy, crazier that that Exorcist lady!”

“Back off man, she’s not crazy and she’s not my girlfriend either!” I whispered back to him while swinging my elbow trying to hit him.

“Sucks to be you man, but she’s kind of crazy.” He said and swiftly dodged my kick coming his way. Our brotherly love had distracted us long enough to bump into Ellen and I fell to the ground.

“Isn’t it amazing? It’s beautiful, can you hear it?” I could now hear to infatuation in Ellen’s voice and as my body rose from the ground, so did my eyes and what they saw, was truly special. In the middle of this forest of pine, birch and aspen tree’s, stood a horror. A trunk as thick as tires stack on top of each other, a complexion of a deep, dark red, sap with the colour and consistency of oil, a smell of metal and death, spider leg-like branches looking to pierce you. But worst of all, a sound of thousands of years of torment.

“Can you hear it? It’s louder than usual, it’s more beautiful than ever, don’t you think?” I don’t know if Ellen was talking to us or herself, her soft and nurturing voice now once again, shifted into a fascination and infatuation for this monument before her. I looked over at Kevin who looked back at me with a clear ‘I told you so’ face. George however, had his gaze fixed on the tree before us, I couldn’t tell if he was scared like us or infatuated like Ellen. Ellen looked back at us for the first time in over an hour, gentle tears were rolling down her face. I was completely frozen, my legs had given out on me, my ears were pulsing from the sound that emanated from the horror before us. I managed to turn my head towards Kevin and George, only to see that George was nowhere to be found.

“Kevin, where’s George?” My trembling mouth could barely get these three words out, but it was still more than what Kevin could mutter.

“There.” He pointed to the tree and behind it, on his knees, were George. He was almost close enough to touch it, his head crane up towards the top of the tree. Like Ellen, he was crying too, but the tears formed on his face were not gentle or soft, they were from pain. My legs still not working I again looked over to Kevin.

“You okay, man? I think I hurt my legs or something.”

“Yeah, I think I’m good, just give me a second I’ll come over and help you up” He responded with a grunt as he forced his way up. When we finally got up and caught our breath, we started to walk away when I got the sinking feeling that something was very wrong. I don’t know when, I don’t know how, but the screaming had stopped. I think Kevin realized it too and when we turned around, there it was, a normal pine.

I don’t know why we started walking away without checking on Ellen or George. I don’t know what happened to them, could we have prevented what happened somehow? What really did happen? It’s all a blur to me, Kevin and I essentially sprinted back to Ellen’s parents and when they asked where the rest of our party were, we had no words for it.

Life just sort of happened after that, Kevin and I somehow managed to forget all that happened that weekend. A police report was filed but no wrongdoing was found on our parts, no bodies, no evidence of a crime, right? Our family moved away shortly after all this and we restarted, I guess. Kevin and I were not allowed to go camping anymore, no more expeditions. Our father had become quiet and distant, and our mother had turned to alcohol to cope with it all. When we got older and moved away for university, Kevin and I eventually found our way back into the wilderness. Life was good, it was like nothing had happened.

This all came back to me when one day, when I was out chopping firewood to dry for the coming winter, my head and ears starting pulsing, like it had so many years before. I went to sit down by the porch, head down in my hands when finally, the pulsing stopped. As I lifted my head out of my hands, my eyes drifted towards the edge of the forest by my property. I could hear something, something far away but moving closer. It was screaming, the same screaming I had heard all those years ago. I swear that, just inside of the forests edge, stood the tree that had taken my friends. This, however, was not the thing that sent me over the edge and brought all these horrific memories back, what did that, was Ellen.

“Can you hear it, Mike?”
