 Sorry if this block of text is hard to read as I am not the best when it comes to getting my point across in writing, however here we go.  
For these encounters I will need to give some background info about the house I am living in and the layout of the house. I live in a shared house with 9 other people, its a big house having 5 floors that are split into 2 separate apartments and we are all long term friends that live in this house (including my girlfriend). The house layout is as follows (starting from the bottom to the top): A basement with 4 bedrooms and 2 toilet/bathrooms, following up a small staircase (that is not connected to the main stairs) leads into the kitchen and living area for the lower apartment, exiting out of the front door of the lower apartment leads into a small corridor that has the exit to the house and the front door to my apartment (upper apartment), following through the front door of my apartment leads to the main staircase of the house that leads all the way up to my room at the top floor (the stairs are set out in blocks of 10 - 12 that double back on each other kinda in a spiral), going up the first block of stairs leads to 1 bedroom and a toilet/bathroom, following up the stairs again leads to our kitchen and living area, following up the next block of stairs leads to another bedroom and toilet / bathroom and finally following up the final block of stairs leads to 3 bedrooms on the top floor.

**1st Encounter**  
For context my girlfriend lives in the downstairs apartment and has a bedroom in the basement. We where all in the lower apartment just chilling out and having a few drinks and watching some movies (this was back in like 2021/22). It started to get extremely late and me and my girlfriend where getting tired so we said goodnight and headed to her room in the basement and fell asleep. When I woke up the next day my friend who lives on the floor underneath me asked what I was doing last night just standing on the stairs looking at him, I asked him what he was talking about as I was super confused and he explained that when he had gone to bed around 3-4am he walked up the stairs that led to his room and said I was just stood motionless on the stairs in my boxers just looking at him, he said he thought nothing of it as he thought I was just going to the toilet or something (which is next to his room) and he gave me a nod and went to bed. I explained to him that I stayed in my girlfriends room all night and even woke up there in the morning and that I had not went all the way up to my room for anything that night, furthermore in order for me to exit the lower apartment and walk up to my room I would have had to walk past everyone that was still up chilling in the living area (which did not happen), not only that hypothetically even if I was a ninja while sleepwalking I do not have a house key for the lower apartment so for me to get back into my girlfriends room I would have to get someone to open the door for me **(AND I DONT SLEEP WALK!).** After all of this we just chalked it up to him being tired and seeing something that wasn't there however that does not sit right with me and him still to this day.

**2nd Encounter**  
This encounter happened a few months after the 1st encounter. My girlfriend was in the lower apartment living area just chilling out on her phone at 1am, she did this because I play in video game communities that do their events in a different time zone and she would go downstairs as to not disturb what I was doing. during this time she fell asleep on the sofa and after my event (around 3:30 - 4am) I headed downstairs to go and see her (she had propped her apartment door open so I could come down whenever I was finished) and she wasn't on the sofa, I assumed she got tired and had gone to bed so I go downstairs to her bedroom where I find her sleeping in bed, she wakes up from her sleep when I enter the room and after a few minutes she thanked me for coming down and taking her to bed. I explain that I had never come down during my event and I didn't take her to bed and that me being in the room now was the first time I had come down. She looked confused and explained to me that apparently she had fell asleep on the sofa and I had woken her up and told her 'you cant sleep down here, you should go to bed' and then took her downstairs to her bed and put her to sleep, I asked her if I had just left after that and she said she didn't know as she fell asleep very fast after getting into bed. I then told her the story of the first encounter because I was spooked and lets just say we both got royally spooked together but just kinda put it to the back of our minds and forgot about it.

The reason I am posting this and remembering these encounters now is because I recently learned about doppelg√§ngers or people that look and try to act like you and it gives me goosebumps. I asked my girlfriend about what she thinks about everything today when I told her I was going to make a reddit post and she said she didn't know, I told her to ask her mom (my girlfriends mom is religious) and my girlfriend said her mom told her about Jinn (a spirit acknowledged in Islam) which can take the form of a human. Honestly i have no idea what this could be and it baffles me every time I think about it so any help or answers would be greatly appreciated.  
Thanks All.  
p.s. I have other weird shit that happens in the house but its small stuff like lights turning off etc, if people would want to hear about it ill make another post.
