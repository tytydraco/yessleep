Growing up, I lived in a pretty Christian household. Parents reading Bible stories to me as I fell asleep, grandparents taking me to church every Sunday, and other things in a similar vein. As I got older, I started to move away from religion and started to look at the world through a more scientific lens. Now, though, I have reason to believe the Christian God does exist.

Recently I've been pretty bored with my life; everything is moving at a snail's pace with no exciting events coming up. That's where I got the amazing idea to pray to God. It wasn't a normal prayer, though; instead of thanking God for all my blessings and whatnot, I asked a singular favor.

"God, please open my eyes, allow me to see everything I wasn't supposed to, allow me to see everything hiding among us. In Jesus name, Amen."

At the time, I didn't think much would come of it. I peacefully went to sleep that night with my sanity intact and woke up the next morning with absolutely no change. I went about my normal Monday morning routine of chugging a coffee, eating breakfast, smoking a joint, and taking a shower in preparation for the day ahead. When I was locking my front door as I was leaving for work, I noticed a tall, sickly-looking figure standing at the tree line just across the street from my home. As soon as my gaze focused on the location of where the figure was supposed to be, it vanished. At that point I chalked it up to my hair getting in my eyes mixed with the fact that the sun had just started to rise and it was foggy, not even remembering the prayer I had made the night before.

The rest of the day was uneventful, an average workday, and a long commute back home as expected. I arrived at home around dusk, dragging my feet along the concrete of my driveway out of exhaustion. When I got to my door, I noticed the same exact figure in the same exact location as it was this morning. Except this time when I focused my gaze on where it was, it didn't instantly vanish. Instead, it quickly did a sidestep-esque motion and darted out of view. I still hadn't remembered the prayer from the night before, but I was a little disturbed. The next morning I followed the same routine without incident, and this time the figure wasn't observing me from the tree line. What did happen was objectively more horrifying, though. I got in my car and inserted the keys into the ignition as I checked my mirrors, and what I presume was the same figure from the previous day was standing right at the end of the driveway. This time I could get a good glimpse at its features before blinking and it disappearing; it was unearthly pale, almost glowing from the peeking sun shining down on its skin, with matted and messy hair accompanied by its blank, dead eyes and its frown stretching down to its chin, showing off its chipped, yellow, jagged teeth off in the process.

I was rightly terrified, shuffling to put my car in reverse, stomping on the gas doing so. I was contemplating seeing a psychiatrist before thinking back to 2 nights ago, when I prayed that prayer. The prayer and sighting of what I now classified as a demon haunted my psyche for the rest of the day. As I arrived home, I rushed to my door and frantically unlocked it, not even checking my surroundings to see if the demon was waiting for me to arrive. Every room I entered, I turned the lights on; even when exiting, I didn't turn them off. I even ended up sleeping with a nightlight next to my bed. The next day *mostly* went off without a hitch. No tree line figures or car mirror demons today. When arriving back home, I chuckled at the thought of a demon stalking me of all people.

That was until I attempted to sleep; as I was drifting off into unconsciousness, I heard three consecutive knocks on the window behind my bed. I jolted awake, looked at my window, and it had the writing "Don't be afraid" engraved into it, but not from the outside; it was engraved from the inside. I was too scared to sleep in my bedroom, so I grabbed a pillow, the revolver sitting in my nightstand drawer, and proceeded to sleep on the couch. Even then it took hours for me to fall asleep, and that was reflected by how groggy and tired I was upon waking up. As I entered the bathroom to brush my teeth and shower, the light was turned off, even though the previous night I had left it on. For a split second after the lights came on, I could see those same dead eyes staring directly into me through the mirror. I gasped and stumbled backward, shaking with fear. As I got up, I could see the mirror, and the demon was gone, but now it was inside my house, possessing it. With my deteriorating mental and physical condition, I should have called out sick to my job, but I couldn't bring myself to be in the same home as the thing that was stalking me. On my way to work, I called my friend, Thomas, to see if he wanted to come over and have a few drinks after I got off work, thinking it'd be a good way to ease my anxiety from this ordeal, and maybe if he could see it too, I'd prove to myself that I wasn't going crazy.

After work I picked him up from his house, catching up on the drive to my place as it'd been a while since we talked.

"So how do you like living alone? Doesn't it get lonely at some point?" Thomas inquired.

"Yeah, it does. Why'd you think I invited you over?" I asked.

"Because there's a demon stalking you, and you feel crazy." Thomas replied.

I let my foot off the gas until we came to a stop. I looked over at Thomas, and his body was elongated, with his head turned at a sharp 90-degree angle to fit inside, almost like his neck was snapped. When I looked at his face, though, when I looked at his face. He had the exact dead eyes and teeth of the demon that had been stalking me, the same unearthly pale skin. Except in this instance the demon wasn't frowning; it was smiling from ear to ear as its chapped lips dripped blood. I jumped out of the car and ran and ran and ran and ran.

I'm lost in a forest now, writing this with 1 bar of service and 2 percent battery. It has been 2 hours since I jumped out of the car, and it's pitch black besides the faint glow of the moon and my phone screen. No matter where I look, I see it in the corner of my eyes, and every time I blink, I hear a step being taken on the crunchy, dead leaves below me. It's only getting closer; I'm not sure what it wants with me, but I don't imagine it's pretty. Is there any way to ward it off?  Please, don't end up like me; don't ask God to open your 3rd eye; it will not end well.
