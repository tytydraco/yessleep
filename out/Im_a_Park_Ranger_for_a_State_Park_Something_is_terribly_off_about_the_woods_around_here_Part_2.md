“Those black bears are a lot more vicious than you think,” Miranda was explaining to Donny. “Never get between a mother bear and her cubs. She’ll tear you right to pieces. I had an uncle out in Fort Wayne…”

I closed the curtains, the metal rings screeching against the curtain rod. Then I turned back to the four of them, my heart pounding in my chest.

“I’m gonna head to the bathroom,” Donny interrupted, slipping past them. “Be right back. You still pay us for bathroom time, right? Like the clock’s still running?”

Miranda rolled her eyes. “Yes, Donny.”

He disappeared into the back of the building—which gave me the perfect time to confront them. Miranda glanced at me, then continued towards the door. Jackie and Davis followed her. Without so much as a goodbye, she reached for the doorknob.

“Wait! You can’t go out there. I saw something in the woods.”

The three of them exchanged looks. Miranda took her hand off the doorknob and turned towards me. “What did you see?”

“There was someone standing there. Just at the tree line. And the caution tape is down—ripped in two.” I glared at her. “Are you going to tell me a bear did that? Or are you going to tell us what's really going on?”

She glanced between Jackie and Davis.

“Okay. Okay, fine.” She sat down across from me and heaved a sigh. “We think there’s some sort of… murderer… on the loose.”

“*What?”*

“It only started happening a few months ago. This town, this park… they were always so safe. The worst incident we had in five years was somebody had their dog off their leash and it bit someone. We had nothing, no weirdos, no bear attacks, *nothing.*

“But then, three months ago, Emily Johnson went missing. She disappeared after she went for a jog on the red trail. It was all over the news, especially because she was a pretty blonde 20-something. Missing white woman syndrome and all that. People had all kinds of theories. That she was nabbed by some stalker or serial killer or whatever. We had volunteer search parties combing the woods, Park Rangers combing the forest, all of that. We even had people leaving flowers and teddy bears along the red trail, where she disappeared. And that’s when the next… incident… happened.”

Miranda hesitated, glancing at Jackie than at Davis.

“One of these people, holding a vigil or whatever, disappeared. It was an older woman, who’d known Emily as a student or something. She was just—gone. No trace of her. We redoubled our search efforts, but we didn’t find anything about her, either. In the past three months, a total of five people have gone missing. All women. All from the red trail—never from any other trail.”

She grimaced.

“Then, one morning while out on patrol about a week after the second woman disappeared, Jackie found Emily’s sneakers. And it was like your pictures of the hat and jacket—the shoes were placed next to each other, and the shoelaces were tied in neat little bows. It was obviously staged… purposely placed there, for someone to find.”

“That’s horrible,” I said. “I can’t even imagine…”

“Well, it gets worse,” Miranda replied, crossing her arms. “A week later, we found Emily’s necklace. *In the Ranger station.* We changed all the locks, of course, and we had the police out here several times. They didn't find anything.”

A chill ran down my spine. I glanced back towards the window—but it was now too dark to see across the parking lot. I stood up and pulled the old curtains over the window, then returned to my seat.

“Clearly this whole thing is a game to him,” Jackie said. “He enjoys seeing us afraid. I mean, if he had access to the Ranger station at one point, he could have easily snuck up behind one of us and killed us. But that's not what he wanted. He wanted to scare us. Watch us squirm. Play with us like a cat plays with a mouse it’s going to eat.”

“But the police are looking for him, right? Do they have any leads?” I asked.

“The police…” Miranda shook her head. “Well, they’re useless, basically. I mean they’re investigating, they’ve ruled out some guys, but they haven’t actually nailed down anyone. No suspects. At least, none that they’ve told us about. They keep telling us they’re going to find him, but they never do.”

“That’s because it isn’t a *him,”* David interrupted.

Miranda rolled her eyes. “Oh, come on, not this again.”

“There are a few things we've seen with the case… that don't make sense with what a human would do. A few weeks ago, I saw this silhouette, several hundred yards through the trees. I started chasing it, but it moved too fast. Even Usain Bolt couldn't run that fast.”

“Davis—”

“And there's also the howling. We hear it only at night, around midnight. It sounds like this horrible blend between a woman screaming and a dog howling.”

“That’s a Northern Screech Owl, you idiot,” Miranda snapped at him.

“And it disrupts the electromagnetic field. If it’s anywhere in range, your cell phone will cut out. That’s why I make sure to always have a compass on me, and not rely on GPS.”

“Wait…” I glanced from Miranda to Davis. “You gave me a compass.”

“I don’t believe him,” she said, shaking her head. “I just think a compass is more reliable than a phone.”

But she sounded slightly uncertain when she said it. Like she didn’t believe him… but also wasn’t ruling out the possibility that there was some cryptid running wild in the woods.

“Look.” Davis stood up and approached me, pulling out his phone. He flicked his fingers over the screen and then handed it to me. “Look at that photo,” he said. “You can't tell me there's something seriously fucked up going on here.”

I looked down at the screen.

It was a grainy photo of the forest, zoomed in as far as the camera could go. Between two birch trees, there was the sliver of a dark shape. It was incredibly tall—maybe about 8 or 9 feet. The problem was, because the resolution was so terrible, and it was mostly obscured by the trees, you really couldn’t tell what it was. It could be anything from a tree trunk to some random debris to a weird compression artifact.

“Uh, cool photo,” I told him.

“I heard the howling noise *at the same time,”* he replied. “Echoing through the forest.”

“I thought you only heard the howling at night,” Miranda snapped at him.

*“Usually* at night. Jackie’s heard it in the day.”

Jackie shrank away, looking ashamed.

“Well… I did see something out there,” I told Davis. “It wasn’t super tall, though. It looked like a person, moving through the brush. Wearing a light-colored shirt.”

“That's the whole point,” Davis replied. “We’re dealing with a skinwalker. This is its true form, in the photo. It can change shape to imitate people. So what you saw was probably the skinwalker in the shape of someone else.”

Okay. Now I could see why Miranda was so dismissive of Davis.

He didn’t think there was just something unexplainable in the woods. He thought it was specifically a shapeshifting skinwalker, whose mere presence disrupted the electromagnetic fields around us. Hiding out in this tiny state park in the middle of nowhere. I wouldn't be surprised if the next words out of his mouth were something like, *I saw him getting donuts at the Latham Bagel Shop.*

We sat there in awkward silence. I tried to think of something that wouldn't totally offend Davis, but also not egg him on. The last thing I needed was for everyone at this job to think I was some cryptid-believing kook like he was.

“Can you go get Donny?” Miranda asked, turning towards me. “It’s been like 20 minutes.”

“Uh, I guess so,” I said, getting up.

But as soon as I stepped out of the front room, I heard Miranda, Jackie, and Davis talking in hushed whispers. I lingered just outside the doorway for a moment—and caught snatches of their conversation. *“Can’t tell him that.” “Do you really think?”* I strained my ears—

“Hurry up, Mark!”

Reluctantly I walked down the hallway. Up the stairs to the small attic-level, where the single bedroom and bathroom lay. “Donny?”

No answer.

I walked right up to the bathroom door: “Donny, are you just playing on your phone?”

Silence.

An uneasy feeling settled in my stomach. I raised my fist and knocked on the door.

It creaked open under my fist.

My heart plummeted when I saw the lights were out. “Donny?” I called, my voice shaking. “You here?” My fingers fumbled along the wall, looking for the light switch—

*Click.*

I froze.

Donny lay on the floor. His shirt was drenched in blood, spilling out onto the tiles, seeping into the crevices. His eyes were closed.

I don’t remember screaming. But I must have, because soon Miranda, Jackie, and Davis were stomping up the stairs. They ran in behind me.

The world turned into a blur of color and noise as they rushed to help him. But I just stood there, frozen, my legs shaking underneath me.

Because on the counter was Heather’s purple hat.
