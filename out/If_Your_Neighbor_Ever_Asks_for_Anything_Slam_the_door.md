Turning around, I greeted my girlfriend, Ellie, as she walked through the door, her coat draped over her arm.  
“Hey, babe. What are you making? It smells great,” she said, setting her bag down on the counter.

“Hi. Welcome home,” I replied, stirring the sauce on the stove. “I’m making rigatoni alla vodka.”

Ellie raised an eyebrow, smirking. “Fancy. Is this a special occasion, or did you just get tired of pizza rolls?”

I chuckled. “Figured I’d remind you why you keep me around. Want a taste?”

I grabbed a spoon, dipped it into the sauce, and held it out. She leaned forward, sampling it with a small bite. Her eyes lit up, nodding in approval.

“Mm, not bad. You might be onto something here.”

“Not bad?” I teased. “That’s high praise from someone who considers cereal a gourmet dinner.”

Ellie laughed, shaking her head. “Hey, cereal’s timeless. Don’t knock it.”

We settled into an easy rhythm, the kind that only comes after years together. I was just reaching back to turn off the oven when a knock at the door interrupted the moment.

Three soft raps.

Ellie and I froze. No one ever knocked this late.

Then it came again, louder.  
KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.

I exchanged a wary glance with Ellie. My hand instinctively went to the drawer where I kept the utility knife. She stepped closer, her voice barely above a whisper. “Who would be here this late?”

“I don’t know,” I replied, my pulse quickening.

Creeping to the door, I peered through the peephole. My stomach twisted. Standing on the other side was our neighbor, Mr. Howland. His wild eyes darted nervously down the hallway, and he wrung his hands as though wringing out his own unease.

I turned to Ellie, my voice low. “It’s Mr. Howland. He looks...off.”

Ellie moved closer, craning her neck. “Should we open it?”

I hesitated before nodding, and we unlocked the door.

We opened it just a crack. Mr. Howland’s frantic eyes locked onto mine, his appearance startling, his shirt was rumpled and untucked, his hair wild, and his face glistening with sweat.

“Dr. Parker, please,” he blurted out, his voice hoarse. “I know you’re a doctor. I need some painkillers. I know you have some.”

I blinked, caught off guard. “Mr. Howland, I can’t just give you medication. It’s not that simple. It could cost me my license.”

His face crumpled, desperation carving deep lines into his features. “Please, I’m begging you. I lost my job, my insurance...I can’t afford to see a doctor, but I need to get through the week. Just two pills. I promise, I’ll make it right.”

Ellie’s worried glance pressed against my own hesitation.

“Give us a moment,” I said, closing the door halfway.

In the kitchen, I ran a hand through my hair, pacing. “What do I do? If I give him anything and something happens...”

Ellie frowned. “I don’t know. He seems desperate, but you could get in serious trouble. Maybe we could help him find a clinic?”

I sighed, shaking my head. “He looks like he’s barely hanging on.”

After a tense moment of internal debate, I opened a locked drawer and retrieved two oxycodone pills from the emergency supply I kept for field emergencies.

“This is a bad idea,” Ellie muttered.

Back at the door, I handed Mr. Howland the pills. “Here. But this is it. Don’t ask me again.”

His trembling hand snatched them, relief flooding his eyes. “Thank you, Dr. Parker. Thank you. I owe you one.”

He turned and hurried down the hallway without another word.

That night, sleep wouldn’t come. Guilt churned in my stomach, replaying the encounter in a loop. Was he really in pain, or had I just made a terrible mistake?

The next morning, Ellie woke me, her excitement lighting up the room. She thrust a plastic stick into my face, her grin wide.

“Look! It’s positive. I’m pregnant!”

Her words jolted me awake. “Ellie, are you serious? This is…” I pulled her into my arms, my mind spinning. “We’re going to be parents?”

She laughed, nodding. “You’re going to be a dad.”

Joy washed over me, a moment of hope I clung to like a lifeline. But by evening, the unease crept back in, gnawing at the edges of my mind.

But by evening, the joy had turned to unease. As the sun dipped below the horizon, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. I kept telling myself it was just nerves, Ellie’s news was monumental, after all, but that nagging sensation in my gut wouldn’t let up.

Ellie noticed my discomfort as we sat on the couch, her head resting on my shoulder. "You’ve been quiet," she said softly. "Are you okay?"

I forced a smile, stroking her hair. "Yeah, just...processing everything. It’s a lot to take in."

She nodded, understanding, but I could tell she didn’t fully believe me. Neither did I.

At around 9 p.m., as Ellie got ready for bed, I found myself staring at the front door. My thoughts drifted to Mr. Howland. Had I done the right thing? What if he needed more help than I realized? What if I’d just made things worse?

That’s when the sound came. A soft scrape. I froze. It was faint, but unmistakable, something moving just outside the apartment. My heart began to race.

“Ellie?” I called out, my voice barely above a whisper.

She poked her head out from the bathroom, toothbrush in hand. “What’s up?”

“Shh,” I said, holding up a hand.

Another sound followed, a faint tap, tap, tap. It wasn’t the door this time. It was the window.

Ellie’s eyes widened. She quickly stepped into the living room. “What is that?”

I motioned for her to stay back as I moved toward the window. We were on the fourth floor. No one could be tapping on the glass, right? But as I approached, I saw it: a dark smudge on the window, just above eye level. It looked like a handprint, long, thin fingers splayed across the glass.

“What the hell?” I whispered.

Ellie came up behind me, clutching my arm. “Is someone out there?”

I shook my head. “I don’t know.”

The air in the room felt heavy, the kind of weight that makes your skin crawl. I grabbed my phone and turned on the flashlight, shining it toward the glass. Nothing. The smudge was still there, but no one was outside. I checked the lock on the window, making sure it was secure.

“Probably just condensation or something,” I said, trying to reassure both of us.

Ellie didn’t look convinced, but she nodded. “Yeah. Okay.”

We went to bed, but sleep didn’t come easily. I kept the utility knife on the nightstand, just in case.

At some point in the night, I woke to the sound of whispering. It wasn’t Ellie. She was fast asleep beside me. The whispers were faint, like a distant conversation just on the edge of hearing. I strained to make out the words, but they were garbled, nonsensical. I sat up in bed, my heart pounding. The sound seemed to be coming from the living room.

Gripping the knife, I crept out of bed and into the hallway. The apartment was dark, but the whispers grew louder as I approached the living room.

“Hello?” I called out, my voice shaking.

The whispers stopped. The silence that followed was suffocating. I felt like the air had been sucked out of the room. And then I saw it. In the faint light coming through the window, I saw Mr. Howland standing in the corner of the living room. But it wasn’t the same man I had helped earlier. His face was twisted in agony, his eyes wide and bulging with pain.

He was peeling off his skin.

It wasn’t like he was just pulling it away in strips. It was as if his flesh was coming off in layers, revealing a sickly, pale layer beneath. His fingers, bloody and shaking, worked methodically at the edges of his face, pulling the skin from his cheeks and neck, his hands stained with crimson. I could see the muscle and tissue underneath, raw and exposed.

My breath caught in my throat. I couldn’t move.

His head tilted slowly to one side, his bloodshot eyes locking onto mine as if he could see me through the darkness. His mouth moved, but no sound came out, just the slithering wet noise of skin being pulled away from flesh.

Then, he spoke, but it wasn’t his voice. It was a rasping, garbled sound that made my skin crawl, like something inside him was trying to escape.

“Help me...” The words were barely audible, but they chilled me to the core.

The figure took a single step forward, and that was enough to snap me out of my paralysis. I stumbled back, nearly dropping the knife.

“Get out!” I shouted, my voice cracking.

Ellie burst into the room, flipping on the light.

“What’s going on?” she asked, but when the light flooded the room, Mr. Howland was gone. The corner was empty, and the only sound was Ellie’s panicked breathing.

“What happened?” she asked, clutching my arm.

I didn’t know how to answer.
