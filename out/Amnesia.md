 

Just like every other day, I logged onto my computer first thing in the morning.  I found an email waiting for me from my friend Tommy. He wanted me to check out a video he found on a web forum. It was a video of a small streamer who ended up losing his mind over the course of about five hours. He told me the cause was a video.

**Amnesia.MP4**

*Curiosity killed the cat I suppose.*

I clicked the video. It was nothing but gritty darkness accompanied by a strange low humming sound.

Then I saw the face.

It was almost completely covered by the almost pitch-black video but it was there. The eyes are what gave it away. Giant saucers on the face of a man who had a crazed look. I only watched through it once before I had to click off. It sent chills down my spine.

Tommy always had a knack for finding really obscure videos and other media. It was like he was a treasure hunter and things like that were his gold. I’ve never met Tommy in real life, but we became friends through Halo. We will still hop on and game every once in a while, but now we mostly just talk about interesting things we discover on the web.

We are part of a larger group that enjoys posting creepy and unsettling things. Tommy sent me the video first just like he does with everything he finds. We like to run what we find past each other first to make sure it’s creepy enough to post. I also enjoy jotting my two cents down and posting it on other sites like this one. I’m like a reviewer for all things creepy.

Then I started watching the stream. It was a small streamer who only had 12 subscribers. His screen name was Dr. Intreped. *Cool name I suppose.* 

I am going to time-stamp each segment of the five-and-a-half-hour stream. Let’s begin.

**Hour 1**

The stream begins with an opening line, “Hello wanderers, let’s see what kind of things we can uncover from the land of the internet today. I’ve already collected a few stories I want to share. I have a really spooky one to kick off today's stream.” He then tells his audience that while messaging someone in a dark web chat room he received a video link and was told that it would be a good idea to play it for his viewers. 

*Who would trust a random stranger just like that? Well, I guess I really don’t have room to talk, I’ve done that plenty of times.*

He then goes on to play the video. Then for the next fifteen or so minutes him and his six viewers discussed their thoughts on the video. Most thought it was creepy. The main focus though was on the face that was just barely visible. Dr. Intrepid went back through the video and paused it on the man. The more he zoomed the more I realized how insane he looked. His giant eyes were bloodshot and his crazed smile filled with rotting teeth that had black sports covering them. The man was also bald with sores covering his face and head. 

I skipped through the stream until he got off the video. I couldn’t stand to look at that face any longer. He told his viewers he was going to pause the stream to go get a glass of water and some Advil because he was getting a headache. 

*My head’s feeling a little tight. I guess I'll join him.*

What sounded like the music you would hear in an elevator played for about five minutes before he returned to his seat.

“All right! On to the next!”

**Hour 2**

For the next hour, he discusses two more topics. One about a hack that happened over the weekend where the hacker made off with millions. The next story was about a group of hikers who went missing on a trail a year ago and came back alive. *This guy really covers anything I suppose.* He had seven viewers now and they went on discussing back and forth about the two stories. I noticed sometimes Dr. Intrepid would seem to just stare off into space, like he forgot where he was. He would also put his hand on his head around his temples and swirl the palms of his hands around. 

After they finished talking one of his viewers said that he should log back into the chat room on the dark web where he frequents and talk to people.

He agreed.

**Hour 3**

After getting everything set up again he logged into what he claimed was the best chat room ever. He explained that he gets most of his stories from here and that everyone on the site really enjoys finding cool and obscure media.

*I might need to jot this down to check out sometime.*

He spends a good while just chatting with strangers asking them if they had anything of interest to show him. His viewers also chimed in with questions for him to ask the anonymous strangers. This is when I began to notice something strange was happening. One of his viewers gave Dr. Intrepid a question to ask the person he was chatting with. He obliged and then five minutes later the viewer told him to say the exact same question again. Dr. Intrepid asked it again without skipping a beat. Another viewer pointed it out and he just shook it off. 

This kept happening. He would ask a question one of his viewers posed only to repeat the same question five or ten minutes later. The viewer who had pointed out Dr. Intrepid’s mistake first was now joining in on this echo chamber of repeated questioning. This kept on happening for the remainder of the third hour. He was getting some good responses from the people in the chat room. Even though some people he talked to just left after being asked the same question over and over I still got to see some interesting photos and videos.

*I might need to jot this down to check out sometime.*

**Hour 4**

He began the fourth hour still searching for strangers in the chat room. Dr. Intrepid was still exhibiting the same odd behavior. Momentarily dozing off, repeating things he’s already said, and placing his hands on his skull occasionally. Then a new stranger joined the chat room.

“Did you enjoy the video I sent you?”

*Strange,* I thought. This must be the anonymous person who sent the Amnesia.MP4 video to Dr. Intrepid. *How did he join and know immediately who it was?* They talked back and forth for a while about the video. Sometimes repeating the same questions.

“I see the video is taking effect on you. How wonderful.”

Confused by this Dr. Intrepid responds.

“Taking effect on me?”

“Yes, it’s a video I created that makes the viewer forget everything. It took years to create, but it seems I’ve finally done it.”

Freaked out by this he leaves the chat room and backs all the way out to his desktop. His viewers were also freaking out at this point. I’m not gonna lie I was a little unnerved myself as my head was beginning to pound. Well, all except for the one viewer that joined after they watched the video. He typed out a message that made my blood run cold.

“Why did you leave? I was enjoying our fun little chat.”

After what felt like minutes of silence Dr. Intrepid looks at the camera and says, “My name is Dan, I am 25 years old, and my favorite color is blue.”

He then set a repeating ten-minute timer and told his viewers that he was going to prove this guy wrong by stating that sentence every time the alarm sounded. They all said they were going to do the same, except for one of course, he instead said.

“It’s no use, you’re too far in now. This is good feedback though, it will definitely come in handy.”

**Hour 5**

Dan at this point was just trying to ignore the seventh viewer of his stream. He attempted to kick him out but nothing was working, it’s hard to remove someone who didn’t even have a username to click on.

Dan and his viewers went back and forth with questions, ideas, or anything really that came to mind. More and more I noticed Dan look off into space which seemed to last longer as well. His viewers who were normally much more active were now typing less and less.

“My name is Dan, I am 25 years old, and my favorite color is blue.”

Dan was sweating profusely now and was constantly chugging water. His skin was beginning to grow pale. His speech was slurring every so often. It was such a fast change. His viewers were beginning to misspell words in chat and the time between chats was growing greater and greater.

“My name is Dan, I am 25 years old, a-and my favorite color is – blue!” he nearly shouted that last word.

More time passed and Dan just sat looking at his screen. A more accurate depiction would be looking through the screen, his eyes seemed glazed over. The seventh viewer was still in the stream but wasn’t saying a word. Just watching. The alarm Dan set to repeat came to life.

“My name, is Dan, I am – 25 years old, and my favorite color is… umm, green?” 

*Jesus.* He is getting worse so fast now. He got his favorite color wrong this time and it came out more like a question, like he wasn’t sure himself. None of his viewers even corrected him. 

Silence. Alarm.

“My name is – Dan, I am 28, no 25 years old.”

I guess he forgot about the last part.

More silence. Alarm.

“My name is… um, Dan, I-I am twenty…three years old.”

He got his age wrong. I guess he forgot about the last part.

His breathing was becoming raspy. There was no longer a hint of awareness in his eyes, it was like an unfocused camera looking around. His chat was quiet, with no more messages coming in. He just sat there unmoving. The alarm went off.

“My name – name, my name is.. Umm,” tears ran down his face. He sat there quietly mumbling to himself, “What’s my name, wha-what’s my name.”

He’s forgotten his name. *Was he saying anything else along with it?*

When he stopped crying and sat up he didn’t move again. He sat staring at some random point in his room. Breathing every so often, but I could tell there was no rhythm to it. Like he had to force himself to take in a breath.

He stayed like that for a while. Until I saw his eyes dark around erratically, he looked panicked. He reached his hand up and started clenching his throat.

A lone chat appeared, “Forgotten something, Dan?”

*He’s forgotten how to breathe*.

He stayed there struggling for a while until finally, he slumped down in his chair. Dying of asphyxiation in a room full of air, he just couldn’t remember how to take a breath. He sat there for the remainder of the stream slumped over in his chair.

The final chat sent by the seventh viewer, “What a great success, no hard feelings Dan*,*” then his viewer count dropped to six.

I exited the video. I messaged Tommy and told him that this was a great find. The group was surely going to get a kick out of this one. I couldn’t shake this feeling I had deep in my gut though. I waited a few minutes but Tommy didn’t respond which was unusual for him because he was normally always at his computer. 

I went and got some more water because my throat was getting really scratchy. When I came back I had an email from Tommy. All it said was, “What video?” Confused I decided to go look back at the email Tommy sent. *He sent me a video of a guy's stream right?*

There were two linked videos. *I thought there was only one?* One was a stream recording while the other one was…
