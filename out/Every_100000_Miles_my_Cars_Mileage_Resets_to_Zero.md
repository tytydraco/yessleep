I was, rather am, a very spoiled kid, I’m fully aware of that fact. Being the son of a CEO, I had virtually everything I ever wanted handed to me for most of my life. I grew up in a 2 story house on a 3 acre plot of land complete with a pool, gym, and a sprawling yard. I was an only child so my parents treated me better than I deserved, especially given my lack of gratitude. 

My childhood was filled with birthday parties that cost more than most families made in a month. Vacations in luxury resorts, a never-ending supply of the latest technology, you get the idea. I was surrounded by privilege. Blinded by it to the point that it never occurred to me how different life was for others.

This isolation made me insufferable even among my peers at the private school I attended during my teenage years. People would either act as my friends to get something from me or they would openly despise me. But I didn't let it get to me. I didn't try in my classes. I didn't try to make real friends. I didn't have to. The word was mine and I knew it. I would ride my dad's coat tails until I inherited his company, at which point I would have my own advisors to think for me. I had a straight path ahead of me; one of ease, relaxation, and wealth. I truly believe that God is punishing me for the selfish way I've lived my life, the way I've planned it out. 

I got my license when I was 16. To celebrate, my parents got me the car I had been obsessing over for the past few months. A dark blue second generation C2 Corvette produced in 1963- the “Sting Ray.” It had about 110,000 miles on it, but I figured any necessary repairs wouldn’t be an issue for me. A classic car that I knew my friends and, more importantly, my enemies would be jealous of. Ignoring the rest of the piles of presents I had been given that day, I immediately jumped into the car; speeding recklessly through the streets in my vain giddiness. 

That car was my pride and joy, I think I loved it more than I loved most people. And so, time went by. I graduated from high school, getting into a well renowned university in pursuit of a business degree- something that was only possible with the help of some convincing from my parents and their connections. I flunked my way through the first semester, spending more time drinking and partying rather than studying. I took that car everywhere, from my university to my parents' property, which was a state over, and back again. I couldn’t exactly impress women with my dorm, so I painted a picture of myself as a self made tycoon- all a fabrication of course. 

That is to say that I burned through miles fairly quickly. By the time I was 20, the car was almost at 200,000 miles. Still, this didn’t bother me. The Corvette ran like a dream and had never given me any issues. Then came the end of my semester. A bunch of my dorm mates had a ritual of throwing a party after every semester- a huge celebration to kick start summer break. 

I was tasked with picking up beer. As I was driving back, I shut my eyes for a moment. I thought about how lucky I was, how my life would never be difficult, how adversity is something that would never cross my path. Then I heard singing. Multiple voices singing ‘happy birthday’ to me.

When I opened my eyes, I was no longer in my car. I was at my parents house. It was my 16th birthday and I was sitting at a table surrounded by gifts with a massive birthday cake on the table in front of me. Everything was exactly as it had been that day 4 years ago. The same people, the same order of events, everything. And then the time came for them to show me their big surprise; the same blue Corvette. 

I was sure I was dreaming, or that I was hallucinating. But I never woke up. Time went on again, as it had before, and my life played out mostly the same. I made different friends, took different classes, even changed my major to finance. 

This time, I found a girlfriend in college. Her name was Jennifer and she was the only person I ever knew who didn't treat me like a king because of my parents' money. I learned a lot from her, and I like to think she made me better as a person. Still not good, but better than I had been before.

When I was 21, I was going to propose to her. I was driving her to the airport to surprise her with a trip to Italy- she had always wanted to go and I figured it was the perfect opportunity. I looked down at the mileage count. It read 199,984. The airport was 20 miles away. I swallowed, remembering what had happened last time. Still, I told myself I had just had a strange, coma-like dream. It won't happen again. I was just being paranoid and superstitious.

But then the mile marker rolled over to 200,000. Once again, I opened my eyes to the same familiar scene- surrounded by my family at my 16th birthday party. I left the party immediately. I was panicking. I thought maybe I was insane, maybe none of this was real. Maybe I really was in some sort of coma or nightmare. But no such luck. Or rather, if that is the case, I have yet to escape whatever sleep I'm in.

This time, I refused to drive that car. I refused to drive at all. The classic Corvette stood in the garage gathering dust. I walked or cycled whenever I needed to be somewhere. And this worked for a long time. Given the position I had, I was able to be relatively sedentary. 

I graduated college, got a job at my father's company, even convinced Jennifer to marry me, this now being my second attempt. We started a family together, and our daughter was born when I was 31. We named her Emilia, after Jennifer's grandmother. 

One Sunday afternoon, I was cleaning out my garage when I decided to check the old car. Maybe it really all had been a trick of my mind. My heart sank. The mileage read 199,997. I called my parents, maybe they had borrowed it without asking me. But no, this car had been sitting here since I was 16.

I didn't know what to do or what it meant. But the calls of my wife and daughter from the inside put me at ease. Everything was fine, nothing was going to happen. I spent that night with my family, I think it was the happiest I had ever been. 

The next morning, I was cycling to work. It wasn't very far, only about 5 miles away. I'm sure you can guess what came next. I blinked, opening my eyes yet again to my 16th birthday party. 

This same cycle has gone on over and over again. My body, right now, is 23 years old. But in reality, I'm over 90. I'm so tired of this. I've become a recluse, spending most days in my bed or at my desk. 

I don't know how to escape this, and I'm tired of living the same few years only for it all to be ripped away. I have trouble connecting with people, as I can't see them as real anymore. They'll just be reset like everything else. 

I don't know how much more of this I can take. I can't spend eternity like this. I need a way out. Can anyone help me?
