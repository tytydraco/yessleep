It just might end up being a grave mistake.

Something they don’t tell you about dorm life, you’re always running low on something. When your campus is tucked away in a little mountain town that has a town square that rolls up at six, it’s easy to go stir crazy as well.

Lucky for me, there’s a late-night Walmart superstore about half an hour away.

I was cutting it close, ever since COVID these places break down at eleven on the dot. But as I rolled into the nearly abandoned parking lot, I had made it just under the final hour. The building was massive, but really no different than your standard Walmart. I parked my friend's jeep right next to the handicap zone and scanned the lot. It was almost a ghost town-save for a rickety branded van and a beat-up old jalopy lingering in the back. I glanced up at the superstore, those luminescent letters beckoning me like a moth to the flame.

There were a few things I needed: ionized salt being the top of the shopping list. The frigging pervert ghost that lurks on my floor's bathroom has started wandering the halls. I read online that salt keeps out specters, so I've been dumping it underneath the seam of my bedroom door every night. Whole hall has this sharp, acrid odor to it, but I haven't seen that bug eyed phantom leering at me in a while. So, I consider that a win.

I stood at the sliding doors and peered inside. The in-house Starbucks was already closed, crushing my dreams for a late-night pumpkin spice latte. The check-out lanes were all closed, saved one with a dough eyed skinny kid manning the register.

I saw no other customers lingering inside, the only other person was hanging out near the front entrance. He was an older fellow, broad shoulders and a keg for a gut. His head had a few stragglers on it, combed over in a fruitless attempt at a makeshift hairpiece. His cheeks were rosy and full of life, like a wrinkled peach. he wore a blue vest and had a neatly trimmed beard that was as white as pure Colombian marching powder. Just beneath his twitching nose was a moustache; it's ends slightly curled upward in a way that him look like a refined Southern gentleman. An odd look for the Northeast for sure.

The doors glided open for me, a gust of chilled air smacking me in the face as I entered the Walmart. The old man lingering near the shopping carts saw me, his eyes lighting up like a Christmas tree. He waltzed over to me with open arms, like he was going to wrap me up in an ironclad bearhug.

"Welcome to Walmart little lady, if there's anything I can do to make your shopping experience tonight as smooth as molasses just let me know, now." The man bellowed with an outrageous Southern drawl. My eyes flicked to his name tag; a shiny metal plate that simply read "Wellers."

"Awe thanks. I'm good though, I come here a lot, kind of like a second home actually." I said, trying to creep away from the overly friendly greeter. He shook his head, the dangling threads of his combover swaying as he did.

"Naw, I insist. Truth be told Ma'am I'm as bored as a toad sunbathing on a log. Need to keep busy in my old age, keeps the rickets from setting in." he said with a toothy grin.

"Ok. I guess, where do you guys keep the salt?" I asked, fumbling around in my jacket pocket to make sure I remembered my trusty taser.

"Awe Salt!" He boomed, eyes widening so far I thought they would rocket out of his skull. "Can't touch the stuff myself, back in the day I used to slather my meals in salt and butter though. Come on now little missy I'll show you where we keep the good stuff." he motioned me to follow as he trotted off, his feet clicking against the tiled floors.

"ISIAH! Watch the front now you hear." He barked at the bored cashier, who regarded the eccentric geezer with contempt as he passed. I followed suit with pep in my step. Wellers wouldn't be the first creepy old man I followed around on a whim; he probably won't be the last knowing my luck.

The interior of the superstore was as formulaic as they come. To my left was a swath of clothing racks and posters of people beaming with joy wearing them. I wish I looked half as happy as they did wear skinny jeans. To my right was a surplus of bathing products and "self-care" stuff, your deodorants and perfumes. The good stuff was looked behind bars with at least three locks chained to them. Mr. Wellers was talking up a storm as he led me deeper into the store. Probably the highlight of an otherwise boring nightshift.

Soon enough we came to the spice rack aisle, and he presented it like a gameshow host.

"Now you'll find the good stuff tucked away in the back there. Lemme know if you need any help reaching it." he said. I mumbled a thank you and booked it down the aisle. He lingered at the front, looking up and down the vacant store like he was searching for something.

The spice aisle smelled like an Italian bakery, all the assorted chives and herbs mixing together, it smelled heavenly. As I looked for the salt, I heard a slight clutter at the very end. In my peripheral view, I saw a small shaker of crushed red pepper clatter to the ground. I also saw a hunched figure leering at me that quickly jumped out of view when I caught it.

I twirled around, only seeing the shaker roll aimlessly on the cool ground. Behind me Mr. Wellers still lurked, unaware of the unseen creeper. I tiptoed down the aisle, waiting for something to peak around either corner. I could hear it, thick musty respirations like all it could do was wheeze.

"Hello?" I called out. "Is someone there? You dropped your peppers." I tried to coax the watcher out. Finally, a grimy, dirt-stained hand cautiously grabbed the aisle corner. Its fingernails were long and yellow, looked like they hadn't been treated for decades. Its knuckles were cracked and caked with filth, I could see it wearing an ill-fitting fuzzy overcoat. Its arms were gangly, almost malnourished.

"Have you seen my mommy?" It called out in this squeaky voice that sounded shrill and gruff at the same time. He stepped out into the aisle completely and I was taken back by the thing standing before me. he was tall and covered in dust and aged mold. He smelled like an old crypt, dripping with age and mildew. His clothing was tattered and covered in stains of varying color and stench. His midriff was exposed, his shirt about seven sized too small. His belly was pale and gauntly, like it had been hollowed out by hunger. His legs were skinny-fat, runner's legs if they were tainted by starvation and desperation. On his feet were a pair of *Rick and Morty* slippers, worn out from excessive overuse.

The strangest thing about the sickly stranger before me was his head. It was strictly vulpine in nature, matted fur clinging to his hide like he had mange. He had two twitchy ears, and his fur was a dirty vermilion hue. His eyes were hollow and porcelain like a doll, yet his mouth watered as he licked his chapped fox lips. His nose was dry and peeling.

The shy fox man before me took a timid step forward. I wasn't all that shocked by the mutant before me, more so concerned by his ghastly frame.

"Have you seen my mommy, I lost her and I'm all alone." He asked again, his voice reminiscent of a scared little boy.

"I'm sorry I haven't seen her. What's your name." I whispered softly, trying to put the frightened being at ease. He cocked his head at me, like no one had ever asked him that before.

"My name is. . . John." He finally said. "What's yours?" He asked.

"I'm Abi Mae." I smiled at him. I reached out my hand; the fox boy eyed it nervously. "Why don't you come with me, we can ask Mr. Wellers for help." I offered. John flinched at Wellers' name, who I then heard from behind yell from the front.

"Didn't get lost or nutting now didya?" he hollered.

"Yeah, I'm fine, thanks. But there's a-" I turned back to face John, but he had vanished. I could hear frantic scampering further down the walkways. Frustrated, I grabbed some salt and tossed it in a basket. Mr. Wellers eyed me with concern as I stomped back towards him. He looked past me, a nervous tweak in his pale blue eyes.

"You didn't happen to uh-see something back there did you miss?" he asked all nonchalant. I shrugged my shoulders and pointed down the way, seeing no real reason to lie to the guy.

"Yeah, there was this weird teen in a fox mask or something, he looked homeless. I think he's still wandering around if you report it or something, help him find his way." Wellers face went ghostly pale at the mention of John and pushed passed me as he examined the aisle. Seeing no trace of the fox-man he called out to the empty.

"JOHN, you go back to the walls now. There's nothing for you out here, just leave it alone. You hear me boy?!" he screamed at nothing. he was met with a robust silence. He turned to me, beet red from screaming.

"I think it's best if I accompany you for the rest of your shopping, miss." he told me with a grave tone in his voice.

"Why? He looks like a weirdo, but he seems harmless." Which even I thought sounded ridiculous as soon as it left my mouth. I'm getting too used to my life becoming a freakshow. Wellers shook his head sadly, like he had heard that excuse before.

"It's how he gets you, oh sure he seems like a lost little boy, but that dog can hunt."

"He's a fox." I corrected.

"Whatever lil miss, I'm telling you I've been around the bend more times you can shake a switch at, that boy ain't right. He feeds off the ignorance of strangers." he warned. I sighed and checked my shopping list, just needed some snacks and a couple bad movies.

"Fine. Lead the way then." I said dryly. The rest of my shopping spree was closely guarded by Mr. Wellers. he led me aisle to aisle, always checking to see if John was lying in wait in one of them. I didn't see the fox boy I could hear him scuttling above like a roach. Dust fell gently to the floor whenever he moved. Weller's kept shooting glares to the ceiling and muttering to himself. I'll admit the ceiling stalking was getting to me a bit, a shiver ran down my spine every time I heard movement up there.

Wellers was true to his word, and led me around till my basket was full of snacks and goodies for the month. Even managed to snag a jar of extra chunky peanut butter for my buddy Tammy. After getting some motor oil for my roommate Barb, all I had left was to browse the movie dept.

It was slim pickings in the electronic section. Everything's all digital now, which breaks my heart because I love buying cheesy movies and vegging out in front of the TV and just rotting the ever-loving hell out of my brain. But there was practically nothing on the shelves, just consoles trapped behind lock and key. So, I was forced to sift through the bargain bin, disgusted by the amount of trashy realty shows there were.

Wellers was standing around anxiously, tapping his hefty foot on the ground.

"So-" I said, tossing a used copy of *Rock Of Love* season one aside, "-what's the deal with John anyway?" I asked him. "Is he a man, a fox, some twisted hybrid? What's his lore?" Wellers gave me a queer look as he cleared his throat.

"You're taking a lot of this in stride miss. Commendable, if not odd. I don't rightly know exactly what John is." He admitted. "But I do know this, he was human once. Story goes back a few years, during them bogus lockdowns. We were new to shutting down early, it was hectic beating that training into the new hires. So certain duties got eh, ignored. Like mopping the bathrooms at the end of your shift-and making sure the story was empty 'fore we locked them doors." He said ominously.

"Cops came a few hours after we had closed, wailing junkie of a mutha in tow. Said she had left her little boy to wander while she did some "shopping" behind the store. I had to come in, was the only night shift worker they could reach. We searched high and low for little John. Didn't find a trace of him. They dragged the mother away screaming and chalked his disappearance up to a drug-related kidnapping." He grimaced.

"Jesus." I muttered, still digging into the pile of movies.

"Soon after things started to go missing in our inventory. A few pile of cloths here, some chocolate milk there. We never did find the culprit, but rumors circulated among the workers. Then the sightings came, of an almost skeletal looking fox-kid galloping up and down the store on all fours. His time stashed away seemed to-warp the poor boy. It drove him feral. Something started tearing into the meat freezer, and we knew he had developed a taste."

"Why didn't you call the cops, call anyone?" I said, barely looking up as he scoffed.

"Come on now, who'd believe such an outlandish thing. Hell, I barely believed it myself, till I saw him gnawing on Chad." he remarked. I shuddered at the thought, and a sealed copy of "*The Mean One*." caught my eye. I grabbed the DVD and was ready to leave when we heard a thunderous crash from down the way. It was coming from the toy section; I could see dozens of action figures clatters to the ground as something tore the aisle open. Wellers turned to me and urged me to stay put while he investigated.

He didn't have to tell me twice, so I stayed there holding my basket in one hand, and my little taser in the other. I looked around the abandoned aisle. Tucked away next to the loading bay was a wall of toys and pop culture memorabilia. I skipped over there, taking a quick glance at the slop, they were selling. Next to me were the loading bay doors. If you were to take a peek through the barely translucent windows you'd see nothing but pitch black.

The grey double doors then began to slowly creep open, making an audible creek as they did. I slowly backed away, rising my taser in hand. The inky black casted itself onto the ground. The doors clunked to the wall and stayed there.

"Hey Abi. Come here, I found my mommy." John's voice called out. His voice was still childlike in demeanor, but there was an undertone of malice to it.

"I'm good John. Glad ya found her though." I called back, trying to hide the fear dripping from my voice. John was silent in response, and I heard something clatter in the dark, like nails clicking against stone.

"Awe come on Abi. Don't you want to meet my mom?" The voice whined, closer now to the wide-open double doors.

"Not really." I answered earnestly. The thing in the dark grumbled in frustration, creeping closer to the light. It peeked its head out, maw first. I got a good look at his inflamed gums, a stinging crimson with curled, lemon coated teeth. Drool glistened in the light and dripped to the floor, a rabid puddle of hunger. His dry nose twitched, his unkempt whiskers swaying as they did.

He was on all fours, steading himself on four limbs. His back was stretched upward, like he had a massive hump. I could see the nubs of his spine press against the skin has he lurched forward. He eyed me with beady coal black eyes, a deep wheeze escaping his maw.

"Come here Abi. Come meet my Mommy." He leered, slowly approaching me. I knew it was coming, so right when he leapt at me, I jabbed my taser right into his neck. he yipped in pain as thousands of volts jolted though his system. He grabbed my arm and twisted; I winced back and dropped my faithful companion. It cluttered to the floor, John had barley been stunned by it. The failed assault had given me just a few seconds to turn heel and bolt.

John gave chase, nipping at my feet as he galloped after me on all floors. I skittered on the polished limonin floors, desperately trying to escape this cannibalistic fiend. I turned a corner into the appliance section and grabbed the nearest display blender. I turned and tossed it at the crazed fox men. It slammed into his head with a thud, stumbling him slightly but he kept his pursuit. The chase continued as I tried everything to lose him. He was relentless.

I ended up corned near the customer service desk. So close, yet so far to freedom. I had taken a wrong turn into a locked door, and before I knew it the fox man was on me. I braced myself for the end but right before he could strike the killing blow I saw something long and wooden slam onto his head.

Mr. Wellers had come back. He was wielding a pure oak baseball bat; I looked on in awe as he brought it back down on John's head. Every blow made a satisfying *whump* as he battered the fox man. John whimpered as he endured hit after hit.

"Come on now Johhny boy, take your blasted medicine. Mr. Wellers' orders now." he roared as he beat the creature into submission. I ran out of the corner, stunned at the heroic display. John was clutching his head, defending himself from the rapid blows. Wellers was starting to get a tad winded, wheezing like he had popped a lung. John took note and rushed him, staggering Mr. Wellers with a swipe. He lunged at him with his mighty jaws, Wellers shielded himself with the bat. John latched onto the bat, grasping both ends with his hands, foaming at the mouth as he tried to wrestle the bat out of Wellers' arms.

The pair was locked in mortal combat, each one struggling to gain the upper hand. I caught Wellers attention as I stood there like a dope.

"What-are ya doing standing around for?!" he grunted at me. "Get out of here while ya still can, save ya self miss." It took me a second to collect my senses, but I nodded and ran off, the last thing I heard was John snapping his jaws, and Mr. Wellers shouting, "Have a nice night now, and thank ya for shopping at Walmart." As the two collapsed onto each other, grunts and cries of pain giving way to whimpering silence.

I was out of breath from sprinting and almost out the door when the sausage lipped cashier stopped me.

"Hey, you need to pay for that." I gave him a death glare and threw a few crumpled bills at him as I ran out the door. I heard the sliding glass click behind me, the outside lights quickly shutting down. I got to the safety of the jeep and didn't stop hyperventilating for a good fifteen minutes. After I calmed down, I looked out the window, seeing an old man limping away from the shuttered doors. He saw me idling and gave me a little wave as he limped on home to greet another day.

I haven't heard anything about John the twisted fox man since. I've been back to that Walmart a few times now, but always during the day. Still though, sometimes I feel like I'm being watched by beady eyes from above. So, if you're doing a little late-night shopping, I suggest you stay away from the superstore.

Lest you wind up in the fox den.
