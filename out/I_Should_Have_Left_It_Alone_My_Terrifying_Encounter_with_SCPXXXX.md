I had always been a little wary of the small, plastic figurine that sat on a shelf in the Foundation's containment chamber. It was a figurine, but there was just something off about it. Maybe it was the way it seemed to grin at me every time I walked past, or the way it seemed to almost vibrate with malevolence.

I was the one who drew the short straw and had to handle the object for testing. At first, everything seemed fine. But then, the nightmares started. Every night, the figure would appear in my dreams, creeping closer and closer until it was right in my face, grinning maniacally. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched, and I started seeing the figure out of the corners of my eyes when I was wide awake.

I couldn't take it anymore. I knew I had to destroy the object, no matter the cost. So, one night, I broke into the containment chamber and grabbed the figurine. I could feel it pulsing in my hand, almost like it was alive. I ran, laughing maniacally as I disappeared into the night.

I know I shouldn't have taken the object, but I couldn't stand the constant hallucinations and feeling of being watched. I don't know what will happen now, but I can't shake the feeling that I've unleashed something terrible upon the world.

As I run through the dark, deserted streets, I can feel the figurine throbbing in my pocket. It's like it's calling to me, urging me to keep running. I can feel its malevolent presence in my mind, trying to take control.

I know I have to get rid of the object, but I'm not sure how. I can't just throw it away - it would be found and then the Foundation would come after me. I can't let that happen.

I start to feel like I'm being followed, and I turn around to see the figure from my nightmares standing a few feet behind me, grinning maniacally. I can hear its voice in my head, telling me to give it the figurine.

I can't let that happen. I'll have to find a way to destroy the object, even if it means sacrificing myself in the process. I can't let this malevolent presence take control of me. I'll do whatever it takes to stop it.

I spend the next few days running and hiding, trying to figure out a way to destroy the figurine. I can feel it getting stronger every day, its malevolent presence growing in my mind. It's like it's feeding off of my fear and desperation.

I know I can't keep running forever. I have to face this thing head on and find a way to destroy it. I start to research ways to get rid of malevolent objects like this, but everything I find seems like a long shot.

Finally, I come across an old folktale about a cursed object that was sealed inside a lead box and thrown into the depths of the ocean. It's a risky move, but I figure it's my best shot.

I gather up all the supplies I need and head down to the beach. It's a cold, stormy night and the waves are crashing against the shore. I build a small bonfire to keep warm and start to construct the lead box.

As I'm working, I can feel the figurine pulsing in my pocket, almost like it knows what I'm planning. I can hear its voice in my head, trying to persuade me to keep it. It's getting harder and harder to resist its influence.
