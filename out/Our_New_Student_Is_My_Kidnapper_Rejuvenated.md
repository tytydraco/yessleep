Nobody believes me, although I've never lied about anything. This is worse than being taken from my home by Darmem Stonewell. Yes, he is the same as the new boy in our class, Darren Rockwell. He is a liar and a kidnapper - and a warlock.

I was Lamb, and I lived in terror, in darkness, in hunger. I thought he was going to kill me, but instead, his plans were so much more terrible. I now live in a nightmare, although I have returned to my family and to school.

That is why I do not want to go to Mrs. Peachtree's class today. That is why I do not want to go to school. Darren sits behind me, and I can hear him whispering: "I am watching you, Lucy. You are my little Lamb, and you are mine. You are always mine, and nobody can take you from me."

His power over me is somehow incomplete, because I can see who he is. I know he controls everyone around me, because my teacher and my parents and my friends think he is a perfect little boy, and force me to sit with him whenever and wherever he wants me to sit. They only see a kid who shares his lunch and his smile and is so polite and kind.

He is such a liar, so fake. I know he is evil and I know he is really Darmem Stonewell, Dr. Germaine and also Dane Radcliff. He is all those people, somehow. I would know best how he does it, how he becomes young again, and lives another life, and can disguise himself to be both a student, a soccer coach and a psychiatrist.

They think I am traumatized and they medicate me. It only makes my head more clear, it only eradicates my emotions and let's me tell my story. I have a dictionary and a friend, in Domo Aria Gato Sans, my cat. A side effect of my medication lets me write like a grown-up, late at night, as long as I keep eating sugar. My head is so lucid, and my thumbs quick on the page to find the words. I am not alone, my cat sits with me, and when I cannot express myself, I can hear his thoughts, like he sounds like Morgan Freeman, and I know how to express myself when he says what to say.

We'll just call my cat Dags for short, since that is one of his three names. His other name is a secret name, and that is known only to me and to him. That way Darmem Stonewell cannot cast a spell on my cat. He needs your name to use his witchcraft on you, it is part of the spell.

My father signed me up for soccer and Dane Radcliff was our coach. He watched me with the focused gaze of a predator, and I felt his eyes all over my body while I exercised. I knew something was wrong, but I couldn't explain what it was. It was just this dirty and uncomfortable sensation. Like someone is watching you.

It wasn't until winter, when soccer ended, that my mom, a soccer mom, finally agreed with me that our coach was weird. That's all she said, that he was weird. It took her too long, and it was too little, but for just one moment, I felt safe, like she would listen to me.

I'd had premonitions about what his plans were for me, and I told her I needed protection. She laughed and said that our security system at home was sufficient. So, her home was safe from burglary, but I didn't see how that was going to keep me safe - when I kept seeing him outside, watching me.

I'd pull back my curtains, half asleep. I'd wake up, answering to his voice, commanding me. There he was, outside, looking at me. He didn't need to come in. I tried to say he was stalking me, but there was no evidence, he was never seen by anyone else. I'd wake up my parents and after enough false alarms, they stopped believing me.

That is when he took me from them.

I woke up one night and he was in our house. He was holding a strange candelabra with sparking green light dripping from the fleshy wax. It smelled of the grave, an earthy and fetid smell. There was this nascent emotion in me, where I could only stare, dreamlike, entranced. His maliferous grin was one of sadistic victory.

He gestured and I stood in my pajamas. My cat was hiding, unable to protect me. My parents lay scattered where they had responded to his intrusion, falling to the floor as he waved his magic candle at them. It cast no shadows, or it cast a shadow, rather than light, this eerie and weird glow. The smell of it was due to its composition of a severed hand, the fingertips burning with the flames of the grave, and its power even worked on the neighborhood security who responded to the alarum-call, only to fall asleep amid the sprinklers of our lawn.

And then he touched me for the first time, and pain shot through my body. He roughly handled me into his car, into the backseat. He buckled my waist, and lay me down back there, telling me to sleep. Then I slept, and when I was awake again, I was in a bedroom, with one of my hands wrapped in tight cushioning and handcuffed to the iron bedframe. He'd undressed me and changed me into a diaper and nightgown.

Darmem entered the room and looked at me with satisfaction.

"Lamb, you are. Lucy waits. You will obey me. This is a phial, and you will choose to imbibe it, and in thirteen days and nights you will consist the sacrifice. One death brings new life. I am grateful to have found a pure maiden, who has never told a lie. You are exceptionally rare these days. Some men think that all women lie, but I know better. Bless you and keep you in His grace, my dear, and you shall be cleansed."

"I lie all the time." I tried to tell a lie, hoping it would ruin his spell. I was unable to speak, my words went into a silence and he smiled, his trickery absolute.

"In my home, you will obey my rules. You will not speak - you cannot lie." Darmem Stonewell informed me. He made a gesture and an old book appeared in his hand. The title was *Calendoer*, and it was someone's diary. Even a wise and ancient warlock needed a guide. He read something from it and then closed the book again, and it vanished into his wizardly robes.

"I recognize you. You're my soccer coach." I tried to say. He nodded, as though he could read my mind.

"You know me, but it won't give you power over me. Nobody else has ever recognized me. It means nothing, to be recognized." He shrugged, but I sensed he had a doubt. He wasn't sure how I knew he was the same person. Perhaps it was my purity, perhaps I was too pure.

"Liars beget liars. I don't even lie to myself." I claimed. This seemed to bother him, as though he could still hear me, although I was muted. He shrugged and left me there.

For nearly two weeks he kept me his prisoner, attached to the bed. He changed my diaper and he put a leash and collar on me and took me to an old iron bath and washed me in salts and oils, cleansing me. He cast spells that sounded like prayers over me, and I was subdued. I couldn't resist him, I felt like I had to do what he wanted.

Every day he seemed to wither and grow weaker, until the thirteenth sunrise, and sunset, the final day of my terrifying ordeal. I was truly frightened, as I believed he was going to sacrifice me. I thought the wavy knife he kept, his athame, was meant to slaughter me in the chamber he had prepared in his basement.

I shook with fear, completely under his power, but filled with dread. I wore a white dress, and he showed me to myself in a mirror ringed in black wood, carved and embedded with white silver. I looked different, angelic, and for a moment I admired my reflection. I did look very beautiful. On my head he placed a crown made of braided daisies which he had carefully woven.

"This will protect you, and nothing in that chamber will be able to claim you. You must remain pure, or my work will be undone. You must not utter, you must not falter, and your innocence must be guarded. Without your surgery, I might not be restored." He spoke strangely, almost protectively about me. I was still afraid, and I still thought he was going to kill me.

No, his plans were far more terrifying, for he planned to leave me alive - and in a kind of Hell, a nightmare, a prisoner of his terror forever. So much worse than death, for death would have set me free of his power over me. Death would be the end, but it just goes on and on.

I cannot recall what happened in that chamber, but my raven hair grew brittle and white, at what I saw. Demons danced in the shadows, summoned to his resurrection. It was a cruel ritual, and I was the priestess of the abomination. I became his executioner and his midwife, all with the knife and the way. I knew the way, it was his way, and I moved to the rhythm, merely a component of his spell.

"It is love that binds us. My teacher wrote that I would recognize her for her honesty. He said nothing about she who would recognize me. I must be under your power, for the final day of this life, and you will bring me into the next. Our fate is now intertwined. I must belong to you, or else you do not belong to me. Love is a chain, fate, and the place where our souls touch. That is what you must choose to do. If your will is violated, I cannot come forth. Leave me not in the darkness. Recognize me, and know my name, here in this darkness." He said as he sipped the phial.

He handed it to me and I drank the rest, unsure if I chose to do so or not.

Then it was he who lay upon the altar. "I am ready." He breathed, trembling.

I lifted the knife and somehow there was no blood, as I opened him up. Instead, the darkened chamber filled with light. Then there was a void beyond. It was in front of me, and all around me, and within me. The light coming out of him was in me, and fading. I felt its pain and its terror, slipping into the darkness beyond.

Despite what he had done to me, I felt sorry for him, seeing where he was going. I pitied his fading light, as it descended. It clung to me, like a newborn, helpless. I watched as he began to fall away from me, and I saw how he was part of me, and I a part of him. It pained me to know that if I did nothing, he would be lost forever in that eternal shadow, and he would cease to be.

Although I was shaking with fear, and although I have only a vague memory of how and why I did what I did, I reached out, with my mind, my heart, my soul. Whatever part of me reached for him, it was my own will. In that moment his spell over me was broken and I was free. I could have let him descend into that abyss, I could have let him go. Something in me did not wish that, it felt evil to let him go there, like what was beyond, those hungry dancing demons who had celebrated before his fall, like I would be feeding him to them.

It felt wrong, like casting a baby into the flames.

For thirteen days he had eaten nothing, only drinking water. His body was purified.

For thirteen nights he had slept in wrappings so that he could not move, and only at the light of dawn did these bindings fall away. His heart was purified.

For thirteen baths, he had cleansed me in a sacred pool, and made me whole, so that I could not hate him. His soul was purified.

He had explained this to me, and in my fear of him I had not understood. I reached for him, with my willpower, with my love - like a mother's love. I pulled his soul from the shadow, and set it neatly where his body lay restored, youthful, a heart cleansed, beating yet again. There I left him, taking off the flowery crown as I climbed the stairs.

I unlocked the front door and went outside, finding the warm sun on my face, my tears of relief only a moment of freedom. I didn't know that the horror of my world had only just begun. He would never let me go, and I had made him powerful again, all his charm and abilities restored to full.

He lets nothing go. I would tell foul lies, I would speak curses, but I cannot. I am the opposite of him, and I am in fear of becoming his entirely. As long as I remain unlike him, as long as I am the truth, he cannot get any closer, cannot follow me into the next life.

For I know the way, and I shall live again.
