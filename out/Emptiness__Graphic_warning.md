I used to be happy. I used to be kind. I used to be innocent.

For a while now, i have been having a hard time in school. I'm always alone. Nobody seems to care about me. But a few months back, i have found one friend who does appreciate me. We did a school project together and since then, we connected. His name is Nathan and we hung out together often. He does have other friends, but i don't like them. I don't think they like me either. But that's okay, i'm happy with what i have.

Nathan was kind to me. But i know i'm not one of his closest friends. It's fine, i understand. But he is kind of ghosting me. I won't bother confronting him about it. I don't want to be pushy or force my presence on him. He is joining his other friends more often now. As the weeks went by, we hung out less and less. Up to the point where we don't really speak to eachother anymore. We say 'hi' in the hallway and that's that. I do feel alone again now. Like i had something, but it's gone now.

I used to be happy

My school work is coming along and currently have some very good grades. Maybe it's because i can focus on it so much when i'm alone. One of Nathan's friends, Jon, approached me about it. He came up to me one day and said "Hey, i saw your grade on the list. Good job!" I was kind of surprised Jon spoke to me. I paused a bit, and then replied with a "Thank you". 

We talked for 5 minutes and had a good conversation. It never occurred to me that Jon was actually a good conversationalist. He still wasn't the type of person i like being around with, but i remained positive and friendly towards him. I asked him how Nathan was doing. Jon said he was doing fine, but needed to prioritize. I could understand what Jon meant. I always told Nathan to remain focused on his school work. He wasn't failing, but needed to keep his mind in school.

I thought it was only logical that Nathan stayed in the background for a bit. Trying to stay on track with school. Then Jon continued. "Nathan decided to cut connections with those who had a bad effect on him." I looked at him puzzled. "What do you mean?" I asked Jon. "Look, you're not really the kind of person that should hang out with Nathan." As Jon told me this, i see Nathan walking around the corner. He looked at me and then to Jon. Nathan never said anything to me. He just thanked Jon and they both walked away. I broke on the inside. What a way to treat an old friend.

I used to be kind

Of course i was filled with anger after that. I had all the right to be. I was not going to let sadness take over my mind. Instead it was filled with rage. I was clenching my fists with every thought of Nathan or Jon. I hated them both. Rightfully so. You don't turn your back on friends. Even if someone else tells you to. Sure, if you don't want to hang out with me. That's fine. It's your choice. But not having the guts to tell me? That's weak. My anger was fair and just. I had reason enough to be enraged. Hate feels better than loneliness. But i still did not know where to place this justified hatred.

In the late afternoon on a Friday, i see Nathan and his pathetic pack of friends, including Jon. Leaving school to go home. And like every Friday, Nathan and Jon are going to our local pizza place.  The group splits up and each of them go their own way. The assholes, Nathan and Jon, need to walk about 15 minutes to get to the pizza place. For the first time i noticed how they actually look like dumb stereotypical jocks. I follow these idiots through the streets for a while.

After 10 minutes they cut through an alley. Just like i expected they would. Jon and Nathan have always been predictable boneheads. Jon lights a cigarette. You would expect that from someone so arrogant and dumb, i thought. I hurried my pace a little, trying to catch up to them. As they walk around the corner, i see the only the smoke from Jon's cigarette curling back in the wind. I got into a little jog to quickly get to the corner of the alley. Nathan is walking in front of Jon. I sneak closer to them...

I used to be innocent

From beneath my coat, i took the knife. I raised it with my right hand. And just as Jon inhales the smoke from his cigarette, i could perfectly time the stab into the side of his neck. The knife went in surprisingly well. Jon coughed and gurgled as bursts of smoke and blood flew from his mouth. With my left hand i pushed Jon to the side. His body slid from the knife so easily. I'm glad i sharpened it this morning. Jon immediatly fell to the floor. His cigarette bounced next to him.

Nathan had just turned around to see what happened. His face had exactly enough time to turn from surprise, to shock. I dove at him, my knife pointed towards him. The knife struck him in the side. He screamed a short "aaah" before he fell to his back. The knife stuck out of his side. I quickly moved on top of him. He wanted to pull the knife out, but luckily i was faster. With slight force i pulled the knife back with both hands. As i swung the knife upwards, a streak of blood flew from the front side of the blade. I held the knife above my head and swiftly moved it downwards towards his chest. 

Nathan was fast enough to cover his chest with his arms. My knife pushed into his left forearm. I pulled the knife back. Out of reaction, he moved his left arm back. This give me the space to force the blade down once more. This time, into his chest, near his heart. With all his strength, he swung his left arm back, towards my face. He struck my cheek rather hard. I fell to the side with the knife still in my hand. Nathan turned to his stomach and started crawling away. I returned to my senses and got back up. I slowly walked back to him.

Again, with both hands gripping the knife and holding above my head. I swung the blade down as fast as i could. The knife went into his back. I pulled it back and swung again. And a third time. And a forth time. I lost count after that. I only stopped once i felt someone grabbing my arms and pulling me from Nathan's lifeless body...

I used to be happy. I used to be kind. I used to be innocent.

There's only emptiness now...
