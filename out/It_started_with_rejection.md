I thought I was a good writer. Hell, I *knew* I was a good writer. The horror subreddit didn’t agree. Over and over, my submissions were rejected. “Your story must be true,” the mods said, “and it must have happened to you.”

That rule pissed me off. A good story is a good story, right? Why should it matter if it was true? But no, every time I sent in a carefully crafted, bone-chilling piece, I’d get the same canned response.

I should’ve let it go, but I didn’t. I spent weeks writing new stories, polishing every word. Stories about cursed keys, haunted reflections, shadowy figures. I even had a walking dog that took on human traits, kidnapping my sister. I made them sound real—like they happened to me—but the mods must have seen through it. Rejected again.

One night, as I was doom-scrolling, a message popped up from an unknown sender: xxx-xxxxxxxxxxx.

The subject line? **“Want real horror?”**

I hesitated, my finger hovering over the notification. Curiosity—and spite—got the better of me. The message was short:

*"If you want your stories accepted, make them true. Let them happen to you. Write your life into terror. Agree?"*

Below it was a single button: **Accept.**

I laughed it off, shaking my head. This had to be some kind of edgy gimmick. But frustration and desperation crept in. What if this was my ticket? What if this was some weird initiation? I clicked.

Five minutes later, there was a knock at the door.

It was late—close to midnight—and my building was always quiet at this hour. My stomach twisted as I crept to the door. I peeked through the peephole. Nothing.

But when I opened the door, there was an envelope lying on the floor.

I picked it up. My breath hitched as I turned it over. Scrawled across the back, in my own handwriting, were the words:

*"They told me not to open it. I didn’t listen."*

My hands shook. I hadn’t written that.

I threw the envelope on the counter and slammed the door shut. My chest tightened as I paced the living room, glancing at it every few minutes. By the time I crawled into bed, my thoughts were spinning, every shadow in the corner of my room thickening into shapes.

Sleep didn’t come easily. And when it did, it was filled with nightmares of hands clawing at me, pulling me down into darkness.

The next morning, I woke to the sound of my phone buzzing incessantly. Notifications poured in—hundreds of them. My heart sank as I opened the app.

My post was trending. A post I didn’t write.

The title read: **“I Found a Mysterious Envelope on My Doorstep.”**

I clicked, dread pooling in my stomach. The post described *everything* that had happened the night before. Word for word. My words. Except for one part at the end:

*“This is just the beginning.”*

My skin prickled.

That night, I tried to shake off the feeling. Tried to tell myself it was some elaborate hack. But as I brushed my teeth, I caught something in the corner of my eye. A flicker.

I froze, staring into the mirror. My reflection stared back, perfectly still. But then... it *smiled*.

Not a friendly smile. A slow, creeping grin that stretched impossibly wide. My reflection raised a hand to wave, but I didn’t move.

The lights flickered, and I bolted from the bathroom, slamming the door behind me. When I finally dared to open it again, the mirror was fogged over.

In the condensation were two words: **“You agreed.”**

I didn’t sleep that night.

By morning, another post had appeared: **“The Mirror Lied to Me.”**

I deleted my account. Changed every password. Wiped my laptop. None of it worked. The posts kept coming, each one detailing new horrors I hadn’t even experienced—*yet.*

And then came the banging.

It started in the kitchen. The sound of cabinets slamming open and shut, drawers rattling violently. I grabbed a bat and crept toward the noise, every muscle in my body tensed.

The kitchen was a disaster. Every cabinet door hung open, and drawers spilled their contents onto the floor. And there, sitting on the counter, was *the envelope.*

It was open this time.

Inside was a piece of paper, smeared with something dark and sticky. Written on it, in jagged, uneven letters, were the words:

**“You can’t stop.”**

Panic set in. I taped the windows shut, shoved furniture against the doors, and turned off my phone. I was done. If I couldn’t leave, maybe it couldn’t reach me.

But that night, my laptop turned on by itself.

The screen flickered, and the cursor began moving. Words appeared, letter by letter:

**“I Trapped Myself Inside to Escape the Horror.”**

The post described me perfectly. The barricades, the bat in my hand, the sweat dripping down my temple.

Then the post shifted.

**“She doesn’t realize it’s already here.”**

I froze. My breath hitched. Slowly, I turned around.

The room was silent, but the shadows seemed darker, thicker. A faint whisper tickled the edge of my hearing, like someone was breathing in my ear.

I whipped back toward the screen. The post had updated:

**“She thought she was safe. She was wrong.”**

The lights flickered. Then they went out completely.

And in the suffocating darkness, I felt a presence behind me. Close. Too close.

A voice rasped against my ear:

**“You’re part of the story now.”**

I screamed.

But no one heard.

The subreddit is still updating. My name is still there, attached to posts I didn’t write, describing horrors I never imagined. And somewhere out there, something is waiting.

Watching.

Because now, I’m just another story.
