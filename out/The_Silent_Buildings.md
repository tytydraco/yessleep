There’s a row of buildings I found during my urban exploration phase. It’s…quiet there. 

In the past, we have went in there screaming, stomping, banging pots and pans together but there was no sound. 

I’m sure there’s some kind of scientific explanation for this but they always gave me the creeps. I never stuck around long at those buildings, certainly never explored them. None of us did. The vibe was just …off in there. 

That said, I recall coming to them once in a while to just be alone with my thoughts or to scream my frustrations out over course work. 

Me and a few friends ran into each other by coincidence one day. Cadence was doing a study on the phenomena. I was just looking for a place to read a chapter un-disturbed, creepiness be damned. And it looked like Bryan was filming a YouTube video. 

Remembering how creepy it was when we were little teenagers, we decided to go in together. Just like old times. 

My phone buzzed. 

*where you think that door goes?*

*a storage room probably*

*open it*

*nah, it’s creepy af. You open it*

I just rolled my eyes and opened it. From the vibrations going down my arms, it was pretty rusty and creaky. 

*see, it’s a store room*

*what about that door?*

I looked up to where Bryan was pointing. There was another door behind a stack of chairs. 

*idk. A basement storage? I have my assignment to do and I need to read this*

I didn’t want to admit I was chicken. I think they knew. 

After an exchange in the group chat, we agreed, I keep this door open and text them if anyone else came in. 

And with that, they went in and I sat down. 

About an hour goes by and I’ve made pretty good progress on my assignment but then I felt a breeze catch my hair and the ground shake slightly. 

I looked up to see the door sliding shut. 

Without even thinking, I threw the chair I’d been sitting on to wedge it open. 

I shuddered when it didn’t make a sound. 

I looked around. 

Nothing around. 

Must have been a wild animal. 

Though I think I knew something was wrong already. That door was pretty heavy. 

I texted my friends. 

*y’all good down there?*

*this basement goes on forever*

*It’s starting to get dark, y’all should come back up. We can pick up tomorrow*

*we on the way already. This place creepy af*

So I found another chair, sat, and waited. 

And waited. 

Waited so long I figured they were taking the piss. So long that I managed to gather the nerve to go down there. 

I was only walking for about 5min when I ran into my friends. 

*where the fuck have you been???*

*there’s security down here*

*we need to leave!*

It was then I felt a tap on my shoulder. I jumped. Technically I screamed too but, yeah. 

He was normal looking. Thank god. Mid 20s, brown hair, brown eyes. Honestly with what happened earlier, I was expecting some kind of demon. 

He was saying something in sign language but we couldn’t make it out. 

He just shrugged and pointed towards the exit sign. He then pulled out a notepad. 

- look, I don’t want to fill out the paperwork so if you just leave now, I won’t do anything. 

Cadence shoved her phone in his face. 

*wait, why’s there no sound in here???*

The guard looked like he was trying to remember something before pulling out his pen. 

- the building isn’t actively being used but it’s not abandoned. It’s the old pipes. Look up infrasound.

As we were leaving, I remembered one thing that gives me the creeps to this day. 

While we were leaving the building. 

“Look, we don’t care if you use the above ground space as a study area, but please stay out of the lower storage levels!”

He shouted that from the spot I’d been sitting in.
