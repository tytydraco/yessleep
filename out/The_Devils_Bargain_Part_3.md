I don't know how much longer I can hold on. The line between reality and nightmare has blurred beyond recognition. My body, my mind, my very soul—they're all changing into something I can't comprehend, let alone control.

The mark on my arm has spread across my entire body now. It's not just a scar anymore; it's a living, pulsing network of black veins that writhe beneath my skin like parasitic worms. Sometimes, when I'm alone in the dark, I swear I can see them moving, pushing against my flesh as if trying to break free.

Lucifer's tasks have become unspeakable. The things he's making me do... I can't even bring myself to write them down. But I can feel what they're doing to me, to whatever's left of my humanity.

If anyone is still reading this, if there's anyone out there who can help—please. I'm begging you. Because I'm starting to think that what's happening to me isn't just about my own damnation anymore. It's about something much, much worse.

It started with my teeth. 

I woke up one morning to find my pillow soaked in blood, my mouth a throbbing mass of pain. When I looked in the mirror, I saw that my old teeth had fallen out, replaced by rows of jagged, shark-like fangs. They cut my tongue and lips constantly, filling my mouth with the coppery taste of blood.

But that was just the beginning.

My skin has become a battlefield, a war between what I was and what I'm becoming. It stretches and tears as things grow beneath it—new bones, extra muscles, structures I have no name for. I can feel them shifting when I move, pressing against my flesh from the inside.

Last night, I woke up to find that my left hand had... changed. The fingers had elongated, becoming jointed in places where there shouldn't be joints. The nails had hardened into black, curved talons sharp enough to slice through wood like butter. When I flexed it, the bones cracked and popped, rearranging themselves into impossible configurations.

I tried to cut it off—God help me, I actually tried to saw through my own wrist with a kitchen knife. But the blade just skittered off my skin, leaving not even a scratch. And then the hand moved on its own, snatching the knife away and flinging it across the room.

I could only watch in horror as the changes slowly began to creep up my arm.

The physical changes are horrifying, but what's happening to my mind is even worse.

My thoughts aren't my own anymore. Foreign ideas and impulses intrude constantly, whispering terrible things in voices that sound like screams from the pit of Hell. They tell me to hurt people, to destroy everything around me, to give in to the darkness that's consuming me.

Sometimes I black out, losing hours or even days at a time. When I come back to myself, I find evidence of things I've done—things I have no memory of but that fill me with a sickening mix of horror and... excitement.

There was blood under my fingernails yesterday. A lot of it. And when I checked the news, there was a report about a string of brutal animal mutilations in my neighborhood.

I'm afraid to sleep now because the dreams are getting worse. In them, I'm not human anymore. I'm something vast and terrible, with wings made of shadow and a mouth full of fire. I soar over cities, raining destruction down on the screaming masses below, and I *enjoy* it.

When I wake up from these dreams, it takes longer and longer for me to remember who I am—or who I used to be.

Reality itself seems to be rejecting what I've become. The world around me twists and changes in ways that defy logic or sanity.

Buildings warp when I walk past them, their facades melting like wax in the sun. Streets I've known all my life suddenly lead to impossible places—dark alleys that go on forever, doors that open into voids filled with writhing shadows.

People... God, what I see when I look at people now. Their faces flicker and change, revealing the skulls beneath their skin or transforming into monstrous visages with too many eyes and mouths that scream silently. I can see their sins hanging around them like dark auras, and sometimes I can hear their thoughts—a cacophony of fears and desires that threatens to drive me mad.

Nature recoils from my presence. Plants wither and die when I pass by, their leaves curling and blackening as if touched by invisible flames. Animals flee or attack in mindless terror. Yesterday, I saw a flock of birds fall dead from the sky as I walked through the park, their bodies hitting the ground around me with sickening thuds.

And then there are the things that *appear*—creatures that shouldn't exist outside of nightmares. I see them lurking at the edges of my vision, scuttling across ceilings or peering out from storm drains with glowing eyes. Sometimes they speak to me in languages that hurt my ears but that I somehow understand.

They call me brother. They call me master. They say they're waiting for me to fully awaken.

Last night, Lucifer came to me with what he said would be my final task. We stood atop a skyscraper that seemed to pierce the very fabric of reality, looking down at a city that pulsed and writhed like a living thing.

"You've come so far," he said, his voice smooth as silk but cold as the void. "It's time for you to fulfill your true purpose."

He handed me a knife—a cruel, twisted thing made of some black metal that seemed to drink in the light around it. Symbols I couldn't read but somehow understood were etched along its blade, glowing faintly with an inner fire.

"There's a child," Lucifer continued, his eyes—those bottomless pits of darkness—fixed on mine. "A newborn, barely a week old. You'll find her at St. Mary's Hospital, third floor, room 307. Bring her to me."

The implications of what he was asking hit me like a physical blow. This wasn't just another task—this was something irredeemable, something that would destroy whatever was left of my humanity.

"Why?" I managed to choke out, my voice barely a whisper.

Lucifer's smile widened, revealing teeth that were suddenly too sharp, too numerous. "Because, my dear, she's the key to opening the door. Her innocent soul, freely given, will be the final component we need to bring about... well, you'll see."

I wanted to refuse. Every fiber of my being screamed against it. But when I opened my mouth to say no, the pain hit me—worse than ever before. It felt like my very atoms were being torn apart and reassembled. I fell to my knees, screaming soundlessly as my body convulsed.

Through the haze of agony, I heard Lucifer's voice: "You don't have a choice anymore. You stopped having choices the moment you accepted my first offer. Now go. Bring me the child, or I'll show you what true suffering means."

The pain subsided, leaving me gasping and shaking on the ground. When I looked up, Lucifer was gone—but the knife remained, its weight in my hand a reminder of the horrific task ahead.

I'm writing this from outside St. Mary's Hospital. The knife is in my pocket, its presence like a burning coal against my leg. I can feel something inside me clawing to get out—something that wants to complete this task, that yearns for the destruction it will bring.

But there's still a small part of me—the last shred of my humanity—that's screaming in horror at what I'm about to do.

If anyone is reading this, if there's anyone out there who knows how to stop this—please. Help me. Tell me how to break free from Lucifer's control. Tell me how to end this before I do something unforgivable.

I stand outside room 307, my hand trembling as it reaches for the door handle. The knife Lucifer gave me feels like it's burning a hole in my pocket, its weight a constant reminder of the unspeakable task ahead. I can hear the soft cooing of a baby inside—innocent, unaware of the darkness that's come for her.

My body moves of its own accord, pushing the door open. The room is dim, lit only by the soft glow of a night light. In a small crib by the window lies the child—so tiny, so fragile. My hand reaches for the knife, fingers curling around its hilt as if they have a will of their own.

I approach the crib, each step feeling like I'm wading through molasses. The child looks up at me with wide, curious eyes. She doesn't cry, doesn't make a sound. It's as if she knows what's coming.

I raise the knife, its blade glinting in the dim light. Tears stream down my face as I fight against my own body, trying desperately to stop what I know is about to happen. I can feel Lucifer's presence, his anticipation palpable in the air around me.

And then, in that moment of utter despair, something breaks inside me. With every ounce of strength I have left, I cry out:

"God! Please... help me!"

The world freezes. 

The knife clatters to the floor, suddenly weightless. The shadows that have been crawling beneath my skin go still. Even the air itself seems to hold its breath.

And then... light.

It starts as a pinprick, a tiny star in the darkness of the room. But it grows, expanding outward in waves of pure, radiant energy. The light doesn't hurt my eyes like I expect it to—instead, it feels warm, comforting, like coming home after a long, terrible journey.

As the light fills the room, I see them. Figures of impossible beauty and power, their forms barely contained by human perception. Angels. They stand in a circle around me, their faces serene but their eyes burning with divine fire.

One of them—a being of such radiance that I can barely look at it directly—steps forward. Its voice, when it speaks, is like a chorus of a thousand heavenly choirs:

"Child of Earth, you have suffered much. You have been led astray, manipulated by the forces of darkness. But in your darkest hour, you called out for salvation. And you have been heard."

The angel extends its hand toward me, and I see the others do the same. I reach out, not knowing what to expect, and the moment my fingers touch the angel's, everything changes.

The divine light engulfs me completely. I feel it coursing through my veins, burning away the corruption that has taken root in my body and soul. The mark on my arm flares with searing pain and then disintegrates, taking with it all the changes Lucifer had wrought upon me.

But it doesn't stop there. The light fills me, empowers me, transforms me into something new. Knowledge floods my mind—the secrets of creation, the true nature of good and evil, the delicate balance that holds the universe together.

When the light fades, I'm no longer the broken, corrupted thing I was. I stand tall, my body restored but now imbued with a fraction of divine power. The angels around me nod in approval.

"You have been chosen," the first angel says. "To judge those who would upset the balance. To stand as a bulwark against the forces of chaos and destruction. You are no longer bound by Lucifer's machinations. You are the new Judge of Hell."

With those words, reality shifts. I find myself standing not in the hospital room, but at the gates of Hell itself. But it's different now—I see it not with eyes of terror, but with understanding. I see the intricate workings of divine justice, the necessity of consequences for mortal actions.

And there, before me, stands Lucifer. His handsome facade is gone, replaced by his true form—a being of twisted beauty and terrifying power. But now, with my new sight, I see the chains of divine judgment that bind him, that have always bound him.

He snarls at me, his voice a mixture of rage and disbelief: "What is this? What have you done?"

I step forward, feeling the weight of my new role settle upon my shoulders. "What had to be done," I reply, my voice resonating with newfound authority. "Your reign of terror ends now, Lucifer. You've overstepped your bounds for the last time."

With a gesture, I call forth divine chains that wrap around him, binding him more tightly than ever before. He struggles, screams, but against the power I now wield, he's powerless.

"You will return to your appointed task," I declare. "No more deals. No more corruption of innocent souls. You will face judgment for your actions, as all must."

As Lucifer is dragged away, howling in fury and defeat, I turn to face the endless expanse of Hell. There's work to be done—centuries of corruption to undo, souls to judge fairly, balance to restore.

But for the first time in what feels like an eternity, I feel hope. Real, genuine hope. Because even in the darkest places, in the most desperate moments, salvation is possible. Redemption is possible.

All you have to do is ask.
