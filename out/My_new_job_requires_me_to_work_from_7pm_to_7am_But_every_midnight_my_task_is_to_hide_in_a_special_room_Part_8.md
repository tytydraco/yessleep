My apologies for not keeping up with the schedule. I know, I did not update you on the situation the past Wednesday. It is because a lot has happened since the last time I posted, which was the previous Sunday, I guess. The entire week has been a roller-coaster, and I believe much more things will happen from now on.

On Monday, my wife woke me up in absolute panic, shouting about something happening to the children. We both rushed to their bedroom and found them lying straight in their beds and very pale, like corpses on autopsy tables. My wife stopped at the door, murmuring that something was not right, while I was trying to shake my children awake, calling their names. She then said that she shook them just like I was doing, before she came to wake me up, but could not understand how they were back lying down completely straight. I then asked her to call an ambulance.

Fortunately, they are both far from being dead according to the doctor, however, up to this point as I am typing this post, there is still no clear explanation for their condition and they are still unconscious, trapped in some sort of coma.

Around 6 pm the same day, I received a call from my supervisor, who was worried about me not yet showing up at work, since I was always on time and 6:30 pm was fast approaching for him. I refrained from explaining what had happened to my children to him, even though he will read it here later. I did not want to use the condition of my children as a way to get some sort of emergency leave. I was done with that job, so I said it straight and raw.

"This is not happening my friend." He calmly responded.

Look, this is surely not the conventional way to quit a job, but when employees choose this path, most of the time in this country, the employers just let them go as they always feel powerful and confident enough to replace staff even on the same day. I could understand that thirty minutes or so were not enough to replace me before the next shift, but my supervisor seemed to make it clear that the company will not let me go. I was not allowed to quit.

While the conversation slowly evolved into an argument, my wife once again came to fetch me as something was happening to the kids. I hanged up and rushed towards their room.

"Go back to your duty Kol. The black room awaits." They kept on repeating, still lying straight, just speaking simultaneously and mechanically to pass that terrifying message.

The nurses turned to my wife and I, communicating only through their expressions, asking us what was happening and what were they talking about? They stopped before the doctor arrived.

Conquered by fear and anxiety, my wife left the room in tears, on the verge of just losing her mind. Meanwhile, my supervisor kept on calling, harassing me on the phone. I picked up to put an end to that and we argued a little bit more. He concluded by saying that if I did not resume the job, I should expect a visit from the enforcer, before hanging up on me. I needed to be with my wife.

On Tuesday, in the early hours of the morning as we were still in the hospital, I finally told my wife that I will not be returning to that work. Surprisingly, she did not react to it at all, but instead, she opened up a little bit about some strange things she has been experiencing on her own and that she tried to ignore or repress for her sanity. 

She explained to me that during the days when I am off duty, she sometimes takes care of the laundry and for the occasion, she would include all the items that are parts of my uniform. However, those items, despite not emanating smoke, would come out of the washing machine burning hot. One time, when she was about to remove the items from the washing line, she noticed something on the T-shirt. The sun was behind it in terms of trajectory, and she could see transparent patterns on the cloth, making her wonder what type of fancy fabric was used for just a T-shirt.

I left her there and rushed home to confirm what she saw while trying to reach my day shift counterpart on the phone to no avail. I had been trying to contact him since last weekend. I arrived home and retrieved the remaining parts of the uniform and on them, I used the sole fancy flashlight I reserved for home and personal use. Nothing was visible at first, even in the UV mode, but when I moved the UV light behind the clothes, I saw and recognized the crafty patterns from the black room. I tried the same thing with everything that came from that company, including the contract, and I saw the patterns even through the paper.

The next day, after informing my wife about my future actions, I went to the company with the uniform in a conveniently black garbage bag without any prior phone call to my supervisor. Right at the entrance, I was greeted by a sight of horror when I saw the motorcycle guy standing there with the red uniform, as a replacement to my day shift counterpart. He refused to let me in acting on instructions from the supervisor, who soon stepped out to meet me there.

Doing my best by avoiding keywords in front of that stalker dude, I explained to my supervisor that I was not returning to work just like my previous day shift counterpart because of reasons he definitely knew of. Once again, he protested, reminding me about the terms of the contract which I believe he also knew was content-shifting. Under the look of the motorcycle guy, smirking with satisfaction, I threw the garbage bag containing the uniform in front of his feet before storming off, determined to leave that dark part of my life behind.

Emotions and distress overwhelmed me during that day, preventing me from functioning correctly, which as well explains why I could not write, edit and post an update at that time. Once again, my apologies.

On Thursday, after being tired of calling my colleague to no avail, I typed his name on browsers and social media apps and managed to get one of his accounts. I checked his contacts and posts on the social media app and could identify his wife. I wasted no time to send a request and she wasted no time to accept, going as far as calling me first. It turned out that both of us were looking for my colleague, a fact that crushed me just like what she had to say, explaining me that one night at 12 am, the police came to look for him, he went with them but he never returned since. There was no record about any officer being dispatched to his home, so even the law enforcement did not recognize having a hand in his disappearance.

The next day, my wife and I were smoking in the living room at around 6 am, unable to sleep because of the whole ordeal. In fact, we spent the whole night there. The condition of the children had worsened, as gangrene had appeared on some parts of their little and fragile bodies, slowly ushering them into death. When I proposed her to go to the bedroom and get some rest, she declined, encouraging me to go alone.

I opened the door and gasped at what I saw waiting for me. She stood up and came to take a look, gasping as well at the sight. The garbage bag containing the uniform was back. Facing a nightmare that was then consuming her more than myself, my wife closed the door, hyperventilating in fear and looked at me. She knew that I gave the uniform back, I told her everything, and that day she even apologized about not believing me at first.

However, that was a clear sign of intrusion and it had to be solved. In disbelief, I reopened the door and we found the uniform out of the bag, then standing on its own in front of us, as if worn by an invisible entity, before it stormed towards us. I slammed the door closed and whatever was on the other side banged on it relentlessly, without trying to use the doorknob. My wife lost it, yelling at it to just leave us alone while I received a call from the supervisor, and it seemed to make the supernatural occurrence stop on the spot.

You may have a clear idea of what he had to say, but precisely his message can be rephrased as this:

"All that will not stop. For the sake of your kids, your wife and yourself, before the enforcer pays you a visit, go back to work!"

There may be a day when these updates will stop prematurely. I think that I really should return to work for now because everything is really getting out of control. Many of you, as real human beings with genuinely good hearts have ignored my mistakes and suggested a lot of ideas since the first post. I have explored some of them. This time, everything is much worse and once again, after sharing my story to the community, I beg you to suggest anything that might get me and my family out of this deadly trap. Please!
