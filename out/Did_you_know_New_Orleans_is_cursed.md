First of all let me start off with some explanations. I’m lucky enough to be a freelance travel writer, along with two of my closest friends. We get to visit a ton of incredibly cool places, but I think our fortune is offset by some unusual bad luck. It seems like we run into something really weird on all of our trips. And I don’t mean normal weird, like crazy people, I mean stuff you would never believe. 

We all started keeping a journal last year (after things got especially weird), and I figured I would share some of our experiences with you guys.

Leilani and I went to New Orleans for Mardi Gras a while back. We invited my cousin Theo but he didn't have any assignments in or around the city for the magazine he works at, so he decided to pass. 

I invited my other friend Otho to join us since he's mentioned being fond of the city before (tell me if you want to hear about how we met Otho, he’s a cool guy). His response was, "Dahlin, I been partyin' here since Ash Wednesday." The irony was not lost on us.

Leilani and I had a few different events to attend, but it was a nice change of pace from our last few trips, where we follow Theo out into the woods or mountains and inevitably find ourselves running for our lives. We spent the last night out in the city with Otho and wound-up walking through a dark, strangely quiet part of the city on our way back to our hotel. We passed through a series of alleys and about halfway through saw a man hunched over groaning. Otho, who had been (rather drunkenly) singing some Appalachian folk song just a moment before, went completely silent and threw his arms out to stop us. He immediately spun around, wrapped his arms around our shoulders, and bent down to whisper to us.

"Ladies we may have just found ourselves in a bit of a precarious situation, I recommend you stay behind me and be ready to run when this goes sideways."
Leilani and I looked at each other in a mix of confusion and panic. I looked back at the man on the ground, he was wearing jeans and a t-shirt and seemed to be simply drunk and miserable.

"Otho, you're three times his size and he's black out drunk. I don't think he's really a threat to us."

Otho smiled, but shook his head, adjusting a silver ring on his left hand as he did so. "No, no darlin'. That man isn't drunk, he just violated his Lent."

I opened my mouth to ask what that had to do with anything (and a hundred other questions), but Otho had already turned around to walk towards the man on the ground. He stood over him for a moment and just when I had decided he had lost his mind, the man on the ground stopped groaning and stood up. 

He smiled up at Otho, but something was wrong with his mouth, it looked too wide, and his eyes seemed to be a bit too far apart, it was like his face was melting and turning an ugly shade of gray. 

Otho sighed and took a step back, and the man lunged forward but not at him. He was trying to get past Otho, towards us, and as he moved towards us his face elongated into a snout, his fingers became clawed, and he became a strange mix between man and werewolf, as if the transformation started but he got stuck halfway through. Leilani and I stumbled backwards, but Otho was too fast for him. He threw out his right arm to stop him, then punched out with his left hand and connected firmly with the creature's temple. It crumpled to the ground anticlimactically, and we ran forward.

Otho shook out his hand and wiped a bit of blood off his silver ring. Leilani gestured to the man on the ground, "Otho how did you know this was going to happen?"

"I don't often fast anything for Lent myself, at least not when I plan on being in New Orleans, but when I was a youngin' I had a friend who struggled with the bottle. He decided to give it up for Lent, but we came to the city to party, and he decided one night wouldn't be too bad. There's some kinda hex on the city though, this is the only place I've seen it happen. If you break Lent by consuming whatever you were supposed to give up you turn into what's called a Rougarou."

He said the last word with a howl at the end, then chuckled at his own joke. "Basically, something like a werewolf. My friend seemed a little more aware than this fella, or maybe this fella was lookin' for an excuse to commit some evil tonight anyway. We visited a lady who knows a lot about this kinda thing who told us if he could go seven days without hurting anyone he would transform back. So, we took him home and locked him in an outhouse."

He paused and Leilani and I looked at each other and burst out laughing.

I said, "Are you serious?"

Otho nodded, grinning, "He was pretty good for the most part, though he did howl a fair bit. We gave him water and some scraps while we waited out the week, and he's never touched the bottle since."

We all looked down at the groaning Rougarou, which seemed to be regaining consciousness. 

Otho picked him up and threw him over his shoulder, "C'mon ladies, we don't have much time. I hate to keep punchin' him in the head every time he stirs, I've no idea how much damage he'll retain when he comes back."

We followed Otho through the city as he took a winding route to the French quarter, then slightly past it. We stopped once when the man fully regained consciousness, then made it to the home of a woman so old she looked like she might have been born in the early 1800's. She reminded me a lot of Leilani’s grandma, on the Cherokee side, with dark tan skin and long white hair braided into two strands. She had dark brown eyes that seemed to take in more information than just what was on the surface. She was small, about six inches shorter than me, but she had a confidence and poise that made her seem a lot taller. She opened the door with a cranky look on her weathered face that changed to delight when she saw Otho. Otho dropped the Rougarou, then bent down to give the woman a gentle hug. She pinched his cheek, then looked down at the strange creature dropped unceremoniously at her feet.

"Otho darlin' don't tell me your friends are breaking Lent again."

"No Millie, all my friends know better. This ain't anyone I'm familiar with."

Millie looked pointedly at Leilani and I, and Otho made our introductions. After everyone had greeted each other, Millie motioned for Otho to bring the man inside. She opened a cabinet and grabbed a pill that she dropped into the creature's open mouth, then trickled a bit of liquid after it and stroked his throat until he swallowed it, she nodded with a pleased sigh, and hobbled across the room and sat down heavily in an old recliner. 

She gestured for Leilani and I to sit with her and called out for Otho to make us some tea. Leilani leaned forward, "What was that pill? Is it going to fix what's wrong with him?"

Millie chuckled, "Oh darlin' no. Even if there was a pill like that, sometimes you gotta suffer the consequences for your actions. And in New Orleans the consequences for not respecting the good Lord are very serious. No, that was just something to keep him asleep long enough for us to find a good place to let him work off his consequences without needing Otho to keep bashing his head in."

She threw a disapproving glance at Otho, who stopped pulling cups from her cabinet and looked at her like a chastised child.

"Millie, he was feral. I only did what I had to."

She smiled, "I believe you baby, but we don't want to help the poor man to death."

Otho turned back to the cabinet, grumbling under his breath as he finished making tea, while Millie turned back to us.

"So what brings two nice girls like yourselves to New Orleans?"


"Leilani and I write for different travel magazines. We review things like hotels, events, cruises, and restaurants and publish articles recommending where people can go when they travel, and what events are best for families, couples, or people traveling with their friends. We normally travel with my cousin Theo who writes for a nature magazine, but he didn't have a good reason to come to New Orleans and didn't feel like paying out of pocket for something that doesn't interest him much."

Otho walked over with four cups of tea on a platter and handed them out. Millie patted his hand as she took her tea, "Thank you sweetheart. What on earth is a nature magazine?"

I chuckled, "It's a magazine for people who really like hunting, hiking, basically anything outdoorsy. He reviews different products like tents, sleeping bags, or hunting tools. He’s even done a lot of reviews for different clothing brands for their durability, and how well they work out on the trail. He also reviews trails and camping sites for things like accessibility, ease of travel, and a few other factors. Accessibility is especially important to him. He had a pretty bad accident a while back and lost a foot.

She made a sympathetic face as she sipped her tea thoughtfully, "Why, I didn't even know these magazines existed until just now. Where can I find one?"

I glanced over at Leilani, "We can send you some, we get copies of all of the ones we write for. We would be happy to send them to you. I'm sure Theo would be thrilled to include his articles as well."

Millie smiled, "Well now I think that's a very generous offer. I'll have to find some way to repay you for it. But for right now let's work out your Rougarou problem."

Otho dragged a wooden chair from her dining room table into the sitting area and sat down. 

C"Millie, do you think we could keep him in your basement?"

Millie scoffed, "Otho I have about a million reasons to say no to that. The most important one being that when that man wakes up in about a week, I don't need him calling the police on little old me for kidnapping."

Otho shrugged, "It was just an idea. I don't know of any outhouses we could put him in."

Leilani and I worked hard to keep straight faces at that, but Millie just looked thoughtful.
 
"You know, my dearly departed husband had a cabin out on Blind Lagoon. I haven't been there in years, so it's just standin' empty. I bet you could find a way to keep him out of trouble up there."

The three of us looked at each other for a moment, then Otho shrugged.

"That's only about 40 minutes from here if we drive. Guess I better go get my truck so we can move him while it's still dark."

Millie nodded, "Get some chains and padlocks and what not too. You'll need to keep him in one place. Oh, and don't forget some food for the poor thing. We don't want to starve him to death."

Otho rolled his eyes, "I've taken care of a Rougarou before Mil."

Millie laughed, "Of course you have dear, you probably know more than I do about these things. Now get out of here, I'm old and I don't need to be up all night."

Otho kissed her gently on the cheek, then exited into the darkness. While we waited for him to come back with his truck, I showed Millie the drawings and notes in my sketchbook and told her about what had happened on our travels so far. We told her about Theo losing his foot saving Leilani from the Skadegamutc, and she clapped her hands to her chest with a sad look.

"That poor boy. Those old forest witches can be awful dangerous. Did he pull through okay?"

Leilani nodded, "Thankfully yes, it's been hard for him though. His job pretty much relies on him being active all the time, and he had to take a lot of time off to heal. But prosthetic technology is getting better all the time, and the magazine he works for saw this as a good opportunity to branch out to a wider audience. He's also reviewed a few different types of prosthetics designed specifically for hikers and outdoorsmen, so he's making the best of things."

Millie smiled, "That's good, it sounds like he's got a bright spirit. And you seem quite fond of him."

Leilani blushed and changed the subject back to the cryptids, which Millie accepted gracefully. She lectured us about the properties of different herbs and how some metals and sigils had the power of protection, and how salt could burn away some evil spirits.
 
"Salt and light is what the good book says. There's not many evil things that can withstand salt and light dear."

Leilani gave Millie her ‘I have an idea look’ and asked, "What about the Rougarou? Could salt and light do anything to help him?"

"Dear, a Rougarou is just a man who made a choice to turn his back on what he knew was good for him. Evil spirits is one thing, but humans making bad choices is something entirely different. A person making bad choices has to stop before the bad takes over. Eventually you can get so bad you burn away all the good stuff and you're just left with the ugliest parts of being human. Not much can be done for you then. A Rougarou isn’t an evil spirit though, just a foolish man."

I took notes until she changed gears, telling us stories about living in New Orleans, her husbands, and finally stories about what Otho was like in his younger years. Apparently Otho had been quite the adventurer, and even helped her a few times with some problems. After a while Otho came back inside.

"Millie, thank you kindly for all your help tonight. We'd better get out of your hair and get this fella to the cabin before he starts to wake up."

Millie stood and reached for a basket on the mantle behind her. She took out an old key and handed it to Leilani, with a small picture of her and a man with a kind smile standing in front of a cabin.

"The key to George's cabin. It was a pleasure meeting you girls. Please write to me when you have time, I'd love to hear more about your travels. And if you ever find yourself in these parts do stop by for tea and cookies, at a more acceptable hour."

Leilani and I nodded, thanked Millie for the tea and advice, gave her a quick hug, and followed Otho out to his truck. We debated for a few minutes about who should ride with the Rougarou. 

Otho wasn't keen to let either of us sit in the bed of a truck with a werewolf that could wake up at any moment, but Leilani and I argued that we don't know our way around well enough to drive to Blind Lagoon. Finally, we agreed to put the Rougarou up front with Otho and Leilani and I would both sit in the bed of the truck. It was, thankfully, an uneventful drive to the cabin. When we got there, we helped Otho drag the Rougarou and supplies into the cabin. We set up a place for him and helped Otho get the chains nailed down. I pointed out how wrong it felt, and Otho nodded somberly.

"It ain't fun helping a Rougarou. But I've seen what these fellas can do if they're out loose and don't want to control themselves. He could hurt a lot of people. And at the end of it, if they don't make it the seven days, they stay like this for almost six months before it kills them. I don't like the way this looks either, but I like the idea of a man dying when we have the chance to save him even less."

By the time the creature finally woke up, the sun was shining in through the windows and we had him chained, a sleeping area set up for him, and a bowl of food and some water set down nearby. We waited a few hours to make sure everything would hold, then Otho drove us back to the hotel. He told us he was planning on staying at the cabin until the end of the seven days so he could keep an eye on the man and let him out when he turns back. Apparently he had also bought a small portable radio and some toys for the guy which we thought was sweet, if a little weird.
