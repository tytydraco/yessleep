In the heart of an ancient, dense forest, a colossal waterfall cascaded down from a towering cliff. The reverberating roar of its mighty plunge filled the air, mingling with the rustling leaves and whispering winds among the trees. Concealed behind the curtain of water, two weary farmhands, Nate Ramos and Adam Lin, sought refuge within the shelter of a dimly lit cave. The atmosphere inside was laden with tension, the ominous cries and menacing roars of otherworldly creatures echoing outside, a haunting reminder of the peril that lurked.  
Gripping a stick with intensifying fervor, Nate's knuckles grew pale against the worn wood. "Adam, we fucked up." Adam nodded solemnly; his gaze warily fixed upon the entrance of the cave.   
Two hours earlier, as the sun cast long shadows through the cornfields, a peculiar surge of energy had rippled from the depths of the earth. Intrigued and unaware of the impending danger, Nate and Adam had abandoned their farm chores to investigate the anomaly. Stepping out of their weathered truck, a gust of wind whisked Nate's baseball cap away, but neither he nor Adam diverted their attention from the enigmatic disturbance. The anomaly swirled and hissed, suspended just above the ground, an otherworldly enigma that defied explanation.  
"What in the world?" Adam's voice held a mixture of astonishment and unease. "We should tell the boss."  
"Hold on." Nate's curiosity got the better of him as he moved closer to the anomaly. "I want to try something." Retrieving a length of rope from the truck bed, Nate fashioned a loop on both ends and secured one around his waist. "Tie the other end around yourself, Adam." He pointed to the rope coiled on the ground.  
Confusion mingled with concern, Adam followed Nate's instructions, cinching the rope around his own waist. "What are you doing, Nate?"  
"I'm going to throw a rock at it and see what happens. If things go sideways, you can pull me back to safety." Nate raised his voice over the intensifying wind.  
With the makeshift safety line in place, Nate picked up a small rock and flung it at the anomaly. No reaction. Another, slightly larger rock followed suit. Still nothing. "You see, it's not so bad," Nate reassured Adam, his confidence returning. His attention shifted to a long stick on the ground nearby. "Come on." Nate tugged at the other end of the rope.  
Cautiously, he approached the swirling mist, his eyes flicking back to Adam as a silent signal. Extending the stick towards the anomaly, Nate moved forward inch by inch. In an instant, the swirling energy seized him, yanking him off his feet and dragging Adam along with him. Desperate and futile, Adam clung to the earth, but the force was overwhelming, hurtling them both into the portal.  
Back in the present, a thunderous crash rent the air, trees splintering and agonizing cries piercing through the very fabric of the forest. Their backs pressed against the cave's farthest recesses, Nate and Adam exchanged a glance of terror. "Those things, they're huge!" Nate's voice was a barely audible whisper.  
"Nate, should we say a prayer together? I... I think we should," Adam's voice trembled with a mix of fear and resolve. Nate nodded, edging closer to Adam. With heads bowed but eyes fixed on the entrance, they shared a prayer, murmurs and whimpers joining in the solemn rhythm of their voices.  
As the night grew deeper, an unseen creature's resonant bellow shattered the stillness, its deep vibrations quivering through the earth. Beyond the veil of water, two full moons emerged into view—one red, the other white.  
\*Thanks for reading! I’m thinking about expanding on this story and making it a series. Just want to gauge the interest in this premise before I start a new project in this genre.\*
