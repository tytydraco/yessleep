I was hired off a forum that doesn’t exist anymore. It was just a message board for under-the-table labor. Cleanouts, junk hauling, late-night moving jobs. Nothing illegal on the surface, but it attracted people who didn’t ask questions.

The job post read:  
**“$200/hr, cash. Digging work. Remote. Must be discreet. No experience needed.”**

I didn’t think twice. I was broke and had done worse for less.

They picked me up in a van with no plates. The back was empty except for a shovel, a tarp, and a red gas can. I asked where we were headed and the guy driving just said, “Off-grid.” That’s when I should’ve bailed, but the money was already in my pocket. $400 up front. I stayed.

It was pitch-black by the time we reached the site. No cell signal. No moonlight. Just trees and silence so thick it felt like a blanket over my ears. He handed me a headlamp and pointed to a patch of dirt. Said he needed a pit — 6 feet deep, 8 feet wide. That was it.

I dug.

The ground was weird. Not just soft — **disturbed**. Like someone had already dug there and filled it in again.

An hour in, my shovel hit something hard. Not stone. **Hollow**.

The guy was leaning against a tree, smoking. “Keep going,” he said, not even looking.

I cleared more dirt until I saw it: a black garbage bag. Thick. Industrial. Tied tight. It looked swollen. Misshapen. I paused.

He walked over and said, “Don’t open it.” But it wasn’t a warning. More like a **reminder**.

I didn’t listen.

I tore the bag open, just enough to see.

The smell punched me before the sight did. Sweet rot and metal. Inside was a body — but not whole. Not a clean kill. Whoever it was had been **cut into pieces**, but badly. Arms still half-attached. Skin peeled back in places like they were trying to get underneath. The worst part was the head — the mouth was **stitched shut** with what looked like fishing line.

I dropped the shovel and backed away. “I didn’t sign up for this.”

He smiled like he’d heard it before.

“You did, actually. You just didn’t read the fine print.”

Before I could move, I felt something sharp in my neck. Burned like acid. I remember falling, face-first into the dirt. Everything went black.

When I woke up, I was in the pit.

Bag gone.

He was above me, shoveling dirt back in. One scoop at a time.

I screamed, but my voice cracked. My arms wouldn’t move. I was paralyzed, but fully awake. I remember soil hitting my face. I remember the taste of it.

Then — nothing.

I don’t know how long I was out.

I woke up later — **not in the pit**.

I was in a cold room, tied to a steel table. Clean walls. Stainless lights. No windows. I wasn’t alone. There were **others**, strapped down like me. Some were asleep. Some were... twitching.

A man in a surgical apron walked in. Same guy. He was holding a scalpel and a camera.

“You’re going to help me make something special,” he said.

I blacked out again.

They must’ve moved me. I’m in a motel now. I don’t know where. There’s a note taped to the mirror that says:  
**“You’re not done digging.”**

There’s a shovel in the bathtub.

Every night since, I’ve been dreaming about that pit. The stitched mouth. The eyes that blinked when I thought they were dead. And my hands, digging through meat.

I don’t know how I got out. I don’t know what they did to me.

But I haven’t slept more than an hour at a time since.

And this morning, someone slid a manila envelope under my door.

Inside:  
Cash.  
A photo of a new patch of forest.  
And a note.

**“Bring the shovel.”**

  
I burned the envelope. Every dollar. I should’ve left the motel. Smashed my phone. Found a church or a police station or even a fucking cliff to jump off.

But I didn’t.

That night, I stood in the forest again. Same silence. Same headlamp. Same shovel. I don’t remember driving there. Or getting dressed. But there I was, hands blistered before I even started digging — like my body remembered something I didn’t.

I dug.

This time, I hit something *soft*.

Not earth. Not a body either.

Cloth.

I pulled it free — a child’s dress. Pale yellow. Soaked through. I dropped it, heart sprinting, when I saw the hand come up from under it — thin, gray, small.

Then the eyes opened.

White. Glowing. No pupils. Just... watching me. No breath. No twitch. No threat. Just *awareness*.

I screamed. I ran. The forest stretched like elastic. Trees shifted behind me, branches snapping where nothing moved. I tripped, hard — and fell straight through the dirt. Not onto it — through it.

I landed on tile.

A basement.

White-tiled walls. Red plastic curtains. Surgical tools lined up perfectly on metal trays.

And across from me — *him*. The man in the apron. Except it wasn’t an apron now. It was skin. **Human skin. Worn inside-out. Sewn at the shoulders. Flaps still bleeding.**

He smiled.

“You’re making great progress.”

I scrambled back, but the floor was slick. Blood. Not dry — fresh. *Dripping* from the ceiling.

He pointed up.

That’s when I saw it.

The ceiling was **meat**. Human torsos, hung upside down, stripped of limbs. Breasts, ribs, spines — twitching like they were still trying to breathe. One of them *was*.

I locked eyes with a face half-buried in the ceiling. **My face.**

It blinked.

I blacked out again.

I woke up in my bed.

Back at the motel.

Clothes clean. Shovel gone. No blood. No envelope. Nothing.

I ran to the mirror.

My face looked fine.

Except — my mouth was different.

My lips had a faint line across them. Too straight. Too clean.

I leaned in, pulled my lips apart, and saw **the stitches**.

Tiny ones. Just under the skin. Hidden. Like they’d been sewn shut, then carefully *sliced back open*.

Someone had *opened* me.

I booked it out of the motel. Stole a car. Drove for hours until I saw lights. A town. Civilization.

I stopped at a diner. Needed to feel human again. The waitress looked at me like she recognized me. Asked if I wanted “the usual.”

I’d never been there before in my life.

Then I noticed the people around me.

Every face was familiar.

**Every single customer was someone I’d seen in that basement.**

On tables. Hanging. Screaming.

Except now they were smiling. Eating. Talking.

Like nothing had ever happened.

I ran out.

Back in the car, I checked the rearview mirror.

A new envelope was sitting in the back seat.

I opened it, hands shaking.

Inside:

* Another photo of the forest
* A note: “We left something open.”
* A Polaroid of me… with my **eyes removed**
* And a small jar

Inside the jar: my **tongue**.

Still warm.

That was four days ago.

I can’t talk anymore. I can barely eat. But I keep *digging*.

I think they left part of me behind. I think I’m supposed to find it.

Or maybe… I already did.

Last night, I dug up **my own corpse**. Arms chewed down to the bone. Eyes gone. Mouth open like it was screaming. But the face was mine. Same scar under the chin. Same chipped tooth.

Only difference?

It was smiling.

**And taped to its chest was a note in my handwriting.**

It said:

**“You’re the one who started this. You’re just digging to remember.”**

  
You weren’t supposed to read this. You were supposed to forget. Now we have to dig you back open.
