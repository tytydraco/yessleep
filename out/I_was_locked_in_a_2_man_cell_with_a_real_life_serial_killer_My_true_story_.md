Hello everyone. My name is Minister Kyle. I’m a non-denominational preacher here in Alabama. I haven’t always been a man of God, though. I’ve had my share of ups and downs, as we all have. I always like to say that nobody hits as hard as life, it is merely one big learning experience where we are all forced to endure our mistakes in order to learn and Achieve our God-given potential. Life is one big fight. Life is filled with many battles. One of my many battles took place In August 2016. A battle, that quite frankly, would change my life forever. When I was young, i lost both of my parents tragically. my mother died in a house fire and my father of a heart attack. This caused me to be very rebellious at a young age.

I’m not sure if many of you can relate but growing up without Parents will cause a child to be forced to stay in some pretty sketchy places, surrounded by some pretty sketchy people. It’s almost as if these types of individuals take advantage of the fact that you don’t have a guardian to protect you. And the world is filled with real monsters who pray on the innocence of children, as well as children whose parents have failed to protect them, so to speak. As far as myself, i was forced to experience what I can only describe as a living hell and had been inflicted with a deep rooted trauma, some of which I carry still to this very day.

Anyways, I was 25 years old at this time. I did not have any support at all and began using drugs in order to cope with my trauma and to support my addiction and lifestyle. Honestly, at the time I was a tattoo artist. When you deal with tattoo customers, the majority of them are in the criminal underworld. Criminals just love tattoos. Bikers, gangsters, you get the idea. I was however, smoking marijuana though. And some of my customers were weed dealers. I would trade in tattoos for weed. Sometimes half a pounds or more at a time. I would smoke on it for a couple of months and when I ran out, I would do the same thing. Call the dealer and ask if he was ready to trade some ink.

I couldn’t eat the weed so sometimes I would get rid of some to my close friends. It just so happens that my close friends were the ones to take away my freedom. one evenin, They came over to hang out. we smoked a bunch of weed and we talked as usual. I noticed that they were on edge and when I asked them what was wrong they told me that they were having personal problems at home. I had no reason to suspect them of anything else we had been friends for over two years at this time. Sometime during that evening, they asked me if I would sell them a 20 sack. I was a tattoo artist and piercing professional at the time, and at this time, I was making great money swinging in and I had no reason to deal drugs. But I have always been a really good friend and I have a good heart and in this particular case, it would be my downfall big time.

at the time, I did not realize the length that some departments go through in order to catch a person selling drugs. They will send multiple confidential informants to purchase from you. They use the dirtiest tactics imaginable. They even provide the cash to the informants and wire them up with hidden cameras and devices, stashed and stuff like ink pens, hats, I’ve seen cameras on the buttons of a shirt even.

this particular day, I was out of marijuana. I wanted to smoke and I was going to get a sack anyway. 2 friends of mine came over and asked me if I wanted to smoke with them and if I could get some weed so I called up our weed man. the weed man pulled up and I went outside. I purchased two 20$ bags of weed from him and I came back inside where these two friends of mine were waiting. I put the weed on the table and asked them to pick whichever one they wanted. My friend put the weed in her pocket and went straight towards the door. She was acting so strange. I told her to wait, we could smoke my bag of weed for free. But she was in so much of a hurry that she turned it down and I knew that was strange because nobody’s gonna turn down free weed. Nobody. Lol.

I didn’t recognize the vehicle they came to my house. It was just all wrong. I didn’t recognize all of these signs at the time because you don’t suspect someone that you’ve been loyal to , to betray you so savage anyways, this caused The narcotics squad to have enough as evidence to form a secret, indictment and warrant an arrest.

I went to jail on a secret indictment for selling weed. two days after they left my house about 15 vehicles pulled up in the front yard and about 25 narcotic squad officers and the sheriffs department proceeded to kick my doors In. All of them were carrying automatic AR style machine guns. Bulletproof vests. The works. They put my elderly uncle on his face with a gun and began to tear our house to pieces as I sat in the back of a cop car and watched them, proceeded with the search warrant.  
In Alabama, on a secret indictment charge, they will give you one chance to turn three other dealers that you know personally over to them on indictments and they will dismiss your case. Because I refused, they had the judge and the district attorney place a bond hold on me during the entirety of my Case. Which was almost almost 2 years. This means I was being held without bond. While I was there, my cellmate was a known serial killer. He was responsible for the death of at least 17 people that they know about. His name was Wilmore Wiggins from Camden Alabama. Although He was responsible for at least 17 murders, they only had enough evidence on one of the murders to actually prove it. This man had been terrorizing our community for years. I mean years. He was a voodoo practitioner, as were the rest of his family members.  
One night, after lockdown, I was just staring at the roof of my bunk. He was on the top bunk, and I was on the bottom. We had already been locked down for a few hours. It was so quiet that you could hear the building settling if you listen intently. In jail, you have nothing but time to think. About life. About the direction of your life. About life in general. I was doing just that one night. I did not realize he was still awake. Through the deafening silence I heard a voice ask the question, “hey Big“, which is what they called me by the way, “you ever killed anybody.” I didn’t even have to think about it and responded immediately, “never.” He asked me if I ever thought about killing anyone. I responded, “no sir. Never.” That is when he began confessing one of the mini murders that he committed, one here in my hometown that he was never even charged with. A murder that took place that is now a cold case. A murder that’s never been solved.

First off, as I said before, he practiced voodoo. So he began to describe in detail how he got away with his 17 murders. As I began to squint through the darkness of the cell, I noticed in the mirror above the sink that he was now sitting up on his bed. He was looking for someone to talk to in order to release this burden. I was more than happy to listen as I am not only into true crime, but also I have always been an understanding person. I’m also A really good listener. And this was something that was very intriguing to me at the moment, it even kind of resembled a horror story or something like a scary movie. It had me on the edge of my bunk. I couldn’t move a muscle as I listened with the fullest of intent.  
Anyways, as I sat there, listening, He told me that his voodoo allowed him to get away with the crimes. He said that if you want to get away with murder, you should plant a rosebush in front of your house. He said you can go and get a piece of that persons hair, the person you wish to harm, and bury it at the foot of that rosebush. Then you take a piece of sewing thread and he would tie it and run the thread from the stem of one of the roses and tie it to the door knob of his home, which was 15 to 20 feet away. He told me that as long as that thread is in place, he could go out and commit any murder or crime that he wanted, and there would be no retribution. he told me that there was an entity named zombie. This entity would come inside of him and possess him, giving him supernatural knowledge, wisdom, and insight in order to conceal evidence after his murders. Personally, I am an ordained minister now, and I can tell you from experience that not only can God supernaturally empower a person , but also, Satan can as well. The consequences for this is a price that nobody would want to pay. The ones that do I’m sure regret it sorely eventually. Anyways, he told me that as long as that thread is in place the spell remains. He told me that he did this every single time he killed somebody and he got away with over 16 murders.I cannot tell you as a matter of fact, whether this voodoo thing is real or not. All I can tell you that is factual, is that he 100 percent believed in it to his soul.

My community was terrorized by this man for years and years. Everybody in my town literally knew this man was a serial but they could never prove it. Ever. He was just so manipulative and cunn and clever and had the uncanny ability to be able to manipulate evidence to his advantage in order to conceal his crimes. He told me that one in particular he was in the bar room with his girlfriend. After he went to use the bathroom, talking to his girlfriend and it infuriated him. After knowing this man for two years, I can tell you from experience that he’s not the type to fight a man, but he would beat women and he was very abusive to them mentally and spiritually as well as physically. He also had a knife on him at all times while he was in jail. He would not fist fight A man. However, He would not hesitate for even one single moment to stab you to death if you crossed him.  
Anyways, he told me that whenever he saw this particular man talking to his woman in the bar, he got enraged. But he did not do anything about it immediately. He waited an entire month until He had the perfect opportunity to exact revenge on this person. During the course of of this time, he had a girl from the neighborhood, get a piece of his hair from his pillow and deliver it to him for $20.  
One night, he got the perfect opportunity. The opportunity he had been waiting so patiently for. he told me that he was riding around one night, exactly about a month after the incident. He was riding around town after leaving the bar and he saw that man walking home. He said it was about 1 o’clock in the morning, so he pulled over and asked the man if he needed a ride. The man was cautious at first, he told me, but agreed to except the ride. He got Inside of the vehicle and said hello, then he asked Wilmore, the killer, if he was mad at him for talking to his girlfriend because he heard from the girlfriend that Wilmore wanted to hurt him. Wilmore assured him that everything was OK and that he did not take it personal.

Anyways, he asked him if he would like to go get some whiskey. The man said sure, so Wilmore went and bought A big bottle of whiskey and they proceeded to ride around on dirt roads out here in the country getting drunk. That man drank and drank and drank. They played the radio and had a great time. acdept, Wilmore was only pretending to drink. He proceeded to get the man drunker and drunker until he couldn’t walk.

That’s when he pulled over out in the country and told the man that he needed to urinate. The man said he had to as well so when the man got out of the vehicle, Wilmore grabbed a 2 x 4 out of the backseat, crept up behind the man, and bashed his skull with it.

as he’s explaining this to me, all I can do is listen in horror. I cannot believe my ears. This man is confessing a whole homicide to me in the most intimate detail, I got chills all over my body. I could not believe that I was listening to something that too much resembled to be something like a horror movie to me.

He told me that he hit the man so hard with that board that it knocked him out instantly. Then he told me he bashed the man’s head at least 25 times after he was dead. He threw the board in the trunk of his vehicle and grabbed a hammer and proceeded to bust this man teeth out of his head, one by one with a hammer. Then he shaved all of the man’s hair off of his head, including his beard and eyebrows and put it in a bag. Then he reached down and grab the man by the legs and drug him off into a cow pasture in the middle of the country and left him there.

I was in shock. Utter Disbelief. I almost didn’t even feel real. I felt like I was in a dream hearing this. But I listened intently. People will tell you everything you want to know about them plus more if you could only just close your mouth and open your ears. Most people do not have this ability, but it is a gift that I have been given, in this current situation, it seemed to be a curse, though.

Anyways, This man’s family was looking for him. I was a tattoo artist at the time this happened. I remember it. I was really good friends with the brother of the man who was killed. He used to come and get tattoos from me and he would cry because they could not find his brother anywhere. They looked for this man for months But to no avail.

Here’s the craziest part of all. One night, my friends mother had a dream. God came to her in the dream and told her where to find her son. Like I said, their family literally for search parties with hundreds of people to look for this man and could not find him anywhere anywhere.

Anyways, my friends mom said that God came to her in this dream and told her that her son was in the back of a cow pasture in possum bend. Way out in the middle of nowhere. She got out of a dead sleep, called her entire family and told them to be waiting outside. She drove by their houses one by one and picked them up in a minivan and drove them out to the exact location that God showed her in the dream. he was right there at the tree in the back pasture almost nothing left to his remains. When I say that he beat this man’s skull flat, it’s an understatement. As I said before, I was truly disturbed when I heard this. It still haunts me at night even. He told me about a few other murders that he did that he never got caught for. They are truly disturbing. his final victim, a woman and her baby were burned alive in a trailer.

That’s not the disturbing part though. The woman had been dead a week before she was set on fire, and he actually positioned her sitting upright in his car with the seatbelt on, as he drove around town so they could be seen together as if she was still alive. He was a master at manipulation and confusing times, dates, and locations of the murders he committed. He was also an expert at manipulating evidence and disposing of it perfectly in order to conceal his crimes.

I spent hundreds of hours alone in a dark cell with this creepy psychopath. I’d love to share the details, if anyone is interested in listening. He is still alive and in prison somewhere here in Alabama. he was actually given life without parole after being held in the same jail I was in for almost 4 years. I have most interesting experience to share. During the daytime, we would be released from the cell to move freely throughout the day room, watching TV and taking showers. But at 8 PM each night they would lock both of us in a two-man cell and the door would not be reopened until 8 AM. During this time, we had a lot of free time to talk and it was always dark in the cell at night. The details of some of the crimes he committed are so horrifying and the details are so disturbing that I have to use a nightlight and take sleeping medication in order for me get to sleep, even to this very day.

below is a link with all of the information, including a photo of the man responsible for the crimes that were committed in this story. Unfortunately, this is not fictitious but an actual true story. ttps://www.wsfa.com/story/27391620/man-indicted-in-death-of-girlfriend-found-in-burned-house/
