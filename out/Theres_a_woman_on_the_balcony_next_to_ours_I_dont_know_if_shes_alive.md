Hi everyone,  
I don’t usually post, but this has been weighing on me for a while now, and I can’t stop thinking about it. My wife says I should just forget about it, but I can’t shake the feeling that something’s *off*. Not just strange — *wrong*. I don’t know what I’m hoping for. Maybe just a second opinion. Maybe someone’s seen something like this before.

My wife and I moved into a small apartment in Munich in early 2023. It’s a quiet place — not too far from the center, a little old, but it has a balcony, which we’ve come to love. We go out there every evening to smoke and unwind, no matter how cold it gets. The view’s nothing special, just other buildings and balconies, but one of those balconies has been bothering me since the day we moved in.

To the left of our balcony — almost perpendicular, forming an L shape — is another balcony. It belongs to a unit where an old woman lives. We’ve seen her a few times, which is how we know it’s just her — we’ve never seen anyone else there. But here’s the strange part:

**Her apartment is always dark. Always.**  
I mean *pitch* black.  
We’ve lived here over a year now. We’re on the balcony almost every evening, and I have *never* seen a light on in her apartment. Not once. Not a flicker. Not a hallway light, not a reading lamp, nothing. Day or night, rain or shine — her windows are like black mirrors.

We see her sometimes. Some weeks, we don’t see her at all. Then she’ll appear on her balcony again like nothing happened. She never really looks at us. Sometimes she responds to a “hello” with a faint, almost... off-smile. Most of the time she doesn’t react at all. But what really gets me is *what she does when she’s out there*.

She leans over her railing — far, *dangerously* far — and cranes her neck to look at the balcony next to hers. Not at the sky, not down into the street — *the balcony itself*. She bends out so far it looks like she’s about to tip over. Sometimes she stays like that for minutes. Not moving. Just staring. I’ve seen her do it multiple times now. It’s always the same: the angle, the stillness, the way her hands grip the rail too tight.

My wife swears she’s seen her standing close to *our* balcony door once, late at night. Just standing there. Not knocking. Not moving. Not even looking in. Just... *there*. We didn’t hear her come out. We didn’t hear her go back in. She was just there one moment and gone the next.

We’ve asked the landlord about her. He just shrugged and said, “She’s been there a long time. Quiet. Keeps to herself.”

I’ve looked at that balcony every night since. Some nights, nothing. Other nights, she’s there again — back in her usual position, leaning over just a bit too far, staring into someone else’s world like she’s trying to remember it.

I don’t know who she is. I don’t know if she’s even really... *living* there.  
But whatever she is, I can’t shake the feeling that she’s not watching *them*.  
She’s watching us.  
And maybe she always has been.

Let me know what you think. Am I losing it, or does this sound as weird to you as it feels to me?
