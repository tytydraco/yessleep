“Hey man, don’t talk about that.” Jason shoots me a nervous glance.

“What? I overheard Mr. Garrison in his office talking about feeding something in the cabinet. The fuck’s that about?”

He clasps his hand on my mouth.

“Shut. Up.”

Mr. Garrison passes by our cubicles, poking around the wall.

“How’s it hanging, fellas?”

“Oh, you know...” Jason says with sweat on his brow.

“No, I don’t know.” He says with a glare.

Jason blinks.

“I’m kidding!” He chuckles.

“You should have seen the look on your face!” He says grinning. “Now seriously, get back to work.” He says with a scowl.

After work, I track down Jason in the parking lot. He jumps when he sees me, already halfway in his car.

“C’mon man, you gotta tell me what’s going on. You know I’m new here. Is this a prank?”

“Not here. Meet me at Wendy’s,” He says, glancing around nervously, slamming his car door shut.

I look up to see the blinds in Mr. Garrisons’ office cracked, eyes peeking out.

We meet up at the restaurant, sitting in the furthest booth in the corner.

“Look man, there are some rules you gotta follow here. Actually just one, don’t ask questions. Just do your fucking job.”

“You realize how much more that makes me want to ask questions?”

“Just don’t.”

“C’mon man, this is killing me!" I groan.

“Trust me! You don’t wanna know! Just enjoy the high pay, stress-free job! If you keep asking, then stress will be the least of your worries.” He says with a mouthful of burger.

“Fine.” It was not fine. I have to know.

Late that night, I lay in bed, unable to sleep. I decide to sneak in to the office.

Flashlight clutched in my palm, I type my number on the keypad and enter the building. Honestly, I don’t know what I expected to find or why I even decided to do this. I ponder this as I ascend the elevator to the fourth floor.

The door opens up to the darkened office. Creeping past the empty cubicles, I hear rustling. Mr. Garrison’s office, of course. I creep to the door, dimming my flashlight. Hesitantly, I crack open the door. I see Mr. Garrison, hunched over a filing cabinet.

“It’s ok honey.” He whispered “Just eat.”

I can’t see inside the cabinet, so I try to get a better look. Creeping closer, I trip. My flashlight clangs on the floor and shines directly on Mr. Garrison.

He turns around, in his hand a severed head, dripping blood. Oh god, it’s Jason! I gag. 

A woman’s head protrudes out of the dresser, her eyes milky white and her teeth razor sharp. I scream and stumble backward. Then, blinding white lights shoot out of Mr. Garrison's eyes and mouth and he lets out an otherworldly roar.

I take off running, bolting out of the door, mashing that elevator door closed. I get in my car and never look back.

At dawn I go to the police, when I lead them to the office building however, it’s empty. The building looks as if it aged overnight. They say there haven't been any businesses here in the last ten years. No record of Mr. Garrison or my coworker Jason either.
