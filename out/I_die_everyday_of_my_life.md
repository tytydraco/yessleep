Have you ever experienced an instance when you for sure were supposed to die and just… didn’t? This happens to me, every single day, and I want to know if I’m not the only one.

So, it is not that uncommon for me to fall down the stairs, either the miss of a step, my ankle decides to fail, or the loss of balance and it’s a roll down. An excrutiating pain will then invade my body for a fraction of a second and before I can react, nothing. Back to before I took that step and no pain at all. The sound of broken bones and the sensation of my brain being upside down have happened so many times and yet, nothing remarkable ever happens afterwards since I immediately correct whatever was wrong.

The stairs are just one of the most common examples, but other instances have involved me forgetting to turn off the stove, unknowingly flip the light switch when I came home and my intestines blowing out right before I come back to my hand on the switch and the lights off. There are lame ones like suffocating in my sleep, and other extremes like getting ran over and what I discovered were the symptoms of a heart attack once I was able to get to the hospital on time. No one is ever around to see it, though, it would probably sound too crazy anyways.

It didn’t concern me that much until I realized the world I perceive changes up just a little bit every single time after my death. I have started to wonder if I just reappear in an alternative universe, because the feeling that something is wrong gets more overwhelmimg every single day. Let’s just say it is duller. I remember my childhood being full of energizing color and vibrations and now I’m made fun of for being “colorblind”. But I swear I’m not color blind, it’s just this weird curtain that blurs my vision, it kind of looks like a dark cloud if that even makes sense. I’ve tried from colorblind glasses, regular glasses since it also affects my vision and nothing works.

Nothing is actually there, I think, but it gets me so confused. It happens with my other senses, too, my tongue feels as if it had static in it at all times. It blocks my taste buds from feeling any food there, and even though my hands and the interior of my nose can also feel the static, they never seem to be touching anything else. I can grab things fine, smart devices aren’t even a problem except for the fact that it gets harder to see them every time, I must look like a toddler from how clumsy I’ve become.

I don’t want to seem crazy when I mention it to other people, this may be the only option, I am so scared to loose my senses, who knows what could happen if I keep dying like this. And if this happens to anyone else, have you found a way for it to stop happening? I have never seen anyone else talking about this before. Please, before it’s too late.
