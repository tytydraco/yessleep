December 12, 1776. My cross protects me, it works! How glorious this is. While I was going to get food I heard something, a rattle. I turned around and saw it, or i think I saw it, all i saw was something, a yellowish white, moving to the next the hall. I immediately ran back to my room, and it began the chase, busting through the door behind me. I refused to look back, I kept running, and would not stop.I felt the coldness of the fog creeping ever so closer as i kept running. Once I got to my room I slammed the door, and it just stopped. I think it stopped, I waited for the thing to walk away, but it never did. So I waited until the coldness couldnt be felt anymore. Once the door became warm I opened the door ever so slightly, and it was gone. So I went back to getting the supplies I ever so needed. Once I got the supplies I creeped back to my room, walking slowly, so slowly you would have thought I wasn't moving. Oh yes, the pace i was going was truly unnoticeable indeed, people would have thought i was but a statue.

December 13, 1776. I decided to go out again, in a search of more crosses, expecting the creature to be near but it isn't. I kept walking as slowly as I did the last time, but nothing came. No coldness, no rattling, no fog, no screaming, no ringing, nothing. Have I finally escaped it?

I finally got my crosses and nothing ever came, nothing. I believe it truly is gone. But now I feel empty, this deep emptiness goes through me. I fear this creature, I know it can kill me, but it seems to not want to, it seems to want to toy with me. To see how long it takes before I go insane. Not only do I feel an emptiness but I feel compelled to go to the basement. Is this demon setting up a trap? Am I going insane? Is it succeeding in what it wants? I'll think about it

December 14, 1776. I had a dream, a dream so horrid, or at least I thought it was a dream. I was waking up from my bed, turned to the door and noticed the cross was gone. I then turned the other way and saw the thing standing there staring at me. I got a much better look at it this time, it was a giant mass of black fog, with a singular, giant arm made of bones, both human and animal, some not even from this earth. Its head looked like a human skull, but it was filled with sharp teeth and the tongue of a creature I've never seen.I immediately went into a sprint out of the room. It kept teleporting in front of me until I ran into the basement, then it just shut the door. I tried to run out the door but the door was locked. With no choice I walked down the stairs, barely able to see. But then a candle lit up in front of me, So i didn't hurt myself, i picked it up and walked on, while i was walking through the basement i tripped on something and woke up immediately, i woke up to the sight of me, it was me. I wasn't moving though, I was just laying there, laying in a puddle of blood. I lifted myself up and realized I was stabbed, somebody murder me. I believe it was the demon, but the stab wound is too smooth to be from bone, it was obviously a knife. But then I looked at my corpse's hand, laying in it was a knife. I connected all the pieces and realized what happened. I murdered myself, I locked myself in the basement and murdered myself after all the past events. My deteriorating corpse has been laying in the basement, and nobody knew. But did anybody care? Would anyone?

Good bye. I've been in this basement for god knows how long, but then i was surrounded by the black fog, the creature then came out of it towards me. I stood there, prepared for it to kill me. But it didn't, instead, it reached its hand out to me, this is the end of this journal as well as the end of my life, if anyone is to find this do not share my story, keep it hidden, for i do not wish to cause paranoia for anyone and do not wish for others to realize their fate may be sealed. Bye
