For anyone who missed how this started.

I didn’t expect so many people out there would care about what’s  happening to me. I’d say it’s  humbling, but, well, my situation has been humbling me since I left the states. You guys cheering me on, and trying to help, it’s kept me going though. 

So, I figure the least I can do is keep you all updated until something prevents me from doing so. Likely in a permanent fashion. 

I'll say, the ride home was awkward, to say the least. For all of the grim predictions running through my head going to the spectacle , on the way back they were ten times worse. 

I wasn’t caged, shackled and tortured when I returned. If I said I was greeted with concern by the handful of distant relatives and lost souls I’d be over exaggerating. But there was a bit of respect and kindness . 

I was patched up, as far as being stabbed goes, apparently I got lucky. 

There was food, question free beer, and a healthy number of people asking how things went. 

All I wanted to do was sleep, but something kept me going. Kept me answering questions I’d rather not have, kept my fear fried brain making conversation and trading verbal jabs. 

A tap on my shoulder startles me, the sun is  rising  and if I don’t get to sleep soon, I’m going to fall over. 

“Your half. “ Sylvia says, it’s just shy of a thousand pounds.

“All this was for, what is this? $600 American? “ I say. 

“ Walk with me. “ Sylvia begins, I follow. 

“Money isn’t much good if I’m dead. “ I say, my tone sullen and exasperated. 

“Then don’t die. “ She replies, walking across the debris strewn scrub grass toward the farm house. 

“Do you have any shame? You  kidnapped me in the middle of the night to feed me to a couple of demons. I’m your nephew for Christ’s  sake! “ I’m not yelling, I don’t think my body is capable of that much exertion at this point, but my words are clear. 

“I’m not your aunt, Nikolas. 

Great-Great-Great grandmother, give or take a generation. It’s been a long time. 

And if I was doing, as you suggest, yes, I would feel a deep shame.” Sylvia lets the answers and questions ferment in my mind as we walk. 

“So why not tell me what’s going on? Maybe teach me some of that magic you were tossing around at the airport. “ we stop outside a sliding door. Sylvia has a genuine look of amusement on her face. 

“Magic? Nikolas, magic is what stupid people call being fooled. 

Magic is the Priest’s sermon, the fortune teller’s reading, the huckster’s pitch. 

It’s a way to create vast amounts of power from nothing. 

The world is full of things that defy the laws of nature. What I do, what those of the family with me do, is understand them. We learn, we improvise, and we adapt. 

We do not make power from nothing, we find it, and use it. “ Sylvia watches me, judging my response to her statement. 

“So that’s what you meant before. About the trappings of the gypsy. This whole vibe, it’s a smokescreen. 

Assholes expect the Gritts to be some Romani stereotype, and give you a wide berth. When strange shit happens, they chalk it up to some kind of con, or something they’ve seen in a movie. Either way, they aren’t looking for monster fights, and supernatural research. “ I know I’m in the ballpark when she pats me on the shoulder hard enough to hurt. 

“And the value of your half, is somewhere around 30 thousand. We wager in esoteric items, favors, and creatures. When you leave, I’ll make you a fair offer for what is yours. 

You’ll understand more in the morning after you have a chance to look around. “ Sylvia says before showing me a sparse, but clean, and comfortable room. 

I wake up in the early afternoon, something, beyond the obvious nagging at me. 

After a cup of nearly caustic tea, I finally realized what it was. 

Sylvia, she told me a lot last night. But many of my questions were avoided. I know about her, and this place, but my fate, beyond another round of tug of war between two nightmares, is unknown. 

That being said, my second conclusion, is that I need to start rolling with the punches. I’ve tried calling the police (they  asked how Sylvia was doing before I said my name.), my parents, anyone, and like it or not, for one unsaid reason or another, I’m stuck here. 

I’m going to skip a lot of introductions. Reading me introducing myself, 50 times and trying not to be awkward around folks that seem way too okay with me dying,  probably wouldn’t be the best use of your time. 

As I explore the grounds, I enter one of a handful of old barns. The inside has peg board walls hung with tools spanning the spectrum from mundane to esoteric enough I have no idea what they are. 

Inside, among benches strewn with a random assortment of objects, and equipment, stand two men. 

The first is Colin, he’s pale as a ghost, eyes bloodshot and sleep deprived, he wears an Aerosmith shirt, and toolbelt that is making his pants lose a battle with gravity. The 40 something is holding an electrode connected to a thick, black wire directly patched into the main breaker. 

The second, Dafyd is a short, olive skinned man in his mid fifties. His outfit consists of a tweed jacket, blue jeans and plain white shirt. 

Between them on a grounded workbench sits a small snow globe, within stands a faded ballerina, one arm lost, floating randomly through the liquid. 

My teeth ache as the breaker begins to make a dangerous humming noise. For a couple of seconds, a short blue spark arcs from the electrode to the snow globe. 

The air smells of ozone to the point where I’m convinced I’ve burned out my nose hairs. The two men argue a bit between themselves in a language I’ve heard but never learned to speak. Then turn as they notice me. 

“Nik, come settle an argument between your uncle and I. “ Dafyd says. 

“Don’t know how much help I’m going to be, but I’ll do my best. “ I say, walking up. 

“The kid has no idea what’s going on Dafyd. “ Colin says. 

“I know, but we’re not looking for an expert opinion. 

Nik, what year is it? “ Dafyd asks. 

“1993.” I say without hesitation, “ What the hell? “ I add.  My brain is a bit fried, but not enough to screw up the date by 30 something years. 

“God damn it. “ Colin says. 

“I knew it! “ exclaims Dafyd. 

“This piece of shit is getting binned. 

You look confused kid. 

It’s called a gimmick. It’s the stuff side of what we deal in. Some of it,  it’s two steps off of a horror novel. Most of it though, it’s just strange. 
 
Figuring them out is 95% engineering and 5% esoterica. 

They teaching you anything across the pond? “ Colin asks. 

The question leads to a conversation, the conversation leads to a week of me shadowing the two finicky, strange guys. 

I’d go into  more detail, but as the days go by, things seem more and more like spending time with some out there branches in the family tree. As terrifying as everything has been, as terrifying as it is, it’s, interesting. 

But I wouldn’t be writing if things were sunshine and roses though, would I? 

One day, after working with objects that scared, confused and frustrated me in equal measure, I realized there was something I was avoiding. 

So I found myself standing in front of Augustus, the creature held upright and immobile in it’s coffin-like cage. The Plexiglas window is cracked. 

It's worse than I thought it would be. Every time I look at the thing’s face I see the blood it made me spill. I see the power it wields, and the murderous intent in it’s twisted pit of a mind. 

But sometime soon, I’m going to be next to it again. I have to be able to keep myself together. I have to understand this thing as much as I can. 

“Hey killer, how the fuck  ya Doin? “ Augustus taunts. Shame reddens my fear paled face. 

“Can we talk? “ I say, I want it to be a demand, it comes out as a whimper. 

“What do we have to talk about, bud? What about this are you not picking up on yet? “ Augustus is smug, confident even while confined. 

“How you seem to have this limitless ego, when you're being held by literally the oldest woman possible. “ I’m too scared to say this above a whisper.

“That dusty old wizard’s sleeve out there? She’ll fucking get hers. 

Lucky bitch on a lucky day is all that was. 

But luck runs out, and when it does,  I’m gonna uproot your entire sad little family tree. “ Augustus threatens. 

I actually take a step backward, and almost turn. The fear this thing causes, it’s more than the knowledge of what it can do, it’s a force in and of itself. 

“Augustus, why not hear me out? “ I plead. 

“Because kid, that’s not how this story goes. 

I’ve got nothing but time, I’ll be around till the heat death of the fucking universe. 

I don’t need to hear things like you out, I don’t need to bargain. No matter how airtight your inbred little clan thinks these bonds are, eventually, someone always makes a mistake. Something small, like a wrong angle on a rune. 

Or…, “ as the thing talks, the door to the coffin like cage holding it starts to slowly swing outward, “ Something big, like forgetting to set the fucking padlock. “

I’m already running as he talks, but he’s standing in front of the exit before I can take a step. 

He looms in front of the door, coat spreading, seemingly of it’s own accord, making the patchwork killer seem like some kind of twisted manta ray. 

He locks eyes with me, I’m frozen, gripped in terror so intense I have no idea if it’s mundane or the  aura of fear Augustus projects. 

Those mismatched orbs burrow into me, I feel like this thing can see into my soul. 

He inhales for an impossibly long time, a slick, menacing grin spreading across his leathery face. 

“Yeah, today’s the day kid.” He says, a kick sending me across the floor like a smooth rock across the surface of a pond. 

I’ve never felt pain like this, I try to stand, but my knee refuses to bend. I hit the ground and my ribs scream, I’m sure at least one was broken in the tumble. 

I hear Augustus’ footsteps, my struggles to get to my feet are useless. Seconds in, i’m in literal crippling pain. 

He grabs me by the throat, taking his time as he raises me above his head. 

The look of joy on his face as I choke and struggle to breathe twists his features, for a moment he appears nearly snakelike. 

He holds the tips of his claw-like nails against my stomach. Then draws his arm back. 

“Don’t worry bud, I’m not just going to tear out your heart, everyone does that shit. 

This isn’t going to be a sprint, it’s a fucking marathon. I just want to aerate the track a little bit before we start. “ His hand blurs and I close my eyes hoping I don’t last very long. 

“Stop” I hear a deep, smooth, male voice say. 

I hit the ground, and try to see who just stopped the beginning of my execution, but the pain, the cracked ribs, pulled muscles and long ragged scrapes have me seeing spots. 

When my vision clears, I see a tall, blond man with impossibly angular features, dressed in an immaculate black and mauve suit. 

His eyes try to look kind, but there is something wrong behind them. Something waiting to be let out. 

“Who are you? “ I say, one lip, split and torn. 

“You can call me Art. Arthur Deus if you feel like being formal. 

But what you want to know, is why I’m here. 

Well Nikolas, to simplify things, think of me as the older brother of the leering terror your ‘aunt’ has trapped here. “ As Arthur talks, I notice something, the motes of dust in the air are hanging  still. 

“I have no problems with you taking him. I haven’t seen you, I don’t know your name. Couldn’t stop you if I wanted to. “ I ramble. 

Arthur holds up a finger, I go silent. 

“If  only it were that easy. 

See Nikolas, your aunt and I, have quite the history. And as much as it pains me to admit it, she’s a crafty one, and has the means to make things very difficult for me. 

Sylvia cannot know I’m involved, this is why I have an offer for you. “  As art says this, he waves a hand, almost dismissively. 

Like a switch being flipped my pain stops, I watch as my wounds begin to seal and fade, amazed. 

“What is it? “ I say. The words feel like they have weight. 

“Sylvia is looking for someone to take over for her. As old as she is, she’s not immortal. 

You’re her third attempt. 

I’m not going to lie to you and say I care about what’s happening to the humans involved in this grim little spectacle. But I care about my family, and to a lesser extent, those like myself. 

This bloodsport that your aunt is a part of, it’s vile. It’s world spanning, and it’s for nothing more than greed and bragging rights. 

I want to change this. And I would like you to help me. “ Art’s tone is slick and confident. 

“If I do, then you get him to back off? “ I say, pointing to Augustus. 

Art looks dismayed for a moment. 

“That’s not something I can really promise Nikolas. If anything could force him to listen to reason, he wouldn’t be in this situation in the first place. “ My heart sinks as Art says this. 

“Fuck off Art. “ Augustus says. 

Arthur rolls his eyes. They seem to go just a little too far back. 

“But what I can do, is have a conversation with him, impress upon him how important it is he works with you. “ Art pats me on the shoulder before turning toward his sibling. His hand is impossibly hot. 

“This kid dies, that is not my fault. You’ve seen this shit, he’s not built for it, just bust me out of here. “ Augustus isn’t far off of pleading in his tone. 

“You know that’s not possible. I cannot let Sylvia know I’m here. But given time, I will have you out. “ Art assures. 

“Fact remains, this kid gets on the wrong side of a blade or a fuckin, werewolf or something, that’s not on me. 

Even if he manages to keep his lungs in his chest, look at him. His mind is cracking, he’s either insane or God-damned, catatonic in two months. “ Now Augustus sounds like a cocky piece of shit again. 

“Of course, if he dies, or succumbs mentally, that’s not on you. 

But I want you, to make  a promise to  me. I want you to understand that this child cannot be harmed by your hand. “ It sounds like Art is talking to a five year old.

Augustus shrugs before replying. 

“The fuck you want me to say? You know me, you know I can’t say I’m not hurting this kid. And I sure as hell am not making a promise about it so you can get you-know-who involved when nature takes it’s course. 

Fuck this kid, get me out of here.” 

Arthur sighs and turns from Augustus , walking to me. 

“Nikolas, I have something to tell you. “ He says, there’s a gravity to his tone that clearly makes Augustus uncomfortable. 

“Art, what are you doing? “ The Trenchcoat wearing creature asks. 

Art kneels bringing himself eye to eye with me. 

“Don’t do this. “ Augustus says. 

“Then promise. “ Art replies, a few seconds of silence go by, “ As you can see, I cannot guarantee your safety Nikolas. 

But, for his own good, I want to tell you a word, one that will make my myopic brother look at things a little differently, if the need arises. 

I’d use it sparingly, it’s not meant for those like yourself. It will have a physical, mental and spiritual toll. But it might spare you the worst of his excesses. “ 

That word was the last thing Arthur said to me. With a staggering, disorienting lurch, time began to move forward. 

It kept moving forward for the next month. 

I learned a lot over that time, but, not what you might expect. 

As it turns out, there is a hell of a lot more engineering, physics, and chemistry involved in working with the supernatural than, summoning circles and newt eyes. 

But eventually, the day I was dreading came. 

The venue was a strip club of all places, a massive building, on the outskirts of Norwich, gaudy neon lights illuminate a place that, unlike the theme restaurant,  seems to be in active use. 

There was a different ambiance this time. The folks milling around the rune etched Lucite box seemed more sedate, and a hell of a lot richer. 

The lighting was professional, driving music sets a professional sports tone. 

This time I walk in the cage of my own accord. It’s not pride, or bravery, but simply knowing, I have no choice. 

The roar of the crowd stokes my fear as Augustus slowly opens the door of his coffin-like vessel. 

He loves the attention, his grin both horrifying and genuine. 

“Guess we’re in the big leagues now, eh, killer? “ Augustus prods. 

I’m sweating. I’ve cut a little weight over the past month, unintentionally,  but as  I wonder what horror is going to come walking in the other side of this cage. I don’t think being in marginally better shape and having a working knowledge of basic engineering is going to do me a lot of good. 

Suddenly the crowd is silent, lights illuminate a spot at the far end of the massive Lucite box. 

She’s small, slight, and has grey, lifeless skin. Her eyes are massive, her body beautiful, but exaggerated  to the point of looking cartoonish. She’s not wearing much, a small t-shirt and what I’ll generously call a bikini bottom. 

Beside her is a massive, brick slab of a man, late twenties or early thirties. His eyes are wild,  he’s covered in layers of scars, and burns. He wears an old, worn prison uniform that’s never seen a washing machine. 

He matches her strange, boneless stride, with a loping wolf-like gait. 

“Entering the ring, you know her, you love her. She’s the Vixen of the void, The Nymph of nothing, Norwich’s own, ‘Sweet’ Francis Anne! 

And at her side, brought in at great expense from the land of Twinkies, cheeseburgers and weak beer, The Corps Killer, the Military Mangler, with 24 out of ring kills and 36 in, ‘Big’ Billy Speck! “ an announcer screams.  

The crowd bursts into life,  noise shakes the walls of the cage. 

“And, on the other side, I don’t know, some wanker in a Trenchcoat, and a kid that isn’t even old enough to be here. Let’s watch them die. “ He finishes. 

Augustus looks enraged, his teeth chatter, he flexes his clawed hands. I walk in his shadow as he advances to face the creature and her second. 

“I know you! “ The grey skinned thing says, her voice high pitched. As she speaks I notice what appears to be a thick scar bisecting her from forehead to stomach. 

“Never heard of you. Neither will anyone else after this. “ Augustus says with a grin. 

“You’re the runt of the litter right? Royal blood but peasant flesh, that’s what they say, no? “ Francis says, she grins a toothless smile. The inside of her mouth, a black void. 

“Fuck my family.  What I am is as good as meat gets. I give myself power, all you have is a cosmic std.  “ Augustus stares Francis down as he talks. 

Francis reacts with nothing more than a coy look. Bill stares down at me, the handle of some large blade sticking out of his right pocket, and a short length of chain wrapped around his left forearm. 

A buzzer cuts through the roar of the crowd, the world seems to consist of nothing more than myself and the horrors around me as the timer begins to count down. 

Like a flash Augustus leaps at Francis, but her body stretches and contorts as she moves, he never gets close. 

I tear myself away from the clash of unnatural creatures as I look to the mutilated killer in front of me. 

I didn’t come in unarmed, but I also was expecting another kid. And wanted to avoid what happened last time if at all possible. My heart races as I pull the small black can from the pocket of my worn, grey hoodie. 

For a second I feel like a badass. I’ve got the can of mace aimed and spraying before Bill can react. 

Four seconds tick by before the can is empty, Bill is soaked in thick yellow liquid, it runs down his face like tears.  

The psycho doesn’t  even blink. 

“You good? “ he asks before slapping my outstretched arm aside and shattering my nose with a backhanded blow that seemed almost an afterthought. 

Augustus screams in frustration, moving faster than I can track, but not able to put a scratch on the amorphous, rubbery woman. 

Bill uncoils the chain, and I feel a sudden deep, crushing pain in my chest. I stumble backward, coughing. He laughs and whips the chain out again, I manage to see the next blow, but have no way of stopping it. 

He manages to hit the same spot, the pain is overwhelming, my lungs feel bruised, I can’t breathe. 

Francis seems to have grown bored avoiding Augustus, he pants, sucking wind as she stands in front of him. 

That scar splits, not fully, but from forehead to the bridge of her nose. What’s behind it, is nothing. 

I mean that in terms so literal, I can’t describe how it looked. It was more of a feeling that a sight. Looking into it, made me understand just how empty something can actually be. 

Pieces of Augustus’ skin and flesh begin to, simply not exist. His look of confusion lasts for about a second before he’s sent sailing through the air by a long, whip-like arm. 

The trenchcoat clad creature  extracts himself from a tangled mess of tables, chairs and debris. Francis and Bill laugh, mocking us. 

“Let’s trade dance partners” Augustus says, his two handed shove launching my broken body into Francis. 

She catches me, her body absorbing the impact. 

Fear is making me  hyperventilate, physical trauma is turning that into a wheezing pant that feels like being waterboarded. 

Francis looks down at me, violence and seduction in her eyes. 

“Make things easy for me and I’ll let you go out with a bang. “ She says, the look of carnal violence on her face makes me gag. 

Augustus struggles with Bill, the creatures wounds many and severe. 

A minute remains, but I don’t know if I can last another ten seconds. 

Francis stretches one arm into a thin tendril, it begins to circle me, caging me into a progressively smaller area. 

“I’m sixteen, you paranormal nonce. “ I blurt out, the pain from my broken nose almost making me pass out, “ That’s the word they use around here, right? For the kind of creep that gets supernatural powers to hit on a kid? “

I can’t run, I can’t fight, all I can do is try to distract this thing for another 42 seconds. 

Her face begins to turn, shifting and warping into something resembling a cattle skull more than a person. 

The wet snapping noise distracts both Francis and myself. 

Augustus has his hand buried in the chest of the convict, he holds the man aloft for a moment. 

Augustus says something in a language I can’t even guess at, and with one fluid motion tears the black, decayed heart from his own chest and replaces it with that of the killer. 

He begins to scream, then laugh, wounds spraying ichor, he seems to swell, his face a mask of pleasure and Ill intent. 

“Death machine just needed a new engine. “ Augustus says with a cackle. 

Francis forgets about me and lashes out, quite literally, at Augustus. Limbs becoming a frenzied blur of snaking flesh, , destroying anything they so much as graze. 

He wades into the storm, flirting around the edges of the cage, making her chase him with the lethal limbs. 

The conflict is a blur, but at the 23 second mark I see it. As much as I hate the prick, I’m almost impressed. 

She’s tangled, somewhere among the bent stripper poles, and doorways to private booths, She’s caught herself. 

Augustus takes his time now, her body is stretched thin, looped around door handles and under stages. 

Ten seconds left, Augustus is feet from her writhing, blob-like form. Her features pulled taught enough to be nearly non-existent. 

“Takes a lot to open yourself up doesn’t it? “ Augustus says, kneeling, he holds the killer’s knife in one hand, “ Why don’t I do it for you? “ 

The blade is barely touching her flesh as the timer ends. 

“Fuck’s sake! “ Augustus says, standing, and letting the knife fall to the floor. 

Something about the way he walks to one end of the Lucite cage worries me. 

“Nobody likes a draw, but as far as they go, that was one hell of a kiss to your sister, wasn’t it folks? 

No one is defeating our lovely lady of legend, but let’s hear it for the man who tried… Trenchcoat! “ The announcer screams over the loudspeaker. 

The crowd is on their feet, bets are being paid out, and two groups of people are trying to open doors conveniently barred by flesh no person is going to get through. 

I jog up to him, my body screaming at me every step of the way. He taps along one clear wall. 

“Cheap runes. “ Augustus says, before driving his fist like a spear through the Lucite. 

The hole he makes is about the size of a watermelon, his hand easily going through all six inches of the wall. 

But it’s not big enough to accommodate the body of the poor twenty something he drags through. 

In an instant the man is flensed, his small bones broken, eyes, ears and jaw, nothing more than a smear. 

But he’s still alive, wailing a haunting death bellow as he struggles to understand what just happened. 

“Stop! “ I scream, horrified. Blood sprays from my ruined nose, “You think I won’t say it? “

Augustus slowly cocks his head, punching his fist through the wall again, and tossing another victim beside the first. 

“In front of your family, and that aunt of yours? You think this is bad? The shit she’ll do to you if she knows you even looked at my Dangerous Brothers looking prick of a brother will make this look like a massage.” Trenchcoat pauses, letting the reality sink in, letting my absolute lack of power envelop me like a blanket, “ You want me to stop? I’ll give you something no one else has, a choice. 

Either finish one of these pieces of meat off, or, have a taste. “

He brings his hand back for another strike, and I make my choice. 

No, I’m not telling you which one. I can share a lot of things with you guys. But, I’m sorry, how I picked to save the rest of the people in that place is a shame I’m going to carry on my own. 

Don’t know if any of you will want to hear from me again, after knowing what I’ve had to do, who I’ve had to deal with, but I’m going to keep posting. This is getting nothing but worse, and maybe, I can save someone else the same fate. 



Looks like things got worse
