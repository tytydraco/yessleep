Hi I'm David or Dave for short, now I'm not sure where to start with this, but there's something going on with this neighborhood the cabin on my block to be particular. Moving cities I drove past a Shabby two-story cabin which looked to be abandoned. I found it weird as we were in a city and this was on my block but I thought it'd be fun to check out. I'm in my twenties and a very curious guy so, with something like that on my block I got really excited. That was a mistake, on the day that I moved into my new house a neighbor stopped by hours later.

 Handing me a crinkled up, water damaged picture of the cabin. Raising my eyebrow I asked what this was about especially considering how old the piece of paper looked. The older man asked if he could step in. His eyebrows were bushy and gray his hair being long and curly but bald at the top with slight remnants of the Auburn hair he must have had when he was younger. Introducing himself he said "hello my name is Robert, I live across the street I have something very important to tell you."
Being curious I asked him to cut to the chase to which he told me "there's a woman who lives in that cabin, black hair. If she knocks on your door especially if she's screaming and crying do not open the door, ignore it she is not what she seems." 

At first I thought he was joking pulling some sick prank but oh was I ever wrong. Before I could ask any further he took the picture from my hands before leaving. Finding it very strange I figured he must just be some bored old guy trying to pull pranks on the youngings. Spending the rest of my day unpacking it hit about 11:00 p.m. before I knew it. Having College in the morning I decided it would be responsible if I went to bed now. As I was getting ready for bed I heard a knock and some sobbing, looking out the peep hole I saw a girl with long black silky hair a brown baggy oversized hoodie, and some skinny jeans.

 Figuring it was a part of the old mans prank I yelled "I got to get up for college, don't you dare disturb me" to what she started banging on the door sobbing loudly and screaming for help. At that point I thought it was best if I called the police. Quickly I snapped the photo of the girl through the peep hole. Going to my camera roll I seen that it was blurry so I tried to take another photo but all of them seemed to come out blurry. That's when I realized the old man was right, quickly I scurried away from the door eyes widened in Terror. I am now writing all of this but I'm not sure what's to come next so I'll keep you updated.
