The world did not listen to our voices when we sat in the streets, waited on doorsteps, and stood on the rooftops. They called us a cult, a delusional few. But it was not us that threw ourselves from the buildings when the Great Dying began.

"Save yourselves," We cried, "Look not at the sky!"

It was the clouds, really. Those insidious puffs of white water vapor in the sky. They looked down menacingly at us, envying our lives and all our sin.

We soon moved to the countryside where tall structures were naught. But even there those cumulonimbus bastards lay watching.

Sissy was the first to go. She had glimpsed them through a crack in the blinds. She leapt off our roof and broke her neck. It took her two days to die.

That night father waited for the black of the new moon to bathe us in its darkness and he ushered us to the basement. Above our home burned. Never again would we be permitted to live above ground.

Not that it mattered much, Micah was next. His blindfold slipped off as he was watering the garden. Our food stores had run dry so we had to live as our ancestors did long ago. He climbed a tree and leapt off. His body was skewered by the fence that surrounded our small compound. His cries lasted for hours as father stood by the barred door with his gun in hand.

That's when it began, the Calling. We knew the clouds were water in the sky, and even with the cunning that comes with such nefarious creatures we thought we could escape their influence. But we forgot about the rain. Rain was just cloud that fell to the ground.

"Join us, join us," the voices called. Perfect imitations of Sissy and Micah. Of my friends from school before my mother ushered me out of those halls that fateful autumn day. Of our neighbors that looked disapprovingly at my parents who drove us away.

It was too much for mother. Father had thought that the damned gaseous beasts could only kill by height. He crushed the bullets from the gun as I cleaned mother's brain off the ceiling.

"It's wonderful here," Mother called from the other side of the door when the pitter patter came the next morning.

I should have known father was lost when he demanded we return to the city. He promised we would both wrap our heads so the clouds would not see. I kept my eyes on the ground but I could have sworn that father glanced upward when he thought I wasn't looking.

The bodies had rotted away by then. Mountains of bones littered the roads, the decayed flesh picked clean by vultures and other carrion birds. In that wasteland where only father and I stood we saw it, the tower, a monument to our hubris. Father knew what must be done.

"We will fight," Father said in his gruff voice. Fight for humanity, fight for freedom. But he was lost by now, deluded by the voices, his mind unraveled. He was still explaining his scheme when I pushed him through the glass pane. He didn't even spare me a glance as he plummeted to the ground. I don't mind though, his gravelly rasp joined the chorus soon enough.

I am at the summit of the tower but alas I am never alone. On auspicious days like these the clouds descend and I'm surrounded by my family once more. In fact, if I listen hard enough I can parse apart all the voices of the rest of humanity. They call to me in their tongues, in their voices:

"Join us! Join us!"

I stumble across the cement roof and land next to the parapet. My loved ones grasp my shoulders and lift me up. Steadily, unsteadily, my shoes hang off the edge.

"Mother, father!" I screamed at the clouds.

"Sissy," I mumbled to myself.

"I come to join you with arms open wide!"

My foot slips into the air and my body plummets. A cascade of tears blur my vision. The wind rushes through my shaggy hair and beard as I turn to look at the yawning abyss above.

Not a cloud in sight.
