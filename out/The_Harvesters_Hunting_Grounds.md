[We](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c2p1bb/that_time_our_geometry_teacher_sent_our_class_to/?share_id=vm3IeyQ8aznEF5PG85zPT&utm_content=1&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) entered the forest of giant bioluminescent fungus, calling for Bia. The path was narrow and muddy, and the air was filled with spores. The smell was sickening, and it took some time for me to get used to it. The more we ventured into the forest, the more we realized we were probably not in our world anymore. We persisted, even if the fear was becoming more and more palpable. 

“Do you hear this noise?” Popcorn asked.

“Which noise?”

“Pay attention… It’s very low.” He hushed. I tried to focus on it. And then I heard it. It was a very low humming noise. Didn’t seem to be coming from a human being. 

“Yes. I hear it.”

“Do you think we should follow it?”

“No… It could be dangerous. We don’t know what type of animal roams in this jungle… Let’s take ways that avoid whatever it is.” 

This choice made our travel longer, but I still think it was the safest one. After around one hour of walking, we found a small river. Knowing rivers always lead to civilization, we decided to follow it. After some thirty minutes more, we came upon what looked like a small house constructed inside one of the giant fungus. It had a chimney, and there was a thick smoke coming out of it.

“Finally! Maybe we can finally find a way to get back home.” Popcorn said, going towards the house’s door.

“Just be cautious. We don’t know who this house belongs to.” 

Popcorn knocked on the door, and a few seconds after, someone unlocked it and opened it up just a bit. We saw the face of an old man with an overgrown white beard, his face full of wrinkles, and his eyes just bright white, with no irises or cornea. We immediately stepped back after seeing his eyes, and Popcorn started trembling. 

“Oh… It’s been so long since I’ve seen the living…” He said, in a very slow and weak pace. 

“W-what d-do you me-mean?” Popcorn stuttered. The old man smiled, revealing a mouth completely devoid of teeth.

“I mean what I mean, living boy... I am dead... Have been for a while…” He said. He opened his door and gestured for us to enter. “You are lost, are you not?… Come in… I’ll explain it all to you… The Harvester preys in these parts…” 

“N-no… W-we’re f-fine, re-really!” He answered. I was too afraid to speak, but he was speaking for me too. 

“Well… Suit yourselves…” The old man said as he closed his door. 

“Did you see his eyes?” Popcorn asked. “He looked like…”

“I think we better get moving. We need to find Bia. We’ll have time to think about what he was or not later.” 

We followed the course of the river again. As sickening as the smell of the fungal forest was, I was beginning to get used to it. Maybe it wasn’t dangerous after all, we only had seen weird insects until that point. But that wasn’t going to last. We heard once again that strange humming. Only this time it seemed much closer, and approaching us rapidly. This time, there was no avoiding the strange noise. We ran away as fast as our legs could carry us, and we could hear the humming getting ever louder, and then fast footsteps following us. 

However, our escape was very disorganized, and we ended up stumbling into each other and falling to the floor. Due to our speed, we ended up rolling and falling in a small brae. Whatever was chasing us probably didn’t see our pathetic fall. We heard the footsteps following on the direction we would go had we not fallen. I managed to take a quick look. It looked like a three meter tall, skinny, impossibly pale, and slightly curved man. It had a pointy straw hat, was completely shirtless, and was wearing ragged pants. On it’s hands, it carried a long and rusty scythe. I wasn’t able to see his face very well, but it looked way to pointy to be human. We were there, laying down in the mud for a few minutes. As soon as the humming noise ceased completely, I looked at Popcorn.

“Are you okay?” I asked. He nodded, but I could see he was terrified. Truth be told, I was also terrified, but in that moment, I felt like I was somehow responsible for protecting him. I helped him pick himself up. He had a scratch in his arm, but was otherwise 100% okay. 

“Hey! Popcorn! Vicente!” We heard a familiar voice coming from the wilderness. It was Oregano, running towards us, accompanied by Thiago and Juliana. “What are you losers up to?” Oregano asked when he came close to us. Juliana seemed distressed, but Thiago and Oregano were faking an air of masculinity. Probably they were as terrified as we were, but we’re trying to impress her. 

“We don’t want any trouble, Rogério. We are just looking for Bia. This place is not safe.” I said.

“Are you kidding? This isn’t school, I’m not here to mess with you today. Even if you are losers, we better stick together until we find a way out.” 

“I don’t trust any of you.” I said.

“Yeah, you always treated us like shit.” Popcorn said. 

“Come on man. Bia is great with math. Maybe she can do that weird thing with the pentagon and send us back home.” He pleaded. I had never seen Oregano being humble before. The situation was really desperate. 

“What? Are you that stupid? Do you really think she can do that magic… Ouch!” I stepped over Popcorn’s toes before he finished. 

“What Lúcio means is that we don’t know if she has done these weird mathematics before, but we’re sure she can probably learn.” I said, before whispering to him: “What are you doing? Even if they are assholes, they’re strong! Maybe they can fight whatever that thing was.” Popcorn looked at me like he doubted that statement. Truth be told, I also doubted it, but beggars can’t be choosers.  

Forced by destiny to be united with our bullies, we proceeded through the fungal forest. I wasn’t very used to physical activity, and neither was Popcorn, so we were already tired of walking. Thiago, Oregano and Juliana, who all had fit bodies, seemed to be still okay, but not completely full of stamina too. My main preoccupation was that if we ran into the Harvester again, we would not be able to run like we did before.

“Have you noticed the stars are not moving?” Juliana said, breaking the silence. 

“What do you mean?” Rogério asked.

“Astronomy is her hobby. Didn’t you know?” Thiago chuckled. 

“No. I didn’t. You never told me.” Oregano complained.

“Yes, I did. It’s not my fault you are always too stuck up your ass to pay attention to what I say.” Juliana replied.

“What do you mean with the stars not moving?” I asked, before they completely forgot she said it in the first place.

“You know, when the sun rises and sets, and the moon rises and sets, it’s actually our planet moving and everything-“ Oregano interrupted her.

“LAMEEEE” He laughed. Juliana ignored him and kept talking.

“But the stars are not moving at all. There’s no moon in the sky today, but the stars seem to be completely still. This means we are either in a really big planet or we are in a flat planet or dimension.” She said.

“Maybe the rules here are not like in our world.” Popcorn theorized. 

Suddenly, I heard the humming again. Not close yet, but I knew it was a matter of time. I signaled for everyone to stop.

“Can you hear this noise?” I asked. Popcorn face turned pale, but the others seemed confused. “We need to avoid the direction from where it’s coming. We stumbled upon the creature or being or whatever it is that causes it, and it isn’t friendly.” I explained.

“What do you mean? It’s a monster?” Thiago asked. He seemed somewhat incredulous. 

“I can’t say for sure. But it was running after me and Lúcio, and carrying a scythe. I don’t think it had good intentions.” 

They understood that I was serious, and concurred with my plan. We entered into the fungal wilderness, getting away from the river. After some minutes, the humming grew distant once again. 

“Give me a moment, please…” Popcorn said, as he sat down to recover his energies. I leaned against one of the giant fungus and also used the moment to rest a little bit. But our respite was short-lived. We heard a loud scream. It was Bia, calling for help. My tiredness immediately disappeared, and I got up and ran as fast as I could towards where the screams were coming from. I didn’t even know if Popcorn or the others were or not following me. 

After one or two minutes of sprinting, I could hear the humming again, louder and louder, and then I finally saw Bia. She was hiding behind one of the giant fungus, crying. She was covered in blood, there was a large cut in her left shoulder, which she had covered with a bloodstained shirt. Next to her, the river we had tagged along before.

“Are you okay? What happened?” I asked her. 

“There was a monster…” She cried. “It tried to kill me…”

“Where did it go?” Oregano asked, arriving with Thiago and Popcorn. 

“Pardal saved me… He gave me his shirt and lured it away.” Bia sobbed. The humming was indeed getting more distant. 

“Maybe we should go that shack.” Popcorn said. “And wait until dawn.”

“What? There’s a safe zone and you didn’t told us?” Thiago asked.

“The shack’s owner was clearly a ghost. I don’t trust him.” I said.

“Well, we will be clearly dead if we don’t go somewhere safe too!” Thiago said. 

As much as I disliked him, he had a point. We helped Bia get up again, and we walked towards the direction of the shack.
