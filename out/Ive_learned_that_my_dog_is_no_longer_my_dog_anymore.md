My name is Alexandra, I am a 16 year old girl, I still live with my parents. I love both of my parents dearly, but someone in my family was always there for me when others weren't. Someone who was the apple of my eye, a family type of bond that I cannot explain how strong the bond was

&#x200B;

. A soulmate. His name was Kodiak, he is a big fluffy love-able Newfoundland dog, his fur is a beautiful brown just like the Kodiak bear. I basically grew up with Kodiak my entire life, including my childhood. He was like a brother to me, except my bond between him and me is stronger than my actual brother. I believed our souls were related and meant to be.

&#x200B;

I cried my eyes out when the veterinarians told me he wouldn't live any longer than 2 years, he had a Cardiac Tumour growing onto his heart. I had booked an appointment with a different veterinarian who had told me that he would heal my dog, at first I thought this was too good to be true.

He told me a herb that can "apparently heal" the Tumour and reverse it. I trusted him. I trusted the veterinarian. I don't know what kind of idiot I am. I am depressed, I breakdown every time I think about my dog. I betrayed my own soulmate by a stupid foolish trickster. I am sorry, Kodiak I love you. I would've never let anyone hurt you. I am scared. But you aren't here for me anymore, Kodiak where are you. I don't know if I can move on without you, I want to be with you forever. Just me and you, nobody else here. That sure sounds great, I love you Kodiak. I can never forgive what I have done to you.

&#x200B;

Kodiak was taken from the veterinarian, I never got him back. What the veterinarian told me was clever lies disguised as a gift. I contacted the veterinarian, his name is Alfred, I took my dog to this veterinarian. The animal hospital was unique, the capacity only allowed 2 dogs max and the treatment was extra special and all professional. Alfred took classes for 10 years, mainly studying the dogs anatomy and the way the dogs bodies work.

&#x200B;

His vet office was mainly for dogs, I heard many great reviews from there. People told me their dogs were never so healthy before, one of the dog owners had even claimed he cured cancer. I was convinced and made a mistake because all humans do. I let him keep him "temporarily", according to him. Alfred took my dog because I thought he would fix him. It's been 3 months without my dog and no information from Alfred, I was worried. But I thought "maybe this treatment takes a while". I told myself everyday that there is nothing to worry about and Alfred wouldn't hurt my dog. I thought at least. 

&#x200B;

The thing I found strange about Alfred was his obsession with my dog, he would always draw pictures of my dog's anatomy, he even talked about how he knew how to skin wolves. He joked about skinning my dog and wearing his skin, who would've thought that wasn't a joke. Tell me, who. Am I just an idiot. The weirdest thing he told me about is the science behind knotting in dogs, I never wanted to know. He even had a real dog's skeleton, with a dog's skin on top of the skeleton acting as a cloak.

&#x200B;

The veterinarian told me to wait, because he needed to go downstairs and nobody is allowed down there except him. I found this odd, really odd. Maybe that was his space where other dog's files were. Maybe to protect the privacy of the owners. Not to mention, he would also take strays or dogs with rabies, and he would claim he would heal them or just send them to dog shelters. Nobody ever heard from the dogs he would take, nobody even knew the shelters or where the "cured dogs" went, they've just assumed he gave them away for new homes.

&#x200B;

My dog came back after 4 months, he was cured and healthy. I was so happy to see him, my eyes were pouring happy tears. But something was off about my dog, instead of being the happy energetic dog he used to be, he would rather sleep all day. He would avoid humans, and he didn't even like his favourite foods anymore. This wasn't Kodiak at all, I just thought he was depressed from not being at home for so long.

&#x200B;

Maybe he and Alfred weren't getting along that well? But my dog also looked different, his eyes were more.... Human. His fur was not as vibrant as before, it looked like a tanned pelt. His paws, were oddly shaped. His snout also had a weird shape. He hated dog food, he refused even his favourite dog food. I gave him a plate of peas and mashed potatoes, he was starving and he never devoured food so fast. So I made a recipe that was safe for dogs to consume, he was no longer refusing food

&#x200B;

. He had no energy as he used to, but he was up walking around and barking. His barking sounded very off, although. Kodiak never wagged his tail, the tail was stiff. I got pissed at my dog for the first time, he would refuse my love and he would growl and run away. I wasn't only just enraged, but I was also heartbroken to see my dog this way. I've tried to contact Alfred, but the number was apparently out of service, I've tried to find the location of the office.

&#x200B;

It was still there, I've even gone to the office. Alfred wasn't there, the other veterinarians had claimed they never knew "Alfred". Nor have they ever heard of him. So I screamed at the veterinarians because I knew something was always off about this "Alfred" guy and threatened to even burn their place down, and call the police on them. I was dead serious, I grabbed my phone and lighter. You should've seen the look on their faces when I stabbed one of them with my pocket knife, I knew that Kodiak wasn't my dog. I was 100% positive. The police were called on me, before I could even take a look downstairs. The police were already there, I had told them about my dog. They let me go, but they didn't check the office because they had other "duty".

&#x200B;

I got home, there was Kodiak sitting on the couch staring at me with his unsettling human-like eyes. I went to the couch to sit beside him, he was making weird whimpering noises. A noise that I've never heard a dog make. His crying was getting louder so I went up to Kodiak and started to pet him, I scratched his belly and I felt something on his belly. I looked under his tummy, I saw a zipper and I was confused. So out of curiosity, I unzipped his zipper. I saw human skin, it looked like a human stomach. I saw that my dog's skin was literally sewed onto the person. I panicked and started to question the human inside of the dog, he was whimpering and struggling to speak. I remember. When the human inside of the dog stood up on his hind legs, his paws and feet were oddly shaped.

&#x200B;

His legs and arms were human. He didn't even pretend to act like a dog anymore. He started to walk on his hind legs, he started to mumble things. I asked him if I could take a look inside of his mouth. I think he agreed because he sat down and opened his mouth. I look inside of his mouth. There was a man inside of my dog, my dog's jaw was attached to his so when he barked, the mouth would move. My dog had been skinned and his face had been turned into a taxidermy so I wouldn't suspect a thing. When I say his eyes were human, his eyes didn't have any dog features. I didn't know how I thought this was normal, I went crazy. The human-dog now lived with me, he would play his role as a dog when visitors came. But with just me and him, he walked around like a human.

&#x200B;

Eating, sleeping, drinking and watching T.V as a human. Keep in mind that it was horrifying, I saw that other brown Newfoundland dogs had been sewn onto my dogs skin so that a man could fit inside. He was now my new companion, he would listen better. He would even still play fetch and play card games with me. Alfred called me, he told me that this is what he'd done, he knew I wanted my dog to live longer. So Alfred said, " I thought, why not make him live as long as human". He had told me he skinned and tanned my dog, and got a taxidermist to do his face.

&#x200B;

He drugged a man, and sewed the dog onto him. He told me the man wanted to become a dog, so he told the man he would make a realistic suit for him and find him an owner. Basically he just did what both of us wanted, except not in a way what we wanted. So I decided to go along with it and accept the fact that this human-dog is now my companion. I fed him, I played card games with him, I treated him like a dog and a human being.

&#x200B;

He still ate out of a dog bowl, he would sit with me and eat meals at the dinner table. Basically, because Alfred wasn't his real name and Alfred kept his identity a secret. The police couldn't do anything, if they tried taking the suit off of this man, he would die. My dog's skin is becoming infused with his skin, I couldn't do anything and the man had told me he is pretty happy with his new life. He had his own dog house outside, and had his own dog bed.

Basically, I have my dog but forever, basically this man got his dream but also forever.

Be careful of what you wish for. It may not be what it seems.
