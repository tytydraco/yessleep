“Grab a brush and give the machinery bay a sweep.” The supervisor said, sullen as usual.

Anyone with a licence to operate the material handling equipment was dropping pallets outside for an urgent delivery, so the area was empty for once. Allocated for forklifts were fifteen dusty parking bays, with a barrier running along the back and right-hand side. To the left was a jungle of empty metal cages stacked on top of one another. Swampish green and black paint had chipped in some cases to reveal a rusted skeleton. I got started.

Menial work meant freedom to daydream, and I’m a dreamer in all senses of the word. I dream of moving to London to pursue an acting career. At night, I dream of performing on a West End stage, raucous crowds rising to their feet as I bow to a blinding curtain of light and blackness beyond. I imagine. I think. I sometimes dabble with substances to enhance my dreams, however I hasten to add I was not under the influence of anything other than a cup of tea’s worth of caffeine when the forklift driver reversed towards me.

I noticed the rhythmic beep and looked up to see the yellow rear end of the three tonne vehicle approaching.

“Just sweeping here, mate. Watch out.”

Beep.

“Hello?”

Beep.

“Could you wait a minute, please?”

Beep.

The driver never looked, and instead of waiting, sped up. I dived away instinctively, wedging myself into unseen safety. The concrete floor was unforgiving on my elbows and knees as I went down. I heard the sweeping brush go under the forklift, snapped into pieces. I lay there for a minute, mouth dry and face pale, before rising shakily. I twisted to stand as upright as possible. I found myself in a tight niche between the barrier and the first row of cages. I was lucky there was some depth to it, otherwise my legs might’ve been left poking out.

“Fucking prick! You nearly killed me!”

My cheeks were hot, and my stomach clenched. I breathed for a few seconds, assuming the driver would pull forward, let me out and apologise. I peered through the mesh. The driver’s seat was already empty. Everything was the way it had been moments before, except I was trapped inside the cage jungle and couldn’t get out.

I must’ve shouted for help for twenty minutes, but nobody came. Wriggling to look away from my point of entry, I noticed that there was space to move inwards. I could see another niche between cage stacks. It wasn’t flush to the one I was in, but it was just about accessible. I slid towards it. Reaching this new dark, claustrophobia-inducing place, I saw another entryway. On and on it went. Sidestepping through the jumble of cages, I salivated over the legal ramifications. I pictured myself in the courtroom dressed in a tailored suit, the dignified victim of a workplace accident owed a sizable lump sum in compensation. Enough to buy and furnish a trendy apartment in London. Enough for flat white coffees before auditions. Audition nailed, I could lean by the back exit of the theatre and smoke roll-up cigarettes and wear expensive sunglasses even if it was cloudy and cold.

The passable space would sometimes take me left or right, which messed with my orientation. Flickering strip lights hung above, but the illumination that penetrated to ground level among the cages was weak. I started to lose faith in my ability to find an exit. Climbing up the stacks crossed my mind, but that seemed quite dramatic. A last resort, perhaps. Around the time I began to doubt, I came to the edge of the labyrinth. There was a small clearing and a door. It looked like the entrance to a cleaning cupboard or boiler room. I sighed and pulled down the handle anyway, half expecting it to be locked. I thought it was at first, but it turned out that I’d simply misjudged the weight of it. Heaving, I opened the door and steam billowed out like breath from the throat of a dragon. I proceeded.

There was no throughway inside, and no light. Or so I thought. After a moment, my eyes adjusted, and I saw a row of tiny red and green lights along some kind of fuse board. Switches either on or off. The pattern was reflecting off something on the floor. I thought it could be glass, but the reflection was not static. It shifted, almost imperceptibly. Water. A small pool. What had disturbed it?

Expanding and contracting against the interior wall to my left was a dripping shadow. It crept closer, and I froze. Slithering towards me was a many-tentacled thing with a pulsing, distended head. Slitted, uncaring eyes flashed yellow in the steam and darkness. A void appeared at the centre of its bulk, and thrust forward with an awful wet sound was a gaping cartilage beak. It clacked and hissed and dragged itself closer.

Negligent forklift drivers had become a far more preferable alternative to my predicament there and then. I fled the room, trying, and failing, to close the heavy door behind me. The steam had made the entryway slick, and it cost me my footing. I went down hard on my knee, heard something crunch behind the kneecap, and scrambled back to the cage jungle. I heard short, choked noises from behind as the black cephalopod pursued. I jammed myself into the niche I’d exited from and rushed sidelong back the way I’d come. The creature hurled itself against the opening and forced itself through with a prolonged squelch. Tentacles felt blindly along behind me as I outpaced the monster’s body. Some disappeared between the mesh of cages and others took wrong turns down gaps I couldn’t have hoped to fit through. One bounced its way along behind me, however, and coiled around my ankle as I stopped to negotiate an oblique passageway through the cages. It upended me, and I heard the others slither away from the routes they’d taken. The alarm had gone out. The prey had been found.

Working in a warehouse environment meant handling awkward objects that could be heavy. For that reason, employers provided staff members with specialised work equipment including, but not limited to, high-visibility vests, hardhats, and steel-toe capped footwear. Thankfully, I had a pair of size twelves on. I pulled against the creature’s will and gained three inches of give. With my free foot, I kicked the tentacle below the sole of my other boot as hard as I could. The soft appendage was crushed between my steel toe and the edge of a metal cage frame. A shriek echoed behind me and the tentacle loosened its grip for a crucial second. I ripped my leg free and pressed on. I was numb to everything that wasn’t critical to keeping me alive. Forward, left, forward, forward. Was it brighter here? What was that noise? Is the tentacle back? No. Could it climb? No sign of it above me. What’s that up ahead? Forklift. Entryway.

They found me screaming and hysterical, trapped behind the truck in a tight gap where a walkway barrier meets some cages. Drenched in sweat and feral, I lashed out at anyone who tried to touch me. An ambulance was called, and they took me to a specialist psychiatric unit. I have since made a full recovery.

Nobody took my account seriously. They put it down to ‘an episode of disreality’. Unbelievable.
