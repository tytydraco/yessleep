New Year’s Eve is always special for my wife, Erin, and me. No matter where we are, no matter what’s going on, we always find each other for the midnight kiss. It’s been our tradition for the ten years we’ve been married. This year, we decided to go to a friend’s party—just a casual get-together at a cozy downtown apartment. Erin was excited. I went along with it to make her happy.

Erin has always loved New Year’s Eve. She calls it “our reset”—a chance to reflect and start fresh. It’s one of the reasons I love her: her optimism, the way she always finds meaning in little things. I used to feel the same way, but this year, I couldn’t shake a sense of unease I couldn’t quite place.

The party was fine. A little crowded for my taste, but there was good food, plenty of drinks, and everyone was in high spirits. Erin thrived in the atmosphere, moving effortlessly from group to group, laughing and chatting like she always does. She has this magnetic quality that draws people in, and I could see the way others lit up when she joined their conversations.

I hung back by the makeshift bar, nursing a whiskey and catching up with a couple of old friends.

As midnight approached, I started keeping an eye on Erin, mentally timing my walk across the room. I always made a point to find her for the countdown, and she expected it. It was our thing. I’d thought about proposing on New Year’s Eve, back when we were still dating, but I’d chickened out. Maybe that’s why I’ve always been so adamant about the tradition—it felt like a second chance to get it right every year.

At 11:58, I started toward her. She was standing near the balcony, a glass of champagne in her hand, her back to me. Something about the way she was standing seemed… different. Her posture was stiffer than usual, her shoulders slightly hunched. I shook it off, blaming the whiskey for making me overthink.

“Ten… nine… eight…” The crowd’s voices swelled, a chorus of excitement.

I was a few steps away when she turned to face me. The fireworks outside lit her face in soft flashes. Her dark curls framed her cheeks, and her smile was faint, like she was waiting for me to come closer.

“Three… two… one!” Cheers erupted around us as I leaned in for the kiss.



Her lips were cold.

I remember thinking she must’ve been outside, though I hadn’t seen her step onto the balcony. The coldness was startling, almost metallic, and a faint bitter taste lingered as we pulled apart. The kiss was brief but tender, like always, and yet… not like always.

When she pulled back, she looked into my eyes and said, “Happy New Year.”

“Happy New Year,” I replied, but the words felt stuck in my throat. Something about her didn’t feel right. Her smile lingered a little too long, the edges of her lips stretched unnaturally. Her gaze didn’t quite meet mine, as if she were staring through me instead of at me. When she stepped back, her movements were stiff, almost mechanical.

I opened my mouth to ask if she was okay, but before I could speak, someone called my name from across the room.

“Liam!”

I turned toward the voice and froze. Erin was standing on the other side of the room, laughing with a friend. She waved at me, her face bright and carefree, completely oblivious to the panic rising in my chest.

I turned back toward the balcony, but the space was empty. The woman I’d kissed—who I thought was my wife—was gone.



I stumbled back into the room, my hands trembling. “Hey,” Erin said, coming over to me. “Are you okay? You look pale.”

“I thought… I just saw you—” I trailed off, staring at her. Everything about her seemed normal, but the memory of that kiss burned in my mind. The coldness, the stiffness, the wrongness.

“What are you talking about? I’ve been here the whole time,” she said, laughing softly. “Have you had too much to drink?”

I nodded, not trusting myself to speak. She let it go, but I couldn’t. I kept glancing at her throughout the night, searching for anything that might explain what had happened. Her laugh sounded normal, but sometimes it felt hollow, like it didn’t match her expression.

Once, as she talked to someone, I saw her reflection in the window. She was smiling, but her reflection wasn’t.



By the time we got home, I was on edge. Erin didn’t seem to notice. She hummed softly as she brushed her teeth, her face relaxed and happy. I stood in the doorway, watching her. Every now and then, her reflection in the mirror would lag, her movements slightly out of sync. I told myself I was imagining it, that the night had just rattled me.

“Are you coming to bed?” she asked, catching me staring.

“Yeah,” I said, forcing a smile. I climbed into bed, but I couldn’t sleep. Her breathing was soft and steady beside me, but I couldn’t shake the memory of the balcony. Of those cold lips. Of the wrongness that seemed to follow me home.

At some point, I must’ve drifted off, because when I opened my eyes, the room was dark, and Erin wasn’t in bed. My heart raced as I sat up. “Erin?” I called out.

No response.



I checked the bathroom. The kitchen. The living room. She was nowhere to be found. “Erin, where are you?”

A noise came from the bedroom—a soft rustling, like sheets being pulled. I rushed back, flipping on the light. Erin was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling.

“Where did you go?” I asked, my voice shaking.

She turned her head slowly, her lips curling into a too-wide smile. “I never left,” she said.

Her voice was wrong. Hollow, like someone trying to mimic her tone but failing. My breath caught as her smile widened, stretching impossibly far. Her face stayed frozen that way, but in the mirror across the room, her reflection turned its head to face me.

And it wasn’t smiling.

The light flickered, and in the brief moment of darkness, I felt her hand close over mine.

“Happy New Year,” she whispered in the dark.
