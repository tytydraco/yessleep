As a kid, I thought Sweden was magic.
The forests felt alive. Not in a spooky way in a storybook way. The moss was soft as carpet, the lakes so still they looked fake, and the sky had this pale blue clarity that made you feel like the world was endless.
I used to stay with my morfar (grandfather) in a little red cabin deep in the woods of Värmland. He’d wake me up early to pick lingonberries and tell me stories about trolls and skogsrå, about old gods buried under rocks and lakes that could pull you under if you looked at them too long.

I loved every second of it.
 Every smell of pine. Every wooden rune hanging in his home. Every weird folk song he'd hum when the power went out.
But that was when I was eight.
 Back when magic felt safe.
I moved back to Sweden this year. At 29. My morfar passed away and left me the cabin.
 At first, I thought it would be peaceful. A chance to escape the noise of the city in USA.
But now… I don’t sleep.
 I don’t go outside when it gets dark.
 And I don’t look at the forest anymore.
 Because something in it is watching me back.

It started on the second night.
I arrived late, just past 10 p.m., driving up the old gravel road with fog crawling across the trees like fingers.
 I unpacked, lit the fireplace, and tried to sleep.
At exactly 2:16 a.m., I heard something.
A knock.
Not on the door on the window.
 Three taps.
 Even. Soft. Deliberate.
I sat up in bed, heart thudding.
 Morfar’s cabin only has two windows. One in the kitchen. One in the bedroom.
 The bedroom one is on the second floor.
I froze.
 Didn’t move.
 Didn’t breathe.
No more knocks. No sounds of footsteps or branches cracking. Just the wind.
 I eventually convinced myself it was a bird.
 A branch.
 Sleep deprivation.
I was wrong.

Next day, I walked into town. Östra Ämtervik. Population: probably fewer than 300.
 I grabbed some groceries, made small talk. Everyone was kind… in that distant, silent Swedish way.
But when I mentioned the cabin — said I inherited it from “old Rune Dahlström” the cashier's smile vanished.
“You’re staying out there?” he asked.
 I nodded.
 He just handed me my change and said,
 “Don’t go outside after sunset.”

That night, I stayed up. Coffee in hand. Lights on. Phone charged.
Nothing happened.
Until 2:16 a.m.
 Exactly.
Three knocks.
 This time, on the kitchen window.
 Then, laughter.
Not a person’s laugh. Not exactly.
 It was too slow. Too spaced out. Like someone who’d never heard a laugh before was trying to copy one.
I stepped to the kitchen, heart jackhammering.
 There were no lights outside.
But when I got close to the window, I swear to god I saw antlers.
 Big, pale antlers rising just above the sill.
I backed away. Didn’t sleep. Didn’t move.
 When the sun finally rose, the ground outside the kitchen was littered with dead birds. All their heads turned to face the window.

I should’ve left.
 I wanted to.
But something made me stay.
I started finding carved symbols in the trees around the cabin. Circles with three lines through them.
 A friend I emailed said they were ancient Nordic protection runes. “Alghiz,” he called it. Meant for warding off evil.
But they weren’t new.
 They’d been there for years.
 My morfar had carved them.
 Surrounding the property like a barrier.
But some had been scraped out. Like someone or something had clawed through them.

Three nights ago, I woke up in the woods.
No memory of walking there.
 No shoes.
 Just me, standing among the birches, in complete silence.
I wasn’t alone.
Something stood across from me tall, thin, the antlers scraping against the trees above.
 Its eyes… no, not eyes. Holes. Blacker than the forest around them.
 Its skin looked like bark, but it moved like it had joints. Too many joints.
It whispered my name.
Not in Swedish.
 In my own voice.
I ran.
I don’t remember getting back to the cabin.
 But I locked every door.
 Turned on every light.
And the next morning, carved my own rune into the front door. Deep and shaking.

This morning, I got a letter. No stamp. No return address. Just sitting on the porch.
 Inside was a note. It was in Swedish. But translates too:
"Papa, your grandson doesn`t like me"

I used to think Sweden was magic.
 Now I know it is.
 But not in the way I thought.
There are old things here.
 Things that live in the silence, in the fog, in the still lakes and crooked trees.
 Things that remember names.
 Things that wear the voices of loved ones.
 Things that knock at 2:16 a.m.
And they do not like when you leave.
 Or when you return.

I’m leaving tomorrow.
Or at least I’ll try.
 If your reading this…
Dont go to Sweden. And if you have too, Be careful. Especially at 2:16 a.m.
