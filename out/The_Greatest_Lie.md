By 2024, mankind appeared to have achieved extraordinary levels of technical and cultural growth. In truth, mankind had gone extinct for more than two centuries, and no one had noticed.

The truth was that Earth wasn’t ruled by humans anymore. It was run by aliens.

It started in the early 1800s, during the first Industrial Revolution. Earth had become a curiosity for the Zenari, an interstellar species skilled in genetic engineering and assimilation. They didn’t invade with lasers or warships; they infiltrated subtly. Disguised as humans, the Zenari blended into society to observe and experiment. For decades, they lived among humans, taking samples, learning the language, studying their behavior.

But then, humanity began to falter. A series of plagues swept the globe, followed by environmental collapse, and a population that was already on the brink dwindled rapidly. The Zenari hadn’t planned for this. They relied on humans to maintain the ecosystem they had hoped to study for centuries. If the species vanished entirely, Earth would become another barren, forgotten planet in their archives.

So, the Zenari took a radical step.

When the last human died in 1823, they stepped into the roles of the deceased. They cloned themselves, altering their DNA to replicate human genetics. They mimicked human speech patterns, emotions, and societal norms. They had observed humans for so long that they were able to replicate everything perfectly—clothes, traditions, even the flaws. Cities continued to grow. Inventions like the telephone, the light bulb, and even the airplane were all Zenari creations, mimicking the paths humanity had started but couldn’t finish.

Generations passed. The Zenari became so deeply entrenched in their human roles that they began to forget what they truly were. The lie was so convincing that even they believed it. Earth carried on, “human” civilization thriving—until one day in December 2024, when the truth came crashing down.

Dr. Elias Harper stared at the screen in disbelief. The evolutionary biologist had spent years researching why certain genetic markers in the human genome didn’t make sense. They seemed too perfect, too artificial, like someone had tampered with them. At first, he thought it might just be a quirk of evolution—or contamination in his samples. But as his database grew, the anomalies became undeniable.

And now, he had the results.

There were no humans left. Not one. The "human genome" wasn't human at all—it was a complex fabrication, a blend of alien DNA created to resemble mankind with uncanny accuracy. Every sample he examined, from newborns to centenarians, indicated the same thing: they were not Earth's original inhabitants.

Elias pulled away from his desk, his thoughts whirling. He thought of his friends, family, and coworkers. People he’d known his entire life. Were they all… them?

The lab door creaked open behind him, and he jumped.

“Elias,” said a familiar voice. It was Dr. Veronica Fields, his research partner. She stood in the doorway, her expression unreadable. “I think we need to talk.”

“You… you knew,” Elias stammered, backing away from her.

Veronica sighed and entered the room, her palms lifted in a sign of peace. "I was hoping you wouldn't figure it out, especially not like this. But yes, I knew.”

“What are you?” he demanded.

She hesitated, then let out a slow breath. “I’m Zenari. Same as you. Same as everyone else.”

Elias froze. “What are you talking about? I’m human!”

“No,” she said gently. “You’re not. None of us are.”

His heart raced as she continued. “You’re one of the first-generation clones, Elias. The ones created to replace the original humans after they went extinct. You’ve been living this life so long, you forgot the truth—just like the rest of us.”

"That's impossible," he responded, shaking his head. “I have memories. A childhood. Parents—”

“All fabricated,” Veronica interrupted, her tone calm but firm. “Your memories were implanted. Your parents were just older clones. The Zenari designed it all to keep the illusion intact. To keep Earth running as it always had.”

Elias staggered back, gripping the edge of the desk for support. “Why? Why go to all this trouble?”

Veronica’s gaze softened. “Because Earth is unique. Humanity was unique. We didn’t want to lose that. At first, it was about preservation—saving your culture, your ecosystems. But over time… we became part of it. We stopped being Zenari and started being human. Even now, most of us don’t remember what we really are.”

He stared at her, his mind spinning. “But… what now? What happens now that I know?”

“That’s up to you,” she said quietly. “The truth doesn’t change anything, Elias. The world still works. Society still functions. We’ve built something beautiful here, something worth preserving. But if you want answers, if you want to remember who you really are… I can help you.”

She extended a hand.

Elias gazed at her, then back at the screen, which showed the data that had devastated his world. He reflected about his acquaintances, coworkers, and the billions of people that go about their lives blissfully unconscious of the reality.

Did it matter that they weren’t human? Or had they become something more?

He took a deep breath and reached for her hand.
