&#x200B;

My first day at Smokey Oak began at 4 in the morning, with someone pounding on my door. 

  *“Up and attem, Sinner! The Lord has blessed you with another day upon this earth and you’re gonna spend it in His Glory!”* A voice I didn’t recognize called. 

&#x200B;

My entire body still ached but I dragged myself out of bed. My legs buckled under my own weight at first. I had to grip the side of the bed to keep myself standing. Slowly, I braced myself against the bed and steadied myself on my feet as I made myself stand. The door swung open and I saw a middle aged blonde woman with short, somewhat poofy hair waiting for me. I could see a rifle in her hands and a pistol holstered at her hip.

  “Get moving, Sinner.” She said, her voice cold and authoritative.

&#x200B;

I made myself shuffle into the hall. The blonde woman shadowed me as I walked, escorting me into another room at the end of the hall where I could hear the sound of running water.

  “Get yourself washed up. Breakfast is waiting for you and you’ve got a long day ahead of you, Sinner.” She said. 

&#x200B;

In the room ahead of me, I could see a set of unlocked lockers and a large communal shower room where a group of other women, about fifteen to twenty were in the middle of bathing. I could see bruises and welts on their skin from beatings and the sight of them turned my stomach and made my skin crawl. The blonde woman stared expectantly at me, rifle in her hand. 

  “Throw your clothes in the bin.” She said, gesturing to a laundry bin nearby, “You’ll get your work outfit when you get out.”

&#x200B;

I hesitated for a moment longer before stripping off my shirt. My jeans, bra, and underwear went next.  As I undressed, the blonde woman just stared at me, her expression cold and stony… And I felt somehow… Lesser… Taking off my clothes almost felt like taking off my own skin. Beneath them, my body was bruised and marked with cuts and scrapes from last night's car accident. My clothes were tossed into the bin she’d gestured to, along with countless other pairs of identical white uniforms that looked sort of like scrubs. I knew I was never going to see those clothes again, not that I would’ve really been able to wear them again anyways… Patrick had taken my wallet and phone from me the other night while I’d been unconscious. There was nothing left in my pockets. 

&#x200B;

With my clothes gone, I shuffled into the shower room. A few of the other women looked at me but none of them said anything.

&#x200B;

I forced myself towards one of the vacant shower heads. The water that came out of it was ice cold and there was only a single well used bar of soap to wash myself with. I didn’t even get a chance to touch it. I spent most of my first shower at Smokey Oak trying to acclimate myself to the freezing water before it was suddenly shut off, leaving me shivering and slightly wet.

&#x200B;

  “Lockers, Sinners!” The blonde called, “Breakfast is waiting and we’re burning daylight!”

The other women in the shower room made their way out. Each one approached a nearby locker and opened it, taking out an identical white pair of scrubs with plain socks and underwear along with a plain pair of work shoes. The blonde woman waited beside one locker and gestured for me to come closer. I quietly did as she asked.

&#x200B;

  “Your work clothes will be waiting for you in your locker.” She said, “You keep them intact. You don’t modify them. You don’t ruin them. Is that clear?”

  “Y-yes…” I said meekly.

  “Yes ma’am.” The blonde corrected.

  “Yes ma’am…”

She glared at me with quiet disgust before huffing and turning away, leaving me to get dressed.

&#x200B;

Once I was dressed, I followed the other women into a small cafeteria… If you could call it that. There were a few tables set up, and a line of women gathering to receive identical helpings of something on flimsy paper plates. I wasn’t really sure what it was… It looked like a weird mix of thanksgiving stuffing and vomit. It had no smell to it. There were no forks or knives. Everyone else was eating it with their hands, so when I got my serving, I did the same. It tasted… Well… It was hard to really describe the taste. The best I can describe it as would be cold, slimy bread with a hint of that aftertaste chicken gets when it’s been in the fridge for too long. The texture was mushy and crumbly at the same time though. The first bite made me gag as I spit it back out.

&#x200B;

One of the women sitting at my table gave me a sad, somewhat sympathetic smile as if to say: ‘*Yeah. I know.’* But she didn’t say anything out loud.

  “You eat it, or you don’t, Sinner.” The blonde woman said. I looked over to see her watching me from the end of the table, “But that’s all you’ll get until dinner. So think real hard before you turn your nose up at it.”

&#x200B;

There was something in her tone that sent a chill right through me. I looked back down at the mushy loaf on my plate before picking it up and trying to eat it again. I gagged the entire time but I eventually got it down. Less than half an hour after we’d sat down, the blonde woman spoke again.

&#x200B;

  “Listen up, Sinners… You’ve got another glorious, God Given day ahead of you. And before you go out there to your daily labor, it’s important that you thank God that in his infinite wisdom, he saw fit to set you upon the path to redemption. He saw fit to permit you the choice of salvation. It’s a beautiful thing. So. Before we get to our work, let us pray…”

&#x200B;

She clasped her hands together and the rest of the women in the room did the same, waiting for her to speak.

  “Heavenly Father, we give thanks this day for your glory and your wisdom. We give thanks for the work we do in your name, so that we may seek out our salvation. And we pray for those among us who may not find the strength to persist on the path, so that they may be struck by your glory and rended from this sinful earth. Amen.”

  “Amen…” Came the muffled replies.

  “Good, good… Now get up, Sinners. The daylights wasting!”

&#x200B;

The other women in the room got up and shuffled out, back down the hall, and through the door I’d come in through the night before. The blonde followed us the entire time, leading us outside where another woman, also blonde but with a chubbier physique and longer hair was waiting for us. 

  “Running late, Sinners.” The chubbier woman said, “We don’t got all day!”

&#x200B;

The women around me assembled into a line as the blonde with the gun stood beside her chubby friend. The two almost looked like sisters… Almost… But I doubted they were actually related.

  “Welcome to another day in paradise.” The chubby woman said, pacing along the line, “Y’all be working in the wheat fields today… Except for you…” She singled out two of the women near the end of the line.

  “You two are on homemaking duty. I recall it being your turn, wasn’t it?”

  “Yes ma’am…” One of the women said meekly.

  “Then get your ass moving.”

&#x200B;

The other two women took off at a jog while the rest shuffled away. I hesitated for a moment before following them. I noticed the short haired blonde whisper something to the chubby woman, who narrowed her eyes at me before she spoke.

  “Danielle. Rachael. You two hold up.”   

I froze in place, and noticed another woman doing the same. The other woman was a brunette with messy hair that was still wet from the shower and chapped lips. She turned to face the chubby blonde who approached us with a slow, dutiful gait. Her associate left with the others.

&#x200B;

  “Rachael, as you may have noticed we’ve got a new face around here.” The chubby woman said, “You show her the ropes out there. You keep an eye on her, that clear?”

  “Yes ma’am.” 

The chubby woman looked at me next.

  “You… You do what she says. You keep your head down. You work… And perhaps God might be so gracious to give you a second chance…. Perhaps.” She smiled at me, it was a twisted, sickly sweet smile that made my skin crawl.

&#x200B;

  “Go.” She said, before turning away from us.

Rachael didn’t seem to need to be told twice. She took off at a slight jog, following the rest of the women and I followed her.

&#x200B;

  “So, you’re Danielle, huh?” She asked as I caught up to her.

  “Dani.” I corrected.

  “Right. I’m Rachael. Rachael Morris.” She already sounded a little exhausted, “What’d they throw you in here for?”

  “I… I was trying to leave…” I said quietly. Rachael scoffed.

  “Yeah, me too.” She said, “Met a guy about four years back out in New Jersey. Thought I was dating a sweet country boy at the time. We got married, then he wanted to spend some time back home with his family and I thought ‘*What the hell? Why not?’”*

&#x200B;

I felt a sick knot in my stomach as she spoke.

  “And now you’re here…” I said quietly.

  “Yeah. Now I’m here…” She repeated, “He started getting pushy. Started acting different. Kept dragging me to their local whack job church. Then one night, he and I start arguing… And he starts hitting me… I let him get away with it the first time… Should’ve packed my things and run way before things got to that point, but I guess I just kept making excuses for him. Second time he put his hands on me though, I told him we were through. I hit him back. Next thing I know, I’m driving away and that asshole in the pickup truck is blocking the road. I got out to tell him to move… And he just beat my ass and drags me here…”

&#x200B;

  “Patrick?” I asked.

  “You already met him?” Rachael said.

  “He’s my brother in law.” I replied. She whistled in response.

  “Well… You my friend, were fucked the moment you set foot in Smokey Falls.” She said, “Patricks sort of the warden out here… Probably not his actual title, but it’s more or less what he does. He runs the show.”

&#x200B;

  “And the two blondes?” I asked.

  “Jenny Sopik’s the one with the gun.” Rachael said, “She’s sort of the guard. The fat one is Martha Nash. She’s sorta one of Patricks seconds. He watches the men. She watches the women… Honestly, kinda glad they keep us separate… Martha’s mean. But she ain’t as mean as Patrick.”

I wasn’t sure I wanted to ask her to elaborate on that.

&#x200B;

  “So, how’d you like your morning rations?” Rachael asked, shifting the subject to something a little lighter.

  “What the hell was in that… Mush…?” I asked.

  “Nutraloaf. Y’know I actually read about it a few years back. They used to serve it in prisons until it started getting declared as ‘*cruel and unusual punishment*.’ Never realized that food could be a punishment until I tried that shit…”

  “Please tell me you get a taste for it.” I said softly.

  “Sorry.” She replied, forcing a sheepish smile, “Hate to say that you don’t.”

&#x200B;

We made it to the wheat fields a few minutes after the other women did. I could see Jenny Sopik watching us from a small raised gazebo short distance away, her rifle still in hand. One of the girls stood at attention beside her, occasionally leaving to fetch her water or food although Jenny herself barely seemed to move. She just smoked cigarette after cigarette as she watched us work.

&#x200B;

Aside from Jenny and her gazebo, the only thing I could see around us aside from the wheat field itself were a few rolling hills full of farmland. I could see several men working in another field a good distance away from us. They were also dressed in white scrubs and I could see another gazebo near where they were working, along with a familiar pickup truck adorned with bull horns.

&#x200B;

Patrick.

&#x200B;

Scattered throughout the farmland were tall crucifixes on long, thin poles. I really couldn’t say what purpose they served other than as a constant but flimsy reminder of just why we were there.

&#x200B;

Rachael showed me how to work in the wheat field. She showed me how to use the tools and tend to the crops. According to her, we tilled and planted every field by hand. Throughout the season, we tended and watered the fields. We fertilized them and when the harvest came, we harvested them. She hadn’t been around long enough to see what we were supposed to do in the winter yet. 

&#x200B;

The day was long and dragged by slowly. The sun beat down on my battered body, scorching my exposed skin red. The work was hard… Harder than any work I’d done before. After just an hour, I was drenched in sweat and wanted nothing more than to sit down and rest. But Rachael wouldn’t let me. Not out of cruelty. Out of concern.

&#x200B;

  “They catch you slacking off, and you’ll catch one hell of a beating.” She’d told me, before glancing over at Jenny in her place of honor under her shady gazebo, “You make her leave the gazebo, and she’ll make you wish you were never born.”

&#x200B;

So I pushed through. Somehow, even though my body ached more than it ever had, I did what I could to push through. 

&#x200B;

Sometime around noon, we heard a commotion coming from the mens field. We paused for a few moments to look over. I could hear distant voices shouting and see one of the men in white meekly trying to run from a larger man who I didn’t immediately recognize as Patrick. Patrick seemed to chase the man down, screaming at him all the while before grabbing him by the shirt and driving his fist into his face. The other man went down, and Patrick stood over him, punching him over and over again. Even from a distance, I could feel the weight of those punches…

&#x200B;

  “Someone got caught taking a break.” Rachael said dryly. 

I felt my skin crawl as I watched the distant shape of Patrick keep punching the downed man… Over and over again, beating him with a savagery that seemed almost inhuman.

&#x200B;

The nearby crack of a rifle pulled my attention away from the distant scene. Jenny stood at the edge of her gazebo, rifle in hand and pointed skyward.

  “Unless you Sinners want Pat to come on over here and give you a firsthand look at all that, you’ll get back to work.” She said.

Nobody uttered a single word of argument.

&#x200B;

The sun inched painfully across the sky as the day dragged on. When dusk finally came, Jenny spoke again.

  “Alright, Sinners. Pack your shit up. Dinner time!”

She watched us hand in our tools and escorted us back to the cabin where we’d started the day. 

&#x200B;

Dinner was another helping of cold nutraloaf and after that, we were led back to the hallway with our rooms. I watched as the other women, Rachael included shuffled into their respective rooms and when the doors closed behind them, either Jenny or Martha was there to lock it. My room was just as dark as it had been the night before and I dragged my aching body to the bare mattress and curled up onto it, meekly letting sleep take me.

&#x200B;

I had nothing else I could do.

&#x200B;

I wish I could say that the next day was any different, but it really wasn’t. It was almost beat for beat the exact same as the day before. Jenny woke me up by pounding on my door. I shuffled into the communal shower with the other women and forced myself under the cold water to wash yesterdays sweat and grime off of me. After that came breakfast, yet another helping of cold nutraloaf. 

&#x200B;

Just like the day before, we worked in the wheat fields. I talked to Rachael a little, but mostly just to ask questions. Talking wasn’t really encouraged amongst the other ‘workers’. 

&#x200B;

From sunup to sundown we worked. When dusk fell, we walked back to the cabin for dinner before turning in for the night. The only bathroom I had access to was the one in my room. A solitary toilet with little privacy… Not that there was anyone else who would see me. The only water I got was at breakfast and dinner. 

&#x200B;

This was my life now…

&#x200B;

The next day, there was one less woman in the showers, and one empty seat at breakfast. I saw Martha speaking to a few men who wheeled a covered body out of one of the rooms and felt my stomach turn at the sight of it. I heard a few whispers that the missing woman… Denise had taken her own life… But that was really it. 

&#x200B;

I worked in the fields.

&#x200B;

I ate dinner.

&#x200B;

I went back to my room. 

&#x200B;

On Friday, we heard a gunshot from the men's field while we were working. A few of us looked over to see the man under their gazebo holding his rifle and staring out into the distance. We watched from the corners of our eyes as Patrick drove his truck out that way to collect the body, a dead man clad in white. We watched as he and someone else… Joel I think… Lifted the corpse into the back of his truck and drove off. 

&#x200B;

I suppose that, combined with the suicide of the girl from the day before told me there were two ways out of this situation, but I didn’t have the stomach for either of them… I was too much of a coward to leave my bastard of a husband in the first place… Of course, I wouldn’t have the stomach to hang myself to get out of this miserable place… The crosses looked down on us as we worked and as the sky grew dark, they cast long shadows over the fields. 

&#x200B;

When I went back to my room after dinner, I did consider trying to smash my toilet so I could use the shards to cut my wrists… It was porcelain… I could theoretically do it. But even if I had the physical strength, which I doubted I did, I wouldn’t have the guts…

&#x200B;

Every day, the pain in my body grew worse. I didn’t think that was possible and yet somehow it was. Every day I reached a new level of misery that I hadn’t realized I could descend to… And I knew that if there was a Hell… This was it.

&#x200B;

And I knew that if this was Hell… I belonged here.

&#x200B;

Come Saturday, Jenny woke me up the way she had every other day. I showered with the others and ate the same rancid breakfast they’d fed me before. Then we set out to work in the fields. No one had said that anything would be different that day… Rachael certainly hadn’t said anything.

&#x200B;

Sometime around noon as I toiled in the fields, I heard the distant roar of an engine coming nearer… I vaguely recall thinking for the first time that Patrick really ought to do something about his muffler, no truck should be that ridiculously loud. But considering the bastard had a pair of truck nuts on his big stupid truck, I suppose that he probably broke the muffler on purpose. The truck rolled closer and came to a stop several feet away from the field. I saw the cabin door open as Patrick stepped out and made his way for the gazebo. I half expected him to look for me, but no such luck.

&#x200B;

Looking through his windshield, I saw no trace of Joel in the cabin. I’m not sure if I was disappointed or not… On one hand, I had nothing to say to my husband and on the other… Even after everything, I’d be lying if I said a small part of me didn’t silently pray he’d grow a conscience, see the horrors he’d participated in for what they were and save me from this hell… Oh, but that kind of naivety was what got me into this mess in the first place, wasn’t it? Patrick stood under the gazebo for a few moments, speaking to Jenny and occasionally looking toward us. Jenny of course just sat on her lazy ass, scrolling through her phone and barely even looking at us.

&#x200B;

I tried to focus on my work, not wanting to get called out with Patrick watching… I suppose I should be ashamed of myself to admit that I did halfheartedly hope that if I toughed this out, if I made myself work through the pain of my aching body, I might somehow make it through the end of this nightmare. 

&#x200B;

God, what a pathetic way to think…

&#x200B;

When Jenny called out to us, I couldn’t help but jump a little.

  “Sandra, Bianca, Melissa, Rachael, Danielle!”

Nearby, I saw Rachael stand at attention. She seemed to be noticing Patrick for the first time. I followed her and the other three women Jenny had named out of the field towards the gazebo where Jenny and Patrick waited.

&#x200B;

  “Well, well… What a sorry lot you are…” Patrick said, a bitter scowl in his voice. He glanced at Jenny, who gave him a half nod.

  “Come on now, to the truck.” He gestured towards it and we walked, climbing into the bed of it while Patrick wordlessly got back behind the wheel.

  “What’s going on?” I whispered to Rachael as I sat on the edge of the bed beside her.

  “Saturday.” Rachael whispered back, “Those who’ve earned it are judged to see if they’re worthy of returning to Society.”

  “Judged?” I asked anxiously. Rachael didn’t say anything further. Truth be told, I wasn’t sure if she herself knew. There was a quiet unease written on her face though that did nothing to soothe my own fears.

&#x200B;

With the truck loaded up, the engine roared to life again and it lurched forward. Patrick didn’t drive fast, he kept a slow, almost methodical pace down a dirt road that ran between the fields. Tall crosses lined it, casting afternoon shadows across us as he drove towards the treeline. I suppose it wasn’t unusual that nobody dared speak a word… Silence was the norm at Smokey Oak. But here it seemed all the more palpable. 

&#x200B;

The truck drove past the trees and into the woods, following a bumpy dirt road for what felt like a few kilometers. Past the trees, I could only see dense, heavy forest. No farmland. No trace of civilization at all. The drive wasn’t long. Only about fifteen minutes or so. But it felt so much longer…

&#x200B;

The truck eventually pulled into a rocky clearing. A small hill looming over us opened into a yawning cavern and I could see some sort of simple wooden structure built near its mouth. It wasn’t quite a building. It had no walls and no roof. It was almost like a pentagonal gazebo with no top. Those tall crosses rose above all five corners of it, and smaller wreaths of flowers and other crosses hung from the wood. Various other wooden crosses were planted into the ground nearby. This place almost felt like some sort of shrine.

&#x200B;

Patrick killed the engine of his truck again and got out.

  “Move, Sinners.” He said and the other women moved to get out. I did the same.

&#x200B;

Patrick herded us toward the wooden shrine. I could see a pistol holstered at his hip and he kept a hand placed on it at all times. He waited until we were all assembled before he spoke.

  “Some of you might remember this place, but to you new bloods… This is where you’re gonna have the most important day of your goddamn life.” He looked over to the cave, staring into its darkness for a moment before looking back at us.

&#x200B;

  “Y’know when he was a boy and his daddy ran Smokey Oak, our very own Father Abraham used to come by this place… Said it was a place of… Power. A holy place. Probably the holiest damn place on this sinful pile of shit we call earth, if you ask me… Y’all remember the story of Moses? C’mon, speak up.”

  “Yes sir…” Came the mumbled replies. Patrick just grinned.

&#x200B;

  “Moses…” He repeated, “One day while Moses was tending to his flock, he came across a cave much like this one. And inside that cave… Inside that cave he found something wondrous. A bush that was on fire, but didn’t burn… And when he went to look, a voice called out to him. The voice of the Lord. It told him to take off his sandals as the ground he stood upon was holy… Speaking of which…” He gestured to us, and I noticed the women beside me hastily taking off their shoes. I did the same. Patrick watched us for a few moments before he continued speaking.

&#x200B;

  “When the Lord appeared to Moses in the burning bush, he granted him purpose. He granted him salvation… And many years ago, when the Lord appeared to Father Abraham in this very cave… He granted him purpose. Salvation… Most of you have worked hard at your redemption…” He trailed off, glancing at me before he continued, “Your efforts have not gone unnoticed. And so, here you now stand… Some for the first time. Some not. The Lord waits for you inside that cave. Your judgment waits for you… For some of you, today might well be the day you rejoin Society. The way you were meant to. Today might be the first day of your salvation. Only the Lord can say for sure…”

&#x200B;

He looked over us, a half smile on his lips.

  “Who’s first?” He asked.

His gaze settled on one of the women, Melissa I think her name was. From the corner of my eye, I saw her tense up. Her breathing grew heavier and more erratic.

  “How about you?” He asked softly, “Melissa… Are you ready to gaze into the eyes of the Lord once more?”

  “N-no…” She rasped, “No… P-please don’t… Please don’t make me…”

  *“S-sh-sh-sh-sh- SHUT UP!”* Patrick snarled, mocking her terrified stammer, “Go… Face your judgment.”

&#x200B;

  “No!” Melissa said, tears streaming down her cheeks, “Please, don’t make me… I don’t want to.. Please no…”

Patrick took a step towards her and she recoiled from him, terrified tears streaming down her cheeks.

  “No, no, no, no…”

&#x200B;

Patrick’s eyes narrowed. Melissa held up her hands as if she were pleading with him. He didn’t say another word to her. In one smooth motion, he drew his pistol and fired a single shot into her head. Melissa’s frightened whimpers were suddenly cut short as she hit the ground with a heavy thud.

&#x200B;

The sudden, final pop of the gunshot made me flinch. I looked down at Melissa’s corpse with wide, terrified eyes. Her cheeks were still wet with her tears as she stared lifelessly up at the sky with glazed, empty eyes. Blood trickled out of the perfect hole in the center of her skull. Her hands still twitched… But she was gone.

&#x200B;

  “Salvation is a choice.” Patrick said, his voice cool and calm as if he hadn’t just put a bullet in a womans head, “And that choice is always yours.”

The gun rested comfortably in his hand as he looked over at us.

  “Who’s next?” He asked.

A middle aged brunette from our lineup anxiously stepped forward. I think that was Sandra.

  “A volunteer…” Patrick said, “Good… Walk. Into the cave. We’ll see if your soul can yet be saved.”

&#x200B;

Sandra just meekly nodded before quietly walking towards the darkness of the cave. Her pace was slow and anxious. She stared into that darkness and hesitated for a moment before forcing herself inside.

&#x200B;

Then there was silence. 

&#x200B;

The minutes drifted by. Patrick stared into the darkness of the cave, before letting out a dry, harsh chuckle.

  “Well…” He said, “Who’s next?”

&#x200B;

His eyes settled on Rachael. His head tilted slightly to the side.

  “How about you?”

I heard Rachael’s breath catch in her throat. She looked at me, and I could see her struggling to speak for a moment before she closed her eyes and nodded.

&#x200B;

  “Y-yes sir…” She said quietly. She took a deep breath before stepping forward. I watched as she walked silently into the cave, just like Sandra had before her. I saw her hesitate for a moment before she too plunged into that darkness.

&#x200B;

Several minutes passed, carrying with them a heavy silence. I watched the cave with bated breath, hoping to whatever God there was that I’d see something.

And unlike Sandra, I did.

&#x200B;

A figure in white slowly shuffled out of the darkness of the cave. It was Rachael… Or… It looked like Rachael…

&#x200B;

I felt my heart swell for a moment when I saw her, but as she stumbled out of the cave, I immediately noticed something was wrong with her. Trails of blood streamed out of her eyes. She swayed unevenly on her feet, collapsing at one point before picking herself up. Her eyes were wide and stared sightlessly ahead.

&#x200B;

At the sight of her, Patrick broke into a knowing grin.

  “Salvation!” He cried, “So you have been saved, Sister!”

Rachael didn’t respond. She just blindly shuffled forward back towards the shrine. I could hear something gurgling in her throat. The sight of her… Oh God… It made me feel sick to my stomach. As she reached the shrine, she finally collapsed onto her hands and knees. She gagged and choked before vomiting up blood. Patrick put a hand on her shoulder, crouching down beside her.

&#x200B;

  “Easy sister, easy… It hurts, I know… It hurts… But let the sin bleed out of you… Let the Lord in…”

Rachael’s shoulders shook as she vomited again before her body went limp. Patrick caught her as she fell. For a moment, the only indicator that she was even still alive was the slow rise and fall of her chest. Patrick looked up at us, grinning from ear to ear.

  “Do you see it? THIS is salvation! This is purification! Do you see it?”

&#x200B;

Both the other girl. Bianca and I stared in quiet horror at Rachael as she wheezed and trembled. Her skin had gone several shades paler. She didn’t look saved, she looked like she was just about dead!

&#x200B;

God… What was in that fucking cave?

&#x200B;

Bianca went next, inching forward toward the darkness with tears in her eyes. Like Rachael, she came out several minutes later, swaying drunkenly and covered in blood. But unlike Rachael, who had emerged with a deathly silence, Bianca sobbed like a child, wandering like a lost toddler when she emerged. Patrick just regarded her with quiet disgust.

  “Unworthy…” He said quietly, “For now…”

&#x200B;

He paid Bianca no more mind, letting her stumble blindly out of the cave. His attention was on me now.

  “Let’s see if you fare better…” He said quietly.

My heart seized up in my chest.

&#x200B;

  “Well?” Patrick asked, “Personally I’d say it’s an honor to be shown the cave so soon… You haven’t worked long or hard enough to have earned your judgment. Not by a long shot… But for Joel’s sake… For the family’s sake, I’m giving you your chance. You gonna waste it?”

&#x200B;

A million answers to that question popped up in my mind but I didn’t have the strength to say any of them. The gun still rested in Patrick's hand and even though he wasn’t pointing it at me… He might as well have been. I looked down at Melissa’s corpse again. I could see a fly already crawling across her open, empty eyes… And I felt my skin crawl at the visceral sight of her death.

&#x200B;

The woods were silent.

&#x200B;

I was well enough alone.

&#x200B;

Either way… I was probably dead…

&#x200B;

I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and took a step toward the cave. The darkness loomed ever closer to me, swallowing me up. I took one last look at Patrick as he waited by the shrine. He watched me closely, his expression hard to read.

&#x200B;

No going back. No running. No escape. Only two different ways to die. If I was brave, I would’ve tried to run and let Patrick shoot me.

&#x200B;

But if I was brave, if I was smart, if I was anything, I would’ve left this place two weeks ago.

&#x200B;

I entered the cave.

&#x200B;

The inside was so dark, I could see nothing ahead of me. There was a sickly sweet stink of decay inside that made me gag. My bare feet shuffled forward a half step at a time. I felt my toes touch something that felt like flesh and my skin crawled. A vivid mental image of Sandra’s face crossed my mind and I felt sick to my stomach again. I wanted to turn back and run. But I could barely move as it was.

&#x200B;

I remained stock still, my feet cold against the stone, my muscles tense, and my body sore. I could feel tears trickling down my cheeks…

&#x200B;

And then I saw it.

&#x200B;

Somewhere deeper in the cave. Somewhere in the distance.

&#x200B;

Something bright.

&#x200B;

Something luminous.

&#x200B;

I stared at it, wondering what it was for a moment, trying to make sense of it. And as I did, I realized it was getting closer.

&#x200B;

No… Not closer…

&#x200B;

Brighter.

&#x200B;

The brightness came from all around. It illuminated the cave. Illuminated the corpse of Sandra by my feet, her eyes open and staring vacantly up at me, crimson blood dribbling out of her ears, her eyes, her mouth. It illuminated the sunken rotting faces of the other corpses. The skeletal remains of the other unworthy. I couldn’t help but look at them, at their rotten carcasses and I couldn’t help but know that soon I would rot with them in this darkness. Soon I would join them in this nothingness…

&#x200B;

The light grew brighter and I knew that somehow it was alive… The light burned my eyes and I heard myself screaming from somewhere far away before…

&#x200B;

Nothing…

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I woke up to the sensation of water being dumped onto my face. I gasped and started to cough, spitting up the water that had gone down my throat. I could taste blood in my mouth again and I rolled onto my side, curling into the fetal position. I could see open sky above me, and the corpse of Melissa nearby.

&#x200B;

I was back at the shrine.

&#x200B;

Patrick stood over me, looking down at me with disgust. I looked at him, my muscles tensing in fear as I waited for him to move.

  “Thought as much…” He said quietly, “The Impure can’t really stand before this sort of thing…  Spend too long in the light of the Lord, and your body can’t handle it. Purification can be a painful process… Didn’t think you were up for it, but Joel insisted…” He scoffed and shook his head.

&#x200B;

  “Well… The truly wicked are slain in His sight. You’re still alive. Suppose that counts for something. Not much, but something… But if it were anyone else, I would’ve left you to your fate.”

He left me lying on the ground as he headed back for the truck.

  “Pick yourself up, Sinner. Get some rest. And be thankful. Tomorrow’s Sunday.”

&#x200B;

I could see Bianca wandering just past the truck and Patrick went to collect her. It took me a few minutes to pick myself up. I pressed a hand to my face and when I pulled it away, I could see the watered down blood that trickled out of my eyes.

&#x200B;

My head throbbed.

&#x200B;

My body ached.

&#x200B;

But I wasn’t dead.

&#x200B;

Not yet…

&#x200B;

Slowly, I dragged myself back to the truck so that Patrick could take me back to my cabin.
