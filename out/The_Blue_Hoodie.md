I was skipping school today, didn't really feel like going, so I decided to walk around the town centre for a bit before heading off, my parents had no idea I secretly called in sick so going home wasn't an option. 

I remembered me and my friends would visit this old bridge over a river, it was unstable so it was blocked off so no vehicles would pass, people could come and go all they like, it was next to just a regular path people often walked on or walked their dogs on. I needed to burn time so I thought I'd just head over and skip some rocks, walk around until time came.

Across the bridge there were 2 paths you could take, on the left was a gravel/grass path leading to a farm and onwards to God knows where, and on the right a path to a field. The right path was super muddy and groggy, as it was just an opening in a load of trees.

I walk across the bridge n look down the path and I see a person pop out and start running, he's running towards me, not in a scary way but he's running and he looks exhausted. He runs past and looks over at me as he passes then disappears from my line of view.

I decide to then head down that groggy path, I walk along, recording some videos for my friends to watch then I realise how eerily silent it was, no birds, no bugs, only my feet squelching in the mud and the faint rush of the rivers water, had me feeling weird but nothing serious, so I keep going.

A good minute of walking later I see the weirdest thing, a baby blue coloured hoodie hanging from a tree, it was weird because of how the colour contrasted the green and brown but what else is odd is how clean it was, this was a muddy path and it had just been raining, the silent hadn't gone away, it was still just me, the mud and the water.

The more I look at the hoodie the more unease I begin to feel, thats when I get the feeling that I'm being watched by something, it was so sudden and onset that it terrified me.

As soon as I felt the adrenaline hit I just booked it, caking my shoes in mud as I almost slipped several times. I get back to the bridge and just stand on it, recovering, it was the most terrifying experience I'd experienced and I hadn't even seen anything.

I had burned some time but there was still a lot left so I called up my friends and decided I'd go back with them down that path, and so we did, walking along the mud, trying not to get too caked in the stuff.

What completely unsettled me was the fact that this time around, the blue hoodie hung in the tree was nowhere to be seen.

P.S. let me know what you all think happened, I didn't see anything myself but this was super unsettling.
