“You alright, May?”

“Yeah, I think so, I just-” Pain stabbed me—like a knife was sunk deep into my brain. “Agh!” 

“I told you you’d get a headache.” Mary said, walking over to my desk. “Go sit in the conference room, the dark will help. I’ll get you some Advil.” 

“Thanks…” I replied, removing my gloves and lab coat and heading over to the conference room. I felt dizzy. I held my right eye closed as I walked; having it open wasn’t helping. There was an undulating shape in the corner of my vision, making it hard to see and causing that sharp pain in my head. I got to the conference room and sat down in one of the leather chairs. What the hell was it called again? We were just talking about it during break.

“Those ocular migraines suck, huh?” Mary walked in, a cup of water in one hand and pills in the other. “I get them from time to time. Must be from looking at that computer screen for so long.” 

I took the pills and chased them down with the water. “Yeah,” I replied, “I’ve only had this happen once or twice to me before. I never got to the headache part though. I'd usually just lay down for 20 minutes and be fine.”

“Might be you’re just getting older.” Mary chuckled. “Things like this happen more as you age. You know how bad my knees are.” She smiled at me. “Take as long as you need, kid, I can send someone to cover you.”

I nodded and mumbled a thank you as I held my eyes shut. Having them closed helped a lot. She was right about getting older. I had started to find white hairs in the morning. Not even gray, just full on white. Hell, I was only 25. I thought I’d have to wait longer for that. 

I opened my eyes. The ocular migraine was fading fast, at least. The large, pulsating shape that had taken over the right side of my vision was now nothing more than a small dot that faded more with each passing second. I got up and stretched before heading back into the lab. 

The bright fluorescent lights probably weren’t helping. I made a mental note to look into blue light glasses; anything to prevent those migraines. I sat down at my desk and was getting ready to work again when I coughed. An explosion of eye floaters engulfed my vision. Squiggly little lines danced around for a moment, floating all around under they began to dissipate a few moments later. Great. I remembered hearing somewhere that those get worse with age too.

I began to get back to work. Accessioning specimens was an easy job. It was just preparing specimens for the real lab work, mostly. It was something I could get stuck into if I wasn't careful. Something I may have already gotten trapped in. It wasn’t exactly what I wanted to do with my life; it wasn't what I went to school for. There was still time, I thought, I could still do other stuff. How long had I been here…two years? I’d get out soon. I’d do something I really wanted to do, like-

And that’s when I noticed it. Right in the middle of my train of thought. One of those eye floaters I had was still there in the corner of my vision. Perfectly still. I found that very strange; I’d usually only catch them for a second, overlaid on my vision, fading as fast as they appeared and moving. I had never seen one stay in the same place for this long— or even stay around this long at all. 

How long had it been, exactly? Was it there since I sat down and coughed? Even longer? Or had it just shown up now? I couldn’t tell. 

I tried to focus on my work. I would just get through the shift and sleep it off. Sleep would work, right? It would reset my eyes or something? I didn’t know, I just hoped. I tried to ignore it. I was able to, mostly. But it was always there, sitting in the corner of my vision.

It was multiple lines, squished together. Three long floaters spread out and converged into a single one that tailed it off. It was always just there. I could swear that I saw it move when I had my focus off of it. The entire shape didn’t move, no, but a slight twitch of a tendril, maybe. 

I somehow finished my shift. Needless to say, it was extremely hard to get work done, but I somehow did it. Driving home was even worse. I had to use my full attention on the road, had to ignore the microscopic movements the thing in the corner of my vision was performing. I *knew* it was moving when I wasn’t focusing on it.

I skipped dinner when I got home. I had lost my appetite anyway. I figured the darkness of my bedroom would help my eyes. Yes, they must just be overworked. Rest would do them good. I laid in bed and listened to some audio dramas on my phone until I felt tired enough to sleep. 

My sleep was restless. I stood in a wasteland, orange sand at my feet. A temple of unknowable design lay half-sunken in the sand. A storm was brewing; even in my dream-state I could feel the coarse sand whipped up by the wind cut into my skin. Perched on an eroded, sand shredded mesa was what seemed to be a bird. It faced me and took to the air. 

It wasn’t a bird. 

It was bird-like, sure, but as it got closer my mind started to scream. My dream self was paralyzed. Something about it was *wrong*. The beak too long, the face with only skin and feathers where eyes should have been, the talons that stretched and flexed in unnatural ways as it flew. It looked at me with its eyeless face as it flew towards me. It was still looking at me as it lifted its body up and aimed its talons at me, swooping in for the kill. 

I shot awake, drenched in sweat. My heart stopped. It was next to me. Working on pure adrenalin, I swung my arm and smashed it into the empty space on the bed next to me. I blinked in confusion. No, it wasn’t next  to me. It was that eye floater. The shape of it looked a lot like that bird’s claw. 

I frowned. The floater was still there. Sleep didn’t help. I called out of work that day and made a rush appointment with an eye doctor. I swore I could see that floater change as the day went on. I’d catch it twitching while I was making breakfast, growing while I drove to my appointment. It was when I was sitting in the eye doctor’s waiting room that I realized it was getting clearer. 

I could make out detail in the transparent shape now. Little horizontal lines, going up and down the tendrils. It gained a color at the ends: yellow, like a bird’s talon.

It couldn’t be. That was a dream, the thing couldn’t come out of my dream. That didn’t make sense. And yet…the sinking feeling in my gut began to grow. 

The doctor found nothing physically wrong with my eyes. She strongly suggested that I go to a hospital; that this could indicate a problem with my brain. I thanked her. It was a good idea.

I drove to the emergency room and explained my issues. The weeks of bills would be a pain to deal with, but it would be worth it to get this *thing* out of my vision. It was about an hour till they were ready for me. They wheeled me down to the imaging lab, to a room with a big machine. 

They had me close my eyes as I went in. I was back in the wasteland. Same location. Same mesa ahead of me. Same bird. The scene repeated. It looked at me without eyes and took flight. There was a horrible screeching as it flew; a tearing in the air, like nails on chalkboard. It got into its hunting position as it swooped down. The vision didn’t end. That horrible talon pierced me. It went straight through my eye. I could feel it, working its way deeper, grabbing onto my brain, squeezing. 

I woke. I was back, not in the imaging room, but in a hospital room. A nurse came in. She said I must have been exhausted, that I fell asleep during the scan. I’d get the results soon, but the doctors were already recommending I stay overnight. You could never be too careful with the brain, after all. 

I was terrified. I could still feel it, still feel that things talons grasped around my brain. With each stab of pain in my head my vision would explode. Large masses would appear and fade within seconds; undulating while light would blind me. But the worst was that eye floater. It was still there, in the same position as always. It was more clear now. It *was* that things talon, exactly like the dream. And now there was a blurry mass behind it.

I’m still terrified. That thing gets closer, clearer as I sleep. There's no way I’d be able to avoid sleep here; the hospital would make sure that I got my rest. I don’t know why this is happening to me. The worst part is I don’t know how to stop it. It’ll catch up to me eventually.
