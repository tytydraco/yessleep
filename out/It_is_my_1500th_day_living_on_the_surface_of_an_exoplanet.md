Series of notes made from piths of alien plants were discovered next to a corpse later identified as Basile Clark.  
The notes, written with vine charcoal, document the man's predicament, they read as follows:  


"I am Basile Clark, It is my 1500th day living on the surface of an exoplanet.  
I made myself a calendar inside my refuge, or a home.  
Atleast I think of it as my home now.

Military took up most of my life as a younger man, then I became an astronaut later on.  
With new cryogenic technology, we set our spaceship on autopilot.  
We were heading towards an earth-like exoplanet lightyears away from our solar system.

The trip would've taken us approximately 1000 years, so we went inside the cryochambers and for the next millenia, our world went dark.  
Before landing, we awoke due to a malfunction that I am too underqualified to explain and the spaceship crashed on the surface of the planet, leaving only me alive.

My first day was a nightmare, I was scared and desperately trying to find a shelter. I find a cave in which I would live for the next 4 years, and start a fire through friction.  
The next few days, I started studying the organisms, and which would be the easiest to kill and eat.

The planet only had bug-like lifeforms, the biggest and the meanest creature here was almost half my size.  
The first creature I ate was a strange one. It's back had a texture of a tree bark, which acted as an armor, it's underbelly was vulnerable. I flipped the creature on it's back and stabbed it with a knife I sculpted out of some sort of flint rock that I found.

These things always made me constipated until my stomach got used to them, and it's the only thing I ate for the last four years of living here.  
As for the water, I didn't want to take a gamble and drink it without purifying it first.  
After a few days, I tried to improve my living conditions. I foraged for soft leaves, and scattered them on the ground of my cave. Next, I carved myself a miniature chair and a table.

I was satisfied with how my new home was looking, and I left it at that.  
My daily routine was to find water, food and keep myself warm. It's what kept me busy all these years.  
I never strayed too far from my cave, which was surrounded by a forest of alien-like trees.  
Entertainment was very minimal, and I was extremely bored. As far as survival situations go, I was very lucky and pretty much got it made.

Nothing posed much of a threat to me, but I was a potential threat to everything. I terrorized every organism near me with my presence, everything ran from me.  
I was at the top of the food chain in this new ecosystem.

What killed me was a lack of human contact, on the flipside. I knew I was going to die here, alone and bored.  
With a two-ply yarn, I made myself a noose to kill myself with, but changed my mind at the last moment.  
I am writing this because I fear my death is coming soon.

I overestimated my position in the ecosystem here.  
I won't be a pretty corpse if I am found. I am haggard, what's left of my pants, well, they are no longer pants, more like a loin-cloth, and I look like a homeless man. My body is torn to shreds and I feel like I am going to bleed to death.

This day, I strayed too far from my cave, and went to explore the woods. I saw a new creature, once again, a bug-like organism, green in color like a praying mantis and about the size of a miniature dog. It stood and walked on hind legs.  
I killed it with a rock, what I didn't know is that it was actually a baby, and it's parent was near. I was confronted with a creature that stood as tall as a man, however, skinnier, with longer limbs that ended with three sickle-shaped claws.

With inadequate weapons, I fought and defended myself. Everytime I struck a blow, the creature didn't relent and kept on attacking me with fury and desperation.  
I won a pyrrhic victory, and made my way back to my home.  
I write this while dying, my only wish is if someone finds me, I hope they take my body out of here, and bury me with a closed casket."

The man was buried upon his request back to earth. Few of planet's specimens were captured and brought back to earth for research. A carved analemma on the cave wall was used to mark days throughout the year.

Worn and old hand-made furniture was found inside the cave, with left-over food inside a damp burlap bag.  
Stone tools were found, including a stone knife made from a rock homologous to flint and a stone axe.
