Hello, my name is Tim√©o, I am French, and yes, I have been followed.

It was a Thursday, in the middle of sixth grade. An ordinary day, with equally ordinary lessons. That day, as often, I finished at 3:20 p.m. I wasn't on the same schedule as my classmates, so I walked home alone. My college was about twenty minutes from my house. I was used to this journey. I passed through small streets, a park, and especially an old rusty bridge over a stream that I always found a little sinister.

That Thursday, when I left school, I was absorbed in my phone. I had my headphones on, listening to a podcast without paying much attention to my surroundings. But when I arrived at the bridge, I noticed something unusual: a person was there, motionless, in the middle of the path. I stopped for a moment, a little surprised. There was never anyone there at this time.

This person had purple hair, which immediately stood out to me. I thought maybe he was a student, or just someone eccentric. Nothing to worry about. I continued on my way, ignoring him. But after a few meters, I felt uncomfortable. As if someone was watching me. I glanced behind me...and this person had turned around. She was now walking in my direction. Straight towards me.

My heart beating a little faster, I quickened my pace. My bag weighed on my shoulders, and I tried to convince myself that I was paranoid. But thirty meters later, I turned around again. This time, there was no more doubt: she was running. She was chasing me.

I took to my legs, running with all my strength. My breath was getting short, but I couldn't stop. I had never been so scared. My thoughts raced: who was this person? Why me? What did she want? Every noise behind me made me jump.

Finally, I saw my portal. My heart almost exploded in my chest. I opened it quickly and ran back inside, slamming the door behind me. I went straight upstairs to my little brother's room. It was closer, more accessible than mine.

Once inside, I glanced out the window, hoping it was all over.

But no.

The person was there. Right across the street. Motionless. She was looking at me. Always.

I froze. It was not a simple coincidence. This person had crossed the city to follow me, to come to my house. And she did nothing but stare at me.

She stayed there for many minutes. Maybe ten. Maybe more. Then she ended up walking away. Without a word. Without a gesture.

Since that day, I never walk without looking behind me. I no longer listen to music when I'm alone outside. I always check to see if anyone is following me. And above all, I will never forget that frozen gaze fixed on me, as if I were the only thing that existed in the world.

I was 11 years old. And I was followed.
