Hey guys.
My step-brother Jeremy is gone. I don't know where he went, but I've been going through his old computer. Nobody has seen him in weeks and a few days after he went missing I decided to try and figure out for myself what the hell happened. I pulled what I could from his PC to try and piece things together. The police are not taking this seriously at all.

I'll be posting files from his computer when I find things that may make sense of where he went. His last known location was on a flight to Nepal. I can't make sense of that at all. He never bought a return flight. I'll post below a text version of some documentation I found on his computer. If you want to read his last note he left open on his desktop you can find it in my previous posts on this account. Anyway, here's that document I found below. It was in a folder full of documents with random numbers as file names, and the folder was just called "Jerome". Next time I post I'll try and give more information on the file and where it came from. Thanks y'all.

MASTER INFORMATION FILE DESIGNATION:

Jerome Millhouse Newton

ALL AVAILABLE PERSONAL LOG ENTRIES:

June 27th 1977:
Assigned to project 04167743, AKA Project LIGHTBOX

Briefed lightly on subject matter on project. Film roll discovery from 1924 Mount Everest Expedition may contain sensitive information overlapping with project [REDACTED].

[ALL FOLLOWING FILES SUBJECT TO REDACTION]

Daily Log, June 28th 1977:

I've dealt in anomalies in the past. This project seems to be of utmost importance. I believe I was assigned to this project based on my previous experience testing evidence of unexplained anomalies in project [REDACTED] and project [REDACTED] where we tested unusual trinitite samples in the Nevada desert. Typically trinitite is left behind when sand is fused into glass via incredible heat. and most commonly due to atomic blasts. Trinitite typically contains high levels of radioactive isotopes.

We investigated trinitite samples that appeared to be much older than anticipated. Approximately 10,000 years based on our findings of isotope ratios. Our test results were accepted, banked and we were sent home.

I've been informed that my personal logs will be examined after this project is terminated.

I've been informed that this project is long term. It will be years until we can proceed at the correct location, with proper precautions taken, and with correct personnel. Given the delicate nature of what could be on this film roll and the implications the photos could reveal, it is important we select DISPOSABLE PERSONNEL to carry out the development procedure. Advanced psychological evaluation techniques will be discreetly deployed to select perfect candidates.

QUALIFYING TRAITS OF SELECTED PERSONNEL INCLUDE:

Amicability/obedience/suggestibility
Low capability of physical resistance
Lack of military training
High understanding of chemical processes, specifically in regard to film development techniques
History of schizoaffective disorder, either personal or genetic
Lack of social skills and/or delicate home life
Previous unprosecuted legal trouble (leverage)

PERSONNEL CANDIDATES MUST INCLUDE ALL TRAITS DESIGNATED, AND MUST REACH ALL APPROVAL METRICS BEFORE CONTINUATION WITH PROJECT LIGHTBOX.

Other logs notwithstanding to this project will be stored elsewhere. Project LIGHTBOX will all be discussed in this log.

HIGH ENERGY CONTAINMENT FIELD UNIT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

After 4 years of permissions, we are finally able to cross reference information gathered from Project KV31 involving Low Proximity Magnetic Distortion Systems.

Incredible progress has been made by ASYNC in this sector and our surveillance or their work has been vital to the continuation of project LIGHTBOX. Our field operatives have collected enough build plans and anomalous materials to begin construction of a self sustaining nuclear power coupler capable of creating Low Proximity Magnetic Distortion Systems. This will facilitate storage of our Everest samples in a location that is [REDACTED] securely.
All other information on ASYNC is HIGHLY SENSISTIVE and existence of further research not pertaining to our current storage solution has been wiped.
