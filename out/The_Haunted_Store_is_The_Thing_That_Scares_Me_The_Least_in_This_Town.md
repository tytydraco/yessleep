Hi everyone, Jake here. I know I've been gone for a while, but I'll try to catch you up on the past week. Things around here are totally crazy, not just the workload but also some weird stuff. Before I dive in, I want to thank everyone who has been following this story and providing tips and messages of support. It means a lot to me. ( You can read the Part 4 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/18191nn/the_sheriff_in_my_town_has_hair_bleach_and_more/))

As I mentioned before, Gonzales came to my house to tell me about Dave's death. I was shocked and incredulous because I had seen him just a short time before at the store. Gonzales explained that when he arrived to open the store, he found the door ajar, lights flickering, and an unusual silence. Upon entering, he encountered the shocking scene: Dave was on the floor, pale, eyes open in a vacant stare, with strange marks around him. At least this time it wasn't a can; the police found no clues and declared it as sudden death. Seeing Dave's mother crying at the funeral broke my heart. I offered my condolences and hugged her tightly; she's an elderly lady who didn't deserve to go through this. I wonder what would have happened if I had swapped places with Dave that shift, or maybe, upon reflection, if I hadn't put the meat there... yeah, it made sense; maybe my offering at the office had "invited" the creature, and Dave, unaware of the special rules, violated something.

This thought started to gnaw at me bit by bit; the guilt was unbearable, and I had to talk to Gonzales about it. I decided to go to work early to have time to discuss it. I put on my uniform and started my walk to clear my head. As I approached, I could see Sheriff talking to the Chief inside the store. Don't get me wrong; I'm not a busybody, but after everything, I decided to sneak up, crouching and approaching the window slowly. I caught the conversation halfway through.

Gonzales: It wasn't supposed to be Dave, Butch. The store is acting on its own!

Butch: Look, the store got what it wanted, right? Just because it changed the order of things doesn't mean we need to panic.

Gonzales: It's the first time this has happened... It must really like Jake.

Butch: We'll see about that.

I accidentally stumbled on an empty beer bottle on the ground, making noise. They both stopped. The Sheriff turned and began walking slowly towards me; I started moving towards the back of the store, but he was almost at a point where he could see me. I was just a few inches away, and I could already see the brim of his hat and his eyebrows when one of the lights inside the store burst, making him turn, and Gonzales jumped.

Butch: Haha, this damn thing is playing with us. It knows we're talking about it... You know, Beth, I always admired that stubbornness in you, that... indomitable spirit made everything more fun.

He tapped the wall twice.

I backed away and arrived 10 minutes later, casual. I greeted both of them and said I needed to talk to Gonzales alone.

Gonzales: You can speak up, young man, I have nothing to hide from old Butch.

Me: Well... it's about Dave... I put meat in the office that night, thought I was protecting him.

Butch approached me, chewing tobacco, and got so close I could smell the smoky scent coming from his mouth.

Butch: Look, Jake, it's not your fault; the store is sometimes mysterious. Don't worry about it.

He put his hand on my shoulder.

Butch: You've got potential; maybe when old Gonzales retires, you could even take his place.

Me: No, no, you're exaggerating, sir.

Gonzales: Can't deny it, kid. The store likes you, and I've been thinking about retiring for a while now.

Butch's radio beeped.

Butch: Gentlemen, duty calls.

He left, and after a few minutes of conversation, Gonzales did the same. The night went on without many problems, and, truth be told, no special rules needed to be followed. No lights, no strangers, nothing. It was around midnight when I heard a low and sinister laugh echoing through the store. I turned around, and there, in the dark aisle, was a familiar figure: the strange one with the hat. My legs hesitated before taking a step back. The figure advanced slowly, revealing glowing eyes. His hair looked even more unkempt, and he ran his hand over his stubble. His shadow danced with joy, moving from one shelf to another, now completely independent of his body.

Stranger: Beth knows you heard about her.

Me: W-Who?

Stranger: Don't play dumb... it's ugly to do that after the mess she saved you from earlier. Butch doesn't like snoops.

He reached into his coat and pulled out a USB drive violently, making me think he was armed, and I recoiled in fear. Before I could react, he disappeared, as if he had never been there. The lights stopped flickering, and the store returned to its usual silence.

Nothing else happened that night. I was counting the minutes to go home and see what was on the device. I almost flew out the door when Gonzales arrived (he was covering the morning shift while the issue with Dave was still being resolved).

Back home, I inserted the device and found some strange, minimal things. I couldn't copy or extract them; they seemed to have some encoding, so I'll just describe them: Some old photos of someone I now assume is Butch, him with slaves, next to hanged people in the Civil War, with hooded figures wearing pointed hats, and the most disturbing of all: He was standing, smiling sadistically while holding the chain that restrained a young slave girl. She had a gag and deep marks all over her body. She looked at the camera with profound hatred, conveying her disgust with the situation. This was just one of the folders. In another, there was a compilation of newspaper articles since the 1950s about young people dying in the store, even before Gonzales. The last names of the sheriffs involved in the investigation were obviously the same: Cornwell. It also included headlines of accidents that "killed" Butch's predecessors, Levi Cornwell (the grandfather), and Josiah Cornwell (the great-grandfather). I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

I started writing this post for about 10 minutes until my heart almost had an attack: through the window behind me, allowing sunlight in, there was a shadow. A human, male shadow, with a hat, standing. I didn't know how long that person had been there, and by the hat, I could guess who it was... The shadow started moving. I saw it slowly going to the door, his silhouette passing, while walking, I saw him taking a rifle from his back, loading ammunition, and putting it in. He stopped when he reached the door. Two knocks, hard and dry. Silence... Two more knocks. Suddenly, my phone vibrates, a message from Butch:

"Hey Jake, are you home? I need to talk to you; I found another batch of beers at home close to expiration, and I need to get rid of them, if you know what I mean, haha."

&#x200B;

UPDATE: he sent a new message: "Well, unfortunately I can't wait long, I'm going to go into your kitchen to leave some cans on your counter, just letting you know so you don't get scared if you're at home"
