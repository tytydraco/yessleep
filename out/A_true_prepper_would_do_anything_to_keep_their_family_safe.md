The sounds of explosions and gunfire rumbled through the walls of the bunker.

It was now 4am. Surrounded by shelves of supplies, books and board games, I watched my wife and kids huddle together in the low-light.

*“It’s going to be okay…”*

Several hours had passed since I’d hauled them out of bed. The “early warning” alarms had triggered not long after midnight.

It had scared them, the fact that I was holding a rifle, but worse must’ve been the look on my face. Mid-evacuation, I’d caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror in Jenna’s room. My face was a mask of pure panic.

*“Dad, wuss goin’ on?”*

*“You’re scaring us…”*

*“Is this another fucking drill, Steve…?!”*

This was not their first rodeo. I’d been prepping them for this moment their whole lives.

“We need to get out, *NOW!”*

Instinctively, they’d known where to go. But the mood changed once everyone was down there; once the door of the bunker was sealed shut.

Confusion reigned.

There were lots of tears and shouting.

Then the atmosphere became febrile.

*“I’m not fucking around!”* I had to shout. *This wasn’t a fucking drill - this was it: the moment when everything changed.* “Get your shit together!”

Then, there was silence.

Pete, my eldest, looked concerned.

Jenna, my daughter, stared blankly at her signal-less phone.

My wife, Sue, just seemed shocked. “But there was *nothing* in the news…” she mouthed.

“Course not,” I stated matter-of-factly. “I said there wouldn’t be.”

“No emergency broadcast…”

“You were asleep,” I explained. “None of that kicks in until after anyway…”

“Until after what?” Jenna asked.

“Until after something’s…*happened*, sweetie,” I sighed, pulling her in close.

Sue shook her head.

The sounds of explosions punctuated the brief silence that followed, despite the bunker being 30-feet underground

“Not so crazy now, am I?” I grizzled, as much to myself as to anyone else.

After all these years prepping for the worst, I felt vindicated. I’d warned them that this day was coming, not that anyone had believed me. And *definitely* not Sue.

“I’m just glad we’re all down here. *Together*,” I sighed. “I can’t keep you safe up there."

Truth be told, the family had been experiencing a torrid time of late.

The plant I worked at had royally fucked me over recently, cutting my hours - and our finances - in half. It’d been bought by some multinational conglomerate bollocks, which had preceded a round of “efficiencies”. Jobs were being cut left, right and centre; and where there were no cuts, there was just redundancies.

Pete, on the other hand, was being bullied at school *again*. He was smart, dorky, short for his age, which made him a target for some reason, as is often the case. But he was a *good* kid. Funny. He just needed a break.

Jenna was following the path of *most* resistance, seemingly. She had an anxiety disorder that inhibited her from making even the most basic of decisions. She refused to go to school. Refused to eat. Spent all her time scrolling, scrolling…

She barely interacted with anyone anymore… It was no life.

*And then there was Sue.* My wife of nearly 30-years, who avoided me like the plague. Our relationship had been awful for the best part of a decade at this point. When she wasn’t working, *or pretending to work*, she’d been having an affair - or so it’d turned out. But we’d been to counseling; we’d “worked things out”. Her excuse was that she’d wanted to “feel something again”, but I was fairly certain that she’d hoped I would divorce her off the back of it. Force my hand. Make me the bad guy.

But I didn’t want to…

Despite everything, I still loved her.

A tear stung my eye as I twisted the cap off a bottle of still water.

Almost wistfully, I found myself thinking of simpler times… Of snacky, boisterous board game nights in front of the fire, of everyone laughing and joking.

We used to play UNO a lot. The kids loved it.

Often things got heated - cards got thrown and sore losers would lash out - but we were in it *together*. It was real. Fun. Messy. You’d find little kernels of popcorn buried in the hearth rug for days after…

But all that felt like a *lifetime* ago.

That was real quality time together, though.

Of late, it had just been screens and…*vitriol*.

*Every cloud*, I thought, staring at the shelves against the walls, each one stacked with games and DVDs and books.

Real stuff. Physical stuff.

No doubt, once everyone had adjusted to their new reality, we would get back to that.

“Anyone hungry?” I asked.

This suggestion was greeted with an abject, almost total silence.

“Just me then…”

Wandering through to the bunker’s kitchenette, I took out my old MP3 player and started prepping a sandwich. On the lock screen was a selfie of the family all together, taken years ago. We all looked…*happy*.

*We’d needed to simplify. Regain control*.

Scrolling, I changed the track from “12 hours of close combat sounds ASMR 4K” to “Occasional Explosions and Light Thunder Cinematic Mix | 10 Hours”.

Then, I unlocked a wall panel and released a hidden valve that would let a trickle of homemade chlorine gas out.

*It needed to feel real,* I thought. *To sustain the illusion.*

*“DAD?!”* Pete coughed, as the gas began to filter through the bunker’s vents.

I took a steadying breath. Grabbing four gas masks, I rushed back into the main quarters.

“Don’t worry!” I said calmly, handing out the masks.

Sue looked horrified. Her hands were shaking.

Kneeling, I helped tighten the strap on her mask. Then she smiled at me warmly. Like she used to, almost.

I felt seen. *Alive*. More alive in that moment than I had done in years.

*“Everything’s going to be alright…”*
