Last night was terrible, let me explain. After the facility incident, we were sat down and briefed about what was to come. Mostly everyone at the station was at the briefing. Listening, logging, and trying to understand what we saw inside.

&#x200B;

"How do we know there is only one of them?" One Scientist said. I never really thought about that until he said it. We couldn't take risks with something we know so little about.

&#x200B;

Our team leader spoke up about the comment. "That is why our researchers are gathering equipment for you all. It should be enough to defend against any threat within the facility." Long story short, all they gave us was elbow pads and a shitty Amazon plate carrier stuffed with whatever the hell they could find on site. Most, if not every remaining team member was pissed. Not to mention the already low rated gear we had, with barely working night vision. After briefing, they sent us to our sleeping quarters for the night. A bunch of freezing confused wannabe mercenaries shoved into 4 small tents, with those hand warmer things you'd find at the gas station. For a company who is funded by the fucking government, you'd expect a bigger budget for the only force keeping them alive from whatever the fuck they are trying to dig up.

&#x200B;

After dinner, we were told to sleep, and that we'd be woken up around 0400 for the second run into the facility. Nothing could have prepared us for what happened.

&#x200B;

It was 0420, myself and 6 other team members were assigned to a single group, and were getting geared up for the mission. The head researcher for the station told us we had helmet cams, and thermal sights for our weapons. With that in mind, I did feel a bit safer, although not by much. By 0450, we were back in the facility. Staring at the same vent, which was absolutely destroyed from the gun fire. That thing still burned into my memory. I can't help but thing it's still watching us, from somewhere.. The door at the very end of the room was dented pretty bad, just like the first door we went through. Our Team leader was messing around with the second door for a bit, before the red light above turned into the same green and blue color mix, followed by the buzzing sound. It startled me, and must have done the same to everyone else, as everyone's weapons were raised. Some towards the vent in the ceiling.

&#x200B;

An overwhelming sense of dread filled my body, as pitch blackness filled the doorway. Team leader shined his rail mounted flashlight into the void that presented itself in front of us, reveling an open room which was in very bad shape. From what we could see with the flashlight, the floors were this mossy square tile, looked like it was made from dark concrete. The walls were this tiled concrete, lighter in color. It was more like rectangles than squares, but still old and damaged looking. The ceiling looked to be made of some metal like tile. Like something on an ocean oil rig. It had three light fixtures, side by side, seemed broken, appear to have been that way for decades. Some water also dripping from them. One of the members Tim, volunteered to take the first step into what looked like Satan's summer house. I hesitantly follow behind him, carefully looking around, not wanting to meet our vent friend outside of the metal bars. Everyone else soon followed behind us, treading with caution. We quickly noticed that the room was actually a hub, housing 4 hallways that extended out in front of us, leading deeper into the facility. Team leader would report this on his radio, informing the researchers observing our cams. Tim thought it was a good idea for us to split into teams and explore the hallways. Telling us to report findings to one another, or if they see something.

I thought he was crazy, but our team leader enforced his idea, so we had no choice but to listen. Team leader, Tim and one other took the hall to the far left, Me and Steve were assigned to the center right hall, And two other guys were assigned to the far right. All together we walked down the halls, weapons at the ready. The adrenaline rush was nuts. The fear you felt while in there would be like staring death in the eyes, and calling him ugly. By that time our flashlights were off, and our night vision was the best option, as to not draw any unwanted attention. Every few minutes each team would report a turn, or an intersection. I started to feel uneasy by the amount of turns in the facility, but brushed it off after some convincing from my team mate.

&#x200B;

Not long after we began mapping out the halls, the researchers soon came to a conclusion that the facility we were moving through was some sort of maze. Hearing that sent chills throughout my body. A maze? This far underground? I mean, why would anyone civilization need a giant underground maze? The answers I had were to go coldly unanswered as we traveled deeper, and deeper into the facility. Around 20 minutes pass, and me and Steve could hear faint gun shots. I was losing it, telling Steve that we should go back, saying fuck this place, and we could be anywhere else than here. We heard shouts over the radio, and the panicked cries of our team leader and the two other team members. At this point I was slouched against a wall, listening to the radio, and trying to understand what was happening. Steve was talking to the researchers, trying to get information on the team. It took 3 minutes for the shots to stop. For everything to stop. No radio contact, no gunshots, no distant screams. Me and Steve were anxiously waiting for something to come over the radio, our night vision barely piercing the darkness as we sporadically look up and down the hall we were in.

&#x200B;

Suddenly we heard radio static. "Hello?! Can you hear us?!" Steve quickly shouted into his radio, my heart was beating a million miles per hour. His voice would come from our hallway, not as an echo, but as if it was him repeating himself, only a couple feet away. We both lock onto the noise, not saying a single word as we try and understand what we just heard. "Hello?" He said, the hallway voice still, and silent. I put my hand out, telling him to be quiet as I held down the transmit button on my radio, listening. I heard the static come from the same place in the hall. I went into shock, as my body went numb from fear. Steve slowly shined his light down the hallway towards whatever was in the darkness. There it was, the thing from the vent. The decaying nose, chewed off lips, it's gaping maw with the thousands of needle teeth in infinite rows stretching seemingly forever. It stood what looked to be 7 or 8 feet tall, right in front of us. It said something that made me want to vomit. "HelLo. CaN yOu HEaR mE?" Without hesitation, it started making this noise. It sounded like nails on a chalkboard, literally.

&#x200B;

Without time to register what happened. I fucking booked it. I didn't have time to scream, or think. I dropped my weapon, and ran.. I ran so fast, faster than I have ever ran in my life. I'm pretty sure Steve didn't even notice I was gone. I am certain he is dead, there was no sound, besides that thing. I just know something happened, in some way. The holes from last mission still fresh in its head. That is what I remember. I don't know if it's  the stress, but I could have swore it had this cartoony angry expression on it's.. well whatever was left of it's face. Something you would see out pf old cartoons. I ran for what seemed like hours before dashing through the first door, then the second. I crawled up that ladder faster than I ever have, and didn't look back. I ran to the head researcher, and screamed at them to shut the doors, and never open them. The things in that facility, was never meant to be discovered, and we made a VERY big mistake by doing so. I put in my resignation an hour before writing this, and should most likely be on a plane back home by the time this gets out. The Company I worked for is very shady, and I would not be surprised if they tried to cover something like this up. And something tells me this won't be the last.
