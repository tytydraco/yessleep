It was middle school and the release of Super Smash Bros Brawl was right around the corner. Sadly, my family was poor, and oftentimes I would have to wait until newer games became cheaper before I could get my hands on them. Normally, I didn't mind waiting. However, this was different. It had been seven years since the release of Melee and I was desperate not to miss out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I begged and pleaded with my parents to no avail. It seemed that I would have to resign myself to my horrible fate when two weeks before Brawl's release, I was approached by none other than the school rich kid, Richard Goldshire. Nobody liked him and while I didn't have many friends myself, at least I wasn't desperate enough to pay for them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"You're Leonard, correct?" he asked me as I was by myself eating lunch and playing on my GBA.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I looked it up at him. With him were some of his cronies.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"It's Lenny, actually," I said.

&#x200B;

"Yes," he dismissively replied. "I've heard around the school you are in want of a copy of Super Smash Bros Brawl?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The way he spoke was as if someone threw Remy Buxaplenty and Richard Texan in a blender. It was beyond grating to listen to, but I was willing to at least hear him out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Yeah, it'd be really cool if I could get my hands on one when it comes out."

&#x200B;

"Well, too bad you don't come from money."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He laughed alone, then glared at his lackeys. One elbowed another's ribs, and then they all laughed like Richie was the funniest person ever.  I was going to ignore them or move somewhere else until what he told me next.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I could get it for you."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The one thing you need to know about Richie is that there's always a catch with him. Once he paid a kid to humiliate himself by running around school in his underwear with feathers duct taped to his body. The kid insisted it was worth it. The glint of shame in his eyes contradicted his words.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"And what would I have to do for it?" I asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Richie scoffed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I'm insulted, Leonard. I simply want to make a wager."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That piqued my interest.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Go on."

&#x200B;

"First of all, I assume you already own a copy of Melee, correct?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I nodded.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Good, now how good are you at the game?”

&#x200B;

“I’ve beaten classic and adventure mode on very hard.”

&#x200B;

“With how many lives?”

&#x200B;

“Four.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Richie seemed to be deciding on something. He grinned.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It just so happens I’ve already reserved a copy. Tell me something, Leonard.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I knew correcting him would be pointless so I just kept listening.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Have you ever beaten…All start  mode on very hard?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I haven’t actually.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A bead of sweat formed on my forehead. Richie’s smile widened.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Well, then, what would you say if I offered you the game only if you beat it?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My heart did a backflip and I was about to jump on his offer. Then I remembered who I was dealing with. My eyes narrowed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What’s the catch?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There was a hungry glint in his eyes.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“If you can bring me proof of you beating it without cheating or conitues  the day Friday before the release, I’ll give you my copy of Brawl and a brand new Nintendo Wii, but if you lose, you can only eat meatloaf surprise for the next month.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My arms broke out in Goosebumps.  Even the people with Richie gasped in shock. The last student to try the meatloaf surprise was rumored to have been put in a coma due to food poisoning for over a week and the one before them was said to not have survived at all. I glanced at it over at the serving line where the abomination was. I could’ve sworn I saw it move.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Was this worth the risk? Then I thought about how awesome the commercials for the game were. Sure, my parents probably would’ve gotten it for me anyway during Christmas. At the time, though, I  was impatient.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You’re on,” I said.

&#x200B;

“Excellent,” he replied with a viper-like smirk.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We shook hands. There was no time to waste. Over the next couple weeks, I would practice religiously.  Every time I would lose to one character or another.  It took everything in me to stop myself from smashing my controller against my TV.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

No matter how much time I poured in, it was like banging my head against a wall. At this rate, I would lose the bet for sure. Eventually, I did manage to make some decent progress. Then the unthinkable happened. My copy of Melee stopped working and when it did my heart nearly did as well.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I tried everything to get it working again. It was no use and there was no way I could convince my parents to take me to the store and get a new copy.  It was over and there would be a tray of meatloaf surprise with my name on it. Just thinking about it made my stomach lurch. I decided to go out for some fresh air.

&#x200B;

Outside, I continued to sulk. When I reached the end of my neighborhood, I saw a sign for a garage sale. I happened to have a bit of money on me and figured checking it out couldn’t hurt. It was being held by an old man who if I had to guess was in his mid to late forties with an eye patch and a cigar in his mouth. He was talking to someone else who happened to mention Smash Bros.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My ears perked up and I scanned the area until my eyes fell on a copy of Melee resting on a table against the garage wall. It was next to a bunch of other things and there was a sign on the table that said not for sale. The man was arguing with another kid about how he couldn’t possibly sell the game. I admit I’m not proud of what I did next. Realizing they were too wrapped up in their argument to even notice me, I snuck past them and swiped the game.

&#x200B;

As I was getting away from there I kept hearing the man say something about the game endangering people’s soles. Honestly, I wasn’t really paying attention and anyway, the bottom of my shoes were fine so I didn’t know what he was talking about. What mattered was that I could win that bet. All I needed now was a way to capture evidence of my victory. Luckily, my parents had a digital camera so I could simply snap a picture of my TV.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was ready to win.  My parents were going to be gone for a while so it was just me and the game. I eagerly popped it into my Gamecube and hit the power button. The classic screen saver appeared as it did with every game for that console. However, something about it seemed off.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Maybe it was the fact it glitched slightly or the brief demonic laughter I heard after the cube reached the center. Either way, I shrugged it off and pressed start. That’s when I came across my second peculiarity The menu was in a different language that vaguely resembled a bunch of skulls with pentagrams and upside-down crosses. I also saw three sixes appear every so often in the background.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I didn’t pay this much attention. I knew the game like the back of my hand so I was able to navigate to the options screen and change the game back to English. Upon going to the one-player menu, instead of the usual titles for each mode, there were cryptic messages in place of them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Instead of classic mode,  it said. “Turn back.”

&#x200B;

Instead of adventure mode, it said, “No, seriously, turn back.”

&#x200B;

Lastly, in place of all-star mode were the words, “Shut the damn game off, you moron.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Must be a modified version,” I said aloud.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When I did, I could’ve sworn I heard the sound of a bunch of people groaning in annoyance at the same time.  Ignoring this,  I went into all-star mode and selected my main, Luigi.  I could feel that this was my time. Little did I know, this would be the most terrifying night of my life.  The mode began like normal and I easily dispatched Kirby without taking any damage.

&#x200B;

As the game went on, though I found some odd things. For one thing, my opponents would spawn already with items. Captain Falcon had a beam sword and Samus Aran had the super scope. Nonetheless, I still prevailed. The way I saw it, beating an even harder version of the game would make my victory all the more sweeter.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Things got progressively more challenging. When trophies dropped instead of characters or items, I only saw what looked to be laughing demonic creatures and the ghosts of children screaming in agony.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Wow, this game even has extra features,” I thought as I collected them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When I did, my room suddenly felt colder despite the heat being on.  I wrapped myself in my covers and continued playing. It seemed the difficulty was doubling with every stage. Each character had an item suited to their style. For example, fast characters like Fox and Falco had bunny ears and cloaking devices. Heavy characters like Donkey Kong were metal, making it harder to knock them off the stage.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was upon encountering Bowser, that I started getting worried.  Actually, it wasn’t him. It was Giga bowser and he had every time equipped imaginable. Still, I managed to slowly damage him, but not without taking some in return. It was the first time I’d been hurt in that mode.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When the silhouette of his character flashed on the screen, striking Luigi with a claw, I felt a shock run through my body.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What the hell?”  I said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was going to ignore this until I was hit again, Once again I felt I shock run through me, then Giga Bowser let out a laugh. My heart raced.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What’s the matter, Leonard? In over your head?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Why can nobody understand I go by Lenny?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What’s going on?” I asked. “Is this real?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He let out a demonic chuckle.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Is it real? Yes, the moment you went into this game mode you agreed to a battle for your very soul. We have to admit, you’ve been the most impressive player. Usually, they end up failing halfway through.”

&#x200B;

“Wait, who’s we?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Giga Bowser's mouth stretched into an even wider grin and his teeth grew.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Do you remember the man at the garage sale you stole the game from?”

&#x200B;

“How do you know about that?”

&#x200B;

“We know a lot of things.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He explained that the man had a twice-removed second cousin whose son was an avid Smash Bros fan. Unfortunately, he was also extremely annoying and would piss off everyone at school. One day, he pushed the other kids too far and was chased by them at the end of the day. He was able to scale the fence and make it to where his parents would be driving by.  He went in the street, then turned around to face the other kids who were scrambling to get over the fence.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He flipped them off while blowing raspberries and was hit by a twelve-wheeler.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“His parents turned to the dark arts to bring him back, and so they summoned me.”

&#x200B;

“Are you Satan?”

&#x200B;

“No, that would be my boss. Anyway,  they messed up the ritual instructions and then he and I became bound to this copy of Super Smash Bros Melee. We’ve been adding souls to it ever since until that man with the eyepatch left us in his garage, but then you showed up.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I gulped.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“And if I lose, you’ll get me?”

&#x200B;

‘That’s right, Leonard. You still have your heart containers. Let’s see if you can survive. Now, where were we?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He went back into attack mode and swiped at me. Caught off guard, I was nearly hit and managed to sidestep at the last moment. We exchanged blow after blow until I was finally able to knock him off the stage and hit him with my Luigi Missle. When I did, I heard him speak again.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You may have beaten me, but you should know there’s an extra stage. Let’s see if you can beat him.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I glanced down at myself and saw bruises forming on my arm. I considered, shutting the game off. However,  that would count as forfeiting and therefore a loss. When I grabbed a heart container, Luigi’s damage dropped to zero and my bruises faded.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The second last stage was the team of Mr. Game And Watches. It took everything in me to claim my victory over them. I got bounced around like a pinball and each strike damaged me in the real world. Fortunately, I prevailed and there was only one last stage left.  To my confusion, I saw the silhouette of Luigi.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I’d already beaten him along with Mario and Peach. I shrugged off my apprehension, grabbed another container, and entered the final stage. My jaw dropped open at who was waiting for me. It wasn’t Luigi. It was Mr. L from Super Paper Mario.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He also spoke and judging by the way his voice made me wish nails were being driven into my ears, I assumed this was the boy that got hit by a truck.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“So you’ve managed to make it to the final stage.”

&#x200B;

“Yeah, and you’re going down.”

&#x200B;

“That’s what you think, but little do you know I’ve gained powers you couldn’t comprehend. This fight will make the ones you had before seem like a cakewalk.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There was no telling how long our battle went on. We each tried everything to gain the upper hand on the other. We dodged, blocked, used our special movies, and tried grabbing. While we did manage to each do some damage, neither of us had a clear advantage.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You know something? I like you. In fact, once I claim your soul I’ll have a special place for you as my jester.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The thought of that made my skin crawl.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Not if I have anything to say about that.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I put my gaming senses to the test and for a while, I was in the lead. That was until a certain item appeared. It was one that made my eyes go wide because it wasn’t supposed to be available until Brawl. It was the smash ball. Unfortunately, he got to it first. An aura glowed around him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Now you will witness my true power,” he cackled.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He transformed and became Super Dimentio.  Not only was he a character from an entirely different game on the next-gen console, he also had different powers. He shot lasers at me, was able to summon explosions, as well as Bob-ombs, and his attack range stretched across the stage. I tried avoiding attacks as best I could and ended up caught in several attacks. Each one was worth a hundred percent of damage.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

How was I supposed to win under these circumstances?  He eventually reverted back to his Mr. L form. It seemed that his time as Super Dimentio was limited. By then, though I was on death’s door and Luigi’s damage counter was blood red.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Well, well, well, that’s too bad.  Just one hit and it’s all over.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As he ran at my character to finish me off, a bunch of scenarios ran through my head.  It was my own funeral and everyone was there. However, they weren’t there to mourn. Each member of my friends and family was calling me a disgrace and throwing drinks at the faces of my corpse. Richie was also there gloating about how he knew I couldn’t win.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Then I got buried with some meatloaf surprise while he and the others were laughing at me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Stupid Richie,” I said, finding newfound strength.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Mr. L swiped at me and jumped over him at the last second.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“But how?” the boy asked in surprise.

&#x200B;

“I’m winning this.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My gaming senses were elevated to a degree I didn’t think humanly possible. I beat him down until his health was as red as mine, and then the smash ball appeared again. I didn’t hesitate this time. Mr. Lt tried to take it again. I knocked him out of the way and claimed it for myself and activated my final smash.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A black sphere that made all characters turn negatively colored appeared on the screen along with a damage flower on my opponent’s head. In addition to this, he was also dazed. I  went up to him and charged an upward smash.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“No, wait, if you let me win, I’ll let you-.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I didn’t listen. I unleashed my move and sent him flying.  He let out a long no as his character flew through the background and became a twinkle. I had won at last. Expecting to see the victory screen, I was instead confused to see a bunch of ghost children. I got nervous, thinking I had to deal with some more horse shit.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Then they talked, all in unison.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Thank you for defeating the evil one. Your actions have freed us.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My response was hesitant since I  didn’t know what to say in such a situation.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Yeah, sure, no problem. Hey, I’m trying to win a bet, though and I need the usual victory screen to appear so if y’all could make that happen I’d appreciate it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They complied and my TV washed me in blinding light. When it cleared, the game was normal and so was the victory screen. Immediately, I snapped a picture of it. The expression on Richie’s face alone the following Wednesday at school almost made going through that terrifying ordeal worth it. Reluctantly, he handed over the Wii and his copy of Brawl.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

During my victory walk home, I jumped when someone grabbed my shoulder. It was the man with the cigar and eyepatch.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I thought I’d find you here so you just take things without asking, huh?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I stammered out a response.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’m sorry. I just needed it to win a bet. I’ve already won so I can just give it back…”

&#x200B;

“Wait, you won?”

&#x200B;

“Yeah, why?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The man went from stern to bellowing with laughter.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“So it was you then?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Seeing I was confused, he went on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I knew that one day someone would come along to rid the game of the curse and looks like it was you.”

&#x200B;

“Oh, so do you want me to get it for you?”

&#x200B;

“No, that won’t be necessary. It’s no longer a threat and I’ve only been holding onto it so it didn’t fall into the wrong hands. Keep it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He gave me a pat on the shoulder and walked away. My parents were understandably curious about how I got a Wii and a new game. I told them everything and my dad clapped me on the back in congratulations. That day I went down as the kid who made Richie eat his words and I marathoned Brawl with my [friends](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) all [weekend.](https://twitter.com/RoseBlack2222)
