Most people outgrow their childhood fears. I think mine just grew smarter.

I live in Seattle, where the gray skies and a weird stillness in the air is typical. Each day drags on as the house feels too quiet and your skin itches with a reason you can’t name. I have been having trouble deciphering dreams from reality, so I decided to write out my feelings so I can explain to you what happened that day.

This is what I can remember.

A few days ago, my mom asked me to help look for old Christmas lights, which meant digging through the attic. A chore, right? But the second I pulled the ladder down and stepped onto the top rung, I felt it.

Warmth. Like sunshine on your face after a storm.

I climbed up, and it was like time folded in on itself.

The attic was glowing with dust speckled light. My childhood spilled across the floor in soft piles. Barbies with tangled hair, my pink lava lamp, old One Direction posters curling at the corners. I hadn’t been up here in years, but nothing had changed. Everything waited for me like I never left.

Then I noticed something new.

Four doors, lined up along the far wall. Shut tight.

I don’t remember them being there before. But I didn’t question it. I was too pulled in by the feeling. That floating, syrupy nostalgia. It wrapped around me like a lullaby.

I called down the ladder. “Nathaniel! You’ve got to see this!”

My little brother’s face appeared at the bottom of the hatch, scrunched with suspicion. “Mom said not to go up there anymore.”

I rolled my eyes. “It’s just the attic. C’mon, I found our old toys.”

That got him. A moment later, he was climbing up, nervously glancing around like something might jump out. He walked over to the doors with me, sticking close.

“Which one do we open first?” I whispered.

“None,” he whispered back. “I don’t like this.”

I reached for the second door from the left. It creaked open with a sigh. Inside was a room bursting with unopened presents. Towering stacks with glittery bows and shiny tags.

Each one had our names.

“Holy crap,” I breathed. “These are… for us.”

I picked one up. It was heavy, solid. Real.

“Let’s open one,” I said, heart hammering.

Nathaniel shook his head violently. “Don’t. What if it’s a trick?”

“A trick? Mom and dad probably just forgot to give them to us?” I laughed.

Then we heard it.

A noise.

A low, wet, dragging sound. Like something pulling itself across the floorboards just beyond the next door.

He grabbed my hand, and suddenly, the warmth drained away.

“Run,” he whispered.

We did.



Nathaniel hasn’t said a word since we ran down from the attic.

We sit on the living room floor, both of us wrapped in old blankets, staring at the ceiling like we’re waiting for the house to breathe again. It feels… wrong. The air. The silence. Like the attic followed us down.

I break it first. “You saw them, right? The presents. The room.”

He nods, barely.

“I wasn’t imagining it. That noise—”

He cuts me off. “Don’t talk about it.”

“But Nathaniel—”

“I said don’t.”

His voice cracks in a way that shuts me up. I’ve never seen him like this. He looks younger than usual, like a little kid, even at the age of seventeen. It pains me to see him like this, all curled up and pale. I’m his older sister after all, I should be protecting him. His eyes keep darting toward the hallway that leads to the attic hatch, like he’s scared it might open again on its own.

I get it. I feel it too.

But… not the same way.

Because underneath all the fear, there’s something else. That warmth. That dreamy, glowing pull. It’s still there, buried in my chest, whispering. I wonder if Nathaniel felt it too.

Come back.

“I want to go up again,” I say quietly.

He whips his head toward me. “Are you insane?”

“I just need to know what’s up there. What’s behind the other doors.”

He looks at me like I’ve already lost my mind. “Did you not hear that thing behind the wall? You don’t go back after that. That’s how people die in horror movies. Things already got weird enough.”

“It didn’t hurt us. It just… made a noise.”

“Bro, listen to yourself. That’s the dumbest sentence I’ve ever heard.”

I laugh, just a little. He doesn’t.

“I’m serious,” he says. “There’s something wrong up there. I felt it. Like… like it knew we were there. Like it didn’t want us to leave.”

I freeze.

He’s right.

The moment we turned our backs, something shifted. Like the attic was holding its breath. Watching.

“Promise me you won’t go back up,” Nathaniel says suddenly. “Please. I mean it.”

I want to. I really do.

But I don’t.

That night, I lie awake for hours. The ceiling fan spins shadows across my walls. Every creak of the house makes my heart jump. Checking my phone, I see it’s nearly 2am and give up.

I throw on a hoodie and grab my flashlight, pocket knife, and the old wooden bat from my closet.

The floorboards groan beneath me, loud in the dark. I don’t even bother waking Nathaniel. I already know what he’d say. I pass his room and feel the guilt twist in my gut. But my need for the bliss of the attic is overwhelming.

The ladder unfolds with a soft click.

I climb.

And when I reach the top, it’s waiting.

Warm.

Blissful.

Alive.

The attic welcomes me back with open arms. 

Everything is still, the way it always was. Dust glows like glitter in the flashlight beam, and the scent of old wood and vanilla curls in the air like incense. It doesn’t even feel cold tonight. It’s like stepping into a memory that knows all the best parts of you and nothing else.

I don’t walk. I float.

I pass the door with the presents. It’s still shut tight, like we never opened it. Like it’s waiting to try again. I glance at the others.

My fingers hover over the doorknob on the far right.

It’s warm to the touch.

With a quiet breath, I twist it open.

The air inside smells like strawberry shampoo and the perfume I used to sneak from Mom’s bathroom. A soft pink glow pulses gently from the walls, like a nightlight behind fabric. Inside, the room is…

Me.

Not me now, little me.

My canopy bed is in the corner, made perfectly, with all my favorite stuffed animals in place. My rainbow CD player is sitting on the dresser, the Fearless by Taylor Swift disc glowing inside. My notebooks, my glitter pens, my sketchbooks filled with dreams of being an artist. They are all laid out, waiting for me.

And on the floor, cross-legged and smiling…

…is my doll.

Not just any doll.

Her name was Mary. My absolute favorite. I buried her in the backyard after my best-friend Landry and I cut all her hair off and she lost her arm. Mom said it was “time to let her go.” But here she is—good as new. Blinking at me. Smiling.

I don’t question it. I can’t. It’s too perfect.

I step into the room, barefoot on soft carpet that somehow smells like birthday cake. I walk past the mirror I cracked in sixth grade—and it’s not cracked at all. I pass the beanbag chair I begged for on my tenth birthday.

I sit on the bed, and the princess sheets hug me.

That’s the only way to describe it. They mold around me like the bed itself knows me.

I could stay here forever.

And for a while, I think I might.

Until the music starts playing.

It’s soft at first. A lullaby.

One I’ve surely never heard before, but it sounded all too familiar.

The CD player lights up and the music grows louder. Slower. Warped. Like someone stretching a record in the wrong direction.

The dolls head turns.

Her smile fades.

The lights flicker pink to red. Pink to red.

And then I hear it.

Behind the wall.

Thud.

Drag.

Thud.

Closer.

The walls begin to pulse like veins, the air thickening with heat. My flashlight flickers, the beam twisting and convulsing across the floor.

The door slams shut.

I leap off the bed, heart racing.

Something moves beneath the carpet. Like something inside the floor is crawling toward me.

I yank the door handle.

Locked. Of course. 

I slam my shoulder against it nearly three times until it bursts open and I fall backward onto the attic floor, gasping.

The music cuts.

The light disappears.

I stare at the door, panting.

It’s closed again.

Like nothing happened.

But on the floor in front of me…

Is Mary.

Her smile is back now.

And in her little plastic hand, she’s holding a picture.

It’s a photo of me.

Standing exactly where I am right now.




I don’t remember walking back to my room.

One minute I’m staring at the attic door, the doll at my feet. The next, I’m under the covers, fully clothed, flashlight still clutched in my hand.

My window is open.

I know I didn’t leave it that way.

For the rest of the night, I lie awake with the blanket pulled to my chin, listening for footsteps that never come. The doll is gone by morning. Like it never existed.

But the photo is still in my pocket.


At breakfast, Mom’s humming to herself. Making coffee. Like it’s any other morning.

I sit across from Nathaniel. His eyes are red and swollen.

He knows I went.

He doesn’t say a word.

I slide the photo under the table and pass it to him in a folded napkin. His hands tremble when he opens it. His eyes widen.

He swallows hard. “Where did you—”

“My old doll gave it to me,” I whisper.

He pushes his plate away and stands. “We need to tell Mom.”

“No,” I say, panic spiking in my chest. “Dad will freak. He already thinks—”

“Mom,” he interrupts. “Not Dad. She knows something.”

We find her in the laundry room, folding towels like everything isn’t falling apart.

“Mom,” I say, “Can I ask you something?”

She looks up. Sees our faces.

Freezes.

“What happened?” she asks, towel half-folded in her hands.

“I went back,” I admit. “Into the attic.”

Her face drains of color. Her hands start shaking. The towel falls to the floor.

“Which room?” she whispers.

“The door to the right . It had my old stuff. And my doll Mary, she gave me this.”

I hand her the photo.

She barely glances at it before she closes her eyes and rubs her temples. “It’s happening again.”

Nathaniel and I look at each other.

“What do you mean, again?” I ask.

She doesn’t answer right away. Just slowly sits down on the washer like her legs gave out.

“I was your age when I found it. The attic. It looked different back then, smaller. But it was still… wrong. It remembers things. Brings them back. But not right. Not how they’re supposed to be.”

“Why didn’t you ever tell us?” Nathaniel asks.

“Because I sealed it. I locked every door. I thought it was over.” She looks at me now. “But you opened one. That’s all it takes. It wants you now.”

“What is it?” I ask.

“I don’t know,” she says. “But it only shows itself to certain people. I think it feeds on memory. On longing. The more you feel, the more it has to show you.”

“And if I keep going back?”

She looks me dead in the eyes.

“It’ll learn you, and keep getting stronger.”

That night, I hear something scratch at my door.

Not loud. Just soft. Rhythmic.

I press my ear to the wood.

A whisper floats through.

“Come back.”

I told myself I wouldn’t go back.

I told myself it wasn’t safe.

But the photo won’t stop burning in my pocket. The attic’s pull isn’t warm anymore, it’s hungry. I feel it in my dreams. In my bones.

And still, I go.

It’s just nearly 2:00 a.m. again when I slide quietly out of bed, flashlight and bat in hand. The house is so still it hums. Nathaniel’s door is cracked open, and for a moment, I hesitate.

He knows.

He always does.

But he doesn’t stop me.

I make my way to the attic and climb the ladder in silence.

This time, the attic is different.

Colder. Taller. The ceiling feels farther away, like the space has grown. Yet it still invites me in.

The doors are all shut but one.

The second door on the left.

The one with the black handle.

It was brass before.

I step inside.

The room is a maze of mirrors.

Tall, antique ones. Some full-length, others cracked, with frames eaten away by time. They’re placed like a forest. No walls, no windows. Just reflections. My flashlight flickers as I pass through them, and every surface ripples slightly before going still.

At first, the mirrors show me.

Just me.

Then they don’t.

One by one, the reflections shift.

In one, I see myself smiling. Dressed in a birthday outfit I never owned.
In another, I’m crying, nose bleeding, bruised, alone.
And in the last one I stop at… I’m not alone at all.

There’s someone behind me. Someone I recognize immediately.

I whip around.

Nothing.

But in the mirror, the figure is still there. Standing in the shadows.

I raise my flashlight and take a step forward.

The reflection doesn’t move with me.

I stumble back and crash into something solid.

I scream.

“Hey, hey it’s me! It’s just me!”

Nathaniel.

My knees nearly give out.

“What the hell, Nathaniel?!”

“I couldn’t let you come back alone,” he says, breathless. “I knew you’d try again.”

“I told you to stay—”

“You didn’t tell me anything!” he snaps, eyes wide. “You were gonna go up here and get yourself killed.”

I want to yell. I want to scream. But the room won’t let me.

It’s too quiet.

Too still.

I look back at the mirror with the shadow figure.

It’s gone.

“Something’s wrong with this place,” Nathaniel whispers. “It’s bigger than before.”

“I know.”

He grabs my wrist. “We need to go.”

But when we turn back, the door is gone.

Just mirror after mirror after mirror.

I spin, disoriented. “It was right here!”

The reflections begin to pulse.

The air gets thick, syrupy. Our breath fogs. And in the mirrors, we see things that aren’t us anymore.

Not memories.

Possibilities.

I see Nathaniel falling, screaming. I see myself clawing at the walls. I see the doll dragging itself behind me, smiling.

A low hissing noise starts, echoing in every direction.

Nathaniel tightens his grip on my arm. “We have to move.”

We push through the maze, shoulder-checking mirrors, searching for the one that shows the real us. I don’t know how I’ll know, but I will.

Behind us, footsteps start.

But not like walking.

Like scraping.

Long nails against glass.

Nathaniel turns pale. “It’s following us.”

I glance over my shoulder.

One of the mirrors shatters.

Something is crawling out.

I grab Nathaniel’s hand. “RUN!”

We sprint through the maze, dodging shards and cracking frames. The thing behind us is close, I can feel it breathing.

Then, 

We find a mirror that doesn’t ripple.

It’s solid. Whole.

And it shows us, ONLY us.

“Jump,” I say.

Nathaniel looks at me like I’m crazy. “What!?”

“Just do it!”

I slam my bat into the glass.

Sure enough, we fall through.

We land hard on the attic floor, gasping, trembling. The door slams shut behind us and vanishes like smoke.

Nathaniel lies beside me, hands over his ears.

I crawl to him and shake him gently.

“I’m sorry,” I whisper. “I’m so sorry I brought you.”

He doesn’t say anything for a long time.

Then, finally he gets out, “That thing wasn’t trying to scare us.”

I look at him, confused.

“It was trying to replace us.”

…

Today is a blur.

The kind of day where everything feels like static. Like a scratched vinyl skipping in the same place over and over.

Dad makes pancakes like it’s a normal Saturday. He even hums while he flips them. The radio’s playing old music from the ’80s, cheerful and sunny. The syrup bottle is sticky. The butter melts too fast.

My mind keeps replaying the images of the attic 

The mirrors.
The room that disappeared.
The thing that followed us to the edge of forgetting.

Nathaniel doesn’t come down to eat. I watch the door to his room. Listen for footsteps. Nothing. Usually I wouldn’t worry, he usually hides in his room for hours at a time. But today is different.

When I finally look up from my plate, Mom is staring at me.

Her eyes are red-rimmed. She opens her mouth to say something, but quickly closes it and walks away.

Like she’s scared of what she might remember if she speaks.


I spend the afternoon cleaning my room, which is code for rearranging things and trying to convince myself I’m controlling the narrative.

I move the bookshelf. I vacuum behind my dresser. I organize old books and pretend I still read them often.

But the whole time, I’m thinking about the mirrors.

The warped reflections.

The door that didn’t open.

And Nathaniel’s face,how pale he looked when we crashed through that last mirror. Like something inside him didn’t make it out.


It’s after dinner when I finally knock.

His room is dark except for the pink salt lamp on his nightstand.

“Nathaniel?”

Silence.

I try again. “It’s just me.”

After a beat, he mutters, “Come in”

I step inside slowly.

He’s sitting on the floor, knees up, hoodie on, hood pulled over his head. The old walkie-talkie we used to play with as kids is clutched in his hands.

He presses the button. Lets go.
Presses it again. Lets go.
Like he’s waiting for someone or something to answer back.

“Hey,” I say quietly, easing down next to him. “We haven’t used those in forever.”

He shrugs. “Found it in my closet. Still works.”

I glance at the second walkie, sitting on his nightstand. I reach for it and click the button. Static. But it comforts me.

“What are you listening for?” I ask.

He doesn’t answer at first.

Then: “I don’t know. Maybe a version of me that didn’t go up there.”

I bite the inside of my cheek. Ouch.

“I keep thinking about your jewlery box,” he says suddenly. “The pink one. With the ballerina.”

I tilt my head. “I kinda remember that.”

“I saw it. In the mirror. Yesterday.”

I go still.

“It wasn’t broken. It was perfect. Spinning. Playing music.”

He finally turns to look at me, and his eyes are glassy. “But I don’t think it was my memory. I think it was… the attics.”

We sit in silence. What does that mean?

Outside, the wind moves through the trees like it’s whispering something in a language we used to know.

Eli leans his head back against the wall. “Do you think we were supposed to find that room?”

“I don’t know,” I admit.

“Because sometimes it felt like it was trying to scare us. And other times…” He pauses. “It felt like it was showing us something.”

I nod slowly. “Yeah. Like we were being tested.”

“Or invited,” he says. “To stay.”

That word hangs heavy in the room.

Stay. I take a deep breath.

He looks down at the walkie-talkie. His thumb brushes the side of it.

“When we were little,” he says softly, “you used to talk to me through these every night before bed.”

“I remember,” I whisper, surprised.

“You told me stories. About dragons. About secret tunnels under our backyard.”

He smiles faintly. “I think part of me still believes you.”

My chest aches.

“I told you those stories to make you feel safe,” I say.

He looks at me. “And now you’re the one who doesn’t feel safe.”

I shake my head. “I don’t feel real.”

We sit like that for a while.

Not saying anything.

Just two kids who went up into the dark and came back a little less than before.

Eventually, I leave the second walkie-talkie with him and go to bed.

But I don’t sleep.

I lie there staring at the ceiling, clutching the photograph from the attic.

It used to be frozen, me standing in front of a door, backlit by soft, yellow light.

But now?

In the photo, the door behind me is open.

Just a crack.

And in the space beyond it… something waits just out of reach.
