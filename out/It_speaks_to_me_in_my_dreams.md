At this point I'm not sure where else to turn. If anyone has any ideas on how to help me, please reply.



It's been two weeks since my last good nights sleep. I don't know why, but every night I have horrible nightmares of watching my mother die. My mother is not sick; nor is she in some kind of danger, (as far as I know) and I do not carry any resentment towards my mother. She is one of my best friends, and I would do anything for her, but these dreams persist. Every time it's something different: a car crash, heart attack, falling from a 10 story building, and the worst ones, some crazed psychopath killing or violating her in various ways that I'd prefer not to think about.

Tracing back my steps, it seems that this all started when I moved into a new apartment. I actually moved back home to Kansas City to be closer to my mother and father, but with how the past two weeks have been, I'm starting to regret it. The place I moved into is a small, old building that looks like it was built around the turn of the century. That old red brick that I loved so much as a child now incases me. The electricity is also pretty shoddy. Lights flicker often and when they do work properly there is a constant buzzing that sounds just too loud for comfort. The building has horrible reception and the internet is practically non existent, but this is what I could afford right now.

One night I woke up from a rather disgusting scene of my mother being strung up on a light pole and what sounded like whistling, but it didn't sound like a well formed whistle. It has a very shrill, distorted tone as if someone was trying to whistle while inhaling. If you try to speak while inhaling you get that very distorted sound that doesn't sound quite human. Imagine that, but for a whistle. It sounded like it was coming from the bathroom. Considering how old the building was I assumed it was just some weird noise from the plumbing and tried to go back to bed. When I woke up the following morning, I walked into the bathroom to relieve myself and found an odd sight. The mirror was completely fogged over. It appears that the shower had been running for a while, but no one else lived in my apartment, and there was no other evidence that the water had been running. I wondered if the noise I'd heard last night was water running, but that didn't explain why the mirror was still fogged up. I quickly grabbed my Glock G19, checked the magazine, and ensured a round was in the chamber before clearing the apartment. Once I was satisficed there was no one in the apartment I continued on with my day, trying to forget the strange events of the night before and that morning.

Last night I had the worst nightmare yet. I won't go into too many of the gory details, but in sort, I dreamt that a man dressed in some BDSM style leathers was mutilating my mother and cutting her open while she was still alive. I woke up from this in the middle of the night, half way through the dream. I'm not sure what time it was, but the only night in the room came from the digital clock on the beside table and the moon shining through the curtains. I wake up silently screaming for it to stop. The only sound coming from me a choked gasp for air as I realized I was in the realm of the living again. It may have just been a trick from the light and me being on edge from the nightmares, but at the edge of my bed I swear I some a short, pale, humanoid creature. It appeared to have frail, thin limbs that were too long for it's small body. It's head was misshapen, too long, too thin, and the eyes were just dark pin pricks. It was making the same inhaled whistle sound I heard from the previous night. I blinked and it vanished.

Since that night I haven't slept. I'm going on 54 hours without sleep now. I can't keep having these dreams, and I'm convinced that that thing is what's causing them. That insidious whistle, I can't unhear it. I haven't seen it, or heard the whistle since that night, but I know if I stay awake long enough, it will come back.
