*"Did the lights just go out?"*

That was my last thought, overwhelmed with panic. But that panic was fading, replaced by a numbness in my body and blood that should have scared me. 

Instead, I felt… nothing, and nothing was oblivion, a deep cavern inside me that had picked me apart and left…*this.* There was nothing of me left, and what remained were splinters. I remembered my fingers wrapped around a wine glass. Figures around me. Laughter. I remembered feeling comfortable. Music in my ears, and the graze of cool air on my face. Someone playfully nudged me. Then… darkness.

I woke up… cold. There were no coherent thoughts except that I was cold. I was so… *cold*. It was silent. My body felt strange, like it was nothing but a lump of flesh I was barely in control of. I blinked once, then twice. There was a sharp pain in the top of my mouth. Not enough to ignite a memory, but definitely enough for my lips to formulate words. "Fuck." I said to the ceiling in a croak. My voice had a low cadence, and was a stranger to me. Slowly, my surroundings swam into view. I was uncomfortably curled into large hot tub, my legs hanging over the edge, head pressed against ice cold porcelain and twisted at a weird angle.

The light shining down on me was so bright. 

Too bright. 

Blinking rapidly, I shaded my eyes. 

Something wet dripped onto my forehead. 

Then again. 

It didn't feel like water. Water wasn't warm, with a thicker consistency. It felt like… soup. I had no significant memories, but I did remember sticking my hands in a bowl of soup and burning myself as a kid. I was frowning at my clothes, a short sleeved shirt and jeans, frayed rope still loosely coiled around my left wrist, when a third drop this time hit my cheek. This one was messier, sliding down my face. 

I remembered how to move, lifting my hand and catching stray drops. 

Bright red smeared my fingers when I dazedly stared down at them, my body jolting suddenly. Blood. It shouldn't have had a smell, especially one that was the equivalent of sticking my head in my roommate's fire noodles. had a roommate. There was nothing attached to it, only a shadow in the back of my mind. The blood staining my hands stood out to me, like it was fake. Paint. I was suddenly aware of how dry my throat was. Scratchy. Like I hadn't drank in days. 

I was staring down at my hand, trying to figure out if I wanted to lick my palm, or wipe it on my shirt, when a fourth drop hit. This time it smeared the edge of the hot tub. Three consecutive drips. I should have felt something. Panic. Confusion. Maybe fear, if my body got a hold of itself. 

But no. Instead, my mouth burned. 

Not fire noodles burning. Real burning, like my throat was catching alight. *Water* was my immediate thought. 

I could see a working faucet across the bathroom, a silver spigot. I don't know if I was high, or maybe going crazy, but my vision had gone 0-1000 in a single minute, a foggy blur I could barely make out, bursting into vivid clarity. So clear, it was *too* clear. I don't think I was supposed to be able to see single tiny droplets of water clinging to the spigot. 

Tipping my head back, my gaze rolled to the ceiling lazily. More blood, my spotty brain was slow to point out. I was staring at bright red glimmering above me, like a plush carpet. Inclining my head, my jaw throbbed. Sensation was starting to drift back, and with it came the stink of decay. 

They were in the corner of my eye. I had already noticed them seconds before, but every time I thought about them, my body grew a mind of its own. Piled in the corner and spread across the floor were bodies. They all had the same face. 

The same wide eyes and horrified expression. Bodies that had been torn into and ravaged, severed heads and bisected torso's entangled together. Something seized in the pit of my gut, and I felt myself shuffling back against the tub. But I didn't barf. I didn't feel my stomach contract. That gnawing itching in my throat only grew worse.

I was numb. 

Empty. 

Wrong.

Thirsty. 

"Sam," a male monotone voice came over the speaker. "Sam, can you hear me?"

I moved my head slightly, and the intercom crackled again. "Yes, Sam. I am talking to you. Please make your way to the diary room. We are waiting for you, Sam." When I didn't move, the voice didn't let up. "Do it now, Sam."

I had zero idea of what any of those words meant. 

Climbing out of the tub, I dropped onto my knees, my palms grazing wet warmth coagulating across patterned tiles. More blood. This time slicking my hands and soaking my jeans. I don't know why I licked my hands tentatively, hesitantly. 

It was a knee jerk reaction. But it tasted good. Thick and coppery. Standing in front of a mirror stretched out across the wall, I had to blink several times to figure out what was wrong. I had no reflection. No face to match my voice. No identity to put back together. Fuck. Was that the only word I knew how to say? I squinted in the mirror, trying to find myself. What I did see was foggy, an outline, a shadow with no discernable face. There was… something. I blinked and got a flash of thick dark hair. A hooded sweatshirt. 

Leaning closer, I got a glimpse of half lidded eyes. Dried blood smeared across my lips and chin. I opened my mouth, sticking my index finger across my top molars. Before I could see anything, my reflection, or what was left of it, bled into condensation clinging to the glass. When my head twisted toward the door, my body was already ahead of my brain. 

I tensed up, my fingers gripping the edge of the faucet, my nose flaring. The stink of blood was suddenly overwhelming, suffocating my senses. There was someone outside, the thought hit me like a warning, a danger. And that person was… a threat. Still though, that didn't stop me from pulling the door open. It was the light that caught me off guard. Brighter and more intense than the bathroom, it was too overpowering, searing the back of my neck and back. 

The hallway reminded me of a fun house. What had been yellow carpet stained with grisly entrails. The threat
was a guy knelt a few feet away. I came to an abrupt stop, a thick paste creeping up my throat. At first, I thought he was crying. Maybe laughing. But the smell was too powerful, and just like me, this guy was being controlled by his own senses, taking advantage of the body in front of him. He was drinking, guzzling down pooling red stemming around a limp hand. I took a step forward. Somehow, I wasn't scared. Part of me wanted to join him, quenching that incessant itching in my throat. 

He paused, lifting his head slightly. "I found her first," his voice was a low growl. "Get your own breakfast, dude."

I think that was when I found my voice.

"What the fuck," was all I said. "What the fuck is happening?" 

The guy turned slowly, flashing me a grin. It was his teeth that stood out, sharpened incisors bared in a predatory growl. He looked younger than I felt. Maybe by a year of two. Hiding behind reddish brown hair hanging in hollowed out eyes, the guy slowly tipped his head to the side, like he was sussing me out.

There was something out of place, what I thought was glitter at first. 

No, they were… icicles.

Once I was seeing them, I couldn't stop seeing them. They clung to his lashes, hanging from his lip. Crystals of ice. 

This kid hadn't bathed in… I wasn't sure he *had* ever bathed. Greasy hair sticking in clumps to his forehead hanging in damp curls, his entire face stained new and old scarlet. There were traces of humanity. Even faint. 

I caught a watch on his wrist, what looked like a hearing aid attached to his right ear. I saw the hesitance in the way he moved, his jaw clenching, fingers gripping onto the corpse for dear life, sinking into flesh I knew was still warm. There had been a heartbeat, maybe an hour ago. Two, if he savoured her before ripping out her throat. 

When it became clear that I wasn't stepping into his territory, his shoulders slumped. "I forgot about you. I mean, I wasn't going to tie you up again, man. You were *feral*. Which doesn't make sense because I'm pretty sure you're still breathing." He curled his lip. "Huh. Whatever." The kid rolled his eyes, before turning back to his…meal. My mouth watered again when he latched his teeth onto the scraps. He wasn't eating. He was drinking, eyes rolling back, moaning into flesh he was clinging onto like a wild animal. "They're getting sued for this," he mumbled. I could hear it washing down his throat. Smell it wet on his fingers. 

Almost taste it.

The kid continued talking, like he wasn't licking rivulets of red seeping down his face and chin. "I'm talking *sued*, sued. Like, we are going to make millions if they let us out… which is unlikely, but–" His voice collapsed into a childlike giggle, talking to himself through thirsty gulps, relishing every drop. I didn't realize I was backing away, until my body physically dragged me forwards, my throat, mouth, everything was burning. The kid was still talking to me, but I was already looking for a way out. "Hey, I wouldn't go in there," he said. "Those are the newbies, and trust me, you don't want to be near a newbie."

"Why?" I whispered. 

The kid honked out a laugh. "Cos' they'll rip your fuckin' throat out! Especially when you're not…cooked." 

Ignoring him, I continued down the hallway. I could hear thumping, animalistic snarls. Every door was locked. "See?" the guy called down the hall. "Just leave 'em'. It takes a while to get used to, y'know?" With his voice ringing in my head, I pressed my face against one of the doors. This one was open. There was no snarling. But there *was* muffled screaming, and traces of life. Heartbeats. Not whatever the fuck I was. "Hey, what did I just say?" the guy's tone darkened when my fingers grasped the handle. I sensed his head snapping up, toes curling in the carpet. 

He was behind me in a matter of seconds. He was too close. A shiver skittered down my spine and ignited my blood, a dull pain gnawing in my mouth. I could sense his breaths, every movement he was going to make. "That's not a good idea. We're not allowed to go in there. It's the rules."

*Rules.*

My mouth was on fire. I couldn't think straight. I had no fucking reflection. The only way I could stop myself from sucking the blood off of my hand, was figuring out where the fuck I was– and this guy – this animal with a human boy's face – wanted me to follow rules? 

I pushed the door open, stepping inside. 

"Your funeral," the kid muttered in a sing-song voice. But he did follow me into the room. A large bedroom filled with king-size beds. Where the fuck was I? 

There were no windows. 

No sunlight or traces of a sky either lit up or drowned in darkness. There was just artificial light I felt the need to hide away from. Like I was staring directly into the sun. Sitting on one of the beds, cross legged on scarlet sheets, was a girl and a boy. Tied back to back. The girl's eyes were wide, frantic, shuffling in her restraints. While the guy sat perfectly still, his eyes rolling back and forth, head jolting, like he couldn't keep himself awake. There were at least four layers of duct tape over their mouths. 

I took a single step forward. The girl stiffened, and the guy tipped his head back to get a closer look. I saw a flash of silver, what looked like ice, creeping across his forehead and dying a single streak of hair white. The girl's body jerked, a white strip spreading across the duct tape. Her breath, I realized. 

Another step, and their eyes tracked my movement, the two of them shuffling uncomfortably. "Woah there," the kid held me back when I started forwards with the intention to untie them. "We're breaking the rules just by being in here, and you want to play let's-be-fucking- best friends with the fresh newbies?" 

"Newbie?" 

The guy sighed. "Yes. *Newbie*. I was the first one awake, so naturally, I'm in charge of all of you. " he strode over to the two of them, climbed into the bed, and shuffled over to the girl. She didn't react, her eyes still glued to me. The kid ripped off the layers of duct tape over her mouth, and she didn't even flinch. 

Before I could speak, he leaned closer. "Yep. Just as I thought. She's not done." he slapped the tape back over her mouth, and the girl made a whimpering sound. Moving onto the guy, the kid was more hesitant, instead prodding at the boy's neck. He wafted his finger like he was contagious, and I caught a singular I've crystal on his index. "He's almost done. I'll give him a few more hours."

When the boy snarled at him, lunging forward, I noticed twin pricks in the duct-tape gag. He'd bitten through it. 

"Not good," he turned to me. "Did I leave any duct tape in the bathroom?" 

It took me a moment to reply, especially with the way his eyes were frenzied, flicking back and forth between the two on the bed. His expression significantly darkened, jaw tightening. "What is it?" 

He didn't look at me. "I don't think I'm allowed to tell you."

"This is Big Brother," the voice sliced into me, a shiver creeping down my spine. The two on the bed didn't react to the voice. They were still staring at me.

"Now you've done it," The guy muttered. 

"Sam, please make your way to the diary room. If you continue to break the rules, we will be taking necessary measures to ensure everyone's safety."

"Big Brother," I spoke slowly, my brain struggling to register. "Like… The reality show." 

"Duh," the kid said, "The memory loss thing is getting old, though," he nudged me, and it felt familiar. "Judging by your state though, I'm not surprised. You're half raw and burnt on one side." Before I could reply, he turned me around and shoved me back through the door. "Go talk to 'em. I'll entertain the newbies. Just don't piss them off, all right?" I stumbled, and he caught me, easily guiding me down the hallway. 

I wasn't expecting him to get close, his nonexistent breath in my ear. He stunk of rot. So cold. His presence sent goosebumps prickling across my arms. "Look to the right if you can hear me," he said, maintaining his composure. "There are cameras fucking everywhere, and if I start looking around, they'll know something is up."

I panicked, navigating my gaze toward the wall. 

"That's the left, *idiot*."

Switching my eye movement, he let out a relieved breath. "They're hiding something from us," he hummed. "Things like *this* don't just happen, and they just tell us not to panic, like I didn't wake up fucking dead in the swimming pool with no memory and some fucked up teeth." Maybe I was imagining his breath grazing the back of my neck. "Find what they're hiding."

We stopped in front of a sliding door. The kid was gone before I could turn around. I had no choice, slipping inside a dark room filmed with cameras, a plush chair in the middle. When I collapsed into it, that same voice slipped inside my head. "Hello, Sam." 

I didn't reply until I was forcibly coerced to speak. I got four rounds of, "Hello, Sam." Before I gave up and spat out a greeting. 

"How are you feeling, Sam?" 

"Like shit." 

"Big Brother has asked you to come to the diary room so we can reveal important information regarding the outside world and the current state of the house and its seven house guests."

I nodded slowly. Dizzily. "Does it have something to do with me not having a reflection?" 

"Yes, Sam." 

I took a deep breath. "I didn't apply to be on this. There's been a mistake."

 A pause. 

"Sam, you applied for Big Brother US on October 23rd, 2011, via the website. You were shortlisted on February 4th 2012, and officially entered the house on July 16th, 2012." 

I shook my head. 

No, my girlfriend was obsessed with Big Brother. She would apply, not me. The dates didn't match either. 

*Girlfriend.*

The realization sent shivers down my spine. I had a girlfriend. 

Just like my roommate, she was nothing to me. 

Just a shadow, a splinter in my mind. 

"Sam, this information may be distressing," the voice made me jump. "Do you want us to continue?" 

I nodded. 

"On September 6th 2012, two weeks ago, the first reported case of Cold fever was reported. Also known as the Vryko virus, taken from the Greek word Vrykolakas, the virus first emerged in Reykjavik, in Iceland, and soon spread to neighbouring countries. It was declared a public health emergency by the CDC, followed by a pandemic, after cases were reported in key countries around the world." 

The voice paused for me to take this in– and I was. I was just struggling to figure out how this thing had spread globally after being found in Iceland of all places. "Sam, the Vryko virus does not work like influenza or SARS. The mode of transmission is bodily fluids. It is spread through the puncturing of the flesh from an infected individual's teeth. Infected people are reported to have undergone physical changes, such as developing a specific gland that is usually found in spiders and scorpions– as well as significantly sharper teeth."

"You're talking about a bite." I said, when a screen flashed on. I was seeing empty cities, news screens all screaming about the so-called cold fever. 

They ignored me. "Symptoms include: Dizziness and memory loss, nausea and vomiting, heightened senses and the collapse of the physical self (such as your appearance in the mirror and photos), aggression, and in later symptoms, a rapidly falling temperature that freezes your blood. If you're lucky, you will reject the virus and your body will go into shock, before freezing over. If Vyroklasas successfully takes over the infected host, the body is shut down so it can survive the body temperature, while said person will experience extreme symptoms of thirst and aggression. As symptoms persist, the infected become harder to reason with, and will grow increasingly more animal-like." they paused. "Sam, you may have noticed these specific–" 

"I'm a vampire." I said, cutting her off. 

"Vampire is the common word for the infected," the voice said. "Due to the similarity in symptoms related to the undead mythical creature, infected individuals are known as… vampires."

I felt like I was going to throw up. 

"Several days ago, we made the decision to keep you quarantined inside the house. However, we were not aware the virus was already inside here. And it has spread amongst house guests. Sam, you are infected. However, your symptoms are progressing much slower. House guests are currently being kept under observation. If you fail to show significant symptoms in the next three days, you will be taken from quarantine. If you do, you will die with the six other houseguests infected."

I leaned forward. "Die?" I managed to get out. "What about my family?" 

I didn't understand. 

Why wasn't I crying? Why did I feel nothing? 

"Big Brother does not have any current information on your family's condition. I am sorry, Sam. We're stuck here too. This series was never televised originally, before the cold fever, due to circumstances we cannot talk about."

"Then why are you still doing that voice?"

They paused. 

"It makes me feel normal." I heard just the slightest splinter of humanity in that monotone drawl. "Sam, if you choose to tell your fellow houseguests the truth about the outside world, we will have no choice but to kill you too. We do not need you alive to extract brain tissue."

I didn't realize I'd knocked the chair over until I was on my knees, breathing deeply into my lap. My mouth was aching, my teeth throbbing. It felt like something was trying to protrude from my gums. "If it makes you feel better, the other houseguests have a little over a day before their symptoms persist. You can leave now, Sam. Please stay away from the main bedroom."

I did, picking up the stair and then kicking it over again. 

When I left the room, I found myself face to face with the kid. 

I should stop calling him a kid. He was 19 or 20. I was 21. 

I caught ice glistening on his upper lip. He smiled a fanged grin, and twisted around, leading me back to the bedroom–  or at least the door. "I think they're sleeping," he leaned against the wall, fixing me with a look. "Well?"

I could only send him a questioning look, before he sighed. "Relax. There's no cameras down here." his lip quirked. "Let me guess," he kept his voice down, loudly coughing. "We're currently in a global pandemic that destroyed the world, a so-called *cold fever* turning people into vampires— and you're the only one who's immune, and you can't tell us. Oh, and that they're one-shotting all of us."

His words slammed into me, waves of ice cold water coming over me. "How do you know that?" 

He shrugged. "Because they told me that too." he frowned down at his blood spattered sweatshirt. "Three days ago, when I was still relatively normal, those assholes told me I was immune. That my body was too warm, something about my bone marrow being valuable, blah, blah, blah." he smirked, settling me with an uneasy grin, stained fangs and all. Behind us, an animalistic shriek jolted my body. I had to bite down on my lip to suppress the overwhelming urge to seek out the threat. *This thing was taking over fast.*

I swallowed what felt like ice crystals slowly forming in the back of my throat. 

The kid's eyes were dark, and I was reminded of the final stage of the cold fever. 

"And look at me now." 

… 

So, to preface, YES I got out of this… situation. But holy shit was 2013 a rough year. It took me four straight months of therapy to understand we were NOT in a global vampire pandemic.
