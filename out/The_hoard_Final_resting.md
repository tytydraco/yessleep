Scene 1: The Escape

We walk in a line along the edge of the mountain—men, women, children. The road curves and climbs, barely wide enough for our group to pass. The air is heavy, thick like smoke before a fire. It makes your chest tight just breathing. No one speaks unless absolutely necessary.

Then: commotion at the back of the trail. Shouting. Screams. Something’s coming. Fast.

We turn, but we already know—we can't run anymore. The kids and elderly are too slow. Some of the younger men break into a sprint. Maybe they’ll make it.

Ahead, through the mist, we see it—Springfield. The local school. It sits beyond the field, hidden behind its rusting back gate. They let us in. Gated and locked. Safe. For now.

Inside, there’s concrete and wire, classrooms made of tin and brick. There’s food. Shelter. But it’s temporary. One person inside turns. That’s all it takes to shatter safety.

Later, we spot two kids across the parking lot. Just standing there. Watching. We don’t know if they’re infected—but the air around them… it’s thicker. Tainted.

Scene 2: Cold Plans

It’s winter now. Glass frosts over at night. You can see your breath indoors. Rumors ripple through the school: a massive hoard is on its way.

I stick close to Darius—my best friend. He’s scared too, but you’d never know it. He’s focused, determined. Says he’s got a plan. He doesn’t see the holes in it.

I’ve got one too. Hide up in the huge tree at the back of the sports field. Stay out of reach. Wait it out. But how long can you wait when infection doesn’t need a bite? Just being near one is enough. One breath too close, and it’s over.

Then we meet her. Celine. She’s quiet, guarded. Looks like someone from a dream. We team up, the three of us. Darius starts falling for her. I do too, but I know how that ends. I keep it to myself.

They want to escape through the sewage line. I think it’s stupid. But when fear’s behind you, any door forward looks like salvation.


Scene 3: The Ugly Rumor

We’re leaving Springfield. Walking past the field, through the gate.

Some idiot—maybe a guard, maybe just a kid—says it loud enough for everyone to hear:
“They say it’s coming for gay people first.”

Laughter follows, awkward and ugly. As a kid, I don’t even know what to make of it. But it buries itself in my head like a splinter. I knew at that moment that danger is not only the hoard, but some of our own too. 

Scene 4: The Mythical School

Far from here—or maybe in another timeline—there’s a hidden place: a Chinese school for girls. Seven levels carved into a mountain, each more lavish than the last. Thick red velvet curtains hang between archways, brushing varnished wooden floors covered in embroidered carpets. Every corner gleams with gold tassels, brass lanterns, and scrolls of ancient knowledge. The air hums with power.

This isn’t just a school—it’s a palace of mythical arts. Girls are trained to battle dragons. Each ornate gold portal leads to a different dragon realm. Each has its own color, design, and difficulty. Only the elite make it to the top floor.

I begin to train in secret.


Scene 5: The Trials

At first, I only step through one portal—barely make it out alive. But I grow stronger. I fight dragons, steal fire from their throats, learn how to breathe in their realms.

One by one, I conquer their domains.

Celine and Darius weren’t accepted here. They had each other, and that was enough. I left them behind, even though it broke me. Later, I searched—but they were gone.

I’d hear stories: Darius became a ghost. A master of hiding, surviving. Built shelters in sewer lines and abandoned towers. Always with her. Always running. He took Celine along with him, and they both learnt to survive alone, protecting each other. 

Scene 6: Identity Lost

I reach the final stage. The Seventh Floor. Only full initiates are allowed here. I stand before the council of mistresses—ready to be one of them.

Then the news: my documentation is gone. Erased. They need proof that I belong here—that I’m a girl. My name, my identity—vanished like fog. These are precautions set in place for the new world. 

Panic hits. I race through the school, desperate. In one of the high-level rooms, I find a chair. My dad’s bag, his jacket. He had been here. But he didn’t make it back.

The headmistress is kind. She sees me. She believes me. But that’s not enough. Belief doesn’t hold up against tradition.

We need a new plan.

Scene 7: Memory Loops

I remember a night—maybe a dream. Celine’s there. She’s sitting on a soft bed, in one of the velvet-curtained rooms, thinking. Darius leans against the bed, on the floor, silent. He hands me a charging cable. We’d been filming the infected from the tree once—back when they couldn’t climb. Observing their ways and what drives them. 

We talk about everything, and nothing. And for a moment, we feel like kids again.

Scene 8: Diverging Paths

I stay in the mythical school. I become a legend. The girl who conquered all seven portals. The dragon slayer who lived in fire and shadow.

But Darius and Celine go the other way. They travel across a dying world. Sewers. Tunnels. Tree tops. Eventually after years of traveling , searching for a safe location, they end up in the Arctic, where infection is rare but survival is cruel. They dig tunnels in the ice, burrow like wolves.

They create small fires in these tunnels, hunt small animals for food, and melt the ice around them to drink. After years of living out their adult life in the snow, it is finally coming to an end. They are both frail, and are losing the will to survive.

One day Darius wakes up next to his wife to find that her breath is not as strong as it used to be. She is weak, and cannot utter any words to him. She just looks at him, with tears forming in her eyes, and mouths "thank you". 

Eventually she gives way, and Darius has lost his will to carry on. But he made her a promise. To see the view from highest mountain during sunrise. So he continues with her. 

He can’t bury her. He won’t.

He wraps her in layers, keeps her body close. The ice preserves her. She’s frozen, but not gone. Every night he speaks to her like she’s listening.

He stays alive. Alone, dragging her body along with him in every step of the way. Until he can't any longer. He doesn’t make it to the top of the mountain. He collapses into the snow and passes away shortly after. 

Their bodies, along with their belongings- their entire livelihood -is buried by a blizzard in the snow, forever. 

Scene 9: The Next Species

Time passes. The human race is soon eradicated, and only the hoard is left wandering the face of the Earth. 

Then, something stirs.

White-furred apes rise from the ice, with brown streaks along their backs. They are fast, strong, and immune. Built by nature—or maybe something else—to survive the plague.

They don’t speak. But they hunt. They fight against the infected. And they’re growing.

The Arctic won’t hold them forever and soon, they’ll move inland. 
This is the start of a new beginning, without the infected, and without those who created them. 


P.S. I would totally want to see this animated. I had a dream about this story, and would be really cool to see it in real life.
