I had a bad break up last year. The kind of break up that makes you wake up with an ache in the center of your palm and you realize it’s fanthom pain from not holding theirs, that makes you skip on all love songs for months, that leaves you gasping for air every time you’re in the shower and forced to face your own mind.

Worse, the kind where there is no blame to put on anyone. No hate to resort to to avoid the pain. The kind of break up that makes you stare at the ceiling until 4am, with the awareness that they are also staring at the ceiling, and that it’s still not enough to make it work.

I knew I could not drown this pain in booze or meaningless dates. I knew it was too big to be soothed by a few strokes on my ego, too deep to be healed through anything but time. But I could not stand it. I felt like if I stood still, it would consume me, as if the pain was an ever rising tide that would inevitably submerge me and my heart such an heavy stone that I would never resurface again.

So I did what any man would do in such a situation : I fled.

For safety reasons I won’t give many details about my work situation, but I’m an engineer and the company I work for was looking for people to spend six months in another country working on a project. Again, I won’t say where exactly, let’s just say you can drive as much as you want and never have to worry about the price of gas in this country.

It was very well-paid and most of my coworkers there were going to be guys in their twenties and thirties, like me, so I figured it would be a good distraction.

The first couple of months were tough. I was hit with the realization that I unwillingly packed all my pain neatly in my suitcase, so much that I was surprised I didn’t have to pay for the excess. There it was, taking all the room in my generic apartment, filling the empty walls with pictures of what had been, what could have been, what would never be.

And again, I fled. I fled by going out every night, partying every night with the boys after a long day at work, my skin sunburnt from this scratching weather, in the hopes that I would be shedding her at the same time as my skin.

My building had a doorman I loved. I’ll call him A., as the very last thing I want is for him to get in trouble with -… whatever this is. A. was a middle aged guy with a bit of a belly, a warm smile, big eyes with long eyelashes that always seemed to ooze kindness. Many times, he walked me back to my apartment door in the early hours of the morning, pretending that he was making small talk, when really he was making sure I didn’t fall over.

He always had a word of caution when he saw me walk out in the evening “Mister, be careful, okay ? You back before curfew, okay ? You promise? Good, good.”. He knew I wouldn’t be back after curfew. I knew I would be back after curfew was lifted, when dawn breaks, when I can pretend to be out for a morning walk if the police caught me, when the police could pretend they believed me because I was a foreigner and while they had to maintain the appearance of strictness, they could not care less about what we easterners were doing, as long as we were paying the full price for our drinks and keeping away from their women.

One night, though, before I left, A. was a bit more pressing. As I passed him, he held me in a embrace and slid an envelope in my jacket, and while his eyes were still kind when he issued his usual word of warning, I could see real fear in them for the first time.

Once in the car, I opened the envelope to find pictures of my friends and myself partying. I could tell when those were taken, because it was the only night when a girl had joined us : a cute local girl who worked with us during the day, and who we had finally convinced to join us at night. None of us tried anything with her, we were just happy to spend some time with a pretty girl after weeks of spending every evening surrounded by dudes.

There was no notes in the envelope, but I didn’t need the message to be spelled out. They could tolerate our drinking and our eastern perversion, but they will not allow us to bring their women into it. Message received.

We never invited another woman, be it a local or one of the few white women who were brave enough to come to this country without a husband, so I was surprised when one night, I saw the same look of fear in A.’s eyes.

“Maybe not tonight, okay? Maybe you stay at home tonight.” I kindly but firmly reassured him : I’d stay out of trouble, and of course, I’ll be back before curfew, wink, wink. He held my hand in both of his for a second, shook his head and let me go.

Maybe it was the bad feeling that this encounter gave me, but I could not seem to enjoy myself that night. One of the guys, a shy but hilarious Frenchie that I’ll call F., seemed to notice it. As dawn broke and every one started to leave, he stood up, tapped me on the shoulder and said “Let’s go. We’re going on a drive”.

It was one of my favorite things to do there. I never had much time to explore during the week, since there was so little time between the end of my shift and the start of curfew, but most of my week-end days were spent aimlessly driving, alone or with one or a few of my new friends, talking and watching the city leave way for the desert, then watching the dunes in a respectful silence. Every time the conversation inevitably died down when we ended up in the middle of the desert, I thought of that quote from Saint Exupery, and found solace in the knowledge that if that experience was shared by other humans, then so was my heartbreak. It doesn’t make it less painful to know that you’re not suffering alone, but it gives you hope that one day, you, too, will be on the other side of the pain.

F. and I didn’t even speak as we drove through the city. The silence was comfortable, natural, as if he knew no words could help the turmoil in my mind, as if he sensed that all I needed was to drown myself in the sight of the desert and to let soothe me.

We had three hours before the start of our shift, more than enough to go deep into the desert, on one of those roads that seem to lead nowhere for miles on end but always lead to another military complex where we were going to be stopped by armed men who will take one look at our pale skin and passports and tell us to keep following the main road.

Maybe it was because a storm was coming and dawn was struggling to break, but even though I thought we had taken a road I knew, it started to look unfamiliar. We did find ourself in the desert, but when I expected the first military complex on that road, all that was there was a fruit stall. F. and I looked at each other in disbelief and shook our heads. No need to say it out loud, we both knew what the other was thinking : why would they install a fruit stall here, with no village nearby and almost no one passing them but military men?

Two men were standing there, standing still, looking straight ahead at the road.

As we passed by, their gaze followed us in perfect synchronization, and there was something about their gaze that gave me chills.

F. kept driving, but what was once a comfortable silence had turned into an uneasy one.

He turned on the radio, but it kept flickering and that was more sinister than silence, so after a few minutes I turned it off.

The desert has a way to turn you mind blank, though, and after about twenty minutes we had once again slipped into a meditative state, both of us absorbed in the sight.

What we failed to notice was that the sky was becoming darker and darker, and when we heard the first stroke of thunder, we both jumped in our seats.

“Uh ho”, F. said. “We should go back before the storm breaks.”. One swift U-turn and we were on our way back.

A few minutes later, the landscape started to change. Ahead of us, beyond the dunes, we could see the outline of … Something. Buildings, a tower? Something man made, for sure. Again, we shared a look: we were not close enough to the city to see it, and the military complexes were rudimentary buildings, simple blocks of stone, nothing like what we were starting to see appearing on the horizon.

“Optical illusion”, I said. “In the desert something far away can appear close. Maybe it’s got to do with the rain? Like the water reflecting the city or something?”

“Yeah”, F. chuckled. “Yeah, that makes sense, you’re probably right. I was starting to think I was seeing things”, he laughed.

His laugh died in his throat as we grew closer and started to understand what was standing in front of us.

A ferris wheel.

On the side of the same road we had passed on our way, a tall, looming ferris wheel.

We didn’t say a word. He started driving faster, but the road wasn’t well maintained enough to allow us to go as fast as we would have wanted. We still had plenty of time of see the ferris wheel get closer and closer, to notice the four men standing in front of it, staring straight at us, and to see their gaze follow us, perfectly synchronized, as we passed.

And this time, we both noticed it clearly.

Their eyes were entirely black.

We made it back to the city with no other incident.

Neither of us had spoken a word, and to this day, I never spoke another word to him. We avoided each other for the rest of his stay, sparking endless rumours as to why we suddenly went so cold towards each other. Some said we had a fight over a girl, others said we were lovers and broke up. I didn’t care, never explained anything to anyone. I felt like if I never told anyone about that night, then that night wasn’t real.

Deep down, I knew this was wishful thinking. I knew because the second I got home and A.’s eyes met mine, his face fell. I knew because for the entire duration of my stay going forwards, he would not usher a warning before I left, only looked at me tearfully and whispered “Good night”.

One thing I truly hoped though was to leave this all behind me when I left the country.

Whatever had happened that night, it was a problem for the locals. I did not live there, I did not care, soon enough I would be home and I would be able to blame the alcohol or the fatigue for what I saw in the desert.

I held to that thought like a lifeline for the next four months, and as nothing weird happened during this time I started to convince myself it would simply be a creepy memory and nothing more.

But then.

A flicker of black in the eyes of the man at passport control.

A flicker of black in the eyes of the cashier in the shop down the road from my place.

A flicker of black in the eyes of the waitress in the restaurant I had a date with a cute redhead to put myself “back there”, whatever that means.

It’s getting more frequent. At first it was once every two or three weeks, then every week, and now it’s almost every day.

This past week-end, I was visiting my old roommate who had a baby a few months ago. I held his daughter on my lap and was brushing a strand of feathery blonde hair from her blue eyes when the white and blue turned to black. It was only a second. It was so easy to dismiss. But I know what I saw. And I jumped so badly that I scared her, her blue again ayes filling up with angry tears.

Yesterday was my sister’s birthday. She remained close with my ex, and I knew I was going to see her again for the first time in almost a year. I chose my outfit carefully, got an haircut the day before, braced myself for the possibility of her showing up with a new man.

But she came alone. She came alone with her arms full of memories, full of regrets, full of hope. She came alone and told me how hard it was to be alone, how much she missed me, how she was going to therapy and how she wanted us to try again. How deep down she never gave up on us, how she knew she would find me again.

This is what I’ve dreamed of this whole past year. The idea of feeling her skin again, her lips, holding her in my arms is inebriating. The future I always envisioned together, the kids we already have names for, the proposal I planned in my head a thousand times, all of this, finally within reach.

All I want. All I ask for.

There’s one thing that’s keeping me from calling her back though.

When she said she knew she would find me again, for a briefest moment, no longer than a second, her eyes turned entirely black.
