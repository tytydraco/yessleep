I remember the first day I laid my weary eyes on Cinder. Her fluff was an extraordinary shade of swirling crimson and saffron, ending in a hint of white on her tiny tail. She stood out proud among her average tabby mates; she perked right up when I first walked into the shelter.

She put her little paws on the iron bars and looked right at me with copper eyes too big for her head, her gaze full of a peculiar longing to them.

My tender heart melted into a gooey mess at the sight of her, and she let out this little adorable squeak of a "meow" and I was hooked. I scooped her up into my burly arms and she sunk instantly, her warmth soothing me in ways I never thought possible.

I adopted her on the spot.

That was three years ago now. She grew into her oval eyes; her coat became darker but that pure tint at the tip of her tail never went away. I live alone in a small cottage by the coast, within walking distance of the store. Sometimes I’d take her with me on a little velvet leash.

She was always glued to my hip, slithering under my desk whilst I worked and rubbing against me humming like a turbine.

I’ve never known cats to be as affectionate as her. Hell, I had never even seen a cat with her shade of coloring, one that was more akin to a fox then a household feline.

Looking back, I should have seen the signs something was amiss with her. The other kittens in her litter couldn't even hold their heads up yet, but there she stood. So alert and ready for the world.

At night sometimes she would set at the foot of my bed, the dim moonlight catching her eyes in just the right way that gave them an eerie orange glow.

She'd just sit there, softly purring as she watched me doze off into blissful ignorance.

I wish I had simply thrown her in the ocean in a sack and watched her sink to the brine. It would have saved me the disgust and shame.

\--------------

It started one evening, I had just trudged into the house with a bundle of groceries. I heaved them onto the sturdy oak table, and I soon heard the rapid fumbling of her scurrying from upstairs. She appeared from the darkened halls like the shadows had birthed her, she darted under my feet, meowing insistently.

I almost crushed her underneath my boots as she fawned over me. As she coiled around my legs, I did my best to avoid stepping on her as I played *Tetris* with my fridge. It was hard, the usual docile kitchen was now abuzz with a fur-coated jet engine. I gently tried to shoo her with my foot, but she doubled down with her crazed affection, marking me with her tuna tinted scent as she nuzzled my shins.

"Jesus Cin, I was just gone for an hour." I mumbled to myself, pickle jars in hand. Usually when she was this clingy it was a sign she was in heat, but she had already finished that lovely nightmare a week ago.

Or so I had thought anyway.

I set down my remaining bundles and picked her up. She leaned her unblinking head and lightly licked me.

Her tongue scrapped against the tip of my nose, like getting a cheese grater ran across it. I winced and pulled my head away, her ears folded back as she gave a pouty look. My nostrils twitched at the lingering aroma of dry cat food.

"Come on, you know I hate that." I grumbled as she squeaked in defiance, squirming her wormy upper body against my grasp. I ended up placing her on her bedding, hoping she'd take the hint and stay out from underfoot while I prepared diner. She batted a barely functioning toy mouse for a moment then gave me a pathetic look.

"Entertain yourself for a little bit, won't ya? There's a big bowl of *Fancy Feast* for you later if you do." I ordered, giving one final tussle of her head. She brayed like a wounded cougar as I left her there, but she stayed put.

Dinner was uneventful, a simple grilled cheese and tomato soup combo. Cinder emerged, ignoring me and heading straight to her bowl. I went back and forth between listening to her lap up the feast to barely watching the news. Lenny Abbott has been drooling out his inane local ramblings for as far as I can remember. I swear his hairpiece looks faker every passing second.

As Lenny was lamenting over the loss of revenue the town was experiencing over the beach closures, I heard Cin's tin bowl clatter around the floor as she pestered it, desperate for more food like the glutton she was. I sighed and gave in, she despite her overflowing coat she was actually quite petite. She could afford another bowl, wasn't sure I could though.

"-authorities are refusing to comment further on the beach closings." Lenny droned on as I grabbed another can and scrapped it into her dish. Her slit iris enlarged ever so slightly as she eyed the slop falling into her bowl. The tense sound of metal grinding on metal rang out as I scrapped every bit of the chow I could, I winced at that loathsome but familiar sound.

"-What's that? You serious?" I heard Lenny crone. "This just in folks, our loyal weatherman Lonnie has just informed me that we are due for a massive thunderstorm tonight. I'm talking real wrath of God stuff, tide coming in and wiping the beachfront clean. So if you live near any of the sand bars, I'd batten down the hatches folks."

I perked up at his troubling bit of news. My place was old yet sturdy, it had its fair share of rotten weather. Still I worried about drowning wood rotting overnight.

As Lenny freaked out on the TV, complaining about how he would get home without being swept away by rouge waves, Cinder must have sensed my unease and coiled around my leg. I smiled at the small comfort and scratched her back. She arched it to reach my hand and looked up at me, cocking her little head.

"Well Cin, looks like it's just you and me for a little while." I smiled sweetly at her. It seemed impossible, but I swear I saw her face twitch at that, her whiskered puss almost grinning back.

From dinner on she became insufferably clingy, and I realize I sound like the biggest horse's ass complaining about this; "*Oh Norton, poor you, you have a loving pet boohoo*." Well firstly, everyone gets annoyed by their pet sometime, get off your high horse.

Secondly when I say clingy, I mean claws out, kneading my stomach like she was trying to burrow a way into my small intestines. Every time I tried to unwind in front of the tube, I would feel these needle-like nails stabbing me in the flab. I cried out and would pry her off as she yowled in protest, her claws beginning to stick into my tender tissue. By the time I finally tossed her into my room, my belly was littered with crimson coated scrapes and bruised flesh.

I winced as I sanitized the wounds, making a mental note to finally get Cin spayed, because this was ridiculous. All the while I heard my bedroom door rattle with frantic fury and crazed howls. It was a moot point to try and enjoy myself, so I turned in early.

Cinder leapt into my arms when I opened the bedroom door. I eyed the frayed wood and was furious to find she had completely torn it up. Dozens of deep claw marks marked the door, chipped wood and old paint littered the floor.

"Bad girl." I scolded Cinder. I scuffed her by the neck and grabbed her bedding and brought everything to the den. I tossed them both down on the floor; Cin landed on her feet, paced around her bedding. "You can sleep down here tonight." As I said it, I pictured shredded drapes and gnawed bedding to mark her inevitable tantrum. But some destroyed furniture was a small price to pay for a good night's rest.

That's what I kept telling myself as I tossed and turned in my bed, the soundtrack of my evening the mournful wails of my abandoned kitten.

\---------

Eventually I drifted off into a dreamless slumber, waking only to a crashing sound. I jolted upward at the intruding noise, my eyes struggling to adjust to the bleak darkness around me.

At first the only sound was the thunderous pattering of the storm bearing down on my little cottage. The house groaned, but it endured the beating. Lighting flashed, the crack of thunder soon followed. I breathed a sigh of relief, then I heard it.

From down below I heard this otherworldly moan, like the cry of a furious feline and a woman in the throws of labor. There was also this nasty cracking noise echoing across the walls. Like logs being stripped of their bark, twigs snapping and crackling.

The cracking accompanied the pained grunts, a noise that was sounding more and more like a person. I jumped out of bed and cracked open the door. I had left the TV on downstairs, maybe Cinder had learned to work the remote and put on a Cronenberg film. A funny thought that did little to ease the mounting tension in my mind. Speculation ran wild at origin of these horrid sounds crawling up the stairs.

One thought that sent a fevered chill down my spine, what if a wild animal broke in, seeking shelter and instead found a fresh meal. I steeled my nerves and opened the door fully. I was greeted with a long, painful yowl, it sounded like a panther mimicking speech.

Stupidly, I called out from the steep of the staircase.

"Cinder? *Psp-psp-psp*, come here girl." I half whispered, half stuttered. I was met with a deaf silence, save for the slow, methodical gasps from below. The snapping had all but stopped, replaced now with a wet, slopping sound, like heavy snow sliding off a rooftop. I began my descent down the dimly lit stairs, the only light the creeping glow of 3AM television. Each step creaked with caution, as the heaving beast that hid in my den took notice and hushed up.

It was then I noticed the floor, each step seemed caked in fresh blood, trailing off like spilt wine. I could make out gory patches of tawny fur clumped to the ground, still sticky and moist from being torn from thin muscle. I felt my heart drop into my stomach, my throat tightened as I saw the piles of flesh scattered across the halls. The walls were coated in blood spatter, like a mad painter had gone wild and thrown it all about. Deep marks stained the walls, cutting into the bones of the house. It looked like a raging monster had torn through.

"Cinder??" I called out, a twinge of fear squeaking out of my tone. Nothing but the hiss of the television. Like steam escaping, that hissing sound, a malicious ear worm that burrowed deeper the closer I got to the den. Or so I thought, as I turned a corner and saw a lean figure hunched over in the center of the room. Its back was to me, slowly heaving through ragged respiration. A rancid stench wafted towards me, as if the ocean's worst muck had crawled into my living room. I cupped my hands to my mouth, gagging as I tried to keep dinner down.

The thing's back seemed bony, I could see emaciated shoulder blades jut out from either side, rows of vertebrae slinking down the skeletal back. Each pained exhale arched its back upward, if there had been a tad more light, I swear I would be able to see its lungs struggle to break through its sickly-looking hide. Its skin looked-wrong.

The creature's skin seemed to be coated in a thin slim, like it had crawled out of a birth canal. Yet it seemed frayed and blotchy, like it had been stretched too much. I could see patches of matted fur sprinkled around its body.

It was of a tawny shade.

I stepped back, horrified at this thing that had taken residence in my home. I must have made too much noise fumbling around near the doorway, I saw two triangle ears perk up. The thing was still mostly shrouded in shadow, it slunk around to face me and all I saw were two burning eyes looking back at me, bulbous things too large for anything real. The silhouetted monstrosity produced a thin, whip-like appendage from behind. It swayed in the air, an expressive motion as the thing squared itself, perching on the floor like an aged gargoyle. I stepped into the wall, something stabbing me in that back. My eyes lit up-the light switch.

The thing was groaning, an unholy mix of a cat whining and a human moaning. Those luminous copper orbs were fixated on me, the tail still swaying behind it. Without taking my gaze away from the mewing beast, I collected myself and fumbled behind for the switch. A dumb idea in hindsight, I should have turned tail and ran screaming into the night at the sight of such an oddity.

Ironically, I suppose, curiosity got the better of me, and I finally found the tricky switch.

*click*

The revealed form of the thing before me was hideous, to say the least. It was gaunt and thin; it's skin a slimy, pinkish hue that looked to be shrink-wrapped upon a skeleton too big for it. In place of hands and feet were obscenely large paws coated in hair reminiscent of Cinder's coat. It put them to her face, hissing at the sudden light. I could see massive toe bans, rubber pads of the bottom of paws. It would almost be cartoonish if I wasn't at the verge of shitting myself.

The thing was completely nude; patches of fur tried and failed to look like makeshift underwear for the thing, but I could see everything. On its chest were six rows of gnawed and protruding nipples. They looked frayed and worn, like the nubs of an old eraser. The creature's breasts were saggy yet small, almost like an afterthought to the thing's form.

The godless organism twitched its ears; they folded back in that same pouty way Cinder would do. It removed its paws from its face, wiry whiskers adorned her cheeks. Her face was shallow and sunken. A raw rhinarium twitched, like the naked air stung to the touch. I was face to face with this creature, my heart breaking at the realization of what it was.

The monster broke first in our staring contest. It broke out in a fiendish Cheshire's grin; I could see aged plaque covering the rims of two long fangs that hung from her gums. She raised her lanky arms, her oversized paws looking like they hurt to lift, and let out a cheer. Her voice was high pitched and overtly cutesy; it made my ears bleed when she squealed.

To my genuine horror it began to speak.

"Oh boy! Look darling, I got turned into a human, now we can be together forever!" She purred in this high-pitched voice that was like driving nails into my ear canals. She batted her dinner plate sized eyes at me and attempted a corny wink in my direction. I reacted to all this pretty accordingly.

"HOLY MOTHER OF CHRIST WHAT THE FUCK!" I screamed at the top of my lungs. I scrambled out of the den and hightailed it towards the backdoor. I snatched my keys off the counter and before I knew it I was banging on my backdoor. The knob rattled in my hand, defiantly refusing to open. I looked out and saw utter blackness, not even the streetlights were out.

Behind me I heard Cinder bounce towards the backdoor. I felt two hot meaty paws grip my shoulders, the tips of her claws edging my skin. I froze in place, my hand still shaking as it held the doorknob. She leaned her smirking head next to mine. Her whiskers brushed pitch my cheek, feeling like pine needles rubbing against my skin. She had this devious look plastered on her face, and she wrapped her bony arms around my chest.

"Heh, where does darling think he's going, we need to make up for lost time." She whispered next to me. Her breath was hot and had a lingering scent of week-old tuna and dry kitty litter. That rancid stench almost made me keel over, but I fought against it. I tried to get loose from her tightening grasp, when she opened her mouth. A long, beefy tongue protruded from the depths of her mouth. The surface glistened with faint moistness but otherwise looked course and rough.

In a slow motion I think was supposed to be flirtatious she slid that wriggling appendage slowly up my cheek. As she licked me, I shuddered in pain and disgust. It was like having damp sandpaper rubbed against me. I could feel her papillae sharply cut into my flesh, little bloody trail marks of affection. She pulled her head away, grinning and licking blood off her lips. I could feel warmth streaking down my face and saw her longing for it in her bronze eyes.

I elbowed her in the chest, and she yowled and flew back in a hiss. She scattered on the floor, her hand-paws struggling to find balance. I took the chance to run back upstairs, the thing that used to be my cat braying my name as it pursued me on all fours. I hurried up the stairs, clawing at the steps like a mad man as I dashed to the perceived safety of my room. I managed to get to it and slammed it shut behind me. Those glowing bronze orbs the last the I saw in the veil of darkness. I stood there staring at my door for a long time, like an idiot really. My pulse was absurd, my heart thumping out of my chest. I took long, deep breaths as I tried to sooth my frayed nerves.

But as Cinder began scratching at my door and mewing to be let in, I knew that would be impossible.

\--------------

Sleep didn't claim me the rest of the evening. How could it? The sun eventually rose, rays of early morning sunshine sneaking in like a bandit. I could sleep tug at my eyelids like twenty-pound sandbags, my eyes bloodshot to hell. Yet rest didn't come. The whimpering and begging had subsided about an hour ago. I had heard her clump away downstairs. God knows what she was doing. I felt like a prisoner in my own home, and the trouble had just started.

I didn't spend the whole night cowering in my bed. At first I had thought about calling the cops or animal control or a priest, something to save me from this nightmare. But the town was tense enough already and even for Raker's Cove this whole thing sounded a bit out there. So, I spent the late evening doing as much research on what had happened to Cinder as possible.

I was appalled to find simply searching "My cat turned into a cat-girl" resulted in a parade of pornography popping up on my browser. None of that was any help, especially since the degenerates in the porn seemed all too eager to bang their once purely feline companions. Now look I'm no choir boy, but she was an animal for Christ's sake. Or she had been before-whatever this was.

It was beginning to sink in there might be no reversing whatever had happened to Cinder. Who knows, she was always an odd cat. Maybe this was going to happen the whole time. I thought back to those restless nights I had caught her watching me, how human she appeared in the waning moonlight. I shuddered at those memories now.

I rolled away from my bedroom window, still contemplating what to do when I caught a whiff of something downstairs. It smelt like burnt grease and overcooked eggs. I perked up at the scent of bacon, my stomach demanding I leave my refuge and feed it. I cautiously opened my bedroom door. The crispy aroma was wafting up the staircase; I could hear sizzling and snapping grease drifting up as well. There was also a slight burning smell, and I could see a smokey haze filling the upstairs.

I sighed and tiptoed down the steps. I noticed the gore that had crowded them had been cleaned, leaving only faint stains and stray cat hairs. From the kitchen I could hear gleeful humming, someone was clearly cooking up a storm and having a blast doing so. I peeked my head in, and saw Cinder standing there, buck naked save an apron stained with yellow splotchs and some sort of dried brown. In the light of day her raw skin seemed horribly sunburned, like it stung just to move.

Bits of her fur clung to her elbows and backside, her tail dangled and swayed like it had a mind of its own. She swung bony hips to the beat of her own melody, her sagging buttocks shaking like a half empty pillow. I grimaced at the sight, and I must have made some sort of noise because her ears perked up. Her oversized ovals bulged, and I saw a slit iris glare at me.

She twirled around, half melted spatula in one hand and a stack of bacon, eggs, and flapjacks in the other. She looked proud of the meal, despite the still burning mess she had left on the stove-top.

"Good morning my darling!" She cried. "I'm sorry if my appearance scared you last night, I was just so excited that we could finally be together!" She plopped the plate down on the table and eagerly patted a chair. I resigned myself to this absurdity, hoping the pancakes would be good at least. I eased into the empty chair and with a forceful shove she pushed me into the table. The chair dragged across the floor, marking and ruining the tiles. I looked down at the messy breakfast in front of me. It smelled great, despite the eggs looking both running and over scrambled, the bacon blacker than coal, and the flapjacks looking warped and under cooked. I forced a smile and looked up at the leering cat-girl.

"It-it looks great. T-thanks Cin." I choked out. She let out a giggle that sounded like a cat puking up hair. She forced a fork into my hand and watched me intensely as I took a nervous bite.

It tasted disgusting, immediately I was floored with sour dough and raw flour. The charred bacon tasted like ash and the eggs clearly spoiled. I wanted to vomit the moment that foul concoction graced my taste buds. But there was something in those bronze bulbs looming over me. An anxious twitch bordering on psychosis. So, I swallowed the bitter meal along with my pride. I could feel the barely chewed mush struggle to slide down my esophagus; it was like eating a clumped-up wad of paste.

I felt it drag to my stomach with one last forced gulp. I could feel the blush drain from my face, and I forced a smile on my sickly pale visage.

"Mmmm, that, that sure was great!" I lied through gritted teeth. Cinder broke out in cheers and wrapped her skin-tight arms around me.

"Oh, I knew you would my darling!" She squealed. She pried the fork from my grip and scooped up some more slop. I could hear the prongs loudly dinging the plate, each scrap a whack to the back of my head. "Here let me feed you more, you need your strength."

I opened my mouth to protest, which in hindsight was really stupid. She forced the fork into my mouth, my teeth clattering on the metal. She shoved the thing down my throat, I began to choke and gag, making these horrid guttural noises as she force fed me. All the while she had this knowing smirk on her face. Breakfast went on like this for another five minutes, tears were streaking down from my blood red eyes, and I could feel bile trying to force its way through the gnawed slop.

Once my plate was clear and sick coated my shirt, she giggled and patted my head with her massive paw. I winced at her touch. *Why was this happening to me?* I thought. Cinder stood behind me, purring as she draped herself over me.

"I'm so glad this happened my darling. I've wanted you for so long." She moaned, her paws kneading my chest. She casually slid her pinprick claws across my shirt, tearing it and leaving faint bloody track marks. I flinched and flexed my back, pushing her off me. She huffed in disappointment, tracing a nail along my back as she walked around to face me.

"Please. Cinder you're a cat. This-this isn't right, none of this is." I pleaded. "We should take you to the vet, they'll know what to do." I sounded delusional, I realize that now. Even Cinder scoffed at that, rolling her cartoonishly large eyes at me. She raised a leg and leaned into me, straddling my knee.

"It's ok my darling. It'll just be like old times. I've waited so long and tried to take a form that might please you. The process was difficult, but I think the results speak for themselves." She winked at me, and I wanted to die. I could feel heat rising on my knee, her hips swaying as she purred. I pushed her off me, recoiling as she yelped and hit the floor. She eyed me with brief contempt, but it was quickly replaced by lustful reverence. She barred her fangs in a "friendly" way and spoke to me.

"Fine. Take your time adjusting. They always need time to adjust to their new normal. We got plenty of time to unwind, just the two of us. Just remember darling. You're mine." With that she jerked forward and nipped at my leg before scurrying off in a giggling fit. I winced as I examined my leg, even through my cotton pants I could feel the bruise start to swell, and felt a warmth start to pool from the wound.

She was right, I couldn't leave even if the door finally gave way to my constant blows. I saw a patrol car crawl down my road; the officer inside gave me a dismissive wave as I called out to him begging for help. I was on my own, alone with the thing masquerading as Cinder. It was obvious what it wanted, I wasn't blind to its craven wants.

I tried ignoring it, putting my mind to work with my job or just watching TV to distract from the abhorrent nature of it. It was useless of course, she would creep from the shadows and rub herself on me, marking me with her nips and dry tongue. No matter how much I shooed her or pushed her away, she'd come slithering back for more. She was relentless, sounding like a motorboat as she coiled around my legs and batted at my-lower extremities with her giant paws.

By the end of that first day I had crawled into bed with a barricaded door; my whole body covered in tuna scented hickies and bloody bruises. At dinner she had crawled into my lap and started mewing, grinding herself into me as she clawed at my chest. Playful to her perhaps, but when I took my shirt off my flabby chest was coated in deep purple marks. She had marked me with affection all right.

Night was restless. She brayed outside my door like a horny mule, desperate to get in. So went life for about a week; I'd do everything in my power to reject the things advances. Each day she'd get more brazen and desperate, "cleaning" herself right on top of me, her bronze bulbs watching me squirm in horror. Each day she smelled worse, this powerful fishy odor that clung to me, following me around the house like a stinky phantom. I would find clumps of soggy hair littered around, the walls marked with dark stains that reeked of piss. Wallpaper was torn down in streaks; deep claw marks adorned my walls like works of art.

Every day, I struggled to crawl out of bed, desperate for this torment to end. I just wanted my cat back. Each morning and night she'd smoke up the kitchen and force feed me burnt slop. My skin was pasty and bruised, my hair a mess and I'd given up shaving. A frizzled five-o-clock shadow had taken root on my face. When Cinder clung to me, she would nuzzle her face against it, rubbing the budding bristles deeper into my cheek. I was exhausted.

So exhausted that one night I forgot to lock my bedroom door.

I was mugged by slumber that night, my body collapsing onto the bed and just shutting down. It was a dreamless sleep, and a deep one. I almost didn't awake. When I did, it was to a horrid mix of painful and pleasant sensations. I groaned and blinked; the sun had just settled in for the day. I was on my back, and I winced as I tried to move. Something was pinning me down. I tilted my head slightly to see an oversized paw clenching my chest. My heart dropped to my stomach, as I began to hear a faint gurgle.

I focused my vision and grew pale at the skinny form huddled under my comforters. There was a vigorous moan coming from below, the creature's head bobbing up and down. I flinched in pain, tips of fangs dragging themselves up and down the raw skin of my shaft. I tried to get up but she felt my movement and pressed her paw deeper into my chest, trapping me until the deed was done.

It was agony and bliss rolled into one. Her throat was warm and moist, her tongue and teeth like sandpaper and nails. Within the throes of pleasure were barbs of anguish, and I heard her moan as she lapped up the blood that spilled. Pressure built within me, and I gritted my teeth and braced for the release. I heard a muffled gasp as it came, her head freezing. I could hear her gulp, and she appeared out from under the covers. Her wrinkled face was cherry red, sweat clung to her brow. She pursed her lips and a sickening mixture of spit and essence dribbled down them. I felt violently ill just looking at it.

Cinder rose from the covers, tracing her paws across my panting chest. With her bony hips she straddled my pelvis, a sick grin on her face. She wiped her mouth, her bronze bulbs flashing their copper tone at me. Her ears twitched in satisfaction.

"That was worth the wait my darling." She cooed at me.

"Please-what are you? I just want my cat back." I pleaded, still frozen in horror at what had just transpired.

"I am your cat. Every hundred years or so I cross the threshold to the mortal world and take a mate. You're lucky I chose you darling. Sometimes I'm a dog, others a horse. But I'm always Cinder." She purred at me, whispering her demonic origins in my ear. Tales of brimstone and rituals and deals within the garden of life itself. It was all too much, a distraction I found as I felt her hips move, grinding my bloody root.

I regained enough of my senses to grab her waist and throw her to the ground. I scrambled to my feet, ignoring the searing pain beginning to radiate from my lower region. I tore open my bedroom door and ran to the bathroom. I collapsed against the bathroom entrance, clinching my chest as salty tears began to swell on my face. I sobbed in the bathroom, lamenting the cat that apparently never was. Cinder pounded on the door, tired of the games and demanding I come out. I ignored her, tending to my still bleeding phallus. The damage was rough to look at to say the least. It stung like hell putting rubbing alcohol on the raw tip, but I saw no choice to repair the mangling I had received.

Eventually Cinder retreated into the bowels of the house, grumbling about being hungry. My mind flashed back to those god-awful cat girl pornos I had stumbled across. As I tended my broken body, I wondered if the dumbass perverts in those would complain about the situation I had found myself in. Or would they just succumb to their lust without a second thought?

The I stayed in the bathroom for a few hours until I was sure Cinder had gone down for a nap. I knew what had to be done, there was no other options for dealing with her.

I crept downstairs, careful not to wake the floorboards with my club feet. From the den I could hear Cinder snoring. I went to the sink and got a kitchen knife. The blade was sharp and silver. Real silver, the only kind they sell down in Raker's Cove. I guess now I know why. I found myself standing in front of her curled form, even in posing as a deformed human, she was curled up in her bed.

I raised the knife above her, and hesitated. All I could see in that moment was the little ball of fluff I had raised for three years. I lowered my arm, tears stinging as I did. She opened her eyes for a moment, letting out a confused "Darling?"

Then I brought the blade down.

It sunk into her flesh easier than I would have thought. She didn't get up, just a short gasp like the air had been sucked right out of her. Blow after blow was dealt to her frail body. It flinched with every strike, a dark fluid oozed out of her gaping wounds. With frenzied grunts I just kept stabbing her, I was thrashing her body with a cocktail of grief and fury. This demon had stolen years of joyous memories with my little kitten, all tainted by the thing it became. After a while I started laughing, at what I couldn't be sure. The handle of the blade imprinted on my palm, each blow slicing deeper into her.

This went on long after she had expired.

When the haze cleared, I was still giggling to myself, hand bloodied and trembling. I gazed upon my handiwork. Her form was crumpled, the matting covered in blotches of fresh crimson blood. Her skin was ghastly pale, her eyes still open, still watching me. They were dim, nothing behind them but death and contempt. I wiped my eyes and slowly stood up. The knife fell from my hands into a sanguine pool. I ran to the kitchen sink and released the contents of my stomach.

I didn't know what to do with the body. In my delirium I got some trash bags and stuffed them in. Her limbs folded with ease; it was like snapping twigs really. her eyes never shut no matter how much I tried. Finally I crammed the bloody bed into the bag, and tied it shut. I dragged it across the floor, blood leaking from the bag as it streaked across my floor. Now the front door opened, of course it did. It was close to evening then, and I placed the body in my trunk and rode down the beach a little.

It was nice being outside, the air stank like dead fish and seaweed, but it was a nice refresher from the pheromone addled home I had been stuck in. I ended up dumping the body in a sand covered shallow grave on the beachhead. As I buried the thing, I thought I head the wind whisper "Darling" in a mournful tone. It sent a shiver racing down my spine, and I crawled back into my truck and raced off. Those dim bronze plates watching me the whole time.

\----------

It's been a few days now since I dealt with Cinder. The body was found of course; I had barley tried to hide it. I wasn't worried, with the way the thing looked there was no way it could pass for a human.

It got a brief mention as another oddity in the strange things that usually washed up on Raker's shores, and then Lenny went back to complaining about the beach being closed.

My problems have persisted. I haven't left the house in a day; swarms of cats have surrounded my cottage. They all have orange eyes, accusing eyes. At night I hear them whisper my name, the loudest voice that shrill demon calling me to the window.

I've seen her peeking at me, her spectral form. I didn't kill the thing known as Cinder, but I did wound her pride. Judging by the ravenous flock of felines at my doors I don't think she takes rejection well. She's watching me from the window now, floating there. Her astral form is-is breathtaking really. Her form shifts, a glimmering shade of beauty standards. The only constant is those orange embers gazing at me. Even now, they long for me. The cats outside are getting restless, their hungry yowls louder as they scratch at the walls, searching for any way in.
