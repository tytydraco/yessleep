I hate when a place gets too quiet. 

Ever since I was little I had always been this way according to my mother. Whenever I'd be just alone in my room she would always hear either a clap or a small bucket of pencils being dropped on the floor. 

When I would go for a drive I would always have either the radio on or I would play music from one of my several playlists. 

I know no kid has ever dreamed of working as a janitor. 

That's one of the things that separated me from everyone else is that I was the one that always wanted to do the odd jobs. If a teacher had asked me to help stay behind and clean up i would, if a neighbor needed help cleaning leaves from their gutters sign me up. 

Most people would call it as just a kind gesture but in my head it was more so as keeping myself busy. 

One of the best feelings when doing odd jobs is knowing what's happening behind closed doors. You get to know the ins and outs. 

I don't remember when it actually started happening but I do remember one specific instance that was off to me. 

At the 7th grade hallway(in our school 6-8 had their own section and different hallways) one of the students was shutting their locker after putting stuff in and leaving. I know what you're thinking; “what's weird about a kid shutting a locker this poster already sounds crazy”. 

It's the fact that there was no noise from when they were closing it. 

After a couple minutes when the student left I got out my keys and checked the locker. Sure enough I heard the occasional squeak. Weird. I thought as I closed it back and continued doing my normal shift. 

The next couple of days after I overheard the English teacher and the Librarian talking down the hall as I was mopping the floors. 

“Have you noticed anything about the Macintosh twins lately?” The English teacher asked. 

The librarian just shrugged. 

“I find it a peaceful change of place”, she said. “You know how rowdy and loud those boys have always gotten. I guess they might have finally learned to grow up and stop annoying others”. 

I knew of the twins that they were talking about. 

The Macintosh twins were your usual troublemakers. Always disrupting the class with crude jokes and gestures. Teachers complained about them constantly.

During the lunch period I decided to go see for myself as this was a rare occurrence. I walked by the cafeteria and looked in the door while letting other chatting students through. 

There they were. 

Both of them were sitting at one of the tables quietly. Neither of the boys were moving. Everyone else seemed to act like they just weren't there. 

What got me though was that they weren't eating…like at all. Just sitting there unmoved and unbothered. I swear I don't think I even saw them blink thinking back at it but I'm probably right. 

I just shrugged it off. Said I was overthinking. 

Then after a few more days more and more kids started going silent. 

A substitute teacher complained to the principal one afternoon. I overheard them conversing outside the door. Which wasn't hard since Principal Warren was a loud man even when he speaks normally. 

“Mr.Warren…” The substitute says, "I think something's genuinely wrong with the students”. 

Principal Warren chuckles “and whats wrong about them? Are we disrupting the class?” 

“Well no…that's the thing, they are just silent almost in an eerie way. They would do the things I ask them but most of them would just be unnerved and quiet. Their blank eyes just looking at me even creeps me out”. The substitute's voice trembles. 

Warren gruffs,”If they aren't being pests then don't bother me with this nonsense. Here, just take your pay and leave”. 

After I stepped out of the way as the substitute left almost shocked. I was confused. 

Why are none of them concerned about this? Seems too odd just to be a rare occurrence. I thought to myself. 

As soon as I went to the back of the hallway I jumped. One of our students, a boy, was inches behind me was just staring at me. 

I almost had a heart attack as I went to calm myself down. 

“Jeezus kid you almost scared me”. I said to him. The boy said nothing back just kept staring at me with point blank eyes. I was unnerved. Almost like how the substitute felt. Just then the bell rang. 

As more students left the building I made sure to watch the one that felt like having a staring contest with me. 

I saw him go up to a woman that I assume is his mother. The point blank expression suddenly turns to a happy one and hugs her. Almost like going back to a everyday normal reaction to a kid coming home to their parents. 

As I look every other kid seems to act like that as well. Even the Macintosh twins were rough housing as they were outside. 

I was confused.

Why are the kids silent inside the school but not out? 

I left that day with more questions than answers. 

Then something even more strange happened. 

Next couple of weeks the kids were back to how they were. All noise no quiet. The staff was a little confused but I think they were bummed out as well. 

At the staff meeting one week there was questions. 

To ease the confusion Principa Warren slowly calmed everyone down saying that “things will go back the way were” 

The staff agreed with this and so did I. Who knows. Maybe it was just kids being kids. I mean, none of us has ever seen anything this far but we thought it was just the change of times and how it was probably a trend or prank that was viral on the internet. 

Weeks went by.

We all slowly got the edge off as all of our kids got back to normal. 

I remember thinking the whole thing was funny. 

Until one day for some reason every kid in the school got quiet as soon as they stepped through the doors. Just immediate silence. 

Talking one second and then just quick silence the next. 

Everyone on the staff froze in place. 

The kids instead just walked in, got their stuff and silently went into class. You couldn't even hear their footsteps. 

We all watched at one point when a kid even tripped and fell but you couldn't hear a thing from it. They just silently got up and walked on. Not even brushing themselves off.

Teachers struggled going through the day. 

Said all the kids silently staring at them as they taught unnerved them so much they had to make a little bit of noise in the classroom. It was sad because they were all becoming like me in a way. I dealt with this one time even by banging each locker as I went down a hallway. 

It's just like the sound was erased in our school building. 

Yesterday was the first time I actually snapped. 

While cleaning the science classroom one of the kids was there by the doorway silently staring at me. I couldn't take it anymore as I was gripping my broom so hard my knuckles turned white. 

I let go of the broom letting it fall to the floor. 

Hearing the sound of it clanking on the ground was satisfying enough but still didn't stop me from going to him. I grabbed the boy's shoulders and in an angry tone asked “WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON”. 

Silence. 

The thing I dread the most is evident in the air.  

Then suddenly out of nowhere the boy I was interrogating started screaming loudly. So loud that even I had to hold my ears as it screeched. Teachers that were near me came out of classrooms also holding their ears as I looked and every single kid was yelling. 

You can see them sitting in their desk chairs patiently but their mouths open in a scream that takes forever. 

We got them all to quiet down after Principal Warren on the intercoms told everyone to go outside. Each kid got up still screaming and walked to the outside doors like a death march. 

As soon as one stepped outside the yelling stopped. They all went back to normal. 

We would ask the kids eventually what was going on but they would say they have no recollection of what took place. Warren made everyone leave early. Then took me aside and berated me for causing the yelling. 

Now I'm here looking for answers. 

Because I don't want to go back to a school that's always quiet. The first best option is to quit but I need to know what's happening to these kids. 

Just please don't let it be quiet.
