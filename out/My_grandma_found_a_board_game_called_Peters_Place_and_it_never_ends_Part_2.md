[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1e8482h/my_grandma_found_a_board_game_called_peters_place/) - **Part II**

After I rolled onto the driveway, I sat in the car for a few minutes. Pizzas sitting on the seat beside me. Heart sitting on my tongue. I thought of the woman in the supermarket. The lack of facial features, other than that horrid mouth. The terrible laugh which tagged me.

*These are all things that have rational explanations*, I told myself. *The man in the road. Even the sense of being watched.*

I picked up the shopping bag, painted my face with a false smile, and opened the car door. For Grandma and Mikayla, I had to hold it together. For them, I had to finish the game. I knew, in my gut, that there was no stopping it, as much as I longed for us to run away. But I would do my best to shield them from the horror.

“I’m back!” I announced as I entered the house.

“Finally,” My sister called from the living room. “Grandma and I gained some juicy items during our turns. I got pepper spray and a winter coat. She got a rope and a pair of running shoes that let her move *three squares* per turn. She’ll reach The House during the next round, and we’ll be there in only a few more.”

I nodded stiffly, sitting down and immediately pushing my piece two squares forwards. Grandma was three squares away from the house. Mikayla and I were both six squares away. Nearly there.

Fortunately, I landed on a red square and narrowly avoided an Event space. I drew an armour card, which promised to protect against *one* negative outcome, then I faced a choice between moving forwards one space, but losing two items, or moving back one space. The latter would’ve taken me to the Event square, so I chose the former, discarding my torch and blanket.

“No! How will we win now?” My sister laughed, pushing Peter forwards one space. “Right. You to go, Grandma.”

She smiled. “Well, I suppose I move to… I don’t know.”

“No, you’ve won, Grandma,” I said, pushing her piece over the line. “With your running shoes, you move three squares to The House. It’s just Mikayla and me.”

“And I’m going to be braver than you, Emmett,” My younger sibling announced, pushing her piece two squares forwards. “A *green* Event square. Uh oh! But I’m only four away from victory.”

I fearfully held my tongue as Mikayla picked up both an item and a choice.

“A muddy rag,” She laughed, tossing the Item card into her pile, then reading her Choice card. “You face the ones you fear. The ones you thought you’d avoid at the… week’s end. At the island’s end… And you realise that time is up. You flee no more. You fight. Do you wield a weapon, moving backwards a space? Or do you take the pain, moving forwards a space? I… How did it know?”

My sister started to sweat, face contorting into the same expression of agony I had worn an hour earlier.

“Just a strange coincidence,” I lied, still hoping to shield Mikayla. “What do you choose?”

“I don’t know,” She whispered. “I’m not sure I want to keep playing.”

“*No*!” I harshly interjected, before adopting a gentler tone in response to shocked expressions. “I, er… Sorry, I just… Look, Grandma’s finished. Let’s just… Let’s cross the line, Mikayla. Let’s… Let’s…”

“– What’s up with you?” My sister interrupted, voice trembling. “You’ve been weird since we started playing. And now I’ve drawn this card, I… I feel weird too.”

“I think it might be time for bed,” Grandma blankly said.

“We have to keep playing,” I explained shakily. “*Please*, Mikayla. Just tell me what you choose. I suggest you wield a weapon. That sounds safer– er, *better*.”

“Fine, I wield a weapon,” Mikayla whimpered, pushing her piece backwards. “Does that mean I don’t have to draw the Event card?”

“I hope so,” I said, pushing my piece two squares forwards and landing on a red square. “My Item card is… a horse. It adds three squares to everyone’s speed for the remainder of the game.”

“So, we’ll both reach The House in the next round?” My sister asked hopefully, eyes swimming with the same petrified realisation that I knew lurked in my own.

I nodded, reading my Choice card. “You hover near the edge of the forest, weapon at the ready, but which do you wield? The broadsword or the tyre iron? Discard the item you do not wish to keep.”

“*How does it know the items you have?*” My sister wheezed. “These aren’t coincidences, Emmett. And you *know* something. I see it in your eyes… *What’s happening?* Is this some horrible joke that you wanted to play on Grandma and me? Did you set up this game?”

“You know I didn’t,” I whispered, locking eyes with my sister and finally failing to bury the truth. “You feel it too, don’t you? There’s something wrong with this game, but we need to finish it.”

“I’d like to go to bed,” Our grandmother absent-mindedly said.

“One second, Grandma,” I begged, tossing my tyre iron into the discard pile, then pushing Peter one square forwards. “Final round. Your turn, Mikayla. Look. You’re going to reach The House.”

“Okay…” My sister hoarsely nodded, pushing her piece five squares past the finish line. “Now… you?”

“Now me,” I said, pushing my piece four squares forwards. “We’ve made it. It’s over. The game’s–”

“– The final Event card,” Mikayla moaned, slicing into my triumphant cry.

My blood turned cold. In an eager race to the finish, desperate to put a lid on that game for good, I’d forgotten one of the rules.

*If a player reaches The House, Item and Choice cards do not need to be drawn. However, if all players have crossed the line, draw one final Event card to determine your victory or failure. It may be red or green.*

“It’s okay,” I unconvincingly told my little sister as I picked up the red Event card.

“What does it say?” She asked, stifling tears.

*It is time to put your decisions to the test. You have chosen the routes, and now your bodies must match your words.*

Before anybody else uttered a word, all light vanished. Not only overhead, but outside. It was deeper and darker than that, of course. The world was gone, replaced by one devoid of colour.

“Grandma? Mikayla?” I screamed into the darkness.

There came no reply from either of them. Instead, the creaking of large, metallic doors broke both the silence and the blackness, filling my world with light once more. A man and a woman entered the space in which I stood. An impressive factory floor filled with large, round containers. It appeared to be some sort of processing plant. A humongous machine, made of high-speed steel and topped with a sharp-edged funnel, rocked on its legs in the centre of the room.

The metal beast was grinding oats, fed into the machine by an intersecting assembly line. How I had found myself in that place, I did not know, and my heartbeat only quickened as the man and woman seemingly stared right through me.

Though I did not recognise him, I recognised *her* from old photographs. It was a younger version of Grandma, perhaps only a year or two older than me.

“You *will* learn, Annabelle!” The man, who seemed a couple of decades older, bellowed violently.

He grabbed a clump of my grandmother’s hair and dragged her towards the churning machine in the centre of the room. I called to her, rushing forwards, but neither of them heard me. Neither of them saw me. And my hand slipped through wispy, intangible colours as I swiped at the malevolent man, who wore a filthy vest and stained jeans.

“Please, Gerald,” My grandma begged, sobbing as the man yanked her towards the running grinder.

“I could do it, you know,” He whispered, feeding her hair into the funnel, mere inches from the teeth of the grinder. “Put you in one of my chocolates. Nobody would know. It would be our little secret. For the next few months, I would gradually eat my way through you. Your meat would fill a *thousand* bars.”

“Gerald!” Grandma cried as he started to taunt her, lowering his handful of her blonde locks into the open funnel. “You’re not thinking clearly… Let’s just go to bed, okay? It’s… It’s just one of your bad days…”

“*Every* day with you is a bad day,” He said. “No wife of mine will entertain wild ideas of working in the *city*. If you were to let others gaze upon you, I… I… Well, I would do something worse than this, Belle. Something far worse. Better that it end this way, my darling. *I will make it quick.*”

In a moment of violent abandon, driven by some primal urge to survive, Grandma transformed from a timid girl into an emboldened fighter. She snatched her husband’s lower arm, halting him moments before the first blonde strand was bitten by the frightful metal jaws of the machine. Reflexively, the man’s fingers loosened, releasing her hair.

Gerald eyed her fearfully, stunned by her sudden counter-move. “What the *devil* are you doing, Annabelle? Unhand my arm, or I’ll make it far slower. Far—”

Before the man finished his sentence, the younger version of my grandmother thrust her husband’s hand and arm into the grinder’s throat.

The man’s scream nearly perforated my eardrums. I gawped as his entire right arm was devoured by the machine. His wide mouth and eyes filled with a vile shower of blood and chewed meat, spat out of the befuddled oat grinder.

Rapidly losing strength, Gerald feebly wrestled with the machine as it threatened to tug his body over the top of the funnel, but his pain had not come to an end. Grandma seized his other arm, and she faced little resistance from the wounded monster whilst slotting the limp limb into the beast. The man’s arms were bound to the grinding teeth of the machine for only a few moments, however, before he fell onto the hard ground.

Grandma froze for that final minute, whilst her husband, left with ragged, tattered stumps on his shoulders, bled out. And after he stopped squirming on the factory floor, my grandmother remained still for a further two or three minutes, as did I. In spite of the horror I had already witnessed that night, that evil man’s gruesome end is the image which always comes to the forefront of my mind.

My younger grandmother surprised me with another layer of terror. I watched as she heaved the bloody, armless carcass over the edge of the raised assembly line, concealing her husband’s body in a deep wave of oats.

Gerald’s mangled corpse was carried by the flowing stream towards the grinder. It took the man up a slope, before finally dumping him into the metallic mouth. Not only what remained of his stumps, but his entire *body*. A reddish rain, littered with soft clumps, shot upwards as the machine sought to unclog its gullet. With great struggle, however, the grinder managed to process the man, incorporating him into a fresh line of Bransgrove Oats chocolate bars.

I did not see how Grandma covered up her crime, which was truly horrific, in spite of its justification. For the room suddenly changed. As if blood had smeared the overhead lightbulbs, the factory’s white glow turned red, and Annabelle’s appearance altered. Her trauma morphed into pure, disbelieving horror as she started to *age*. Started to transition, before my very eyes, from a young woman into the elderly lady I knew. All in a matter of seconds.

And then, with a brutal gust that threw the doors open, Grandma’s frail form was hurled into the assembly line of oats. We both screamed as she was carried by the brittle current towards the same fate that her husband had met, decades earlier. And as she struggled to stay afloat, I saw in her haunted eyes, regardless of the dementia, that she understood. That she still recognised what she’d done so many years ago.

Moreover, she finally *saw* me. Wherever we were, present or past, she saw me.

“HELP!” She wailed.

“Grandma!” I cried, desperate to save her.

But my eyes were drawn to the open factory doors. A second scream had sounded from outside, and the doorway revealed a forest. The woodland behind Grandma’s house. My chest started to rapidly pound as I distinguished two shapes bobbing clumsily above the tree line, disturbing leaves as they came closer. *Two gargantuan heads*, belonging to things that lurched towards a girl in the grass. She lay in a clearing just before the tree line, arms raised to defend herself from the misshapen horrors.

*Mikayla.*

It suddenly became clear. The choice I had already made in *Peter’s Place*. The rabid fox and the lamb.

My eyes started to water as my legs, propelled by some force beyond my will, carried me towards the factory doors. Away from my terrified grandmother, who was still being carried by a fearsome flow towards the whirring grinder. Towards my sister, who awaited the two looming creatures of the forest. Creatures taller than the swaying birch trees, with bodies human, yet far from worldly.

As the factory doors closed behind me, I swivelled around to find not a building, but the field between the forest and Grandma’s home.

She was gone.

I screamed for her, tears staining my face, but Grandma did not answer my call. Instead, plucked from a dark crevice of the field, came a black stallion. One with an eyeless face and skin peeling from its bones. A stead that I did not want to approach. However, when I noticed the holstered sword tied to its reins, and heard another scream from Mikayla, I realised I’d already chosen this fate.

The horse and the broadsword.

I mounted the unholy creature, which came from some world below or parallel to ours. Then, facing the looming terrors, I booted the stirrups and galloped ahead. The vile entities came into view, and I recognised their tattered rags. The navy uniforms from our old high school. Beneath the warped faces, with bleeding eyes and terrifying, fanged smiles, I sensed something familiar about the monsters.

“Emmett?” My sister gasped as I dismounted the horse, clutching the broadsword in a shaky hand.

I tried to stop the tears. Tried to swing the blade and bring the nightmare to an end, but some invisible, impenetrable obstacle stood in my way. I let a cry slip free as the abominations started to stagger towards me, the insect standing between them and Mikayla.

“Emmett…” She whimpered. “It said *I* had to wield it.”

With eerie ease, I found that I dropped the weapon into my sister’s arms, and she quickly stumbled to her feet. My head throbbed as I stepped backwards. Beads of sweat trickled down my brow.

Then Mikayla swung the blade, unleashing a petrified screech.

The broadsword tore through the pair of lumbering monstrosities, turning them to ashy mounds of blackness.

After that, we stood in silence, caught between the forest and Grandma’s distant house. Tears stung my eyes as I recalled what I’d seen in that vision of a factory. I knew she was gone. Knew, despite an evening of untrustworthy visions in a game from another realm, that two things were indisputable.

Grandma had died a horrible death.

And I had chosen that.

“They tormented me at school,” Mikayla finally blubbered, dropping the sword to the ground and running into my arms.

Then my sister raised her sleeve, revealing healed scars. The marks of ancient cigarette burns.

“Not just physically, but…” My sister tapped her head, sniffling into my jacket. “And none of this is real, is it? It’s all that awful game. That–”

“– Oh, it’s real,” I interrupted. “Grandma’s dead. And I killed her. I… I…”

“You chose to save me,” Mikayla finished, finally understanding. “You didn’t know. You didn’t know what you were choosing!”

“I know,” I whispered.

She clutched me tightly. “Have we finished the game, Emmett? We all reached The House. We completed the final Event. We–”

My sister was not interrupted by a sound, but a dull ringing. One that replaced all other noise. In my peripheral vision, I saw Mikayla’s lips continue to move, but I heard only static. A flurry of wasps in my brain, swarming to signal the arrival of something from a place beyond Hell.

I eyed a dark shape that emerged from the tree line. A silhouette I recognised from earlier in the evening.

He was little more than a black outline, but the motion of his form was well-communicated. He was strolling with insidious intent. Strolling towards us. Or, rather, towards *The House*. My head snapped around to face Grandma’s property hundreds of yards behind us.

“RUN!” I yelled.

My sister lifted her head, eyes not quite meeting the forest, but I know she saw it. She pretended not to see, but I read her face.

There were no words from either of us. Only a limb-tearing sprint across the field. The horse had abandoned us, so we had to rely on our feet. As a pumping pulse filled my ears, I told myself that we had, by far, outpaced Peter. By the time we reached the house’s back gate, I expected him to have hardly made it to the field’s midway point. The back door had unlatched again, so I hurried my sister inside and turned to lock the exit.

Mikayla and I screamed together. Both soundlessly, much as I had at the start of the night when I’d first seen that unseen thing in the forest. We stood with mouths agape, paralysed.

Walking across the paving slabs, having passed through the garden gate without making a sound, was a man whose form remained shrouded by shadows. *Inexplicably* shrouded. Even in such dim light, *some* of his features should have been revealed. But he was nothing. Not even the colour of his game piece. Peter was a strolling silhouette, moving at a glacial pace, yet having *somehow* closed the gap between us.

I slammed the door shut with a primal cry. Then Mikayla and I held each other, quaking in the hallway as the back porch creaked beneath approaching footsteps. Measured footsteps. Through the distorted window pane, that silhouette came into view. It stood, tall form warped by the glass, and faced the door. Eyeing us, if it had eyes.

And then, after only a few seconds, he turned. Turned and walked away with that same pace.

We were left with only a gash on my wrist and Grandma’s disappearance to prove that any of it had, in fact, happened. Still, Mikayla and I told folk that our grandmother had let herself out of the house whilst we slept. It was a symptom of her unwell mind. She was not seen again. And they would not believe the alternative without seeing what we saw.

Over the following weeks, we tried to disprove the message on the underside of the box. Mikayla and I set the game ablaze. Tried to cut it to pieces. Tried all our imaginations could conjure.

Nothing worked. It was impenetrable. In the end, I agreed to store it in my dorm room. I don’t want to dump it somewhere. Don’t want to live with the guilt of passing it onto another unsuspecting soul.

*Can’t kill it.*

*Don’t play it.*

Even after our victory, an itch remains in the back of my mind. The thought that it never ends.
