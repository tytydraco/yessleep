My heart races as the familiar static flickers on the screen. The clock on my nightstand reads 2:33 AM. I almost convinced myself it was a fluke—the late-night show that made my pulse quicken and my skin crawl. But tonight, something pulls me in deeper.

The screen glitches, and the masked characters emerge again, their faces distorted, their eyes gleaming through the slits of their masks. This time, the voices are more distinct, more personal.

“Milan…” one voice echoes, low and rasping, like it’s been waiting for me. “Are you ready to see yourself?”

I freeze. The voice knows my name.

“Who… Who are you?” I whisper to the screen, feeling both terrified and oddly comforted by the familiarity of the broadcast.

“We are the hidden pieces of you,” the voice replies, “The parts you cannot speak. The truth you bury beneath your silence.”

I stare, my heart pounding. The room around me seems to fade, and the low hum of the television grows louder. The figure on the screen tilts its head, watching me with a knowing, unsettling gaze.

“This town,” another voice joins in, higher-pitched, almost mocking. “It’s drowning in silence, isn’t it? A mask they all wear. And you? You’re the one who doesn’t fit. You know it. They know it. But none of you dare to speak it.”

My eyes dart to the door, as though the walls themselves might be listening. I’ve been trying to ignore it for years—the truth clawing at me, the feeling that something’s wrong. The feeling of being watched, of being other. I shift uncomfortably under the covers.

The TV flickers again, and the characters start moving, their heads jerking unnaturally as they speak in unison. “You know what happens when you speak. You break the signal. You shatter the illusion. And they will never forgive you.”

I swallow hard. It’s too much. The voices, the riddles, the unshakable sense of being watched—it’s all too much. I reach for the remote but hesitate. There’s a strange pull, a desire to understand, to know what this show wants from me.

“What do you want from me?” I ask, my voice trembling.

The masked figures lean closer to the screen. “We want you to remember who you are,” the voice whispers. “We want you to break free.”

The TV crackles. The image distorts, and for a moment, I see something in the reflection of the screen—a figure, familiar but not quite right. A version of myself?

“It is the lie,” the voice murmurs. “You are not who they say you are. You are who you choose to be.”

My breath hitches. The room seems to close in around me, the weight of the show’s words pressing against my chest.

Suddenly, the screen flickers to black. Silence. And then, in a cold whisper, “Come back to us, Milan. Before it’s too late.”

My hands shake as I turn off the TV. The room feels suffocating, oppressive. But the question remains—what does it mean to break free? And who are these masked figures who seem to know exactly what I’m too afraid to admit?

With the lights off, I lie in bed, wide awake, unable to shake the feeling that the show is more than just a strange late-night broadcast. It feels like a warning, a call from something deeper within. Something I can no longer ignore.

The show will be back tomorrow night.
