I’m from Haryana—aka the land of ghee, gaalis, and great-hearted people. Contrary to what movies may show, not everyone here is a wrestler or a buffalo whisperer. We’re chill. Most of us are into farming, food, and full-on hospitality. And don’t even get me started on our language—Haryanvi isn’t just a dialect, it’s a whole vibe. You’ve either laughed with it… or been scolded into silence by it.

Anyway, in 2023, my family and I decided to do something wild—move to Delhi. Because clearly, we weren’t stressed enough already.

We finally found a 3BHK apartment in a super posh Delhi colony that screamed “expensive” from the moment we saw the nameplate. It wasn’t one of those shady “cheaper than a phone” haunted flats from horror movies—nope, this place was fancy, over budget, and full of green views from both sides. But you know how desi parents are: once maa set foot in that sunlit kitchen, it was game over. Logic? Gone. Budget? Gone-er. This was going to be our first owned home, even if it meant sacrificing a few kidneys emotionally.

When we went to see it, it wasn’t empty. The owners still lived there—a sweet retired teacher and her husband, a former bank manager. Their daughter lived nearby and had recently bought them a ground-floor flat. There was no lift in the building, and with the lady’s diabetes requiring frequent checkups and insulin visits, climbing four flights every day had become exhausting. Her husband’s knees weren’t helping either. Age was settling in, and this shift wasn’t just about convenience — it was care. Their daughter did what most hope their children would: she made space close to her so she could look after them properly.
They were planning to shift, and lucky for us, they were selling this one.

The couple had lived in that flat since their wedding—over 30 years of memories packed into four walls. She was warm, talkative, always in bright suits with her black-and-white hair tied in a bun, offering us namkeen with a smile.

They took four months to vacate—even after selling it—because emotions. But finally, we moved in. Our first owned home. My parents lit up like Diwali diyas. They decorated every corner with love and chaos.

I chose the best bedroom—obviously. It was the only one tucked away from the rest of the house, perfect for ignoring humans and embracing Wi-Fi. My Pinterest dreams came alive: pink walls, indoor plants, a round bed (don’t ask), a big mirror, and a desk for looking productive. It was vintage before. Now? It was me.

2024 was wholesome. First job celebrations, maa-baba’s anniversary, family dinners, and occasional drama (because what’s a happy family without screaming over AC remote rights?). But this house felt lucky. And my room? It was my safe space. I’d stay in there all day until my mom banged the door yelling, “Bas kar! Come out and act like you have relatives!”

Then came February 2025.

We got the news that the elder lady—the original owner—had passed away due to a heart attack. Baba went to her funeral. I was genuinely sad. P

Life went on.

I still slept alone in my room, up late as usual, reading. That night was nothing new—AC humming, warm lights on, Fourth Wing by Rebecca Yarros in hand. Half-asleep, half-fangirling over fictional men.

Then I heard it—a soft creak. Like a wardrobe door opening.

I groaned. Probably my messy pile of clothes staging a rebellion. I walked over. But to my shock, the wardrobe was neat. Like… magazine neat. I assumed Maa had done it, cursed my own laziness, and searched for my hidden stash—gifts from my boyfriend, Polaroids, love letters that were more cringe than cute. All safe.

I messed up a few shirts while checking and thought, future me can deal with this. I jumped back in bed and resumed reading.

Just as I was dozing off, the wardrobe creaked again.

This time I rolled over and muttered, “Clean yourself if you want. Good night.” And knocked out.

Next morning, I was late for work and almost forgot the wardrobe drama. Later in the day, I called Maa to say, “Please don’t touch my cupboard, okay? I’ll clean it myself.”

Her reply?

“I haven’t touched your mess. I have board exam classes and zero motivation to enter your disaster zone.”

Okay… what?

But whatever. If ghosts want to organize my wardrobe, I fully support them.

Except, things didn’t stop there.

Over the next few days:
	•	My plants were always turned toward the sun.
	•	My scattered books? Stacked. Bookmarks perfectly placed.
	•	My mirror? Spotless. Like… who’s cleaning this?

But the weirdest thing was the smell—not of incense or anything creepy. Just… a faint scent of Dettol and rose talcum powder. Comforting. Familiar.

It hit me—it was her. The lady who’d lived in this home for over thirty years. That scent was hers. That old-school warm-clean vibe of Dettol and rose talc… like a memory quietly folded into the walls.

Still, I wasn’t scared. It felt… safe. Like someone was watching over me, not watching me.

One night, during a power cut, I was at my desk, cranky and phoneless. The corridor light was off, but the moonlight came through the window just enough.

And then I saw her.

For a second, standing near my wardrobe. Wearing a bright purple suit, dupatta pinned properly, silver earrings, her hair half-black, half-white, tied in a neat bun. She looked around the room gently, like she was checking if everything was okay.

Then she smiled. The kind of smile that says, “Good. You’re taking care of it.”

And she disappeared.

The next morning at breakfast, Maa casually said, “Today’s her tervi. Baba’s gone to the bhog.”

The 13th day. The last prayer. The farewell.

That night, I dreamt of her. She was sitting in my pink chair, watering the plant. She got up, walked to the window, looked at me, and smiled—just like before. Then, she was gone. For good.

When I woke up, the room felt… peaceful. Still. Like it had exhaled.

Nothing’s happened since. No creaks. No scent. No signs.

But sometimes, late at night, when I’m lying with a book and the fan humming above me, I feel like the room remembers her. Like it remembers both of us.

Because maybe she never haunted the house.

Maybe she just loved it too much to leave…

Until she knew it was loved again.
