I don’t know how to start this. I’m having to process a lot. A lot that I need to get out to someone in hopes that they don’t make the mistakes I made and am trying to correct as I write this.

Colleen passed away. She’s been dead for a few days now. I was at her funeral. Her family’s taken it hard. Her sons, they’re both around my age, they’ve lost their mom. My mom’s lost a friend. This town lost one of its few residents. We’re all shocked. Actually, not all of us. I should say everyone else has been shocked by it.

Logan and I weren’t. Not after what we saw. Not after what we ran from.

I feel really broken up about what happened. Whatever Colleen was trying to do to us, that wasn’t her. It was the child. The child made her do it.

A part of me thinks that maybe I could have saved her. Maybe I could’ve acted sooner. Maybe I should’ve gone over to the Kinsey House and started throwing all our silverware at the family. I didn’t though. I didn’t know entirely what I was dealing with.

I don’t know exactly what happened to Colleen. My parents were vague about what actually happened. Only that Harold, her husband, found her lying in the bathroom. I wondered if her eye was still blue when he found her.

At the wake, her eyes were shut in the open casket. I would’ve probably caused all sorts of sacrilege if I lifted her eye lid to check the color underneath.  

My mom could hardly talk about her without breaking down. Dad has been doing his best to console Mom and Colleen’s husband. They didn’t ask too many questions when I told them I wanted to go out with Logan. That we needed to clear our heads. Which, to an extent, was true.

“Where’re you going?” Mom asked.

“The mall.”

“Who’s driving?”

“Logan. He just got his license.”

“That’s probably good for the both of you. Text me when you get there.”

“I will,” I promised.

Logan came over the next morning in his mom’s Toyota Camry. I had on my backpack. Inside were my notes, a steak knife, some energy bars, bandages and a water bottle. We were quiet for the first couple minutes as we took the interstate north.

Did you see them?” Logan asked. “The Kinseys? Were they at the funeral?”

I shook my head. “My parents said they were at the reception after. They didn’t say much though.”

“Was the child with them?” he asked. I could see his hands shifting nervously on the wheel when he brought up Rowan.

“I don’t know. I don’t know if he was there or not. My parents didn’t mention him.”

Logan got quiet again. I looked in the backseat of the car. Logan’s bag was much bigger than mine. Overstuffed with silverware, crosses, a book or two on the paranormal, and maybe a plastic bottle filled with holy water that he’d managed to grab at Colleen’s funeral.

“We should’ve dropped a silver coin or something in her coffin before she was buried,” Logan said.

I turned toward him again. “Why?”   

A joyless laugh came out of him which caused my spine to tense.  

“So she doesn’t come back.”

The rain was drizzling that day. Logan played some music from his playlist. I watched the trees passing by on the interstate and I tried not to think about Colleen returning from her grave. I pictured Rowan instead. His black teeth snarling. I took what comfort I could in knowing that I had frightened him. Whatever he was he knew I was not going to be an easy victim.

It was almost an hour drive to Tinsdale. Or I guess what used to be Tinsdale. The Lumber Town shut down in the eighties from the bits of information I could find in a Google search. Now it was part of a forest preserve.

As we pulled into the trailhead, I noticed a few other vehicles in the parking lot. None of them were the Kinseys’ car.

Logan looked out the windshield as he parked. Hemlocks and firs greeted us at the entrance. I grabbed my backpack and pulled out an energy bar.

“You got another of those?” Logan asked.

“Yeah,” I said.

I kept eating. Logan looked at me some more. I could practically see the drool on his lips as he watched me eat.

“Did you not pack anything to eat?”

“Not really. No.”

“Are you kidding?”

“I had other things I had to prioritize.”

“Like what? The garlic and holy water?”

“Uh, yeah.”

I could’ve argued about how stupid it was to not bring any food with him. My parents always instilled in me that no matter how difficult the trail you should always bring enough to sustain yourself.

“Did you even bring any water?”

“The holy one.”

I shook my head as I handed Logan one of my energy bars.

While Logan ate, I checked my phone for the hiking trail. From what I could tell it would take ten or twenty minutes to get to what remained of the town. I looked back at Logan’s backpack. It’s overweight size. Probably twenty-five minutes with him lugging that on his back.

“You should take out somethings from your bag,” I said.

“No way, dude. We don’t know what we could be facing up there.”

“Which’s why we should be ready to run.”

Logan shook his head. We argued for a bit about it. I got him to leave the books he’d brought. That lightened his load enough that I was ready to start our hike to Tinsdale and whatever mysteries we might find.

It took us half an hour to get to the spot that was closest to the Tinsdale Lumber Town. I was sweating a little but the drizzling rain helped keep me cool for most of the hike. Logan though, he was sitting on a log catching his breath. His shoulders were bothering him from the heaviness of his backpack while he needed to drink from my water bottle. I probably should’ve given him an “I told you so” but I have more experience hiking with my parents then he does with his. Plus, we had a more urgent matter that we had to deal with. We still had to find the town.

“We gotta go off trail now,” I said.

Logan wheezed. I didn’t want to go on without him but it seemed like it might be my only option if he didn’t start moving soon.

“Okay…al…alright.” He took a deep breath as he stood back up.

I was the first to step through the ferns and ivy. We walked for a couple minutes on rough wet dirt. My sneakers squelched once or twice on mud. I could hear Logan breathing heavily behind me.

“What…what’s that?” Logan asked.

I didn’t notice anything at first. Just the trees around us until I saw the mailboxes. Rows of them. All rusted in a line. I looked around some more. There were the remnants of homes crumbled from the elements. The pieces of wood that held them together molded and soggy. I checked my phone. There was no service but I knew we’d made it.

“This’s got to be it,” I said.

Logan let out a relieved breath. He set down his backpack and took out some coins, a shovel, and his holy water. I only took out my knife, now feeling like I was underprepared.

First, we inspected the rusted mailboxes. Some of them had fallen over and most of the names had peeled off. We could make out a little of one that might’ve been a Wallace or a Wallard. No Kinsey.

Next, we checked the remnants of the houses. Among the debris were pieces of cloth that might have once been clothing but were now scraps for rat’s nests. Rusted screws, old tools and chair legs were also among the scraps we found. Other than that, nothing. I was beginning to think we’d made a mistake coming to the town. Whatever might’ve been here was probably taken over by the forest by now.

That was until we started looking into what used to be the backyards.

I noticed a strange stone covered in moss. It was cracked and standing oddly. I rubbed off the moss and was met with a date. Two actually. I called Logan over. We inspected the stone.

May 3^(rd) 1948—March 13 1949.

A grave. A baby’s grave.

Not too far from it we found another and another and then another.

I’m not sure how many we found close to the ruined homes. I stopped keeping track after ten. Each had different birthdates but their end was the same. March 13, 1949. I did a few estimates and the highest age I could find was ten years old. All of them children and babies.

“Where’s the adults?” Logan asked.

We couldn’t find any around us. We decided to go down the line of mailboxes again and check for more graves. When we reached the end of the “road” I heard something snap. I froze and looked at Logan. He raised his shovel while I put my knife up. We looked around waiting for someone to come out of the ferns. A gray squirrel leapt into our line of sight and began chewing on a pinecone only to realize it was being watched by two armed teenagers.

Truly, the bravest duo anyone has ever seen.

When the squirrel ran up a tree, Logan and I lowered our weapons. We went further past the road. I was looking straight ahead when Logan started to yell.

“Miles! Look out!”

I stopped. While getting lost in my head looking for grave markers, I didn’t pay attention to the ground beneath my feet. In front of me were dozens and dozens of holes. Not small holes either. They were deep with stones placed in a circle around each one.

“Thanks for the save,” I said.

I kicked one of the stones down in the nearest hole to see if I could hear anything unusual. There was nothing. Just the plop of a stone falling onto dirt. Logan was looking down another hole.  

“You see anything?” I asked.

“Yeah.”

“Really?”

“Something metal in this one.”

I went over to take a look. I was expecting something large but all I saw were tree roots and dirt.

“Where?” I asked.

“Right there.” He pointed straight down. I could see a small metal circle at the bottom. About the size of a quarter.

“What is it?”

Logan didn’t say anything. He put down his shovel and holy water and began to step into the hole. I touched his shoulder to stop him.

“Don’t be dumb,” I said.

“I’m not. We need anything we can get. Just help me up when I grab it.”

I was worried. These holes felt off. I looked around to check that there was no one else around. Logan was sliding down the dirt and already at the bottom when I looked back. It was only about six or seven feet to the bottom. He grabbed whatever it was and I couldn’t see what he was doing with it.

“What is it?” I asked.

“It’s a necklace.”

“A necklace?”

Logan came back to where I was leaning. He tried to lift himself out of the hole only for the dirt to give way under his feet.

“Smooth.”

“I told you to help me up,” he said annoyed.

I offered my hand down to him and helped him up. 

“What’d you get?”

Logan grabbed his bottle of holy water first and started to clean dirt off the necklace. He turned it in his fingers again before handing it to me.

It was a locket. A really rusty locket. With the dirt washed off I could see a strange symbol carved on the front. It reminded me of a trumpet with an hourglass inside of it. I kept running my finger over the symbol. A primal fear starting to come over me. I wanted to throw the locket back into the hole. Maybe throw it into the ocean so no one could ever find it.

“Open it,” Logan said.

His eyes had not left the locket. He also seemed frightened of the symbol. Slowly I opened it. Inside there was a small painting. A portrait. In it was a small boy with red hair and two discolored eyes. One brown and the other bright blue.

“It’s him. It’s Rowan,” I said.

There was a date on the locket. March 13, 1949.

After seeing the date, I could hear ferns swaying and sticks breaking under feet. I looked around frantically as two shambling bodies came running down the row of mailboxes towards me and Logan.

“Oh fuck, oh fuck,” Logan said as he grabbed the necklace from my hand.

I started moving down the row of holes hoping we could make some distance between us and the Kinseys. I yelled at Logan to start moving. He threw some coins in his pocket in the Kinseys direction and started following behind me. I was almost to the end of the holes when I noticed movement at the corner of my eye.

It was Mrs. Kinsey. Her head swayed side to side in a childish motion as she went around the holes while her husband took up the rear. Logan was right behind me. I was in total flight mode at that moment. I could hear the Kinseys breathing. Moans and high-pitched whistles coming out of their mouths as the couple herded us. I didn’t know where else to go. I kept moving forward until my feet fell out from under me and I crashed into a hole.

“Miles!” I heard Logan yell.

I groaned and started to cough. My clothes were covered in dirt. A tried to get up quickly only to feel pain in my right arm. I had landed on it. I didn’t have time to do a checkup as Mrs. Kinsey was at the top of the hole now. Her discolored eyes looking down at me as she smiled.

“Play,” Mrs. Kinsey said happily. “Play with me, boy.”

She jumped in. Her body tackled me to the dirt. I could feel her nails in my shoulder as her matted gray hair filled my mouth. I was certain that her head went 180 degrees like an owl as she pressed the back of her head into my face and smashed her scalp into my head as if it were a club.

“Ge..get…get…off!” I cried.

I tried to reach for something while the old woman kept her twisted body pressed into mine. I tried to pull her off weakly with my left hand. She didn’t budge. I was expecting everything to go black. The pain in my nose and head started to overwhelm me as Mrs. Kinsey was preparing to bash the back of her head into me again.

I’m not sure how Logan did it but his shovel fell into the hole and directly into Mrs. Kinsey’s face. It was enough to spook her and lessen the pressure she had on my shoulders. I wiggled out from under her. As I got my back up against the dirt wall of the hole my left hand touched something.

I looked down to find the knife I had brought. As I grabbed it, Mrs. Kinsey’s head turned forward to face me. She was giving a wide smile. Her teeth caked in dirt. Tears formed in my eyes and blurred my vision. I braced my back against the dirt and raised the knife.

I don’t remember how I managed to do it. I must’ve gone full lizard brain as I jabbed the knife forward. I couldn’t aim with my eyes covered in dirt. I swung forward and backward. My one good arm in a frenzy that probably matched the Kinsey’s own motions. I felt the knife go in to something hard. I kept motioning it forward.

“Get away! Get away! Get away!” I screamed.

I waited for Mrs. Kinsey to start digging her nails into me and for her head to bash into me.

It never came. I wiped my eyes with my sleeve and saw Mrs. Kinsey. Her body flat on the dirt. Her face cut up and maimed. Blood dripped from the marks made by my knife. I took a deep breath and noticed her left eye had been gouged.

I had done it. I had killed Mrs. Kinsey.

I lowered my knife and started to vomit. All the energy bars and water I had taken just came back up. My right arm erupted in pain again as a bent lower. I was in so much pain. My throat burned from the bile. I felt the worst I’d ever felt in my life. But I was still alive.

“Logan!” I screamed.

There was no response. I needed to find a way out of that hole. I tried moving my arm. I could move it which meant it wasn’t broken but that didn’t make it any less painful. I stood up trying to keep an eye on Mrs. Kinsey’s body. Worried that she might start to move at any moment. If she did, I knew I would’ve shit myself and made the place much smellier than it already was.

I tried to heave myself up with my good arm only to slide back down. I tried calling for Logan again. I noticed his shovel at Mrs. Kinsey’s feet. I wondered what had happened to him? Was he even still alive? Where was Mr. Kinsey?

All of this was running through my head as I picked up the shovel and started to dig at the dirt. It was slow going but I managed to make a mound on top of Mrs. Kinsey’s body. Before I covered her completely, I noticed a mark on the back of her neck. The same spot where the bandage had been. It was the same symbol as had been on the locket. A trumpet with an hourglass.

I didn’t stare at it for long and I started to dig dirt on top of her more. I tried not to think about what kind of desecration I was doing as I stepped onto the dirt covering the corpse and heaved myself up to the edge of the hole. My good arm was the first out of the hole followed by my head and shoulders. When I started to slip, I put out my bad arm and forced myself out.

“Lo…Logan!” I called again. Wheezing and half crying.

At first, I couldn’t hear anything but the sound of branches shifting in the breeze. I took a moment before I got to my feet. I made sure to watch where I stepped so I wouldn’t fall into another hole. As I got up, I started to hear something. Ferns were waving and branches snapped as something ran into the woods. I couldn’t tell who it was. I didn’t have the knife or shovel on me since it was hard enough getting myself out. I moved slowly down the former town’s street. My injured arm stiff at my side.

I didn’t try to call out now. I was too scared of the possibility of Mr. Kinsey coming and attacking me like his wife. I kept looking around to see if I could find any sign of Logan. When I was closer to the houses where we’d found the babies’ graves, I could hear sniffling.

I was cautious as I moved closer to the sound. Taking slow steps toward the small graves. As I came around the remnants of a wooden wall I could see Logan. His body crouched over a grave.

“Hey…hey, Logan. You okay, dude?”

His hair was covered in sweat. I could tell he was clutching something as he started to get up. I wasn’t sure what to expect as he turned. He was clutching his wrist when he faced me. I could see the blood leeching through his fingers.

“What…what happened?”

“He carved me,” Logan said crying. “He…he carved me with his nails.”

I knew what Logan was talking about when I saw the wound. It was a little difficult to make out with all the blood. But I could see the trumpet-like shape. The same shape on the locket. The same shape on Mrs. Kinsey’s neck.  

\_\_\_

It took us less time to get back to the parking lot then it did to get to Tinsdale. We stood for a while before grabbing our backpacks. Both of us were on edge at every sound we heard. At any moment I expected Mr. Kinsey to tackle one of us on the trail and start carving in our flesh. Logan had gone back for the knife and shovel I’d left so we weren’t entirely defenseless. I told him about what’d happened with Mrs. Kinsey. How I had stabbed her in the face and it was probably the jab to the eye that had ended her.

Logan nodded and didn’t say anything.

On our way down, we saw two hikers. Both of them seemed horrified by our appearance. An old man with a hiking stick asked if we needed a medic. I told him we were fine; we’d just taken the wrong turn on the trail.

Not sure if that eased any of his worries about the shape we were in, but I didn’t hear him ask any more questions.

Logan bandaged his wrist a little with some cloth wraps I’d packed in my bag. I poured the last of my drinking water on it to hopefully stop any kind of infection. Once it was clean and I could see the fresh wound I knew that an infection was the least of our worries.

“It’s not finished,” I said looking at the mark on his wrist.

Logan glanced at me. His body in a sweat that probably wasn’t from the hike down.

“How do you know?”

“I saw it on Mrs. Kinsey,” I said. “The hourglass. He didn’t finish the hourglass.”

Logan seemed to relax a little as he slumped his shoulders. It was probably little comfort but it was something. Whatever Mr. Kinsey had been trying to do he hadn’t finished it.

My phone vibrated. There were a few unread texts. All of them from my parents. They wanted to know where I was, when I was coming home, and why I wasn’t answering.

I’m gonna be dead when they see me. That’s what I thought as I replied to the messages. I knew that they’d be horrified by the state I was in. I needed to clean myself up before I went home. I didn’t want my parents to know about what I’d been doing.

“Can we stop at your place?”  

Logan stopped checking his wrist.  

“Sure, why?”

I pointed at my clothes and bruises.

“I can’t go home like this.”

Logan looked at me and nodded. He started the car and we left the parking lot. Logan continued his story when we were back on the interstate.

“The holy water freaked him out. I managed to dump some on him and that’s when he stopped.”

“What about the necklace?” I asked.

“He took it. First thing he grabbed when he pinned me down.”

I thought about these things as we drove home and continued thinking about them at Logan’s house. The symbol, the holy water, the silver. Rowan and the Kinseys had to be something demonic. If the picture was accurate then Rowan had to be in his late seventies. At least. Whether Logan was going to become like the Kinseys, I also didn’t know.

After I showered and borrowed a pair of clothes, Logan drove me home. The Kinsey car wasn’t in the driveway.

“I’m going to get more water from the church,” Logan said. “I don’t care how but I’m going to get more. I’ll bring you some later.”

I thanked him and told him to be safe.

“You need to be safe, dude. They know we’re a threat and you’re right next door.”

He was right. I had to make a plan for how to keep Mr. Kinsey and the child away. I considered telling my parents that we had to leave. That there was an emergency and they needed to trust me. I wasn’t sure if that would be enough. They would want answers and everything I had to share sounded insane but my bruises were enough of an explanation. I could pin them on the Kinseys which wouldn’t be a lie.

When I went inside my dad was there on the living room couch. I set my backpack down.

“Your mom was worried,” he said.

He sounded disappointed. I wasn’t in the mood to hear it. All I really wanted was to go to my room with all the silverware I’d already laid out and wait for Logan to bring some holy water.

“Sorry,” I said.

I tried to hide the pain in my arm. There were bruises on my legs and shoulders along with the puncture marks from Mrs. Kinsey’s nails. The clean clothes I borrowed from Logan covered those well enough. I needed to find the right time to show them to my parents.

“Thankfully your mom has someone to keep her busy,” Dad said.

I was confused by what he meant. I noticed she wasn’t in the living room which was odd for my mom. Normally if she was worried about me, it would be her waiting for my arrival to chew me out.  

“Where’s she at?”

I nearly dropped to my knees at my dad’s next words. “At the Kinseys. They needed a babysitter.”

I didn’t think about anything at that moment. Now thinking about it I was probably doing the stupidest thing after what I’d gone through in Tinsdale but I ran out the door anyway. Dad yelled my name as I went to the Kinsey House. I punched the door with my good arm. Really punched it, just to get Mom to answer.

“Mom! Mom! Mom!”

I kept punching. Hoping that my mom would come to the door.

The door started to open. I saw my mom’s face appear from the other side. She tilted her head as she did when she was bothered by something I was doing. I nearly gave a sigh of relief.

I say nearly because that was when I noticed my mom’s left eye. It was blue.

I was too late. The child had found a replacement. My mom was no longer my mom.
