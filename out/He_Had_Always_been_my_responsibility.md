It was dark, and bitter cold, with the moonless night it was hard to see even your hand in front of your face. Still in this pitch black he was out there, and I knew I could not sleep till he was found.

A living shadow, he reveled in the dark. Every night he did this. Every night he slunk about in the cloak of pitch, and it was my responsibility to find him and bring him back to the light. My responsibility to go out into the blackness and seek him. No matter how cold, no matter how dark.

I pulled on my winter overalls, even with their insolation I knew the cold would still gnaw at my bones. The cold would seep through everything I wore. No coat, gloves, or hat would keep me warm. But I still put them all on. They may not keep me warm but they keep the frost bite away.

The darkness seemed to eat any and all light. No matter how bright the flash light was, I still felt nearly blind. But he was my responsibility. I had to go out. I had to find him. 

Like always my first stop was the cows. He liked to linger at the edges of the herd. Sometimes I was lucky and this stop would be my last. But I was not lucky today.

“Have you seen him?” I asked Henry, the bull staring me down. I knew he would not answer, he never did;  but I asked anyway. It felt better to ask, safer somehow. Like asking would keep the bull from charging me the moment I turned my back.

With his silence I moved on. The herd watching as I walked away. If he was not with the cows then I had to keep looking. I could not return to the safety of light till I had found him.

I called into the darkness. Sometimes he’d heed my call. Come to me and we both could return to warmth. He did not feel generous today. My calls for him died, being swallowed by the remorseful howling of the wind. My trudge through the dark would have to continue. It was like this most nights. I'd walk circles around the property till he would decide to manifest before me.

Finally I gave up. My fingers were stiff with cold, despite the gloves. I couldn't keep going.Hopefully he'd be kind and appear on my way back to the door. If not, I’d have to come out again. 

There in the darkness finally my flashlight caught the reflection of eyes. Not the large eyes of a cow, they were smaller closer to the ground. He had decided to be kind after all.

“Do you just enjoy watching me chase my own shadow?” I asked him.

He did not answer. In fact his eye disappeared from the flashlight beam. That was normal. He hated being caught in the flashlight beam. Sometimes I think the light might burn him. I knew despite no longer being able to see him he was close. He would follow me back to the house.

“Do you have to do this every night?” I questioned.

Again no answer. Just like Henry he never answers.

“For once I'd like to just go to bed.” I sighed as we finally got to the door.

I opened the door and he skittered in. I followed after him. In the light of the house he was no longer a nearly invisible shade. The living shadow was no longer just a shadow. He was back to being a dog. He looked up at me tail wagging.

“Honestly Baylee. Don't look so proud of yourself.” I sighed. But my large black lab mix continued to look smug.
