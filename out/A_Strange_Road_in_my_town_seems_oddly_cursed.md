I've lived in my hometown all my life, and this road is the only one that sticks out to me. You see, I (M22) have been working for a small munitions company for about 3 years now. While I won't give out an address for obvious reason, just know that I live in a very small town, about maybe 45 minuets from any "major" city. Hell, it takes me and hour and a half just to bike to work every day. It's a beautiful bike ride on back roads of the countryside. In the small time I bike I see wooded forest, to roaring farms, back to woods. I take taxis during the winter because the cold on top of the snow makes it impossible to bike in. The road I bike on is maybe 10 miles long. I'm not really good with distance, I kind of just zone out when biking and listen to music on my phone. Most of the time the road is clear, maybe only seeing 1 or 2 cars at max when I bike, and that goes both ways, to and from my house. You'll see why this all matters soon.

Anyways I've noticed a very strange occurrence while biking this road, and it's only this one road. Every Tuesday, no matter if I am taking a cab or biking, about maybe a mile and a half down the road I start to feel very lightheaded for no reason. Not enough to stop me from biking but enough to notice, and it's only on Tuesdays. Any other day of the week I'm fine but Tuesdays, yeah, they are the Issue. Now it may seem minor, which yeah it is, there is more.

Mondays are strange two, because I've noticed a weird trend as well. Every 1st Monday of the month, 1 of two things occur. Either there is some massive car accident, which usually causes major injuries or in some cases, actual death, or there is some form a vehicular issue. Even with a few cabs I've ridden in it seems like the car will begin to go haywire. The car will just stop running, a tire pops or the car will spin out, even if there is no ice or water on the road.

Death also seems to happen a lot on this road. I want to say there is maybe 14 houses in total, again, back country. 4 of which have burned down, and strangely killing anyone that is inside. 3 houses have been home to known murders in my country, all of which have since been caught thank goodness. And 1 singular mansion that has been abandon for nearly 150 years. I'll talk about that after because that in itself is a topic for later.

Even the woods are seemly off. I bike at around 4am until I get to work for 6am. In the morning, before the sun comes up, I try keeping my eyes off the wood. Yeah, I know the forest is natural creepy at night, but this was not a sense of creepiness. It almost like a " l'appel du vide" moment. The forest seemingly calls out to you, wanting you to enter. Of course, naturally on one of my days off I decided to do a little bit of hiking with my partner (F19) as a date.

At first nothing seemed odd. There were a couple abandon hunters' tents throughout the woods, couple of beer bottles and the usually expect random clearing with a fire pit, but some of the trees seemed to have been trail blazed. Now this is normal for hunters to do to gauge at their surroundings but these, no matter how far deep we were, seemed fresh. For the record, about 70% of the woods is pine trees, which when cut excrete pine sap. And there was pine sap oozing from these trees. We never saw another person when we were out in those woods. Now it could have easily been a hunter who was just barely ahead of us, but what are the odds that we followed in the same exact direction as this hunter without doing it on purpose.

The last part has to be the Mansion. It's massive, extremely massive. It's called the "Hamilton Mansion" because according to rumor the family that lived there were the decedents of Alexander Hamilton, however I haven't found any proof towards it. It was built in the 1860's and was inhabited until the depression hit in the 1920's. Now keep in mind any information I have on this house is from my public library, and I've tried to look online but I've found nothing. Haven't been inside, the entire left side of the building has collapsed, and the right side is on life support. The house is creepy as hell though, and the closest I've gotten to it is the roundabout driveway it has.

Hamilton's Mansion is also pretty far of the main road, but again, I'm not good with distance so maybe a mile? I don't know but it's still odd, especially since it seems that all the previous events that I've experienced all happen near to the road that goes towards this home. Maybe I am paranoid, but this can't all be a coincidence, right?
