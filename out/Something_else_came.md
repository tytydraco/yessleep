I used to think the world made sense. And even something doesn't, someone could always make sense of it eventually. Emphasis on used to.
It was a Monday evening, dragging my worn boots, exhausted from my dayjob as a guard at the local Winston & Winston. Guarding is all I can do with my limited schooling my Ma had given me. The path I take from my job to home is always the same—the same old cement and the same old flickering streetlights in the same dimly lit 49th and 23rd street. I never really figured out why they flicker, is it for me? Maybe for something else?

The fog was heavy tonight but my mind was clear: get home and feed my 2-year-old tabby cat I named Queen who must have been very hungry, and then pass out in bed. As I walk, I should have heard something, footsteps, boots, a vehicle belching its smoke. What I can hear is my own steps and my loud breathing like I entered an empty hallway. The kind of silence that dont feel right.

A few more minutes of thinking and I should have seen my apartment. Yeah or so I thought. A three-storey building of wood and mortar, painted with yellow and rust. Mrs. Daisy, an old widow greets and waves without missing a beat every Mondays. Thats my apartment. 

But sure, I did see a building that fit this description: rusty yellow to ward off mold, three sets of windows to indicate three floors. Yes, it is where I am writing as of this moment. But it is not. I stopped for a bit making sure I wasn't lost in my head. 
I swear I did not take a turn. 
My God, I couldn't have.  
There should be no opportunities to turn left or right. Yet my hairs at my back prickled like I was in danger. There was none, or so as far as I could see. I took my time going in, I tried to look for another person but I didnt. Maybe I was trying to find a sense of normal. You know, kind of like the herd in nat— wait.

...sorry for stopping for a bit. I moved myself from my living room to my bedroom as Queen—my supposed cat was in front of my door. She meowed and I thought it was her but God Almighty that wasn't her! Her fur is different. Yellow over a black coat. Jesus I know my cat! I had her for two years. Every bit of my instincts told me not to open the door. I blocked it with a table and locked the window she liked to use to enter when hungry.
Her meows are getting angrier. It's becoming more of a screech and wailing, wailing of a little child.
And the scratching. 
The scratching. 
Her claws and paws must be bleeding but she keeps scratching. I'm scared she could break a hole in the door. 
Shes still there as I write this.
I hope the door holds.

But no, yeah, I found no one else. Even my groceries don't look the same. I always put my tomatoes in the right, the cheese in the left. It's different now. The milk below the cabinet, not inside. I swear. Mrs. Daisy's little hole in the wall? From where she waves and smiles? She should have been there. I looked. Nothing. A candle and a curious tall potted cactus plant was there instead. 

The table I'm writing on, the bed I'm glancing at right now, they look the same but they aint mine. I swear. They feel a bit off, too clean or too dirty, the window is too bright or too dark. The ceiling where the bits of loose paint form faces? The faces are gone except for one. The one face I stare at before I go to bed. It reminds me of my Ma, soft eyebrows and a warm line that looks like a smile. It's not smiling anymore. Wherever I go, the two holes that seemed like eyes look at me. I can't think straight anymore. 

What the hell is this? 

My mattress feels too soft. Or too stiff. I can't tell but it's not right. Even the floor is too cold. Maybe too warm? The cobwebs I could not reach were gone. I ran my fingers beneath my desk and the name I carved was gone. 

IT WAS MY NAME.  Gone. The wood as smooth as porcelain.

Where was it?

I stared at the ceiling, the walls, the furniture that is too clean, too dirty or too soft or hard.
I listened to the creature that kept clawing at my door, its wails becoming more human.

And at this moment I knew, I knew that this place was waiting for me. 

Waiting for me to admit that this place wasn't my home anymore.
