I am a stay-at-home dad, and my wife works in a hospital, earning enough money, so I don't need to work. We have three kids aged 10, 8, and 5.  
  
One day, my wife surprised me with a month-long vacation. When we told the kids, they were ecstatic as it was their first vacation. On the day of our departure, we ensured that all electronic devices were turned off, and we shut off all water usage, not wanting to pay for anything we didn't use.  
  
As we were driving to the airport, our 5-year-old exclaimed, "Mommy, Daddy, I forgot Mr. Fluffles!" Mr. Fluffles is his plushie. I decided to turn back to get it since we hadn't gone far yet. I instructed the kids to wait in the car while I retrieved Mr. Fluffles. When I went inside, I noticed the basement door was open, but I was sure it was closed when we checked everything before leaving. It seemed strange, but I dismissed it, closed the door, and returned to the car. I asked my wife if we had forgotten to close the basement door, but she reassured me it was locked the whole time. Surprisingly, she seemed unfazed and not scared at all.  
  
During our vacation, something strange happened that made me uneasy. I was lying in bed, thinking about the open basement door incident again when I realized the light was on. We never unlocked the basement door since we didn't need it, and it left me sweating with fear. I tried to convince myself it was just my imagination and brushed it off when my wife asked about my sweating. However, when I confided in her about the incident, she went pale, which was unusual since she's not someone who easily gets scared.  
  
We returned home without any further issues, and everything seemed normal. However, upon arriving home, my uneasiness returned. Late at night, while still at home before moving to her sister's, I received a notification on my phone that motion was detected in the basement, hallway, and upper hallway. I went to check and saw a shadow outside the door. The door opened, and I heard it go into my kids' bedroom, followed by a scream.  
  
I woke up my wife and whispered that there was something inside our house. She seemed on edge, and her usual fearlessness was replaced by concern. Then we heard sirens; the police had arrived. "It" ran away and probably went into the basement. The police questioned us, and our kids were really hurt. When we tried to get into the basement, we couldn't find a key; "it" probably had it. The police couldn't do anything because the door wouldn't open, and we couldn't bomb our house, so we needed to sleep at my wife's sister's. When we got there, we instantly cried we couldn't hold it in anymore.  
  
Her sister told us it was over now, and we could sleep peacefully. It was again 3:00 AM when the door opened. I was awake, and at first, I thought that it was my wife's sister, but why should she go out at 3:00 AM? Then I heard a scream. I grabbed my family, and we ran into the woods. We were hiding in a bush and saw her sister running towards us; she said, "It, It attacked us. My husband is..." It ran past us, grabbing her sister. That was the last time we saw her. So we tried running away, and we hid again when my 10-year-old daughter whispered, "Mom, Dad, I didn't take my allergy pills." My wife and I looked at her shocked when she sneezed. Whatever "It" was, however fast it was, and however we tried to hide, "It" had heard us.
