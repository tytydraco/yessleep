For centuries I roamed the Earth searching for another human to take my place. My body nearly gave up on me hundreds of times, but it would never give up on me fully. I roamed through forests, cities, and more. The days were hot; the nights were cold. 

My journey started in an overgrown forest with a tree taller than the rest. It was shaped like an umbrella. I went through various biomes, but there was never anything quite as unique as that tree. 

One night, I decided to get some shut eye so I would have more energy in the morning. I looked for suitable places to rest, when I made a haunting discovery. The tree. The same umbrella tree.

I did not know if I was stuck in an endless loop, or so disoriented from being alive for so long that I simply took a wrong turn, but it was there. I could almost hear the creature and universe mocking me at once. The creature said it would be over soon. It was not over.

I remember collapsing to the ground begging for the universe to show me the way—to take me to find humanity. And somehow, for once, I was blessed. 

A path lit up before me and I followed it. Time blended together, and it was as if it never existed. The journey was long, and the terrain was more horrific than ever before. 
Unexplained bites on me, my eyes popping out of their sockets from the horrors I witnessed, and blood permanently ingrained in my skin from everything I ever killed. 

But somehow, someway, I made it. There I was, the happiest I had ever been to see hunting gear, paintings on caves, and a warm fire. It appeared everyone was away—but that’s okay. I waited this long, I could wait a little longer.

Unfortunately nobody came back. Just when I started to lose hope, I spotted a little girl. She was startled by my unhuman-like appearance at first. But when she composed herself, she told me she had been wandering the area for a long time because she fell behind her family when they were searching for a new, better area to live.

I hesitated for a moment. I could help her find her family. Perhaps I could even find another human who actually deserved the curse of immortality. I regret insulting that witch deeply, but I do not believe it was justification to doom me to this suffering. 

But then the universe spoke to me in the same voice that creature had, using its exact words. “You’re safe here. It will all be over soon.” 

That’s when realization dawned on me. The creature and the universe were the same thing, because the universe was the creature. And the creature was humanity and its selfish desires as it failed to consider what impact it will have on others or the world. Immortality was nothing but a punishment I never deserved—nor did billions of other people deserve their “punishments.” 

My eyes twitch as I slowly reach my hands out. I just pray that she will be able to forgive me for what I’m about to do. I have become the creature I swore to destroy.
