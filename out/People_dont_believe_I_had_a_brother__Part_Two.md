I winced at the scraping sounds my old dresser made as I slid it over in front of the door.  It was largely empty at this point, but it was still heavy and unwieldly enough that I half-expected someone to knock on my door asking what I was doing in there.  Once it was snuggly against the locked door I waited, breath held and ears pricked up for any sound. 

 

Nothing.

 

Letting out a shaky breath, I went over to the bed and pulled back the covers, checking under them before getting in.  I could tell they had been changed recently, and they smelled decently fresh, but it was hard to tell anything for sure with that damned other smell everywhere I went.  What was that?  It didn’t smell like anything I remembered ever running across before, but something about it still put me on edge.  Then again, I could say that about so much at the moment.  Everything was disorienting and strange, including sleeping in my old bed at twenty-eight, afraid of something coming to get me in the dark.

 

Because that was the truth, wasn’t it?  I was afraid.  I felt a stir of embarrassed irritation at the thought.  Afraid of fucking *what*?  My old house smelling weird?  My sweet, aging parents?

 

But my attempt at distracting anger died quickly at the thought of them that night, doing and saying all the normal things in abnormal ways, lost in some uncanny valley of feigned familiarity close enough to be intentional and wrong enough to be malign.

 

That thought spun off into another.  What if they *knew* they were off?  They were doing it intentionally, or at least recognized our fear and unease and found it funny?  What if this was…

 

I woke up in darkness.

 

Heart thudding, I sat up and felt around me.  It seemed like I was still in my old bed, and the little bit of light coming through the window seemed to confirm this.  But why was the room so dark?  Had I turned off the light beside the bed?  I didn’t think so, but maybe when I was half-asleep? 

 

Reaching out, I fumbled in the black air for the lamp switch for a moment before finding it.  Twisting it, I started looking around the room, first in every direction and then more carefully.  Was everything the same?  Any sign that anyone had…

 

I froze and lowered my eyes immediately, holding still for another moment before forcing myself to casually look for my phone.  It was still in my pants pocket, and when I dug it out, I saw a missed text from Mark about twenty minutes earlier.

 

**You awake?**

 

I texted back carefully, trying to keep my hands from visibly shaking.

 

*I am now.  Sorry, I fell asleep.  You okay?*

 

Almost immediately, he responded.

 

**Yeah, I think.  I was starting to get sleepy but I heard something a few minutes ago.  Sounded like it came from the air vents.  Quiet now though.  Maybe it was a dream.**

 

Shuddering, I risked a glance over my phone at the high vent on the far wall.  The gleams of light I’d seen from inside that vent were still there, slightly brighter than before.  Closer.  I…I hadn’t been wrong. 

 

*It wasn’t a dream.  Something is in the vent.  I think I can see its eyes.*

 

**Oh God.  Do you want me to come over?**

 

I found myself shaking my head to an empty room before I shakily texted back, eyes darting now between my phone and the vent.  It was still there.

 

*NO.  You couldn’t in anyway without me moving stuff and unlocking.  I think we need go now.  I don’t know what this is butweneed to go.*

 

**Ok.  How?**

 

I sucked in a breath as I heard the ductwork in the far wall groan as weight shifted up there.  Was it closer?  I wasn’t sure.  I was afraid to look too long in case it didn’t know I saw it yet.  Whatever we did, it had to be fast.

 

*Windows?  Meet outside at cars?*

 

**They’re nailed shut now.  I checked already tonight.  We’d have to break them.**

 

I forced myself to take a deep breath.  I was acting like a child, wasn’t I?  What if there wasn’t anything up in the vent?  Maybe I was seeing some reflection that had always been there I’d forgotten, or some piece of tape or insulation had gotten moved and was catching the light?  Or at worst, maybe a mouse looking at me, as scared as I am?  It was an old house after all.

 

Another groan in the ductwork and I saw the thing push forward this time, sliding up to within an inch of the vent grate itself.

 

“Oh…God.”

 

It was my father’s face.  Pressed and squeezed into an impossibly small rectangle, his eyes shiny and bulging from the compressed mass.  Those eyes met mine, and I heard a wet, creaky sound that might have been a laugh.

 

*Go NOW.  Meet in the hall and we go 2gether.*

 

I leapt off the bed and slung the dresser aside, fighting with the knob for a second to unlock the door, sure I was going to get caught from behind at any moment.  Flinging open the door, I ran out into the hallway and headed for Mark’s room.  I was reaching for the handle just as it opened, Mark rushing out into me hard enough that we careened into the far hallway wall before righting ourselves and running down the hall toward the front door.

 

Mom stepped out in front of us from their bedroom, grin wide on her face as her eyes flicked between us like a metronome.  “Look at my boys.  Together again.  Eager beavers.”  She giggled to herself before looking past us.  “Aren’t you proud of them, honey?”

 

Our father’s voice boomed behind us.  “I am, I am.  We raised them right.  Taught them to give back.  Here they are, ready to help in the basement before the sun is even up.”

 

Spinning around, I saw him, naked and smeared with dust, grinning at us, his bruised-looking erection poking out from the nest of grey hair surrounding its base.  When Mark grabbed my arm, I almost screamed.  Turning to him, it struck me how much he looked like a kid, terrified eyes filling with tears.  Looking for me to protect him.  Anger starting burning through my fear.  Whatever this was, they were going to fucking let us go, even if I had to hurt them.

 

Reaching down I gave his hand a pat.  “Don’t worry, Dumble.  This’ll be okay.  We’re leaving.”   I glared at the thing that looked like our father.   “Now.”

 

I still wonder if I really thought that was true when I said it, or if it was just some comforting lie I was telling us both.  Not that it really matters.  There was no way I could understand what was about to happen.  After all, standing in that hallway between the two of them, I’d never been more terrified or enraged in my life.  Thought it was impossible to be more afraid.
