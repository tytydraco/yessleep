In high school, I lost my virginity to a cute girl named Maggie. She was my lab partner in biology class and we really hit it off and soon began dating. We hadn’t gotten the chance to get intimate in the first 3 months that we were dating. Her parents wouldn’t let us be behind closed doors and my parents were very much alike in that regard. So when an opportunity presented itself, I was ready to roll. Maggie’s parents would be gone for the weekend, and I was excited to spend some time alone with her. 

When I arrived at Maggie’s house, she put on some movie and we cuddled on the couch while snacking on chips. We got touchy with each other and soon after she led me down the hall to her bedroom. 15 minutes later, we had done the deed and were laying in bed together. I was absolutely exhausted and fell asleep quickly. I woke up late at night feeling all sweaty. It was eerily quiet, the usual sounds of the night like the insects chirping and cars going by were no longer audible. And most noticeably, Maggie’s side of the bed was empty. I called out her name but heard no response. Something felt off. 

I saw a light on in the bathroom at the end of the hall. As I walked towards it, my heart was racing. Inside the bathroom, there were small droplets of blood on the sink. I called out for Maggie yet again, this time louder and with a shaky voice. There was no response. 

I slowly walked around the house looking for her. There was a door slightly opened and with light seeping through the crack. It led to the basement, but I was scared shitless and there was no way I was going to go down there. I called out from the top of the steps, and that’s when I heard a muffled groan. I was seriously considering getting the hell out of the house, but then I thought what if someone had taken Maggie down there. She might be in danger and I couldn’t just run away. 

I slowly went down the stairs and the groaning only got louder. In the corner of the basement, I saw a horrible sight. Maggie was on all fours, facing away from me. Her arms and legs seemed to be bending in an unnatural way. I yelled “Maggie! What the fuck!”. She seemed to try turning around to face me, but it was like she was fighting against her own body. She collapsed onto the ground face down and started shaking while making gasping noises as if she was struggling to breathe. I ran over to her despite my fears and tried to turn her on her side to prevent her from suffocating. As soon as I touched her, she let out a screech and her arm grabbed my leg. I tried to run but fell to the floor, luckily on my side first rather than head. 

She was moving across the floor, crawling towards me now. Before I could react, she screamed “The bracelet! Take it off!” Then she let out a huge groan and started smacking herself with her own hands. Could this bracelet be some kind of magic that was taking control of her? It seemed ridiculous to me but I was desperate to get her out of whatever state she was in. As I was frantically trying to get ahold of her arm that had the bracelet on, she hit herself hard enough that she fell unconscious. I took the bracelet off as quickly in fear that she could come awake at any moment. However, she remained unconscious despite me yelling her name and even splashing a bottle of cold water on her face. As I was about to get my phone to call an ambulance, she regained consciousness. 

She took one look at the bracelet which lay on the floor and began crying. I tried to comfort her but she physically recoiled from my touch. “I need some time alone” she said. That night, I slept on the couch or at least attempted to. I was still on an adrenaline high and couldn’t get myself to relax. I couldn’t begin to imagine what Maggie had gone through, becoming an imposter in her own body. 

The next morning, Maggie came out of the bedroom looking like she hadn’t slept for a single minute. “We need to destroy the bracelet” she said. Without saying a word, I followed her down to the basement where the bracelet lay. First I tried breaking it with my hands, then using my feet. We needed something stronger. In the garage, we found a hammer. We went outside and Maggie set the bracelet down on the driveway. I took one hard swing and the bracelet shattered into many tiny fragments. Maggie let out a deep sigh of relief, like a huge burden had just been lifted off her shoulders. 

“It was a gift from my grandmother. Apparently it was passed down among several generations in my family. I wore it all the time because it looked cool. Last night, before we went to bed I took the bracelet off because I thought it would be weird to have sex with the bracelet on.”

“I probably wouldn’t have noticed” I interjected, hoping to add some humor to the situation. 

She ignored my comment and continued on. 

“I woke up late at night because my fingers were twitching. So I went to get my bracelet which I left by the bathroom sink. As soon as I put the bracelet on, I slowly felt something changing inside of me. I began to lose control of my own body. I tried to take it off but ended up scratching my arm hard enough that it bled. I had to get myself away from you because i feared what I might do. I managed to go down to the basement. where I was fighting against my own self to get that cursed bracelet off.” 

She looked at me with sad eyes. “I think it’s best if we don’t continue to see each other. And nobody else should know what happened.” I was devastated, but at the same time I understood why it had to be. I did see her in school since then, but we only acknowledged each other with a simple nod. 

For many years after, I had constant nightmares about that night. I didn’t get into another relationship until many years later when I met my lovely wife. Just when I thought I was finally free of the nightmares, something happened that made it all come back. I was out drinking with my buddies when the topic of losing virginities came about. While they shared their own experiences, I remained quiet. Noticing this, my friend inquired about my own personal experience. I lied and said it was on wedding night but he seemed to believe it. 

Anyways, since then the memories have come back and I can’t stop thinking about it. I figured I could write it all down to get it off my chest.
