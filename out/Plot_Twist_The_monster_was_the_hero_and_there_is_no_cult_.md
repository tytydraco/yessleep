I Took Over Ella’s Reddit—Here’s the Truth She Won’t Tell You (Read Before It’s Gone!)

Hey, everyone.

Surprise! It's me. Let's call me D, but I see she uses what she thinks is my name in her posts—you already know who I am, though, if you've been paying attention. I'm that dude from Ella's posts. The "antagonist" I guess, the villain in her poorly written stories. It's kinda funny how much people enjoy telling one side of a story, painting themselves out to be the hero, and leaving out all the parts that make them out to be the bad guy! It always goes that way. 

Don't worry, Ella, if you're reading this-and I know you are-I'm not here to \*expose\* you or *air your dirty laundry,* as a friend once said to you during a old twitter fight. I'd never. But your readers? Oh, they deserve the truth. Or at least my version of it. The full story. 

Let me be clear, first of all, about how we got here. It did not involve hacking; I did not crack some insane code to post this. Her phone was still logged into Reddit, textbook case of ADHD, so that's how I found this "sanctuary" in which she plays the victim. And now, here I am, borrowing her limelight for a minute or so. She says the black phone isn't hers but it actually wasn't mine, must be someone else's. 

Some of you might have pieced together that I technically "stabbed her" with a knife from one of her melodramatic pleas for attention. Dramatic sounding, wasn't it? But for context, she didn't mention all the details. You see, Ella and I have always been connected-like two weeds growing in the same cracked pavement, thriving against the odds. Ironic, isn't it? Weed. She talks about it obsessively on most of her accounts, I am not too sure why. But let's pull on the thread, about how similar Ella and I are. 

It was not premeditated-more like an accident. I did not even mean to hurt her. It was just an attempt to cut off some of her restraints when she kicked at me. And isn't that the human condition? To hurt the things we love most? And I do love her, in my way.

In Ella's head, her version of me is all shadow and sharp edges, but I am not some mustache-twirling cartoon villain. I am a person, a human being, trying to hang onto something real in a world full of fakes and flakes. I honestly thought we were on the same page, two broken people piecing each other together. But then she tried to leave. Well. Half leave. Half bait me into chasing her with breadcrumbs on and off line. You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes. Hopefully she knows that now. 

And here we are: Ella in her corner, me in mine, and you-you, dear reader-caught square in the middle. You believe her, or do you see the bigger picture, the reality? She's painted me out to be a monster, am I? Do I honestly sound like one? Do let me know. 

She's been talking to you for weeks now, using her weak linguistic hypnotism attempts, reeling you into her make believe drama. Remember, though, there're always two sides to a story. This is mine. Believe it or not, I care about her. Enough to follow her here, enough to defend myself at every turn. 

And if you're wondering what happens next? Well, stick around. The best stories always end with a plot twist.

Yours truly,  

**Diezel ;)**
