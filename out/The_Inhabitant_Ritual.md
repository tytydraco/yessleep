“Okay, do we have everything?”

I looked over all of the items we had laid out on the floor.

*Needles*. Check.

*Pants and shirt*. Check.

*Flashlights*. Check.

“Yes sir, we do.”

“Good, now we wait.”

Wade had told me about this ‘ritual’ of sorts a few months back. He, or at least the people on the forum he discovered it from, call it the ‘Inhabitant Ritual.’ 

He wasn’t exactly able to explain it in the best way himself, so he sent me a link to the forum where he read it from. The rules for the ritual are as follows.

1.      You need a minimum of two people for this ritual, if it’s just one person, then it won’t work. Why? That will be explained later.

2.      You need four total items: a needle for every person participating, a shirt and pants, and a flashlight for every person participating.

3.      You need a mannequin; this will be your vessel. The ritual is to summon the spirit Incola (Inhabitant in Latin).

4.      The ritual needs to be performed at night, specifically around the hours of 10:30 PM to 12 AM. If it is done any earlier or any later, then it will not work.

5.      Gather all participants and put the mannequin in a spacious area. It will need the room to adjust to its new body. Next, place the shirt and pants on the mannequin. This is done simply to make it easier to distinguish.

6.      Prick all five fingertips on one hand, rub your hands together so that your entire palm is covered in blood, and leave a handprint on the mannequin’s face. The mannequin is the vessel for the spirit, and the blood creates a bridge between our world and the spirit world.

7.      You need only to say this once. When you’re finished applying the handprint, say this single sentence; “Incola, come forth into our world and take control of the vessel we have prepared for you. Sedecim Nonaginta-Septem.” The words at the end translate to “Sixteen Ninety-Seven,” the year the first reported sighting of Incola occurred.

8.      Once you’ve finished step seven, leave the room and go to the opposite end of the house you’re doing the ritual in. Wait 10 minutes. The very second the clock marks 10 minutes from the time you got into the room, turn your flashlights on.

9.      Incola has now taken hold of the vessel you prepared. Incola is a vengeful spirit and will actively seek to harm you. You need only to survive 90 minutes in the house with it. If you are caught by Incola, the mannequin will be cast aside, and your body will instead be taken and used as a vessel. You need two people because if one dies, the other can stop the ritual by saying “Incola, Dormi Nunc.” (Inhabitant, Sleep Now). When the vessel is asleep, you can wash the blood off and the bridge will be severed, sending Incola back to the spirit world.

10.  Good luck.

The rules seemed very straightforward. I figured it was simple enough that even a couple idiots like me and Wade could manage to get a good scare out of it without fucking it up.

I wish we had fucked it up.

At the time we decided to do the ritual, I, a recent high school graduate, was working at our local thrift store. I wouldn’t exactly call it a dead-end job, but it certainly wouldn’t hold if I lived on my own.

Anyways, since we have clothes, we need things to put them on. As a result of this, the building has a small room in the back dedicated solely to the storing of mannequins. I figured my boss wouldn’t notice if I snuck one out.

Getting it home wasn’t too difficult, as I was able to lay it out across the back seat of my car. What was difficult, though, was finding the time to actually do the ritual.

Both of my parents worked at different times. This meant that most days, one of them was home at any given moment. I was thinking of a way to get them out of the house when my mom announced some news.

Apparently, her and my dad had been invited to go to dinner on Saturday night by some family friends. I obviously declined the invitation, claiming that I “didn’t want to ruin dinner with my presence.” They bought it, and that was that.

So began the plans for the ritual. I had a shift Saturday evening, but it was only 5-9:30, so it would give me time to prepare when I got home. Wade was working from 10-6, so he was fine as well. I told him that he could let himself in and get everything in place for when I got home.

“So, what will I do in the meantime, then?”

“Hmm. I’ve got the PlayStation in my room; you could entertain yourself with that.”

“Sweet. Thanks man.”

My shift was boring. Usually, we didn’t have customers during the evening, and I questioned why I was even here at all if nobody else was going to show up. I pushed those thoughts to the back of my head and brought ones of my paycheck and the ritual forward.

I was going to get some good scares tonight, and I was going to get paid tomorrow. Alls well that ends well. By the time the clock struck 9:30 PM, I was more than eager to punch out and head home.

I decided to call Wade as I was driving.

“Hey man. Out of work now, headed your way.”

“Okay, should I be ready when you get back?”

“Nah, not for a bit, at least. We’ll have a solid 30 minutes to do whatever we want before we start the ritual.”

“Okay, see you soon.”

My house is a 15-minute drive from work, so it was about 9:45 by the time I got home. Wade was waiting for me on the couch in the living room, watching some movie on the big screen T.V. When he saw me walk through the front door, he got up and asked me a question.

“You got anything good to eat? Supermarket doesn’t exactly give me free dinners, and my wallet is running on empty right now.”

“Dude, I just got home.”

After getting settled back in, I popped a frozen pizza into the oven, and we ate that.

By the time we had finished eating, it was 10:17; time to get started.

We moved the couch to the corner of the living room so there would be an open space for the mannequin. Speaking of which, I brought it down from my room.

It was already clothed, so we didn’t need to worry about that. Wade had the needles and flashlights. He handed me one of both.

“Hope you like needles.” He winced as he began to prick his fingers.

“I’m going to have to try.” I said, doing the same.

Instead of rubbing our palms. We just scrunched up our hands and that worked too.

I placed my palm on the mannequin's head. Then, Wade did the same.

“You ready to say it?” I asked, wiping my hand off.

“Yeah.”

We both looked at the mannequin, and at the same time, said the words.

 “Incola, come forth into our world and take control of the vessel we have prepared for you. Sedecim Nonaginta-Septem.”

By now, it was 10:20, so we got up and went to the opposite end of my house.

 

“You think it worked?” Wade asked, playing a game on his phone.

“Guess we’ll find out in a few minutes.” It was now 10:27

10:30.

The clock struck 10:30. Was there ever an indication that the ritual worked? Wade and I determined that the only way to find out was to go back to the point of origin.

As we trekked through the house, it seemed a lot noisier than usual. Like someone was upstairs. I brushed it off. We were focused on one thing. And then, we saw what was in the living room.

Okay, well, it was more like we *didn’t* see what was in the living room.

 

The mannequin wasn’t there.

The game had *finally* begun.
