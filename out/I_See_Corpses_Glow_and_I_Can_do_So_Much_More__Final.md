What happened to me these past few days was like a dream. Now, I'm less human than before, but I'm alive, I'm home, and I have hope that we can save the world.

That last day, I tried a soothing technique a commenter taught me, and it helped tame the bad dreams. I slept well until Desmod woke me up.

“How are you feeling?” he asked, sitting on the side of my bed. "Your eyes are puffy and red. Have you been crying? Is it the pain?"

"No," I said, sorrow weighing my heart. "But I was talking to my parents all night."

"Is everything alright?"

"Yes. My grandfather's surgery went well, my parents are going home tomorrow." I looked away. "My school called them to ask why I didn't attend this week, so I lied and said I was sick but I didn't tell them so I wouldn't worry them."

"Oh."

"I miss them. I want to be there when they come back."

"Of course! We just have to get you checked up one last time before we send you home."

"Really?" I looked back at him. "Promise?"

He smiled. "Promises only bind humans, but if I were a human, I'd promise."

I tried to get up and winced. “Ow, it didn't hurt this bad last night.”

“Careful.” He helped me sit up. “We have a way of dealing with injuries, but we weren’t sure it'd work on a human. Did it dull the pain completely yesterday?”

I nodded.

“Great! Mallory can give you more.”

“How bad was I hurt?”

“Nothing important was punctured, but you lost a lot of blood.” He frowned. “I’m sorry for provoking her, I didn’t think she’d go that far. I’m just glad her mask was faulty.”
 
I didn’t correct him. “Why didn’t she escape to Kabic?”

“The chains don’t allow it. Or else all our prisoners can escape.”

“How'd you find me?”

“We’ve been looking for you the moment you were taken, then Mika got a call from someone who told us your exact location.”

“Who?”

“He wouldn’t tell me.” He stood up and held out his hands. “Let me help you to the infirmary.”

It was now that I noticed a wheelchair parked by the desk. Accepting his help, I leaned on him as he walked me over and sat me down. The infirmary was at the opposite end of the hall from the garage, and I winced at the bright lights and white sheets.

“Serena's here!” Desmod said.

From behind a curtain, Mallory peeked out, smiling. “Bring her over, hun.”

Desmod rolled me to one of the beds, and they both helped me lie down. Desmod considerately waited behind the curtains while Mallory redressed my wounds, and the pain became negligible once again.

“You're healing well,” Mallory said, pulling my pyjama shirt down. “In a few days, not even scars will be visible.”

“Really?” I asked in surprise as I sat up.

“I told you, we’ve got awesome stuff!” Desmod said from behind the curtain.

“Serena, how wonderful to see you up."

I froze at the sound of Cassiopeia's slick voice.

The curtain to my right whipped open, and she smiled at me. “How are you, dear?”

“I … I’m okay. I want to go home.”

“Of course. You’ve gone above and beyond to help me find my brother, and I don’t think there is an adequate way to thank you.”

I gasped as she grabbed my hands. “No, don’t touch me!” I cried out, trying to wiggle myself free.

“Hey, leave her alone!” Desmod said, whipping aside the other curtain.

“I just have a few questions to ask. You don’t mind, do you, Serena?”

I pursed my lips and squeezed my eyes shut, struggling to take a commenter's advice and focus on my parents' faces while also attempting to block out Cassiopeia's voice.

"Serena, dear, you're weak and tired." She rubbed her thumbs over my knuckles. "Just relax, let me help you. That's it, you're feeling better now, aren't you?"

I let out a relieved breath and nodded, opening my eyes.

“Excellent. Tell me, dear, how did Mika know where to find you?”

“He got a phone call.”

“Who called him?”

“I don’t know.”

“Why are you asking her?” Desmod said, prying her hands off mine. “Ask Mika! She’s done helping us! Just send her home!”

Cassiopeia’s face contorted into a startling snarl, and I gasped as she flung Desmod across the room. He hit the wall and crashed to the ground, and I covered my mouth as dark blood dripped from his head.

Cassiopeia grabbed my wrists, and I cried out as I tried to kick her. “No, let go!"

“Serena, relax, dear."

"No! Stop! Stop …"

Tears welled in my eyes as my parents' faces blurred, Cassiopeia's voice slithering through the cracks in my barrier.

"I'm not going to hurt you." She let go of one wrist and cradled my jaw, tilting my head up until her eyes held mine hostage. "I'm your friend, dear. You know that, don’t you?”

My distress ebbed and I nodded.

“What’s going on here?” Mika asked, stepping in.

“You should teach your son to respect his elders," Cassiopeia replied, shooting a look of disgust at Desmod groaning on the floor before she turned to me. “Serena, did the sirens take you to that island to—"

“Cassiopeia, that’s enough,” Mika said, walking to my bed.

She frowned at him. “You too?”

Desmod limped over, his head wound trickling blood. “Just let her go.”

“What is it with you two? Is it because she’s a half-breed?”

Desmod frowned. “A what?”

Cassiopeia smirked. “I guess daddy didn’t tell you. Her bloodwork came through. Just as I expected, she’s part fairy.”

“Fairy?" Desmond frowned. "Aren’t they extinct?”

“One survived, and Perseus and I worked with him in secret before we asked him to slip over to Kabic and inject his DNA in human semen. Too bad none of the half-breeds lived past eighteen, or we'd have a great army.”

Desmond's expression rotated between awe and suspicion as he studied me. "But she doesn't have anything in common with them."

Cassiopeia laughed. "Fairies were secretive folk, but the one Perseus and I worked with revealed a lot about his kin. Serena has their ability to see death glows, and she should also be able to access her compartments and camouflage herself."

Desmod gawked at me, and Cassiopeia smiled at my unsurprised expression. "You already know all of this, don't you, dear?"

I nodded, and her smile got wider. "And who told y—"

Mika pried her hands away and shoved her back. “Enough.”

Her snarl returned as she grabbed his shirt, whipped him around, and slammed him against the wall. 

She growled in her language, but Mika remained stoic as he replied in English, “Since you began working for your own good instead of the good of the clan.”

With a final growl, she swung him across the room, and I shuddered as he twisted in the most inhuman way and landed on his feet. He cast a quick glance at Desmod before he charged at Cassiopeia, and I gasped when Desmod pulled me off the bed.

With both of us crouching on the floor, he whispered, “We’re getting out of here. Can you run?”

I nodded, my heart ricocheting inside my chest.

A bed flew across the room, and that was our cue. Grabbing my hand, Desmod ran, and I ran right after him, passing Mallory standing there in shock. We made our way to the garage, and we stopped with a gasp when Mika's goons blocked the door.

Desmod turned and dashed the other way, dragging me through a maze of halls as the thugs gave chase.

“I thought they worked for Mika!” I said, barely able to speak as I panted.

“Cassiopeia trumps him. Quick, we have to get you far enough so they can’t smell you."

“Des … Desmod,” I gasped, my sides stinging. “I can’t run as fast as you.”

“I’ll carry you.”

He lifted me up, and I screamed as he zipped down the halls.

“St-toppp!” I cried out, my organs feeling like soup as whiplash stung my neck.

He put me down. “Sorry! I never did this before! Quick, this way!"

The wall beside us slid open, revealing an elevator, and we ran in. Desmod tapped his bracelet against the bare wall, and I hopped from one leg to another, hoping the door would close soon.

I froze as the goons appeared at the far end of the hall, and Desmod frantically tapped the wall as he cursed. The door began to close, but the men were abnormally fast, and I hid my face in Desmod's protective hug, my manic pulse solo but my rapid breaths matching his.

A chorus of angry yells faded, and I peeked above Desmod's arms, trembling. We made it. I didn't sigh in relief, though, as I saw the tension in Desmod's face.

The door slid open, revealing a chilly, gray room full of metal barrels taller than me. Desmod ushered me out, and I watched in awe as he effortlessly slid a barrel to block the elevator door from closing.

"What is this place?" I asked, rubbing my arms.

"Our storage room. It has an exit."

"Are there others?"

"The only other exit is the garage all the way at the other end of the fortress."

I gulped. "What if they got a car?"

"Then we better run faster than them."

He jogged to a sandy area in the middle of the room and tapped his bracelet against the ceiling. A trap door slid open, and I blinked at the sand raining down on us. He jumped up and reached down to help me, and I squinted as I climbed into the sunlight, the door sliding shut behind us. We began running again, and I lost my footing as the ground beneath me shifted.

"What is this?" I asked, staring at the cold, gray sand.

"The desert I told you about. Come on, we have to keep running!"

I stumbled as I tried to keep up with his pace, my lungs feeling like they were going to explode. There was nothing around us but dunes as far as the eye could see.

"Wait!" I panted. "I can't run as … as fast as you, but I can hide. Can this sand mask my smell?"

"It should. Our trophy site is over there, we can't smell the buried."

"Are there cameras?"

"Only indoors."

"Stop, I have a plan."

With an anxious glance around, he stopped running, and I stripped down to my underwear. He looked at me with flustered bewilderment as I shoved my pyjamas in his arms.

“I’m going to hide here,” I said, shivering as I sat in the cold sand and began covering myself.

“No!”

“I can camouflage. Run with my clothes so they follow you and then throw them off a cliff or something.”

After casting a final look of apprehension around us, he turned to me. “I'll come back for you. Or I'll send someone. If they say 'protein bar', trust them. Good luck."

"You too."

He dashed away, and I lay down and covered myself as much as possible before I followed Wi'dei's advice and tried to become one with the sand. Barely a second later, Callan, Hawk, and three others showed up, and I froze, hoping that I was successful, that they wouldn't step on me, and that Cassiopeia hadn't told them I might camouflage.

Afraid I made the worst mistake of my life, I tried to steady my breaths as I focused on remaining unseen. One of the men took a deep whiff, pointed, and yelled, and I let out a tremulous sigh as they all dashed in the direction Desmod ran. I didn’t dare move, though, afraid that more goons might show up. 

The longer I stayed there, the colder I got, the grains of sand like little icicles. What were they made of? I didn’t know how much time passed as I lay there, shivering, hoping Desmod made it out okay. And Mika.

My pulse stumbled as I struggled to focus on my camouflage, but my situation was no match for my exhaustion. My stomach rumbled as my head throbbed, my wounds searing, my neck aching, my feet hurting, my extremities numb.

“Serena?”

My eyelids fluttered open at the sound of a woman’s voice.

“Desmod told me I could find you here and to say 'protein bar'.”

I could see her walking around. A beautiful woman with green eyes, wavy dark hair, yet no canines at all. Groaning, I reached out a numb, quivering hand.

“There you are!" the woman said, kneeling.

I stumbled as she helped me out of the sand, and before I knew it, I was inside a car similar to Mika's. After she treated my pain and helped me into some clothes, she left me in the back seat with a blanket, a tumbler of hot tea, and a box of pizza.

“Where’s D-D-Desmod?” I asked, my teeth chattering. "And M-M-Mika? What happened to C-C-Cassiopeia?”

“We're picking Mika and Desmod up now,” she said, taking off. “Cassiopeia is still alive, and angry. Mika broke her legs, but her bodyguards drove him to run before he could finish her.”

"He b-b-broke her legs?” I asked, stunned.

“Yes, and she tried to stake him through the heart.”

“Oh no!”

“Don’t worry, she only got his shoulder. He'll survive.”

I glanced through the rear windshield, worried. "Are you sure no one is f-f-following?"

"I'm sure. Cassiopeia doesn't suspect me of anything. I also disabled all the vehicles in the garage." She winked at me through the rearview mirror. "Thankfully, I was able to 'fix' mine before anyone else.

"Where are we g-g-going?"

“Drink your tea, it'll warm you up. And relax, I’ll explain everything.”

I took a sip, the warmth sliding down my throat and coursing through my veins. 

“The plan you set with Desmod was perfect. He threw your clothes into a sinkhole. They will eventually realize you’re not down there, but until then, we have the freedom to meet up with the Ruc Pod.”

“The Ruc Pod? The one Hlee is in?”

"Yes. They contacted me yesterday after you went missing to let me know Wi'dei was alive and you were with him. I called Mika to let him know where to find you.” She smiled. “Wi'dei himself contacted me today. He's safe with the pod, and he's interested in meeting with us. I convinced him to let Mika and Desmod join, especially after I told him of Mika’s increasing disagreements with his mother.”

I stared at her, dumbstruck for a few seconds before I found my voice. “Who are you?”

“I’m Ajyal, Perseus’s only child. He recruited me a few months before he died. I think he felt he needed a partner he could trust, especially after Wi'dei was sent to Kabic. But he recruited me against Cassiopeia's wishes, so she kept us apart.

"I'm a rocket scientist, so she let me work in the weapons department, but after Perseus died, I found his notes and I’ve been secretly working on his and Wi'dei's plans to end the war. I’ve resumed communications with the merfolk interested in joining our side, including the Ruc Pod.”

“Oh, wow," I whispered.

"Definitely oh, wow. I can't wait to meet Wi'dei after everything I've read about him in my father's notes!"

My stomach growled, and she chuckled. "I heard that. You probably haven't eaten anything today. Eat."

I opened the pizza box, and I sighed and began picking off the toppings.

“You don’t like pepperoni?” Ajyal asked, peeking back at me.

“No, I like plain cheese.”

She chuckled. “I liked plain cheese too.”

“Um, can I ask what happened to your teeth?”

"You can thank Cassiopeia for that. Since Perseus recruited me against her wishes, she pulled out my fangs to prohibit me from continuing his lineage.”

I grimaced. “That’s terrible.”

“That’s Cassiopeia."

By the time I inhaled the pizza and finished the tea, the car stopped in a dark, rocky area. The door opened, and my heart leapt when Desmod jumped in.

“Serena!” he said, his face lighting up as he hugged me. “I’m so happy you’re okay!”

“I’m happy you’re okay too!" I said, hugging him back. "I was worried!”

“They were very close to catching me, but then I threw your clothes and they just followed their noses,” he said, chuckling as he let me go.

"How's your head?" I asked, looking at the cut above his eyebrow.

He waved it off. "It's nothing. You should see Mika."

Mika limped in, disheveled and irritated, and I gawked at him. He wasn't wearing a suit jacket for once, and I could see the tear in his wrinkled dress shirt, right over a small hole going straight through his left shoulder.

"Oh no! Are you okay?" I asked in alarm.

"Yes," he said, sitting down across from us with a wince as the car took off.

"The medical kit is in the center console," Ajyal said.

Mika took off his shirt and began rummaging inside the kit.

"You aren't bleeding." I turned to Desmod. "But you bled."

"We don't need blood in our veins," Desmod said. "That's why our hearts don't beat. Most vampires drain themselves, but I haven't done that yet, so I still have old blood in me."

"Oh." I frowned. "Then why do you breathe if there's no blood to take the oxygen?"

"So we can talk and stuff. And it's kind of automatic, leftover from our human days, but we can hold our breaths forever if we want to."

"Oh." I frowned again. "Wait, if your heart doesn't work, why does getting staked in it kill you?"

"Because it has ... um, I don't know what I can translate it to in English. Our essence, I guess?"

Mika inhaled through his teeth, and I turned to him, worried as I watched him rub what looked like honey in his wound.

"Is that honey?" I asked, bewildered.

"Yes," Mika said.

"What does it do?"

"It's an antibiotic."

"Honey in Zevea is an antibiotic?" 

"Even honey in Kabic!" Desmod said. "Humans used to use it to treat burns and cuts. They still do. Here, our honey is stronger, all us folk use it, even if we don't eat it."

"I never knew that." I looked back at Mika. "Will it help the wound heal better?"

"Yes," he said, putting the honey away and slathering the pain reliever on.

"So, will the stab wound be barely visible like my scars?"

"No, this type of injury is permanent, but it can be minimized with proper treatment."

Desmod nodded. "Like how Ajyal is missing teeth or how Perseus lost a leg. If parts are removed, they won't grow back, but we can help what's left heal better." He sighed. "Sometimes I wish we had healing abilities like the werewolves, but then we'd be scared of silver, and that's embarrassing."

"Why silver?" I asked, confused.

"It messes up their healing."

Mika began attempting to wrap up his wound, and I scooted closer. "Can I help?"

"No."

"I'll wear gloves," I said, pulling out latex ones from the kit.

He eyed me as I put them on before he said, "Don't touch the wound or I'll need to disinfect it again."

I nodded and sat beside him, both of us working together to wrap his shoulder. “I was so scared Cassiopeia was going to get me to spill everything about Wi'dei. He didn't want anyone to know. Thank you for helping me. Both of you. I really appreciate it. I know it wasn’t only for me and there were a lot of other reasons and stuff, but thank you.”

Mika didn't say anything, but Desmod said, “Even if it was only for you, we’d have done it.”

"I’m just glad you two are okay. You both also ran really far. You must be exhausted."

"I definitely am," Desmod said. "Ajyal, got anything for us to drink?"

"There's soib blood in the left console," Ajyal said.

Desmod looked at me. "Would it make you uncomfortable if we had some?"

"No, go ahead," I said.

Desmod grabbed one of the metal bottles, popped it open, and guzzled it down with fervor. Afterwards, he grabbed two more and finished them off, licking his lips. Once Mika and I were done, he selected his own bottle and took a slow sip.

"Ajyal, did you bring disinfectant wipes and a change of clothes?" Mika asked, grimacing at his dusty, rumpled pants.

"I did," she replied. "And Serena, there's juice in the console."

"I'm actually feeling kind of tired," I said, yawning as I sat beside Desmod again.

"Here, take a nap," he said, moving across to sit beside Mika.

I stretched out on the seat, and before I knew it I passed out in a deep, dreamless slumber. It was only the soft touch on my face that drew me awake.

“Serena? We’re here,” Desmod said.

I sat up, rubbing my eyes. “Where?” I asked, frowning as I saw rocky protrusions through the window.

“An air pocket in an underwater cave. Let’s check it out!”

I stepped out, my heart racing as I looked around the humid, claustrophobic cave. Glowing gems dotted the edges of the walls, their light creating eerie shadows and reflecting off a pool of water in the center of the area.

Mika, now in a fresh suit, stood at the edge of the pool, and Desmod and I joined him while Ajyal called out in mertongue. Bubbles popped across the surface, and we stepped back when two merpeople emerged, one of them carrying Wi'dei. 

Desmod’s eyes nearly flew out of his skull as his thrilled gaze darted between the merfolk and the only surviving fairy. Mika showed no emotion, but Ajyal grinned like a child as she spoke in mertongue.

“Can we speak English?” Desmod said, still awed. “I want to understand every detail and I’m certain Serena does too!”

I nodded before I waved at Wi'dei. “Hello.”

He smiled. “I am glad to see you have survived and have formed a trustworthy alliance with a select few.”

I smiled back. “Thanks, I’m glad you survived too. And thank you for saving my life." I gestured to the side. "You've already talked to Ajyal, and this is Mika, Cassiopeia's son, and Desmod, Mika's son."

"It's so awesome to meet you!" Desmod said, looking like a kid in a toy store. "I've read a lot about fairies, it's like a miracle you're actually here in front of me! And merfolk are just incredible. I'm even learning mertongue! Hsssegh!"

The two merfolk let out throat pops in laugher, and Desmod gave them an awkward smile.

"Pleasure. I am Wi'dei. These are Hih and Pue. They are my bodyguards."

"Why do you need bodyguards?" Desmod asked.

"Because it will not be long before Cassiopeia knows I am alive and begins to search for me."

"Why would she come after you?"

"Because I have what she needs."

"Can we please start at the beginning for those of us who have no idea what's going on?" Mika said, rubbing his injured shoulder.

“I just want to make sure I can trust you."

"We risked our lives to come here," Mika said, irritated. "If that isn't enough, then—"

"They're trustworthy," I said, stepping forward. "Mika almost died fighting Cassiopeia and Desmod helped me escape so she doesn't make me talk about you. And you already know Ajyal is trying to finish what you and Perseus started."

"I already vouched for them," Ajyal said. "If you trust me, you can trust them."

"I just want them to proclaim their alliance," Wi'dei said.

"What is even going on?" Desmod asked, confused as he looked between us. "Alliance for what?"

"We won't proclaim anything until we understand what we are getting into," Mika said.

"Fair enough," Wi'dei said. "After the werewolves wiped out my kind, Perseus found me and nursed me back to health. He was an honorable and dedicated man, and together, we aimed to end the war. Cassiopeia got wind of our plans and joined our cause, but soon Perseus and I understood her true motives. Total domination of the merged spheres.”

“What?” Desmod and I said in unison. 

“She wanted to merge the spheres?” Mika asked, skeptical.

“Yes," Wi'dei said. "You see, with my fairywork knowledge, we created a hsysh."

"You made a second one?" Desmod asked, excited. "Does it also let you control the barrier between spheres?"

"Yes. Perseus and I were hoping it would put an end to haphazard recruitment and prevent the war from bleeding over to Kabic. But Cassiopeia had no intention of stopping the war. She saw the alternate potential of the hsysh, and she created a key that turned it into a device that can merge the two spheres.”

“What! Why would she want to do that?” Desmod asked in shock.

“Because she would gain total control. After studying the geography of both spheres, she planned on having the allied clans move to suitable locations before she merged the two spheres, destroying the habitats and populations of the enemies, including humans.”

“You stopped her, right?” I asked, worried.

“Yes. Thanks to my camouflage, I discovered her scheme, and I created my own key. Without my key, the hsysh will not work at all. I only told Perseus. Cassiopeia remained oblivious and continued to work with us, visiting pods and preaching peace, all the while waiting for her moment.

“During my time with them, I had gradually revealed the secret abilities of fairies, and Cassiopeia suggested I go to Kabic and try to create half-breeds. Perseus agreed, which was the only reason I acquiesced. I have no doubt that he agreed in hopes of keeping me far from harm. I also have no doubt that she let slip my location to the werewolves so that they could kill me. To my luck, they ended up keeping me prisoner instead after interrogations.

"I also have no doubt that she let slip Perseus’s activities to the enemy, resulting in his death. She wanted us out of the way for her big moment, and I can almost imagine her panic when she could not find the hsysh. Perseus always kept it on his person, unbeknownst to her. I am certain that after searching the entire fortress, her last hope was exhuming his body. Which is where you came in, Serena.”

I could only listen in awestruck stupor.

“So, she now has the hsysh?” Mika asked.

“Yes, but she does not have my key, and she cannot create a duplicate without fairywork," Wi'dei said. "But if she is as stubborn as I remember, she will figure out that I am still alive. She will try to find me, and she will not stop until she does.”

“Oh, great," Desmod muttered. "So, the war just got worse."

“Not quite. If we manage to retrieve the hsysh, I have the key.”

We all stared as he pried open his stomach, revealing a small compartment that looked as though it was carved in wood. Inside, a tiny object gleamed. He picked it up and showed it to us, the lights glinting off its edges.

“Is that the key?” I asked, amazed as I stepped closer to inspect it 

“Yes,” Wi'dei replied.

“You’re amazing!” Desmod said. “If we work together, we can end this war!”

“That would be my hope,” Wi'dei said, tucking the key back inside his torso. “But I need us to agree to work together towards this goal, no matter the hardships.”

“I agree," Ajyal said.

“I agree,” Mika said.

“I agree!” Desmod said.

I looked around awkwardly. “Does this include me?”

“Of course!” Desmod said before his smile faded. “Unless you don’t want it to?”

“I do want the war to end. I also want us to have the hsysh so Kabic is safe. But I don’t know how much I can help. Besides, I’m dead in two years, and I want to spend them with my parents and friends.”

Desmod’s mouth fell open. “Was what Cassiopeia said true?”

I nodded, looking down.

“No! We won’t let it happen!” Desmod looked between Wi'dei, Mika, and Ajyal. “There’s something we can do about this, right?”

Ajyal shrugged in apology, Mika didn’t reply, and Wi'dei said, “Not that I know of.”

Before the mood turned grim, a comment left on my previous post popped into my head and I looked up with nervous hope. "Hey, um … wh-what if I'm turned?"

Desmod turned to me, stunned. "What?"

"That … might actually work," Ajyal said, tapping her chin in thought. “The eternal lifestream of a vampire and the short lifestream of a fairy half-breed could cancel each other out and give you a regular life span.”

Mika remained stone-faced, but Desmod turned to Wi'dei with wide-eyed hope. “Would that work?”

Wi'dei thought for a few seconds, nodding slowly. “I am surprised I did not consider it myself. It might very well work.”

"That's awesome!"

"B-But wait," I said, my excitement and anxiety clashing. “Would I become a vampire?"

"Our DNA only splices into human DNA," Ajyal said. "Since you are part fairy, you most likely won't go through a full vampiric transformation."

"Are you sure?"

"No."

“If you do become a vampire, it's not a bad thing,” Desmod said, holding my hands. “You'll be fast and strong and hard to kill. And you can still live with your family.” He turned to Mika. “She can still live with her family, right?”

“Her physical and dietary changes will be difficult to conceal," Mika replied.

"But not impossible!"

"No, not impossible."

He turned back to me. "See? And it might not even come to that!"

"If I'm not fully turned, would my lifespan still be fixed?"

"We won't know for sure until you successfully pass your eighteenth year," Ajyal said.

"Oh." I looked down. "So … this is all guesswork?”

“Yes," Wi'dei said. "This situation is unprecedented. We will not know how much the transformation will affect you, if at all."

"But it doesn't hurt to try, right?" Desmod turned to me. "What do you say, Serena?"

I didn't want to die at eighteen. I was ready to try anything to gain more years with my family and friends and to help save our spheres … but was I willing to risk becoming a vampire? A risk that might not even elongate my life?

I looked into Desmod's green eyes, and their hope pulled mine out of fear's fog. I wanted to live my life to the fullest, no matter how much time I had, and what could be more exciting than gaining vampiric abilities, no matter how minor.

If getting turned didn't extend my lifespan, I could use my remaining two years and whatever new abilities I gained to help end the war. And if getting turned did extend my lifespan, or turned me into a vampire, then I was ready to do all I could to help save our spheres. I just wanted a guarantee that I could be with my parents and friends.

"Do you promise I can be with my family after I get turned, no matter what?" I asked them.

Mika sighed, Ajyal shrugged, but Desmod said, "I promise, even if I were human!"

I held out my pinky. "Pinky promise."

He didn't hesitate to hook his finger around mine. "I swear I'll do anything to help you stay with your family. I never had one as a human, and I don't want you to go through the same thing."

His words tugged at my heart and I pulled him in for a hug. "Thank you."

"I don't see any harm in her remaining with her family, " Wi'dei said. "It might be safer for her while she's in training."

"I'm just curious to see what her transformation will be like," Ajyal said.

Desmod and I let go, and I took a deep breath, my heart thudding in nervous excitement. "I'm ready."

Desmod smiled. "It'll work, I know it will!" He turned to his dad. "Mika, will you do the honors?"

"He's going to do it?" I asked, looking at Mika's repulsed face.

"He's the only one who can right now." Desmod sidled up to him. "Come on. You're saving her life and helping us gain an ally!"

"We don't have to do it now," Mika said. "She has two years to go. By then you'll be able to turn her yourself."

"I don't want to be her dad!"

"Then we'll hopefully have new vampire allies."

"Dad, we're at war. What if something happens and we can't get to her in time to turn her? We have to do it now, when we have the chance."

I nodded. "You're here now, Mika … and I trust you."

Mika grimaced, then he sighed and walked over to stand in front of me. "Ready?" he asked after a few seconds, almost as if he was asking himself.

I gulped, my anxious heart fluttering in my chest. "W-Will it hurt?"

"Yes," he replied before he pulled my head to the side and sank his teeth into my neck.

It happened so fast that I gasped, instinctively struggling, and he held me tighter, pressing my throat to his lips. A rush of warmth spread from his bite through my veins, and I stopped resisting as I felt completely at ease.

No, euphoric.

Desmod held my hand, and I locked eyes with him, my breaths hitching as my pulse raced. It was happening. This was actually happening.

Mika let go of me, blood dripping down his chin, and my muscles spasmed as I collapsed into Desmod's arms. He laid me down, and I gasped as ice and fire simultaneously replaced my blood, my frenzied heart pumping them through every capillary in my shivering body. The euphoria was gone, and reality came crashing back. 

What was I thinking?

"Hey, can't you help her relax during this part?" Desmod asked Mika in concern as I convulsed on the ground.

"I didn't do it for you, and I'm not doing it for her," Mika replied, pulling a wipe from his pocket and cleaning his hands and face with a grimace.

"You'll be okay," Desmod said, cradling my head as worry and hope clashed behind his eyes. "It's just a few seconds and you'll be okay."

Ajyal knelt beside me and pressed two fingers to my neck. "She still has a pulse, but green is tinting her eyes." She lifted my upper lip. "Her canines haven't changed yet, but her skin is clearing up."

"Wh-what's h-h-happening?" I rasped, my limbs seizing as my heart ran amok.

"Mika's DNA is infiltrating every cell in your body and splicing into your DNA," Ajyal said, still monitoring my pulse.

"Her canines are growing," Mika said before gargling from a tiny, blue bottle.

The rush of sensations began to slow down, and I fell limp, my chest heaving as sweat trickled down my face.

"Serena?" Desmond swept aside a damp strand of my hair. "How are you feeling?"

"Tired," I whispered.

"That's normal. Your body just went through a ton of changes."

A tear traveled down my face. "Am I a v-vampire?"

"No, not completely," Ajyal said, now treating my puncture wounds. "But we don't know the extent of your transformation."

Another tear traced my cheek.

"Here, Serena, eat this," Desmod said, shifting to pull a protein bar out of his pocket.

I couldn't help but cough out a weak chuckle. Of course. Him and his endless supply of protein bars.

He unwrapped it for me and held it close to my mouth, and I took a bite, pausing my chewing as my tongue inspected my supposedly longer canines. I couldn't tell the difference. The protein bar gave me some energy, and I groaned as I sat up, Desmod helping me as he grinned.

"You ate it!" he said.

I nodded and took the bar from him. "Yeah, thanks. I was a bit lightheaded, but this helps. I—” My eyes went wide. "Wait, I ate! And it tasted good!"

Desmod hugged me, and I cried as I hugged him back, all my tension disappearing. "Thank you," I whispered before I looked up teary-eyed at everyone. "Thank you all."

"We won't know if it will elongate your life, but live every moment to the fullest," Ajyal said, patting my back.

"It *will* elongate your life," Desmod said, releasing me from the hug. "And we'll be right here to help you figure out what vampiric abilities you inherited from Mika."

"So, does this mean Mika is my dad too?"

Desmod chuckled. "Yes. You're also probably the first ever tri-breed!"

"This is crazy. And amazing. Will I be able to travel between Zevea and Kabic?"

"Maybe," Mika said. "With the combined vampire and fairy lifestreams, you may not need to wait two years."

"Awesome!" Desmod said.

"Although I will still need to wait two years to see if I'll drop dead or not," I said, my smile wavering.

"You won't. You'll live a long healthy life, and you'll be a great addition to our anti-war team!"

"Serena," Wi'dei said. "Do you agree to do all that you can to help us end this war?"

I straightened up. "I agree."

"Great!" Desmod said. "Now can we get her home before her parents get back tomorrow? We can hash out our plans later."

…

Two days later, my mom called out, "Serena! There's a young man here to see you!"

I ran to the door, and I blinked in surprise at the smiling redhead on the porch. "Desmod!"

"Is this boy the reason you've been looking so radiant since we got back?" my mom asked with a playful smile.

"Mooooommm," I said, my cheeks heating up. 

"I'm just saying, you're looking very good for someone who's been sick for a week!"

"It's … it's my mom's soup," Desmod said. "When I'd bring over Serena's homework, my mom would send over soup. It's like magic."

I quickly nodded. "It helped a lot."

"Mhmm," my mom said, leaning against the door. "I'm sure his company had nothing to do with it."

"Mooommm, go finish planting your tomatoes."

She chuckled and turned to walk away. "Lovely to meet you, Desmond. Have your mom send over the recipe for her magic soup."

"Likewise, and I will!" Once she was out of earshot, Desmod whispered, "Great, now I'm going to have to look up soup recipes."

"What are you doing here?" I asked, worried. "Is something wrong?"

"No, but Mika had business in Kabic so I thought I'd tag along and see how you're coping with your new self."

I relaxed, smiling. "I'm doing well. I'm practicing camouflaging and lifting heavy stuff in my room. I haven't found any 'compartments', but my night vision is awesome!"

"I can help you search for your compartments," he said, wiggling his eyebrows with a roguish grin.

I sputtered out a laugh. "Behave yourself, we're siblings."

"Hey, the only reason people frown upon it is because of inbreeding, but it's not like we can have kids. Well, you can't with me, but I'm pretty sure you can with a human! You know, if you wanted to pass on your weird collection of genetics."

"Hmm, I haven't really thought about kids. Right now I just want to graduate and help end the war. I really want to start training with you guys in Zevea. I don't know how fast I can run or if I can carry a car here, I'm afraid someone will see. When will I learn how to shift between spheres?"

"After you learn the geography of both. I'm still doing that, maybe we can study together."

"Sure! Then you can help me with Zevea and I can help you with Kabic."

"And once we've got it down, we can practice shifting and finally graduate and join the big leagues to end the war!"

"Definitely! I still don't know how much I can do, but I'm ready to help anyway I can."

"Even if you couldn't do anything, you're a tri-breed. Your very existence is proof that folk can coexist." He waved behind me. "Hello, sir!"

"Howdy," my father said, walking over. "You a school friend of Serena's?"

"Yes, I'm Desmod."

"Nice to meet you, Desmond. What brings you over?"

"I just wanted to see how Serena was doing and if she wants help with the homework."

"I don't need help," I said, "but we can just hang around, if you'd like."

Desmod smiled. "I'd like."

"Alright. Have fun you two," my father said, "but no hanky panky. Y'hear?"

"Daaaaad," I said, my face heating up.

Desmod chuckled. "Don't worry, sir, we'll behave."

I shot him an amused look and he grinned.

My mother called my father, and he nodded at us before walking back in the house. "Gotta help your mom plant the tomatoes in the backyard."

"Nice to meet you, sir!" Desmod called out before he looked at me. "It's so cool meeting your parents. Well, your mom and one of your three dads. Did they notice anything different about you?"

"Not yet, other than me being more 'radiant', and I don't want to tell them anything." I scoffed. "Not that I can with Cassiopeia's promise." I paused, biting my lip. "I just don't know how to warn them that I might die in two years."

"You won't. I can feel it. You'll age like a normal human and get all old and wrinkly and you'll have to grab your glasses and walker to search for your dentures."

I snorted out a laugh. "Gee, thanks for cheering me up."

He gave me a teasing grin. "Anytime."

"So, since you're here, do you want to check out the festival downtown? Or I can show you around my neighborhood, if you like."

"Are you not inviting me in because I'm a vampire?" he asked, smirking.

I laughed. "Oh, right! I forgot about that rule. Is it real?"

He chuckled. "No. You can blame that on my great grandfather too. He prided himself on getting humans to invite him in before he drank them dry."

"Or are you just saying that?"

I smiled and backed away, leaving the door open but remaining silent, and he chuckled again as he followed me inside.
