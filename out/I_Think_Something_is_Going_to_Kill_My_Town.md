I'm not sure where I should start with this. A lot of weird things have happened since last night and my head is spinning. I need to get it all together. I've been sequestering myself in the towns little library; it seems like the only place around that has internet still (even though it's dial up) and I know Mrs. Meyers won't be back from her vacation until next week. The windows are all papered over due to a remodel and it looks practically abandoned, so I'm hoping I don't draw any attention here. I don't really trust my apartments safety at the moment. The cell service out here has been non-existent for about 12 hours, and as of now, this might be my only way to reach the outside world before I try to pack up and get the hell out of here. My hope is that by writing all of this out, I'll keep a sane mind in these times of insanity. I never thought I'd see the beginning of hell on earth, but this may just be it. I think my town, and the people in it, are dying.



I just walked around a couple of offices and everything seems quiet, so I've got some time to give you a little context. My town is a pretty small area, technically a village if you ask the county auditors. Untouched by most of today's great advances in technology aside from the internet. Sounds crazy but I think there are a lot of places like this around the United States still. I don't think I'd trade it for another life if someone bothered to ask. It's quiet and natural; untainted some say. I've got plenty to do too; watching movies and reading to my hearts content, and my job at the Post Office is a breeze. I get government money to do almost nothing but deliver letters to the folks in town, usually just from each other, and usually just around the holidays. My degree in Environmental Sciences doesn't help me much, but I can tell you about what the old coal mine did to our little slice of heaven, or what the logging down the road is doing to our ecosystem. There are a few outlying buildings farther out of the way, the old coal mine lodge, the "resort cabins" down by the lake, and a couple old community college buildings no longer in use. 



To kill time and keep myself out of any real trouble, I like to explore all the old places. I've been through the miners quarters and those buildings a hundred times, to the point I have given some unsanctioned tours to teenagers and some of the more outgoing 'tourists' that happen to pass through town. The old resort cabins are shoddy and filled with mold, so I steer clear of them most of the time. My favorite spot is by far the old community college. It shut down due to being underfunded back in 1999. There's a security detail still that comes in once or twice a week to check in on things, but other than that, it's like a sitting time capsule from the 90's. I was born in 91', so it's cool to check out that time period whenever you walk through it. Sometimes I'll take an old boombox and a couple of beers, maybe a pizza, and go stay the night. There's still power running to it, so the tube TV's with the built in VHS players still work! I'll digress though, sorry for the rant. Typing this out feels like the most normal thing I've done in a day. 



Last night after work, I clocked out and decided it would be one of those nights I stay over. Security was there the day before, so I know I'd be left alone. I swung by my apartment to get some things; my phone charger, battery pack, backpack with miscellaneous essentials, then swung by the little corner store for the *other* essentials. Mr. Grausch greeted me as always, made some small talk then gave me a wink, the tell-tale sign that he knew what I was up to. He's been somewhat of a father-figure to me since my parents passed, so I know he'd rather see me doing this than going down the path of other small town folk. We chatted for a few minutes while I stocked up my backpack, said our goodbyes and I headed out the door. I've got a nice electric bike I use to get from point A to point B around here. I could probably afford a car, but I'd also like to just save my money so I can leave if I ever needed to. Thank christ I've got a decent stockpile now. I attached my pack to the bike, and headed off towards my destination. Took me about 10 minutes to get there and just as I thought, there was no off-brand security truck in the parking lot. I unloaded and walked over to the 'locked' gate. There's about a, 8-foot high chain link fence around the entire place, not that it would ever really stop someone, and the lock code is ... very easy. I'm not doing to divulge that secret in case any of you ever happen to find your way here.

  
I got the gate unlocked, trotted up the concrete steps and unlocked the front door with the same exact code. Inside, everything looked just like the last time I was here. Halls of teal and off-purple colors. Streaks of lighting like graphics and white lockers lining the place. The cafeteria still had those collapsable tables and everything. I'd recently been working on trying to get the intercom system functional again, but it was a slow task. I decided it was going to be a night of Simpsons and Batman on VHS. I'd been watching the security detail for a few weeks here, and the last few times they were on site, they didn't even bother to do a real walkthrough. They'd pop there head in the front door and then leave most times. At most, they would walk in and down the first hall, yell to see if anyone answered, then leave. Because of this, I figured they would never discover my oasis in the upstairs teachers lounge. It had its own functioning bathroom, sink, microwave AND a fridge. At the back of the room was the storage closet, where I kept my things, and was separated by another door. The closet itself was huge, to the point that I smuggled in a cot with some real comfy sleeping bags, and it fit the TV on the rolling stand too. Spacious for a late-night hangout session. Everything was lining up to be a great night. I went out to heat up my pizza rolls, when I nearly shit my pants. The door to the teachers lounge had frosted glass in it. It was already nearly dark so I could tell that there was a car with its headlights on outside. I sat there contemplating what to do, when I heard another pull up, and then another, and another, until there had to be 7 or 8 cars outside. 

  
I figured maybe someone had trailed me to see what I was up to. They didn't look like the usual security vehicles, they were much much nicer. I knew my bike was fairly hidden between the dumpsters outside where I left it, so if I needed to, I could high-tail it back to town. After sitting on it for a minute, I decided to peek out and see what was going on. The door was adjacent to a row of windows facing the front courtyard. I slowly cracked open the door, and slide myself out low, so no one would see me in the windows. Crawling on all fours, I made it to the corner, crept up, and peered out the corner glass. I think they were all the same kind of truck, or SUV, all black, just sitting there with the lights on. A few seconds after looking, another vehicles lights crested over the top of the road. It was a very large big rig with an even larger shipping container being carried on it. As soon as it pulled up and parked, two men got out of each of the other vehicles. They were all wearing black jumpsuits with heavy looking respirators. I was standing there, watching them all walk towards the rig. One of them knocked on the drivers door. As soon as it opened, he fired two shots into the cab and the driver slumped out of his seat, down to the ground. My heart felt like it skipped a few beats and I had to stop myself from hyperventilating. I looked back out quickly to see a couple men dragging the body off towards the woods, while all the others started to unhitch the trailer. One of them got into the rig and started to turn it around, then drove off back the way it came. 

  
I was stunned. I don't remember exactly what happened next, but I remember hearing the chain link fence being moved, and the front door being taken down. I mean it sounded like they were taking sledgehammers and drills to it. I grabbed my pack but left everything else. Running down the hallway as quietly as I could, I headed for the back set of stairs that led to an emergency exit. I felt like an idiot, but I took a deep breath, then opened it. No alarm went off that I could hear, but I know they had a few silent ones around a few of the doors. I peered around the corner but the front door was out of view. I could see my bike about 100 feet away, but there was no way they wouldn't see me. I sat there for a couple minutes in doubt of whether or not I'd be alive to see the morning, when I heard my possible savior on its way. A small white truck with yellow lights pulled in to the lot. I saw a balding short man step out of the truck and make his way towards the front door. He looked pissed as he walked up the steps, leaving my view. A few of the men trailed him, walking swiftly up the stairs as well. I took this opportunity to slink my way over to my bike. As I did, I heard another gunshot. Just one. I didn't look back, but I knew what had happened. 

  
I made my way between the dumpsters like an olympic sprinter. I was out of breath and on the verge of losing it. I heard a few of the men shouting about something and swore they found me. I took another deep breath and looked around the corner. A couple of guys were heading towards one of the SUV's. They opened up the back hatch and politely helped an older woman out. She was handcuffed around the front, but didn't seem to have anything wrong with her. They closed the back hatch, but not before a handful of papers flew out, making their way towards the road. It seemed like she tried to go get them, but the men shoved her forward. One of the papers blew my way so I ducked back under the cover of the dumpster. It was maybe a few feet away from me, stuck on a large bushel of tall grass. Not sure why I did it, but as the men took the woman out of sight, I grabbed the paper and shoved it in my pack. I hopped on my bike and started the opposite direction of everything. Took me 20 minutes more than normal, but I rode through the woods slowly, circling back to the road way back from the building. As soon as I hit the pavement, the bike shot into 'sport mode' and I drained the battery getting back to town. 

  
As I arrived, everything looked normal. No commotion, no odd looking cars, nothing. By this time it was around 2AM I think, give or take. I threw my bike in the shed next to my apartment and started up the steps. Again, everything was in its place and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. I must have been pumping adrenaline the entire night because I passed out almost as soon as I sat on the couch. I woke up a few hours later in a cold sweat. I glanced over at my oven's clock. 3PM. Shit, I slept way, way too long. I looked around thinking someone was going to be in the apartment, ready to take me out. The low rumble of the AC unit in the window was the only sound around. I got up and took a quick shower and sat in the tub for a while, thinking about what the hell just happened. I'm not the smartest person but I'm a realist. This shit doesn't just happen in real life. Sure, I've seen just about every sci-fi and horror movie the library had to offer, but that's imagination land, not some fucking small town in BFE on the very real Planet Earth. I got out and got dressed, thought about eating but couldn't stomach it. I was pacing around for what felt like an hour when my eye caught something. My blood ran cold as I saw the big rig parked across the street in an empty lot. Inside was one man, dressed in a casual black jacket and dark sunglasses. I ducked down and hit my chin on the windowsill, busting it open a bit. I cursed some things I won't type out, then peeked up. A second man dressed just the same was walking towards the truck down from where the corner store is. 

  
I didn't hesitate this time. I grabbed my bag and keys, got out and locked the door. I ran down the steps and out the side where they couldn't see me. The library is two blocks from my apartment and I knew no one would be there, so I ran as fast as I could to get there. I knew where Mrs. Meyers kept a spare key (she's old and always forgot hers) so I grabbed it from the fake rock and unlocked the back door, gently shutting and locking it behind me. First thing that came to my mind was of course, call the police. My phone had been in my bag the entire time, I fucking know it. Now, it wasn't. Not sure if I left if back at the 'oasis' of mine or it got lost somewhere along the way. The phones are down in the library too, just giving a busy signal. I'm currently on an ancient computer that's technically online. It'll probably take me hours to get this uploaded. So far, I've just been sitting here, eating some vending machine food and trying to not freak out. I've seen some movement outside the windows but I don't hear the normal business as usual outside. No cars, no one talking or shouting down the street. It's not normal. I read the paper I found but it sounds fake. I'm not sure if this is some kind of large scale prank but again, I'm not stupid. This truly seems like it could be much bigger than I could image. The scanners here are awful, [but I was able to upload the document here.](https://imgur.com/a/IW36SQu) 

  
So we're back to the beginning. I don't know what to do. It's getting late again and I don't want to move. I think I heard the rig moving again but I can't really tell. I'm still tired so I may try and find a closet to sleep in for a while. If I survive the night, I have to get out and check on things. I need to check on the old man and work. If my service comes back, I'll contact every news site and police station I can. If it doesn't, I might have to go back and see what the hell is going on.
