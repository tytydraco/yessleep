Since my 2nd semester at the university, I’ve often felt like an imposter, questioning WHETHER I’m JUST A LUCKY ONE WHO SLIPPED IN.  

To begin with, I graduated a valedictorian and straight-A student, which is something absolutely common to at least half of the students here. 

For months, I’ve been getting up early for classes (the infamous 8:30am) and studying until my mind significantly slows down in processing words, almost fitting in the descriptions of brain fog 😶‍🌫️. I then take breaks to recharge, often replaced or accompanied by meals and workouts, before diving back into my studies and stacks of assignments. Despite this, I still find myself burning the midnight oil at the library, TREASURE HUNTING FOR AN AVAILABLE SEAT, surrounded by few noticeably worry-few, delightful yappers in addition to DOZENS of even more diligent, bright-minded peers. 

Consequently, I sleep in with heart palpitations from the disruptive and deprived sleep schedule. Somehow, it all just seems like a haunting “tortoise and rabbit race” between me and my peers with the exemption of any sleepy, lazy rabbit. Even more, this isn’t just anxiety-talking—I’ve seen it firsthand during my late-night study sessions with friends, where I always end up exhausted first but only to get a lower grade on the exam the day/week after. 

Additionally, I put “more time” as the first item on the new year resolution list, since the basis of the “study smarter, not harder” theory requires adaptation and learning, which cannot come true without sufficient amount of time and experimental trails.

Regardless, I do hope that in the upcoming new year, I can do better after fully utilizing the academic support available and accomplishing more than I did in the past, instead of just clinging to the vain byword of “celebrating failure.” 😣 🤞

Thank you for reading till the end, my fellow night owls! 
Blooper: I compiled this essay as a reflection before bed and right after feeling the alarming heartbeats when searching for professional clubs to join for the following semester with open applications.

Also: I’m so sleepy and couldn’t even recall details to make up an essay up to 500 words without bullshitting. So I’m putting some BS texts on the bottom to achieve the minimum word count requirement. Let me just smuggle in some random trending topics below In the form of key words:

Walmart. Birkin. Wirkin (btw, the name remind me of “working” and is my keyboard auto-corrector would testify the same) Travis Hunter. Heisman. Pop-tarts bowl. National championship game. SEC. Bo Nix. Taylor Swift. Beyoncé. Travis Kelce. 
“coolkid can sleep now” 
”YOUR FINANCIAL BLOCKS WILL BE REMOVED TONIGHT WHILE YOU SLEEP NOW, SAVE IT TO CLAIM IT.“ 
“I’m gonna sleep now” 
“Hope y’all can have a good sleep now” (30 more words to go. Maybe I should write smth more personal but I’m darn tired and I felt like the shadow of my quilt on the wall is moving every time I’m typing and only peeking it with my peripheral vision. Anyway. I think I’ve reached the word count. Ty for anyone reading my random roasting)
