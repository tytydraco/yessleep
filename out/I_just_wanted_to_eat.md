I’ve been having what I can only describe as… bleedthroughs.

It started a few months ago, mostly while falling asleep. Places I knew too well for them to be just dreams, but not from any memory I could name. At first it was harmless. A hallway that shouldn't exist. Familiar voices in a house I’ve never been inside. That sort of thing.

Then came the sushi bar.

It was clean. Too clean. Empty, except for servers who moved just slightly out of sync with gravity. They didn’t blink. Thick slices of fish of all colors lined the bar. They brought me my favorite roll — I didn’t order. I hadn’t even spoken. The miso was warm, perfectly made. It should have comforted me.

I did panic, briefly, thinking about how much this was going to cost. While I spiraled in my price anxiety, something struck me as off.

Beneath the table, the floor wasn’t solid. There were vents. And behind those vents... something was breathing.

I know how that sounds. I know. But you might understand what I'm trying to say if you’ve ever had a dream where you can *feel* someone else’s presence — and that presence isn’t human.

I don’t think it was just a dream. Because something followed me out.

I woke up sweating and twisted in bed. My cat looked up, briefly alarmed, then went back to sleep. I was disturbingly hungry. I have no idea how I slept until 3pm, but I had to get going.

I went to my computer and geared up my workstation. I noticed my keyboard wasn’t lit up like it usually is. Knowing I needed sustenance, I opened up my delivery app and perused the options.

“Sushi sounds good,” I said aloud to myself.

I placed an order for several rolls and sashimi, then returned to my weirdly dead keyboard. I pulled on the cord to see if it was unplugged. The connection had been *chewed*. By mice, I assumed — though I’d never seen a mouse in my apartment.

I dug out my backup wireless keyboard, booted everything up. No tasks appeared on my work queue — which only happens on Friday afternoons. But it wasn’t Friday. I checked our team chat. One new message, from my boss: a single smiley face. No subject. No context.

Weird.

I figured it was a prank and logged into a game instead. Hours passed. I got hungry again and checked the delivery app. It said the driver was outside.

Three sharp knocks.

I opened the door to find the *strangest* delivery person I’d ever seen.

Sky-high green mohawk. Gray trench coat. Leather boots. He looked like one of the kids I went to high school with — except he wasn’t.

He said nothing, just held out the food. When I reached for it, he grabbed my wrist.

“It’s okay,” he said. “I’m here for you.”

I froze.

“They’re outside, but I blocked them for a while. They can’t get in.”

He let go of my wrist and ducked inside. “Here’s your food.”

I gibbered. I stuttered. Then I half-shouted, “You need to get out of my house!”

He peeked through the blinds. “No worries, mate. I’m not here to hurt you. I’ve been sent to protect you from them.”

“Them?” I asked. “THEM??”

“Come look,” he said.

I set the food down and, against my better judgment, followed him to the window. Outside looked normal. Cars. Joggers. Dog walkers.

“I said look,” he repeated, “and I meant *look*.”

I stared again — harder.

That’s when I saw it. In the bushes next to the trash bins: two long arms with claws. They retracted into the hedge slowly, deliberately.

“You saw it?” he asked.

“What the hell is going on?”

“My name is Crater,” he said, “and I’m here to protect you.”

“As you’ve said before,” I muttered. “Protect me from *what*?”

He didn’t answer. Instead, he ripped open the food bag. “Come. Let’s eat. You’ll need it.”

I stayed wary but sat down. The sushi looked… perfect. Fat slabs of fish, glossy rice, just enough wasabi. I grabbed a roll.

And then came the *rattling* at the door.

Someone — something — was jiggling the doorknob.

I ran over and slammed all the locks shut.

Crater didn’t even look up. “It’s only delaying the inevitable,” he said. “They’ll get in sooner or later.”

My heart was pounding. “What *are* they?”

Crater only shook his head.

Some mix of courage and idiocy took over. I *unlocked* the door.

“NO!” he shouted, but I’d already opened it a crack.

What I saw outside wasn’t a person. It wasn’t *right.* Skin like blistered leather. A body shaped like it had been folded wrong.

It lunged.

I slammed the door and ran to my room, barricading it with furniture. “That’s not going to work,” Crater’s voice came from behind me.

I spun. “How did you—?”

“They’re going to get through,” he said. “Might as well get it over with.”

“Get WHAT over with?!”

The door cracked. Furniture buckled. A finger snaked through the splintered wood. Then a hand. Then a face.

Misshapen. Eyes reflective like a cat’s. Stretching the world around it like plastic wrap pulled too tight.

I screamed.

They got in.
