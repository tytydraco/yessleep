I recently just moved on a quiet suburb in Upstate New York after I accepted a job in a nearby city. It was a busy day of moving for me, like me carrying several boxes in my home, some of the furniture, which, as you know, is incredibly heavy, and also a pain since I only have myself to lift it. By the time I finished moving everything in place, I just decided to crash down the couch. My back just ached in exhaustion, my eyes just drooping down to the point, I just want to shut my eyes. Then again, my stomach needed something to eat at the moment after moving so many of my stuff into the house. I sat down and pour myself a glass of coffee and sat down at my newly set table, facing the front porch. I took my supper as I take in on this new neighborhood I'm going to probably live in for the next couple of years in my life.

Across my street, there was this house; a small house, looks like your typical house that you see in a quiet suburb, small, drab coloured, absolutely nothing remarkable about it. The windows are completely shut, with the curtains extended wide open for me to not see anything through the house. The porch just by the front door looked unremarkable, with 2 chairs and a small table standing on top of it's wooden floors. The garage has it's white shutters closed, so I can't see what is inside this garage. Overall, the front facade of this house is unremarkable, honestly, I don't even know why I even mentioned anything about this house, there is nothing that is out of the ordinary, or anything that tells the entire neighborhood the house failed the HOA or anything; it's just a small house that many people will pass by or probably peek really quick and move on. That was not the reason I mentioned this house however, as I will tell my story about this strange house in front of me.

During daytime, it was an unremarkable house, it's your typical house in your small community suburb that many people will overlook, but during the night, it was different. During the dead times of midnight, when I was on my bedroom, again, one of the windows is facing the house just across the street, something weird happens there. During the first night, after I finally finished moving, one man began to walk on the porch; the man was wearing a white sweater and a matching coloured sweatpants. The man was knocking on the door, and eventually twists the door knob and enter the house. I could get a slight glimpse of what is inside, however, all I saw was just black, and nothing else, almost as if the place has no lighting inside. Eventually that man leaves after around 40 minutes, but something was different; the man was walking down the steps, moving in a way that hints that he was drunk or high or something. He walked down the street once more and left the house stumbling; I assume it was some sort of a crack den that no one told me or maybe there's some secret party that I don't know about, but, this house doesn't scream anything that it's a crack house nor it looked rowdy, if anything, it looked pristine, the paint has no wear, no crack on the walls, the lawn was short and trimmed, I don't think this is a crack house.

The second night is when everything get a bit more strange, nothing terrifying, but just... Odd. I was laying down at my bed looking at my phone, and as I veered through the window with my curtain closed, I got a glimpse of 2 red lights moving towards the house, stopped, and eventually shut off; a car stopped by the house and parked probably at the driveway. I ignored what is happening on that house, there was just complete silence on what is on the outside. Only the sound of my fan was the only thing I've heard during that night I decided to pay attention to the house. Suddenly, I've heard some faint banging noise, coming in front of me. I stood up from my bed, looking by the curtains. The last thing I saw was the same 2 red lights turned on and I heard tires screeching loudly as they seemingly reversed and left seemingly in a hurry. I thought it was nothing, but at the same time, I am convinced there is something off about this house I was residing in, something weird is going on in that house; I don't even know what I just heard over there that send whoever drove that car leaving in a hurry, it was all so strange.

Perhaps the weirdest moment I have with that house so far however, is around by the 5th night. For the past 2 nights, there was just silence, no activity on what is happening inside that house across the street, no random person entering the home or weird noises that jolts me awake on bed. It was this night however, I probably have more questions than answers. I was about to sleep by the night on my bed, now my curtains is opened just enough to get a good view of most of the house's front facade, but the street next to it is covered with the linen of the curtain. Around 1 AM in the morning, i was about to shut my eyes until I start seeing 2 cars parked by the front door of the house; this one is interesting, before it was just a random cars like the second night being some sort of a basic car, but these 2 vehicles looked like SUVs, both colored in black. I watched in that tiny slit of the curtain as several men wearing black getup with a couple of people wearing white entered the home, with 2 of these men standing by the door. Around 20 minutes or maybe 30 minutes, I watched as 2 bright white lights shine in front of my window. I couldn't get a good look of what is in front, but briefly, I think I saw a white van pulled out of the driveway and eventually, the people who left their SUVs before entered their vehicles and left the scene. 

Now I have no explanation what exactly is this supposed to be. Normally I wouldn't ask what could it possibly be, but, what exactly just happened in that house? The first night is some guy entered like normal, and then exited the house, looking terrible. The second night, there something that could've happened in there that explained why they seemingly just rushed out of there. But the fifth night is what got me; I know I barely saw anything that give me anything concrete, but I saw what seems to be several men, definitely not just some random members of a gang drove by the house or some partygoers who just entered the house, and eventually leave with a van out of that garage. Now that I thought of it, I have never seen anyone else leave the place except maybe the man in the white sweater, the guy in his car, or even the group of men in their inconspicuous vehicles, and that van was the only thing that left out of that house, not once I saw anything else leave that place. I'm going to keep an eye out of that house and see if there is something else noteworthy, or even perhaps get a closer look like it's some sort of expose of something secret, I'll update if something come up.
