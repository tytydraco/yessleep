*Note: This sequel is from another perspective*

Hello Reddit, I'm Doctor Marie Castle, and I work at Essex County Hospital in Cedar Grove, New Jersey, and there's a dangerous creature roaming the town. And yes, it's a unicorn. 

About three weeks ago, there were several murders around the Cedar Grove Forest Reserve, and witnesses and authorities believed it to be a wild animal. By the third or fourth kill, the county sheriff and the conservation department searched the forest for the animal. On the search, two conservation officers were killed, and a deputy saw the whole thing, claiming it to be a unicorn. 

We all thought the deputy was too shaken by the whole ordeal, but he kept warning everyone to stay away from the forest, otherwise the unicorn would kill them if it was seen. He was put on suspension by his supervisor, but he even posted on this site, warning everyone of the killer unicorn in the forest.

Two days ago, a patient came in with a massive stab wound in their stomach. They were cutting down a tree near the Reserve and they saw an animal that attacked and nearly killed them. He managed to crawl into his truck and drive himself to the hospital as the creature ran back into the woods. When asked what animal it was, all he said was, "unicorn."

We had the patient stay the night, having given him some strong pain medication that made him a little loopy. 

Around midnight, I was in my office, finishing some reports, when I saw the patient frantically crawling down the hallway. I went to check on him, and he screamed, "LOOK AWAY! DON'T LOOK!" 

The lights proceeded to go off, and light footsteps sounded from down the hall. The emergency lights kicked on, dimly revealing the silhouette of a horse-like creature. A unicorn. 

I tried to help the patient escape and awkwardly grabbed him but the arms, but he pushed me down and put a hand over my eyes. "DON'T LOOK!" He kept yelling. Suddenly, his words became a scream of pain as he was dragged away by the unicorn. I heard a shriek of tremendous pain and sounds of blood before it was all over, and the lights returned to normal. 

I looked up to see the man's body, with an expression where you know it was the worst pain he ever felt. 

The Sheriff's Office was called, and I was questioned for the whole ordeal. I told them that an animal had broken into the hospital and killed the patient. They questioned other patients and staff and never saw the animal, but they did hear it right after the lights went out.

The cops checked the security footage and saw the patient being dragged and killed by a seemingly invisible creature. After that, they had us take off and the patients relocated to different hospitals. Still, The hospital is closed down, and I doubt it'll reopen anytime soon.

Anyway, I got on social media and reached out to the deputy who claimed he saw the unicorn. We talked over Facebook, and he said that it doesn't like to be seen, yet he saw it and it didn't kill him. However, since the unicorn came to the hospital to kill the patient, it could be coming for him next.

The deputy said he was hiding in his basement until he KNEW the unicorn wasn't coming for him. Which was smart, because the next day, or yesterday, a little girl was found dead in her backyard, with a massive stab wound in her stomach. 

Then yesterday afternoon, two men in suits came to my house. They liked like either the FBI or CIA, and they asked me several questions regarding my incident and if I ever saw the unicorn, to which I said I only saw its silhouette ---which they didn't seem to like. 

They told me to stay indoors for a few days, and that a man who be stationed outside my house for my "personal security." 

Today, the man is still outside, and as far as I know, the creature is still at large. I post this to warn everyone in or outside Cedar Grove about this thing. If you ever find it and see it clearly, pray.
