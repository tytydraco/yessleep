Ace is already geared up when I step into the briefing room. He’s tightening the last strap on his vest, head down, jaw flexed. Everything about him is controlled — not calm, not relaxed, just… contained. Like a knife that knows it’s a knife.

He doesn’t look up right away. When he does, it’s the smallest nod possible.

Not respect.
Just acknowledgment.

“Morning,” I say.

“Afternoon,” he replies, without checking a clock.

I glance at mine. I’m two minutes early.

I don’t comment. I just step fully inside, letting the door shut behind me. The room smells like gun oil, dust, and cold metal — a scent I thought I’d left behind years ago.

Viper is at the table, laying out rifle parts in absolute symmetry. Not a single wasted motion. Her hands are small, but every movement looks deliberate, surgical. She flicks her eyes up once — a quick scan, the kind you only develop after too many years expecting bad news.

“Didn’t expect you to show up early,” she says.

“You three don’t exactly strike me as the ‘brunch and mimosas’ crowd.”

Her lip twitches — not quite a smile, but close.
“I’ve done brunch,” she says. “It’s less exciting when no one bleeds.”

Gillette is leaning back in his chair, spinning in lazy half-circles. His shirt is loud — neon green print for a punk band that probably overdosed in the eighties. He looks like a kid who wandered onto the wrong movie set.

“Bossman!” he calls out. “You look less dead today. Progress, I guess”

"I'm trying this thing called functioning.”

“Oh, I tried that. Didn’t take.”
He winks, then immediately fumbles the sidearm he’s supposed to be cleaning.

Ace doesn’t sigh, doesn’t scold — he just tosses him a magazine without taking his eyes off me.

“Load that,” he says. “Quietly.”

Gillette salutes, nearly hits himself in the face with the magazine, and then gets to work — humming, off-key, but trying.

And somehow… the room feels lighter.

Still tense. Still uncertain. We’re not friends. Not yet.
But we’re no longer enemies either.

I take a breath. My throat feels tight — like I swallowed something sharp.

“Yesterday was rough,” I say. “I get it. None of us asked for this team. But we’ve got patrol tonight. And I’d rather not die because we’re strangers.”

Silence.
Then — Ace cracks his knuckles once. Loud. Sharp.

“Good start,” he says.

I step forward. “So tell me how you fight. No speeches. Just truth. What happens when we’re out there?”

Ace answers first. He always will.
“I hit first,” he says. “Hard. And I don’t stop until whatever’s in front of me stops moving.”

I nod. Makes sense.

Viper doesn’t look up from reassembling her rifle.
“I shoot once,” she says. “Maybe twice. If I have to reload, things have already gone wrong.”

Gillette raises a hand like we’re in a classroom.
“I talk too much, panic a little, and sometimes something explodes!”

Ace stares at him. Viper blinks once. Slowly.

“You’re joking,” I say.

“Mostly?” Gillette says.

I rub my eyes.
“Fantastic.”

But I mean it when I say:

“Thanks. I needed to know.”

Because tonight — we have to be a unit. Or we die as individuals.

Night drops hard over the North Sector — like someone draped a blackout cloth over the world. The air tastes like metal. The streetlights flicker, struggling, buzzing like dying insects. The pavement is wet from the rain that didn’t bring any relief. Just colder air.

We move silently.
Ace on point — shoulders squared, posture forward, every breath measured.

Viper sweeps the edges — rifle angled toward shadow, but never wasting a single motion. Her silhouette could be carved from the dark.

Gillette is behind them, humming something that might be a movie soundtrack or might just be nerves wearing a mask.

Me? I’m in the back. Watching their backs. The place my mother always taught me to be — where the danger sneaks up.

“This feels like a trap,” Gillette chirps.

“It’s always a trap,” Viper says, no emotion in it.

Ace stops walking.

No sound. No warning.
Just stillness.

And when Ace goes still — you listen.

I barely get my hand on my gun when the thing comes out of the dark.

It’s wrong.

Not just monstrous — wrong.
Limbs bending where they shouldn’t. Something like an arm, something like an insect’s spine, something like a deer’s skull twisted into the shape of a hunger that never learned limits.

No eyes. Just pits. Wet. Reflective.

Viper fires instantly — one clean, perfect shot that should have stopped anything natural.

It doesn’t slow this thing down at all.

A second one drops from a fire escape. No sound. No warning. Just weight and motion and too many joints flexing in unison.

Ace moves — but not fast enough.

I don’t think. I don’t hesitate.
Training takes over. The old kind. The kind I swore I’d leave behind eventually.

I shove Ace sideways and step in front of the thing just as it hits.

It’s like being stabbed by a steel girder. Hot, tearing, immediate. Something sharp rips across my shoulder — flesh tearing open like paper. I taste copper before I smell it.

My blood splashes the pavement.

Ace roars — not a battle cry. A pure, furious sound. A sound that meant it was time to throw down.

He grabs the creature by the throat — if you can call it a throat — and smashes it into the ground. Once. Twice. Again. Until the concrete cracks and the body stops twitching.

Viper fires again — one shot, right through whatever passes for bone. It collapses.

Gillette is suddenly beside me, hands hovering, voice jittering:

“—nonono that’s too much blood, Jack, how are you still vertical, sit down, oh god you’re sitting down, should I get a tourniquet or a priest—”

My knees hit the asphalt.

The ground is cold. My blood is warm. Too warm.

Ace crouches in front of me. His face was unreadable. Not angry. Something else entirely.

“You pushed me out of the way.”

“Yeah,” I whisper. “You’re on my team.”

“No one’s ever done that for me.”

“Then they were idiots.”

Viper finishes clearing the perimeter. Checks her corners. Reloads. Steps closer. Her voice is steady, but not cold.

“We’re not losing him,” she says. “Not tonight.”

Coming from her — that’s almost affection.

Back at base, Gillette is wrapping my shoulder. His hands are steady now — surprisingly so. He works like someone afraid to break something fragile.

“You’re not allowed to die,” he mutters. “You’re like…the adult. The functional one.”

“That’s… really worrying,” I say.

He grins. Small. Real.
“Yeah. It should be.”

Viper sits nearby, legs crossed, cleaning her rifle again. She doesn’t look up, but her voice is softer than the steel she usually carries:

“You did well.”

“Stupid,” Ace adds.

“Very stupid,” Viper agrees.

“But good,” she finishes.

Ace isn’t sitting across the room anymore. He’s next to me. Not touching — he’s not the type — but there. Solid. Present. Like a wall that decided to reposition itself.

He doesn’t say anything for a long time. Just… exists. Beside me. That’s enough.

My shoulder burns. My ribs ache every time I breathe. My clothes are stiff with blood. I can feel the pulse of every heartbeat in the wound.

But I’m not afraid.

Not the way I was yesterday.

And I’m not alone.

That part is new.

This is what it’s going to be — I can see that clearly now:

Nights full of things that shouldn’t exist.
Blood on the ground. Sometimes mine. Sometimes theirs.
Fighting creatures that don’t care about rules, treaties, politics, or survival.

Pain. Noise. Fear. Repeat.

But also—

Ace, silent and steady.
Viper, cold and precise.
Gillette, chaotic but loyal.

A team.

My team.

And I’m changing. Not into something monstrous — just into someone who can stand with people again. Someone who doesn’t let others fall.

Someone worth following.
Maybe someone worth saving.

The wound throbs. The room hums. The night outside keeps breathing.

But I feel something I didn’t feel yesterday.

Not peace.
Not safety.

Just this:

If I bleed for them, they’ll bleed for me.

And somehow…

That’s enough.
