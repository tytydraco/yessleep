 

For some context:  
The night has been long and I'm ready to call it quits. All I want is to get home and relax. Just as I'm about to switch off my taxi app, it rings. I look at the screen and see that someone needs a ride from an unknown location. I hesitate for a moment, but then remember that this is my job. With a sigh, I accept the request, and set out to pick up my passenger.  On my way to his location I realised that the night was strangely quiet, with hardly any cars on the roads. I had been driving my taxi for hours and my GPS had gone off the grid. I had no idea where I was, and the darkness of the night made it difficult to recognize any landmarks. I kept driving, hoping the GPS would eventually kick back in, but it never did. Instead, I found myself driving down a long, unfamiliar road, following the directions from my GPS. All the while, my mind was racing with thoughts of the long day I'd had. My shift had started early in the morning, and I hadn't had a break since. I was exhausted, but my next fare was waiting for me, so I pushed forward. But as I drove, the road seemed to stretch on forever. I started to get a strange feeling in the pit of my stomach. I felt as if I was being pulled deeper and deeper into an endless abyss. The road eventually ended in a tunnel, and all I could see was darkness.

I had no idea where I was, or where I was going. I was starting to panic, but I knew I had to keep driving. I drove forward, the darkness seemingly never-ending. I felt like I was lost in an endless abyss. As I drive down the seemingly endless tunnel, I can feel the darkness pressing in on all sides. The only source of light is from my headlights, which barely penetrate the gloom. The walls of the tunnel are nothing but a blur, and I can't seem to make out any details. I'm alone in this dark void, the only sound being the hum of my engine, the radio and the occasional echoing of my tires on the pavement. I'm not sure how long I've been driving for, but I can feel my heart pounding in my chest as I keep pushing forward, not knowing what lies ahead. No matter how fast I go, it feels like I'm going nowhere, like this tunnel goes on forever. I try to keep my focus on the road, but my thoughts wander. What am I doing here? Where am I going? What will I find at the end of this journey? I take a deep breath and keep my foot on the pedal, determined to see what lies ahead. I've come too far to turn back now. I can't help but feel frustrated as I drive through the never-ending tunnel, the same annoying radio station plays in the background. It's driving me mad - all I can hear is a man's voice droning on and on about some boring news story. I reach over and switch off the radio, but it won't turn off. It's still humming away, like a fly buzzing around my head.

I reach up and slam my hand down on the radio, trying to shut it up, but it won't stop. I can feel my patience wearing thin. Maybe I just need to get out of this endless tunnel and find some peace and quiet. I grip the steering wheel tightly, trying to keep my composure. I can feel my blood pressure rising as I continue to drive. All I want is a little peace and quiet, but I'm stuck in this mind-numbing cycle. I'm starting to get angry, and I can feel my patience wearing thin. My thoughts are racing and I'm starting to feel overwhelmed. All I want to do is escape this claustrophobic nightmare, but I don't know how. I feel like I'm slowly being suffocated and the panic is starting to take ahold of me. My mind drifts to the thought of killing myself. I know it's a horrible thing to think about, but I can't help it. I'm desperate for a way out of here and I can't seem to find one. I'm starting to realize that this could be the only way to get out.

I can’t help but check the clock every few minutes to see how much time has gone by. It feels like an eternity, but to my surprise, I’ve been driving for almost three days now. I’m amazed that my gas hasn’t run out yet and so has my phone battery, but I’m more worried about how much longer I have to go before I can get out of here. I feel like I’m stuck in some kind of weird purgatory where I can’t seem to make any progress.

If this post somehow becomes public, I'm hoping someone can assist me. I'm not sure how I'll get reception here or whether my post will even be able to publish.
