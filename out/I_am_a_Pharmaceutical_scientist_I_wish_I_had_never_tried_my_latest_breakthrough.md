I have been working on a new drug ‘ConSed’ which can put a person in a sleep like state while still being fully aware. This was first tested on various monkey’s on their responsiveness to instructions given while they were under. All of the test monkey’s followed the basic instructions once the effects of the drug wore off. Once this had been proven successful, we proceeded onto clinical trials. The main purpose of this medication was to help individuals who struggled with sleep disorders, such as insomnia or sleep apnea. It provides the restorative effects of sleep without actually requiring them to sleep. This would over time, alleviate some of the negative health effects of chronic sleep deprivation.

All trials were concluded in controlled environments, all patients were monitored at all times. These again were successful, 97% of all patients could recite pieces of text that were played to them while under the medication. Nearly all patients were able to describe many sounds that were played into the control room. The tests showed that 85% of all patients felt well rested after a five hour period while under the effects of ‘ConSed’. There were a few rare side effects that only around 1% of the patients experienced. One side effect noted was that some patients felt nausea once they had awoke. Another side effect which did somewhat unnerve me was that some experienced a person enter the room. They seemed very distressed when they finally ‘awoke’, many demanded to know who came in and why they approached them while they were unable to move. 

We told all of these patients that nobody had entered the room, all of the cameras that were monitoring them, showed them alone for the full 5 hour period. One quite disturbing interview with a patient in their early twenties, told us that once this person was looking over them, they whispered into their ear how they were going to kill them. We did further tests on this particular subject without any further anomalies in our analysis, they did refuse to try the drug a second time. The ultimate conclusion that was drawn by all parties was a phenomenon similar to sleep paralysis, which was rare but common in a lot is sleep based drugs.

I personally had my own sleep issues and this was a big influence in my drive in making this new drug a success. If it could help people, like me, that struggled with getting the desired rest that is needed, then that would be a dream come true. 

One Sunday night just under a month ago I was having a lot of trouble sleeping, even more than normal, I had a  big presentation at 09:00 in the morning and it was nearly 01:45. I remembered I had some ‘ConSed’ in my lab bag downstairs, I carefully got out of bed trying not to wake my wife. I went downstairs and took the medication, I went back up to bed as the drug took effect within 10-15 minutes. It worked as it should, my breathing began to grow slow and shallow with my muscles relaxed and my mind grew calm. 

It was around an hour or two in when I heard the door slowly open with a slight creek, my wife stirred slightly, before settling again. My mind eased as I remembered the hall window was left slightly open, the wind must have caught it gently. It then opened wider, I could feel the slight breeze across my face. Quiet, muffled footsteps slowly made their way round to my bedside. I felt a wave of fear come flooding from my mind, as much as I tried, I couldn’t move a single muscle. I felt the static like someone was right next to me, then someone leant towards my face, warm air brushed my cheek as I heard a rasping breath draw closer to my ear. 

“I am free, I will find you again, my face will be the last image you see before I rip your body open and take your life. Hear me, fear me, expect me”

My brain was trying frantically to wake my  still calm body, like I was trapped unmoved in my own head. I felt the warm air leave just as fast as the static, then the footsteps slipped back out of my room. Two agonising hours later, I started getting mobility back into my legs and then slowly I could move once again. My breathing started getting erratic and I felt a terror I had never experienced before in my life. I explained what happened to my wife but she said it must have been a kind of sleep paralysis, but it felt so real, too real. I remember thinking that this happened to one of the test subjects in the preliminary trials and we did rule it as sleep paralysis. This slightly eased my fear, I know the mind is powerful but this just felt different. 

I got into work earlier than usual, so I could make sure everything was in place for the 09:00 presentation with the investors. When I got in, the head of the facility, Mike, was already there and called me into his office. He explained that the presentation had been put back as there had been a complication. When I asked what had happened he said that one of the patients that had taken part in the trial had unfortunately passed away. When I probed for more details on what had happened, the undeniable fear took over me once more. Mike said that the patient that suffered from sleep paralysis in the trial period had been killed. Mike seemed to have more details on the incident then he really should have, but I know he had some high ranking contacts on the police force. 

He said that the woman in her twenties was found in her apartment, hung  up to a ceiling light fitting and had been sliced open from her lower abdomen up to her neck. There had not been any forced entry or any signs of a struggle. Most baffling of all, the security cameras didn’t catch anyone entering or leaving the apartment in the alleged time of the incident.

It was exactly a month to the day that she had been given the drug and had been in our facility. I left Mikes office, my face drained of blood and still not entirely sure the link between ‘ConSed’ and the senseless murder of one of the subjects. I went back to my office and re-watched the interview of the woman, she was in fear the whole way through. Her eyes darting around the room as if looking out for an imminent attack, then she went over how a person had entered the room and whispered in her ear. I watched the whole five hours of her laying in the test lab, nobody entered or left that room the whole time. 

There was something that I had missed though, a second interview. I was not involved as I had been away for a couple of days, my colleagues Dr Perez and Dr Stein conducted this follow up two weeks after the initial interviews and tests. Here is the transcript of part of the interview, that I’m sure is the reason why this project has been halted and why I now fear for my own safety.

Time: 10:45am

Dr Perez: I am conducting this follow up interview with my colleague Dr Stein as witness.
The interviewee is with a Miss **** ******.
The start time for this follow up interview is 10:45, Miss ***** do you recall the date when you last visited this facility. 

Subject: I do, it was 10th February 2023. 

Dr Perez: Good, do you recall the initial interview in which you experienced some minor side effects. 

Subject: They were not minor, someone came into the room and threatened to kill me. 

Dr Perez: The secure location that you were situated in, was monitored the whole time you were under the medication. Four cameras placed around the room and two more outside showed that nobody entered the room while you were under.

Subject: Are you calling me a liar? What I experienced that date was horrifying, I have hardly slept since, due to the horrific things I experienced. 

Dr Perez: We believe that you felt what is known as sleep paralysis, any phenomenon such as hallucinations or illusions experienced during sleep paralysis are not real and are simply the result of the brain being in a state of partial wakefulness.

Subject: Bullshit! I know what I heard, what they said to me!

Dr Perez: Miss *****, Please state what you heard while under this medication. 

Subject: I can’t.

*inaudible sobbing* 

Dr Perez: Please Miss ****, we are trying to help you, you need to let us know what was heard during this time. 

Subject: It..He said: I am free, I will find you again, my face will be the last image you see before I rip your body open and take your life. Hear me, fear me, expect me.

*Uncontrollable sobbing*

I stopped the video, my eyes began to water out of pure horror, I haven’t said anything since to any of my work team, I have only spoken to  my wife. Tonight is exactly one month since I took the medication, there has been no progress with the drug due to investigations. I’m scared and plan not to sleep tonight, the date is 18th March 2023. I plan to record myself all night and hopefully I will be able to update you all in the morning. 

After all, even though the subject experienced the same hallucinations as me, there couldn’t have been a link between her murder and the medication she had been given. 

Only a mere coincidence.
