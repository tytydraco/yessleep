Marc turned towards the crowd on the baseball field. They were eagerly watching him. He looked as if he was going to tell them something important. As if he gathered them around for some sort of announcement. I walked a little faster towards him. Miranda tried to hold me back. 

"Wait, don't go there!", she cried. 
"Don't worry, it's just Marc. I - I need to talk to him", I reassured her but that didn't land. 
"That's not your friend, Luke!" She looked at me with pleading eyes. 
"There's nothing left of him in there" I pulled my arm free from her grasp. I knew she was right but to accept that was agonizing.

See, since Marc killed the old god, I felt the duty to protect him. I knew he wasn't who he used to be, but when something important to you changes ever so slowly that you don't even notice, how should you know when those changes went too far? 

There wasn't a clear line, not like with our loss of Cora. One moment she was there and alive, the next she wasn't. A clear cut. Marc was still there, he was right across from me, breathing, alive, but also he hasn't been for a long time. I held onto something that already escaped my grip, one particle at the time. He lost parts of himself until nothing remained and no one did anything to stop it, no one even noticed. I didn't notice. I only had myself to blame. 

But if there still was something of him in there. Just a little bit of recognition for me, I had to act now or lose my last true friend forever. I knew I should have stayed away and accepted my defeat. I should have trusted Miranda, instead I asked her to trust me. I owed it to Marc.

I shifted my focus back on the huge skeleton. He talked to them. I heard the soft echoes of dripping water but I couldn't understand his words. I had to get closer. Quickly, I made my way onto the field, leaving Miranda behind. I felt her staring holes into the back of my head. Soon I was close enough to hear him speak. 

"So it really feels good to see you all again." 
He didn't sound like Marc anymore. There was no soul left in his voice, no emotion. Wrong pronunciations. 
"It came to my attention that one of our friends recently celebrated his wedding. Congratulations Adam!" 
The skeleton softly clapped his hands together. His movement didn't look natural. More like a marionette than a person. It looked painful. I wondered if Marc was in there, in pain. 

The crowd began clapping as well. Adam seemed to be among them. His friends playfully punched his shoulder and hugged him. 
"My greatest apologies for missing this special event." The painful reality began to rain down on me. I pushed my way through the crowd, further towards my former friend. Once I reached the front row and looked directly into the black void, the creature didn't recognise me. And neither did I. 

"But such a thing won't happen again. What about our old wedding tradition? What about a lovely round of bear-game?" 
The atmosphere became tense. There was a gust of cold wind blowing across all of our faces. Something was going to happen and it wasn't good. 

The new god raised his hands and with them, tall chain linked fences sprouted out of the perfectly cut lawn. Some rose from the border of the baseball field and many shorter ones appeared within it. They created a sort of see-through maze. My heart started to race. It was just like back in the courtyard with Cora. Pictures of her panicked face flashed in front of my eyes. And just like then, Marc was standing right outside the fence, just watching.

"Marc!", I shouted. 
My try fell on deaf ears. 
"Marc", I said once again, a little quieter. 
Finally the skeleton turned its head towards me.

 "My dear friend, Luke." 
It said with this gut wrenching voice that no human could have. 
"When will you learn the consequences of your actions?" 

His words felt like a knife to my stomach. It was too late. I heard Miranda shout my name from outside the fenced area. Her fingers pressed between the metal loops. The new god turned towards the masses and spoke again. 

"Adam", he said with his calm, almost whispered voice that echoed in my ears like in a cave. 
"Why don't you start us off?" His white, boney hand emerged from the deep shadow underneath his cloak and pointed vaguely at the new groom. Panic spread under the people. They were quickly backing up from their friend. The gods fingers curled and cracked as they moved into a fist. 

At this point, Adam started to scream. He fell on his knees and held his head, his stomach, his back. Everything started to shift. I watched his body contort through the many layers of fencing between us. His bones grew, his face became a snout. Green greyish fur grew out of his stretched skin. There was no blood, no signs of injury besides the deafening screams. Adam tore open his mouth and new, sharp teeth were burrowing out from his skull, replacing the old ones which fell out and landed in the grass. They were so long and sharp, like no animal I had ever seen would have. Because they would be useless to an animal. They made it unable to close its mouth. Such teeth can not chew, they can only destroy. 

I looked up at the new god. His permanent skeletal grin mocked me. The darkness around him expanded and started dripping onto the playing field. It engulfed my feet. Now Adam had finished his transformation. I guess one could call him a bear, I wouldn't agree. 

He was too small, not much bigger than the man used to be, but broader. He stood on four massive legs, furry and with sharp claws at the end. His greyish green hair looked rotten, like an animal carcass pulled from a lake. Sticky and dead. His face was almost flat, except the enormous fangs that protruded from his overstretched mouth. He was growling and shifting. But his eyes. His eyes stayed the same. Deep sadness, badly hidden behind murderous aggression. He shook and bit the air beside him. He couldn't move from his place. The new god still held his fist closed. I was petrified. I saw this thing before. I almost forgot what it looked like as it devoured that man. 

"Don't forget, Adam", the skeleton added. 
"This game isn't for women and children. Leave them out of it" 
His voice was stern and cold. I barely had time to think. At least there was something to discern the rules of the ballgame by, before I was in it. But I didn't know anything about this game. If it even was a game. I probably had to figure out the rules as I went. Maybe being still was a part of this one as well? My trembling legs weren't good for anything else anyways. It was so silent, that long moment before it began. A calm before the storm. 

Then the god opened his hand. The beast was freed, running and crashing against the fences with enormous speed. There was a struggle in the way it moved. I tried to stay still but I simply couldn't. My brain screamed at me to get away as fast as possible. Miranda was shouting something behind me. I couldn't hear her under all those other fearful screams. 

The bear barged through the maze like a wrecking ball until it reached the first one of its former friends. A lanky guy, cowering in a corner. Within seconds its massive teeth grabbed the man's body and swung him in the air. Blood was shooting in all directions. He flew through the air like a ragdoll until the bear caught him again with its paw. Smashing him to the ground before ripping off his limbs with ease. 

People were rushing by me, some starting to climb the fences. I turned to Miranda. She had already climbed the fence from the outside, holding out an arm for me. So I ran through the maze, as far as possible from the horrific scene that took place just a few meters away. 

As I reached Miranda I jumped up the fence and caught her hand. It was difficult for my foot to find hold on anything. The loops were too small and slippery from the dirt they just emerged from. With her help I made it over the fence relatively fast. Some of the other men were still struggling to get a grip on the wire while the women were standing presses against the nets, shivering and crying. 

I felt relieved to touch the grass on the outside of the fence cage again. But it wasn't over. I was far from safe, I barely got a minute of advantage. The bear had moved on from the mangled man. Ripping the next one from the fence he was climbing, like an apple from a tree. My heart stopped as I saw what became of the first victim. Monstrous jaws and a coat like weathered roadkill.

They're multiplying. 

Miranda shoved and pushed me further away from the massacre. It wouldn't take long until the beasts would jump the fence as well. I needed to run, now. I sprinted towards one of the endless stretches of grass that made up the valley between the two massive buildings. There was another fence coming up, the one that had always been there, the end of the garden. It took way longer to climb it without Miranda's help but I managed. The bears were already taking apart people outside the field. 

I turned and ran. Just ran without thoughts. As fast as I could, and faster. I needed to go faster. I could hear them behind me. Their growling and groaning. One must have been behind me somewhere. The white walls to my sides went on for a long time, but they didn't go on forever. I reached the end of my stretch, a turn right. I kept running. 

The building on my right had an entrance. A fence separated it from my path. I only saw it for a moment, too short to fully process it. A big square hole in the wall that led to another garden. A few doors, windows, benches. A sign above the entrance. I had no time to read it. A bit further, the building to my left ended and another one began. More separate buildings started to emerge. 
Where was I? 
How wasn't any of this visible from the vast fields up the staircase? 
The buildings and gardens became more elaborate. More detail, more class as I advanced through them. Some later ones even had colour and interesting architecture. 

I could almost feel the bear's breath in the back of my neck at this point. I heard it's claws ripping the perfectly curated grass into shreds as it ran. I waited for the next entrance. Some small alleyway that could get me out of this. There were gaps whenever one of those building complexes met the next one. I saw one not far from me. I had to make it. 

I could feel the bear's big paw swinging at me. It caught my shirt and ripped one long hole into the back of it. Luckily it barely scraped me, just gave me enough adrenaline to make it to the gap. I squeezed through and stumbled to the ground. The bear didn't fit. It pressed against the concrete walls biting maniacally into the air. I took a few seconds to catch my breath. I couldn't stop here, it would find a way around. I wasn't safe here. 

I continued to run down the path and emerged onto something resembling a road. Only it didn't lead anywhere. Disconnected stretches of asphalt between concrete blocks. From here, there were ways leading into all directions. I continued further and was beginning to feel lost. The blocks were more and more looking like colourful suburban houses. All fenced in with those darn chain link fences. Some had beautiful gardens with shrubs and flowers. One golden sign read "Lilac Lane City". It was placed upon the entrance of what looked like a preschool building. All fitting up to the coloured handprints on the inside of the windows. I ran until I found a way that wasn't cut off by a fence. 

It led to an open field. Not the same field as up the staircase but possibly the same area. I hadn't seen the bear in a while at this point. The adrenaline in my blood started to subside. Where was I going? Could I ever even find my way back once I outran that monster? I had to stop at some point. I couldn't continue like this. I slowed down and made my way into a small stretch of forest. The trees provided some welcome shade. Maybe I wasn't as easy to see in here. Maybe I had a chance to make it after all. 

It felt good to see some nature again for a change. Even if it felt wrong. The sound, it was too artificial. Like a forest soundtrack coming from a hidden speaker somewhere on top of a tree. There wasn't a single insect around either. I passed through the forest and found myself at the bottom of a small incline. 

I froze as I noticed a figure standing on top of the grassy hill. A familiar man. Where had I seen him before? I didn't know why, but something told me to help him away from here. It wasn't safe. I climbed up the embankment. The man noticed me immediately. I knew who he was. I had seen him get eaten by the bear before. That was not what made him familiar though. 
"You need to run! Go or the bear will get you!" I shouted but I knew it was to no avail. The bear was already breaking through the forest. I could hear it. I had to run. 

And so I did. I slid down the embankment and left the man behind. I didn't see what happened to him. There was no need to watch this gruesome scene again. I ran until I found the familiar staircase in the field. All along the way I ran, I never climbed or moved upwards besides the small embankment, still I reached this place, 35 stories above where I had started. Screw that. I hadn't had the energy to think about that. 

The neon lights were calling for me. This time, they meant safety. I almost fell down the staircase. Just like the first time I lived through this encounter, I reached the bottom of the stairs on my hands and knees. There was no proof for the game to be over but I knew it was. I stayed there for a while. Just sat there and tried to bring my heart rate back to a manageable level. People passed by, not acknowledging me. I was glad, I couldn't stand somebody talking to me now. 

There was something going on in the courtyard. Crowds of people gathered in front of the entrances. Was there new food? My stomach growled. I was so focused on running for my life, I almost forgot how hungry I was. I would have loved to just barricade myself in my room and never come back out, but my body wouldn't let me. Hunger forced me on my feet. I crept along the white concrete hallway until I saw what all the fuss was about. 

The food wasn't back. It was more than just that. I forced my weak legs up the steps into the courtyard. It was a feast. I entered a banquet of unbelievable extent. Shelves were overflowing with delicacies. Duck and pork roasts, multi story cakes, freshly boiled lobsters and a chocolate fountain. People were feasting on this all-you-can-eat buffet. They almost looked like wild animals themselves. I took my time walking through the banquet. All the meals were stacked upon the usual groceries. It was a beautiful mess. 

I ripped off a glazed turkey's leg and took a big bite. I swear, I had never tasted anything like it in my whole life. But maybe the hunger skewed my perception a bit. The sounds of masses of people chewing and slurping dampened it's magic. In the middle of the store, on the platform where the old gods head was propped up, lay now an enormous roasted suckling pig. Its dark red skin glimmered in the perpetual sunlight. Fresh fruits were stacked up around it and an apple adorned it's mouth. As I ripped out another piece of the turkey with my teeth I stared into its blank dead eyes and wondered: Were the people taken in exchange for this feast merely payment, or perhaps ingredients.
