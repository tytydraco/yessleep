I promised I’d update here if anything happened. It's been about 2 weeks since the incidents I mentioned in my last post about this, and things have been getting worse. 

For a while, my managers ramped up their strange behavior. It got more and more frequent. At least twice per shift they’d come up to me to have an awkward conversation that dragged painfully on until I dismissed myself by saying something like, “Well, I guess I should get back to work now.” And they still wear those grins. It creeps me out. It’s like a plastic mask they’re wearing, and their overly friendly tone is just as fake. 

I mentioned last time that they’ve been giving me more hours, allowing me to stay late. It’s gotten to the point that they ask me to stay late daily. I’ve been working 3 extra hours per shift, every shift. Don’t get me wrong I’ll take the money. But the sudden switch had me on edge. Not to mention all these late hours do get tiring. It’s hard to make time for my friends and family when I’ve essentially become nocturnal. 

A few days ago, when my bosses came around for their, now regular, conversation with me, I mentioned that I couldn't stay late that night. They kind of just stared at me, silently, for what felt like far too long. After that pause, their smiles fell. I mean like from the happiest they've ever been to completely blank.

Rich asked me coldly, “Why?”

I replied, “I just could use some sleep. I figured since it's the last day of the week and the truck's pretty much done it'd be fine.” 

Trevor responded quickly, almost interrupting me, “We're really going to need your help. You have to stay late.” 

I told them I wasn't obligated to and that, since I wasn't scheduled past 3am, I was going home at 3am. Without a word, they both turned and marched down the aisle and out of sight.

To be entirely honest, I could've stayed late. I had nothing going on the next day and I wasn't all that tired yet. I was hoping that if we had some type of disagreement, they'd snap out of this weirdness and go back to their usual, abrasive selves. No such luck so far.

The rest of that shift, I didn't see them. I took my break at the same time as George, the coworker I get along with that I mentioned in the last post. We usually sit and talk for a bit during our 15. Normally, his wife makes him lunch. But today, he wasn't eating. Actually, he wasn't doing much of anything. He was sitting at a table in the break room, hands by his sides, staring straight ahead at the lockers, which are across from the entrance so that I was looking at the back of his head. I thought he was just lost in thought so I sat across from him and said,

“Long shift? I saw your department got hit hard with freight.” 

He turned his head to look at me like how an owl does, without moving his actual eyes. My stomach twisted a bit when I saw that same plastic smile plastered onto his face. 

I've always known him to be a quiet man. But he responded to me in an overly enthusiastic tone. Almost like how a parent would encourage a child, “Sure did! Are you staying late tonight?”

I hesitated for a bit before answering, “Uh… no. I already told Trevor and Rich I was going home at my normal time tonight.” 

“That's a shame. We're really going to need your help.” 

He stood up and left right after saying that. It felt like it was a weird place to end an even weirder conversation.

I worked the rest of my shift until 3 am rolled around. For context, when the store closes, the doors are locked. Only my bosses have the keys for the door since they supervise the night shift. Normally, I need to go find them and ask them to open the door before I clock out and leave. Usually, I can just wave one of them over as I’m heading to the front. But that night, it took me 20 minutes to find them. I walked 2 laps around the whole store, looking down every aisle and checking both the break room and training rooms. When I finally found them, they were outside in the bullpen. That's a big concrete area behind the store that connects to the receiving area where they keep pallets of lumber, insulation, and other bulky items. When the store closes and the doors lock, the lights in the bullpen shut off. My bosses were both standing dead still, in the dark, staring straight ahead with those same smiles. 

I called out from inside, “Hey guys? Can one of you let me out?” 

They turned to me simultaneously. Trevor brought his watch up to his field of view, but I swear he didn't actually look at it. It was hard to tell in the dark. 

“Is it 3 already?”

“Yeah. Could you unlock the front, please?”

“You sure you don't want to stay late? Rich is going to buy everyone food.” 

“That's nice of you, but I already had my lunch.” 

This was another thing that threw me off. I mentioned that Rich often buys food for himself during his shift. I've worked with him for almost 2 years and he's never bought anyone else food. 

Once again, his smile fell flat. He followed me in and we walked together to the front. But he took odd paths, walking up and down aisles that lead away from the front, taking as long as possible to reach the door. Finally, he unlocked the door and let me out. 

That all happened last week. This week, to my relief, my supervisors have been giving me my distance. I'll still see them with their smiles and their stiffness but the strange conversations have been less frequent. 

That’s not to say all is well. I complained a bit in the last post about a strange smell. I swear it's been getting worse. No matter what aisle I'm in, the smell of rot follows me. I've scoured my departments for what I'm assuming is a dead rat, or several dead rats judging by the smell, but I've found nothing. 

It is cold out at night, however. The rats usually come inside and hide in the aisles for warmth and to eat the bird seed in the garden department. It's not the first time this has happened, but it is the worst case of it so far. 

Speaking of, they've been very active. It's not unusual to see a rat every now and again scamper in between aisles. But I've been hearing them a lot more than usual while I work freight. I'll be putting product away and hear a noise from within the aisle, only to look and see nothing but paint cans. It's also strange for them to hang around in the paint department, there's no food for them here. 

I saw on the last post you guys asked about quitting. I don't know if that's an option right now. The extra hours have really been helping and I don't think I can afford to stop working to look for another job right now. With my resume, there’s no guarantee I could find one that pays enough, anyway. And so far, even if it's been creepy, there are rational explanations for all of this. I can't put myself at financial risk over some weird run-ins with my coworkers and a bad smell. 

For now, at least, I’ll keep my head down like I always do and hope things sort themselves out. Like last time, I’ll make sure to keep note if anything weird happens so I can make another update.
