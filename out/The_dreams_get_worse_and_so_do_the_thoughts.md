I don’t even know how to begin this, but I really need to get this off my chest. I don’t expect everyone to believe me, but I’m hoping someone out there has experienced something similar, or at least can offer some advice. I feel like I’m going crazy, and I just need someone to understand.

I remember it like I was there. Oh god. I was in a room. A room made of darkness. I had a shotgun in my hand. Three women were bound to chairs, with bags over their heads, and they were trying to scream but they had something over their mouths. I think I was the judge, jury, and executioner. Someone told me to do it. They insisted. I had no control anymore. I wanted this. I walked up to the first lady and with no hesitation, pulled the trigger. Her head flew back and blood and brains splattered across my chest. I did not even look down. As her head slowly fell, blood started to ooze out and onto the ground. I walked over to the second woman and she attempted to scream. I loaded another round into the chamber and pulled the trigger. Again, Her head flew back, only this time… It came off. Blood splattered everywhere. I walked to the last woman. She was talking now. 

**“PLEASE YOU DON’T HAVE TO DO THIS! I’LL PAY YOU! I HAVE MONEY! JUST DON’T HUR-”**

The thunderous blast echoed through the darkness. Lastly, Without hesitation, without a single ounce of it, I pinned the shotgun to my chest, pointed it to my chin, and pulled the trigger.

My wife made me go to the therapist.

“Mr. Woudall, your wife says you need help. Do you think you need help?” Therapist Ray Slara says to me.

“I don’t need shit. I am fine. I have had a couple of bad dreams and that’s it. Nothing to it.”

“Well, can you explain to me those bad dreams?”

“Listen, I just said that I DO NOT need your help. I only came here because my fucking wife insisted. I know all you fucking therapist are only in this shit for the money. I mean who wants to listen to peoples shit problems all day and then tell them that it’s gonna be ‘alright’. Y’all are two faced bastards.”

“Why do you feel that way?”

“There’s always two sides to all you therapists. There’s one side that feels bad for the wittle ol’ crybabies. That side might give a little advice that may or may not help. Then the other side is the side that doesn’t care. The side that looks down on people who have genuine problems. You think you're better than people who need help.”

“That is where I am going to end our session. If you don’t want help then I won’t provide it. Goodbye.”

I burst out laughing and then left. Telling my wife that we will “find a new one”. We both knew that was a lie.

The next morning my wife told me that she had a headache. I asked her if she was okay and she seemed puzzled. I told her about what I heard and she said that she didn’t say anything then walked away laughing. I might be hearing things but I fucking swear I heard her say it.

That’s when it started. 

The thoughts…

At work I heard him say it. I heard Henry say that I was an idiot. I confronted him.

“What the fuck did you just say?” I ask him.

“I didn’t say anything.” He replied, looking at folders.

“I heard you say that I’m a ‘fucking idiot’” 

“You must be hearing things then.” 

He looks up.

“Wait, are you good?” He asked me.

“I’m fine. What do you mean?”

“You’re drenched in sweat and you’re panting like a dog. I’ll get you some water if you nee-”

I don’t remember what he said after that but I do remember my boss telling me to go home and rest. I felt like shit that day. I’m a nervous person. Like I’m stressed a lot but I have never EVER broken out in a sweat like that. I don’t even know how long I was sweating. Did nobody tell me I was soaking wet for that fucking whole day? I don’t know. What I do know is that I heard him say that I was a “fucking idiot”.

The next day was a blur. I went to the store and watched TV, I think that was it. But that night. Oh fuck. I now remember it. I fucking can’t type it. I have to. I am shaking. I think I’m gonna be sick. I just threw up. I have to do it.

I went out on my balcony to get a hint of fresh air. I looked over to my neighbors house and I heard it. I heard what he was thinking. Fuck. He was thinking of molesting a fucking child. I wanted to kick his door down and beat him to a fucking pulp. I wanted to grab his neck and choke him until he couldn’t breathe. I wanted to grab my fucking nine millimeter and blow his fucking brains out. I need to calm down.

 I don’t live in a bad area. I live in an apartment in New York City. I knew there were bad people here. I hear the news. Hell, I have been robbed once before. I have seen people get raped on the streets. But as always, I was too afraid to fucking do anything about it. You might say, “Why didn’t you go to the police?” WHAT THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO TELL THEM?!?! That I heard the thought of my neighbor? Who the fuck would believe me? They would laugh at me and say “bring us real evidence.” They’d think I was some fucking crazy lunatic. I’M NOT. I know what I heard. I know I’m not some crazy fuck. I know that I don’t have a fucking mental disorder. I don’t.

Then I had that dream.

I was in a room of darkness again. I had a knife. There were thousands of people standing around me. They all had their brains exposed. Their eyes were pitch black. I looked over to this one man. I walked over to him, with no control of me. I was in another one of those dreams that I was just doing and had no control. I grabbed the knife tight in my hands and plunged it deep in his exposed brain. He started to deform and melt. His whole body started turning into red liquid. Blood. I did it again. **A**nd again. **AN**d again. **AND** again. **AND A**gain. **AND AG**ain. **AND AGA**in. **AND AGAI**n. **AND AGAIN.**

It felt like I was stabbing for an eternity. Each person turning into blood. Then there was nothing left. Finally, I split open my head with the knife until my brain was exposed and plunged it deep into my own brain…

This was the point where I started to lose control.

I finally woke up. My brain is fucked. That is when I heard them all. I heard all of the voices. EVERY SINGLE THOUGHT. A man wanting to fuck a girl on the street. A woman who hates her husband and is having an affair. A child who is playing with his dog. My mind is gone. I’m numb. I can’t hear my own thoughts. I only hear others. 

I had to get away.

So I got in my car and drove. 

My wife called me. I declined. 

I found an Airbnb in the woods. It’s far from civilization. I am typing this out now. I am gonna wait a couple of days before I post it to see if anything else happens. Maybe this is gonna go away.

Oh god. Oh fuck. FUCK. I am shaking. I just killed her. I didn’t have any control. She wanted to hurt me. I heard the thought. My wife found me. I don’t know how. She was angry. All I could hear was her anger. Fuck. She drove here by herself. The door was locked and she started getting angry. I heard her thought. It said, “I’m gonna fucking kill him.” You’re probably gonna think that she meant that in a way that was joking or playful but I couldn’t be sure. I had to do something. I had to defend myself. Do you think the court will believe me? Am I losing control? I think I am. I don’t know what losing control of my own thoughts even means anymore. I just want to go back. I wish I got fucking help. I wish I had listened to her. 

It’s been about an hour since the incident. I’m sorry god.

Now it’s been a day. Her corpse is still on the porch. I am gonna have to grab it and bring it in the house. 

I am not crazy. I loved her. She was going to kill me. Nobody is gonna believe me. I had to. I brought my nine millimeter when I left. That's what I killed her with. 

I have decided. I am going to kill myself. I’ll post this and see if anyone will help. I guess my dreams really mirrored reality. I always kill myself at the end of each dream. If anyone can see this, who is struggling with whatever I have then try to get help. I’ve gone too far. I don’t want people to think that they should kill themselves. There is always another way. Just not for me. Get help before it’s too late. Please. I love you mom. I love you dad. And Mr. Ray Slara I am sorry that you could not help me. If you see this then know that I was NOT crazy. I was just a guy who was given a curse. This curse is real. 

***Goodbye.***
