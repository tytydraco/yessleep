Yes, in a town between mountains, where patriarch and tradition still courses through its veins, witches are a fear as great as that of poverty.



“Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live” being the slogan and symbol of the community, which was nestled, fairly ways away, from towns which in history believed that witches were humans who's souls had already been taken by Satan or his servants and the only way to deal with them was a burning.



Of course, that being said, considering the length of time to travel between these towns originally, and the many different cultures which found their way through it, some believing a hanging or a drowning, the tales themselves also lengthened and changed, which is how the town had formed its modern take on witches.



I don't know how all of the tales came to be, mostly I just know them, because from a young age it's taught to all girls and boys how witches come to be and how to get rid of them.



The red mountain which stood high and looming above the town to the north, is as evil as the devil himself, according to the tales, and that is why he made it one of the many entrances to his hell kingdom.



He made some kind of pact with the mountain and ever since demons came from within it and witches were born there, and that's where they should be put to die.



All of this may make the town sound like the rustic, maybe even picaresque view of the late sixteen hundreds witch trial towns and the people acted such, but the town's own infrastructure is more similar to that of Harper's ferry or a town on the Chesapeake bay.



I could tell you the tales of the town, but I'd rather stick to mostly mine, even if mine is mostly that of the towns.



I'd rather suck the life from that excuse of a culture and suffocate it rather than breathe life into it by sharing all their stories in a glorious way, even if it means breathing that air again.



Every year, every October, it doesn't matter which day, it happens that one of those days is witches night and every one of those mornings a man called a messenger perceives those “witches” and every night those “witches” are buried alive under the ground of the red mountain on his words of the laws that the witch has broken.



No one with as good of a head as can be when you're taught like that can try to go against this holiday as if a man does he is tortured and imprisoned, though some have even tried, and if a woman does she is a witch and is executed.



Women have never been allowed to drive and most have never been allowed to travel to the towns over for as long as I can remember.



All the power in the town was laid to the patriarchs and the ideas that the pompous wives had sewn in their heads, some random girl could out of nowhere be condemned to death if in the right season or because they got on the nerves of someone higher and otherwise be put before the church for condemnation in other means



We could give birth and do the house chores, watch after the children and tend to the animals, the things alike were also available.



There were a few who on occasion were allowed to be with their husbands on the way to other towns and pick up entertaining things as gifts and books for folk of the town, and some I remember even fled then, some couples fled too.



Some got away, god knows where they went, most were caught by the town heads.



Some were allowed to live, if seen as a capable child bearer or likewise, but would have to confess all sins so that they were forgotten by the devil first which most did swiftly.



I remember once my father told me how after my mother tried to abandon the town before i was born, she came back sobbing ferociously crying out-



 “A WITCH AM I! AN ABOMINATION IN THE FACE OF GOD, I SOLD MY SOUL TO SATAN FOR POWERS UNGODLY!”



And i remember being told how she begged to be buried on the red mountain but how her husband came to her and said-



“From bone to blood; from blood to flesh, from flesh to skin, from skin to the world, I cast thee devil out of this woman, my wife!”



And She passed out, eventually coming to confess.



Later my mom would secretly tell me how I needed to run far from this town, abandon all and never look back, not even for my father.



That all to say; the town wasn't just a torture fest every day and we didn’t try to get away most of us, most thought the town as normal as any other but almost all feared witches night. There was a certain skepticism to how they were chosen and it was always in the back of the mind to me, “what if it's me? Oh god what if they get it wrong and choose me?”



Though I knew a few who walked with such ease on that day, who were so certain they could never be condemned.



I guess it makes sense that when it came 'round I was called witch.



I turned eighteen last month and since then people have been eyeing me down like the devil. With the words of my mother I've always been rebellious to this place and what I was prosecuted for was all of those rebellious things.



It is only known by the trusted that its witches night, so when my father asked me to walk with him to my own mother's grave so we could mourn and talk, I felt fairly calm, hoping I could soothe my still heartbroken father.



By this point my mother had died a couple years ago, from the same ailment i was now dealing with, even after my father exorcised her she was still killed later.



My father led me down the road, the red mountain seething over the trees becoming larger as we walked towards it. Looking at it made me anxious, I began to feel something was wrong. October always has me on edge but never did I think my father would bring me to my death.



We walked through a break in the trees my father not saying anything until we reached my mothers grave, even then through sobbing words all he said was-



“I'm sorry... I love you.”



He broke down in tears and I saw torches begin to light all around me.



And then I saw the dug out grave and coffin as The people closed in on me.



At this point I knew my fate and I knew the faces of the torch lighters.



My father walked away.



“Hailey Grace Davis, it is here upon the red mountain, the witches graveyard, that under the revelations of God unto his messenger…”



“Oh my God… no” i muttered, he carried on without pause.



“that you are condemned for your sins of witchery, treachery, blasphemy and poverty from the holy ghost.”



“No… please… I haven't once said a thing against God… Listen…” I started to sob.



“The man who has seen these visions has declared that it is you who has said false things at church, sacrificed in the name of Satan and sold your soul to him on these very grounds, now your body shall be with him too until the day that Jesus takes back his souls from the wretched stones of hell.”



So many words settled in my throat that they blocked my speech until finally i settled on-



“HE'S A LIAR! Please listen, please, for the love of God. On everything I would never find a word or action against the holy, I would never sell my soul… I'm not my mother, I'm no witch… NO DON'T!”



My thoughts fled between the times I had come to the red mountain trying to find the devil or the entrance to hell when I was younger, when I bathed in the rivers coming from it which the others said was the blood of the tortured souls from within. 



From a littler age my mom had called me a witch but I wasn't and i didn't believe the mountain was hell, still now i wished i had those powers as no other words were spoken by them, only the cracking of the fire and the leaves breaking beneath the mans feet as he walked towards me with a large piece of wood.



I knew what he was going to do, I saw it happen before, I clamped my mouth shut as hard as possible and shook like I never saw anyone before but still, he handed the wood to another man and pushed his fingers between my lips, cutting them and pulling down on the bottom one so I would open my mouth.



I couldn't resist as i felt my lip tearing off and blood filling my mouth, my teeth came unclenched and the man pulled my jaw open as wide as possible. I tried so hard to bite but I couldn't. The other man placed the log in between my teeth before hitting it with the palm of his hand, forcing my mouth to stay open.



I felt the tear at the back of my throat, the teeth in my cheeks and I passed out.



I guess what happened after that is they put me in the coffin and dropped it in the ground face down, dumped the dirt, lime and sand mixture on top then asked for forgiveness and blessings before scattering off in different ways, at least that's what id seen before, now all i knew was i was in an upside down coffin, with injuries i wished had killed me.



Vomit and blood mixed in my throat as I gagged, I pulled against the wood with so much pain, it pulled against my teeth but it came out and so did everything in my mouth.



I felt the cuts and my tongue rubbed raw from the wood, snot and tears rolled down my face and the sticky mess slowly dripped from my mouth and nose.



The searing pain was only held back by the absolute numbness of my brain, it felt like I was dead, everything felt slow and impossible, I couldn't see anything anyway but the fuzzy colors that flew across my vision.



Why couldn't I die, I remember thinking but at the same time i was so terrified of the sensation that I thought was death, it felt worse than any pain I've ever experienced and more nauseating than the worst sickness.



I sat, in limbo between living and dying, feeling the blood coursing through me and my heartbeat, feeling everything and nothing.



It felt like forever before finally I could move my arm which was tingling as i brought it up to my face to move the hair from sticking on my face.



I could still feel the burning and the taste of the liquid in my throat as I spat again, it was all pooled beneath my face but there was nowhere to move so I lifted myself barely on my elbows.



Without thinking much and only my brain shooting for the instinct to survive, I drove my elbows into the lid below me and forced myself into the top, trying to break it. It didn't budge. I tried forcing my fingers through the lid which scraped my skin but I got my fingers out and was able to wiggle the lid so much that it broke. Some dirt pooled in and my hands instantly went at it pulling clumps of it in with me hoping to dig some hole.



I went between that and banging my back on the top until finally I felt the dirt below me give away and with one more bang I felt the ground below fall in and i was suspended in air for a brief second before again I was falling to another ground.



My nose banged on the ground, dirt and rock ground instead of wood, and it broke. I sneezed sputtering misty blood in the air and my right leg felt thick and heavy and torn but I was on some ground which gave me some little hope.



The coffin felt less heavy as I lifted up and again sensation flooded me as the coffin came off of me and I crawled through the opening that was made, once I got out the coffin fell back down again and I was out.



Sleep came to me easily and my thought right before I drifted off was “this would be a sad time to die.” And I was afraid because I thought I was surely going to die when I felt my heartbeat slow and my sensation disperse.



When I woke up the sensation was back though and at its most nagging rather than deathly state. Still horribly painful but everything was sore and I had no idea how long I'd been down there, my leg was absolutely broken from the falls and the coffin had landed on it.



Most of the dirt mixture above the coffin hadn’t fallen in and I couldn't see anything.



I felt around feeling only the rocks until I came to the stone wall of the cavern and I used that as support to walk with my other leg.



As my eyes adjusted I realized that in fact there was a very small light coming from a break in the stone, so I made my way to it, having to traverse all along the wall to get there.



The break in the cave wall led into a path that ended beyond what i could see but beams of light shone in from holes at the top, small as a dime but i could tell it was day now.



I hoped this would lead to an exit and walked along it, the path wriggled left and right constantly, even up and down, the lights coming and going. It was like it was a path left by some giant snake.



Finally I came to the end of this path.



A cold wave washed pass through.



It led into a cavern where light barely eluded it, only the essence of the light brightening the place at all, the source coming from deeper still.



It was enough to see the skeletons and the bodies though, enough to see the gnawed corpses of people I knew, the worm infested canals of blood in them and the dusty skeletons.



The cold washed again and the light was enough to see the man that was just squatting over one of the bodies and eating it, standing up.



“Hailey?’



The man who had read my sins, who had condemned me to my grave, was now before me. His voice unmistakable and just like the jagged roughness of the cave rocks and his eyes glimmering like a diamond stuck in stone.



Evidently the light was upon me and my bloodied body which made me just as recognizable.



He began to laugh, his voice and sounds blending into a snake like hiss.



I was leaning against the wall still, holding myself up, my heart beat rising into my head and goose flesh along my skin.



Turning away from him I ran as fast as I could along the stone wall knowing I couldn't make it, the cave walls bowed out before coming to the hole. When I saw him running at me too I jumped as far as I could and landed on my side.



He pounced on me, all his weight forced on my non broken leg and drool dripping from his lips and onto me, his mouth formed like a dog about to strike its prey.



I tried to scream but the wounds in my throat burned when I made a sound.



His arms were on my shoulders holding me down and he lowered his face onto mine, licking my blood.



Through the burning and ripping feeling I managed to utter some of the words my father said to my mother to exorcise her, most of them coming out as flat air.

I thought to try anything and it worked, he roared at me, spit flying at my face and took one of his hands off of my shoulder and gripped my hair pulling my head to the ground.



I grabbed a stone and forced it into the side of his face. Again and again, it caught him by surprise and I wouldn't try to escape unless I knew he was dead, so the stone went until I could feel his skull breaking and his screams stopped.



Moans came from my throat finally, weak and desperate, I was crying but no tears came. Both of my legs now were heavy and unable to move so I crawled on my arms.



I crawled through bodies and bones, my arms scraping on the rock and at the end I saw the pentagram and all the things we were taught were witches' items when I was a kid right behind where the man was cannibalizing.



I crawled through the hole in the cave on the other side and the sweet embrace of daylight shone on me, a feeling of absolute euphoria filled me as my shaking limbs reached the mouth of the cave and I rested for just a little bit.



The short rest was all I needed so that I could crawl to the river, lay on my back and flow.



I floated down the river, watching the trees above me pass, no matter how much time passed there it would feel less than any time i had in the cave, the day was beautiful and i felt horrible but i let the nothingness that had overtaken me in the coffin take me again only this time it felt more peaceful.



The hospital had laid out water next to me which I drank instantly, it slid down my numb throat in gulps.



Somebody had seen my floating body in the river and thought i was a corpse so called the cops, once they realized i was still alive they took me to the hospital and I've been there for awhile now.



I've recovered mostly now, as in I don't constantly feel the pain, but I have physical therapy and have to use a wheelchair most of the time. I eat through a straw and all that stuff. My body’s real damaged but I'm lucky and my mind is resilient, my doctors said.



The police came through and i told them everything, my father came before that but i told him to leave.



When i'm not at the hospital i like to go to the library, so I've read a lot and someone recommended this site after seeing me read about witches and I've loved reading these stories so i decided, why not share my story.



While I'm out sometimes I swear I see my father watching me, eyeing me down like the devil, and I get scared because I think he'll take me back there, back to hell.



Well Halloween is coming soon and they say the devil comes that night, so i pray I've been wrong and i hope it's not him.



Happy Halloween to those who celebrate, watch out for witches and the towns that still have witch hunts please.
