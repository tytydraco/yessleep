I had never felt so loved in my life. With Dylan, everything felt effortless. He had this way of making me feel like the most important person in the world, even in the simplest moments. His voice, soft and steady, always seemed to wrap around me like a warm blanket, soothing away any anxiety. Whether we were joking about something silly or sitting in comfortable silence, I felt like I was exactly where I was supposed to be—right beside him.

It was hard at times, being long distant. But even with the rough eighteen hours between us, i would've risked it all for him. We had been together for just over a year, met on some sketchy app called Whisper, an app that you would never even think you'd be able to find a gem like him.

I sat there smiling at my laptop screen, watching Dylan’s beautiful smile as he leaned in closer to the camera. His eyes disappeared every time he smiled, crinkling at the corners, and in those moments, I couldn't help but feel a flutter in my chest. His whole face lit up with joy, like nothing mattered except for being here with me. We shared a few jokes, laughing over the dumbest things, and it was just... perfect.

 We shared a few more jokes, and then I pulled out my phone, mindlessly scrolling through TikTok and Instagram, clicking on random things I didn’t need—endless reels of people cooking, dancing, or showing off their pets. The usual distraction.

"Do you want to play Minecraft in a bit?" My boyfriend's voice came softly through my laptop speakers, followed by a slight crackling sound.

I thought for a moment, glancing at the Switch I had left on the desk. "Yeah, I want to start a new survival world," I replied, plugging it in. "Just let it charge for like thirty minutes, and we can jump in. I’m excited." I hit my vape, exhaling a cloud as I opened a new tab, searching for base inspiration—something that wasn’t too complicated but still looked cool. Meanwhile, his obnoxious YouTube video continued in the background, some kind of game documentary or fan theory I couldn’t follow. But it didn’t matter. It kept him entertained, so I didn’t mind.

"I’m gonna go use the bathroom.." Dylan said with a smile in his voice. "When I get back, your Switch should be good to go."

I laid there waiting for him, entertaining myself with tiktoks of Minecraft base builds that seemed way too complicated for me, but it wasn't like i was going to do anything but plant flowers, build farms and collect dogs while Dylan did the actual building and surviving. I still could her the occasional cutting in and out from his youtube video, it sounded like some video game documentary or something that would be uninteresting to everyone except for him, but it kept him entertained so. 

A few more minutes had passed and the lights in his room turning off caught my attention but not for long, he had always done that, kind of his way of letting me know he was back before he actually got in front of his computer. But after five minutes he was still not at his desk. I assumed he went to the kitchen for a snack or checking on his mom or something, i didn't question that much to be honest. 

Then, I heard the Discord notification sound, the familiar ding breaking the quiet. I didn’t think much of it—probably just a notification from one of our old servers. But then another notification came. And another.

Looking at the screen, my heart froze.



@/diamondm1ner#7856: Someone is in my room

@/diamondm1ner#7856: That’s not me

@/diamondm1ner#7856: I’m scared



I took a deep breath and glanced up at his cam, not seeing anything in the darkness but his tapestry in the back, i rolled my eyes and sighed. 

"Okay, funny funny, im scared Dylan, can we play Minecraft now?" My discord dinged again.



@/diamondm1ner#7856: Baby i dont know what to do. That’s not me. The light is off, I can’t see through the crack in the door. I’m going to call the police and stay quiet. Don’t leave the call. Just turn off your cam so he doesn’t see you


I froze, my heart hammering in my chest. The words felt wrong, disjointed somehow. My eyes flitted to the cam feed again. The room was still dark, but I could make out the faint outline of the door, just a sliver of light coming from beneath it.


@/weirdpuppygirl#2614 : Okay, I might be a little scared now , i didn't hear any doors open so i just thought it was you


I typed my message with shaky hands, anxiety building like a knot in my stomach. I pulled my laptop closer, the warmth of the screen almost comforting in the growing tension. I was just about to turn off my camera when, suddenly, I saw something that made my blood run cold.

Dylan sat down in front of the screen.

At first, I exhaled, relieved. Of course, he was back—he was just messing with me, being his usual playful self. But then, something felt off. Very off.

I moved to turn off the camera, preparing to jokingly scold him for scaring me so badly. But as the camera flickered off, the faint light from his computer illuminated his face.

It was him. Or… it looked like him.

But the expression wasn’t right. His face was completely blank—no smile, no recognition of me. He didn’t blink, didn’t move a muscle. He just stared, unblinking, directly into the lens of my camera. My stomach twisted. His eyes—so eerily empty—looked like they were staring straight through me.

I don’t know why, but I hung up.

Everything in me screamed to do it. I didn’t wait for him to react, just clicked the button and closed the call.

I stayed up all night, staring at my screen, waiting for a message from Dylan. Something—anything. But the messages never came. No reply on Discord. No text messages. No calls.

It was like he had vanished. Like he was erased from every corner of the internet, every part of my life.

The longer I waited, the more my thoughts twisted into a knot of confusion and fear. I tried to tell myself it was just a freak accident. Maybe the camera had glitched. Maybe it wasn’t Dylan at all, but some trick of the light or shadows. But deep down, I knew that wasn’t true.

I couldn’t shake the image of his eyes—so wide, so empty. The face that was supposed to comfort me, the face I loved, was gone. What was sitting there, staring at me through the screen, was not him. Not my Dylan.

I even asked one of my friends to attempt to help me make sense of it all, but she just said mabe he wanted to ghost me without hurting my feelings. No. Dylan wasn't like that, i know people say that about every person they are with but he truly was an angel.

I tried to make sense of it. Tried to think logically. Maybe someone had broken into his room. Maybe it was his brother, or one of his friends messing with me—something that would explain the darkness, the silence. But that didn’t fit. If it was someone else in his room, why didn’t they make any noise? Why didn’t they act like a person?

I kept asking myself: What was that thing on the other side of the screen?

What if it wasn’t Dylan at all?

Where is my sunshine?
