So I had just gotten into couch flipping, the day before this I had managed to smelt aluminum in a forge we made at home so we were excited to get more metal to melt (my and my 16 year old friend) So we decided to go to (shithole white trash neighborhood) to pick up random scrap metal laying around that people dump on the way home from picking up the couch. While we were on these sand dirt roads a guy with an atv came flying up behind us and knocked hard on my window and said something along the lines of (you motherfuckers do you have a liscense) and then I saw him reach in his back pocket and I drove like hell. I was flying down these shitty sandy dirt roads at like 65 mph running from this guy who was on an atv riding our ass.

I'm only 16 and this was scary as fuck. My friend suggested calling 911 and I said no at first but he was going on us hard so I said yes call them. We were like 1-2 miles into this shitty sand area and I couldn't even stop at the stop signs while driving he was going so fast. I was so scared that eventually we would have to stop at some point becuase of traffic or a red light but god was looking fondly at us and gave us clear turns the whole way. At one stop sign there was a prius and I had to make a full 90 degree turn on the sand road. I was flying down the turn at 30 and this fucking guy cut the corner of the intersection through the grass and went in front of me and break checked me. I slammed on my breaks and he went like 20 feet ahead and off to the side some. 

Me and him sat there for like 2 seconds as he was probably trying to think of the next move. But I just swerved around him and flew down the road towards the main road. AND HE STILL FOLLOWED ME ON THERE. At this point 911 was still talking to us and I was shitting bricks. I was telling them I was about to go on the highway to avoid this guy becuase his atv definelty can't go on there. But when we turned from the main road to a bigger main road he stopped following us. So I just ended up going to a public parking lot and trying to recover while my friend was still on the line with 911. I was sick to my stomach and almost threw up and had to lay down right there in the parking lot. I was really scared he was going to recognize me with my giant ass couch in the back of my truck but I was able to drive home and i'm still paranoid. 

I broke down crying like 3 times thinking I literally could have fucking died right there if I didnt actually use crazy tokyo drifting driving skills to get away or if there was a red light. Or if my tires were bald or if my car had low gas or if it broke down I would have literally fucking died most likely. This guy was probably on meth or something. Looking back my dad though that maybe he was mad becuase he could have thought we were trying to dump this couch we had. We were not trying to dump it I just happened to have it.
