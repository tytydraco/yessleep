“Is your sister going to the party?” I asked in earnest as we walked the streets at dusk. 

Tyler looked at me suspiciously before answering. 

“She's not, no. She got called in to babysit for the neighbour's kid.” 

“That's a shame,” I said. 

“Shut up man,” Tyler retorted and we both started laughing. 

It was October 30th 2008, and I was yet to get a Halloween costume. Now, I was a walking stereotype back then. My dad was one of the richest men in my home town, and owned half the properties down main street. From ten onwards, I was given an allowance on par with my teacher's salaries, and had a car in waiting for when I finally got around to getting my license. For the past few years, I would go all out on my Halloween costumes. I'd become known for it, and had an image to upkeep. It was also my ticket to the Brooker's Halloween party, which had become more of a rare privilege after their parent's divorce. This particular year, I'd left it to the last minute. I had the body of it picked out, a musty leather trench coat, covered in straps and torn at the hem. I knew what mask would go perfectly with it, and that's why I was walking to Lagro's Novelties with Tyler. 

Largo's was open year-round, but came alive in late September. Cramped aisles of party gimmicks and cheap costume party outfits were replaced with high quality silicone masks and other gear perfect for Halloween night. He made a fortune from autumn, which was evidently enough to carry him through the rest of the year, comfortably. Largo himself was an older man, mid sixties if I had to guess. He had a thick central European accent which overcame his speech to the point where it became hard, for me at least, to decipher. He'd dress old-fashioned whenever I saw him, usually a worn, yellowing shirt and tweed suspenders. He had a pocket full of candy as well, and would always give a handful to his smallest customers. 

“Can you finally tell me what you're gonna get?” Tyler asked as he neared Largo's small store. 

“Fine,” I said impatiently, "I had my eye on the red devil mask.”

“Bro!” Tyler exclaimed, “are you serious? The one behind the counter?”

“Yup,” I replied singularly. 

“But that's like two-hundred dollars!”

“I know," I said coyly. 

The mask really was a work of art. I had my eye on it since I saw the price tag last week. Every pore of the thing's red, silicone skin had been punctured individually, as had every strand of black hair. Complex vinyl horns decorated its scalp, and the face had been moulded into a perfect mocking grimace. Not only would it fit around my entire head and neck, but the chest carried down under the collar. It was seamless, and had an immaculate attention to detail. I could see the hatred in its glass eyes, which carefully concealed two small eye holes on either side of the scrunched nose. It was also, importantly, very expensive. It was the exact statement I needed to make to the Brooker twins that my place at their parties should always be expected. 

Largo's Novelties was an unassuming building. It was like any other store on the street, only with a duller paint job and no windows. The indicator to what lay within was a few tearing posters and a rusting metal sign that proclaimed the store's name in a circus font. Inside, however, it was a different story. The layout was like an antiques store, but packed with horror gimmicks instead of old clocks. As we approached the building, we saw a crowd of kids and young teens trying out their new purchases, jumping out at each other and reacting with mock terror. Tyler and I shrugged passed them and entered Largo's. The smell of must was immediate, emanating from goods that had just come out of a year in storage. 

“I'm gonna look at the fake blood,” Tyler said and broke away from me, disappearing down one of the labyrinthine aisles. 

I waved him off mockingly and went to peruse some of the masks. There were rows of freaks on wooden stands, everything from zombies to vampires to dead presidents. All had a high level of detail, but none came close to the red devil. I made my way between the rows, shouldering hyperactive kids as I went by. After I finished the courtesy of looking around, I walked over to the now free counter. The old man Largo greeted with a smile and a raise of his bushy grey eyebrows. 

“What can I do for you, friend?” He chuckled out and leaned across the counter. 

I pointed, two-hundred dollars gripped in hand, at the red devil mask taking pride of place behind him. The inflated price tag dangled down, mocking those who couldn't afford it. But not me. 

“I'll take that,” I said, placing the money in front of him. 

Largo turned, following my finger and saw what I was pointing at. He turned back to me shaking his head and waving his hands. 

“Is not possible,” He said, solemnly. 

“I have the money. Count it.” I replied. 

“Is not possible,” Largo repeated. 

“What do you mean ‘not possible’?” I asked, my anger growing. 

“Is not for sale,” Largo answered. 

“Yes it is!” I argued and pushed the rolled up bills towards him. 

“Is not for sale,” Lagro said yet again and yanked the price tag off the mask. 

“Why aren't you selling it to me?” I asked, my anger clear. 

“Please, leave my shop,” Largo commanded, his cheer now gone. 

“Is everything ok?,” asked Tyler.

He was standing behind me, holding a small bottle of red, proudly non-toxic liquid. 

“The bastard won't sell me the mask!” I told him, addressing Largo like he wasn't standing next to me. 

“Please leave my shop, now,” The old man wheezed out loudly. 

“Not until you sell me the mask!” I demanded. 

A line of parents with their impatient kids had formed behind me, and all seemed to be taking the old man's side. I looked at Tyler to back me up, but he just looked at the floor. 

“Fuck off!” I said at no one in particular and stormed away embarrassed, pushing over a rack of plastic vampire teeth as I went. Thinking back, this was probably the first time I'd been forbidden from doing something, and I could not get used to it. 

The next day I awoke in a  sour mood. Light from the cracked curtain shone directly in my eyes as I tried to get back to sleep, and the day didn't get much better from there. A set of plastic vampire teeth had found their way into my pocket during my grand exit from Largo's, and I figured that I could fall back on going as David from Lost Boys. I already had the hair for it. As the day went by, and as I watched myself grimace in the mirror as the hard plastic of the fangs dug into my gums, I came up with a new plan. I was going to walk into the Brookers’ party looking like I'd just arrived from Hell anyway I could. 

I messaged Tyler's MySpace, explaining the plan to him and asking if he'd join me. Despite his willingness to do things like this with me before, he said that he couldn't risk being grounded for Halloween and left it at that. I can remember thinking it was a shame he couldn't be my right-hand man for this, but at the end of the day I didn't need him. By the late afternoon, kids were flocking to the streets. Groups of them marched in ghoulish uniform from door to door, demanding candy at every new residence. Of course, many came up the long driveway to my house. My father's money was clear to see from the size and state of my home, and the trick or treaters correctly assumed that this meant better candy would be dished out. My mother baked Halloween themed muffins for the little beggars, which she handed out warm at the door. Along with those came whole chocolate bars and bags of gummies. One trip to our front door gave them the same magnitude of treats as an hour spent patrolling the poor neighbourhoods, only for a fraction of the time. 

I left through my window clad in the dark trenchcoat, with the bag on my back containing all I'd need to execute my plan. I will admit, my plan was strikingly simple and revolved around jimmying an old back window open with a screwdriver. After a short walk, I left the grounds to my house and came out onto the street. It was bustling with children and parents, with some young teens starting to filter through. I tried to reminisce to when I was their age, but I really never went trick or treating. Not properly. I had no siblings and neither of my parents were present enough to chaperone me, or trusting enough to let me go off with friends. I was thinking about my wet blanket of a childhood as I made my way across town, eventually nearing the center and reaching the commercial district. I ambled down the slightly sloped sidewalk of main street, passing under the brilliant orange of the sugar maple whose leaves fluttered through the air like Chinese lanterns. 

Finally, I arrived at the entrance to Largo's Novelties. Kids still crowded the entrance, making off with last minute additions to their costumes. The numbers were already starting to thin and I had it on good authority that the store would close around nine. This was the same time as the Brookers’ party began, but I figured it'd only take a few minutes and being fashionably late was a necessity either way. I felt overly suspicious as I loitered around the street, walking up and down and ducking into stores now and then but never straying too far away from Largo's. Before an hour passed, the moon was out and the street was almost barren. The dull light emanating from under the now locked door of the mask store had switched off, and I knew the time to act was coming. I could hear the muted sounds of a street party coming from a few blocks over. I held my breath and crouched low, making my way across the road. I slid into the alleyway between Largo's and the adjacent dentist. I threw my bag down and took out my tools. 

I didn't think the mask I'd end up wearing that night would be a ski mask. I gripped it and pulled it over my face before grabbing the screwdriver. I left my backpack where it was and dragged one of the overflowing metal trashcans over to just under the small window. I mounted it and stood precariously on the lid. Thankfully it took my weight, and I reached up to stab the screwdriver into the old window frame. Before I did, I noticed something. The window was already open, just a little bit. The senile old man must've forgotten to close it. I smiled to myself at my luck and winched the window open as far as it could go, which wasn't very far. Putting the screwdriver back in my pocket, I grabbed the frame and heaved myself up. Slowly but surely, like a spelunker making their way through the bowels of the earth, I managed to edge myself in and through the opening. I landed in an embarrassing heap on the red carpeted floor, thankfully avoiding any of the many stands and displays. I got to my feet, brushed myself down and looked around. 

The smell of latex was oppressive. The countless monster masks filling every available surface looked eldritch monsters in the half-light. I took the small key-chain flashlight from my back pocket and lit up the darkness. I felt like a kid in a candy store, and had the sudden realisation that I could take anything I wanted. I smiled, but pushed that thought to the back of my mind. I was here for one thing, and I needed to grab it and get out. I was certain that old man Largo would've left the premises by now, but had no evidence for that assumption. I crept quietly towards the front desk, intent on snatching the red devil mask and leaving before I found out. Passing by a plastic skeleton holding out a tray one stacked with candy, I reached the store's counter. I shone the flashlight around and saw it - nothing. Where the mask had once been, a black wooden display bust now stood. I stared in confusion at it for some time as my brain attempted to work out where it could be. Moments before I turned to look through the storefront, I noticed it. There was a door, easily missed and painted the same shade of dull green and yellow as the walls around it behind the counter. Leaning over, I saw that it too was open just a crack now, and figured that it must be his workshop behind it. 

Just before I hopped the counter, it occurred to me that Largo might be working away in the room that laid beyond. I took extra care at being silent, a plan scuppered as soon as I landed on the other side and accidentally kicked over a small display cabinet. I stood and held my breath, waiting for the delirious old man to come running at me and for me to have to make a quick exit. An unknowable amount of time later I was still holding my breath and standing slightly crouched. It dawned on me that if anyone was around to hear me, they would've made themselves known. Confident once again in my solitude, I approached the door and nudged it open.

A dark staircase descending into the shadows was hidden behind it. I shone my small flashlight around, but the weak beam did nothing to illuminate the ever-present black. I looked around and, seeing no reason to turn back now, began my way down the staircase. The stone steps were covered in a thin layer of slime. I was forced to find some grip from the surrounding concrete walls as the damp cold struck me and sent a chill down my entire being. Shivering, I continued further. After a minute more of cautious steps, I arrived at the end, which took the form of an old wooden door. With a little voice in the folds of my mind screaming at me to go back, I reached for the clunky metal handle. It turned with a metallic groan and soon the door was thrown open.

Behind was a very dimly lit and stout room. More of a short passageway really, but with rugs thrown down and tables either side piled high with archaic books. I walked between them to the old, hand carved chair which was pulled in front of one particular book. All the others on that surface looked to have been hastily pushed to the side. I leaned over, shining my flashlight on its cover. It was worn and tattered, and I could only make out two of the words of its exceptionally long title. “Solomon” and “key”. I left the ancient thing where it was and carried on the next door, my curiosity now at a fever pitch. What is this place, I can remember thinking to myself. 
I reached the next door, identical to the last in all but quality. My hand grasped the cold metal but before I barged in, I decided to cup my ear to the door. I could clearly hear dampened noises coming from behind. I crouched low, took the handle and opened it just a crack. 

The room was small, almost cosy. Every surface was wooden and lit by candles. There was a similar clutter of books and other oddities giving a chaotic feel to the workshop. From the small crack of vision I had, I could see half made masks on carved busts scattered here and there. Immediately, I saw the source of the noise. Old man Largo was sitting at his workbench with his back to me. I held my breath for a brief second, before letting go when it dawned on me that the man's hearing was likely as bad as his vision. Squinting, I saw something else, something strange. Resting next to Largo on a wooden bust was yet another mask, this one looking identical to Largo himself. Beside the workbench, barely within my field of view, was a large, ornate mirror. The glass of the mirror was covered in countless small scratches, which I realised made up dozens of unrecognisable runes. Part of it was left unscratched, however, and from it I could see the reflection of part of the table behind Largo. On it rested the red devil mask. Certain that the feeble old man was preoccupied with his toil, I started to creak the door open further. My heart pounded in my chest as it opened wide enough for me to squeeze through. As I stepped through the gap, my loose shoelace betrayed me and I went tumbling forward, landing hard on the cobblestone floor. I stared at the ground for a second as I heard movement around me, too afraid and ashamed, mostly afraid, to look up. When I finally did, I immediately wished I hadn't.

For the first time, I saw Largo's colleague, who'd been sitting just out of view from the mirror. Its skin was a dark, shifting color, like an infected wound or large bruise. It was tall, much taller than me, and painfully emaciated. Its head was trapped within a featureless wood crate, a small saving grace during my moment of dread. Its right arm and two slender wings had been brutally broken before being chained together, and were now raised awkwardly in a clump next to its head. Only its left hand was free, which was apparently all it needed to create dozens of high quality masks that were piled up around it. I backed away from it in fear, straight into Largo. I turned, and for the first time saw how he really looks under his mask. 

His deformed face was further contorted by anger. He had no nose, left eye and was missing half of his upper jaw. The flesh around this devastating wound had been well-healed, and I knew then that it had been decades since it was inflicted. Still, seeing his once calm demeanor altered to this terrified me, and I started to back away. The two mask makers approached me as I turned back through the door. Suddenly, Largo yelped a command in his hoarse voice and his colleague began to move like a greyhound out of the trap. I ran, scampering up the stone steps on all fours as I felt adrenaline kick in. I could hear the colleague behind me giving chase, and the clatter as it fell every few seconds, allotting me just enough distance to reach the door before it did. I burst into the darkness of the store and dived to the floor, crawling under what I assumed was a display table. I curled into a ball, tears and mucus streaming down my face. My breath caught in my mouth as heard thudding footsteps tear into the room just seconds behind me. I trapped the air in my lungs as I attempted to stay as silent as possible. The colleague slowed down as it stalked between the shelves and across the aisles. In the darkness, my mind did its worst in conjuring up an idea of how close it was to finding me, and what it'd do once it did. 

A second set of steps, slow and shambling, soon became audible. I was left helpless, only able to watch as a dull glow appeared from deep within the tunnel. Soon, it was near the mouth of the entrance and before long, Largo appeared at the door, bent double and panting. He held a flashlight in his hand. My mind was buzzing with ideas of escape, of quickly climbing out the window and running off into the night. But when the bright beam fell on me, I knew it was too late to act. I hadn't been brave enough. Largo wheezed again and his colleague came barreling towards me. A boney, slightly wet hand grasped my forearm and violently yanked me out from underneath the table. I attempted to plead, but I couldn't choke out a single word past my wailing. Largo left the flashlight down on a shelf, illuminating the scene as he shuffled behind me. He grasped my shoulders with strength beyond his years as his colleague moved its hand. Sharp fingernails of rusting metal dug into the base of my neck, its palm pressing against my chin. It broke the skin, and, in a split second, I felt more pain than I thought possible in a thousand lifetimes. 

With dark magic of surgical impossibility, my young skin separated from the flesh beneath, each nerve bisecting perfectly. The colleague tore upwards, tearing my face, and all the surrounding tissue of my head, from the skull. It held the new mask in its hand, curling its long fingers through my still-seeing eye sockets. The last thing I saw before the pain throttled my mind into unconsciousness was my body having a seizure on the floor, its entire head now red with blood and exposed flesh. I remained unconscious for an unknowable amount of time, and when I woke I was surrounded by darkness. I could not feel, I could not hear. All I could do was see and think. This nothingness continued for days, for weeks, for months. By the time the lid was slid from my cardboard tomb, I had lost both the track of time and my mind. My vision blurred at the sudden attack of light, but soon focused on the figure standing above me. It was Largo. 

He picked me up and brushed me down, before placing me over a wooden stand and propping me up on a shelf. I remained there for the entire Halloween season, as no one wanted to buy the mask of a horribly contorted, screaming teenage boy. This became the annual ritual that dominated my life from that day forward, if you could call it a life. Years were planned around my few weeks of freedom. All I knew was Halloween, as the only alternative was storage. The season before the great darkness, I saw someone familiar. Tyler came in with his young son and took him around Largo's store. I begged for him to notice me, but even when he stood directly in front of me and stared into where my eyes once were, I didn't see a shred of recognition. I had been forgotten. 

The great darkness, I have just found out, was a coronavirus pandemic. Largo's Novelties closed, and did not reopen until earlier this year. Masses of people flooded in, descending on the store like locust. In its absence, local legends grew around its quality and created another generation of eager customers, none of whom seemed to question Largo's comparatively youthful appearance. One young boy of around seven or eight waddled up to me and took me down from my stand. He carried me dutifully to his father, specifically to his father's wallet. Tyler put me on the counter and bought me for a 30% discount. This happened earlier on in the day, and when Tyler drove home, he put the mask on, as requested by his son, to show it off. In the instant it covered his face, he experienced total brain death. For the first time in seventeen years, my broken consciousness had a body. I collapsed but staggered back to my feet again, remembering to put one in front of the other. His widow and son screamed their concern as I staggered like a dying man up the stairs. I found their bathroom, and locked myself inside. That's where I am now, having written this out on Tyler's unlocked phone. If anyone's reading this, please, when you see Largo's Novelties burning to the ground tonight, don't call for [help](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/ZskZo0TC7j).
