(Pls, understand the first two parts are not going to be explicitly supernatural just yet. But soon I'll get there. I'm sorry if it feels like this is a slow burn or you're not getting what you want. But I can assure you spooky stuff is coming in the future)

The year is 1945. It's been months after Normandy. And now of all times he could've. Earl began regretting his decision to join the Army. His age has been getting to him, his joints hurt like hell, his back is killing him, and he's been finding himself longing to back in time to the first war.. So he can beat himself out of going to the military. He looked around at the Young men around him, so cheery and bright. Dispite the hardships of war. Somehow their now Morbid sense of humor, and hopefull smiles prevailed. 

???: Sergeant! 

Earl looked to his right, and stopped when he saw the bright new olive green pants and Jacket. The Replacement for John, has arrived. Earl tiredly look up at the Recruits face

Earl: Private.. 

He stood up, his knees popping and back aching. The Private stood at attention, Waiting for The grizzled Sargeant to say something.

Earl: I don't need to know your name... So don't tell me. Welcome to the Bloody first Son, we'll hold you to a high standard. You think you can, adhere to our standards.

The Private: Yes sir! 

Earl: Good.. Now go to the tent and get the hell outta my face, it's on the trail left of the chow tent. 

The Private: Thank you Si- 

Earl: Don't fucking thank me private! Just get your orders and GO!! 

The Private books it Away.. and Earl stares after him.. he then sourly sat his old ass back down on the log he was just sitting on. 

Cut to the tent. 

Lemmy was cleaning his BAR when the Private Bursted into the tent out of breath. Lemmy smiled

Lemmy: Heh, heh... Get on Sarges Bad side did you? 

The Private nods 

The Private: all I did... W-was thank him.. 

Lemmy: He hates when people do that... I do to, if I'm being honest... I'm Corporal Lemmy bridger.. Sarge's 2nd. 

Lemmy finish cleaning his BAR. Then begins to put it back together. He stood up, revealing his Large Broad shoulderd Frame. The Private stepped back, intimidated by his Size

Lemmy: What? Never seen a Farm boy before? 

He chuckles and begins making sure all of his weapon's parts and elements are in working order. Just as Earl walked into the tent. 

Earl: Let's go, get your gear and get it on. We're moving out of here soon. 

Lemmy: Yes sir! 

He goes over to his bunk and begins to quickly put on his dirty and battered olive green coat and worn suspenders, he grabs his Ammo bag and Bandolier and puts them on as quickly as he can. He then puts a mag in his BAR and heads out side. The Private followed behind, like he was glued to Lemmy. They made their way to the center of the camp where Earl waited for them. Lemmy got there first, and asked.

Lemmy: What's going on? 

Earl: we're being sent on a rescue mission... A Paratrooper with vital info on enemy encampments Is pinned down. He was able to get to us through a capture enemy radio.. which lead them to his position. 

Lemmy: shit... You know, that's one of the reasons why I never became a paratrooper. Being stuck behind enemy lines with no help..

Earl: yeah.. We know. Now come on, the General wants us.
