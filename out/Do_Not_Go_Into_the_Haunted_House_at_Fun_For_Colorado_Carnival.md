**I’m not a coward.**  
I don’t say this to brag or stroke my ego—I just think I’m generally good at keeping my cool. But what happened to me a few months ago at a carnival in my town… it hasn’t left my mind since.

**Fun For Colorado Carnival** 

My hometown isn’t a big place. Apart from a couple of local bars, there’s not much for young people to do. So when we heard that a huge carnival—big enough to make the local papers—was coming through, everyone was excited. My friend Alisha and I were no exception. We’d been planning to go for weeks. We both love adrenaline, though she’s way more of a thrill-seeker than me. She’s into extreme sports I can’t even pronounce, let alone try.

That night, she dragged me onto every insane ride the carnival had to offer—the giant octopus arms, the roller coasters, the kamikaze, the weird swinging chairs. I went along with her, my stomach in my throat the whole time.

But this carnival had one more strange detail: after every ride, someone in an orange “Fun For Colorado” shirt, with the carnival’s teddy bear logo on it, would come up to you and ask for feedback. They’d jot it down like it was a survey. I avoided them as much as I could, but Alisha answered every question with detailed suggestions like she was on a mission to improve the place.

By the time we were done with the last ride, my head was pounding and my stomach was sick. The flashing lights that had seemed magical at first now burned my eyes. I told Alisha I wanted to leave. She still had energy to burn, but when she saw how pale I was, she agreed—though she had one last idea.

“Let’s just do the haunted house. One last thing, okay?”

Every part of me wanted to say no. But she looked so excited that I couldn’t bring myself to ruin it. We walked to a far corner of the carnival where a building sat oddly alone. It was decorated with neon green lights and had a big dinosaur statue on the roof.

“You sure this is even open?” I asked.

“Of course. Look, there’s a worker right there.”

Sure enough, one of the orange-shirted guys was at the exit, scribbling in a notebook. I still thought it was strange how isolated this ride was.

“Tyler,” Alisha smirked, “you’re not scared, are you?”

My pride got the better of me. “Me? Scared? Bet you scream more than I do in there.”

She laughed, tossed two tickets into the machine, and we walked in.

The place smelled like cheap plastic. It was all dark rooms, fake screams playing from speakers, skeletons popping out of the walls. Honestly? It was lame. The only thing that really got to me was the mist machine—it hissed loudly and would suddenly fill the hallway with smoke, making me jump. Alisha, of course, laughed at every single thing.

But near the end, I turned around and realized… she wasn’t there anymore.

“Alisha?” I called.

“Tyler, you’ve gotta see this!”

Her voice came from a side room. I stepped inside and found her fascinated by a crystal ball. The room looked like a cheap witchcraft shop—spell books, brooms, Ouija boards, dusty props with little information cards beside them.

I barely glanced at the stuff. They were probably just props from the imagination of whoever made this place. At least, that's what I guessed, because a card  on a leather-bound book I picked up said the pages were made of human skin. That alone was enough to make me queasy again, so I turned away—only to notice a narrow opening in the wall. It wasn’t more than a meter wide, pitch dark beyond it.

Alisha was still flipping through the creepy book, so I told myself not to be a coward and stepped inside.

The first thing I noticed was the cold. It was freezing in there, damp and musty. Dim neon lights flickered along the floor, not enough to see by. I reached for my phone flashlight, but… it was dead. Completely drained. I swore it had been fully charged when I left home.

Then I heard it.

*Pat.*

A thud that echoed through the little room. I spun around. The gap I’d come through—was closed. Sealed shut.

I forced a laugh. “Ha-ha, very funny, Alisha. Open the door now.”

I pounded on the wall, but it was solid, like there had never been an opening. My chest tightened.

“Alisha, seriously, enough. Open the door.”

No response.

And then, from behind me… a soft sound.

A woman sobbing.

I froze. It wasn’t part of the carnival soundtrack. It was real. I could hear her choking back tears in the corner.

“Hello?” I whispered.

The crying stopped. Slowly, I saw her—crouched on the floor, hair covering her face. The flickering lights caught her shape, hunched and trembling.

At first, I thought: *It’s just another actor.*

But when she stood up, I knew she wasn’t. Her back was arched, her arms dangling low, her dress shredded like she’d been mauled by an animal. Every time the light flickered, her silhouette looked more inhuman.

I stepped back without meaning to. She turned her head slightly, and a horrible, rattling moan slipped from her throat—as if she was choking on her own screams.

Then she faced me fully. Her forehead bulged unnaturally. Her hair hung in filthy clumps. And when she spoke, the words scraped the air:

“**Have you seen my daughter?**”

The stench hit me—the same moldy, rotten smell I’d noticed when I first entered. Her eyes were a dead, milky white. Her teeth were blackened, broken. And she was close enough now that her icy breath hit my face.

Suddenly she grabbed my shoulders. Her hands were like blocks of ice, her nails digging into my skin.

“**Have you seen my daughter?**” she rasped again, harder this time.

"Let go, you're hurting me!"

I screamed at her, but her grip tightened until I thought my arms would snap.

“**Have you seen my daughter?**”

I don’t know why, but I answered. “I’m sorry. I haven’t.”

That didn’t stop her. Her jaw unhinged, her breath blasting me with rot. Her grip grew tighter, impossible for such a frail-looking body. Her nails pierced through my shirt and into my flesh.

“**Have you seen my daughter?**”

The last thing I remember was screaming for Alisha. Then… nothing.

When I came to, I was lying on the floor. Alone. No blood. No wounds. Just the flickering white lights. My arms, which I’d been certain were broken, were fine. Shaking, I scrambled to the wall—then I heard Alisha’s voice.

“Tyler? Are you in there?”

I begged her to open the door. A moment later, it swung open easily.

"Tyler, are you okay?"

"How did you open the door?"

“It wasn’t even locked,” she said.

I stumbled out into the light, barely able to stand. I tried to explain, but she just looked confused.

"Looks like the horror didn't agree with you," she said, her voice teasing.

"You don't understand, a woman in there almost tore my arms off!"

While I spoke, panting, her eyes darted into the room.

"No, wait, don't go in."

Despite my warning, she went inside, and a few minutes later, there was no sound. I stood up. I was still so affected by what happened that I thought the woman had done something to Alisha.

"Alisha?"

“I checked that whole room. There was no one in there, Tyler.”

“No,” I gasped. “There was a woman. She.. She kept asking if I’d seen her daughter.”

Alisha frowned but didn’t laugh at me this time. She sat beside me, serious now. “What exactly did she look like?”

I told her everything. Every detail. She went pale. But she still tried to rationalize it.

“Maybe you panicked. Maybe it was just an actor.”

As we walked toward the exit of the haunted house, I was almost starting to believe the whole thing was a performance. Alisha was good at making me feel better. I just swore to myself that I would never go in a haunted house again.

I almost convinced myself that’s all it had been. Almost.

When we stopped by the orange-shirted worker to give feedback, I couldn’t hold my tongue.

“That room with the crying woman,” I said. “That was terrifying. Seriously, the best part of the haunted house.”

The man stopped writing and looked at me strangely.

“I beg your pardon?”

“You know—the dark little side room. The woman kept asking if I’d seen her daughter. How did you make it so real?”

He exchanged a look with Alisha.

"Um... I think you're talking about the witches."

"No, the place with the small gap that connects to the room with the strange items near the end of the tunnel. There was a woman there in a white dress who was crying and kept asking, 'Have you seen my daughter?'

The man's cheerful face was now completely blank. He looked confused.

"Are you a prank show crew or something?"

Alisha interjected.

"Why would you say that?"

“We don’t… have anything like that in there. That passage does exist, yes, but it just leads to an empty storage room.”

My stomach dropped.

Before I could protest, he cut me off. “We’re closing soon. Please make your way out with the other guests. And… have a fun year with Fun For Colorado.”

He rushed away like he couldn’t get rid of us fast enough.

Alisha tried to calm me down, insisting it was just an actor who hadn’t been logged yet. But I knew. I know what I saw. What I felt. Her grip. Her voice. That smell.

I tried to forget it. For a while, I did.

Until last month, when I was digging through old newspapers for a college project. That’s when I found it:

**“Tragic End for Grieving Mother.”**

Dorothy Herbert lost her daughter, Lily, at a carnival last year. After search efforts turned up nothing, Dorothy began traveling across states, determined to find her on her own. Last week, her body was discovered in the woods outside our town. Cause of death was believed to be an animal attack.

The article ended with one detail that froze me:  
Her body was found near the newly built “Fun For Colorado” carnival—the same place where Lily was last seen.
