Lila is the prettiest little girl you’ve ever seen. Frosty gray eyes flecked with ebony, curly brown hair, and the thickest, longest eyelashes. When she smiles, her eyes form little rainbow shapes, and dimples speck her cheeks.

(All names have been changed for privacy)

When she first called me “mommy”, my heart swelled with so much love and joy, I thought it might burst.

Every night, for as long as I can remember, I read her a bedtime story. She loves the one about the panda and the tiger. We’ve been reading that every day for the past two months. She never gets sick of it.

Recently, I had to go for an overseas work trip for 5 days. It broke my heart to leave my family. I know it’s a short time, and shouldn’t be a big deal, but I hadn’t taken a single trip without my family ever since Lila came into our lives 5 years ago.

It was heart wrenching saying goodbye to Lila. My husband promised he would take good care of her, and I believed him, he’s a great dad, but I couldn’t help but worry.

My husband texted me throughout the first day overseas, updating that Lila was happily distracted by a playdate and a new stuffed toy. She seemed to have forgotten about me, he joked.

Once I was done with a mind numbing slew of meetings, I hightailed it back to the hotel and hopped on a video call with my husband and Lila.

Lila was so happy to see me. She smiled and chatted happily about her new rabbit stuffed toy and her new friend. But after a while, she cried and asked when I would be home. I tried to cheer her up, and read her a story via the call, but she just got more upset and cried louder. She kept saying she wanted her mummy. We had to end the call so my husband could soothe her.

My heart sank when I realised that my video calls would only trigger her, remind her of my absence. With a heavy heart, I told my husband to monitor how things are, and let me know if a video call would be helpful or unhelpful the next night.

We did another video call the second night, to the same results. Tears, pleading, shouting. We agreed that I would just send her night night voice messages and to hold off on seeing her until I was home.

The third day, my husband kept me updated frequently, knowing how worried I get. We skipped the video call, and an hour after her bedtime, my husband told me that apparently, Lila had gone right to bed and fallen fast asleep. Part of me was relieved that she wasn’t having a hard time, another part of me felt hurt. I know, it’s dumb. She’s a child with a short attention span. It’s easy to forget about pesky things like your mum for a night.

The fourth day, my husband’s updates were a lot less regular. I figured he had his hands full juggling his work, household chores, and caring for Lila. He did say everything was fine, so I held onto that and busied myself with work. We both agreed to skip the video call that night as well.

The fifth night, right before I left the hotel to catch my red eye flight home, my husband video-called me. It was about an hour after Lila’s bedtime, so I figured maybe he had some trouble putting her to sleep. Maybe she wanted to see her mummy before she slept.

Excitedly, I swiped to answer the call, grinning ear to ear.

The sight of my husband’s pale face doused my grin. His black hair looked limp and unwashed, and his eyes were rimmed with dark circles that made his dark brown eyes look almost black.

“What’s wrong, love?” I asked. “Everything all right? Is Lila okay?”

“Do you hear that?” he asked.

“Hear what?”

He held a finger to his lips and mouthed, “listen.” Fear and exhaustion etched his face.

Dread churned my insides. I kept quiet, and tried to make out any sounds. I could only hear his breathing. And mine.

“Love, you’re scaring me. Where’s Lila?”

He looked defeated. “She’s okay. She’s asleep.”

“What was I supposed to hear?”

“Nothing, it’s not there now.”

“What’s not there now?” An edge sharpened my tone.

“The-” he broke off, and his eyes widened. “Listen,” he whispered, holding the phone close to his lips, so I could only see his nose and the lower half of his eyes.

I was about to tell him to knock it off, when I heard it.

Singing.

Someone was singing. It was a beautiful voice, sweet and gentle. Yet somehow, it sent chills stabbing through my spine.

“When the wind blows, the cradle will rock…” the faint notes wafted from somewhere to my husband’s side.

“It’s the child monitor,” he whispered. “I switched it on the last couple of nights. Someone’s been singing to our daughter.”

“Oh my god, get to her, now! Go!” I yelled, and he pulled out one side of his earpiece.

“I’ve tried,” he whispered urgently, cutting me off. “Last night, and just now, I ran in every time. There’s no one in there with her.” He sounded hollow.

“I don’t give a damn. You get in there right now. Protect our little girl. Now!”

He stood up, and walked to Lila’s room. I wanted to smack him, to tell him to run.

He hesitated before pushing open the door, and I hissed in his ear.

I could still hear the singing, and made out the words, “No one’s as dear as baby to me…”

The door swung open, and my husband stepped in the room.

He held his phone out so I could see. The room was dark, but Lila’s night light was on. There was no one there. Lila was asleep in her little tatami bed, a small smile on her face.

The singing had stopped once he entered. There was only the sound of Lila’s gentle snoring.

He backed out of the room and shut the door.

“You see?” he whispered, walking back to the living room. “No one. There’s no one there.”

“Did you check the windows?” I asked. I knew there couldn’t have been time for anyone to climb out of the room. Still, I had to be sure.

“They are locked, grilled, as usual. No one was in the cupboards too, last night I checked.”

I felt a cold vice tighten around my neck. I hadn’t thought of checking the cupboards.

“Check it again, now!” I commanded.

He sighed and went back in.

He opened the cupboards, nothing. “It’s really cold here,” he said quietly.

He looked everywhere, and I supervised, pointing out possible nooks and crannies. Nothing. He showed me that the window was still locked.

When he went out to the living room, we were both quiet for a while.

“I’ve got to go. I gotta catch that plane, fly home to you guys. Take care of Lila. Just sit by her bed, sleep in her room, all right?”

He nodded, and a touch of relief lit his eyes.

“I can’t wait to have you back,” he said.

The four hours on the flight were torturous. I spent the time researching online to see what I could find. For the first time, I splurged on the plane’s WiFi service.

Everything seemed to point to spirits. But that made no sense. We had been living in our house for a decade, long before Lila’s arrival. Nothing like that had ever happened in our house.

What was singing to my daughter? The thought hammered away in my mind. My chest squeezed painfully, and cold sweat began to seep from my forehead and hands.

“Are you okay?” The lady next to me asked. I looked blankly at her, then excused myself to the bathroom on board.

My reflection startled me. My jet black hair was in a wild tangle. My hair claw must have loosened in my mad sprint to the taxi and from the taxi to the departure gate. I had no reason to run, it was not like the flight could take off earlier, but I ran anyway.

I redid my hair and stared at myself in the mirror. Calm the fuck down, I instructed myself, staring into my dark brown eyes. I took a few long, deep breaths, then returned to my seat.

My husband had sent me a short video. I clicked on it, but it took forever to download on the plane’s shitty WiFi. I had to restart the download multiple times.

“Can’t see vid. Text?” I sent to my husband.

No response. I kept clicking on the download button, hoping that the WiFi would be stable enough for the video to go through. It was a relatively small file, so I had hope.

The video loaded. I tapped on it multiple times, legs shaking with impatience.

It was an 8 second video. It showed darkness, then the vague lines of Lila’s room took shape.

Singing. “Over the cradle, mother will sing…” My chest tightened painfully. The view shifted to Lila’s face. She was awake, staring at something above her.

“Mama?” her cute little voice sounded. My heart sank. The video cut off.

I nearly screamed.

It finally hit me, what could be singing to my daughter.

My heart in my throat, I typed in a name I had forgotten about for the past years, but will always remember.

“Hailey Boden”. Lila’s birth mother.

It was a semi-open adoption. I knew who the girl was, met her once, but never again. She never contacted me, and neither did my husband and I want to contact her. We would only let Lila know of her if ever she expressed the desire to know her biological mother. A selfish part of me wanted to be the only mother Lila knew.

Hailey was a drug addict. She had stopped using, for the most part, during her pregnancy. Her family had wanted her to abort the baby, so she moved out to a shelter for young mums.

My heart ached for her when we met. A petite, skinny 17-year-old with a belly that looked grotesquely large on her small frame. Her eyes were set in deep hollows, and her cheeks were deathly gaunt.

Still, there had been something beautifully innocent in her lovely grey eyes. She spoke in a child-like way, which I guess she still was, in a way. She wanted her little girl to have a good life. One unencumbered by her. I cried when she said that. It ripped my heart open to witness the love this girl had for her unborn daughter.  There was a naivete in her actions and words that made me grieve for her circumstances. A sweet young mother-to-be, accepting separation from her daughter before she was born. All over damn drugs.

I wished Hailey well, told her that if she needed help staying clean, she could come to us. I gave her my email on a slip of paper. My husband jabbed me sharply in the arm then.

Hailey never did reach out. We didn’t see her again, only had Lila handed to us by the adoption agency.

I had no idea what had happened to Hailey.

I tapped the Enter button, and the results took a few seconds to load.

I didn’t have to scroll long before I found it. 22-year-old Hailey Boden, dead from a drug overdose. Her body had been found tossed out on the streets.

She had died just three months ago. My heart sank, and a hollow blossomed within my chest. Hailey was dead.

I should have reached out. I should have offered help. Shown some compassion for Lila’s biological mother.

I read all the articles I could find about Hailey. There were few. From what I could gather, she had left home six months before her death, after a huge fight with her parents. They were sick of her drug habits. She had to clean up, or get out. She got out.

Why didn’t she reach out? I would have helped.

Something clicked in my mind, and I went to my email. I typed in ‘Hailey’ in the search box. Nothing. I breathed a sigh of relief.

Then I tensed up again. I went to my spam folder and typed in the same search term.

There it was. An email from Hailey.

“Hi Joanne,

Hailey here. I have no right to ask you for help, but I’m in a really bad spot. I don’t need much, just a place to stay. Or just to see Lila once. Seeing her would mean so much to me. It would be the motivation I need to get clean. I won’t tell her I’m her mother. I just want to give her a hug, talk to her, sing to her. Please, Joanne. I have no right, but I beg you. I need to see my daughter.

Love, Hailey.”

A warm sour sensation welled up in my eyes. She had reached out. And I had missed it. She needed help, and no one gave it. Tears spilled over, streaking my cheeks with guilt.

I froze as I reread the message. Sing to her.

A wave of nausea swept over me. She was back. Singing to Lila. Did she want to take Lila from us? Did she want payback for my failure to help? Despite what I told her those years ago?

I’ve been quietly losing my mind. I’ve another 20 minutes to go before touchdown. My husband has not been responding to my frantic messages.

What is going on? Is it really Hailey, singing to my baby girl? Is she going to take Lila from us? Am I losing my mind?

What if it’s something else? Not Hailey, but something else?

19 more minutes.

I’m crawling out of my skin. I can’t take this.

No. Nonono. My husband just texted. “It won’t stop singing.”

Fuck.

The plane’s finally descending. I’m sending this out, and I’m making a run for it once I land.

Oh god. I can’t lose Lila. I can’t.
