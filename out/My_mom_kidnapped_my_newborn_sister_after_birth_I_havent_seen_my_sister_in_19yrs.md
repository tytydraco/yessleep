A little context, I am the eldest of 6 kids my mom had, she had custody taken from her every time cause she was a really shitty mom and a human being; in this time line my younger 2 sisters were not born yet. When this happened, I believe I was 12 years old, my grandma and I were just kicked out of our home and I went to live with my grandma’s friend, she had this girl around the same age as me living there and we got along great, her dad would come around quite often and he made me really uncomfortable. One day I was home alone and he came peaking in the windows trying to get inside, so I called my mom saying I was scared begging to come live with her. 

She was living at a women’s shelter at the time with my newborn sister, she wasn’t supposed to take anymore people in but given the circumstances it was allowed. I was so excited, I had never had the chance to grow up with my brothers or spend time and bond with them as babies, and it was the first time my mom had custody of me since I was first born. I was ecstatic at first, she played the mom role for a little while but It turned sour really fast. I had become the main caretaker for my sister, it didn’t even occur to me to be bothered by it though, I loved her and I always was a natural with babies, however I couldn’t understand why my mom wouldn’t do her part.

I was in 6th grade in school, and I felt like a full time nanny, even as simple as going to sleep was a luxury I couldn’t have. All my mom did was webcam her boyfriend or have me take slutty photos of her for him on a disposable camera, this guy ends up being the dead beat father to my younger 2 sisters; she would shut the door and let her scream bloody murder. Many times I got up to try and rock her to sleep, feed her, or console her, I knew babies cried but there was something really wrong here and I was feeling so overwhelmed. I felt responsible.

Let me tell you… my newborn baby sister, the epitome of pure innocence was having withdrawals from cocaine. This evil woman did drugs and drank in ALL of her pregnancies, all of my siblings have FASD, I’ve never been tested and I don’t want to be, I’m 30 years old now and I’m doing just fine. When she gave birth to this sister, they found crack cocaine in her placenta, they needed to keep the baby for testing, to help her, my god really anything but she took off after with her to the shelter, fabricating the story of hiding from an abuser. 

One day, I came home from school, I had a driver drop me off and pick me up (I can’t remember why), and building manager let me in, i gets inside and my mom and sister were not there, we were “supposedly” hiding from her baby daddy when really we were hiding from the cops and child welfare. I thought to myself oh my god “he” has them. I was terrified and called 911, I was scared to talk when the operator answered, when I did I got absolutely berated by the operator for being home alone like it was my fault, she threatened to put me in a foster home again if I don’t find an adult, I’m crying and begging her not too and she continues to scream well then you better find an adult!!! 

I run outside, not even realizing the door latches behind me and I’m in the heart of downtown all alone, a cab shows up shortly after and my mom opens the side door where I see her new boyfriend holding my sister. They take us to a west ed hotel for multiple days, all I have to eat while I’m there is liquorice and chips from a vending machine, meanwhile they are doing drugs in the bathroom, and having sx in front of us. Eventually my mom calls home to check the messages, and the cops kept calling over and over. She thought it was about her warrants. I seen the panic in her face and thought it was all my fault, I knew what was coming. 

My sister and I are put in the foster a system not long after, separately. I got to have visits with her for a little while after I got out, I got to see her get healthy and see her smile for the first time, and then they just stopped. She was adopted into a nice family I hear, she has a dad and a sister and her mom passed on, but she doesn’t want to know her biological family. Honestly I don’t even blame her I wouldn’t want to either, I prayed to stay in my last home cause it was the first time I was ever really really happy, I didn’t need to take care of myself or anyone else and could just focus on being a kid. This was about 19 years ago. 

I have baby pictures of her still and it breaks my heart I will never get to see what she looks like now or ever get to meet her and see the woman she’s become. Mom screwed off to B.C. with her lover after we were taken, had 2 more babies, left dumbass to come back home and babies were instantly taken again. I was terrified to get close to them, but I did and I tried to help fight to get them back but she gave up so I did too, but on her. I went no contact with her for around a decade, I went to see her on her death bed, some days I think this was a mistake, I was able to give her peace to move on but I never did. She died the next day on my birthday STILL believing she did nothing wrong, believing she was the victim. I don’t ever like to refer to myself as a victim but in the case of what she did to me, I absolutely am. I was SA twice before my 3rd birthday because of her. My life is like a true crime podcast.
