I think something most people can relate to is the odd paranoia of sleeping at a grandparent’s house in the middle of nowhere. The nights are so quiet and eerie… it always feels like something is watching you just outside of your field of vision…. but close enough for you to see some movement in the peripheral. 

When I was a kid, I used to frequent my grandparent’s house on a large wooded estate in some rural mountains. There were always stories that a man had died in that house, but who knows if that’s even true. These days I don’t remember much about those nights but I do remember always seeing some being outside the door to the room I would sleep in. It would sit on the roof and look in from the top of the doorframe. It would just sit there and watch. It would be gone by sunrise, but there would always be mysterious puddle of liquid where it hung.

For the longest time, I convinced myself it was just childish superstitions… nothing more than my younger brain making me see things. Recently however I got the chance to revisit the old house, and those memories of that thing just pried at my mind. My grandparents both died years ago, and their house was simply left to rot away. I was passing through that area and decided to stop in the little town nearby to relive some childhood memories. Fuck, I wish I just kept driving.

I used to head into the town with my grandparents just to look around, grab something to eat from the local diner at the corner. There wasn’t much to do but it was quaint and I enjoyed it. Driving through the town now, though, everything just seemed so off. There was a strange whistle as the cold wind blew through the town, lifting up the snow on the sidewalk. The old diner had closed down and was left abandoned on the corner. There weren’t many people walking around the main road, which was odd considering that place used to be quite busy this time of day. But it had been years since I visited, maybe people just moved away. I don’t exactly blame them. Like I said, the town was quaint and generally felt disconnected from the world. Some found it peaceful, others lonely.

I took one of the backroads leading towards the house. The sun was setting at this point, the dense forest on either side of the road was getting darker and colder by the minute. On the side of the road was a ripped open deer. It had been freshly killed, I guess nature never sleeps. It was about here I got a strange chill through my entire body. It felt like tons of tiny pinpricks were stabbing me across my entire body. I started to see eyes in the trees and heard whispers in the wind. I started shaking, despite the fact the inside of my car wasn’t even cold. I considered turning around, which in retrospect was what I should’ve done. But I felt something pulling me back to that house.

I pulled into the long winding driveway and slowly made my way up to the front of the house. It was in shambles. Parts of the roof had fallen in, some of the windows seemed broken into, the door was ripped off its hinges in an unnatural way. *What the hell?* I thought. Had someone robbed this place at some point? 

I stepped out of my car, and the frost whipped my skin, the cold dark felt ever encroaching. I could barely see 25 feet in front of me, the only source of light being my dim car headlights. Those went out and I was left in a freezing blackness that consumed me. I heard voices in the trees all around me, beckoning me toward them. I switched on my flashlight and started to walk up to the house.

The porch creaked with every step. There were tons of holes in it, and familiar claw marks were all over at and the broken door. My heart stopped. Was there some animal inside? Whatever it was, it had to be long dead by now. The house was silent except for my paranoid breathing. I took my time looking around, after all, there were plenty of memories to be reminisced on. 

I would cook with my grandma in the kitchen. I was never too good at it, but I was young and nothing really mattered yet. My grandpa would show me his hunting rifles in his trophy room. Stuffed deer heads lined the walls. Back then, they were all marks of a great huntsman. Now? They just felt creepy, their dead beady eyes staring into me. 

A noise. From the kitchen. The hairs on my neck stood up. Something was *inside* the house with me. I picked up one of the old guns and prayed to God it still worked. I slowly peeked around the corner of the doorway staring into the abyss of the darkened kitchen. I couldn’t see much, but it was impossible to discern actual movement from anxious mind tricks. 

I closed the door and waited in the trophy room a bit. *Footsteps* I put my ear up to the door. They were right outside it. My heart dropped and I could feel it pounding in my throat. A sweat broke out on my forehead. They came up to the door, and then slowly trailed off into the distance. I waited a good 15 minutes just listening to the silence to make sure the coast was clear. Someone or something was definitely inside with me. I finally gathered up the courage to peek through the crack in the door.

Nothing. At least as far as I could tell. I slowly creeped out into the main room, shotgun pointed out directly in front of me. At this point my heart was pounding inhumanly fast. My entire body was shaking, due to the cold or the fear, I wasn’t sure. I should’ve left then, but I had to check one last thing before I left. Either way, it seemed like whatever was inside had left. I couldn’t hear any noises anywhere in the house. 

I came to the stairs leading up to the second floor. I had to look in the room I used to sleep in one last time, just for nostalgia’s sake. I still had the shotgun in my hands, although I relaxed a little now. There were only three rooms on the second floor. My grandparents’ bedroom, the guest bedroom where I stayed, and the upstairs bathroom. I didn’t care much to look anywhere else but the guest room. I had spent so many nights there, the room had been ingrained into memory. 

As I began to step over towards it, I heard another step above me, in the attic. My heart started beating again, my skin was littered with goosebumps. I had to check. I pulled down the old ladder, and slowly made my way up it. I stared into the darkness of the attic. I couldn’t see my hands in front of face. But I could hear something. Not 30 feet from me, something was eating something. I heard bones crunching and flesh being torn. I turned on the flashlight and pointed it towards the sound. *Holy shit!*

There, now staring directly at me, was whatever creature I used to see those late nights when I was a kid. It was completely real and physical. It was a bony humanoid creature, its eyes were a piercing white, its skin a disgusting pale, and its teeth rotting and razor sharp. Blood dripped from its mouth, and I saw it was eating a dead deer corpse. It let out a nauseating screech that caused me to fall down from the ladder. If it hadn’t been for how panicked I was, it might’ve got me. I screamed and scrambled back to my feet, I ran and tried to shoot the thing. The damn gum didn’t even work. I ran to the only place I could think to stay: the guest room. I ran inside, the door fallen off its hinges. I got a second to catch my breath, and realized I had no idea where that thing was. My mind was racing, my body was violently shaking. 

I tried to think off where it could’ve gone, then I remembered how it used to sit on the ceiling. I peeked up at the ceiling and sure enough it sat, claws sank into the roof, just waiting. It wasn’t able to come into the room. I tried to possibly think why, but I couldn’t come up with anything at the moment. I couldn’t walk outside the room. I couldn’t jump out the window, lest I wanted to risk an injury from the second floor. Plus that thing would probably run out after me. 

I looked around for something to use. There was nothing there. I opened the closet, and I screamed as a corpse fell out from the closet. It was rotten and old, and I vomited on the spot. This was person who had died here years ago, probably because of the creature. And this was why, I assumed, the creature couldn’t climb into the room. His corpse held a small vial of an unknown substance. It looked like some kind of powder or incense, some strange concoction that kept that thing away. 

It made sense to me now why that creature never entered all those years ago. That man’s body was always in the closet, I just never bothered to look inside. My shaky hand picked up the vial and sprinkled some out into the hall. The creature screeched again, causing me a pounding headache. This stuff kept it out, and that’s all I needed to know.

I’ve now been sitting in this room for 2 hours. That thing hasn’t left, no matter how much of the incense I sprinkle out into the hall. The dead corpse is still rotting next to me, and I’m still freezing in the darkness. I don’t know what to do, I’m going to have to leave eventually. But I don’t want to become the thing that’s the source of the liquid dripping from the ceiling.
