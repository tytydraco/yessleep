So, before I tell you what happened I'm gonna give you a bit of background on myself.

I'm a science kind of person, everything can be explained with science. I don't believe in paranormal stuff, and I'm not religious.

Every time someone asks me "do you believe in ghosts?" My answer is always "I don't believe in ghosts....although there was this one time...." And this is the story about that time that still to this day makes me question what I really believe into.

Around 3 years ago. August had just started. Me and a good friend of mine had just finished a night at the disco near the beach. It was really late night, around 2/3 am. From the disco to the town we lived in there was a 40 mins drive. Problem was: that week the highway that would get us straight home was closed for roadworks, so we had to drive till the town before ours and then use a countryside road to get there. My friend also wanted cigs so we stopped by an automatic vending machine and she got them. Then, seeing as the vending machine is near a shortcut i know pretty well, I point out that instead of going through the country road we could use the road that goes through the woods. It's basically a really narrow road that goes up a hill and into the woods, then comes out in the other side of the hill, right near our homes. It's just a small gravel path that can barely fit two cars, and if you encounter someone coming from the opposite way you have to drive a bit off road to let them pass. It's a route I'm extremely familiar with, I've done that hundreds of times cause when there is traffic it ends up being faster, plus driving relaxes me, even more so when it's in the middle of nature. So, we agreed on going this way. I drove for a bit, and as expected there is absolutely nobody around, my window was a bit lowered so the fresh summer air could get in. At some point there was a U turn. The road went to my left, and since on my left there was the hill, I couldn't see what was on the other side of it. I turned and stopped the car right away. 

In the middle of the road, in front of us, there was an old lady on an Italian Vespa. The classic, red, vintage Vespa. I love that kind of Vespa and I swear I had never seen one of those in the nearby towns, they are a rare sight these days, not many people have those anymore. I would have remembered seeing one of those. 

This lady was just sitting on her turned off scooter, in the damn exact middle of the road, staring blankly in the woods behind us. I waited for a bunch of seconds, expecting her to move to the side of the road. She didn't, in fact she didn't even move a muscle. I honked the horn at her, nothing. "Are you seeing this too?" I asked my friend. She just answered "Please go". i've gone through it a thousand times in my head, I looked at the lady's face for a few moments but I legit can't remember ANYTHING at all, it's like if I think about her face it's blurred. Only thing I can remember is that she was wearing an open helmet. 

Now, I'm someone that rarely gets scared, I've walked home through bad alleys at night, I drove through floods, got into a few accidents....but the fear I felt right there and then was the realest one I ever felt. Chills ran up my entire body, I understood the meaning of "blood freezing in my veins" I never felt so damn cold, and it was summer. For the first time ever my fight or flee instinct kicked in, every part of me was screaming "get the hell out of here, even if that means running her over". I couldn't even hear what my friend was saying, my ears just stopped working. I gathered what bit of reason I still had left and drove beside her to try and be on our way.

As I was passing by her, she didn't move at all, again. Normally I would help someone in need, in a situation like this I would roll my window down and say something like "excuse me miss, do you need help?". This time I just couldn't, again my body was just screaming "GET AWAY GET AWAY GET AWAY". So I just rolled up the window and drove. As she was just outside my window I couldn't get myself to look at her. I was scared of what I could have seen. I just kept looking in front of me and drove, and as soon as she was behind us I got the hell away from that as fast as I could. I didn't look behind at all. "Are you good?" I asked my friend "Sorry, I was just paralyzed by fear, didn't know what to do or tell you" she said. Not another word till we got home, she also wanted me to walk to her door with her. 

I told this to my family and the only logical things they can think of are: 

1)this lady was someone escaped from a mental hospital or something. But there are none around
2) she was meeting up with a lover in the woods. And yes, I know old people can have lovers, but meeting them in the woods at 3 am, really?

I'll add this: the two of us were not drunk. Knowing I had to drive home I only drank a coke and she hates alcohol. We weren't high. I only ever smoked a joint once it was years earlier.
