This is going to sound like a scam post, or a cyberpunk novella knockoff. It's not. I’m not here to sell you a device or a detox tea or some reality-fucking app. I’m here to confess.

I sold my nightmares.

Literally. Digitally. Legally, if you squint.

They said it was safe.

They were wrong.

My name’s Rhys. I’m thirty-seven. Still got college debt I’ll die with. I live in an apartment that smells like old electronics and synthetic lemon. I work at a remote content moderation farm for a platform I’m contractually barred from naming.

Stress dreams are part of the package. But mine were different.

They weren’t dreams. They were *episodes*. Whole sequences; lucid, vivid, cinematic. Like someone else’s trauma playing on a loop inside my skull. Always ending the same way: a hallway that should lead outside bends down instead. Lights go red. And there’s *him -* tall, featureless, palms facing backwards, watching me from the far end of the hall.

Every night.

I couldn’t sleep. Couldn’t eat. I drank like it was therapy.

And then I saw an ad.

I clicked.

It’s called **SomniPress™**.

Not technically legal in the U.S., but if you set your VPN to Nigeria and agree to fourteen pages of waivers, they’ll ship you a pod. It arrives in a nondescript black case. Looks like a sleep apnea machine mated with an alien artifact. Slick. Clinical. Smells like cinnamon and static.

You plug it in. Slide the thin neural mesh under your scalp. Lay down. And it *pulls*. That’s all.

When I woke up, I felt lighter. There was a short survey: *Did your nightmare contain doors, water, or ritualistic patterns?* Then a payout notice: $2,000 direct to my account.

It felt like magic. Or a lobotomy. And I didn’t care which.

First night after the upload, I slept like a child.

Second night, I dreamed of *nothing*.

Third night… the hallway was back.

But this time, it wasn’t in my dream.

It was in my apartment.

I woke up to find my bedroom door gone. Just gone. A smooth, uninterrupted wall where it used to be.

I checked the rest of the apartment. Everything was… almost right. Subtly wrong. The kitchen light had five bulbs, not four. The fridge was humming in a new key. My toothbrush was facing the mirror.

I laughed. Thought it was stress. Or sleepwalking. Or maybe I’d finally cracked.

Then the TV turned on by itself.

It showed the hallway.

The same one. Red lights. Wrong angles. Him.

Watching.

Not in a file. Not a loop.

*Live.*

I contacted SomniPress.

No answer.

I tried the website. Domain expired.

I tried digging through the neural pod’s casing and found nothing but melted ports and copper thorns. It was *empty*. Like it had only ever existed long enough to *extract*.

I started dreaming again. But they weren’t *mine*.

I’d wake up with words I didn’t know in my mouth. Visions of other people’s trauma, rituals, deaths, births. I watched a man drown in concrete. I watched a woman give birth to a mouth. I watched myself watching myself watching myself.

And the hallway got closer.

I started sealing my windows.

Taping mirrors.

One night, I caught a glimpse of movement in the microwave door. I turned and there he was. Not in reflection. Just there. Inside my living room. Standing silently.

Palms still backwards.

Watching.

He didn’t move.

I blinked, and he was gone.

Then the others came.

Figures I’d never seen, but *recognized*. A boy with no face. A woman with too many arms. A thing made of arms. They weren’t real. But they *were*. They moved through corners, through breath, through *doubt*.

I think they were parts of other people’s nightmares. Ones I’d been paid to carry.

My brain isn’t mine anymore.

It’s a haunted fucking warehouse.

The hallway is here now. Permanent. It replaced my bathroom. Just stretches on. I tried walking it once. Got maybe forty steps in before I heard my own voice behind me say, *“We already did this.”*

I ran back. But the apartment was different again.

Now the lights flicker in Morse code. The walls sometimes bleed. My cat disappeared, but I still hear him purring *inside* the floorboards.

I sold five nightmares.

Five pieces of me.

And now they’re crawling back.

They know I sold them.

They know I profited.

And worst of all? They know I *deserved it*.

If anyone else has used SomniPress, contact me.

If your dreams feel thinner.

If your shadows feel heavier.

If you see the hallway...

...don’t walk toward it.

And whatever you do—

**don’t look back.**
