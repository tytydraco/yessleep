FIELD NOTE – DAY 0
Location: Aegean Air 2753, en route to İzmir, Turkey
Entry Logged: 06:42 GMT

I woke with a jolt when the plane bumped through turbulence—my notebook sliding off my lap, pen still tucked in the middle like a bookmark from a dream.

Window seat. Half-light of dawn. Somewhere over the Aegean.

I must’ve been dreaming of sand again—soft underfoot, warm and ancient. But there was something else. Something behind me. I turned, in the dream, but never saw—

Never mind.

I’m writing this because I want to remember how I felt right now. Right at the edge of something.

This is it.
The break.
The thing you chase in postdocs and pipe dreams.

My proposal—“The Shadow Lineage of Arsinoë IV and Post-Dynastic Subsanctum Burials”—was never supposed to go anywhere. But then that lidar scan came back. Something octagonal. Buried beneath the collapsed Roman layers near the Artemis site in Ephesus. Something that doesn’t match any floor plan or temple base from the era.

I said it might be a containment tomb. I said it might be her.

No one laughed. Not after the second scan.

Now I’m 32, caffeinated, and staring out the window, wondering if I’m about to become the first person to walk into a sealed Ptolemaic site since Howard Carter knelt at that sandstone door.

God. What if it really is her?

What if Arsinoë IV—the sister who fought Rome and lost her throne—was down there all along?

I don’t believe in omens.
But I had that dream again.
Chains, sand, something just out of sight.

Probably nerves. Probably nothing.

If this works—this changes everything.

More after the site briefing.

FIELD NOTE – DAY 10

We found it.

No fanfare. No trumpets. Just the slow hiss of a trowel against damp stone and the soft click of someone’s jaw going slack when the outline came clear.

An octagonal foundation, buried under layers of Roman reconstruction, exactly where the lidar said it might be. Not a cistern. Not a foundation base. A chamber. Or at least, the beginning of one. One of the Italian techs said something under his breath—"vecchio ma non nostro.” Old, but not ours.

The shape matches Hellenistic measurements, but the depth... the depth is what caught us off guard. What they thought was bedrock wasn’t. It was another layer. A false floor.

That skull in Rome? The one they tried to test in the 90s—claimed it was Arsinoë’s?

That wasn’t her. That was a chamber guard.
They didn’t dig deep enough.
They never opened the actual tomb.

For a moment, I imagined Carter again, chisel in hand, whispering, “Yes, wonderful things.” But unlike Tutankhamun, Arsinoë wasn’t embalmed in gold. She was a traitor in chains, paraded through Rome and executed in exile.

She was a Boudica, in a sense—just one history didn't bother to martyr.

There’s no official confirmation yet. The permit head wants to "verify alignment" and "conduct structural scans.” But we all know. You can feel it in the air. Thick and electric. Like the site is holding its breath.

I’ll admit, I basked in it a little too much. I gave the “theory confirmed” nod more times than necessary at lunch. Some of the senior team is already looking at me sideways. Dr. Tarkan made a joke about “Yank confidence” and I let it slide.

Let them dig Gobekli Tepe for the next five years and argue over megalith alignment.
This is where the narrative bends.
This is the tomb.

A few hours ago, we found something else—a relief panel, half buried in collapsed debris. It shows a young woman, arms extended. Her face is worn away, but the wrist shackles are still clear.

There’s a symbol carved beneath. We haven’t translated it yet, but it doesn’t match anything in the Greek or Egyptian lexicons. I can’t find it in Coptic either.

Might just be decorative.
Might not.

They’ve scheduled the formal breach tomorrow, after photogrammetry finishes the site grid.

I might not sleep tonight.
Not from nerves—
From a lifetime of waiting.

I insisted we open it by candlelight.

Dr. Tarkan rolled his eyes. Said something about "Indiana Jones syndrome." But I held my ground. Carter did it this way. Candle first. Let the shadows tell the truth before the floodlights bleach it sterile.

We removed the final barrier around 17:50—an outer wall of smooth-cut limestone, sealed with what might be early Roman mortar. When the last slab cracked open, the air hissed out like a sigh held too long. Old air. Dry. Bitter. Carried a faint scent of oils and ash.

The passage was narrow, almost coffin-sized, cut with geometric restraint—Greek symmetry, not Egyptian grandeur. The walls bore no hieroglyphs, no gods or fields of reeds. Instead, we saw etched staves—clean vertical lines, mathematical in proportion, wrapping the entrance like musical notation carved into stone.

I lit the candle.

The flame leaned backward as the pressure shifted. Then it steadied. I went in first.

The chamber opened wider after fifteen feet. Octagonal, as the scans hinted. But nothing could’ve prepared me for the stillness. Like we had stepped into a soundless place. The kind of quiet that has mass.

The walls were inlaid with marble reliefs, white on white, each depicting a young woman in various forms of captivity—being measured, bound, paraded, crowned, exiled. Always the same figure. Her face always turned away.

At the center stood a coffin carved from dark basalt, with Greek inscriptions flanked by lotus petals. The lid was seamless, like it had been fused shut. And behind it: a low dais, upon which rested a series of vessels—clay, not gold—each sealed with wax and a bronze clasp.

One had already cracked.

Inside, we found what looked like fine sand, black and glimmering like obsidian dust. No scent. No residue. Just a shiver when you stood near it.

And then… something strange.

A mirror. Or something like one. Tall, oblong, bronze-framed, resting against the far wall. The glass wasn’t reflective. It was opaque, like polished lead, but when I passed in front of it, I swear—for a second—my reflection blinked before I did.

I didn’t say anything. Not yet. Not until I can check the video feed.

We’ve closed the chamber temporarily. Tarkan wants to log samples, call in the preservation techs.

I asked for an hour. Just me and the space.

I sat beside the coffin. My candle flickered and made the carved shadows dance. I don’t know how long I sat there.

At some point, I thought I heard something behind me.
Not a voice. Not a footstep.
Just… breath.

Tomorrow we open the coffin.
God help me, I can’t wait.
God help me, I think I’m afraid.

We opened the coffin.

The basalt lid was heavier than expected. Took four of us with hoist assists and elbow grease. The seal wasn’t adhesive—it was mechanical, like it was fused via heat or pressure. When it finally gave, the lid slid back with a hollow scrape like stone against bone.

No sarcophagus.
No wrappings.
No body.

Only a bed of ash, pale gray, nearly weightless, mounded in the center. Embedded in the ash was a bronze funerary mask, face down. No eye holes. No mouth. Just a flat, smooth oval polished to a mirror finish on the back. It was cold.

And beneath the ash… something harder.

A spine. Human, or close to it. Bleached, bound together with fine wire like it had been reassembled. But no skull. No ribs. Just the vertebrae. Like someone had buried only a backbone, on purpose.

Elmas wanted to collect samples immediately. Tarkan said we’d wait—log everything, document first.

But it was Marinos who noticed the noise.

His camcorder was picking up a low, repeating hum. Barely audible. We didn’t hear it live—but it was clear through the headphones, like a chant with no language, rising and falling in rhythmic waves.

We ran diagnostics. No interference. No feedback.
He turned off the mic.
The hum continued.
He unplugged the mic.
The hum was still recording.

That’s when the lights dimmed.

Only for a moment—but I saw it. The shadows stretched the wrong way. Like the candlelight on day 10. Like something was moving in time but not in place.

I kept looking at the ash. At the shape it made. It wasn’t random.

It formed a curve, a helix—like a spinal coil, mirrored into the space around it. There were symbols etched into the edge of the coffin floor. Some Greek, some unreadable. None of them carved, though.

They were burned in.

Elmas took one look and left the room without a word. I think she was crying.

We sealed the lid again.
Too late, I think.
The temperature hasn’t stabilized since.

Marinos says he’s getting audio bleed when he plays back the footage. Voices he didn’t hear in the room. He’s gone quiet. Eyes bloodshot. Keeps scratching his wrists like something’s crawling under his skin.

Tarkan says it’s stress.
I say it’s a beginning.

If that was Arsinoë’s tomb…
It wasn’t her body they were protecting.

It was something else.
Something that remembers.

FIELD NOTE – DAY 13
Location: Quarantine Tent A, Dig Site Z-18 Perimeter

We lost Elmas.

Not gone, not missing. Just… not here anymore.

I found her in Tent A this morning. Sitting upright, legs folded under her, palms flat against her thighs. Eyes open. Not blinking. No response. No expression. Like someone turned off the part of her brain that understood she was a person.

Vitals are normal. No fever. No sign of stroke. But her gaze is wrong. Not unfocused—too focused. Like she’s looking through everything at something no one else can see.

She started humming. Low. Slow. Like the static from Marinos’ tape, but clearer. Like it has meaning.

We’ve sedated her. Moved her to a shade tent. Tarkan thinks it’s heat stroke, or stress. He’s clinging to protocol like it’s the only thing keeping him upright.

And Marinos? He won’t come near the tomb. Just stares at the main chamber entry, lips moving like he's praying. Sometimes I catch him tracing symbols in the dirt with his fingers—the same burned glyphs we found inside the coffin.

But that’s not what rattled me most today.

It was the document.

Folded inside a clay tube, hidden behind a collapsed section of wall near the outer alcove. Papyrus, Greek script, fragile but legible.

Rough translation follows. It appears to be a funerary decree, or maybe a last warning:

“Let it be sealed. Let none bear her name.
She who warred against blood and crown.
Let her bones remain broken, her ash unbound.
Let no tongue speak the name of the traitor,
For the daughter of the lighthouse does not forget.
She waits beneath.
Her silence is not peace.
It is the breath before storm.”

Near the bottom, in red ink or faded blood, scratched harshly and off-script:

ΑΡΣΙΝΟΗ. ΜΗ ΑΝΟΙΞΕΙΣ.
Arsinoë. Do not open.

There it is. Her name. The first time it’s appeared anywhere on-site. Not on the coffin. Not on the walls. Only here. And even this felt like a warning meant to be buried.

And the tomb… something’s wrong with the air now. It vibrates. Not enough to trip a seismometer. But you can feel it in your teeth, in the base of your skull. Like standing next to a transformer too long. Even the stone seems to breathe.

I’ve checked our logs three times. We only opened the coffin yesterday.

But the candles are already burned down. My notes have dates crossed out I don’t remember writing.

Tarkan says it’s fatigue. That I should sleep.

But I don’t think I’ve been awake this whole time.

They say it’s spring outside.
That it rained this morning. That the cherry blossoms are late this year. I can’t feel any of it.

They wheeled me in through the service corridor. No one wanted me visible before the keynote. Not like this. The assistant—a kind girl with a badge too big for her coat—offered to bring tea. She didn’t look me in the eye.

It’s been seven months since Ephesus.

Since we opened that tomb.

There were twenty-seven personnel on-site.
Only five remain accounted for.
Two disappeared within a week of site closure.
Three others—catatonic. No recovery. No explanation.

Elmas still hums.
Tarkan’s been locked in a secure ward near Ankara. He paints the same symbol over and over on the walls. Says nothing. Eats nothing.
Marinos walked into the sea.

I left.
God forgive me, I left.

The university wants me to present today. “Historic breakthrough,” they said. “Rewriting Ptolemaic history.”
But I’ve forgotten how to speak about it.
Every time I try, the words melt.

Sometimes, I hear things in my dreams that I don’t understand—names, dates, descriptions of places that don’t exist yet. My fingers move in my sleep. Once, I woke up with sand in my mouth.

I asked the hospital tech to cover the mirror in my room.
When I looked into it, I didn’t blink.

There’s a strange vibration in this building. They say it’s the HVAC system. But I’ve heard it before. In the tomb. In the walls. In my spine.

The tomb didn’t just trap her.
It anchored her.
And we broke the seal.

She doesn’t need a body.
She needs a voice.
And we gave her one.
We gave her many.

She’ll call my name soon.
I can hear her gathering behind the curtain.
The lights dim.
The room is full.
But it feels so, so empty.

I shouldn’t have—
I should have—
