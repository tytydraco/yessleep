The rural town Maralin that I grew up in was tucked into a corner of the Australian outback, our population was about 250 and very tight-knit and generally that number didn't change much. Some people would leave, but then some children would be born and we'd be back to the same density of population as we always were, I don't have many grievances about growing up there but the few I have bare a hefty weight. 

There were 3 rules everyone had to follow when it came to being in the Maralin community;

**1. Stay indoors once the sun sets**

**2. Close the windows once the sun sets**

**3. If you ever find strangers in your house: ignore them, do not approach them, and lock yourself in your room until sunrise.**

If I may take a guess at what you're thinking right now, let me just say that I understand. Rule #3 is a lot to ask of anybody with any sensibility, to ignore what could very well be a threat to you and your family goes against all primitive instincts for survival. There have been many residents who moved here from a failed farm or some such, and those kind of folks are very accustomed to armed protection and believe me they are not afraid to shoot a trespasser if they need to, and they were not impressed with this rule, but those who stayed would understand its place and importance.

For as long as anyone who lives here has known, the strangers have always been here and despite their decades of appearances, nobody knows where they come from or where they go. Unfortunate as it might be, there is no pattern or context to when exactly they will show up, the only info we have is that it's always at night, at random periods of time between dusk and dawn, but the nights they appear are seemingly random; could be once a year, could be once a week for months, could be every day for months, could be absent entirely for weeks, months or even years. It fluctuates. 

It is important to keep in mind that there's no real answers to who they are, however if you ask me, they aren't human. They appear human, sure, at a distance they're even pretty convincing, but anyone that has gotten close and survived will say otherwise. The strangest part of it all, is they're only a threat if you directly communicate or interact with them, and when I say 'threat' what I mean is  that anybody who is stupid or bold enough to do so disappears, and then sometimes you'll see them as one of them, standing in a house, knocking on a window, whispering to the children and attempting to coerce them into the dark outside.

As a kid, my older brother was victim to them. 

He was 17, I was 9, he got sick of the fear these strangers we knew nothing about had over us, he was at that age where the ego is developing and he wanted to prove himself in a feat of masculinity, as if the authority figures of this town were keeping their distance from some kind of unfounded fear. I can remember the sound of mum crying as she failed to pull him back from the stair case as he stormed down in a rage, ready to fight and win and be the hero - the 4 strangers stood at the foot of the stairs, encased in shadow and as still as the calm air that enveloped rural Australia. 

I peeked out of my door, and saw briefly as the strangers overpowered him and dragged him outside, he screamed and begged and didn't stop until the physical distance he'd made from us silenced him. They just... took him. 

Then, that very next year, he came home, only it wasn't him.

It almost fooled my Mum, she saw him at the foot of the stairs while going to the toilet, she cried out to him in disbelief and thankfully stopped herself from running down the stairs to bring him into her arms, she realized it wasn't him. He just stood there. No breathing, no noise, he was like a shadow.

Poor Mum wasn't the same after that night, I'm 25 now and she is still a shell of who she was before her son was taken from her. 

I'd love nothing more than to hunt these fuckers to the ends of the earth, but it just isn't possible, all I can do is follow the rules and hope I remain human. I could move away, sure, but I can't just leave my Mum. She needs me.

There's plenty more I could talk about when it comes to.... them, but for now I don't want to dig up too much of the trauma, maybe I'll post an update some day.
