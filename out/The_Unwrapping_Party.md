Look, I know how this sounds. I really do. But when you have too much [disposable](https://www.reddit.com/r/PageTurner627Horror/comments/1pnmwq7/december_took_everything_part_1/) income and not enough common sense, curiosity turns into bad decisions fast. That’s how I ended up buying a supposedly real Egyptian mummy off the dark web at three in the morning, half-drunk and fully convinced I was invincible.

The seller was evasive but confident. Claimed it was the genuine remains of a 15th Dynasty princess named Shariti. Included grainy photos, a shaky “provenance,” and just enough historical jargon to feel convincing. The price? Twelve thousand dollars. Honestly, I’d spent more on furniture I barely liked. This at least came with a story.

And stories are meant to be shared.

So I threw an unwrapping party at my Manhattan penthouse.

I leaned hard into the aesthetic. Candles everywhere. Low lighting. Frankincense and myrrh burning in shallow brass dishes. I even curated a playlist—slow, ominous instrumental stuff that made everyone feel like they were part of something forbidden and important. The sarcophagus sat lengthwise on my living room table, displacing weeks of mail and one unfortunate houseplant.

My guests filtered in: a mix of history nerds, thrill-seekers, and friends who just wanted wine and gossip with a side of morbidity. Phones were out. Jokes were made about curses and hauntings. Someone asked if I’d taken out extra life insurance. Everyone laughed.

The mummy looked the part. Ornate coffin. Linen wrappings yellowed with age, brittle and layered, folded with what looked like reverence. It was stiff, regal, heavy in a way that suggested significance.

I made a show of it. Raised a glass. Thanked everyone for coming. Then, with exaggerated ceremony, I took a pair of scissors and made the first cut.

The linen parted easily. Too easily, maybe, but I ignored that. We peeled back layers slowly, narrating like amateur archaeologists. Someone joked about Indiana Jones. Someone else dared me to eat a piece of linen. I obliged as a good host should.

A few layers in, the mood shifted.

The linen smelled… wrong. Not dusty or dry, but faintly chemical in places, like a thrift store or a hospital hallway. The texture varied—some sections fragile, others oddly sturdy.

“Hey Rhett, does that look stitched to you?” Greg asked. He crouched closer, squinting. Greg had taken exactly one Egyptology class in college and never let anyone forget it.

He tugged at an edge. “Yeah, that’s machine stitching. No way this is ancient.”

I laughed too loudly. “Maybe the ancient Egyptians were just really ahead of their time.”

No one laughed back.

I kept going. I didn’t want to admit I felt it too—that creeping unease, the sense that we’d crossed from theatrical into something real and wrong. Beneath the outer wrappings, the body emerged.

It wasn’t desiccated. It wasn’t skeletal. The skin was intact—pale, smooth, stretched tight over bone. Preserved, sure, but not in the way I expected. It looked… recent.

Then I saw the wrist.

Just above it, clear as day beneath the thinning linen, was a tattoo. Black ink. Crisp lines. A skeletal figure in a marching band uniform, mid-step, carrying a baton.

The room went quiet.

“What the hell,” My laywer friend Lisa whispered. “Is that… My Chemical Romance?”

I stared at her. “The band?”

She nodded slowly. “Yeah... that’s the Black Parade art. That album came out in, what, 2006?”

I blinked at her. Once. Twice.

“2006… **BC?**” I asked, grasping desperately for dignity.

She gave me a look—the kind you give a grown adult who just asked if Wi-Fi existed in ancient Rome.

“No,” she said. “2006 **AD.** I was in high school. I had that album on my iPod.”

My mouth went dry, but I didn’t stop. I don’t know why. Maybe shock. Maybe denial. Maybe the awful need to know how bad it really was.

As I peeled back another layer, something slid loose and fell onto the table. Photographs. Old, curled, glossy.

I picked one up with shaking hands.

A young woman, smiling at the camera. Alive. Normal. On her wrist: the same tattoo.

The next photo showed her bound, gagged, eyes wide with terror.

The last was taken in a dim room, lit by harsh shadows. Figures in black robes stood over her body, faces hidden behind jackal masks, their hands wrapping her in linen with ritualistic care.

Someone retched behind me.

The air felt thick, unbreathable. Phones were forgotten. Wine glasses untouched. Whatever thrill we’d chased was gone, replaced by a cold, sinking horror.

This wasn’t a relic.

It wasn’t history.

It was evidence of a crime.

I turned the final photo over.

Scrawled on the back, in jagged, hurried handwriting, were seven words that finally broke me.
