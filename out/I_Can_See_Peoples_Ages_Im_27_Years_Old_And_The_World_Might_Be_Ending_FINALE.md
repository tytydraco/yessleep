I warned as the werewolf version of [Nate](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15gmn2t/i_can_see_peoples_ages_today_i_kinda_killed_a_man/?share_id=Wv9hpKS_iyV_G4_6xlzeX&utm_content=2&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) threw one of [Wesson's](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/198b42n/i_can_see_peoples_ages_today_i_was_betrayed_by_a/?share_id=rANdeLUCXWEDjoM1nBFUg&utm_content=2&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1)  white arm chairs our way. He let out a ferocious and angry roar as he completed the action

.The once small and nerdy looking man we once knew was now an almost eight foot tall bundle of brown fur and muscles that possessed herculean strength. His mouth, turned snout, was full of sharp fangs, with long protruding claws in place of his fingernails. A magnificent yellow hue emanated from Nate’s eyes. He honestly could have passed for something out of a classic monster movie, maybe even scarier than that.

We managed to jump out of the way just in the nick of time, as the piece of furniture whizzed past us and crashed on the floor by the kitchen table.

"[Mara!](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ack74l/i_can_see_peoples_ages_an_immortal_god_wants_me/)" I shouted as a curse, but also in hopes the goddess would show up and help us. In the meantime, I pulled Emily behind me, who gladly used me as a human shield.

“What do we do, Henry, what do we do?” She cried, holding on to me tight with trembling hands, “I’ve barely fought vampires, now we’re supposed to fight *that*?!?”

The arm chair’s twin was next, which ended up crashing into the wall we were crouched under. “Quick to the bar!” I shouted as pieces of splintered wood rained down on us.

The two of us dove for cover behind the bar while the massive monster was distracted looking for more expensive looking furniture to throw at us. It seemed Nate had his eye on one of the larger sectionals. I prayed he hadn’t seen us. Behind the counter was a shelf packed full of bar glasses. If that couch were to be thrown while we were back here, the aftermath wouldn’t be pretty. Thankfully, an outraged howl proved we hadn’t been spotted.

Emily looked scared out of her mind, her hands covering her mouth to quiet her shuddering breath. I put my hand on her tense shoulder and gave her a sloppy smile and my best reassuring look. Her shoulder loosened a bit and she took a calming breath. Now that Emily was feeling better, I was feeling better too. We then took a moment to collect ourselves and come up with a game plan.

“Can you take control of him?” Emily whispered.

“He’s not a vampire,” I responded, “so I don’t know.”

Emily frowned. “Can you try?”

“Why don’t you try?” I countered. She looked at me, puzzled.

“Oh, that’s right you don’t know,” I realized. “All of us can control vampires. We all have multiple abilities. Nate was lying to us.”

“What?!” She whisper-yelled at me, punching my arm. “Why didn’t you tell me?”

“Sorry, I was busy getting sent to oblivion,” I told her, peeking behind the counter to look for Nate. He was stomping around the middle of the living room. I looked back at Emily, who just rolled her eyes.

“Whatever,” I mumbled, taking a breath and closing my eyes. I tried to summon my power, feel that electric tug in my stomach again, but it never came. I tried again, focusing my entire being on Nate. I pictured him seizing up in that spot, unable to move. I opened my eyes, nothing. I gave up hope and crouched behind the counter again.

“Shit,” I mumbled, shaking my head. “I can’t.”

Emily let out a disappointed sigh. “We should look for something to defend ourselves with until we can find a way out of here or until Nate goes back to normal.”

“*If* he goes back to normal,” I scoffed. Emily shot me a hard glance.

While analyzing our surroundings, I noticed a gun locker in the corner of the dining room I hadn’t seen before. Slowly, a plan started to formulate in my mind.

“Hey, you know how some vampire lore in the media is accurate?” I asked Emily, looking back at the locker. She nodded, the realization slowly dawning on her when she saw what I was staring at. “Maybe it’s the same for Nate. What are the chances Wesson has silver bullets in there?”

“There are myths that one of vampires' weaknesses is silver, so I don’t see why not?” She responded.

“I’ve got an idea,” I tell her, “I’m going to go look in that gun locker for silver bullets, or any weapon that might help us. Do you think you can distract him while I do that?”

Emily quickly took a peek behind the bar to check up on Nate’s position. Currently, a flat screen tv was getting ripped out of the wall.  “What do I do if he charges at me?”

“Try to use your fire if he gets too close.”

“B-but he’s still a Chosen right? My fire won’t do anything to him.”

I sigh, seeing the glimmer of hope in her eyes. “I hate to say it Emily, but I’m not entirely sure Nate is still in there. We don’t exactly know what he is now. Wesson killed him, Nate was *dead* before he turned into that thing.”

“You’re right,” she responded dejectedly. Pouting, Emily readied herself to jump out from behind the bar and cause a distraction.

“Hey,” I said, stopping her, “At the very least, your flames will protect you and keep him at bay, alright? You’ll be okay.”

Emily grabbed on to my wrist suddenly and stared into my soul. “We’re not killing him… are we?”

I couldn’t bring myself to answer her. Truth be told I had no idea what the hell I was doing or where this was going. My only goal was getting us through this alive and in one piece. If that meant killing this werewolf, then so be it.

A tense moment of silence passed between us before I broke it. “On my count, ok?” I said, brushing the question off and waiting for her confirmation.

Emily nodded, dropping the subject. Then, I began counting down. “In one… two… three… NOW!”

Emily and I both sprang out from behind the bar at the same time.

While I lunged for the lock on the single unit gun locker, Emily grabbed two glasses from the shelf and started banging them together. She ran to the opposite side of the living room to give me as much space as possible.

*Clink! Clink! Clink!*

“Hey, I’m over here ya big smelly mutt!”

*Clink! Clink! Clink!*

Nate had been crouched down on the floor. He stopped gnawing on cords and plastic before angrily chucking the tv across the living room. Emily dodged with a yelp.

“Is that all you got, Nate?” She taunted after collecting herself, continuing to bang the glasses together.

*Clink! Clink! Clink!*

Nate snarled and rose from the ground, slowly stalking towards his prey. His sharp fangs glinted in the artificial light when he bore his teeth at Emily. Large streams of slobber spilled out of his mouth as he growled menacingly.

“Henry, hurry up!” Emily yelled at me nervously, backing up. “He looks pissed!”

“I’m working on it!” I yelled back. Not only was the locker locked, the metal door was rusted shut. It looked like the thing hadn’t been opened in ages. My hope in finding silver bullets quickly dwindled.

I didn’t have the key for the lock and there wasn’t time to snoop through the cabin to find it. The lock looked old and brittle, so I figured I might be able to kick it open. But even if I did manage to break the lock, I still needed something to pry the metal door open with. Scanning the dining room, I noticed the table had been set. On top of a smooth white silk tablecloth, fancy plates and china lined the table. Wine and water glasses were paired with every plate. More importantly, there was silverware. Silverware that I could use as a makeshift crowbar.

I swiped a knife from the table and walked back over to the gun locker. Taking a step back, I wound my leg up then kicked the lock, hard. A loud metallic clunk filled the cabin. Apparently it was loud enough to get Nate’s attention. He turned away from Emily and focused on me.

*Clink! Clink! Clink!*

“Don’t pay attention to him!” Emily shouted, clanking her glasses together more frantically. “I’m over here! Look over here you stupid furball!”

Her attempt to redirect Nate’s attention worked. He roared as he turned back to her, seemingly forgetting about me. “Henry, whatever you’re doing, make it quick!”

I nodded my head as I readied myself for another good kick. Hopefully the lock was old and rickety enough to break in a couple of tries. If I couldn’t open this locker in time, there was a good chance Emily and I would end up as puppy chow.

I pushed that thought out of my mind and took another step back, but farther away. I ran and kicked the lock for a second time. Again a metallic thump sounded out, but the clanking sound of glass kept Nate distracted.

The sound of metal falling to the floor was like music to my ears. The lock had broken open. Now all that stood between life and death was a rusted shut door.

Quickly, I took the knife and tried to wedge it in the door, but the rust was like a sealant. I tried scraping at the rust, trying to carve out a small hole I could use to pry the door open. It took a minute, but I managed to create a crevasse I could stick the knife in. I tried pulling the door open, but a singular knife wouldn’t cut it. I ended up bending the metal and it became totally useless.

I pulled it out and chucked it on the ground. I returned to the table and grabbed two more knives. If I could split the weight maybe they wouldn’t bend and I’d be able to pry open the door.

I scraped some more rust and stuck both knives in. I pulled once more. I thought I was beginning to feel the door start to give when the knives I was using bent again.

In a fit of anger, I threw the knives on the ground and kicked the locker.

“Henry, What are you doing?!” Emily yelled angrily as Nate turned and roared at me. “I’m trying to keep him over here!”

A light bulb went off as an idea suddenly popped into my head. “No, wait! I need him over here! I can use him to break open the gun locker,” I explained.

Emily looked at me dumbfounded. “How?! Are you sure that’s even a good idea?”

“Not really, but it’s the best I can come up with right now!”

“Just remember he’s a wild animal at the moment. He’s unpredictable. I’ve barely been able to keep him from pouncing on me,” she warned.

“I’ll be careful, okay? Right now this is our only hope,” I responded.

Emily gave me a nod of approval.

I began kicking and smacking the gun locker, trying to keep Nate’s attention on me. If I could get him to crash into the gun locker and knock it down, the force might just be enough to open the door and reveal the contents inside.

“Come on big guy, come get me!” I yelled, pounding on the locker even harder. “Yeah that’s it! I’m over here! What are you going to do about it?”

My adrenaline spiked when Nate started to charge at me. Despite my fear, I kept banging and shouting, watching the anger rise in his eyes. I kept goading him on until he was about two feet away. I barely managed to jump out of the way right before Nate barreled into the locker.

The sweet sound of rusted metal creaking open rang out as the gun locker fell to the floor. Nate, having so much momentum, had flipped over the gun locker and had crashed into the back wall, leaving a gargantuan hole in the drywall. He quickly recovered though, shaking the dust and debris off his fur as he got to his feet.

I scrambled to the open locker looking for a gun and ammo. Inside strapped to the wall was a pump action shotgun. Stray bullets and empty ammo packages were strewn about inside the locker and outside on the floor. Unfortunately none of them contained silver bullets in them. I hurriedly grabbed the gun and started searching for the appropriate ammo. At the least this mission hadn’t been a total bust, now we had *something* to defend ourselves with.

“Look out!” Emily shouted. I registered her words too late and was caught off guard. The wind got knocked out of me as a clawed fist connected with my ribs. I clutched the gun close to me as I was thrown a couple of feet.

I laid on the floor for a second, rolling onto my back, only able to take shallow breaths without feeling tremendous waves of pain in my chest. My ears were ringing and the world went dark for a second. Pretty sure one of my ribs was broken.

The sound of Emily yelling, “Fuck!” quickly brought me back. I rolled onto my side just in time to see her chuck one of the bar glasses at Nate’s head- he had been about two seconds away from ripping my throat out. The glass shattered on impact and immediately Nate had let out a ferocious howl. He wiped the glass shards from his fur before he turned back to me.

“Get away from him!” Emily screeched as she chucked another glass. Just like the first time, it hit his temple and broke on impact. This really pissed Nate off. He lost interest in me and charged for Emily instead. She shrieked and ran towards the shelf for more glasses to throw.

I managed to gather enough strength and sat myself up on the floor. I registered the feel of the gun in my hand as the fog in my mind slowly started to recede.

“Stay back!” I heard Emily shout as a bright flash of light lit up the cabin. A confused yelp came from Nate. I turned to see a blast of fire shoot out of Emily’s palm. Her flames licked Nate’s snout and he backed up, confused and scared of the fire. Emily blasted more of her flames at the werewolf, but it soon became evident to us that no damage was being done to him.

”Fire retardant werewolves,” I scoffed, ”don’t see that everyday.” The full intensity of the situation finally hit me at that moment, and I shook the remaining fog out of my head.

Nate soon came to the same realization as we did. While he experimented clawing at the fire and not feeling pain, I managed to get to my feet and started pilfering through shattered glass, shards of metal, and broken pieces of wood for any shotgun shells I could find. Thankfully, I found four rounds. I quickly loaded the gun and aimed.

*Chick-Chick Boom!*

One round in his chest. Nate barely seemed inconvenienced. He stopped playing around and walked through one of Emily’s blasts like it was nothing. Emily grabbed another glass and smashed it on Nate’s nose. Nate roared and slashed at her. He managed to land a good blow on her forearm. Emily scrambled away, holding her bleeding arm in pain, trying to stop the bleeding. A mix of adrenaline and rage filled me. I reloaded my shotgun.

*Chick-Chick Boom!* Another round into his chest, the momentum of the shot knocking Nate off kilter for a moment. “Back.”

Reload. *Chick-Chick Boom!* This time I hit his shoulder. Skin and muscle tore off as the metal pellets made contact. His wound healed in a second. “The fuck.”

*Chick-Chick Boom!* My last round ended up hitting Nate in the stomach. This time the blast was strong enough to knock him a couple feet back. “Up.”

Nate landed on the floor by the coffee table. I took advantage of the time he was down to sift through debris to find more ammo.

“That was badass!” Emily cheered. “If you can find more ammo, we might just be able to get out of here.”

I let out a hopeful chuckle. Maybe we would make it out of here relatively unscathed.

Our good feelings were drowned out by a blood curdling and outraged snarl that filled the cabin as Nathan picked himself up. He looked around frantically for something to grab and throw. His eyes settled on the gold rimmed glass coffee table. Being the closest to him, Nate picked up the table and aimed it straight for Emily’s head.

“Oh shit!” She cried, bracing for impact, knowing she didn’t have any time to get out of the way.

I had realized what Nate was going to do a couple seconds before he picked up the table and started running towards Emily. Seconds before he started the action of slamming the coffee table down, I barely managed to push her out of the way in time. As the coffee table was flung at me, I shut my eyes tight and braced my whole body for pain. All I could do in that moment was wish for it not to hurt too bad.

Suddenly, a familiar electric and powerful feeling overcame me. My body went rigid then into overdrive. The intense mixed feelings of energy, anger, and power churned through my veins.

“Oh shit?” Emily asked, surprised. I un-scrunched one of my eyes to see what was happening. Nate kept pushing down on the table, confused on why the table was suspended in mid-air and not budging. I let out a disbelieving gasp, even though there wasn’t a single doubt in my mind this was me. This was the same feeling I had when taking control over vampires. Only this time it seemed I could telekinetically control in-organic materials. Where the hell was this power a second ago?

A flashback of Mara kissing my forehead back at The Garden earlier popped into my head. Then it hit me that she must’ve blessed me with another ability as some sort of safeguard in case things went wrong.

With a confident smirk, I controlled the coffee table and ripped it out of Nate’s grasp. I flipped the script and smashed the table over the werewolf’s head. Nate was knocked back down and shards of glass rained down on him and impaled him in many different spots. If he wasn’t a fast healing, practically invincible, werewolf, Nate would definitely have bled out and died by now.

“Hold on, was that you, Henry?!” Emily asked, getting up off the floor and cautiously backing away from our monstrous tormentor. “You did this?’

“Get away from us,” I ordered, “It’s about to get real ugly in here.”

Emily did as I said and ran back into the kitchen right as Nate started to stir. Testing out my new abilities, I imagined the discarded and broken flat screen tv floating over and hovering above Nate. Then I willed it to happen right as he tried to sit up. Then I smashed it down. Nate’s head flew back and hit the ground. He lifted his head off the floor and I smashed the tv down again. The third time, Nate predicted what I would do and annoyingly grabbed the tv and threw it, smashing it into the dining room table. From the sheer force of the throw, the table collapsed onto itself, sending fine china and glassware flying everywhere. He flung himself up onto his feet, and cracked his neck while giving me a menacing glare. In response, I cracked my knuckles and looked for a heavy piece of furniture I could hurl at him.

Back in the kitchen it seemed Emily was exploring and looking for a way to help. “Did these knives bend super easily? Especially when they were heated in your hand?” she asked, migrating to and crouching over the destroyed dining room table, inspecting the area near where I had discarded the useless knives from the locker.

“Really?!? You’re asking these questions *now*?” I cried, narrowly avoiding getting my hand bitten off.

“Yes or no, Henry, yes or no?! Please, it's important,” she begged.

“Yeah. They did, Emily,” I answered, using a lamp cover as a shield from Nate’s chomping maw.

“Good, that’s good. I think this silverware is made out of actual silver then.”

“What? Wait, really?”

“Yeah”, she answered, examining one of the bent knives closely. “Silver is notoriously malleable and is actually the sixth most ductile metal. If you know what you’re looking for, it’s pretty easy to spot.”

I grabbed a couple of bar glasses using my mind and smashed them onto different parts of Nate’s body in order to give myself time to get some distance from him. “How did you even know that?”

Emily chuckled. “My dad taught me. He loves learning about different metals and the elements. He also had a weird obsession with the gold rush, so he’s a wealth of geologic and history facts.”

I noticed her hand started to glow. Pretty quickly the knife superheated and developed a chrome looking coating. “What are you doing?”

“I’m going to smelt this silverware down and shape it into bullets.”

“Mind tossing me one of those knives to use while you do that?” I asked, taking my attention off of Nate for a second.Emily grabbed a knife and was about to pass it to me when Nate used his new supernatural speed to bodyslam into me like a linebacker. I heard a sickening crack as our bodies connected. I cried out in pain as Nate sent me gliding into the bar counter. I managed to sit up where I realized my left shoulder had been dislocated. Pain clouded my mind and made it extremely difficult to control the furniture around me. Weakly, I tossed a bar stool at Nate, who used his unnaturally fast reflexes to swipe it away.

“Emily!” I groaned out, straining to crawl away from my werewolf attacker.

“I’m almost done, Henry, hold on!” She yelled as she finished smelting down the knife. She played with the heated metal like it was playdough, pulling the metal apart and shaping the pieces into little pellets with her bare hands, the extremely heated object seemingly not burning her skin.

Nate let out a gleeful chuff as he closed the gap between us. I let out a scared whimper as he pounced and held me onto the ground by my neck. I clawed and scratched at his fury wrists begging for release and proper air flow. I tried to use my telekinesis to grab onto Nate himself, but just like earlier, it didn’t work. Suddenly a sharp and intense pain came from my shin as Nate stomped on it, staring me in the eyes as he did so.

I started seeing stars and lost my hearing for a second. Then a high pitched ringing noise rattled my ears. It took me a moment to realize my ears weren’t ringing, it was my agonizing scream. I looked down to see a bloodied mangled mess of skin, muscle, and bones. My right lower leg had been completely decimated.

The sound of the shotgun being pumped and loaded rang out from by the bar. Emily had loaded her silver pellets into a discarded shotgun shell casing and loaded it into the gun. She now stood at attention while Nate bared his fangs and licked the skin on my neck, savoring the stench of fear wafting off me.

“Don’t you dare touch another hair on his head, Nate.” Emily demanded as she took a calculated step towards us. ”I won’t hesitate to blow a hole into you.”

I felt his grip loosen around my neck for a moment before Nate let out an annoyed grunt and began lightly nipping the skin around my carotid artery. I let out a choked cry as the blood loss caught up to me. I was freezing and started feeling sleepy.

“I’m sorry to do this then,” she said. Suddenly a loud explosion filled the room as the gun went off. Nate yelped and released his hold over me. He backed up, clutching the side of his stomach. Blood trickled through his fingers and puddled on the ground beneath him.

“I did it,” she said to herself in disbelief, “the bullets worked!”

Lazily, I moved my eyes to Nate, whose wound hadn’t started healing yet. Blood was still seeping out through his fingers as Nate faltered, almost collapsing. He caught himself though, and managed to keep himself steady. He let out a pained roar as he used his anger as a crutch and charged at Emily.

She stood there frozen in shock, expecting him to go down with that one shot. Even with my waning conscienceness, I understood how fucked we both were. Emily had only made one bullet and didn’t have any more on her. I was mangled to high hell. Even running only on fumes and sheer willpower alone, I couldn’t move, much less help her. Even if she lunged for more silverware to use as a weapon, I doubted she’d be able to outrun Nate, even in his injured state.

It seemed like all hope was lost. Despite all of our efforts and divine intervention, we *still* lost. This was it, this was the end. We were both going to die.

A blinding white light enveloped my vision. *This is it.* I thought. *Go towards the light, let this all be over.* As the light started to dim, however, I realized it was a light, but wasn’t *the* light. It was Mara rejoining us.

Using what little strength I had, I opened my eyelids to see Mara standing between Emily and Nate. She was in a protective stance, shielding Emily. Mara shot her a smile before turning and taking a step closer to her former Chosen One. The werewolf Nate growled as the goddess walked on air to get up to his eye level. She suddenly pounced and gently kissed him on the forehead.

In an instant he was out like a light. His body began contorting once again, but this time the hair and wolfish features receded, turning Nate back into his regular, human, self. He laid on the floor, passed out and naked, blood still pouring from his gunshot wound. Mara waved her hand over the gaping wound and when she moved it, it was like the injury had never been there.

The goddess then walked over to Emily and checked in on her. “How are you doing, darling?” She asked as she healed the wounds on Emily’s forearm.

“Better, now that you’re here,” she responded tearfully.

Mara nodded pleasantly. Emily pointed at me and silently pleaded to Mara with her eyes. She looked over to me and frowned when she saw the condition I was in.

“Tsk, Tsk, Henry,” Mara whispered in my ear. “You really do know how to get into it, don’t you? You remind me so much of my brother,” she hastily added, “but in a good way.” She then leaned in close and kissed my forehead once more. The pain went away, feeling like it was only a fever dream. Now feeling awake and refreshed, I noticed Mara had healed my wounds and all the damage done to my leg.

“Thank you,” I said gratefully.

“My apologies,” she said while helping me get to my feet. “I would have gotten here sooner were I not out looking for Wesson. My brother can be particularly hard to find when he doesn’t want to be found. Anyway, at least someone is done throwing a tantrum. Mara looked over to Nate’s sleeping body.

Both Emily and I cautiously walked over to him.

“Relax, children, he’s not dead,” she said calmly. “He is, however, still a werewolf. That I unfortunately cannot undo.”

“What *did* you do to him?” Emily and I both asked in unison.

“A second chance,” Mara answered in a whisper, taking a deep, shuddering,  breath. “Something tells me he deserved a second chance. And maybe, in time… I’ll be able to give my brother a second chance too.”

Mara said nothing else before simply disappearing.

Then Nate woke up. He sat up and clutched the side of his head. I’m sure it felt like he had the world’s worst hangover. “What happened? My head is killing me!” He groaned. Nate realized he was naked and hid his private bits behind his hands. “Why am I naked?!?”

Emily smacked the back of his head. He yelped out in pain as he started rubbing the sore spot. Nate shot Emily a glare.

“You got turned into a werewolf and tried to eat us,” she seethed, folding her arms into her chest.

Nate looked to me for clarity. I folded my arms into my chest too. “You were literally about to rip my throat out,” I said, gesturing to the destruction done to the cabin affectionately dubbed “The Kill Shed.” Which, in its current state, was a pretty fitting name.

“I did all that?” He questioned breathlessly. He seemed freaked out, understandably so.

“Most of it, yeah,” I answered. I flicked my wrist and a glass shard started floating. Nate’s eyes practically popped out of their sockets at the demonstration of my newfound power. I quickly released my hold over the object and it clattered to the floor. “Most of it.”

“I can barely comprehend what you just told me, and now *you* have a new ability? God, everything smells ten times worse than it did before! What the hell is going on?! I don’t remember a thing!”

“I’ll explain it to you later.” I told him, patting his shoulder while pulling the tablecloth over for him to cover up.

“Guys,” Emily interjected, “what are we supposed to do now?”

A phone suddenly appeared in front of us. On it, the dramatic sting of a breaking news broadcast began playing. The three of us focused our attention on the phone.

It was a local news station covering an ongoing case. Apparently in the last couple of hours there has been a rise in random violent wild animal attacks all around the country. My heart sank as Emily and I both turned to stare at Nate.

He let out a nervous gulp and played with the strap on his makeshift toga.

We all knew the truth. Although random, they weren’t just plain old animal attacks. Wesson was out there creating more werewolves. More chaos. More of a mess for us to clean up.

Suddenly the news report stopped playing and the phone vanished. In its place was a pink sticky note with a message written on it:

*Help Nate control the wolf inside. Then you all know what to do.\~Mara*

\*\*\*

A couple days have gone by since the events at Wesson’s cabin.

Nate’s with us, though I adamantly voiced my opinion against it. Emily, however, convinced me otherwise. Not only did she cite Mara’s note, but she guilt-tripped me by reiterating how Wesson coldly killed Nate and then turned him into a monster without his consent.

I caved, remembering what Mara said about second chances. I’m still watching him closely, though. He still needs to regain both Emily and I’s trust and needs to learn how to control his werewolf side.

We’re all getting used to Nate’s new affliction. We don’t know exactly what he can and can’t do, what triggers the transformation (besides the full moon), his weaknesses, and how to return him back to normal once he’s changed. This, I suspect, is why Mara left us the note. If we can learn how Nate ticks we can use that knowledge against the other werewolves Wesson created. We might even be able to use Nate to track them down as well.

In the meantime, we’re back at my apartment above Marty’s. And no, I didn’t get fired from my job, but I came close to. The night Nate showed up at the bar, I left Marty a note explaining that I had a family emergency I had to deal with urgently and didn’t know when I’d be back. When I showed back up with those two, I had to beg not to be fired. Marty stuck me on probation and I have to work doubles every day for the next month. A small sacrifice to pay for the greater good, in my opinion.

Emily and Nate moved in. I gave the master bedroom to Emily, and Nate, my old air mattress. I’m sleeping on the couch. Sure it’s cramped, but it actually hasn’t been that bad. But if we’re going to do this, be a team, we need to get to know one another better. No more secrets and no more lies. Mara is counting on us to figure our shit out.

Speaking of Mara, she just paid us a visit and delivered some *fantastic* news!

“I fear my brother has yet again started up his shenanigans.” She had said, suddenly appearing in the middle of my living room, glowing infinity sign and all. She gave us all a good startle. Nate actually started to shift, but with a single touch from Mara, he calmed down and his transformation stopped.

Once we were sure he was ok, Mara continued. “Since his last ploy to get back into The Garden failed, in yet another act of defiance, Wesson has stopped his cosmic duty and is refusing to reap souls.”

“What?” Emily yelped.

“Souls have stopped coming to The Garden,” our goddess reiterated.

Nate let out a nervous, almost animalistic, huff. “So what does that mean?”

Trying to lighten the mood I jokingly blurt out, “Isn’t it obvious, Nate? Zombies!”

I looked to Mara to validate my joke, but her expression was as serious as ever. Even with her color changing iris’s, there was no hint of amusement in her eyes.

“Wait, you’re serious? Actual zombies?!” My smile dissipated.

“I’m not sure,” Mara answered truthfully. This was the most nervous I'd ever seen her. “Something akin to that nature, yes. Once a mortal's body dies, the soul is meant to move on and rest in my garden. If the soul can’t do that, it becomes trapped in its decaying body. The soul, not being reaped, starts to go stir crazy, which causes the deterioration to accelerate. Thus, you have an angry soul that craves death and sweet release trapped in a decaying vessel. Based on this description you could accurately describe these creatures as zombies.”

“What is with this dude and his obsession with the undead?! I complained. First it was vampires, now it's zombies.

Nate scoffed. “Well, he is The God of Death…”

I rolled my eyes at his response because he was right.

“What are *we* supposed to do about that?” Emily asked, freaking out.

“Right now? Nothing.” Mara answered.

I let out a nervous cry.

 Nate sat down on the couch. He was stressed out of his mind. I could see his eyes start to glow yellow again.

“It’ll be alright,” she said stoically. ”This is my burden to handle right now. I’ve temporarily extended the human lifespan and done everything I can to prevent sudden and tragic deaths. Unfortunately there is a scale to keep balanced here, so I can’t stop everyone from dying. The problem is mostly contained for the moment, but the scale can tip at any moment.”

“Is there anything we can do?” Nate asked as he rubbed his temples.

“All you can do is try to lure my brother out. Stall him for long enough so I can get to him. Talk some sense into him.”

“That’s easy,” I started. “Wesson knows I’m your favorite and I think, just like you, he has a special attachment to Nate.”

Mara brought her thumb to her lips and chewed them while thinking. “I suppose that’s true,” she paused for a long moment, looking at Nate. He nodded his head slightly in agreement. “I’ll let the three of you workshop that idea. I do need to get back to my search for Wesson, though. If you need me, I’ll come as fast as I can, but for now I must leave you, my Chosen One’s.”

Just as she had appeared, Mara was gone without a trace. She left without giving us a chance to say goodbye.

Nate, Emily, and I all sat in silence. The amount of pressure we felt was tremendous, it was like the weight of the world was on our shoulders.

How on *Earth* were we going to make it out of this one?

Alas, I think it’s about time I log out. Got a lot of things on my plate right now. Damage control a rising werewolf epidemic, try to prevent a potential zombie apocalypse, all the while eradicating blood sucking vampires along the way.

You know, the ‘use.

Anyway, stay young and don’t let me catch you trying to buy alcohol underage.

Signing off,
