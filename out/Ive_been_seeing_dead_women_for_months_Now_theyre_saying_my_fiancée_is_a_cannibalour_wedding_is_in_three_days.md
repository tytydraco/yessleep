I started seeing dead women right after I began sleepwalking late last year. Around the same time, I had just started dating Kurt Monarch, a charming, flirty pharmaceutical executive in his late forties, who lived twenty miles from my apartment in Atlanta, Georgia. We met through a mutual friend who worked at his company, and the rest was history. Within three months, we were already having serious conversations about marriage and starting a family. I know what you’re thinking—-that was fast, but I couldn’t help myself, I was in love with him.



Sleepwalking was no fun experience, but unfortunately, it ran in the family. My mother started sleepwalking at my age, in her late thirties. I tried everything to stop it, countless medications, visits to different doctors, only to be prescribed the same useless treatments each time. I had no memories of my actions while sleepwalking, but this time was different. I vividly recalled seeing the dead women—middle-aged, like me. They were beautiful, full of potential, but the fear and regret etched on their faces haunted me. At first, I tried to dismiss them as nightmares, but waking up outside, standing in the street at night, as I often did, and remembering every detail made me realize the experience was real. And I knew I had to do something about it.



I loved Kurt with all my heart, and I didn’t want to spook him with my story. So, I kept my mouth shut, and thank God I did, I thought at the time. We strolled through a brightened park, and suddenly, he went down on his knees, drawing a large gasp from me. Oh, God, it was happening, this fucker was proposing to me. He pulled out a black ring box and as the hinged lid opened up, Kurt declared in a soft voice. “As my best buddy and confidant, I can’t imagine a life without you. Will you marry me?”



“Yes. A thousand times. Come over here, you sucker.” I grabbed him by the collar before he got off the ground and we ate each other’s lips for minutes. And right after I opened my eyes, I saw a small group of dead women standing behind him, staring at me with a gloomy look.



I screamed and pulled away from Kurt, completely freaked out. He glanced behind him, confused, before turning back to me and asking. “Martie, what’s wrong?” 



I hugged him tightly and whispered. “Just a dream, Kurt. A bad dream.” The dead women had vanished. Until recently, I only came across them while sleepwalking, but somehow, they had followed me into the waking world. I recognized their faces, etched with the same haunting dread, wasn't something I wanted to see every day. But I didn’t think I had a choice, I actually believed it would get worse before it gets any better. But what could I do? I couldn’t confide in Kurt with this. He’d think I was losing my mind and might even call off the engagement. I needed to talk to Nash, the friend who hooked us up together. I’ve known her for years and knew she could keep a secret.



I scheduled a meeting with Nash over the phone that night, trying hard not to fall asleep in my apartment to avoid sleepwalking again. Nash and I met at a coffee shop, a couple of miles from the post office where I worked as a clerk. I stepped out of the bus and hugged Nash in the street, and we entered the coffee shop. Nash was delighted to know that I had accepted Kurt’s proposal at the park. Which I found odd, because I didn’t disclose the exact location.



“How did you know Kurt proposed at the park?” I inquired.



She produced an awkward laugh. “Oh. Yeah, that. I guessed it. Most sane people proposed at the park. It's romantic.” I thought so too, so I didn’t press further. But as soon as I was ready to confide in her about my sleepwalking experience, another dead woman appeared, this time, she was standing behind Nash, holding a machete around her neck.



I screamed and pointed behind her. “Oh. My. God. Watch out, Nash.” Nash glanced behind her and turned back to me, flabbergasted. Patrons started to turn towards me, wondering what was going on. But more dead women stood in the coffee shop, staring specifically at Nash, and shaking their heads at me. I was going insane. Why was I the only one who could see them? Was it some kind of curse on me? I was never that… special.



Nash looked into my frightened eyes. “Martie, are you okay? What’s going on with you?” I winced, as the dead woman still had a machete around Nash’s neck, ready to gut her, but Nash couldn’t even see her. I had no choice but to act normal. I came to the conclusion that I was the only one perhaps in this world that could see those dead women. So, I played the workplace drama card, hoping that she would believe me. It was now crystal clear to me: those dead women knew who Nash was, and didn’t want me to tell her the truth about them.



“Martie, if work is stressing you out, to the point of insanity, then, it’s time to find another job.” 



I nodded and finished my coffee and bagels, and when I looked up and around the shop, the dead women were gone. Desperation wasn’t going to save me from them, I needed to know what they wanted from me, as Kurt and I had scheduled our wedding five days from now.



I welcomed Kurt into my home that Monday evening with a warm hug as we prepared to have dinner with my parents. His parents weren’t in the picture—-he was raised as an orphan and had little connection with his biological family. His adopted parents had also lost touch with him. I avoided bringing up family in our conversations, sensing the pain it caused him when I talked about mine. My mother, Gina, was elated to meet Kurt, and kept her eyes on him the entire time he recounted how we first met. My dad, Todd, was a pessimistic freak. Every man who stepped foot in my apartment seemed, in his eyes, like the next coming of the devil. I knew he loved me and only wanted what was best for my future, but honestly, I didn’t need his approval. At the time, I was determined to marry Kurt, no matter what.



“How many tails have you slept with in your adult life, Mr. Kurt?” My dad asked, leaning forward towards Kurt, who looked embarrassed by the unusual question.



“Honey, maybe that can wait. We’re eating,” My mom interjected, but my dad was a hothead and kept pressing Kurt.



“Yeah. You’re all eating but I haven’t yet touched my plate. So, Kurt, how many?”

Kurt’s lips widened as he lightly touched my hand laid on the table. “I’m a virgin, Mr. Todd. Never dated any woman in my life. Sorry, I must say it’s a bit unusual for a guy in his late forties.” Kurt said, as my dad began to eat.



“You said and I quote: “Never dated any woman in my life.” But what about men? Have you dated any men in your life, Mr. Kurt?” 



My mom raised her voice in protest. “Todd! Please, have some respect, would you?”



“I have always respected our guests; I just think this time it’s a little bit too early for Martie to marry a guy she has known for three mere months. That’s all. It isn’t about respect.”



The sound of a casserole hitting the floor put a stop at the upcoming bickering between my parents. I whispered to Kurt that I would be back and left the dinner table, heading for the kitchen around the corner. Upon stepping into the kitchen, I almost tripped over myself, as a dead woman, missing her left arm, stood at the counter, watching a casserole on the stove. She slowly turned her face toward me and placed her finger around her mouth, instructing me to be quiet. I wanted to yell for help, but I had been on that road before. So, I kept my poise and took a deep breath. My mom called out to me. “Martie! Is everything alright?”



The dead woman slowly aimed her finger into the casserole, teasing me to come look inside. I took her bait, stepped closer to the casserole and took a peek inside. There, simmering beneath layers of onions, tomatoes and garlic, was her missing arm. I screamed, as the dead woman reached into the casserole, snatched the limb, and attempted to cram the entire thing into her mouth. Kurt and my parents rushed into the kitchen, but by then, only I remained, eyes shut tight, trembling like a leaf.



“Martie! What is it? What did you see?” Kurt frantically asked, as I slowly opened my eyes and saw that the dead woman was gone. I turned around to shocked looks from them. I didn’t want them to think I belonged in a mental facility, so I lied about what happened.



“A mouse ran up to me, and I screamed. I’m sorry, guys.” I said, eliciting laughter from Kurt, who gave me a peck on the lips. My father was unfazed by Kurt’s romantic gesture.



“A peck won’t save you boy, let’s get back out there. I still have a million questions that need answers from you.” My mother blew a kiss at me, signaling that she was all in for the wedding and followed my dad toward the dining table. Kurt’s demeanor began to change, he started to sniff the kitchen like some bear looking for food. Never seen him behave like this before.



“You sure you didn’t see anything, Martie?” he asked, staring at me.



I pulled him towards me by the collar. “Matter of fact, I saw a mouse that was bigger than your dick, virgin boy.” We kissed and when I opened my eyes, I saw another dead girl outside the window, drawing her finger on the fogged surface of the glass, writing the words: Don’t Wed.

I didn’t sleep with Kurt that night. He wouldn’t see me naked until after the wedding. That’s why it felt so wrong when hands touched me as I lay stiff in bed. I knew it couldn’t be Kurt because he left hours ago. So, what in the world was trying to have sex with me? As the hands multiplied, tugging at my clothes, I jolted upright, flicked on the light, and saw nothing. But I could’ve sworn I felt people touching me. Shaking it off as a nightmare, I headed downstairs, grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge and went outside to get some fresh needed air. The dead’s woman writing on the fogged surface of my window: *Don’t Wed*, nagged at me. No doubt this was a warning about my wedding. But why would the dead give a damn about who I married? It made no sense. Was my life in danger? I didn’t think so… until I heard the front door close. 



I’d left it open.



I slowly turned behind me and saw a dead woman in a wedding gown, caked in awful makeup, gripping a baseball bat. Heart racing, I acted like I hadn’t seen her and bolted down the street. As I sprinted down the street, a small group of dead women in wedding dresses appeared, blocking my path. They held signs, and their message was clear: Leave the city or die. They made a circle around me and began running, whispering the chilling words: last warning, Martie. This is your last warning, girl. And all of a sudden, they disappeared. I was in deep trouble; never before have I been so scared of my life. I had two clear choices: Leave the city as they wanted, which meant canceling the wedding. That was out of the question, as I loved Kurt with all my heart and, honestly, it was past time for me to get married. The second choice: ignore them completely, and surely, they will go away for good.



I was back at work on Tuesday morning as a post office clerk. A job I hated because I had to deal with customers on a daily basis, for not exactly a lot of money. Customers kept coming and going as I tried not to think about what happened to me yesterday. My mind was set, if I came across the dead once more, I’d just ignore them and move along. I took a fifteen-minute break and strolled outside while my replacement took over. Smoking was repulsive to me but with all the stress I was dealing with, I had to take a puff to calm my nerves. After my break ended, I went back into the post office and frozen… customers began to glare at me. All of them for no apparent reason. Even my co-workers stared at me with hatred. My replacement, Jenny, walked over to me and handed me a note. I grabbed the note and read: Don’t Wed. 



I stared deeply into Jenny’s eyes and whispered. “How did you get that?”



“They were here minutes ago. They said they’d kill our families if we don’t stop you from getting hitched,” Jenny whispered, her lips trembling with fear as a customer stepped toward me. Until now, I thought I was the only person that could see the dead women. But it seemed that to stop me for good, they’d made themselves visible to others, recruiting them to end my wedding. Oh God, were they going to kill me too? 



Well, guess what, I didn’t wait to find out and took off like a thief, sprinting down the pavement. I elbowed through passengers, frantically dialing 911 on my phone for help! When I glanced back, post office customers and co-workers were chasing me. How could normal people change into monsters so fast? The fear of their families being hurt by the dead—-something that couldn’t be arrested or charged must’ve freaked them out. I understood their ardent desire to stop me, but I wasn’t going to let them. I spotted a bus about to leave, and picked up my speed, smashing my fists at the door and yelling at the driver to let me in. The driver obliged and opened the door, letting me inside. I scrambled to the front, talking to the 911 dispatcher. The bus was packed, and people kept giving me strange looks.



“I need help! There are people following me. Yes. Some of them are co-workers. Why? It has to do with my wedding in five days. The post office on Gaines Street. Hurry!”



When I hung up the phone, Ahmed, my regular bus driver for the route home and to work, tossed a note onto my lap. I slowly picked up the note: Don’t Wed. I looked at Ahmed. His hands gripped the wheel, his eyes welling with unspoken words, the struggle clear in his throat.



“They came to me at night. I love my family, Martie. I’m sorry,” Ahmed said, his voice breaking down as he slammed his foot on the pedal. The bus lurched forward, hurling passengers from their seats. Soon people started screaming, including me, but unlike them, I decided to stop Ahmed from killing us all. I lunged at the transparent shield enclosing him. The bus careened into sedans, smashing through vehicles, veering onto the freeway. I opened the shield and grabbed the wheel, fighting for control as passengers’ terrified screams filled the bus.



“Stop, Ahmed! This is not the way to do it!” I hollered on top of my lungs, but he wouldn’t listen, and jerked the wheel hard to the right slamming into another bus. It flipped on its side, skidding along the right shoulder. Panic and fear surged through me, but I remembered the pepper spray I always kept in my pocket for emergencies. And today, it came in handy. I sprayed Ahmed’s face just as the bus barreled toward a trailer, yanking him out of his seat. Grabbing the wheel, I slammed on the brakes, bringing the bus to a screeching halt, inches from death. As we came to a stop in the middle of the road, police sirens wailed, and squad cars surrounded the bus.



This had gone from bad to worse. The dead women were now threatening people I knew from work, including my regular bus driver. If they reach them, what will stop them from targeting my family, especially my best friend, Jenny and my soon to be husband, Kurt? I needed to warn them immediately. But first, I had to spend the night at the police station, locked in a small, windowless room, flanked by two seasoned, grumpy detectives. I didn’t say anything about the dead women, but they did bring them up during the questioning.



“You still don’t know why your co-workers and some strangers would want to do you harm, Martie?” One of them asked, staring straight into my eyes.



“To tell you the truth sir, I am completely flabbergasted myself as to the events that occurred today,” I replied, trying hard not to reveal the reasons behind the attack.



“They, meaning your attackers, including the bus driver—seemed to have come into contact with “ghostly women”. And somehow their families were threatened by them if they didn’t stop you from getting married,” the second detective inquired, trying to stop himself from laughing.



I acted as if I didn’t know what he was talking about and remained mum about the entire thing. They released me later that night to my parents who had hurried to the police station.



The night was very tense as my parents peppered me with questions about why anyone would want to hurt me, to prevent my wedding from happening. My father, Todd, used this occasion to disparage Kurt, arguing that Kurt must’ve been behind the attack because he didn’t have the guts to tell me that he didn’t love me anymore. While my mother, Gina, who loved Kurt, defended him, and chastised my dad for sullying his name without any proof. I didn’t want Kurt to know about all of this. I feared that he’d force me to reveal what I knew, and then, ditched me as a crazy person who deserved to spend her time in a hospital. But what choice did I have? Sooner or later, I’d be forced to tell Kurt the truth.



My mother embraced me and whispered to my ears as my dad walked away. “The dead came to me, Martie. They say… Kurt’s a cannibal.
