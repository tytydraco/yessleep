Hello. I am First Lieutenant Jameis Adderday. I am logging this message in the vain hope that it will reach /*someone* across some sort of channel. I’m sending out a bevy of these, so on the off chance your reading this, PLEASE try to establish contact. If you’re military, don’t bother to read any of this; Pass it on to the head of special projects at Eglin AFB. 

<IF YOU ARE A CIVILIAN, DO NOT APPROACH ANYONE WITH THIS. TRY TO COMMUNICATE BACK FIRST. BLUNTLY, THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE YOU’LL BE DISAPPEARED IMMEDIATELY.> 

I won’t have that on my conscience. Not even now. 

I should explain what’s going on. I am an astronaut with the U.S. army. I am one of the most experienced astronauts currently serving, and as such I was selected for a very secretive project. If you’re thinking aliens, don’t get your hopes up. In truth, it may be a bit more fantastical if that’s possible - which I suppose it is.

I am a team lead of Project Leapfrog. A schoolyard name for a quite dire assignment: The truth is, Earth is sick. The bad kind of sick, the kind that us humans don’t come back from. Quite a few decades ago we got concrete data that the damage done to Earth’s climate is not just irreparable, but catastrophic. 

We’re talking end of times shit - pardon my language - with a doomsday clock that’ll hit zero in about a quarter century. Yeah. I know that’s a lot to take in, so if you need a moment take it. For reasons you’ll soon learn, it’s not like I’m going anywhere.

Ready to keep going? Good. Project Leapfrog represents the cutting edge of not just American tech but Europe and bits of Asia too. A collaborative project that’s managed to be kept under wraps better even than the Manhatten Project. The ultimate goal is to find some way off Earth, and fast. 

We found that way pretty fast. See, the USA, shockingly, has a LOT of technology that not even most senior government officials know about - let alone the general public. It’s to the point that the DOD have quite an arsenal of goodies that wouldn’t be out of place in a sci-fi flick.

Naturally, we found out how to do faster-than-light travel. /*Way faster*. Fast enough to get us to an exoplanet that could be habitable. I won’t bore you with state secrets, but the basic idea is that something called a “celestial whip” can be affixed to a ship. It’s not a literal whip, but it’s function is similar in principle. The whip basically grabs a planet and uses it to sling a spaceship forward at unfathomable speeds. Again, don’t take it literally. I could sit here and explain the decades of research and construction that went into building the damn thing, but this text doc would be about as long as the Bible; a good deal harder to follow, too.

Point being, I’m in command of a team of 5 - including me - that are operating a “whip ship.” There are two other crews in identical craft with the same target in mind. Failure is not an option, and so the eggheads tried to stack up as much redundancy as possible so /*someone* would make it.

Upon reaching our target exoplanet we simply drop a beacon. It’ll use a bit more secret technology to send a message pretty quick, giving our boys on Earth the go ahead to launch some colony ships. Those can’t utilize whips, but cryostasis has made some great strides - largely thanks to contributions from Walt Disney, oddly. Guess he wanted to survive too, but he came into the world a bit too early.

If you’re still following along, know that this isn’t meant to be a suicide mission. It wouldn’t be difficult to whip back to Earth after dropping the beacon and assuring the planet is suitable.

Anyways, sorry I had to jaw at you awhile (type at you?). I know it’s a lot of info to get dumped in your lap. Now we get to the crux of this message, and why - if you’re a civvy - you’re getting access to secrets that /*should* warrant your immediate imprisonment. 

Our mission is not going well. I can’t speak for the other two crews, and I hope to God they are still en route. We, however, are quite lost. Lost might not even be the right word, I’m not sure.

Three days and ten hours ago from today we fell out of space. I know that sounds ludicrous, or maybe you don’t even understand what that means. I don’t blame you. We don’t know what the hell is going on either.

Our /*current* understanding is that somehow travelling faster than the speed of light broke something about how space fundamentally works. One minute we were cruising along at a speed that looks ugly even in scientific notation, the next all of our sensors flipped out and the ship came to a dead halt. Thankfully we had a protective measure against sudden stoppages, but it shouldn’t have happened. Obviously.

Having analysed some of the ships reports, it’s quite odd. Hell to that, it’s terrifying. We are in an area of space with no stars, no navigable sources of light or gravity at all. Fucking nothing. The sensors aren’t broken, they’re actually surprisingly intact considering the circumstances.

To be clear, I don’t mean we’re in an empty patch of space. There’s a lot of those, and I’d be wasting your time and mine by whining about it. No, I mean there’s literally nothing in any direction. Our sensors reach far enough and detect enough different inputs that such silence simply isn’t possible. No “it shouldn’t be,” it is factually, completely impossible. You just have to ignore the fact that it happened. 

There’s no contact with the other crews of course, nor anyone from Earth.

The current theory is that we fundamentally misunderstood how light interacts with the universe. There may have been a very good reason light peaked at such a specific, metered speed. A blistering speed, but specific and quite clearly not the fastest possible. 

I say that to say, we suspect we tore through a sort of “weave” of dark matter. It’s possible that we actually punctured a hole through the universe and came out on the other side - as stupid as that sounds. Our manipulation of gravity and speed might not have been sustainable, to word it clumsily. Obviously this is all gross speculation, but there’s precious little data to consult. 

Hell, for all I know we ripped a hole in space and created a black hole or some other catastrophe. It’s killing me, having zero clue what’s going on in the /*entire universe*. Not one data point to act on.

Sending this message out is a desperate hail mary, and it might get me killed if my crew somehow gets back to Earth. Still, I’d rather die on American soil than in some sarcophagus at the bottom of a universal abyss. Not to mention, if this mission fails then we’re all dead. I’ll just be going a couple decades early. 

Say something obvious? It’s fucking eerie here. Crew morale is bad, because of course, and we have little and less time to work with as supplies get used up. I can hold things together for a time, but we’re all treading unknown water. It’s hard to offer reassurance when I’m a loud noise away from shitting my pants at any given moment. Not that there’s any noises - might even welcome a noise and a warm pile in my pants, if it meant learning anything about any of this.

Our current plan is to send someone out on a space walk - likely my right-hand, Staff Sergeant Jeffords. Due to the extreme conditions a whip ship goes through, it has no windows. No cameras would survive the speed without such thick casing you couldn’t see anything. The only way to see off the ship is by getting out - barring abstract ways of “seeing” through the ship data. Which, as I’ve said, is offering nothing at the moment.

Well, okay. That’s not entirely true. Assuming this is a civilian, I didn’t want to cause alarm until you’d gotten through most of what I had to say. At least, as little alarm as possible. Not calling you a coward, I just know how absurd this all is.

But we did get two data points. At 07:40 this morning a massive heat signature spiked about seven miles behind our ship. Our sensors are advanced enough they could narrow down the temperature range to an almost needless decimal place. The odd part? It was about the right temperature for a human, which is quite the baffling coincidence. Especially considering the signature dwarfed our ship multiple times over in size. To be frank, I’m not sure I’m up for believing in coincidences at the moment.

That’s part of why Jeffords is going out; the heat signature dissipated almost instantly, only to reappear three miles in front of us at 10:33. The corker is that the hear signature had split into three distinct bundles, all just as large, that were all at a balmy 99 degrees, roughly. They just sat there for a few minutes before vanishing as quick as they’d come. 

If you’re reading this, I again implore you to try and establish contact. If this message can get out, it’s possible messages can come in. We haven’t heard anything, but it’s possible a certain frequency or internet channel could work. Say it how it is, I’m grasping for straws. But I have no other choice.

One more time, for the cheap seats. This is First Lieutenant Adderday. We are lost outside of space, and desperately need help. There’s no stars, no nothing. Just us and a strange anamoly lurking in the ether. Damn my pride, this is Jameis Adderday and I’m really fucking /*scared*.
