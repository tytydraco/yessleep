The letter was just there. No return address, no knock at the door, nothing. It was late one night roughly a week ago and I woke up thirsty, so I went into my kitchen to grab some water. To say that my apartment is small is an understatement. After the few months I had lived there I could navigate it with my eyes closed and that night I was doing just that. The only break in the darkness was the red glow of the stove as it displayed the time. I didn’t bother to check, I knew it was late. All I wanted was a cold glass of water.



After practically inhaling it I turned to my sink to place my cup inside but a piece of parchment caught my eye. Right in the middle of the empty table, save a spoon and some crumpled napkins from dinner, was an envelope. Even in my tired state I knew this was strange as I couldn’t recall that being there before I had gone to bed. When even was the last time I got mail? I picked it up and started to inspect it for any identifiable information. There wasn’t anything I could see, just a blank old yellowed envelope that was oddly cold to touch. Like it had been shoved in someone's freezer. It was odd, but I was too tired to care at the time, however I wasn’t tired enough to put it down.



Opening the letter, I grabbed and pulled out a single piece of paper that was also yellowed and cracked in places. Unfolding it I found that it was filled with all sorts of strange drawings and symbols. To me they looked like some hieroglyphic language from Egypt or the like, but what did I know? The symbols I could at least tell what they were was a spiral, a staff, and finally a skull which I assumed belonged to a predator based on its sharp incisors. The glyphs were drawn with something similar to charcoal charcoal but it looked wrong. It had the right texture when I ran my fingers over it, but it was darker and runny somehow, almost like oil. I leaned closer to get a whiff of it because why not and breathed in some of the excess dust. Instantly my throat felt like particles of glass were fighting to see who could travel the deepest, I bent over coughing and hacking so hard that I was beginning to see white spots in my vision, and before I knew it I had collapsed on my kitchen floor and the lights went out.



Waves were crashing behind me and I was buffeted by the scent of salt and something else, something that smelled old like a leather shoe, and rancid. I made an attempt to turn only to realize, like a statue, I was firmly held in place. I could only stare forward and move my eyes some. Around me, I noticed sand that glistened like diamonds, they were so clear that it almost hurt to look at. Luckily there was some cloud cover overhead that blocked the sun because I’m sure if that wasn’t the case the refraction of light off the sand would have cooked me through. Further past the shoreline were trees that looked burned and charred which didn’t pair well with the lively green leaves. 



Then the leaves began to move and shift. There was a good breeze blowing, but to the leaves, it seemed optional for them to follow its path. Some appeared to practically spin around in circles contradicting the leaf right next to it  spinning the opposite way. Others waved like water, rippling impossibly, or sputtered and sparked like flames. Pain began to blossom behind my eyes the more I watched so I went back to staring at the small refined crystals at my feet. I began trying to make sense of where I was or what might be happening but couldn’t, my head felt cloudy and closed off like trying to look through frosted glass to read a page out of a book. There was a light rocky crunch behind me. My muscles tightened. Then there was another footfall, a little closer this time. I tried to move but my concrete limbs rejected the idea. I strained as hard as I could which ended up exacerbating the pain in my head. This fruitless fight continued all the way up until I felt some of the sand brush my ankles as two feet landed right behind me.



A cold sweat began to break out on my forehead and my stomach started kneading itself into knots. Warm air tickled the back of my neck. A small squeal managed to squeeze itself past my lips. Then the smell hit me; it was rotten, like roadkill that had baked in the sun for a week and was filled with maggots. It was a test of will to hold my breath in order to keep the bile threatening to rise down. 



Old rattling laughter began to sound behind me. It was horse and gravely, and it somehow encompassed me and made me feel like an insect in front of a rhino. I began again frantically trying to force my body to move, every muscle I had was straining beyond belief but still I got no reprieve. Eventually I exhausted myself and felt myself shrink back into being an obedient statue. I was out of options, and that thing was just standing behind me now. No longer laughing, or even breathing from what I could hear.



“Hello,” I muttered out, sounding like some whimpering animal.



There was a moment of stillness, then the air behind me shifted as something truly large moved and then, a hand rested itself on the back of my neck. Just the palm at first, then too-long fingers began to wrap all the way around my throat, stopping just shy of covering my adams apple. The fingers were slick and oily, there were also small tendrils of what; I didn’t want to think about, pressing into my flesh trying to burrow into me. Then at once it lifted off of me, the little tendrils making popping sounds as they loosened. 



The reprieve was only momentary. Next thing I knew there was a sharp and pointed jabbing into my spine right at the base of my neck that seared like molten metal where it entered my body.



I woke up screaming. 



Luckily it was almost morning because after that there wasn’t any hope of returning to sleep. I had two classes that day that passed by in a blur. My body felt as if someone had taken a spoon to my head and scraped my insides out. The rest of the day was spent in the same fashion. I got home, didn’t have the stomach to eat anything and then spent the rest of the evening in bed. The next day however, I felt right as rain, like nothing had happened. And the next day, I barely even thought about the dream or the paper. Soon, a whole week had passed. 



I still had the letter. When I woke up and regained a little bit of my senses I had found it folded up neatly sitting on the floor near where I had taken my involuntary nap. My logical brain told me that there was no way a note with pictures could do that but the lizard part of my brain was whispering that something was up so I hadn’t opened it all week.



Finally on a Saturday morning I decided to take another peek. I gave myself the whole pep talk about being a man and worked up some courage and grabbed the note. My hands shook a little as my fingers grabbed the edge of the folded paper. Then after whispering a silent prayer I pulled it open. My eyes had closed somewhere in this process and I was mentally chastising myself before finally taking a peek.



My brows furrowed. The page that had been filled with strange, arcane drawings and symbols was now blank. I rubbed my eyes, then turned the page over and over expecting to see a hint of the old charcoal writing, but nothing. Not even a speck of the black dusting that had been on the page. I put the paper back down, laughed a little at my own expense, folded it back up, then the next day threw it out.



Another week went by and I had practically forgotten the note. The only reminders were when I would catch a scent of something rotten and feel a phantom of that decayed breath tickle the back of my neck.



I was up early one morning getting ready to go to class. I was reaching for the door when something slightly yellow caught my eye. The door handle began to rattle slightly before I removed my hand. At first, I tried to reason with myself, surely it was just a yellow plate, or a pot, I would have taken anything other than what I was positive was sitting on my stove. Slowly I turned to it. I blinked a few times to make sure I was seeing correctly. There it was, another envelope was resting on my stove, ancient and yellow, just like the last. I walked over to it. Why I did what I did next I couldn’t say. I just felt like I had to. It was like something gripped me and I became no more than a marionette. 



I couldn’t stop myself. Before I even registered what was happening I was already holding the paper, the scent of ash hit me. I knew what I would see if I opened it, and my body did it anyway.



Familiar waves crashed behind me. A similar scene was laid out before me. There were a few differences however. It was dark out now, unlike the foggy gray of before. I could only see now thanks to a large moon overhead, one much bigger than I was used to seeing. A purple moon pockmarked with truly gargantuan craters that put the moon's battered surface to shame. It was absolutely stunning. I lost myself just taking it in for a while until a subtle scent wafted in on a breeze. My moment of admiration was ruined as my heart began to jackhammer.



The visibility was terrible, just the faint outline of the forest painted against a background devoid of anything. I tried to walk and couldn’t, like last time my legs felt bolted down by an unseen force. However, I did notice I could turn my head slightly. I looked from side to side, not seeing anyone. I was grateful but I knew that I wasn’t in the clear with the scent lingering in my surroundings. It was heavy and awful and seemed to permeate my skin and dig into my body with each inhale. 



I could just barely make out the small waves crashing behind me. It seemed that this was some kind of beach. Definitely not the build a whole resort on kind. It stretched on and on into the distance. I couldn’t tell where it ended. Little glimmers of purple shone out in the darkness creating false stars on the ground where the moon's light reflected on the grains of crystalline sand. 



The water was dark, seemingly pitch black and it didn’t look quite like water either. There wasn’t any reflective qualities to it like you would normally see on a beach. The water looked and rolled onto the beach more like oil than anything. Utterly absorbing in the moon's light before diving deep down into the sand and slowly pulling back out into the sea to repeat the same process over and over again. 



“Strange, isn’t it?” a voice that wasn’t mine sounded behind me as a wave of fetid air hit my back.



I stilled, my back muscles pulled together so hard that if I wasn’t frozen in place my shoulders would be touching. My eyes and head turned attempting to see who was speaking but couldn’t quite turn far enough. A chuff of amusement came from behind.



“Do you want to see me that bad…human? I can assure you that you would come to regret that decision,” he chuckled, a deep grating sound, “my visage invokes reactions that aren't suitable for minds like yours.”



After a moment of silent contemplation I managed to ask, “Are you the one sending me these letters?”



“What letters?” He asked in almost a sing-song voice before a deep guttural laugh cut through the night. The air was growing thicker with the acrid stench.



“Ohh, you mean those little old things. I suppose you could say I’m sending them to you if you wish, though that’s not entirely true.”



“What do you mean?”



“I guess your story must be at least a little bit interesting,” he paused and I heard a scratching sound,  “or you will be able to create one that is.”



He stopped speaking and I was growing tired, I tried to think about what he might mean but the harder I thought the more pain erupted in my mind just behind my eyes. I knew that my life wasn’t that exciting, in fact the only interesting thing to happen since I started school were these letters. I’d call myself pretty average honestly, just going through the motions of life, or at least I was. 



“Hmmm,” he mused and I felt a hand rest on the nape of my neck, “I suppose a little look-see won’t hurt," I began to feel little pricks of ice on my flesh like small mouths latching onto me, they began to wiggle and writhe, "Ohh, and one more thing before you go, why don’t you check out a library sometime? You might find some insight there," he paused, "or not.” Boisterous laughter cut into the night, it was so loud and cruel.



I opened my mouth again to speak but didn't get anything out before a line of molten fire pierced my body and my eyes burst open back in my kitchen where I promptly cried out in agony. The pain lingered, it wasn’t like this last time. 



I ran to the bathroom and splashed some cold water on my face. I looked gaunt and pale like some of my soul had been sucked out of me. My back was on fire so I rotated slightly and froze.



Just at the bottom, right where my neck met the collar of my shirt was an angry red [X](https://www.reddit.com/r/SoullessHQ/) right over my spine.
