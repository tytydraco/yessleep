There is something so mysterious about the ocean. Its scale is beyond the comprehension of the human mind. Many find it soothing, but for others it is terrifying. I find myself experiencing a mix of the two feelings when I go out on the open waters, and this conflict becomes even stronger when I dive under the surface and stare into the beautiful abyss below.

I've been cave diving for a while now. Sometimes I saw beauties that a dive camera could never hope to do justice. Other times, I saw nothing at all, encased in total black with only my headlight to guide me through muddy and silted-out waters. While I was always aware of the danger involved, that sense of adventure has always kept me moving on to the next thing, each time a deeper or more obscure cave.

I ended up at the local library one day – not something I had done since my childhood, at least. I can’t really explain why; it’s just that I felt a tug. Something powerful pulled me that way – an unseen hand guiding you in ways you can always feel but never define. Some may call it fate but, after the experiences I have gone through, I am convinced that fate itself has no say in the matter.

I was browsing the science and technology section, glazing over many of the books there in search of something… Well, I wasn’t quite sure what. The word ‘inspiring’ comes to mind. Suddenly my eyes rested on something that stuck out, something I thought ought not to be there. It was an old, crusty-looking tome. It was thick and appeared sturdy, yet it was clear that the years had not been kind to it. A book like this had seen more than most people in their lifetime.

Immediately I felt the heat of excitement well up inside me as I carefully picked it from its spot. The book was ruined; this much was certain. It was weathered by time and had met with a large amount of water damage before finding its way into this humble library. So damaged was the tome that I was worried it would crumble to dust in my hands if I wasn’t careful. The cover was bare, except for the aged, flaking, once-black leather that adorned it. I opened it up to the first page and it was immediately clear to me that, once upon a time, this had been the journal of a traveller – not unlike the ones I had been so fond of throughout my life. Although much of the text was faded or smudged, written in large letters in the upper-middle of the page I could make out a partial name of the original owner.

“Propriété de : Philippe Dubuis”

I closed the journal. My heart raced as I knew that this is what I had come for. I had to get this home as soon as possible. I scurried to the front desk and presented it to the clerk, a portly woman in her early 50s. She frowned when I presented it to her, with a look on her face like I was a cat who had brought a dead bird into her kitchen. She informed me that this book was definitely not one of theirs, that something like this would have been thrown out years before. Luckily for me, that also meant I was free to take it.

Before I knew it, I was at home. I didn’t even remember the walk there. I was so excited, thinking about reading the journal, that I barely noticed anything else. When I got inside, I sat it down on the dining room table and began to read. Most of the journal was illegible, and what I could read, I found very difficult to understand due to my less than stellar French skills.

It started off innocently enough. Dupuis was a boat captain and enjoyed taking his family out to sea at various places around the world. I felt some connection with him, actually. We shared that sense of adventure and a closeness to the deep blue. He wrote of travelling on their yacht, a small yet rather well-equipped vessel that could even take him across open waters. For the most part, the contents equated to a diary. Interesting as it was, I couldn’t help but feel there was something deeper inside. I read and read until eventually coming to almost the very end. It was then that the tone of the writing changed completely.

The final entry was a hand-drawn map of an archipelago off the coast of Africa, an island nation called the Comoros. Just off the east coast of the southernmost island was a large “X” excitedly scratched into the paper. As with the rest of the text, it was difficult to make out. However there were two words I could very clearly read: “…cette grotte…” — this cave.

Despite my travels, this was one area that I was not so familiar with. Evidently, Dupuis had planned to seek something out there that was very interesting to him. He wrote of a calling, although the details were sparse and jumbled. Despite a practically obsessive interest, I don’t think even Dupuis himself could have said for sure what lay at the end of his journey. This was another thing I found I shared with the old captain because, the more I read, the more I found myself with the same ache the he must have felt before setting off on this adventure. The journal ended there. I wondered briefly if Dupuis had ever made it to his destination, though I decided it didn’t matter now as his story was over and mine was about to begin.

After doing some research, I found out some diving did indeed take place there. However, it was not particularly well known and especially not for cave diving. So, why then did I decide to make this my next destination? What in the world could have inspired me to venture off into the unknown, where I may not even find anything at all? I’m afraid I don’t have a logical answer to that which would satisfy anyone but the most mad among us. What I can say is that I could not resist the pull of a current I could not yet identify but which knew me perhaps better than I knew myself.

Six months later, after settling my affairs and getting everything ready, I was off. I didn’t make much of a timeline for the trip, but I figured I had about a month before funds would start to become an issue.

I arrive to my hotel, a humble but welcoming 3-star hotel called the Océanis, in the afternoon after a long and 24-hour journey. Although my body was drained, I felt determined and did not want to waste any time to sleep. Later in the evening, after unpacking and a quick shower I took a walk to the Ancien Port de Domoni. It is a well-known and central hub on the city’s shore, which still had people bustling and boats coming in even at the late hour. By this time the sun had long since set, but the beckoning ocean waters were lit up by the light of the city, creating a glimmer on the rippling waves that had undeniable beauty and endless charm.

As I stood there, taking everything in, a young fisherman walked past. He craned his neck back as he went past, clearly considering my foreignness a novelty. He introduced himself as Youssouf and asked what I was doing there. In broken French, I answered honestly and told him of my plan. The conversation lumbered due to my poor skills, but he was able to understand me. At the mention of underwater caves, he took a particular interest and enquired about where I wanted to go. I showed him a copy of the map I had made from Dupuis’ journal with the rough location I wanted to search. He nodded slowly before making an offer on the spot. He would take me around on his boat for a small retainer per day, acting as my chaperone. I knew the value of having a local and experienced navigator, so I offered him a greater sum to help with some of my diving equipment as well as be on lookout in case anything went wrong. The deal was struck and the plan was set. We were to leave at 6 AM the following morning.

Together we scoured the shore for the next eight days. I didn’t know what exactly I was looking for, but I would know it when I saw it. At that point I was seriously questioning myself. The childlike wonder that had brought me out there was running out, and the stars in my eyes were beginning to dull. Getting desperate, I asked Youssouf to take me out much further than usual. We had travelled a good 4 hours away by boat when I suddenly told him to stop. The water was very clear out there, and a smorgasbord of colour below the surface could not help but catch my eye. Feeling some excitement, I quickly donned my scuba gear and got in the water.

I eased in slowly, and with the first kick of my fins, my heart started to race. I was suddenly drunk on a mystical sense of wonder. I felt that this is where I had to be. I looked to Youssouf, who was standing on the boat and regarding me with a steady smile. I gave him a thumbs up and began my dive.

The world below the surface was stunning; utterly serene. I was no stranger to open water diving even then, but the sight of this place in particular took my breath away like nothing before. There was an abundance of sea life of all shapes and sizes. The coral was surprisingly diverse, with a multitude of colours and shapes that created the landscape below. Aquatic plants were scattered between the clusters of the coral, and they seemed to wave at me under the subtle pull of the gentle ocean tide. A plethora of fishes swam about in different directions, some circling around me as if interested in this new visitor they found in their home. It was a whole world, unseen by humanity, on an arbitrary plateau off a random piece of the Comorian coast. This was surely the place Dupuis had written of; I was certain of that. However, I had come here for a cave, and yet I still had not found one.

I inched my way downwards, taking care not to disturb the natural inhabitants as much as possible. At the edge of the pleasant setting, there was a sharp drop-off into an inky abyss below. I paused. Something gripped me in that moment, looking into the massive nothingness. I had to quiet my nerves. A panicked mind would be no good for navigating anything, least of all the uncharted.

Suddenly my eyes snapped ahead, and immediately my anxiety was stripped away. Directly ahead of me, almost close enough to touch, was a most curious school of fish hovering over the edge of the drop-off. There were too many of them to count, at least a couple dozen, all of different colours, shapes, sizes, and even entirely different species. More bizarre than that, they were swimming, slowly and deliberately, in a clear figure of eight. I am a diver not an expert on sea life, but before then and to this day I have never heard of such a thing occurring. Yet, here they were, swimming persistently around each other and entirely unalarmed by my presence. The school was moving in an enormous pattern, but I’d had no idea of their presence until that moment. It was like the hypnotist's hand snapping me to reality. Already, I had found something that I knew most people, even the most experienced divers, would have never seen before.

The smallest of the group, a tiny blue one with a curved fin, swam right up to my face and seemed to regard me directly. I was surprised and somewhat entranced by the bravery of this tiny creature. I reached out my hands, expecting it to swim away immediately, but it held fast. I cupped it in my hands, cradling its whole life. I had such power over this small fish. I could crush it if I wanted – that wasn’t what I wanted, was it? I felt my grip begin to tighten before catching myself and pulling back sharply from the fish in shock. I had lost myself for a second., my head being somewhere else altogether. I didn’t want to hurt this beautiful creature. It was far too precious for that. The fish continued to regard me coolly, seemingly unbothered.

It started to swim away slowly before stopping, turning, and regarding me again. A voice within me said, “Follow,” and I obeyed. As soon as I started to move, the school dispersed abruptly, causing violent fluctuations in the water all around me. I blinked, and when I opened my eyes again, they were nowhere to be found. The only one remaining was the singular tiny, blue fish which still seemed to be staring at me, beckoning. I continued to move towards it, my heart beating deep within my chest. The fish then turned and quickly disappeared over the edge.

I kept my dive light fixed on the wall as I followed behind, slowly and deliberately descending into the waters below, anticipating the light of the sun fading as I went down. I adjusted my buoyancy control device cautiously, taking care to keep within arm's reach of the wall for the sake of guidance. I didn’t want to plunge into the darkness haphazardly, but at the same time I couldn’t lose sight of my aquatic guide. I almost thought it had vanished until I saw an illuminated speck hovering in the void. It was indeed the fish from before, and it was lighting up the water around it with a soft and soothing glow. I was drawn to it like a moth to flame. I had never seen anything like this before. At this point I definitely did not want to lose it so I started descending faster and faster. The glow of the fish seemed to increase the further we went down. At it’s brightest, it shone as powerfully as a flare in the night sky.

Onwards we went, lower and lower. I could barely contain myself, the seconds dragging on for hours. After what felt like forever, I noticed that the piercing blue light had stopped moving, and I was now swiftly approaching it. I expected to have to shield my eyes from the intensity as I drew nearer, but it was quite the opposite. The light seemed to soften, such that the blue serenity cast the bleakness surrounding it in an icy, yet embracing tone. In the centre of it all, I found my guide motionless and regarding me as it had done before. Suddenly, I felt myself take a shocked breath in. It had stopped near the wall I had come down from, and, through its glow, I could just barely make out the edges of an indentation in the wall's surface. I had found it. This is what I had come all this way for. Logic be damned, I knew in my soul that this was where I was meant to be. Resolved, I was ready to truly begin my journey.
