“I’m not putting this ice pick through my eye,” I explained with what I hoped was a tone of finality. 

Dirty Santa cocked his head. “Why not?”

My jaw sagged. I didn’t know how to answer that; every instinct told me that the action was simply impossible. I couldn’t mutilate myself even if I wanted to do so. The self-preservation drive was just too strong.

“[Are you saying that you want to switch your gift back](https://redd.it/zzv8x5)?” he pressed as a line of drool sagged from his lips. 

“NO!” screamed the man in the black suit. “No,” he continued, his voice trembling. “You – you said that - that there were no switch-backs, cor-correct?” 

Santa looked at the trembling man like he was a rare zoo animal. 

“So he’s stuck with the… I mean, I’m not the one who has to put that – that *thing* in my eye.”

Dirty Santa folded his arms. “Then play with your clippers.”

The suited man stared down at the garden tool in his lap, his whole body trembling. “I – I can’t-”

“Do it now, or you get the ice pick,” Santa pressed in a singsong voice.

I was sure he wouldn’t do it.

Even as he picked up the garden clippers, I didn’t believe that a man could chop off his own finger like it was a flower head.

Even as he lifted the tool with a shaking hand, I refused to accept it. The twine bonds allowed just enough slack for him to reach his fingers, but not enough to cut the strands on his wrists. But surely he would *try* to escape. Right?

I didn’t believe that a man could cut off a live body part. I told myself that his choice to slide his fingertip between the blades was just for show.

I stared at his eyes the whole time, waiting for him to blink. Even as his pupils constricted to pinpricks and blood vessels in his eyes popped, staining the white with ugly splotches of red, all I could think was “this is impossible.” It wasn’t until I digested the sheer determination in his gaze as he stared unwaveringly forward, never closing his eyes as he screamed loud enough to hurt my ears, unaffected by the mist of blood and drool that permeated the air around him, that I accepted how much we were all going to hurt. 

The screams melted into gurgled sobs. Those rose back into screams as Dirty Santa used a red-hot iron to cauterize the open wound. 

I don’t know if talking about this is helping. I just downed two more Valium, because the memory of his screaming will bounce around my skull until I go back to sleep. 

At any rate, that’s when I saw the ice pick in a new light. It was frighteningly sharp, and must stomach flipped as I realized that sharp was better than dull. I tried to catch my breath, but I couldn’t. Hyperventilation squeezed my chest like a living thing, and I prayed that I would pass out. 

“That’s a beautiful long, thin, 19.13-inch ice pick, but our friend isn’t being thankful for his gift,” Dirty Santa huffed. “Let’s see what it means to be appreciative! You’re up next, friend! Maybe you’ll steal his present and teach him about gratitude!”

I realized through a distant light-headedness that Santa was speaking to Jerry. He responded by reaching for the largest present, a gray box with black ribbon, and struggled to open it with his arms restricted.

My panic was finally abating as Jerry pulled enough of the paper away to reveal a small can of gasoline. 

Jerry looked down at the note and read it aloud: “Take a shower in me.”

With a clatter, a cigarette lighter hit the floor.

My lungs stopped working as absolute clarity settled in my mind. I no longer had the luxury of delaying my choice through panic; if I didn’t act within the next few seconds, the outcome would be decided for me. 

Jerry was realizing the same thing. “I’d – I’d like to switch,” he called in a hoarse whisper. “I’d like to switch now, please. I’m choosing the ice pick.”

“No,” the blonde woman sitting across from me said. “I’ll take the ice pick before I even choose the next gift.” Her voice sounded like it was coming from underwater, but I understood every word with painful clarity. 

The college girl next to her just sobbed. 

“Our friend wants to break the rules,” Dirty Santa hissed. “He doesn’t want to play with his toy, even though it was switched fair and *square*.”

I peered over at the man in the black suit. He was no longer crying. Instead, he leaned back in his chair, staring at the ceiling without blinking. His skin was the color of paper. 

“Fine,” Santa huffed at me. “You want to break the rules? You get the gasoline.”

Time turned sideways in that moment, slowing down and rushing by all at once. I knew I had to act immediately or not at all, and that the rest of my life would hinge upon my decision.

So there was no more time for thinking. 

It’s amazing to see what we’re capable of doing when we have no choice but to act.

“Please don’t leave me with the gasoline,” Jerry sobbed. “I thought we were friends.”

Ignoring him, I pivoted the ice pick upward, staring at its sharp tip, and marveled at the steadiness of my own hand. Then I took three quick, shallow breaths, opened my eyes wide, and plunged my head downward.

--------

The valium’s finally kicking in, but the screams haven’t abated yet. If anything, they’re worse. I hope that exorcising these memories is a way to heal, because so far, reliving them just enhances my pain. 

I still look back in disbelief at the fact that I made it out of that room.

Of course, from a certain point of view, I never really did, and I never really will.
