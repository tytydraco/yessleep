I do not know if these words will reach their hands into the eyes of a reader. I do not know if these servers are flooded, their cables drowned in salt and ruin. 

Maybe I am whispering to ghosts in the pitch of night.

Maybe that is God’s mercy.

But if you are still out there—if your lungs still drag in the sour air of what remains—then listen. Please listen.

I was on maternity leave when the world rotted.

My body still aches from birth. My stomach was soft and swollen in the places that no longer held her. My skin felt too loose, stretched by something no longer inside me. A ghost of her remained in the shape of me.

And my milk had come in.

The pressure—God’s above, the pressure. My body had not yet learned what my heart already knew. There was no child at my breast. No warmth curled into me, no tiny fingers wrapped around my ringless hand. Just absence.

She was still in the NICU.

Breathing through plastic, her ribs rising and falling like the wings of a crushed butterfly. The nurses assured me she was strong. That babies born too soon had a way of clawing their way into this world, of demanding space when they had been given so little time to prepare.

But she was small. So, so small.

And I had been discharged without her.
Because I was healthy. Because my lungs worked. Because my blood pressure was stable and my stitches were healing. Because there was no space in a sterile world for grieving mothers with working lungs.

So I left.

My brother, Hawthorn, picked me up in his sleek, too-clean 2010 Honda. The kind of car that still smelled new, always freshly waxed, always maintained, because Hawthorn was not a man who let things decay.

He did not say much.

He never had.

He drove, and I sat in the passenger seat, cradling the breast pump the nurses had handed me on my way out, as if a machine could replace the weight of her.

The city passed by in a blur of glass panes and steel beams, of metal bus stops and cement sidewalks, of bright fast food signs and dull power lines stretching toward a sky that would never belong to us.

It had rained that morning. The streets glistened like an oil spill, neon lights reflected in puddles like electric blood.

I pressed my forehead to the window.

“I don’t need you to talk,” I said.

Hawthorn huffed. “Good.”

And that was it.

That was how we drove home.

Me in the passenger seat, full of milk and mourning, and him at the wheel, hands steady, jaw tight.

Neither of us knowing that by morning, the sky would fall.

And nothing we had built would survive.

The treehouse smelled of sawdust and wood stain when I returned.

The kind of scent that clung to the walls, soaked into the furniture, buried itself beneath my fingernails no matter how many times I scrubbed my hands raw. 

Hawthorn’s hands had built this house. Every beam, every floorboard, every joint and seam. His calloused fingers had shaped the wood, carved the edges, sanded the splinters down until they were smooth as water-polished stone.

And yet, it was still unfinished.

Piles of lumber leaned against the walls, stacks of planks waiting for purpose. Shelves stood half-built, cabinets missing hinges, doors propped in corners like forgotten ghosts. A staircase led nowhere, a second floor nothing but raw beams and an open sky.

He had planned to finish them before the baby came home.

She was not home.

Her room was half-built like the rest of the house. The crib sat against an unpainted wall, still wrapped in plastic, the mattress stacked neatly beside it. There was a mobile, too—handmade, carved from scraps of mahogany and maple. Tiny wooden birds and flowers, sanded smooth, waiting to turn in a breeze that would never come.

The dresser was empty. No onesies folded into neat rows. No tiny socks waiting to be worn.

I had spent months preparing for her. Washing her clothes in scent-free detergent, folding them carefully, pressing my fingers into the soft fabric and wondering what she would smell like.

Would she smell like me? Like milk and warmth and sleep?

Or would she smell like the sterile air of the NICU?

Would she even know my scent?

I should have been home with her, swaddled in my arms, pressed against my chest where she belonged. But she was still there, in a hospital bassinet, beneath the hum of machines, breathing through plastic.

I stood in the doorway of her unfinished nursery, my arms crossed tightly over my stomach, aching in a way no painkiller could fix.

Hawthorn’s voice pulled me back.

“You should eat something.”

I turned. He stood in the hallway, arms crossed, shoulders broad enough to fill the frame of the door. His eyes flickered to the breast pump still clutched in my hands. He didn’t comment on it.

I exhaled slowly. “I’m not hungry.”

He nodded once, like he expected that answer, then jerked his head toward the kitchen. “I’ll leave something out for you anyway.”

And then he walked away, disappearing down the hall, his steel-toe boots heavy against the wooden floor.

That night, I was on the deck, curled into the warped wood of a chair that had endured one too many winters, my fingers wrapped around a chipped ceramic mug. A sticky ring sat on one of the many coasters dotting the table before me, the lemon balm tea long since lukewarm.

Above me, the moon hung swollen. It loomed low, too low, its surface stretched tight as if it were a bruised fruit on the verge of splitting. Veins of light crept through its craters, its formations bulging. I tilted my head, squinting, trying to grasp its unnatural fullness.

Then, the realization tided over me.

The moon was too large. Far too large.

It was as if I had been staring at it for hours instead of seconds, blind to its obscene magnitude, until now. 

That was when the night popped.

A split amid the stars. It tore open, spilling across the horizon like flesh torn from bone. The sky peeled back, and that’s when it happened—

Shards of silver bled across the sky. They were not like meteors. These pieces, these fragments of the moon, they didn’t follow gravity’s tug. They hung in the air, as if the world had forgotten how to obey its own rules.

The impact ensued. A shift, as if reality itself had been waiting for some celestial trigger, some lost permission to crumble.

The ground heaved.

I barely had time to stand, to keep on my feet, before the very air twisted, warped, and tore itself asunder.

The moon’s fragments were no longer fragments—they shifted. Twisted. They morphed mid-fall, as though the hands twisted them in transit. Some hunched, contorting into jagged monoliths, jagged spires that thrust themselves into the earth, impaling the land with precision that could only be described as divine execution.

Others—others liquefied, melted into a molten mass upon impact—and the streets buckled beneath them. The streets… devoured. Steel and stone. Pavement and pride. All torn apart, devoured, consumed by rivers of burning light.

The smaller fragments speared the asphalt—their silver points piercing the earth as though they were setting a wound to bleed. They carved gaping, jagged wounds into the world—each one a scar. Silver rivulets followed their path. And with them, the air bent. It swirled into itself, twisting like an elongated serpent’s body—pulling the winds with it. The air itself warped, churning into an awful, wide arch of black, drawn into the heart of something far more terrible than I had the strength to understand.

And then—it came.

The voice.

Not from the sky. Not from above. No, it came from within. 

“YOUR HANDS ARE STAINED. YOUR BREATH, A POISON.”

And then, not with my eyes, but with my mind, I saw.

I saw the oceans—bloated, blackened, slick with oil.

I saw the forests—stripped, charred skeletons of trees, their ashes floating on the wind like diseased snowflakes, drifting in a world too tired to mourn.

I saw fields of plastic, stretching far and vast, reaching into the horizon where the sun blazed too hot, far too angry to be anything but vengeful. The world was sick. And it was every bit our fault. Every wound, every scar upon it, had been made by our hands. Our greed. Our ignorance. Our philosophy that we will be long gone when the effects finally show.

“NOW, THE EARTH RECLAIMS ITSELF.”

And it was then that I understood. There would be no mercy.

No salvation, no forgiveness, and certainly no haven or miracle.

We had been the poison. And now—now the world would purge itself. We had poisoned the earth, and the earth would rise up to wash us away.

The ground buckled. The pavement folded inward, swallowing itself whole in an insatiable groan for more. The buildings sank. They did not collapse, and it sure as hell was not an explosion. They were pulled down, sinking into the hungry, hungry world of Mother Nature.

The deck lurched beneath me.

The earth was caving in, from the weight of us.

I bent my knees, steadying myself on instinct. My tea mug wasn’t as lucky—it spun off the table, shattered against the warped wood, and was instantly swallowed by the widening cracks.

The treehouse was being reclaimed, becoming one with nature.

Hawthorn was inside.

I ran.

I didn’t stumble. My feet slammed against the deck as I hurled toward the doorway. I didn’t stop to think. I didn’t let my body realize it was too late.

The house let out a low, agonized groan. Wood strained, nails snapped, the walls curled inward.

“Hawthorn!”

My voice barely broke through the howling wind.

Then—the sound of the foundation tearing loose. A wet, sucking of earth peeling apart beneath us.

I hit the doorframe hard, shoulder-first, and kept moving. The house was tipping—the hallway already at an angle, the floor tilting beneath my feet as I threw myself up the stairs.

“Hawthorn!”

I didn’t wait for an answer.

I took the last three steps in a leap, bracing against the slanting walls. The ceiling cracked apart behind me. A black hole in the roof, a mouth yawning open to swallow us whole.

I slammed into his bedroom door. The world was falling sideways.

The floor jerked beneath me. Falling. 

Then—a hand.

Fingers like iron, yanking me forward, ripping me free from the pull of gravity.
Hawthorn’s grip was iron. The kind of grip that did not allow for failure. He was already acting. 

“Move!”

I moved.

I followed the force of his arm, let him shove me toward the door, let him haul me through collapsing walls and splintering beams.

The house wailed and screamed. The foundation buckled.

Hawthorn hit the ladder first.

He climbed like the world was chasing him. Because it was.

I didn’t dare to look down.

I caught the rung and pulled myself up, pushing past the burning in my arms, the ache in my ribs, the shaking in my legs. 

The moment my foot left the last step, the porch vanished beneath me—ripped away into the mouth of the earth.

Hawthorn reached down.

I grabbed his wrist.

He pulled.

I landed hard on the first platform, already pushing up, already reaching for the second ladder.

Hawthorn didn’t wait for me. 

I climbed. One rung, then another. The wind roared, thin-trunked trees corkscrewed, the ground kept folding itself inward, devouring what was left of our world.

Then—we were above it.

The unfinished second floor. Raw beams, half-nailed planks, a skeleton of a home still reaching for the sky.

I sucked in a breath, pressing my hands to my knees. 

Hawthorn turned, staring down at the wreckage below.

I remember dialing the hospital.

The line? Dead.

I sat down, knees to my chest. The unfinished floor dug into my skin, the raw wood biting into my palms. I just stared at the sky—the ruined, moonless sky that no longer belonged to us.

I didn’t sleep that first night.

Couldn’t.

Instead, I sat on the edge of what remained.

And I waited to feel human again.

Hawthorn worked. Of course he did.

The hammer swung in a steady rhythm. 

He didn’t pause to wipe the sweat streaking down his jaw, didn’t wince when he caught a splinter, didn’t falter when the wind howled through the skeletal beams of the unfinished floor.

I watched him.

He had always been like this.

Now, the sky falled, and Hawthorn was building anew. Because what else was he supposed to do? Afterall, humans were fickle and stubborn creatures, always repeating history.

I pulled the tarp tighter around my shoulders as he wiped his palm against his jeans and kicked his pack toward me. “Eat.”

His voice was low, gravel-rough. Like he had spent the last few hours biting down on every scream that wanted out.

I didn’t move.

His eyes flicked to me, assessing. 

“Heather.”

I let out a slow breath and unzipped the bag. Inside: vacuum-sealed packs, a half-empty bottle of water, protein bars, a sheathed hunting knife.

I took out a pack of dried mango and ripped it open with my teeth.

Hawthorn sat down across from me, his back to the unfinished railing. He pulled out a can of beans, stabbed it open with his pocket knife, and started eating in slow, measured bites. His knuckles were bruised. His jaw was clenched tight.

The silence between us was a wall.

I swallowed the too-sweet mango, forcing it down. “How bad?”

Hawthorn didn’t answer right away. He swallowed, set the can down, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.
“I walked the ridge.” His voice was steady. Like he was a meteorologist reporting on the weather. “Town’s gone.”

I pressed my lips together. Of course it was.

“The hospital?” I asked.

A long pause.

Hawthorn exhaled. “Not there anymore.”

My stomach folded in on itself.

“You don’t know that,” he said, quieter.
I laughed—short. A sound dry of humor. 

“Yeah. I do.”

He didn’t argue. He just picked up his can again and kept eating.

We sat there, chewing through the end of the world.

After a while, I set the mango down and pressed my palms into the floorboards. “So. What’s the plan, Bob the Builder?”

Hawthorn snorted. “Stay above ground. Reinforce. Build higher. If the water rises, we’ll need rain catches. If the ground sinks, we stay ahead of it.”

“And if the world keeps eating itself?”

He licked a drop of beans off his thumb and glanced at me, eyes sharp in the low light. “Then we climb faster.”

A gust of wind tore through the trees, rattling the tarp he had rigged as a temporary roof. Below, the world groaned under its own collapse.

Hawthorn stood, rolling his shoulders. “You gonna sit there all night, or you gonna do somethin’ useful?”

I looked down at my hands. I pressed them hard against the boards, feeling the splinters prick my skin.

I sat up.

And I decided.

I reached for the remnants of what was left of the world’s power, my fingers typing into nothing.
