Day one 
The staff just locked me in this padded room with one small window, and they took everything out of my room, off my shelves and the books off my bookshelf nothing, no tv no phone and they installed a closet with a shower and toilet inside of it. They just delivered my rations for the first 5 days after that they'll deliver my next rations. Dr Morgan said I will be locked in here. They painted the walls white, I don't have anything to do but sleep and the occasional visit from Dr Morgan and the occasional screams from the other 5 people in the other rooms. I looked out the window. It's night already. I'm going to try and sleep.

Day five
I'm starting to like it here, just the occasional visits from Dr morgan.

Day ten
It's been ten days and I'm starting to lose my sanity. The only thing they have given me is K rations; they are just crackers and water. An hour has passed and a man named Davis has come to visit me and talk to me he wears a suit he also has thick brown hair and green eyes. It's nice because I have been so lonely and so bored so this is nice. It's night now so I’m going to try and get some sleep.


Day eleven 
I'm starting to lose it even more than yesterday. Davis's face is starting to warp and he is telling me things that aren't true. I'm also seeing these strange faceless people and I'm starting to not feel tired.




Day twenty
I have run out of pen ink so I took my pen and stabbed myself in my upper forearm, i don't like this i don't like what davis is saying because now he is crawling on all fours around my room and the little girl in the corner is starting to scare me and i don't like the feeling of the skin on my hands, so i've starting picking at them.


Day twenty one
They gave me a new pen and bandaged up the wound where I got my blood ink from. I'm still picking at my hands and the faceless  people I mentioned earlier keep watching me and davis… Davis is dead on the floor with his neck slit and his face is unrecognizable. I don't like this. I have lost a lot of skin on my hand and I like the feeling of it.


Day twenty five
I have peel a lot of skin off my hands and it feels amazing there is a lot of blood on the floor where Davis lies. I ran into the closet because the shadow people kept watching me, so I barricaded myself in the bathroom., I hear alarms blaring and security running through the halls with doctors and I have seen people with the patient uniforms running and getting tackled and brought back to their rooms. I saw one patient get shot. He's dead now.


Day twenty nine
My room is a mess. I no longer hear screams but I hear things from outside the closet. I peaked out and saw Davis was gone. They ate him THEY ATE HIM. There's a new person in the closet with me to talk to. She is a young girl probably my age. She said her name was Sadie. She has talked to me for the past hour and I'm starting to feel tired.



Day thirty 
I don't want to leave, the strange faceless  people are breaking into the closet. I have clawed At my skin and I'm bleeding from a lot of places there is blood on the walls. Sadie has disappeared for good and i hate everything, there is blood on the wall from me trying to bash my head in, the shadow people are gone and i have clawed at my face and am bleeding from my nose and my mouth as well as my forehead from clawing at it and hitting my head on the wall. I have crawled out of the closet and the shadow people are facing the wall floating. I curled up on the bed and started crying. The doctors and security have opened my door and i started to fight them i did not want to leave i managed to claw one of their eyes out screaming “ I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE” over and over again the last thing I remember is the security guard screaming in pain, then dr morgan came and calmed me down and i have been moved to the recovery center and they are sending in psychiatrist and therapists to look me over and talk to me, but I won’t ever forget the wounds and scars that have been left on me physically and mentally.




The end.




Epilogue

I found this journal in a run down mental asylum in a patient's room the owners name is clawed out. The journal burned a little and there's one page written in blood. All of the dates in this journal are from 30- 40 years ago. There was blood in a whole bunch of rooms and I think I saw some bones.

Day one

I don't like this journal ever since i picked it up a couple days ago i've been how do i put this, seeing things for example, yesterday i saw a half eaten corpse sitting by a tree with its throat slit and his face clawed off, i got a closer look and he had a name tag “Davis'' it said. Just then I saw someone in the bushes. I ran inside and grabbed my gun andI called the police immediately after I saw that. They showed up 2 minutes later ( I live right next to the sheriff's department ) and they found nothing…

Day two

It's gotten like ten times worse, the things have gotten closer to my house. They look like they’re wearing suits but they have no facial features. I know what I have to do. I'm gonna burn this journal. 

Day three
I shouldn't have done that they're in my house.



“What the hell is going on now!?” I say as I pay attention. 

Breaking news Earlier this morning police were called to a residence with a report of screaming, the sheriff and deputies opened the door and found a man lying on the floor of his bedroom with his throat slit and face clawed at. Police still do not know who or what did this and why?
We have a news reporter at the scene. 
“Yes, we're here at the residence and as you can see behind me they're rolling him out of the house.”
We’ll be back with more updates in the hour.

“Dear god they got Tom!” I say as I slowly turn around to a knock at the door.


The end.
