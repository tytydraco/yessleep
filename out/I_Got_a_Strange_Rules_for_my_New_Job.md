I recently got a new job as a dog sitter for this fairly rich family for a paycheck of $850 a day. I was ecstatic as most would be. Especially being a college student. So, Sunday morning I arrived at the house and approached the wooden door. The house was bigger than I anticipated it was almost intimidating. I got a sudden chill as I reached up to knock when the door opened.

"Oh hello you must me Nancy." A middle aged woman said with a warm smile.

"Yes. I am. I came here to dog sit your dogs Sunny, River, and Indigo." I explained with a warm smile back.

"Yes. Come in I just need to give you the rules." Mrs. Smith explained as I went in. Her three dogs came over with the clicking of their nails. Sunny was a large 2 year old XL American Bully, River was a medium sized Border collie, and Indigo was a Belgian Malinois. River and Indigo came with 2 slobbery tennis balls while Sunny just came with his wagging tail. 

"Here is the list of rules. Usually, I'd stick around to explain them to you but I'm running a bit late for work." Mrs. Smith explained with a smile and a reassuring pat on the back. I took the piece of paper from her hands and began to read it. The rules read:

"1. You may see cuts, welts, and stranger marks on the dogs I promise you It's nothing and not to think anything of it. 

2. When staying the night you may hear yelping from the dogs. It is nothing I assure you.

3. Take the dogs out on leash. They run away when off leash.

4. Don't let the dogs on beds or furniture. We will know trust me.

5. The dogs are fed by us you don't need to worry about feeding them. 

6. The dogs play a little rough but don't worry they don't ever seriously harm each other. 

7. The dogs aren't overly well behaved but don't worry they are harmless. They know enough, stay, and place if needed along with heel for walks.

8. Take them on at least a 3-mile-long walk before we get home. We are too tired to do it."

Right as I finished reading Indigo grabbed Sunny's ear as they began to wrestle. They slammed each other against walls and furniture. I had to stay the night today so I placed my stuff in the guest bedroom that was marked. I sat down and turned on the TV. I threw the ball a couple times and pet Sunny. Sunny, if I remembered correctly, wasn't overly playful and was more the cuddler. I frowned when I felt a lump on his side. I remembered the rule and continued on. The night was overly normal beside the yelping. I thought it was odd but ignored it as I was told. I didn't feed them in the morning and then left. 

When I returned the next day, I noticed the dogs seemed almost thinner, but I chalked it up to the 3-mile-walks I took them on. I got up to a knock on the door and opened it. I stepped back in shock to see 2 police officers standing there.

"Are Mr or Mrs. Smith there?"

The police are currently talking to me and discussing what I know. Apparently, the dogs have been getting beat each night and the welts and marks were the cause of it and the last dog sitter who tried to report them was found dead. The dogs are being taken from them and they will see what they will do with them after that. Most likely a shelter as they don't want to risk family returning them.
