It was raining, and fog enveloped the city, the evening dew clinging to my flesh like a mangy coat, the city dog I was. Rats scuttled down leaking, rusted pipes, sipping the muddy water from the cracks, and I licked my lips, my stomach growling with anger, and for a moment I was hungry. The temptation was there, reach out with a clawed, hairy hand of mine and pluck it squirming from the wall, alive as I chewed through diseased fur, organ, and bone alike, sucking on the marrow like the world's nastiest lollipop. But I decided to wait. If I ate now, if I let that blood dribble down my cracked and dry lips, I'd be full, and I could not be full. Full meant content. Full meant cozied and fattened up. Like I could lie down and sleep in the dumpster and soak in the garbage juice, and never wake up as the world turned and burned around me. 


No. I would not taste flesh. I would let that knot of hunger burn into my blade and let it strike true. 


I was hungry, and they were *here*. 


You could tell who they were by the smoke they left. The stench of mind numbing drugs, lines of cocaine and meth filling the air with a sleepy, drugish haze. You could see it in the way they walked, like the living dead, shambling and screaming as they walked without purpose, searching for something they could not find, chasing an illusion of the past that had gone up in ash and mist. I desire them for they were nothing. No one would even notice they were gone. Yet they walk in a herd, and if you take away one, you take away a supplier, a resource, a means to an end. No, I have to look for those who walk alone, so empty of mind that they will not even scream. 


Where are they? 


Where is *it*? 


I see her. She might have been young, she might have been old, it made no difference here, so coated in muck it was all the same. Her skin was yellowed like the worn pages of a book, and her teeth brown like the shit they left on the concrete. What clumps of hair that remained on her shriveled scalp swung like the pendulum, counting down as my watch went *tick, tick, tick*. 


Midnight. The witching hour. 


I struck. 


She didn't see me as I approached, so consumed on getting the last few specks of powder into that greasy lighter that I was no more than a phantom looking through tinted windows. But I coughed, grinning all the while, baring my crooked, gleaming, fangs. 


And there was finally some light in those murky blue eyes. For that I was glad! Some recognition that someone other than *you* lady exists! Thought for a second I'd have to grab a crowbar and do some troubleshooting on her faulty wiring, but there was some life in her yet! 


Let's fix that, shall we? 


"Good evening madam…" 


I did a twirl, putting a little pep in my step as I bowed. 


"A pleasure to make your acquaintance! Now tell me, what is a lovely young lady like you doing out on her own tonight?" 


You wouldn't believe how much I wanted to gag when I said young. The things I do to please! 


And wouldn't ya know, she blushed! Looked at me like I was some hot shit ripped right off the clothes line and that wrinkled frown split into a Cheshire grin. She fingered the smoldering wick in her hand, throwing it to the ground and putting it out with her worn leather soles. 


"Oh you know. Just enjoying the sights and sounds. Relaxing in this…fine weather we have here." 


Boy, did I *know* alright. 


"Sights? Like making friends with the maggots? Tell me, what is your name, lass?" 


She hesitated, but said, "Carol." 


"Well Carol, as sweet and clear as the heavenly bells, may I accompany you on this fine night? Trust me, I can show you some real nice places, if you'll have this grandpa as your guide?" 


I returned her lopsided smile with an unblinking stare of my own. She didn't notice, I was almost disappointed she didn't. But those sweet little wrinkles lightened up and the years fell back from her face. 


I almost felt bad for her. I blinked, and the illusion was gone, Carol was Carol once more, not what might have been had life taken a different course, but what life had spat out and run over and left to die, twitching and bloodied. 


"I don't have anywhere else to be! Would you have me?" 


"My dear, why wouldn't I!" 


And she took her arm in mine, and we went on our merry way. 


It was such a beautiful night. 


The sirens were howling, and the murky clouds obscured what stars might have been twinkling in the night sky. I saw a black cat or two pass our way, yeowling as I peered into their golden amber eyes, hiss making it quite evident that if I got close I better be ready to sew my hand back on. But I avoided those pests, and I didn't even worry about the boys who passed us by, donning leather jackets with greased back hair, playing at being men, thinking one day they'd make it big and leave this city but they'd end up just like me, with that same unquenchable first and I know full well the lengths you'll take to satisfy it. 


I met their eyes. They looked away. Perhaps they didn't like looking in the mirror. I know I didn't. 


"Tell me, have you always lived in the city? We don't often get newcomers you see, at least not anymore. But I know faces well, yet I can't seem to have recalled you. At least not back in the old days, and as you know, those were different times." 


I gave her a side smile and it was all too real. We all knew the ghosts who danced in these streets, and the holes they left when the well dried up. 


Her eyes glazed over again, but it wasn't because she was numb. I knew that look, looking into a hazy past you'd rather forget. And you've been running from it for so long but it still follows you. 


You wonder, has anything changed? 


I don't think it has. 


"Would you be surprised if I said I was raised on a farm? Well I was! Milking the cows, warding off predators with the butt of my shotgun, reinforcing the barbed wire fence and plucking any critter that had the misfortune of getting too close." 


I winced. Every rose had its thorns. 


"But despite the blood and the rough and tough lifestyle, I didn't really want that. I read those stories of a country girl leaving her parents and making it out on her own and I thought, I wanted to be that! I wanted to be a shining star and get on that stage and fucking own it, let the world know who I was and I wouldn't give a damn what anybody thought of it. Ain't that silly, huh?" 


I grinned and clapped her on the back. Be an actor, slip on that costume and be something you're not, you're preaching to the choir missie and if only you knew! Maybe we weren't so different after all! 


"Silly? A little idealistic sure, but silly, I'd never call dreaming a dream silly. That's what dreams are for! You wish on a star and hope the stars return your call.  Growing up is just realizing they never even picked up the phone." 


She paused at that, looking downward, then up to the empty sky. I led her along, through the ways none walked, where concrete bled into cracked, muddy ground and empty, rotted stumps loomed. 


"Wherever are we going?" 


"....Tell me, have you ever dreamt of getting out of this city once you got here?" 


The clouds parted, just a bit, and the blue and red lights of the siren song died down. You could see flowers, even from here. Dulled, wilted, drooping, but life all the less, surviving despite the weeds that tried to eat them up. You fight tooth and nail and somehow, come through on the other side. I would have liked to meet Carol back in those dreaming days, maybe I'd be a different man, maybe we'd have a night to remember and many more to come. 


Alas, a man can dream, right? 


"It was different. The poets were wailing in the streets and the lights of the theater filled up the night. Even if you couldn't afford a ticket you'd sneak in around the back to get a peep through a window and run away cackling as a fat guard waved you away with a baton. I yearned for that voice, the kind of voice that whisked you away to another world and made you believe in it too. That voice could bring about change, that voice could light a fire and I still wondered if I'd ever find my spark." 


"Did you?" 


Did I? 


She laughed, and it was funny, in a drink yourself to death sort of way. 


"Do I look like I found it?" 


"You look like you traded your spark for a lighter." 


She punched my shoulder, giggling like a schoolgirl as I spun her around, wrapping my arms around her waist and she batted those batty eyelashes at me and I winked back, and a part of me wished I had a tophat to make the scene complete. 


"Your mom taught you to speak to a lady like that?" 


"My ma taught me many things, missus!" 


Carol rolled those wide peepers, looking the other way. 


"They left while they still could. The money had run dry. A war had come, our boys were sent to the front lines and we were left to keep this country in tip top shape. Nobody had time for art anymore. It was a passtime, a privilege and a luxury, fat to be trimmed. And that little girl became a bitter old hag who hated the world for never even giving her a chance, never trying to listen." 


But what did the world owe you? 


"So she curled up in a ball and withdrew into herself, further and further and further till even the shell that remained rotted away, and all I could do to escape the pain was inflicting even more upon myself so hopefully my body would stop registering it. And here I am now, dancing in the dark like there is no tomorrow." 


You were more right than you knew, sweet Caroline. Good times never seemed so good. 


She brought her leprosus hand to my warm, scarred chest and stroked it as I purred, holding her frail, trembling body close to mine, rubbing the back of her neck. 


"So where did you come from, oh so mysterious gentlemen that roamed the night preying on cougars like myself?" 


I closed my eyes, and ignored how they were wet. I ignored the warmth of my body flowing into hers and the beating of my own cruel heart. 


"Could I tell you a story?" 


She was silent. 


I led her through a grove of trees, out into a clearing. This might be the only place you could find clear water, might have been the only place in the world for all I cared. The link teemed with fish and mother ducks leading their ducklings through the darkness, away from danger and into the safety of her presence. There was an ache I'd have rather liked to forget as I watched the ducklings play with their momma, who quacked with delight and carefully fed these hungry hungry hippos worms from her beak. We sat down, and I skipped a stone, didn't make it very far but you could see the ripples it made. 


"How did you find this place?" 


I shrugged, tossing a stale piece of bread from my pocket to the birds. Wasn't much, but it was better than nothing, right? 


"Seemed like it'd always been here. The only place you could see the stars in this god forsaken place. Yet no one ever came here besides me, and sometimes I pretended it was my own little fairyland. You're the first one I've brought here, maybe the last." 


She smiled so sweetly as my chiseled hand met hers, and I sighed contentedly, stomach growling all the while. 


Soon. You can only dream for so long. 


I watched our reflections in the water, distorted by the cool breeze that made the hairs on my neck stand on end. I saw a man, a beast, and a boy, and they were all the same. 


And I saw the shadows behind him, he that left and the parasite that remained. 


"My dear old dad pulled me aside one day, looked at me with a real serious look he only got when there was something he actually cared about. He told me, 'Son, I'm not always gonna be here, so when I'm gone you better be the man of this house and take care of your ma for me.' And he stared me down like I was a rat in a cage and I promised him yes of course, I'd do anything for momma! I was a good boy who loved his mother to the ends of the earth, to hell and back." 


I wrapped my arms around my knees, not looking at Carol as I continued. 


"I didn't know what he meant, but he disappeared the next day. Went out for errands and never returned. Back then, I'd assumed something had happened, someone had hurt him, maybe he'd tried to save someone from a burning building! It wouldn't have surprised me, daddy was a hero and you couldn't tell that bright eyed bastard otherwise. So I puffed out my chest and held my head high because real men don't cry." 


Till you realize you don't have any tears left to give. 


"But momma, sweet, fragile as a teacup couldn't cook to save her life so I better whip out that cookbook and get learnin' momma was inconsolable. And that sweet as molasses boy for his life couldn't understand why, but give him an A plus plus plus for trying! Pucker up child, don't be so sad, lie and just say *everything was going to be okay, things will turn around somehow*. Hold your trembling mother close and hide all the knives and the pills and wipe every tear away and read her a bedtime story till she falls asleep and even then, better not leave because she might wake up and if she's gone by morning it'll be all your fault and *she's all I had left*." 


"'Why momma,' he asked, 'He's coming back, isn't he?' Just around the corner, he was just playing hookey from life for a while but eventually he'd remember who we were and we'd matter again and suddenly he'd come back and all is forgiven dear old dad you aren't a deadbeat, you're my *hero*! Come here so I can give you a smooch. And mom would say nothing, the sobbing continued and I just felt worse because she was here, yet she wasn't, and I did was make it worse. I always made it worse." 


Carol's eyes never left mine, the center of her gaze as the moon became my spotlight. Good. This was what I deserved. Maybe if you had a voice like mine Carol you'd get somewhere in this world. Maybe if you stopped feeling sorry about yourself you'd get off your ass and do something about it. 


Don't turn away from me, women. Don't look away for a second, because I ain't done and you'll know *when I am.* 


"Did she think shielding me from the truth would protect me somehow? Did she think I didn't know horseshit when I saw it and I was clinging to a lie to keep my life from falling to bits, but I was already holding it together by a thread and the cracks were starting to show! Did you know I was sinking with you mom? Did you want to drag me down with you cause you couldn't bear to be alone so better to die young than live long enough to grow sick of it? But I didn't question you because I wanted to see your thousand watt smile fill up the room again! I wanted to jump with you on the couch and sing those tunes that played on the radio and sure we couldn't sing a note to save our lives and we'd probably butchered the song but at least we were doing it together, at least we were a family…But a part of you died when he left and you can't dig up a rotting corpse and breath new life in it, can ya?" 


Carol wasn't there anymore. She never was. It was always you, you were following me, vying for my love, my affection. You think you can hide from me mother, you think you can disguise your face and give yourself a new name and I won't recognize you by the fruits you bear?! You were backing away now, terror written plan on your disfigured, ugly face, but I yanked you back to me right where you belong before you could get any of those silly ideas about running away. 


"So who did you give up on first, yourself or me? I probably shouldn't care huh? The past is in the past and good men, good boys forgive! Good boys don't get angry at their momma because she is puking and shitting and convulsing, and it keeps happening no matter how much you beg her to stop putting that poison in her body. And I found where you hid it and what little drug induced strength you had you used to beat the shit out of me till I looked worse than *you*?" 


I giggled. 


"In hindsight, that was pretty funny cause we both like two circus freaks, don't we?" 


I shrugged and stroked her bulging veins, eyeing those scars from every needle and injection. Wondered if I'd connected the dots I could get a constellation. Probably not. 


There were no stars here. 


"Till the day came where I was tired. Tired of picking up your mess and tired of my own. I did the one thing I knew how to do, and didn't even feel bad about it, I didn't feel." 


I picked her up and led her to the lake. You really always were such a delicate thing. Were you ever strong once, or did you find your strength by leaching it off of others? Was that light I once saw in you ever your own? 


"You begged and screamed and honestly, that was the most life I'd seen in you in a long while. And a part of me didn't want to snuff it out, cause if you died that boy would die with you, but he was on life support and I didn't want him to suffer more than he already had. I told you, it was okay, nothing personal really, but when you remembered how to love me, I'd forgotten how to love you. And I swore to myself that I'd never let another person live who'd wreck a home. Who'd make a child suffer because of their own pain. Who'd make the next hit and high more important than their own family." 


I set down and dipped my toes in my water, cradling mother to my chest. She had gone limp. Maybe she'd finally give up. 


"I'd rather be a deadbeat than a deadweight. So for all it's worth, I hope you can move on." 


I waded out into the water, so dark you couldn't see the rocks that nipped your feet, the little scavengers that saw what was dead and picked away at what remained. They were eyeing her, I think, they knew a meal when they smelled it. 


I dropped her and she struggled, but I held her head down till she stopped, and left her to sink. The last thing I saw of her, seared into my skull, were those sweet honey blue eyes that tasted bitter. And when I was young pa threw me into the pool, because you either hit life running or got behind, and I learned quickly, but you can't teach an old dog new tricks. Even if I gave her a chance she'd drown anyways. I just hastened the inevitable. 


And as I turned to go back home. To the city I'd always known, my kingdom and birthright, I could still feel her eyes burrowing into me. Hungry. Not done yet with this game. 


Too bad, so sad. 


*"Don't come back."*
