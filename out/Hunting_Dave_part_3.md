I saw 3 more of those creatures waiting for me after I turned around. These ones were the same size as the one before , I suppose their abilities must be similar as well.


I took a few steps back to gain some distance from them , But two of them started getting closer while one waited behind them.


I went back until I was out of the road and near the trees . The creatures were looking at me with their eye in the chest , Even though their face with crimson hollow eye sockets also faced my direction.


Suddenly one of them screamed and both of them in the front dashed towards me. I enlarged my arm and grabbed a tree , Then swinged it as hard as I could.


I hit 2 of them , The one standing on the back was out of my range. The 2 who got hit were now just a pile of red flesh and blood. 


The last one standing towards the back finally spoke


"Release me.....Kill me.....Help me....."


I froze in shock , This one still had its human conscience.....or so I thought.


It suddenly smiled and leapt at me. It had gotten my guard down. 


It was halfway to me in the air , When it was hit by a car. The car didn't stop and kept going , I was able to make out a mark that I recognised on it , A red U.


"Those UNF guys also want to visit Dave huh" I thought.


I went to get my motorcycle but it stopped working , It must be damaged from the attack. Seemed like I had to go on foot.


I followed the road for 5 minutes , Then I noticed something on one of the trees. It was an egg , Much bigger than the one at the facility. 


Seems like the outside was somehow accelerating the maturing of the eggs , No wonder so many of these creatures were out there.


I turned my left arm into a blade and stabbed the egg's eye , It screamed and then it died. 


Suddenly my phone rang , It was my other phone calling which was with Daniela.


"Hello?" I said as I picked up.


"Hey , I found some stuff here that you might want to know about." Daniela replied.


"Make it fast , I'm in a hurry right now" I said.


"Ok so I found some chats on Jason's computer , It had a password so it took a little bit of time but I managed to get in. It seems Jason was already talking to some guy from the UNF." Daniela explained.


"Spare the details and get to the point already" I interrupted her.


"Gosh ok. They were talking about how you got your powers , It seems they wish to use the same ritual or whatever you used to get powerful." Daniela replied.


"There does seems to UNF guys after Dave. Do you think they might be trying to get Dave's powers?" I asked.


"Maybe. We don't know who from UNF it was , 'whatdude7306' doesn't really give much of a hint. Either way , Be careful." Danila replied.


"I will, You too." I replied and hung up.


I started following the road again and came across the car with the red U , It was smashed into a tree. They either crashed due to a creature or terrible driving skills.


Either way , The car was empty. Seems like they decided to go on foot as well. I started running , I can't let them get to Dave [first.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnnaturalUniverse/s/hkvCsoEAKh)
