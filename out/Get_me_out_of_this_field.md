Day 73: Communicator is online. I don’t know if the outside world can hear this, but here we go. I only have 10 minutes of battery so I need to be quick. Hello. I am not on earth, or any other planet I don’t think. No, a dimension matches this better. This field is seemingly infinite but there are rules to survive that I’ve seen others fail to follow and suffer gruesome deaths, or worse. So please heed my advice.
1: DONT GO INTO THE TALL GRASS


You are lucky enough to be on earth right now. So, no matter what you do, don’t go into the tall grass. I don’t care if there’s a ball, or your pet ran in there, they’re be alright. I’ve never seen a dog here. Getting here takes a few requirements and one is a field with tall grass, another is no one being able to see you, and the third, you have to be a generally bad person. I’ve done stuff I will probably always regret and take to this cursed grave but, that’s not the point.
Next rule.
2: IF YOU SEE A SCARECROW, RUN.


Scarecrows are not the same as the ones on earth. These ones have teeth, move quickly, and turn people in to baking ingredients. If you can, kill it. But I’ve never seen anyone succeed. The creepiest part is what happens to the person that falls victim to this being. Any one of three substances can come out depending on the bad actions they did while on earth.
Nothing - Thief
Blood Flour - Liar
Blood Butter - Selfish/General rudeness
Blood milk - Perv/SAer
And the worst part about it, they scream. No one knows if they are truly alive. They look like their normal counter parts except for the fact that they scream until consumed or cut/baked. It is said that a way to get out is to eat a blood cake but I watched someone do it and get shredded from the inside out. Why this happened is still unknown, a couple theory’s have been talked about though, the most popular one is the souls in those ingredients taking revenge, and that sounds about right.
3: DONT DRINK THE WATER.


Blood milk is the only source of liquid you can drink. Anything else will kill you and torture you the entire time.
“Normal” water - Scare-crowed
Congratulations now your screwed, and a threat to all of your friends. All scarecrows know exactly where you are and are coming for you. They do get hungry after all.
Black water - Crowed
Find a scarecrow and just die faster. Trust me. Every night your crowed, a flock of crows will come and pluck out each of your eyes, then bite off your toes, then fingers and finally a random limb until
you die. So ending your own life might be a better option.
Red water - shredded
This water is infested with vengeful souls who want to destroy whatever and whoever they can. The plants around this water will be dead. So, listen to me, don’t drink it.
And the rarest, 
Crystal water - Turned to glass slowly
It’s painful. It starts at your hand and works it’s way up your arm, then shoulder, and one day, your nothing but a living piece of glass. The glass statues scream until they are broken and thrown in to red water. The pain must be unimaginable.


4: FIND A BARN BEFORE DARK.
Barns are randomly placed throughout this hells-cape and you must find one before dark. Scarecrows aren’t the only monsters out here. They’re also things we call “parasites” they destroy wheat and eat anyone they find. They are blind but can hear VERY well. So stay quiet. Also, Jack o’ lanterns do appear but if you see one, you’re already dead. I’ve heard that they move at 100mph and burn you to a crisp when looked at. But on to the next rule. The most important.


5: WHATEVER YOU DO DONT-
