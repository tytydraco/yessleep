It was about two weeks back when I was alone in my apartment’s lift that a voice made me jump in fear and I almost had my heart in my mouth. I realized it to be an inbuilt announcement and relaxed. It was not a very clear sound but I could make out a few phrases, “Emergency braking system \[inaudible words\] contact Hudo \[inaudible words\].”

Other than the announcement the lift was working as usual. I got off and reported it on the community app. Nobody else had reported it and nobody else would report it after me. However, a committee member asked me which of the three lifts that was. I didn’t hear that announcement again nor have I heard anything from anyone on that matter.

I had forgotten about this incident until two days back. I had gotten up in the night around 3 am to get water when I heard a mechanical voice coming from some speaker outside. I opened the door and the sound got clearer. It was a woman speaking and the sound was very similar to the one I had heard in the lift the other day.

There’s one lift on the wall just next to my door a few feet away. I got closer to the lift and put my ears on the metal doors to listen better. The woman was laughing when she abruptly stopped as soon as my ears touched the doors. That spooked me and I decided to go back inside.

By morning I had convinced myself that last night was either a chain of some weird coincidences: like someone playing TV late at night and coincidently stopping when I listened, or it was some kind of illusion or prank.

Till yesterday I was normally using the lifts without any fear, but I wouldn’t be doing that anymore.

This morning I saw that the shoe stand that I kept outside my apartment along the same wall as the lift was just right next to the lift. The stand had not moved. The space between the stand and the lift had shrunk.

All my shoes were there in the stand normally. Everything was normal except the lift seemed to have moved? The whole damned door of the lift had shifted closer overnight. When I saw that, my vision got blurry and I got nauseous. Maybe my body felt I had ingested something so strong that my brain was not able to make any sense of things. Believe me, I have never done drugs. I went back inside and closed the door.

An hour before writing this, I checked again, the lift had moved even closer.

The lift is coming to get me. I’m inside right now and I’m afraid of opening the door. What if I open the door and it’s the lift waiting for me to enter. What if it has already entered my house and if I look up it’s waiting for me on my bedroom’s exit?

The police aren't responding. I don’t have the phone number of anybody in the building. I need help, fast.
