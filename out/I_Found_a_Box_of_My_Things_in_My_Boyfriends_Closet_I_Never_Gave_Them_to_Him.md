It started with the sweater. A simple navy blue pullover I thought I’d lost months ago. It was folded neatly on the top shelf of my boyfriend’s closet, and I only noticed it because I was hunting for a blanket while he was in the shower.

I pulled it down, frowning. “Hey, Nick!” I called out, holding it up as he came back into the room, toweling his hair. “Isn’t this my sweater? I thought I lost it.”

Nick froze for just a second, then shrugged. “Oh, yeah, you left it here ages ago. I forgot to mention it.”

It was a reasonable explanation, but something about the way he said it didn’t sit right. I didn’t remember ever bringing that sweater to his place.

That nagging feeling stayed with me over the next few days. It wasn’t like Nick to keep secrets. We’d been dating for two years, and while we had our ups and downs, I trusted him. But this… this felt different.

A few days later, curiosity got the better of me. I waited until Nick was out running errands, then went back to his closet. The sweater was still on the shelf, but as I scanned the other items, I noticed something odd: a plain cardboard box tucked in the corner, partially hidden by a stack of old shoes.

My name was scrawled on the lid.

Heart pounding, I pulled the box out and opened it. Inside was a collection of things—things that were unmistakably mine. A hairbrush I hadn’t seen in over a year. A photo of me from high school that I’d lost when I moved out of my parents’ house. A necklace my best friend gave me for my birthday, the one I thought I’d dropped somewhere in the city.

My stomach turned. These weren’t things I could have accidentally left behind. They were items I hadn’t seen in years, things I thought were gone forever.

Then I found the notebook.

It was a cheap spiral-bound journal, one I used to carry around for doodling and writing grocery lists. Flipping through the pages, my throat tightened. The handwriting wasn’t mine—it was Nick’s. Page after page, he’d written down details about me. Things I liked. Things I didn’t. Places I went. People I talked to.

The final pages were the worst. They weren’t about me anymore. They were about us. Things I hadn’t even told him. Arguments we never had. Future plans I’d never agreed to. And at the very end, scrawled in a frantic, looping hand, was a single sentence repeated over and over:

She’ll understand eventually.

I didn’t hear Nick come back. By the time I looked up, he was standing in the doorway, staring at me with an expression I’d never seen before.

“I told you to stay out of my closet,” he said, his voice eerily calm.

I tried to speak, to explain, but my words caught in my throat. Nick stepped closer, slowly closing the door behind him.

“It’s okay,” he said softly. “Now we can finally talk about what’s next.”
