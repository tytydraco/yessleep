Ok so I have a regularly occurring dream. 

It’s so frequent that I can anticipate it and joke with my wife - well, off to my second job.

Because that’s what it is.

Every month, without fail, I will wake up. I have fallen asleep like every nite, but I awake at a facility. There are others, we are a team. We are sat down and briefed on what we need to do and we are taken to chairs and made comfortable. We are wired up and we are observed. 

Once hooked up I am given coordinates and we begin. I feel strange, I get headaches. I take the coordinates and I locate the place with
My mind and I report. People take notes. The last time I can recall it’s a mountain range in china. I centre in with my mind, I provide feedback with what I am doing and it’s recorded. 

I centre in and I focus, I go into the mountain and there is space, tunnels and underground buildings. There’s people and I explain what I can see. Notes are taken and after a while I am thanked. And I return. 

Not to my bed, but to a room with
People. I’m asked further questions and my answers are noted. I return to a room with the other people and always everyone else looks tired. We don’t really talk. 

Everyone looks just like normal people, nothing stands out. Except there’s a girl. She’s young. She looks sort of goth like - black hair. She has a strange birth mark around her eye and a tattoo on her wrist like a heart. 

No one really talks much in this area. Just a basic acknowledgment. Everyone is tired, and just has to be there. So just basic “ hey” as a greeting. 

Shortly after we are returned to another room, I wake up very very tired.

Even though this is a dream, the frequency and the familiarity of it weirds me out. I don’t believe in conspiracy stuff and didn’t think anything of it, aside from how often it occurs and how real it feels and how absolutely drained I am after this occurring dream.

Until. 

I work from home. I have done this prior to Covid, and have been lucky enough to continue to do so. 

Needless to say, because of this I don’t get out very much. I drive my wife to work, take my kids to school, do shopping locally, but that’s it.

On the weekend, we decided to take the kids into the city. It’s a good distance away from where I live, and I have not been in there for years. 

There is a mall, and it’s the centralized place through the city, and we were walking up it to get from one place to another. A lot of
People congregate here. 

As we were walking up, we walked past a group of teenagers, who were sitting at a bench. I was talking to my wife, and with young kids, and being a protective parent, I glanced over the group. 

There was a girl, sitting, Talking to her friends. Black hair, birthmark over her eye. Tattoo on her wrist. 

I shit myself, her eyes met mine. I kept walking in shock. 

I kept walking with my family, but I was shaken. After a few meters I turned and looked back. 

She was standing up, looking in my direction. The look on her face was absolute shock. 

I’m guessing the same feeling I was feeling.

I kept walking. No idea how to process the situation. 

No idea what’s going on.
