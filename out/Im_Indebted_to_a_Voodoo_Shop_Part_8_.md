The first step to escaping Creole’s grasp was getting used to only having a few working fingers on my left hand. I’m lucky to be right-handed, but you never really notice how often you use your left hand until it’s heavily damaged. Especially when you’re a lock picker and need full use of both hands, it was like learning all over again with more difficult locks. Once I finally got more accustomed to only having a few fingers on my hand, I next went about trying to free myself from Creole’s grasp. 

My only possible source of information was the internet. Needless to say, I didn’t get too many useful ideas. Most were from people roleplaying or scamming me, and I was about to give up hope when on a whim I checked on the maps to see if anything there would pique my interest. And I was surprised to see that on the other side of town was a different voodoo shop. 

“Mama Dupont’s Voodoo Emporium?” I asked aloud as I stared at the listing for it. “It's got 4 stars,” I said afterward, which made me feel a little stupid for immediately thinking that a rating would be helpful in my situation. It was a bit far for a walk but if this place was going to be legit it was worth the little ache I might get in my legs. 

I went into my bathroom and applied more ointment to my face. The ointment didn’t work for my fingers but it seemed to be endlessly refilling whenever I used it. So there was that little bright light in my shitty existence. As I finished I heard someone enter my room, I poked my head out and stared at my dad awkwardly standing there. 

“Hey, Dad,” I said as I did my best to avoid his gaze on me. I could tell he was thinking about the scars I had on my face. “I’m…working on a way to fix all of this,” I told him as I looked up to meet his eyes. I was surprised to see that he was crying again and before I could even process it he’d wrapped his arms around me and hugged me. 

“I’m so sorry baby…I should’ve protected you from all of this. I never wanted anything bad to happen to you or your mother,” he said as he clutched me tightly. I tried my best to hold back the tears but once a single one streamed down my cheek the others followed in rapid succession. 

“It’s okay Daddy.” After a few seconds of us crying together, I pulled myself back and wiped my good eye. He wiped his own eyes and reached into his pocket, handing me a gun in its holster. I opened my eyes so wide that my glass eye fell out of my head and rattled to the floor. That caught him off guard and he quickly looked away from me. 

“It's only a .22 so I doubt it’ll kill him. But for anything else, I’m sure it’ll be okay for self-defense.” He waited for me to scramble around and plop my eye back into my head. Once that was done he placed the gun in my hands and slowly backed away from me. “You remember how to use one, right?” he asked me. Dad had shown me how to shoot from a young age and had installed plenty of gun rules and disciplines into my head. 

“I remember.” I nodded as I pulled the gun from the holster and pulled the slide back to see if it was loaded. It wasn’t which made sense since my dad never stored his guns and ammo together. I walked over to my backpack and quickly stuffed the gun into it along with my various other items. He walked over and handed me a couple of magazines filled with .22s and I also added them to my bag. “I’m going to a different voodoo shop, maybe they’ll be able to help us,” I told my dad as I zipped up the bag and quickly swung it around my back. 

“You’re going to solve our voodoo issue, by going to a different voodoo shop?” my dad asked in complete disbelief. “That’s like lighting another forest on fire to fight a different forest fire, Mace.” He plopped his face into his hand and let out a groan. 

“To be fair Daddy, the fires will eventually burn each other out, so maybe it’ll work out,” I said, still not fully believing in my own plan. But I sort of had to if it was going to work. I wrapped my arms around my dad again and flinched when he leaned in to kiss me on the cheek. 

“Stay safe, Macedonia. I couldn’t stand to lose you.” He pulled back and tussled my hair, getting me to giggle and nod up at him. I walked past him and was happy that my mom was working today. I didn’t feel able to explain my voodoo crusade to her. I walked over to the front door and opened it, nearly having a heart attack when I saw Jacob standing at the door. 

“Jesus, fuck!” I shouted in surprise, quickly looking behind me and shoving the bellhop outside, and closing the door behind me. “You scared the shit out of me, Jacob.” I panted as I stared at him and crossed my arms in anger at him. He tilted his permanent smiling head a bit at me and I stared up at him, and before I could get any angrier at him he waved at me. 

That got a little snort out of me and I sighed as I noticed the letter in his hand. That sucked all of the joy out of me. I extended my hand out to him and he gently placed the envelope in my hand. I stared down at it and instead of immediately opening it, I stuck it into my jacket pocket. 

“I’ll be at the shop later today, ok? I have something important to do first.” I told him to which he nodded and gave me a little salute. Everything that Jacob did just brought a smile to my face and I gave him a little wave goodbye as we separated to go down our separate paths. 

I walked down the streets toward this new voodoo shop and I began to take notice that it was in the nice part of town. Different from the houses I stole from in the suburbs but still just as nice. It gave me a little bit of hope. Creole’s voodoo shop was in the shitty part of town and he was a psychopathic murderer. So could the owner of this new voodoo shop be a better person? I hoped that it would be the case as I checked my phone to make sure I was going the right way. 

After a half-hour of walking, I could finally see the voodoo shop in my sight. And right away I could tell it was completely different from Ol’ King Creole’s. Mama Dupont’s Voodoo Emporium actually looked like a business that hadn’t been abandoned for 50 years. Not to mention the store even had a more prominent sign. It felt inviting, and that filled me with a bit of comfort and also the courage to actually enter the store. 

A soft and comforting bell heralded my arrival, and I couldn’t help but stare up at it in wonder. I’d heard Creole’s sad and rusty bell so many times that I forgot that a bell could sound like that. I scanned my eyes across the store and was struck by how neat and organized everything was. It was like stepping into an antique shop that a little old lady ran and carefully cared for. 

“Do come in sweetheart, I’ll be with you momentarily.” A soft and caring voice broke me out of my endless scanning of the store. I looked over towards where it had come from and saw a middle-aged black woman sitting at the counter. If this shop was an antique shop then she was the little old lady who ran it. I watched her as she looked down at her hands cupped in front of her and just immediately wondered if she was a grandma in any way. 

“Sorry to intrude,” I told her, holding the straps of my backpack tight and walking over toward the counter. The woman looked up at me and was suddenly horrified at what she saw. She quickly walked around the register counter and quickly walked over to me. 

“You poor thing, what’s happened to you?” She asked me as she slowly raised a hand to where my glass eye was. I instinctively pulled away from her hand and couldn’t help but look down at the floor in shame. 

“That’s why I’m here,” I told her, lifting my head to her and suddenly becoming aware of the thing she was holding in her hands. “What’s that thing?” I asked as I pointed toward it. In her hands was a small little creature that looked almost like some kind of a bug. It had wings and antennas and also five colorful eyes. But it was wearing a hoodie and sweatpants. It also appeared to be crying and sniffling. Against my better judgment, I started getting closer to it with my finger. 

“Wait! I wouldn’t-” The owner was in the middle of trying to stop me when the bug creature looked at me, opened its mouth, and chomped right down on my finger. I let out every obscenity I could think of as I pulled my finger away and left a decent chunk of skin behind in the bug’s mouth. “I’m sorry sweetheart, this creature scares and becomes emotional very easily.” She told me as she reached over to one of the shelves near us and pulled out a small stuffed rabbit from the shelf. 

She lowered it down to the bug’s level as it was busy chewing on my skin and hissing in my direction. When it became aware of the stuffed rabbit however its eyes literally lit up in excitement as it gave the rabbit a big squeeze hug, its wings flapping happily. 

“There, all better now.” The voodoo shop owner said softly as she sat the bug on a shelf with its stuffed rabbit. “Now then, where are my manners? My mama would have killed me by now for being this rude to ya,” She giggled and lifted the ends of her dress a bit to bow at me. “I’m Mama Dupont, the owner of this lovely establishment.” 

I was busy sucking on my finger to make it feel better, the gross taste of blood coating my tongue as I did so. I pulled my finger out and slowly bowed to her just to match her mannerisms. “I’m Macedonia, but please call me Mace. I need your help, really badly.” I told her, and I could tell that she couldn’t stop looking at my glass eye. 

“It would certainly seem that way.” She nodded as she walked over and carefully grabbed my hand and inspected the bite. “What has happened to you, my poor child?” She asked me as she produced a potion from seemingly nowhere and quickly began rubbing some of it onto my bite. 

“Do you know who King Creole is?” I asked her and she immediately stopped everything she was doing. She looked at me with absolute horror in her eyes. She quickly dropped my hand and started muttering something in French. I was more than a little confused about that, I looked over to the bug to see if it was having the same reaction but it had called asleep lying down in the rabbit’s chest. 

“We don’t speak his name. He is persona non grata,” she told me as she grabbed my shoulders and gave them a soft squeeze. “He’s the reason that you have all these terrible scars?” she asked me and what I suspected was confirmed. 

“You can see them?” I asked as I instinctively went to rub the spot where I’d been stabbed by the junkie. She nodded and motioned for me to follow her to the register. I followed after her, looking down at my finger to see that the bleeding had stopped. 

“Normal people can’t see past his illusion but I can see them clear as day. You poor child, for him to use you in this way.” She shook her head and quickly ducked behind her counter to begin looking for something. 

“Can you help me? I need to stop him before he kills me and my whole family.” She quickly popped her head back up and laid out a few necklaces in front of me. She quickly took my hand again and looked down at my palm. Judging by her reaction, it didn’t look like my future had much good in it. 

“I can’t personally become involved. If I do, well needless to say he won’t be happy about that at all, not to mention that horrible cabal of friends he has.” She said as she let go of my hand and offered me one of the necklaces from the counter. 

“Like…Sinclair?” I asked her. She nodded and looked at me. “I had a run-in with him. He seems lovely.” I said sarcastically and she couldn’t help but give me a dry laugh. “If he has more friends like that, the sooner I get away from him the better,” I told her as I placed the necklace over my head. 

“That necklace will protect you from his magic, but not from physical attacks. So your best bet is to keep your distance. I do have a spell that could stop him for good, but unfortunately, I don’t have the required ingredients. You did sort of spring this on me out of nowhere.” She sighed as she reached under her counter again and pulled out a small bottle filled with a bright blue liquid. 

“What’s that?” I asked as she gave it to me. 

“A cleansing potion. It’ll break the contract hold he has over you and your family. All you have to do is drink it. But it’ll only come into effect after 24 hours,” she told me, and I nodded. This potion would finally free me from any obligation I had to him. 

“Thank you, ma’am. What do I owe you?” I asked, hoping that I didn’t have to trade my soul to her as well. But she simply smiled and held my cheek in her hand. 

“You come back safely to me and buy a charm from my shop, that’s what you owe me.” She told me. I gripped the bottle and nodded, quickly stuffing the bottle into my bag and walking toward the exit. I got scared by the bug as it started hissing at me as I walked past it and its stuffed bunny. As I exited Mama Dupont's, I stuck my tongue out at it and started walking towards the Half Priced Voodoo Store. 

As I was walking I suddenly remembered the letter that Jacob had given me. I pulled it out of my jacket pocket and opened it, and immediately felt my blood freeze in my veins. It was five simple words. And yet it was enough to get me to drop the letter and start sprinting towards the voodoo shop. “I know what you’re doing.” It had told me. As I was running I reached into my bag and pulled the potion out, quickly guzzling it down. If I was going to make it to 24 hours I might as well start. 

As I entered the shitty part of town I stopped to catch my breath and also pull the pistol out of my bag, quickly loading it and pulling the slide back, loading a bullet into the action. I took some deep breaths to calm myself and to recuperate from my run. I hadn’t run since back in high school and it showed. I walked towards the voodoo shop and gripped the handle of the gun tightly in my hand. 

Stepping into the shop I was immediately met with Jacob waiting by the door and he quickly reached out and tried to grab the gun from me. I ducked away from him and pointed the gun at him with great hesitation. As much as I had come to love and care about him I also had to remember that he was nothing but Creole’s toy at the end of the day. He looked at me with that same smile and slowly raised his hands in surrender. 

“Holding up my bellhop? How needlessly cruel of you, Mace.” My sights were quickly trained toward Creole’s voice and I was surprised to see him standing just mere feet from me. I wasted no time and quickly squeezed the trigger of the pistol. I quickly unloaded three shots into Creole’s face and sent him staggering backward. 

For a moment he stood still and motionless, his head snapped back at an almost 90-degree angle. But after a few seconds, he snapped his head back up and I watched in horror as the small bullet holes in his face closed up before me. “A .22 Mace? Why that’s hardly enough to kill a normal person. Ya really think that you can hurt lil ol’ me with that?” he said with that stupid smile still present on his face. 

“It was worth a shot,” I groaned internally at my own stupid pun and kept the gun trained squarely on Creole’s face. “I just need to survive 24 hours and I’ll be rid of you anyway,” I told him, backing up slightly as he began approaching me. His cane rhythmically tapped on the floor with every step he took toward me. 

“Oh, you won’t have to worry about me, darling. I know all about you and Mama Dupont’s business with each other. I didn’t give you that glass eye just out of the kindness of my heart.” He giggled as he tapped his own button eye. I reached a hand to my glass eye and suddenly became very aware of just how indebted to Creole I truly was. He’d given me a new eye and had saved me from bleeding out. “Besides, I’m not the one you should be pointing that thing at,” Creole said as he lifted his cane and pointed it toward Jacob. 

I kept my gun trained on Creole as I followed where he was pointing at. Jacob was staring at me and his button eyes slowly drifted toward Creole. It felt like he was apprehensive about what was going to happen. Creole though fixed him with an angry glance and Jacob submissively looked down at the floor. Suddenly a deep rumbling came from inside of him as the stitches and stables that held his head together split down the middle. Suddenly a row of teeth appeared from inside his head and a deep roar came from Jacob. 

“Oh fuck!” I screamed as I quickly trained my gun on him and popped a few shots off as the Jacob monster lunged toward me. I managed to dodge out of the way as he charged straight into one of the shelves and knocked it over along with all of its contents. While Jacob was trapped under the shelf and its contents I quickly turned around to face Creole and was just barely able to dodge a swing from his cane. 

“That charm she gave you may protect you from magic, but it ain’t going to do a damned thing against physical attacks,” he told me through chuckles, as he took another swing at me. Thinking quickly right after I dodged I aimed for his knees and quickly filled them with lead. He wasn’t expecting that as he quickly tumbled to the ground in a heap. 

I took that time to quickly run to the back of the shop and into his office, happy to see that he’d left the door open, I quickly ran in and shut the door behind me just as I heard the Jacob monster finally emerging from under the shelf debris. I locked the office and quickly shoved the large chair he had against the door. 

I panted softly as I turned around I was met with Creole staring down at me with an amused smile. Before I could raise my gun to shoot him he quickly grabbed the gun from my hand and used his other one to bash me over the head with his cane. Now it was my turn to fall to the floor like a sack of potatoes. 

“Clever, but not clever enough.” Creole giggled as he walked over to his desk and left me trying to stand back up. But that blow had scrambled me real good and it was like I was operating with a body that had inverted controls. “I’d love nothing more than to kill you right now or have Jacob eat you. Or even turn you into a new shopkeeper. But, I feel like playing a game with you,” he said with a childlike giggle. He sat down on his chair and happily drummed his fingers on his desk as I finally regained some motor skills, at least enough to sit up. 

“How bout the go fuck yourself game, I like that one,” I told him as I staggered up to my knees. That got a good giggle out of him as he adjusted his hat and smiled down at me with a look of superiority. Just then the door to his office burst open and the Jacob monster came snarling in. Creole held a gloved hand up and Jacob instantly froze in place as the two halves of his face fuzed back in the middle and the ‘normal’ Jacob returned to his old smiling self. 

“No, I was thinking more like…hide and seek,” Creole said. He picked up the small bell on his desk and rang it, summoning Jacob to him even though he was only a couple of feet away from him. Jacob walked over to him and bent down as Creole whispered into his ears. Jacob looked over at me and his brows went up in concern. But he nodded and left the two of us alone in the office. “How about this, Mace? If you survive this little game, I’ll allow you and your family to survive. Our contract becomes void and I leave you alone, I swear on my mother.” He put his hand to his chest and raised his other hand. 

“No tricks? No surprise bullshit?” I asked him, not believing him in the slightest. He nodded and sat up in his chair. “What’s the rules? Do I gotta hide for 24 hours or something?” I asked as the throbbing pain in my head continued. 

“Hmm. As much as I would enjoy that, no I simply don’t have that kind of time. I’m expecting a new hire here in a few hours.” Creole’s button eyes gazed over towards a clock on his wall as he appeared to be working out how long he had. “One hour. Hide successfully for one hour and you’ll be free.” He told me with a smile. 

“Whose seeking? Jacob?” I asked him as I was finally okay enough to stand up. He tsked and shook his head at me. 

“He’s got a crush on you. He was barely able to try and eat you earlier. No, he ain’t going to be searching for you,” he told me as he drummed on the table some more with his hand. I stared at him for a moment trying to imagine who the seeker could be. 

“Is it going to be you?” I asked him. His smile grew wider at that and at first, I thought that was some kind of confirmation. The drumming on his desk continued as he stared at me for an uncomfortable amount of time in silence. 

“In a manner of speaking, yes,” he said cryptically as he stared at the wall clock again. “Tell you what, I’ll let you pick where you’ll be hiding.” I perked up at that because I already had an idea of where I wanted to hide. 

“The hotel,” I told him immediately after he finished. It would be the perfect place, with plenty of rooms and avenues to hide in, it would be almost impossible for anyone to easily find me. Instead of being angered by this, Creole simply smiled so wide that one of his stitches ripped open. 

“Perfect.” He stood up from his desk and walked over to me. “Shall we shake on it?” He offered his hand to me. I stared at it for a moment before wrapping my hand against his and giving it a hard squeeze. “Wonderful! Let’s head out now shall we?” He motioned for me to exit his office and I followed his orders. 

As we exited I noticed that Jacob was nowhere to be seen. And to my surprise already the door to the shop had transformed into the door to the hotel. Almost as if Creole had planned that all along. He opened the door for me and I entered first, followed quickly by him after me. There I noticed Jacob standing next to the main desk with a tall square wrapped in a blanket next to him. 

“Wonderful! You found it, good boy Jacob!” Jacob gave a small little nod and avoided looking over in my direction as Creole walked over to the object and yanked the blanket off of it. To my horror, the cursed mirror was revealed to be hidden underneath it. “So Mace, I’d say you have about a 5-minute headstart. After all,” Creole turned to look at me as his reflection in the mirror began to twist and contort into an even taller and more monstrous version of him. “I’ve got to get acquainted with my new friend here.” He cackled manically which was soon joined by his reflection as it began to emerge from the mirror. 

I wasted no time and quickly began sprinting towards the stairwell. I wasn’t even bothered by the horrible stench of it anymore. I was in a race for survival, and my entire family’s life was at stake. I was either going to win this game of hide and seek, or perish a horrible agonizing death.
