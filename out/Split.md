Its weird when friend groups split up. It can be sudden or maybe this was happening all along. After 'TnT' got married Rae got weird, so I got weird, and Devin... Well he's kinda always fine. Over the past year though us 24 year olds I guess got tired of highschool and college friends. I haven't spoken to any of them for a couple months except for Devin. Not super fun to hang out with a dissolving marriage that just begun, the girl ruining that marriage (who I also happen to want her to ruin me), and Devin. Tonight I guess was just the perfect night for the other shoe to drop.

Dinner was cooking, crackling in oil over the stovetop. Meat. Searing chunks of steak with peppers, the aroma of heat, onions, and warm flesh. I shuffle it around with a wooden spoon admiring my handiwork. Well-seasoned with chili powder, dried red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper it truly was one of my best dishes since moving to this apartment. I at least would be done before 7 pm this time. 

*zzzzzZZZZZt zzzzzzZZZZZt…. zzzzzZZZZZt zzzzzZZZZZt*

I look over to my phone, “6:30 really?” Unknown number, I let it vibrate for a second grabbing my pot and a can of refried beans. It buzzes for a 3rd time, fine. Clicking it to speaker I fiddle with the bean can, old ass can opener can’t seem to stay in. 

“Hello?” 

“*Hello is this \_\_\_\_\_\_\_?*” 

“Yes, who is this?” I bonk the can with the opener as if the violent bonk would make it work properly. The voice on the other end seemed hesitant. 

“*Have you seen Rae?”* 

“What? Wait is this Tammy?” I rolled my eyes. Great, two dull things to handle now. The lid won't budge, letting a small puff of air from my nose I aim the can opener for just under the lid. The sweet spot between the squishy side dish and sharp metal. 

“Listen if this is about Trevor and Rae I don’t know anything-” The lid slightly moves up, I poke an index finger under to keep it up.

“*The cops came over today, have you seen Rae*” Tammy was a lot less composed this time around, she's never been one for much critical thinking. This is bad. I pause my can-opening project.

“What?”

*“She didn’t go to work at all this week they said, they’re gonna check her apartment tonight.*” Hysterical sobs came through the speaker. “*Trev and Devin both said no and I said no so if you don’t know then what if-*” Not good, pregnancy didn’t help Tammy with her big heart, or her leaping to conclusions.

“T, I don’t think anything could’ve happened to her. She probably just went off somewhere for break.” 

“*Do medical students get bre-get breaks?*” Tammy sniffled, the idea of simple miscommunication never crossed her mind. “I mean probably? Didn’t Trevor get breaks for his masters?” “.*. yeah he did*.” Shame seemed to fill her voice. “Hey yknow how about you and Trevor come over tonight?” “*Oh no I can’t, we can’t I mean. Lots to do before Bee gets here”* “Oh finally picked?” “*Just the starting letter, Trevor picked out a boy name though*” “Lakc of enthusiasm there, it can’t be that bad can it?”

“*Brad”* I laugh a bit as my phone vibrated to life again, this time it was the local police department. Fuck. “Wow that is ...wow, listen I’ll call you tomorrow morning ok?”

Another small sniff from Tammy’s end *“Ok. Talk to you then?*” “I promise, I’ll add this number to my phone right now.” That seemed to be a good enough promise as Tammy hung up immediately after.  *zzzzzZZZZZt zzzzzZZZZZt*

Switching calls I turn my attention back to the bean can. Finger and can opener under it slowly lifting.

 “Hello?” my eyes locked on my own hands as the cop on the other side explained that they were wondering if I had heard from Rae. Simple answer, no.  They asked if they could come over to my house tonight. Sure, odd but ok. Nothing bad could’ve happened within the span of a call right.

“Do you know of anyone who would want to harm Rae?”

**SLICE.** 

I pull my right hand away from the can, there's a slight slit with big wet red beads slowly oozing from it. “No No I’m fine I just gasp” The lid was oddly clean, the can was undefeated, and nothing in the world had changed at all. Except for my spilled blood, and that Rae was no longer in it at all.

“I just cut myself while cooking, I think I’ll have to call you back.” *“What was tha-*” I hung up. I breathed in deeply and ran over to my bathroom grabbing the handtowel and turning on the sink. I shoved my index finger under the cold water and hissed in the air with fear. It's too deep. Pink and swirly flesh revealed just underneath my skin. Too deep. I tensed my legs and pulled my hand out of the water and into the towel. The blood seemed to immediately come back. I held my index finger above my head with my other hand wrapped tight around it. I  turned off the stove, grabbed my keys then left for urgent care. After a bit of novocaine in my finger and 3 stitches, I got to go back home. 

There were no cops when I got home and everything is really quiet. Still smells like meat. I put dinner away for tonight and turn on the tv. Local news at 9 pm, her apartment building. The header read **Grad student gore**. “*Unidentified flesh samples will be tested at the Loraine forensics lab, police refuse to say what specifically was at the scene. Onlookers claim to have witnessed police running out of the young womans room vomiting or dazed. What type of crime has shaken them to their core? More on that later. Jennifer?” “Thank you Megan. Our condolences to the family of the missing victim, we hope there will be answers for Rae.”*

I don’t think I can try to look up the news tonight.
