If you live in the United States, you most likely have been hearing about this massive snow storm coming through. My small Minnesota town has known about for a long time now. We’re pretty used to the snow up here, and this time it was no different for us. We just bundle up, and relax. I feel bad for more  southern states getting the cold. Anyway, im not here to write about the snowstorm. Im here to write about what’s IN the snowstorm. There’s something that happened to me last night, and im nothing short of terrified. 


 The night started out as any other. I came home from work, sat down, had dinner, and watched some TV. It was about 7 o’clock when I got the alert on my phone that the snowstorm was imminent. I chuckled as I imagined my luxurious day off of work the following day. I set my phone back down and continued watching TV. Around 8:30, the snowstorm was raging. I couldn’t go 5 seconds without hearing the howling wind, and seeing blankets of white rain from above just outside my window. Then I heard something that really caught my attention. A knock. 


  At first I thought it was just a piece of debris smacking into my house, but there was another knock, then another after a momentary pause. I was beginning to get worried, for I was wondering if I forgot to tie down the fireplace cover outside. Another knock, this time, right next to my ear. Slightly startled, I jumped a little. These didn’t sound like random knocks anymore. No, it was more deliberate. Patterned. Like something from out there were purposefully making the knocks. I shuttered at that thought. And a thought it would remain, I convinced myself. I mean, could something as bizarre as that really happen to my house on a dead end street?


  A few minutes later, everything went black, and with a sigh, I realized the power was out. I went to go retrieve my flashlight, and as I was, my dog, who was lying on my bed, was suddenly staring intently at the window. I paused. Do I dare open the blinds? I reached for the string to pull the blinds up, but my gut convinced me to do otherwise. I stepped away from the window, and turned to face my dog. He had his ears perked up, and his eyes were dilated. I told him there’s nothing out there. It’s just the wind. As I made my way back to the living room and sat down, the wind died down just enough so that I could hear a screaming, in the distance. At first I thought it was the wind, but it sounded too…human. It pitched high, paused for a second or two, and would start again. It would start again in a different location. Sometimes I could barely hear it, and other times I felt it was right outside my doorstep. 


 I was in fear now. I wasn’t one to believe in the paranormal, but this was getting way too creepy. I decided to stop being a baby and grow a pair, and peeled through the blinds that revealed my backyard, which stretched far away. For a moment, I thought I saw a figure in the snow. A human silhouette just standing there, say 25 yards from my window. The snow then faded the figure away. I couldn’t believe it. I had to be seeing things. No chance in hell there was this person out here in negative temperatures just hanging around. I peeked again. It was back, and this time it was a considerable distance closer than before.

  I scrambled for my phone to get a picture of the thing, but before I could, it vanished. I looked back up, and all was white with snow as far as the eye could see. About a minute later, the thing is back again. I could make out its face this time-or what was left of it. It looked like it wasn’t physically possible. As if the physical capabilities of this universe simply didn’t allow it. Yet, it was here. Right in front of me.  Its face was bent, and torn. Almost like I was seeing my reflection in a funhouse mirror. Its eyes were contorted with emotions of suffering, and pain beyond any level we could experience. I can’t even put into words fully of how it looked. It had no nose. Just a black mass of nothingness its jaw was inhuman. It hung below its face like a dangling swing. Its teeth were few and far apart. And its body. My lord. Its body was unlike anything humanity has ever seen before. All the limbs had a mind of its own. They moved, jerked, and  twitched at random, like they all had somewhere to go it was hunched over just to get to my level to see me. This thing just stared. Right into my soul.


I lost it. I threw down the blinds, screamed like a madman, and dove for the phone, praying to god I still had cell reception. I practically herd funeral bells when I saw that we had none. That thing was now knocking on my walls again. All over my house I could hear it. I whimpered to myself-why me? What did I specifically do to this thing? I called for my dog, who came bolting into my room, and crawled under the bed. I wanted to do the same. Right as his last leg went under the bed, I heard it. Clear as day, right behind me. the thing was mumbling some language I couldn’t even recognize. The closest thing it sounded to was Yiddish. As it mumbled outside my bedroom window, I was sobbing, repenting for everything I’ve ever done in my life. I was sure I was going to die. 


 I woke up. I woke up in a hospital bed. The doctors look confused, and worried. Apparently, the icy conditions of the roads sent my car flying off the side of the highway, rendering me unconscious. I had been asleep for 2 days. I starting crying. I tried my best to tell them the nightmare I just experienced. They just looked at me, like I was some old man babbling about useless jargon. I eventually calmed down. Other than a concussion, I was in good shape, spare for a few bruises and cuts. Sure enough, I got to go home the next morning.


  When my wife and I got home, I was relieved to see everything in working order. The power was on, the phone was working, and my dog was as happy as can be. Everything was normal. Until I walked outside. I walked outside and around the corner to my backyard. And there, lying in the snow, was a set of fresh footprints of some sort of creature, leading right up to my window.
