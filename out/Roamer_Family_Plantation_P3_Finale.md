Finale  
(40000 Character limit)  
  
For a while, they simply observed me, their silence laden with intent and anticipation. Then, one of them broke the silence, his words dripping with a sinister satisfaction. "Looks like everything worked out in the end, for us at least." I pondered his cryptic statement, trying to grasp its meaning. "What do you mean?" I ventured cautiously. His reply came swift, laden with a twisted sense of triumph, "Our plan, this part was second to the finale, casting you into the starve pit."  
  
I scrutinized him, my mind racing to comprehend their nefarious design. "So that's what this place is," I muttered, my voice barely audible above the ambient murmurings of despair. He confirmed my suspicion without a hint of remorse, "We throw traitors, or people like you, in here. They fight for their lives, eat each other, then they starve." My eyes involuntarily flicked towards the middle of the pit, where a skeletal figure clung to life, a grotesque testament to the pit's horrors. The remains, devoid of limbs, lay sprawled as if torn apart by some monstrous force.  
  
"Y'all are nothing but animals," I spat, the revulsion and anger swelling within me. He countered my accusation with a chilling indifference, "Aren't we all?" The rhetorical question hung in the air, casting a chilling pall over the pit. Determined to learn more, I pressed on, my voice edged with desperation, "What got you three cast into this wretched place?" He met my gaze, a stoic defiance in his eyes, before uttering words that would remain etched in my memory, "That's none of your business." The air turned cold, heavy with the weight of unspeakable secrets and impending doom.  
  
In that macabre moment, the pit transformed into a battleground of desperation and survival. The three natives, driven by a primal instinct for self-preservation, lunged into action. Two of them brandished bones, meticulously filed down into rudimentary weapons, while the third wielded a large femur with grim determination. I grasped a femur of my own, its surface sticky with the residue of decay, and steeled myself for the imminent onslaught.  
  
The newcomer was the first to attack, his movements swift and fierce. I sidestepped his ferocious blow and retaliated with a powerful strike across his face, the impact rendering him unconscious. The second assailant, armed with a bone knife, charged at me with a savage intensity. His weapon lunged toward me, but I skillfully blocked the assault with my own makeshift bone weapon. With a forceful kick, I sent him reeling backward, momentarily disoriented.  
  
In the chaos, the third native seized an opportunity to catch me off guard. He knocked my weapon from my hands, and we grappled fiercely over his knife. Desperation fueled our struggle until I managed to slam him into the pit's cold, unforgiving wall, momentarily stunning him. Seizing the chance, I swiftly plunged the knife into his throat, crimson blood spurting onto my face in a gruesome display of violence.  
  
The second attacker, having recovered from the earlier kick, approached me with a lethal determination. He lunged at me again, his knife glinting menacingly in the dim light. Swift reflexes saved me as I deftly dodged his strike, seizing his arm in a vice-like grip. Using his own momentum, I lunged forward, driving the knife into his abdomen. He staggered, wounded but not yet defeated.  
  
In his weakened state, he attempted another feeble advance, but I easily sidestepped him. With calculated precision, I thrust the blade beneath his armpit, then into his back, and finally through his neck, twisting it mercilessly. Blood sprayed in a crimson arc, marking his demise. The pit's grim silence was momentarily broken by the gory symphony of violence.  
  
The first attacker, showing signs of revival, stirred amidst the gore-strewn pit. Without hesitation, I snatched up a femur, its surface slick with blood, and brought it down with savage fury upon his skull. The wet crunch of bone mingled with the rhythmic pattering of raindrops as I struck again and again, each blow reducing his head to a gruesome, unrecognizable mass.  
  
Exhausted and covered in the remnants of my foes, I slumped against the pit's grimy wall. The relentless rain began to fall, washing away the evidence of the savage struggle. Overwhelmed by exhaustion, I succumbed to the darkness, the symphony of violence echoing in my dreams as unconsciousness claimed me.  
  
In the eerie half-light of the pit, a world of shadows and grotesque silhouettes unfolded before my eyes. Time seemed to stretch, a twisted canvas upon which my nightmare was painted in excruciating detail. The putrid scent of decaying flesh hung heavy in the air, mingling with the metallic tang of blood, an olfactory reminder of the horrors that had transpired.  
  
Days blended into nights, and nights back into days in a surreal dance of darkness and light. The macabre feast upon the bodies of the three natives I had slain became my grotesque sustenance. With trembling hands, I tore at their rotting flesh, my teeth sinking into the cold, stiff muscle, a desperate bid for survival in the midst of the abyss. Their bones became my tools, fashioned into makeshift utensils, an uncanny fusion of necessity and horror.  
  
Skulls, once the seat of life, now served as my vessels, carrying the bitter lifeblood of desperation. I drank water from these morbid chalices, each swallow a testament to the gruesome reality of my existence. The sun, a distant and mocking observer, traced its ephemeral path across the pit's opening, casting fleeting, flickering shadows that danced with the grotesque scene below.  
  
As days dragged on, the bodies of my victims succumbed to decay, their once-human forms disintegrating into unrecognizable masses of putrefaction. The stench of death intensified, a miasma that permeated the very essence of my being. I could no longer bring myself to consume their festering remains, my own humanity rebelling against the horrors I had been forced to commit.  
Five agonizing days passed without sustenance, my body weakened to a gaunt, emaciated shell. Hunger gnawed at my insides, a relentless beast that refused to be quelled. It was a torture more excruciating than any physical pain I had endured.  
  
Then, in the darkness of one seemingly endless night, a glimmer of hope pierced the despair. The heavy door, a portal between captivity and the unknown, groaned open. A rope snaked down, heralding the arrival of another native, unwittingly stepping into my domain. His eyes, wide with wariness, scanned the pit's gloom, searching for any sign of danger. Unbeknownst to him, I had become one with the shadows, my form blending seamlessly into the darkness.  
  
When the moment arrived, I seized it with a primal ferocity. Like a predator stalking its prey, I lunged upon him, my hands clawing for his gun. Time seemed to slow as I wrestled the weapon from his grasp. In the span of heartbeats, the deafening roar of a gunshot echoed in the confined space. A gaping hole marred his forehead, a crimson stream seeping out, forming a grotesque puddle beneath his lifeless form.  
  
The rope, the lifeline dangling between salvation and oblivion, began its swift ascent. Panic etched across my face, another nativewas stealing my freedom. With a swift and practiced motion, I pulled the trigger. The man fell, his body contorting in a desperate gasp for air. Another shot, and his agony ceased, his life extinguished.  
  
I clambered up the rope, my fingers gripping it with a desperate strength. Emerging into the blinding daylight, my eyes, accustomed to the abyssal darkness, stung and watered. The pit, once my prison, now lay strewn with the aftermath of my violent struggle. Lifeless bodies and congealing blood created a tableau of horror, a visceral testament to my unyielding fight for freedom.  
  
The world outside the pit stretched out before me, vast and daunting. The taste of freedom was sharp on my tongue, mingling with the metallic aftertaste of blood and the acrid scent of gunpowder. With an unsettling calmness, I seized the revolvers that lay scattered, their cold metal pressing against my palms. Bullets, each one a promise of power and vengeance, were carefully tucked into my pockets. Knives, their blades glinting with deadly intent, found a new home at my side, ready to be wielded in the face of whatever horrors lay beyond the pit's confines.  
  
Taking a moment to survey my surroundings, I stood at the precipice of the pit, the harsh sunlight bathing me in an ethereal glow. The remnants of my struggle lay behind me, a chilling reminder of the violence I had been forced to unleash.  
  
I stood on the precipice, the world unfurled before me in a vast panorama. From this vantage point, I could behold the entirety of the island, its secrets and splendors laid bare beneath the open sky. My gaze wandered over the patchwork of my domain, a canvas painted with fields, my imposing manor, slivers of the bustling town, and the majestic grand lake stretching out towards the horizon.  
  
Above all, my attention was drawn to the largest peak, which I knew well: Obsidian Ridge, a monolithic sentinel that had weathered the ages. Gathering my resolve, I descended the timeworn stone stairs, each step bearing the weight of countless generations who had trodden this path before me. As I descended, I spared a final glance toward the foreboding Starve Pit.  
  
Continuing my descent, I traversed rickety wooden platforms that clung precariously to the mountainside, guiding me toward the foot of the towering mountain. The journey led me through thick woods, the rustling leaves whispering tales of this land's history. Eventually, I emerged onto solid ground, far removed from the ominous heights above.  
  
Navigating the dense forest for hours, I encountered a sprawling swamp, a place that held its own mysteries. I immediately crouched low, wary of any presence, especially that of the island's indigenous people. To my surprise, the encampment lay abandoned, devoid of life or movement.  
  
Proceeding cautiously, I traversed the treacherous terrain using creaking boardwalks and rickety bridges, avoiding the treacherous and brackish waters of the swamp. The natives' home, once bustling with activity, now stood as a hollow testament to their enigmatic existence, left eerily desolate.  
  
Entering one of the buildings, I discovered a cache of canned goods, their labels faded but their contents were preserved. However, my apprehension surged as I uncovered spoiled meat, tainted by the practices of these enigmatic people. Fearful of the unknown, I dared not partake in such fare. Instead, I feasted on the canned sustenance and, after my journey, found solace in the cocoon of an abandoned house, where I experienced the deepest and most peaceful rest of my entire life.  
  
As the first light of dawn trickled into the room, I was stirred awake by the faint murmurings that seeped through the walls. Instinctively, I sprang to my feet, fully aware of the dire circumstances that surrounded me. I had slept in my clothes, a habit borne out of necessity, prepared to flee at a moment's notice. The murmurs grew into hushed voices, their urgency apparent; a search party, diligently scouring the island to recover their lost quarry – me.  
  
Without a moment's hesitation, I stealthily navigated the labyrinthine corridors of my refuge. Every movement was calculated, every breath deliberate. In the dim light, I discovered a glimmer of hope – a hatch, a portal to a precarious sanctuary below. With a silent resolve, I slipped through the opening, plummeting into the murky depths of the swamp. Emerging, I coated myself in layers of thick mud, a crude yet effective camouflage against the keen eyes of my pursuers.  
  
The swamp, a realm of tangled roots and eerie silence, shrouded me in its dank embrace. I treaded carefully, each step designed to leave no trace. With the patience of a predator, I maneuvered my way out of the marshland, an escapee from the jaws of imminent capture.  
  
From the concealment of the dense foliage, I observed the search party with a cautious eye. Their faces etched with determination, they combed the surroundings, their voices a low symphony of intent. I remained hidden, studying their movements, analyzing their patterns, and biding my time.  
  
Hours stretched into an eternity as I weaved through the labyrinthine forest, guided by an internal compass that navigated me towards unfamiliar terrain. Eventually, my steps led me to a rocky passage, its entrance guarded by a haunting display – skulls impaled on pikes, their vacant eye sockets echoing ancient tales of warning. Strangely, I found myself on the opposite side of this grim demarcation, a territory I had never explored before. The air crackled with anticipation, every rustle of leaves and distant call of a bird heightening my senses.  
  
With the oppressive weight of uncertainty clinging to every step, I embarked on a cautious journey from the shadowy passage into the open fields that bordered the town. My progress was measured, each footfall deliberate, as if the very ground beneath me might betray my presence. The tall palisades that lined my path were like sentinels, their looming presence both a comfort and a source of anxiety. Every tower along the palisade's edge bore the potential of harboring an unseen observer, and my senses were perpetually on high alert.  
  
As I approached the town, a wave of relief washed over me. It appeared inhabited, a small beacon of hope in a world fraught with uncertainty. For a fleeting moment, I contemplated calling out to announce my presence, yearning for the comfort of familiar faces. Yet, as I surveyed the town below, a sudden realization struck like a bolt of lightning – these were not my townsfolk. The town was teeming with natives, their presence a stark reminder that this land was now a perilous, unfamiliar territory. They had abandoned their own settlement, an ominous portent of their intentions.  
  
Retreating into the concealment of the forest, I resolved to continue my journey toward the manor. The two gatehouses guarding the path back to my estate filled me with trepidation. I approached them with a revolver clutched tightly in my trembling hand, prepared for any potential threat. Scaling the gatehouse, my eyes scanned the fields stretched out below. An eerie emptiness hung in the air, the fields devoid of the life and activity that had once defined this place.  
  
Traversing the perimeter of the palisades, I allowed my gaze to wander to the grand lake, its tranquil surface contrasting sharply with the turmoil of my thoughts. Beyond it, the imposing waterfall roared, a reminder of the unyielding force of nature that governed this land. My journey eventually brought me to the lake bridge, its structure rusty and timeworn, but sturdy enough to support my weight. I hesitated for only a moment, then approached the old, creaking gates. With the key, still secured around my neck, I turned the lock, allowing the gates to swing open, and promptly closed them behind me. It was a precautionary measure, a silent attempt to conceal any trace of my presence in this uncertain world.  
  
Under the cloak of the night, the moonlight filtering through the canopy above, I made my way toward the manor, shrouding myself within the embrace of the forest. The once-familiar sight of my home now appeared alien, adorned with the presence of the natives who had asserted their dominance over my domain. Silent shadows patrolled the second-story wrap-around porch, their vigilant eyes piercing the darkness, rifles clutched in anticipation of my return. A plan brewed within my mind, a scheme to reclaim what was rightfully mine and to exact vengeance for the atrocities committed against me.  
  
In the depths of contemplation, a memory stirred—a hidden passage, a lifeline conceived in times of peace. With deliberate steps, I retraced the mental map of my estate, seeking the elusive entryway. The answer struck me like a lightning bolt: the ravine bridge. Under the shroud of darkness, I maneuvered cautiously, every footfall calculated to avoid even the faintest rustle of leaves that might betray my presence.  
  
Finally reaching the bridge that spanned the deep ravine, I felt the call of the chasm below. My eyes, attuned to the obsidian night, discerned an irregularity—a rusty metal gate embedded within the rock face, steps leading down from its base. A sense of recognition washed over me as I gazed upon my family's emblem meticulously carved into the stone. With trembling hands, I reached for the key that had been my steadfast companion throughout this tumultuous journey. It slid effortlessly into the lock, the mechanism yielding to the familial touch, and the gate creaked open, granting me passage into the hidden sanctum. Closing the gate behind me, I stepped forward, resolute and determined, ready to face whatever awaited me on the other side.  
  
The passage stretched before me, an abyssal tunnel engulfed in absolute darkness. Every step taken in the void seemed to echo with the weight of my thoughts, silently reproaching my lack of foresight in not securing a lantern along the way. Hours melded together in a surreal haze, my arms extending before me like a phantom's, searching for any obstacle in my path. Then, unexpectedly, a jarring collision met my fingertips—an unyielding wall blocking my way.  
  
Groping in the dark, I turned my head slightly to the left, and there, a dim, feeble glow flickered faintly. Following the spectral light, I found a staircase, the outline of the steps barely visible. Carefully, I ascended, my fingers trailing along the rough stone, until I reached the top. There, my hands sought out a mechanism, a lever, or some hidden catch that could unlock the secrets of this clandestine passage. At last, I found it—a cool metal lever, its touch familiar beneath my trembling fingers. Pulling it down, the mechanism responded, the lever snapping back into place, and the once-impenetrable barrier of the bookshelf swung open before me, revealing my study room. It was a space where I had once delved into the secrets of this very passage, mere days ago.  
  
As I entered, a wave of anger and disbelief surged within me. A vibrant melody, played with frivolous ease, accompanied by laughter and mirth, flooded my ears. The invaders—these interlopers who dared to desecrate my sanctum—had taken over my home. My grip tightened around the handle of my revolver, its cold metal a comforting presence in my hand. With cautious steps, I ventured forward, my eyes scanning every corner of the study, ensuring its emptiness before proceeding. Then, driven by a fierce determination and a profound sense of righteousness, I pushed open the door, revealing the opulent grandeur of my ballroom, now polluted by their revelry.  
  
Fury boiled within me; this was my house, my sanctuary, and I would not allow these invaders to defile it any longer. Who were they to celebrate in the halls that echoed with my memories, my struggles, and my triumphs? The weight of my resolve pressed heavily against my chest as I prepared to reclaim what was rightfully mine.  
  
The weight of my revolver felt both reassuring and menacing in my grip as I pointed it at the crowd before me. As their laughter died away, replaced by gasps and hushed whispers, a chilling silence fell, so profound that the faintest sounds could be heard, echoing like ghostly whispers in the vast ballroom.  
  
Trembling with a mixture of fury and desperation, I began my speech, my voice a raw, thunderous force in the room. "You took my home, you people took EVERYTHING from me!" My words, laden with anguish and betrayal, hung heavily in the air. Murmurs of confusion and concern rippled through the crowd, their foreign language weaving a tapestry of incomprehensible sounds around me. Eyes darted, searching for their leader, the orchestrator of this invasion, but he remained elusive, hidden amidst the sea of unfamiliar faces.  
  
"You CAST me into a FUCKING pit full of CORPSES! And you have the DISRESPECT to DANCE and PARTY IN MY FUCKING HOUSE?!" I bellowed, my voice cracking with the weight of my emotions. Their faces mirrored a mix of guilt and defiance, creating an unsettling tableau of tension.  
  
In the midst of my raging accusation, a sudden, icy presence at my back sent shivers down my spine. I barely had time to react before a swift strike knocked the gun from my hands. Gasping for air, I crumpled as a powerful knee slammed into my stomach, the impact stealing the very breath from my lungs. In an instant, my weapon was wrested away, my struggle futile against the overwhelming force of the two men who seized me.  
  
They led me, weakened and defeated, into the living room just across from the ballroom. The haunting melody of the piano, once so carefree and vibrant, resumed its melancholic tune. Yet, its notes were muffled, silenced by the sliding doors that closed behind me, enclosing me in a world where the very essence of my existence had been usurped, leaving only the faintest echoes of a life that once was.  
I found myself forced into a plush armchair, its familiar contours embracing my body. It was a seat I had occupied countless times before, a sanctuary within my own home, but now it held a sinister aura. Across from me sat the man responsible for the shattering of my world, his form eerily mirroring my own.  
  
His features, once hidden behind a mask of unfamiliarity, now struck a chilling resemblance to mine, albeit marred by the passage of time and the cruelty etched into his expression. His beard, once wild and untamed, was now reduced to stubble, his hair meticulously styled to mirror my own. The clothes that adorned his frame were mine, stolen symbols of my identity.  
  
With a measured grace, he leaned forward, his fingers reaching out to delicately remove my glasses, leaving my vision distorted and vulnerable. Swiftly, he replaced them with his own spectacles. Through the lenses, the world morphed, and when I looked upon him again, he bore an unsettling resemblance to me. It was a twisted reflection, a mockery of my very being, sending shivers down my spine.  
  
He spoke, his voice heavy with a chilling calmness that sent shivers down my spine.  
"I reckon you're looking for some sort of explanation?" he inquired, his eyes fixed on mine. I nodded, my curiosity mingled with an unsettling dread.  
  
"It began when I was coming of age, a young man destined to inherit a great empire," he began, his gaze shifting to a distant point. "In my world, everything had gone splendidly. The South had won the war, our fields prospered, the town flourished, and the natives were enslaved into our workforce. One morning, I ventured for a walk through the retention wall meadow. It was then that it happened. A blinding blue light erupted to my left, and before I knew it, I was pulled feet first into its pulsating brilliance. I saw darkness, white globes, white lines, all connected in a cosmic tapestry. The light at the end of this riptide of air brought me through, and I experienced gravity once again, plummeting to the ground, landing on my glasses."  
  
He paused, his voice weighed down by the heaviness of the truth he was about to reveal.  
"There, standing before me, was your father, my father, our father," he continued, his eyes distant and haunted. "I pleaded for help, but he approached me with a dark murmur, 'You're not my son...' as his hand drew closer to his revolver. It was self-defense, really."  
  
I stared at him, shock and disbelief enveloping my senses. My eyes widened, and my jaw hung slack in disbelief.  
  
He noticed my reaction but showed no remorse in his cold eyes. He continued, revealing his twisted path.  
  
"I ran, deep into the forest, and the natives, they cast me into the Starve Pit. But I was strong, unbelievably strong. Three months, three excruciating months, I sat in that pit. They saw my strength for what it was, and I was put into their ranks.   


We lost that war, but I knew, I knew that if I could become their Chief, their leader, I could lead them to victory. And I did just that."  
He finished his monologue, leaving me in a state of shock and disbelief.  
  
"What happened to the townsfolk?" I finally managed to ask, my voice trembling with concern for the fate of my friends.  
  
"We gave them until sunset to pack their belongings and leave, and they did just that," he replied matter-of-factly.  
  
Relief washed over me. My friends were safe, spared from the clutches of these wretched people. But my fear for the future remained.  
  
"So, what comes next?" I inquired, my voice tinged with dread.  
  
His response sent a chill through my bones, "Well, once I get rid of you, I'll resume normal operations. We'll expand the fields, acquire more slaves, and, overall, achieve far more than you could ever accomplish."  
  
A sinking feeling of despair settled in my chest. "Where's Eddie?" I asked, memories of my dear friend resurfacing, making my heart heavy.  
  
"He's buried under the treehouse tree, just where he wanted to be," he replied.  
  
"Alright," he continued with a sinister finality, "I have a celebration to attend, one of many. Gentlemen, please escort Jackson to the Wendigo's territory."  
  
I was dragged out of the manor, my body moving with a reluctant compliance, but inside, a storm of determination brewed. I knew what I must do. The moon cast an eerie glow upon the wilderness surrounding us as we ventured in the direction of the Wendigos' territory.   


With every step, my mind raced, formulating a plan that had to be executed flawlessly. As we reached a secluded spot, I seized the moment.  
  
My actions were swift, a surge of adrenaline lending me an uncanny agility. I shook my right arm out of the man's ever-loosening grip, the cold metal of my blade finding my palm with a familiarity that sent shivers down my spine. In one seamless motion, I lunged, burying the blade deep into the man to my left. The world blurred as blood sprayed on my cheek, his grip faltering as he crumpled to the forest floor. But in his fall, he took me down with him, the impact jarring my already injured body.  
  
The man I had managed to break free from advanced, his face contorted with a mix of rage and determination. With a brutal stomp, he crashed his boot onto my leg, reopening wounds that had not yet healed. Agonized screams pierced the night, but surrender was not in my vocabulary. I retaliated with a feral desperation, my blade finding its mark in his leg repeatedly. He staggered back, his face twisted in pain, before collapsing to the forest floor.  
  
I crawled toward him, a primal fury burning in my eyes. Straddling his now writhing form, I unleashed a relentless barrage of stabs, each strike fueled by a potent mix of fear, rage, and survival instinct. Long after he ceased moving, I continued, the rhythmic thuds of metal meeting flesh resonating through the night.  
  
Eventually, my frenzy subsided, leaving me panting and covered in sweat and blood. Rising on shaky legs, I felt the pain vibrating through my open leg wounds, each step a reminder of my determination to survive. I moved swiftly and silently, my senses heightened to a keen alertness, as I made my way across the moonlit road, praying I remained unseen by the guards. Once I reached the other side, I scanned the forest ahead, searching for any sign of safety.  
  
Once I reached the other side, I ventured deeper into the forest, my eyes scanning the surroundings for the hidden cache I had instructed Eddie to prepare months ago. Amongst the dense foliage, I discerned something unnatural, a slight irregularity in the earth. My heart raced with a mixture of hope and desperation as I knelt down and dug around the area. Finally, my fingers brushed against the familiar texture of wood, and I unearthed a wooden crate nestled in the undergrowth. Eagerly, I pried off the lid, revealing the contents I had hoped for, a detonator. Eddie had managed to complete it before his untimely demise, a testament to his resourcefulness and loyalty.  
  
Tears welled up in my eyes as I glanced back at my manor, the place where I had spent my entire life. It stood tall and proud, now occupied by guards who were not my own, stationed on the balcony like vigilant hawks. Memories flooded my mind, fragments of my childhood, moments with my family, all of it was about to be razed to the ground. I wiped away a tear, my resolve hardening with every heartbeat.  
  
Taking a deep breath, I braced myself for what had to be done. With a simple yet resolute movement, I pressed down on the detonator. In those brief, heart-wrenching seconds before the explosion, I covered my ears, shutting out the world. Time seemed to stretch into eternity as a deafening silence enveloped me, anticipation building with unbearable intensity.  
  
Then, with a thunderous roar that echoed through the forest, the manor erupted into a colossal fireball. Debris flew in all directions, flaming tongues lashing out like vengeful serpents. The very essence of my home, my legacy, was devoured by the flames, collapsing into the basement with a resounding crash. It was reduced to a smoldering pile of rocks, splintered wood, and charred remnants of lives once lived. The air crackled with heat, and the acrid scent of burning memories lingered, marking the end of an era.  
  
I emerged onto the deserted road, my steps echoing in the heavy silence that hung like a shroud over the charred remains of my past life. As I knelt before the remnants of my home, a poignant sense of finality washed over me, mixed with a strange cocktail of relief and regret. Yet, amidst the ruin, my attention was drawn by an ethereal glow in the distant background, flickering faintly on the slopes of the imposing mountain that overlooked the island. Memories, once buried deep within my subconscious, clawed their way back to the surface, guiding my gaze toward that distant luminescence.  
  
An eerie calm settled over the scene as I picked up a lantern, its glass encasement cold against my palm. The light flickered to life, casting a feeble glow that cut through the surrounding darkness. With each step I took, the crunch of gravel beneath my shoes harmonized with the whispers of the night breeze. I passed Eddie's freshly dug grave, a solemn testament to the care that this alternate version of myself held for our fallen brother.  
  
Continuing my journey, I traversed familiar landmarks - the shooting range where I had honed my skills, the pond where I had once found solace, all now abandoned, covered in a blanket of ash and melancholy. As I ventured deeper into the forest, nature seemed to conspire with time, concealing the secrets of the past beneath layers of vines and foliage. It was there, at the precipice of the starting cliff, that I almost missed it - a concealed entrance, obscured by a tapestry of verdant life. Determined, I pushed aside the overgrowth, revealing ancient doors, adorned with intricate carvings, standing ajar in silent invitation.  
  
With trepidation, I ventured inside, stepping into a dimly lit hallway. Papers, yellowed and weathered, lay scattered on the floor, bearing the weight of forgotten knowledge. The hallway stretched before me, seemingly endless, disappearing into darkness where the sunlight dared not tread. The tendrils of creeping plants stopped where the light ended, their emerald hues swallowed by obsidian shadows. Amidst this enigmatic ambiance, a lone button beckoned to me, its purpose clear.  
  
I pressed the button, and the machinery came to life with a low hum. The elevator, a relic of another era, descended, each creaking motion punctuating the weight of the events that had unfolded in recent days. As I waited, suspended in the echoing silence, contemplation enveloped me, weaving a tapestry of thoughts that traced the contours of my past, my choices, and the uncharted future that loomed ahead.  
  
The elevator arrived, a relic of gears and pulleys, its metal grate sliding open with a groan that resonated through the empty chamber. Stepping inside, I was enveloped in the stale scent of rust and ancient machinery. The worn buttons beckoned, and with a practiced motion, I pressed the one marked for the peak laboratory. The elevator stirred to life, an orchestra of creaks and hums accompanying its ascent. Ropes strained under the weight of my journey as I ascended, the world below gradually shrinking into miniature proportions.  
  
Finally, the elevator reached its zenith, and the grates slid open once more, revealing a semi-circular chamber bathed in the golden hues of the sunrise. The sun, a molten sphere, cast its radiant fingers into the room, illuminating the remnants of my world. From this vantage point, I beheld the consequences of my previous actions; my home, now a smoldering ruin, sent embers soaring into the surrounding wilderness. The island, dry and vulnerable, succumbed swiftly to the consuming flames. The crackling inferno roared, devouring all in its path, and I stood in silent witness to the havoc I had wrought.  
  
Amidst the fiery spectacle, a movement to my left caught my eye. Before I could react, a swift blow struck me, and we grappled over the gun, desperation etched into both our faces. Luck, it seemed, had deserted me. The trigger was pulled, and agony erupted as the bullet tore through my side. I crumpled to the floor, a searing pain radiating through my body. A pool of crimson life slowly formed beneath me.  
  
My assailant loomed above, gun still in hand. Recognition flickered; he was one of my slaves, an escapee. Had it been two months since his flight? Perhaps he had been eluding us, navigating the shadows and evading both our pursuit and the nightmarish inhabitants of this island. Was this hidden chamber his sanctuary all along? The questions faded into the background, drowned out by the drumming pain and the grim realization that fate, in its twisted way, had caught up with me at last.  
  
In the dim glow of the chamber, the stranger lowered his weapon, the metal clinking softly as it settled in his grip. Our eyes shifted from each other to the machine looming before me. Its intricate   
machinery, a labyrinth of gears and wires, seemed almost sentient, pulsating with the memories of epochs long past and those yet to come. With my gaze fixed upon it, the floodgates of my consciousness were thrown wide open, memories cascading through my mind like torrents of time. The past, the present, and the ominous specter of the future danced before my eyes.  
  
We stood at the threshold of the third loop, on the cusp of the fourth. The anguish I had endured throughout this tormenting cycle, the relentless pain and suffering, had etched deep scars upon my soul. An overwhelming fatigue settled within me, a weariness born from the ceaseless repetition of my existence. The facility, ancient and weathered, stood as the only unyielding constant amidst the ebb and flow of time. It was the linchpin that held the loop together; if it were to fade away, to vanish into the obscure folds of nonexistence, perhaps the loop itself would cease.  
  
In the silent chambers of my mind, I implored the stranger to put an end to it, to disable the machine and liberate me from this cyclical torment. But then, a torrent of memories washed over me, memories of hope, of a purpose yet unfulfilled. If the machine reset, I could find the elusive cure, the cure for Eddie, the means to vanquish the Natives, and, beyond all the suffering, the power to dismantle this infernal contraption forever."NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!" The anguished cry ripped from my throat, reverberating off the cold metal walls. The stranger turned toward me, his gaze steady, unfaltering. "PLEASE! PLEASE DON'T TURN IT OFF PLEASEEEEEEE!!!!!!" I pleaded, my voice cracking with desperation. Tears coursed down my face, mingling with the sweat of fear and despair.  
  
I watched through blurry eyes as the stranger approached the machine, his hands deftly maneuvering its ancient controls. The loud whirring that had haunted my existence for so long gradually ceased, replaced by a haunting silence that seemed to reverberate with the weight of my own mortality. "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!" I screamed, my voice raw with anguish, but my cries fell on deaf ears. The stranger descended into the waiting maw of the elevator, disappearing from sight without so much as a backward glance.  
  
Alone, I crumbled. My body convulsed with sobs, my breaths ragged and erratic. I retrieved this journal, my trembling hands leaving ink smudges across its pages, and I write as the darkness inexorably closes in around me. The time of my existence here, in this endless loop, draws to a bitter and inevitable end. If, by some twist of fate, you find these words, heed my desperate plea: turn the machine back on, let the loop resume its cruel dance. For in its cruel repetitions lies the flickering hope of redemption, a hope that, for now, remains beyond my grasp.  
  
I studied the man across the table, his eyes mirroring the intrigue that gripped me after finishing the ancient journal.  
 "Where did you find this?" I inquired, my curiosity piqued.  
  
He met my gaze squarely. "My friends and I explored that island, long before that Californian fucker swooped in, barricading it off from the world," he explained, his voice holding the weight of memories.  
  
"How much?" I asked, sensing the gravity of the answer before he even spoke.  
  
His reply was swift and unyielding. "1500."  
  
I chuckled, trying to lighten the atmosphere despite the weight of his words. "Come on, this pawn shop has been here 25 years, and that journal has sat on your shelves all this time. Let's be reasonable. I'll give you 500."  
  
His gaze hardened, clearly aware of the worth of the artifact in his possession. "1000," he countered, not an ounce of hesitation in his tone.  
  
Unbeknownst to him, that was the sum I had been willing to part with all along. With a composed demeanor, I swiftly wrote out a check and pocketed the journal. Stepping outside, onto the seawall of Galveston, Texas, I felt the salty breeze tangle my hair.   


My lineage had always been an enigma, but as I stared out into the boundless expanse of the ocean, where distant ships and oil rigs blurred into the horizon, I sensed the whisper of a new adventure, a chapter yet to be written, waiting just beyond the waves.
