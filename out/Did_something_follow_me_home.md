This is something that happened to me many years ago when I was about 20 years old. I was in college, living at home, and I used to babysit for extra money. I was more or less outgrowing it, and the last family I was working for was about to outgrow their need for me as well. But I enjoyed this family and their girls and they all loved me. Unofficial big sister status. Easy money, lovely family.

They lived in a 1950s split level house. If you don't know what that is, you enter the house on the main floor. Kitchen to the left, living room with high ceilings on the right. You could walk up a half flight of stairs to the bedroom level with a hallway or down half a flight to a finished basement. If you were in the basement, the bedrooms and hall were overhead. There are no rooms above the living room or kitchen. Make sense?

Around 8PM I told the youngest it was time for bed. These kids never gave me any grief about bedtime, but when I tucked her in, she told me she felt like something was watching her. She still went to bed without a fuss. A little later, the older girl told me it was time for her to go to bed and did not need me to tuck her in. Now it was just me and their dog downstairs hanging out watching tv.

I hear thumping noises above me, like walking around upstairs, loudly, which never noticed before. The dog heard it too. It kept happening so I went up to check on the girls and they were both in bed. Went back downstairs. Footsteps ensued. Check again. The third time, I decided to sneak up there and catch them out of bed. They really were asleep. The thumping footsteps kept happening intermittently all night and each time me and dog would look up. Mom finally came home and I said, "Caroline, I never noticed but your house makes some weird noises!" and she laughed it off and said yeah, sometimes "I get freaked out."

I drove home. The entire ride I had the feeling like I was being followed and something was right behind me. It was unsettling. That feeling persisted when I got home and was walking around my house getting ready for bed. I went to bed, and in the middle of the night, I woke up unable to move, with a blacker than the dark room shadow hovering over me. It seemed like sleep paralysis as couldn't move my body, however I could shake my head back and forth in terror. The shadow felt evil and primal like it wanted to get in me. After a few seconds, my rest of my body was released and I dove under the covers like a little kid. This happened the next night as well. After that, I slept with a super bright halcyon lamp (90s...remember those?) for a full month. It never happened again.

I know the logical explanation is sleep paralysis, however, the lead up to the event was really weird, and it felt like something bad followed me home from the family's house that night. Although my body was frozen, I could still move my head and I'm unsure if sleep paralysis works that way.

What do you all think? Sleep paralysis or something sinister?
