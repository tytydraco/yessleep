I was five years old when my mother told me to stay away from school buses.

Specifically, yellow school buses.

It was on her death bed. Cancer. I didn’t really understand what was going on, except that my mom was going away for a while, and I wouldn’t be able to come with her. It was before Christmas, and snow was falling outside the window. I had jumped onto mom’s hospital bed, crawling over her frail body and situating myself next to her—ready to eagerly tell her about how excited I was about the snow, and that it meant that Santa was coming, when she grabbed my hand, and her grip had been firm enough to shatter my excitement. Dad had gone to get snacks, and grandpappy was asleep by the window. It was just mom and me. 

I remember trying to tug from her grasp because it hurt a little. I mean, it was enough to panic me. Mom never grabbed me like that—but when I looked into her eyes and caught her expression, a desperation and pain I wouldn’t yet understand, I stopped trying to pull away from her. Mom’s smile had been thin. I knew she was trying not to scare me, though at the same time making sure to plant the words into my head and taint them into my being, so I would never, ever forget. “Cole.” Mom’s voice was barely a rasp. She took my wrists and squeezed them with the last of her lingering strength. 

“If you see a school bus,” her grip was suddenly harsh, emphasising each word slipping from her cracked lips. “I want you to run as far as you can, okay?” When I didn’t answer, confused, she leaned forward, her ice cold breath flittering in my face. “Run. Until you can’t run anymore. Can you do that for me, honey?” It was strange. Mom had barely spoken a word all day, and there she was speaking to me in full sentences. Dad told me it was possible there wouldn’t be a chance to talk to her again, but my mom was speaking in complete clarity.

“Mommy?”  I remember reaching out to wrap my arms around her neck, but she caught my wrists again, her expression igniting to life. She never talked like this. Ever since mom got sick, all she did was sleep and stare out of the window with a faraway look on her face, like she was at peace with the inevitable. It was jarring seeing my mother like this. Like she was awake for the first time in a long time, awakening from a trance. I didn’t know what cancer was. I just knew it was a bad thing, and that it was making mom sick. 

But I was never told which cancer it was, and what stage. I just watched it suck the life from her. In that flicker of a moment though, right before the snowfall stopped outside, white flakes dancing across the panes of the window, I realised my mom was going to die. And between that dying breath was one word which sent my younger self tumbling off of the bed, before a crowd of white figures bloomed into view, shoving me from the room.

“Run.” Her eyes weren’t on me. She was looking past me, at something I couldn’t see, an oblivion only visible to her.

“Run! Do you hear me? You need to run, Cole! Get out of here!”

She was screaming, then, her voice cutting into me, and I was paralysed, wanting to crawl towards the door, but I couldn’t move.

“Go!”

Those words never left my head—and neither did my mother’s voice screaming at me to run. Dad came into the room soon after and managed to calm me down, but it was too late. Mom had slipped away while I had been sitting on the waiting room floor sobbing into my knees, and trying to shake away her voice which hac crept its way into my skull. Nightmares followed. 

I dreamed of my mother becoming a big, scary monster, her sweet face morphing and twisting into something horrific, a three headed thing with razor sharp teeth. Every time a school bus passed, I tensed up, and I remember feeling like the world was coming apart around me. 

I couldn’t breathe, and I had to be told repeatedly that I was okay. But mom had died, leaving me with a fear which was eating me up inside. I didn’t even know why I was scared of them. Grandpappy asked me on the way home from kindergarten. He gently took my hands and asked me why I was scared. I told him I didn’t know, only that mom said that they were bad. I was quickly reassured that my mother had been on a lot of pain meds which made her say things she didn’t mean. I nodded and told them I understood, but I didn’t. 

Because for the first time in what felt like forever, mom had actually looked at me. Spoke to me. Without slurring her words or getting distracted. Dad took me to therapy, but I was just told I was a child with an over-active imagination in grief. It did get better eventually. Before I knew it, I was eight years old. Four years since my mother’s death, and I only ever heard her voice when I was upset or alone. 

Her words were still deeply rooted inside of me, though I knew how to control my thoughts. I even got over my fear of school buses, after dad had practically dragged me onto on my first day of third grade and embarrassed me enough to suppress my fear. I don’t know what I expected. Maybe I expected the bus to grow sharp teeth and eat all of us. But that didn’t happen. It was just a normal bus—and I felt stupid for listening to my mom. Dad was right. I had an overactive imagination, and yellow school buses were nothing to be afraid of. My third grade teacher was called Mrs White, and on the very first day of third grade, she had told our class that we were special, before planting her face into a pie made of whipped cream, making us all laugh.

The boy in front of me laughed so hard, he snorted on a gummy worm he had been slyly chewing on. Mrs White was different to my other teachers. They talked about math and fractions, and boring stuff like that. Mrs White told us stories about her times traveling the world and sang songs to match each country. I loved her classes. 

I loved sitting at the very back and doing work in my workbook, watching Mrs White dance around the classroom, twirling around, and pulling kids from their chairs to dance with her. She made us do tests which weren’t math or English. Instead, we had to focus real hard to read what was written on a blank piece of paper. Initially, I couldn’t read it. None of us could no matter how hard we squinted and flipped the paper over, frowning at it from different angles. Mrs White reassured us we were close.

“Practise means perfect!” She would always sing when kid’s started to cry with frustration. I will say it started to get painful. The girl sitting behind me, Pippa, started complaining that her head hurt. Followed by other kids. Though with the pain came clarity. One day, Pippa jumped up, raising her hand, her lips split with glee. “Mrs White!” She squealed, waving the paper in the air. It was several months into the school year, and every day we were expected to spend at least an hour trying to read the piece of paper. 

None of them had even come close to being able to read a seemingly blank piece of paper, only getting headaches. 

Noah Carlisle got a nosebleed, and Mrs White gave him tissue paper to wipe his face, pushing him to break through the pain. Pippa wasn’t exactly the smartest in the class. She thought Canada was the capital of Australia. 

So, we were all surprised when she jumped from her desk, swiping at her head. Twisting around in my chair to look at her, I could tell from the crinkle between her brows and the slight curl in Pippa’s lip that she was in pain. “I did it!” She squealed, attracting Mrs White’s attention.

“Oh?” Mrs White’s eyes glittered, her smile widening. “What does it say, Pippa?”

I hadn’t noticed how pale the girl was, until I was looking at her properly. Pippa was a redhead, so her skin complexion was practically pallid white, while her hair bounced in a ponytail. Her hand holding the piece of paper was trembling, but her smile only stretched right across her face. “It says,” Pippa cleared her throat dramatically to make sure everyone was listening, and that she was the centre of attention. I didn’t like Pippa. She pretended to be the smarty pants, despite knowing all her test answers were wrong. I couldn’t help feeling jealous of her.

“It says….” Pippa dragged out the words, giggling.

“She’s taking too long.” Jax Caine grumbled in front of me. When he caught my eye, the kid looked equally annoyed.

“Yeah, I bet she’s lying.” Maddy McIntire spoke up loudly. If there was a third grade social hierarchy, Maddy was at the top. She stuck out her tongue at Pippa. “Can you tell us? We’re getting bored.” The girl mimed a yawn, and the rest of the class giggled. “Unless you’re lying, Pippa.”

Pippa’s eyes narrowed. “I’m not lying!”

“Then tell us what it says!” Maddy’s lip curled. “You’re just pretending so you can be all dramatic. I know you’re lying."

“Maddy, that’s enough.” Mrs White shot the girl a look, and Maddy backed down, turned around in her chair and huffed loudly. The teacher’s attention flicked back to Pippa. “Alright, what does it say? You can tell the whole class, sweetie. Don’t worry, they’ll be able to see it soon.”

Nodding, Pippa showed us the blank piece of paper. “It says we’re going on a field trip!”

Now, that sparked excitement.

With the promise of a possible field trip if we all managed to see through the invisible paper, our class tried harder. There were more headaches, more nose bleeds and crying, before Jax jumped up from his chair one day, practically vibrating with glee. I think he was so excited he didn’t notice blood dripping down his chin. 

Mrs White cleaned him up, and praised him, promising him and other kids that they could go on the field trip. Maddy was next. Of course she was. The girl was super dramatic, doing a twirl in her dress, claiming that she was the best because she didn’t suffer a headache or a nosebleed. I did, however, glimpse the girl shoving bloody tissue paper into the trash bin during recess. I started to notice a change in kid’s who had been granted permission for the fiend trip, and the rest of us who were still struggling. Pippa has grown unusually silent since announcing that she could read the paper. 

Mrs White had given her extra work to do, though every time I slipped past her to go to the bathroom, I noticed the girl wasn’t even writing. Instead, her eyes were half lidded, her lips set into a dreamy smile. 

Pippa could see something I couldn’t. Swallowing a thick paste which started to creep its way up my throat, her expression eerily reminded me of my mother’s. Needless to say though, I really didn’t want to be left out of the field trip. So, despite my classmates acting stranger than normal, I forced myself to break through the barrier Mrs White talked to us about at the start. When explaining what exactly the exercise was, our teacher told us that there was a barrier inside every brain. 

To make this sound easier to understand, she did a theatrical re-enactment, making it extra goofy. Mrs White stood in front of a desk and pulled a face. “This.” She slapped the wooden top. “This is your brain, everyone!” When we all laughed,  she shoved a chair in front of the desk. 

“And this? This is the scary barrier which is stopping you from reaching your potential! But!” Her grin made me laugh harder. “What if we were to knock over the chair, hmm? That’s what I want you to do with your paper. I want you to visualise breaking the chair, so you can see the desk more clearly.”

“Breaking the chair!” We all sang when our teacher jumped onto the desk and pumped her arms. “Breaking the chair!”

So, that’s what I did.

Or… I tried to.  I was one of the last ones to break through the barrier. There were three of us left, and the field trip was looming. 

One night, I asked dad if he could help me solve a problem. Mrs White told us not to tell our parents about the super fun games we were all playing, so I asked him how I could solve a particularly hard math sum—to which he had looked up from his laptop, and offered me a pensive smile over his coffee. “Try relaxing your mind, and think about something else,” dad told me. “And then, who knows? Maybe if you put less strain on yourself, it might come to you?” He did pull a face though. “Cole, what exactly was the math sum? I can give you the answer if you want?”

Shaking my head, I insisted I could do it myself. Then I did exactly what dad told me to do. I didn’t think about the blank piece of paper all night, and during normal classes, I pushed it out of my head. At recess, there was nobody to play with anymore. The kids who could read the message stayed in class, staring into thin air. 

Sometimes, Mrs White brought people into class to talk to them. They weren’t teachers. I didn’t know who they were. All of them had scary faces and were my dad’s age. I watched them poke and prod my classmates, asking them questions like, “Are you able to see this?” While holding several blank pieces of coloured card. Jax, Maddy, and the others nodded their heads while Mrs White stood by with an odd look on her face. I had decided that day I would become like them. I wouldn’t be left out like the other two kids. 

So, I slumped down at my desk, put my head down, and glared at the paper until a dull pain was blossoming behind my eyes, the lights above me suddenly far too bright. Blank. I stared harder. Blank. I gritted my teeth so hard I could taste rusty coins at the back of my mouth. Getting progressively more frustrated, I decided that I was going to pretend that I didn’t care. Just like when my PlayStation didn’t work, and I squeezed my eyes shut, praying for the game to load. 

Trying the same tactic, I clenched my fists and mentally told the piece of paper I didn’t care. I was through caring, and the stupid thing could go away. Stubbornly, I sat with my arms folded, staring into the backs of my eyes, before deciding I had spent enough time ignoring the paper. Cracking one eye open, I expected to find the same blank piece of paper in front of me. However, this time the paper wasn’t blank. I was half aware of rivulets of sharp, startling red spotting white, but my eyes were glued to a sentence written in bold at the very top. “Mrs White’s Third Grade Class! You’re Going On A Field Trip!”

Dad was right. Ignoring my own blood staining the collar of my shirt, and pooling on my desk, my own lips split into a grin.

It was trying too hard, trying to force it, that was stopping me from breaking through. Once I told everyone I could see the paper, I was let into this secret group they were all part of. This time I knew what they were doing. Our teacher told us to focus on a blank piece of paper, just like the one we had already been tested on, and then try and visualise certain things in front of us. Blobs, to be exact. We were reassured that the field trip would elaborate on what Blobs were, so until then we had to practise. The first piece of paper I received was a teddy bear.

That was easy. I could visualise it perfectly, until I could reach out and touch its prickly fur. Then the images started to get blurry. So did the sessions. I remembered the start of them, but time seemed to pass by quickly, and before I knew it, I was sitting in the back of dad’s car, trying to remember what I had been doing all afternoon. But I was still happy I broke through the barrier. Mrs White reiterated that on the day of the field trip, when we were lining up to board a bright yellow school bus. I tried not to look at it. 

I had gotten over my fear, sure. But with it standing right in front of me, all bright and scary looking, and exactly what my mother had warned me of, I couldn’t resist ducking my head, hiding behind Maddy, who was jumping up and down, showing everyone her brand new lunchbox. “That is what I wanted you to do.” Mrs White told all of us with a smile. She was wearing an extravagant colour that day; a bright yellow dress which matched the bus. “All I wanted you to do was switch off your brain, which of course allowed you to break through that barrier.” Stepping aside, she allowed us to start jumping onto the bus. 

After hesitating, I made my way up the steps, squeezing the pole way too tightly. I noticed Mrs White wasn’t alone. There were three others with her, situated at the very front of the bus. I found a seat at the back, making myself comfortable by the window.

 The school bus wasn’t scary. That is what I told myself, over and over again, gripping my seat for dear life.

“Seatbelts!” Mrs White shouted, cupping her mouth.

“Where are we going?” I spoke up.

The teacher laughed. “Well, this is an educational field trip after all, so about we learn about the human body?”

Jax raised his hand. “How are we going to do that, Mrs White?” His eyes widened. “Are we going to a museum?”

“No, I don’t want to go to the museum!” Maddy twisted around to glare at him. “I want to go to the zoo! Can we go to the zoo?”

The bus was unusually fast, which I immediately hated. The other kids, however, were squealing in delight. It wasn’t just going fast though. It was going so fast I felt like we were… flying. 

Turning to the window, my stomach twisted at the sight of white fluffy clouds and an expanse of blue sky. We were flying. All of the dread which had been eating me up inside turned to unbridled excitement which almost sent me off my chair. I joined in with the laughter and glee. Maddy turned around to me, her eyes wide with amazement, and I stuck out my tongue at her, giggling. We were flying—and not just that. The school bus was expanding and shrinking, allowing us to travel inside living animals, like horses and pigs. 

“Alright everyone!” Mrs White jumped up from her seat, waving her arms. Outside, the windows were a scary red colour, as we delved inside different animals. “Who wants to learn about the digestive system?” She winked. “But this time, it’s the human one.”

Shaking her head, the teacher chuckled. “No, I’ve got something even more exciting planned! Have you ever wondered what it’s like to delve into the human body, and see all the wiggly bits? All of your organs? Bones and blood, it’s all wonderful! Don’t you want to see it?”

“Ewww!” Pippa giggled. “I don’t want to see all of the gross wiggly bits!”

“Well,” Mrs White cleared her throat, “How about we talk about the digestive system? Hands up! Who’s hungry?”

“Me!”

“Me!”

Mrs White’s field trip’s became an everyday sort of thing. We learned everything, from the inhabitants of fish and mammals, to how the human digestive system works, by taking us inside unsuspecting people. Mrs White taught us about red and white blood cells, bacteria, and germs. She even showed us a germ. 

I could see it right outside the window, and Maddy screamed so loud everyone laughed. I loved every field trip, and anticipated where we would be going each time. I got used to the flying school bus. Instead of screaming, like my first few times, or just staring in shock, I threw up my hands like everyone else, singing songs with my classmates and Mrs White. It wasn’t until the new girl started when things started to get a little less clear. 

The new girl was called Cassandra, and according to her, the field trip’s at her old school were tonnes batter than ours. She made sure she let out know every class, which got annoying. Cassandra didn’t believe us about our adventures, only folding her arms across her chest and snorting. “Well, at MY school, we went to Paris.” She said smugly. We knew she was lying, and neither of us wanted her to come along on our adventures. I did find it strange that Cassandra didn’t’ have to try and find the message on the blank piece of paper like the rest of us. 

Mrs White eagerly welcomed her to join us on the bus, and I couldn’t resist feeling jealous that she got to come without breaking through the barrier. To my annoyance, Cassandra stalked onto the bus, pushing past Maddy and Jax, and slumping down in the seat next to me. “We had better looking school buses at my old school,” she said loudly, shooting me smile.

Jax pouted. “At my old school, we never shut up about my old school,” he mocked with a snort. 

Nobody laughed, and the boy ducked his head, his cheeks going red. “Well, I thought it was funny.”

“You’re not funny, Jax, and you never will be.” Maddy sang from the front of the bus.

“At my old school—"

The two of them cut Cassandra off before she could speak. “Were you this annoying at your old school?” Jax turned around to laugh at her, his eyes glinting.

Buckling into my seatbelt, I nodded along with them. “You don’t have to come, you know—if you miss your school so much.”

Cassandra shrugged. “Well, I don’t want to miss out,” she said. “And besides, at my old school, we didn’t have a choice.”

I snorted, and was ready with a comeback, before Mrs White came over, ducking in front of the girl. “Sweetie, can you move seats please?”

“Why?”

“Because I would like you to.” The teacher’s voice was firm. “Come on, Cassie.”

“I don’t like being called that.”

“I will call you Cassandra if you move seats for me, okay? It’s not hard, sweetie.”

Mrs White ushered Cassandrea to a window seat opposite me. My gaze followed her, as she sighed dramatically, and dragged herself to her allocated space. I was frowning at Cassandra’s backpack, at a superhero I couldn’t figure out the name of, when I saw it. On the seat in front of the girl was a small Tv screen.

I had never noticed it until right then—and once I had seen it, I couldn’t take my eyes off it. Cassandra looked equally confused. She pointed at the screen. “Mrs White, are we going to be watching TV? We weren’t allowed to at my old school.”

For a second, I caught an expression crossing my teacher’s face I had never seen before. I wasn’t sure what it was, but the energy seemed similar between the others she was with. They exchanged glances and spoke in hushed whispers before responding to the girl. “Uh, no, Cassandra,” Mrs White shook her head, maintaining a slightly strained smile. “No, we’re going to be going on an adventure! Are you excited?”

The girl’s eyes were sceptical, but she shrugged.

“Fine.” She wrinkled her nose. “I want to see all of the crazy stuff you guys supposedly see.”

When class began, and the school bus was catapulted into the air, all of us screaming in delight, giggling, most of us turning to see if Cassie was enjoying it—she wasn’t. In fact, she wasn’t even smiling. Her expression was blank, her wide eyes frowning at something. It wasn’t the mass of white blood cells flying past us, or the beating heart of the giraffe we had flown inside of. No, Cassie wasn’t reacting to anything. Her arms were folded across her chest, and she wasn’t moving. 

I ignored her at first. I thought she was just being annoying, and pretending she couldn’t see all the amazing things blossoming and coming to life in front of us. It was a whole new world, and Cassandra didn’t move once. When it was our turn to exit the bus, Mrs White gave us suits to make sure we were okay, and we could survive inside a human body. 

We had delved right into the centre of a man called Peter. Mrs White explained he had a cold, and we were going to watch the process of his body fighting the evil virus, which she had called a Blob. 

One by one, we jumped off the bus, and Cassandra followed us hesitantly, her eyes still wide and unseeing. She looked like she was going to cry, and I couldn’t resist poking her helmet teasingly. What I expected was for her to shoot me a glare or poke me back, but the girl didn’t even look at me. I don’t even think she noticed I was there.

It was so strange being inside a real human. When I reached out my hands, I envelope my hands in huge white blood cells beginning to attack the virus, or Blob. “Alright, everyone!” Mrs White stood at the front. “Now, do you all want to help the white blood cells fight the evil virus?”

“Yes!” Maddy giggled.

“Can we name it?” Jax shouted. “Let’s call it Bob!”

Our teacher laughed along with us. “Okay, so I want you to do exactly what you did in the classroom, okay? When you broke through the barrier, I told you to visualise certain objects in front of you.” She cleared her throat. “Now, you’re going to destroy the blob with it.”

I knew exactly what I was visualising. It came to me straight away, bleeding into my mind. I sketched it out in my head, something which was heavy and weighty in my hand, and that I could grasp on for. It was perfect for killing Blobs. Once I was imagining the object, I could feel it in my hands, sleek metal pressed into my skin. It felt right, and I knew exactly how to hold one. Looking around, everyone else did too.

“When do we shoot, Mrs White?” Noah asked, pointing his object at the blob. With narrowed eyes, his finger played with the trigger.

“Not yet.” Mrs White said, “I want you to wait until the Blob has decided to attack. Remember, by now Peter will be feeling the effects of the virus, and he will…”

She dragged out the word, and we all shouted, “Cough!”

“Or sneeze!” She laughed, “It really depends! So, we’re going to wait for the perfect moment to attack the blob, and then we will be sneezed out!”

Nodding along, I focused all my attention on the blob. I got ready, squeezing the trigger excitedly, vibrating with excitement.

Before Cassandra let out a sharp cry, slicing through my concentration, and snapping me from my focus. When I turned to her, the girl’s eyes finally found mine, and she looked… scared. No. Terrified. In her hand was the object, and she was pointing at the blob—but her lips mouthed words I couldn’t understand. 

Mrs White’s voice suddenly felt far away, and I found myself mesmerised by the girl’s words coming from her lips. She was bleeding. Badly. The sight of startling claret painting her face caused something in my mind to snap, and I felt my body jolt, like I had been electrocuted. Cassandra was still crying, but my surroundings were bleeding into nothing, from the thick red walls of Peter’s immune system, to tress and cloudy skies. So many trees. 

I recognised where we were automatically. It was the forest I used to go on walks with dad. Blinking rapidly, I was suddenly aware of something wet and sticky dripping from my nose, tainting my lips. I was standing in the exact same spot. I hadn’t moved. My classmates and Mrs White hadn’t moved. Though we weren’t inside the immune system of Peter, ready to shoot an evil blob. Cassandra’s words finally made sense, and I felt the heavy weight of something pressed into my hand.

“What’s going on?”

Cassandra spoke so softly, I don’t think anyone heard her. The rest of my classmates were still speaking like in front of them was an evil virus.

"Do we shoot it now?” Jax, choking on blood, swung his gun at what I thought was a blob. Looking closer, however, reality snapping back into place, it was a man on his knees. He was sobbing into the ground. “Please.” He lifted his head, and I remember staggering back, the gun slipping from my grasp. He didn’t have time to finish his sentence, when the world was exploding around me, what felt like thunderbolts slamming into my skull. I dropped to my knees, watching the man slump down in a pool of blood, a perfect hole in the middle of his forehead.

“I got it!”

Maddy did a celebratory spin. “Mrs White, I killed the blob!”

“No, WE killed the Blob.” Jax nudged her with his gun. “Hey, look!” He pointed at thin air. “It’s running away!”

“You did, indeed!” Our teacher sounded proud, as men and women in white grabbed the body of the man, hauling it away. “Well done!”

“I don’t understand what’s happening.”

Cassandra’s gun slipped from her grasp, but she was already being grabbed and dragged forward.

“No!”

She kicked and screamed, and I couldn’t understand why the rest of them couldn’t hear her. “No, let me go! I want to go home!”

Noah’s gaze snapped to her, and for a second I thought he was waking up. Instead though, he just laughed.

“Did you fight viruses at your old school, Cassandra?”

The girl was hysterical. “What? But I… I don’t understand what’s happening! You killed someone!”

“A virus!” Maddy sang.

“Onwards, Cassandra!” Mrs White shouted, drowning out the girl’s screams so my unsuspecting classmates continued on in this bizarre trance which had them in an unrelenting vice grip. “We need to save Peter, remember? Do you want to go inside his brain this time?”

The others cheered, and I found myself taking slow steps back. I didn’t run. If I ran, I would be caught too.

They started to sing, marching into the trees, and once I was sure my teacher had turned her head, and the men and women tending to Cassandra couldn’t see me, I turned and forced myself into a sprint.

I don’t remember falling. I remember my foot getting caught on a rock, though after that there was just the dark. I had vague memories of an oldish looking man looming over me, and the wet snout of a dog sniffing my neck and face, licking at blood staining my chin and face. When I woke, I was in hospital. Dad was next to me, and according to him, I had fallen during a field trip. I sat up, automatically spewing everything about Cassandra, and the gun’s, and the strange people with Mrs White. Dad’s expression crumpled, and he grasped my hand, telling me had hit my head and was having nightmares. 

The next day, when I asked if my classmates were okay, he nodded, again shooting me a look of worry. I quickly understand what he meant, and how he was feeling, because when I walked into my third grade class a whole week later, with a bandage around my head, there was no sign of them. Pippa, Jax, and Maddy and Noah. Even Cassandra. They were all gone. Mrs White too. It was the same classroom and the same desks. 

I even saw the plastic horse Maddy kept under her desk to regularly remind everyone she liked pony’s. However, Maddy was gone. Her entire existence had been wiped away.  I tried to tell dad. I tried to tell the principal, naming all of them and demanding to see their parents. Except there weren’t any parents, or if there were, they didn’t remember their own children. After school one day, after driving myself crazy trying to figure out where the evil school bus had taken my classmates, and what it had done to them, I saw Pippa’s mom standing just outside the school gate.

I already knew her name. Pippa’s mom made cookies for everyone when it was her daughter’s birthday.

“Mrs Parka!” Ignoring my dad waiting for me, I hurried over to her. Immediately, she seemed to stumble back, blinking like I was an optical illusion.

“I’m sorry, who are you?” She chuckled. But her expression was so impossibly sad, I couldn’t understand why her eyes were so empty, like she was waiting for someone. “I’m not supposed to be… here,” her hands were trembling by her sides. “I don’t even have a child, I just—”

“Pippa.” I said. “You have a daughter, Mrs Parka.” When she shook her head, I grabbed and shook her. “Pippa! You have to remember her!”

 “Cole!”

Dad was at my side, grabbing my arm gently. “What are you doing?” He shot an apologetic look at Pippa’s mom. “I’m sorry about my son.”

The woman didn’t reply, only turning away and walking back down the sidewalk, a slight sway to her step.

It was official. My classmates had been spirited away by my evil teacher, and nobody believed me. It got to the point when dad tried to force more therapy on me, and I was told once again that I was still grieving my mother. And due to the aspects of the “dream” I was clearly still dwelling on her last words to me. I threw a cushion in the man’s face and stormed out. 

Eventually, dad decided to move. Thank god. If I would have stayed in that town, knowing that a whole class of third graders had disappeared one day, completely wiped from everyone’s minds, I would have gone crazy. When I turned twelve, we moved to a quiet town where I started middle school and then high school. I refused to ride the bus to dad’s disdain, which meant he had to drive me to and from school, or I would walk forty minutes. 

There was no way I was getting on another fucking school bus. In my senior year, a friend invited me to hang out atter school, and the second he hopped onto his school bus, my gut lurched into my throat. They all looked exactly the same. The exact same colour, and paint job, and the pattern on the seats. I hated them. 

By the end of high school, I had managed to convince myself through smoking weed, a hell of  a lot of conversations with guys I hung with, and recreational drugs, that I had imagined it. 

For college, I moved the city. In my freshman year, I stayed in student dorms, and then moved into a house with a bunch of friends from class. They were like a second family, and yes, they did know about the school bus hallucination. In fact, my housemates bought me the full DVD boxset of The Magic School Bus for my nineteenth. So yeah, thanks a lot guys.

My girlfriend didn’t help. She thought it was… cute.

Anyway. Three nights ago, I was tired, and turned in pretty much as soon as I got home.

Barely teetering on the edge of slumber, I was awakened by my housemate’s boyfriend shaking me.

“Hey.” Ethan’s panicked voice brought me out of it. “Hey!”

I sat up, swiping at my eyes. “What is it?” I frowned at the dark room, blinking. “Shit. What time is it?”

“Cole.” Ethan grabbed my shoulders, and his grip was harsh. His eyes were almost comically wide, lips twisted. “You need to listen to me, okay? And you’re not going to freak out, because if you freak out, I am going to freak out, and I just want to know where Freddie is.”

It took me a second to take in his words.

“What?” His words dragged me to my feet. “Ethan, what—”

“There is a fucking flying school bus outside out window.” He said in a hiss. “And no, I am not making this shit up!”

Something ice cold crept down my spine, and I shook my head.

No.

No, that was all imaginary. I dreamed all of that, right? And even if the shit with the school bus was real, I was pretty sure my teacher had brainwashed my classmates into thinking the bus was flying—and that we were traveling deep into the body of a human being, or a mammal.

“Freddie.”

Instantly, my focus was on my housemates, while Ethan started jumping up and down, freaking the fuck out.

“Where is he?”

“I don’t know! I came to see Freddie, and the door was open. I headed upstairs to check his room, I turn around…and there’s a FUCKING GIANT SCHOOL BUS FLYING OUTISDE HIS BEDROOM WINDOW.”

My body was already in fight or flight. “Stay here.” I told him. “Don’t move, okay?”

Ethan didn’t reply. After hesitating, I made my way into Freddie’s room, which had been trashed. Fuck. Stepping towards the window, I drew in a deep breath. It’s not real, I thought. It couldn’t be real. Ethan regularly took shrooms, so he was clearly tripping. As I forced myself towards the window, however, there was definitely something outside. I drew the curtains back, and there it was. As clear as day, my third grade school bus hovering in front of our house. My first reaction was to start yelling, only once my gaze had found it, a familiar fog came over my thoughts. 

I remember feeling it on that very first day of our field trip. I didn’t remember climbing onto Freddie’s open window. I couldn’t feel the breeze in my hair. It felt like flying. Ethan was behind me. I knew he was behind me, because he was trying and failing to grasp hold of my shirt to yank me back. I was stuck. Mesmerised by the sight. Cassandra, who was now my age, and yet still had the expression of a child.

Instead of in its strict ponytail, her blonde hair hung loose on her shoulders. Her smile was empty, eyes vacant. Next to her, I saw other familiar faces. Now grown. Eighteen and nineteen year olds, kids who I thought had been dragged into oblivion. Cassandra was reaching out for me, and I almost fell for it. I almost let the dizzying fog take my mind once again. Thankfully, though, Ethan had managed to wrap his arms around my neck and drag me to my knees. I blinked, and the fog cleared away. Cassandra, however, wasn’t giving up.

Once I was on my feet, I twisted around to see the school bus had vanished out of existence.  

“Where did it go?” Ethan hissed. “What the fuck is going on?”

I caught him wrinkle his nose, swiping at his suddenly, and something inside me came apart.

“Pepper.”

“What?”

Ethan sniffled again.

“Pepper!”

I grabbed him, dragging down to the kitchen, yanking open cupboards, my breath in my throat. Thankfully, there was pepper in the cupboard. I poured some into my hand, pressing it over Ethan’s mouth. “You need to sneeze, okay?” I urged him. “Sneeze, or you’re going to die.”

His eyes widened. “What?”

Ethan’s gaze wandered behind, however, and he stumbled back, still swiping at his nose.

“Cole, where have you been?”

Jax was standing in the doorway, his arms wrapped around Freddie’s neck, a gun firmly pressed into his temple. Freddie’s eyes were wild, but he wasn’t fighting back. Despite being a loose cannon, he was choosing to stay calm. I hated how I recognised the way Jax held the gun. I remembered knowing exactly how to hold it, how to finger the trigger, and find my attacker’s weak spot. In my head, it had been a blob. Until reality had split open, and I was in fact murdering human beings, who were being wiped from my mind, twisted into a whole other world my childish brain could comprehend. Cassandra was next to him, pouting. She swung her weapon playfully, before pointing it directly at Jax. “We looked for you.” She said. “Mrs White looked for you, but we couldn’t find you, and that made us really, really sad.”

“Reallllyyyy saaaddddd.” Isssac nodded. He sounded exactly like when he was a kid, and the same expression on an eighteen year old guy looked wrong.

With words stuck in my throat, I couldn’t speak.

Cassandra stepped forward and handed me something.

It was a piece of paper. Old. Crumpled.

I snatched it from her hand and found myself looking at what looked like some kind of contract.

“I, _____ _______ give permission for my child _______ to become part of the MSB Foundation.

And underneath, was a signature, followed by my mother’s name.

My knees buckled.

There was no way, I thought.

Before I could speak, Cassandra stepped back, and so did Jax, pulling Freddie along with them.

“Why don’t you think about it, hmm?” Cassandra’s smile widened. “You can have a looonnnng think about it, and we can play with your friends while you’re thinking, okay?” She giggled. “Does that sound like fun?” She lifted a hand in a wave. “We’ve got them all, by the way!”

When the two of them left, I was still staring at the crumpled piece of paper in my hand.

My mom. 

Willingly or not, she had signed me over to… to what? 

It was much later, when Ethan was sleeping downstairs, and I was sitting in the kitchen trying to wake myself up, when my girlfriend swooped in, pulling me into a hug. “Cole, are you okay?” She asked, cradling my face. “You’re like, crazy pale. Do you want me to make you food?”

I caught her nose twitch, and she chuckled. “I think I’m getting a cold. It just came on suddenly, like out of the—”

I didn’t have enough time to stumble back or register what was happening—before a vivid explosion of crimson was coating my eyes, my face, my fucking cheeks. It painted me. I can still fucking feel it. My girlfriend covering me like paint. She was so warm, dripping from every piece of me. I’m not going to say my school bus exploded from her like in the fucking cartoons, because that shit isn’t real. But what I did, see, was her face expanding and bloating, like something was under her skin. I was standing in glistening, pooling red when I heard them.

Something whizzed past my face, like a fly. I wanted to swat it, but my body wouldn’t move.

“Two days, Cole!”

They sang.

“Or… we’ll play more games!”
