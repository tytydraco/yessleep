My unemployment ran out recently, thus forcing me off my ass and back into the real world.

Ugh.

After filling out more than *fifty* online applications and not hearing back from a single company, I was starting to lose all hope. Granted, it'd been awhile since I'd looked for a proper job, but I truly had no idea how bad it was out there.

As quickly as I dove back in, I'd given up on the search entirely.

Or so I thought.

The funny part is I didn't even go to Happy Burger looking for a job. I was just depressed and craving a meaty, juicy burger. And that's exactly what I got.

I ordered the #2 Combo Meal. Double cheeseburger, complete with the special (and very secret) "Happy Sauce," fries, and a soda - which I upgraded to a chocolate milkshake. Because why not?

I absolutely devoured the food. Afterwards, I sat comatose in my booth, slumped over and *almost* regretting the binge.

That's when I saw the HELP WANTED sign in the window.

I'd never worked at a fast food restaurant before and knew little to nothing about frying food or working a register, but I really needed the money and also figured I could get some free meals out of it.

*It'll just be temporary*, I thought. *Fuck it.*

I filled out an application and much to my shock, I was standing at the register less than a week later, taking people's orders.

*"Welcome to Happy Burger, how can I make you happy today?"*

\*\*\*

The job was simple enough, though I quickly learned that simple jobs tend to be boring as all hell. Nevertheless, I was employed and that's all that mattered.

Towards the end of my first shift, the manager, Rick, called me into the back office. Rick was a really short dude who had a blonde mustache and wore cowboy boots all the time. Don't ask me why.

The first thing I noticed when I headed in there was that Rick had a weird look on his face. Almost like he was paranoid or something.

*Maybe he's stoned too*, I thought to myself.

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that I got stoned before work. Sue me.

"Matt, right?" Rick finally said, looking up at me.

"Yes sir," I responded. "Did I... do something wrong?"

"No, no. Not at all. It's just, uh... Well, I had to change the schedule around a bit. I know I originally said I was giving you the afternoon shift, but I need someone to cover nights now. It's 8pm to midnight. You'll be out by 1 after cleanup."

"Oh, okay. Sure. I can do that."

If I'd known what I know now, I would've told him to fuck off right then and there.

"Thanks so much, Matt. You're a lifesaver," he sighed. "Starting tomorrow night, that'll be your new shift."

"Cool."

As I walked back out the door, I had the sudden urge to ask him something. I guess I was still curious as to why Rick seemed so frazzled about getting a simple shift covered.

"Did the other guy just quit or something?"

He stared at me for a moment, dead-eyed.

"What?"

"The other night shift worker," I said. "Did he leave you high and dry?"

"Oh," said Rick. "Yeah. Exactly. You're not a quitter, are you?"

"No, sir."

Rick smiled a weird, forced smile. His behavior was... odd, to say the least, but I didn't think much of it.

I should've been paying closer attention.

\*\*\*

The night shift was way more quiet than I thought it would be. I also didn't think it would be *just* me and one other guy working.

Pitty (that's his name) ended up being pretty cool, actually. We had a lot in common. Just like me, he's also in his early 30s and loves to get stoned before work. In fact, that night we smoked a joint together in the back alley five minutes before work started.

That's where we first bonded and shit.

"My last name is Pitts," he told me. "Then, in high school, everybody started calling me Pitty for some reason. It just stuck."

"That's cool. I wish I had a nickname," I smiled, choking on smoke.

"I'll see if I can think something up," he said, grinning.

Anyway, we spent the first part of that night just talking.

"So... the manager doesn't come in at night? What about the fry cook?" I asked.

"Nope. Just us. Budget cuts, man. But don't worry about it. I'll teach you how to work the fryer. It's easy as shit."

*We're never going to have to work the fryer at this rate*, I thought to myself, staring out at the empty restaurant.

\*\*\*

Somtime around 11pm, Pitty not so smoothly rolled his body up over the counter (almost like when people try to slide on the hoods of cars and fail miserably) and headed towards the bathroom.

"I gotta take my 11pm shit. Don't get too scared without me."

"Trust me. I won't," I said.

But I soon regretted my words, because the place actually became *very* creepy *very* quickly when you were all alone in there.

I decided to head to the back of the kitchen (out of view from the security cameras) to scroll on my phone while I waited for Pitty to finish his business.

*Only one hour left,* I thought to myself.

And that's... when I heard it.

It was the sound of one of the chairs in the restaurant being dragged across the floor. At first, it startled me. I peaked my head out from around the corner to see if it was either A. a customer or B. Pitty fucking around.

*But there was no one there.*

I walked back to the register. Eyed the restaurant again. The booths were empty. Tables wiped down. Everything in its right place.

"Hello?" I called out.

Nothing.

"Pitty? Did you finish your shit? Are you fucking with me?"

Silence.

I was just about to shrug off the whole thingâ€“

*And that's when I fucking saw it.*

There was a figure.

Standing just outside our restaurant.

Face up to glass of the furthest window.

I couldn't fully make out the image in the dark, but I saw enough to know that it was a fucking **clown**.

*"Shit!"* I screamed as I involuntarily jumped.

Ever since I was a kid, I've always *hated* clowns. They absolutely terrify me. Luckily, I'd gone years without seeing one.

Until now.

I suddenly felt like a scared little kid again.

But as quickly as the clown had suspiciously shown up in the window, I blinked, and then he was gone.

*What the fuck?* I thought to myself.

I slowly made my way around the register and carefully crept up to the window.

I stood right at the glass and looked around the empty parking lot.

Nothing.

Not a sign of movement or life.

*Is someone trying to fuck with me? Did Pitty put them up to it?*

My heart was beating fast. Too fast.

"Yo."

*"Jesus!"*

I whipped around and nearly had a heart attack, but it was just Pitty.

"Dude. What the fuck? You look like you just saw a ghost."

For a moment, I couldn't speak. I kept glancing out the window, expecting the clown to appear again.

"Why are you looking out there?" Pitty seemed genuinely confused.

"I... I thought I saw something," I mumbled.

"Yeah? What was it?"

I considered telling the truth, but then I realized how insane it would sound, especially coming from a person currently stoned.

"It was... a clown," I finally admitted.

I expected Pitty to laugh at me. But he didn't.

"Wait. Are you serious?"

"You think I would fuck around about that? I *hate* clowns. They scare the shit outta me."

Pitty just stared at me for a while, like he was trying to figure out if I was joking. Obviously, I wasn't. I was fucking scared. And his reaction was making it worse.

"What is it?" I asked. "Have you seen him, too?"

"No, it's just... the guy who used to work this shift with me, Jorge, he was saying the same shit. Apparently, he kept seeing some clown. It freaked him out."

"Was he high, too?"

"Nah. The dude didn't drink or smoke or anything."

My mind was racing. There had to be a logical explanation here. "That must've been why he quit, right?"

"If he quit, he never told me," Pitty said. "It was kind of weird, actually. He texted me last week, rambing and shit. Said he had something important he wanted to show me. That night, he didn't show up for work. That's when I told Rick and he said he'd find someone else to replace him."

My stomach was knotting up. Like someone was tying balloon animals with my guts.

"Why didn't you tell me?" I asked.

"I didn't wanna freak you out on your first night."

None of it made any sense.

"I don't understand," I admitted. "So who the fuck is the clown?"

Pitty opened his mouth, but then stopped himself. It was like there was something he didn't wanna tell me.

"Dude!" I shouted. "Out with it!"

"Okay, look... Jorge did some research and found out Happy Burger had a mascot back in the day. A clown. I think his name was... well, *Happy*. But they discontinued him. He also found some old commercial on a VHS tape from the 80s. And he kept saying the clown he was seeing was definitely Happy the clown. But I... didn't really buy into any of it."

My heart started thumping even harder.

*Shit. Fuck. Shit.*

"Why did they discontinue him?" I finally asked.

"I think because he was scaring the children. You know some kids hate clowns?"

"Yes. I do."

"Anyway, don't trip. It's most likely just some weirdo playing a prank on us. Probably for social media or something."

I mean, it was a good theory, but this definitely didn't feel like a prank.

This felt... *wrong*. But I couldn't exactly explain how I knew that. It was just a feeling.

Pitty headed back to the register and started cleaning up for the night, while I looked back to the parking lot.

Empty and still and dark and silent.

I couldn't get that white painted face out of my head.

Just... smiling at me in the window.

I shivered.

I knew there was no way I was going to be able to sleep that night.

\*\*\*

I was home and in bed by 1:30, tossing and turning.

*Maybe I should just quit tomorrow morning*, I thought to myself.

I briefly imagined a scenario in which I went into Rick's office and told him I was out, just like Jorge. He'd probably be disappointed, but would quickly go on to hire the next sucker into working the next shift in a heartbeat.

Then Happy would be someone else's problem.

The next time I checked the clock, it was 3:45. I sighed. Still wide awake. Heart fluttering.

*You're overreacting*, I told myself. *You need this job until you find something else*.

And that was thatâ€“

Until it wasn't.

The first thing I thought was that my television was glitching out in the other room, because just then, I heard someone *laughing* in my apartment.

It was a maniacal, crazed cackle. As if someone had just heard the funniest joke of all time.

I hopped out of bed and stumbled into the living room, only to find the TV *wasn't* on.

The laughing had stopped, the room now dead silent.

*Jesus, I'm still stoned*, I told myself. *And delusional.*

I took two steps back towards my bedroom, passing by my TV and that's when I saw something in the reflection of the black mirror.

It was Happy again.

Standing *right* behind me.

White face and wide grin.

I immediately whipped back aroundâ€“

But there was nothing there.

I was alone in the dark.

I *ran* back to my room, slammed the door shut and locked it. Then, I climbed back into bed and waited for morning to come.

You know how they say not to "bring your work home with you?"

Yeah.
