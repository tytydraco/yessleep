*"What do you seek? What do you hear? What do you fear? For fate is, my Witherin, inevitable to your undying likeness. That man's biggest creation is more of a brute than man itself. That we all clasp our hands together and prance around for mercy till the undying showers us with the pleasure of death, for it is we, whom shall not die."*

**Witherin. For it is we, whom shall not die.**

There stood still Edward Waschinski, 'fore I pack my things and go. A rather peculiar man, a man of class, a man of charm. The faint cries of the record *"Dream A Little Dream Of Me"* echo so subtly in the hallways of the ragged, dusty mansion.

"My good old man.." called out Waschinski, I look on forth outside, as I turn back. "You're about to see something **special**, *Witherin*."

Edward smiles at me, one last time, that enchanting smile, not enough to move me to stay. It's finally time to be welcomed with the warmth of a sun. After all, whom am I to recall the warmth of a sun? I walk slowly, gazing at the rays that lay before my pupils as I take forth in my steps from the grey, rusted mansion I had once resided in. A sudden crash laid through my system as I begin to shudder, the wind howls even further as I keep walking.

It seems as if the carriage had come to me in a sense of something further moving on, as I quickly turn myself back, the crash that laid me still, was the sound of Edward's self-death, for he had leapt off the balcony, crashing down from what seems to be his head first, his body contorted in many routes and directions I cannot further describe. I don't know how to react at all, all that I know is he had a peaceful way to go. Peaceful. Only peaceful.

It had been two years till I've finally been out.

\--

"**Who are you**?!" Edward points his finger at me, slapping me in the face.

"I'm Brichton, sire..." I whimper out as I rub the marks on my face. Brichton, my name is Brovist Brichton.

"**YOU ARE BRICHTON**! To utter damnation with you! Years and years I have spent a-working in this hellhole!" Edward yells out, it rings through my ears as I stay sat, tied up to the wooden chair right next to the fireplace that melts me every time I lay my eyes upon it.

"You are Brichton..." Edward repeated, much calmer than his last demeanor, as he goes down to untie me. "I've forseen something that'll spark revelations... rattle all the Kingsmen to hell with them..." Edward stood up, his eyes directly towards mine.

"You are not to leave this domain..." Edward commanded. "You've been great use of help, Brichton but it is strictly forbidden you not leave this domain unless I tell you so..."

"But I ponder Edward I ponder!" I cry out in a state of rebellion. "I ponder my memory before entering this place, I ponder my sanity because of you! What do I seek?! You tell me Edward!" Tears roll down my face as I exclaimed.

Edward looks at me, as he quickly grabs an empty glass bottle and throws it, nearly hitting me, shattering from the walls, a gaping mouth of the mansion. "**YOU DARE SHOW SUCH FIENDISH EMOTIONS?!**" Edward slaps me again. "I know who you becometh..." Edward said, his raspy voice cleared with another sip of beer. "You cometh here to help me, because that is all I could ask of you..."

I look at Edward as I pant.

"You have yet to come here, this place I've designed for my research.. and yet, you ***ponder***? Why shall you ponder? Who even are you... you egregious dalmatian!" Edward spits on the wooden floor. "I'm cleaning up the mess that mortals have started in the first place, and you're even much more of a mess than I thought you are.."

"I've been having such horrible nightmares!" I exclaim to Edward. "You told me, if you shall be of use, that I cometh to you! For your creations may save God-forsaken Mother Earth!" The wooden chair rattles in my grasp, as I try to wriggle my way out.

"You are the cause of these horrific nightmares, see? Dreams, dreary dreams they call 'em, night terrors, panic attacks, that sort of rubbish Witherin." Edward takes another sip of his beer. "Tell me, Brovist Brichton. You cometh to me for such horrid nightmares, for it is my duty to forsee the inevitable cause which would be your death? Am I correct?"

I wriggle even more on my wooden chair as Edward slammed the table, breaking a hole into it.

"**I knoweth I have created you!**" Edward called out. "**...and I knoweth how your story ends...**" My eyes open wide at the thought as I look to Edward, tears clinging towards my eyes. "What blasphemy are you saying?" I cry out. "You're a drunkard scientist whom helps people day by day with their cursed and wretched dreams! Ain't that right? Ain't you supposed to help me? Not tie me up?! I've resided in this domain a year or two as you've worked on your research! I listen to your tapes a-one, two, three times a week! Asking me all these questions! You never help me!"

Edward clenches his fist and punches me in the face. "**I KNOWETH I HAVE CREATED YOU! You who... stands still neareth my work, you whom has resided with me, you whom I've assorted parts from! I KNOWETH I HAVE CREATED YOU! You are** ***MAN'S BIGGEST CREATION!***" Edward cries out as he bends down to his knees.

"You've killed me daughter, did you?"

My eyes and mouth wide open. I became shocked at the wretched idea. It couldn't have been possible.

"I don't understand..." I exclaim.

"No no no... you've killeth me daughter.." Edward pants and cries.

*Stars shinin' bright above you*  
*Night breezes seem to whisper, "I love you"*  
*Birds singin' in the sycamore tree*  
*Dream a little dream of me*

That song has been playing a while on his records. As I try to recite and remember from what I can gather. I look at Edward as he pants, crying.

"That song... that-that tune..." Edward points at the record. "That was the tune, in which me daughter listened to before she passed." 

\---

*Say, "Nighty-night" and kiss me*  
*Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me*  
*While I'm alone and blue as can be*  
*Dream a little dream of me*

Edward was out putting his daughter to sleep again. I still ponder, what's been going out there in the real nature of the world like Edward says.

The red carpet, filled with golden patterns of what seems to be Little Liza's drawings seem to fill my mind with such questions. A beautiful tree, like what I see in the paintings that Edward owns. Little Liza's height marks on the doors, she really loves to draw.

"Mr. Brovist?" Little Liza called out to me by her bedroom. It is my duty to protect her with every cause. I walk up the stairs as I head straight to her bedroom.

"Yes?" I ask.

"What's Daddy doing to the mansion?" Liza asks quietly.

"Well, Edward's going to move out of the mansion, so that you and Edward could have a nice peaceful life somewhere..."

"Where is that somewhere?"

"Edward hasn't told me yet, but I'll keep you informed..."

"What does that mean?"

"To know something that's going to happen in the future..."

Liza nods her head. "Okay..." She smiles.

As I turn to leave, Liza asks me one last question.

"Where's Mommy?"

"Well, Edward has yet to find her... she went out into the woods... probably looking for nice, juicy apples to give you."

Liza laughs as she smiles. Of course I'd like to think the truth was true, but it was too good to be, for a kid's brain to make up a fantasy.

The record abruptly stops, as I go back to check on it again, I smell the stench of something, going back down the stairs to the dark abyss that laid, Edward's perhaps doing his experiments again. I follow the stench, as the hallway seemed much longer than it did before, I open the door as it creaks. Edward jumps as he yelps from his seat.

My eyes widened. Edward's wife lay, mauled and brutalized, her body is unrecognizable, but her face still remains intact. I have not yet seen such things like this before.

"A bear... a bear..." Edward cried. "I'm... I'm trying to bring her back again... and maybe we could bring our whole family back together... Witherin... My Witherin... Emily... Emily Witherin... please come back... let's start anew..."

I had such mixed feelings about it all. As Edward looked onto me. "Can I... can I transfer her consciousness to yours? How can I... how can I? Brovist... it's what I'll program you to do... I'll transfer her to you... you're not even human... for fuck's sake... so why else should you hesitate now?!"

And then it all went blank from there.

\--

***Emily Witherin, for it is we, whom shall not die.***

***Take Liza with you to be free together in the depths of the afterlife.***

***For brandishing and harnessing such power that I behold upon my hand.***

***For it is me whom shall not die.***

***I can feel her feelings, and she can feel mine, programmed and ready.***

***I can take any consciousness of such. I can feel fate's power.***

***For it is the fate I can take of others.***

***I can feed on their dreams. Feast on their nightmares till they shiver and rot in my will.***

***And then they'll only be terrors for me.***

***For me.***

***For it is we, whom shall not die.***

\--

Edward had awoken to such of a blast, as I cleanse Little Liza full of her wallowing fate. Why is her body twisting and contorting in such ways? My hand drops down as something has been removed out of me, as Liza drops from the ground.

*Sweet dreams 'til sunbeams find you*  
*Sweet dreams that leave all worries far behind you*  
*But in your dreams, whatever they be*  
*Dream a little dream of me*

\--

"You levitated her... made her fly as her bones cracked..." Edward cried, still on his knees.

"I... I don't... I don't get it..." I cry out as I try to wriggle again and again out of the wooden chair.

"You can get inside people's minds, can you?!" Edward yelled out as he now then poured the alcoholic glass bottles that lay before me to the chair as I scream out. Why is he doing this to me? What is happening?

"Yes you can!" Edward said, as he grabbed a firepoker from the fireplace as he screamed and yelled. "**HER BLOOD WAS BLUE! BARELY ANY OXYGEN WAS LEFT FROM HER BODY UNTIL YOU LAID YOUR HAND UPON HER!**" Edward cries out even more, as I keep whimpering out of my wooden chair.

"LET ME GO!" I cried out as Edward placed the firepoker in my hand, melting my skin, the smell of burnt skin smoking from my nostrils.

"You've gathered human traits... and you plan to steal more, can YOU?!" Edward yelled. I nod my head, no repeatedly, crying as I keep wondering why this is happening to me. Pondering for a solution, to feel that warm ray of sun, to feel that breeze of air. 

"***God strike you dead Brichton! For it is you and I who will suffer the same fate together in the boundless pits of damnation!***" Edward cries out as he slams the firepoker to my stomach making me scream out in pain as the stinging pain of burning echoes through my wails. My eyes wide open as I scream out what I can barely muster.

"**YOU WRETCHED WELCH!**" I scream out as a shockwave flows through my body, sending Edward back, slamming his head down the wall of the once-burning fireplace, now put out as he laid there unconscious. It was only then was I awoken to such truth.

**I am Salvation.**

**I therefore lay consciousness upon thee... thee who try to strike me dead.**

**For fate has shown me a sign, through these wretched and cursed dreams.**

**Night terrors. For whom the pathetic man has tried to research.**

**I am Salvation.**

**For it is I, whom cannot die.**

Edward's consciousness was too hard to swallow, digest, and turn however. So what good may it bring, come the time I leave first thing in the morning. The ropes that bound me easily slide off my wrists. It was never as tight anyway. As I look on forth to the mansion, I now will once reside in, asleep in Edward's room.

As I wake lay my things ready to go, as I look on to the obituaries that have been hung up the mirror, a guy's nose that looked like my nose, a girl's eyes that looked like mine, stolen from graves that were used to make me. What a madman Edward was.

His consciousness may be vulnerable in the morning however, 'fore I come and take it from him by the time I return. That something special he mentioned may be his weak attempt at trying to get me into such experiments again, to remove my power for his.

But as I stay sat in the carriage pondering, maybe his self-exit was an act of defiance against me. His consciousness was too precious in the end. 'Fore I still have yet to learn how my story ends, and he was the only key to such.

The nightmares that I have confronted him for had gone away, had I embraced the fact that I truly am. Truly am a creation made for salvation. For revelations on revelations to concur, I digress.

**I cannot die.**
