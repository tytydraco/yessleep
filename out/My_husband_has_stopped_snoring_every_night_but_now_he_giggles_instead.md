It happens throughout the night. My husband spends those 8 hours giggling at varying volumes; I’m fairly certain that it never stops completely, but during the quiet spells, I finally manage to drift back to sleep.

I actually found it cute at first. Heck, until Neil started acting strangely during the day, I was fully considering posting this on some other subreddit designed for quirky little anecdotes.

The changes were tiny, at first. Eating cereal without milk and wearing his work tie near-backwards. Yes, backwards; it sat askew on his shirt, fully tucked under the lapel of his blazer.

“Have you been sleeping well, Neil?” I asked one morning.

“Perfectly well, Lottie,” he chirpily replied, whilst nibbling on half-frozen bread.

I winced at his odd—in fact, quite *inhuman*—behaviour. “Sweetie, did you even put that slice in the… Never mind. Look, I’m worried about you. You’ve been acting differently over the past few weeks.”

“Right,” he simply said. “I’ve stopped snoring, haven’t I? That was what you wanted.”

I frowned. “Well, yes, but the giggling in your sleep is—”

“Ah,” Neil interjected. “Distracting? I suppose I’ll have to find a way to stop that too.”

Now, I’m aware that none of you know my husband, but believe me when I say that these blunt, mechanical responses were uncharacteristic.

And things have only worsened over the past month. He’s become so sincere. He used to be sharp and witty, not blunt and impenetrable. That’s really the best way to describe it. He’s not Neil. Not anymore. I have no idea what’s happening in his mind. Now, he only displays an ounce of humour—of *humanity*—at night.

Even then, there’s no longer anything very humorous, to me, about his giggling.

In fact, it makes my toes curl.

“I’ve been wondering… How *did* you stop snoring, Neil?” I asked at breakfast, after another couple weeks of noticing small peculiarities in his daily routine. “You used to do it most nights, but you’ve not done it for nearly two months now. You just sleep-talk—well, sleep-*laugh*.”

He blankly replied, “I found myself a life coach.”

I laughed, crossing my arms and leaning against the kitchen counter. “A life coach?”

“That’s what I said,” my husband answered. “He’s the best. Tough love is his approach. He chewed me up and spat out something better. He’s going to make all of us better.”

“Us?” I repeated, chuckling playfully. “Right. Well, I didn’t realise you’d joined a, what, self-improvement group? I wish you’d told me, but that’s… great news. I’m still a little confused though. A life coach trained you to stop snoring and start laughing in your sleep instead?”

And then—

“*I said I’d fix the laughing*,” Neil icily hissed, before lifting his eyes from the morning paper to offer me a wretched smile; it was so slight and stiff.

Like every other behaviour he’d exhibited, it wasn’t my husband. There’s something no other way to put it.

I gulped, feeling a change in the air—feeling stifled in that room. “Neil… I’m not telling you off. I wasn’t even telling you off, a couple of months ago, for snoring. You know that, right? I was just saying—”

“That it had been stopping you from sleeping,” Neil finished, interrupting me again. “And I’m sorry. *I’ll be better, Lottie*.”

I really don’t know how to explain what his demeanour was doing to me, but I know that it left me instinctively wanting to flee. I found myself near-subconsciously shuffling towards the kitchen door.

“Listen, it wasn’t just about me,” I half-convincingly promised as I continued to back away. “I mean, yes, okay, the snoring *did* keep waking me up, but I always managed to get back to sleep. That wasn’t the big issue. I mainly wanted you to see a doctor. Remember? I was worried that it might be sleep apnea. Weren’t you worried too?”

“Oh, I don’t know. I don’t worry about much anymore, Lottie,” he whispered, then he rolled his eyes back down to the morning paper, without so much as moving a muscle in his face.

I nodded slowly, then asked the question that—in an ordinary sleep-talking situation—might’ve seemed silly; there was, however, nothing ordinary about any of this.

“Why do you keep giggling in your sleep, Neil?”

His smile didn’t widen, but it also didn’t shrink. It remained at that fixed, robotic level, as if this man—the funniest and warmest man I’ve ever known—had become an empty vessel. Something donning a human mask for my sake. Something that had, most horribly, never smiled before.

And he just kept staring. Didn’t answer my question. Just stared and smiled in that same unnerving manner.

“I’ve got to go to work,” I meekly choked, before finally rushing out of the room.

I arrived home around nine-ish, having stayed at the office past dinnertime, as I was too unsettled by my husband’s behaviour to want to return to our household—too unsettled to want to spend the evening with him.

When I got back, every light in the house was off.

“Neil?” I called as I took off my shoes in the hallway. “I’m home.”

I searched downstairs. No lights. No Neil.

So, I went upstairs and checked our room. And there, lying in bed at nine o’clock in the evening, was my *night-owl* husband—a man who used to slide next to me at two in the morning. But I didn’t think much of that; it was hardly the most disquieting aspect of his behaviour over the past two months.

No, it was the *sound* which drew me, on knocking knees, into the bedroom.

He was giggling again.

One of his whisper-giggles.

Typically, during these periods of quieter laughing, I usually manage to tune him out and drift back to sleep.

However, it felt different to be standing at the end of the bed and watching him. My husband. My *new* husband. The sleep-giggler. It sounds so fucking stupid, I know, but it wasn’t stupid at all—and even if it were stupid, that wouldn’t have stopped it from being terrifying.

Besides, when I tell you what happened next, you’ll stop laughing.

Just like he did.

I held my breath as the room fell into silence—weighty silence that crept across my flesh even more bitingly than Neil’s haunting giggles, believe it or not. The quiet was worse. I actually *longed* for him to make a sound.

But I didn’t long for him to say what he said.

“*I see you too.*”

And then an excruciating exhale escaped from my lips, draining my lungs and tightening my skin to my shivering body.

Neil was sitting on the bed, straight-backed against the headrest, and eyeing me from the blackness.

I don’t know when he stopped lying down—was he *ever* lying down? I’m still not sure. After all, my eyes had taken a moment to adjust to the darkness of the room.

*Oh, God, was he sitting like that before I even entered the room?* I wondered. *Was he giggling at me?*

And then it came again. Another timid laugh from the man I used to love. Only this time, for the first time since all of this began, my eyes weren’t closed. I wasn’t half-asleep. I was wide awake, and my eyes were wide open. I was looking at Neil—the man whose face I could distinguish more and more with every passing moment.

I finally understood what I was seeing.

I dry-heaved, and my scream was buried somewhere in that hacking sound—spilling out of my quivering lips as I started to keel forwards.

From Neil’s lips, which stood marginally open as chortles flowed out, came a finger.

A withered finger with a bruised nail.

A finger that, with another one of his hearty chuckles, Neil managed to swallow back down—rather than having the regurgitating effect that one would expect. Through the flesh of the thing’s neck, I saw that lump travel down his throat—five finger-shaped lumps pressed against the outline of the skin until they disappeared below.

I didn’t find words. Didn’t even find the physical power to turn and flee until—

“*Do you want to be better too, Lottie?*” the thing in front of me croaked as it slowly crawled, on hands and knees, across the bed.

Following a brief moment of pause, towards the end of the duvet, Neil flung his body like a limp instrument. Flung it off the mattress and towards me.

With a scream, I finally retreated—across the landing, down the stairs, and out of the front door.

In my panicked flight mode, I didn’t grab my car keys. I don’t know whether or not I had time. I just ran, and ran, and ran. Ran until the wind had well and truly left my lungs.

An elderly couple found me sobbing and shaking, near a bus stop, and they immediately called the police. That was two hours ago, and now I'm sitting in a police station.

*Not a lot the law can do*, they say. *No evidence of assault*, they say.

So, they won’t protect me from it—whatever *it* may be. But I’m not going home. That would be insane.

What should I do?

I mean, obviously, I need to leave. My husband is gone. God, I don’t know *where* he’s gone, and I want to cry about that, but I'm still in flight mode.

Should I run? Run, then pray that it never finds me?

No. It’s *going* to find me.

I’m sure of that because I keep replaying Neil’s words in my mind—words that make me think this thing chose my husband.
