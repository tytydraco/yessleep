Hey um, weird question but, anyone know how to stop dying? See, I thought I was tripping at first, but nope. I am pretty certain that I am sitting next to myself. And no. The other me is not breathing. No pulse, no nothing. I stubbed my toe, shouted “shit,” then things got weird. Now I have a corpse of myself. Next to myself… there isn't really a wikiHow and the WebMD results were decidedly *not* helpful, so I'm really at a loss right now. 

I checked the toe on the other me, and it looked quite unhappy. That pinky toe looked more like a small thumb with how swollen it was. What was weirder, was my toe was completely fine. I really didn't know what to make of my current conundrum, so I just didn't. I took a nap.

When I woke up, the body was still slumped at the foot of my bed. I hadn't been holding my breath or anything, but seeing it was still there was almost… disappointing? I knew I had been up late with classwork for the past few weeks, but hallucinations persisting through a nap? That was new. I shrugged off the strange incident as a new coping mechanism for stress, and left the body on my bedroom floor. I made a mental note to bring this up tomorrow, with my therapist.

Anyways, I had to eat before class. I threw a pan on the stove, and dropped some chicken in to fry. The olive oil sizzled, then spat. A small bead of oil singed my hand… then things got weirder. Just as the pain registered in my mind, my mind blanked for a second. Then I was beside myself again, this time in my kitchen. I should really bring this up at therapy. 

I had two electives and a lab.  Somehow, I made it through the day. I was still somewhat disappointed to come home and see the two bodies in my apartment. They were both rigid at that point. They wore the same outfit I wore. But they were devoid of life. Empty shells. A chill made its way across my spine.

I dragged the two bodies into the laundry room, propping them up against the washing machine. At least that way, they were out of sight. Plus, I could lock the door from the outside, so I could rest easy knowing they wouldn't suddenly wake up and kill me in my sleep. Assuming they were real, and not an unfortunate misfiring of neurons creating the illusion of reality.

That night was rough. The strange events from the day replayed in my mind, keeping me tossing and turning. So much so that I slammed my knee on the wall, a wave of pain crashing through my nervous system. In a blink, I was looking at something… furry? I whipped around, slapping the lights on. Jumping from my bed… it was another me. Clutching his knee.

I gingerly shifted my weight, expecting pain to pulse up from where I had banged it. No pain came. I maintained eye contact on the new me. It did not move. I jumped when something vibrated in my pocket. And my other pocket.

My phone rang. On the third buzz, I answered, without checking the caller ID. “Hello?” I answered, throat hoarse. “Hey honey! How ya liking living alone?” Mom chirped. I had been on my own for a month now, and we had spoken every day. The other me's phone continued ringing, then the buzzing died after the fourth jolt. “Mom, um. Things are weird? But-um I think I'm okay?” I wasn't sure whether to explain my delusions, or if I should keep them to myself so as to not worry her. “Honey, it's normal to be homesick. You're always welcome to see us!” Mom reassured, after weighing whether or not to address the uncertainty she heard in my voice. “Goodnight mom,” I said,  hanging up. I had to check something.

Reaching into the same pocket my phone was in, on the other me, I withdrew the Android. My fingerprint didn't match, but the facial recognition picked up and opened the lock screen. I saw one missed call, from mom. She had left a voicemail. I clicked on play. “Hey honey, I was just checking in for the day. Sarah reached out saying you seemed off today in class, and I just wanted to make sure everything was alright,” mom asked, uncomfortable smile clear, despite not seeing her. My mouth went dry as I gulped. There's no way she left a voicemail while we were talking.

I dragged the other me into the laundry room, collecting the other two mes’ phones, finding a different  voicemail on theirs. They both went “hey son, just checking in. Sarah reached out to let me know you skipped your lab today, and I was worried. Call me when you get the chance, love you!” Again, my fingerprint failed to open either of the two phones, but facial recognition unlocked both devices.

I studied all four phones. The lock screen, pin, wallpaper, all the same. I could verify which was mine based on which one accepted my fingerprint. Aside from that, I genuinely could not tell them apart. I shuddered, then decided to experiment with something. I picked up one of the laundry room phones, and called mom back. She picked up on the first ring. “Hey honey! Glad to hear from you!” Mom cheered. “Hey mom, um, I went to the lab today?” I started, unconfidently. “Oh honey, it's okay to skip a class here and there. I'm just happy to hear you're okay,” her relief was audible. “Mom, I just spoke to you?” I pressed. After an uncomfortable delay, she said “no baby, I haven't heard from you all day. Are you alright?” My head started to throb, not in pain, but from confusion and anxiety. My mom never played pranks. Never would joke like this. She wouldn't mess around. Something was seriously wrong here. “Y-yeah mom,” I answered weakly, hanging up before she could press me further. I locked the three me's in the laundry room, then lay back in bed. The four phones sat on my nightstand, and I failed to sleep the rest of the night.

I skipped class the next morning. I sat in the waiting room from the moment the doors were unlocked at 8:30am, until my 1pm appointment. I had the four phones in a small lunchbox, my own phone among them. Some part of me thought that isolating them, leaving them for Doctor Wisconsin to see, would somehow leave just my phone in the lunchbox. Not to mention, I could not stomach watching the time pass. I just needed this appointment to start. The time finally came.

“Hello Mr Brooks, how has your week been?” Dr. Wisconsin smiled, then dropped to a frown at the sight of me. “Oh no,” she mumbled. “Can you just, um. Look in here, please?” I offered her the lunchbox. She took it, grimacing as she opened it. One brow raised and the grimace faded as whatever she was expecting, she did not find. Instead, she pulled out the four phones. “Well that's new?” She inquired.

“Th-they aren’t…” I choked, “mine?” I questioned, unsure of myself. “Then, where'd ya get em?” Wisconsin inquired. “My pocket?” I answered. “But like… not *my* pocket? If that makes sense?” I winced, knowing how bad it sounded. Wisconsin cocked her head, expecting some sort of elaboration.

“Have you been ta-?” Dr Wisconsin started, only for the four phones to buzz in unison. A reminder for my appointment sent all four phones into minor quakes. Wisconsin jumped a little, dropping the four devices. We both lurched to save the phones, butting heads in the process. Again, one moment, pain erupted in my forehead, then was gone the next. Again, I say beside myself.

Dr Wisconsin raised her glasses, then rubbed her eyes. Replacing her glasses on the bridge of her nose,  she frowned once more. “It appears I am seeing double. I may have concussed myself?”

“Doctor,” I drew an unsteady breath. “You aren't seeing double. This is what I meant by the phones not exactly being mine. There are three more me's back home. I think I'm losing my mind.” I spoke as calmly as I could, although my voice still quivered. “So there are five total?” Dr Wisconsin asked, expression hard to read. “Four bodies, plus myself. So five I guess?” I shrugged again.

“Well, this is certainly a new one,” the doctor mused, shaking her head.

“That was not at all reassuring, doctor.” I stated, shaking my head. “No, I don't imagine it was,” she cleared her throat. “What I can assure you of, is I certainly do see the issue here,” she gestured at the corpse slumped over, beside me. “Soooo what now?” I pressed. “I suppose we ought to call an ambulance for you?” Dr Wisconsin half stated, half asked. “But I'm fine?” I stated, shifting uncomfortably. “That one is clearly not,” Wisconsin said, pointedly. 

“Well, I am fairly certain it's dead,” I assured her. “And how is that supposed to be comforting?” Dr Wisconsin fluttered her eyelashes in disbelief. “Well, I guess, just, y'know. Don't worry?” I shrugged. I've shrugged a lot lately. “Mr Brooks, are you telling me not to worry about a dead patient, sitting on my mother-in-law's second hand couch?” Dr Wisconsin spat, incredulously. “I mean, yeah?” I shrugged for the unteenth time. The doctor pursed her lips. Then she scowled. “We can't continue with a corpse in the room. Mr Brooks, a moment please.” The doctor handed me the four phones from the floor, stood, and calmly exited the room.

A couple minutes later, she returned with a wheelbarrow and some contractor bags. She wore thick silicon gloves, the scrubby kind. I had never seen it before, but she now wore a toolbelt with some rather concerning implements. “Mr Brooks, you may want to avert your gaze for a few minutes.” The doctor informed, as she brought a gnarled and rusted saw close to my corpse. 

“Whoa whoa whoa!” I blurted, throwing my hands up to stop her. “Can't we just, I dunno, throw it in my trunk or something?” The doctor cocked her head, expression screaming ‘are you kidding.’ Then she asked “Are you kidding me?” Oh, she said it. “And what would you do with yourself, then?” Doctor Wisconsin pressed. “Hell if I know, but I don't know how to feel about you carving up my body. Not to mention, where the hell did this stuff come from?!” A wave of terror struck as I realized how uncomfortably casual Dr Wisconsin was holding those dangerous instruments. “Building is an old converted crematorium. Kept one of the furnaces, never know when it would come in handy. They said I was overthinking things by keeping it, but look at me now!” The doctor puffed up her chest. It was my turn to flutter my eyelashes. “Could I just, um, help you throw my body in, and skip the whole saws and everything?” I pleaded. Dr Wisconsin sighed, then nodded. “Fine, but I'm not happy about it.”

We loaded the other me into the old oven, then returned to the room. She was taking this a bit too well. “So Doc, um. What do you make of this?” I asked, as she was composing herself back in her throne of a corner seat. “Beats me,” she shrugged, averting my gaze. “Just a thing that happens, I guess.” That was entirely unhelpful. “I can't exactly go back to my day to day while this is going on, now, can I?” My voice ticked up an octave, a spark of anger igniting. Her nonchalance had been reassuring. Now it was beginning to be mildly infuriating. “Look, of all my patients, I have never experienced-” she started, only for me to sneeze. The world shifted slightly to the side, as the sensation of the sneeze immediately vanished. “I have never witnessed such an unusual affliction… as that,” she concluded, gesturing to the new body, now slumped on the other side of me. “I can't even sneeze?!” I blurted, throwing my hands up. My right hand collided with the standing lamp, a twang of pain flashing up my arm. Again, the world shifted to the side as *another* corpse slumped over. I facepalmed. “This is ridiculous,” I summarized, helping Dr Wisconsin to her feet as we began to wheel the bodies one by one, to the old crematorium. 

On our way back to the room, Dr Wisconsin entered a side door, labeled “FRONT DESK” before resuming her stride to the office. “I just cleared the rest of my day. Let's sort this out.” She locked the door behind her in a somewhat ominous move, causing a pit to form in my stomach. “You're scaring me a bit, Doc,” I chuckled, dryly, taking a step back from her. The devious, thin smile that had infected her lips did not waver. “Relax! You'll be fine. Probably,” she said the last part quietly. I gulped.

We spent the next few hours experimenting, much to my chagrin. She was surprisingly strong, plus my newfound fragility did not make escape easy. Something as small as a flick or paper cut was enough to drop me. Just plucking a nose hair or eyebrow hair was enough to drop me. While it was a very fruitful few hours, the growing pile of bodies was increasingly disturbing. Even more disturbing, the lack of disgust and genuine fascination the doctor expressed as I died over and over. The macabre tests concluded when I mentioned how we'd need to make half a dozen or more round trips to the crematorium, before we could head home. The laborious task ahead slapped the intrigue off of the doctor's face, replaced by dread at the physical exhaustion we would soon face. Another hour later, and the crematorium saw more use than it had in the better part of the past decade. It probably wasn't a good idea to toss twenty bodies in, at once, but hey, it wasn't my call. Dr Wisconsin seemed all too eager to risk burning down the building, just to expedite the process. She scrawled something down, then handed it to me. “Follow up with these specialists. They know how to keep things discreet.”
