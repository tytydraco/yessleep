Have you ever wondered what happens to us after we leave this world? Do you believe in heaven or something beyond our world? And most importantly, do you think youâ€™ll go to heaven? I had an experience a while back that made me question these things, so listen up...

You see, it all started when I lost my dear friend, Alex, in a car accident. He was a great guy; the best friend a guy could ask for. So, the pain of his sudden departure was unbearable, and I found some comfort in sharing my grief with our mutual friend, Mike. We were mourning together, trying to cope with the void left behind by our friend.

But one evening, as we sat in my living room, something inexplicable happened. The door creaked open, and there stood Alex. Not a transparent ghost. Not a floating spirit. Just Alex, like we had always known him. He was smiling and waving at us, as if to say, "Hey, I'm still here." Then, just as suddenly as he appeared, he peacefully faded away into thin air.

I was shocked, but I found comfort in the fact that I was able to see my friend one last time. A bittersweet smile crossed my face, and I turned to Mike to share this experience. But my smile vanished when I saw the look on Mike's face.

He was pale and almost cold with sweat, his eyes wide with shock. I couldn't understand why; after all, we'd both just witnessed the same event. But as I asked what was wrong, Mike began to recount a different version of the encounter.

"He looked so normal at first," Mike said, his eyes fixed on some distant, haunting memory. "But then his smile twisted into an expression of sheer terror, and his eyes... oh god, his eyes seemed to plead for help."

I listened in horror as Mike described how Alex's hands started to claw at his throat, drawing blood. He said it was like watching a wicked dance of pain and desperation.

"And then... from the dark hallway," Mike's voice shook, "burnt and charred hands emerged, long and skeletal. They reached out for him, like they were pulling him towards some dreadful abyss."

"Alex's face... contorted in agony, like he was being dragged back into the darkness, fighting against some higher force. And the sound he made, it was gut-wrenching, like a tortured cry that echoed through the very depths of my soul."

By this point, Mike's voice was barely audible, but it held the weight of the unknown. His words hung in the air like a haunting echo, leaving both of us with a lingering sense of dread and uncertainty.

I was already feeling kinda nauseous at this point, but what Mike said next was really the nail in the coffin. 

Mike paused for a moment, like he was trying to find the right words to convey his thoughts.

"Look, I know he was a great guy, but... it didn't look like Alex made it to heaven."
