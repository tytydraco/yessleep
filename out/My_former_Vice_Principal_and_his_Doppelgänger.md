Back in 2015, I spent my summer at a christian summer camp. It wasn’t really a christian camp more or less just a regular summer camp but with an hour of church service by a campfire every morning and the rest of the day spent doing actual summer camp things.

I mention this because during my summer there I met a kid, we’ll call him “Allen.” 

Allen was a pure athlete, dominated in all sports activities at the camp. He was a 6’2 11 year old at the time I met him. He played AAU basketball and soccer and went to a private K-12 christian academy about a 2 hour drive across the state from where the camp was. 

I was 12 years old when I met Allen and we are still friends to this day. I’m 19 and he’s 18 in his last year of highschool. 

Around the time I was 13, I had to start picking between High Schools as my state has many different options for high schools you can attend. I was leaning down to 2 options. A tech school where I could go and learn my biggest hobby, computers, in more depth. Or I could go to a smaller public/private school where only a certain handful of students get in each year and have to be selected on a lottery.

I was leaning towards the tech school but decided to put my name in the lottery for the other school to see if I get in or not.

Around June of 2017, I get a call from the Public/Private school. I got in. But they need to hear back within 2 weeks or my spot gets given to someone else. The man introduced himself as “Mike.” The Vice Principal. 

A week later after pressure from my mom, I accepted the offer. 

I setup an interview with “Mike.” 

Fast forward a few years to my Junior Year, The Covid-19 Pandemic hit. I’m sure you know the full story about what happened that faithful March day in 2020. But I’ll save that story for now.

Basically during the rest of that year, all of the teachers basically gave free passes to everyone for obvious reasons, as most students didn’t even show up to the zoom meetings.

On One of the last Full School Zoom meetings  of the Year, Both Mike and the Principal “Mary” announced they were both leaving. Mike stated it was due to a career change. Keep that in mind for later.

I was devastated. Mike was one of the few administrators there that treated me like I was human. I wanted to keep in touch with him as best I could, but unfortunately Mike basically disappeared from everyone he knew at the school. 

It’s now December 2020. I was depressed. I was angry. I felt like the rest of my Childhood was thrown away in an instant.

I decided to reactivate my old snapchat account to see if anyone was still on there. I posted a photo. It was Mikes Yearbook Photo. The Caption “I miss you man, why did you leave.” 

About an hour later. My snapchat notifications went off. It was Allen. He said, “Dude, no fucking way.” I was confused, so I wrote back “Huh?” Allen: “Dude that’s my new principal. Mike (Lastname), right?” 

I was shocked. I hadn’t seen Allen since 2018 and talked to him since early 2020. And now he was claiming my former Vice Principal was his Principal. I sarcastically called “Bullshit” and asked Allen to send proof. Allen said he would at lunch/prayer time, as that’s when Mike or the principal addresses the school. 

About 2 hours later, as i’m about to drive home. A snapchat notification appeared again. It was a timed photo, but I could save it. It was a picture, It was him and Allen throwing piece signs. I quickly saved it. 

I then posted the conversation and the photo to the schools snapchat story. And it blew up. People were going crazy over this utterly bizarre coincidence. But it only got more bizarre from there.

Around March time, Majority of the students who did zoom meetings were forced to come back to school or lose their spot in the school. When I returned people were asking me how I knew Allen. I kind of became an overnight sensation at my school. I explained everything and how crazy this whole thing was. But oh boy were we all in for a shock. 

A couple days after everyone came back. We were all sitting in the lunchroom when all of a sudden, Mike came into the lunch room. Or so we thought. The man had an uncanny resemblance, wore the same clothes as him and looked exactly the same facially. I dipped out of the lunch room to call Allen to see if he knew anything about why Mike was back at my school. 

Allen facetimed me almost immediately. “Bro, what are you talking about?” Me: “Mike, your principal formerly my principal, is back at my school.” I then pointed the camera at the guy. Allen then proceeds to point his camera. 

It was Mike. Standing on the stage. Giving his daily lecture at Allen’s school. 

Allen thought I was bullshitting him. And so for proof I asked one of my friends sitting in the lunch room to send me a video of the guy. He was talking to the students. But didn’t seem to understand why everyone thought he was “Mike.” His name was (Terry Lastname). 

The man then proceeded to buy his food at the cafeteria and got in his car and was out of there faster than you could imagine. I assumed the underclassmen harassed him beyond belief because most of them were assholes. 

Majority of those videos ended up on the schools Snapchat Story. With all the evidence pointing to a possible Doppelgänger. 

And we never saw that Doppelgänger again after that but I later found out that the Doppelgänger was a Part-time traveling College Math Professor. And that he worked in numerous schools and colleges around the Region. 

This event still perplexes me and haunts me to this day. Wondering if it’s possible anyone could have an exact lookalike out there in the wild. We’ve seen it so many times shown on the internet. with people posting photos of them running into their “Long Lost Twin.” Or someone who looks exactly like them. 

I still talk to Allen, and every now and again he sends a selfie of Him and Mike to prove I’m not crazy. Allen is an amazing friend tbh. 

This very event lives in my head, even as a 19 year old.
