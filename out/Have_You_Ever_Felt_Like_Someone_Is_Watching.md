Before this story begins, I want to say; if you feel like someone is watching you but you can’t be sure who they are or even if they are real, they are and they are watching. Waiting. Wanting.

 

I want to start this off by saying that my therapist says that this was all in my head, but I don’t believe him. He said that I was hurting myself, he said that they weren’t real. He said everything they made him say. My whole life I’ve always felt like there has been something or someone watching me. It’s always been present.

 

I was homeschooled but all my friends went to public school. All the boys in my neighborhood would come hang out together in the woods behind Mr. Buchman’s house. He was a veteran who fought in Vietnam and all of us boys would joke that he was the real-life Rambo. He owned about ten acres of wood, and he didn’t mind us boys playing in all of it. We would play tree tag and superheroes during the day and try to scare each other at night. We usually stayed close to tree line as to not get lost.

 

There was Five of us that usually hung out: Tommy Harbinger, Billy Legions, Bradly Russo, Martin Russo, and me Jacob Barnes.

 

Tommy was short with green eyes and ginger hair. He cared way too much about fashion for a pre-teen. He only wore Nike. He would always get white air forces and keep them as clean as the day they were made.

 

Billy was even shorter with blue eyes and Black hair. He looked like he was straight out of Toy Story with his all-black clothes and skull shirt. I don’t think he ever washed his clothes or took a shower. He smelled like he used dead animals as deodorant.

 

Bradly and Martin looked identical. They both had grey eyes and would not stop reminding us how rare that was. They both had blonde hair that was buzzed, from a distance it looked like they were bald. They were both taller than the rest of us, a fact they would not let you forget, and they thought they were way more country than they really were. They always had on the same matching pair of overalls and cowboy boots, which didn’t even look remotely good together. They both grew up to become ranchers. They cheated on their wives with each other’s wives and Martin got killed in a tractor accident a few years ago.

 

I don’t remember exactly how old I was when Mr. Buchman died, I couldn’t have been older than eleven or twelve. After his death we almost always played at the Russo house. They had a bigger house and were the only brothers in the group. Our thought was that since the two of them lived together it was fairer to hang out at their house, and their mom was hot.

 

Bradly and Martin were always the easiest to scare, but when we moved to their house, they became the hardest. I guess the comfort of the familiar made them braver. Once they realized that we couldn’t scare them anymore, they became unbearable. They would constantly ruin our scares when they weren’t involved. They would always turn on the lights in the hall, which was against the rules. Worst of all they would not shut up about how not scared they were.

 

On some week in November, the Russo twins got sick. Tommy Harbinger and Billy Legions joked that they got sick at the same time because they bathed together, but that was never confirmed. We all got together to plan how we could scare them when they got better.

 

“They were always scared at Mr. Buchman’s woods” Billy said with an inhuman grin on his face.

 

“Why are you smiling like that Billy?” I asked wondering how his mouth moved like that.

 

Billy was sitting across from me on the floor of his dad’s living room. His brown eyes glaring into my soul. He leaned forward looking like he was going to pounce at any moment, drool forming on his lower lip, dripping onto the floor. I could hear every noise in that house, the ticking of his clock, the spinning of his washing machine, the wind pressing its voluptuous body against his house. It felt as if everything that had ever scared me was about to get me in that moment. Like the person watching had found their moment.

 

“Hahahahahahahahaha!” He and Tommy both blared out laughing, “You shoulda hehehe seen the loo-hehehe- the look on your face hehe!” both trying as hard as they could to control their laughter.

 

Utterly embarrassed, I stood up spun around twice and slapped myself on the back of the neck, a loser’s penance. “We should tell them Rambo’s house is haunted.”

 

They both stopped laughing. They looked at me with a zeal in their eyes I had never seen. It was like I was Daniel, and they were Nebuchadnezzar waiting for my next words.

 

“Then we could lead them there for some mind of test of might,” I said, “We could set up all kinds of scares ahead of time.”

 

“But what if someone finds us and we go to jail?” asked Tommy. He looked scared. I could always tell when he was scared because his left eye would close to the point where you could only see the very bottom of his green eyes. He was the sensible one of the group, I think he’s an accountant now.

 

“Then we can do a séance or something.” Blurted Billy as if not listening to word Tommy said, “We could set up a projector and ask Mr. Buchman to talk to us.”

 

“Do any of us own a projector?” I asked, excited for this awesome plan.

 

The other two shook their heads solemnly.

 

“I guess I got too ahead of myself.” Said Billy with a disappointed look in his beautiful blue eyes.

 

“I have a Bluetooth speaker we could use instead!” Tommy said obviously wondering why I was staring at Billy for so long.

 

We set up the late Mr. Buchman’s house with speakers and lights, I think this is when I decided that I wanted to be an electrician. We bought fake spiderwebs for a discount price from the spirit Halloween that was closing for the year. It took both Billy and Tommy’s allowances to cover the cost of every fake spiderweb we needed. I spent all my money on the cheapest candles we could find.

 

Bradly and Martin had some apprehensions about going to a potentially haunted house but once we made chicken noises for four minutes they decided to come. While riding our bikes to Mr. Buchman’s house I got the feeling that was so familiar to me. Someone was watching me, I knew it. I couldn’t say anything to the other boys, they would just make fun of me. I had this feeling all the time, but this was different, it was like they were right behind me. I looked back to see only pitch black with the occasional streetlamp.

 

“I changed my mind!” Bradly said shivering in the cold street. He was standing under the only streetlight for nearly 100 feet. The only thing visible was him and his bike. “I don’t want to go anymore.”.

 

A voice I couldn’t recognize called out from the distance not to stop. It was faint and I’m not certain that I didn’t hallucinate. Just thinking about that voice gives me chills writing this.

 

“Oh! What’s this? The big bad Bradly is too sc..sc..sc…scared!” Billy yelled obviously trying to provoke Bradly’s pride.

 

“I’m not scared! Its…its just cold!” Bradly retorted, clearly lying.

 

“Okay, we’ll just leave you here then!” responded Billy.

 

Bradly got back on his bike and followed us to the house. With every light we passed the feeling of being watched grew stronger. I was still shaken up about the voice, but I couldn’t say anything.

 

“They were probably just messing with me.” I whispered to myself, really trying to convince myself.

 

When we arrived at Rambo’s house it looked different. The door had strange markings on it, it was hard to make out but looked like a roaring lion. I thought that it was a bit odd for that to be there since it wasn’t there the last time.

 

“When did you guys come back?” I asked Billy quietly so as not to alert the twins.

 

“We didn’t.” He responded

 

The moment we stepped in I knew something was wrong. On all the walls was a faintly carved eye. Everywhere I could see there was an eye carved into the wall.

 

It was me and Tommy in front, Bradley and Martin in the middle, and Billy holding the rear. “Did you carve those eyes into the wall?” I asked Tommy in a whisper.

 

“What eyes?” He responded.

 

I knew I wasn’t in on all the scares anymore. We pressed forward to his living room where there was a fake goat head surrounded by fake blood. I thought this was another scare Billy and Tommy had added but they all screamed. Even the Billy and Tommy. If I had known what I know now I would have turned around and walked out of that house as fast as I could.

 

I don’t know what possessed us to press on into the next room, but Billy insisted that we see what was in there. When we entered there was a figurine of some kind hanging from the ceiling. It looked like a rabbit of some kind. It was covered in a red liquid that I can only assume was blood. The red liquid dripped onto the floor pooling up into an oblong round puddle. The rabbit had horns on one side of its head and antlers on the other. it looked like the head attire had just grown out of its head. They were probably the source of the blood. There was too much blood on the floor for that small rabbit to be the source.

 

When the time came for our curfew, we went home. My parents thought I was at the twin’s house like every other night. I went to my room and laid in bed staring at the dark ceiling. In all my memories of lying there I remember a faint eye on my ceiling. At that time, I didn’t see it, but the feeling of being watched had never been stronger.

 

We didn’t try to scare each other after that, and no one would confess to all that weird stuff. I blamed Tommy.
