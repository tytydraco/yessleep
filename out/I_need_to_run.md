I had no idea how I got there, so I started to look around. To my right was a dense forest that seemed to stretch forever. It was so thick that venturing inside seemed impossible. In front of me lay a normal asphalt road, its end nowhere in sight. The sun shone brightly, though parts of the road were shaded by the forest's shadows. On my left was an endless plain of yellow-green grass. There were no buildings in sight, aside for a couple far down the road.  

My only option seemed to be walking forward, hoping the homes I saw might provide help. For the first time, walking felt refreshing. I could feel the warmth of the sun on my face, balanced by a cool breeze that kept me comfortable. It was truly beautiful.  

Then, I heard something behind me—a rustle of leaves and soft footsteps heading in my direction. The sound was slow, accompanied by the faint tapping of claws on the asphalt. My heart raced. I had always been paranoid around animals, especially dogs. Turning around, I saw it was a fox. It walked calmly, keeping its distance.  

Relieved, I turned back and continued forward. But just as I did, the tapping sound grew louder and faster. Turning again, I saw the fox running toward me. It seemed larger and angrier. Fear surged through me, and I ran as fast as I could. Adrenaline coursed through my veins as I heard the tapping grow heavier.  

When I glanced back, the fox was no longer ordinary. It had transformed—its body now muscular, its front legs longer, its jaw elongated, with red eyes and foam dripping from its mouth. It was monstrous. Desperation fueled me as I noticed a peculiar phenomenon: my speed increased in the shadows, and the run felt light but slowed in the sunlight. Running in the light felt like moving through water, sluggish, and exhausting.  

Despite my fear, I pushed forward, navigating between shadow and light. The beast gained on me, its rage palpable. Hours passed, or so it seemed, yet the road stretched endlessly ahead. I was on autopilot, my mind shutting down from the monotonny of the run. 

Eventually, my focus returned. The light now dominated the road, and I realized with horror that I was running in a loop, like a hamster in a wheel. The road spiralled upward, leaving little shadow for respite.  

Realizing my doom, I wanted to stop. Why keep running when there was no escape? But my body refused to obey. I was no longer in control—just a spectator to my own demise. The beast closed in, its breath hot on my neck, its massive shadow looming over me.  

When its head towered above, its burning saliva scorched my skin. Its bottom jaw pressed against my back, teeth digging in. The beast lifted me from the road and bit into my legs. Pain shot through me as my shins shattered. I braced for death, but it did not come quickly.  

My body suddenly screamed in agony, exhaustion wracking my chest as my heart raced. Blood filled my mouth, and my muscles burned. The beast’s tongue shifted me under its teeth, and I felt its jaws prepare for one final bite.  

There were no flashbacks, no moments of clarity—just relief as the fear and pain finally ended. My life was ended in the jaws of the fox.
