My dad had recently lost his job and moved us across state to his childhood town. It was small farming town, not really ideal for anyone wanting to do anything with their life but we were in a tough spot. My dad claimed he wanted to move back to see his parents more but we werent close to them. I knew that it was because housing was so cheap in the area and it made sense why. Everything was so behind in the times. Easily dating back at least 10 years. 

My sister and I were both in middle school. So you could imagine the transition of changing schools halfway through the year. We were 2 years apart grade wise but 3 years apart in reality. My little sister was very smart for her age which made things interesting considering that I had to watch after her. Ever since the accident, I had to take on the role of our mother which is something no 14 year old should have to do. 

I dont know what exactly happened and dad doesnt like to talk about it but I pieced enough of it together that our mothers passing was a violent one. I was so young when it happened that it almost feels like a memory that doesnt belong to me. Something merely implanted from someone elses experience. The one thing that got me through such a tough time were my friends and seeing how I had to leave them, I felt as if I was leaving apart of myself. Leaving the safe and familiar harbor for more treacherous seas. 

The living room was still full of boxes as Sandra and I got ready for school. Our outfits were so mismatched as we tried our luck opening unmarked moving boxes to hopefully find something remotely suitable to wear. 

“Alright guys, let's pick something quick. I need to take you guys to school and I am already late for work.” My dad said defeatedly. Sandra shot me a look before diving back in to retrieve an outfit. What I had on wasnt exactly fashionable but it would do. Despite all the chaos my life had given me so far, there was one thing I did have to look forward to. I try to be optimistic with most things and I saw this new chapter in my life as a fresh start. A clean slate, that hopefully I could try my luck at being popular here. I wasnt popular at my old school but I think I could be if I had the right start here. 

Sandra and I hopped in the car and dad routed us to school. As we pulled up to the location routed on my dads phone he was surprise that the town had a new middle school. One different than the one he went to as a child. “Huh”, he said. Looks like they got rid of O P Evans.” The school was rather nice despite the clear setback that the town had on it. The two store building stood out amidst the old buildings that were in the near area. 

“Man, its probably a good thing they got rid of that school. That place was old even when I went there. I could see a look on my dads face as he reminisced of old memories. A slight smile began to crawl across his face….”Aww man thats right!” He whispered to himself. “You ok dad?” Sandra said front eh back seat. “Yeah yeah… Im good. You guys hop on out and Ill tell you a good scary story when you get home tonight.” We jumped out of the car and waved as he took off out of the parking lot. The small crowd of kids funneled their way inside as they were being guided by teachers and we went to class. 

As I walked the halls of school. I couldnt help but think what my dad was smiling about. What could his scary story possibly be?  

It didnt take long for me to forget the morning as I was doing my best to try to make new friends at school. I wasnt having much luck considering I was probably trying too hard. I did however eventually make a small group of friends in one of my drama classes. They were not popular but we had enough in common that I was able to make it work. 

It wasnt the outcome I was looking for but I was just happy to have made a small group of friends. They were al nice although some of them were kinda weird but that was fine. I took that win for the day as a smile plastered across my face. The rest of the day after that seemed to fly by. 

School eventually ended and I met Sandra outside of the school as we waited for dad. “Hey Sandy”, I said. “How was your day?” I asked as a smile still lingered on my face. “Pretty good all around. All my classes have good teaches.” She said while nodding. “Did you make any friends, meet any cute boys?” I egged her on. She brushed briefly “uhhh no… not yet”. Sandra was as smart as she was shy. We got along pretty well and she would oftentimes just join my group of friends by association, which I didnt really mind. Normally, something like that would have probably bothered me but ever since my mom died, I made sure she was included with things. 

Dad eventually pulled up, clearly tired from work. He faked a smile as we hopped in the car. “Hey Girls, how was school?” It was good, how was work… I replied.. “Work is work” he said while chuckling. He always said that which made himself laugh which I found amusing. 

We pulled out of the parking lot and started driving home when Sandra piped up from the back seat. “Dad, tell us that scary story you mentioned this morning.” My dad shot me a look and that mischievous grin returned… “Oh… Do I have a scary story for you.” He said in an eerie voice. “Wait… let me see if I can find the place first.” My dad then drove through town peering down old streets as if he was looking for something. As we drove he told us this story about his old school he used to attend. How the school O P Evans used to be a prison before being turned into a school. He took us down a couple of back roads, kinda tucked away from the already slow backstreets that the town seemed to have an endless amount of. Sure enough we eventually found it. An old building about maybe three to four stories high. A tall chain linked fence surrounded the once school. Razor wire was tangled in a mess above the fence, making sure no one was getting in by climbing over it. But ironically, the front gate to the school had since been rusted and withered and now sat askew, leaving large gaps near the gates frame that one could easily crawl through. 

“Aww yea… there it is. So the story about this school is that it used to be a prison. Certain sections of the building were closed off as they were no longer needed or too dangerous to have kids around. They took out most of the cells obviously but they left a few that were built into the actual building. Anyways, so what we would do when we were younger was that we would sneak in here after soccer practice and try to explore certain sections that were forbidden. The staff would make up rumors like ghosts haunted the sealed off sections or that some terrible monster would grab you. Once time a buddy of mine, Mike snuck into to the basement. Now the basement didnt have any cells but it had old piping and areas unknown to even the staff. Now he swears he swears he saw something down there that changed him. He use to be fun loving and a rambunctious child but after that event he always seemed on edge. 

Sandra and I looked at the old school with mixed emotions of bewilderment and awe. The schools appearance alone looked terrifying. If I didnt know better, this was clearly a place that housed some forbidden terror. Tormented spirits or other creatures of the night certainly dwelt here. We sat parked for a couple of minutes as my dad looked at the building that certainly housed many memories for him. 

We all eventually came back to reality and drove back home to our sad lives. Today was a disappointment in someway but also successful in others. I wasnt with the Popular group but I did make some friends. It was also good to see my dad no longer his sad miserable self but able to see a brief glimpse into the inner child that he once was. 

Not much changed after that day. Despite my best efforts, dad continued to just get by, my attempts to be popular never resulted in anything meaningful and the sad state of the town slowly began to drag us down with it. I got by in school but it was difficult. My new friends were the only thing that seemed to keep my head above water. My friends and Sandra that is. 

The five of us eventually became pretty close. Rebecca,Stacy and Jared slowly became a common sight around my house. They were quirky but polite which my dad seemed to enjoy. I think he was just happy that Sandra and I had something to look forward to. Since the town was so small, we had to come up with new ways to entertain ourselves. Video games were a go to but it was hard since there were five of us and only 4 controllers. What we normally would like to do would be to go to the small playground and try to “Parkour”but None of us were any good. But that was the fun thing about our group. We alway found a way to make something out of nothing.  

Oddly enough, the small town had a rather large cemetery. If we were feeling up to it we would play ghosts in the graveyard at night however we eventually got caught by the police. Which we werent allowed back. 

One day after school we sat in the drama room discussing what we should do tonight. It had been awhile since we played ghosts in the graveyard but we were all dying to play. We tried playing a few rounds in our new school but the few staff that had stayed late that day got mad at us. We sat there discussing other places to play when an idea popped into my head. “I think I know where we can play but …..” The group looked at me as I paused. “ … But the place is a bit creepy.” My warning was anything but. Everyone aside from Sandra began to smile. “But whats this place you're thinking of. Theres nothing in town we hadnt tried.” Before I could respond Sandra piped up. “Shes thinking of the old school” All of them were confused. “What old school? Jared replied. For some reason no one what we were talking about. It was as if this town had swept this creepy building under the rug and away from public eyes. “Yea, there's this place tucked away that my dad used to go to school here. Its in town but its kinda far if we are walking. “I mean, what else are we gonna do?” Jared said. We all agreed to meet at my house after we all went home and to grab a couple things that we thought we might need. Sandra and I walked home and dad wasnt there yet. I could feel the slight sensation of dread build in my stomach as I didnt want to go inside of that place but I was the one to suggest it. Plus, I didnt want to look lame in front of my friends or even Sandra. About an hour passed and the group showed up at our house. Stacy and Rebecca both had backpacks of items as well as flashlights and Jared had a head lamp and a samurai sword. “Really bro?” I said and I let him in the house.    

Jared convinced him mom to let him take his car for the night. We all piled in and took off down the back streets while Sandra and I tried our best to remember where the school was. Time was not on our side as the sun had set and it was getting dark. This made recongizing the half dozen back streets all the more difficult. Unfortunately, Sandra had a photographic memory or at least so she claimed. She was successful in guiding us to the old school, further validating her memory claim. Jared dropped us off as he went to park the car off a ways on the off chance that someone would come out here and see it parked. 

The four of us waited as Jared returned. The school stood more ominous than what I remembered. The night definitely didnt help ease my nerves in any way. The gate was still lopsided, leaving the gaps for us to crawl through. We all squeezed through one by one and began circling around to find a way inside. As we expected, most entrances were either boarded up or locked. Now remembering it was once a prison, I should have expected it to be difficult to break into. 

Our flashlight scanned the building, looking for any possible opening or even a clue to allow us access inside. The dark overgrowth of the trees and brush gave off muffled sounds of nightlife, slightly easing the already building tension. We walked around back and checked all the doors. They all appeared to be secure. Out of frustration, Jared swung his sword at one of the boards that covered a door which got stuck in the soft decayed woods. We all looked at each other with light bulbs going off in our brains. Although the sword was fairly low quality, he was able to cut just enough that we were able to get our hands in and pull chucks on board off the doorway. In a matter of five minutes, we had produced a big enough hole that we could squeeze through. We had Jared lead the way as he stepped inside the dark school. We then handed him our bags as we all slipped in one by one.  

Inside the faint smell of mold and a mystery odor slowly came to our nostrils. We shined out light inside and sure enough, the old building had the appearance of a dated school. Rooms without doors held old desks that sat in disarray as it was clear we were not the first ones to find this abandoned school. Old tile lined the floors and bare walls sat silently holding in the many secrets it had seen over the years. The idea to play ghost in the graveyard had been put on hold as the amazement of investigating such a peculiar place had slowly became our objective. 

That is until Stacy spoke up. “Wait!” She whispered. “We shouldnt investigate first. We should just play. That way it will be extra hard to find each other. The group agreed.

Rebecca picked a number and we all had to guess. Sandra was the closest thus making her the ghost for the first round. Sandra ran off into the dark school as we all counted before going to look for her. When we reached the allotted amount of time we all went our separate ways to search for her. Sandra was the unspoken champion at this game. The one time we got caught in the cemetery, she had hid so well that the police werent able to find her. 

We decided to split up. Stacey and Jared went one direction and Rebecca and I went the other. We found a set of stairs that led to the second story which we hesitantly went up. The stairs were towards the front of the building. None of the higher up windows were boarded up considering no one could reach them from the outside. It was more of the same on the second floor. Some garbage laid on the ground and occasional teaching materials were seen here and there. For the most part, the school was pretty clean. It was clear that not many people had been here since its closure. We checked each class room which yielded no results. The building had a U shape which we followed. Our flashlights were the only sources of light in this building and it was incredibly dark. There were street lights on the road nor anything outside the school that still worked. The moon wasnt out tonight, making our game especially dark. We spent a good twenty minutes on the second floor inspecting each room for Sandra while also scoping out a good spot to hide when it was our turn. 

The shadows casted by our flashlights were ghastly. Every now and then they would cast what looked like an outline of some shadow person before my eyes were able to make sense of what I was looking at. We had reached the end of the Second floor. When lights from outside shined in. My heart dropped as we ran to the window to see an old truck pull up to the rusted gate out front. 

An old farmer type got out and unlocked the gate before pulling into the courtyard. The truck was an older model and was pretty loud. Rebecca an I gasped as we were unsure as to why this man had pulled in. Was he security? Did he now own the property? More importantly, did he know we were in here? 

I wanted to sprint down the stairs and try to warn the others but I had no idea where they were. I couldnt yell because it would alert the man to us inside. All we could do was watched as he parked near the front of the school. He got out again and unlocked the front door of the school and went to the back end of his truck, all the while leaving his truck running. The head lights gave just enough light that we could see what looked like a tarp covering something in is truck bed. The man came to the front of the truck carrying what looked like a rolled up rug and brought it inside. We sat by the window and listened to see if he was coming up the stairs. We watched as he exited the school and go back to the truck bed. This time instead of a rug he tried to carry what looked like something heavy wrapped in a bloodied bedsheet. The man struggled to lift it and set it on the ground and dragged it inside, leaving a bloody trail behind him. 

Oh my God, Rebecca whispered. Our fears of being caught had been replace but something more sinister. It was clear we were not only somewhere we shouldnt be but we just saw something way worse. 

My anxiety began to fill my body as my hands began to shake. I could hear Rebecca starting to cry softly as the realization began to set in. We sat in darkness, praying that the man would emerge from the school and leave. We could briefly hear the man on the main floor make his way around the school before eventually exiting again, locking the door and left the parking lot. 

It appeared that none of us were detected by the man. Once he locked up the front gate and headed back down the dirt road, Rebecca and I took off to the main floor. We quietly called out to find our group when we spotted the blood trail on the tile floor. 

All suspicions had been confirmed. Dark red streaks led inside to an unknown location in the school. It didnt take us long to find Stacy and Jared. They looked equally as terrified as we did. 

“Did you guys see that guy? He was dragging something heavy and dumped it somewhere.” Stacey said as she got close to jared. Jared looked around frantically, clearly scared out of his mind. “We just need to leave, we saw too much. The less we know the better” “Dont you want to see what he dragged in here?” Rebecca whispered. “Absolutely not” I said. 

“Lets just find Sandra and get out of here” The other two looked at me nervously. “You didnt find her yet?” “Shes not with us, what do you think” I said sarcastically. 

“Im not going to wait to find your sister to get out of here. I just need to leave.” Jared said. I shot him a look of surprise and anger. “Really, youre gonna leave my baby sister here by herself. She doesnt know what just happened. We have to find her.” Jared didnt say anything and tossed his sword on the ground. “Bring it back to me when youre done.” I gritted my teeth. “Youre a coward” I hissed as I picked up the sword. 

Stacy and Rebecca looked at me with sad faces. “You not going to make us stay are you?” Stacy whimpered. “We’ll be right outside!” Rebecca replied. 

“Dont even bother waiting.” I said as I took off down the hall, leaving Stacy and Rebecca behind. Frustration had replaced my once overwhelming terror. I gripped the sword tightly as I shined my light in hopes of seeing sandra. I tried calling out to her but in past games we would trick the ghost and say that the game was over in order to get them to come out. She wasnt going to believe me. I was going to have to find her. 

I shined my light on the main floor in hopes of find my sister but I saw no sign of her. Just the occasional desk or the recent streak of red on the tile. I had wished at least one of the girls had stayed with me but I took off before I could convince them to help. I searched most of the first floor to find myself following the blood trail. It was unlikely it led to Sandra but it was the one of the few places I had yet to look. Oddly enough the trail led to the middle of a hallway and instead of seeing the bloody sheets and rug, I saw something more surprising. The trail led to a large hole in the floor. “The basement” I whispered. I shined my light down the dark hole in hopes of seeing anything but my light didnt reach that far. 

I stepped back, frustrated at the position I was in. “You would hide down there” I said while hitting the sword hard on the wooden floor. I could hear shuffling down below and I stepped up to the hole again. “Sandra?” I called out. The shuffling got closer. I remembered my dads story about the basement. How, even when he was a kid, the basement was forbidden even for the staff. How my dads friend had seen something down there that left him scarred. 

I could feel the anger slowly fade as fear replaced it. I couldnt see anything in the dark pit but I felt a sensation of dread wash over me. As if the darkness had unseen eyes peering up at me.

No matter my fear, I wasnt going to leave my sister. One of the only people to have been there for me through my darkest days. 

I turned back around and started looking for stairs. I checked each classroom but nothing. I then checked what I assumed to be the front office. I couldnt find any stairs on the main floor but I did find another hole in the floor, except this time it, laid next to a wall. I shined my light down below to see piping lining the wall leading down into the hole acting like a natural ladder. I couldnt carry both the sword and flashlight so I dropped the sword down in and started climbing into the hole. I reached the bottom and shined my light around. I wanted to call out but something about this basement made me want to be quiet. 

It appeared wherever I was, I was in some kind of hallway. I picked a random direction and hoped for the best. If Sandra wasnt down here then I had no idea where to find her. The concrete floor had dust on it which  finally dawned on me that it also had freshly made shoe prints of sandra. But as I looked at the floor I saw something unsettling. I saw what looked like footprints also. Large footprints. Whatever was down here with us was really big and wasnt wearing shoes. 

I stopped in my tracks and debated on turning off my light. I decided against it as I inched myself forward. 

By some miracle, I was finally able to hear soft sobbing coming from the far end of the hallway. Boxes and shelves lined the crypt like area and my light was able to catch the top part of Sandras head that was poking out. I quickly rushed over and felt a wave of relief embrace me as I saw Sandra sitting behind the box crying. 

Before I could say anything, Sandra whispered. “Its not her” Sandras face was red from intense crying. I was both horrified and confused. “Whats not her?” She tried to catch her breath as she sobbed. “Its… not… mom. It just looks like her.” My heart skipped a beat. I tried to rationalize what Sandra was saying. Had she been down here too long and was seeing things or was there actually someone else down here with us. 

“We’re gonna get you out of here, sweetie.” I said soothingly. I pulled her up and she could barely stand. She was shaking so much. “Here, you hold this” I said while putting the sword into her hand. “All we have to do it is follow our steps back to the hole and climb out. Itll be easy. 

Her crying seemed to intensify but she clutched the sword and I pulled her back to the hole I climbed through. We quickly made it back to the hole but a tall skinny figure stood in our way. Strains of hair covered it face but I could see red gums and yellowed teeth through it. 

“Im here now, dont you miss me?” The figure said. Whatever this …. Thing …. Was had immediately disturbed me greatly and at the same time, it sounded exactly like mom. I was too scared to move but I spoke. “What are you doing?”

“I missed you… I missed both of you. “ The thing stepped forward and I could see dark stains around its mouth and neck. The hole was right next to us. I grabbed the sword from Sandra and she started to frantically climb. I aimed the light at the creatures face and it lifted a gnarled hand to block the light. “I was hurt sooo bad…. But Im better now….. Do you want to see.” I glanced behind me and saw that sandra had cleared the hole, she waited at the top and shined the light down at me. 

I turned to the creature and noticed that even though it was crouched it was still taller than me. She began to speak but out of instinct I threw the sword at the creature and missed badly. I could briefly see a wide smile emerge as it stood upright, no longer needing to pretend now that I was disarmed. As a last ditched effort I hurled my light at the creatures head and miraculously it connected firmly. The light spun in all directions as it cracked the creatures head and I began my climb up. Frantic breathing and grunts erupted from the creature. I somehow emerged from the hole and Sandra pulled me to my feet. We sprinted out of the office area and back to the doorway we had entered from. We didnt glance back, not even once. Sandra and I emerged from the school and kept going till we made it out of the fence. 

Once we cleared the area we were able to calm down and take a breath. Sandra was still sobbing when she hugged me tightly and I fought back tears as we slowly walked home.
