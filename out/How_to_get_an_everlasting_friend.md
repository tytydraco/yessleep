*** stared at the screen of his computer, re-reading the email plastered on his screen as if somehow his eyes would show a different reality than the one placed in front of him. He stared. And stared. And stared a bit more. For what was on his screen, was more than a simple pop-up or a classmate of his sending a poorly written group project. I smiled.

No, it was none of those. It was *my* message. *My* confession. *My* cry. 
**My trap.**

*Ahem*. Is this recording? Ok.

You people always assume that making friends is challenging. No. It is far from so. The reason why everyone thinks that it is so troublesome to do, is because they go about doing it wrongly. 

You've seen it before. The amber alerts that flash bright white on your phone during the cold nights, releasing a cry of sound as information of the victim flashes on the screen. The high-pitched screaming of the alert tries so hard to mimick that of the victim. It's always off. The cries are always so much sweeter to hear in person. But the thing that people don't realize, is that *that* is *not* how you make friends. No, you need to be more proper.

Since people keep annoying me with how much you fail at using your brains and common sense, I will teach you how to properly go about making a friend.


**Firstly. It's not kidnapping. It's befriending. Pick your bird to hunt down.**

What? Are you one of those idiots who picks their little birds by the impulse of having a sweet treat to snack on? Wrong. You will be caught that way. Foxes don't pick the prettiest birds, but the fattest and juiciest. The ones that will provide them enough sustenance to survive until their next meal. People do not just disappear out of nowhere. No, no, no. You need to take your time. Be patient. Have fun. Why so nervous? This your first time? Hah. No matter. We all start somewhere, right?

I recommend picking those who live alone and don't have much social connections. They are easily told apart by the rest of society because they always have a look on their face as if they'd just seen their loved one get decimated in front of their face. 

Hm. Fun idea. Might save it for later.

Now, continuing. Despite your impulse to do so, don't pick someone rich. Neither famous. Neither social. Essentially, pick a social recluse. You probably are one too saying that you are reading this right now, but it's fine. I won't judge. In fact, maybe I'll pick you next. 

...

I am joking. 

So, after finding somebody you like-
*Oh, teacher! I have a question!*
Yes, little one?
*Can we kidnap them now?*
So long as you are ready for a court hearing the next week and the new prison diet you'll be sustaining.
*Oh*
Yes, now.

I will use my little bird as an example. His name is *****. You thought I'd reveal their name? You think too lowly of me. I'm hurt. 
*Oh, but Kidnap- teacher!*
Yes?
*You told us his gender!*
Yes. But you don't know if I am lying or not and a simple gender narrows it down to nothing.
Now, my little example will serve well in this lesson. 

He is a recluse. He works at a cornershop- night shift. After some digging into his community and gossip I found out a lot about him. He had a falling out with his family a few years back over a woman who eventually came to cheat on him anyways. Perfect. It is better to pick people with broken ties with their families so that there will be no suspicion when they don't get a call from their beloved child after 2 days.
Really, some parents can be overly obsessive to their children. And they say *I'm* the psychopath.

As I was saying, after you pick someone who will likely never be noticed if they do go missing- so people like you- befriend them.

*Kidnapper?*
**Teacher.**
*How do we befriend out victim?*
Don't call them victims first of all. Creep.
It is simple. Stalk them. Find out what they like, what they dislike, who/if they have any close friends, and then just randomly run into them on the streets or get the same job they have and tada! You've made a new friend! Congrats, it's probably your first.

*Kid-*
Teacher.
*What?*
Call me teacher.
*...teacher?*
Yes?
*Isn't this wrong?*
Is it?
*Yes, kidnapping somebody is wrong. Why would you pretend to be someone's friend and then trick them for your own pleasure?*
Hm. You have a moral conscience. Interesting. Get rid of it.
*But I am you-*
Get. Rid. Of. It. This is making a friend. 

This is not wrong. It's...it's just getting a new friend. They won't leave you if they *can't* leave you. They'll stay with you forever. I'll never let them go.

Becoming friends with your bird can happen through many different ways. If they have online games, you could pretend to meet them there and have the same interests, or you could attempt it in real life.
I won't assist you with this part, since it differs from person to person on how to be friends. 

Once you have become friends with this person, you earn their trust. This process may take months, but you have to be patient. 

Agree with whatever they rant about and take their side, comment on how amazing a friend they are, and one of the big ones.
Make them pity you.

Tell them a sob story, a tragic one. Or maybe a small one- like how nobody ever wanted to be your friend despite how hard you tried and they always used to throw water balloons filled with piss at you. Or something else. Whatever you'd like. 

By earning their sympathy, you ultimately gain a bit of their trust too. After all, nobody wants to believe that somebody who's gone through such a tragic life would succumb and turn into worse than the people who's harmed them.

I earned *****'s sympathy by telling him my story. My actual story. I don't know why I did. I just felt like I wanted to with him. It was a deep connection, which I felt could never be cut.

*It would've been had you not panicked and ruined it like you always do with everybody else.*

Once you have their sympathy, get them into hobbies with you. Convince them to do risky hobbies. If you have mountains near you, I'd recommend rock-climbing. That way, if both of you mysteriously disappear from the town, everybody will assume that it was a tragic accident in which a bear hunted you both down as dinner or you jumped off the edge of a cliff for some likes on Twitter.

Oh, yes, by the way, find an abandoned building or neighborhood, and began renovating it. Not in the "Oh, I'm going to install a bathroom and kitchen island" and whatever crap. But in the way that there are enough necessities for your bird to survive and no way for them to escape.

Now, continue with the hobby you have picked for them for around 3 to 4 months. That way they feel comfortable enough with you and the hobby.

That's when you strike.

*But you know, if you didn't do these things, your friends wouldn't leave you.*
No, they always leave.
*He decided to be your friend. Why would he leave?*
They all do.

Invite them out casually on another trip for your "hobby". A secluded area. Along with you, bring chloroform and a rag. Some handcuffs too and a knife. You can buy them off Amazon. You'll need it.

Park in a secluded area. If your bird asks you why you have, say that you don't want anybody vandalizing your car. Or truck. Or whatever. Make up an excuse.

When you are completely sure you're secluded, pretend to trip. Your friend will likely have a good laugh at you, then come to assist you up.

As they do, what you do is pull them down with you. They will laugh- they all do- as they will think it a small, harmless joke.
That's until you wrap your arm around their neck.

Listen closely, because this is a crucial part in your plan. 

The cartrotid arteries. 2 arteries located on either sides of the neck. By placing pressure on both of them for 8-10 seconds, you'll render your little bird unconscious for around 20-30 seconds. To do this, you can wrap your arm around the person's neck, placing them in a sort of chokehold, and apply around 5 kg of pressure on both sides of the neck.
They'll struggle, but in the end they'll be out cold in 10 seconds with the circulation to their brain being cut off.

Grab your handcuffs and then cuff their arms behind their backs. Don't cuff their feet, despite what you think. You won't need to. You're going to chop them off anyways so they can't run. Not now, of course, but soon.

As soon as you get the cuffs on- and you better work fast- grab your rag and chloroform. Don't drench it, or you'll kill your bird. Just a bit and then begin pressing it over their airways. They've probably awakened by this point and are frantically thrashing, but it matters not as at this point you will be threatening them with a knife to their neck.

Watch how quick they go still. Some might continue to struggle or even welcome the knife. Kill those people. They are not worth keeping in the end. Try again with someone new.

Unlike Hollywood movies where the rag is barely placed over the person's face for 10 seconds before they get knocked out, you actually need to keep the rag over their airways for 5-10 minutes to render them unconscious.

Once they are unconscious, you can begin your drag back to your vehicle. Place them in the trunk. Make sure that they can get enough oxygen though by making a small hole for them, and ensure that your vehicle does not have a open trunk in which your bird can manage to escape from. 

Remember that abandoned building I told you about earlier? The one which you had to fix up a bit? Bring them there. You also will no longer be named whatever your name is right now. (But just so you know, I always could find out)

You are now somebody else. Your first identity? Out the window. You went missing along with your bird. Change your physical appearance and avoid places where people you previously knew reside- which is probably no one you parasocial freak.

Now that you have your bird back at you-
*Teacher..?*
Yes? What now?
*Isn't this wrong?*
What is?
*This. All of this.*
No. Why would it be? 
*You...you are forcibly....*
Yes? But they agreed to be my friend, no? They promised they would never leave my side. All I am doing is ensuring that they follow through on their promises.
*But this isn't the correct way to-*
Is it not...? Then perhaps I should find another way to keep them. What do you suggest, hm?
*No, I-*
Enough.

Moving on, you have your bird trapped wherever it is you decided to trap them. Break their legs now. Best to use a hammer to try and aim for a comminuted fracture. For all the idiots it means a fracture where the bone shatters and different shards of bone spread apart. No need to break both legs. Just one. Aim for the femur. It takes the longest time to heal and is the most painful. This way running is impossible for them.

When they awake, they will likely be either completely panicked and screaming, or in shock. I prefer the first but the second is all right too. Get them pain meds for the bone you just broke. Also some kind of over the counter sedative. Maybe melatonin? Unless you'd like to hear their constant cries for help and attempts to escape during the night. I don't know. Some people like that.

Now you have effectively kidnapped someone! You have a new fri-
*They escaped.*
...what?
*Your...bird. Escaped.*
...he is trying to leave me.
*Yes*
It was not a question.

Now this happens from time to time. An escape attempt will go well and your pretty little bird will manage to run off. No matter. You are a fox anyways. Play for the hunt. A rifle or a shotgun is all you need. Go off. You can shoot them and kill them, or you can only hit one of their limbs and keep them alive to nurse them back to health. Either way works, just depends on your preference.

Me?
Oh, well I don't even bother using a gun. I chase after them and bring them back, be it screaming and kicking or with a rag shoved down their throat.

*Then what?*
Parden?
*Your "bird". After his escape attempt, do you...hurt him?*
Oh, no. All I do is ensure that he won't ever leave me again.
*How's that?*
I dismember his body parts and place them in jars. That way we will always be together.
*...*

Now! You have finally learned how to properly make an everlasting friend! Enjoy!
