First off, if you see this and you are my boss or co-workers, no you didn’t. Rest assured all names and identifying information of participant’s will be Changed in accordance with HIPPA, but I have to document what’s been happening to me for my own mental health, and I don’t particularly want to talk to HR about it. Anyway, let’s start from the beginning.

My name is Markus, I’m a 26-year-old nobody who just landed a new job as a DSP, a “Direct Support Provider” or a caretaker of sorts. I got fed-up with working in the retail rat race and decided to pivot into nursing adjacent occupations. Somehow, I landed a job with a local well-known disability advocate agency. I would be working in one of their total care homes overnight. My job duties are overwhelmingly simple, cleaning the house, doing laundry and assisting the participants when they need to get up and use the restroom. Occasionally I’d need to help them shower and get into or out of bed, but it’s surprisingly easy to get people into pajamas or day-clothes when you get showed the tricks of the trade. 

Participants is what I’m legally supposed to call the people that live here, and the total-care part of total-care home means that everyone who lives here in this building are wheelchair-bound and require help with most activities in their daily lives. That’s the care that my co-workers and I provide, to give disabled people a somewhat normal and comfortable life, and I’m quite proud to be a part of this agency, helping those who need it. 

The first month of my job was all training, 2 weeks of very boring classes at the head office and 2 weeks of in-home training with the overnight worker I was replacing. His name was Tiel, weird name I know, but I kind of like it. Tiel was moving to work daytime hours in the house and was giving me the rundown of what to do, who everyone was, the things they liked and their usual night-time routines. The house supported 10 people, 5 men and 5 women, however there were only 4 women living here when I started as the 5th resident recently passed away.  Her name was Nancy, and she loved to fingerpaint, some of her things were still in her room waiting for her family to collect them, so I looked through her dresser and found some of her paintings the first night I was there. There were a lot of handprint turkeys and cute little thumbprint bumble bees on cute little hand-flowers. Some cards the other participants made as a form of grief management were on her bed, and I was told her window blinds stayed open because she liked to be able to see outside and it made everyone feel better to see out that window when they passed by her old room.

I quickly got into the swing of things and the 2 weeks of training went by very fast, Tiel taught me more of the job. How some of the participants are fall risks, meaning they don’t have the strength to hold themselves upright and could fall out of bed if they tried to get up on their own, why it was so important for me to do 2-hour checks on all the participants and to investigate any noises in-case somebody had fallen. The last day of training Tiel and I were sitting at a table in the house kitchen, doing our own things to pass the time when he said that there was something he had to tell me about working overnights. He went on to describe how the house sometimes creaked in ways and from places that didn’t make sense, or how the shadows seemed to take humanoid shapes in your peripheral vision. That the activity had gotten more common since Nancy’s passing, and how sometimes he swears he can see hands on doorframes, that move quickly out of view. I’m not one to be spooked by the paranormal, I have a bit of a Moist Cr1tikal view of ghosts, I want to believe they are real but have never encountered anything that I could reasonably attribute to ghosts before. So, I shook off his stories, I’d worked plenty of graveyard shifts and no matter where I’d worked, everywhere seemed to have their own ghost stories. It's been 3 months since that day, and until yesterday I’d not encountered anything even remotely paranormal. 

It was 11:20pm, and I had just finished my bi-hourly checks of everyone and all were sound asleep, with all TVs and radios off. An eerie quiet set in after I sat back down at the kitchen table, the only sound being the creak followed by low hum of the central heating turning on and off, and the only light being a single fluorescent bulb above my laptop and chair. The house was a giant V shape, one hallway housing the men’s rooms and one hallway with the women’s with 2 bathrooms on each side. In the middle of the house where I sat was a combination kitchen and living room, we had a few storage closets to fill out the space but from the outside the building looked like a giant square. Because of this sound tended to echo and I tried to be very quiet while doing my nightly routines as to not wake anyone up while cleaning or checking on their neighbors. At the kitchen table I was working on some required training for a certification I needed to continue working here. In the middle of notetaking, I heard a decently loud ker-thunk echo down from the women’s hallway. I assumed Elizabeth had fallen out of bed again and went to check up on her, but she was still tucked safely into bed in the same position I had left her in 20 minutes prior. Okay, I thought, must have been Abigail? But again, no. Abby was exactly as I had left her, I checked everyone’s rooms after that, both Charlotte and Pam were also in bed, and nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary. It was strange, but not uncommon to hear weird on-off noises in the night. I chalked it up to the house settling or the cold outside and sat back down at my laptop to continue studying. 

Not 5 minutes went by before I heard the ker-thunk sound again. Out of obligation I got up to investigate, made sure everyone was still asleep, and that nothing in their rooms had fallen over. This time I even checked the windows to make sure they were closed and locked but could find no discernible source of the noise. I even took a peek inside Nancy’s old room since her door was open to make sure that nothing in there had fallen over, but everything looked fine, so I closed the door behind me. I sat back down, telling myself that perhaps the wind had picked up outside, and that coupled with the extremely low late-winter temperatures was causing some weird noises. When the noise happened a third time, I ignored it, but something tells me that whatever made the noise didn’t like that very much because the fourth time it happened it went from a decent ker-thunk to a startlingly loud ka-chunk. The house seemed to still after that noise, the central heating had turned off and even the hum of the fluorescent lighting above me was quiet. I waited a moment, half expecting to hear someone calling for help from their room, and half waiting for the air in the room to not feel so cold again.

I sighed very loudly masking my rising anxiety with annoyance and got up from my computer, making the rounds again. I was worried somebody might be trying to break in at this point and were being very un-sneaky about it. This time I also checking the men’s rooms to make sure I wasn’t miss-hearing where the noise was coming from. Nothing out of the ordinary, no people or objects on the floor that could make a noise that loud, and nobody outside anyone’s windows. It had been almost 40 minutes of strange noises, checking and re-checking rooms that I decided that I needed a break, everything was annoyingly fine, and I was getting into my own head about what this noise was. I pulled my phone out, scrolling the local news for a bit while I made myself some lunch. A grilled cheese and some juice in hand I sat back down at my laptop to read an article about proposed city ordinance changes. I quickly finished my lunch but spent maybe an hour or so losing time to one article after another, so lost in my own little bubble that I almost didn’t hear the soft ker-thunk directly behind me. I froze and something inside of me told me not to turn around, not to look behind me. A feeling of dread rising as I heard a series of small ker-thunks like stomping labored footsteps heading away from me and echoing down the women’s hallway. I waited, unmoving, until the only sound I could hear was the low hum of the light overhead.

After that I decided that the lights needed to be on the rest of the night, all the lights with no exceptions, hallway, kitchen, bathroom, didn’t matter, all on. I also played some music from my phone on a low volume and did anything and everything to distract myself from what I thought had just happened. The noises didn’t continue the rest of the night, and I was starting to calm down enough to rationalize that perhaps I had really freaked myself out, and that everything was fine. Two more bi-hourly checks went by without any more occurrences and before I knew it, I was on my last round of checks before I headed home for the morning. I checked the men first, then Elizabeth, Abigail, Charlotte and Pam. I shut Pam’s door behind me mentally preparing myself to drive home and get some sleep before I come back tonight and noticed that across the hallway, Nancy’s door was slightly ajar. I did close that door earlier, and my morning co-workers had just arrived 5 minutes ago and were still in the kitchen. 

The feeling from earlier came back, something inside me saying not to peek inside her room, but I did anyway. I pushed the door open and walked inside, everything was exactly where it had been left hours ago, except the window where there was the faint outline of a handprint. I got a closer look; it wasn’t uncommon for there to be passerby in the night and perhaps somebody had put their hand up to the window to look inside since the blinds were up, That had to be it, somebody was outside last night, maybe trying to case the home through the windows and left an identifying mark on the window where they looked inside. Only… the handprint was on the inner pane of glass, not the outer one, who ever made this handprint did it from inside the house. Surely this wasn’t here earlier? It was faint but I still spotted it right away, I would have seen it earlier. The hair on the back of my neck stood up as I had an idea, I grabbed one of Nancy’s paintings from her dresser and held it up to the window. It was a near-perfect match. I heard one of my co-workers calling for me, so I placed the painting back into the dresser and tried my hardest to push this whole evening to the farthest corners of my mind. 

I went home that morning, played a few rounds of video games and went to sleep. I wont lie and say it was hard to fall asleep, it’s hard to feel scared when the sun is peeking through your curtains. But it was hard coming back to work the next day, after dreaming about that ker-thunk that has now buried itself deep into my brain.
