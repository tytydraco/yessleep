**Midnight.** I just boarded the train. My phone battery is at 92%. The train is *cramped*, there's hardly any available seats at all, which I hate because now I have to sit next to somebody. I choose the spot on the left side of the guy who looks like he's been ripped from an western movie. He's already fast asleep, and that's what I'm hoping to be in just a bit. Writing this down because typing helps me unwind.

**0:26** There's just been a loudspeaker announcement. The first one since I boarded, which is kinda weird. Normally, those come up every time a train arrives at or leaves a station, don't they? Anyways, the voice was really strange. All deep and choky. I couldn't understand what the guy was saying at all. I'm having trouble falling asleep. Thought I'd be out like a light in a matter of seconds, so I'm a little disappointed.

**0:51** I forgot how long the train ride is actually going to be. I keep trying to pull up my online ticket on my phone, but I can't seem to find it anywhere. Battery's at 83%. I'm texting with my mom to pass the time.

**0:55** Mom doesn't remember I was going to board this train tonight. I was so sure I told her. She asked me where I was headed and if this was for work or something, and get this, I didn't know what to tell her. I literally don't know. Where even is this train going? Why in the world am I here? I don't know if I'm amused at my own stupidity or if this is something I should be concerned about. I'm not drunk or high or anything. Is this what brain damage looks like?

**0:59** I've been trying to ask around to figure out where the train is going but nobody's telling me shit. I'm freaking out. I don't know what to do. I can't find anything about it online either. Something's very wrong here. The guy next to me still hasn't woken up. Battery's at 67%. It's emptying a lot faster than before. I can't find my charger. I don't know if I even had it with me. 

**1:02** I have no luggage. I can't remember packing. I can't remember waiting at the station. What the fuck is happening? 

**1:25** A new passenger got on. At least she claims she only just boarded now. I actually don't know how because the train didn't stop, she just walked into our wagon. She's shaking and crying and she was looking for a seat. She's not talking to me exactly, she's simply standing in the aisle, rambling and sobbing. 

**1:38** I'm crying, too, by now. As loud as the other girl, if not louder. I'm fucking terrified. The train isn't going to stop. I can't get off anymore. I think I get it. I don't want this. I want to get out. I want my Mom. God, no. What did I do to deserve this?

**1:56** The guy next to me just woke up. He's been stirring for a while now, I think I'm keeping him awake with my weeping. So I grab him and I go, "Help me, please for the love of God, help me!" And he says there's nothing he can do. He asks for my name and I tell him it's Julee, and he tells me he's Jack. He goes, "Julee, you gotta calm down. Either you calm down or you end up getting thrown off the train. You don't wanna get thrown off the train."

So I ask, "What happens when you get thrown off?", and he says you'll never get to the final destination, but you can't go back either. I ask if there *is* a way back and he just shakes his head no. I don't want that to happen. Not to me or anyone, so I start trying to calm down this girl, but it's really difficult. She keeps wailing and thrashing around, and I tell her that I get it because I'm scared, too, but she won't hear it. She literally just hit me, square across the face, so I think I'll stop now.

**2:37** The girl got thrown off. There was train staff, two of them, and they grabbed her and just dragged her away. I don't know where to, I tried to follow them but Jack held me back. He says that I'll lose my internet connection soon, because we're almost there. Arrival is scheduled for three a.m..

**2:56** I've spent the last couple minutes texting my mom. I tried to call her, too, but it's not letting me. So I sent her a voicemail and she sent one back. She was a little confused because I kept telling her how much I love her. She's up really late for me, and she says she'll go to bed now, so I sent her another goodnight voicemail. I hope she keeps it, for when she misses me. I've listened to hers over and over again, and her voice is as sweet and comforting as always. I have to turn my phone off now. It's nearly dead anyways. 

Jack is still awake. We're going to the same place so I guess I'll just keep talking to him. He's very understanding, actually. He's just been on the train longer, so he's had more time to "deal" with it all. We're both looking forward to getting off the train by now.

*10 a.m.* This is gonna be really hard to explain. Seven hours ago, I woke up in a hospital room. Some guy t-boned my car and apparently, things were looking dire for me. I was unresponsive; in fact, the medical staff thought I was gone for good. 

Here's the thingâ€”I found these notes on my phone. The stuff I shared up above. I swear, I don't remember any of this shit. My mom only just got notified of my accident, and she's on her way here. I already went through our chat history, and the texts and voicemails I've been describing... they're there, it's all there. It was all written while I was out cold, doctors fighting for my life. There should have been no way for these notes to come into existence. I can't fucking believe it. I don't know what to make of this. That is, I do know, but the implications are just too much for me right now. I figured I'd post this. I'm gonna sleep some more now, and wait for my mom to get here. I can't wait to see her.
