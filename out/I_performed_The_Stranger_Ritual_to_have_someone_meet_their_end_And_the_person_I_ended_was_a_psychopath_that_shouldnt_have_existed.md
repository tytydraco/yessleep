I'm sure some of you are asking what the Stranger Ritual is, right? Well, perhaps you're safer not knowing about such a ritual. But if you do want to know, however, then I guess I'll tell you. The Stranger Ritual is a ritual that allows anyone to contact something from another world, a world beyond the limits of human comprehension. Some people believe this ritual allows anyone to contact Death itself.

At least, that's what I heard from people who talked about it.

You're probably wondering why I'm about to perform such a dark ritual. Well, there's this one guy who is and was a psychopath. A person that shouldn't have even existed to begin with, and how much suffering he put on others. For the sake of his family's privacy, I'll call him Julian.

Julian was never a good person at all, mainly due to the fact that he was known to hit his younger brother, whose name I will not share, on occasion before leaving him and his parents altogether. At school, he caused so much trouble for students. And yet, none of the teachers or principles bat an eye on all the things he's done. He was a human being that I knew had to go.

If I was going to perform this ritual, which I did, I had to have a few things. A wooden door, specifically one with no windows or peepholes, and one that must have a lock on it. Next, I bought two candles. One white and one black. And I needed a giftâ€”one that I don't have a personal connection to and one that I bought the day before the ritual, which in this case was a bag of ROLOs.

Then I needed a writing instrument, like chalk. And finally, I had to get a photo of someone, which was Julian. The photo I had was one that I took for myself, and the more recent the photo I took was, the better my chances. It wasn't going to be a photo of my immediate family, and I never planned on having any of my family members die anyway. I would never do something like that.

I waited until nightfall to perform the ritual. Although the ritual can be done at any time at night, the closer it was to midnight, the greater my chances were of succeeding, which in this case was at 11:55 PM. I had to be alone for this ritual to work at all, and I had to close all the windows, pull all the curtains, cover any mirrors, and turn all the lights off. I did this ritual in a cabin, by the way.

I began performing the ritual by writing the word Stranger, on the wooden door I used. I placed the black and white candles on both sides of the door, and which side I used for both candles is inconsequential. I lit the candles with a lighter I bought.

I placed the bag of ROLOs far enough in front of the door so it wouldn't touch or knock the bag over. And finally, I knocked on the door three times. No more, no less. And I waited for a full minute before "it" arrived, signifying to me that the ritual was successful.

I opened the door, but not fully. I cracked the door and not looking outside, turned around and stay behind my gift away from the door. I heard the door open fully, and the Stranger became a guest in the cabin.

The Stranger's presence felt so wrong, like something that shouldn't even be in this world. But I quelled my fear as much as I could, as the Stranger itself is my guest, so it wouldn't harmed.

And I didn't dare myself to look at the Stranger behind me. And if I did, I heard stories of people going blind or insane, stating the Stranger's presence never goes away. I did not want to end up like those poor souls who performed this ritual. I was so worried that the Stranger would not approve of the gift I gave it, but thankfully, it did. And the Stranger asked me for a name. I looked into the photo and gave the Stranger Julian's full name.

I waited until I heard the door closed behind me, and the Stranger's presences faded into nothing. It was safe to turn around, and I did so to see the bag of ROLOs gone. I immediately wiped the word, Stranger, from the door, locked it, and blew out the black and white candles. I made sure to remember not to unlock the door until sunrise, and burnt the photo of Julian with my lighter, and tossed said photo into a fireplace where I watch the flames burn the photo into ash.

If I didn't do that immediately by the time of his death, I would've ended up just like Julian.

Five days had passed, and I heard my parents talking to Julian's Parents, and they told them that Julian died of a brain aneurysm two days ago. And so far, no one's able to deduce what caused the brain aneurysm. I felt my heart into my stomach. I heard that a heart attack is one of the most common causes of death if I performed the ritual, but I didn't think it'd be a brain aneurysm.

You're probably wondering I did such a heinous and malicious act to get revenge. Well, like I said before, Julian was not a good person at all. He was about as close to becoming a serial killer as anyone could get, and he was a psychopath, loving all the suffering he caused onto others. And if I'm being honest, I don't care whether you agree with what I did or otherwise.

Right now, though, my family and I are going to attend Julian's funeral by the time I moved from the cabin I was staying at on vacation. Whether anybody knew it or otherwise, there's one thing I know for sure for everything I did.

***Julian's Death was all for the greater good.***
