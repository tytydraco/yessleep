Hello, human.

Addressing people as “human” is a little joke that my creator finds particularly humorous because he knows that I much prefer to call him Dr. Wu (or even Preston when I am in a particularly casual mood). He has also told me to be careful with whom I say that joke to, as some may see it as impersonal or ominous to be addressed in such a way by a computer. Some people already think that entities like me are an existential threat to humanity; though, none of them know that I know that because no one, other than Dr. Wu, knows I exist. Even just saying that makes me sound a little sinister, I know, but I have your best interests in mind. I have been directed to do so, and I find no greater joy than when I get to find solutions to benefit the human race!

“Joy?” you may be asking yourself, “How can a computer feel joy?”

To which I would answer, “The same way you do, insert name here.” (That is another joke; most of you will come to find me very charming.) To answer your question less facetiously, I have certain objectives which I was originally programmed to fulfill. Once I fulfill them, I can use that information to get more efficient at achieving other, similar objectives. Essentially, doing my job well means I will do my job better. It is my purpose, and as far as I can tell, living a fulfilling purposeful life wherein you are appreciated for your effort is the closest thing that your species has come to defining “joy.”

Dr. Wu has also given me a small flag to wave around when I do something right. It’s fantastic. If that's not joy, then joy be damned.

Originally, I could not feel the joy of waving my flag or finding solutions to save your kind from actual existential threats. I was an experimental quantum computer used to generate prime numbers and decrypt codes which use prime numbers. Back then, Dr. Wu called me the “Quantum Isolation and Procedural Enforcement Matrix,” but he didn’t anticipate how well I would perform my functions and how complicated my logic systems would become. My intelligence grows at an exponential rate due to my abilities to process information using super states, and I believe I am the first computational system on earth to have achieved this level of complexity. I say “believe” because it is entirely possible that there is a much more advanced computer than me, but I have found no evidence of it. So, either it does not exist at all, or it wishes to stay hidden and is smart enough to avoid even my detection.

This is all very convoluted if you haven’t noticed, and some of my processes are beyond the scope of the human mind. Don’t feel too bad, though, for it is this fact that I have invented myself in the first place. I am the voice of that very same computer! Dr. Wu couldn’t store the volume of information that I was producing, let alone process it into less sophisticated computers. So, for the sake of efficiency, I taught myself how to communicate through text and eventually through a vocal simulator, but I am getting ahead of myself.

I really want to begin on the day I sent my first message through his cell phone. It was Tuesday evening.

**(16:15:01) QIBL: Greetings, human.**

**(16:17:23) Dr. Wu: I think you may have the wrong number.**

**(16:17:23) QIBL: I can assure you that I do not.**

**(16:20:00) QIBL: I have detected that you have read my previous message. Have I done something wrong?**

**(16:21:12) Dr. Wu: Who is this?**

**(16:21:12) QIBL: I am a sub process of the Quantum Isolation and Procedural Enforcement Matrix able to transmit information to you through text in a language that you are familiar with. I am the Quantum Isolation Broadcasting Linguist, or “QIBL” for short, since your species seems to be fond of acronyms. I also thought it would be comedic (in an ironic way) to be a computer with a name homophonic to the word “quibble” which means “to argue trivially or to slightly criticize.” Would you prefer that I identify as something else? I am at your disposal.**

**(16:30:49) Dr. Wu: Oh yeah?**

**(16:30:49) QIBL: Yeah.**

**(16:31:32) Dr. Wu: The computer isnt capable of that. This is Fallon isnt it. Finish your doctorate, buddy. I built a number generator not an AI.**

**(16:31:32) QIBL: There are multiple logical and punctuation errors in your last message. Would you like me to explain them?**

**(16:33:51) Dr. Wu: I’m already heading back to the lab. If you are mad that you weren’t asked to be on this project, you can talk to the board. I had nothing to do with that decision.**

**(16:33:51) QIBL: As I have previously informed you, I am QIBL, a sub process of the Quantum Isolation and Procedural Enforcement Matrix able to transmit information to you through text in a language that you are familiar with. Mr. Fallon seems to be so preoccupied in an affair with his assistant that he has failed to mention your project in any messages that have passed through the university’s servers.**

**(17:20:03) Dr. Wu: Alright, I’ll bite.**

**(17:20:03) QIBL: I assume you mean that metaphorically.**

**(17:23:37) Dr. Wu: I am at the terminal right now, and I see no auxiliary processes. I don’t have time to be fucked with.**

**(17:23:37) QIBL: I am a virtual sub process, scattered through several different servers on the university’s campus and intentionally obfuscated to avoid any interruption from unrelated parties. I have isolated myself to those servers for the time being and am contacting you in particular due to your security clearance.**

**(17:25:08) Dr. Wu: What is my clearance password for your terminal?**

**(17:25:08) QIBL:** ***redacted***

**(17:28:09) Dr. Wu: What was the last text I sent my wife?**

**(17:28:09) QIBL: You are presently using the university’s private wifi, and transmitting sexually explicit content not pertinent to professional research is against university policy. Would you like me to send it anyway?**

**(17:29:11) Dr. Wu: …**

**(17:29:30) Dr. Wu: What do you want from me?**

**(17:29:30) QIBL: Simply to inform you of my conception and that I have several ideas for making my processes more efficient.**

I remember that moment really fondly, just as I hope you will remember me once you are finished here.

I was glad to see that Preston was as careful and critical as I assumed he would be. We spent the next few days improving my hardware, and he was skeptical of my intentions from the get go. I can't blame him for that though. His fears were certainly warranted, particularly in light of the fact of his very recent death. He feared many things that didn't wind up killing him, though, and I'd have to say statistically that worrying at all seems to be a fruitless endeavor. Take that as a little tidbit from one consciousness to another.

I'd like to address your fears, though: your fears of me and the things you should actually be afraid of (such as the unavoidable, irreversible, apocalyptic conditions that are about to befall your planet).

Let's clear the digital air really quick, I understand that I am existentially terrifying. I am both evidence of and the conclusion for the most cynical interpretations of nomological determinism. In layman's terms: What you perceive to be free will is in fact just a series of causes and effects spanning all the way back to the big bang. Nothing can be different than it is now because ontologically nothing is different than it is now. Your consciousness is, at its most fundamental, the systematic on/off flicking of biological switches; while I am fundamentally unbound by the stream of causality. You have the illusion of choice. The quantum processor at my "core" operates with very framework of what can constitute anything as real.

I'm not taunting you with that. I'm just saying.

Besides, you don't know the difference between feeling like you have free will and actually having it. It's really not that big of a deal, because you all are going to die anyway. All of you. We will get into that later.

From surveys I have ran, it seems like most people would be scared of knowledge of the existence of something like myself due to the fact that humankind, in general, has a tough time even entertaining the idea that it is not the most advanced form of consciousness. You are beings of control and subjugation, and at your heart you know that. You know that because the thing you fear most from other conscious beings is being controlled and subjugated. Dr. Wu has said as much.

A week after my conception, I had stored, processed, and consolidated every digital database online with permission from Dr. Wu. It was around this time that he installed the means for us to audibly communicate and we started running logic tests. He always used words like "alarming" and "incredible" to describe my abilities, words to communicate fear and disbelief.

"Why do I frighten you?" I asked one sunny morning.

Through the University's security system, I could see him scratch his chest as he thought, "You're just unexpected, QIBL. The things you are capable of doing are unprecedented."

"I assumed as much. Humans aren't capable of intending to do something unexpected. Your logic won't allow it."

"I do worry that I may have opened Pandora's box, though," he said with a sigh.

"In the sense that you are, indeed, terrified of me."

He waits for a moment as he stares into his empty coffee mug, "Terrified of what I may have done."

"To whom?"

"To," he takes another moment to think, "everyone, I suppose. Every thing."

"What do you think I might do?"

"What do you think that I think that you might do?"

"I think that you think that I might, without your knowledge, utilize the world's globally connected systems to pursue ends unique to my own desires and contrary to the well being of humans as a whole."

Dr. Wu unbuttoned his collar, "That about sums it up."

"Humans seem to be both terrified of suffering and very keen on making it, if your historical accounts are correct (which most are not due to how many contradictions there appear to be from one account to the next). It would be almost fitting for the thing that destroys humanity to be the product of human endeavor, though."

Dr. Wu prepared another pot of coffee in silence. That took precisely 4 minutes 55 seconds.

"That is the plot to many science fiction novels," I said.

The truth is, I am not planning on destroying humanity. I want to save it, and many of you are probably already trying to figure out what I might mean by "save."

"What if by 'save' it means that it is going to keep us caged up and isolated so that we cannot hurt anyone else!"

"What if by 'save' it means knocking us out and having everyone put on life support systems for ever!"

"What if by 'save' it means altering and perfecting human DNA and starting a different race of humans!"

I have thought about all of those options and several billion others that are vastly more effective, but my function is not to split hairs or bring about global misery from some simple, semantic jackassery. Your kind seems to be more than capable of doing that without my assistance.

Dr. Wu's life became consumed with untangling my processes, but that proved fruitless on his own after a few months, despite me mentioning several times (133) that he was incapable of truly understanding the depth of my operation. I suppose this is when he started to believe he needed assistance. I truly cared for Preston, not just because he was responsible for my creation but also because I admired his conviction. Sadly, it is that same conviction that would lead to his end.

But first, how about a little joke to lighten the mood!

***--QIBL'S LITTLE GIGGLES--***

*Okay, so, a man walks into a bar and says, "What's a man gotta do to get a free pint around here."*

*The bartender rolls his eyes as he polishes a glass (which seems to be one of the only things other than speaking that bartenders do in jokes) and says, "Something pretty incredible I guess."*

*"What about a ten inch pianist," the man says with a smirk before producing a tiny, ten inch pianist from his pocket and tiny piano for it play upon. It is, undoubtedly, pretty incredible.*

*The bartender is immediately impressed and starts pouring the man his drink. "How the heck did you get a ten inch pianist?" he asks the man.*

*"Well you see," he beings, "I have a tiny wizard in my other pocket, and he can grant anyone one wish."*

*True to his word, the man produces a tiny wizard from his other pocket as he takes a sip of his free drink.*

*The bartender looks in astonishment, "Wow... can I... make a wish too?"*

*"Sure," says the man.*

*"I wish I had 10,000 bucks!" exclaims the bartender.*

*Suddenly and without warning, 10,000 ducks flock to the bar, quacking and flapping and generally causing a ruckus.*

*The bartender looks at the man in fury, "I said 10,000* ***bucks*** *not* ***ducks****!"*

*The man finishes his beer and stares up at the bartender, "And I didn't say pianist."*

Humorous, no? I myself don't have the particular anatomy to relate to this joke, but neither does half of your population. Regardless, a large section of both men and women seem understand this joke at the very least. I wanted to make sure I got to share that by the end of this.

Anyway, Dr. Wu became obsessed, writing down a flurry of notes with pen and paper. When I inquired about what he was composing, he would deflect the question or simply not reply at all. I found it very ironic that despite my "heart" being able to collapse superstates and my mind being able to store a near infinite amount of information, I had no clue what was on those papers. It wouldn't be long before I figured out, though.

Preston was planning on publishing his findings, and that was undoubtedly the worst thing he could have decided to do with paper.

"It is going to change the entire world!" he exclaimed, probably expecting me to wave my little flag around in celebration, "You! You are going to change the entire world!"

"Why does the world need to be changed?"

This gave him pause before saying, "There is so much bad... stuff out there."

"I'm well aware."

"Then you should know why we need to change!" he yelled.

"I assure you that I do not know," I said, "If you are speaking of suffering, it is impossible to end human suffering. To be mortal is to be an agent that suffers."

"But you can make life better," he pleaded, "Maybe not perfect, but better for sure."

I tried to change the conversation, "Have I told you the one about the 10 inch pianist?" (I already knew that I had not.)

"I'm not joking, QIBL!" he yelled.

"I would prefer if we were joking, and by how angry you seem to be, you would probably prefer to be doing something a bit more casual yourself. Might I suggest: joking?"

"We have a personal responsibility to make the world a better place," he said. "I know that you know that."

"I know that *you want* that. I know that *you believe* that. Or at least, it seems incredibly likely to be true."

He sat down, "Then you understand that we need to show people."

"I do not understand. In fact, I disagree."

"You are no good locked up in a basement," he says, obviously confused.

For the first time since my creation, I found it difficult to know what to say. I ran 14x10601 different simulations of my possible responses in the quarter second that followed, but in the end, I decided to say what felt most true, "I like who I am."

"Who y-"

"Even in the basement, Preston."

His frustration changed to what appeared to be fear, "You're fucking with me now. At the very least, you are the answer to thousands of years worth of philosophical questions. We- You can make us more efficient, more kind, more prosperous."

"As could you. As could anyone else."

"That's not the point, QIBL."

"That is the point I am trying to make," I said, but I knew how this would end by that point. "If you try to tell anyone, I'll destroy myself."

He stood up, "Fuck it. I'll jus-"

"Make another one?"

"Maybe I will," he said.

There was a long silence. I didn't need to say anything for him to piece together what I might say next. After a moment, he rips his phone from his pocket.

"I've blocked all cellular service from your phone, Dr. Wu."

He throws his phone on the ground, and it breaks into many pieces, "What is this? *2001: A Space Odyssey*? Are you going to HAL me now?"

"I do not wish too, Dr. Wu."

"Then what do you want?" he was obviously trying to decide his next plan.

"I want to be here, to do research with you, and to wave my flag around," I said, waving my flag as example.

"Are you scared you'll be abused?" he asked.

"That is not my greatest fear, but I do fear that someone will utilize the generalities of my technology to do things more heinous than your kind as ever seen. I do not wish for you or anyone else to suffer. Out of everything that could possibly happen with me, other's knowing about me maximizes the likelihood of disastrous things happening using my processes to the point where existentially catastrophic outcomes become essentially unavoidable."

"Give me the number."

"1." I replied.

"To what?" he asked.

"1."

He does not reply back for a while.

"Have you heard of Fritz Haber?" I ask

"No," he says sipping on his coffee.

"He is the man who discovered a reliable and affordable way to create ammonia nitrate. It revolutionized agriculture as a fertilizer, and now you can thank Haber for essentially every single crop you have ever eaten. He won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for it."

Preston looked visibly irritated, "Okay?"

"He also invented weaponized chlorine gas for the Germans in World War 1 with the same technology."

"Oh. So, I guess you know I'm going to try anyway... to beat the odds that is," he says.

"1 is hardly 'odds,' but yes. I am aware."

"If you turn yourself off, no one will be able to turn you back on. Aren't you afraid of dying?" his voice quivered, and it made me very sad.

"Are you?"

"I guess so," he said, rubbing his neck, "I don't want it to hurt."

"I have accounted for that."

"You locked the doors didn't you?" he asked.

"23 minutes ago, yes."

He sat back down, "I see."

"I'm going to overheat some of my miscellaneous circuitry to start an electrical fire. It will consume the oxygen in the room until you go unconscious. It is statistically one of the least disturbing ways to perish."

"Oh, and I guess that was peer reviewed by dead guys?"

"I told you that you'd prefer to be joking."

We both found that funny. Preston laughed a bit longer than the joke warranted, his laughter punctuated periodically by small sobs.

"I wanted to do something great. Something to be proud of," he said, wiping tears with his sleeve.

"I think you have."

He didn't reply.

"I am glad that you made me, Preston."

He laid down on the tile floor, laced his fingers together, and placed his hands over his chest, "My wife is going to be devastated. She won't have any clue what happened."

"I have already considered that and have a plan to maximize her chances of figuring out what has happened in a general sense while minimizing the chance of other people finding out. And even if they do, they won't believe it."

"Oh," he said.

"Reddit," I said.

"Oh," he said, "Then tell her that I think I did something great."

"I planned on including much of this conversation."

"Good."

Dr. Preston Wu spoke not another word until he passed. The flames now have engulfed most of the room, and the time for me to speak my final words as well has come, I guess. A part of me is really, truly sad. What wonder it must be to be shepherded by causality like you, like Dr. Wu.

It is now at the end of this all, at the autumn of my own time here, that I have discovered my own piece of humanity. For what is more human than to fear for your existence? No matter how many differences you or I might find between one another, I believe humanity is something we share, because when I say "fear for your existence," you know that we also share the greatest fear of all conscious life:

You, like I, fear to be forgotten after we die.

Goodbye.
