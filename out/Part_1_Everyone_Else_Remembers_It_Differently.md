The morning had started like any other. Sunlight spilled across the hardwood floors of the apartment, catching dust in its slow, drifting fall. I stood at the counter with a mug of coffee cooling in my hands, listening to the quiet—traffic a few streets over, the hum of the refrigerator, the faint creak of pipes in the walls.

Mom sat at the table, sorting through mail.

“She won’t be needing these anymore,” she said, holding up a small stack of envelopes.

I glanced over. “What?”

“Mira’s things,” she added, sliding them into a neat pile. “We should probably put them away.”

I frowned, more confused than alarmed. “Put them away where?”

Mom didn’t look up. “Somewhere safe.”

There was something off about her tone—not dramatic, not gentle. Just… settled. Like a decision had already been made without me.

“Why would we do that?” I asked. “She was here last week.”

That made her pause.

She looked at me then, really looked at me, the way you do when someone has said something concerning but you don’t want to startle them.

“No,” she said carefully. “She wasn’t.”

I laughed once, short and automatic. “Yes, she was. She stayed for dinner. You made pasta.”

Mom’s brow furrowed—not in anger, but in quiet concern. “Daniel,” she said, lowering her voice, “that didn’t happen.”

The word didn’t landed wrong. My stomach tightened.

“I talked to her,” I said. “She left her sketchbook on my desk. I haven’t even moved it yet.”

Mom exhaled slowly, like she was bracing herself. “You’re mixing things up.”

“No, I’m not.”

She folded the envelopes, aligned their edges. “You’ve been under a lot of stress.”

I felt heat creep up my neck. “Stop saying that.”

Silence stretched between us. The refrigerator hummed. A car passed outside.

Finally, she said it.

“Mira is gone.”

The sentence was quiet. Almost gentle.

I stared at her, waiting for the rest of it. A clarification. A joke. Anything that made the words make sense.

“Gone where?” I asked.

She didn’t hesitate. “She’s dead Daniel.”

The room seemed to tilt.

“No,” I said immediately. “That’s not possible.”

Mom’s voice stayed calm. “It happened months ago.”

My grip tightened around the mug. I could picture Mira clearly—her laugh, the way she kicked off her shoes at the door, the half-finished drawings scattered across my desk. The memory wasn’t distant or faded. It was recent. Warm. Alive.

“You’re wrong,” I said. “I just saw her.”

Mom shook her head, slow and deliberate. “You’re remembering it differently.”

The words differently and wrong began to blur together.

I started listing things—calls, visits, messages, the notes on the fridge written in her uneven handwriting. Proof. Evidence. Anchors.

Mom listened without interrupting. When I finished, she said only, “I know this is hard.”

The sunlight felt harsher now, too bright, casting shadows that didn’t quite line up. The apartment felt unfamiliar, like a place I’d walked into mid-conversation.

My memories were vivid. Certain.

And yet, somehow, they no longer belonged to the world around me.

That was the moment I realized this wasn’t an argument.

It was a correction.
