This all started a few years ago. I’m a big sports fan, and one of my biggest sporting heroes was Bruce Jenner. I don’t believe in dead naming, so when Caitlyn was a footballer, I followed her career religiously. When she got injured, it was devastating for me, I could only imagine how it felt for her. But Jenner was a natural athlete, and when she transitioned to track and field, I knew she was going to be a star.

When she switched to the decathlon, I was skeptical at first. But when the 1976 Summer Olympics rolled around, she won the gold medal and broke the men’s world record in the decathlon. As her biggest fan, it was a monumental moment for me.

I have a room filled with Caitlyn Jenner memorabilia from before she transitioned, some of which is worth a fortune. I never intended to sell it, though. I planned to pass it down to my grandkids someday, but that has all changed now.

One of my best memories of Caitlyn came when I won a competition to spend the day golfing with her. I’d probably get in trouble with my wife for saying this, but that day was up there with the birth of my children as one of the best days of my life. She was the nicest person I’d ever met, humble and inspiring. After golfing, we had beers and talked about football. That’s why I’m so confused about how all of this started.

When the news broke that Caitlyn was transitioning, I was sad, not because of her decision to live as a woman, but because, to me, Bruce had died. In a way, I was mourning him. I had learned from my grandkids all about dead naming and how upsetting it can be for someone who is transitioning, but I didn’t think what I did was dead naming. I just wanted to give Bruce a respectful send-off. I thought Caitlyn would appreciate the gesture. I had no idea that sending her a mourning card with her old name and a bouquet of flowers would turn my life into a nightmare.

It all started with the coffins. I had just retired from my job and was coming home for the last time when I found a coffin in my driveway.

No one saw who placed the solid oak coffin there. It was a complete mystery, as though it had materialized out of thin air. The police were just as baffled. I had to convince them this wasn’t some kind of warning and that I had no affiliation with the Mafia. In the end, we chalked it up to someone dumping a bit of rubbish.

I didn’t think much of it until I woke up to find two more coffins in my driveway. The fear that this was some targeted message was too much to ignore. 

I decided to install two cameras outside my house, hoping to catch whoever was behind this. The situation had gone beyond strange, and I needed answers. I positioned the cameras to capture every angle of the driveway, street, and front door. Each night, I locked the house up tight, praying the cameras would reveal the culprit. I convinced myself it had to be a prank, someone messing with me after my retirement or my Caitlyn Jenner obsession. But deep down, the growing sense of dread wouldn’t let go.

The first morning after setting up the cameras, I checked the footage with trembling hands. Nothing. The entire night passed without a single suspicious figure. Just the occasional passing car. I felt a brief sense of relief, but it quickly faded. The second night, I locked the doors again, feeling more on edge. The next morning, I was horrified to find two more coffins, this time inside my sitting room.

I rushed to check the cameras, certain they had caught something this time. But again, nothing. No one had come near the house, let alone entered it. The coffins had appeared as if placed by some invisible force. My heart pounded in my chest. How were they getting in? And why me? These coffins were no longer just strange occurrences; they were messages, silent, and impossible to understand. And I was no closer to figuring it out.

A week after the coffins started appearing, the letters began. At first, they seemed harmless, carefully written notes delivered to my mailbox, all speaking glowingly about Caitlyn Jenner. The handwriting was elegant, almost too neat, with every letter praising her accomplishments. The author admired her bravery, her strength, and her perseverance through adversity. But something about the tone felt off. The letters were too personal, as though the writer knew every detail of her life with an intimacy that bordered on obsessiveness. What struck me most, though, was how each note felt oddly self-congratulatory, as if Caitlyn herself had written them, celebrating not only her journey but her influence over my life.

As the letters kept coming, I couldn’t shake the strange feeling they gave me. They began to describe events that no ordinary fan would know: our golf day together, the exact conversations we had about football and even personal details about my family. The writer was either an obsessive fan or, impossibly, Caitlyn Jenner herself. But why would she do this? Each letter, no matter how flattering, left me more unsettled. The praise no longer felt genuine; it seemed like a twisted game, as though the writer was trying to make me question reality itself. The letters, much like the coffins, had begun to feel like another part of the nightmare, trapping me in a world where admiration had turned into something far more sinister.

A few days later, another letter arrived, but this one was different. The elegant handwriting was still there, but the tone had shifted to something much darker. It started with the usual praise for Caitlyn, but as I read on, my stomach turned. The writer mentioned Bruce’s infamous car accident, where someone had died, and how Bruce had "gotten away with it." The letter then twisted into something more sinister: "If Bruce could get away with that, just imagine what Caitlyn could do." My hands shook as I read the final line, the casual threat hanging in the air like a noose around my neck. Whoever was sending these letters wasn’t just obsessed, they were dangerous, and they were telling me that Caitlyn Jenner, or whoever was behind this, could make me disappear just as easily.

I stepped outside my house for some fresh air, trying to clear my mind from the endless letters and coffins, when I noticed a car parked down the street. It sat in the empty darkness of the street with its engine revving softly, but the headlights off, almost as if it was waiting for something or someone. The stillness of the night only amplified the sinister vibe coming from the car. I froze, the palpable fear creeping up my spine as I stared at it, my instincts screaming that something was very wrong. Then, without warning, the interior light flicked on, and to my horror, Caitlyn Jenner was sitting behind the wheel, with a manic smile spread across her face. 

Before I could react, the car's engine roared to life and the headlights suddenly switched on, blinding me. In a split second, she floored the gas and the car lunged toward me with terrifying speed. My body reacted before my mind could catch up. I leapt to the side, hitting the ground hard just as the car sped past, its tyres skidding on the pavement where I had been standing only moments before. The screech of rubber against the tarmac echoed in the night as the car disappeared down the street, leaving me gasping for breath, my heart pounding wildly in my chest. That wasn’t just a warning, it felt like a promise.

The night after the car incident, I lay awake in bed, staring at the ceiling, unable to shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong. Just as I began to drift off a rustling noise, jolted me from my bed. My heart pounded as I made my way downstairs and crept towards the living room, convinced that my imagination was getting the better of me. But as I approached, the rustling grew louder and before I could fully process what was happening, a figure lunged at me from behind the couch, and my world went black as something heavy struck my head.

When I finally came to, I found myself lying on a plush, oversized bed, disoriented and surrounded by the unmistakable scent of lavender. I blinked against the bright light and sat up, my blood running cold as I took in my surroundings. The walls of the room were plastered with pictures of me, hundreds of them, capturing moments from my life like some kind of twisted museum exhibit. There I was, grinning next to Caitlyn on the golf course, laughing at an inside joke, and even random snapshots from my family gatherings and vacations. It felt surreal as if I had stumbled into a nightmare where I was the star of a bizarre horror show. The sheer creepiness of it all sent a chill down my spine as I realized that Caitlyn was obsessed with me, collecting pieces of my life as if they were trophies.

Desperate to escape Caitlyn I forced a smile, channelling my best charm.

 “Caitlyn, this is incredible! We should totally be friends and go for another round of golf!” I said, trying to mask my horror with enthusiasm.

 Her eyes lit up with excitement as she began to set up a camera to document our our  time together. The absurdity of the situation hit me hard. Here I was, trying to convince my childhood idol, now a deranged stalker, that we could be pals. As she prepped the camera, my heart raced as I took my chance and bolted for the door. I was running from my childhood hero turned maniac, and as I stumbled through the hall, I couldn’t help but think this was the strangest twist of fate I could have ever imagined.

As I burst through the front door and sprinted down the street, I could hear the pounding of footsteps behind me, frantic and relentless. Caitlyn was hot on my heels, her hair flying wildly in the wind as she shouted at the top of her lungs, 

“You can’t escape me! I’m your hero! I’m your inspiration! You need me.” 

As my age started to catch up to me I suddenly remembered Caitlyn was a Track and Field star. I was being chased by possiably the fastest woman in the world. 

She broke into a full on sprint, as if she was back racing in the 1976 Summer Olympics and I knew I wasn’t going to be able to out run her. Just as I thought I might not escape, a police car pulled up, lights flashing, and I rushed over to them desperate for their help. I frantically recounted everything, the coffins, the letters, the bizarre obsession, and Caitlyn’s maniacal chase. But instead of believing me, the officers chuckled under their breaths.

“Come on, man, Caitlyn Jenner? A hero and inspiration to millions?” one officer scoffed, shaking his head as he pulled out his notepad. They didn’t take me seriously at all, even asking Caitlyn for an autograph while she grinned proudly, basking in the attention. When they finally decided to arrest me for disturbing the peace, I stood there in disbelief, feeling utterly powerless as they treated me like the madman instead of the victim. My heart sank as they led me away, Caitlyn’s laughter ringing in my ears, a twisted reminder of how completely my life had spiraled out of control.

Even after my release, Caitlyn’s shadow looms over me. She sends letters that arrive daily, filled with admiration and veiled threats. I can’t shake the feeling of being watched. Each day is a new nightmare, and I’m terrified of what’s next.
