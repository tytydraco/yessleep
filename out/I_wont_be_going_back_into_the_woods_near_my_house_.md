Here is my recollection of some events that transpired in the woods near my house when I was a kid back in 5th or 6th grade. It seems around the time after it happened my brain sort of forced me to forget exactly when it all transpired. You could relate it to when you experience some trauma as a kid and your brain tries to make you forget.

*Going back to type this as I forgot before, but this all happened in southeastern US and in the springtime so imagine that classic southeastern forest look for our woods*

   So first of all, I apologize in advance. As I’m not a good writer, I think my best work was my 11th grade English paper on “And then there were none” by Agatha Christie. It was my favorite book I *had* to read but I digress. 

   To start, this story involves myself and my neighbor who is also my best friend, still to this day. As to not out either of us I’ll refer to him as “R”. 
   R and I would spend lots of time in the woods together, exploring, mapping out the woods, and playing air soft. I can’t lie, the woods were the perfect place to play air soft, as there were two dried up creek beds opposing each other about 100 yards between them which made for great bunkers. 

There were two entrances to the woods, imagine two parallel streets of houses going down a hill, and at the bottom there were two cul de sacs each with its own entrance to the woods. The right side street (which was inconveniently not the street we lived on) had the entrance to woods closest to the air soft area and where we mainly explored.

The entrance to the woods on our street was a little harder to access, and required us to make bigger jumps across the creek to get to and from. We had barely explored on that side since we never really found anything cool (old tree forts, etc.). But one day my dad and I were clearing out some of his old ARMY gear from Iraq, kinda sorting through what he wanted to give to me, keep, and get rid of. So after that I ended up with a shemagh and a tritium compass. 

   After receiving that compass, 12(ish) year old me apparently had a newfound love for cartography and I wanted to map the woods, with the help of R of course. 
So we started out mapping the right area of the woods, the two trenches were we spent our time airsofting, building forts and trying to jump as far as possible across the creek.
Even though it was a poor map and I could’ve spent 2 minutes on google earth and printed out something much better to start with, I was proud of it. So time passed and we kept adding to the map and moving further and further left to the woods, just about inline with the cul de sac of our street. 
We went about 1/8th of a mile further left which for simplicity sake is South. Then we started West which would be further into the woods. 

   We passed a couple of poorly constructed bridges made by other kids our age and hopped across the creek and kept going on and on and on. It started to get dark in the woods about 30-45 minutes after we started our trek so we decided to head back home. As previously stated there was nothing of interest out that way in the woods so it was hard to establish a good POI besides certain jumps we had to make over the creek. But either way we clearly knew the route we took and where it led, we just kept following the creek west. As it turns out time is pretty linear and 30 minutes later we end up back at the entrance to the woods. At our cul de sac. So we split ways, headed back to our houses and called it a night. 

   A couple days later I decided to look on Google earth and saw that if we had gone just a little bit further we would have ended up at a main road, the thought of venturing that far sounded cool to me, so relayed the new found info over to R and he agreed it would be a good goal to try and reach the main road. Not long after this we were able to meet up again around the same time of day as we had before, and start back into the woods, unfortunately with a much different outcome. 

   Our trek into the woods started like normal, jumping over the creek at the same places, retracing our steps and following the compass directly west as we had before. We were around 20 minutes into our little expedition and couldn’t contain our excitement of where we would end up. We jumped over the creek at the same spots and passed the same poorly constructed bridges that we passed before we turned back the first time. 40 minutes in we were starting to get a little worn out and definitely discouraged that we hadn’t found the main road yet, but assumed we had just been slower than we were previously so we persisted, still following our compass directly west. 

   I apologize again for my poor writing skills, and I will try my best to explain everything as best as I can. 

If I remember right a little over an hour had passed and we still hadn’t found the road so we decided to stop where we were and try and familiarize ourselves with our surroundings in case we had gotten turned around, even though we had followed the compass perfectly. After assuming we had to be less than 10 minutes away from the road we carried on again but just minutes in we found ourselves surrounded by what I now know are Aspen trees, and if you know anything about trees (which I didn’t) aspen trees are not native to the southeast. It’s like the scenery had changed in an instant, and looking around everything was different. Aspen trees in every direction, and what’s even more odd, the leaves were a reddish-yellow fall color, not what you would see in springtime. We were kids and were none the wiser so we persisted, and eventually found ourselves facing a pond. But it wasn’t a normal pond, it was perfectly level with the ground we were standing on no discernible bank or edge to it. It just meshed perfectly with the earth, it was covered with the red yellow leaves. The outline of the water between the leaves was completely black, and the water was still, like it had never been disturbed. I remember touching the toe of my shoe into the water to try and find the bottom, and moved the leaves out of the way, the leaves moved but the surface tension of the water never broke, the stillness unfaltering. As the outline of the water had hinted at before the water was truly black, like that new super black paint you’ve seen on social media, and I could see no bottom. 

It wasn’t long after this I started feeling uneasy, something just didn’t seem as it should. R must’ve had the same feeling as he said to me that he felt as if something was watching us, which didn’t help to calm my nerves whatsoever. We both began to take a second and observe our surroundings more carefully, and my best description of the sky was a pure white, like paper white, no sky blue and no clouds. Just a complete paper white visible through the remaining leaves on the trees. Then out of nowhere we heard the supersonic crack of what you’d normally relate to gunfire, but it didn’t subside immediately after like it normally would. It persisted, a constant noise louder than we could bear, a constant pressure on our heads. We knew we needed to run, I pulled out the compass once more, found east and darted in that direction, pushing through the brush of the woods and within 30 seconds we were back in the normal southeastern woodland, but that didn’t matter. We ran as fast as our legs could take us, I remember getting caught on some brambles and the dread that swept over me was immense, it felt as if the brambles were keeping me from freedom, and being caught for any longer would ensure my death. I eventually managed to break free and upon looking up after freeing myself we were in very familiar territory, right in front of one of the jumps over the creek we had made not even 5 minutes into our trip. Somehow we had ran what previously took up over an hour in just minutes. 

We made our way out of the woods and up the street to our houses. Not saying a word. 

It was years later we brought it up to each other and had almost the exact same recollection of events, except where I saw a plain white sky, R saw the same white sky but after hearing the deafening noise saw that the sky opened with hundreds of eyes all blinking. I can’t confirm this as I didn’t see it myself, but nor was I looking at the sky after the noise rang out.

What inspired me to write about this is I came across a photo on the internet of what I now know as Aspen trees and sent it to R, even more years after we spoke about what happened. 

I sent no caption, no explanation to the picture. To see if he truly remembered the same thing as I. 

He responded. 

“I remember”
