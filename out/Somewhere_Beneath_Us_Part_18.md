My eyes shot open, and I looked up at the ceiling with a sigh. I checked my watch; 2:46 am. Nearly two hours of sleep. That was a new record. Still, I knew that there wasn't going to be much more than that tonight. I slowly sat up and began to make my way to the door, then ducked into the hall without a sound. The bodies were already at the window looking at me, Hillary front and center beckoning eagerly. They had been a lot more active since the stunt I had pulled. The more I watched them, the sicker I felt, so I crept toward the end of the hall and slouched into the corner facing the kitchen. Not a moment after I sat, I heard the door to the bedroom open, and Bea stepped out. She walked over and stood before me.

"What are you doing?" She asked plainly.

"I couldn't sleep, and I was getting really sick of looking at that ceiling." She nodded then took a seat next to me. I shook my head, "Bea, you should go back to sleep. It's been two weeks. I'm fine now, I promise. You shouldn't have to stay up every night and babysit me."

"I don't have to; I want to."

"Bea…"

"You know, I thought you were doing this same exact thing the night you went out there. Just trying to be alone or something. I wasn't even going to come out and check because I knew you wouldn't want me bothering you." I looked to the floor in guilt. "But for some reason, I felt like I really needed to check. I just had this feeling that something wasn't right."

"I'm sorry, Bea. You have no idea how much I regret even thinking about it."

She began to pick at frayed bits of the indestructible carpet, fully aware she wouldn't be able to tear them out. "It's okay. I'm not mad, Joel. I mean, I was a little at first. I was upset that you were just going to leave us like that, but I know you were hurting a lot. I know what it feels like to think that's the only way out." I looked at her with concern, and she shrugged. "There comes a point so low that it really does seem like an escape. But what gets to me is that you weren't alone, Joel. You have us. You know that, right? I know we aren't as close to you as Andi, but-"

"Whoa, Bea…" I said, placing a hand over her fidgeting fingers. "You don't really think that, do you? Of course, I loved Andi, but that doesn't mean I love you all any less." She didn't say anything or make eye contact, just curled her fingers into her palm. "I didn't feel like I lost everything when she left. I know that I still have you all. That's not why I did it. I don't know, I guess… I guess I was just tired of losing people in general."

"What do you mean? Like in the house?"

I shook my head. "No, what happened to Hillary and Matt and the nameless man was awful, but I never really knew them. I just mean in my life. Before all of this, I had a tendency to lose people. Some people died, and some just left, but they were all gone somehow in the end. The worst part was that it was usually my own fault somehow. After a while, I started to think that I was just cursed. I guess I still do. Cursed to lose the people around me."

"You don't really think that Andi was your fault, do you?"

"I don't think. I know." I said plainly, staring at the door behind the pantry. "I told her we would go, Bea. Together. I told her that we would sneak away and find it, but then I changed my mind. I put the idea in her head to go, and she counted on me to, but I let her down. She had to go alone because I wouldn't have let her otherwise. I was so scared that I would lose her down there, but… I guess I lost her anyways." Bea looked at me intensely, several emotions swirling within her. "When she left, that was the last straw. I debated it for a while. That's all I did while I lay in the bedroom the past few months. Ultimately, I decided that the only way to stop losing people was to eliminate the main problem altogether. I thought you guys would be better off without me… That in the long run, I was making the right decision for everyone."

After a long beat of silence, Bea spoke again in a gentle tone, "Joel, that's really dumb."

I laughed softly at her bluntness, "I know. But it didn't seem like it at the time. I'm poison, Bea. I hurt people just by being around them."

"That's not true. We all hurt each other, Joel. That's just how humans are. Andi leaving wasn't on you. You may have given her the idea, but it was ultimately her choice to go."

"People always told me a similar thing about Rose." I mutter

"Who's Rose?"

"Just another person I lost."

Bea sensed the grim nature of my comment and resumed her game of picking at the floor. I realized that I was being a jerk right now. She was scared and just trying to help me.

"Thank you, by the way."

She looked up at me quizzically.

"For saving me. I never thanked you. I'm really glad you stopped me. And I'm sorry that I haven't been there for you lately. I know you're hurting just as much as I am."

She shook her head, "You're here now. That's all I care about."

"And I'm here to stay. I promise."

I leaned over and wrapped my arms around her, and she did the same in return. After a moment locked in embrace, she stood up, attempting to lift me with her. "Come back to bed."

"Bea…"

"Please, Joel?"

I sighed and stood, and together we crept back into the bedroom. We lay back into our piles of sheets, where I began staring up at my favorite site, old 70s ceiling tiles. However, after a moment, I heard Bea shift next to me and felt her warmth press up against me.

I leaned in close to her, "It's alright, Bea. I told you I'm not going anywhere." I whispered.

"I know." She muttered back, "But you seemed to sleep better those nights I was laying with you."

My heart began to thump fast at her words, but eventually, I started to relax. She must have been right because, after a few minutes, I felt myself drift off to the sounds of her gentle breathing.

&#x200B;

"Joel…" A soft voice muttered next to me.

My body ached, and pain still rippled from the socket that my arm once rested in. I didn't want to open my eyes. If I kept them closed, I thought I wouldn't have to face whatever fate I now found myself in.

"Joel, wake up." It was Ethan. He was whispering, though, and his voice wavered with the familiar tone of fear. Around me, a sound echoed that I hadn't heard in a while. Music.

*"In a little café, just the other side of the border…"*

I opened my eyes and propped myself up on my one good arm, inspecting the room that we now found ourselves in. I was perplexed to see natural, organic boulders surrounding us. Beneath us as well. The entire floor was made out of cold, rugged stone that stretched around the area in the kind of formation one might see in the wild. In the distance, I could see the rock blended into a grassy plain that stretched off far into the horizon, where it met a perfect blue sky. Wait, what? That couldn't be right…

*"She was just sitting there givin' me looks that made my mouth water…"*

I blinked my eyes and tried again. It turned out that my vision hadn't entirely failed me. That was indeed what I was looking at; however, it wasn't an actual field, just an image painted onto a flat surface. I circled the area again, trying to make sense of what I was looking at when the large glass wall behind me tied it all together. We were in some sort of zoo exhibit, although it appeared that we were currently on the wrong side of the glass.

"*So I started walking her way. She belonged to bad man Jose…"*

I felt Ethan's hand rest gently on my shoulder, so I turned to look up at him. His expression was that of pure fear as he slowly turned and pointed up to the edge of the exhibit. Up at the top of the wall where several heat lamps radiated down onto us, the Curator sat hunched, watching intently. I climbed to my feet and clutched my arm, preparing for the worse. It had worked. It had taken us down into the house. But what came next was entirely a mystery.

*"And I knew, yes I knew I should leave when I heard her say…"*

It pounced down from the ledge and began to crawl toward us. Ethan and I simultaneously backed up in unison until our backs ran up against a rock, preventing us from moving any further. The creature crawled so close to us that I could hear its breathing, raspy and choked. We watched as it raised a hand to part of its chest where a tumor lay beneath its skin, then dug a finger under the patch. It pulled it back with a sickening tearing noise, and from beneath the fold, out fell a bag of old Hostess doughnuts. It pushed them toward us, patted the skin back down from where it had been keeping them, then played a few notes on its xylophone before turning and scurrying back up the wall. Ethan and I stood with our mouths open wide in horror and shock, staring down at the package of pastries before us.

*"Come a little bit closer, you're my kind of man, so big and so strong…."*

"You don't think that's where all our food came from, do you?"

"I don't want to think about it."

Behind the exhibit's glass, I could see the creature from downstairs drop into the spectator zone. The area was absolutely filled to the brim with junk and random objects; computer chairs, fans, toys, briefcases. On top of a nearby pile, I noticed that the creature had stripped our backpacks from us and added them to the heap. Opposite from our window and across the way, Ethan and I could see two other displays looking into more exhibits. I stepped closer in an attempt to get a better look. One of them just had more garbage crammed into it, while the other one was deeply upsetting. Its windows were covered by blankets and tarps and smeared on the glass in sloppy handwriting, written in a cracked burgundy substance, were the words, *'BAD PETS*'. Above the wall, I could see swarms of flies hovering above the exhibit.

*"Come a little bit closer, I'm all alone, and the night is so long…."*

The curator shambled through its mess toward a boombox that was currently blaring the music and gently traced a bony finger over the surface, struggling with the machine. After a moment, however, the volume raised up, and it seemed content. It then crossed over to a nearby pile and began to tear back more patches of its skin, shaking loose items that it had stuffed underneath and adding them to its hoard. Ethan and I watched, transfixed by the grotesque sight when we heard the scuff of a footstep behind us. We turned around just in time to see a figure duck behind one of the rocks. My heart instantly doubled its pace from what it was already at.

*"So we started to dance. In my arms, she felt so inviting…"*

"Hello?" I called out in a hushed tone. I wanted to make it known to whatever was hiding that we knew it was there, but I didn't want to draw any attention from the Curator. "Is someone there?" I heard the figure adjust their footing behind the stone, but they didn't answer. Concerned, I looked to Ethan. He pointed to me, then to the rock, then made the motion of two people sneaking to either side. I wasn't in any shape to fight, neither of us were, but I figured that if this thing was hiding, then it probably wasn't looking for trouble to begin with. The best we could do was get the jump on it. Slowly, we started moving forward, using the music to cover our steps.

*"And I just couldn't resist just one little kiss, so exciting…"*

We reached the face of the boulder then nodded to one another. At the same time, we leapt around the rock and stood poised, ready for retaliation. To our surprise, though, the creature before us cowered down in shock. It was a woman, maybe in her thirties, with frazzled hair and tired eyes. She looked at Ethan and me in fear and raised her hands to guard her face. Once Ethan and I registered what we were looking at, the both of us eased out of our stances.

*"Then I heard the guitar player say, 'Vamos, Jose's on his way….'"*

"Whoa, hey," Ethan said in a reassuring tone, "We won't hurt you! I'm sorry to startle you." She lowered her hands and looked at us.

"We thought you might be something less friendly," I added. "Are you okay?"

The woman sat up from the ground and nodded, then asked, "A-are you real?"

Ethan and I looked at one another, "Um, yes, we are…." He looked at me and then muttered, "Joel, what if this is that thing? The one who took Bea? It can look like anyone, right?"

He had a point. If we had just found a way around its plan to strand us back at the top of the house, it would undoubtedly come looking for us again. However, what the woman said next caught me off guard.

*"And I knew, yes, I knew I should run, but then I heard her say, yeah…"*

"N-no! I'm not. You mean the one that moves through the walls, right? It doesn't ever come in here. I think it's afraid of the Curator for some reason."

There were several things that she had just said that warranted more explanation, but there was one thing in particular that caught my attention.

"The Curator? You call it that too, huh?" I thought it was a little too suspicious she knew the exact same name we did and hoped to catch her on the detail. Even if we did, though, I really had no plan of action to follow. We didn't stand a chance either way if it really was the house in corporeal form.

She looked puzzled as she spoke, "Um, yes, I do. I'm one of the people who named it that."

*"Come a little bit closer, you're my kind of man, so big and so strong…."*

I turned the sentence over in my head a few times before the revelation hit me like a ton of bricks,

"Wait, named it? Does that mean… You were part of the group that left the notes behind in the house."

The woman looked shyly to the floor, as if the recognition bothered her, "I um, yes. Me and my friends, yes."

"Oh my goodness," Ethan said, "How long have you been down here, then?"

She grabbed a lock of her hair and gently tugged on it as she thought, "Oh, no, um, I'm not sure. It's hard to remember without a clock. Time just kind of blends together down here. I got here in… and we left around… Maybe twelve? thirteen years?"

"Holy crap," Ethan muttered.

*"Come a little bit closer, I'm all alone, and the night is so long…."*

"And you've been with the curator the whole time?" I asked.

"No, just the house. My time here has been about half that."

"That's still so much. I'm so sorry."

The woman nodded but didn't respond. Knowing her situation now, it was clear why she seemed so distant and socially inept. Who knew when the last time she had even seen another person was? As the song's bridge filled the area with an overwhelming swell of instruments, we all shifted glances in silence. I could tell that she was very uncomfortable, so I stuck my hand out to her to help her off the floor. She looked at it for a moment, hesitant, before finally taking it. As I pulled her to her feet, I smiled at her.

"I'm Joel, by the way. This is my friend Ethan."

She made an attempt to smile back, "My name is Alice. It's very nice to meet you both."

*"Then the music stopped. When I looked, the café was empty…"*

As she brushed herself off and began tidying up her clothes, as if trying to look less disheveled, she continued, "Joel… Something about that name sounds familiar. Maybe there was someone in my group that had the same name?" She looked suddenly saddened at the thought of people she once knew.

"You know," I said, hoping to cheer her up, "All of the notes and supplies that you guys left helped us out more than you know. We wouldn't be here if it weren't for you. Even the name you gave that thing helped us get down here." I said, pointing to the creature who was still rummaging through its 'treasures'.

Alice seemed to be slightly uplifted by the comment, but she looked more taken back than anything,

"Helped you get down here? Did you purposely get caught?"

Ethan nodded, "It's a long, long story, but we have a friend; she's somewhere down here. That thing in the walls moved us back to the top, and we needed a way down quickly. She's hurt, and we need to get to her fast."

*"Then I heard Jose say, 'Man, you know you're in trouble plenty.'"*

Alice gave us a concerned look, "Oh, no… I'm terribly sorry, but that may not have been the best idea. There isn't really- I mean, you can't very easily… You belong to him now." She said, pointing to the curator, "And he keeps a very close eye on us. Even if there was a way out of this place, he'd certainly catch you before you could escape."

My heart sank a bit at my stupidity. How had I not thought ahead more? What did I think would happen once it took us back to its home?

"What happens if someone tries to leave, and it catches them? Wouldn't it just put us back in here?" I asked, fairly sure I already knew the answer was no.

Alice shook her head, then pointed through the glass and across to the other window.

*'BAD PETS'*

*"So I dropped my drink from my hand, and out through the window I ran…"*

The woman could clearly tell that we were upset by the new revelation, and I could sense when she tried to change the subject.

"Oh my, your arm, it's hurt."

"Huh?" I said, the numbness of another defeat almost making me forget about the pain in my shoulder. "Oh, It's nothing. I'll be okay."

"No, it's dislocated," Alice said, gently brushing her hand against it. It tingled with needles of pain at her touch, "Sit down. I can fix it."

I looked at her skeptically. She was very kind so far, and I felt horrible for her situation, but I had hardly even known her for two minutes, and I wasn't too keen on a stranger trying to pry my arm back into place.

"Alice, for real, it's okay, I promise."

"It's only going to get worse the longer it's out. I was a med student before I got here. I don't know much, but I may be able to pop it back in."

*"And as I rode away, I could hear her say to Jose, yeah…"*

I stared at her, then to Ethan, then back to her, while all the while she looked directly at me with complete determination. She really did want to help.

"Okay," I said, lowering myself to the ground slowly, my joints aching with every movement. "Go ahead."

Alice nodded, then crouched down behind me and began tracing my shoulder blade with her fingers. Meanwhile, Ethan knelt in front of me and pulled off his belt.

I raised my eyebrow at him, "Whaddya' doing, buddy?"

"Here." He said, handing it to me. "I can't imagine it's going to feel good. Might want to bite down on something. I know I would have liked to when I hurt my arm." He jabbed with a smirk.

"Oh, boo-hoo." I chuckled back, taking the strap. "Thanks." I placed it into my mouth and sank my teeth into the leather. I felt Alice begin to put pressure on my back as well as grab the disjointed shoulder. The pain from the slight touch alone was already a lot. I didn't want to imagine what I was about to feel when it went back in.

*"Come a little bit closer, you're my kind of man, so big and so strong…"*

"Are you ready?" Alice asked from behind. I nodded. "Alright then. Here we go. One… Two…"

As she counted down and the dread mounted in my chest, I looked over to the Curator to see that it was intensely staring with its head cocked. It never had expressions, but I could somehow sense that it didn't like what was happening. I went to call out and stop Alice, but before I could-

*Crack!*

&#x200B;

"It's so nice to see you out and interacting again, Joel," Grace told me with a warm smile.

"I know." Claire added, "We were really worried about you. Draw two, Grace."

"You two don't have to worry about me, ladies. I just needed a lot of time to think about everything." I reassured as I placed down a blue four. "It really is nice to be back out, though."

"Are you feeling better now, dear?"

"Yeah. A lot better."

"Well, good. We're always here for you if you need to talk, you know. All of us are."

"I know, thank you. Sorry I wasn't really there for you all the past few months."

"Don't worry, sweetie. We know how much Andi meant to you. It's understandable that you needed time to yourself. The new color is red."

"It's still going to be pretty rough going forward. This house just isn't the same without her."

"It never is when you lose someone you love, unfortunately. It just takes time. That's why it's so important that we all be there for one other. We have to make sure all that healing is as painless as possible. Do you know what I mean, dear?"

"Yeah," I said, peering past Grace and into the sunroom to Bea. She was reading a book while leaning against the wall, and as she turned the page, she caught my eye and gave me a warm smile. "I know exactly what you mean."

*"Come a little bit closer, I'm all alone, and the night is so long…."*
