I wasn't going to make another post, but I don't know what else to do. I have no one else I can tell these things without being called crazy, or god forbid, the people close to me think I am just making things up. My life continues to go downhill. I have been having nightmares for a few days now in which I see the creature that was protecting the barn. In these interludes, the twisted face hovered just inches above mine while I lay paralyzed, my heart beating hard in my throat. I wake up sweating and hyperventilating, my fingers trembling.

I usually can't go back to sleep afterward, and have stopped trying, instead brewing a pot of coffee and getting my day started. To be fair, the extra time has been nice and given me the opportunity to get my patry and refrigerator restocked. In the last few days, however, the lack of sleep was catching up to me. It was starting to effect my performance at work.I made my first major mistake last week. I had apparently forgotten to put out the wet floor sign, and one of my co-workers slipped. Fortunately, they weren't seriously hurt.

I still got chewed out, though. I also would have been liable if the injury would have been more serious. That didn't seem to sink in however because I screwed up again yesterday, and this time a rack of product was destroyed. Again, no one was hurt. I was sitting at the table after one of the nightly episodes, listening to the sound of the machine on the countertop, the aroma of the caffeinated water reaching my nose, lifting some of the fog from my brain. The first cup helped to open my eyes a little further.

I had a few errands to run before I clocked in. I did what needed to be done, and went out for a late breakfast, tucking myself into the back corner of the diner as far from other people as I could. I didn't even really want to interact with the hostess or server though I had to. I barely tasted my food as I chewed and swallowed it. Things were starting to seem very strange to me, almost surreal, no matter how mundane the scene in front of me was. I blame it on sleep deprivation, because even as I type this I am unsure if I am dreaming. Maybe I am just a little drunk.

On top of my personal life crumbling around me, I have been getting the feeling that I am being watched. It started a few days ago, while I was outside, cleaning out the gutters during a brief respite from the rain. I glanced around from my vantage point on the ladder, but saw nothing suspicious, just people going about their daily lives. I walked back inside, but the feeling didn't subside. I felt uncomfortable and unsafe in my own home until I left for work. I barely remember making it through my shift, my brain fuzzy and buzzing from lack of sleep and paranoia.

As soon as I got home, I crawled into the bottle, barely paying attention to the movie I had turned on. I glanced around, lamenting the lack of decorations that I had put up even though at this point it was only a few days before Christmas. The feeling didn't motivate me to do anything more than drink more. I passed out on the couch, and wasn't quite awake when my brain registered the sound of something scraping over the side of my apartment. I sat up quickly, my head spinning quickly from the alcohol still circulating my bloodstream.

I glanced toward the front door, holding my breath and half expecting the knob to begin to turn. It didn't and after a while, my heartbeat slowed and my brain began to rationalize things. I started to feel silly, and as I stood, I glanced toward the window. I saw a flicker of movement there, and was positive I hadn't imagined it, and against every instinct, I moved in that direction. When I looked through the curtains, I saw nothing unusual. I again mentally chastised myself. I was allowing my mind to play tricks on me, and I was embarrassed even though I was alone.

I stumbled my way to the bed and collapsed into it, letting my eyes close again. This time it was dreams of the twisted, shadowy figure with the glowing eyes that woke me. This time I was far more clear headed and the sun was beginning to come up. I shaved and showered, then got dressed. I went out to send off some bill payments, and stopped at a small coffee shop on a whim. I ordered my drink and turned to walk to a table, bumping into another patron.

“I'm sorry. Excuse me.” I proclaimed meekly.

“It's okay.” the stranger said, and when I looked up and met his eyes, I was immediately flushed.

This man was beautiful. He had clear skin and large brown eyes situated above a set of cupid-bow lips. I stammered and moved out of his way, waiting for the barista to call my name. He stranger I had bumped into approached me after a few minutes. I felt myself flush again. He didn't say anything, and even smiled when the young girl behind the counter called my name. I noticed because I couldn't stop peeking at him from the corner of my eye. I went to work without returning home and found myself thinking about the encounter throughout the day.

As if I had manifested him, the man with the brown eyes came to my place of work.

“Hello again.” he said with a slight smile when our eyes met.

“How are you?” I replied, still slightly distracted with what I was doing.

“Doing fine, and yourself?” the stranger prodded, lingering near me.

“Living the dream.” I joked, though I began to wonder if the man had followed me here, after seeing my name tag at the coffee shop.

The paranoia I had been feeling for the past few days re-emerged suddenly and I felt a panic attack coming on. I didn't even excuse myself, just walked away quickly, feet carrying me into the break room. I closed the door behind me and sat on the couch, trying not to give in to the lightheaded feeling that was coming over me. I lost that battle, lost in blackness, and being stalked by those glowing eyes and when I came to, there were a few concerned faces hovering over me, one of them belonging to my boss.

“Are you okay?” Scott asked, the concern still evident in his face.

“I think so, yeah.” I tried to assure him, but to be honest, I still felt a little bit off.

“We called the ambulance. I need you to stay put until they get here.” he told me.

“Whatever you say.” I agreed. I didn't feel like standing anyway.

The man and woman in the uniform arrived and gave me a quick but thorough once over, giving me the all clear to go back to work, though I was told to go the hospital at the first sign of a headache as I had apparently hit my head on the floor. I flt the knot on the back of my scalp, and it was still tender, but at least it didn't seem to have split. My hair wasn't matted and I didn't feel a wound in my gentle prodding. I eventually made my way back out to the floor, and to my relief, the stranger was gone. I went about the rest of the day without incident.

Before I left, Scott caught up with me.

“I need to see you in my office for a minute.” he said.

I nodded and followed him. When we got inside, he motioned for the chair almost directly in front of me. I sat down and he let out a long breath that wasn't quite a sigh.

“I think you need to take some time off. Unfortunately we can't pay you, but we have already started an unemployment claim for you.” he told me in his gentlest voice.

I didn't argue, I just stood up and left. I went home and immediately poured myself a drink. I didn't eat anything that night. Christmas came and went, but I was just going through the motions. My mother and father tried to make me laugh, but it didn't work. I felt myself slipping further into despair. I had lost everything, and even my sleep was being taken from me by the terrible dreams I was having nightly. I started drinking as soon as I got home once again. After a few drinks, I began to feel hot, the air in my apartment drier than it should have been.

I walked through the front door and outside, letting the cool night air sink through my somewhat damp clothing, the moisture on my skin almost immediately turning ice cold. My breath hung in front of my lips in a faint vapor cloud, but it all felt so good. The frigid air seemed to soothe the heat inside me, and I was glad for that. I was turning to walk back inside when I saw a figure standing beneath a streetlight. To my relief, they were normally proportioned, but seemed to be waring dark clothing.

'Probably just one of the neighbors.' I thought as I walked back into my home.

I tried to cling to that thought, but before long, I found myself walking around, checking the window locks and closing the blinds. The paranoid feeling that had overwhelmed me earlier started to return. Before I could spiral completely out of control I used my phone to look for things to help anxiety. One of the first results was to take a walk. I decided that I would do just that, putting on a heavy jacket and gloves before I left this time. I pulled the hood up over my head and glanced both ways down the street.

This time I was the only person outside. I started walking toward a gas station a few blocks away. When I got there, I went inside, and started moving toward the cooler to claim a bottle of iced tea, and froze when I saw the stranger from the coffee shop standing in one of the aisles. I should have left, but I couldn't get my feet to move. He looked my way.

“Fancy meeting you here.” the stranger said, his lips curling up in a smile.

“Yeah, hi.” I replied without thinking, though the words were awkward and clipped.

“I feel like I should introduce myself at this point.” the handsome man joked, trying to break the tension that had formed in the room.

“If you insist.” I said in return, the creepy feeling once again fading as he moved around the small table with discounted candy sitting on top of it. We shook hands and once again when our eyes met, I felt my face flush.

“My name's Jeff.” he said, his smile growing a bit when he noticed that I was blushing.

I told him my name as well, and we both paid for our items and we left the store together. Even though it was late, I was happy for the company.

“Do you want to walk me home?” I asked, without intending to. The words fell out of my mouth before the thought was complete in my brain.

“How far is it?” he enquired with a quick glance at the watch on his wrist.

“A few blocks.” I told him, and he nodded.

When we got to the apartment complex, he accompanied me to my door.

“Come in.” I invited, hoping that having someone around would quell my nightmares.

When we got into the place, I went straight to the linen closet and got him a blanket and pillow, placing those on the couch. He smiled and I felt a flutter of butterflies in my stomach. He patted the sofa next to himself, and I felt my cheeks grow hot again as I moved to sit next to him.

“I know it's late, or well, early in the morning, but do you think we could have one drink?” Jeff requested.

I shrugged, and retorted, “I guess there's no harm in it. You like whiskey?”

“It'll do.” he nodded.

I started to stand to go get the bottle but he insisted on doing it for me. A little bit of my earlier paranoia returned and so I followed him, pointing to the cupboard where the bottle was and then the shot glasses. He poured a measure of the brown liquor into one of the small glasses for each of us. I made sure to watch his hands carefully, but as far as I could tell, he hadn't slipped me anything. There was no strange cloudiness or bubbles in the whiskey, so I drank it. Then we had another. Then another. Before I really comprehended what was happening we were in bed together. After we finished and got cleaned up, I laid next to Jeff, and as I drifted to sleep, I thought I saw his eyes glowing.

I woke up long after noon had passed. I was alone. I sat up slowly, and looked around, my brain dragging a little bit. There was no sign that Jeff had been there at all. The blanket and pillow I had placed on the couch was back in the linen closet, and there was one shot glass sitting in the dish drainer. I shook my head and moved to the bathroom, taking a long shower. I toweled off and got dressed, then drove to the grocery store. I began to feel as if I was being watched again. I developed tunnel vision and my head spun.

I tried to hurry toward the bathroom, but didn't make it, as far as I know. I woke up in the back of an ambulance, and as the doors closed, I swore I saw Jeff's face in the crowd of concerned faces of the employees and other customers. His lips were turned up in a familiar smile and his usually brown eyes seemed to smolder with amber light. When I got to the hospital, I was diagnosed with a severe concussion and released after a few hours. I tried to call Terry to tell him about my fainting spells, but he didn't answer.

I woke a couple of days ago to knocking at my door. A man in a delivery uniform stood there, and handed me a small flower arrangement. The small card said get well soon but there was no sender. That's when I saw Jeff walking around the corner away from my house. I didn't chase him, but I am going to confront him the next time we meet.
