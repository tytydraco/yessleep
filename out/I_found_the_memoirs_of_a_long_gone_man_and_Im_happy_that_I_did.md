A few hours ago, I saw a dream that will change me forever, and I have to share this with someone. But before I tell you, I need to explain the events beforehand for it to make sense.

I'm a history nerd who spends most of his time reading books in the city library and boasts about it to his only friend who could care less about it. Due to the negligence of my parents during my childhood, I read books in my solitude. I found history books engaging and the information I learned enlightened me. No longer I was a fool who reveled in his misery and found a way to feel superior to others. Call me whatever you want, but I don’t care, I have to cope with something. I picked history to major in university for this reason.

Two days ago, I went to the university as usual, and because of a local holiday, people left the school early. I went to the school's library and found it mostly empty. I woke up the library from its sleep with the echoes from my steps. Even I didn't expect it to be this silent, however. The worker greeted me, and we had a short chat as usual. She had been placing books back in their place since morning, so I didn't want to bother her any further.

I gave back the book I loaned a week ago and strolled into the library to find another book to read. I had to finish one book for a week, I made it a habit since high school, and each time I missed my goal, I'd gnaw my nails from anxiety. I got annoyed after 15 minutes of meandering around in the library and walked upon a random bookshelf. I closed my eyes and grabbed a random book from the shelf.

Excited, I opened my eyes to witness an abnormality on my hands. The pages of this "book" barely held onto each other and I had to be very careful not to spill the pages on the ground. The pages didn't leave a good impression either, it looked like someone dropped the book in a bucket of coffee and left it in their attic for centuries. It didn't have a name or any mark on its cover to guess it without opening it. The pages, however, made my skin crawl.

The smooth texture of the pages gave me the impression that several animals got skinned for it, and I found out why from the first page of the book. The Classical Latin must've been the norm of its time. I paid attention to my classes so I knew a bit of it, but it would take me some time to translate it.

“A couple of months passed since I experienced the cold nights of Lugdunum. In his infinite glory, Caesar is mopping up the last rebellious tribes in the north of Gaul. The tales of his heroic deeds warm the soul of his countrymen. Here, we're making sure that the barbarians don't get any weird ideas. It'll take some time before the administration plants its roots here. I don't see us leaving anytime soon. No particular event or person caught my interest as of now other than some senseless and rebellious whispers. I'll stop writing until something interesting happens. The light of civilization will endure, and I'll do my part to ensure its continuation.”

“Something particularly bothered me today.

As I was going to my quarter after dinner with the governor, I stumbled upon a mad individual on the town square, agitating the already uneasy residents. I approached him to take a closer look and met with his dismal eyes. In his torn-off clothes and unkempt beard, he resembled a monster more than a human. Flailing and weeping, the man jumped where he stood and pointed at me in the crowd. Fearing the worst, I ordered soldiers to arrest this man and disperse the crowd. If this got out of hand, I would be the one in trouble.

In the meantime, we found a local who understood Latin and asked him to make sense of that lunatic's ravings. He didn't seem to be willing at first, but after I offered him some gold, he told us a harrowing tale. The man used to be the best herdsman in the town, but one day, he disappeared into the mountains to the east. He didn't come back until weeks later, in terrible shape and mood. The situation worsened, he'd disappear once in a while and come back, telling mortifying tales that sent chills down their spine.

That was enough for me, the sun faded long ago and I had to sleep to recollect my senses. I didn't want to believe it at first, but I couldn't think of anything against it either. Who knew what horrors laid beyond the mountains? I've never been the type to venture out of the cities, so these thoughts frightened me even further. I hope they'll send me to Illyria for my next assignment.”

The next page was indescribable, I tried to make sense of the words scattered around the simple yet alluring sketch. A tall, obsidian black statue erected at the top of a mountain, stick figures on their knees and others with their hands in the air. Did he see this in his dream, and try to put it on the paper? Another theory of mine was that he attended a local ritual, which he found amusing, and wanted to immortalize it by drawing it. I assumed I'd find out more about it by reading the memoir, which I did.

“The governor informed me of a lost expedition deep into the Helvetian mountains. He expected their arrival at Lugdunum a week ago, but they were yet to return. He sent people to check the nearby settlements in case they went to the wrong place, but that didn't bear fruit either. In desperation, he kindly asked us to enter the deep, lush forests of the east. I had no idea what waited for us beyond the horizon, we had incursions with the Helvetii tribes.

Still, I couldn't refuse a direct request from the governor in a time like this, it'd be a political suicide. Additionally, I hated people running away from duty and didn't wish to be one of those myself. Half-heartedly, I accepted his request and prepared to lead a searching party of sixteen soldiers. They had the insomnia-inducing nightmares like me, but after promising them extra money and unmatched glory, they folded one by one. Our swords unsheathed and shields repaired, we plunged deep into the darkness.”

“We traveled three days and three nights on the overgrown trails of Gallic forests. The wind picked up as we went past small settlements, and climbed up many hills to find a trace of the lost expedition. Our labor yielded no fruit, and we’re getting demoralized for a reason I’m not aware of. Some told me of a tall rock reaching the sky, like the one I saw in my dream, and others told me of beasts lurking in the depths of the alien forest. Even the most sanguine amongst us grew silent, anxious of the possibility that we may have angered the gods of this realm.”

“After seven nights of arduous march, we stumbled upon what remained of the expedition. Swords thrusted into trees and armor pieces filled the ground. Strange as it may seem, I realized that we would never find the group as if it swallowed the men whole. My heart pounded against my chest and cold sweat washed my face. Who’s to say it couldn’t happen to us as well? True, nobody could deny that.

It took eight painful minutes to reach that statue, but as I saw it on the horizon, I knew that it was the same stature as my dream. I estimated the figure to be two meters high, and the shining property of it proved to be obsidian. A cloth covered his face, with or without purpose by the sculptors. I could still feel the glare of the towering figure on me, however. As we departed from there, we found more and more of the same statues around the area. In time, it led us to an ancient city of great grandeur. A thick, greenish smog hovers around the city, and although some soldiers took a liking to this ghastly wasteland, I disagree. I didn’t try to think of the abandoned equipment around the area. We’ll spend the night a bit far off the entrance, and return by the morning.”

The next pages didn't help to my rising anxiety. It had ripped off pages or scribbled to the point I couldn't read anything. By this point, a cocktail of intrigue and fear grasped me, not willing to let it go until I quenched the burning desire for knowledge. I had to find what this man found in that forgotten place.

“Exactly seven days passed since that day, I got terrified to the point that I didn't dare to write a single sentence until now. Thanks to the Gods, the governor saw my miserable state and allowed me to meditate for a week, or until I got better. To be frank with you, my dear self, I don't know how you survived that day, but if this isn't proof that men will triumph over evil, then I don't know what is.

As we woke up from our troubled sleep, I noticed the absence of some soldiers. The worst came to my mind, and I felt the intense need to venture into that place. Whatever the cost would be, I would bring those men back. I ordered soldiers to be careful as we didn't know something or someone lived here. We advanced in formation, and to my amusement, found the missing soldiers cowering in fear. They joined the formation, and we analyzed this strange area. The buildings didn’t make sense, their geomery was inconsistent and the ratios of stones seemed to be without order. I also encountered tall stones with faces carved into them. Compared to the statues outside, these looked quite primitive.

We approached what I thought to be the city center, and discovered a massive hole that didn’t seem to have an end. I looked at the abyss with courage, but all it returned was the cold, encompassing darkness. I shrugged and ordered the soldiers to leave this place. I didn't have the means or the mental hardship to scout this place. What I thought to be a simple retreat turned into a calamity.

A tentacle spurred out of the hole and slammed itself into the buildings next to us. We avoided the incoming rocks with their shields, and I quivered from fear. I always thought that monsters only existed in fairy tales, yet one stood in front of me, challenging my understanding of the world. It slammed itself next to us again, catching some of the legionaries off guard. These would be the first casualties of this beast.

Seeing no way other than to fight, as I had no intention of dying here and leaving my soul in limbo forever, I ordered the archers to shoot the tentacle. That worked for a brief moment before they got quashed by the projectiles of a destroyed building, ruining all of my hopes for escape. I peeked at my soldiers and noticed the same devastation in their eyes. Before a total route took place, I came to the front and ordered the soldiers to throw their shields. I knew, somehow, that the next hit would land on us, and told them to hold their sword above their head. If it could somehow immobilize the beast, we would have a chance to escape here.

As it prepared to finish, tears rolled from my eyes, and I thought of my family back at home. I felt at peace for a moment, realizing that I lived a good life despite the hurdles, surrounding myself with people I enjoyed and a family I loved. Then I realized it. I wouldn't die here and let it all go to waste. I closed my eyes and entrusted myself to the Sol and its light. I\&mldr; no, we would prove to this foul being that it couldn't mess with men like its toys.

I opened my eyes and saw a ray of light piercing through the clouds. It landed on me, basking me in its purity. The monster hit us but got grave injuries, and retreated to where it deserved, the darkness.

I don’t remember the rest of the journey, but my men told me later that I fainted for a day. Even when I was awake, I seemed to be drowning in an ocean of thoughts until we came back. No words can explain the horror and the subsequent relief I felt back there.

Unfortunately, nobody seems to remember what happened there except me. My soldiers deny the tentacle, and the smog-filled city, claiming that I've been seeing things. Tch. Am I the only one who won’t get spared, and bear this burden for the rest of my life? Is this a curse, or a reward? I’ll never know, and it’s better that way.”

With that, I finished the memoir. By the end, I'd been through so many emotions that I couldn't even explain how I felt to myself. I didn't want to leave it here; it didn't belong to me for sure. Yet, in a twisted sense of selfishness, I wanted to explain this unheard account to someone, or at least use it for one of my homework. I slid it into my backpack and left the library as if I hadn't stolen an important piece of history. The sun disappeared beyond the clouds, and I pondered the man who defied his fate. Would a man like that ever come to this world again? Is that monster still here, lurking in the shadows? I got lost in my questions, and almost fell to a puddle.

My guilt became too much to handle, but the library would open in the morning. I put my backpack in a corner, and after a filling dinner, I went to sleep.

In the nightmare, I've been traversing in that same city he walked through. Ghoulish horrors peeked from the corners and the horrid air brought me to my knees. Trying to find an exit as fast as I could, I darted everywhere. Not only did I not find anything, but the city, and everything in it, closed up on me. The buildings leaned on me, and the walls crept up behind my back, defying the laws of physics in this barren realm. Everything felt so real at that moment like I'd never survive there. But the man, the writer, appeared with a shining sword in his right hand and gave me his other hand.

I woke up after crying a river and went to open my bag. I would apologize to the man by hugging his memoir. But the book wasn't there. I put it there with my own hands, though. How could such a thing happen?

So here I am, writing everything that came to my mind. Although I started quite disorganized, I calmed myself down as everything became clear. Even if I told this to my professor, he would laugh at my face, so I decided to write this on the internet. Someone might relate to the bizarre events that fell upon me in the last couple of days. May you be safe, and stand firm against the darkness.
