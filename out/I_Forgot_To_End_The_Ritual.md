This started as a joke. It was only supposed to be a joke.

I am a college student so I feel like I have the right to be curious about the world, you know? Like everything I'm doing can be overlooked and forgiven. It sounds stupid but I feel that way because I still feel like I am a kid.

You know how when you're a kid no matter what you do you will be forgiven at some point. I mean as long as you don't break the law your parents are the only people who hold any power over you. And they punish you by putting you in time out and just reprimanding you in a way where you will be okay in a day or two. Maybe some trauma but nothing too serious. Well this thought is what got me into this deep mess.

Last weekend my friends and I were coming home from a drinking party some college seniors threw to celebrate their last summer as a college student because they were all graduating in the winter. They were officially entering the workforce after December. I got invited simply because my apartment was off campus and my friends needed somewhere to crash after and I don't drink so I guess I was a chaperone as well.

We all got back to my apartment late and we were taking turns showering when one of my closer friends Julie told me she did a ritual last week in the bathtub. It was a ritual she heard from one of her friends where if you succeed you will be granted 7 days of insane luck, but exactly on the 7th night you have to end the ritual and cut ties with the "luck" or else bad luck will strike.

I just looked at Julie like she was stupid because this was stupid. I am a horror maniac and I always try dumb rituals. When I was 8 or 9 I played Bloody Mary countless times and nothing happened. Once I got older especially in college I did more daring ones like The Elevator Game, Hide and Seek, and most recently I did the Corner Game with my other horror maniac friends and sure enough nothing happened. So to say I was a believer was a long stretch.

But Julie never likes any of this stuff because both her parents have passed away from a freak accident that the police refuse to give information about and her house is right next to a morgue and cemetery. So she hates it when I talk about horror or ghosts. She feels as if she has a higher chance of encountering these "things" since she's so close to dead people.

So when she brought up this game I was a little confused since she looked dead serious. But she was also dumb drunk so I just decided to humor her and told her that we could do it tomorrow after she's not so drunk.

She just sat in her little green bean bag chair giggling. Everyone else was in either my room or my spare bedroom knocked out, so I was the only person seeing this, and I just sat there really confused on what to say.

Julie eventually gathered herself together sitting up and looked me dead in the eye. She no longer has the playful glint in her eyes when she jokes. Even the room fell silent, even though just seconds ago it was shaking with Julie's giggles.

"No listen. I am dead serious. I tried it myself last month." Julie said, falling back into the beanbag chair.

"You did what?" I whispered back, like I was trying to stop others from listening in on our conversation that just took a very eerie turn.

"I asked my friend how and I tried it. She said it was completely safe as long as I ended the ritual on the 7th night. It has to be exactly at 11:59pm. I did and everything turned out fine." She said staring up into my ceiling that was decorated with glow in the dark stickers in the shape of stars. I even used special colors to draw out the constellation of the big dipper and a few other ones.

"So what happens if you don't end the ritual exactly at 11:59pm?" I asked.

Julie had her eyes fixed on the ceiling not saying anything.

"I don't know. I didn't ask. I didn't want to know." Julie said calmly, closing her eyes this time.

" I was desperate." She muttered before falling silent again.

Not knowing how to respond I just sat there in silence with her.

I opened my mouth to ask her another question and before I could get a word out a low snore floated across the room.

I heaved out a sigh knowing I won't get anything out of her tonight so I went to clean up myself and went to bed.

I woke to chattering in the kitchen. I knew my friends were up and getting ready for school. I went to join them after waking up and they all came together to make me breakfast since they crashed at my apartment last night making it into a mess. I appreciate the effort but no amount of pancakes and fluffy cheesy eggs will bring back my silk linen pillows that's now covered in drool, alcohol and some throw up.

But I'm never the type to hold a grudge. Friendship means way more to me than a few pillows.

All my friends left one by one after breakfast to go to their respective classes and by noon it was only Julie and I.

I was still plagued with curiosity and I really wanted some answers but Julie was rushing to finish her homework before class and I didn't want to interrupt her for a few stupid questions.

Julie started packing up to leave and I was just watching some TV, deciding that I would ask her to come over after her class or something to ask some questions.

My phone buzzed and it showed that Julie had left me a message.

Julie: I left a note on your desk.

I slowly stood up from the couch and walked towards the dining table where Julie was sitting earlier and sure enough there was a folded up note.

It wrote….

*This ritual is only to be done after you have made sure that the clock and all the time around you is correct to your native time.*

*Once you have made sure this is true then you may proceed.*

*Once the night has completely set, you may start.*

1. *Turn off all the lights in your house.*
2. *Close all your curtains and make sure all your windows are SEALED. You should not be able to see outside at this point.*
3. *Find a device that can just play static, just pure static. Doesn’t matter whether it is a TV or a phone. Just make sure it is a device that can play through the night. THEY NEED TO BE DISTRACTED.*
4. *You now need to light two candles. One where you will spend the night, usually in your bedroom. The other at the place where you will do your ritual, the bathtub. The two candles represent the two destinations.*
5. *Starting from your bedroom, take off your clothes one by one and leave a trail to the bathroom. Doesn’t matter how you place your clothes, just make sure you can tell that it is leading to the bathroom.*
6. *Start filling your bathtub with water, make sure you don’t have anything on you when you enter the bathtub. No necklace, no earring, no nothing. No even a scrunchie. Not even fake lashes. They love to attach themselves onto dead objects.*
7. *Get in the tub, you must be able to fully soak yourself into the tub. Your whole body is fully submerged. Head and knees, everything.*
8. *Once you make sure every part of your body is soaked you can get out immediately or enjoy the water. This part is not really that important. But this part is also your last chance to back out. If you wish to back out. Just turn on the lights and undo everything. The mirror, the static, the sealed windows and pick up all your clothes. And make sure to blow out the candles. Then go shower like normal. The ritual hasn't fully started yet so you don’t have to worry.*
9. *If you wish to proceed then get out of the water, do not dry yourself. Take the candle and place it in the middle of the door frame. BE WARNED ONCE THIS STEP IS DONE. THEY HAVE BEEN INVITED.*
10. *After you place the candle in the middle of the doorframe of the bathroom, retreat back into your room following the trail of clothes you left behind. Don’t step out of line. Don’t look back, and don’t return back into the bathroom.*
11. *Once back into your room put the candle you lit earlier at the entrance of the room also in the middle of the doorframe.*
12. *Now get on bed, and do not fall asleep until you hear the sound of someone getting out of the bathtub.*
13. *WARNING: NO MATTER WHAT, DO NOT OPEN YOUR EYES. ONCE AGAIN. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES OPEN YOUR EYES. FORCE YOURSELF TO SLEEP.*
14. *Once you wake up again, no matter the time. Because it doesn’t matter anymore. You can go check the candles. The candle to your bedroom and the candle to your bathroom should both be out. Most Importantly the static that was playing through the night should be turned off now.*

*If all the following is true then I must say...*

*CONGRATULATIONS THE RITUAL WAS A SUCCESS.*

*The day you wake up is DAY ONE. Keep track of time. You will need to end the ritual on day seven 11:59pm exact.*

*WARNING: THEY ARE NOW FOLLOWING YOU. GOOD LUCK.*
