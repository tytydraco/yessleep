My small vessel careens the choppy waters. I wipe the sweat from my brow. The weather is sweltering, despite the cloud covering above us. 

"My mission calls, as it did for my father before me and his grandfather before him. I'm unsure if it's the sea itself which calls or something within its depths. But, I know I must answer." James says, jotting the words down on paper.

I tend to ignore his odd ramblings because well, he pays me a lot to man this boat. But I start to wonder if it's really all worth it. Our boat glides over aquamarine waves. Large dark rocks jut out of the water like teeth. It's becoming tough to avoid them.

"I don't like the looks of this, it's getting pretty dangerous out here." I say.

"You're not getting a damn cent if you don't keep fucking going!" He screams, a vein popping out of his forehead. I waver in anger but ultimately continue on. 

Appearing out of nowhere, cool blasts of fog. We become suffocated inside it. Panic ensues in my mind. I scream, hardly able to see anything.

"Calm down. Just follow my lead." James says. "We are almost at the coordinates. The coordinates my own father sacrificed his life to get."

The fog dissipates quicker than it arrived. I turn towards James who watches in eager anticipation as we inch closer to the destination. 

"We're here. One can only traverse this forbidden area every sixty years. Other times it ceases to exist." He looks overjoyed. "Soon, I'll have accomplished what my ancestors tried for millennia."

"What the fuck is that?" I say.

In the now motionless waters before me, float a couple dozen severed arms. Fresh removals, I assume due to the blood filling the water. I dare not ask where they're from.

I lean over the side of the boat and hurl. My mind and legs feel like jello. What has he gotten me into?  In my nervous contemplation I feel a hand touch my back. I turn around to see James. He shoves me into the eerie waters. 

"You have served your purpose!" He says, giddy with excitement. "I am closer now than my forefathers ever were!"

Frantic, I paddle back trying to reach the boat, all the while James looks on in eager anticipation. The severed limbs twitch, before pointing in my direction. They thrash towards me, splashing blood all about the beautiful blue water. 

"James! James! Let me back on board!" I scream, but it's to no avail. Before I know it, the limbs drag me under. I begin my slow descent towards the murky depths beneath the suns warmth. The last thing I hear before going under is James speaking.

"My father would be proud." He says. As I sink, holding my breath, I notice something above me. A strange blue symbol now glows in the sea, just above where I was dragged under.

I recalled James's rambling of an ancient language, one lost to time, to the normal human eye it would be unreadable. 

"I can understand it, my whole bloodline can. That's why i'm here." He said, the day prior. I watch as the boat continues its course without me.

I sank for what felt like an eternity. The arms keeping a ghoulish grip on my body. It's strange, despite being dragged further below, I don't feel any different. The pressure bas no effect on me. And the weirdest part, I can breathe underwater. Is it that strange light above the surface? 

Even though I'm far below where the light of the sun reaches, that strange blue light remains visible, hundreds of feet above me. That's the last thing I remembered.

When I woke up, I'm in a dark, damp cave. I fumble around on the cave floor, eventually brushing my hand on something made of leather. A book. 

Just enough light from the morning sun glistens in off the water to render it visible. It has hundreds of pages. All of james ramblings collected into one book of madness. I skim through it before reading the last page.

"I know where my next destination lies. Commandeering the ship, I head west. I no longer have any need for maps or navigational tools, the sigil told me everything I need to know. Though the distance traveled is vast, it appears to take no time at all. Before I know it, my boat comes closer to the cave's entrance.

"Large stalagmites peek out of the waves at the mouth of the cave, beckoning one inside. The interior is unseeable from the outside. I stop my boat right outside this esoteric entrance, not bothering to anchor it or tie it down. Soon, I won't need it after all. stepping out of the boat, I begin my swim into the mouth of the watery cave. It chills me to my bone, but I don't mind, only focused on going forth. 

"As I prepare to traverse the murky waters, I spot a fleeting glimpse of lone limbs struggling to swim alongside me. A sense of familiarity washes over me. On one limb, a shiny object around the wrist catches my eye. My dad's old watch. Soon, I'd join him in the deep.

"I can view his presence even from the mouth of the cave. It glows the same way that forgotten sigil had, beckoning me forth. He'll soon be before me, glowing a strange bluish-green hue. His arms outstretched waiting to embrace me, wearing a skeletal grin. Soon, I could finally join him on his ship, in the depths."
