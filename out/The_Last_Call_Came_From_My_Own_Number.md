The voicemail appeared at 3:17 a.m.

I know the exact time because I was awake, staring at the ceiling, counting the faint clicking sounds inside the walls of my apartment. Old building. Old pipes. That’s what I told myself—until the clicks began to repeat in groups of three.

Click. Click. Click.

Pause.

Click. Click. Click.

That was when my phone vibrated on the nightstand.

**1 missed call.**  
**Caller ID: Me.**

I didn’t move for a full minute. My phone kept vibrating softly, like it was embarrassed to interrupt me.

Another notification popped up.

**New voicemail (0:32).**

I hadn’t answered the call. I was certain of that. Still, my thumb moved on its own.

The voicemail opened to static at first—deep, wet static, like it had been recorded underwater. Then came breathing. Slow. Careful. Familiar.

Then a voice said, very calmly:

“Don’t turn around.”

I sat bolt upright.

There was no one in my room. No reflection in the dark window behind me. No shadow where one shouldn’t be.

The voicemail continued.

“If you’re hearing this, you already messed up. I tried calling earlier, but you didn’t listen. That’s okay. I didn’t either.”

The voice was mine.

Not a recording that *sounded* like me. It had my cadence. My pauses. Even the tiny hitch in my throat I get when I’m tired.

“I don’t have much time,” the voice said. “They don’t like when I warn you. They say it ruins the learning part.”

The message cut off.

No explanation. No dramatic sting. Just silence.

I checked the call log. No outgoing calls. No incoming calls besides that one. I checked my carrier app, my voicemail history, even my email in case it had synced somewhere else.

Nothing.

By morning, I’d convinced myself it was a glitch—some crossed signal, some scam using voice cloning. That explanation lasted until I noticed the bruise on my left wrist.

It looked like fingers had wrapped around it.



I started noticing the gaps two days later.

Little things at first. I’d open my fridge and find food missing that I didn’t remember eating. My browser history showed searches I never made—*how long does it take to forget a face*, *can mirrors remember you*, *what happens if you answer twice*.

The worst part was the calendar.

On Thursday, there was an event scheduled for 2:00 a.m.

**“CALL YOURSELF.”**

I didn’t put it there. The event details were empty except for one note:

*This is your last clean loop.*

I called my sister that night. She answered on the third ring, groggy.

“You okay?” she asked.

“Do you remember me calling you yesterday?” I said.

She paused. “You… called last week. From a blocked number. You didn’t say anything. Just breathed for a bit.”

My stomach dropped. “That wasn’t me.”

“Yeah,” she said quietly. “I figured.”

She hung up before I could ask why.



The second voicemail came from my number again. This one was longer.

“You need to stop checking the mirrors,” my voice said. “That’s how they confirm alignment. I know it feels instinctive, but don’t do it.”

I looked up.

The bathroom mirror across the hall was uncovered. I was standing directly in its line of sight.

My reflection lagged.

Just a fraction of a second—but enough.

“I’m not you anymore,” the voice continued. “I mean, I am. But I’m the one who stayed.”

Stayed where?

“They don’t copy people,” the voice said. “They *trade* them. One of us moves forward. One of us fills the gap.”

The voicemail distorted near the end, like something was pressing against the microphone.

“If you hear knocking tonight,” my voice whispered, “do not answer. That’s not them being polite. That’s them asking permission.”



The knocking started at 2:59 a.m.

Three slow knocks.

Click. Click. Click.

I sat frozen on my bed, phone clenched in my hand. The knocks weren’t loud. They were careful—like whoever was on the other side didn’t want to wake the neighbors.

My phone buzzed.

**Incoming call: Me.**

I declined it.

The knocking stopped.

For exactly seven seconds.

Then it resumed—harder this time.

I don’t remember standing up. I just remember being in the hallway, staring at my front door, every instinct screaming that if I opened it, something irreversible would happen.

Another voicemail arrived without a call.

“Good,” my voice said. “You learned that one faster than I did.”

There was a sound in the background now. A low hum. Like an enormous fluorescent light.

“I need you to understand something,” the voice continued. “This isn’t the first loop. It’s just the first one where you noticed.”

My reflection appeared in the dark TV screen across the room.

It smiled.

I did not.



Sleep became impossible. Every time I drifted off, I dreamed of standing in an endless hallway lined with doors—each one labeled with my name, written in slightly different handwriting.

Some doors were scratched out.

Some were open.

Behind one of them, I could hear breathing.

During the day, people started acting… cautious around me. Coworkers hesitated before using my name. A barista asked me to confirm my birthday “again” because the system flagged something.

Flagged *what*?

The third voicemail answered that.

“You’re starting to overlap,” my voice said. “That’s bad. When too many versions exist at once, they clean house.”

“Who are *they*?” I whispered.

My phone speaker crackled.

“You don’t really want to know,” the voice said. “You just want to survive. And I can help you do that.”

“How?” I asked.

A pause.

“You take my place.”

The line went dead.



That night, the knocking came from inside the apartment.

Three taps—soft, precise—on my bedroom door.

I didn’t own anything that could make that sound on its own.

My phone lit up.

**Incoming call: Me.**

I answered it.

“Okay,” my voice said instantly. “Listen carefully. When you open the door, you’re going to see yourself. Don’t panic—that part is normal.”

The handle began to turn.

“You’re going to notice differences,” the voice continued. “Scars you don’t remember. Tiredness that doesn’t match your body. That’s because I’ve been here longer.”

The door creaked open.

I was standing there.

Same height. Same face. Same bruise on the wrist.

But his eyes were wrong.

They looked… relieved.

“You have two options,” he said—out loud, not through the phone. “You can fight me, and they’ll notice the disturbance.”

Behind him, the hallway stretched too far.

“Or,” he said gently, “you can let me go.”

Something moved behind his reflection in the dark picture frame on the wall.

Watching.

Waiting.

“If you stay,” he added, “you won’t remember this conversation. That’s how it works. That’s how it always works.”

My phone slipped from my hand.

“Last clean loop,” he repeated softly. “What do you say?”



I woke up on my bed.

Morning light streamed through the window. My phone lay on the nightstand, silent. No missed calls. No voicemails.

My wrist hurt.

The bruise was gone.

At work, everything felt… easier. Familiar in a way it hadn’t before. Like I finally knew where to stand.

But sometimes—usually around 3:17 a.m.—I hear clicking in the walls.

And sometimes, when my phone buzzes and I see an incoming call from an unknown number, I feel a strange urge to answer quickly.

Before *he* does.

Because deep down, I know the truth now.

I wasn’t the one being warned.

I was the one being replaced.
