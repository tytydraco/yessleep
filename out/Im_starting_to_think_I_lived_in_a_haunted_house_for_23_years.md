I’ve been super tired recently from life and medical stuff, so I’ll post when I can. Probably will be many short posts vs long ones so this doesn't die in my drafts. 

But as soon as I started thinking about this today - I can’t stop. So many memories have been flooding back to me, and it needs to go somewhere. God knows this is an area I DO NOT want to bring up in therapy lol.

At the same time, it feels unnerving to post or share - like speaking about it will make it more real. Or that something at the farmhouse will know. It will wait and it will always be tied to me and my family.

That all sounds dramatic and weird. I know, I know, I sound like the scared little girl I was when I was 10. Truthfully it sounded dumb to me when I was 10, but if you were there, even only for a night. Well, you might just understand. At the end of the day, I guess I just want to feel heard and understood. Who doesn't? 

To start this off - I’ll give some background on the farmhouse. I don’t want to bore anyone with a ton of details or exposition, so I’ll keep it short and link any other posts to this one for reference. If I have more energy I may draw up a map or find some pictures.

* This property is located in the north eastern America
   * Located in Amish/Mennonite dominated area
   * All neighbors outside a single acre that used to be part of the property are Amish
   * My family is mainly Amish descent
* The main farmhouse was built sometime in the 1880s
   * Property is approximately 58 acres
   * Many 'out' buildings - shanties (2), milk house, shop, pig pen, barn, garage 
   * There is an in law/grossmutter house next to the farmhouse built in 1998/1999s (Built for my great grandma so my parents could live in the farmhouse when they started expecting)
   * Large garden, wine grape vines, pear tree, berry bushes and strawberry plants
   * A few acre pasture
   * Most acres are primarily used to grow corn or alfalfa when crops need rotated 
   * Owned by (I think) my grandmother
      * Previously owned by great grandmother
      * Grandmother + grandfather do not live on the property - they have a house a few minutes away
      * Has been in the family for over 100 years

I am sure I could go on about it, but those are the main facts. I'll update as needed. Not sure how to start this off, so I'll start at my first 'strange' memory in the house. 

2003 (ish)

I remember sitting in the living room alone watching old home movies. I was really at the cusp of just forming memories, so this whole event was weird. It was like watching a part of a life that I wasn't in. Like I was an observer to my own self. There were mainly shots of the farm, some of the feral cats on the farm, some of the outdoor play set I had. The main scene I remember is me following a white cat around the sandbox.   
  
Really odd thing is I can't recall my parents putting on the tapes, and I never saw these tapes again. Hell I don't know if we even had a camcorder (we were always behind tech wise - dad is cheap). I was too little to reach the VCR or understand how to put on tapes. My sister was also few years old at this point - but she wasn't in the tapes. It was just me. I didn't see another person in them and I didn't really recognize myself or understand that was me in the tapes.
