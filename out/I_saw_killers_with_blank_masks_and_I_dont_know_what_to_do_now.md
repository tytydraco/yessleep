Let me start by saying I had never seen someone killed before in my entire life. Unfortunately, that is no longer the case. What I witnessed at several locations has scared me and left an indelible impression on any feeling of safety and security I may have previously taken for granted.

Three people in just as many nights have been killed and I don’t believe the police will find the suspects. I can scarcely believe they were human with the way they moved and the emotionless and methodical way they went about the task of the destruction of human life.

I can still see the terrible masks they wore when I close my eyes; at least I hope they were just masks. The fact that I laid eyes on them at all and am still alive is a small miracle, though how much longer I am remains to be seen.

I only share this story reluctantly as I do, to see if anyone might know anything more about these mysterious and lethal individuals and who they might be or what they might want. Also to see if indeed any other witnesses may yet be alive. I need to know for my own sake and sanity, as well as trying to safeguard and warn others of what this might be.

The first night I encountered them I was at a gas station out close to the I5 exit. I was filling up my car and decided to go inside the Mobile station and get some snacks and a drink since I had a bit more of a drive to get home after going to see some family up north.

It was about 11’oclock at night and when I stepped inside it was fairly devoid of other patrons, just one nervous-looking man at the counter who winced when I stepped in but seemed to adjust his glasses and stare at me visibly relaxing as he saw who I was or perhaps was not.

He coughed out an unenthusiastic “Welcome, let me know if you need any help” and resumed staring outside as if expecting some unseen threat to come in at any moment.

I thought it was a little odd but I started perusing the shelves and seeing if they had any of my favorite snacks to take on the road back home. I still had about an hour of driving left and hadn’t eaten since dinner about four hours ago.

As I was holding a bag of combos and a bag of cheese it’s, considering which I might prefer, I heard the attended let out a startled cry and dash away from the register, half-tripping over a display of energy drinks. He looked like he had seen a ghost and just blew past me leaving me unattended in the station while he fled to the backroom.

I heard a click which must have been the door being locked and I was more than a little confused and scared by the sudden turn of events.

I tried not to freak out but I didn’t know what the hell was going on. I slowly walked towards the nearest window close to the door and peered outside. Standing near my car was a group of four people. Each was wearing what appeared to be an oddly colored but otherwise featureless plain face mask.

They did not appear to be holding anything and their hands lay at their sides. The site alone was deeply unnerving, they did not speak a word but merely started moving in unison from where they stood towards the station door. I fell back from the window, my heart racing. I didn’t know what to do, were these robbers just trying to take down the gas station and leave? Or was it something more sinister?

I didn’t want to be here to find out, but I didn’t know how I could leave just then without being seen.

I decided even though I felt like it was a terrible idea at the time to try and hide in a small narrow spot between the bathroom door and a magazine rack. It felt exposed but I didn’t know what else to do, so I hid there and held my breath as I heard the front door open and the entry chime sound.

I heard their heavy footfalls all moving in lockstep in an otherwise disturbing eerie silence. From what I saw not even sign or body language was used to communicate between them, they just marched on methodically to the backroom door.

There was a long pause and silence, then a faint knocking on the backroom door was followed by terrified screams of the attended. I couldn’t make out everything he said from where I was but I did hear him say he had called the police and they were on their way, that they could take everything from the till just please let him go.

There was no response, after another long pause I thought they might have given up but I heard the large crash and the splintering of wood and metal hinges and figured they had broken the door down.

The attendant was still the only person making any sound as he wept and pleaded for his life. His attackers did not say anything, no demand, no threat. They did not accept any bribe or even the offered safe combination. The four silent figures had pulled the attended out from the backroom to the front of the store.

The figures circled the man and pointed down at him with their index fingers in unison, still not uttering a sound. The only thing that could be heard was the soft sobbing of the attended. That sound was cut off as one of the figures had bent down near the man and was from the sounds of it choking the life out of the attended.

I heard his struggling and strangled breathing, his cries for help, and the wheezing desperation in his voice. I felt terrified and guilty since I knew I was unarmed and equally helpless against these terrible blank-faced attackers.

I could not even call for help since I left my phone in the car, I hoped the attended had been able to call the police but no sirens sounded in the distance and it may have been an empty threat if the alarm was up front or if something happened to the phone line here.

After what felt like ages the struggling and gasping of the attended stopped. The figures stood up and without saying a word to each other, without taking anything, without any other consideration, proceeded to leave back the way they had come from.

After peeking outside to make sure they were gone I stood up and approached the body of the man on the ground. I stopped over and checked his pulse just in case, he was dead. I hadn’t meant to but I accidentally rolled him over when trying to step over him and his terrified and swollen face looked back up at me. I almost fell back and tripped when I saw a strange metallic glint on the ground by his head.

Without thinking about the possible incriminating action this might be I bent down and retrieved the item on the ground. It was a piece of thick gauge wire, sort of like the type used in pianos. I looked back down at the man on the ground and saw a slim line along his neck.

Those people had evidently strangled him with this piano wire.

I realized with dawning horror that the men had left, I was alone with this body, a murder weapon, and no other living witnesses.

Then I made my first big mistake, I took the wire since I assumed it had my fingerprints on it now and I left the scene before anyone else, authority or otherwise could show up.

That terrible scene was just the first night.

I agonized all night when I had gotten home on what to do. I had just witnessed a cold-blooded murder but now I was terrified that I would be the suspect since I still had the lethal wire in my possession.

My story sounded too bizarre to believe. I considered that maybe they had cameras that might help prove my innocence and show those bizarre men in those blank masks. Unfortunately a night later when hearing of the murder on the news, it was indicated that there were no known suspects since the video footage of the event was disrupted somehow and police had no way to identify the killers.

This made up my mind since I would sound like a lunatic and have no proof it was not me if I came forward so I swallowed my guilt and tried to put the horrific event behind me.

The following night my worst fears came true and I saw them again. I was at my apartment and I was going out to check my mailbox at around five pm. I had just gotten to the mailboxes and was fumbling with my key in the bad lighting when something caught my attention in the corner of my eye.

I almost let out a scream when I saw one of the blank-faced men standing near the main office, utterly motionless. I did not know if he was looking at me or something else with that mask but I was paralyzed with fear all the same.

As I stood stature still and holding my breath I saw another two appear on the other side of the office building taking up positions next to the door. I was beginning to have a terrible flashback to that night and I felt I knew what was going to happen next.

My fears were validated when I saw them move in lockstep to crowd around the main office door. My heart sank when I realized that our apartment’s manager Alice was still in there and would normally be finishing up work and locking up around six pm.

There were two loud knocks on the door and a pause, followed promptly by Alice's scream and she had finally seen who was calling on her.

I couldn’t stand it this time; I couldn’t watch it happen again. Against all my own survival instincts I leaped forward and shouted at the four figures looming in the doorway “Stop! Get away from her!”

I stood there transfixed in my suicidal attempt at bravery, partly looking around to see if some of the other tenants might come out and maybe help or call the police. The subsequent silence was deafening and after an agonizingly long pause, one of the figures turned to regard me.

I swallowed hard but tried to not look away when it began staring directly at me. The other three began moving back to the door and in the next moment had kicked the door down in unison and I heard the terrified scream of Alice again.

I broke into a run, charging towards the one in front of me. My attempt was short-lived, somehow as I was running towards him, he had moved like a blur and was next to me instead of in front of me. I could barely blink before I registered his arm was outstretched with a clenched fist and I was violently clothes-lined off of my feet onto the hard ground.

I was almost knocked out by the impact and my eyes tried to focus through the pain in my head. I saw the man staring down at me. He did not strike again and capitalize on my vulnerability he just stood there staring down at me. After a moment he moved into the office and once again I heard sobbing and pleas for mercy cut off with a terrible strangling sound and I knew they were garroting Alice in the same fashion as that gas station attended.

I tried to stand up; I needed to get them to stop and couldn’t stand to be witness to another of the killings. As I almost succeeded in forcing myself to my feet I was smashed on the back of the head by something and lost consciousness.

I woke up an indeterminate amount of time later in complete darkness. The smell was terrible and I realized I had been thrown into the dumpster of my apartment complex. I pulled myself through the mire of garbage up to the top of the container and managed to extricate myself from the dumpster, landing badly on my side with a thud. I let out a pained groan but tried to ignore the blistering headache and body pain I was suffering while I got to my feet and looked around.

I couldn’t see anyone and I shambled over to the office building the lights were still on inside but no one was there. I held my breath and I stepped further inside and to my horror, but unfortunately not to my surprise I found Alice. She had been strangled just like the gas station attended and next to her head was a small piece of piano wire.

I ran back home in a blind panic, I couldn’t believe it had happened again. Why were they doing this? Was there any reason?

After several hours I saw the police arrive out my window, I don’t know what took them so long or why no one else had been outside when all of that had happened. I resolved to tell them what I knew and offer the two pieces of wire I found as what would hopefully be perceived as proof.

I approached the office as the officer was furiously yelling into his radio “This is Harris, respond! I need backup, we have a homicide here. Will anyone respond?” He turned around from his failed attempts at summoning backup, drew his gun, and pointed it at me shouting “Freeze”

I raised my hands in the air and shouted back “Don’t shoot” I began telling the officer of what I had seen and showed him the wire. He was skeptical and kept getting distracted by his inability to get a signal to call for help. It was strange because we never had reception problems here before, cell, radio, or otherwise.

As he was taking my statement I abruptly stopped mid-sentence and my mouth fell slack. I had to rub my eyes because I couldn’t process what I was seeing. He noticed my pause and asked if everything was alright. Before I could stammer out a warning a blank-faced person had a wire wrapped around the officer’s neck and proceeded to strangle him right in front of me.

The officer’s eyes bulged and he tried to fight back and reach for his pistol or his stun gun. The figure was able to effortlessly hold him up off of his feet and choke him out while barely moving when the officer kicked, elbowed, and tried to fend him off. He looked at me pleadingly and I once again tried to help.

I sprang forward and tried to pull the blank-faced assassin off of the officer. As I stepped closer I don’t know how I knew but I instinctively ducked as a savage blow leveled at my head had just missed me from behind. I turned around and saw another blank-faced man staring at me.

I wasted no time and lunged back towards the one choking the officer and tried to punch the man in the face. My arm barely made it an inch forward before I realized a third blank-faced man had seized it and held me in place. Once again no words no other motion, just a blank stare from the featureless masks was all I saw.

“You can't do this!” I screamed but none of them responded. My desperate cry was only answered by the increased gasping and choking sound coming from the officer.

The next moment I was again cracked on the head and fell unconscious.

I woke up several hours later. To my disbelief, I was in my own bed this time. “How the hell had this happened?” I said out loud to myself. I felt nauseous and had a massive headache. I touched the back of my head and a small amount of blood was on my hand where I had touched it.

I looked out my bedroom window and saw that the police car was gone; oddly no one was in or around the office. I didn’t know what the hell had happened. At that point, I actually considered that it might have just been a terrible dream.

But as I laughed out loud I saw on my nightstand near my bed something that terrifies me still, something that I hope no one else has seen and if they have please tell me what happened to you or better yet how to get rid of them.

What I saw was a small piece of piano wire lying there, with a small tinge of blood near the center. Resting near it, there was an oddly shaped and featureless mask.
