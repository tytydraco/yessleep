There are so many stories and legends of monsters that hide in the dark. It makes sense, we can’t see in the dark so there is always some unknown about it. Nothing good ever comes from the dark in movies. There could be an assassin, a trap or a monster in the dark and you would never know until it’s too late. Darkness is feared by instinct. Light is the opposite of that, it is warm and comforting. It doesn’t hide anything and shows you the dangers clearly. Since the cavemen, the light was our protection. The light of the fire has protected us from beasts just as the light of lighthouses guided boats. Light is to safety what dark is to fear. Which is why what is happening to me is so unnerving. The natural source of protection was twisted and corrupted leaving me to hide in the dark for safety.

I started to fear the light when I noticed the things that hide in it. I don’t mean dangers hiding in plain sight, I mean an actual creature that is invisible in the light. The problem is that we can barely see in the dark so it is also difficult to see them even out of the light. It’s a difficult concept to explain. The best comparison I found was an experiment with a clear glass ball in water. Some of you might have seen a video about it. If you haven’t, it’s not difficult to find and pretty interesting. It is clearly visible before the water is added but adding the water bends the light in a way that makes it disappear. For those creatures, they are hidden in the light the same way the ball is in the water. The dark reveals them but the limitations of human eyes still makes it difficult to make out. I think animals might be able to help them somehow. If you ever saw a cat looking in a corner at something you can’t see, that might have been it.

You might be wondering, you have been in the dark before, how come I never saw one ? Well, you might have. You just didn’t realize it. If your eyes get used to the dark, you might be able to see them in passing. You can try to stay in the dark for a while and observe, if there is one in your room you might catch a glimpse of movement. Human eyes are much better at perceiving moving objects so that’s your best bet. There is no guarantee that you will have one where you are but you are welcome to try. Maybe you will get lucky (or unlucky depending on what you do after). But no matter what you do, do not touch one. If you only remember one thing from this post, make it this. Never, ever touch one.

&nbsp;

The first time I saw one, I had been staying in my bedroom for a while. I started having very strong migraines and any light was making them worse. My eyes have always been sensitive to light, I rarely go out without sunglasses and I get headaches if I stay in the sun for too long. I got used to staying in my room with the light off and blackout curtains, blocking as much of the light as I could. I usually just listen to music for a few hours until my migraine goes away. Sometimes an audio book if the pain is not too distracting. If you ever had migraines before, you know how painful it can be. I never had any starting in my dark room so I grew to feel more safe and comfortable there than in the light. I like seeing shapes in my room become clearer and clearer as my eyes get used to the darkness. Even in that familiar room, the shadows make new shapes that make it feel like a new world that only I can see. A world that is now the only place where I feel safe.

&nbsp;

The first time I saw movement, I didn’t mind it that much. I thought my brain was playing tricks in the dark. It’s only after seeing it again day after day that I started to realize what it was. It didn’t move fast or regularly but it moved. I wasn’t really scared of it, more curious. It didn’t feel threatening, the way it moved was soft and smooth. It never moved towards me, always away, but it was always in a different place every time I came back to the room. As days passed, I got closer to it. It made it easier to see what it looked like, even if it was still too dark to see the details. It was the size and shape of a basketball. Not a perfect sphere but pretty close. I could see some small movement within it, waves moving its surface. It seemed like under its skin was a series of moving rings, pushing against the outer layer to make the whole thing move. There was always at least one ring moving. It looked like a cat purring feels like. Soft and warm.

&nbsp;

It was so relaxing, so soothing. So I touched it. I was warm and silky in my hand. The rings agitated a bit and I felt them rub softly against my right hand. I was comforting and soft to the touch. The warmth in my fingers made them a bit numb like when you leave your finger in hot water for a long time. I removed my hand and moved away from the creature. It started to follow me, like a curious animal. I walked around it playing in a slow chase for a few minutes until I tripped on a chair I couldn’t see in the dark. I tried to grab the desk with my numb hand but couldn’t reach it. I was confused about how I couldn’t grab it when it was so close. My right hand was still numb and I couldn’t really put any strength into it. I reached with my left hand to massage it and get the blood moving to wake it up.

&nbsp;

I only found my wrist. I turned on the light to see that my hand was missing entirely. The creature disappeared completely in the light. I couldn’t feel my fingers not because they were numb but because they were gone. It wasn’t painful. It still had a warmth but as comforting as it felt before, it now terrified me as much as the creature that caused it. I ran out of the room to the kitchen, putting my warm stub under the water, hoping the cold would stop the warmth that was devouring me. It didn’t. I went to the garage and found my grandfather’s electric saw, made before safeties were a thing, and did the only thing I could think of. Before I lost consciousness, I watched what was left of my severed elbow be consumed by the light.

&nbsp;

I woke up in the hospital. One of my housemates had heard the commotion and called the emergency right away which saved my life. There have been cases of self-harm for people with strong migraines like mine. Although rarely as extreme as mine. I kept quiet about what happened and encouraged the doctors on their initial judgment. I did everything I could to leave the hospital as soon as possible. When I did, I didn’t go home. I went as far as I could. I’m staying with a friend that moved away a few years back. Told them I needed a new start. I’m planning to move to the other side of the world as soon as I can.

&nbsp;

I’m not sure why but I’m convinced the thing I touched is coming for me. I don’t think it means to hurt me, it felt curious. But its intentions don’t matter anyway, it would still make me disappear. Maybe that’s where the stories of spontaneous combustion come from, maybe they are why people disappear without trace sometimes. I’m just doing what I think is best to stay safe. I know that the one I touched is looking for me. Not with malice, with curiosity. But the result if it finds me would be the same.

&nbsp;

I stay in the dark as much as I can now. At least that way I might see it coming. I might have a chance to escape. I feel uncomfortable in the light now, there is no way to see what is hiding out there. No way to know if it's coming for me. I have seen others since then. They are not everywhere but they are not rare. I’d say around a quarter of the rooms I stayed in had one, no way to know how much of them are outside. From what I can tell, they try to stay away from us, they stay on the ceiling most of the time. You should probably be fine even if you manage to see one. Just don’t make the mistake of touching one like I did. I made a mistake and I beg you to learn from it. You know what hides in the light now, I hope that it doesn’t take a liking to you.
