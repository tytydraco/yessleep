I’ve been working late at my job, staying until around midnight (or later, depending on which manager is in charge that day) and helping to close up. A couple of nights ago, I got out at two in the morning. I’d gotten stuck with Melanie, an anal-retentive manager who wants to make sure everything is done and done right before we can leave. Dealing with Melanie’s bullshit after a day of dealing with an insufferable bunch of customers drained me. By the time I was finally able to get out, I shambled to my car like a zombie.

My job isn’t too far from my home, only being a 10-20 minute drive depending on traffic. Since it was 2 AM I figured the roads would be empty. People had better things to do, like sleep, something I desperately wanted to do in that moment.

I went to connect my phone to my car’s Bluetooth to play some music that would keep me awake, but I found that my phone had died and, unfortunately, I did not have my car charger that night. I settled for turning the radio to the local rock station instead.

The drive home is simple: go down the main road for a few minutes, turn onto Arkansas Avenue, then take that straight down until I reach my neighborhood. The thing is, once you’re about a mile off the main road, Arkansas Avenue becomes a long stretch of road bordered by trees with little bits of civilization every few miles. The road’s lack of streetlights can be pretty creepy at night, but at that point I was too tired to be spooked. If some random monster jumped out of the darkness and killed me, well, at least I could finally get some rest.

Anyway, I drove down Arkansas Avenue, my only company the moon and whatever local ads the radio station was playing between brief bits of Imagine Dragons. I was nearly to my neighborhood when I saw that the road was blocked by a downed tree.

Fuck.

A part of me briefly considered pulling over to the side of the road and just getting a bit of shut eye, but I decided against it. Instead, I figured I’d go down a side street for a quick detour. Thankfully, there was a road nearby, though oddly enough I didn’t recognize it. The sign identified it as Circle Road, which I didn’t remember ever seeing before. I didn’t think too much about it; it was close, I was tired, and it seemed to be the best way to get home.

Circle Road, like Arkansas Avenue, did not have any streetlights. I turned on my brights, but even then it was still hard to see. I went slowly, peering through the dark to try and find some other side road to go down to get back home. However, I noticed that there were no side roads to go down; just a straight line bordered by tall trees soundtracked by an Avenged Sevenfold song. One mile passed, then two, and still nothing.

I noticed that the farther down the road I went, the darker it got. While it was dark beforehand, at least the moon would sometimes peek from behind the clouds to provide a bit of light. However, the trees along Circle Road seemed to get taller the further I got. As the trees got taller, the radio station’s signal got weaker. “Mz. Hyde” was interrupted by bursts of static until the song was more static than music. The tree tops on either side of the road seemed to extend to each other, until finally, they touched, forming a sort of ceiling that blocked out the sky and the radio station. The only lights I had were my headlights and the digital clock in my car informing me that it was 2:13 AM. The only sound I heard was the beating of my heart.

I kept driving, hoping at some point to find some road or outlet or just somewhere with enough room to let me make a U-turn. Nothing came, though. The road just kept going, stretching to infinity. I felt like I had been driving for hours, but when I looked at my clock it said it was still 2:13 AM. That seemed impossible. I knew for a fact that at the very least a minute had passed. I counted the seconds in my head.

*One Mississippi…two Mississippi…*

When I got to 60, I checked the clock again.

2:13 AM.

I counted to 120.

2:13 AM.

Did my car’s clock break? Is that possible? I wanted to check, but I remembered that my phone was still very dead.

My sleep-deprived brain offered me another suggestion. The clock works fine. Time just didn’t pass. Circle Road isn’t real and somehow I ended up on some infinite road. Time would never pass and I’d be stuck driving on here forever and ever, never aging or dying.

I checked the clock again.

2:13 AM.

I floored the gas, taking my car from a sensible 35 mph to 70 in no time. 70 became 80 became 90 until I was zooming down Circle Road at 100 mph.

And nothing changed. The road was still a dark infinity. The radio still played static. The clock still said 2:13 AM.  

I still kept going. I thought maybe if I went fast enough I’d go down this road until it ended. Maybe it ended at the edge of the state, and I’d drive off into the ocean. At the very least, that’d be *something*.

As I sped along the road, hoping to hit civilization or water or even a brick wall, something did change. From the radio, I heard a voice. I slowed and turned the radio as loud as it could go.

The voice was male, but none of what he said made sense to me. It didn’t sound like any language I knew. The best way I could describe it is that it sounded like someone who didn’t know English was trying to make up English words. It was gibberish.

“What the hell…?” I muttered.

As the static receded and the nonsense voice got clearer, something else changed: there was light peeking through the trees. I felt a bit of relief, thinking I’d gotten free of this infinite darkness. But, as the tree tops parted and more light came through, I realized something was off. The light was a bizarre, sickly yellow. I looked up, and saw not the moon, but instead a black sun in the sky.

And then suddenly, I was driving through a neighborhood. The neighborhood was very 1950s suburbia but…wrong. I slowed down to get a better look. The homes were all bright, neon colors. A neon green house with a fluorescent orange roof stood next to a neon pink house with an electric purple roof. The lawns in front of these homes were dull brown, punctuated with bright blue wilting flowers.

Along the violet sidewalk, I saw a woman with a brilliant white beehive hairdo push a stroller. Taking a closer look, I noticed that the woman’s skin was a soft blue marred by thick, black veins; her head was bent at an unnatural angle; and the baby in the stroller had no head. The woman waved at me as I drove by.

On the other side of the road, I saw two boys with the same blue skin and dark veins wrestling in the grass. I saw that one had three arms, and the other had ten fingers on each hand.

I saw a man standing in the driveway of a bright yellow house. He was wearing a loud, paisley button up shirt splattered with dark patches of green. He was smoking what I initially thought to be a pipe but, after taking another look, I realized that “pipe” was, in fact, the severed arm of an infant. Smoke came out of the hand.

More sights like this greeted me the longer I drove down the neighborhood. Two boys rode on bikes with wheels made of meat. A man read a bright blue newspaper with incomprehensible red text. A couple strolled down the sidewalk, both holding the same severed head.

Up in the sky, I saw the blackness of the sun split, revealing yellow, rotting teeth that formed a smile. No one responded to this.

I kept driving, passing a boy walking a purple creature that appeared to be a cross between a dog and a spider, when I heard a knock on my car. I yelped, stopped, and saw that there was a man standing beside my car. He had the same blue skin and black veins as everyone else, but his button up shirt was a plain neon green. I rolled down my window and, in surreal confusion and horror, asked, “Yes?”

The man started speaking to me in that not-English language that was still blaring from my radio. I just nodded along. He handed me a flyer, written in that strange, alien language I saw on that newspaper. While holding it, I noticed it was a bit damp. I put it on the passenger seat. The man started pointing in various directions, still speaking in that not-English. I nodded, sprinkling in an, “Uh-huh” and “Ok” here and there. He finished speaking, then gave me a finger gun gesture on a twelve fingered hand. I rolled up my window and kept driving as he waved at me.

I kept going. I passed what I assumed to be a milkman in a bright red uniform leaving a collection of bottles filled with a steaming liquid on a doorstep. Women walked out of a home holding Tupperware full of green, writhing things. A four-armed boy threw a ball that hit a sign with an audible splat.

Wait. I realized the sign had writing on it that I could understand.

Circle Road.

I turned down that road, driving as fast as possible. As I drove down it, I noticed that the vibrant and surreal colors of this world seemed to become more desaturated. Neon green turned from a faint gray-green to just a gray. A road once surrounded by houses was slowly becoming bordered by trees once again. The gibberish on my radio was drowned out by static.

Soon, I was back on Circle Road, stuck in that endless infinity. A part of me wondered if I’d made a mistake and I had returned to the unending darkness I tried so hard to escape. But just as those worries hit me, I heard something new from the radio:

Guns N Roses. The rock station was back. “Welcome to the Jungle” ended, and the DJ mentioned it was 2:14 in the morning, something my car’s clock corroborated. Looking up, I could see the moon and the night sky. I laughed in relief.

After a few minutes, Circle Road stopped at Arkansas Avenue. Oddly enough, it let out past the downed tree instead of before it. I didn’t care. I was just glad to be back. I drove to my neighborhood, parked at my house, and then went inside before passing out on my bed.

I slept until noon; thankfully, it was my day off. After I woke up, I passed off whatever I saw on Circle Road as some sort of weird dream or hallucination caused by stress and lack of sleep. That didn’t stop me from staying in for the day and not going near my car. I told myself it was just because I wanted to relax, and I tried to believe it.

That brings us to today. I have work today. I got ready, grabbed my car charger and lunch, and got in my car. I unthinkingly chucked my lunch in the passenger seat, where it landed with a light crackle that almost sounded like a piece of paper.

My heart dropped to my stomach. With a gulp and shaking hands, I picked up my lunch to see what it had landed on.

In the passenger seat was a flyer with text written in a strange, alien language.
