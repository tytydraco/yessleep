He first came along a few months back, I was working the closing shift and things weren't too busy so I'd been chatting away with my coworkers for a while. A young man came up to the counter as if he wanted to order a drink, so I put my customer service face back on.

*"Hiya, what can I get ya?"*

No reply. He just stood there for a while, gazing off as if his mind was somewhere else entirely. 

*"Hellooo, are you okay?"*

Still nothing. 

It must have been a minute and a half before his little trance was broken, but he remained silent. He took a crisp dollar note out of his back pocket and reached across the counter to drop it into the tip jar. I looked at him confusedly, but his expression was as emotionless as ever. He swivelled and confidently marched out with the jingling of the front door ornaments accentuating his departure. 

Huh, weird, I thought whilst turning back to my coworkers to laugh about what just happened. Turns out that same kid had been here two times already that week, and did exactly what he had just done both times. Apparently, he used to be friends with my coworker Sally's brother in high school and she recognised him from the one time they'd met but that friendship drifted apart after graduation last year. They tried to get him to speak when he came in but had no luck, and eventually grew bored of whatever he was doing so just decided to ignore it and accept the extra tip. 

Between the three of us, it would come out to 0.33 cents for each visit. Or more if we weren't all working. Maybe even the full dollar. Yippee. 

Our shifts still alternated, so it wasn't every time he came in that all three of us caught sight of him. Sometimes it'd be just me, or Sally or Val alone, sometimes it'd be a combination of two of us and sometimes we'd all be there. Still, though, his behaviour remained the same. Expressions and emotions beyond that cold, deliberate neutrality lay out of his reach. It was almost like he couldn't fake emotion if he wanted to. He was there every single day nonetheless. We tried talking to him again after a while but predictably got nothing out of it. At some point, we even made a stupid little game out of it. Whichever combination of us is working when he reaches $20 gets to split it between them. If somebody is working alone it's all theirs. Considering he came in every three days we could work out when he'd hit that number, so no peeking at the schedule in advance and no games with switching days or whatever. 

Business in the cafe started to pick up in the following weeks, so our little visitor became even less noticeable whenever he'd strut in with that nothing look on his face and drop his dollar into the jar. Looking back, I suppose he enjoyed the lack of attention. Guess something about doing something so inane and nobody caring about it did something for the guy. The one time something that broke his droning rhythm happened was when he brushed his hand along Val's forearm as he went to put his dollar into the jar. It was subtle, something that could be played off as accidental, but the change piqued my interest a little. That was before the customer behind him grew prematurely impatient and the annoyances of the job took over. We reached our $20 threshold soon after, which meant it had been over 6 weeks since his first tip. 

It was just me and Sally working on that day, so we gave each other sarcastic congratulations and each grabbed $10 notes out of the jar to be replaced with our visitor's fresh 20. We were bored out of our minds, too, so we called Val to laugh about the silly milestone. She didn't reply. That wasn't like her at all, considering the borderline obsession she had with her phone, so we tried again for a while. Still nothing. 

Overthinking borne out of my general anxious mindset to life grew into genuine concern when Val didn't clock in for her shift the next day. That made two out-of-character occurrences, given the fact she never missed work. Between the ongoing lack of responses and my increasing nervousness, I decided to leave the cafe in Sally's hands so I could drive over to Val's place and check up on her. 

*Knock. Knock. Knock.*

No answer. As with the texts, calls, and all manner of communication so far. 

*Knock. Knock. Knock.*

I waited for ten minutes with no answer before I went into the little compartment hidden on the porch with her spare key in it. The metal key twisted into the handle and I pushed the door open with the trepidation of an unexpected and potentially unwanted intruder. 

The smell was the first thing to hit me. I'd never smelt anything like it in my life and haven't since. Some human instinct screamed at me, louder and louder until my thoughts were drowned out. I tried to convince myself I'd find a small animal that'd crawled in through a window. Or something Val had overcooked and forgotten about. Or...

My trail of faux comfort-inducing thought was broken off. 

Val's lifeless body hung from the living room ceiling. The colour had drained from her face and she swung ever so slightly in the breeze from the open window behind her. 

I let out an ungodly scream. Loud enough for the neighbours to hear. Probably the entire street, too. The next thing I remember is the cops arriving. Then nothing. Fade to black. The remainder of that day is lost to me. Maybe it's better that way. 

I went back to work not more than a day or two later for the sole reason of it being my only distraction, and my return coincided with the 21st dollar from our visitor. I hadn't made the connection at that point, and I didn't until Sally told me how he brushed up against her arm when he dropped his dollar in.

She was found with both wrists slit open in her bathtub that evening. 

I won't get into the aftermath, nor will I make too much comment on my healing process. I'm sure you can understand how difficult it's been without a long, droning description. The nightmares force me to relive the past few months enough, anyway. Sometimes I wonder who the others were. Who else did he mark with the drop of a dollar and that dispassionate look?

As for the cafe, I stopped working there after they found Sally. I couldn't bear to stand there and smile at customers all day long when both of my coworkers, my friends, were gone. 

And I couldn't bear to stand there when *he* came along. 

Today, I woke up to find a crisp dollar note tucked underneath my pillow.

I guess I get to keep it all this time.

Better use it fast.
