Humans are idiots!

How hard is it to follow three simple rules?! Posted at every single entrance and made as obvious as possible. Right next to the vanishing board (that shows up in multiple places, don’t ask how it works!). These are the rules that keep you mortals alive. Why do you all keep visiting this very dangerous place?! There are signs clearly stating how dangerous this land is!

1. Always have a light source on you at all times from sunset to sunrise when outside of your shelter. The exact source does not matter, so long as it will effectively increase your vision at night. (I suggest having multiple light sources on you at all times, even when inside a shelter).
2. If a large amount of abnormally large spiders show up within visual range, leave the area in the opposite direction of said spiders OR enter a shelter set up by human means with all possible entrances closed. They show up when worse entities are nearby. You are not their target. This only happens at night.
3. If you encounter a tall humanoid with a shadow of a spider, please leave them alone. Leave me alone, and I will do the same for you. Only ONE entity looks like this, and there are no other lookalikes. Yes, this is me.

This is my Post, and I am the guardian of this land. I am Charlie, and my title is simply The Spider Queen. This land sits on the border between your world and mine. Due to the various properties from my world, all natural resources replenish very frequently regardless of how much is harvested by anyone. Following the rules and common sense for surviving in the wild will keep you alive.

Until the rules failed someone. And that is bad news for everyone, including myself.

A pair of humans went camping in the forest. It was in the middle of the night when one of them (a well established idiot with a history of trying to kill himself in increasingly dumb ways) decided to investigate the source of inhumane howling. Without a flashlight or a weapon. Alone. Me and his buddy both just stood there watching him run into the woods. Me, holding my bladed lance in my right hand in a reverse grip for ease of carrying. He was holding his flashlight in his left hand, a loaded gun in his right (aimed at the ground). We both had the same thought, “This idiot is so dead; he’s not worth saving!” and neither of us followed him in silent mutual agreement.

The idiot’s footsteps could be heard getting further away from us and then suddenly stopped. The source of the noise was nearby because we could both see the glowing white eyes of the wolf-like creature in the forest. I saw (I could see this, but not his friend. Human vision sucks compared to mine) that the idiot was right in its face and he was trying to look at it more closely! Predictably, it promptly ate him by mutating said jaws to get him in one bite. Screaming, followed by crunching and chewing… and then silence. Yup, dead. And the moron was completely sober to boot. Then, I left to patrol other areas. Something about another group dealing with a nasty case of food poisoning (the resulting noise would attract unwanted attention from various creatures as well as the… smell).

Several hours passed. While I was busy dealing with the food poisoning incident; I heard lava-freezing (blood curdling) screams coming from the previously mentioned location. And it sounded like the idiot’s friend. I knew that something was very wrong because he had no history of making dumb decisions from what I observed.

Normally, I don’t rush to the source of the screaming because it usually involves idiots doing dumb things. But there was also the fact that I had never seen this creature on my land before until then. Because I saw its very long tongues from well above the treeline. And no old creature on this land has this trait in question! I do not merely dislike invasive species, but rather that their presence is bad news. Invasive species that are strong enough to destroy the current balance; which is already barely holding on as it is! To state it plainly: some things do scare me, but not human fears. Invasive species is one thing on my very short list of things that scare me. The rest of the list is not important for you humans to know.

Using my threads and knives, I was able to get there rather quickly. Since I was still in the forest, this made the trip much faster. When I arrived I saw a creature with multiple tongues trying to eat him. A knife attached to a thread was thrown in its mouth to distract it, the resulting inhumane screeching confirming that my knife stuck true. Followed by the man being released and he tried to flee to safety. It was trying to remove the blade lodged in its mouth with its bleeding tongues.

At the same time, I closed in the gap and stabbed the creature with my lance. Took an eye out and my blade plunged very deeply into its flesh as well. With a thread on the end of the handle linked to my right wrist, I went to get him to safety. Except, the creature got him first. Somehow, it used an arm-like limb to grab the fleeing man and shoved him into its mouth. The resulting crunching and screaming defied all logic because he should not have been capable of screaming with his lungs just… gone for a lack of better words. To describe his state at this point would be impossible to explain to mortal minds, and that is for the better.

Alas, the creature left the physical plane as soon as it chewed enough. Before the creature entirely vanished, I did the kindest thing that I could for him. I killed him so he would not suffer an unknown fate worse than death. I had reeled my lance in and aimed for his head. In his final moments, he looked relieved that I was going to kill him rather than the creature. He extended his head out for me to get a clear shot. Right after that, I threw my lance into his head, killing him instantly. With that, the creature left the physical plane entirely.

The worst part is that the sunrise happened a few minutes later, leaving behind my bloodied lance, a puddle of human blood, and the remaining traces of the man. I recalled my lance back into my grip and with one well practiced motion; shook the inhumane blood off onto a nearby tree.

Looking at the scene more closely revealed that he should have survived. His tent was a few feet away from where he was attacked, and you could have seen the light from his tent from the attack site. Creatures normally ensure there is a great distance between them and any human made things, especially light sources. He stayed close enough to avoid being in danger and was well prepared. One more vanishing case was added to the board. A man who did not deserve such a fate. I hope his family can at least get closure by knowing what happened to him. At least in death, he won’t be suffering anymore.

The forest is where this happened. Full of trees and underbrush, with wildlife and plants mutated by my world’s influence. The idiots I don’t mourn. The most recent one decided to sample a new mushroom species in the Mushroom Grove… raw. Just ate an unknown mushroom like an apple (the mushroom was about the size of a large apple)! The whole thing. I later heard rumors that he suffered a serious case of being stuck on the toilet for his troubles from his companions (They also called him an idiot for doing that, which is good because I know he’s the only moron in that group as far as I can tell).

Another fool mistook spicy fish (A popular species of fish to eat due to their tastiness, despite being spicy in taste. Found in the entire lakes area) for a poisonous fish in the lakes. Not lethally so, but they were sick for a few hours after eating it. The stupid comes from the fact that spicy fish SMELL spicy (A key ID to look for, among other things. You can smell how spicy it is and it widely varies between individual fish subspecies. All spicy fish subspecies are equally tasty and edible) and the aforementioned poisonous fish smells like death even when alive! While it’s not lethal to eat (due to vomiting all of the poison out, violently. I will spare you the mental images), the fool would feel extremely nauseous and miserable.

Only one vanishing case has a confirmed fate stated. The one I killed by my own hands. Everyone else on the board has an unknown fate. Most of them are nameless fools with exceptional stupidity as far as I’m concerned. A few were foolish enough to try to fight me and fled into the wilderness. The rest, not worth mentioning in the endless list of idiots listed on the vanishing board.

This was… bothersome, but at least the creature can be killed when it shows up later. But a new problem has shown up, and I can’t kill this one.

It started as yet another day while I was patrolling during the daytime. Humans were out and about doing human things. I had entered the Mushroom Grove after seeing a large amount of people enter. The usual foragers had shown up to gather various choice edibles. A few who saw me nodded and acknowledged my existence before going back to mushroom picking.

Most humans just acknowledge my presence and then otherwise ignore me. Or outright pretend I’m not there. Which is fine by me because they don’t get in the way of doing so.

But I spotted a human acting weirdly. They were taking pictures of various fungi and rotting trees; which by itself is not unusual. It was the fact that they were acting suspicious that got my attention. As if they had secrets to hide. So I walked up to them and the others silently got out of my way and were also avoiding the weirdo. It seemed like even the other humans were creeped out by that human. When I pointed to him, they got out of my way with zero fuss and pretended that I was not there. Seemed like they wanted me to deal with him, and I don’t blame them. Because he was taking photos on his phone, and UPLOADING said photos onto the internet. Which by the way… is highly frowned upon without removing the location data. I don’t enforce this policy, the other humans do! There were others trying to talk him out of it (His voice gave away his gender) along with other efforts on the humans’ part.

So I walked up to the fool in a very scary manner and the other humans left him alone. The others knew that I was not after them, just the idiot. A simple gesture of pointing at his phone and glaring him down gets the point across in most cases. Not this one. What else do I fear? Information leaking about my Post. Info that I can’t control. I felt the human equivalent of anger and fear at the same time. He KEPT trying to upload photos onto the internet even as I threatened and glared at him. I do not speak to humans for various reasons you don’t need to know. Gestures and glaring gets my point across. But soon, anger was replaced with fear and my blood boiled, literally (boiling blood is one reaction to emotions much like how human bodies do to various emotions)! So I slapped his right hand, which was holding his phone. You see, I’m 6’4” and the moron was 5’4”. Needless to say, his phone screen was cracked and so was his hand. I’m rather sure I broke his hand and then some based on how mangled his fingers looked. And possibly his wrist… arm… and shoulder via whiplash. Still afraid, I would have gone for a second slap… but the man ran away. Another human picked up his phone and realized that ONE photo did get uploaded. They told me so, and I thanked them with a gesture. I had taken the phone with me as well for further research.

Despite putting hours into tracing the uploaded photo I could not remove all traces of the photo from the internet. Now it’s out there, luring more people in. Recently, I’ve been getting nightmares about the information getting way out of hand and then crowds of people visiting my Post. These nightmares occur nearly every single time I sleep. I wake up with my blood boiling after each one without fail. And now my fears are coming true, the thought of a massive spike of people visiting my land makes my blood go from normal to boiling rapidly. More people have been visiting as of late, and in bigger groups as well. The smallest groups I see these days consist of a few people. Before, it was pairs and small groups on average. Fueling the malevolent force far faster than I can weaken it.

But the creatures have gotten stronger. More food (humans) for them will make it much worse. They are getting closer to the human built structures and light sources over time. Still unable to enter any human made shelters though, which is good news for everyone. I will need stronger weapons to deal with this. But this is a short term measure, and that is what scares me. Bringing my guns and powerful ammo will only buy me time to figure out what malevolent force is behind this. And I fear that I do not have time on my side. This is a warning, to avoid fueling the malevolent force with more human lives. I do not know what motives it has, but it will not be good no matter what.

And I suspect that the creatures get stronger with every human they claim. The implications of this horrify me, and I can’t prevent every human from dying on my land. The worst part is, I think my measures of keeping these creatures in my Post are starting to fail. I see them trying to enter the human portals (only humans can use these. I can’t) but they are unable to and are repelled naturally. I’ve seen a few get close enough to exit, only to hit an invisible wall and the portal vanishes afterwards.

My protection on this land may be thinning if they are able to get that close to the human portals. Which is why I have posted here to warn as many humans as possible to avoid my Post, until I can find a solution to fix this for good. I fear that if these creatures escape, your world would be doomed to a terrible fate. And I don’t want that to happen to your world. Nor do I want my world to learn about the only connection to your world, for they would do far worse things than I do with malevolent goals worse than mine. I dread to imagine what others from my world would do if they got the chance. Death would be merciful in comparison with what they would do.

As I have shown here, this land is dangerous. Pretending to be a mystic land to lure humans in with an unknown agenda that I am still trying to figure out. No human should visit this place, and yet it keeps on attracting you humans to come visit. So please, disregard the siren call that this land has on you!
