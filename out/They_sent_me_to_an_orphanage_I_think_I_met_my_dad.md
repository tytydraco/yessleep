“Evan, slow down!” 

Emma’s petulant whining echoed through the near-empty field. I rolled my eyes but, despite myself, her complaining always managed to stop me in my tracks. Something about that sound always had me digging my heels into the floor to a clumsy halt like a baby deer. 

“Soph’ll be mad if you skim your knees again.” She pointed out with a snooty huff, and I ruffled her hair in reply. 

“Yeah? Well, Soph’s not here, is she?” 

Emma opened her mouth to complain again, only to have her pigtails tousled once more by a soft breeze, carrying with it the acrid smell of freshly-trimmed grass. 

The familiar rickety gazebo stood not far from Emma and I, carrying with it the eerie yet familiar comfort of ruin. The fading remnants of white paint clung with its jealous embrace to rotting cedarwood, a stark and noticeable contrast against my late father’s greenhouse, which sat carefully and fastidiously tended to on the other end of the field. 

It had probably been years since the field had been tended to. Watching the overgrown, dull expanse of grass from outside my bedroom window finally be tended to was a bittersweet feeling, one that I’d come to associate with anything about my family. 

For the longest time, I’d assumed that the disappearance of my father would hang over my life forever. A ubiquitous, all-encompassing storm cloud that would hover over me until the day I die. The newspapers and missing person posters would forever haunt me; they’d haunt me almost as much as the fact that not a single soul – not even Emma, who was so close to him – knew where he went. 

Of course, Soph was often too busy taking care of Emma and I to show the greenhouse the care it needed. It had never bothered me when I was younger. When you’re a kid, you don’t really realise how much others sacrifice for you until the time comes to do the same yourself. As much as I knew, it had just been us – the three of us – for as long as I could remember. 

At least, that’s what I let myself believe. 

“I’m sorry, Evan. I’m just… so busy all the time.” 

I didn’t know what time it was. It wouldn’t have mattered, anyway. Judging from the darkness outside the window, it couldn’t have been far after we had just had a measly dinner.

It didn’t matter. Nothing did. Not when my little world fell apart. 

“I do the chores. I clean. I’ll do the dishes. I’ll even help Emma with her homework.” I bit my tongue in a vain attempt to stop my voice from trembling. “Soph, you— you can’t…”

I trailed off uselessly when I saw the look on my older sister’s face, though. Tired. Exhausted, to the point of collapse; I felt a sob bubble up from my throat, and I looked at my feet in shame. I couldn’t bear to look up at Soph’s expression – the way I knew it would soften, as it always did when I cried. 

“I promise, they’ll be nice to you,” Soph smiled weakly, putting a hand on my shoulder. For a bleak moment, I thought that she might cry, too. She sighed, smoothing out the creases of my shirt with a weary sigh, “but we can’t keep this up, Ev. I can’t keep this up. Not like this. I can’t even put food on the table. I don’t know how long I can bear it.”

Again, I bit my tongue. I bit back the want to yell. When her voice broke, I felt a little part of my heart go with it, too. My sister. My hardworking, selfless sister, who always knew what to say. The sight of it made my heart clench, and all the fight seemed to drain from my body.

An orphanage. Emma and me. It sounds so… lonely. 

“I need you to be strong, buddy. I know— I know, it’s hard, but I need you to be strong,” Soph pleaded in a small voice, as if she were speaking to a wild animal. “Can you do that, Ev? Can you do that for me?”

I wanted to argue. I wanted to scream. I wanted to hit her, to break something, to curse her out. To tell her we didn’t need her anyway, and that we’d be better without her. I wanted to tell her I hated her for what she did – but, I’m no liar. Never have been, for better or for worse.

“... I… Yeah. Okay.” I spoke numbly. 

Soph sobbed, and hugged me tightly. Somehow, though, I didn’t feel nearly as warm as I usually should have. I didn’t remember trudging upstairs that night. I didn’t remember sitting down on my bunk bed. I didn’t remember waking Emma, and I didn’t remember her sitting next to me and hugging me. I didn’t remember drifting off – and, when I did, I didn’t remember waking up. 

I know that I did, though. I know that, just a day later, we would be greeted with the moving van with a colourful logo plastered on the side. Palindrine Home. 

Emma sobbed like she was a little girl again when she hugged Soph goodbye, but I didn’t cry. It wasn’t that I didn’t want to, but I remembered Soph’s words from the other night. That’s right; I had to be strong. For her. For Emma. So, I pointedly avoided my sisters’ gazes as if they might burn me. Possibly because I knew they would burn me. 

Soph waved to us as the van departed, and I stubbornly faced away. Emma kept waving for a good thirty seconds after the van departed from our driveway, and that was it. Emma and me, with our bags packed. Alone – together, but alone. 

I was reminded achingly of our drives with Soph, those late night excursions that grandma would always harp on us about. When we would blast music and laugh so loud that our tummies hurt. 

“Evan, don’t cry.” The lady in the driver’s seat said warmly, probably seeing the expression on my face. 

I sniffed thickly, scowling and wiping my nose on my sleeve. Something about the lady’s voice had alarmed me in a way I couldn’t explain.

 “‘M not crying.” Was my weak protest. 

Emma looked up at this, sniffling herself, looking up at me with big, wet eyes. I felt myself soften, and I reminded myself that no matter how scared and confused I was, she felt it, too – if not more so. I wouldn’t let her see that it got to me, that I was scared. 

“Here at Palindrine, we promise to take the very best care of you,” The lady driving promised, glancing back at me from the front row seat. Her voice was warm. I don’t think I could ever forget that voice. “Don’t worry, okay? Mr Rowan has put you in good hands.”

A cap obscured her messy blonde hair, and I could read the words through the rearview mirror: Palindrine Home. Her skin was pale – not uncomfortably so or anything, but a fairness that caught my eye even in my periphery. 

Catching me staring, she flashed me a closed-mouthed smile and turned back, uttering something else about putting our seatbelts on. I don’t know; I was no longer listening. My stare was fixated entirely on her, like a crime scene I couldn’t pry my eyes from. 

More pressing to me was the vice that had suddenly clenched itself around my lungs. My heart hammered against my ribcage like a trapped animal, sent scratching in a panic at her words. 

Rowan was my dad’s name. Hearing it after all these years of treating it as a hushed topic – sweeping it under the rug – sent an unpleasant chill to my spine. 

Something – everything – about that woman was wrong. Imperceptibly so. Something so slight that, when I blinked and looked at her again, it seemed to disappear entirely. 

Emma must have sensed my fear. A second later, I felt her rest her head against my shoulder. I sighed, lightly tugging one of her pigtails tighter half-heartedly, chocking it up to be nothing but nerves. 

Maybe Soph had just told her to put us under his name. You know, to avoid confusion. Yeah, that was probably it. No need to antagonise a random woman who was probably just doing her job. I scolded myself and tried to forget my unease.

It wasn’t until we got out of the car and began to load our things off that I finally realised what had made me so uncomfortable. I frowned, locking eyes with myself through the rearview mirror. 

I could read the lady’s cap in the mirror. The words were backwards. 

The next few days passed me in a blur. 

Palendrine Home was a homely place – an old rickety building with peeling white paint and well-loved wooden stairs, bearing the wear and tear of a place weathered down with movement. 

The staff were nice, and the food was nice. There was nothing about the place I could point out my specific grievances with. Bitterly, though, and as much as I tried to suppress the thoughts, no member of staff’s polite, almost strained kindness could replace the warmth of Soph and the small, dusty refines of my own room. There was nothing inherently wrong with the place, no. Nothing else was missing safe for the fact that it wasn’t home. 

Emma and I slept in a single room, as we always did. Soph had promised us that she would visit often in her spare time, but she stopped coming after a while. It stopped hurting a while after. Days turned into weeks, and eventually, a month had passed since I had so much as seen my sister’s face.

Whatever. I’d think bitterly, staring at the bottom of Emma’s bunk at night. We don’t need her, anyway. 

Everything was fine. I told myself, everything was fine. Nothing was amiss; surely, sooner or later, I would find the place as much a home as the too-small house I’d lived in all my life. 

But I couldn’t.

Palindrine Home moved. It changed. Call me crazy, dub me insane, but the house seemed to change in inexplicable ways whenever I seemed to let my guard down for a second. 

First, it would be something small. A change in the decorations on the wallpaper. A green vase in the hallway would be yellow the next time I looked. The mirror in the corner of my room would seem longer some days than others. 

Then, it became more obvious. Like the place was testing the waters, knowing that I wouldn’t point it out. A member of staff’s name would change. The room at the end of the hallway next to ours inexplicably disappeared. The other children would whisper behind our backs, and eventually stop talking to us all together. And then, inexplicably, too, they would disappear. 

Then, Emma got sick. 

Much like anything else with the place, I didn’t even notice it at first. Her voice began to sound a bit rougher, like she’d just woken up. I urged her to drink some water, to which she simply nodded and downed her glass with just as much energy as usual.

“See?” She’d boast playfully, jabbing my ribs as she knew it’d make me laugh. “Worrywart.” 

“Yeah? You should be grateful.” I’d roll my eyes, jabbing her right back. I’d frown at the way her ribcage felt more obvious against her skin, like she’d lost a lot of weight. 

I brushed it off, though. I was careless.

One day, Emma began to write with her right hand. It sounds ridiculous, I know – but my sister was left-handed. She had always been left-handed, and adamantly bragged about it to whoever would listen that she could use the ‘special scissors’ in school. And yet, here she was. My sister. Writing with her right hand, as if she’d been doing it since birth. 

“What are you doing?” I asked her, trying hard to mask my alarm. 

She blinked, and looked up. Emma looked visibly sick now – paler, thinner – and her voice was still rough. Then, she shrugged. “Drawing.” 

I looked at her weirdly, wondering if I’d gone insane. “With your… right hand?” 

Emma stared at me again, with an expression that made me feel a bit too… watched. She looked back down at her own hands, before nodding. “Oh. Yeah.”

Then, as if it were the most normal thing in the world, Emma passed the pen to her left hand and continued drawing. A bitter feeling sat in the back of my throat, and I quietly excused myself to my room to no one in particular. 

Not long after that, Emma began to talk in her sleep. 

I’d always been a pretty light sleeper, which Soph had complained about as it meant it was impossible for her to sneak out at night alone. Now, however, it was more a curse than a sneaky way to get back at her. I would wake up in the middle of the night to mumblings coming from the top bunk. 

“... Watching…”

I turned over in bed. “Emma?”

There was no reply. Then;

“... Thank you…”

Her next words made my blood freeze.

“... Dad… He’s here…” 

Then, a few nights later, Emma began to sleepwalk, too. 

It had been a while since I’d been able to sleep soundly for a whole night. If it wasn’t for Emma’s sleep-induced mutterings, it was another creak from the house, the howling of the wind outside, or the sound of staff patrolling the hallway outside. Either way, I’d begun to get irritable, snapping at the smallest things. Always on edge. Paranoid. Like some part of me knew, subconsciously, that I shouldn’t feel safe. 

This particular night, I’d been woken up by an unfortunate pounding in my head. I groaned dryly, trying my best to sit up. My mouth felt so dry that it was hard to swallow and, when my vision finally cleared from the pain, I could register the odd lack of sound from above my bunk. Where’d Emma gone? To the bathroom, or something? 

I didn’t have to wonder for long. Swinging my legs over the side of the bed, I winced as I felt the frigid cold of the floor beneath my bare feet. From the corner of my eye, I saw a standing figure. 

Emma was standing, with her back towards me, staring into the mirror we had propped up in the corner of our room. Though the staff were kind and patient as ever, there was one rule they were particularly adamant on reinforcing – that was, that  the mirror in the corner was not to be moved, in any circumstance. I’d wondered why for a bit before letting it go. Now, however, the sense of curiosity had come back greater than ever. 

That, and the primal sort of fear. 

I caught a glimpse of Emma’s pale face in the mirror. Her eyes were softly open, just a crack, as if just waking, and she was standing very upright with her hands at her sides. A soft stream of moonlight cast itself over her skin, making her look almost ghostly, the veins on her eyelids more apparent than I’d remembered.

The floor creaked as I stepped out of bed.

Suddenly, her head whipped up, and her eyes snapped open. I jumped, my heart leaping into my throat as she locked eyes with me through the mirror. 

“E– Emma?” 

Her eyes – wild, frantic – stared right back at me. Watching. Slowly, delightedly, her lips curled into a grin. She smiled. She just stood there, grinning. Grinning, with more teeth than I remember her having. 

It was then that the possibility came to me that she hadn’t been sleep-talking to me at all – no. Somehow, impossibly, she had been talking to my dad. 

When she had said ‘he’s here’, she’d been talking about me. 

Emma claimed that she didn’t remember anything that morning, but I knew better. I sat a few seats away from her, a practice I had picked up not long after she’d first gotten sick. I ate quietly, but Emma just stared at her food. She didn’t eat much. In fact, it had been a while since I’d seen her eat at all. 

“Dad’s mad at you.” She said to me, suddenly.

I blinked, putting my fork down wearily. The lack of sleep was getting to me more than I’d like to admit, as every word swam through the haze in my mind. “Wh… What?” 

“He thinks you don’t notice him.” Emma stared at me. 

I almost wanted to laugh. What was I to say? Was I supposed to just remind my sick younger sister that our father was gone? Dead? 

“You’ll notice him.” I stared at my sister when she said the words, but Emma only stared right back. Had her eyes always been that colour? “I promise, you’ll notice him.”

I wish she’d been wrong. 

Last, was the dead man in the mirror. 

I’d gotten up in the middle of the night – like clockwork, now – to use the bathroom. Emma was mercifully still in her top bunk, breathing softly, fast asleep. Lifting myself up and off the bed, I felt the familiar sting of cool air. Our room was always cold, no matter how many times the staff assured us that they’d turn on the heating. 

In my peripheral vision, I caught a glimpse of the mahogany and silver frame of the mirror. Something drew me to it. I wanted – needed – to figure out what it was. The little voice in my head nagged at me. 

Everything in me wishes desperately that I’d never listened. 

I didn’t even see him at first. His skin was so pale that he seemed to blend in with the moonlight casting itself on the wall. He stared. Oh, he stared. He stared, and I finally understood why I had felt so watched the past few months. 

I could recognise that familiar face in the mirror anywhere. The slight curve of his lips, his dark hair, the stubble on his chin. The exact same plaid shirt that he had worn in the missing person’s posters. The scar on his left cheek. No one knew where my father had gone after his disappearance. Nobody found him. Not even a body. 

My heart dropped. Right then was when I decided to run away. My father’s scar was on his left cheek. Looking in the mirror, it was on his left cheek. My father’s scar. On his left cheek. 

Without much thought, I swung the nearest window open and jumped out. My bare feet padded on the grass and I ran as fast as I could. I ran until molten lead pumped in my veins in place of blood. I ran until my lungs burned. I wanted to leave that place behind for good. I wanted the entire building – Palindrine Home – to burn to the fucking ground. 

My father had a scar on his right cheek.

He had been in the room with me. 

I’ve been living with Soph ever since. She’s talked about sending me to counselling, but it’s not like our budget allows it. It’s not like I need it, either; I’m fine now. Everything’s fine, now that I’m back home, and back with Soph. The greenhouse in the field is just as pristine as ever, and it’s nice to watch the grass be mowed from my bedroom window. 

Soph recently got a new job that pays better, so she can work a few less hours in the day. She’s a lot more relaxed now, which puts me at ease. She spends more time on her own, tending to the greenhouse and stuff. Occasionally, though, we still go on those late night drives with snacks and music blaring. It’s as if the time never even passed. 

We never brought up Palendrine Home again after that. I think Soph realised how much I’d been afraid of the place, so she didn’t even ask me about it when I ran all the way back home. She’d just pretended like it never existed. She’d even gone as far as to search up the name, and probably hide all the results on her phone. That’s why I can’t find any records of it, no matter where I search. Soph’s so considerate. She always has been. 

Of course, she’s busy a lot of the time, so I have to do a lot of the housework. It’s tough, but we manage. We always have. It’s been the two of us for as long as I can remember. 

I’m worried about her, though. I think she’d been getting sick. She doesn’t eat much, and she’s looking paler by the day. Late at night, I’ve caught her covering the mirrors in the house, sitting down on our old couch and burying her head in her hands, whispering some mantra-like prayer. Sometimes, she even cries. 

I’m sure she’ll be fine, though. We’ll be alright. I’m getting better, and it’s only a matter of time before Soph does, too. 

One thing still bothers me, though. 

Sometimes, when I wake up at night to use the bathroom, I see him in the mirror. The dead man. Just a flicker in my periphery. Not really clear enough to be made out. 

Except, now, there’s a little girl standing next to him

And she’s waving at me, with her right hand.
