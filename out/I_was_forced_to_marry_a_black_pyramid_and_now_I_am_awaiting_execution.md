This is my last entry—an attempt to explain what happened on that fateful night at the Burning Tower. I keep hearing hymns of an ancient evil and echoes of a past I wish I could forget. I am currently on death row for the murder of six members of the Olmstead family—murders I didn’t commit. The evidence against me is irrefutable. But I know the truth—because the thing that did it is still whispering in the dark.



The truth about the "Burning Tower" has been obfuscated by the media. The newspapers painted a simple picture, but the truth was buried in the ashes. The horrors that unfolded in the tower quickly captured the public’s attention. Officials made swift arrests and tried to sweep the incident under the rug.



I met Mark when I moved to New York in the summer of 2021. He was my neighbor, and I first became acquainted with him when he held a puppet show at a nearby café. He was an easygoing person, with a way of making people comfortable—maybe too comfortable. Our friendship blossomed due to our mutual love of films. One day, he invited me to visit Holy Ranch for a special screening of a documentary titled *His Time*. What was promised to be a fun screening turned into a nightmare—one that I am still living.



The ranch was a dilapidated building on the verge of collapse. We had to walk a mile off the main road to reach it. Strangely, despite its crumbling exterior, the interior was well-kept. It felt like an odd location for a documentary screening, yet I mingled with the seven other people present.



Before the film began, Mark handed me a drink. The liquid shimmered an unnatural crimson. Mark assured me it was pomegranate juice, and it tasted like it.



What followed next was a blur. Time lost its meaning. I remember sitting next to Mark on a couch, facing the screen. I don’t recall much about the documentary—only an eerie horn blowing persistently throughout, just quiet enough to be overwhelming but impossible to ignore. That, and flashes of what looked like an inverted black pyramid floating in the air.



By the time the film ended, I was alone in the room. I felt nauseous. I must have blacked out multiple times.



I called out to Mark, but there was no response. My eyelids grew heavy. I don’t know when I dozed off, but the next time I opened my eyes, I was tied to a chair, facing six men dressed in black robes and grotesque goat masks, their horns seemingly reaching the ceiling.



“What… Where am I?”



Nobody spoke a word.



My heart pounded in my chest. A persistent ringing filled my ears. I scanned the room and, on the far right, I saw it—the black pyramid, inverted, floating in the air.



Was I dreaming? What was in the red drink?



My thoughts were interrupted when the door creaked open, and a man stepped inside. He was dressed differently. His robe was white, and his eyes were a deep, piercing blue.



“Mark,” I gasped. “What the hell is going on?”



Mark approached me, holding two horns filled with liquid.



“Drink from the horn of death and drink from the horn of life,” he said.



Two of the masked men rose, gripping my arms as Mark forced the drinks down my throat, one after the other.



My bindings were loosened, and I was beckoned to stand.



“No, please—no,” I protested.



From the corner of the room, the black pyramid began to rise, moving silently. Its shape seemed to shift, its angles warping and twisting impossibly. It stopped an inch above my head.



The moon was full, but its light was swallowed by the pyramid. A creeping hopelessness spread through me, invading every fiber of my being.



Mark blew both horns in quick succession. Flames roared to life in the fireplace. He began chanting in a language I didn’t understand. The pyramid descended, its tip touching my forehead—



Pain exploded in my skull. Visions flickered within the flames.



I saw a tall man in a loincloth and tunic prostrate before the pyramid, praying for emancipation. The pyramid hovered above him, emitting a low hum. I could feel the pain, the desperation that seized the man.



“Please,” he begged.



The vision shifted—a woman standing on a cliff, overlooking dark waters. Her screams were swallowed by the howling wind. Next to her lay two charred bodies.



Then, black, blue, and red flames conjured images of absolute terror.



I saw a man standing upon a field of fire, a sword in his hand, thousands of bodies at his feet. He wasn’t in control of his actions—I could feel it. At last, he collapsed to his knees as the pyramid ascended into the sky. The last image I saw was the man thrusting the blade of his sword into his heart.



The visions continued, growing harsher, more abrupt. And then—



I saw myself.



I stood before a towering building, a gun in my hand, the pyramid hovering menacingly above me. I climbed a long, winding staircase. At the top, a family was having dinner.



I raised my hand. The gunshot shattered the silence.



The father fought back, but he was no match for the cruelty that I possessed. At the end of the skirmish, I stood there with a broken arm and a broken mind.



I doused the place in gasoline and set it ablaze. How I wished I could throw myself into the fire. But the pyramid wouldn’t let me.



The flames kissed the night sky, casting twisted shadows over the barren land.



I wish this part were a dream. But I know the truth. I heard the sirens in the distance. My time was up. The moon was a black hole in the sky. And all that remains of the night is a small black pyramid—one I was forced to wed.



Soon, the warden will bring my last meal. My pain and suffering will end.



As I lay on this cold, hard bed, the only hope I have left is that death is truly the end of everything.
