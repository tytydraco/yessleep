if you are reading this then you need to follow my exact instruction to the T. it knows your there, it hasn't gotten in yet but it's trying.

it won't kill you but the fate you will suffer is far worse so you need to follow the following rules and instructions to prevent further invasion.

!FINISH READING THE RULES BEFORE STARTING TO FOLLOW THEM!

1. lock all doors and windows without making any noise. close your curtains. you must not be able to see the moon, stars or any of the outside tonight.
2. remove anything that is your favourite colour from your room. if you are not sure if something counts as the colour remove it anyway. you can't take this risk, it can hide in these items, and use them to link itself to you and that is the last thing you want. if the walls, floor, roof, or any furniture or appliances in your bedroom are this colour, remove them if possible, worst comes to worst move your bed to another room. if your bedframe is in this colour, buy a new one or just sleep on your mattress but it is vital you sleep in your usual home in a bedroom. that's where it knows you are at night.

**3.** go around your home. if any paintings seem gone or swapped places, any furniture seemed moved, whatever you do, do. not. put. it. back. it is making itself comfortable. you cannot aggravate it. if you have been noticing things being moved or something not where you left i t and you moved it back, it's too late to stop it. refer to rule 0 after setting your affairs in order. you have until nightfall

4. get a candle without scent and a flashlight and put the torch under your pillow, and the candle behind your curtains. this has no purpose past throwing it off its game. get a sharp knife, no shorter than 8cm long.

5. proceed with your day as if you have no idea it's there but do not leave your house. go to bed as normal. if it finds out you know, it's over. if you start to hear what sounds like harsh wind without feeling it at any point during the day, it's got you, refer to rule 0 and follow it do this asap. you may say goodbye very briefly. you will hear harsh wind and screeching getting closer and louder if you have not done rule 0 in time.

6. lay in bed as if sleeping but at no point allow your mind to drift. do not loose focus. do not fall asleep. if you fall asleep and are still self-aware, no matter how briefly you fell asleep, it's got you, in act rule 0 immediately. it can't reach you unless you sleep, but you will enrage it if it knows you faked it. if you open your eyes if you so much as even go to get out of bed, it will know. if you hear what sounds like harsh wind and screeching within your room after giving away your cover, you have under 10 seconds to act out rule 0. you enraged it.

!RULE 0!

take the knife you put in your room earlier today and slit you wrists neck and then stab yourself in the right eye in this order: right wrist short ways, right eye, neck, left wrist long ways.

if told to do this. you must. death is the best outcome for you now.

if the sun comes up in the morning and you have not had to do rule 0, and still know who and what you are, congratulations and well done! it couldn't use you as a gateway anymore. it didn't cross over. you're now safe again. for now.
