Considering how crappy everything pays right now, I was beyond hyped when I found an opening for a night janitor paying forty dollars an hour. In the rural ass, backwater swamp of Georgia, FORTY FUCKING DOLLARS AN HOUR?! TO CLEAN A CHURCH!? My little agnostic heart was ready to pull up for an altar call once they finally hired me. Good god, I see why they pay that high now.

It’s an easy enough schedule, too. I go in after church services or meetings, do some basic cleaning, and dip out. Takes maybe two or three hours every night and I do an afternoon clean on Sundays between services. So Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays I do a couple of late nights and it’s all good.  They told me they wanted a more thorough clean once a week, whatever day I choose, so I just decided to make my Wednesday nights the long ones. 

For forty bucks an hour, I’m not going to skimp either. I go over every goddamn inch of god’s good house with a fine toothcomb. I’m in here flipping more tables than Jesus to make sure they’re clean. It takes maybe seven hours or so to go through everything and it’s the easiest money I’ve ever made.

The place is old, from what they told me when I started it’s at least a couple of centuries, built in colonial times and renovated/rebuilt over the years on the same land. There’s a little cemetery out behind it too, though many of the graves are too worn down to read at this point. They haven’t had a new resident since the 1800s, I think.

One big sanctuary makes up most of the place, with a couple of little rooms in the back behind the main altar. A little door on the right side led back into a small hallway that smelled of mildew, with two doors on the left and one at the other end of the hall. Normally it would look like just your average old Protestant church in the south. Except it gets a little weird.

The first door on the left is painted blue. Not like a regular blue either, but like a bright cerulean. It’s both padlocked and deadbolted from the outside though, and on the pastor, William, has a key to it. When I was talking to the Anita, the treasurer who hired me, she told me she had no idea what was down there, but it was probably just old storage or something. I had to ask her again when she said “down there” because we’re in the heart of Georgia swamp country. If someone tries to make a basement around here they’re just going to get a room of crumbling mud and humidity. She assured me it was a cellar, though she only was told this by Pastor WIlliam.

My first Monday night clean went off without a problem. Went in and just ran a vacuum over the floor after a prayer group meeting. Tuesday I was off so I just stayed home and played Shadow of the Erdtree. Wednesday night after service, I went in around eight-thirty to start my cleaning. The only person left there was William at this point, but even then we only briefly passed each other as he was heading out. There was not much to say of the interaction though, we just explained pleasantries and he said he was off to get some shut-eye. I was just desperate to get into the church and out of the swamp heat.

I got in, walked to the little supply closet in the back of the sanctuary, and pulled out the vacuum. Wednesday night service wasn’t very crowded usually, just a few grandmas and the really devout couple of middle-aged men with their thick study bibles, so nothing was really dirty. I figured I could just milk the clock a little by dusting around and just fucking about in general. Might as well get some money while I’m here.

Vacuumed the sanctuary with no problem, and went to go get in the back hallway next. Probably a good time to mention the sanctuary has two sets of lights, one for the front altar area and the other for the actual pews and seating area. I only had the altar area lights because they were pretty damn bright. Until you get into the hallway at least, then you can barely see because the light only extends a few pews out.

Headphones in, music going, I just kept doing my cleaning. Ran down the hall, into the office next to the blue door, and even got to the pastor’s office while I was at it. I didn’t really notice anything until I looked up and out the door from the end of the hallway. I could see straight down the beige hall, blue door glowing bright in the fluorescent, into the sanctuary. I don’t think I’ve ever felt goosebumps like I did when I looked down that hall. 

At least seven or eight people were sitting in the pews just out of the light’s reach. They were all dressed in black, heads bowed so faces couldn’t be seen. I had to squint to see them almost, but they were definitely in the first two rows outside of the light. I don’t know if there was anything behind them… it was much darker but I was already shook. I briefly closed my eyes and reopened them, but they were still fucking there. 

Then there was a loud THUMP on the blue door. Like something being thrown hard against it, but there wasn’t a sound of it falling down either. I took my attention from the sanctuary to the blue door for just seconds, but it was long enough for everyone in the sanctuary to suddenly vanish. Nothing was there when I looked back, with it looking just like I had left it, not a soul around.

I kind of just shook it off as having like a late-night heeby-jeebies moment, you know? Except I finished up right there and started locking up. I’ve never really believed in any kind of supernatural, was religious in my younger days but had since really drifted off. I’ve always liked horror stuff but the idea of ghosts and shit in the real world? Please. Then I realized I had to turn the lights off at the altar and leave through the main sanctuary door. Swear I’m not scared of the dark but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t creeped out a little.  

I turned off the light, saw the moon shining through the stained glass, and immediately got a chill again. It’s been nearly a hundred degrees with full humidity the past few days, and it felt like I was being dunked in ice water. There wasn’t even anything there. I looked around, but nothing. Pulled my phone out and turned on the flashlight, making a quick pace toward the front doors. I swear, to whatever god you want to hold me to, that there was the sound of footsteps thudding along behind me. I swung the door open and practically dived through, never felt so fucking good to feel swamp heat on my skin. Slammed the damn thing behind me too, started to walk to my car then realized I didn’t lock it.

I thought about just not going back. Leaving it be until the next person got there on Friday for a prayer group. Then I realized the money I would lose if I didn’t do something right and lost this job. Look, rent is fuckin’ high right now, and I’ve gotta pay bills. So despite everything in me telling me to get the hell out, I turned around to go lock the door. The keys were in my hands jingling like wind chimes because I was shaking so damn hard. I finally got the key in and started to turn it when sound started reverberating from the sanctuary, a chorus with an organ swelling to a crescendo. I turned the key and yanked it out at the same time, almost taking the doorknob with me, and ran the hell out of there.

I could still hear it in my car when I started it and whipped out of the little dirt parking lot. Pretty sure I hit the ditch on the way out too but I sure as shit wasn’t just going to stop. It wasn’t until a few minutes into my drive that my hand finally loosened on the steering wheel and I realized what they were singing. I remember it from going to an old Baptist church with my grandma, they only did old hymnals and refused to use anything but a piano, but I remember the damn words. 

“Nothing can, for sin atone. Nothing but the blood of Jesus. Naught of good that I have done, nothing but the blood of Jesus.”

I asked Anita about it on Friday night when I went in. Made sure I was out by nightfall this time though. She said that she’d always thought there were angels around this place, keeping watch over the flock. Don’t know how angelic that sounds, but I guess she hasn’t been here alone after dark. When I told Pastor William about the thump coming from behind the blue door, he had the briefest flicker of something on his face. Then it was right back into smiling preacher mode, like fuckin’ Baby Billy. Told me there was a problem with possums digging into the basement and not finding their way out. 

I don’t know that I really believe him. That sounded bigger than any possum I’ve ever seen, even the one that gets into my garbage every night I started calling Round Ronald. No way a possum was going to get that fierce with a door. 

They canceled service Sunday so I was off. Going back in tonight after the prayer meetings and doing a little cleaning, so I’ll update if there’s anything that happens. I want to chalk it up to just being in a strange place at night but there’s no way those chills were based on nothing. This shit keeps up I might start praying while I’m there[…](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/op3l7rncxz)
