We got into the car without hesitation. The car started speeding towards the exit while the armed men shot at us.


I looked at the mirror and saw the driver was wearing a badge with a name on it.


"Daniela Sanchez........DS?" I asked 


"Yes , I'm the one who sent you that message" She replied 


"I don't really wanna interrupt but you guys should look back" said Jason in a terrified voice.


I looked back and there it was , Dave was on the UDA building. It then jumped towards us and hit the ground hard , But that didn't stop it from chasing us.


"SPEED UP!" I yelled at Daniela.


The car then sped up and went through the exit breaking through the closed gates.


"Is that thing still chasing us?" Daniela asked 


Jason and I looked back and there it was , Using its arms to launch itself towards the car.


"It's still after us , It's bad at changing direction so you need to change directions fast" said Jason.


Dave almost caught up to us , But the car suddenly made a sharp right turn. Dave didn't turn in time and crashed into a tree.


"I thought you lost it" I asked Jason


"I did , I don't know how it found us again" Jason replied


"Wait , Could it be that......" I thought to myself


"Bad news guys , There's no more turns" Daniela interrupted my thinking. 


There were no more turns and Dave got up and started getting closer again. It extended two of its arms and grabbed the back of the car. It was now stuck on the car.


"TRACEY DO SOMETHING!" Jason yelled at me.


I looked out of the window , It was slowly reducing its arms length to get close to us. I turned my left arm into a blade and cut it off.


Now Dave only had 2 arms , It was much slower in chasing us but fast enough to catch up soon.


"Take off your clothes" I said to Jason 


"Uhh don't you think that's a bit inappropriate, especially in this situation?" Jason replied looking at me weirdly.


"Just do it" I said to him.


"Geez There's a woman here you know" he replied.


"Fine, Keep your underwear and give me the knife you have." I said 


He reluctantly followed my instructions. I wrapped the knife in his clothes and threw it out of the window.


"Hey what are you thinking-" Jason stopped amidst speaking while looking back.


Dave had gone towards his clothes and stopped chasing us.


"Dave found us using your and the egg's smell , That should keep it off us for now" I explained.


"Here , Use this perfume to hide the smell" Daniela said as she handed me a perfume.


I used the perfume on Jason until nothing but the scent of the perfume could be smelled.


"So explain to us , Who are you and why are you helping us?" Jason asked Daniela.


"Well my name is Daniela Sanchez , I'm an UDA employee. That weird thing chasing us-" She said .


"Dave" Jason and I interrupted her together.


"Well Dave got out of his cell due to Jason breaking in and letting it out" she said.


"I was just curious!" Jason tried to defend himself.


"Anyways , Dave attacked me and my friend. Dave picked her up , Opened his mouth and opened her mouth wide. Then it put some red goo into her mouth to mouth which made her become that weird egg." She continued.


"I'm so sorry , But I had to kill her." Jason said in an apologetic tone.


"It's ok , It's not like she was her or even human anymore." Daniela reassured him.


I wondered if that's what Dave was trying to do to me too.


"Then suddenly UDA turned it's focus on finding you two instead of protecting the people which made me suspicious of their true intentions, Hence I sent Tracey that message."  She said.


"How did you know I'd check that e-mail address?" I asked her.


"I didn't , I just found your old email and hoped for the best." she replied.


Jason jumped in front and put an address 4 hours away into the GPS.


"We're going there." Jason announced.


"What's there?" Daniela and I asked.


"The pendrive" Jason replied.


**4 hours later**


We reached a wood cabin , Jason welcomed us inside.


"Please wait here while I get myself some clothes" Jason said to us.


We sat on the table and Jason went inside. He soon came out with a pendrive and 2 glasses of juice in his hand.


"I'll answer your questions, So ask me anything" he said as he sat down.


"Also you guys are probably exhausted so drink some juice" he said while putting the glass in front of us.


Daniela took a sip but I had to know what was going on first.


"What is Dave?" I asked.


"Didn't I tell you already? He's the result of injecting Unnatural DNA into a human named Dave." Jason replied.


"Why would UDA do that?" Daniela asked.


"Because that's their purpose" Jason replied.


We both looked at him confused.


"Project Unnatural Super Soldiers aka Project USS aims to make soldiers with supernatural abilities by mixing human and Unnatural DNA" Jason explained.


"Like me?" I interrupted.


"Imagine the power of your arm across the whole body , So stronger than you" he replied.


"Unnatural Detainment Association is just a cover for the public . The rules' true purpose is not to protect the people, But to help them capture Unnaturals so that they can research them and create war weapons. The true meaning of UDA is Unnatural Destructive Armory." Jason explained .


"Wait so the whole point of UDA is to make war weapons to take over the world or something?" I asked him.


"Exactly" Jason replied.


"I'm going to join the UNF" Jason announced.


"What?" I said.


"Take this , I don't want you to be tracking me after all." Jason said as he tossed the phone I gave him to me.


I was taken aback . I did not expect this at all.


"Tracey you won't get it. You're neither human nor Unnatural. You belong neither in the current world nor in the new world , Yet somehow you belong in both." Jason said.


"What're you trying to say?" I asked him.


"I'm leaving with the pendrive to join the UNF" Jason said as he stood up to leave.


"And you think I'll just let you leave?" I said as I turned my arm into a blade.


"Daniela hasn't been speaking for a while now , Hasn't she?" He pointed out.


I looked at Daniela , She was unconscious with bubbles coming from her mouth.


"The juice was poisoned , Ofcourse your investigator instincts saved you." He said.


"Are you seriously killing her?" I asked him furiously.


"No , I'm giving you a choice." Jason explained.


"You can either chase after me and let her die or get the antidote from the kitchen cabinet to save her." He said.


The pendrive is important, But so is her life. I didn't know what to do. Jason turned around and started walking towards the door.


"You know I've always wondered if that arm is the only monstrous part of you. The rest of you......is it still human or not?" He said as he went through the door.


*Go after Jason*


*The woman is useless now*


*GO GET THE PENDRIVE*


I ran towards.......the kitchen to get the antidote.


*Fool*


I got the antidote and injected it into Daniela. The bubbles from her mouth stopped , Jason didn't lie about the antidote atleast.


I then went outside looking for Jason , But he and the car were [gone.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnnaturalUniverse/s/qJ3z3xCq0i)
