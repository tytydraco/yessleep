Our neighbors have got this dog that doesn’t shut up. It whines and whines until there’s a clanking of metal and a thud, and then it’ll stop for a couple of hours. Sometimes it’ll be a day or two, so you can relish in the silence for as long as it lasts until it starts barking again.

I’ve always thought it sounded a little strange. The dog, I mean. The way it barks sounds kind of mangled, and sometimes I think it *really* doesn’t sound like a dog at all. It’s kind of like if you trained an animal to mimic a person attempting to sound like an animal. I don’t know if that makes any sense, but you get the gist.

I’ve never actually seen it. I think they keep it in the backyard somewhere. I can see a dog house over the fence that separates our property from theirs, so I’m guessing they just keep it chained up in there. And don’t get me wrong–I feel terrible for the thing. Some people just shouldn’t have pets, you know? I never got to have a dog of my own because my mom’s got allergies, and seeing someone else just disregard their animals like that makes me feel shitty. Sure, it’s a loud ass dog, but it’s still a living creature. I know *I* wouldn’t want to live a life like that.

The neighbors themselves are… well, I guess they’re your stereotypical nuclear family. The dad’s a businessman, mom stays at home. They’ve got two kids; one of them’s my age. I don’t really hang around the guy. Something about him just seems off to me. He looks like a living Ken doll, soulless eyes and everything. The whole family kind of looks like that, honestly. They’ve all got perfect rows of teeth and hair that’s never out of place. I’ve always wondered why they chose to live here of all places. It’s not exactly the picture-perfect suburbia they seem to have walked out of.

Anyway, yesterday, my mom tells me to go over there to get to know the son. I tell her I’m not going. She says it’s too late; they’re already expecting me.

So I go. It’s about 4:00 PM at that point, so I’m not planning on staying long. I knock on the door, and it opens quite literally five seconds later. The kid’s standing there. He looks squeaky clean–I swear he’s shining. He’s got on a polo and khakis as if he just popped out of a Vineyard Vines magazine. His hair is basically cemented to his head with the amount of gel holding the strands together.

He invites me in. His family’s all sitting in the living room, and they’ve all got perfect posture as they stare at the TV. They turn their heads and greet me, but they do it in a way that sounds like a church choir–all synchronized and stuff. Really weird shit.

We end up going to his room to play some video games, but I swear this kid has never picked up a damn controller before. I ask him if he’s got Call of Duty; he looks at me like I’ve got three heads. He picks up a similar game that I’ve never seen before this encounter nor ever again. I don’t think the title was in English. Actually, I don’t think it was in any language I could recognize. But it’s whatever–at this point, I really just want to get this whole thing over with.

He puts the disk into the console. The screen lights up with the weirdest color combination I could think of–I wanna say purple, orange, and green. Definitely *not* CoD. I have to shut my eyes for a good minute because the screen starts to flash so fast that I genuinely think I’m going to have a seizure if I stare at it for too long.

The game boots up, and I’ve got no idea how to play this thing. It doesn’t even look like a game–man, I don’t even know how to describe it. It looks like one of those freaky educational games you see on YouTube sometimes, except I’m pretty sure you’re supposed to shoot at some of the weird characters in this one. I don’t know. I didn’t end up figuring it out.

Now this whole time, the dog isn't barking. I honestly forget about it for a good while until we stop playing the whatever-the-fuck game, and it’s dead silent. I end up asking the guy about the dog, mostly questions about why it barks so much and why nobody ever sees it out. He says the dog’s got a mouth on it and isn’t a “good boy,” so it isn’t allowed out of its dog house much. Weird as fuck, but at this point I’m thinking the whole family’s just a bunch of freaks.

I ask the kid if I can see it. He thinks for a minute–like, *really* thinks. I didn’t think it was that big of a deal at the time, but I guess in retrospect I can kind of understand.

He agrees to take me out back as long as I’m quiet. I think "that’s a really goddamn strange thing to say," but I try to brush it off and do what he says. We creep down the stairs, making as little noise as possible. I’m kind of impressed with the stealth I have.

We get to the back patio door. He pulls it open slowly, then gestures that I walk through first. I tiptoe out of the house and into the backyard, and I hear him close the door behind him.

The dog house is a lot bigger than I’d seen from my own backyard. It actually kind of shocks me; it’s about the size of a chicken coop. It’s painted red so meticulously that it looks like a cartoon. Everything about this place is so ridiculously perfect that it makes my skin crawl.

“Buster” is written on a bone-shaped name plate above the opening. Typical dog name for a too-typical family. The kid walks in front of me and crouches down into the dog house. It’s too dark in there for me to see from the outside, so I can’t make out anything from where I’m standing. He pokes his head out and beckons me inside.

I get a weird feeling now. Weirder than how I was feeling while walking into the house or playing that bizarre video game. There’s a pit in my stomach that keeps sinking lower and lower, and suddenly I find that I really don’t want to see this dog.

But it’s a little too late now. I slowly crouch down and make my way through the opening. I still can’t really see, so I ask the kid if he’s got a flashlight or something. He seems nervous–not about the dog, but about something else. He doesn’t respond to me and instead keeps looking out of the opening, like he’s waiting for someone.

I think “whatever” and turn my phone’s flashlight on. I wish I hadn’t.

I point the light at the back of the dog house, and there’s Buster. He’s slouched against the wall, and his eyes are barely open. He’s got a huge red collar with his name on it hanging loosely around his neck, and it’s chained to a pole next to him.

The sight of him nearly knocks the wind out of me. His jaw is barely hanging on, and his tongue is missing. I guess that’s why he doesn’t bark anymore. There’s bruising all around his face, and his nose is snapped off. He’s completely naked, so I can see the large chunks of flesh that have been taken from his body. The empty holes left behind are oozing blood and plasma. It looks like the side of his head is beaten in; I wonder from what, then spot a bloody, rusted crowbar on the floor next to me.

The webs between his fingers are sliced so deeply that I can see the bone under the flaps of skin left over. There’s crusted blood where his fingernails should be, except they’ve been completely removed. My eyes drop to his feet to see if his toenails are missing too, but instead I’m met with two bleeding nubs of flesh and gore.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I want to cry, vomit, or scream. I end up not saying anything at all, not even when Buster does his best to lift his arm. I say nothing when he tries to reach out to me as his skin sags off his hand, and I say nothing when I run out of the dog house and hop over the fence.

I know I’m supposed to call the police. I will. I just need to get this out before something happens to me. Perfect people always get their way.

My mom brought in a piece of paper this morning. It was a poster. This is what it said:
