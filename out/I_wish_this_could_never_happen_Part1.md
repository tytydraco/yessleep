I wish this could never happen.
Part-1 

I'm working as a Journalist in a small area. Everyday has been quite casual for me, as on my working days I have recently found a dead body in a street which is 12km far-away from my working place. 

My colleagues are investigating what actually happened to the deceased person. 
Meanwhile, I discovered a scar on the body's right wrist that shows a cross mark. I requested that officials look into the matter. 

Later, officials justified the spot with lab data, claiming that it appeared after the victim died and that it may have been superficial burns. 

At first, I couldn't imagine how this could happen?
A few days later, someone reported a deceased guy laying in front of my house; could you please pay him a visit as soon as possible? Briskly went to the spot. 

I discovered the identical mark on his wrist that I had previously noticed. The test findings were equally unexpected.

I couldn't sleep that night, wondering how this could have happened. I came out of my house for fresh air. I took a chance and asked the person next door, "Have you heard of dead persons in our village with marks on wrist?" He said-
"Yes"

"Sir, if you don't mind, please explain to me?" I said.

"OK"

What was happeing isn't first time. I spontaneously replied WHAT?

"YES" the same thing occurred in our community a long time ago. Previously, almost ten bodies caught dead. We could'nt imagine what was happening to community. Thus, we began looking for hints.

 One day at night, we heard voices from the beach laughing madly. We all saw a person with no head who appears just like a human.

"WAIT- A PERSON WITH NO HEAD HOW IS POSSIBLE?"

We were afraid to go in-front of him, so we spoke about it and eventually came across a plan to wake him up. Suddenly, he vanished. We looked everywhere but found nothing except the tunnel.

 We all walked inside to find out why he was there. What is the cause of his disappearance?
We discovered ancient Greek writings scribbled on the walls and some particular posters that startled us, so we decided to totally seal the tunnel so that no one could access it. Then we assumed there would be no difficulty.

We were all relieved when we didn't uncover any deceased people in our neighborhood after many days. With a blank expression, he asked, "Why is this happening again?" He stated.

"I DON'T KNOW SIR," the conversation put to an end. He have warned to stay safe until unless the situation comes undercontrol.

She noded.

I walked away to my house and began examining the subject based on past reports, but I discovered nothing. Something is dreadful. I'm going to investigate. 

I merely glanced at his house and noticed a cross mark on his wall, but I didn't take it personally and moved away and fell asleep.
The following day, an unforeseen catastrophe occurred.
