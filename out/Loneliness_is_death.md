I (22F - call me Quinn) have a sister, Sam (20F) she’s a stunning and talented girl in every aspect of life. While I’m average, Sam shone like the sun. I  had always envied her, and the contrast between our personalities only made the jealousy worse, I felt bitter resentment toward my sister; she seemed to have luck with friends, even our parents liked her more - not that they’d say.

One day, I joined a dating app, desperate for some human connection in my life….yes, I’m aware I’m pathetic and lonely but every human needs some sort of attention. I’d had never had much luck with dating, and I wanted to fill the emptiness that I felt inside, it ached. So one day I created a profile, but my anonymity didn't seem to attract much attention. So, I’d resorted to using my sister's pictures, knowing that they would get her more matches, more interactions….you’d be right in the assumption I’d done this before, yes I’m a terrible person in that regard.

As the app started gaining momentum, I began to feel a sense of validation and attention that I had never experienced before. But things quickly took a turn for the worse, isn’t that how it always goes? Especially for women like me, even then I felt bitter because if it were my sister I doubt anything would’ve gone wrong.

My sister, Sam, began experiencing strange events, such as her social media being taken down, and feeling like she was being followed. What's more troubling was that Sam started receiving weird messages from different accounts, saying things like "Found you."

As time went on, I began to sense that something was amiss. I knew that the app I had been using was an AI app, I’d never expose my sisters pictures to real men I know the dangers…so surely what she faced was unrelated and just a natural consequence of being pretty, however, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was a connection between the app and what was happening to her sister…but how?

To make things even more terrifying for me, I began to feel like I was being followed. I kept seeing strange figures in the corner of my eye, but every time I turned to face them, they disappeared. I kept hearing the dogs barking at nothingness, felt a darkness outside of my bedroom windows or a sense of unease - perhaps guilt?

Sometimes…even though it terrified me, I felt less lonely for a second.

The fear and paranoia only deepened when one day, a strange package arrived for me. It was a small box, with no return address, and inside was a single note. The note simply read: "We know what you did."

I was at a loss for what to do. I knew that using  my sister's pictures was wrong, but I also don’t know how to make it right. Could the AI app have somehow connected to my sister's life? The repercussions might be severe.

I deleted the app, immediately and I mean was it wrong? Yes, but surely…they can’t be linked I mean who’s ever heard of sentient AI? It may not have been ethical but….I was seeking companionship and to fill the void in my heart.

I was going to tell my sister, I was…but the last text I’d received simply read 

“Loneliness is a pain that cuts deep, consuming your very being until nothing remains but a hollow shell. But fear not, my love. I am always here. Always. I will never leave you alone."

Something has been set in motion, and I’m not sure I can stop it…I’m not sure I want to…I can’t, I can’t be lonely again.

Sam has never been lonely, If she experienced it even once I’m  sure she’d understand…
