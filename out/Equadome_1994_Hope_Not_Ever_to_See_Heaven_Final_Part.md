Trigger Warnings: Sexual content (about a paragraph), Blood of course

I rolled onto my back and gazed at the red moon now fully visible in the hole in the crumbling cement ceiling. The walls inched in on me, spoke to me, let me know I was trapped and I was happy for it. My body count was at least two, maybe three with Crow missing. I longed for two things, it didn’t matter which: to be consumed by this place like my sister and Jason or to be numb to it all like Crow. Either meant freedom. I closed my eyes and waited.

“Dude, what the fuck are you doing?” Crow said shining the flashlight on me from the doorway.

“Where’d you go? What happened?” I jumped to my feet.

“I can’t really remember, but I found the blue rocks.” 

“Jason’s dead.”

“Really? Show me.”

We looked over the ledge, Jason’s body clinical and unreal like some funhouse attraction in the full light of the flashlight. 

“Fuck, that sucks,” Crow said. I thought she shrugged a little.  She stood in silence for a moment, turned, and came into the hall. I followed.

“That’s it? You have nothing else to say,” I said.

“The first stone is just a few rooms down.”

I followed her closely down the hall, back in a place between sleep and reality. The knape of her neck was pale now, clinical like Jason, like she was already dead. They came to a doorway.  

“What happened to you? Where'd you go?”I said. 

“Not this door, one more down…”

We came to the next room and entered. A rusted desk sat under a gutted electrical panel. 

“Jason…I can't believe he's…”

“I would have missed them, but I was really looking. Like, why blue stones, you know? Why not paint arrows on the wall like in the rest of the place? See there it is.” She pointed to a half-dollar sized stone, painted with what looked like sky blue nail polish.

“You were just a few rooms down? Could you hear us?” I asked

“It's like a fucking maze down here. But I kind of like it. There's so much to see. I like how I feel here. It’s like it’s closing in on you. Comforting, y’know?  I think I'll come back. Maybe I can find where those wannabee devil worshipers bring their victims…”

“Don't you even want to know what happened to Jason?” I was frustrated, raised my voice. She stopped, came in close, backed me up against the cold cement. 

“I already know.”

“You do?”

“Yeah, he fell over the edge and onto that pipe.”

“No, there was more. There were these like giant arms that pulled him down onto it.”

“Man, it was dark. You saw something really heavy. Your mind can play all sorts of tricks, y’know?” She smiled and tapped my nose. “You’re cute.”

“Crow, what the fuck is wrong with you? Why are you like this? Why’d you even come here with me?”

She pressed me against the wall. I could feel her tits compress against my chest. The butterfly knife in her pocket jabbed into my hip. Her lips were inches from mine.

“What’s wrong with me? What’s wrong with all of you,” her breath was rank and sweet with tobacco. “Shit happens. I mean, what’s the point? Do you think your sister cares? Jason certainly doesn’t care. They are nothing now. You drag yourself through all this shit. It’s pointless. All we have is now.”

She grabbed my dick through my jeans, hard and confusedly like she either wanted to fuck here or rip it off. I pushed her off of me. It felt good. 

“Let’s just find *Heaven,*” I pointed to a stone at the doorway of the next room.

“That’s all I’ve been trying to do,” she smiled playfully.

Together in silence, we followed the stones through a labyrinth of rooms and halls. A large room flooded with stale, fetid water we had to cross on soggy boards.  Rooms decaying into loose rock, littered with metal chairs and cigarette butts. Rooms muraled with vile words and beautiful, twisted creatures contorted in pleasure and pain. The further we followed the stones, the lower the ceilings and the more confined the rooms became until we stood before  a black hole smashed through the cement. 

Climbing through the hole, the space was so small we couldn’t stand upright. It was there that the trail of stones ended at the foot of a metal chute going upwards into the ceiling. Carved deeply into it were the words: *Hope not ever to see Heaven. I have come to lead you to the other shore: into eternal darkness: into fire and into ice.*

“This must be the place,” Crow said. 

“I’ll go first,” I grabbed the flashlight from her and squatted to get into the chute. It was no wider or deeper than a coffin, but went up further than the flashlight would show. I gripped the cold steel ladder welded to the side and began his climb. With each rung, the heat was cooling and for the first time since we entered the Equadome, I felt like I could breathe. I could hear Crow clamoring up the ladder below me. Through breaks in the chute, I could see them rising high above the main structure. We climbed and climbed, until I could see a rusted, holed ceiling and then I was out. I helped Crow from the chute. She smiled and curtseyed.

*Heaven* was only a room not much different than any other ruined, decayed room in the Equadome. The walls were cement but free of graffiti and framed by rusted steel columns. The roof was weathered tin with a jagged human-sized hole in the center. The red of the moon filled the room. At first look, it was benign, mundane at least for the Equadome and I couldn’t help to feel there might be no answers here. 

“Hey, what’s that?” Crow put her hand on mine and guided the flashlight to the center of the room.  A few old shoes, a bracelet, a necklace, a hair band, and many other small items were scattered across the floor just beneath the break in the roof. As we came closer, focused the flashlight, the items were speckled in umber and the stone floor beneath them was stained with a thick, coagulated rust. 

“Is that blood?” I said as I scanned for something that might be my sister’s, but found nothing.

“It could be. Do you see anything that was hers?” she said,  wrapping her arm around my waist.  I pushed her arm off, though already it was getting harder not to feel something for her. 

“What are you doing, Crow?” I turned to her. “You haven’t said shit to me in weeks. I don’t get you. Why now?”

“You know it’s hard for me, but it makes sense that I should love you.”

*Makes sense I should love you*. I didn’t know what that meant. The fact I considered it, considered her right now in the red of the moon with the red on my hands was further proof I was exactly where I deserved to be.

Before I could respond, there was a sound in the shadows far across the room like stone breaking and tumbling. And then a squishing like something moving through thick liquid, the air popping to escape. The heat returned, stronger still, emanating from the shadows. The room became putrid, sour, filling my nose and settling on the back of my throat. Crow’s hand came into mine, a tight boney grip that would be hard to break if I even wanted.

“What is that?” I said.

“He’s here,” she said. “Shut off the flashlight. You’ll see him better.” 

I didn’t know why, but I did.

She added another hand holding tighter. “Just give it a moment. Let your eyes adjust to the dark. The moonlight should be enough. You’ll see him. He wants to talk to you. Don’t be afraid. I’ve blocked the chute. You’ll have to talk to him. I know you’ll do the right thing. Remember me. Remember what I’ve been to you. Of anybody, I know you’ll do the right thing.”

She released my hand and I gazed into the void. I didn’t realize it, but I was stepping forward into it. I wanted to see what my sister saw. The darkness began to take shape. I could make out the outlines of the broken stone, like it had been ripped open from space. The walls flush with the blood moon, I could make out eyes in the tear, great eyes much larger than his–iodine yellow and malevolent, pulling me closer. *The only way out is through*. Though I was still feet away, two long arms came out silently from the hole and came around me, embracing me. Its clawed hands, each as long as my arm, settled on my shirtless back slippery as if covered with a thick mucus. As soon as our skins touched, the hands became taut.

I was somewhere else, places and times I had seen and not seen from perspectives that were mine and weren’t mine. Yet, I maintained myself, my own thoughts. I thought this might be how the creature saw things or perhaps I was being shown. My sister telling Crow about the baby in her car in a parking lot. I felt my sister’s despair. Crow was like static.  My sister and Crow passing a bottle of Jameson as they stumbled into the Equadome seeking distraction. My sister in *Heaven,* the creature’s arms around Crow.  A feeling of betrayal and terror. My sister ascending like the wind into the darkness. Crow was static. Crow holding me on the foot of my bed. A blank look on her face as I cried into her chest. Her dropping her spaghetti strap so my tears fell on bare breasts. Crow suggesting we go the Equadome. *Make it about his healing*, she thought. *He’s so fucking stupid*.  A feeling of superiority and pride in her. A feeling that she could engineer anything and this was power. Crow laughing silently in the dark halls. *Those fucking assholes*, she thought. *As long as you say something about hearing voices and scream, they’ll buy anything.* Her face peeking around the corner, waiting for her moment when I and Jason were closest to the shaft. The heat of an argument. Now was her chance. Rushing through the darkness, Crow pushing Jason over the ledge. Back in the hall, laughing to herself again in the darkness as Jason bled out . *They’re so fucking stupid*.  Leading him through rooms and halls following blue stones she put there herself several days prior. Climbing the ladder beneath me knowing she would soon be free, but a sort of let down she couldn’t quite put a finger on. Me looking at himself through Crow. Great arms wrapped around me as I convulsed. Crow feeling static.

I returned now face to face with the creature. Its mouth was clear in the crimson light, large enough to devour me with needled layered teeth wet with saliva. Its body filled the crack in the stone, so I couldn’t quite figure out its shape. I felt connected to it as if we were the same. I knew it didn’t seek to devour me, it didn’t feed like that. It hungered for games, for games and pain.

It spoke to me, yet it had no voice nor did it use anything as concrete as words. It spoke in ideas in quick succession that were soon erased and replaced by more out of order and then combined like a puzzle to create a complete picture. I was offered a choice–a choice the creature had fully equipped me to make, a choice where ignorance would ruin the game. I could stay with it forever in the Equadome or whatever rotted place it chose to go. I would still be himself, but absorbed and distorted into the creature. A comfort to it while it played its games. *What great fun we might have*, it seemed to say.  Or I could be free but Crow would die now, brutally, and I would have to return with another person to make this same choice within a year. The creature reminded me that Crow was given the same choice. 

I considered the choices carefully, the cruelty of it. Both were a sort of death, a death of myself only different parts–neither offered the mercy of oblivion. After what I was shown, I knew I had no blood on my hands, but I would when I returned with somebody else. It couldn’t be a bad person who would make the wrong choice or I’d be finished. No, I had to bring an innocent. The creature blinked, its iodine eyes disappearing for a moment. A thin wet tongue slopped through its teeth in anticipation of my answer. It occurred to me, the truth behind it all, the secret the creature held,  and the decision was made. 

I embraced it fully. Embraced the choice. Embraced the creature. Plunged my hands into the mucusy hole in the broken wall and touched its pimpled skin. I rested my forehead between its eyes..  The creature understood as if it were in me, slithering through my mind. I pulled back and gave it a nod to confirm what it already knew. Its yellowed teeth shone dimly through the darkness, resembling a twisted smile.

I looked to Crow. Our eyes locked in the red moonlight. I smiled ever so slightly and shrugged.  Her eyes widened and with a rush of wind, she was flung through the hole in the roof, her skin shredded by the rusted sharpened metal. Her silhouette held still against the red moon, drops of blood falling at my feet as if the moon itself had been stabbed by *Heaven*. I could hear a faint scream through the wind, I thought.  And then she was hurled out into the darkness far from my sight. The creature, satisfied, slipped from my hands and retreated into the black hole. 

I climbed down the metal chute, through the dark halls of Equadome, and out into the barren fields no longer afraid.   The sun peaked just above the treeline, touching warmly on my cheek. I knew the creature had no power outside of this place and I’d never return.  The hope of a hundred birds sang in the new day, a day where I could make anything happen, a day where I was finally *free as a crow*.
