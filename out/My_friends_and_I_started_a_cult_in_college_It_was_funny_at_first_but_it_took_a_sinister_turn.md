*'Ten.'*

*'Are you sure?'*

*'Yeah. I counted them many times, mom. I'm sure.'*

*I take a sharp breath, moving my thumb across the edge of the phone. My hand is slippery from the sweat, and my eyes twitch and dart from a corner of the room to another, like an addict. 'Okay.'*

*'Does that mean something good?' my 12 year old daughter, Rhea, asks from the other line.*

*I don't know what to tell her. I feel something dripping on the back of my neck, probably sweat from my hair. Or blood. 'Yeah, it's fine.'*

*'Ok, bye.'*

*'Bye, honey.'*

*That morning, when I left home, I knew what I had to do. I just hoped they'd start showing up after my return, not before, when Rhea and Jocelyn were home alone. I'd called Rhea and asked her to tell me how many... 'clients' had shown up at out door, waiting patiently. That's what I keep telling her: mommy sells newspapers, and she keeps them in the basement, where she prints them. That's why people keep showing up at our house.*

*When she said 10 people had already gotten there, my heart skipped a beat. That's too many. Way too many.*

*I understand they're eager, but stalking us?*

*With a sigh, I wipe my phone of the blood and put it in my pocket. My black boots are drowning in his sticky, slippery blood. I wish his blood was red. Over the last years, it just keeps getting darker.*

*His open eyes stare right into my soul. He's my Mona Lisa, watching me no matter where I go around the room, my bloody work of art. 'Til death do us part... and now we've parted, at least for another year.*

*Until I have to kill him again, because this fucking guy just keeps coming back.*

*After I'm done with the cleanup, I get behind the wheel and head south. That's what we agreed on long ago, when I still loved him. I like to say he lost his love for me throughout the years, but I know his heart never felt it.*

*The road is long and hard to get through. I can feel his eyes from the backseat and my knuckles are white from gripping the wheel too hard. Trees surround us - I'd have nowhere to go, and no one would hear me scream if I left the car. It keeps getting harder to carry out this fucking burden. I just hope I can put it to an end.*

*I keep getting flashbacks of what used to be. I'll fill you in. I don't even know why I chose this forum - I guess I hoped our followers would see it. I don't even care if they kill us anymore.*

*This rouse has been going for over 15 years.*

------------------------

It was 2009 and we were sophomores in college. The parties back then were more authentic - no one bothered to hide, or lie, or make themselves something they were not. Me, Juliet, Adam, Ophelia and Anthony used to hang out all the time. 

This one party was back at this sorority house that I can't really remember the name of. We were all drunk off our faces and, in the dark of the night, when the music and the heat of other people had worn out, we resided to ghost stories and the so-called 'deep-talk'. Anthony had his arm around me and was staring into the distance, while telling these freshmen about a 'notorious' campus legend he was actually making up on the spot.

At one point, someone asked us how we came to know each other. Instead of the real answer (Juliet and Ophelia were sisters, and Adam and Anthony were mine and Julie's boyfriends), Anthony leaned in, eyes wide and sparkling, and lowered his voice.

'We're in a cult.'

The freshman, also drunk off his face, laughed and wiped his face. 'Yeah, ok.'

'You didn't tell them, did you?' I asked Anthony, pulling myself away from his embrace. 

'It's no harm, relax. It's not like I'm recruiting them or something.'

Even though Julie and Oph hadn't been close enough to hear, they caught on the joke. 'Look,' Julie began, 'if you wanna laugh it's fine. It's not that big of a deal, anyway. Not like we've killed somebody, yet.'

'But we're planning to.' Oph said.

Anthony shushed her. 'It's late. Let's all go home.'

He gave us a fake warning look, but Ophelia's face was gleaming, as she continued. 'It's really a matter of time. You don't know what someone can do with enough ambition.'

At that point, some kid who we'd assumed had passed out on the couch lifted his head. 'What the fuck are you guys talking about?'

I let out a sigh. 'I thought you were sleeping. You shouldn't have brought it up, Tony.'

'Brought what up?' some other girl asked, passing by.

'We're in a cult,' Anthony said again. 'I don't get why you're all so secretive about it. It's the most fun I've had in my life.'

Some didn't believe us and told us to fuck off, but the few that did leaned in. This girl, Laura, had heard us say we wanted to kill someone and, even if I suspect she didn't really believe in our 'cult', started asking us questions, thinking we were some deranged people who were actually planning a murder. 

'So, what is this cult about? What do you worship?' 

'Oh, it's kind of a long story. Wouldn't even know how to explain it.' I sighed.

'Is it a deity? A god?'

Adam's face dropped. 'We don't believe in *gods.*' he spat out.

'Then? Is one of you the leader?"

'No,' I replied at the same time as Julie, who had said 'Yes'.

'I mean, it's not that easy. None of us met him yet. We are only a few of the members who get to talk to him. The others are initiates.'

The laughter around us started to dissolve, as more and more people gathered around, believers or non-believers, who just needed something entertaining to listen to. 

At some point, one guy, Ronan, in an attempt to poke fun at us, asked us if we were actually just organizing orgies. Anthony turned to him, his mind damp from alcohol, and slapped him across the face. 

The room fell silent.

'You think we're joking? People *die* trying to get in, and you think we're some weird sex-freak club who worship some... old guy? You have no idea, and even if you had, you wouldn't accept it. Some of you are that close-minded. You wouldn't know what it takes to be part of this. You're all in your 20s and walk around thinking you have some purpose on this earth, only to end up working 9 to 5s and shooting yourselves in the head at 40. 

We don't strive for heaven and we don't fear hell. Our destiny is much more than a simple coin toss and trying to make it off the naughty list. There is no crime on this earth that isn't excusable, but even the smallest of deeds can be punished. We are loyal to ourselves and to him and him only. No other gods. No statues.'

His passion had startled us, but it was amusing. Anthony then added: 'if you want to know what it's like to actually be part of something greater, to guard your soul and lead it where it *needs* to be, then I'm here for any questions.'

'What about killing people?' someone asked in the back.

Anthony smiled. 'Every cult has objectives. We move towards evolution, whatever the cost.'

-----------------------

The next week had passed normally, and we laughed off our 'cult'. It became an inside joke between us, but no one really asked us about it. I think most people had forgotten our late night talk.

That was until March 11th, when a student, Sonya, threw herself off the 7th floor of the science building.

She had committed suicide, and there wasn't enough proof to pin it on anyone else. However, as I was walking to my dorm one night after dark, someone stopped me. I recognized the kid from the party.

'Did you do it?'

'What?'

'Did you kill her? Your... cult?'

My eyes widened, and his grip on my hand tightened. 'I'm... I'm not a cop. It's ok. I want in.'

'What?'

'I want in. Your cult. I'll... I'll pay you.'

'That was a joke, Christian. We aren't actually in a *cult.* We were drunk as shit and wanted to make fun of you.'

He let go of my hand. 'You don't need to hide from me. Don't try to play it off.'

I tried to walk away, but he grabbed me again. 'Look, we're really similar. I have had... urges throughout all my life. It stared with animals. I just wish I could do something greater with them. I want in. I want to help you towards your great plan. I don't know what it is that you worship, but I'm eager to find out.'

I freaked out and, seeing I could not escape his desperate pleas, I told him to just talk to Anthony. 

When I met my boyfriend, a few days later, he had a radiating smile and took me to a way fancier diner than what we frequented. 

'Hm, what's up with you? You've suddenly got money, or what? Were you a millionaire in secret?'

He shook his head. 'Remember that Christian kid?'

I frowned. That counted as an answer to him, who continued.

'He bought the whole cult thing. His dad died a while ago and he's got a fucking fortune on his hands. I told him I'd make him an... initiate if he made a donation to *help our research*.'

'What the fuck? What research? You don't even know what-'

'Look, he agreed to make donations from time to time, and I just blabbered about out cause and whatever. It's not like he'll go to the police.'

'He can! Some girl *died* and we indirectly tied ourselves to it, and now we're taking advantage of him and stealing his money? Are you insane?'

'The kid's a fucking psychopath already! He killed his dad, Emma. He says anything, I'll report him.'

'You have no proof.'

'He admitted it to me.'

I turned my head away, and he grabbed my hand. 'Thousands of dollars,' he said, kissing me on the cheek.

'Do the others know?'

'I'll tell them. Oh, and I gave our *deity* a name. Everything needs a name, if we're gonna worship it.'

'What is it?'

'Kannu. It came to me in a dream,' he said, and I couldn't tell if he was joking or not.

Over the next 3 years, out cult gathered more followers. The cult of Kannu, whose followers had no name and no race, no age, no gender. We were individuals striving to not be judged, and lived free, by our own rules. Me, Ophelia, Juliet, Adam and Anthony were the five fingers of Kannu's hand, and each of us had our undisclosed duties towards the deity, that involved donations from the other members. It was all thanks to Anthony, who's preacher qualities were undeniable. 

The 'audience' helped, too - the cult mostly seeked isolated individuals with urges just like Christians, who wanted to believe their anomalies in thinking could help towards a greater cause. We'd tell them to hold back their killer instincts and wait for our call (which never came), and keep donating to our research. Authorities never caught on it - how could some serial-killer wannabe report us to the police? What could they say?

'Yeah, these guys took all my money and I haven't killed anyone yet.'

Seriously. Everything went really well in those 3 years. We'd made a lot of money off lying to people, and we even put some effort into this 'cult'. Me and Ophelia drew pictures, *visions* of Kannu, and claimed to read 'articles' to people of his doings in the past. We'd search up murders and disappearances and tie them to him.

Christian, our very first follower, had started doing drugs and claiming to see him. He was a devoted member and made donation after donation, treating us like gods and saying he was awaiting our call. He'd send us sketches of his 'visions', which were mostly bloodied corpses and screaming faces. He kept drawing faces over and over again, and one stood out in particular - Ophelia's, who was terribly annoyed.

'I knew he was in love with me, but I really don't like his drawings.'

-------------------

*Tears are streaming down my face as I hit the gas. In the backseat, his eyes are shiny, as if he'd been crying. he tries to hum to calm me down, but his throat is slit and the air gushes out of the cut, making him sound like a pig.*

-------------------

Ophelia and I were roommates. I came home, one night, and found the door open. Not unlocked. Opened.

Her body was laying in her bed, whose sheets had turned red, and her head was missing. That's all I remember. I don't know much else - everything was a blur after that. We couldn't find the head, and I threw out all of my red clothes, because I couldn't stand the color anymore. 

Christian said Kannu came to him in a vision and asked him to kill her. The police had caught him drugged off his ass five days later and arrested him - 25 to life. No one cared that he'd spit out our names - they all thought he was a junkie. 

When I visited him in prison a few weeks later, I did it just to ask him where he'd put the head. He said he left her intact. 'I stabbed her. I didn't cut her throat.'

That was our last conversation with him, before he killed himself in prison.

Grief does weird things to you. Anthony and I got married that year, and so did Julie and Adam. We thought that might help us stay united. It didn't.

The problem is, when you try to stop a cult, your followers might refuse. Telling them it had been a ruse for so long was out of the question. Instead, we crowned Christian as a hero and told them we'd go on a hiatus, as Kannu had received his sacrifice. 

The hiatus didn't last long, because the majority of our audience had a certain thirst for blood and began stalking us and our families. Pregnant with Rhea, I told Anthony he needed to do something.

The cult began its activity again, this time with some strict rules: no one, apart from the four of us, could have visions. No one was to act on their instincts unless Kannu asked them, and Kannu only talked to the four of us. The symbol of the cult was a hand with it's pinky finger missing, symbolizing Ophelia's death. I began seeing these necklaces everywhere with the hand on them, and by now we'd gathered about 1000 followers. With their monthly donations, we could give up working and retire.

Even though everything had left a sour taste on me, I accepted this wicked way of living, knowing there was no way to back out now. There was no corner on this earth where we could go and hide, because these psychopaths could find us. 

I didn't know at the time, but we would find Ophelia's head way later. 

Nine years later, in fact. Intact. And, in that same day, Anthony would die for the first time because, turns out, when you mess with blood magic, even if you make up a name like Kannu, the real deity finds you. No matter what name you give it.

--------------------

*I have to stop now. If I speak too much about this, I fear it will feel... summoned. More than I already have to summon it.*

*I need you to know that I'm doing this for my kids.*

*As I step into the gas station, I fear the cashier will look over my shoulder and see Anthony's body in the car. Then, I see the cashier's hand necklace with a missing pinky finger, and I realize I have nothing to worry about.*
