I’ve already recovered from the hospital and my body is healthy again. I can’t quite say the same thing about my mind though. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t erase the trauma. I can still function in society and I found a new job. A peaceful one, involving taking care of injured animals. But every once in a while, I get bits of memories of when I fought those “things”. I don’t know what they were, all I know is that they can bleed.

A few years ago, I was an underground fighter. I used my fists for a living, battering faces just to buy food. I wasn’t famous or anything like that, so you wouldn’t recognize me if I were to bump into you. I never had a loss before I was offered a slightly better paycheck. 

I was the tallest of the fighters in the local rings, standing at 6'5, and trained Muay Thai from an immigrant. I was a big man and the promoters watched me knock someone out with a knee to the jaw. One time, I managed to punch the lights out of two guys at the same time. I was able to take down skilled fighters with my sheer size.

You might think I’m someone who racked up a lot of wins. But most of the time, I was paid to lose. It became my job to lose. You see, the promoters (usually paid by gangs and triads) wanted their guys to earn a reputation. They wanted them to be “tough” and “intimidating” and all that jazz. That’s where I come in. My usual wages could barely buy me food to last a week. This “jobber” money was enough to feed me and my mother for almost a month. She was old and sick. She looked more like a cancer-stricken crone than the beautiful D-List actress she used to be.

We were in debt to the triad. They were draining our money at least twice a month or else they’d kill us both.

I hated losing. I hated fighting too. But at that time, it was the only way.

Then I received an invitation.

I was visited by this veteran. He told me that I have potential. He saw how I took hits and he could tell that my opponents can’t hurt me no matter how hard they try. He said I wasn’t good at pretending to lose though. He gave me a card and told me to go to this discreet location (I can’t name it for my safety). He said the card expires within three days so I gotta be there, fast.

I was the last person to arrive at the location. 

I walked into the warehouse, my boots echoing on the concrete floor. The air was thick with dust, the kind that gets into your throat and lingers there like an uninvited guest. Flickering yellow lights hung from the rafters, sickly shadows twisted and stretched like they had a mind of their own. The place smelled like old oil, sweat, and something metallic that made my stomach tighten.

There were others in that warehouse. Some, I recognize as fighters from the same underground rings I go to. There was Jack, he was 7 feet tall and way heavier. He was standing in the corner, his arms crossed. I could also see Jill. She was bouncing lightly on the balls of her feet. She’s a 5-footer, and to me, that’s dwarf height. She was also considered a “freak” because her genetics allowed her to gain a lot of muscle when working out. Seriously, you can mistake Jill as a male bodybuilder at first glance. Her physique bulged even under the heavy hoodie she wore. There were also several other guys I didn’t recognize. Some were big, some were small, but all of us were brought here for a purpose.

The pay they promised was good, I could finally buy a proper house for me and my mother. I can also finally afford her much-needed medication. The best part though, is what they told us. I know I don’t like fighting, but I do love to win. And they told us to fight… to win. No holding back.

But it wasn’t against each other. We’re here to fight against those “*things”*.

We were led to a makeshift fighting pit.

The ring sat in the center of the warehouse, a crude arena of thick ropes strung around metal posts. The floor was worn, patched up with pieces of old rubber matting that didn’t quite fit together, gaps here and there revealing the scarred wood underneath. It looked like a place built for violence, not sport—brutal, unforgiving. Around the ring, crates and barrels were stacked high, some leaning as if they’d been tossed there in a rush.

We all stepped into the pit, throwing our shirts off on the floor, revealing our bare chests. Yes, including Jill. Men in tactical gear welcomed us, saying that we were fighting on behalf of… 

**\[my lawyer advised me not to name the group\]** 

…of some Private Military Company.

Some eggheads in white coats pulled up a cage. There were clangs and metal grating against concrete. At first, I couldn’t make out what’s inside it. My eyes narrowed against the light. At first, it looked like just a hunched shadow, but then the creature shifted, it was a deer and a man at the same time. 

They were combined into some sort of amalgamation between man and beast.

Its head had rough, white antlers, and its limbs ended in claws that were too long and sharp to be human. Thick fur and tangled hair lined its back, and its ribs rose and fell with each shallow breath. Its thin skin stretched over muscles that pulsated like a human heart. Its eyes darted around, wide and afraid, as if it knew it was something that shouldn’t exist.

What the fuck is that? What kind of fucked up shit did these scientists do? Can our fists even work against that thing? Those questions never crossed my mind at that time.

All I ever thought to myself was… Let’s go, ring the bell!

The handlers backed away, the door swung open, and it was loose. 

They released the deer man, a Wendigo as Jill called it. 

There were ten of us and only one of him. Its face looked terrified like it didn’t want to fight. Then, the eggheads shot it in the ass with a dart. The Wendigo let out a bone-chilling roar, its jaw stretching wide as it turned its wild gaze on us. It charged, claws scraping across the concrete as it zeroed in on the closest fighter. 

The Wendigo tore into him before he could react, a brutal display that should have been my reality check. But the adrenaline only made me think of my mother. 

I fight where I’m told, and I will win where I fight.

Jack lunged forward, wrapping his thick arms around the beast’s neck in a rear-naked choke, his muscles straining as he tried to keep it pinned. The others piled on, gripping its limbs, pulling it down. Jill stomped forward and slammed her boot into its face, her heel grinding against its jaw, forcing its head into the concrete. The Wendigo—a hulking, eight-foot creature of twisted rage—thrashed beneath the weight of us, its claws slashing through the air in blind fury. A sudden swipe connected, tearing into one of the fighters, who fell back, blood spraying across the ring.

Panic shot through the rest of us. A few broke rank, fleeing the chaos, scrambling toward the exit. But before they reached it, gunfire cracked from the shadows above. Guards on the second-floor catwalk had their orders, and the deserters were cut down where they stood.

The Wendigo twisted free, driving a brutal elbow into Jack’s temple, dropping him like a stone. It swung its massive arm on Jill, sending her flying across the room. She crashed into a stack of crates, the impact echoing through the warehouse. 

Now, it was just me and that monster.

I planted my left foot forward, fists hovering just above my brow, clenched fingers facing each other. My legs bent slightly, grounding me, the weight evenly spread between them—a stance built for balance, ready for power. I could feel the tension coil in my muscles, every part of me braced for the fight.

That freak of nature rushed like a madman. It probably took less than half a second when I delivered a low kick to its knee. Its leg buckled, and it stumbled forward, unable to stop its own weight and momentum. I spun around and drove my foot into its skull, and it hit the ground hard, its antlers scraping against the concrete with an ear-piercing grind. Before it could recover, I stomped down, feeling bone give under my boot. I threw myself on top, pinning its flailing arms beneath my knees. My fists came down one after another, smashing into its face. Blood sprayed across my knuckles and splattered onto the filthy floor. I didn’t stop—each punch landed harder, again and again, until I was smeared with red.

Then I heard it scream.

*“HELP ME!”*

Or at least that’s what it sounded like. The words were garbled, but the plea was unmistakable, a shred of humanity buried in that monstrous voice. My fists froze, breath hitching as I stared into its terrified eyes. For a moment, it almost looked... human.

I grabbed the Wendigo by the antlers and twisted its neck. I felt the crack echo through my bones, silencing the monster forever.

Jack and Jill pushed themselves up on their knees, wincing as they brushed dirt and blood from their bruised skin. Dark patches had already started to bloom across their arms and faces—painful, but nothing that would keep them down. Around us, the soldiers broke into slow, approving claps, their applause hollow and indifferent. A pair of scientists hauled the creature’s limp body across the floor, leaving a slick trail of blood smeared over the concrete.

We were approached by a man in his mid-40s. He had quite an orange complexion that looked darker to the harsh lighting. A cigar jutted from the corner of his mouth, trailing a thin wisp of smoke as he sized us up. His tactical gear matched that of the guards above, though a bright yellow insignia glinted on his shoulder—something that marked him as above the rest. He looked us over with a hard gaze, the kind that didn’t need words to command attention.

*“You were good fighters,”* he said. *“Keep this up and you’ll be rich.”*

The medics treated our injuries later that night. Some businessmen in suits made us sign different contracts and NDAs. There was good pay too, one that was enough to buy my family a big house *(which I did).*

I was able to afford some healthcare for my sick mother and we’ve already forgotten what it's like to live in a dirty apartment. She was worried that I could die from these stupid fights, so she urged me to quit. She said I can find a decent job.

But I can’t quit. It’s not like they’ll kill me if I quit… but I don’t want to quit.

I was addicted to winning. It was like a drug. I was paid to lose for so long, that this new gig allowed me to let loose.

I told her I could make my own decisions, that I could take care of myself like I took care of her. She told me that there wouldn’t be a ***“me”*** to take care of her if I continued this. I merely assured her that there was nothing to worry about.

About a week later, I received another call. The PMC arranged a fight upstate, in some foreign lab set up by the Soviets long ago. Don’t bother googling it. Nobody knew about the lab except them… and now me.

After a six-hour bus ride, I followed the map and traveled by foot into the forest. My feet ached from three hours of trudging through thick underbrush, every step sinking into the wet earth as I fought against the tangled mess of branches and brambles. No vehicle could make it through those paths—just the sound of my breath and the occasional snap of a twig underfoot, as if the forest itself were trying to slow me down. Getting here had been a battle in itself.

When I finally spotted the bunker, it looked like it had been forgotten by time, abandoned for who knows how long. The door, rusted and hanging off its hinges, groaned as I pushed it open, its creak echoing down the empty concrete hallway. Ahead, a staircase spiraled down into darkness, and at the bottom, a blue door loomed, marked with a faded biohazard symbol.

As I stepped through the blue door, a blast of cold air greeted me. The floor shone under harsh, white lights, smooth and polished. To the left, long rows of clear glass tanks held glowing liquids, each one softly bubbling like a soda. Each step felt strange. It was like I was in a place too clean for what we were about to do. The walls stretched up in bright, sterile white, bare except for the cameras and sensors fixed at every angle. Their dark lenses followed us, silent but foreboding. The room had an odd, clinical chill—like walking into an oversized, spotless bathroom. 

It wasn’t built for brawls or violence; it felt like a lab, a place meant for experiments, not real fights.

I stepped into the "arena" and the emptiness swallowed me whole. The hangar stretched far beyond, large enough to house a plane, its sheer size making me feel small. Fluorescent lights glared down from the vaulted ceiling, their cold brightness flooding every corner, making our shadows sharper than steel. Beneath me, the bare tiles were smooth and unfriendly, their chill biting through my boots, a silent reminder that this place wasn’t meant for comfort.

Jack and Jill entered a few minutes later. The three of us stood like giants among the eggheads and armed guards. Okay, maybe except for Jill on the “giant” part but she’s still got more muscle than any of the soldiers in the room.

They told us to wait.

*“What do you think they’re cookin’ up this time?”* Jill asked, shadowboxing with a few jabs and a sharp hook. *“Another Wendigo, or maybe something with wings?”*

*“Doesn’t matter,”* Jack replied, crunching down on a protein bar he’d brought from home. *“We’ll kill it either way.*

I’ve seen Jack fight a few times in the underground. One time, he was paid to lose to me. Yep, I got a share of unfair wins too, sometimes. The promoters didn’t want people to be suspicious of the smaller guys they secretly rigged to win. At first, that fight was clean. A punch here and there, and supposedly a takedown. But Jack’s ego couldn’t handle it. He’s not gonna lose, even if that means he’s not getting paid. He managed to kick me in the face to avoid my predictable attack. Now I was in a real fight because I’m not just gonna stand there and take it. We exchanged punches but I almost took him down with a kick to the jaw. He made a reckless counter-punch mid-recovery and I grappled him and locked him in an arm-bar. You know what’s worse than losing on purpose? Actually losing. Jack tapped out and I was declared the winner. Later he refused the money that the promoters tried to give him. He didn’t want the money. Rumors were saying he wasn’t there for the cash.

I couldn’t help but be intrigued, so I went to ask the blonde giant. 

*“You know, Jack, I’m curious—why’d you get into this whole underground fighting thing? There were rumors that you come from a rich family, that your dad’s always rubbing elbows with politicians.”*

Jack’s gaze darkened as he chewed, and after a beat, he answered. *“I don’t want to be like my father. He was weak.”*

*“Cold stuff, man,”* said Jill as she did some jumping jacks.

Jack groaned, almost disinterested.

*“I just wonder how much longer we’ll be stuck doing this shit,”* Jill said, wiping the sweat from her brow before continuing to deliver a one-two punch into the air. *“This whole setup is starting to feel too... clinical. Like we’re just part of some twisted science experiment.”*

Jack shot her a glance, eyes half-lidded. *“You think too much. This is just business. We fight, we survive, they pay. Simple.”*

*"This place creeps me out though. It’s too clean. Feels like we’re the ones being tested.”* Jill muttered, her voice lower now. She jabbed the air again, her muscles rippling beneath the fabric of her hoodie. *“You ever wonder if we’re being groomed for something else? Like they want us to be more than just fighters?”*

Jack snorted, looking at Jill like she was overthinking things. *“Look, this isn’t about getting groomed for anything. We’re here because we’re good at what we do. What more is there to say?”*

*“You’re right,”* Jill said, a half-grin tugging at her lips as she flexed her biceps. *“But hey, a fight’s a fight. Can’t argue with that.”*

I paced back and forth, each step echoing in the hollow hangar. The sound matched my heartbeat. Jack and Jill talked behind me, but their voices were distant, like background noise. My fingers brushed over the old scars on my left arm. They were faded now, mostly forgotten by others, but not by me. Each scar was a reminder—of fights that ended in blood, of mistakes that stayed even after the bruises were gone.

I paused, tightening the wraps around my hands, pulling each knot until the fabric bit into my skin. My knuckles throbbed beneath the layers, a dull ache that stirred something primal inside.

I stepped toward the corner of the room, taking deep breaths. The cold air seemed thicker there, the shadows deeper. I closed my eyes, lowering my head, and for a brief moment, I prayed—not to any god or saint, but to whoever beyond us might be listening out there.

“CLEAR THE AREA FOR TEST SUBJECTS!!!”

That loudspeaker jolted me to look back. It almost made me jump.

My focus was yanked to the north wall, my pulse racing as it groaned open. A thick mist poured out, spilling across the floor. For a second, it felt like the ground was shaking. It was not an earthquake, but the heavy thud of footsteps. 

A massive figure covered in shaggy fur stepped into the light. Bigfoot… but twisted and altered. A strange device clamped its head, forcing its eyes wide open. Its teeth were bared in a forced grimace. One of their hands was gone. A cold, metal prosthetic replaced it. Its exposed spine glinted, slick with a metallic sheen.

It raised both its arms and rushed towards me. I assumed a fighting stance, looking the beast in the eye. I don’t know if my memory is choppy but what happened to me was clear as day. The lights flickered and, for less than a split second, we were covered in complete darkness. The beast was gone. As if it was never there.

Then claws ripped into my back. I dropped, watching blood splatter on the floor—my blood. I rolled as the beast swung again, its claws striking the tiles where I’d just been. Back on my feet, I hammered a few push kicks into its side, trying to knock it down. It didn’t even flinch. I braced to throw a left hook as the beast hurtled at me.

*“No, he’s mine!”* Jack shoved me aside, baring his teeth, fists clenched.

Jack punched with a force stronger than a bullet, his fist connecting with the beast’s jaw mid-charge. A rush of wind hit me first, rattling my bones, and almost blowing my hair back. A sound cracked through the air. I thought it was a sonic boom, a shockwave created before it even hit the monster.

Jack assumed a fighting stance, a mix of Bajiquan and what seemed to be a style of his own making. 

Bigfoot shook its head, slowly rising from the blow. Their eyes narrowed on Jack. It carelessly rolled its tongue out. Jack tackled the ape-man, crashing into it with a force that sent them both tumbling. They rolled across the floor, limbs locked in a struggle. Bigfoot thrashed as Jack’s knees dug into the beast’s sides, wrestling for control. Every shift of weight was a battle, Jack’s hands desperately reaching for an advantage, struggling to pin the beast beneath him.

The Sasquatch bit down on Jack’s cheek, ripping the skin away. Jack screamed, not from pain but from anger. He bit the Bigfoot’s nose, tearing it off. The creature howled and bit Jack’s arm in return. They fought like animals. Teeth and claws tore into each other. Jack knew he couldn’t bite through the cryptid’s thick skin, so he aimed for the softer parts—its ears, its eyes, its face—anything he could sink his teeth into.

The beast grabbed Jack by the torso and tossed him aside like a sack of potatoes. Before it could recover, Jill charged in. With one swift, powerful kick to its cranium, she sent the creature back to the ground. We saw our chance. All three of us closed in, trampling the downed beast until its skull caved in. But as we pressed the attack, it grabbed my foot and yanked me off balance. The giant ape swung me like a weapon, slamming me into Jack. Bigfoot stood up and threw me aside like a 185-pound projectile. That left Jill to face the monster alone.

Jill didn't stand like a fighter—she moved with raw, unrefined power. She kicked Bigfoot in the nuts. The creature let out a guttural roar, clutching its groin in pain. As it lowered its head, gritting its teeth, Jill delivered a brutal uppercut. Her fist collided with its jaw, snapping its head back.

The Sasquatch staggered, momentarily dazed. Jill didn’t hesitate. She closed the distance, driving her shoulder into its chest and pushing it into the ground. She mounted the massive monster and proceeded to hammer its face in a flurry of savage blows, each one faster and harder than the last. The creature thrashed beneath her, but she held on, relentless.

When it tried to swipe at her, she ducked under its arm and punished it with a punch to what was left of its nose. The ape-man recoiled, its face twisting in pain. Jill didn’t give the cryptid a moment to recover and proceeded to choke it.

The Sasquatch grabbed Jill by the back, claws digging deep into her skin. With a loud grunt, it hurled her across the room, her body hitting the ground. I silently circled around the massive ape, closing the distance quickly. Without hesitation, I pounced from behind, locking one arm around its neck and the other gripping the metal contraption on its face.

I yanked—ripping the mechanism free. The sound of tearing flesh and the sickening spray of blood followed. Bigfoot’s face sloughed off, hanging loose, like a ragged towel draped over its exposed skull. Its eyes bulged in shock, its mouth gaping in a silent scream.

It turned away and ran, crying. I chased it down. It tried to look for an exit that wasn’t there. It was vulnerable and confused, wondering why it couldn’t open the door it walked out of. 

So, I grabbed the poor animal by the legs and pushed it to the floor. I raised my arm and closed my fingers into a fist, its shadow blocking the light as the Sasquatch uselessly turned its head to get a glimpse of me. Its eyes looked almost human, just like the Wendigo, but I didn’t pay attention.

I fight where I’m told and I win where I fight. 

I let loose. My punches hit with purpose, precise and brutal, each one a crack of power as my fists tore through its bones. If you wanna survive, you have to claw, and bite, and punch. But Bigfoot didn’t, it was helpless.

*“MAMA!”*

In between hits, I swore I heard the beast scream for its mother like it was an oversized child. But strangely, I enjoyed it. I wanted to hear it scream again. So I kept punching and punching and punching… until it could no longer scream.

We were sent to the medical bay later, being treated for our injuries. I never asked why we were fighting cryptids and I didn’t care about Jill’s question whether there was something more to this gig than meets the eye. All I know is that I fought *things* no other human being has ever fought. And it felt good.

That moment, I began to enjoy fighting… or maybe I always did, I was just repressing it. Maybe I just needed to let loose.
