Two years ago, Jared ate his own pinky finger. Things went downhill from there.

I had known Jared since middle school. He was gifted in many ways - a smart, athletic and helpful guy with a good head on his shoulders. We spent a lot of time together as teenagers, as we were both on the high school football team. He became a radiographer after graduation, doing advanced medical imaging such as x-rays and MRI scans in hospitals, before he got bored and quit out of the blue. Then he taught himself computer science and got a software engineering job.

We moved to different states for work after graduating. Jared and I spoke over the phone most weekends, but then his job became busier, so we lost touch for a while.

That was until I got a call from Jared's girlfriend after the pinky incident, in the middle of a dreary office day.

"He's in hospital. He's asleep right now, but he said he wants to see you," said his girlfriend Mary.

"What happened?"

"It's a lot to explain over the phone, are you free to come over this week?"

"It's a work heavy week, any chance I could drop by next week?" I looked at my jam-packed calendar.

"He's been going through a lot recently. His dad died last week as well. I can take care of him, but I can't talk him out of his own head like you can."

My heart sank. In that moment, I had a brief flashback of Jared's dad at one of our football matches, patting me on the back like I was his own son.

"I'm sorry for his loss. Alright, tell him I'll be there this Saturday."

I made the arduous seven and a half hour drive to their place on the Saturday, where Jared greeted me at the door. Standing on his doorstep, I felt specks of rain on me as the grey clouds loomed overhead.

"Been a while," he croaked, smiling slightly. He was pale, and huge bags sunk under his eyes.

"I'm sorry about your old man," I said, closing the door behind me and following him to the living room.

"Appreciate that, man. It was his time."

We sat down on opposite couches.

"Mary told me you ended up in the hospital. What's been going on?"

"Just not been feeling well in myself lately, man. Oh, and we broke up, me and Mary. She moved out yesterday."

It had only been three days since Mary's call.

"What happened?"

"I convinced her I was cheating on her. I wasn't, but I needed her out of the picture. Can't put her through the shit I'm gonna go through soon."

My concern grew. He held up his left hand, wrapped in a bandage.

"Looks like one hell of an accident," I said.

"It wasn't an accident," he replied, "I cut my finger off with a kitchen knife and ate it. That's what I wanted to talk to you about today. I need help. I'm afraid man, very afraid."

His voice was shaky. I was speechless, and continued staring at his bandaged hand. Had he lost his mind?

"The real reason I quit my medical job back then," he continued, "Well, I did the imaging for a lot of surgeries. When they opened them up, sometimes blood would splatter on the floor, on the equipmentâ€¦ Jesus," he shook his head, looking down, "you're gonna think I'm insane."

I blinked, waiting for him to make his point.

"Ever since I started that job, it's given me an insatiable craving for human flesh. I know, you're probably thinking, 'what the fuck?' right now, but just hear me out. It doesn't come on when my mind's occupied or I'm talking to people, like we are now, just when I'm alone or in my head."

I stared at him in silence. He sighed, and continued.

"It began when I took that job. I'd stare at these people with their insides out in the open, blood everywhere, and I'd have an insatiable gnawing in my stomach. I tried to keep it at bay by eating a shit ton of chicken breast and steak, but that didn't work.

It got so bad I started biting the insides of my mouth and chewing bits off my tongue. When I quit that job, the feeling went away for a bit, but it's started coming back recently. I don't know why, but I can't make it stop. Any time I'm alone for a while, the craving comes back. Last week, I couldn't help it. I just chopped off my finger and ate it, down to the bone. I don't know what's wrong with me. Imagine not eating for a week, then someone puts a cheeseburger right in front of you, and says you can't eat it. That's what that felt like."

"You didn't get these cravings when you were at work, or with Mary?" I asked, still trying to wrap my head around the situation.

"Not before, but they became stronger recently. I found myself getting them when I was in bed with Mary. I'd stare at the back of her neck when she was asleep, trying to resist the urge of taking a bite out of her. I had to push her away. I don't know what I'd do if I lost control and hurt her."

He got teary. Despite pitying him, I suddenly became very aware that we were alone together, and I edged backwards a little. He spotted me moving away.

"Dude," he smiled slightly, "It's not that bad. I can hold a conversation without turning into a vampire. Like I told you, it's just when I'm stuck in my own head or alone for a long time."

"You ever thought about getting help?" I asked, "Kinda sounds like an extreme case of OCD or something."

"I've got an appointment next week with a psychiatrist. Hopefully they can get to the bottom of what's going on."

"You know they might detain you, if they think you're at risk of harming other people or yourself?"

"Yeah," he sighed.

We went on a walk in the park outside his house, and had a catch up. He seemed like his usual self for most of our talk, however he kept pausing as he spoke. I looked over at him a couple of times, and spotted him chewing the inside of his mouth ferociously before stopping himself and continuing to speak. I left that day still concerned for him, hoping something productive would come of his medical appointment.

I called him the week after. His psychiatrist started him on Luvox and decided he didn't need to be detained. He sounded more upbeat, so I assumed the medication and the appointment had eased his mind. We called each other weekly, and each week he seemed to be doing better, and said the urges had almost completely gone away.

Then a few months ago, I got a panicked call from him at 2am. Half awake, I ignored the call at first, thinking I should've turned my phone on silent before bed. When it kept ringing, I grew concerned and picked up.

"I'm going to prison, man. I've fucked up bad," he said in a hushed tone, his voice cracking.

"What happened?" I asked, alarmed.

"There's this little girl who walks to school with her mom past the outside of my house most days," he said, "I used to just stare at her, and every time she walked by, the cravings would come back."

I shuddered, praying this was not going where I thought it was.

"This morning, I just couldn't help myself. I went outside as they came towards my house, and pushed her over. Her mom was screaming and hitting me. The neighbors were calling the police."

My heart raced, and I jolted upright in bed.

"What the fuck, man? I thought you were getting better this whole time. Did you, like, hurt her?"

"No, other than making her fall. I regretted it as soon as I did it. There was so much fear in her eyes. I wanted to take a bite out of her so bad, but managed to stop myself."

I heard footsteps and shouting in the background.

"I gotta go," he said, then cut off the line. I sat still in bed for about an hour, dazed.

Jared was sent to a psych ward in his state. They allowed visitors, so I managed to book a time to see him.

A staff member brought him out to the visitors' area. He was dressed in white anti-ligature clothing that covered his neck to his ankles. His arms and legs were chained. There were bloodied bandages over his hands, and plasters covering his cheeks. He wore a leather mask with holes in it. When he opened his mouth to speak, I could just about see through the holes to notice that the tip of his tongue was missing. That thing was half the size it should have been, and he couldn't pronounce his t's and s's properly. His eyes were bloodshot, his expression weary.

"What happened to you, man?" I said.

"What does it look like?" he answered, his voice monotone, muffled slightly by the mask. It was the voice of a man who had had enough.

"How have they been treating you here?" I asked.

"Alright. Better than expected. The staff here stop me eating myself and other people to death, at least. Appreciate you coming to see me."

"Don't mention it," I said. "How are the cravings?"

"Worst they've ever been. I'm just gonna be honest, if they let me out of these right now," he shook the chains on his wrists, "I'd eat you, and everyone else in the room. Then I'd go looking for other people, or just eat myself. Not that I'd want to - I just know I wouldn't be able to control the urges. The hunger keeps me awake at night. I havent slept in three days.

No one's gotten hurt so far, apart from me I guess, but they've been getting worse every day. My psychiatrist's tried everything, every pill under the sun. It's not gotten to the point where they have to sedate me, but I'll get there eventually. They can't figure out what's wrong with me. It's torture, man. Wouldn't wish this existence on anyone."

"I'm sorry," I said. He nodded slightly. "Did that Luvox stuff stop working?"

He shook his head.

"I never took the pills. The first one made me feel sick, so I stopped. I lied at that first appointment. Downplayed everything, said it was just a few voices telling me to chew my fingers, denied wanting to eat other people, even though I'd been having those thoughts. I know it was wrong of me, I wanted help, but I just didn't want to get detained. But even if I'd told the truth, it's not like they could do anything to help me."

"But you were getting better for a while," I said, "You were making good progress for months. I thought it was the pills working. Why did you suddenly get worse?"

"It didn't suddenly get worse. It's been this bad all along. But before the incident with the girl, Iâ€¦ had a way to cope. A way to keep the cravings at bay for a while."

"What was that?" I asked.

We stared at each other in silence for a while. Tears welled up in his eyes, and his hands started to tremble. He looked at the staff member who had accompanied him.

"I'd better get going now, I've got a medication review in a few minutes. Anyway, good to see you, man. You take care."

I was bewildered by the abrupt ending to our meeting. The image of the bloodied bandages covering his chewed up fingers was seared into my mind.

A few weeks later after our meeting, I got a call from the hospital to inform me that Jared had died. He had somehow managed to get the mask off when the staff weren't looking, and that resulted in him chewing his arms to the bone. His left arm got infected and he became septic, then died in hospital. They think he had some kind of schizophrenia mixed with severe psychosis, but they weren't sure what induced it. It's rare, but it happens to people occasionally, and each case is its own medical mystery. They're still looking into his case to this day.

However the bigger mystery to me was how he had been able to live a somewhat normal life for the good part of two years. He hadn't taken his pills, not that they would've worked anyway, and he couldn't even be left alone for a few minutes without eating himself. I soon found out.

When the authorities cleared out his empty house, they discovered the scarce remains of his deceased father in the freezer. Evidently, he had dug the corpse up and been eating pieces of it for over a year, each piece giving temporary relief from his unstoppable cravings. The corpse was stripped down to the bone.

The entire time, he was calling me every weekend, pretending everything was fine and that he was getting better.

When he had knawed off the last chunk of decaying flesh between two of the ribs, there was nothing left to keep his ravenous appetite at bay. Then he lost control, and attacked the girl. He obviously deteriorated rapidly after that incident. I had met Jared's dad a couple of times in high school, and he was the nicest guy. Can't imagine it was easy for Jared to do what he did.

I've had the same nightmare a few times now - it starts with me standing behind Jared in his kitchen. He's sobbing while eating his dad's corpse, begging me to stop him. But every time I stand there frozen, paralyzed and unable to help.

Even though I don't know what to make of the tragic situation, I feel for Jared, really. I couldn't think of a more horrific way to die. He was a good guy, and didn't deserve all that. I don't know if they'll fully get to the bottom of what caused it, but I guess what happened to him could've happened to anyone spontaneously.

I never thought I'd say this, but I'm beginning to understand what he would've felt in his final weeks. I've been trying to lose weight recently. Sometimes when I crave a slice of pizza, I think of what happened to Jared, and it helps the craving pass. But not always.
