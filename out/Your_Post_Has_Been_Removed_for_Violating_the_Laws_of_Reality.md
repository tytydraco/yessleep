It was a Tuesday when I realized something was deleting the world.

Not just changing it. Not breaking it. Deleting it.

At first, it was little things. Street signs flickered between languages that didn’t exist. Conversations cut off mid-sentence, like someone had hit backspace on a thought. The sky had a loading icon.

Then, bigger things started vanishing. People. Buildings. Cause and effect.

I walked outside and found a notice carved into the air itself:

“Your existence has been flagged for noncompliance. Appeal denied.”

I stared. My brain refused to process.

Then I saw them.

The Administrators.

Not people. Not exactly. They wore black suits that flickered like bad reception, faces blank except for hollow indentations where their eyes should be. They didn’t walk. They just appeared, correcting things.

I saw one standing in the middle of the street. It tilted its head at a tree and muttered:

“This does not adhere to standard environmental parameters. Removing.”

The tree blinked out of existence.

No smoke. No sound. Just—gone.

I stepped back, my pulse hammering. “What the fuck?”

One of them turned to me. It twitched.

“Your thought has been flagged for narrative inconsistency. Please ensure all experiences remain immersive.”

I ran.

I ran past streets that no longer connected, past people who froze mid-motion, waiting for approval. I ran until I reached my apartment, slammed the door—

[ERROR: DOOR NOT FOUND]

I crashed forward onto nothing. Just void.

The walls were gone. My furniture, my floor—deleted. I was standing in the skeleton of my own reality.

And then, in the distance—I saw the report page.

A massive, floating panel in the void. The official removal notice for my world.

At the top, in bold, unreadable symbols that my brain somehow translated:

“Your Universe Has Been Flagged for the Following Violations:
	•	Excessive Anomalies
	•	Failure to Maintain Consistent Reality Formatting
	•	Inadequate Justification for Survival

I staggered backward. My lungs weren’t working right. My thoughts glitched.

Behind me, the Administrators closed in.

One reached out—fingers made of pure red tape.

“Wait,” I gasped. “I—I can fix this. I’ll rewrite it.”

It tilted its head. “Appeal request acknowledged.”

For a moment, I felt hope.

Then the page updated.

“Appeal Denied.”

The Administrators raised their hands, and I felt my code unravel.

Everything flickered.

My limbs blurred. My thoughts distorted, like a corrupted file. I could feel myself being deleted.

And then—

A new notice appeared.

“Your Removal Has Been Removed for Violating the Rules.”

The Administrators froze. Twitched. One of them glitched so hard it collapsed into itself.

I felt my body snap back into existence.

I gasped. Stumbled. Looked around.

The void crashed.

And suddenly, I was back in my room.

Everything was normal. My floor. My walls. My furniture.

A new notification hovered in the air:

“Your Reality Has Been Auto-Approved. Please Adhere to All Future Guidelines.”

I exhaled. My heart pounded.

I didn’t know who—or what—had intervened.

But somehow, I was still here.

Still alive.

Still writing.

And for now—that would have to be enough.
