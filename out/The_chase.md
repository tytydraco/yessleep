17 years ago I took this job. Not the job I had always wanted but a job nonetheless. It always paid the bills, decent benefits and long quiet nights to myself until that one day... 

The school janitor, the thankless job of cleaning up after other. I never did mind the quiet nights all alone, it was peaceful you know? The things you see out of the corner of your eye at night or the flushing of toilets when nobody else is around don't get to you after a while. It becomes second nature to just shrug those things off and carry on with your trusty mop and trash barrel at your side. But the one thing in my whole career that has bothered me, the one thing that still gives me goosebumps when I have to peer in the dark chasm is the chase.

Most people dont even know its there. Tucked away in the lonely janitors closet only for me to see late at night. The chase is a dimly lit narrow hallway between two sets of bathrooms with all kinds of pipe and wiring but mainly its to access the water shut offs in the large gang bathrooms on the other side. I never like it in there. When the one lightbulb with its yellowish glow barely giving enough light to see whats in front of you I always had a bad sensation crawl over me when I had to go in the chase.

I swear on some nights, seemingly every time it storms, when the buildings cleared out except for me I can hear things calling for me from the chase. I have to shut the door to ease my mind of any thoughts of what could be waiting in there for me. But call me crazy, i try to think its just my imagination but there is just no way. There is something wrong with that chase, something sinister. Nobody ever believes me until recently.

A group of local teens decided to break into our school over night the one weekend. I have no idea how they didnt trigger the motion sensors or the alarm unless one of the little fuckers knew the code. But thats the least of my worries, I come into work on monday afternoon for my night shift to see police cars infront of the building. Which isnt unusual as every so often they come by and do a walk through to make sure everythings secure. Not this time, red and blue lights flashing in the school and everybody in a panic. Turns out 3 boys entered the school but only 2 made it back out.

I was of course questioned by the police as I was the one who knew the place the best but I had a solid alibi as I was at home all weekend with my wife and kids. There had already been a full sweep of the school during the day and after a day or two they had to tear down the crime scene tape so school could continue. That boy was never found and his two friends were scared shitless as if they saw something but the police never got a straight answer from them. The school year eventually started to carry on as if nothing every happened. I felt terrible for the boys parents but what could we do. In the back of my mind all I could think about was that damn chase. Where else would thay boy have ended up.

Then came what I still call the worst night of my life. The night that would cause me to put in my resignation letter. To walk away and never look back on the last 17 years of my life. It started like any other night, sweeping up, grabbing garbage; until the rain came. With the rain came leaks and with leaks came me running around placing buckets underneath them, I dont know why management can never get those damn roofers here. But thats when I hear it, as Im chasing leaks I pass the bathroom and hear water gushing. A janitors worst nightmare; a fucking leaking toilet. That night of all nights I had to venture into my least favorite spot in the school. The aforementioned chase. My kryptonite as you will.

I need to shut the water off to that toilet so I slowly make my way towards the chase. I flip on the light switch and to my horror it doesnt turn on. I grab my flash light, take a deep breath and make my way into the chase towards the toilets shut off valve. Of course it had to be the last one all the way at the end, I start counting the valves. One.. two.. three.. fou.. my flashlight catches something or should I say lack thereof. The pitch black of the chase seemed to go on forever. I was able to see the 8th shutoff valve about 10 feet away from me but then the pipes just kept continuing. Ive been here 17 years i know theres only 8 toilets in that bathroom. The should not be anything past that last toilet. There should be a block wall thats it. If you broke through that block wall you would be outside.

My curiosity got the better of me and I ventured forward. I made it to the 8th valve and turned it off and I could hear the water stop running on the other side of the wall but thats when in the silence I heard another sound. Very subtle, very softly I heard a scrape from behind me coming from the entrance to the chase. "Hello is anybody there?" I cried out. I turn around and thats when the beam of my light struck his face. I knew his face, Ive seen it all over the news for weeks, it was burned into my memory. It was that kid that they never found, but he looked wrong. I mean anybody would have looked disheveled if they spent that much time in a bathroom chase but this look I had a bad feeling about.

I called out to him "hey youre that kid theyve been looking for, are you okay?". No response. I slowly walk towards him and wish I hadnt. I got closer and saw he was smiling, not a normal smile like hey Im safe this was different, sinister. Like his lips were stretched way further than any humans should be. It would be the smile that haunts my nightmares every night since. It stopped me dead in my tracks and I started to back away away from him he let out the most animalistic scream Ive ever heard any human make. His jaw opened wider than no normal persons should of and started towards me. 

I grabbed my flashlight and started running. I knew it wasnt possible but the chase was way longer than physically possible. I didnt know what would lie ahead but I didnt care. Id take my chances with the unknown rather than that fucking "thing" chasing me. I could still hear him trailing behind me as I made my way through the dark damp halls of the bathroom chase. Screaming at me and what was that.. was he..laughing at me. What happened to this poor kid, I really hope I dont find out when I get to the end of whever the fuck I was heading.

The chase seemed to go on forever, my light just hit black infront of me, cinderblock walls to the sides of me and a concrete floor that just did not make sense. I snuck a look behind me to see if I could still see the kid, nothing.. but I could still hear him screaming and laughing menacingly like it was some sick fucking joke. 

I pushed on, hoping to find a way out, hoping that thing doesnt catch up to me or I dont find any more of whatever he turned into. His screams pushing me forward, panting, out of breath but I pushed on as fast as a could. Then all of a sudden BAM. 

I woke up with the day shift custodian standing over me. "Hey everything okay man, what happened last night?". I just looked up at him confused and with a hell of a headache. I sat up, I was in the janitors close. "What the fuck happened?" I said. The day guy said " looks like you tried to go into the chase and hit your head on the low pipe." "No theres no way, you dont understand, I saw him. I saw the kid and he was different, something else." He clearly didnt believe me and I knew it wouldnt get me anywhere with the police. I turned in my keys that day and never looked back. My wife thinks Im crazy but I know what happened in that chase and I will never step foot in that school again.
