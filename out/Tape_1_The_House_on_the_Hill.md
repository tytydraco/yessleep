“Case HM, Tape Number 1: The House on The Hill

The history of that house was weird. And the rumors spread about it were even weirder. I don’t exactly remember when or why I became so enamored with that place. Perhaps it was its long history, I mean the place had stood there for almost 200 years, it was basically a historical sight at this point. Or maybe it was the family, who had lived there for eight generations, or perhaps, and most likely, it was the curse.

The curse of the Harrington Manor had been a rumor that had been spreading across town for ages now. Ever since the founder of the manor had become a widower, the stories that came from those ancient walls has spread around the village like a plague. Mothers started to warn their children not to go near the gates of the manor, fearing that they would find themselves in the grip of whatever it was that haunted that poor family.

The house itself is now empty. Sitting alone at the top of the hill that watched over the town. It had been almost a year since the “ Fall of Harrington Manor”. The news spread quickly, as those any silly rumor. 

“The house has fallen!!!” yelled a man on the street.

“Did you hear the news, Harrington manor suddenly collapsed yesterday” the salon ladies gossiped.

“They say that all the members of the family died out of nowhere”.

These whispers would echo around town for days. Yet, whenever someone would go up the hill to check on the corpse that had been left of the place, they would find the house peacefully waiting on the top. Sitting in its silence away from all the gossip and the whispers that had spread throughout the village. 

The family however was indeed gone. The causes of death were left untold, hidden away in a pile of files in the sheriff’s office, but the family, for the most part, was gone. The last remaining member had left the family when he was still young, and was no where near the place when the sudden tragedy struck.

He handled most of what came after and buried the late members in the family grave yard behind the house. The young man still owns the manor but hasn’t dared to step foot in the place. No one knows exactly why he kept the house but one thing is clear. Whatever it was the took the lives of his family, would never hurt any one else again. 

There are still many stories hidden in the walls of the place. Years of tragedy and loss walking through the now empty halls of that rotting manor. No one has yet to find out the truth that of what’s hidden in that place, but I will. In these tapes I intend to uncover these stories and bring to light what really happened to the Harringtons and find out the truth of this supposed curse that has haunted them for eight generations.
