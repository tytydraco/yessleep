My parents were at the brink of divorce.  
At the end of the day, that’s what really pushed them to enroll me to the Glass Glacier Program For Gifted Children. I don’t think they would’ve otherwise taken the initiative to send me on top of a mountain for three weeks with limited reception, so I could ‘have fun solving brain quizzes with kids my age’ or ‘fill in my college application with useful skills like HTML coding’.  
They had the best intentions. The pamphlets really did hype the place up.  
An indoor heated pool, hiking trails, a nice library and a few futuristic looking classrooms all gave a very fancy and legitimate air to the program. We would be having full days of lessons in chemistry, biology, computers and mechanics by people that, when googled, were all very well respected.  Of course, we would also be having fun with more creative down times like painting, swimming, watching movies and, the main attraction, getting to play with the GGP’s virtual reality console. It was a state-of-the-art creation, a innovation of gameplay with visuals so detailed that it took terabytes to even get past the first few minutes of gameplay.  
Of course there was a catch. Two, actually. To get in in the first place, you had to be a perfect student, both in intellect and in physical shape. After all, the entire schedule was practically a punishment unless you were a massive nerd. The other tiny, insignificant thing, that was no problem really, was the presence of a psychologist running the tests in the background.  
It was an experiment on human behavior. The main question they wanted answered was simple. How would students react to different stimuli during a long period of stress?  
They insisted to the parents that we would not be under serious mental strain, terrorized or physically harmed. They said that they were an ethical corporation who wanted to conduct experiments for the betterment of society. They lied.  
“We will start with a simple questionnaire, just to set the stage a little for what is to come. Each family gets a page and the student has to fill it out. You are allowed to help and make comments, but please do it as quietly as you can as not to disturb the rest. This isn’t a graded test but will decide if you’ll be taken in more IT or Biology classes. Please read all the questions first before answering them.”  
A hand was raised the second the man stopped speaking.  
“Yes?”  
“Do we get extra paper?” The boy said. He looked like he’d been struck in the face with a shovel as a baby, and all of his features had grown flat as a result. The blonde bowl cut wasn’t helping. His mother nodded beside him, smugly tapping her expensive purse.  
The man laughed. “No, but there’s no need to worry. The test will be rather short and you don’t need to overexert yourself just yet.”  
The sheets were passed around by two other men in a greenish uniform. They were bulky, with shaved heads and empty faces. They looked like they were military, but I couldn’t come up with a reason why they would be here to supervise a bunch of thirteen-year-olds if that was true.  
I turned my attention to the paper and my pen, biting my inner cheek in concentration. Exams were already an uneasy experience, but when both of my parents leaned over my shoulder, my hands were clammier than usual.  
I took a sip of tea, then, with careful strokes, I wrote my name on top of the page.   
Question One: What would you like to be when you grow up?  
“Well, that’s easy. Doctor.” Mom whispered. “Write it a bit longer, like, ‘I want to be a doctor so I can help people!.”  
“If she writes doctor, she’ll probably be put on more biology classes. She wanted to play with the computer thing, didn’t you Alice?”  
“This is a bit more important, isn’t it James? She shouldn’t be wasting her potential on games.”  
“Not everything has to be about the future, Helen, let her enjoy some of her time here right now.”  
“So you suggest she what, lies, so she can play a little game?”  
“Who said she’s lying? She didn’t say anything about being a doctor, you did!”  
“We’ve talked about this a million times. Right, Alice? You always said you wanted-“  
“It’s a trick question, mom, you’re not supposed to answer it. Look.”  
I tapped Question Fourteen, which wasn’t a question at all, but a request. Only answer Question Four, Eleven, Twenty., Twenty-two and Twenty -five.  
“Cheeky.” Dad commented. “So what do these say?”  
Question Four: What is your favorite color?  
Gray.  
“Grey with an E,.” Dad said.  
“With an A, who even writes gray with an E, James, you were born in Minnesota.”  
“You have to make a big deal about anything, do you?”  
“I already wrote it, so let’s move on.” I interrupted.  
I should’ve written blue or green or something.  
Question Eleven: How do you feel being stuck in the middle of a petty argument?  
The room was very hot. It had been pleasant when we had first entered the room, but the AC had been turned on for a while, and I was still wearing my coat over the thickest turtleneck mom could find. I was starting to get sweaty and weirdly feverish, my skin prickling with discomfort. I was getting itchier too, still in the process of getting used to wearing a bra.  
I smoothed back my hair, tightening my ponytail like it was the reason I couldn’t concentrate.   
My pen hovered over the page, a hair away from making progress. What do I write that won’t set either of them off?  
It was discomforting. I wasn’t sure how I felt either, other than ‘Totally not good, dude.’ Or ‘Like shit’, but I couldn’t exactly put that on paper.  
Being involved in an argument that’s in bad faith, in which neither party wants to truly converse with the other… puts me in an awkward state that I would like to avoid if I cannot… uh…. Cannot…. Figure it a solution? No, that’s not intellectual enough. I would like to avoid if I cannot come up with… that’s worse…. Cannot… it’s on the tip of my tongue… propose a sufficient solution!   
Being involved in an argument that’s in bad faith, in which neither party wants to truly converse with the other puts me in an awkward state that I would like to avoid if I cannot propose a sufficient solution.  
“Okay, getting there.” I whispered.  
Question Twenty: Turn the page and describe your worst fear (80-100 words).  
What was my greatest fear? I feared lots of things. I was scared of dogs and snakes. Scared of the dark but only sometimes. Scared of heights, maybe? I hadn’t felt anything when we’d gone over the bridge on the way up here. Scared of car crashes? Plane crashes? Isn’t everyone scared of those? I was digging on the back of my head, trying to come up with my greatest fear, but coming up short. I didn’t really fear anything more than other things.   
I took a peek around the room. Everyone was very concentrated, multiple students scribbling under the watchful gaze of their parents, with varying degrees of anxiety.  
The boy that had talked earlier was pale, but writing furiously, his invisible eyebrows so tense they connected in the middle of his forehead. And then a drop of blood dripped from his nose. It landed without a sound on the desk, but it didn’t seem to bother him.   
Like a faucet that had been abruptly turned on, a waterfall of blood began rushing down on face. It coated everything with crimson, his shirt, his hands, his paper. It splattered on his mother’s white purse and began pooling on the floor. He tapped his foot rapidly, sending splashes of red all over the place.  
And he didn’t lift his head once.  
“Alice?”  
“That guy is bleeding!” I whispered.  
“What?”  
“He’s bleeding, dad, look!”  
He turned around and pursed his lips, his eyes scanning the room. “I don’t see anything, which one?”  
I turned sharply, but my mouth closed as soon as it opened. There was nothing. The boy was still leaned over the paper, his pencil turned backwards and furiously erasing what he’d written. But he didn’t look like the victim of a murder spree but just like a regular, nerdy wimp with a Star Wars shirt.  
My mom stepped lightly over my foot and that’s when I realized why my parents had suddenly stopped talking. The man was right in front of me, looking down at the blank sheet. He was smiling, but there was something about his eyes, an almost dead lizard like quality I couldn’t look away from. He tapped his wristwatch and my mouth became dry as a desert.   
“I’m sorry, I-um, must’ve imagined something. A trick of light.”  
“Take your time, please. Like I said, this test isn’t graded.”  
Like that means something to anyone here.  
I wiped my forehead. Took another sip of tea, that tasted like nothing but warm water because they hadn’t handed out sugar packets to go along with it. There was no blood, I told myself. But I could smell it. It was still in the air, metallic and foul on my tongue. I swallowed it bitterly, and began writing.  
My greatest fear is… Is… Is.. I’d make a terrible doctor, actually, at that very moment I realized my greatest fear were injuries. Headless corpses, torn appendages, loose intestines littered on the pale marble floor…  I could suddenly see it all vividly, and for a brief, brief second.  
I saw an eyeball, still connected to the nerves, just lying on the desk. It was watching me lazily, it’s blue iris unfocused. Before I had the chance to jump and scream, someone else did.  
“Cockroach! Mom, it’s crawling up your leg!!!”  
The girl was my age, with the most orange hair I had ever seen in my life. She had jumped up her chair, balancing dangerously on the edge and shrieking loud enough to pierce my eardrums.   
One of the military men jumped into action, crouching beneath the desk to find the insect. Everyone was looking in awe, either mortified or quietly snickering. I took a glimpse at the clock, trying to see how much time we had left. Twenty minutes or so. Had so much time really passed that quickly? It didn’t seem possible.   
The burly man, Morty, from the tag he had on his back pocket, got up, holding something small in his hand. “A pebble.” He said, showing it to the room.  
Someone, the bleeding boy, burst into laughter. Others followed. My mother rolled her eyes, rolling the wrinkles off her skirt. “Outrageous,” she whispered.  
“It’s no-no-not! Look it’s moving! Can’t you see it moving?!”  
“Miss, please step down, Mr. M will take the pebble outside if it bothers you this much. Let me get you a new cup of tea.”  
A janitor pushed through the door, wearing a mask and thick yellow gloves. My mom pinched me, manually turning my head to the paper.  
I don’t remember what I wrote in the end, the words fading away as soon as they were written.   
Question Twenty-Two: What would you do if you saw someone in a hard situation?  
Comfort them, offer them words of encouragement, help them with their problem.  
The girl walked right past me, holding back tears and a stained piece of paper. The person next to me chuckled at her frazzled hair. I said nothing, trying to make the idea more refined and comprehensible.  
If I saw someone in a bad situation, my first step would be to offer words of comfort, then of encouragement.  
The man, Mr. Charles, as I found out he was called, said something about seeing things and how it happens to the best of them. He wasn’t really talking out loud, but he wasn’t whispering either. The girl’s parents apologized profusely, stating that it would never happen again. The person kept snickering.  
Once the person has sufficiently calmed down, I would suggest solutions and try to solve the problem with them. I would also try to circumvent making the situation worse for her.  
More laughter.  
“Will you please stop? I can’t concentrate if you’re going at it like hyenas.”  
The boys turned around in unison. They were identical twins and it, for some reason, that startled me. I could’ve sworn that there had only been one of them just a few seconds ago. A much older man sat with his legs crossed, his gaze fixed on his smartphone.  
“Jeez, what crawled up your ass and died?”  
“Yea, we’re already finished!”  
A bell rang out, startling the room up. My parents, who had been having another argument amongst themselves and had forgotten about me, suddenly shifted in their seats.  
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. What’s next?  
Question Twenty-Five: What is your worst habit?  
I eat too much sugar.  
And I’m probably going to get diabetes before I turn twenty, but that’s not going to stop me. In fact, I’ll probably keep going even if I need to go to the dentist weekly.  
I didn’t put that in. There was no time.  
I handed the sheet over with what I hoped passed for a pleasant smile, then internally cried with relief when it was finally time for my parents to leave. The fight they’d started in the car had somehow restarted when I’d been too out of it by the test and all I could think of was the three peaceful weeks I was about to experience away from them.  
A strange wave of guilt took over me as I thought of that, but I didn’t dwell on it too much. They had already gotten in the car along with the other adults. We all waved them away, some anxious, some excited.  
When the final vehicle left the view, the crowd began to move back inside to get away from the cold afternoon.   
The air was crisp. There was snow in my boots.  
And then a body flung itself of the roof of a nearby building, toppling over four floors of modern glass architecture to explode all over the patio.
