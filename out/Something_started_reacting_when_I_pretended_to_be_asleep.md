My name is Raphael.  
I hesitated for a long time before posting this because I’m afraid of how it sounds, but I need to write it down somewhere before I convince myself none of it happened.

I live alone. I’ve always had trouble sleeping, so waking up in the middle of the night isn’t unusual for me. What *is* unusual is how the silence in my bedroom started behaving.

The first time, I woke up at **2:14 a.m.** I know the exact time because my phone was next to me, screen off, and when I tapped it the clock lit up. The room was completely dark. No traffic noise. No wind. Nothing.

That’s when I realized the silence wasn’t empty.

There was something subtle filling the room. Not a sound exactly, more like the air itself was being used.  
The closest word I have for it is *breathing*, but it didn’t sound like it came from lungs.

I stayed still, listening. The moment I moved even slightly, it stopped.

The next day I convinced myself it was stress. Lack of sleep. My brain misfiring. That night, I went to bed trying not to think about it.

I woke up at **2:17 a.m.**

This time, the sensation was already there.  
Closer.  
Slower.  
As if it had been waiting for me to wake up.

That’s when I noticed a pattern:  
It only happened when I didn’t move.

If I turned my head, nothing.  
If I shifted my arm, silence.  
But if I stayed completely still for a few seconds, it returned.

Over the next nights, I tested it. I stayed motionless on purpose. I held my breath. And every time, it worked. The sensation appeared out of nowhere and vanished the instant I moved.

I tried recording audio. I tried video.  
There was never anything there.

But other things started to change.

Small things. Easy to dismiss. A glass not exactly where I remembered leaving it. A chair angled slightly differently. My bedroom door open just a little more than I was sure I’d left it.

I live alone. I don’t have visitors. I don’t sleepwalk.

On the sixth night, I woke up feeling different. Not scared. *Aware*.  
Like something had noticed that I wasn’t really sleeping anymore.

The breathing wasn’t in the room.

It was **in the space my body occupied**.

Not inside my chest. Not in my ears.  
It felt like it existed in the thin gap between my body and the mattress.

Then the bed dipped on the other side. Slowly. Carefully. As if whoever — or whatever — was there didn’t want to startle me.

I could move. I wasn’t frozen.  
But I understood, instinctively, that if I turned my head, something would change in a way I couldn’t undo.

So I stayed still.

The breathing adjusted. It didn’t copy mine. It *anticipated* it.

And then, not as a voice but as a certainty that formed fully in my mind, I understood:

*You’re aware now.*

That was all. No threat. No emotion. Just a statement.

The pressure lifted. The sound disappeared. The room returned to normal.

Nothing like that has happened since. No breathing. No movement. No signs.

But I know it didn’t leave.

Because sometimes, during the day, I catch myself standing completely still for no reason… and for just a second, I feel that same presence return, like it’s checking whether I’m paying attention.

Yesterday, I found something on my phone.  
A draft in my notes app. No timestamp. I didn’t write it.

It said:

*“While you pretend everything is normal, I learn your habits.”*

I deleted it immediately.

But it didn’t feel like relief.

It felt like deleting a message after realizing  
the other side had already read you.
