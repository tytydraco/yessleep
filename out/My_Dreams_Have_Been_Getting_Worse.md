Ever since I was a kid I've had horrible nightmares. It's either nightmares I've forgotten or remember, no "regular dreams" to be found. Regular stuff: shadows in the corner, naked in the mall, forgotten lines of a play I'm not in, etc. No matter how scary things were, though, there was always this feint feeling of dream-ness. Nothing ever felt completely grounded in reality. It was like my brain followed the Disney rule for cartoons of having one piece of reality but the rest is fantasy and goofy (pun semi-intended). 

Recently, however, my dreams have taken on an air of being *too* real. The hyper-realistic eyes in a dumb creepypasta from 2010. It shouldn't stick with you, but you constantly think about it over and over. Whenever my mind isn't occupied by whatever it is I'm doing in that moment, the images all come rushing back and I lose the breath in my chest. My heart runs cold and my muscles freeze until I'm snapped forcibly back into reality. 

I decided to transcribe all my journal entries from my nightmare journal here in hopes of just getting it out of my system. Maybe someone can relate or sympathize and my mind can start just filtering out the nightmares like usual.

"I was in some skyscraper in the middle of the city. I was a kid again, around 12 again. I could just *tell*, but also because I was about the height of the entrance desk of the lobby. I walked into the elevator, clicking some floor button in I don't remember. I didn't make it to the floor, anyway. The elevator froze for a moment, just long enough to know something was very, very wrong. Then it pulled a *Willy Wonka* and shot upwards faster and faster. In the story, the elevator shot out of the building a flew off to do a tour of London. In my dream, however, it stopped at the top floor, catapulting me up and out of the ceiling. I flew in an arc backwards and fell onto the pavement below.

"I didn't die. I landed and laid there. My bones were shattered and I was left staring, paralyzed, at the building that launched me. People passed by without even glancing at me. I felt the coldness of my blood pooling out of my body onto the sidewalk under me. I felt the tears of my skin from my broken bones jutting out from me. I couldn't even blink, my entire body was frozen as I felt my life being drained from me at a painful slowness. At some point before death took me, I woke up."

*Note: The following Thursday a story came out about how a boy was found at the base of a building near me in the city. They don't know what happened but the lobby person was the last to see him climb into the elevator. Footage from the security cams hasn't been released yet.*

" I was walking down the street at night. It was some random suburb I had never seen before. I thought your mind only dreams of what it has seen before, but I would bet money I had never set foot in this neighborhood before. There was an alley of garage doors and fences connected to houses whose front doors were connected to the main roads out of my sight save for a few glances between the houses. Very *Sandlot* feeling in terms of aesthetics.

"While walking, I heard a heavy dragging. Continuous, but slow. As if something was heavy, but the carrier wasn't struggling. I began to look around for a source, when a flash of a shadow caught my eye. I looked out onto the main street to my left and began to pick up my pace to see what it was. There were chains. A middle section of chains. They kept being pulled beyond where the end should've been. I froze, just watching...waiting. They kept going. A bundle of chains on the street, being dragged on by some unseen origin. I kept walking.

"House after house, the chains never ended. It felt as if miles had been walked and the chains kept going. Then it hit me: miles had been walked and the street was still going. No turns, no breaks, no forks, nothing. I had been walking in a straight line for far too long. I began to run in a terrified frenzy, hoping to prove my mind wrong. But I didn't. I ran and ran and ran and ran. Eventually I had to stop to catch my breath; my chest was on fire and my legs were cramping. I finally was able to catch my breath and shake the cramps off when I heard more breathing. Heavy breathing. On my left. I see the chains pulling still, but they were being pulled off the ground now. 

"I walk forward hesitantly and my legs walk on even though my brain screamed for them to stop after finally seeing the source. It was humanoid in shape, male, too. I couldn't make out any facial features besides the curve of jaw into neck into chest. The chest was large and square in shape. The chains seemed to be coming from *inside* this person? They weaved and churned within one another like a swarm of snakes in a barrel. The only legs were distinguished by shapes alternating back and forth propelling whoever this was forward. The legs and arms were completely engulfed by the mass of chains being left behind, though. This entire thing was being simultaneously pulled while pulling as it walked. I say person, but I couldn't see that it was a person. I just somehow *knew.*

"Suddenly I felt the cold touch of iron around my ankles. I looked down to see a single chain coming from my Achilles heel. Not attached: it was coming from inside me. I saw the chain move down from my calf muscles beneath my skin, out of my heel and onto the street beneath. I passed another house and my wrist was taken by this metal infection. Then each vertebrae one by one had a chain attached and snaked its way down to my tailbone and outward. For every chain attached to me, a chain vanished from the figure I had been following. Eventually mummified skin began to show in spacings between the chains. Sallow, disgusting skin sucked dry of all moisture. Bone protruding through and blood pulsating through the pale skin turning orange from the street lamps. My mouth chained shut as his dropped open and his black tongue rolled out. He was mouthing words but I couldn't hear over the sound of scraping metal on metal. I woke up just as his lifeless, white eyes met mine and the world went black."

*Note: As I was walking to work a few days later, I swear I heard chains scraping. This might just be some leftover fear from the dream, but I swear it sounded real.*

"I was sitting at a bus stop smoking a cigarette (weird because I've never smoked) waiting for the late night bus. The light above the light was flickering every once and a while, making the wall on my right glow with blue light from my phone. There was an ad for some perfume featuring Timothee Chalamet or something. I was scrolling through TikTok, not even paying attention, eventually just locking my phone and shoving it in my pocket. I stared ahead, not able to see much because of the light overhead. Eventually the light flickered off and I saw a shadow across the street. I didn't think much of it at first, I'm on a public street and it wasn't *that* late. 

"The light came back on and I looked over at the perfume ad, then at my watch. The bus was late. Again. American public transit is a fucking joke, I thought. Then the light went off again, the shadow was closer now, on the opposite side of the street. Were they coming to the bus stop? I scooted over to make room just in case, I may be a lot of things, but impolite is not one. Then the light clicked on and off again in quick succession. They were gone. That shook me enough to begin searching my bag for my knife. I don't know how to use knives but I'm sure not going to just lie down and accept death. 

"I heard a small tapping on the plexiglass of the bus stop that sent my mind into the darkness around me. I quickly looked up to meet a horrifying gaze staring back at me. Dead, black eyes were staring at me with joy as a disgusting, scrawny finger with yellowed nails tapped the plexiglass. Pale skin wrapped their thin, naked frame. As the light flashed on and off, now rapidly, this figure's form was burned into my mind. It's body was lean and thin, completely naked, telling me whatever this thing was, it was of the male sex. It had a large head with it's forehead covered in dry wrinkles. It's mouth and teeth were stained with some opaque liquid. The teeth were grimy and his gums black. 

"It pointed behind me. Now I refused to look. I knew what I wanted the last thing I saw to be. I slowly pulled out my phone, unlocked it, and pulled up a random picture of my fiancee and our cat. Whatever this thing was, it was robbing them more than me. I heard my neck snap beneath the crushing power of something's jaws before I felt it. I woke up screaming."

*Note: This one is what gives me chills because a man was found butchered beyond recognition at a bus stop near my complex. This happened yesterday.*

All this has to be coincidence right? Psychics aren't real, they're just scam artist who pray on the weak and emotionally vulnerable. So this is just some weird mind trick or coincidence. It has to be.
