[First:](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fz6zph/im_never_doing_door_to_door_sales_again/)

It seems like I’ve lost track of time and my voice. The days of picking up jobs blended together. Each one I needed to do alone. No matter how hard I tried I couldn’t form words. Dr. Fillow looked at my throat unable to find an explanation for my sudden lack of speech. In fact, he didn’t find any new issues with my body aside from being underweight.  

Unfortunately, my bad leg remained. From what Dr. Fillow guessed, the flesh between the leg healed over. Right now, it was being held on with magic bandages and whatever spell he used. If I kept straining it, I would lose the leg.  

Ito’s threads lingered healing any wounds everywhere aside from my left hand and bad leg. My hand was the only thing the threads didn’t cover in that void because I had been holding his so tightly. And this leg of mine wasn't my flesh. Magic had a weakness of following orders fairly literally. Ito wished to heal my body. Sure, I paid for this leg, but that didn’t make it truly a part of me.  

I had a theory that a cut-off limb might reattach itself however I hadn’t put that to the test yet. I wasn’t ready to see the limits of this new healing power.  

I hadn’t spoken to anyone about what happened. I just couldn’t. It seems as if the news got around. One night after a long day I was walking through the park nearby when a voice called out my name.   

Honey and Joey had been waiting for me as if they knew I would be coming through. It was dark and it wasn’t a popular park so there wasn’t much of a risk of Honey being seen by a normal person. She forced a large container of treats into my hands no matter how hard I shook my head to refuse. I would die of a sugar overdose if I ate all these baked goods.  

“You look awful.” She huffed crossing her arms.  

I gave her a thumbs up.  

Joey slightly nudged her and awkwardly started to speak.  

“I heard you hurt your throat...” He trailed off unsure if he wanted to bring up what other rumors that were going around. “I joined a LARP group. When you’re doing better you should come by for a session.”  

It was good he started to go out and make friends who shared his interest. I thought of dressing up and acting out fake battles and silently refused. It wasn’t my thing. I would need to think of a gentle way to get out of it when my voice came back.  

“It’s a silly little thing and I’ve been trying to tell Joey he’s better than that.” Honey scoffed. “Humans dressing up pretending they have magic or are monsters makes my skin crawl. Hey, think creatures are attractive and therefore want to become of them instead of seeing their good qualities.”  

I kept my head still trying to not get into the middle of this.  

“It’s just meant to be fun.” Joey defended himself.  

“You should love yourself instead of pretending to be something else. Did you know Joey can paint? Instead of doing that, he’s rolling around in the mud with stinky weirdos calling himself Joseph The Tamer of The Seven Beast or such nonsense.”  

It seems as if this had been an ongoing strain between them. Joey humored Honey which was good. Months ago, this kind of conversation would have destroyed him.   

“I can paint and LARP. Richmond looks tired, let’s head home.”  

He thankfully knew when to leave. I waved them off and for some reason, Honey dipped down to give me a tight hug. It would have been pleasant if she hadn’t almost crushed my neck. Watching them go, I realized I needed to start checking in with the people I cared about. And yet, I couldn’t muster the energy for a simple text.  

Evie and April were the next two who ambushed me. A knock came on my door waking me. I didn’t even remember getting back to my apartment that night. Slowly I made my way over to let them inside wondering how they found my address.  

April made a face and stayed behind Evie. She literally slapped a shiny rough white rock into my hand and darted away leaving Evie behind saying my apartment smelled too bad to stay.  

When did I last change my clothing let alone wash it? I walked over to open the window to air out some of the musty smell.  

“You look like the dead. And smell like it, Go take a shower.” Evie gently ordered.  

I was too tired to argue. After a quick wash, I found her in my small kitchen with a cooked bowl of instant noodles. I didn’t have anything else to eat in my apartment. She forced me to sit down and eat, my stomach rolling. Again, I didn’t know when I last ate so my body was rejecting having so much at once. Somehow, I kept it down.  

Evie talked while I ate. Mostly about what had been going on while I was busy with work. Poor Lucas got his first flu and August freaked out over it. First signs of a fever and he hauled the kid off to a doctor. After two days off school, he recovered but the stress of his son feeling ill nearly took August out. I felt guilty I hadn’t contacted him recently. I would have liked to listen to what he had going on but felt like I had nothing to add to a conversation.  

“Hold still so can do what I came here for.” Evie said which made me only slightly worried.  

She pulled out a small bag and found a cloth to put around my shoulders. I didn’t protest as she started to comb my still-damp hair to give it a trim. It had been almost a year since I got it cut. I expected her to bring out a razor. Most of the time I would shave my head fairly short to save time and money. The last time I did that, my old partner almost cried over how bad I looked. Since then, I kept it longer for her.  

Instead of chopping it all off Evie styled it. It still grazed my shoulders but it no longer looked like I had been lost in the woods for a few months.   

“There. Don’t let it get so bad next time. I hate to think of what you would look like if you could grow a beard.”  

I tried to smile but it might have come out appearing forced. She talked to me a bit longer than needed to leave for work. She scolded me for not taking care of myself for a few minutes. I still had the bundle of baked goods from Honey. As a thank you I gave them to her. She tried to refuse claiming it would make her gain too much weight. I wrote down that she would still be pretty and showed her the note which caused her to punch my arm.   

It was a weird feeling having someone worry about my well-being. She was right, I did need to take better care of myself. After she left any motivation to do so drained away.  

I was going to pick up a job after she left but found my inbox empty. A new text message came in. Cameron found a new meme she needed to share with me. We sent a few back and forth for a couple of minutes. She must have also heard about my recent troubles and wanted to help the only way she knew how. She offered to come over. I refused. I know most people would have jumped on that offer. She was attractive but at this point, I saw her as a friend. It would be too weird to change our relationship.  

Then she offered to give me her cousin's number. I hated myself for almost accepting. I’d just lost Ito and now I was considering jumping into bed with someone else? How low could I go. I felt disgusted with myself for my reaction. I thanked her again for trying to look out for me but I wasn’t interested in being with anyone at that moment.   

Spending the night with someone was tempting. I knew I had options. In the past, I had a bad habit of bouncing from one person to the next whenever things weren’t going well. I wanted to be better than that. For now, I would use work to keep my mind off those creeping thoughts that refused to leave my heart alone.  

Since August had his hands full with his family, we didn’t see each other until we finally accepted the same job. An emergency request went out to anyone who was available. There weren’t too many details regardless I accepted it and hurried out of my apartment.  

My memories were so fuzzy around that time. I wasn’t certain if the call came a few hours after my conversation with Cameron or a few days later. All my jobs felt the same. The second I arrived I realized this one would be different. An odd feeling was in the air, and it made my skin crawl.   

We were called for a job inside a small abandoned town. A large apartment complex stood slowly being taken over by nature. Each road was deadly silent and every house empty of life. This was a ghost town, and it felt like it. Since it was out of the way all sorts of creatures could cause problems without prying eyes.   

I expected to see some other Contract Workers to go over whatever vague details we had. August and April found me outside the abandoned apartment building ready to go inside. For some odd reason, I didn’t want to see them here. April scrunched her nose as if I still smelled.   

An expression came over August’s face that wasn’t related to the job. He quietly stopped in front of me to get a better look at my face as if he didn’t recognize the person in front of him.  

“You... Lost a lot of weight...” He commented.  

I shrugged. Working a lot will do that to you. I pointed to the apartment door signaling I didn’t want to stand around. A voice caused us to stop from moving on.  

“You again?”   

A pair arrived and it took me a few seconds to remember who they were. I met them on the snowy mountain a while ago. The tall girl scowled seeing who else she had to work with. Her shorter shy partner swiftly kicked the back of her leg and grabbed her jacket to force her down so she could whisper something into her ear. Her partner's expression softened but she still didn’t want to work with me around.  

“We’ll work outside and you deal with the inside, deal?”  

I nodded glad we could get along.   

A terrible sound echoed down the street. A dark shape rose from the side of the road as a bundle of stitched-together flesh started to move. The pair of girls went into action.  

“I got it.” The taller one shouted behind her back and she darted down the road.  

She was halfway to the creature before her partner could start moving as she called after her. I trusted the pair would be fine.   

April wanted to find something to fight and possibly chew on. She hurried inside the apartment building ready to rip apart anything she found.  

The lobby was filled with trash. The walls were covered with layers of yellowing papers. April quickly got on all fours to dig around looking for creatures. I opened my mouth to tell her to be careful and not to eat anything gross but nothing came out. I frowned frustrated being unable to communicate with the people I care about.  

A set of arms came from behind to pin my arms to my side. For half a second, I thought it was an attack. August held me tightly, resting his chin on the top of my head which confused me.   

“You should head home and get some rest. After this job, we should hang out.” He said.  

I shrugged him off. Now wasn’t the time for this conversation. We needed to focus on why we were called here.   

A burst of movement came from behind the front lobby desk. It went straight for April. Everything felt like it moved in slow motion. My feet slipped on the dirty floor as the vision of Ito’s half-destroyed face flashed before my eyes. She turned too slowly and wouldn’t be able to defend herself in time. On reflex, I pulled magic from the building instantly feeling sick from the tainted nature of it.  

A burst of speed got my body between hers and the large set of claws coming down. I let them dig into my side as I used the arm August gave me to rip off the creature’s head. Since the creature’s body was held together with glue and threads it wasn’t overly hard to take down. My heart refused to slow down as the fear of losing another person overshadowed the pain for a moment.  

I ripped the claws from my side letting the flesh heal over gritting my teeth from the hot flashes of pain. Ito’s threads had also done something to my right arm. It no longer felt like something stuck on but instead, it was like a part of my body. It felt comfortable and was far easier to transform into a set of claws that now had a copper-like shine to the hard protective dark shell. I wondered why his threads affected the new arm and not my leg but didn’t have any answers.   

August and April didn’t move. They appeared stunned at my actions. After all, I hadn’t updated them on the new healing ability. I doubted they knew about what had happened recently.  

After this job, I would fill them in. August knew that. He walked over to look over the creature that tried to hurt his sister.  

His longer fingers poked around the body following along a detailed line of spell work. The creature appeared sloppy; however, it took a lot of skill and control to even get something like this to move.   

He tore inside and pulled out a small object. It was an old fabric doll that had once held magic. All the spells that made the creature move had been connected to it acting like a battery.   

Seeing this made me assume the creator was either a human or a weaker creature. A stronger creature would have poured its power inside. I doubted a Hunter made this thing due to their hatred of the supernatural, but this might have been some sort of test weapon. They had a bad habit of creating abominations, letting them get out of control, and leaving The Corporation to clean up the mess.   

I didn’t think it overly mattered who created this mess. We were here to clean it.   

August destroyed the doll so it couldn’t be used by anyone else. Meanwhile, April poked at my side wondering how it healed. I gently pushed her hand away. A headache started to form. If August noticed I suddenly started to feel unwell he would try and get me to go back home. We needed to keep moving.   

The email for the job didn’t give many details. Aside from patchwork creatures what was going on here? We carried on to the stairway tense expecting almost anything to jump out. Something did. A disgusting body made up of countless pieces of flesh peeled away from the wall with a sickening sound. It took some papers and trash with it revealing the dirty concrete behind it.  

August easily took the monster down. He looked over his shoulder when the task was done realizing I hadn’t moved. My body locked up as dread filled my every cell. A ringing came to my ears and my jaw locked up so hard I thought I chipped a tooth.  

Behind the trash on the walls was one word written over again in different languages. Each frantically sprawled out as if done by a madman.   

Pride.  

Air refused to fill my lungs. I now knew why we were here. I’ve seen this before. Greed at the hoarder house Lupa personally investigated.   

Sloth... What Shu had been infected with. And now Pride.  

I’ve never heard of a power related to sins before. That must be for a reason. The Corporation didn’t want people to know about this. They had kept the existence of an odd power hidden. Would Shu have been affected if she had known about it beforehand? I’d already lost someone to this. I refused to let anything happen to August and April.  

Looking up I strained my eyes trying to spot anything strange in the apartment complex. I could see flickers of magic where stitched-together monsters lay dormant. I could ignore those for now. On the top floor was something odd. A void in magic. Just a blank space as if an entire room didn’t exist.   

I tried to think of what would cause that. It took a few moments for it to click.  

Iron. It dulled supernatural senses. I’ve never needed to try and look through it but with thick enough walls, it would be nearly impossible to see through even with my eyesight. But not fully impossible.  

It felt like my head would split open and I pressed on. The pain was worth it to see three small flickers of power above us. They were human based on the amount of magic. Most supernatural creatures considered humans to not even have magic based on how much their bodies held. A child had an even smaller amount. I couldn’t see clearly inside that room. Only the larger light moving towards the smaller pair. Then the smallest light cut out.  

I already knew what happened but didn’t want to accept it. If I wanted to save the second light, I needed to get to that room in the next few seconds.  

It was over ten floors above us with so many monsters in-between. August wouldn’t be able to create a doorway connection. He needed permission to use doors he’d never gone through or had been to the location before.   

Rushing over to the first door I placed my hand on the frame taking hold of any magic around us. It was just making a connection, how hard could it be?   

Saying I almost died attempting a spell I wasn’t built for was an understatement. I was nearly torn apart on a cellular level. It was either Ito’s threads holding my body together or my stubbornness. The connection clicked after a few seconds. Throwing open the door I forced myself inside with a great deal of resistance. It felt like I was pressing against a silky sheet slowly ripping and giving away.  

It broke and I tumbled inside, body burning unable to stand. My vision swam as blood poured from my nose and mouth. The fact I was alive was a miracle. Still, I pushed hard to move before I should have been desperate to save a life.  

When my eyes cleared up, I saw I had been far too late.  

A man with blonde hair stood, still smoking gun at his side. His face empty of emotion staring at what he had just done.  

August followed behind me also affected by the unstable connection. He could barely stand. His face twisted in a strained rage I’d never seen from him before when he took in the scene in front of us.  

The man noticed the interruption. A shaken smile on his face.  

“They were my pride and joy...” He said refusing to look down.  

A woman on her back was at his feet, blood pooling from the single gunshot that ended her life. Next to her was a smaller body. The sight made me nearly sick.  

This man was well dressed. He clearly had enough money to buy magic-laced items and create those monsters. And for what purpose?   

The room was covered with more offerings. His sacrifice started something. His goal was to make an opening between worlds to take control of a power he could never understand. A banging echoed through the room as whatever was on the other side frantically tried to rip through.  

My mouth opened trying to tell August we needed to leave. Nothing came out. On shaking feet, I stood taking hold of his arm. He appeared confused and yet he trusted me.  

“You both will be thanking me shortly! I’ll be taking control of a God!” The man shouted over the booming sounds. A wind picked up inside the room as it started to shake unable to handle the power that was so close to coming through. “There will be no more hunger, no more pain because of-”  

We were by the door when his words were cut off. I shoved August through first to get him to the first floor again but paused to watch the scene play out.  

A burst of magic tore through swimming through the air overtaking his body. He screamed unable to stop it as it swirled around him, changing him. He brought forth this with the best intentions unaware that he would not be the one to control the God-like power he had been looking for. A burst of laughter overtook the room as the thing that had been rightfully sealed away was finally free. It had a sea of normal magic. A power so immense it was hard to look at. But it also had that odd power that I now knew was related to different sins.   

This was now far too beyond what we could deal with. I pressed through the doorway a moment before the connection broke. August and April needed to haul my body outside as I regained enough strength to move. To our horror, the apartment complex was swept up. Pieces came apart floating away into the sky as the new God-like creature’s laughter filled the air.  

Around us, more power came down surrounding the entire small ghost town. It was a wall keeping us inside. I mentally swore looking for a weak spot. I needed to get August and April out of here. If they stayed, they would die. Simple as that.  

The God stood on top of a platform of floating wreckage looking down at us. His power attracted itself to the half-made creatures transforming them into something else. Their bodies became solid, larger, and much harder to deal with. The pieces of the building slowly moved along, the pieces making a messy stairway up to the golden God, monsters lining each larger platform ready to strike.  

One of those things would be enough to kill us. And we were now dealing with over a hundred on top of a monster stronger than most Agents I knew. I expected those beasts to start attacking. He didn’t even consider us worth enough to use a single ounce of magic to defeat. A flick of a hand brought down large pieces of stone and steel beams that had once been the apartment.   

August and I got in front of April. I forced magic into my clawed hand swatting away what came down on us. I felt my arm strain and break only for it to heal a second later. Each time I connected to the pieces I forced power inside to blast them apart. Poor April was overwhelmed. She had hunched over, hands over her ears and eyes shut tight. The sheer strength coming from the beast above us was enough to send her reeling. August did a good job defending in the same way. He was too slow once and took a very large blow to the head knocking him over.  

Everything was a panicked blur. Finally, the rocks stopped falling. I stood breathing heavily, my arm in so much pain it refused to move. Glancing to my side I saw a larger piece of a thick wall pinning down a wing of a massive white bird. The girl beside it uselessly pushed at the heavy obstacle with tears in her eyes. I realized the bird was the taller girl of the pair we met before. I wanted to help them. But I looked over to see how April was doing first.  

She was shaking trying to keep it together. When I saw August on the ground, head bleeding my world tilted. The thought of them dying here overtook everything else.  

August was strong, but he wasn’t able to crystalize like I had seen before. That power came from his home. A rock to the head wouldn’t kill him, but he wouldn’t last a second if the other monsters attacked.  

I frantically looked around trying to find a way out of this. The barrier that kept us inside was far too strong to break through. August and April weren’t strong enough to stay alive. The stronger of the pair of girls that took the job was pinned down. There wasn’t anyone else inside this town that could fight.   

My throat locked up. I thought I was suffocating. I needed to think of a way out of here and yet my mind was completely paralyzed.   

The smallest glimmer of hope appeared above us. The barrier of magic that came down around us was keeping us trapped. It also kept this scene from any prying eyes. However, The Corporation would have noticed the burst of power arriving before the barrier came down. We were stuck inside; however, it appeared like it would let people enter.  

The person who came through was someone I knew of but never met before. When I realized who it was the situation felt far more hopeless.  

Agent Jan was known to be called in to deal with stronger creatures most were unable to. He burst through the barrier above the golden God; his long gray dreadlocks tied back out of his face so he could focus. As he was falling downward, he raised a hand to look through a small space he made with his finger and thumb. His dark skin matched his suit jacket with a purple tie flying loose creating a splash of color. Jan's face was completely calm despite the mass of power directly below him.  

The God’s face twisted in a deranged smile welcoming the oncoming attack. A pinprick of light appeared in front of his face, and a blast of wind coming off of the ball of magic caused his long glowing hair to flow upwards. The spot was so small and yet powerful. Jan focused all his power into a tiny space that overshadowed the God’s sea of magic. Within the next second, it would expand erasing not only the threat but the entire area for miles from the face of the Earth.  

I uselessly threw myself over April and August knowing I couldn’t save them from what was about to happen. Jan's arrival here was an order from Lupa. He would refuse to waste risking a resource to save a handful of Contract Workers. Deep down I understood. This God would wipe out not only this world but a few others if it wasn’t taken care of quickly. I held both tightly praying our deaths would be quick.  

Instead of expanding, the spot of power flickered out. I felt that odd power reach out snuffing out the magic. Turning my head, I saw a bemused expression come over Agent Jan’s face. Logically, everyone but him should be dust right now. Most of the time, magic is simple. More power wins a fight. It should have been impossible for God, as strong as he was to erase the power threatening his life.  

Jan landed on a floating platform, bracing himself. The God swiped his hand sending a blast in the Agent's direction knocking him to the ground and out of the fight. Most Agents take the job to save others. Some people like Jan do it because they want to find someone who can match their skills. He wasn’t dead, but I doubted he would have been upset dying to a stronger opponent.   

The Agent I assumed would have had the best chance of defeating this threat had just been knocked aside as if he was nothing.  

“Is that all? I knew I was powerful but surely there must be someone who can face me! Hurry! Cry out! Beg for help! Bring more of those lowly Agents here so I may crush them like the insects they are!” The voice rang out, clear and sweet sounding despite the threatening nature of it.  

The creatures responded to an unspoken order. A handful of them jumped down from the platform towards our small group. I raised a clawed hand ready to defend once again. Thankfully Jan’s failure had been noticed right away. Another Agent came through, jumping along the platforms gracefully until they reached the ground.  

It was another person I hadn’t met before, and I wasn’t aware of their name. She was tall with high black heels adding to her height. Long dark hair flowed behind as she swiftly removed a sword from her side ready to fight.  

Within seconds she had sliced apart the creatures only for them to reform once more. Half her face was covered with a sheet of black fabric, but her eyes did not give away any concern. Her left leg had been wrapped with white strips of fabric that also wrapped around the sword sheath. Countless wrapping shot out ripping apart the creatures adding to her defense. Right now, we were safe for as long as she could keep those monsters back.  

August stood next to me, half his face covered with blood from the blow. He tried to keep up with the situation. His face stern but I saw his hand slightly tremble.   

The creatures were connected to the golden God’s power. His bright face and clear eyes displayed no signs of stress. It was as if his magic source was endless. No, it was being refilled. Any time he used a small amount of his normal magic, the odd power broke off changing into a regular source of magic. Seriously what was this sin magic? I didn’t understand it. Where did it come from. What were its limits? And how did it counter Jan’s power the way that it did?   

I thought our situation hit rock bottom. It couldn’t get any worse without someone dying first. Then, a familiar face arrived. The Agent after Jan was simply defense. They were sent to see how he failed. The person who was in charge of taking this God down had been semi-retired. Only acting when threats of this importance showed up.  

My chest tightened when my eyes landed on a friendly face.  

“I haven’t seen you in a while Lock. Still as annoying as ever.” The newcomer spoke through his scarred lips.  

The God's face fell into a mixture of anger and happiness. This was going to become personal.  

“Klauvarious!” The God shouted back his anger fading into excitement.   

I expected him to attack first. Instead, Klaus got the first blow in. He charged forward almost faster than I could follow, slamming his fist into Lock’s face with so much magic it should have vaporized his skull. And yet, nothing happened. An invisible wall of the different powers came up blocking the blow and removing all traces of magic from reaching the target.  

No matter what Klaus did, he had no way of hurting his target. A nightmare started to unfold in front of my eyes. Lock wouldn’t make this end quickly. He let Klaus keep throwing blows that didn’t land. The semi-retired Agent’s body shifted to a more monstrous form. His hands turned into large claws and smoke poured from his mouth between the scars covering his face. White glowing eyes shone through locked on his goal. No matter how hard he tried he couldn’t do a single ounce of damage. Each time his attack failed he was tossed aside, his body being slowly ripped apart from his magic backfiring.  

I didn’t want to watch this and yet I couldn’t look away. Klaus was going to lose. His death would be slow and there was nothing I could do about it. The Corporation wouldn’t want to spare more Agent’s. The easiest way to solve this was to seal away the God. The issue was it would be easier to seal him within this world than sending him to an empty one. To them, it was better to sacrifice one plant than risk others.   

It didn’t feel as if I was standing on solid ground. I kept sinking deeper down realizing this was it. No backup was coming. Everything I cared about was going to end here.  

August would die before his son trying to defend his sister. This God had the power to conceal himself from normal humans until it was too late. Most of the world wouldn’t know what was coming before the end. And I couldn’t do a damn thing to stop it.   

My hands dropped to my side as my eyes closed accepting our fate. My main regret now was that I still couldn’t speak. But what would I tell August? That I was sorry I couldn’t save us? We didn’t stand a chance from the start. It was bound to happen sooner or later. After accepting my death and everyone I cared about I only could mentally muster up a single sentence.  

This sucks.
