Kinda sounds like a Santa Claus song eh? 
I could only wish it was good ole St.Nick. 
I don’t have a name for this unknown terrifying creature so I call IT, IT. 

It all started about 2015 when I moved to the North to the Rocky Mountains in the Idaho Panhandle. I went adventuring riding my 4 wheeler deep into the woods, just exploring and loving the isolation of having nobody else around. I packed extra gas a pick ax and shovel to do a Little Rock hounding as Idaho is the gem state. I planned on making this just a day trip as I had plenty of sunlight until at least 9 o’clock as it was the middle of June. 

I took off down a trail behind my house after mapping out the area, I planned on taking my quad as far as I could before, jumping off and hiking into some uncharted territory, as I thought some of the best finds would be where very little people if any had gone there. 
It was a beautiful day about 80 degrees with a little breeze, the trail was fun, hills, tight turns, even some big boulders embedded in the trail as some of it was part of an old logging road. The further I went, the more rugged and rough the terrain was, it slowed me down a little but I was out just enjoying the day. 

I logged in about 20 miles of trails on my 4 wheeler and found a thick forest with steep mountains and big boulders in my way. So I figured this is as good place as any to start hiking and exploring. It was tough going and along the way I found several quartz veins in the side of the mountain I rummaged around, busted some of it up in hopes I might find some gold. As the afternoon went on I figured I better go on ahead if I’m going to get to the uncharted area I picked out. 

As I continued on I noticed a big hole in the ground I almost fell into. Kinda like the cave from the movie the descent. It was an amazing sight, probably an old abandoned mine shaft over 100 years old. No warnings it was there I just stumbled upon it. I threw a rock down to see if I could hear it hit the bottom, and it did after several seconds, so I knew it was a deep hole, and very dark too even in the daylight. 

After exploring around the opening searching for ore and unique rocks in which I found some pretty big chunks of red garnet and a few samples of opal beautiful stones. I noticed it was getting late, damn I thought it’s 730pm already. I made a note of my find and pinpointed the location so I could go back, Then I started my hike back to my 4 wheeler. As I was leaving I heard some weird indescribable shriek coming from down in the dark deep hole, It sounded like it was pretty far away but it still sent chills down my spine and made me speed walk away after gathering my tools and rocks. As I was hiking back to my 4 wheeler I couldn’t help like feeling I was being watched and constantly had to look over my shoulder. Not much I could see as the forest was crazy thick up in this part of the woods. 

Darkness was falling in quick on me as I was almost back to my 4 wheeler, then I heard that demonic shriek from the path i just came from, and it sounded just like the one from the mine shaft but only closer out in the woods now. I felt the hair on my neck stand straight up and I now had goosebumps all over. I felt as if I was in fight or flight mode so I chose to start jogging in the direction of my quad. I could see it about 50 yds ahead at the edge of the tree line. I thought to myself almost there just gotta keep moving. Just as I reached my 4 wheeler I heard tree branches snapping and underbrush being mowed down like something big is rushing through the forest heading in my direction. 

I fired up my quad and floored it onto the rough trail my shovel flew off the 4 wheeler rack and I just left it. About 80 yards from where I took off I turned to look behind me and there IT stood. Ungodly skinny, tall, and pale as a ghost with no hair, bright gleaming yellow eyes two horns on its head like a big horn sheep and long gangly arms with giant hands and claws like a wolverine about 7 ft tall at least. It had a head like an elk big nose and it was staring right at me. I heard it growl or roar over my quad engine then it took off towards me at a speed I didn’t think I could outrun even on my Kawasaki Brute 750 which easily did 60mph. 

I navigated the rough trail the best I could almost losing control several times pushing 40 mph and it was crashing through trees gaining on me. As luck would have it I made it to the old logging road where I could open it up full throttle 60 mph the whole way and I would glance back at every straightaway to see where IT was. Fortunately I was losing It. Still IT was not giving up. I finally got out on the main road it must’ve been 1030 now as the moon was out and it was pretty dark. I floored it the final 3 miles to my driveway and finally let off the gas and parked my quad in the shed. Being aware of my surroundings I crept to my house got in and locked the doors and windows I didn’t know wether or not that thing was still following me or what? Just when I thought all was good I heard that demonic evil sound that it made before at the mine and in the woods. I thought oh my god no way it followed me all the way home and found me. 

I peeked out my window out into an open meadow in my front yard and at the edge of the tree line about 75 yards out I was disturbed by what I seen. There IT was standing bipedal and puffing out it’s chest making that god awful noise. I could hear it through my house. It was walking back and forth just pacing waiting hoping I would come back out. Surely IT couldn’t see me but it suddenly cocked its head and looked right at me peeking through my shades on my window. I quickly closed them. Got on the phone with the fish n game explaining to them I was being stalked by some creature. They insured me it was just wildlife and I told them to come out to my address and see for themselves. It took about an hour for them to get there the creature was there then wasn’t. Of course when the two wardens got to my residence there was no sight of IT. 

We talked for several minutes, I could tell they weren’t believing any of my story. They even had the gall to assume I was drinking or on drugs. Shortly after they left I decided I needed to go to bed I was exhausted. Maybe I did just hallucinate all that who knows. 
I was woken up by some strange scratching noises outside of my bedroom window. I checked the clock it was 3 am. I was terrified to peek out my window as I had an idea of what I’d see. Sure enough as soon as I peeked there was it’s big head yellow glowing eyes peering right at me as if it was looking through my soul. Then it smiled with rows of razor sharp teeth. I closed the blinds. Thinking no this is not happening. Waited a few moments looked again and it was gone.

The next morning I looked outside at the siding on my house, outside of my bedroom and sure as shit there was deep claw marks all over the side of my house. I knew now that this all was very real and not a nightmare. I have lived in the same house for 8 years now as it is 2023 and everyday and every night that thing is watching me, it makes sure I know of it’s presence. It hasn’t done any harm to me yet. But it’s probably just waiting to catch me slipping. I only go to work and stay inside my house year round now because It knows when I’m sleeping and knows when I’m awake. Just patiently waiting for my final mistake.
