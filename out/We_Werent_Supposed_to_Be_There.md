**Author’s Note:**  
I heard this story a few years ago from a guy I met at a small party near the Missouri/Arkansas border. He didn’t tell it for attention—he just sort of dropped it in the middle of a conversation, dead serious, no punchline. I’ve thought about it ever since. Figured it was time to write it down.

I don’t tell this story often. It’s not mine, exactly—I heard it from a guy I met at a little house party near the Missouri/Arkansas border. Just some regular Midwest evening, beers and a fire in someone’s backyard. He wasn’t the dramatic type, didn’t seem like the kind to make up stories. But when he started talking, everyone else just got quiet. No jokes, no interruptions.

He and his buddy had gone on a weekend camping trip years back. Nothing fancy, just a little hunting, a little drinking, and getting away from town for a while. They headed deep into the Ozarks, taking an old two-lane highway that cuts through the middle of nowhere, where the trees start to feel like walls and the sun disappears earlier than it should.

Eventually, they turned off onto a narrow dirt road—one of those winding, unmarked paths that seem to go forever. No signs, no fences. Just woods. After several miles, they found a decent clearing and decided it would do.

By the time they got there and set up, it was 1 am, dead of night. No moon, no stars—just thick trees and black sky. The only light they had was from their flashlights and the occasional flicker from a lighter. Everything around them felt heavy and still.

They pitched their tents in silence, then grabbed a couple flashlights and headed off into the dark to find wood for a fire.

That’s when they saw it.

At first, it was just a flicker—like the reflection of firelight bouncing off leaves deep in the woods. They figured maybe another group was camping nearby. Nothing too strange.

But as they got closer, it felt… off.

The light wasn’t small like a campfire. It was big. Bright orange. Crackling. They slowed their pace, weaving through trees until they could get a better look.

That’s when they saw them.

A ring of people—maybe a dozen, maybe more—stood silently around a massive bonfire. No tents, no gear, no sounds. Just figures silhouetted by flame, standing completely still. Not moving. Not talking. Not reacting.

The guys didn’t stick around to find out more. Something about it felt wrong. Like they weren’t supposed to see it. Like they had walked in on something ancient and private.

They turned around, fast. Didn’t speak until they were back at their site. Then they tore everything down as quickly as they could, adrenaline making their hands clumsy and shaking. Forty-five minutes later, they were back in the truck, bouncing down the dirt road toward civilization.

Eventually they reached the end of the dirt road, where it met the old two-lane highway—the same one they’d come in on. Right at that junction, there was a tiny gas station. Just one pump, flickering sign, wood siding. It looked abandoned at first, but the lights were on.

They figured they’d stop—gas was running low, and they didn’t want to break down out here.

They walked in, still shaken but trying to act normal.

The cashier didn’t say hello. Didn’t ask what pump. Didn’t even look surprised to see them.

He just stared at them both, dead in the eye, and said:

“If we ever see you again out here, we’ll fucking kill you next time.”

No emotion. No explanation.

They didn’t respond. Just backed out, got in the truck, and peeled off down the two-lane road toward the highway—and didn’t look back.

Neither of them ever went back. They didn’t even talk about it again, as far as I know. The guy telling the story just kind of shrugged at the end, like he still didn’t know whether it was a threat… or a warning.
