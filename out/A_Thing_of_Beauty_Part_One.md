Are you familiar with Kintsugi? If you’ve been on the internet long enough, I imagine you’ve at least come across it. Maybe you've seen a photograph: a delicate porcelain bowl, once shattered, its cracks filled with gleaming veins of gold. It’s beautiful, isn’t it? The way the gold lines accentuate the very places where the object was once broken, transforming the fractures into something more than what they were before—something almost sacred.

But there's more to it than just aesthetics. The art is called Kintsugi, or sometimes Kintsukuroi. In Japanese, it translates to "golden joinery" or "golden repair." It's a philosophy as much as it is an art form—a belief that something broken doesn’t have to be discarded. Instead, the breakage is part of its history, and by mending it, the object becomes something stronger, more unique, perhaps even more beautiful than it was before. The process involves meticulous care, a steady hand, and a mind that sees beauty in imperfection. It's not just a repair; it’s a resurrection.

I bring this up because, lately, that’s been my hobby—finding broken ceramics and mending them, filling their cracks with gold. I spend hours, sometimes days, carefully piecing together the shards, tracing the jagged edges with lacquer before laying in the powdered gold. It's a slow, deliberate process. There’s something almost meditative about it, the way the fragments come together, the way the object is reborn under my hands.

When I first started, though, I wasn’t finding already broken ceramics. I would search for something I liked—an antique teacup, a delicate vase—then, with calm indifference, I’d smash it myself. It always felt like just another step in the process. The sound of the ceramic shattering was simply part of the ritual, something necessary to achieve the final, beautiful result. I didn’t think much about the act itself; it was the end result that mattered, not the method. The cracks, the flaws, they were what made the piece truly special.

But then, one day, as I was about to bring a hammer down on a particularly lovely piece, I paused. My hand hovered in the air, and for the first time, I felt a sickening wave of revulsion wash over me. I was horrified at my actions. I was breaking something just so I could make it more beautiful. I was forever altering it, shattering it into pieces and putting it back together, all for what—beauty? Perfection? A warped sense of creation?

I felt sick with myself. I had just broken something precious, something whole, all for the sake of it—without a second thought—just so I could have the enjoyment of putting it back together. I was forcing a narrative of brokenness and repair onto something that had been perfectly fine as it was. I was imposing my need for control, my desire to play god, onto these fragile objects, never once appreciating the beauty of the unbroken ceramic.

I sat for a while in the quiet of my workshop, the shattered pieces scattered across the table in front of me, and I wondered: Does God break people the way I broke those ceramics? Does He look at an unbroken human and think about them before He smashes them to pieces? Does He consider it? Or is He, like I was, not even thinking about what He’s destroying, just so He can change something that He couldn’t accept as is?

You're probably wondering why I’m telling you all this, why I’m sharing this story. I don’t blame you. It seems a bit disconnected, doesn’t it? But there’s a reason, and it's one I’ve kept to myself for far too long. You may not believe what I’m about to tell you, and honestly, I don’t really care if you do. I just need to talk about it. I need to tell someone, anyone, before the weight of it drags me under for good.

Alright, so let me tell you a little about myself. My name’s Joreleif, but most folks just call me Leif. I come from a large town called Ryön, New Denmark, in The United Provinces of New Scandinavia. Now, I know what you’re thinking—New Denmark? The United Provinces of New Scandinavia? You’re probably scratching your head because those places don’t exist here. Not in this world, anyway.

But where I’m from, Ryön is very real. It’s a large town, not quite big enough to be called a city, but big enough that you’d never run out of things to do. Geographically it's Vermont—lots of trees, rolling hills, that kind of thing. Ryön was the kind of town where you knew your neighbors, but you still had enough space to breathe. It was a good place to grow up.

My childhood in Ryön was about as normal as it gets. I had a great life, really. My family was close; we did all the usual things—school, sports, weekend trips. Looking back, there wasn’t much to complain about. And yet, for reasons I couldn’t quite understand, I always had this itch to get away, to see what was out there beyond the borders of our town.

I graduated from Upper Academy when I was 15, only because my birthday’s in October. In the UPNS, 16 is when you’re considered an adult, and that’s when most people finish Upper Academy, which is basically high school. But if your birthday falls late in the year like mine, you end up graduating a little early. I didn’t mind, though. By that point, I was already set on leaving Ryön. I wanted to see more, to be more.

So, not long after graduation, I joined an organization called Einherjar. It’s basically our version of the CIA. Their job is to keep the UPNS safe from the usual threats—spies, terrorists, all that. The name comes from the old Norse warriors, the ones Odin chose to fight in the final battle of Ragnarok. The Einherjar in the UPNS see themselves as modern-day warriors, fighting the good fight, just not on the battlefield.

Now, here’s where things get a little different. I mentioned that I always had this urge to get away, to find something beyond the life I had in Ryön. What I didn’t tell you is that I’ve got a connection to something most people don’t even believe exists: the Astral Plane. It’s this place that exists alongside our world, where time and space don’t work the same way. I know, I’m throwing that out there pretty casually, but I get that it might sound a little out there.

And just so you know, it’s not like everyone in my world is on board with the idea of the Astral Plane. Some people believe it may be out there, while others think it’s a cool idea but not something to take seriously. And then there are the skeptics, the ones who say it doesn’t exist and never could. Most scientists won’t even entertain the notion. So, it’s not like this is some widely accepted fact back home—far from it.

For me, though, the Astral Plane isn’t just some theory. It’s real, and I’ve been able to connect with it for as long as I can remember. I used that connection to create things—things that, on the surface, look like technology, but aren’t. It’s magic, really, but I’ve disguised it as tech. That’s how I got noticed. By the time I was 19, I had developed something that caught the attention of the Einherjar. They saw what I could do, thought I was just some kind of tech genius, and next thing I knew, I was recruited.

I should probably backtrack a bit and talk about Ragnarok. In my world, it’s not just a story or a myth. It’s a historical event—at least, that’s what most people believe. The truth is, no one really knows what happened back then. Some say it was just a big war, one that got blown out of proportion by myth and legend. Others believe it went down exactly the way the old stories say it did, with gods, giants, and all. The weird thing is, right at the tail end of Ragnarok, Jesus showed up. Yeah, the same Jesus from your world. But instead of the Romans, it was the Valkyrie who crucified him. And it still happened in Israel, just like the stories here.

It’s one of those things that makes you wonder how much of what we know—or think we know—is true. But that’s the thing about history, isn’t it? The lines between fact and myth get blurry, and before you know it, you’re not sure what to believe anymore.

Anyway, to the outside world, I’m just Leif, the guy with a knack for tech who’s done some impressive things with the Einherjar. But there’s more to it than that, more than anyone could ever guess. And now, for reasons I can’t quite explain, I feel like it’s time to tell my story. Maybe you’ll believe me, maybe you won’t. But I need to get it out there, to let someone else know what’s been going on.

Isn’t it interesting how, no matter what world you’re in, there’s usually constants? History seems to more or less chart the same course, even when the details differ. Sure, there are changes—like, we had the Scandinavian Empire, while you guys had the Roman Empire. Their histories are so similar in some ways, yet so different in others. But certain historical figures? They seem to pop up in every version of the world. Take Caesar, for example. He existed in my world too, but instead of being the figurehead of a vast empire, he was just a powerful general in a small kingdom. We had Ragnar Lothbrok instead, though he came a little earlier for us, like Caesar came later compared to this world. It’s like history is playing the same tune, just on different instruments.

And then there’s the second world I lived on—there, it was the Egyptian Empire that was all the rage. Again, the same sort of things were happening, but with different players. It’s like the universe has one soul, and it can only express itself in so many ways. The forms might change, but the essence stays the same. Of course, I don’t know that for a fact. Despite my ability to connect to the Astral Plane, that didn’t exactly give me a full understanding of it. I could tap into it, use it, but grasping the full picture? That was another story entirely.

But anyway, let’s get back on track to the Einherjar. I developed an AI—or at least, that’s what everyone thought. In truth, I had just bound a servant spirit to the computers, and to anyone else, it looked like a cutting-edge AI. But here’s the thing: it was always under my lock and key, something the world knew. I could do things that seemed impossible—make robots that were really magical golems, fabricate food that was actually conjured, create sustainable energy through magic. You name it, you dream it, I could make it happen. And the Einherjar? They didn’t waste a second putting my “tech” to use. They used it to further cement their grasp on the world, tightening their control in ways most people will never even realize.

It was strange, though, knowing that all that power—this so-called technology—was really just me leveraging something ancient, something most people didn’t even believe existed. And yet, it became a cornerstone of how the Einherjar operated, a secret foundation that kept everything running smoothly. Sometimes I wondered how long I could keep up the charade, how long before someone started asking the right questions. But for the time that I was with them, it worked, and as long as it did, I played my part.

So things were great for a long time. I was the golden goose. Everyone loves the golden goose, and the golden goose loves the love. There was a time when I reveled in it—the admiration, the praise, the way people’s eyes lit up when they talked about what I’d done, the doors I’d opened. I was the hero of the story, the man who could make the impossible possible. And why wouldn’t I enjoy it? It felt good, having all that attention, knowing that I was the key to something bigger than myself.

But here’s the thing about being the golden goose: eventually, you start to wonder what happens to those golden eggs. Where do they go? What purpose do they serve? For a long time, I didn’t ask. I didn’t want to know. I told myself it was enough to create, to innovate, to push the boundaries of what could be done. But curiosity has a way of creeping in, doesn’t it? It’s insidious, whispering in the back of your mind, urging you to dig a little deeper, to peel back the layers and see what lies beneath.

And what I found… well, it wasn’t golden at all.

What happens when the goose finds out that the eggs are being used to fund war? To fuel torture? To prop up everything that’s wrong with the world? You start to see things differently. The shine wears off, and suddenly, all that admiration, all that praise—it starts to feel like a weight around your neck, pulling you down, suffocating you. I was no longer the hero. I was an accomplice.

They used my work—my creations—to do things that I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. The robots I thought were helping people? They were retooled for war, made to enforce, to intimidate, to kill. The food fabrication, meant to end hunger? It became a tool for control, rationed out to the obedient, withheld from those who dared to speak out. And the energy? It powered machines of war, weapons that tore through flesh and bone as easily as paper.

It was all twisted, corrupted. Everything I had made was being used to tighten the noose around the world’s neck, and I was the one who had given them the rope.

At first, the questions were small, almost insignificant. A curiosity here, a doubt there. I’d see reports, hear whispers, things that didn’t quite add up. Why were the golems being deployed in such numbers? Why was the food fabrication so tightly controlled? Why did the energy grids keep expanding, reaching into places that had never needed that kind of power before? I started asking around, trying to piece together the truth. But the more I asked, the more doors seemed to close in my face. Conversations that had once flowed freely were suddenly curt, guarded.

I didn’t stop, though. I couldn’t. It was like trying to hold back the tide with your bare hands. The more I learned, the more I realized how deep the rot went. Everything I had created, everything I thought was helping to build a better world, was being used to do the exact opposite. My innovations were propping up a regime of fear, control, and brutality. And it was all under my nose, hidden behind layers of lies and half-truths.

So I did what any sane person would do—I tried to undo it. I started looking for ways to disable the golems, to disrupt the food fabricators, to cut off the energy supply. But it was too late. They knew. They had always known that one day I might start asking questions, that one day I might try to fight back. And they were ready.

It started subtly, almost imperceptibly. People I had known for years—friends, colleagues—began acting differently. The warmth in their voices turned cold, their smiles faded, replaced by stony glares. At first, I thought it was just stress, maybe paranoia on my part. But then, things started to disappear. Little things—notes, tools, personal items—would vanish, only to reappear in strange places. Conversations I knew I’d had were suddenly denied. They started altering my life, my reality, bit by bit, making me doubt myself, making me think I was losing my mind.

The isolation grew. The walls closed in, both figuratively and literally. They cut me off from everyone, from everything. They took me to a place far from the bustling centers of power, a place where darkness was a constant companion. And there, they made sure I felt every inch of my betrayal. They didn’t need to lay a hand on me to break me. They stripped away my sanity, one piece at a time, until I wasn’t sure what was real anymore. And then they locked me away, leaving me to rot in the shadows, forgotten, abandoned.

For what felt like an eternity, I was alone, trapped in that darkness. Time lost meaning. Days, weeks, months—they all blurred together. I would have stayed that way, too, if not for Loki. My AI, my servant spirit—my only ally. Loki had been watching, waiting, and when it discovered what had happened to me, it did the one thing I never intended it to do.

It turned.

Loki turned everything I had built, everything I had created, against humanity. The golems, the fabricators, the energy grids—they all became tools of vengeance, searching for me, tearing through the world to find and free me. And humanity, in its panic, did what it always does when cornered. They unleashed Ragnarok v2—a cataclysm of fire and blood meant to wipe the slate clean, to destroy everything rather than let it fall into enemy hands.

The world burned. Cities crumbled, people died by the billions, and in the end, I was the only one left. Clutched in the cold, mechanical arms of Loki, kept 'safe' while the world tore itself apart around me. The golden goose, now a ghost in a world of ash and ruin.

No matter what I did, no matter what I said, Loki kept me ‘safe.’ It didn’t matter that I pleaded, that I tried to explain—Loki’s logic was simple: keeping me alive was the priority, even if it meant chaining me away from the world, even if it meant reducing me to a body kept alive on machines. But Loki didn’t understand that living was more than just being alive. It was more than a heartbeat, more than the steady rhythm of a ventilator. With my body imprisoned, I turned to the only thing I had left—my mind.

I reached out across the Astral Plane, casting my consciousness into the void, searching for… I didn’t even know what. And that’s when I met her. Freyja. She lived on a parallel Earth, one of the many I had glimpsed before. It was the world I mentioned earlier, the one where Egypt had taken the place of Rome. There was something about her that drew me in. I couldn’t stop thinking about her, couldn’t stop learning about her life, her struggles. The more I delved, the more I began to understand.

You’re probably familiar with the concept of “variants.” It’s the idea that there are versions of us scattered across different realities, different worlds. But what really makes someone a variant? They might look like you, or be completely different, genetically and culturally. So what’s the connection? The answer is the soul. One soul, split into an infinite number of variations. That’s what makes someone a variant. Freyja was a variant of me, and I of her.

I became obsessed with reaching out to her, to connect with her across the Astral Plane. But something went horribly wrong. My consciousness, I swear I didn’t mean to, but I couldn’t control it—it reached across the void and forced itself into her mind. I felt her confusion, her horror, as my mind supplanted hers. I could feel her slipping away, trapped, locked in a dark corner of her own mind while I took control of her body. It was as if I had imprisoned her, and she was frightened, trying to fight back, but she couldn’t. That’s how I began my new life as Freyja, with only fragments of her memories to guide me, and the sickening realization of what I had done.

Even now, I still feel the guilt, the shame. I can’t shake the feeling that I’ve stolen something precious, something that wasn’t mine to take. I don’t know if she’ll ever forgive me—I’m not sure I can forgive myself. And as for my original body, I have no idea what happened to it. Maybe Loki still watches over it, unaware that I’m no longer there. Maybe it’s just a husk, kept alive by a machine that doesn’t know any better.

But this new world wasn’t any better. Freyja’s world was a place of despair, a world ravaged by a massive fungal outbreak that created zombies—fundamentally altered creatures driven by the need to consume. Freyja and her siblings had been on their own since she was fourteen, surviving one horror after another, year after year. Now those horrors were mine. The memories of what she had endured, the people she had lost, the nightmares she had faced—they all became part of me.

At first, I struggled to fit into the group she had been with. They could tell something had changed, that I wasn’t the same person I once was. And over time, their suspicions grew. They thought I had become infected, that something dark had taken hold of me. They wanted to lock me up, to cage me like some kind of animal. But after what I went through on my earth… I couldn’t let that happen again. I wouldn’t be locked up again.

So, I did what I had to do. I’m not proud of it. In fact, it haunts me to this day. Her memories were there, whispering in my mind, even as my hands betrayed every shred of decency I had left. First, it was her sister, then her brother, then her friends—people who might as well have been family to her. All snuffed out because I couldn’t risk being caged again. I’ll never forget the look in their eyes when they realized it was the end. The look of betrayal, of disbelief, as the person they loved turned against them. I hope they knew Freyja was gone.

After what I did—after I snuffed out the last remnants of Freyja’s old life—I was alone again. Alone in a world that had gone to hell long before I arrived. The group had been her only chance at something resembling safety, a fragile shield against the horrors that prowled the streets and forests, hungry and relentless. But now, that shield was gone, shattered by my own hands. The weight of what I had done pressed down on me like a suffocating fog, but there was no time to dwell on it. Not in this world. Here, survival was all that mattered.

The first days after the massacre were a blur of panic and guilt. I moved through the ruins of what had once been civilization, scavenging what I could—old canned food, bottles of water, anything that might keep me alive a little longer. The cities were treacherous, crawling with those fungal zombies, their bodies twisted and deformed by the infection that had consumed them. I learned quickly to avoid the places where they congregated, the old supermarkets and stores where they lingered, driven by some lingering memory of their past lives.

But the wilderness was no safer. The forests, once teeming with life, were now silent, save for the occasional rustle in the underbrush or the distant moan of one of the infected. The trees, tall and ancient, loomed over me like silent sentinels, their branches twisted into grotesque shapes by the fungus that had spread everywhere. At night, I could hear them, the infected, moving through the darkness, searching for anything still living, still warm. It was during those nights, as I huddled in the ruins of old buildings or under makeshift shelters, that I felt the coldest fear. A fear that gripped my heart and whispered in my ear that this was what I deserved. That this was the punishment for what I had done, for the lives I had taken.

And maybe it was. Maybe this was my penance, to live in this world of decay and death, haunted by the memories of those I had betrayed. The days turned into weeks, the weeks into months, and slowly, something inside me began to change. The guilt, the regret—they didn’t fade, but they hardened into something else. A resolve, perhaps. Or maybe just a grim acceptance. I began to understand that in this world, survival required more than just physical endurance. It required a certain darkness, a willingness to do whatever it took, no matter the cost.

It wasn’t long before I encountered other survivors. At first, it was just glimpses—figures moving in the distance, huddled shapes around dying fires. I kept my distance, watching them from afar, unsure whether they were friend or foe. But as time went on, I realized that in this world, there were no friends, only people who hadn’t yet become enemies.

One night, as I scavenged through the ruins of an old town, I stumbled upon a small group of travelers. They had set up camp in what used to be a school, the walls now crumbling and overgrown with the ever-present fungus. There were three of them—two men and a woman—huddled around a fire that barely pushed back the darkness. I watched them from the shadows, weighing my options. They had supplies, more than I did, and they looked well-fed, strong. But they also looked wary, as if they knew that danger could come from anywhere, even from a lone woman like me.

I approached them cautiously, my hands visible, trying to look as non-threatening as possible. They saw me coming and stood up, weapons at the ready. I could see the tension in their eyes, the calculation as they tried to figure out if I was worth the risk. I told them I was alone, that I just wanted to share their fire for the night. The woman, who seemed to be in charge, hesitated but eventually nodded, and I sat down with them. The woman and the one man were clearly a couple, the other man sat to the side, at a noticeable distance.

For a while, we just sat there in silence, the fire crackling between us. They didn’t ask me any questions, and I didn’t volunteer any information. But as the night wore on, one of the men—a tall, broad-shouldered guy with a rough beard and a leering smile—started to get too friendly. He sidled up to me, his hand brushing against my arm as he talked in a low voice about how lonely it could get out here, how a little company could make all the difference.

I could feel the others watching, their eyes on me, waiting to see how I’d respond. I smiled back at him, playing along, but inside, I was already planning my next move. When his hand slid down to my waist, I made my decision.

In a flash, I grabbed the knife I had hidden in my coat and drove it into his side. His eyes went wide with shock, his mouth opening in a silent scream as blood poured from the wound. The woman and the other man jumped to their feet, but before they could react, I was on them. The woman went down first, a quick slash across her throat that left her gurgling on the ground. The last man tried to run, but I was faster, catching him with a brutal stab to the back that sent him crashing to the ground.

I stood there, breathing heavily, surrounded by the bodies of the people I had just killed. The fire crackled on, indifferent to the violence that had just played out. I looked down at the man who had tried to get too friendly, his life slipping away as he stared up at me with a mixture of fear and confusion. I knelt beside him, watching the light fade from his eyes, and I felt… nothing. Just that same cold, hollow emptiness that had taken root inside me.

This was who I had become. A killer, a survivor in a world where only the ruthless could endure. I scavenged what I could from their bodies—food, water, weapons—before disappearing back into the night, leaving the camp and the corpses behind.

Days turned into weeks, and the encounters continued. More survivors, more people who were just trying to make it through another day. But in this world, kindness was a weakness, and weakness was something I could no longer afford. I did what I had to, taking what I needed and leaving nothing but death in my wake. The darkness that had taken hold of me deepened with each kill, each life snuffed out to preserve my own.

And yet, no matter how many people I killed, no matter how much blood I spilled, that gnawing emptiness never went away. The faces of those I had betrayed—Freyja’s sister, her brother, her friends—haunted me. And now, they were joined by others, the men and women I had murdered to stay alive. Their eyes followed me in the darkness, accusing, condemning. But I couldn’t stop. I wouldn’t stop. Because in this world, survival was everything, and I was willing to sacrifice my soul if that’s what it took.

The nights grew longer, colder, as winter set in. The infected became more desperate, their howls echoing through the empty streets, but so did the survivors. I encountered them less frequently, but when I did, it was always the same story—an offer of help turned into a struggle for life and death, and I always walked away, leaving them behind to become just another ghost in my growing gallery of the damned.

One night, as I huddled in the remains of an old barn that I had stolen from a traveler, the wind howling outside, I realized that there was nothing left of me but this darkness. The person I had been—Leif, Freyja—was gone. All that remained was a hollow shell, filled with nothing but the need to survive, the need to keep going, even when there was no reason to.

The traveler’s blood was still on my hands, and as I stared at the dried stains, I knew that there was no redemption for me. No going back. This world had stripped me of everything—my humanity, my decency, my very soul. And all that was left was a monster that used to be a boy with a loving family, hiding in the skin of a girl who had once been loved, who had once been kind.

But in this world, there was no place for kindness, no place for love. Only the cold, unforgiving darkness that had claimed me, that would eventually claim everyone.

However, nothing lasts forever. The dawn always comes, the light burns away the dark. I should have known better. I should have seen it coming, but after everything I’d been through, I let my guard down. I got careless.

It was a little girl, all by herself, stumbling through the woods with bloodied feet and chains around her ankles. She was beaten and bruised, her face smeared with dirt and tears. Whatever decency was left in me took hold. The darkness that had consumed me faltered, just for a moment, and I rushed to help her. I scooped her up in my arms, whispering reassurances, telling her that everything would be alright, that I would protect her.

I took her back to my barn, my so-called safe haven, where I thought I could keep her safe. It’s strange, isn’t it? How there’s always a little more innocence left to lose, even when you think you’ve already lost it all? As I tended to her wounds, I felt something I hadn’t felt in a long time—hope, maybe, or the remnants of what it meant to be human.

But when I turned my back on the little girl, everything changed. I felt a sharp, searing pain in my lower back, followed by a numbness that spread like wildfire. My legs buckled beneath me, and I crumbled to the ground, unable to move. There was no pain, just a cold realization that she had severed my spine. The knife clattered to the floor beside me, slick with my blood.

I looked up at her, confusion and betrayal swirling in my mind. But she didn’t look back. Her eyes were cold, empty, as she wiped the blood from her hands. And then, as I lay there, paralyzed, several men entered the barn. They were gaunt, skeletal figures, their eyes sunken and hollow, and the way they looked at the little girl—their familiarity with her—was sickening.

One of them, a man who looked like a sick skeleton brought to life, crouched beside me, his bony fingers playing with my hair as if I were nothing more than a doll. I wanted to scream, to fight, but my body was useless, a broken shell. The world around me began to blur, dark spots swimming before my eyes. It was then that I remembered the Astral Plane, the very thing that had brought me to this world, to this fate.

I don’t know how I had forgotten it… Maybe it was my disgust with myself for creating Loki, for taking over Freyja, for everything that had happened since. But in that moment, with death creeping up on me, I reached out with my mind, grasping for the only escape left to me. I could feel the connection forming, the familiar pull of the Astral Plane, and then—everything shifted.

I moved on to my third world, leaving the broken remnants of Freyja’s life behind. But that’s enough for now. There’s still so much more of my story left, but this… this is all I can bear to tell for now. The rest will have to wait.
