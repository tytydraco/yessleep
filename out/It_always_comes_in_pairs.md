Hey hey, i thought about making an online journal. There isnt much of interest in my life but my mom used to tell me one thing over and over. She said "son you have the weirdest case of bad luck i have ever seen, it always comes in pairs.". And to be honest its really true when i think about it. i remember losing my phone once, luckily i found it only to find out my pet hamster chew on the cable of my charger haha. The other day i was drinking with some friends and my girlfriend and i ended up spilling some of it on my new pants!! As i was trying to clean them up i accidentally dropped the glass off the table. It really comes in pairs. 

Oh well, thats gotta be it for the first entry, maybe i will keep you up to date if another such incidents happen.

Its been a while guys, did you miss me? Much has changed over the last couple months! My gf is now my wife!! And boy there were some really funny incidents. I enjoy my new job.. it wasnt the Job i applied for in march but its a job.. Well lets start with the incidents. First i wanted to suprise my gf with a nice engagement ring with a close female friend of mine. A friend of my wife saw it and told her. She thought i was cheating(???). We had a huge fight about it and i had to spoil the suprise for the engagement. I started to notice something. The words of my mother really came into my head when things like that happened. At one point my (then) fiancee asked me why i was always mumbling "it always comes in pairs.". The wedding was nice, but of course i was too optimistic in my luck. Last second my best man cancelled because he got sick and right after that somebody let the wedding cake fall!! My wife was pissed to say at the least haha. Oh well, i am trying to be optimistic and it was a nice wedding after all. Now i am enjoying some Hot choccy with the wife lets hope nothing bad happens haha..

Heeeeeey long time so see.. Well stuff happened and i think i had a streak of luck. Out of coincidence i landed a really good job! Finally me and my wife could move into a nicer appartment! Of course i wasnt free of any incidents, my commute is now a whooping 2 1/2 hours but if that wasnt enough our car broke down the other week! Well buckle up old bicycle its time for you and me again. Being optimistic is the only thing i can be when the universe is spitting in my face haha.. At least with my wife everything is allright, the subject of childen came up.. im not opposed to children but it was hard seeing her crying face becasue we just couldnt support kids.. maybe some day but certainly not now..

Hey there again! Damn Covid really struck us hard! I got it right from my wife and if that wasnt enough it was right on my birthday. The cake she made was delicious!!... or thats what i told her.. i couldnt taste much of anything really.. man i really looked forward to that cake. It really has to come in pairs..  But there is always another year right?! At least my job is one that isnt threatened by covid so there is that. And working from home is nice too! I can spend so much more time with my wife, we hadnt so much intimacy since our wedding haha! Oop there she calling, see you next time!

Happy new year!! Are you all still here :) ? I hope you all had nice suprises like me.. we uhm... seem to be expecting. I knew i should have used proper protection but at least my wife is over the moon haha.. its gonna be hard to juggle a child along with a pay cut from my work but.. we will see how its gonna work out! Im confident we gonna make it. You know what i refuse to see the pregnancy as bad luck so its only one this time >:). 

  
Update: Its twins.... there is the pair.. haha..

Hello hello did you miss me and my misfortune :)? Seems like i said the pairs line so often my wife started to use it as well. But in a nice way regarding out twins! Looking for baby clothes and seeing a nice pair she always looks at me with beaming eyes telling me "Look it always comes in pairs." Its a nice change of mood. Her belly is starting to show and i am actually quite thrilled now too. I think we can make this family work.. together!.

Sad news today folks. We were at the doctors and the twins dont seem to be healthy.. the doctor told us even if we would bring them to term they would be stillbirths. My wife and i was devastated. We chose to terminate the pregnancy for my wifes health but the doctor said my wife probably wont be able to have another child. What she said next chilled my blood. "It always comes in pairs huh?" Is my misfortune contagious? Was it my fault that they died? :( Me and my wife are on a really rough patch right now but i try to be optimistic.. for her sake at least. Im sure one day things will get brighter for us.

Is anybody even here to listen? Or did i just talk to myself. Does it even make a difference, probably not. My wife wasnt in the best state of minds in the past couple of months. She rarely talked to me nor did she eat properly. I was trying my hardest against the odds yet the universe showed no mercy on me haha.... I was having a harder time to cope for the loss of our children than i thought. Absentmindedly i made a big mistake at work which resulted in damages in the millions. I pretty much got fired on the spot today. I tried driving carefully home so nothing more unnecessary happens. I just wanted to go home to my wife. Im at home now and i am on my wits end. I was optimistic my whole life hoping that my misfortune wouldnt control my life yet i am now unable to look up anymore.. the sight of my wife hanging from the ceiling is just too much for me.. it always comes in pairs... it always has to come in pairs..  
Well now nothing bad can happen anymore.. i dont have anything left to lose.
