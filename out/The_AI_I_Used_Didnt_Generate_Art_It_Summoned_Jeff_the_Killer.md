I should’ve known better than to play around with things I didn’t understand.
But when everyone online was messing with those new AI art generators, I figured I’d join in. At first, it was harmless—fun, even. I was never good at drawing, but here I was, typing a few words into a box and watching eerie, detailed images appear in seconds. Monsters, haunted houses, surreal dreamscapes… the AI gave me what I wanted, and more.

I’d stay up late at night, just experimenting. Prompts like: “a monster crawling from a mirror, photorealistic, horror” or “smiling ghost in a dark alley”. The results were fascinating. Sometimes unsettling, sometimes goofy. I laughed at most of them, even shared a few with my friends.

But then… something changed.

It started when I typed a simple prompt: “creepy face in the dark”. The AI spat out an image almost instantly—faster than usual. I thought maybe the servers were running better that night. But when I saw the picture, my stomach dropped.

The face was pale. Skin stretched, almost waxy. Eyes rimmed in black, like the eyelids had been burned away. And the smile… too wide, carved like a wound. I didn’t even have to think. My brain whispered the name before I realized it:

Jeff the Killer.

At first, I laughed nervously. Jeff the Killer was just one of those old internet urban legends—something that circulated when I was a kid. Grainy photos, badly written creepypastas. It wasn’t real.

Still… the AI had nailed it. I hadn’t typed anything close to “Jeff the Killer.” Just creepy face in the dark.

I shrugged it off and typed another prompt: “forest at night, shadowy figure.”
The image processed. And there he was again. Same pale skin, same grin. This time he was half-hidden behind the trees.

Okay, weird coincidence. Algorithms sometimes “latch” onto styles. Maybe someone had trained this model on old creepypasta memes, and Jeff’s face got baked in. I could explain it.

Except… the more I tried, the less sense it made.

No matter what I typed—“abandoned hospital,” “smiling clown,” “old man reading a book”—Jeff’s face showed up somewhere in the image. Sometimes faint, like he was lurking in the shadows. Sometimes front and center, staring directly at me.

By the fifth image, I noticed something else. A thin line of text burned into the bottom corner. Not the AI watermark. Just one word:

Jeff.

At first, I thought maybe I’d accidentally typed it as a prompt. I checked. My last input was “cozy fireplace scene, digital art.” Nothing about Jeff. Yet there he was, crouched in the corner of the fireplace, teeth shining.

I tried again. “Cute kitten, watercolor.”
The AI gave me the kitten. But behind it, blurry but unmistakable, was the smile. And at the bottom, that same word:

Jeff.

I remember pushing my chair back so hard it squealed against the floor. My heart was pounding. This wasn’t funny anymore.

I closed the program, shut off my laptop, and went to bed.

The next morning, I tried to forget about it. Maybe it was just a glitch. Maybe someone had slipped a “Jeff filter” into the model as a joke. AI tools are weird sometimes. I went about my day—classes, coffee, scrolling Reddit.

That night, though, curiosity got the better of me. I turned my laptop back on. Opened the AI app. My recent renders were still saved in my gallery. Sure enough, every single one of them had Jeff in it. His grin burned into pixels.

I hovered over the delete button, but something stopped me. Instead, I typed a new prompt. “Beautiful sunset over the ocean.”

For a moment, it worked. The AI gave me a glowing orange sky, waves reflecting the light. Peaceful.

Then, just as I exhaled in relief, I saw him.
In the corner of the beach. Tiny, but visible. A pale figure standing where the surf met the sand. Staring.

And there, bottom right: Jeff.

I slammed my laptop shut. My reflection in the dark screen startled me—I looked pale, sweaty, like I’d seen a ghost.

That night I dreamed of him. I was standing in a white void, endless and empty, except for Jeff’s face floating closer and closer. His grin didn’t move, but his voice whispered: “Go to sleep.”

I woke up gasping.

I told myself I’d stop using the AI. It wasn’t worth it. I uninstalled the program. Deleted my cache.

But the images… they didn’t go away.

A few days later, I was scrolling through my phone gallery. Among my regular photos—selfies, random memes, screenshots—I saw one that didn’t belong.

It was Jeff. His face, cropped close, grinning wide.
I swore out loud and almost dropped my phone.

I hadn’t downloaded that. I hadn’t taken it.

And yet, there it was. Timestamps matched the night I uninstalled the AI.

I tried deleting it, but the photo wouldn’t go away. I pressed delete again and again. My phone just buzzed, like it was rejecting the command. Finally, the screen went black, and when it came back on… there were three copies of the photo.

All slightly different. His smile wider in each one.

I didn’t sleep that night.

It only got worse.

Every time I opened my phone, more pictures appeared. Not just Jeff’s face anymore. Pictures of my room. My desk. My bed.

Angles I didn’t recognize. Like someone had been standing in the corner, snapping photos while I wasn’t looking.

And in every one, Jeff was there. In the background. In the doorway. In the reflection of the mirror.

Always closer.

The last straw was last night. I was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, too wired to sleep. My phone buzzed on the nightstand. Notification: “New AI render complete.”

I hadn’t reinstalled the app.

Hands shaking, I picked up the phone. Opened the image.

It was me.
Me, lying in my bed. Exactly as I was right now. The angle was from the doorway.

And in the darkness behind me, leaning over, was Jeff. His grin splitting my screen in half.

At the bottom, the caption burned into the pixels:

Go to sleep.


I’m writing this as fast as I can. I don’t know how he’s doing it. The AI, my phone, my camera roll—they’re not supposed to work like this.

But Jeff’s face is everywhere now. On my laptop. My phone. Even when I blink, I see him behind my eyelids.

And I swear… I just heard my front door creak open.

I don’t know how I’m still functioning. I haven’t properly slept since that night—the night the AI sent me an image of myself in bed, with Jeff standing over me.

I’ve barely eaten. My body feels like it’s running on fumes and adrenaline. Every sound makes me jump. The floor creaks, my fridge hums, a car passes outside—and I flinch, convinced it’s him.

But the scariest part? I’m not even sure what’s real anymore.

After I finished writing the first part of this (hoping that maybe sharing it would make me feel less alone), I checked my phone again.

The gallery was worse. Way worse.

It wasn’t just pictures of my room anymore. Now there were videos. Silent clips, maybe five seconds each. The shaky motion of someone walking, a camera angled at hip height. My hallway. My bathroom. The stairs creaking under invisible weight.

In every single video, Jeff appeared. Sometimes at the end of the hall. Sometimes in the bathroom mirror. Sometimes just passing across the frame, like he knew I was watching and wanted to tease me.

But the most horrifying clip wasn’t of my house. It was of me.

The angle was from inside my own closet. The door cracked just enough to see me sitting on my bed, hunched over, typing on my laptop. The video ended with my head jerking up, like I’d heard something.

I don’t remember hearing anything when that was filmed. I don’t remember ever being watched.

The timestamp said the video was created five minutes earlier.

That same night, I heard something. I’d shoved a chair under the doorknob, barricaded myself in my room like a scared kid. Around 3:12 AM, I heard soft scratching.

Not at the door.
At the window.

Three stories up.

I froze. My blinds were down, but I could hear it—nails dragging lightly against the glass, like someone was trying to trace letters. Then a pause. Then two slow knocks.

I didn’t move. Didn’t breathe. My phone was in my hand, but I was too terrified to shine the flashlight. I thought maybe if I stayed still long enough, he’d go away.

The scratching stopped.

I finally worked up the courage to peek through a sliver in the blinds.

Nothing. Just the night.

But when I pulled back, my phone buzzed. A new image notification.

It was a photo of me, taken from outside the window. My pale, terrified face staring through the blinds. And in the corner of the picture, a reflection on the glass—Jeff’s smile glowing against the black sky.

The caption, as always:
Go to sleep.

The next morning, I couldn’t take it anymore. I stuffed clothes in a backpack and drove to my friend Aaron’s place across town. I didn’t tell him the full story—just said I was having “weird stalker problems.” He let me crash on his couch without asking too many questions.

For a moment, I thought maybe I was safe. His apartment felt different, cleaner, warmer. No shadows lurking in corners. I started to believe maybe Jeff couldn’t follow me outside my house.

But then Aaron made breakfast, and I opened my phone to check the time.

The gallery had new photos.

Photos of Aaron. Standing at the stove. Pouring coffee. Smiling cluelessly at me.

In every single one, Jeff was behind him.

Watching.

I almost screamed. Instead, I slammed the phone face-down on the table. Aaron looked at me funny, asked if I was okay. I lied. Said I was fine.

I wasn’t fine.

Later that afternoon, while Aaron went out for groceries, I tried deleting the pictures again. Same result: the phone buzzed, resisted, then multiplied the images instead of erasing them. By the time I stopped, there were dozens. Hundreds. Jeff in every one. His grin sharp enough to cut glass.

I realized then: he wasn’t tied to my house. He was tied to me.

That night at Aaron’s, I was half-asleep on the couch when my phone buzzed again. Another “AI render.” I hadn’t touched the app in days. I didn’t even think it was installed anymore.

This time, the image wasn’t a picture. It was text. Black background. White letters, crudely formed, like handwriting.

> “I can see you.”



I nearly dropped the phone.

Another notification. Another text-render.

> “Why are you hiding?”



My fingers trembled as I typed a response in the prompt box, just to see if it would work.
I wrote: “What do you want?”

The screen froze for a moment. Then the reply came back:

> “To tuck you in.”



I shut the phone off and threw it across the room.

But when I picked it up in the morning, the screen was still lit. The words hadn’t gone away.

Here’s the worst part.

The photos aren’t just of my house or Aaron’s anymore. They’re of places I haven’t even been yet.

This morning I scrolled through and found a picture of a laundromat. Empty, except for Jeff leaning against a dryer. Another of a bus stop across town. Another of my old high school classroom.

In each one, Jeff is closer. Sometimes smiling at me. Sometimes smiling at whoever else is there.

It’s like he’s mapping the places I might go, preparing them for me.

Like he’s waiting.

Aaron didn’t last long. By the third night, he kicked me out. Couldn’t deal with me jumping at every sound, locking every door twice, muttering to myself about Jeff. He said I needed therapy. Said I was freaking him out.

I didn’t argue. I just left.

Back at my place, I locked every window and door. I shoved furniture against the walls. I even unplugged my Wi-Fi, as if that could somehow cut off Jeff’s connection.

It didn’t.

At 4:03 AM, I woke up to the sound of my closet door creaking open.

I froze in bed. My barricaded bedroom door was still shut. Nothing else should’ve been able to move. But the closet—my closet—was yawning wider, inch by inch.

I couldn’t see inside. Only darkness.

My phone buzzed on the nightstand.

With trembling fingers, I grabbed it and unlocked the screen. A new image glowed back at me.

It was my room. A photo from inside the closet. Taken from the shadows.

I saw myself, wide-eyed, clutching my phone under the covers.

And behind me—just inches away in the photo—Jeff’s smile.

I can’t explain what’s happening. This isn’t a glitch, isn’t a virus, isn’t some ARG. Jeff is real. He’s bleeding through the screen, crawling out of the pixels and into my life. But I Don’t Think He’s Digital Anymore

I haven’t told anyone else. Who would believe me? “An AI is haunted by Jeff the Killer”? They’d laugh me off the internet.

But I’m not laughing.

Because just now, while writing this, I noticed something out of the corner of my eye.

The mirror across the room.

There’s movement in it. A pale shape, standing where I’m sitting, grinning as I type.

I don’t dare look up.

But the reflection is smiling wider.
