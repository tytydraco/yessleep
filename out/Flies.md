FLIES

I’ve always hated flies. That droning, high pitched buzz when they hover near your ear sets my teeth on edge. The way they rub their tiny, shit covered hands together when they land on something is revolting enough to make bile rise in the back of my throat, sour and nauseating. 

Maybe I was too young the first time I watched The Fly. Images of flesh falling away, replaced by enlarged, grotesque, insect features haunted my nightmares for years. I could have happily lived a long, full life without knowing that these disgusting creatures vomit acid onto their food to begin digesting it before they even take a bite. 
My therapist scolded me more than once for blaming a movie. What did he call it? Displacement, I think. He said that a movie didn’t cause my obsessive-compulsive disorder, it didn’t create the inescapable intrusive thoughts that echo inside my head without end. Maybe he’s right. But I’m also not sure it matters anymore whether hatred for tiny, buzzing, shit eating insects is justified or nothing more than a symptom of a disorder that someone in a white coat with shelves full of thick textbooks decided I have. 

The itching, that’s all that matters now. Itching, itching, itching. Tiny, hairy, shit covered feet touching my skin and there’s no way to get them off. I wish I could scream. I would give fucking anything to be able to thrash and shriek and bat these nasty beasts away, to crush them under my hands and feel the juice of their bodies squish out onto my palm so I would know, without question, that each one was dead. 

I’ve lost track of time, but I think it was barely more than a week ago when the first fly crawled out of my kitchen sink drain and buzz, buzz, buzzed around my face. I had snarled and swatted at it, cursed it to the depths of hell where it belonged, but the damned thing was unbothered by my rage and disgust, flying up out of reach and circling around the kitchen ceiling. I didn’t know it was an omen, a lowly messenger of the plague to come. If I had, I might have set my house on fire then and been done with it. 

By the time I got a fly swatter and a chair, it was nowhere to be found. It wasn’t until hours later, lying in the dark, tucked comfortably into my bed that I heard the buzzing again. 

Buzz.
Buzz.
Buzz.

Images of acidic bile disintegrating flesh and those disgusting little feet filled my mind instantly. The diseases they carry, the bacteria and the viruses and the fucking microbes. I wish I could fucking scream just thinking about it. I jumped out of bed and searched the house for the vile thing. Shouldn’t they sleep when it’s dark like birds do? Shouldn’t they follow the basic laws of nature? 

When I couldn’t find the fly, the only logical thing to do was to deal with the aftermath. There was no telling what it had landed on, walked across, laid eggs on, so I disinfected everything. I scrubbed and cleaned and disinfected until my eyelids were heavy, my fingers were raw and burned with cleaning chemicals, and the sky outside was starting to turn the pinkish gray of dawn. 

My house was clean, but the fly was still here. 

Buzz.
Buzz.
Buzz.

One fly, ten flies, hundreds of flies, all buzzing at once. The hum is enough to drive anyone insane. And their feet. Those tiny fucking disease carrying feet. 

I wish I could scream.

Have you ever felt a fly walk across your eyeball? Right across your fucking eyeball? 

I wish I could blink. 

One fly in my kitchen sounds like heaven now, like goddamn nirvana compared to this. But when I left my house that morning, moving like a zombie without any sleep, all I could think about was that one, single, fly. I spent my workday imagining what it might be touching, walking across, laying eggs on. I imagined it leaving invisible agents of disease in places that would be impossible to clean. My toothbrush, any food in my kitchen left unsealed, even the television remote control… they all had to go. The second I got home, I would get rid of them all, and I would find the fly and kill it.

And I did. I threw it all out, and then some. Anything I could possibly imagine that nasty, vile creature had touched. And I found it, and I killed it, and I still heard the buzzing. 

Buzz.
Buzz.
Buzz. 

I did scream then. A primal, frustrated scream that came from the pits of my soul and echoed off the bare, white walls. It was cathartic for a moment, and then it felt useless. 

I spent another night cleaning and looking for the fly. The other fly. There was at least one more. Maybe more than one. Were they breeding already? 

Buzz.
Buzz.
Buzz.

I couldn’t sleep. Of course I couldn’t. If I even tried to close my eyes, I swore I could feel them walking across my face, across my lips, my eyelids, crawling inside my nose to lay their eggs. There had to be more than one. 
No, I would sleep when my house was my own again. That’s what I told myself then, at least. Now I know it never will be again. 

Two flies sounds like heaven now. Pure nirvana. I would give anything for only two flies.
The tickling and the buzzing was the worst… until now. But the writhing, the wiggling, the crawling underneath my skin, I know what it is, and I would give anything now for only flies. Acid digesting my flesh, the feeling of their little hands picking at the rotting bits of my skin is rapture compared to the way the maggots separate it from my bones and muscles, burrowing deeper inside me, devouring ravenously. 

It was two days then. Two days without sleep, and at least two more flies somewhere in my house, somewhere I couldn’t see. I called in sick to work and stalked through my home, pulling curtains back quickly, hoping to catch the intruders unaware. 

Buzz.
Buzz.
Buzz.

They were clever though. I never thought of flies as clever, but these were. Buzzing near my ears but somehow managing to never be seen. I might even go as far as to call them devious. And that unsettled me more. 

Flies were bad enough when I knew that they were nothing more than mindless, disease ridden pests. But these flies seemed to have it out for me. They managed to avoid the fly strips I hung and the bug zappers I placed on the counter. They were even too smart for the trap I attempted to lay, leaving a cup of sugar water on the counter, hoping to lure them in. I spent an entire day and night hiding, disguised, waiting for them to take the bait. But, nothing. 

Clever, clever, clever. 

I couldn’t sleep. How could I? That’s exactly what they wanted. If I slept, they’d crawl inside my nose, inside my mouth, my ears, my eye sockets and lay eggs. Eggs that would hatch into writhing, wriggling, insatiable maggots that would devour me from the inside. 

These flies might have been smart, but I was smarter. I wasn’t going to fall for that. 
Maybe that was my undoing though. They didn’t seem to need sleep, but I did. I needed it, but I refused it. How could I sleep? 

Buzz.
Buzz.

Three days. Four Days. Five days. 

I couldn’t eat. Anything in my kitchen could be contaminated by now. There was no telling where they might have laid their eggs or what they might have walked on, touched, infected.

I felt infected. Unclean. Five days without sleep and I wasn’t as alert as I should be. What if I was dozing off without realizing it and giving them the chance to lay their eggs, to spread their disease, to vomit acid onto my skin so they could start to digest me? 

Showers weren’t enough.

I screamed at the way the Bleach scalded my skin, but what choice did I have? Big, hideous welts formed, and I realized my mistake again. I was only making myself more tempting to the flies. My scalded skin and open wounds would be the perfect place to lay their eggs, the ideal meal for the hatching maggots to feast on. 
I clawed at my flesh then, moaning and wailing at the pain that tore through me, like my nerve endings were on fire and my skin was peeling away from my bones. And after five days without sleep, without food, without any peace, I decided that all I wanted was for it to stop.

I never thought much about the afterlife before. I didn’t believe in heaven or hell, not really. I scoffed at the idea of reincarnation. I suppose I thought it would be nothing, and nothing sounded blissful. Nothing would be a beautiful, peaceful reprieve. 

The Bleach burned my mouth and my throat even worse than my skin. The vomit that came after hurt even worse. It felt like it was made of razorblades and fire, ripping my esophagus to shreds on the way down and the way back up again. It was a blur after that. Dizzying agony, regret, and then silent prayers for it to just be over. 

Lying on my kitchen floor, covered in my own foaming vomit, staring up at the ceiling unable to blink, unable to move or scream or cry, I started to fear I’d been wrong about the nothing. 
I was never aware of my own heartbeat until I felt it stop, leaving my chest hollow and silent. My lungs didn’t burn for air anymore and my eyes didn’t feel dry. I waited for my consciousness to fade too, waited for my brain to power down the same way my body had and for the darkness to claim me. I waited for the nothing, but it never came. 

Instead, what came was more flies. 
I could see these flies, unlike the sneaky, clever ones. They buzzed around me, brazenly in front of my unblinking eyes. I tried to lift my hands to swat them away, but I couldn’t. They landed on my face and started to tickle my skin with their diseased feet. I tried to open my mouth to scream, but I couldn’t. 

The smell of rot started yesterday and the flies multiplied. I didn’t know it would hurt this much to feel myself rot, to feel the fat inside my body curdling like spoiled milk and my flesh dying even faster than the flies can devour it. 

But still, it’s the maggots that I hate the most. Gnawing at my intestines, my organs, eating the clotted blood pooling inside my abdomen, and slowly turning into flies too. The buzzing only gets louder now as maggots sprout wings and crawl out of my nose, out of my mouth, out of my empty eye sockets. At least I can’t see them anymore, not with my eyeballs chewed away and consumed. 

Maybe once they devour my brain, I’ll finally get the nothing I was hoping for. 

That’s all I pray for now, but they don’t seem to be in any hurry.
