lf l try and numb myself a bit first l can still remeber it, 

The last moment of full peace of mind l think l'll ever have.

l was singing disney songs at the time. Smiling and driving as me and the 3 prettiest girls in the world made our way down the montain. lt was me, my girlfriend at the time (Kim) and the twins (Jennie and Emily both 6) singing "let it go" off time to the CD as my truck bounced in and out of pot holes on a road the state stopped giving a shit about a decade ago. We were going to a camp whose name l wont devulge for legal reasons. The camp was (is) a somewhat run down venue. lt was built around a man made lake that had been given to the state and turned into a park back in the 50s. Then a few decades later most of the land was sold to some private investors. A few decades after that it got turned into a "resort" and then a casino. The "camp" was little more then an after thought by the time me and my girls were going last summer but since the state still owns part of the land as a nature reserve the casino (sorta) keeps the camp open on the far side of the lake, l think in part due to some agreement with the state about rangers road access or something.

Anyway "let it go" was finally coming to an end and l was about to eject the disk when Emily yelled from the back seet "Let it play again Daddy!" (she always called me that when she wanted something). "Honey we're coming into a camp l'm gona have to talk to the ranger at the Windo-" "ONE MORE TlME! ONE MORE TlME! ONE MORE TlME!" the twins inturpted me together like the borg from star treck. l rolled my eyes looking over an their mother whose blue eyes smiled back at me in a way some guys go there entire lives without seeing.. "Fine" l said "but my cover this time: LeT iT GOoOoooOOoOOooOOOO! LET lT GOOOOO!" l shreaked in an exhausted tone illiciting a chorus of giggles from the back seat. "Jack!" Kim said in mock outrage. "CaNt HoLd lt BaCk anNnNy mOoOoOOoooooore!" l continued rolling up to the rangers station.

The building itself was somewhat emblematic of the camp i suppose. A dirty congrete block building with wooden roof moss clearly growing unchecked on its top. On its underside l could se the names of generatios of camp councilers scratched into the wood along with the standard penises and swastikas. Behind the glass windowns were piles of paper, a stained coffee mug, a half visable opened pizza box and a noticable lack of anyone siting at repurposed computer chair ploped behind the window; about half a head to small for anyone under 6'4 to sit in it and comfortably look out the glass to use the speaker.

Eventually someone did come though. A short female park ranger with a tight bun kept neatly under a broad hat who ignored the chair completely instead leaned toward the glass to click the speaker button. "Yes?" she said faking a smile with the same energy a Denny's waitress has around 3:00 AM. "Loop C site 16" l said. "Hold on one sec."

The loop was emty besides us when we first showed up, not a single other family along the slim circular road that looped around the bath house back to the main. When l was a kid such a thing would have been unheard of, especially for a holiday weekend, but less and less people were coming to the camp; less and less families especially. The Casino had started atracting a different element since it went up. College kids mainly. They came, they drank, they got in fights. And those college kids were (for the most part) back home for the summer, going to way nicer beaches then can be found in buble-fuck West Virginia.

Anyway l was glad for us having the loop to ourselves when we got there.

At least for as long as we did.
