To whoever finds this, my name is Matteo and I'm currently somewhere that doesn't exist. I have tried every GPS app out there, checked out maps, even went online to see if anyone else has experienced what I am currently going through, but it seems like I still can't find a way out of this place.

It all just started as a normal drive, I was on my way back from work when my gps gave me a notification:

"A faster route is available. Would you like to take it?"

Not thinking much of it, I tapped Yes and kept my music going — Grateful Dead, for the curious. Sure, it was a little weird to see a new shortcut on a commute I’ve driven for years, but I figured maybe they’d opened a new road or done some construction. As I kept driving, things started making less sense. It's a hard feeling to describe but it was almost as if someone who did not know anything about road signs just went crazy along the side of the road with them.

"Limit Speed: MPH 65"

"In Exit 2526 miles"

"North East South West"

I was obviously thinking these were fake, maybe some prank pulled by local teenagers or something. As I drove past them I remember just how real they looked though, the same kind of metal stakes and sign material a real sign is made of. That wasn’t all though, the trees and the plants don’t make much sense here either and it hurts to look at them too long… I just try to keep my eyes on the road.

Driving for this long has surprisingly not taken a lot of gas from my car, although it has gone down a bit since I first got on it. My odometer currently spins all the numbers non stop but otherwise my car seems fine, even driving through the soft parts of the road with little trouble. The road gets soft sometimes among other things, but in the time I've spent here I have learned to not ask how this place works and just try to focus on getting the hell out of here. It doesn't really feel like I’m in any danger but I know that this isn’t right either, almost like I’m doing a bad thing just by existing in this place.

I’ve changed too. I haven’t felt hunger and thirst even though I’m sure I’ve been here for days now. I blink less, sometimes going minutes in between until I realize I haven’t blinked and I force myself too.

I think this is day four and while driving I came across a gas station, or at least the idea of one. This place looks like a regular gas station sure but it's just the surface of it, it feels like plastic to the touch, with a slight discoloration to it. I tried to open the door but it wasn’t a door, not really. Coming closer to the door I realized it was actually a wall, not something with a tangible handle I could grab. I tried looking into the windows too but I was not able to see through the glass, although I could see my reflection in the mirror. It is a strange feeling to watch your reflection start copying you but then stop halfway, stuck in whatever position it happened to freeze on… I’m not going to dwell on that right now. Whatever the hell this place is though, it’s the closest thing I currently have to a feeling of normalcy here. I think I’m writing this just to stay sane. If someone finds this phone, at least they’ll know what happened. My phone keeps syncing the wrong time now too — I’ll blink and it jumps forward hours, and I stopped trying to understand it. The sky doesn’t move though, it's that same dull grey blue it has been since I took that turn onto this road.

As I sat there in my car, contemplating whether to start driving at that moment or rest a little longer, I saw it. Out of the corner of my eye I saw… a hand. There were dozens of them pressed against the inside of the gas station, stretching against the walls which unmistakably began to crack under the internal pressure.

Wasting no time I stomped on the gas pedal and heard my engine roar to light — however I also heard the bursting of the wall behind me. Looking in my rear view mirror I panicked as I saw the wave of hands flooding towards my car, clawing over one another in such a chaotic frenzy it hurt to look at.

In the rearview mirror, the hands weren’t slowing—they were multiplying, dragging themselves across the asphalt like a tide. I drove until my arms ached, until the sky blurred into the same color as the road. The hands never caught me—but I don’t think they stopped either, if I stay still too long I can see a mass start to form in the reflection of my car mirrors. Just when I thought all hope was lost the GPS just spoke again:

“A faster route is available. Would you like to take it?”
