I woke up with an aching head. My eyes slowly opened as I looked around, dizzy and confused. I was in some dark room, what looked to be a basement, the only source of light being a small candle in the corner.

As I slowly regained consciousness, my memories started coming back. My name is Chris, and I went to bed in my house like normal last night, yet somehow, I woke up here.

I noticed there were two other people sitting in the middle of the room. A young girl with blonde hair, and a dark skinned boy who looked about my age. “Where am I?” I asked. The boy crawled over to me. “You’re awake! What’s your name?” He asked excitedly as the girl also approached me. “I’m Edgar, and this is Laura.”

“M-My name is Chris… Where are we?” I asked. Edgar spoke up. “We woke up here just like you. We’re just as confused as you are.” I nodded, secretly panicking in my mind.

Suddenly, the door at the top of the staircase swung open. My heart skipped a beat and I backed against the wall. A man slowly walked down the stairs, wearing a red buttoned shirt, blue jeans, and a paper bag on his head with eyeholes cut out. He approached us and muttered in a deep, unsettling voice, “Good morning, children… hehehehe…”

He laid out three bowls on the floor, filled with some disgusting looking red substance. “Eat up…” he said quietly before walking back up the stairs and slamming the door shut.

We were all speechless for a minute as my mind started putting together the pieces. That creepy guy with the bag on his head must’ve kidnapped us and trapped us down here. Laura started crying, and Edgar placed his hand on her shoulder.

We inspected whatever was in the bowls in front of us. It was putrid. It was like meat jello. However, we ate it, simply because we were so hungry. I felt like I had to throw up afterwards. 

“Okay, listen. We all probably wanna get the hell out of here, right? If we’re gonna do that, we gotta stay calm.” Said Edgar.

I nodded, a tear running down my cheek. “O-Okay…” I whined. We were all clearly terrified and all had the same goal: escape.

Edgar got up and slowly ascended the stairs. The door, for some reason, was unlocked. Laura and I followed closely behind him, and saw what looked like a kitchen. The man with the bag on his head was cutting meat with a bloody meat cleaver.

We turned around and sat back down to discuss a plan. “He must be a butcher or something…” Laura whimpered, on the verge of tears. “Did you see that open door next to the fridge?” Edgar and I nodded. “Let’s try to sneak past and into that door.” Edgar suggested.

Laura suddenly burst into tears and collapsed into my lap. “I-I’m scared! What does he want? What if he hurts us?”

“Stay calm…” I said softly, trying to comfort her. I was impressed that Edgar was the only one not losing his shit. He wasn’t crying, and he looked deep in thought. Laura and I eventually stopped crying, and Edgar led us back up the stairs.

The butcher was still focused on chopping meat, and we all managed to sneak past into the open door behind him. We found ourselves in a big, open hallway. “Now what?” I said a little too loudly.

The chopping sounds suddenly stopped. I heard footsteps approaching. In a state of panic, all three of us rushed to hide under a table, and tried not to make any noise. The butcher walked out of the kitchen, and down the hallway, right past us. We all got out from under the table and turned around the corner.

Laura started tearing up again. “He almost saw us!” I was also freaked out, but trying my best to hold in the tears. Edgar signaled for us to follow him. “This way!” He said, as if he knew where he was going.

We tried opening a few doors, and eventually found one that wasn’t locked. I wasn’t ready for what I was about to see.

Edgar opened the door, and we all gasped in unison. The room had blood splattered all over the walls, and severed limbs everywhere. Legs, arms, hands, feet, and they were all human limbs, too. There was a saw bench in the center of the room, with a circular saw drenched in blood.

I dropped to my knees and started hyperventilating as I realized all the details. That meat he was cutting was HUMAN meat! We were in the house of a psychotic human butcher! Even Edgar looked shocked as he stared at all the bloody severed limbs and remains. Suddenly, I heard a deep voice from behind us that nearly gave me a heart attack.

“Now, where do you think you’re going?”

I quickly turned around to see the butcher with the bag on his head. Without thinking, I dropped down and ran past him, screaming. Laura and Edgar followed as the butcher chased us and yelled, “GET BACK HERE, YA LITTLE FUCKERS!!!”

We all made it back to the kitchen and split up. I quickly dove under another table that was there, and the butcher ran past me, chasing Edgar and Laura up a staircase. I was bawling my eyes out as I heard a bunch of noise from upstairs.

I then noticed, on the other side of the room, was a telephone. I immediately rushed to it, picked it up, and dialed 911. This was my chance. “Hello, Police?” I said, while crying intensely. “There’s a crazy butcher trying to kill us! He has a meat cleaver and a paper bag on his head! I don’t know where we are, just please, PLEASE send help!”

“Woah, calm down. Do you have anything to defend yourself with?”

“No! I’m currently hiding under a table, and two other people are hiding upstairs! He’s looking for us! Please help!”

“Okay, we’re sending people to your location right now. Just stay in your hiding spot and we’ll be there as soon as we can. Stay calm.”

“Okay, thank you! Thank you so much!” I ran back under the table, leaving the phone hanging from the wire. I still heard footsteps upstairs, and I said a quick prayer in my head that Edgar and Laura would be alright.

I waited there for what seemed like forever. Eventually, the front door was busted open and a few cops walked in, with guns. “Oh, thank God!” I said as I slowly rose up from under the table with my hands raised. “Officers! The killer is upstairs! And so are my friends!”

“Got it. Just stay there.” Said one of the officers as they went upstairs. I crawled back under the table and curled up in a ball. I then heard a loud scream, followed by a few gunshots. “You can come out now! The threat is down!”

I walked upstairs to see the butcher with a few bullet wounds in his chest, lying on the floor in a puddle of blood. Laura and Edgar were standing there, looking shocked. I ran towards them and hugged them tightly in my arms. “We’re alive! WE’RE ALIVE!!!”

I then noticed that Edgar’s left arm was missing. It must have been cut off, because it was bleeding, dripping blood on the floor. The cops tried to stop the bleeding by wrapping bandages around it. I heard an ambulance in the distance, and we were taken in to be questioned and treated.

Edgar, Laura and I are now good friends. We occasionally hang out and play games together. We’re all traumatized from the whole experience, but we’re doing well now. I still don’t know how I got in that house to begin with, but I don’t care. I’m just grateful to be alive.

But there is one thing I didn’t realize until a while after we were rescued. That meaty substance we ate from those bowls… was most likely human flesh.
