I don’t think I’ll ever be able to get that smell out of my nose. That strange, sickly sweet, earthy smell, the kind that only emanates from mounds of dead leaves. A few days, more accurately nights, ago I went on a little solo mission. I've been going on those more and more lately. Ever since my friend first got me into prying open doors to long forgotten places and rooting around their insides, I haven’t been able to satisfy my curiosity any other way. 

Anyway, he told me about that house. It's maybe a twenty minute walk through the woods by the edge of our town. Told me that it had this eerie air about it. That the night was heavier around it. Like it was poking and prodding around, like it was looking for something. As if a house could do that. He sputtered something about abysses looking into you when you look into them, but he always gets like that when he smokes too much.

I couldn’t get that story out of my head, though. I could barely sleep that night. I wanted to go see it. Out in the woods, I needed to see it for myself. I just had to go in, like some coroner discerning the cause of death, I needed to see every inch of it.

The next night I went out into the woods, the cool Autumn breeze carried a slight, sickly sweet scent of decay. Leaves crunched softly beneath my feet and crickets chirped in chorus. I always loved these woods, one of the first places we explored was out here. Now that I think about it, the house looked like it was around the same size as that spot.

By the time I found the house, rain drummed the forest floor. The smell of damp earth consumed that small clearing where it stood. Where that house loomed, quietly. I didn’t know what my friend was rambling about. It seemed like a relatively ordinary run-down, abandoned house in the woods.

My hair stood on end as I entered the clearing, the urge to see the house’s insides growing with each step. Moss clung to its walls in patches. The door’s paint was chipped and faded. It creaked softly as I opened it and my friend’s words rang in my head: “When you stare into an abyss, it stares back.”

It was pitch black. A deep, hollow darkness. Turning on the flashlight from my phone revealed dusty wooden floors, and a flight of stairs that extended outside my meager light’s reach. Stepping inside, the floorboards creaked beneath my feet. That creak illuminated the absence of the sounds that regularly accompanied my expeditions into the woods: the crickets’ song, the rustling of the leaves left on the trees in the breeze. The gentle pitter-patter of rain was the only familiar noise left.

A set of stairs stood in front of me, practically begging me to climb them. The old varnished wood was caked with dust, its dull gloss scantly visible with the light I provided. Whatever lay past them hadn’t been seen in a while, to put it lightly. I had to see what was up there.

With each step I took the stairs groaned. At the top, I was met with a hallway. What looked like a doorway just at the edge of my light beckoned me down it. Each step I took produced a low groan from the tired old wood beneath my feet. The door to the room groaned similarly as I opened it.

That room wasn’t dark. Not like the rest of the house. Moonlight crept in through a window on the wall opposite of the door, seeping past almost translucent curtains that clung loosely onto it. A bare mattress lay in the corner of the otherwise barren room. 

Something about that light was off. It had a slight yellow tinge, like it belonged to a moon that wasn’t ours. I crept closer to the window and this time the boards beneath me stayed silent. There was something there. Outside the window, standing at the edge of the clearing. Something staring back at the window, at me.

I jolted back, almost stumbling back into the hallway. What the hell was that? Its faint silhouette was too tall to be my friend, the only other person that I knew that was out in these woods as much as me. In fact, it was taller than anyone I knew at all. I needed to look out the window again. Surely my eyes were playing tricks on me, it was still pretty dark outside the house.

They weren’t. Two beady specks of the same silvery-yellow light stood at the edge of the clearing. Staring at the door I had left open. That otherworldly light was pouring into the clearing now, glinting off of the soft rainfall, dancing upon the dew on the grass. I must’ve blinked or something, because those beady specks of light weren’t at the tree line anymore. And that door, the entrance to this house, was closed.

As I turned away from that window, back toward the darkness of the hall, I heard the familiar creaking of the stairs. Quickly shutting the flashlight of my phone off, I ducked into the hallway and pressed myself up against the wall behind the open door.

The creaking turned to groaning and made its way down the hall. My heart slammed against my ribcage, almost as eager as I was to leave. When the sound reached the doorway, the smell of dead leaves wafted over me: sickly sweet and damp, the smell of decay. Soundlessly, the door shut next to me. The only thing on the other side: unending, encroaching, malevolent, darkness.

For a moment, I stood there, terrified of what might happen if whatever was on the other side of this wall found me. Then I fled. Down the hall, hoping that the dry-rotted wood beneath my feet wouldn’t give way. By the time I reached the staircase my lungs were on fire, and I heard a loud slam that must’ve broken the door to that eerie room. Then the creaking. That god awful creaking. Whatever it was, it was coming after me now.

I almost fell down the stairs while I went down them. That sickly sweet stench almost clogged my lungs right before I was out the door. The now soggy leaves didn’t crunch under my feet as I sprinted through the clearing, then between the trees. I ran until I couldn’t feel my legs anymore, and then I kept running. All the while the cold night air bit my cheeks, the soft rustling of leaves just behind me. Begging me to let up, for even a second.

Eventually I could see the edge of the woods. I’ve never been so happy that my house was so far from the middle of town. It was just a few hundred more feet now, and I would be there. Away from that stench, from the groaning floorboards, from whatever found me in that dreadful house.

I slammed the backdoor behind me and fell to the floor, my legs unable to support me any longer. My head reflexively leaned back against the door while I caught my breath. I looked straight up. Straight into the window of my backdoor.

It was there. That pair of beady silver-yellow specks stared down at me from hollow sockets. I quickly locked the door and stumbled to my feet, looking out the window again. It was gone. But that silvery light caught my eye. That yellow-tinged, spectral, silvery light.

My gaze shifted to the window on the back of my house. The window that looked across a short clearing and directly at the woods. The curtains were drawn. It stood there, in that sickly moonlight, just outside of the tree line. It was almost half as tall as the trees, and it looked like it was swaying in the breeze, just like them. I would’ve thought it was one of them if those beady, silvery, specks of light didn’t stare down at me through the window. It just stood there, watching, staring.

I quickly shut the curtains and went up to my room. That’s where I’m posting this from. Even though it’s been a couple days, I think it’s still out there. I can still smell it, that stench of decay. Whenever I leave my window open at night it drifts into my room: the sweet, earthy smell that could only ever belong to a pile of leaves. There’s a house in the woods, and I think I know whose it is now.
