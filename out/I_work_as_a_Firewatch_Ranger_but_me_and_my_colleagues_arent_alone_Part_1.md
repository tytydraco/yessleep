To start, my name is Arthur Coleman. I've worked as a ranger or a few years, and have gotten to know most of the volunteers or other rangers . 

This summer, I was attached to Tower 3, for reference there are an approximate of 12 towers across the forest. I arrived at my Tower at around 5pm to relieve the ranger, yet they were missing. I shrugged it off and grabbed the radio. "Tower 3 online" I said into it, almost instantly there was a response. "Tower 8 copies Tower 3". It wasn't weird for responses to be instant, we rarely used the radios. A few more towers acknowledged me but I began unpacking.

A few hours passed, yet my radio began going off. " Tower 5 to Tower 3, do you copy?" The sound of the radio scared me at first, but I grabbed it and responded "Tower 3 here, you okay?". From what I knew, Tower 5 was a man named Daniel Whittaker. I've worked with him for a little bit the past year or so however we rarely speak, and so this was a surprise. "Tower 3 move to Channel 18 please." I changed channels and acknowledged I was here, almost instantly he responded with "You're Arthur right? We've worked together a few times but I haven't really heard from you alot." I wondered if he wanted to be a friend or something, the towers can get lonely so I was excited to make a new friend. "Yeah I'm Arthur,  if I remember correctly you're Daniel. Not sure about the other towers". 

His responses were small, so I don't exactly remember them, but one thing did scare me. " Arthur, did you ever hear from the other ranger in your tower? a few nights ago he told me he thought someone was tailing him but he never described them. Thought he was fucking around but I never heard from him this morning." This part scared me, but I replied with "Uhhhh, I did see a pickup in the parking lot but I didn't see any driver. That might be the ranger, you think he's lost?" I don't recall anything else, but I remember switching channels around 11pm and logging off. "Tower 3 finishing up, goodnight other towers." I set my alarm for 6:45am and went to sleep. 

I remember having a nightmare, it was arkund 3am and I was in the tower when someone was banging on it. I remember in the dream, I turned around and there was a man, sitting there, he had no eyes or mouth, kind of like Slenderman if some of you are old enough to remember that. He didn't have a suit or anything, instead he was covered in fur but it was worrying. I woke up and it was 5:40pm.. 

I sighed, grabbing my radio "Tower 3 online, clock broke sorry." I knew this excuse was bad but what else could I say? I had a nightmare and couldn't wake up? Anywho, Tower 5 responded with something along the lines of "Goodmorning sunshine, you get enough rest?" in an obviously sarcastic manner. He told me that only me, him and Tower 9 remain on as the rest of the towers were deemed useless as their sectors were fenced off for some sort of event thing I think.. 

Tower 9 was on the South of the park, Tower 5 was on the East and I was on the West. We all tried to look over eachothers sector when one of us was busy. Tower 9, a new girl named Destiny, radio'd in to me saying that she could see a few campers starting an illegal campfire, it wasn't in a designated spot and that area was dry around this season. 

"Tower 3 heading out" I said into the radio, and grabbed my ranger coat and backpack. The bike to the site was about an hour and a half, I heard Daniel and Destiny talking over the radio whilst I was hiking. We all exchanged numbers and made a groupchat on WhatsApp, considering that it was easier communication if our walkies died and we got along okay. None of us cared to use proper radio etiquette once we got to know each other, I don't remember why but it was so much easier to talk.

"I'm at the campfire, I don't see anyone but I did hear an Elk mating call earlier. I'm gonna leave a note 'nd put their fire out." I'd be lying if I said my nightmare didn't scare me out in these forests, but I told myself it was fake and continued on. The hike back was treacherous, it was dark and every shadow threw me off. That isn't what scared me though, the following radio call did. "Arthur can you follow protocol and open your tower shutters please?" Destinys radio'd in. I responded, telling her that they were open and I was still on the hike back. Daniel chimed in, "Is that not you on your balcony then Arthur?" I told them to knock it off and that these shadows were already scary. I half walked, half jogged, back to my tower. The shutters were indeed shut, and so I had to reopen them. 

The inside of my tower had nothing wrong with it, and so I just sat down at my desk and began doing my report, playing it off as the wind and Daniel trying to scare me. There was a knock at my door, and so I turned and opened the blinds, what I saw shocked me. There was a deer skull with a candle on the floor. I jumped back and locked the tower door, then grabbed my radio.

"Daniel, Destiny lock your fucking doors some psycho just left me a deer head." I know this seems like I'm over reacting, but when you're alone in these woods for awhile, any form of human interaction can be scary. They thought I was joking, and so I sent a photo to the WhatsApp group and to our supervisor. To my surprise, he messaged back almost instantly telling me to just lock my door and they'll send someone out in the morning.

I'm gonna head off now, I'll make a new entry in the morning.
