It is such a weird thing to state, but it's true and it has been driving me insane.

I'm a college student and living from part-time paycheck to part-time paycheck. Between working and studying, I barely have time to rest. You know, I might have a habit of partying in the weekends, but came you blame me? I don't want to miss out on anything, and although I may be sleep deprived, I'm living life to the fullest.

The thing is, a few weeks ago I'd just gotten home from a party. It was around 3AM, and I was not in my best state. I was trying to sleep off the mix of vodka tonics and coke when I thought I fell into one of my nonsensical dreams. I was so drunk I kept feeling the bed rocking with me, and that made me envision a boat and hear the water splashing across the wood, in rhythmic, but persistent waves. However, after a few minutes passed, I realized I wasn't dreaming. The rocking sensation had an explanation, but the splashing sound didn't.

The more I focused, the more I realized that the splashing resembled someone eating.

I opened my eyes and fixated on the ceiling. Yeah, it didn't really sound like splashing. I could make out the wet sound of chewing, and biting. I squinted. Was my window open?

I stood up carefully, trying not to make the room spin more than it already was, and approached the window, careful not to trip over a suitcase and some books I'd thrown on the floor. Moving my ear closer to the glass, I could hear it a bit better. I opened it, stuck my head outside, and looked down.

No one was there.

I don't know why it didn't occur to me to also look up. I just closed the window and went back to sleep.

Over the month, I kept hearing it outside my window, always late at night. I was sober most of the time, which meant I needed to rest properly, and the sound of loud, wet chewing stretched over my dreams and haunted me in my sleep. It began to annoy me more than it intrigued me, the same way that you get annoyed when a friend of yours chews with their mouth open, ignorant to anybody around them.  I talked to my neighbors, and no one seemed to know anything about that.

I figured some homeless people were hiding around, even though I didn't understand why the fuck they would eat outside my window at 2AM.

After a while, I began to feel so exasperated by this sound that I swore I could hear it in my room. It wasn't always there, but that didn't make its presence any more bearable. The only way I would tolerate it was if I was really high or really drunk, or both.

Such occasion came quickly and, one night, I barged into my room obnoxious and dizzy, finding shelter against the terrible storm of my own nervous system on the floor. I lay down on the carpet, face up, and so many sounds assaulted my mind, that I didn't even notice the sound of chewing. As I was drifting off to sleep, I shot up wide awake and turned to the side, suddenly aware of the risk of sleeping on your back and choking on your own puke.

I awoke around five hours later, dazed and confused, hungover and cursing the day I was born. My head spinning and my organs chasing each other through my body, I stood up, thinking that I could make it to the bathroom for a shower, but my legs gave in quickly and I threw myself onto the armchair, which was a bad choice. The room started twisting in all directions, the walls running away from me. I clung hopelessly to the cold leather of the chair, gripped its stiff arm and used it as an anchor as the walls continued their unnerving dance. *Don't throw up.* I kept thinking. *Don't throw up. Don't throw up, don't throw up, don't...*

I gripped the arm of the chair tighter. I bent inwards a bit, keeping my eyes tightly shut and praying that the spinning would stop any time now. Apart from my own sour smell, I could feel the smell of the old carpet and the dust hanging around. My bed was unmade, the sheets were thrown off, and clothes covered almost every surface. I was not the cleanest person, but I still felt embarrassed. I kept thinking of the girl I'd almost brought back to my room, and I felt glad I hadn't.

I finally lay my head on the leather and allowed myself to drift off to sleep, once again, hoping that I would wake up feeling better.

And I did.

Around 9PM, my eyes opened and fixated on the wall in front of me. The digital clock, the desk, the laptop lazily left on. My neck was stiff and hurt - I realized I'd fallen asleep in a weird position, twisted like a pretzel. It was a miracle I hadn't thrown up on myself. I carefully stood up, afraid to disturb the delicate balance of my poisoned body, and went to the bathroom. When I came back, I stared for a while at the empty, moonlight-kissed room.

Something didn't add up.

I know what you'll say, and I agree - any time I drink, I wake up anxious, with this sense of impending doom, I keep thinking that there is something that is just *wrong,* something I missed, that will eventually lead to my demise. I kept looking around, perplexed, not able to understand what was wrong, why I felt so thrown off by the familiar image of my dorm.

After a few moments, I shrugged it off and went on to grab some clean clothes and get in the shower. There, surrounded by steam and light, I felt invincible. I had survived yet another dive into five different types of alcohol, a billion strangers, someone's house and a 20 minute Uber ride. Life was good.

As I wiped my face with the towel, moments of the previous day replied in my mind. Coming home. Sleeping on the floor. Waking up. On the chair. Waking up again, neck twisted.

Something was wrong. I was suddenly unsure of the configuration of my own room. My heart started pounding in my chest all of a sudden, an anchor threatening to take my body down, to the depths of the floor, to the abyss of realization. I shook my head. No. A quick check, and then I would realize how crazy I was.

I got dressed and practically ran along the hallway. I swung the door open and remained frozen in the doorway.

My mind was not cooperating. I kept hitting a wall, like a stupid child trying to fit a wooden cube into a circular hole. At last, I turned around and absently knocked on my colleague's door. He let me hang out for a while and use his laptop to type this.

I need you to understand that I am not crazy, or a drunk, or a junkie. No matter how fucked up I was, I still remember resting my head on the arm of the chair, my cheek on the cold leather. I remember gripping it with my fingers in a desperate attempt to stabilize myself.

I also know that my chair has no arms. A few hours ago, before and after my shower, I'd stared straight at it and verified what I'd known for the past two years, when I lived there.

From my friend's room, I can't hear any chewing. I don't know what was in my room. Or what *is* in my room. What I slept against.
