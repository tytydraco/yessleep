Hello, my name is Harvey. I am here to tell the story of Stephen Wood, or mr. Wood. He was my mentor,  a brilliant inventor, whom invented something he shouldnt have. I helped him create it, I should be the one to warn the city of [redacted]. These computers arent very good. They censor things considered sensitive. But ill try to get the point across regardless.


On November 3rd, 1997, Stephen Edwards Wood was born. He was a brilliant man, showing high intelect at the age of 3, already forming understandable complete sentences. He graduated 5 years early, went to college, and got degrees in computer science along with robotics. 


One day, i was walking in the park when I noticed him looking at me. This was the first time I met him. He said he had friends whom were teachers at the school I went to, [redacted] university. He told them he was looking for an apprentice to help him and the teachers obliged by telling him about me. Ive always had high grades, but I wasnt sure how to respond to him. His tattered jeans, grease stained white shirt, beard that looked to be a foot long, and his bald head all made him look semi like a dwarf. Out of curiousity I agreed.



He let me eat dinner with him while he told me the information that I told you. He explained to me he wanted to make robots and he needed someone with a will to learn. We began building robotic endoskeletons but what he was doing seemed very odd. This prototype instead of a left hand, had a machete. Its circular head and bright red eyes made me uncomfortable. Well, he called the robot prototyp "r3drum". He said it stood for "Robotic decoder ramsacker utility machine". Weird name but I decided to go home for the night and go back in the morning. 




When I entered his house, he was ecstatic. There wasnt just one prototype now, there were 10 more so 11 in total. These ones way more advanced and hostile looking. He brought me into his "Research room" as he called it. I looked on his computers and I was still unable to find why he was making these things. He told me "Dont worry boyo, we gots some flash bangers and some ak 40 somethings". Seems he didnt know his weapons or grenades for that matter. But why did he mention having these? 




He was going to bed one night when he supposedly heard a noise according to him. He said he went to look and saw one of the prototypes out of the kitchen. Something was wrong. He sent me a text message telling me the robots werent acting correctly. I got on my laptop and looked at the software powering them. He was correct, something was indeed wrong. He face timed me, telling me to be safe and try to warn everyone in the city. He also told me the truth. These robots were meant to be for the millitary, "Operation: [Redacted]. They would take the place of real soldiers and would be able to easily annihlate enemies. But theyve malfunctioned and are now rogue.  



The last thing I saw on that call was his corpse. The robots destroyed the door and are now free. I am currently hiding in a closet in my hosue behind boxes, while typing this out on my laptop. I am scared. I dont know where my girlfriend is, or if shes even still alive. I feel terrible for what Ive done. I created these things. This is partly my fault. What should I do? To all whom this concerns, please forgive me. I will try to survive, but i believe the only safe place is out of town. Please tell me if you survive. If anyone needs any info of these things, reply on this  and if i am still alive, i will try to reply to you. 

Hector, signing off for now.
