I moved into the house two weeks ago, charmed by its rustic appeal and the sprawling woods behind it. Locals warned me about those woods, said they were haunted. I laughed it off. Ghost stories are for kids, and I wasn’t about to let superstitions ruin my love for hiking.

That evening, I decided to explore. My German Shepherd, Max, was antsy, his leash taut as he paced the living room. He was eager to run, so I grabbed a flashlight and headed out just as the sun dipped below the horizon.

The woods were eerily quiet. No birds, no rustling leaves—just the crunch of my boots on the trail and the occasional jingle of Max’s collar. About ten minutes in, I heard it.

“Max, come here!”

The voice stopped me in my tracks. It was my voice, unmistakable, echoing faintly ahead. But I hadn’t said a word.

Max growled, low and guttural, his hackles raised.

“Hello?” I called out, shining my flashlight into the trees.

“Hello?”

The response was immediate, but it wasn’t quite right. It was my voice, but distorted, hollow, like someone was playing it through a broken speaker.

My chest tightened. I tried to laugh it off, telling myself it was some kind of weird echo. But Max’s growls turned into frantic barking, and I couldn’t shake the prickling sensation creeping up my neck.

Then it spoke again.

“Help me!”

It was my voice, desperate and pleading, coming from deeper in the woods.

I froze. Every rational part of me screamed to turn back, to run, but the sound tugged at me. What if someone really needed help?

“Stay here,” I whispered to Max, but he tugged against his leash, whining like he understood what I was about to do.

I pushed forward. My flashlight’s beam shook as I swept it through the trees, following the sound.

The woods opened into a clearing, and that’s when I saw it.

It was me.

No, not me. It looked like me—same jacket, same jeans—but its movements were wrong, too rigid, like a puppet on strings. Its head jerked up, and its face split into a grin too wide to be human.

“Help me,” it said again.

The words came out flat, disconnected from the movement of its lips. My stomach churned, and Max barked like mad, the leash slipping from my grasp. He lunged at the thing, but it didn’t react.

Instead, it tilted its head, studying me.

“Who are you?” I croaked.

“Who are you?” it repeated in the same tone, but its voice was changing, warping into something guttural and inhuman.

The thing dropped to all fours with a sickening crack of its joints, and my blood turned to ice. It began to crawl toward me, its limbs too long and its eyes glinting in the faint light of my flashlight.

“Stay,” it rasped, its voice nothing like mine now. “Claire, stay.”

I bolted. I didn’t care where I was going, as long as it was away. Max raced ahead of me, barking furiously.

Branches whipped at my face, my lungs burned, but I didn’t stop until I burst out of the trees and onto my back porch. I slammed the door shut and locked it, collapsing against it as Max barked at the window.

My hands were shaking so badly I could barely hold the flashlight. I glanced outside, but the woods were still. Too still.

I didn’t sleep that night. Every creak of the house, every gust of wind made my heart race.

The next morning, I saw it.

A muddy handprint smeared across my bedroom window. It wasn’t mine—it was far too large, the fingers impossibly long.

And just as I was trying to convince myself it was a trick of the light, I heard it again.

“Claire... let me in.”

It was my voice.
