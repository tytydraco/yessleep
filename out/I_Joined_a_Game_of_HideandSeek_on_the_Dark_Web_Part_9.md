Looking back over my shoulder, I caught a glimpse of a tall, slim woman, clad in black khakis and heavy combat boots. The slamming of her heavy footfalls echoed through the sleepy quiet of the street as she hurtled towards us. Her face was hidden behind a cracked porcelain mask, expressionless, like some kind of antique doll, but I could feel her stare burning through it.

The roaring of the vans engine was almost drowned out by the squealing of tyres as the liberty masked driver rammed the van into gear. My nostrils burned, the stench of burning rubber filled the air as I forced myself further up the street.

It wasn’t supposed to happen [like this](https://www.reddit.com/user/DantesGhost92/comments/1egjxu1/i_joined_a_game_of_hideandseek_on_the_dark_web/). Panic was setting in fast. For all my foresight, all of my best-laid plans, I’d never expected it to fall apart so quickly. I’d never thought they’d be this organised. This relentless. All I could do now was glance around the street, my eyes darting wildly, pleading for a way out of this.

A searing pain shot through my leg, jolting its way up towards my hip as it threatened to give way beneath me. I stumbled, nearly tumbling over myself as I struggled to maintain my balance. Then, something grabbed my shoulder. A hand, pulling tightly. My blood turned to ice as I braced for the cracked mask to be inches from my face.

“C’mon, David, come on!”

Jenny’s voice was frantic, her terrified eyes wide. She dragged me back to my feet, pulling me along as she ran, staring back at the Organiser behind us.

All we could do was run. Run and hope that we were able to think of something in the next few minutes, some way out of this mess. It was only a matter of time before the slamming boots, which were getting louder by the second, finally caught up.

Blinding panic took hold as we tore down the street. My eyes darted around frantically, trying to find any other way out; it seemed like our only option. If we carried on running along the main path, then we were as good as caught; there was no way we’d be able to outrun them.

Echoing louder, the footsteps behind us seemed to edge closer with each passing second. Houses and shops on each side seemed to blur as we bolted by at breakneck speeds. My leg burned with the exertion, still not yet fully recovered. And that damn van, it was still coming. I could hear its engine screaming over the slamming footsteps.

Skidding around the corner at the end of the road, we burst onto another street. Slightly wider, it was just as grim as the one that we’d fled from. It was just as run down and innocuous, closed shops and dilapidated houses as far as I could see, occasionally separated by periodic alleyways. My heart sank as I took it in. There was nowhere to hide.

Two lanes of traffic whizzed by ahead, zooming past oblivious to our plight as they made their way towards the city. Panic clawed at me again. Maybe we could hijack one? Run into the road, stop one and pull out the driver? Drive away as fast as we could? Scolding myself for thinking it, I pushed the thought away. All that would result in was us getting captured by the police instead, or run down by the van.

Rustling to my right snapped my attention back, and I turned to see Jenny, panic etched into her face. Rummaging furiously, her arm was thrust deep into her backpack. Before I even had a chance to ask her what she was doing, she turned, hurling its contents violently behind her and over her shoulder.

Rope and wiping rags fell limply to the floor, landing with soft thumps. They were quickly drowned out, however, by the clattering of jerry cans and metallic clanging of the saw blades spinning across the asphalt. 

Haphazardly bouncing at odd angles, the blades spread off in every direction, some towards the masked woman, some towards the parked cars, and others into the road. Sunlight reflected off their edges as they rolled, glittering around the street like a deadly kaleidoscope.

Sounds of crunching metal and squealing brakes filled the street, reverberating off the buildings. The van driver slammed to a halt, narrowly avoiding the blades now dancing to a stop in the middle of the road. He’d only just avoided impaling his tyre on one. Slamming his fists into the wheel, he flung the door open before clambering out onto the road.

I was about to congratulate Jenny on a job well done, when my stomach dropped. Without breaking step, the masked woman weaved between the still rolling blades. She seemed to slip between them with the ease of a gymnast, unfazed and still catching up. Charging forward, we ran again, hearts pounding in our chests.

Another set of screeching tyres filled the air from further up the street. Snapping my attention to my right, a pit formed in my stomach. Bursting out of a side road was another van, silver this time. It shot through a red light, weaving between cars like it didn’t even see them. The skin of my scalp tightened, and my heart jumped into my throat as I caught a glimpse of yet another mask on the face of the driver. It looked like a face that was melting, as though it was made of wax.

From further back, the heavy footsteps were still ringing in my ears, the masked woman still only seconds away. My mouth went dry as I realised what they were trying to do. He was trying to cut us off. We were stuck in the middle, trapped.

A small row of cars backed up at an intersection was the only thing standing between us and the silver van. They would have stopped him in his tracks, but the driver had timed it well. Just as the light changed, they moved off again. In a second, there would be nothing stopping him from mounting the curb.

Without missing a beat, I grabbed the arm of Jenny’s coat.

“David, what are you-” 

Yanking her hard to the right and back, almost doubling back on ourselves, we sprinted into the road. The van’s brakes screamed as it overshot us by inches. We bolted behind it, sprinting towards the other side. 

Darting through the intersection, the blaring of car horns and angry yells of drivers met our ears. Stumbling as I dragged her, Jenny struggled to keep her balance after such an unexpected change in direction.

Thankfully, that little manoeuvre caught the masked woman by surprise, too. Her boots skidding hard off the paving slabs, she tried her best to stop her momentum. I almost breathed a sigh of relief before she righted herself. It was fast, too fast. In mere moments, she charged us again, weaving her way quickly between the mess of cars.

Reaching the other side, we ran as hard as we could along the street. We were putting distance between us and the silver van, which I could hear frantically trying to reverse and charge after us once again. The woman was another matter, though. Still close, she was on us again, but I’d bought us valuable seconds.

We needed to lose the van. People are slow, easier to hide from, but there’s no way we could outrun a van. All we needed to do was find somewhere, anywhere, that they couldn’t fit, then we could figure out what to do about the others.

Yet again, the shrieking of rubber on asphalt snapped my attention back to my surroundings. My heart dropped into my stomach as the black van finally rounded the corner, roaring up the street towards us. I’d been wondering how long it would take the driver to clear up that mess.

Joining it from further down the street was another masked man, charging straight at us. His plain mask, almost featureless other than the garish smile, hiding the intent behind his eyes. From behind, I could still hear the heavy footfalls of the masked woman. Glancing over my shoulder, she’d closed the distance, easily eating up the lead I’d bought us. To the left, the silver van's engine roared as it tore up the street, finally having turned around.

I could hardly think straight, my thoughts whirling, images of what would happen to us if the Organisers caught us spiralling around in my mind. My eyes frantically scanned anything and everything, looking for any way out of here.

The fronts of the buildings lining the street were less than useless, they were all houses or small shops, closed, dilapidated or abandoned. Even if we could somehow get in, even if we could lose the two Organisers on foot, the vans would be waiting for us outside.

I thought about darting into the road again, taking my chances in the traffic. An image of the silver van, engine bellowing, slamming into me from behind, filled my mind. All I could think about was my breath being forced from my body, my bones crunching as it crushed me, pinning me to the ground with its colossal weight. 

Dispair began to set in, crashing over me as I tried to come to terms with what was about to happen. Panic-stricken, I tried one last time, desperately glancing around again. The smiling masked man was closer now. Just a few feet down the street, he’d be on us in a matter of seconds, and the footsteps behind were so loud that I swear the fingers of the masked woman were inches away, reaching out.

I thought this was it, that it was all over, when something met my gaze and my heart skipped a beat. One of the alleyways from before! In all of the confusion, I’d forgotten it was there. If we could just get there, cut through that, then we might buy ourselves some time. We weren't too far from it now, just a few feet. 

As quickly as it had risen, that hope was snuffed out as my heart sank again. There was no way we’d reach it before the smiling masked man reached us, he was far too close. Unless…

Grabbing Jenny’s arm again, I yanked her hard into the road.

“David, what the hell are you doing!” She screamed as a red Ford Focus slammed its brakes on, grinding to a halt in front of us. 

“Just trust me!” I yelled back, dragging her into the oncoming traffic. Ignoring the blaring horns, the angry yells and threats from the drivers, I pulled her further into the oncoming traffic. I was gambling at this point, and I knew it, a last-ditch attempt to get away. I had no idea if this would work, or if I’d end up getting us both splattered on someone's windscreen, but if we got caught, we were dead either way.

The bellowing of the silver van charging towards us cut through the cacophony, and I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. Glancing over my shoulder, I could see it, mere feet away. It was stuck, blocked by a green Audi that had stopped in the confusion. The Organiser was revving the engine fiercely, his eyes fixed on us as he blasted his horn in frustration.

I didn’t have time to savour this victory. In my peripheral vision, I caught sight of the masked woman. She’d not been expecting us to dart out again, and that had bought me a little distance, but again she was hot on our tail. She weaved between the stopped cars, gaining on us with every second.

Angry yells snapped my attention back to what was happening in front of me. The deafening cacophony of horns reached an all-time crescendo as the smiling masked man tried his best to follow us into the mess of vehicles. As though almost bouncing from car to car, he careened towards us like an angry bull.

Looking back to my left, we were just about level with the alleyway now. My heart was hammering, echoing around in my ears. This was working. Now we were all on the road, all we had to do was get back there.

The smiling masked man was nearly on us now, just a few cars away, and I could tell from the heavy footsteps that the masked woman wasn't far behind. It all hinged on this. Making as if to run to the right and over into the other lane of traffic, I dragged Jenny, about to throw us both towards the other side of the road.

Shrieking tyres cut through the air as the smiling masked man, preempting what I was about to do, had already made his way into the lane, the cars grinding to a halt behind him. Heavy footfalls from behind indicated that the masked woman hadn’t been so quick to assume, running along the lane dividers straight at us.

This was it. Taking a quick breath and whirling on the spot, my heartbeat was nearly deafening as I pushed off hard against the asphalt, still dragging Jenny with me. Nearly pulling her off her feet, she flailed frantically, trying to right herself as I dragged her back the way we’d come, back through the cars and onto the sidewalk.

Within moments, we were off the road and in the dingy alleyway, the frustrated yells of the Organisers not far behind. A light feeling of hope bubbled up in my stomach as I dragged Jenny further. Although my legs were screaming at me, begging for any brief moment of respite, I had to keep pushing.

The shadows of the buildings on either side cooled the beads of sweat that had begun forming across my face as we made our way further in, not daring to slow for an instant. The alley was dingy and claustrophobic. Litter and dust covered the floor, spewing from burst trash bags leaking from the dumpsters ahead. Jenny and I were having a hard time running side by side.

Four side doors, spaced evenly apart, were the only other features. Set into the back of the buildings on our right, these must have been how the businesses accessed the alley.

From behind, a sound that chilled me finally reached my ears. I’d been expecting it, but it still didn't stop the hairs on the back of my neck from standing on end. Echoing in the empty space between the buildings, the slamming footfalls of the Organisers seemed even more oppressive, and even closer now.

I dared a glance over my shoulder. Jenny and I were about halfway down the alley now, and looking back, I could see the two masked assailants. They were just entering the passage. Although they’d been slowed by my little stunt, they were coming up fast.

Behind them, I could see the black van blocking the entrance. It was stopped there, the driver oddly motionless as he watched us fleeing down the back alley. That flicker of hope bubbled up again. He couldn’t get down here!

But something didn’t feel right about this. I couldn’t help but wonder why he wasn’t more frustrated. Why wasn’t he moving off? And where was the silver one?

Maybe this is what we need to do? Just dive down the alleys like this, that would stop the vans. Then all we’d need to do is lose the Organisers on foot, and we’d be safe; we could head back to the warehouse or find somewhere new to hide, but we’d still be alive.

With this thought burning in my mind, I looked to the end of the alley, half expecting to see another Organiser running down it. Thankfully, there was no sign of anyone. In fact, what I did see sent that wave of hope soaring to whole new heights. Another alleyway, dead ahead, straight across the road. We could burst from the end of this one, charge across the road, hopefully lose the Organisers there again, then vanish down that alley. It would solve the problem of the vans at the very least.

I turned to Jenny, frantically pointing to the alley ahead.

“There, we can try to lose them there,” I squeezed out forcefully between gulping breaths. Talking was hurting my lungs, and running was hurting my lungs. As a matter of fact, everything was hurting. If this didn’t work, then I didn’t know how much longer I could keep this up.

“I’m not sure about this, David. They’ll just keep following us.” She sounded hopeless, defeated and exhausted.

“Not if we’re fast enough, now come on and keep…”

I was cut short by the roaring of an engine echoing through the alley, drowning out the heavy footsteps of the runners. The sound of blaring horns and muffled yells of obscenities joined the chorus as the sound of the van's engine seemed to dim, getting further and further away.

Glancing over my shoulder, the two masked figures were still on us, still gaining distance, but there was no sign of the black van behind them. I had no idea where it was going, and that creeping dread gently clawed at the back of my mind.

Then it all happened so fast, I barely had a chance to register what was going on. As I turned back, catching a glimpse of Jenny, there was a sharp movement from her right. Jenny was staring back over her shoulder, watching the Organisers chasing us, not registering what was happening.

Next, all I heard was a deafening slam and the startled yells of Jenny and someone else as they sprawled to the ground, the open side door of one of the buildings shaking violently on its hinges. Jenny fell flat on her back, the impact knocking her a little way back, a glowing red blotch already spreading across the side of her face. She’d run headlong into the door, facing the other way. She hadn’t seen it open until it was too late.

Opposite her, a young man of no more than twenty lay sprawled on the floor, his gangly limbs flailing as he fell. The trash bags he’d been carrying burst as he hit the ground, raining refuse in a shower around the alley. He was dazed, not having expected anyone to be on the other side of the door as he went to take the trash out.

I tried to stop, to turn on a dime and pull Jenny back up. My injured leg screamed at the strain as I slowed my momentum, and I ended up stumbling several feet forward, almost tripping over myself. Whirling around, I was just about to push off again, to dart to Jenny’s rescue, when I saw them.

The Organisers had closed the gap now. They couldn't have been more than six feet away from her. They were slowing down, almost walking now, confident in their victory. All I could do was watch as Jenny stared at me. That look on her face, that terrified, pleading expression, wrenched at my heart. She was only a few feet away, but there was nothing I could do for her.

The stunned young man, probably a worker in a café, judging by what he was wearing, had gotten to his feet and stumbled over to Jenny, trying his best to help her up. It wasn’t until the Organisers were about three feet away that he finally noticed them. He dropped Jenny and backed away slowly, stuttering something about not wanting to get involved.

Jenny’s look of pleading slowly resolved into a look of grim acceptance as she watched the man back away, backing towards me. Both of her hopes of rescue now hopelessly out of reach.

I wanted to run to her, to pull her up and carry on fleeing, dragging her with me if I had to. I was the one who’d suggested this whole thing, and we’d so nearly managed to escape. We couldn’t fall at the final hurdle… not like this. Without thinking, I took a tentative step forward… then caught myself. There was no time. No feasible way for me to get to her without getting caught myself. I was helpless.

Although this all happened in a matter of seconds, it felt like time had slowed, like I was being forced to watch each excruciating second in explicit detail.

The Organisers caught up to Jenny. The man in the smiling mask slammed his fist into the back of her head, sending her crashing down again. She screamed in agony. Whirling herself around, she flailed at him wildly, hoping to catch him with a heavy blow, but he dodged it easily before kicking her hard in the stomach. I hoped, somewhat in vain, that those weren’t steel-toe-capped boots. But from the horrible crack that echoed down the alley, I could tell it didn’t matter, the blow had broken some of Jenny’s ribs regardless.

As she writhed in pain on the ground, the smiling-masked man crouched over her, pulled something from his back pocket, and clamped it around her wrist with a click. He dragged her roughly to her feet, ignoring the screams and whimpers as her cracked ribs twisted. I couldn’t make out her face too clearly, her hair was now haphazardly splayed across it, but what I could see turned my stomach. Through the flyaway strands stuck to her skin, I saw it: that expression of abject terror as the reality of what was happening sank in.

All the while, the masked woman had kept walking, not even glancing at Jenny. I expected her to charge me down next, the other target, the other reason they were here. But she wasn’t walking toward me.

She was moving toward the café worker.

He was backing away from her, terrified, stammering again that he didn’t see anything, that he didn’t want to get involved. I watched in horror as he took a step back and his foot collided with an empty can. The sound snapped his attention downward just as he stumbled. That was all she needed.

She closed the gap in seconds, precise, practised. She slammed her shoulder into him, knocking him flat before pinning him to the ground with her boot. He scrambled at it frantically, screaming, trying to wrap his fingers around it and push her off. She stomped on his chest, hard, knocking the air out of him.

Then she turned.

Her mask slowly rotated toward me, coming to a dead stop, facing me full-on. A shiver crawled down my spine as we stood there in the alley, eyes locked, the poor man screaming beneath her boot. As he flailed, punching at her ankle and pleading with her to let him go, she reached behind her and pulled something from her belt.

It was black and jagged, a hunting knife. The blade glinted menacingly as she brought it up to her face, inspecting it like it was an old friend.

The screaming from the man beneath her seemed to increase tenfold as he saw what was in her hand. He punched harder, tried to buck under the boot and throw her off with his weight, but it was futile; she barely seemed to register his efforts. Without taking her eyes from the knife, she raised her boot again before bringing it down hard. With a sickening crunch, his nose shattered from the impact and blood burst from his lips. The screaming crescendoed, before breaking down into racking sobs of anguish.

As if satisfied with her weapon, she lowered it slightly, not breaking eye contact, and in a swift single motion drove it hard into the side of his neck. The man’s eyes widened as the blade entered his throat, terror flooding them as the razor edge tore through the soft flesh of his neck with ease. Within seconds, he was coughing, choking on the steady stream of crimson that was billowing from the wound, dribbling from the sides of his mouth and leaking from his nostrils.

With another calm, calculated movement, the masked woman withdrew the blade, wiping it clean on her leg as the man choked and spluttered. All the while, she was still facing me, still staring at me as I stood there, frozen to the spot. I couldn’t see her eyes through the mesh of the mask's holes, but I could imagine the cold, calculating expression on her face.

Lifting her foot from the dying man, leaving him to bleed out on the alley floor, she turned her body to face me. Standing stock still, she watched me, waiting, almost daring me to do something. I wanted to help the man. His eyes were darting frantically, his hands scrambling at the pulsing torrent of crimson life now leaking from his throat. But what could I do?

Even if I could help him, there’d be no way that I could fight off the masked woman; it would be a death sentence. She had a knife, and she obviously knew how to use it. All I had was a bad leg and sore ribs, nothing of any use to anyone. The only thing I could do was watch as that innocent bystander slowly bled to death in the alley, all because I’d chosen to drag Jenny up it to escape. If it hadn’t been for us, then this poor young man would be back to waiting tables for unhappy customers before going home to his family. Instead, all that had been snuffed out by the masked monster stood over him.

A roaring engine cut through my thoughts and snapped my attention to the right. Although she didn’t move, the masked woman diverted her focus, too. At the far end of the alley, the black van had rematerialised, parked with its side door facing the entrance.

The smiling masked man had hold of Jenny’s wrists. He was dragging her aggressively back towards the van. She was flailing and kicking at him, stumbling and falling with each subsequent attempt, but he was unrelenting.

I took a step towards them, my hands balled into fists, before catching myself. The masked woman was still there, watching me. As soon as I made a move, she’d grab me, maybe stab me, and then it would be over. I felt sick as all I could do was stand there helplessly while Jenny fought.

She was screaming, yelling at the top of her lungs. Loud, racking, terrified sobs echoed through the alley, each one setting a fresh wave of goosebumps across my skin. I wanted to help her, to save her. I felt so useless standing here, so trapped.

Just feet away from the van now, Jenny threw another heavy kick backwards. It was frantic, uncoordinated, but it landed. Her foot almost disappeared into the smiling masked man's stomach temporarily, the force transferring hard, before he crumpled to the ground, losing his grip on her handcuffs.

Hope bubbled up, a bright light lifting away some of the terror pressing down on me. This wasn't over yet. Maybe we could still get out of this somehow. Screaming as she did so, Jenny charged forward with all she had left. With the van blocking her way behind, and the smiling masked man getting back to his feet, she ran in the only available direction, straight towards me and the masked woman.

I saw her twitch in my peripheral vision, her mask turning to face Jenny, ready to grab her if she got too far. With Jenny distracting her, maybe I’d be able to do something. Grab the knife and stab her with it, or knock her to the ground so we could gain some distance.

My mind was whirling as I tried to imagine possible scenarios, the best way to make the most of this moment. If we could buy enough time, then I was sure we could get to the next alley, and we could lose them there. I’d figure out a way to get the handcuffs off Jenny when we were safe, but she could still run.

Still grappling with those ideas in my head, that ray of hope that had shone through was suddenly eclipsed again as I took in what was happening. Behind Jenny’s terrified, fleeing form, the smiling masked man was gaining. He was inches away now, his hand reaching out before wrapping itself tightly around her hair.

Yanking hard, Jenny barely had a moment to register what was going on before she fell to the ground, her head hitting the floor with a sickening thud. She lay there, sprawled on the concrete, dazed by the impact, as the smiling masked man reached for her ankle. She kicked out, but it felt uncoordinated. Half-hearted, as though she wasn't fully in control. He withdrew, easily avoiding the blow, before fixing his hand around her ankle and dragging her back towards the van.

I watched in horror as the van's side door slid open with a heavy thud, revealing another masked man, one whom I recognised. The smooth, featureless mask. His large frame. My vision seemed to tunnel, the alleyway falling away from me as I laid eyes on the brute from the supermarket, the one who had taken my fingers.

The smiling masked man was still dragging Jenny ever closer to the opening as she struggled helplessly against him. That blow to her head was slowly wearing off, but it wasn't enough. The masked brute dropped from the van with a thud, closing the distance between him and Jenny in a matter of seconds.

The last I saw of Jenny was the terrified expression on her face, the abject horror, knowing what was about to happen to her. As though sensing there was no way out, she locked eyes with me from across the alley, giving me a pleading look. My stomach tied in a knot as a wave of nausea washed over me. This was my fault, it was all my fault…

Tears welled up in my eyes as she screamed my name. I was expecting some shout, some plea for help, but all she said was

“David… Please…”

Before the brute dragged a black cotton bag over her head and her face vanished from view. Effortlessly scooping her up over his shoulder, she screamed as he made his way back to the van. She flailed and kicked as hard as she could, several hits landing, hitting the brute square in the stomach and chest, but he didn’t flinch.

Taking a couple of steps, he flung her into the back of the van, the heavy thump of her landing carrying all the way to me. Then the smiling masked man hopped in the back, shortly followed by the brute. He turned to close the door, pausing for a second as he stared at me. Slowly, he raised a hand… and waved.

Bile rose in my throat. The way that he’d moved, the slow, non-threatening mannerism, reminded me of how he spoke to me on that rooftop, as though this was nothing more than a job and that in any other circumstance he’d be one of the nicest people you’d meet… The sick fuck remembered me.

Dropping his hand again, he slammed the door shut. Wincing at the sound, all I could do was watch helplessly, fighting back the tears of guilt as the van's engine roared into life. The tyres span for a brief second, struggling to gain traction, before gripping the sidewalk, the van disappearing from view, and in doing so, sealing Jenny’s fate.

I hardly had a second to register what had happened, to acknowledge the well of feelings threatening to overflow inside me, when movement in peripheral vision snapped my attention back to the young man on the floor.

The masked woman, still this entire time, had now taken a step towards me. Slow and methodical, it was as if she were daring me to run. My heart was beating frantically in my chest now, she was so close.

Another step, again, slow and deliberate. She watched my reaction as I recoiled slightly, all the while that expressionless mask fixed on my face. Matching her, I took a slow step backwards. I knew as soon as I turned, as soon as I ran, that she’d be on me. I couldn’t help but imagine her as a lioness stalking her prey, revelling in the chase.

Yet another step towards me. Backing away slowly, I scanned around for anything that I could use as a distraction. I needed to get out of here, but I needed to slow her down first, otherwise I’d be being thrown into the back of a van, or worse.

As she took another step forward, I backed away again, a soft clinking sound reaching my ears as my foot collided with something. Daring a quick glance towards it, it was a half-full bottle of beer. Again, this must have been in the trash bag that the boy was carrying. Half of it had leaked across the concrete, but some still remained in the bottle itself.

An idea began to form in my head as I watched the liquid sloshing back and forth. Slowly, I reached down to pick it up. The masked woman took another step towards me as I did so. She didn’t seem to care about what I was doing, she knew I couldn’t get away, so now she was taking her time.

Wrapping my fingers around the cool glass, I took a breath, ready for what I needed to do. This wasn't my best idea, hell, it wasn't even really an idea, more of a desperate Hail Mary. Quickly as I could, I snapped upright, flailing the end of the bottle towards her face. The tepid amber liquid shot from the neck, the sunlight dancing through it as it flew towards her face.

She threw her hands up, as though expecting something larger, the small droplets of liquid dancing between her fingers and through the mesh of her eye holes. With an annoyed grunt, she jerked her head to the side as the droplets made contact with her eyes. That was all I needed. Summoning what strength I had into my shoulder, I snapped it back as hard as I could, before hurling the bottle at her with all I had.

No sooner had the cool glass left my fingers, I turned on my heel, pushing off as hard as I could. The shattering sound behind me was accompanied by another irritated grunt as the bottle connected with its target. All I could do now was run and hope. I had no plan, no idea of what to do to get out of this. No way to save Jenny.

I ran, bursting from the end of the alleyway into the street. It was quiet, much like the other one, but there were a few more pedestrians. Taking a left out of the alley, I charged as fast as I could, much to the surprise of anyone I came across. Within a few seconds, the footsteps started up again, and I knew she was coming…

I still think back to that day, to Jenny being taken, and that poor waiter. I keep asking myself if there was something I could have done. It keeps me up at night. But that wasn't even the worst of it, oh no. What happened next has been burned into my mind for a long time now.

I’ll post again as soon as I’m able. It's taking a lot out of me, remembering these things, and people are starting to notice.
