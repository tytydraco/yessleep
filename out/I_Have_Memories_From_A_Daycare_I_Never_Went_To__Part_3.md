I stayed up most of last night looking for any evidence of a Mrs. or Mr. Rand in or around Racine. I never actually saw any Mr. Rand as far as I can remember, but then again she did call herself *Mrs*. Rand, didn’t she? I even started checking obituary records. I found nothing. No death records, no police reports, not even anything in the digital phone books. The internet is as clueless as my parents when it comes to this topic.

In a bit of a low moment I even searched up murders and accidents in Racine relating to the name *Cory*. Obviously everything I looked at was entirely unrelated to what I was looking for but I feel like I had to check. I just can’t stop thinking about the day I met him at the park. How I shook his hand. How he hopped around me. 

“Now you’re in the weird! You’re in the weird! You’re in the weird!” he had shouted as he pranced. I couldn’t stop his words from rattling around in my head. It seemed to have knocked so many other things loose because once I remembered that, the other memories started pouring back to the front of my mind. Like a dam that shattered, turning a controlled leak into a tidal wave, flooding my brain. 

It was a stormy day, I remember. We were back to being cooped up inside, finding things to occupy our time. Our chosen activity was holding Pokémon card bazaars. We all brought our collections from home and left them here for just such an occasion. Every rainy day we brought out our cards and would set the ones we were willing to trade out in front of us and a makeshift market was formed on the shag carpet as the rain pattered against the windows. 

I remember I traded a Reshiram to Ethan for a Gible. He took it quickly and moved on to another part of the carpet, thinking he pulled a fast one on me. The truth was I had two prints of that Reshiram, and the Gible card was cute. I guess we were both happy in the end. 

I was packing up my cards for the day when I heard a kind of quiet crying. When I followed the sound it led me upstairs to find Sarah standing at the window. Her shoulders shuddered as she fought to control herself. I walked next to her and tried to follow her eyeline out the window. The only thing she could have been staring at through the wind blown rain was the *tall house*. It was obscured in the storm but there was no mistaking its foreign presence looming above the tree line.

“Is everything okay?” I asked, not really knowing what I could do to help with any issue. She shook her head, still staring out at the tall house. Tears ran in silent rivers down her face.

“It's taller now.” she said, steading her voice as much as she could. I winced, trying to focus on the odd structure. It *did* seemingly have another layer to it. The siding of the top most section was a faded powder blue now where before it had been an ugly yellow. The tanned shingles had turned into a dark grey/brown and even the roof *shape* seemed different. 

“Oh.” I said, stupidly. The tall house haunted me in the days after I had first noticed it in the backyard. I looked for it day after day but I quickly realized the only place I could see it in the distance was at Mrs. Rands. I chopped it up to a trick of geography. I guess I had to believe that, because the alternative made no sense. 

“It’s my house.” Sarah said. “The one I lived at before the door disappeared.”

I turned around, staring at the front door to Mrs. Rand’s. Could she really not see it? What did she see when she looked at it then? Blank wall? A large window? Or just simply… nothing? I remember trying to imagine nothing in that moment. I didn’t come up with much.

“Lily’s house was that yellow one. She was gone a few days after we noticed. Then the wax people came after she left.” Sarah said, the shudders now reduced to a blank and penetrating fear. I was beyond my depth. At the ripe age of nine I couldn’t even comfort someone with a rational issue. This was leagues away from anything I could handle.

“Where did she go?” I asked. Before she could answer, another voice rang in my ears, and we both turned to find Cory.

“Hi, Sarah! Hi, Ben!” he said, bouncing on his heels.

“Hi.” I returned, blankly. Sarah didn’t say anything. Only started shuddering again. Cory focused his cold, blue eyes on Sarah. 

“Sarah, the time is quickly approaching for you to make a very important decision.” he said, keeping his happy manner. I saw Sarah shaking under his gaze. She dropped her eyes at the mention of ‘decision’. It was like she already knew what he was going to ask. Even so, she tried to get away with playing coy.

“Wh… what’s that, Cory?” she said. He beamed as he answered.

“You can either *dance*, be *cut*, or *remain*.” 

He bounced on his heels when he said ‘dance’. His smile seemed to widen, stretching the scar when he said ‘be cut’, and it dropped just as quickly when he said ‘remain’. 

“Oh no…” a voice sounded near the staircase. Mrs. Rand stood there, the standard look of sadness replaced by a strange hue of fear that was traditionally alien to see worn by adults. “I thought she had more time Cory? The others were usually given more time? I thought-”

Cory shot her a look that froze the words in her mouth. For a moment, they stared at each other like statues, one fearful and other contemptuous. Mrs. Rand broke first, and ran down to the kitchen where we heard begin to cry. Cory turned back to face us again.

“Think about it!” he said before turning his blue gaze to me. “You too, Ben! Can’t be too prepared!” He turned and skipped away, down the stairs and out of sight. Sarah resumed her silent shaking.

“That’s the choice he told Lily.” she whimpered. “She told him she would dance. She was gone the next day.”

I was caught wordless again. I turned back to the window. The tall house remained, its patchwork colors faded by the gray downpours. Its new, blue crown rested a little more omnibus than before. 

“Where did you live, Sarah?” I said, partly without thinking. “I mean… where was that house before it was there?” I said a little more tactfully as I extended a finger at the tall house. 

“Across the street.” she sniffled. Confusion gripped me. She did? I lived across the street and I think I would have remembered her being my neighbor. I brought her to a window that looked out onto the street and asked her where it was. “It’s gone now.” she said. “Its just tall grass.”

“Well where *was* it?” I asked. “Point at it.” I remember the feeling of my stomach dropping as her trembling finger pointed directly across the street. Right at *my* house.

“There.” she cried. “It was right there.” 

At first I thought that had meant that somehow Sarah had lived in my house before we moved in. She said she hadn't been home in a long time and I figured ‘who knows?’ 

That theory was proven wrong. As my curiosity around this place grew, I asked some of the other kids houses where part of the colorful stack that made up the tall house. They all denied that theirs made up a part of it, but when I asked where they lived since I hadn’t seen them around the neighborhood, I would get the same answer every time.

“Right across the street.” Jasper had said, pointing at my house that same way Sarah had. Lucas and Ethan followed suit and it would turn out that everyone had the same answer. We all lived in the house across the street. *Directly* across the street. Though each child gave a vastly different description of what their house looked like. Despite the different descriptions, I only ever saw my own house across the blacktop. 

Cory became more insistent that Sarah give him an answer to his vague choice. Day after day he would come to her, keeping the same habit of asking and the same grin on his face. He would bounce his heels on the word *dance*, smile at the word *cut*, and turn his face straight at the word *remain*. He kept this up until one day he said all three with the straight face.

“You can *dance*. You can *be cut*. Or you can *remain*.” he said, chewing on every word. “You have to choose sometime. You have to choose *soon*.” Sarah was a teary eyed mess. No one came to her rescue and risked angering Cory. No one except Mrs. Rand of all people. She ran to Cory, falling to her knees and pulling at his shirt. Tears stained her face just as they did Sarah’s.

“Please give her more time! Give them all more time! They’re just *children*!” she cried. Cory stared at her with an uncharacteristic frown. It almost looked like disgust. Like a dark sky looks at the ocean. Threatening and violent. His voice was different when he spoke this time. It still sounded like Cory but it was deeper. It was what I would imagine him to sound like if he were aged twenty more years.

“I knew you were *weak*.” he said, staring her in the eye. Her quaking stopped all at once at the sound of his tone. Everything seemed to stop. “C’mon. This needs to be *fixed*.” he said, grabbing Mrs. Rand by the wrist. She didn’t resist at first as Cory began to move, but then she pulled and struggled. It was futile. Cory didn’t seem to exert himself at all as he effortlessly dragged Mrs. Rand into the toy room as she screamed. The door slammed shut after they entered and then we heard nothing at all. 

It seemed like an eternity of tense silence passed before the door creaked open again. Cory left first, a look of calm content on his face, then followed Mrs. Rand walking behind him. If you could still call the woman that walked out Mrs. Rand, that is. She looked the same upon first glance, but she was *smiling*. Mrs. Rand never smiled and now, resting on her face, was such a forced and implacable one. That was bad enough but then we noticed her *eyes*.

Mrs. Rand's eyes were completely flat. That isn’t meant to say her eyes lacked emotion, I mean they were *flat*. Like a wall or a piece of paper. From now on, whenever she looked at something, her eyes wouldn't move but instead her whole head would turn to face it. Lucas went white as a ghost when he saw her. Jasper burst into tears. I must’ve compartmentalized the image until now. We all stood there motionless for a time before the thing that was supposed to be Mrs. Rand spoke in an artificially chipper voice.

“I’ll fix you all some lunch!” she said, moving to the kitchen in a wooden manner.

I felt worse the next couple days at Mrs. Rands and it was only made worse when Sarah wasn’t there one day. I asked everyone, everyone but Cory and Mrs. Rand, if they had seen her. No one had. Days passed without her showing up and I clung to some false hope that she just stopped attending the daycare. That she wound up seeing the front door and going home after all. That hope was broken when I caught a glimpse of a dark figure on the eternal gray screen of the upstairs Mac one afternoon. 

I had grown so used to the thing always being on, always showing that concrete room that any irregularity to that was alrighty frightening. It was made worse when I focused on the screen and saw a small girl sitting cross legged in the middle of the gray room. I knew who it was even before I saw her long, dark hair and her ill-fitting clothing. It was Sarah.

Even at that age I was able to put together some fragments of the puzzle. She wasn’t dancing in that room and from what I could tell she didn’t have any cuts. Sarah had chosen to remain.
