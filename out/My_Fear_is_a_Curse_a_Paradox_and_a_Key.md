*“Being afraid is perfectly natural, Russ. There’s nothing more human than fear.”*

*“It’s a reminder that you’re alive, after all.”*

*"Anyone who's alive has something to lose, right?"*

Dr. Auclair would say things like that to me all the time, waxing poetic bullshit in my general direction from five to six P.M. every Tuesday evening for nearly a decade.

I liked my childhood therapist, don’t get me wrong. He was kind, attentive, and he seemed to be trying his damndest to fix me. That said, none of cognitive behavioral therapy worked, of course. How could it? As much as I attempted to explain that my fear was just plain different and may not respond to his normal repertoire of techniques, Dr. Auclair didn’t appear to understand.

At least, that's what I *used* to believe. Now, it's clear to me that Dr. Auclair did understand, he just wasn't making his intentions known, manipulating and pulling me along like a conniving puppeteer.

My current theory is that, somehow, the fear was the key to his release. But before it could free him, though, it needed to be *purified*. Distilled to perfection, the terror fermenting over years like a decadent Merlot.

And when he decided it was exquisitely ripe, Dr. Auclair culled it without a second thought.

I wish I knew *how* he did it and *why* I was chosen in particular, but I suspect I’ll never get those answers; I’m learning how to live with that.

One day at a time.

Normal fear is born from something; it doesn’t just appear out of nowhere.There’s always a cause and an effect.

Something horrific happens, and the result is fear. You take a tumble down some stairs, and now you’re afraid of falling. Your aunt’s German Shepard bites you, and now you’re afraid of dogs.

My fear, on the other hand, never had that linkage. It just…was. The exception that proves the rule. Terror born without a mother; the fear equivalent of immaculate conception.

I know what you're thinking: isn’t that just anxiety, then? Some generalized, vague fear of everything? That’s the rub, though. My fears weren’t universal; quite the contrary, actually. They were *hyper*\-specific. Unexplainably pinpointed from the very beginning.

Ever since I can remember, I’ve been afraid of something, or someone, popping out of an enclosed space.

Take my first birthday party. The moment a gift was put in front of me, which my family wrapped for the fun it, I was inconsolable. I’m told I was wailing like a banshee, trying to run away from the gift on legs that barely had the coordination to walk. My response was *so extreme* that my parents actually ended up taking me to the emergency room. They thought I may have been having a seizure or something. The doctors checked me out, but I was completely fine.

After a few disastrous Christmas mornings, I was booked for therapy with Dr. Auclair.

I always left his office feeling a little better, but in the long run, my fear never improved. If anything, it steadily worsened, year after year, reaching a peak intensity right before the event that would make our small town national news.

\- - - - -

*“Have you ever noticed how you talk about your fear, Russ? The vocabulary you use, I mean?”*

Twelve-year-old me shrugged, struggling to provide an answer.

Dr. Auclair put down his notepad and leaned forward in his chair.

*“Well, you always describe it as ‘****I’m of afraid of something popping out’****. Never* ***jumping out***\*. Never\* ***emerging***\*. Never\* ***appearing***\*. Whatever you’re afraid of, it’s always ‘**popping out**’. Why do you think that is?”\*

Honestly, I found his question irritating. He knew me well by that point: I felt like he could have guessed how I was going to respond.

*“Like I’ve said before, I don’t understand why I fear what I fear. It’s all just…a feeling; something in my gut that makes total sense to me, even if I can’t explain it. Like, I just know that ‘****popped out****’ is the right phrase. It’s the only correct words to describe it, even if I'm unable to tell you why.*

*“What does it matter, anyway?”*

He leaned back, smiling at me.

*“I suppose you’re right. In the grand scheme of things, it doesn’t matter.”*

Dr. Auclair winked, pulled his box-shaped glasses to the bridge of his nose, and then he said something that made no sense at the time.

*“Not yet at least.”*

When Jack died, I was desperate to have a visit with Dr. Auclair, but I found that he was scheduled to move out of town *the exact day he died*. Everything had been planned months in advance. He was already long gone by the time I called the office.

Didn't mention any of that to me.

Didn't leave a forwarding address, either.

I developed a veritable Rolodex of bullies over my high school years; honestly, there had to be at least one on every page of my yearbook. My strange fear made me an easy target.

I wouldn’t classify Jack as a bully, though. That shithead was an entirely different breed. *Tormentor* is probably a more appropriate label, but even *that* doesn’t capture the depths of his sadism.

Although the boy was thin, he compensated for that by being tall; towering over me at a height of at least six and a half feet. Wide forehead, freckled face, beady eyes. An absolute fucking monster prowling this earth with hate seething behind his eyes, inflicting pain without limitations.

Once he discovered my fear of something or someone *popping out* at me, he simply could not get enough. The joy and the satisfaction that Jack was able to milk from my admittedly peculiar terror was seemingly endless. To him, my trauma was a wellspring of fresh dopamine created for him and him alone to enjoy, refilling itself infinitely.

If it wasn’t a beating, it was him sneaking up with a shoebox containing a spider, popping it out at me once he got close. If it wasn’t a prank that targeted my fears, it was a laundry list of insults spit at me, usually about how *pathetic* my fears were. No matter what, it was something every day, weekends included.

Preoccupied by a messy divorce, my parents weren’t much help. Because of that, Mr. Muller was my only source of support.

I’d known the man my whole life. He lived alone in a three-story house down the street for the last forty years. Never found himself a wife, never had any kids. When he retired from his job as a mechanical engineer, Mr. Muller finally pursued his genuine passions; custom-built toys. His shop never seemed to get much business, but I don’t think that was the point. Unburdened by the financial strain that comes with having a family, he’d accumulated a small fortune for himself over the years, which allowed the shop to remain afloat even if it wasn't turning a profit.

We had a certain kinship, Mr. Muller and me. He was an outcast, too; his eccentricities kept people at arm’s length. But he was always kind to me, day in and day out, taking me in and patching up my injuries, both physical and mental.

Despite our close relationship, I never disclosed the specific details of my fears to him. Embarrassment had stitched my lips shut. He knew I was different, like him, and that made me a target for people like Jack, which made what he did nearly impossible to explain.

Unless there was some outside influence that had been pulling the strings.

\- - - - -

One afternoon, I arrived at Mr. Muller’s, holding back hot tears from the blinding pain in my wrist.

I had been walking home when Jack marched up behind me, shouting obscenities per usual. I didn't say anything back. I didn’t respond period. I kept my head down and my eyes fixed on the sidewalk in front of me.

All I wanted was for him to go away.

He didn’t take my cold shoulder too kindly, knocking me to the ground with a kick and stomping on my wrist over and over again, despite my pleas for mercy. Age did not temper his savagery; at seventeen, Jack was still the same monster he was at twelve.

It took a while, but I convinced Mr. Muller not to call the police. Jack’s father was the sheriff, and he shielded his boy from many legal repercussions throughout his youth. Needless to say, I had been that down that road before, and it only made everything worse.

Mr. Muller was livid, face flushed with boiling anger, but he nodded in agreement.

As I walked out, I said something that I’ll regret for the rest of my life.

*“I just wish he felt my fear.”*

\- - - - -

I stopped by Mr. Muller’s a week later, and when he saw me, he could barely contain his excitement. The man was practically bursting at the seams when he informed me that he had something *really important* to show me.

The behavior was immediately unnerving. Although he had eccentric hobbies, Mr. Muller wasn’t socially awkward or prone to bouts of mania. Growing up in a very strict, very religious German background actually made him obsessively polite and perpetually reserved, so watching him skip and hop through his house like a court jester immediately set me off.

Something was desperately wrong with my friend.

I tried to convince him to take a seat in the living room and just talk to me, but he pretended like he couldn’t hear what I said, frolicking down his basement stairs with an uncanny jubilance. Reluctantly, I followed him down.

When I arrived at the bottom, Mr. Muller was nowhere to be seen, but I could hear him; humming a nursery rhyme to himself in his workshop, a few yards away behind a cracked door.

I slowly tilted the door open, and my long held fear finally became realized.

There was a massive crate in the middle of the room. The sides of it were covered in nonsense words like *Hrlix* and *Abdunith,* haphazardly painted amongst various shapes and runes I didn’t recognize. Splatters of dark greens, blacks and bright reds covered every fiber of the box like post modern art installation.

Immediately, my heart rate skyrocketed. Blood pulsed heavy waves in my ears.

Before I could come up with a way to excuse myself, Mr. Muller was dancing over to the crate. He sauntered around the side of it, disappearing behind the enormous box.

For a moment, I thought I saw another figure in the corner, wreathed in shadow.

They were staring at me with a downright debilitating intensity, wearing a rapturous smile that extended from ear to ear. The phantom’s box-shaped glasses glinted against the ceiling light as they pulled a single necrotic hand from the darkness, waving pus-stained fingers in my direction, as if beckoning me closer.

It looked like Dr. Auclair.

There was a metallic twisting sound, which pulled my attention to the crate and Mr. Muller. When my eyes flickered back to the dark corner, the specter had disappeared. Then, I heard something that injected liquid frost into my veins.

There were muffled whimpers emanating from *within* the box.

Before I could run, Mr. Muller began singing, bellowing and hollering the words like a TV evangelist. All the while, the metallic twisting noise grew louder and louder, seemingly in unison with his ungodly fervor.

*“All around the cobbler’s bench*  
*The monkey chased the weasel,*  
*The monkey thought ‘twas all in fun*  
*Pop! Goes the weasel.”*

And then the top of the crate swung open, revealing what was inside.

Every single moment that I’ve ever been afraid and every shred of terror that I’ve ever felt crystalized into that one moment, manifesting this pristine latticework of pain, shock, and panic in my mind.

My fear was like a wedge of coal that had been put under years of extreme pressure until it finally transmuted into a brilliant, shimmering diamond.

Terror in its purest form.

Jack, bloodied and broken, *popped* out of the crate. I expected him to fall forward, but instead, he hung in the air, blocking the ceiling light like an eclipse. A steel pole has been fused to his spine, connected to his bones via a combination of nails, cautery and thick metallic thread. I could hear Jack’s weathered skin ripping and tearing from the tension of his weight against gravity. Blood seeped down the pole; new crimson dripping over older brown-black stains, trailing down to a massive spring located at the base of the crate.

My trembling eyes drifted to Jack’s maddened, bloodshot gaze, and I could see it.

He stared at me with a wild, primal, incomprehensible fear.

\- - - - -

Months later, I’d hear Mr. Muller’s testimony. When he explained *why* he kidnapped and mutilated Jack, I couldn’t help but feel a tiny blip of Déjà vu rattle around in my skull.

He almost sounded like me talking to my childhood therapist.

*“I wanted Russ to be safe. But like I’ve mentioned before, I don’t completely understand* ***why*** *I hurt him like that. It was just…a feeling I couldn’t ignore.”*

\- - - - -

I might never uncover Dr. Auclair’s part in these events. In spite of that, another matter weighs more heavily on my mind than his role in my torment, Jack’s death, and his disappearance.

The paradox of it all.

Look at it this way: it seems like I felt the reverberations of this event all throughout my life, even though it hadn’t happened yet. That's where my fear came from, I think. It’s like the sensation was so intense that it somehow echoed through me backwards, altering my consciousness since the day I was born. But in order for me to have my fears, Jack has to have died, and in order for him to die, he needed to bully me - that’s what caused Mr. Muller’s psychotic break in first place. But Jack targeted me for bullying *because* of my fears, which were predicated on him being killed in such a nightmarish manner…

You see what I mean? The more I think about it, the more it all collapses in on itself. It’s like trying to build a house by starting from the roof and working down.

If you know of Dr. Auclair, or have experienced something similar to this, please let me know.

Before I end this post, though, I want to leave you all with some food for thought.

I’ve been doing some googling today about where the name *Jack-in-the-Box* came from, and this what I found:

*“It has been expressed through folklore and legends that in 15th century France they were using the boxes for a very specific purpose. In French, a jack-in-the-box is called a* ***diable en boîte***\*, *which translates to “****devil in a box****.” It is said that these boxes were actually created to capture and hold demons or evil spirits. Many would fashion the boxes with elaborate engravings and amusing artwork to lure the demon’s interest. They would then employ the playful music and surprise opening of the lid to trap the demons. Their essence was then believed to become trapped in the Jack character, which was why they were originally made to look sinister with maniacal grins. The box was then to be hidden away where no one would ever be tempted to open it again, as doing so would cause the demon to be released back into our dimension.”* (Resource: “*Strange Origins of the Jack-in-the-Box”* by M.R. Cameo)

What was Dr. Auclair?

Did I release him somehow?

And is Jack trapped where he *used*[ to be?](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/)
