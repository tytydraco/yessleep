“Water,” I rasped, for the sixth time in half an hour. My throat felt like it had been lined with ash. The nurse didn’t blink, didn’t sigh, didn’t question—just poured from a jug into a small plastic cup and handed it to me without looking in my eyes. Her movements were so precise they almost seemed rehearsed, like she was a puppet on invisible strings or a machine programmed for efficiency. Maybe that’s just what professionalism looked like in this place. Or maybe it wasn’t human at all.

I tilted the cup back, desperate for the relief that never came. Water slid down, but the dryness stayed. It was like trying to quench a fire by spitting into it.

The clock on the wall ticked: 10:30 a.m. Dante still hadn’t shown. I’d asked about him five times already. Each time, her answer had been the same: “Shortly.” One word. Same tone. Same pitch. Like a recording replayed. By the fifth time, I wasn’t even sure if she was answering me—or just following a script.

I was about to ask again when the intercom crackled, the sudden burst of static shattering the room’s stillness. The phone on the white table was the only splash of color here—an old, sun-faded red handset, its coiled cord rooted into the wall like a parasite. It looked out of place, too old, too deliberate.

The nurse picked up immediately. I strained to hear the other voice, but she blocked it with her body. All I caught were her replies:

“Yes, she is here.”

“All normal.”

“Yes. Floor thirteen.”

Same flat delivery, no rise or fall. As though she’d rehearsed those words too.

She hung up, checked my vitals again with cold fingers, then left through the white door without a word. The room swallowed me whole in her absence. Fifteen minutes bled by, the silence gnawing at me. My throat burned again, but stranger still—I realized I hadn’t eaten in five days. Four of them in a coma, the fifth awake. No hunger pangs. No growling stomach. Just… emptiness. My body looked fine. My hands, my skin, my reflection in the glass of the monitor—normal. Too normal. Like I’d been pressed into a mold and poured back out.

The thought lodged in my head: what if I wasn’t me anymore?

But just as that thought crossed my mind the door opened without warning. No knock. No voice. Just the heavy swing of metal. Two soldiers stepped in first, dressed like the ones from that night, their expressions unreadable beneath shadowed brows. They took their positions on either side of the door like statues.

Then Dante walked in.

For a second, his face lit when he saw me—but the smile vanished just as quickly when he scanned the room, taking in the sterile walls, the soldiers, the too-white bed where I lay. “I thought she was out of observation,” he muttered, his tone clipped, irritated. He didn’t look at me—he looked past me, to the soldier on the right.

“Sir Roth’s orders,” the man said flatly.

Dante’s jaw clenched, and he rolled his eyes. “Of course.” He sank into the chair beside me, the weight of exhaustion in the slump of his shoulders. When he finally looked at me again, there was something in his eyes that caught me off guard—empathy. And something else. Caution.

“Hey, Remi,” he said softly.

I didn’t know what to feel. Gratitude? Betrayal? He’d saved me. He’d helped burn the store to the ground. But he’d also known more than he ever let on. The truth was a splinter under my skin I couldn’t dig out.

Then, before I could say a word, he whispered: “I’m sorry.”

The words hit like a punch to the chest.

“It’s not fine,” I snapped, my voice cracking under the weight of my thirst and the ache of confusion. “Explain. What the hell is going on?”

Dante looked over his shoulder. “A moment,” he ordered the soldiers, flicking his hand dismissively. They exchanged a glance, then stepped out, closing the door behind them.

For the first time, we were alone.

Dante leaned forward, elbows on his knees, his voice dropping low. His eyes—warm, but edged with something sharp—locked onto mine.

“I’m not just some random teenager who got caught up in this,” he said slowly, like every word was being pried out of him. “I work for a company. Eidolon Systems Research. ESR.”

The name lingered in the sterile air, heavier than it should’ve been. My throat burned, but not from thirst this time.

“They’re not government,” Dante went on, eyes flicking toward the white door as if it might be listening. “Not officially. No flag, no anthem, no oversight. Just contracts. They move in shadows, under the skin of the world. They find things that shouldn’t exist—things like Evergrove Market—and they make sure no one ever sees them. Not alive, anyway.”

My stomach knotted. “Destroy them?” I asked.

His jaw tightened. “Contain, observe, study, sometimes destroy. Whatever keeps the rest of the world from collapsing. They’ve got labs buried under deserts, rigs on ice shelves, even floating platforms in the middle of nowhere. If it bends reality, ESR has a cage for it.”

I almost laughed, but the sound caught in my throat. “And you? You’re one of their clean-up crew?”

Dante shook his head, a small, bitter smile tugging at his mouth. “I was supposed to be your anchor, Remi. Someone to keep you alive long enough for ESR to decide if you were… salvageable.”

The word chilled me. Salvageable. Like I wasn’t a person, just another piece of evidence bagged and tagged.

My pulse hammered as the pieces clicked into place—the vans, the soldiers, the nurse who wasn’t really a nurse. “So that’s it? I’m just… an anomaly now? Something for your company to poke and prod?”

Dante’s gaze softened, but it didn’t erase the steel beneath it. “You’re not a specimen to me. But to them? You’ve been on their ledger since the night you first walked into Evergrove.”

The words landed like a stone in my chest. Ledger. Like I’d been a name in a file all along.

My throat scraped raw. “So tell me the truth, Dante. Did you save me because you cared—or because they told you to?”

His jaw worked, but he didn’t answer right away. He leaned forward, elbows on his knees, staring at the floor like it might hand him a script. “Both,” he admitted finally. His voice was quiet, tired. “At first, it was orders. I was there to observe you, make sure you survived long enough to serve ESR’s purpose. But…” His eyes flicked up, catching mine. For a moment, they softened, almost breaking through the steel. “You weren’t just another anomaly to me, Remi. Not after everything.”

I wanted to believe him. I wanted to let those words sink in and stitch the wound he’d left. But my anger wouldn’t let me. “And Evergrove? What the hell even was it? A trap? A breeding ground? Why did it exist at all?”

Dante exhaled sharply, running a hand through his hair. “Evergrove wasn’t a store. It was… architecture. A construct. ESR’s been tracking it for decades—it appears, it anchors itself to a town, and then it feeds. The Night Manager was just one mask it wore. Nobody builds Evergrove. It builds itself.”

I froze. The words scraped against my mind like glass. “So all those rules, all those shifts, the ledger, Selene, Stacy, what happened to them?”

He shook his head. “We dont know but ESR thinks Evergrove tests people. Breaks them down. Promises power in exchange for pieces of yourself. And if you last long enough… it starts making you part of its design. The suit we removed from you—that was the last active part of Evergrove. The rest… it’s gone. Burned, destroyed, finished.”

I blinked, trying to reconcile the lingering emptiness inside me. “But… some of it still feels… inside me. Like it never really left.”

He gave me a small, almost weary smile. “You’re not wrong. Some pieces—the smallest threads, parts you can’t see—are still woven into you. But it’s fine. I’ve spoken to ESR. They’ve assured me—you’re in no danger. You won’t be harmed. Nothing Evergrove left behind can hurt you now.”

I swallowed, unsure whether to feel relief or suspicion. “And you believe them?”

“I do,” he said firmly, locking eyes with me. “Because you survived. Because you’re stronger than it ever expected. And because I trust you.”

The words lingered, warm against the cold edges of my fear. I let out a shaky breath, closing my eyes. The fragments didn’t scream. They didn’t bite. They lingered in the corners of my mind like faint shadows, reminders of everything I’d survived. For a heartbeat, that was enough to make me feel… almost strong.

But the calm didn’t last. The room felt smaller all of a sudden, the white walls pressing in. I swallowed hard, my throat dry, and forced the words out.

“Where am I right now?”

Dante’s gaze flicked briefly past me, never meeting my eyes. His voice was flat, measured. “The headquarters. Observation room. Normally it’s for anomalies… but we were observing… you.” He gestured toward the black-and-white painting across from the bed, as if it explained everything without him needing to look at me. “Cameras everywhere. Every angle.”

I felt my chest tighten. “When… when can I leave?”

Dante’s shoulders stiffened. He finally glanced down at the floor, voice quiet, careful. “I’m… sorry, Remi. I had to do this to save you. The cost… is staying here. Once someone knows about the organization, they can’t leave.”

The weight of his words sank into me like ice. My fragments, my suit, my nights in Evergrove—it all led to this. And now, there was no going back.

“There must be a way!” I screamed, my voice cracking, echoing off the sterile walls. “I cannot be stuck here! It’s not fair—I survived, right, Dante? I—”

Dante didn’t look at me. His eyes remained fixed somewhere past the corner of the room, as if my words were nothing more than background noise. His jaw tensed. “You… survived,” he said slowly, each word deliberate. “But surviving doesn’t mean… freedom.”

I felt my stomach twist. “But I fought… I destroyed Evergrove! I—”

He finally shifted his weight, still avoiding my gaze. “I know what you did,” he murmured, almost to himself. “I know. And you… you’re alive. That was the point. But some things… once they’re seen… can’t be unseen.”

My chest heaved. My hands trembled. “So I’m… trapped?”

Dante’s voice softened slightly, almost imperceptibly, but still not meeting my eyes. “Trapped… isn’t the word I’d use. Protected. Observed. Kept safe.”

I wanted to scream again, to fight, to tear at the walls, but his calm, controlled tone… it made the room feel heavier, suffocating, inescapable.

I stared at him, my chest tightening. “No… I can’t,” I whispered, my voice cracking. “I can’t be trapped here… I survived! Dante, I survived! It’s not fair!”

He didn’t flinch, didn’t even glance at me. “I know,” he said quietly, voice steady, almost too calm. “I wish it were different. I wish there was another way. But there isn’t.”

I shook my head, backing away from the bed, my hands trembling. “There has to be! There has to be some way out of this—some way to leave!”

Dante finally turned his head just slightly, the faintest trace of something like regret crossing his face. “There’s another way,” he said carefully, almost as if admitting it in a whisper would make it vanish. “But it comes at a cost. You… you have to work for them.”

I felt the air leave my lungs. “What… what do you mean?”

“Like me,” he said, voice low, almost protective. “You join ESR. You help them. You survive… and maybe, in time, you get some freedom. But if you refuse…” His words hung in the air, unfinished, but the weight was clear.

I sank to my knees, almost crying. “Anything… anything is fine. I just… I can’t be trapped anymore. I can’t.”

Dante’s hand extended, patient, unwavering. “Then this is your choice, Remi. But know this: working… it’s not surrender. It’s survival.”

I swallowed hard, staring at his outstretched hand—the same hand that had pulled me through Evergrove’s hell, the same hand that now felt like the only solid thing left in my world. Dante had been my ally, my friend, my tether through the chaos. The fragments of everything I had endured—the suit, the Night Manager, the endless hunger—still pulsed at the edges of my thoughts, whispering doubt. But against all of that, there was him.

I placed my hand in his. His grip was warm, steady, and real.

“We’ll see each other soon,” Dante said, his grin softer this time, almost reassuring. “You made the right choice.”

“Are you sure about this, Dante?” My voice cracked despite myself.

He finally looked me in the eye, and for the first time since I’d woken up, I felt the weight lift, just a little. “How do you think I started working for them, Remi? I was like you once. And trust me… working with them is better than being observed.”

He squeezed my hand once before letting go, the gesture lingering longer than his words. At the door, he glanced back, offering a smile that felt genuine, not rehearsed. “I’ll tell you my story another day. For now… rest. You’ve earned it.”

The door closed gently behind him, leaving me with silence—but not the same crushing silence as before. For the first time since Evergrove, it felt like maybe I wasn’t alone.

Sleep came easily after that. Too easily. But then again, it always had, even when I was working those cursed night shifts. Back then, it felt like exhaustion dragging me under. This time, it was different—deeper, heavier, like the silence itself was pulling me into it.

When I finally opened my eyes again, thirteen hours had passed. My body didn’t ache the way it should’ve after so long. Instead, I felt… sharper. Rested in a way that was unnatural, almost inhuman.

I noticed the change this morning. Just a paper cut—barely a nick on my finger from the corner of a file. But I watched it close. Not over hours, not even minutes. Instantly. The skin sealed, smooth and perfect, as though the cut had never been there.

For a long moment, I just stared, my stomach hollow and my throat dry, but not a hint of hunger gnawing at me. A shiver ran through me.

When the nurse came in, I held up my hand. “Did you see that? Did you see what just happened?”

Her expression didn’t flicker. No confusion, no interest—just that same calm, mechanical presence she carried with her at all times. She set the bandage she’d already unwrapped back on the tray, then pressed cool fingers to my wrist, checking my pulse.

“Vitals stable,” she said softly, almost like a recording. Then she turned away, scribbled something on her clipboard, and continued her routine as though nothing had happened.

I wanted to press her, demand an answer, but the words caught in my throat. Because deep down, I already knew. This wasn’t healing. Not really.

This was the store—still inside me. “Your evaluation will start tomorrow,” the nurse said, the word slipping out with that same rehearsed evenness.

“What’s that mean?” I asked, desperate for something concrete—an explanation, a schedule, anything.

She didn’t look up. No hesitation, no extra syllable. Just the clipboard, the practiced motion of someone who had said the same line a thousand times. No answer came.

Tomorrow arrived with a kind of stretched-out slowness—days that crawl when there’s nothing to do but sip water and wait. My throat eased a fraction each day; the dryness that had haunted me was receding like a tide. At noon I drank again and watched the black-and-white painting across from my bed, hunting for the little camera Dante had mentioned. Time folded in on itself until the door opened.

This time five black-clad soldiers filled the doorway, silent as a shadow. Behind them moved a man who put every vampire cliché to shame—jet-black hair, a jaw carved like a statue—but as he took the chair Dante had occupied the day before, I realized “vampire” wasn’t it at all. His skin was almost translucent, veins like faint maps under glass. He smiled without moving his mouth, eyes scanning the room like a lens and when he turned toward me the air seemed to tighten.

“Good,” he said—his voice measured, clinical, like someone reading from a file and savoring the facts. It slid across the room and landed on me. “We’ll begin your evaluation.”

“Evaluation?” I asked, my voice sharper than I intended.

He didn’t answer. Instead, he reached into the folder tucked under his arm and dropped it onto the table beside my bed. The sound was louder than it should’ve been in the white silence of the room.

“Prove yourself if you want to work for us,” he said. His eyes gleamed, too pale to be human. “And learn everything. You’ll need it tomorrow.”

My hand hovered over the folder, heavy as a cinder block. It wasn’t thick—ten pages at most—but five of them bristled with colored tabs, marked for me like landmines waiting to be stepped on.

Before I could speak again, he rose to his feet, movements precise and fluid, and leaned toward one of the soldiers. His whisper was faint, but the soldier’s reply carried across the room:

“Yes, Sir Roth.”

The name snapped through me like ice water. Roth. The same man who had ordered me into observation.

Then, just like that, they were gone—the pale man, the soldiers, the hum of authority they carried with them. The door clicked shut, leaving me alone with the folder.

I sat there for what felt like hours, staring at it, trying to process everything. My chest was tight, my throat dry again. Finally, I forced myself to open it.

Two hours. That’s how long it took to force every detail into my head, to absorb words that didn’t feel written for human eyes. 



**Mission 1034576 – Anubis: Eater of tours**



Access: Field Personnel — Level B

Window: \[REDACTED — see secure calendar\]

Theater: Subsurface complex below Giza Plateau



**Mission Snapshot**

Reports of multiple disappearances around the Great Pyramid prompted ESR to investigate. Seismic and electromagnetic anomalies suggest a persistent, non-natural source beneath the pyramid. Your team’s mission is to locate the anomalous core, secure the area, and attempt live containment. If capture is impossible, deny the anomaly access to the surface and protect civilian populations.

**Entity Behavioral Notes**

1. Subject exhibits god-like characteristics, including near-omniscient awareness of personnel movements with auditory and visual detection beyond normal human range.
2. Victims display intense obedience prior to disappearance—refusal to comply is often met with immediate psychological or physical enforcement.
3. Direct exposure carries significant risk: extreme physiological and psychological effects have been documented, including accelerated compliance, hallucinations, and loss of control.

**Primary Objectives (ranked)**

1. Insert through pre-approved access point and secure a 50 m perimeter around the identified entry chamber.
2. Map the immediate subterranean area and locate the anomalous core.
3. Attempt non-lethal containment and secure anomalous artifacts for transport.
4. If containment fails, execute authorized suppression and extraction procedures to minimize civilian exposure.

**Secondary Objectives**

1. Recover victim remains for identification and forensic analysis.
2. Document and confiscate illicit excavation gear and logs.
3. Install a temporary remote monitoring beacon if containment is achieved.

**Timeline (High Level)**

H-12: Team brief, equipment check, rules of engagement review.

H-2: Insertion to staging point near Pyramid service shaft.

H: Entry and active mapping

H+2–6: Containment attempt / tactical decision window.

H+6–12: Extraction or escalation (based on Commander decision).



The rest of the file was worse—page after page of black bars and hollow gaps where meaning should’ve been. What little remained spoke of containment procedures, of the entity’s confirmed hostility… but also of something stranger. "**Open for negotiation**". The words stuck to me like lightning.

Negotiate—with a thing that can control people? That can be considered a god?

But there was nothing more. Ninety percent of the text was gone, thick black ink smothering whatever truth the paper once carried. What I was left with felt less like a briefing and more like a threat: You know just enough to step into the dark, but not enough to see what’s waiting there.

I flipped the last page, hoping for clarity, but instead found a single unredacted line, printed in bold:

"Do not break eye contact."

That was it. No context. No explanation.

My pulse quickened. I could hear the tick of the white clock on the wall, slow and deliberate, like it was counting down. I closed the file, pressing the papers to my lap, and that’s when I noticed—at the bottom corner of the last page—one handwritten note scrawled in a different ink. The letters were jagged, rushed, like someone had written it in fear:

"I CANT STOP"
