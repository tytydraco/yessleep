Hey guys, I’m back with my update. I’d like to make it known that this is not a recent event that has happened in my life and is just an experience I am finally ready to share.  
  
I think some of you will find that the remainder of the story will answer most of your questions, but for the rest I’d like to add that I did not mean to be so dismissive over my husbands concerns and thoughts, I felt insulted by what I was being told. Imagine being a newly happy mother and suddenly your husband starts calling the child you birthed a monster. Of course that hurt me, and as for questions about having him evaluated, I have tried speaking to him about it, considering even though it hasn’t affected family at all, it could still possibly catch up to him. Instead he yelled at me and told me he wasn’t seeing things and that our daughter was a monster.  
  
Lastly I have had some concerns about my daughters name, her name is a shade of green, which is one of my favorite colors. I adore unique names and thought this was the perfect name for my daughter, now that I have addressed some of the concerns, below you will find the remainder of my experience.  
  
The next few weeks, my husband began to act stranger than usual, Viridian was crawling like she usually did but this time she made cute little squeals when she laughed or was happy. My husband practically feared her, like as if she was a monster from out of this world, and anytime she would crawl to him or clap or even tried to give him affection, he would almost scream with fear. What I found most odd was how quietly she would watch him and just stare. Sometimes she would even try to get closer, almost like as if she was purposely provoking him.  
  
I’ll admit they were both acting quite strange and I was even starting to consider that maybe my husband was not crazy, but there was nothing I could do to really convince myself that our daughter was the problem, and on top of that he refused to get evaluated. I felt uneasy around my husband, like I had to walk on eggshells, I started sleeping in our nursery to make sure our daughter was safe. I tried talking to my husband about his behavior and that he was scaring me and our daughter.  
  
“That thing is not our daughter!” What he said stung but I said nothing, and walked away, attending to Viridian. One day my husband finally came to his senses and began to act normal, holding our little girl, playing with her and even feeding her himself. I finally felt at ease and after a few days of him progressing like this, I was able to finally sleep in our bedroom. I decided it was best to not question is behavior towards Viridian over the past few weeks in fear that I might bring something up again. I fell sound asleep until I had to wake up to the sound of our daughter screaming her lungs out, I quickly jump out of bed and run to her nursery but she wasn’t there. I ran to my room to grab my husband but he wasn’t there either, my heart completely sank to my stomach. I rushed downstairs as fast as I could and there he was, in the kitchen with my daughter laying on the counter and a knife in his hand.   
  
“Honey,” I spoke softly, careful not to provoke him as every bone in my body was ready to attack him, “Listen to me, you don’t want to do this.”   
  
“If I don’t she’s going to kill us, you don’t understand, don’t you see the shadows surrounding us? She brought them here!” I looked but it was just us in the dark and my daughter shining under the moonlight, crying and screaming.   
  
“There’s nothing there,” I said softly, inching towards him, “Look at me, let me help you, I think you might need some help and I think we can get you what you need! You just have to listen to me.” I watched as he just stared at me, he looked so tired and drained, a voice of reason is something he wanted but didn’t feel he needed.   
  
“No, no I don’t need the help, it’s you! How do you not see it!” He slammed the knife next to Viridian, I almost screamed, my heart was pounding in my ears and I was still walking very slowly towards them until I was finally across from him with our daughter in between us, “She’s going to hurt us both if we don’t kill her.” He said quietly, he began to point the knife at me instead, “What if she already replaced you? She’s infected you, you have the same ooze coming out of your eyes like her!”  
  
“Honey, you need to listen to me, things have gotten worse this past month, I want to help you but you need to let me.” I tried to reach for the vase slowly that was above Viridians head, my plan was to smash it over his head. Everything grew completely silent and the next moments became a blur. Aaron grabbed the knife and was ready to stab my daughter, but I quickly grabbed her and pulled her out of the way, clutching her in my arm and using the other to smash the vase over his head and then I run out the door.   
  
Aaron screamed in pain and I’m sure he was darting towards us and I screamed for help, our neighbors lights started to turn on and once a door was seen barely opened I rushed towards the house and begged them to help me and my baby. Aaron was gaining onto us and the woman pulled us inside, slamming the door and locking it completely shut. He banged on the door screaming my name telling me he had to kill my baby. The woman called the police and they came in less than 5 minutes, arresting Aaron and taking statements. He was halfway through smashing a window just kill my daughter.  
  
This all happened a few years ago and he was sent to the psych ward, where he was diagnosed with severe schizophrenia. He was not allowed visitors since he would constantly just get triggered and try to convince them to come after my baby. Viridian is now 3 years old, walking and even using her words much better. I moved on from Aaron, as he was never getting better and never progressed even with medication. What I found odd was that he has had one family member who has had schizophrenia from his mother’s side however, it was his 4x great grandmother and it had never happened to anyone else since. He has also never had any symptoms in his entire life nor has he ever been treated for it. My current fiancé is mentally healthy and has been treating my daughter and I so well, though recently he has been acting strange around my daughter.
