I didn’t turn around.

The hand on my shoulder was light—almost polite. But the scent was unmistakable. Bubble bath. Thick. Floral. Synthetic. It clung to the air like a warning.

“Fancy seeing you here,” he repeated, voice low, almost amused.

I turned slowly. Mr Sgáil stood before me, no longer in his waistcoat. This time, he wore a black pinstripe suit—sharp, tailored, but off-kilter. The shirt beneath was a burnt orange, the kind you’d see in Balkan sunsets or rusted shipping containers. And the tie… it was the one I’d seen in my wardrobe years ago but never dared wear. Black, dark orange, dark gold. Diamond checkered. Regal and venomous.

“You changed,” I said.

He smiled. “We all do, eventually.”

Behind him, the Range Rover gleamed in the tunnel’s dim light. Its license plate was smeared with mud, but I caught the faint outline of a diplomatic crest. Not British. Not recent.

“You want answers,” he said. “I’ll give you some. But not all.”

We walked deeper into the tunnel. Past the cells. Past the children. Some stirred. Most didn’t. Their eyes were vacant, but their clothes weren’t. Branded hoodies. Charity logos. One wore a shirt from a Glasgow youth outreach program I’d donated to last winter.

“You gave money to some of these,” Sgáil said, reading my face. “They’re fronts. Not all. But enough. You’d be surprised how many charities are desperate for funding. Desperate people make excellent partners.”

I stopped walking. “What are they used for?”

He didn’t flinch. “Depends. Some are sold. Some are trained. Some are filmed. Some are harvested. The royals prefer variety. Keeps things… unpredictable.”

I felt sick. “And you?”

“I facilitate,” he said. “Not for them. Not anymore. I have my own clients now. Eastern ones. Wealthy. Curious. Less sentimental.”

We reached a steel door. He tapped a code into the panel. It hissed open.

Inside: maps. Weapons. Documents. A wall of photographs—children, politicians, aid workers, soldiers. And in the center, a faded image of Sgáil himself. Younger. Thinner. Wearing a Yugoslav military jacket.

“I started small,” he said. “Trafficking between Glasgow and the Balkans. Cigarettes. Girls. Cheap pills. Then the war came. I was caught in Sarajevo. Wrong place, wrong accent. They threw me into a paramilitary unit. No training. Just orders.”

He lit a cigarette. The smoke curled around his tie like a serpent.

“I learned fast. How to move guns. How to bury bodies. How to speak without speaking. When the war ended, I kept the contacts. Started my own group. Guns first. Then drugs. Then people. The leftovers of war are always the most profitable.”

I stared at the wall. One photo showed a familiar face—my army friend. The one who’d invited me to Balmoral.

“He’s one of yours?”

Sgáil shook his head. “He’s one of theirs. But he owes me. They all do.”

I stepped back. “Why tell me this?”

“Because you’re useful,” he said. “You’re clean. You’re respected. You’re an engineer. You build things. I destroy them. But sometimes, I need a builder.”

He handed me a folder. Inside: blueprints. A new facility. Underground. Remote. Designed for “rehabilitation.” But the specs told a different story—reinforced cells, surveillance systems, soundproofing.

“You’ll say no,” he said. “But you’ll think about it. Because once you’ve seen this place, you’re part of it. And they’ll come for you eventually. Better to be useful.”

I dropped the folder. “I won’t help you.”

He smiled again. “You already have.”

He turned and walked back toward the Range Rover. The bubble bath scent lingered, even after he was gone.

I stood alone in the tunnel, surrounded by silence, cells, and the weight of complicity.

Above me, Balmoral glittered with laughter and champagne.

Below, the pyramid pulsed with secrets.

And somewhere in between, I stood—no longer just an engineer, but a witness.
