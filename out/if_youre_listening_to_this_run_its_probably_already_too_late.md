 

Hel.. hello, this is a warning, or manual for anyone listening to this. I believe you found this tape next to my corpse. I believe there is no time to get to know each other, it is enough for you to know that there were seven of us. Our captain is long gone, probably dead so I hope no one manages or has to listen to this, and we go down.

We've been here for about three... three months. We were there to do research. There were four of us researchers, two on deck and me with... Jack the medic, below, three technicians on board Captain Gustav, Cook "Swift" and a communications technician whose name I don't know. One of the scientists from the surface was the first to go, he and Gary was in charge of setting up and maintaining the radar, launching probes, and collecting samples and all that kind of shit. He went to light a cigar late at night, and... he didn't come back. The next morning we noticed he was gone, we thought he was remained in the room. We found his body only after the communications technician had disappeared as well. The terrible stench gave us an indication that something was wrong. Their... their bodies... were completely butchered. Both had their guts open and their entrails were scattered... all over them, one's face was completely screwed up, one of his eyes was missing, his blood mixed with pieces of his brain and fragments of skull and teeth, and... I couldn't take it all. I threw up and staggered out of the room. The autopsy showed that both of them had missing livers, both of them died of loss of blood Fear took over the ship, n we were sure who, what and why did this.

Allegations surfaced very soon. Later me and Jack were talking in the room. We knew he and I couldn't do it, and neither could the captain. Only Gary or... fast could have done that. It dawned on us both. Gary could have killed the other scientist, but he almost never got off the deck, while Swift... he knew the ship, and he's the only one without an alibi. We left the room and went to see Gary, to figure out what to do. Gary wants to kill him and Jack wants to trap him in a room. I decided to listen to Jack and call for help later. For God's sake, we're scientists, I guess we can call for help through the communication system.

The three of us crept up in the dead of night. Swift was already asleep, so it was easy to catch him. Jack tied his legs, I tied his hands and Gary was there if anything went wrong. I... I failed and Swift woke up. Gary grabbed the plate from the table and interrupted Swifts screaming. Blood gushed across the room. Jack hurriedly checked to see if he was still alive. I finally relaxed after he announced that Quick had a pulse. We took him to his room, locked it and barricaded it. After a few minutes of uncomfortable silence, we set out to inform the others what happened. Jack and I went, while Gary stayed behind to watch the prisoner. We made our way through the corridor, but were interrupted by... strange noises from the captain's room. The door was ajar, we... entered the room and... it... killed the captain. Blood was covering the control panel, and that... was still tearing at the captain, who was choking on his own blood. His weak twitches were... almost as disturbing as the sight itself... he was... still alive. Me and Jack slowly walked away from the room. Faster and faster we moved towards Gary. Somehow, the thing noticed us. Maybe it heard our footsteps, maybe it smelled us, I'm not sure. We were already running then, but it wasn't enough. It caught Jack. I was terrified, my eyes narrowed, but I didn't turn around. I moved closer to Gary and Swift, thinking that I had... eluded him.

Gary noticed me and yelled at me, asking why I was running. I ran into my room, knocked over the closet, and locked the door. Looks like it found my hideout. It had already killed Gary, the last thing I heard from him was a loud pounding on the door, hysterical screams to let me in that turned into screams for help, followed by the sound of flesh and skin tearing. Just me and Swift left, I don't know for how long. I'm not sure if they'll be able to break down the door, but either that thing or hunger and thirst will kill me.

If you listen to this, it means that you are in great danger. I hope you found the ship at sea and not stranded somewhere on land. I do...I don't know where it came from, from space, the depths of the ocean, or is it some kind of demon This creature is obviously very fucking smart, it... i... very dar... colored... almo... blac... and st... strong... if you're listening to this... run. .. it's probably... already too
