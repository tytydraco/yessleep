**I woke up this morning to several texts from my older sister. We argued a couple months ago, and hadn’t spoken since. Here’s the transcript of the messages :**  
  
  
I’m not sure if this message will go through, but I need to try. Even if you never read this I have to keep busy, I have to stare at something that isn’t the woods or the road or the fields, I need to keep my eyes down until They come. Maybe They won’t see me you know, maybe They’re like the t-rex in Jurassic Park and They won’t see me if I don’t move. I have to try, I have to hope, even if it seems pointless.

I’m sorry I said the divorce was your fault Becky. I see now that it wasn’t. You had no choice did you? Just like I don’t have a choice now. I’m sorry Becky. I wish our childhood was better. I wish I was better, a better sister, a better daughter, a better friend. I wish I’d fucking believed you when you told me about Them. When you came up to me all scared and distraught and said you’d seen something in the garden. When you woke up crying at night and refused to go back to sleep until the whole family was accounted for. I’m sorry I dismissed you, made fun of you, snapped at you. I never told you, did I? How I used to tell my friends about your “night terrors” and laugh. How frustrated I was that you were hogging all of our parents’ attention while I was sneaking out smoking and drinking and they never gave a fuck. I’m sorry Becky. I was never the big sister you deserved. I sbdhvjdvfdl;

Sorry about that. I heard some rustling in the woods behind me and got spooked. Bit too late for that but apparently I still can’t help it. Guess it was just the wind, but we both know it may well not be. There’s no way to know. In case They get me Becky and in case these messages go through I should tell you, I’m sitting by the side of the road, you know the one. Facing towards the fields, my back to the woods. It’s funny, isn’t it? I was always more scared of the woods than the fields. You were the opposite. I didn’t change much I guess. Returned to our old house and still more afraid to look between the trees than towards the hills. So much for confronting old childhood trauma. But yeah, when They get me, if you ever want to find my body, that’s a starting point.  
  
I’m too tired to keep running Becky. I’m sorry. Not just for being a shitty big sister, but for being so fucking dumb as to come back here. I don’t even know what I wanted to prove. That your nightmares were in fact just that? That I was right all these years and you had an active imagination? I don’t think so, honestly. I think, I really think I knew exactly what I’d find when I’d come back. I wanted to see Them. I wanted to find Them. And I wanted to die.

Yeah that was fucking dramatic, and it would have been some great timing if They’d caught me just as I sent that, but They still haven’t, and I’m still too scared to look up from the phone so I’ll keep rambling here. Some part of me wishes for you to get those texts, but I do hope you never do. I can pour my heart out and clear my conscience or whatever, and you can still live your life peacefully without knowing for sure that They were real. It was selfish of me to come back Becky. I acknowledge that. But as I’ve already established the worst track record possible for being a good older sister, I don’t think you’ll be surprised.  
  
Just so you know, I was never jealous of you. I’ve always been happy for you, your successes, your great relationship with Mark. But the bitterness built up over the years. You were the crazy one as a child, but now you’ve accomplished way more with your life than I have, and I’m seven years older. If a stranger was to guess who spent time in a psychiatric facility as a child just looking at our adult selves, they would not hesitate to pick me.  
  
So yeah, Becky. I’m happy for you, I’m fucking proud of you, I truly am, but I am also resentful. Mostly against myself you know. For fucking up. For being as fine as I could be given the circumstances as a child and waiting until now to have my life fall apart. I didn’t even tell you Steph left me. I didn’t even tell you I lost our child. I was too ashamed to do so, but that doesn’t fucking matter now does it? Because you were right, all those years you were right, and I had to wait until I was 35 to finally make sure you weren’t crazy. I failed you just like I failed everyone else, and I’m sorry. I am trying to make it right though. I don’t know if guns can hurt them, but I will try. I’ve got holy water with me as well, which is ironic I know, and stones and herbs a witchy friend prepared for me. I won’t go down without a fight, without making those bastards pay for taking away your childhood and destroying our family.

Well, I pressed send as I heard footsteps behind me, but of course there was no one there when I found the courage to turn around. It’s like I’m waiting at the bus stop, and the bus is running late, and I end up waiting for so long I figure I could have walked home in the meantime, but at the same time the bus is bound to arrive any second now and why risk walking? I’m rambling, I know. I told you, just need to keep busy until They come. I think my ankle is broken anyway, so I can’t walk, even if the bus never comes. Ha.

I’ve spent all night reliving our childhood. My childhood rather, since we’ve had radically different experiences. I keep trying to recall every single mention you made of Them. That time you were insisting our cat was gone and something evil replaced it? And I gave you shit for it, because of course all cats are evil so that was no big deal, Mr Fluffington had just run away and you were still processing the emotional rollercoaster of losing your cat and finding him again? Do you remember that, Becky? When I woke up covered in scratches even though the cat was not allowed in our room, and you freaked out, and I shrugged it off?  
  
I saw Mr Fluffington at the house Becky. You were right. Cats don’t live that long, but that wasn’t a cat.  
  
I almost didn’t recognise our pet, he was bigger than I was, just massive darkness enveloping the garden, two white dots serving as eyes but no light reflected in them, teeth - massive, long, sharp, too many of them, dragging into the dirt, seemingly going in all directions, he was nothing but darkness and teeth and those fucking eyes - but when I started backing out towards the gate, you know what the fucker did? It meowed, Becky, it fucking meowed, and I knew in that moment that you were right two decades ago, that wasn’t our cat, that was something dark, evil, ancient, and it was feeling playful. It meowed, and it grinned, and I thought I was going to die right there and then, but I found the gate and that’s when I started running towards the road, until I tripped - you’d laugh if you’d seen me, I slipped on my own puke, from when I first saw the house again, I’d forgotten about it by the time I fled the garden, and I slipped, and fell, and I heard the bone snap, so I hopped towards the side of the road to sit on the stone where we used to watch the sunset, because that made me feel like you were with me and I couldn’t bear to be alone.  
  
That’s why I’m typing on my phone right now, typing those rambling messages. I miss you Becky, and I love you. I’m so sorry.

**To say my blood ran cold is an understatement. Years of repressed memories flooded back, memories of that cursed house I vowed never to set foot in again, memories of my parents' exhausted faces as they left me with the doctors, memories of my sister's tears when I returned to a broken family, memories of Them.**  
  
**I did my best to get dressed and immediately go to the station. I am now on the train to our childhood town, fighting back tears, trying to get my thoughts in order. I am severely unprepared for what’s to come, for what I will find back at the old house, but it doesn’t matter.**  
  
**My sister went home, and I need to get her back if I still can.**
