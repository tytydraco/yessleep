**I was gonna break into the hospital to find her blood**

\--------------------------

**November 2nd, 2010.**

***12:36 AM.***

*I finally arrived*, i'm at the hospital, but I hope they **wouldn't** recognize my car. 

I felt as if my father was gonna kill me. 

I felt like my life ended. But, I didn't care. I wanted the stupid Boogeyman to suffer, so I got out of my car, and went inside wearing a mask and a hoodie, I went to the reception, and said I needed to see someone urgently, she asked me who I was.

I thought for a second, before making a *run for it.* I was running through the hospital pushing with my might to ignore my broken leg, slamming through doors and  equipment looking for my wife's room. Then, I found her room, I knew it because I saw my father inside. while she was gone.

"Is this man *crazy?* I thought to myself." but I went on inside. I opened the door and told him "Hey I need a blood sample for this patient." I knew they kept them, because she must have been bleeding a ton and they could use that for other things.

He responded, "**Who are you???"** I went over to the desk without asking, and picked up all the trays. Then our eyes **locked in with each other.** He recognized me, and I felt shivers down my spine because I could see how angry he was, not even her own father was this mad. then, I **RAN FOR MY LIFE!** and he ran for *my life*. He was shouting stuff I couldn't even make out, he was so mad he was speaking *gibberish.* I saw the door, the door of light, the door of freedom. I mean, the **hospital exit. and I ran in what felt like slow motion, everything was so slow, then, I BASHED into the** *hospital exit.* I was now outside, a huge gust of wind hit me, like telling me to go *avenge my wife.* and I opened the car as fast as I could and locked it, I turned the key to turn the engine on, *it wasn't budging though. My father* started banging on the window and got a hammer out of his pocket, JESUS what was he planning to do to me with that hammer anyways, **and as he aimed it for the window,** ***\*engine turns on\**** *and I stomped on the gas with all my might and it took off.* Woohooooo! I had my wife's blood samples, time to end this shit.

**2:46 AM**

I'm safe now. I parked on an isolated road next to the woods, and I hopped into the woods with my wife's blood, I found an abandoned cabin, it looked really old. so I hopped on there and, it was..... *Unlocked!* so I went in, the light switch was next to me so I flipped it and, the lights still worked.. woohoo? this means someone could be living here, but I was determined to do this "ritual" I opened the blood tubes and I spilled them all over, spelling a cross with her blood. and then, the lights turned off. 

Just then, I felt true fear for the first time. I came to realize this was a supernatural entity we're talking about here but, they began to flicker, the lights, turning *on* and *off.* Then I heard a wail, from him, the Boogeyman. the one who killed my wife. and the blood flew everywhere, the floor boards fell down, forming a cross, then... BOOM! **The boogeyman has arrived.** he was in front of me, an eerie wide grin on his face. I wanted to wipe that grin off his face, so he turned off the lights. Now, it was *pitch black.* I got a lighter from the TV stand on my right, and I hopped outside, I opened my car trunk, and pulled out one of my spare gas cans. It was also pitch black outside, and he followed me out. I spilled gas on my car, and went in. I was willing to burn myself to death, I knew, the second I turn the engine on all would be fire, so I picked up a flashlight and shined it through the windshield, and I saw him right infront of me, I turned on the engine... **FIRE! FIRE EVERYWHERE.** and I shielded my eyes, and opened the car door and ran out. I hopped into the dark woods, holding my flashlight, and I didn't see him there... did he die? or run away? I would never know...

**12 Years later.**

**October 31st, 2022.**

I escaped the country by a boat 12 years ago. I was wanted in all states. I sailed to Mexico, and changed my name. then, i took a plane to *Cyprus.* I've been living here for 12 years. Nobody knows who I am. 

But today, I have a new beautiful wife, and three kids who are the light of my life.

Piece of advice, never live in Rienzi, Mississippi.

But today, **something** happened. It was night, I was terrified of celebrating halloween again, but tonight, something happened. The sky turned *red.* I ran to tell my wife and kids, I opened the kids room, but they were all missing, only blood was left. 

Then, I ***realized.***

***The curse followed me here.***
