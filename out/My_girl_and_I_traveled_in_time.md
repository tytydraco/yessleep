 Hi, I'm Victor, and My Girl is Caterine, and we had a very disturbing adventure a while ago. 

 So, for context, I live in Japan, and she lives in the Europe, sometimes she comes to visit me, and sometimes I go visit her, it's usually one time in the year. We really wanna live together, but we are just waiting for our unis to finish so we can get a proper job. 

 This time, she was coming to Japan to see me, I was just chilling at my house at the time, and she called me saying that she was close, and then I brushed my hair and changed clothes to see her, I was with a jeans jacket with my pocket sketchbook and phone in it, then she called me. We started smilling to each other in the video call, and she said that she was already walking up the stairs to see me, so I said I was going to walk down the stairs to kiss her, so we both were walking the stairs with out smartphones on hand.

 But, I walked all the way down and didn't see her, while she walked all the way up to my front door, and didn't see me, weird, I aksed if she didn't enter the other building instead of mine, and no, she was exactly at my front door on her camera. So I just ran back up to my house to meet her.

 We hugged and kissed and she was carring her big backpack in her bag, I took it from her and opened the door so she could walk in, she as cute as always walked in smilling, but something felt off, my house was off somehow, but I didn't notice anything strange, just felt off. Later remembering it, when we came to my room, I saw a big mirror reflecting the corner of the room, this mirror wasn't there before, but I didn't feel weird about it at first, it was just unerving.   
  
 My girlfriend was cuddling with me at my bed, then she said she wanted to drink some water, so she went to take it. I was in my room while I head she talking to herself, like I was there with her, but I was dissociating a bit because of the mirror, everything was so weird, I started to feel eerie about everything, it was like I was loosing trust in my senses, and what the heck was that mirror doing in my room? Whose voice was that in the kitchen with her? I just stood up, took my jacket and walked at her.  
  
 "There is something wrong happening, we need to leave. Now." She looked confused at me and asked "What u talking about, silly?" And I answered very serious "We really need to leave, there is something strange happening here.".   
  
 She was still confused, and I don't blame her, but she started picking her stuff up. I put on my shoes and holded the door to her on my way out, and while she was putting on her shoes, I could see the mirror from my point of view, it was still pointing at the corner of the room, but there was nothing there, while she was finishing putting on her shoe, from the mirror I saw her peek at me, smile, and wave, and vanished again in the mirror. 

It was terrifying, it was exactly her in the mirror, but it didn't make any sense, I looked at her and she saw my face. "What did you see?" she asked me, starting to get a little scared. "I saw you in the mirror, smiling at me while we leave." She knew I was being serious, I closed the door behind us, and we started walking down the stairs of the building, while I was leaving, I noticed that the lights from the building were a little pinkier, just a small detail, the white light was slightly pinkier.

 She didn't really ask, or talked to me while we were walking away from the building, until we reached the usual streets and a small park that had around where I lived.

  
"You ok?" I asked. "Yeah, what happend? You was just in the kitchen with me, and then we where leaving the house. This is not funny, you're scaring the shit out of me." She was getting upset, and I noticed that she was sweating a little, I don't know why but it was hot outside, like really hot. I cleaned her forehead and explained everything to her, while we were sitting in the park under a tree.

  
 We started noticing kids wearing towels arond their necks, something that is usual especially in summer in Japan, tank tops, shorts and towels, and then Catie( little cutie nickname) took of her jacket. "What do we do now?" she asked. I just didn't now what to say, was it all real? I took my phone to see the temperature, 28 Â°C... but around that time of the year, which was April, the temperature shoudn't be that high... Then I looked at the date next to the temperature. July 25th... 2023. Everything was just getting weirder and weirder. I showed it to her.

  
 She looked at me in shock. "It doesn't make sense", I saw her getting anxious, breathing faster, when I was going to hold her hand, something pulled me from behind, my vision was getting blury.

  
 I was in my room again.

  
The same place from when she went to the kitchen.

  
 I heard a lot of noise coming from the front door, I was so fucked up, I didn't know what to do, and a terrible headache, ears ringing. And then, the noise stopped, a familiar voice came from the front door, my parent were back from the groceries. I went on to talk to them, I started to try and explain what was happening to them, and they just looked and me and said "Are you an idiot? I can't understand anything that you're saying."

  
I just ignored them, and took my phone out to see if I still could talk to Catie, and the date was just the same, first thing that I noticed, April 22... 2024. The same day it was when she first called me from downstairs. What whas happening?? Somehow I could call her, but the call was just horrible, the image was terrible, but somehow we could still talk to each other, she said that she was fine, and that I just vanished in front of her, like in a blink of an eye.

 At this point we were just trying to figure something out, on how to be toghether again, and bring her back to the actual time. So while in call with her I told her to meet me in front of the building, before I left I took the jacket again, the mirror wasn't in my room anymore, and neither my parents were home anymore, I litereally just saw them, but anyways I started heading downstairs.

 When I started heading downstairs I noticed the lights changing just a little bit to that weird pinky white from before, so instead of keep heading downstairs, I started walking back up. I went to my door and checked the house... The mirror was there.

  
 Catie later told me that when I was heading downstairs, she just saw me appear from one floor to another, and then started heading up again, she also said that all our messages were giving an error in her phone, something like "Can't open messages from recent version of the app, update it to see new messages.". 

  
 Getting back to the mirror, I just closed the door as fast as I could, I didn't want to look at it anymore, and ran down the stairs, but when I was heading down the stairs, the pink light started to get to the normal color again, so I stopped and looked down, Catie wasn't there anymore, and she said I vanished again in between floors. So I tryied something.

 I went back up, opened and closed the door, no mirror there btw, and then started running back down again, and she saw me. We hugged so strong, I can even remember her warmth from that hug, then I asked her to hold my hand and don't turn off the phone call, she held my hand very strongly, like she wanted to break my fingers, I could tell how scared she was, me too, at least I felt safer with her again.

  
 So we started walking upstairs together, and I saw the lights change again, normal tone, I turned off our call and we got back again in front of my front door, while still holding her hand, I opened the door.

  
No mirror.

  
Parents talking in the kitchen.

  
Sight of realief from both of us, so we just went back to my room, together, and held hands for a while, still processing all that happened, she smiled at me. I gave her a kiss.
