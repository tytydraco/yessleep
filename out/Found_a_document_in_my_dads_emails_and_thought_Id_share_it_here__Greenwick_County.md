\[ADDENDUM A\]



At 3:02 AM, 01.13.2025, an animal emerged from the morgue. Security footage shows the animal crawling out of an open corpse locker and crashing through the door. All security cameras in the building are subsequently disabled for a total of fifteen minutes. The animal appears to be a bear covered in a dark, tar-like substance. It moves unnaturally, as if with several broken bones. Its head is concave in shape.



At 7:01 AM, 01.13.2025, Sheriff Deputy Arthur J. Brunwick finds the front door to the station opened with one hinge torn from the frame. Brunwick subsequently finds the holding cell which held one Joseph G. Cornish opened with several bars bent and torn from the wall, as well as a large quantity of dry blood covering every surface of the cell and some surfaces in the adjacent hallway. The officers stationed overnight are missing. Cornish, as well as the two officers, Cadet Ally McDeer (23) and Sheriff Deputy Mason Radcliffe (35), are a top priority missing persons. The corpse of Andrea Cornish is missing.
