I was in the third standard or grade when we moved into that house. One of those massive British-era army bungalows in Kirkee, Maharashtra. Huge stone block walls, creaky massive tiled floors, bathtubs in their own rooms, and ceilings so high they could swallow your voice. Even as a kid, I could tell the house had lived longer than all of us put together.

We were a family of five and a female dog. My dad was posted there as a Major. My two elder sisters were in college, usually up late studying, and I was the little one, trailing behind with my school bag and ponytail, mostly quiet, mostly watching everything.

The house was surrounded by banyan trees. Big, old ones with roots tangled and thick, like they’d been growing forever. They wrapped around the compound like they were guarding something, or making sure nothing got out. The first time I saw her, I wasn’t scared. Just curious.

It was a warm, quiet afternoon. I was walking past the living room when I saw this little girl come through the front door. She was very fair, blonde hair loose, wearing a faded flowery frock that looked like it belonged in an old English photo. I didn’t hear the gate open or the latch click. She just walked in like she’d always lived there.

She didn’t even glance at me. Just walked straight through and into the dining room, where my mum was cutting vegetables. I followed slowly, not sure what was happening. When I looked in, the girl was standing beside the dining table, watching my mum like someone quietly admiring a painting.

I just stood there staring until I said, “Mumma.”

The girl turned the second I spoke and ran toward the kitchen.

My mum looked up, confused, and asked what was wrong. I asked her, “Who was that girl?” She said, “What girl?” I said, “The one who just ran into the kitchen.” She got up right away, checked the kitchen, and found nothing. No one was there and everything was in its place. The back door of the kitchen was shut. So not a single trace of someone having been there.

I saw the girl a few more times after that, though never at such close proximity again. We were both silent observers from a distance. She was often half-hidden behind a wall or peeking from the end of a room. She was always looking at my mum with that same calm, unblinking expression. Never looked at me again and I never followed her again either.

There were other things too. Our dog was a rescued Doberman, blind in one eye but gentle and protective. She’d sit with my sisters while they studied late at night in the drawing room, always alert. She’d stare into corners like she was watching something move. She wouldn’t lie down until they left the room and went to bed.

The bedrooms were a different story. Each was huge and big enough to hold ten double beds. Each bedroom had its own wardrobe room, bathroom, and a separate tub room. Still, the three of us slept in one king-sized bed. The rest of the space felt too cold, too still almost like it didn’t want you there.

One night, my middle sister woke up. She said she heard a humming sound and opened her eyes to see a man standing right next to the bed. She couldn’t see him clearly, but he wasn’t see-through either. She said he was just a white, blurry shape. He had a pipe in one hand and seemed to be watching us sleep.

She didn’t dare move and just nudged our eldest sister whispering that someone was there. My eldest sis didn’t sit up. She slowly turned her head and to this day, she states that she saw a blurry figure too, but it was already starting to fade. Like smoke drifting out of the room.

My middle sister sat up and began whispering the Hanuman Chalisa. Her hands were shaking and eyes shut. She didn’t stop until it felt like the room had cleared. I was asleep the whole time, thankfully I didn’t feel a thing.

It didn’t end there though. One night, my mum went to the kitchen to fill a water jug. The second she turned on the tap, she heard someone laugh. A man’s voice, right outside the kitchen window. Clear as day, just laughing into the kitchen it seemed.

She left the jug, ran straight to wake up my dad. He grabbed a torch, took our dog, and checked the entire compound. Nothing. No footprints in the mud, no signs the gate had opened. The land outside was big and usually damp from dew, so it should’ve shown something.

That house was old and filled with history of the colonial times. The kind of old that settles into the ground and stays there, watching. The trees around it didn’t just grow, they loomed and my dad often sent us kids running to see who could touch the farthest banyan tree and back during the evening twilight hours. We often felt those banyan roots had probably wrapped around things that were better left buried.

After a while, we stopped trying to explain the strange things. It was easier to just live with it and go on with our daily things. We figured we weren’t the first ones in that house, and we probably wouldn’t be the last. I guess, probably not all of them had left the country.

But I still think about that little girl sometimes. She never looked lost and was never angry. It was just like she missed something or someone. Maybe she was still looking for her mother. Maybe she used to stand in the same dining room, watching her mum slice vegetables, singing the way mine did sometimes.

Maybe, just maybe she never stopped waiting. Thank you for reading. I have had a lot of spooky experiences and so has my family. We would be happy to share them.
