I spent my childhood in San Francisco. Although I moved away to Sacramento, I still visit San Francisco to see my parents at least once every two weeks. So, to say that going to San Francisco "for old times' sake" doesn't quite apply to me. But this month, I visited for that very reason—twice.

But not for happy reasons.

Mr. Langdon was one of the most respected teachers at Sir Easton Elementary School, where I had studied. He was also my homeroom teacher. The tragic news that came from my parents was that Langdon had died by heart attack at the age of 70. 15 years after I left Sir Easton. The worst part of this was that he died in front of his class, surrounded by students desperately trying to save him. Their efforts, however, were futile, as they were just nine years old. His sudden death sent shockwaves throughout the city.



My mother handed me an invitation to his funeral, which was to be held at the church near our old school. Mr. Langdon often shared how symbolic the church was to him. His parents were married there, he was baptized there, and later, he was married there as well - and now, it was going to be his last destination before heading six feet under. 



What a place. 

Mr. Langdon’s funeral was attended by nearly 10% of the city. As Sir Easton was the only elementary school in the area, many adults in the city, who had once been his pupils, came to bid their final farewell to the coolest and most respectable teacher they had ever known—a humble, kind-hearted spirit now embarking on his journey into eternity, surrounded by his students.

The seating plan for the funeral was divided into three sections. One side was designated for current students who came to pay their respects to their mentor. It was quite surprising for many civilians to see so many students lining up and filling the seats. There wasn’t any indication that they were attending the funeral simply because their teacher had listed it as an extracurricular activity. Instead, the kids seemed as though they had come of their own accord, genuinely wanting to honor a teacher they deeply respected.

The second section, with the same number of chairs as the first, was reserved for Sir Easton’s former students—mostly the parents of the current students. These parents had once attended the school themselves and sat in the very same classrooms as their children do now.

The final section was meant for people like me: those who had been in Sir Easton’s class in any year. We were the students who had spent the most time learning under Mr. Langdon. I remember when we were young and rebellious; Mr. Langdon would often use small treats as incentives to keep us in line, especially during school assemblies when we couldn’t stop whispering to each other.

This time, there was no treat, and we were all behaving. I recognize some faces here, and I remember how they acted when I was in class with them— not even the class clown or the "naughty kids" were snickering. Everyone in this room looked as if they were witnessing the end of the world.

Soon, I realized that I was sitting next to Jeff, someone I had been hoping to see this morning. But at the same time, he was the last person I expected to see in person.

The thing is, many of the students from my class actually kept in touch with each other from time to time, even after we graduated. But that wasn’t the case for Jeff. The last time I saw him was online, through a social media post telling me he was no longer in America, but living in Wales. I don’t know if he came for the funeral or if he moved back to America.

I wonder when he came to America—he didn’t look tired at all, and he seemed like he was expecting this day. I just wonder why.

The funeral began and lasted an hour. Mr. Langdon’s coffin was moved to a cemetery near the church, the same one where Mr. Langdon’s father, grandfather, and grandmother were buried. However, they were not buried together or alongside one another.

As we watched the coffin go down, I was surprised to see who was filling the hole—it was Jeff. Surely he didn’t come back just to bury his old teacher. The other person who was helping him fill the hole was a civilian.

I could sense there was something wrong about Jeff. He had just appeared in America after years of silence, only to fill his teacher’s grave, and that wasn’t even the weirdest part.

The weirdest part: while the other gravedigger silently worked without any sign of emotion, Jeff was showing signs of one—dread. But it wasn’t triggered by sadness or grief; I saw it, and it was triggered by fear.

The moment I could finally talk casually with Jeff was when lunch came. To celebrate the life of our old mentor, we visited his favorite pizza place, ordered various pizzas, and toasted to a better tomorrow without a mentor to guide us. I talked to a lot of friends as we ate, learning a lot about life.

Once everyone left, it was just me and Jeff. That’s when Jeff started to talk to me casually—a red flag, if I say so myself.

Jeff told me about his life, and I talked about mine. We were both salesmen from different nations, working for the same branch, which felt like a twist of fate. But one thing I was sure of was that he was avoiding talking about Mr. Langdon, and I caught on as soon as he dodged the topic multiple times.

“Does Mr. Langdon’s death upset you?”

Then there was a big sigh, one that caught me by surprise.

“Is it just me, or is there something wrong with Mr. Langdon’s photo in our class section of the school yearbook?”

School yearbooks... huh. It was something I hadn’t thought about in a while, but I do know for a fact that I own the Sir Easton School yearbook for nostalgia’s sake.

“What about it?” I asked.

“Do you know why I came back to America? To ask you this question: Are you familiar with his eye color?”

I nodded.

And that was when Jeff brought out the school yearbook to show me the class photo. At first, I thought there was nothing wrong with it—until I saw Mr. Langdon’s photo.

There were no eyes. It looked like a very well-done cosplay of that famous Minecraft Creepypasta character, Herobrine. His eyes were completely missing, like something straight out of a zombie movie, and it felt like I was being watched.

“Was it always like this?” I asked.

“I am not sure.” Jeff replied. 

We both stared at the photo, trying to figure out what was wrong with it, and then Jeff chuckled.

“Bah, maybe I’m just overthinking things. A very badly edited photo, probably,” he said. That was when I came to my senses and realized that was the only logical answer to whatever the hell this photo had become.

At least half of it.

Why hadn’t people reported this messed-up photo in the yearbook? Were his eyes always like this, and we just hadn’t noticed?

Our thoughts eventually made us stop eating, and the restaurant worker, who probably saw us as homeless men looking for shelter to read crime books, kicked us out. I left, half confused, half furious. I checked on Jeff, who was still staring at the photograph. There was no doubt—something was wrong with Mr. Langdon’s photo.

Then I remembered what my mom had said when I first got the yearbook: I was lucky I hadn’t demanded one right away because a lot of the photos, especially those of staff members, weren’t taken well and were of bad quality.

“Maybe you got the early issue—the one with the faulty photos,” I suggested.

Jeff agreed. He admitted he might have been a greedy bastard, trying to get the earliest issue of the school yearbook, not caring that it might still need double check.

We kept talking about school because of the Yearbook as we walked to our cars. Before I left, I got his phone number so I could contact him to meet up on another day, and Jeff waved goodbye as I rode home.

It was a strange day.

It started to rain when I drove back to Sacramento. On the way, I was listening to rock music and driving casually until the moment the music stopped. That was when the thought returned: *Am I overthinking things, or am I simplifying things?*

The thoughts started to disturb my focus on the road, almost making me run a red light at a crossroad. That was when I stopped thinking about it and decided to focus on the road home.

I parked my car in front of the house and headed inside. It was a clean house, filled with emptiness. Since I lived a minimal lifestyle, having furniture left and right was something I was not fond of at all. The only furniture I had was a chair, table, couch, and bed. Despite spending most of my time outside of my work here, the emptiness of my house felt surreal for some reason right now, as if I had returned home after a decade of being away.

I started looking for the Yearbook Jeff mentioned. I had taken a lot of school stuff while moving homes, and eventually, I stumbled upon the Yearbook.

I flipped through the Yearbook and saw the photos of my classmates. As I skimmed through, I came across Mr. Langdon’s photo. Just as Jeff had said, what was supposed to be a normal photo of Mr. Langdon didn’t seem normal at all. I don’t know what was wrong with the photo, but he looked like a zombie, a decaying corpse.

Even worse than how I saw him before, he looked like a dead body from at least a century ago.

I then looked at the other photos and nearly dropped the Yearbook.

Jeff. His photo showed the same problem. What shocked me the most was the fact that when I was talking to Jeff, there was nothing wrong with his photo in his copy of the Yearbook. Only Mr. Langdon’s photo had the weird zombie-like face. But my Yearbook was telling a different story.

I rubbed my eyes, hoping I was seeing things.

But there was no doubt.

Immediately, I contacted Jeff to tell him about what I found in the Yearbook, that his face was decaying in it. But for some reason, I got no response, only the sound of the phone ringing.

I got a message as soon as I hung up. I thought it was from Jeff, but the message was a DM invitation to a chatroom, and the members were all my classmates whom I had met during the funeral.

I had forgotten about the thing I saw in the yearbook and grinned as the chatroom of my old friends greeted me. They were all talking about how they were living in the current world after graduation and the class’s separation, reminiscing about how they missed each other, and lamenting the loss of Mr. Langdon.

I looked at the member list to see that Jeff hadn’t joined yet, but the chat messages distracted me immediately.

They were planning a reunion—a proper reunion the next day—with many of our classmates agreeing to it. The place? School, our old class. While it was obvious due to recent events, the place was going to be pretty somber. But hey, at least this might be a sign of a new beginning.

I headed to bed early that night and had a very strange dream. I was in a classroom filled with all my friends, where I was looking down and writing notes. When I looked up, I saw Mr. Langdon’s face—instead of the face of a normal man, his face was decayed like a zombie’s.

I looked beside me to see Jeff, who was staring at me, and I froze when I saw his face, decayed like Mr. Langdon’s in the photo. It filled me with unspeakable fear. What terrified me even more was the way Jeff stared at me. It didn’t look like he was staring at me at all. It looked as if he was staring into something else, accepting the fact that he was like this.

The fact that he was a corpse.

I was woken up by the sound of what I thought was my alarm clock. Instead, it was a myriad of messages cramming through my phone.

DMs from the people in the chatroom, filled with R.I.P.s, NOs, and crying-face emojis.

I entered the chatroom and furiously scrolled up to see one of the students say this:

Jeff died in a car crash.

My body shook with unspeakable fear. Twenty-four hours hadn’t even passed, and here I was, hearing the news that Jeff was dead. As I called one of my friends and hurried downstairs, something unspeakable appeared near me.

The yearbook was open, as if it were luring me there. As if it were waiting for me—waiting for me to check.

I looked at the yearbook and immediately dropped my phone, as if the book were telling me something. Jeff’s face in the yearbook had met the same fate as Mr. Langdon’s photo—decayed like a dead body, mummified, dried up. This was something I didn’t expect.

I just stood there, numb, for at least a minute. The moment I started to move was when I saw the clock reach 8. Checking my DM, I saw a message from early this morning saying that Jeff’s family was going to bury him as soon as possible, meaning the funeral was today.

I had just come back from one yesterday, and now I was attending another. Not even 24 hours had passed. But that’s not what I was focused on; I wasn’t thinking about my schedule.

I just couldn’t stop thinking about what the hell was going on with the damn yearbook.

Jeff’s memorial was held at a different church this time, with fewer people attending. Unlike Mr. Langdon, Jeff was not a well-respected civilian. A normal civilian, I mean. And unlike Mr. Langdon’s coffin, which was open for us to bid farewell and see his tranquil face as he passed on, according to his parents, Jeff’s body had been brutally broken into pieces. What was inside the coffin were just parts of him.

The funeral lasted the same length, but people did not move from the seat despite the coffin leaving and Jeff’s Family following to their son’s grave, a lot of us just sat there in silence, probably thinking the same thing: We had to attend a funeral twice in a row. 

And just as my mindset waas turning for a better future…

“Are you guys out of your goddamn minds?” 

I turned along with others as a commotion started behind me, There was three man, one sided with the second, trying to break up the fight, the third man grabbing one of the man’s shirts - I didn’t recognise the man who was being grabbed onto, but the one who was breaking the fight was Fred, a school bully, and the person who was grabbing the man by the shoulder was Harold. I knew for a fact it was harold because ever since he became a successful businessmen, he was all over the news in the state.

“Tax Jeff’s family? Right now? You have no dignity!” Harold attacked.

“It is business! Jeff had borrowed money from us!” Fred barked. “If that prick is going to not pay that debt and head to the grave, then You need to know that we need a replacement!”

“By getting their damn family to pay back!” Fred’s Companion shouted.

The classmates all rounded up like they did when they were bullying Harold in te past. I was hoping some of them were humane enough to know that Fred was wrong in this fight. Asking for money in front of a grieving family for their personal gain was not a good timing.

But I saw the repeat the the things that happened decades go, people sided with Fred, and soon It was not 1 vs 2, but 1 vs all besides Me, who stood there numb, watching Harold argue with others as shouts and swears were thrown to each other, telling each other to go to hell and die a horrible death.

Not even 24 hours has passed and the class reunion went to shambles. It was no brainer that after this day, there won’t be a new day to choose for reunion. Everyone had their reason to hate the other faction now. Or at least  the reunion will continue without the presence of Harold. As if Harold knew that was going to happen - he looked furious.

I silently left the building as other students continued their strife. I couldn’t believe it. I was furious as well—not only did they have the guts to continue bullying someone after a decade, but they had the nerve to mock someone in front of a funeral.

I just felt like I was going to explode if I kept driving to the house. Instead of heading back, I phoned my mom and asked if I could stay overnight at their house. With her permission, I decided to head to my parents’ house and spend the day there instead of driving back home. Not only had it been two weeks since I last saw them, but I just felt like I shouldn’t drive for my sanity.

As I mentioned, I visit my family’s house every two weeks, but this was the first time I was going to spend the night there, instead of returning home the same day. Because Mom knew about the funeral of Jeff, she hugged me as I entered.

I assured her I was okay and headed to what used to be my bedroom. Ever since I left home, Mom and Dad had been using the room to store their belongings and old house furniture, albums, and books—especially books.

My dad was a book collector. He collected books from around the world and stored them to read when he had time after work.

I looked around the bookshelf: classics such as *Gulliver's Travels* and *Treasure Island* on the top shelf, horror novels such as *It* and *Misery* on the middle, and family albums on the bottom shelf. As I dug through the family album shelf, I saw something that made my blood freeze.

That yearbook. But I knew it was my parents’ copy. I was pretty sure my parents bought another copy from somewhere else after I took the original. It was also one of the last editions of the yearbook from that year, meaning this was brand new.

But instead of wonder, fear filled my mind.

Carefully, I took it out and flipped through the pages. As the pages turned, I saw the photos of other classes, and they all looked fine.

Then what I saw in the photo almost made me throw up.

Not only was Jeff's photo mummified like Mr. Langdon’s photo, but I was surrounded by the photos of those decayed people—half of the portraits of the students were turning into people with rotten flesh.

The worst of the photos was the photo of Harold. His photo was not just mummified; it was on fire, as if it was some kind of undead from the deepest parts of hellfire.

I instinctively shut the yearbook when my mom asked if I wanted pizza for lunch. I calmly tried to say yes. It was definitely a “yes” with a slight tone of fear, but she didn’t notice. And I had no intention of showing it to her.

I couldn’t believe what was happening with the yearbook; the black magic surrounding me was confusing. I was looking at a yearbook where people’s faces slowly decayed. That was the first thing. The second was that anyone whose photo decays dies within the next 24 hours. The third was that after death, the photos of the deceased student turn into cursed mummies.

I checked the group chat to see if there was any activity. A myriad of messages were being posted between each other on the phone.

*Phillip*

*I am suggesting Italian for Dinner*

*Jacob*

*Try to avoid the pizza place Harold’s parents own*

*David*

*Maybe we should visit them to tell them how shit their son is*

*Jim* 

*LOL We shou*

As soon as that message was sent, I found myself staring at the yearbook. What I saw was this: the photos seemed to change in an instant, as if I were watching a PowerPoint presentation. The images of decaying students were now mummified, and the others, who hadn't been decaying corpses before, now were.

Instinct kicked in, and I realized my colleagues had been in an accident.

Without a word, I ran out of the house and began wandering the city, searching for answers about what had happened to my friends. As I sprinted toward the city square, ambulances began to appear from multiple parts of the city, and from a distance, I saw it.

A bus had flipped over and landed on its roof at the edge of the lake, while a black Toyota lay crushed like a pancake atop the bridge.

A crowd of civilians had gathered to witness the carnage, and I subconsciously joined them. They surrounded the bus as paramedics rushed in and began pulling out the bodies. It was clear to anyone that such an accident left little hope for survival.

The survivors crawled out of the bus and were escorted to the ambulances, while the emergency team searched through the wreckage for bodies.

I looked over at the bridge and saw the car that had been crushed by the force of impact from the bus. Inside was a driver I knew, and I immediately understood why this had happened.

The driver was Harold. His face was buried in the airbag, but it was obvious he was dead. There was no suicide note or any explanation, but one thing was certain: he was gone.

As the survivors were dragged out, I knew they wouldn’t make it out of the hospital alive. The yearbook had already shown me that the fate of the last few classmates had been sealed.

—

It has been a day since that tragedy.

I told Mom an hour ago that I had arrived home, but in reality, I’m still in San Francisco, writing this in a hotel room on my laptop. Everything I’ve shared, all of this story in the journal, all of the events from the past few days, they are all true.

In the school yearbook, there are only mummies; the photos of students are now images of mummified bodies. Those who didn’t die in the initial impact succumbed during treatment.

And there is only my photo, which no longer shows the face of a hopeful young boy.

Instead, my portrait is decaying as well.

I’m not going home because I know I won’t survive long enough to make it back to Sacramento.
