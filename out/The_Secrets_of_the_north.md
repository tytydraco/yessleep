For many reasons that will become obvious as you continue to read, I will not be sharing my name in this story.

About 5 years ago I was fresh out of college and drowned in more student debt then I care to admit, and what do you do when you are drowning in student debt? Well, you get the best paying job possible and mine just happened to be working for the government.

Working for the government came with its pros and cons like any job really except this one had more cons than pros. You see I worked for a special part of the government one that activated when needing to handle threats to national security. With that type of work usually came with a very light workload so I never really complained that was until a particular fall night in October of 2009. I was sitting at my desk like I normally do talking about life in general when a call came over my cell phone it was my supervisor telling me I was needed in the head supervisor's office asap.

Thinking nothing of it I got up told the men I'd be right back and proceeded down the brightly lit hallway to the office of my head supervisor where surprisingly enough he was already waiting arms folded with a folder on the desk in front of him marked classified level 5 access only. It's good to note now that I only had level 3 access so when I saw this folder sitting in front of him, I could not wait to see inside it.

Close the door and have a seat he said with a more serious tone than what I'm used to. I did as he said and proceeded to ask sir what exactly am I doing here? Am I in trouble? Have I done something wrong? We have a situation up north that I believe could use your area of expertise he said looking at me with a stern look on his face. Ok I said hesitantly feeling a bit on edge now. Look at the file he said sliding the folder over to me. I opened the folder and skimmed the contents inside a look of worry washed over my face and he could see it.

Look I understand this is new to you, but I need you to look alive you have level 5 access now and I need to know if you can handle it. I looked up at him and back down at the file yes sir I believe I can but why me. He cleared his throat look son I read your file you have a degree in criminal justice for homeland security you got survival training and you been here in this agency for 2 years I know you are right for this so are you in or out. I looked one more time over the file and back at him yes, I'm in good follow me he said with a half grin plastered across his face. I followed him down a set of corridors and into an elevator where instead of going down like I thought we would do we went up to the top floor where all the top-secret files of the US government are kept. In here follow me he said going through an unmarked door and into a windowless room I followed him inside where he introduced me to 3 additional SR agents for this story, they will be dubbed agent 1 2 and 3.

These are the men who will be accompanying you on your trip to the north pole they will fill you in and answer any questions you may have and when you return you will be met with a very generous pay out good luck son and gentleman stay safe. With that he left the room leaving me with these 3 men I have never seen before. So, here's your debrief I'm guessing you read the file, so you know the basics of what's going on said agent 1 but here is the more in depth version. A few days ago, a research team was on their way back to their base with some samples they had taken a day prior from the ice caps when they mysteriously disappeared without a trace. Are job is to head up there assess the threat if there is one figure out what happened and come back home. Now a partial radio message was received 2 hours after they disappeared it was pinged and tracked 7 clicks to the north of the research base, a rescue team was immediately sent out to find out what happened they have also disappeared I will play that partial transmission for you now warning it's not pleasant.

&#x200B;

"This is captain Cook unit number 20181 we (scrambled transmission) on the mountain send (Scrambled) (followed by screams and silence)"

As you heard there the captain of that research group was trying to radio for help further contact has failed any questions? Alright let's go with that one by one we were heading through the door and out to the corridor once more where we were boarding an elevator and proceeding to the ground floor where a jeep was waiting. At some point I must have fell asleep as I was woken up to agent 2 shaking me saying look alive. I looked out the window of the jeep to only see a huge plane boarding on the tarmac adjacent to the left of us. One by one we boarded the plane and without wasting any time we were in the air, I just remember my stomach being in knots the whole time not being able to hold back my prayers of landing soon as I truly hate flying always have.

Sometime had past and we were now landing on an icy but safe looking runway at a site know as zone 12. Alright look alive men agent 1 said were here are mission is simple find the group assess and eliminate the threat if there is one and get back home lets go. One by one we got off the plane guns in hand bundled in winter gear all with the same goal in mind get this done fast and get home safe. Hi my name is agent 1 this is agent 2 3 and our field expert we are here on behalf of sector 7 we understand you have had an issue with one of your research teams agent 1 said to the site commander. Yes we have not been able to contact them or the rescue team in a few days or so, do we still know if their alive said agent 3 let's hope so the commander replied.

With that the commander pointed us to an armored hum v where we all boarded and headed blindly out into the snow. Alright you know the mission we are about 30 minutes out from the last GPS ping of the rescue team since they are closer, we will see if we can find them first. about 20 minutes had past and we were giving up hope when we saw foot prints it hasn't snowed in days, so we were hopeful Agent 1 I yelled out look footprints. He signaled for agent 3 to stop and we all got out to investigate, they look like they trail off about 2 clicks west that way I said about a 7-to-10-minute hike I said looking at agent 1. Good eye here is what we will do agent 2 and agent 3 you guys go hike that way see what you can see in terms of those footprints stay on coms me and the field agent will follow these tire tracks to the last known GPS ping we will regroup at the radar station 3 clicks east of here radio if you find something.

We soon lost sight of agent 2 and 3 and were closing in on the last known position of the rescue team. Agent 2 agent 3 come in this is agent 1 do you read over "We read you loud and clear we followed the footprints they just end no bodies or survivors that we can see we will investigate and head to the radar base right after over" copy that agent 1 replied into the radio. Alright let's keep going I think I see something up there This is agent 1 to agent 2 and 3 we got a recovery team truck abandon at coordinates x-109, y-10, z12 over (Radio statics) do you read me over (More static) Alright let's check that out we approached the truck slowly guns aimed high as we got closer only to find it empty and with blood all over the front of the truck.

Jesus Christ Zone 12 do you copy this is agent 1 over agent 2 and 3 do you copy this is agent 1 over we got blood everywhere over (More static) God damn it screw this radio. Calm down relax I told him lets search this area see what we see, I'll tell you what I see snow, snow, and more damn snow. Hey what's that I say pointing toward a dark patch in the snow, we run to the spot only to see its 4 dead bodies all of them belonging to the rescue team. God damn it what could have done that their throats are gone, I don't know but by the looks of it they died instantly. Looks like they stopped for something only to be taken out by something else said agent 1 yeah, I replied softly we should keep going the last radio transmission from the recovery team came from about 5 clicks that way let's hope they did not meet the same fate I said softly saying a quick prayer for the fallen rescue team.

We proceeded up the mountain toward the last known location to only find 3 more abandon trucks but no blood this time. breathing a Sye of relief, I stepped down from our hum v gun still raised scanning the area as we got closer to the trucks. Holy shit agent 1 blurted out what I replied quickly, whatever sample they took it broke free from its cage with a quick glance I heard a sound behind me yeah and whatever it is it's still here look sharp I blurted out. Whatever it was it was know where to be seen by the time we turned around and all we could see was a tall shape in the distance. What is that agent 1 asked I have no idea I said heart still beating fast from what just happened, let's go find out shall we.

As we got closer, we soon realized it was an outpost of some sort. Well would you look at that I said to agent 1 you think they would go there if they survived, I said. I don't know but someone has to be there the powers on replied agent 1. We proceeded to head inside where to our surprise no one was inside, it simply looked as if someone left in a hurry and forgot to turn the power off. These things run on a 6-month generator who knows how long they been gone I said to agent 1 yeah but it doesn't hurt to look around though agent 1 replied.

Looking around only proved to be a waste of time there was no sign telling us who was here or how long they been gone other than finding a small amount of food and water left behind there was nothing. Well, that's a bust agent 1 said yeah let's move on I replied, then as if it was a scene out of a scary movie the lights flickered, and gun shots could be heard outside. What the hell agent 1 screamed we both grabbed our rifles and ran outside only to see agent 2 and 3 shooting something that looked non-human that was heading for the tree line of the surrounding forest. Hey, I shouted where have you been and what the hell was that.

They both looked at us with shock on their faces we thought you were dead we got only half your message and radios went silent we mapped out your coordinates the best we could of what we heard on radio and saw that thing jumping out of the back of your guy's hum v said agent 2. Shit glad you're alive I replied we unfortunately found the rescue team all kia with their throats ripped out no sign of the recovery team other than their vehicles back there. We seen something similar with some village people up by the west side of the mountain said agent 3 sounding out of breath. It was a horrific sight he continued we barely made it over here we kept being chased by whatever that thing was that ran into the tree line.

Alright here is the new plan it is getting dark and according to weather, and radar reports we got a storm coming in but it is not supposed to last that long so about 2 clicks west of here is a clearing we are going to go back to the hum v and get to that clearing where we will set up camp for the night and in the morning we will go from there sound good? said agent 1 yes sir alright move out.

I do not think any of us slept that night and before we knew it morning was upon us. Ok ok let's go everyone up we got a long ride ahead of us said agent 1. What's the plan I replied yawning rubbing my eyes, we will be driving to the other side of the mountain last night when you all were asleep, I took a look around I seen campfire smoke coming from the west ridge line of the mountain said agent 1. That means there's people are they our people I do not know will we find out yes, we will now let's move out said agent 1. With that we were off I must of fell back to sleep as I was jolted awake by agent 2 slamming on the breaks, I looked around hey man what gives quite he yelled back grabbing his rifle you hear that? Hear what? I replied that did you hear that and then I heard it the sound of a feint scream coming from beyond the ridge line of the mountain.

Before I knew what we were doing we were off moving fast but cautiously onto the ridge line of the mountain. Hold agent 1 said there 30 meters to the north was a man in a winter lab jacket omg I yelled is that one of the researchers? Agent 1 looked at me yes, I think so omg what is that chasing him agent 3 blurted out. There not too far behind him but not to close either was one of those strange looking creatures from yesterday chasing him down the mountain.

Hey!! Agent 2 yells out the researcher looks up at us over here agent 2 continues he begins to come toward us agent 3 get ready to grab and run said agent 1 copy replied agent 3. Before I knew it agent 3 had the researcher and we were running for our life back to the hum v. Agent 1 turns to me get on that turret I did as he said and open fired on the creature who was now 6 feet from our hum v.

Where is your team said agent 1 there all gone eaten by that freak of nature the researcher replied. Agent 3 get us to echo Zulu rally point said agent 1 copy that sir replied agent 3, about an hour has passed and we were pulling up to this big building with guards everywhere. Alright agent 2 bring him into interrogation room 3 and bring the field agent with you agent 3 go with them as well yes sir we all replied.

Alright start from the beginning I say setting a cup of tea in front of the researcher what happened out there? It was a normal get in and get out task we got reports of material that needed to be collected from a particular rock that fell into an icy part of the north pole from the previous meteor shower we had. Go on I said, right so we get there with no issue but upon arriving there is something already there. What do you mean a person? said agent 2, no it wasn't a person it was a thing it was scary, and it looked at us with its beedi little eyes man it attacked baker first then Sanchez, then went after me and captain Cook but we got away we managed to capture it and we made it as far as an outpost before it escaped and killed Cook I ran and hid and you guys showed up a little while after that.

Ok we will be back we left the room and talked about it before being gestured by agent 1 to follow him. We did so only to be pushed on a plane and told to shut up and to not say a word until we landed. Sometime had past and we were back at the base we took off from a week earlier as we disembarked from the plane a man in a black suit greeted all 3 of us with a warm smile and handed each of us a yellow envelope and told us to get in 3 separate cars which were waiting on us those cars then drove us to separate cities in which we never been too.

As far as the rest goes well it doesn't really matter now I was handed a letter of resignation forged with my signature at the bottom as well as a NDA with the same thing a forge signature followed by that yellow envelope which carried 105 thousand dollars inside I never spoke of the incident as I was not allowed to till now and as far as I know the rest of the team got the same thing I have not heard anything further and have had no other ties to sector 7 and those creatures well I am fully convinced they are still up there waiting and lurking.

The NDA expired last month, and bits and pieces were shared online and as far as I go well, I'm a police officer now and in my late 40's wrapping up my career looking forward to retirement and moving on with my life I did attend agent 1's funeral last week and I got to say that is a story in itself. 

Let this be a lesson don't ever take a job you're not sure of or if it has anything to do with national security you only lose yourself in the long run, I know I did.
