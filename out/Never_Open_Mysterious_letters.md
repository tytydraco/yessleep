It would have been a normal day. The crisp autumn breeze, fresh smell of cinnamon and pumpkin in the air. A perfect day for a walk in the small community Glenn lived in.   
    
   
That was until it became an awful downpour, and he was drenched from head to toe.    
   
    
The main reason for Glenn taking this trip into town was to look at a few shops and pick up what mail he had at the local post office.    
   
    
Taking out the key to his P.O box Glenn opened it peering at the contents inside seeing a single letter with an embossed onyx envelope with his name written on the front in elegant letters on the front. Was it some sort of invitation?   
    
   
Taking the letter out, he shoved it into his messenger bag and locked the P.O box and began his walk back home. Once at home and in dry comfrontable clothes he sat on his sofa picking up the embossed onyx letter from the coffee table. Turning it over in his hands, examining it closely.   
    
   
If it were an invitation to where could it be to?    
   
   
 Opening it he took out the small card from inside it.   
    
   
My Dearest,   
I hope that this letter finds you well. It has been so long since the last time we met. I have missed you so much, and I want to see you again soon. I need to see you.   
Sincerely yours,   
Virgil   
    
   
Just who in the seven hells was this? Glenn had never heard of that name before so just who was he? Honestly, this person sounded like a stalker. Should Glenn report this to the police? Though with little evidence besides this letter would it even be worth the department's time?   
    
   
Sighing, he sat the letter on the coffee table deciding to head to bed.    
   
   
It did not seem as if he had been asleep long when upon opening his eyes it was still very dark around them. It was strange considering he always leaves on string lights when he goes to bed. A panic started to build up in his chest...a tight suffocating feeling.   
    
   
Going to turn on his side and pull the covers over his head so he could go back to sleep. Glenn felt that something was amiss when going to grab the blankets to find them nowhere within reach.   
    
   
When he sat up, his forehead contacted something solid. Rubbing the sore spot, he moved his hands around. Trying to make sure he was still in the comfort of his own bed.   
    
   
It was solid, and course.   
    
   
Glenn reached upwards with his hand and to the left and right side. What was he confined in?   
    
   
It was so dark.   
    
   
And the space seemed so small.   
    
   
Short, panicked breaths escaped his lips.   
    
   
"Shh it's going to be okay. I will let you out soon"   
    
   
Who was this person? What did he want? Could it be the guy from the letter?    
    
   
"Virgil? What do you want from me?!" Glenn asked panic rising in his voice.   
    
   
He heard Virgil chuckle "Why you of course...because if I can't have you. Then to put it simply NO ONE CAN".   
    
   
He began to shake, closing his eyes. Who knew when the next time he would ever see daylight ever again. Glenn would have to find a way to contact someone anyone to let them know he had been kidnapped.   
   
   
If you too are reading this his name is Glenn Solace, he has been missing for months now. The police department investigated his apartment to find the letter, but the only fingerprints they found were Glennâ€™s.    
   
   
I just hope he is leaving a trail of breadcrumbs so someone will find him.
