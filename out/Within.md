Investigation Report:
The following is a manifesto discovered on November 1st, 2018 in Denali National Park, Alaska.
It was found alongside other items in an abandoned tent.

Who decides what is, and is not, forbidden? What is a forbidden thing?

Is it a dark and winding trail down a forest that no one has a name for? Is it a long walk down this trail, until one reaches the very precipice of insanity amidst the clinging green, and finally reaches a small cabin therein?

It’s been months since I’ve discovered this forbidden thing. Each weekend, this trail is trespassed upon, and I, as if carried by some misty dream, follow the whispers and shades that lead me down it. I’m drawn, and like an addict splayed across the street’s curb, I know there is danger near and yet I cannot escape myself.

It is cold now. Autumn is at its edge, and it seems as though the grip of Winter ‘s chill is almost at its hour. Leaves have long since departed their home, now dry like dust, and settled on the forest floor. Only the evergreens stand tall, solemn and lonely alongside their fallen comrades.

I walk this trail, not alone, but with a girl whom I have gotten to know.

“Walk this trail with me,” I had said and she had followed, blindly, unwittingly, until the shadows of white and withered boughs were cast in the sunset's gloom. We passed the spot where a sign might have stood, but that sign had long since been buried beneath rust and rain. Even when I discovered it before, it was indecipherable. A symbol is on it that, in earnest, I frankly don't recognize.

Down and down into the green.

We finally arrive at the cabin; this cabin door. Footsteps are hesitant and light when entering the cabin, and I act as though I had never done so. Something seems wrong, inside and outside this wooden dwelling. The trees grow just a little too crooked, the evening crows are just a little too loud. There’s a smell in the air, like no other. It isn’t the smell of mold, or rotting meat. It comes from another place; a place unknown.

“Let’s keep going,” I pressed, and though she resisted, I continued to lead her about that cabin. It is an empty vessel, abandoned long ago by its owners. Nothing but ghosts and memories to haunt its rotting, wooden walls. Pictures of people; smiling faces. Dust gathered on dirty dishes in the sink.

We walk into the basement. It’s far too dark to see, and our phones cast an eerie light. This is a place no human should linger.

Down and down into the black.

We come across the pit of the cellar. It’s sprawling, and deceptively huge. A maze of dirt and concrete.

“What were these people doing down here?” I muse. The girl vaguely answers. I knew, but she didn’t. It’s just a game to me.

Finally, we reach our spot. It’s too dark to see, even with the flashlights. More like it’s too dark to understand what you’re seeing. That smell besets us. It is a grave of dirt, and we were far below in its depths.

The girl steps on something, maybe a hand or a jaw, and screams. She awakes something in the dark beyond, and it comes for us, squeezing through a tunnel half its size.

It’s tall, and gaunt; white and withered like the boughs of the forest above. Curling misshapen shapes twisted its misbegotten body this way and that. The light revealed the shapes to be animals, kicking with panic and crying out in pain, sunken into the flesh of the creature and being absorbed, or maybe bursting forth from within. It had been human once, a girl just like the one I had brought with me, but no longer. Its horrible visage is drawn and mummified, a perversion of the picturesque, pretty face it might’ve been.

It looks at us, with its baleful yellow eyes, past mottled black hair and thorns of bone. 

The creature picks up the girl, and beholds her. Without a word, something in its alien mind instructs it to peel the flesh from the girl, strip by strip, until the red of her carcass is like a glistening bouquet. I run from the sounds. Gleefully. 

I don’t know why I do what I do, but it feels right; like I’m part of something larger than myself.
