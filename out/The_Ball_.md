# The Ball

My name is John Smith, working the night shift at a convenience store near my house. I usually walk to work at 8 o’clock in the evening. 

My life and work were very ordinary, like a windless lake with no waves.until that day came.

About 10 days ago, I left the house for work at 7:30 p.m. as usual. When I walked down a narrow alley not far from the convenience store, I suddenly heard the sound of a child playing with a ball behind me. There were no street lights in here. When I turned around, I saw behind me, about 20 paces or so, a child who was constantly clapping his ball.

I could not see his face clearly, and could only see the strange outline of the ball in his hand in the dim moonlight. As he clapped, he sang a nursery rhyme:

Don’t run away, the little ball,

Mom’s head is like yours.

Family is poor but until now,

I never lack balls at all.

It’s so weird. I don’t remember learning nursery rhymes like that when I was a child. The air around me was sticky like a mass of transparent colloid, enveloping my body. Just when I was about to drown in this horrible suffocating atmosphere, suddenly, a tiny voice in my heart and whispered in my ear: 

**RUN!**

No moonlight, no more. My body suddenly moved, as if I had just broken free from a chain. I quickly took a step to turn and run to the exit of the alley. But the road began to extend, and the exit was getting further and further away from me. And then there was the increasingly loud sound of the ball hitting the ground. Or rather, the dull sound of objects crashing to the ground repeats itself.

**PLAY WITH ME, PLEASE!**

A young but lifeless voice came from behind me. I closed my eyes and sprinted forward as hard as I could, however, the sound of the ball bouncing closer and closer to me.

**KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!**

Voices began to come not from behind me, but from all directions, mixed with child humming that strange nursery rhyme. Just as my spirit was about to reach its limit, I shouted:

**TOO LATE! GOOD BOY! GO TO BED!**

I was almost roaring out. I could feel the bad sensation and pain of the vocal cords and the surrounding muscles due to the exertion.

God bless. These words really worked for him. All the sounds stopped. It was pitch black. The childish voice sounded before me:

**GIVE YOU THE BALL! DO NOT LET MOM FIND OUT!**

Unexpectedly, after the sound disappeared, I found myself standing behind the counter of the convenience store.There is no light in the store. I am very confused.

**IS IT A RIDICULOUS DREAM?**

I felt something in my arms. My eyes had gradually adjusted to the darkness, thus I could faintly make out that I held in my arms the head of a woman that her nose and ears are chipped away, shaped like a ball.
