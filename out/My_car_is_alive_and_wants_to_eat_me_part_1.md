I write this post on Sunday May 11th but It all started on Friday. I woke up and went through my daily schedule: brushed my teeth, had breakfast, said goodbye to my girlfriend. Then I got to my blue-colored Ford Focus. The doors wouldn't budge. It took a solid minute before I could finally get inside.
When I finally got to the high school where I work, I saw the familiar face of Joe—broad-faced, ginger, a bear of a man. He's also the PE teacher at the school.
“Hey Joe, good morning,” I said gleefully.

“Oh hey—whoa, did you run all the way from home today?” he asked.

“What?” I had no clue why he would say that.

“I've told you, you should get some steps in. Good on you, man.”

We talked a little more and then parted ways. I finally realized why he had said that: I was sweating buckets. It was as if I had been in a sauna.
"That's weird," I thought, but I didn’t give it much more attention.

Now I wish I had.
I went through the rest of the day. Teaching high schoolers about American history can be so taxing at times, and this day was no better. Finally, the bell rang and I was free to go. After giving my students some weekend homework and saying goodbye to the staff, I was finally ready to go home and relax.

When I got to the parking lot, I noticed that my car was not where I had parked it. That freaked me out. It's not like it had just rolled somewhere—it had been moved very cleanly from one parking space to another. Almost as if someone had picked it up and placed it to the side.
This meant one of two things: either I had parked my car where it was now, or someone was pranking me. At that point, those were still reasonable possibilities.

I sat in and got going, wanting to believe I had just misremembered.I finally realized just how hot my car was. It wasn’t a particularly hot day, and I hadn't parked in the sun. My AC was on, but I guessed it was broken. Whatever—I rolled the windows down and felt the cold breeze on my brow.

I reached home, corrected some papers. My girlfriend—her name is Jen—came home from work at about 6:30 p.m. We talked about our days, had dinner, watched a show. And right as we were about to go to bed, I heard a huge, horrendous scream—or more like a growl. It sounded like the scream of a blood-lusted animal.

So, me being the strong, manly man I am, of course I went to check it out.
Found nothing on the streets. But just as I was about to head back to bed, I noticed a low sound, like a small animal squirming. I went to the garage—and there it was. A half-eaten black cat on our garage floor, squirming and meowing weakly.

I wish it had ended there but it didn't.
