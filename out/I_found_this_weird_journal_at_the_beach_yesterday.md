Hey everyone, I was out on a walk with my dad yesterday and I stumbled upon this weird book that washed up on the beach, it's some sort of journal, but it's very weird. I'd like to post it here in case anybody knows what it's all about. It reads:

March 6, 2025

I woke up on the shore today, my head hurts. I don't remember much about how I got here or much about myself either. I think I was out fishing with my dad and we got caught in a storm. I know I'm 20 years old but I don't remember my name or what my face even looks like. It's very foggy around here, I think I'll wander into the woods nearby, hopefully I find some place to stay.

I wandered into the woods for a bit and then I found this young man, around my age. He said his name was John. John lives in a nearby town, apparently it's so small it doesn't even have a name. I explained my situation to him and he was so eager to help me, I'm so glad I stumbled upon such a good person. We got into his mustang and drove to the city, I love his car.

John drove me to the town's hospital, it was very small, only had a couple of rooms. On our way there he explained to me that the people come and go from the town all the time and that he didn't know if there would be a doctor there right now, I found that very weird. Thankfully Dr Stevens was available, it was this man in his 40s or 50s with a long beard and a balding head, he reminded me of my dad I think.

Dr Stevens examined me and he said I had a concussion. He gave me some painkillers and told me to rest for the next couple of days. After we were done, John took me to a nice little motel, he said it was free of charge for visitors, he arranged for me to get a room since my head still hurt and then left.

I think I'll go to sleep now, I'm very tired.

March 7

I woke up feeling a lot better today, I went to the toilet to wash up but there was no mirror in there, that was weird. I decided to go out to the town and explore a bit, I'd also like to find a way to go back home, I don't remember where my home was however... Maybe I'll pass by Dr Stevens to ask about my missing memory too.

Dr Stevens wasn't at the hospital today but I saw John on my way back, he looked a lot older than yesterday, a concussion can really play tricks with your mind. He invited me to his house to for lunch. I gladly accepted.

I met his wife Stella, she's pregnant with their first, I made sure to congratulate them, John has been so kind to me after all. His wive's cooking was great, I didn't want to stay for too long but they were both so welcoming that they basically forced me to stay for dinner too. When it finally got late, John offered me a ride back which I also accepted.

On our way to the motel I asked John about a way to return home, he said that the town was so small that no country bus or train passed by but that he would take me back home when I got my memories back, he really wanted a vacation.

After John left, I went back to my room to sleep.

March 8

My back was killing me when I woke up, I must've stayed in bed for hours. Honestly I didn't feel like doing anything today, I was starting to get depressed with my situation...

After some more contemplating I decided to try the hospital once more, I really had to leave, my family must be worried, if I have one.

When I got to the hospital a new doctor was there, his name was Dr Willson. I asked about Dr Stevens but I was shocked to find out he died in his sleep, the cause of death being old age. I found this really weird as he didn't look that old.

Dr Willson examined me and he said that I didn't have a concussion anymore but that he didn't know when I would get my memories back. The trauma I received was probably pretty severe... I thanked him and left to do some exploring, I didn't get to do that yesterday.

As I walked down the streets I met Stella but she was dressed in black and crying, a little girl was holding her hand, a child from her a previous marriage? I guessed, she looked about 10 years old. I asked Stella if she was okay and she told me John died this morning, he had lung cancer, he's been battling it for years but finally succumbed to it. I felt crushed, John had been so kind to me and I just learned that he died like that... I offered her my condolences. The little girl looked at me and asked me if I knew her daddy but I said no. Stella gave me a nasty look... Was John raising her and she saw him as her dad?

I got back to my motel after some more walking and went to sleep again.

March 9

I think I'm balding. I went to scratch my head and my hairline has been receeding a lot, is it because of my anxiety?? I also found a few grey hairs too. I really need to find a way to get out of here.

I decided to walk to the sore I woke up at 3 days ago, maybe it would refresh my memory. It was a long walk, I didn't realize it was that far because John drove me to the town that day. The sun was setting by the time I arrived and it was still foggy. I wandered around for a while but to no avail.

It was already dark when I got back to the town and very foggy, I felt like I was in a horror movie. I saw a bunch of people wandering the streets but noone was talking, they would knock on random doors and enter. How come is everyone returning home this late at night.

I hurried to my motel because the situation honestly freaked me out... I decided to go to sleep and maybe investigate tomorrow

March 10

I woke up with a very blurry vision today, I got so scared that I rushed to the hospital.

Dr Willson looked older than I remember him, what the stress of being a doctor does to you huh? I really should get going before I end up like him too... He did some tests and gave me a pair of glasses, I wore them and I could see perfectly again. He said it was cataracts, pretty common for my age apparently. How is cataracts common on a 20 year old?

On my way back to the motel I met a homeless man, he looked familiar... He told me that I didn't belong here and that I should leave. What does he know anyway? I'm trying to do that exact thing you know...

I waited until it got dark today and went to investigate the streets. My whole body was hurting for some reason.

I saw them again, the people, something very weird is going on. I saw the homeless man, now that I actually noticed his face, he was very old, he was running away from them. They weren't chasing him, just walking. People came from the street in front of him and behind him too. I hid behind a dumpster and watched as they circled him. It was dark so I couldn't see much, just hear his muffled screams.

I raced back to the motel and I made up my mind. Tomorrow I was leaving.

March 11

I woke up gathered all my belongings and went straight to the sore, I thought I'd find a boat there. It was already noon when I started, I slept in at the worst day possible...

I saw Dr Willson on the street, he was trying to tell me something but I ignored him. After some more walking I met two women, one was an old grandma while the other was in her 40s. Both of them looked like Stella, John's wife. They also tried approaching me but I ignored them.

I got to the sore but there is no fog today... What is this?? It's not the sea... It's a lake...

I looked down at the water and saw an old man looking back at me, wtf is going on? He wore glasses similar to the ones I wore. He had a balding head and his face was all wrinkled. Wait is that me?

The sun set and I see the full moon, I hear them calling out. I hear a lot of familiar voices, I hear the homeless man, I hear Dr Willson, I hear Stella and her daughter, I hear Dr Stevens, I hear John, I hear my dad, I hear a young 20 year old man, I'm not sure who that one is but he sounds very familiar.

I circled the lake but there is nowhere else to go, I'm tired, I see a lot of people coming my way, holding torches, lamps, flashlights. It must be hundreds of thousands of people, no millions...

I'll throw this journal into the lake, if you find this run, run, run while you're still young enough to do it. Get out of this town.

There's only these six entries on the journal. I don't really know what this is but it's a bit creepy... Tell me your thoughts down in the comments although I will probably not read them until tomorrow. Right now I'm preparing to go fishing with my dad on his boat.
