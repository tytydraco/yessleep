Leo works diligently at the locks holding the 5 prisoners. Thankfully no wards or runes are inscribed on them. That being said, the bit of wire he stripped with his teeth, makes a poor lockpick. 

The entity dragging itself down the hall takes it’s time, taunting Leo. Timbers creak as the massive thing spews threats and vitriol. 

 Leo is starting to scare me. It isn’t just the look on his face as the thing beyond the door gets closer, it’s everything about him. 

If I had a pulse to race, it would be. Being okay with dying for a cause is one thing, but staring down a violent death, miles away from making any kind of difference, that’s scary as hell. 

More so if I’m the only person with their wits about them. 

One lock pops open, the chained victim has no idea what to make of the situation. Simply dashing toward the window. 

“Don’t “ Leo says, I’m given the tiniest sliver of hope by his commanding tone, “There are at least 3 armed lunatics down there with itchy trigger fingers. You’ll be dead before you hit the ground. “

“ What’s the matter Leonard? Things not going according to plan? You started this little ruse off by shitting your pants, now it looks like you’re shitting the bed.” The entity taunts with an obnoxiously long, phlegmatic laugh. 

Leo has to close his eyes. He takes a deep breath, putting enough effort into keeping his cool veins start to rise on his neck. 

His voice doesn’t waver, his shaking stops. If it wasn’t for the fact his heart rate and pulse were displayed in my vision, I’d assume he actually pulled himself together. 

He’s not okay, but he’s doing a damn fine impression. 

The second lock pops open quicker than the first, releasing a middle aged woman with large, green eyes that seem out of place in this ugly situation. 

“A sin eater is a person or thing that through a ritual takes away bad shit you’ve done. “ Leo begins, opening the third lock nearly instantly, “ Don’t ask me why it has to eat them, but it is what it is. 

That thing out there, it’s the opposite of that. It spews out your hidden shit, flesh and blood consequences of every mistake you’ve made. “

The fourth lock opens, the small crowd listens raptly to Leo, who looks to them, picking the last lock without looking. 

I understand something then. (I know , it’s cheating when I can see what’s going on via arcane technology, but it still requires interpretation.). 

People like Leo, they aren’t just stronger, faster, or more capable of wielding the occult. It isn’t just the physical battle, or even the mystical one. 

Both Leo’s kind and the Malignant wield influence. They have a nuanced way of controlling emotion and faith.

“ And this isn’t taking into account it’s a massive bastard, like a mini-bus with a torture kink. I’m not going to sugar-coat things, if it gets in we’re fucked. 

 We have backup but at this point I don’t know if they’re coming.

I can’t promise you a happy ending, put once it works up the balls to stick it’s face in , me and Teddy Ruxpin here will buy you every second we can. “ As Leo talks, the air is charged. It’s a small, pale thing compared to the overwhelming dark energy of the bishop’s house, but it’s something. 

“I don’t even have to mock that sad little war cry. 

I wager if I offer a softer fate, I get at least one of your little band to come out of their own free will. 

I know what you’re doing Leonard, it won’t work. “ The Vomitorium (Okay, I think I might be getting good at naming things now. ) says, inching closer. 

 Leo looks out the window, when he mumbles “Fuck” I assume Flapp is still MIA. 

The tension is thick, the victims keep looking at me, I can tell they think I’m just another random horror here to kill them. I can feel how that’s making them distrust Leo. 

“Leonard, If you don’t come out here, I’m going to show you something new. “ The Vomitorium says, almost crooning. 

The door suddenly tears itself free from the hinges. The victims scream, Leo is startled, but stands firm. 

“It’s not the door holding him back it’s the ward. He’s just trying to get in your heads. 

We know it’s going to get bad you dick-shaped asshole. Let’s get on with things. “ Leo taunts. 

None of the sensors I’ve been equipped with can quite measure it, but whatever battle of will is going on between the entity and the Hero starts to intensify. 

“ They’re both part of it. This is just some kind of way to fuck with us. Look at that thing, you idiots are playing right into their hands. “ A ginger man with one eye swollen nearly shut says. 

I can almost visibly see the impact the statement has on Leo. His mojo begins to wane. 

Leo stumbles on how to reply, the other four victims become unsure. 

I stomp over to the man, letting all of the lethal blades and spines on my body whirr, and rattle. I’ve deflated ( for lack of a better term) back to the height of a toddler, but I have the man’s attention. 

JP be damned, if I ever meet my creator I’m calling out the fact the sole form of communication she gave this proxy is creepy repetition. What I say next would have sounded a lot more convincing without all of the Max Headroom meets deepfake crap. 

“I was made to kill children. I’ve done some awful things so far, but haven’t crossed that particular bridge yet. 

If I don’t, it will be because of Leo. 

If you five get out of here, it will be because of him. 

I get it, you were thrown face first into horror. Never given time to understand or adapt, and now you need to try and figure things out. 

But, the really scary shit, you can’t predict. Coming up with a random conspiracy about the only person between you and, whatever is in the hallway? That’s just being human. 

But it’s also going to get all of us killed. “ As I talk , I see a lot of confusion but no disbelief. 

The Vomitorium laughs. 

“Good save, thought things were going to get interesting there for a minute. 

Guess I’ll have to make my own fun. “ the creature says before making a horrendous gagging noise. 

I can see the terror hidden behind Leo’s hardened demeanor. He checks the window and curses again. 

With an amniotic-like burst of disgusting, flotsam ridden fluid, two human forms slide across the floor. At first I think they’re corpses, judging by the fact everyone with a nose in the room is gagging, the smell is about right. 

But slowly the two begin to rise. At first indistinct, filth ridden human shaped things, but quickly they turn into a woman in her 50’s, and a boy of about 12, both sharing a strong family resemblance with Leo. 

“Your brother left, Lenny. Off with that uncle of our’s, and you went chasing after the priest. 

We were strong as a family. That’s how Heroes work. Your brother hurt the family but, you killed it. “ Her voice hits Leo like a sledgehammer. 

From the outside, what she’s saying seems trite, especially coming from something Leo knows damn well is some kind of projection, or mimic. 

But there are forces at play no sensor can gauge. To Leo, despite all evidence to the contrary, the woman standing in front of him, is his mother. 

The crowd’s flickering flame of hope begins to falter. The shell-shocked look and fresh tears on Leo’s face not exactly inspiring confidence. 

Horror doesn’t have to be blood and guts. I know it’s a tired old cliché, but I’ll be honest. Seeing Leo broken to this point, is as terrifying as anything I’ve seen. If it’s a cliché, so be it. 

“Our death isn’t peaceful Lenny. You’ve made so many enemies, we just want rest. “ Leo’s mother wails, her tone dripping accusation. 

My mind races, sensors throw indecipherable data at me as I try and do something to try and stop this.

“ I, it’s that…” Leo stutters. 

Whatever mojo the Hero had is nearly spent. The situation becomes grim. Leo himself  is near his breaking point. 

My vision stutters, erratic random noises come from the speaker within the proxy. For a brief second I feel whatever powers this abomination I’m trapped in shut down. 

When my sight returns, I see text flashing across it. Guess I was wrong about no sensor being able to detect things. 

‘Anomaly Detected.’

I can’t help but think “No shit” as the red text starts to flash, then fade, then change. 

‘Anomalous Energy Analyzed.’

The understanding hits me like a wave, almost too much to absorb on a conscious level. But two things are clear. 

1.	We are not killing the Vomitorium. 
2.	I can help Leo. 
I see the battle of will as clear as day. In a black void of hatred and evil, small silver strands are being torn apart like spider webs in a hurricane. 

I walk forward, putting myself between Leo and the Vomitorium’s creations. 

I put my faith in the woman who made me, and whatever combination of programming and rituals is guiding me toward this insane plan. 

“You’ve been going at that ward for about ten minutes now. Jesus Christ, it took the catatonic guy two. 

I get that you’re coming in, but fuck me, getting killed by someone this bad at their job. That’s just undignified. “ As I spout this taunt, I’m glad for the speaker. The tone is harsh and confidant. A brutal combination of the speech the proxy has recorded. 

The mimics stop their mental torture, the room goes silent. I feel like every set of eyes in the world is on me. 

Those silver threads then hold still for a moment in the gale of evil. 

“Can you do anything else? Honestly curious. 

See, I’m basically a Swiss Army knife, and from what I’ve been told I’m a hunk of shit made by an idiot. 

So, don’t tell me with how hard you’re trying to seem like some kind of Lovecraft  god, all you have is bulk and guilt. “ There’s silence for a moment, then, a laugh. 

It's small, quick, and comes from a man so badly beaten he’s going to need reconstructive surgery. 

The threads stop dissolving. 

“I could show you sights that would rust your steel as well as your mind little toy. “ The Vomitorium says, dragging itself close enough to the doorway I can see claws, and the barest suggestions of a form. 

With every new piece of data our situation seems worse, that thing seems more powerful. But I don’t stop, and as I talk, I notice something.

A buried piece of programming starts to release the smallest amount of vapor from one of the tubes. A tiny, scentless puff of vapor wafts through the room. 

In quantity it’d likely put someone out, maybe even a room full of people. But the nearly homeopathic amount the proxy dispenses makes the victims calm and suggestable. 

“Don’t threaten me with a good time. Have fun explaining to me whoever the hell it is you puke up though. Fractured memories are where I live. “ As I try and buy us some time I see a tiny bit of focus return to Leo. 

He looks to me and smirks, mixed with his fear and pain is a look of curiousity. 

“Start trying bedsheets, curtains, cords, anything. Worst comes to worst, take your chances down there. If backup comes, it’ll be easier to get out without broken ankles. “ the Hero whispers.  

When Leo talks next I see those strands start to grow slightly. 

From here on out I’m not going to keep giving the play by play on the new sensor, just the highlights, I think you guys get the gist. 

“You know what this guy really is, Punch?

He’s not a demon, hell, he’s not even a malignant. 

We are looking at a legitimate closet monster. 

Most entities are known for their cunning, or their power, these fuckin’ things though, let me tell you. 

If you wrote short-man syndrome into something’s DNA, that’d be a closet monster. It’s why so many of them get killed before they are any bigger than a loaf of bread. Last time I checked the numbers, one in ten kids has actually killed one. They can be anywhere, but honestly, who cares?

It’s why when, by some god-damned miracle, one actually makes it long enough to be a threat they get so mean. 

I almost get it. Big fella, how many cousins of yours died before you failed upwards? “

The rage from the closet monster ( thanks for ruining my branding Leo) is a tangible thing. Paint peels, wood splinters and it throws itself face first into the ward. 

Grey flesh and dead, doll like eyes, a mouth big enough to swallow a grown man in the rough shape of a doorway. 

The creature drools foul liquid from it’s square toothed maw. The victims scream, their resolve almost broken by the sight of things to come.

“That hit a nerve, didn’t it. 

You were talking about how you could get one of these people to walk out on their own? 

Or as I like to call it, ‘ The played-out villain special. ‘ .

Lets flip that around.  I say one of these fine folks would sacrifice themselves for the good of the rest of us. 

See, I burn souls like nitrous, Night-slug. And maybe that’s all we need to get out of here. “ I lie. 

That part of me full of evil intent is still on the other end of the city. I have no urge to hurt any of these people, and if I did, I’d get nothing out of it than more horrifying memories. 

I bank on the Closet Monster not knowing this, and the gamble works. His focus is on Leo and myself, he doesn’t notice the victims tossing a homemade rope anchored to a dresser out of the window. 

The creature mutters curses in a dozen different languages as it redoubles its efforts on the ward. 

The energy of the barrier begins to flicker and fade. The closet monster grins. 

Leo looks to the window, his face brightens. 

“ Go, Go, Go!” he screams to the victims. 

“No way, look at that thing out there!” The green eyed woman says. 

The ward is seconds away from failing, but I take a moment to look out of the window. 

The thing in question, is Flapp, each hand buried deep in a severed head of a cult member. He waves the grim trophies like air traffic control torches. 

“Do you want an explanation, or do you want to leave, fuckin’ move!” Leo screams,  the words have a commanding force that has nothing to do with their volume. 

Mountain climbers the victims are not, but they are more than willing to get a sprained ankle or blood dripping ropeburn to make sure they all get down as quickly as possible. 

They are still climbing when the ward fails.  

The Closet monster’s seeming endless bulk snakes its way slowly into the room. As if to make it clear that the victims were never the concern.

Leo is trying his damnedest to keep things together, but cracks show in his stone-faced demeanor. 

He draws the pistol from before, it looks like a paltry toy when faced with the horror dragging itself closer to us. 

We back toward the window, still two victims left. The last man is in horrible shape, I don’t like our chances. 

As I think this, I realize accepting your fate isn’t the panacea for fear it’s made out to be. 

If I can get these people out of this slice of hell, whatever happens to me is worth it. At least in some sense I’ve balanced out the karmic scales, a little. 

But that doesn’t mean I’m looking forward to how that fate plays out. 

“ What Leo failed to mention, my foul mouthed little novelty is that my kind are excellent fleshsmiths. 

I will make you two, one creature that begs for death but is terrified of the release. You will be an abomination, my plaything for longer than you could possibly understand. “ There isn’t a hint of exaggeration in the threat. 

The last victim hits the ground running. 

Leo could take the rope down, but even dropping half way, this thing would have me by then. 

“Go.” Leo says, pointing the cheap pistol at the thing. 

He’s already had to have the ‘And I mean, go. ‘ conversation once tonight, I don’t make him have it again. 

The proxy wasn’t made for acrobatics, and this rope wasn’t made to last. But I won’t let Leo’s sacrifice be in vain. 

I give the man one last look before I take the straining rope. 

The sound is like a thunderclap. And in instantly think to hearing Leo in the bathroom, the strange prayer, the smell of fresh blood. 

That pistol, the cheap, likely stolen and misused machine fires much faster than it was ever made to. The projectiles hit with more force than is possible, blowing dinner plate sized chunks out of the Monster. And Leo has fired well over 30 shots from the 8 round clip before he slams another one home. 

The entity is hurt, enraged, and stunned. Leo throws the pistol, out the window, it’s white hot barrel instantly igniting a patch of grass. 

He's running full force, clearly expecting me to already be down the rope. 

Our descent is a tangled, painful thing, the rope slowing it just enough to escape broken legs and servos. 

“That won’t be anything more than a distraction. “ Leo says, panting as we both begin a limping jog away from the Bishop’s house. 

The creature stares at us from behind a half curtained window. At first I question why it’s not just coming after us, but I think back to JP explaining how hard it gets covering up very obvious things. 

“Aren’t you coming?” I ask Flapp, the massive bird-like thing standing in shadows gnawing on a leg. 

“Got some unfinished business here, tell Hyve I’ll catch up.” Flapp answers. 

We make it to JP, waiting a couple of blocks away. There hasn’t been many upbeat moments since I started this, but relaying our escape, and getting those people out, it felt, good. 


“Where’s Flapp?” Hyve asks a few hours later. 

I’ve put myself back into what I sadly think of as my real body. The dark thoughts are an unwelcome guest. 

“ I told you, he said he had some things to take care of. “ Leo says, impatiently, clearly being uncomfortable around Hyve. 

“Thank you for making sure we were all so well informed. “ The small, toy-like malignant says, sarcastically. 

Leo has been arguing with JP and Sveta about leaving. Kaz and I, on the other hand want to be on the first plane out. 

“For Christ’s sake Leo, it’s not just you. If you stay, sooner or later things are going to be traced back here, then it’s my ass. 

This isn’t a request. “ JP says, tone giving no room for debate. 

The conversation devolves into the kind of vulgar that can only be achieved by friends who have known each other for much too long. 

Right about as things were getting to people’s mothers, JP’s phone begins to ring. 

He angrily puts up a finger to silence Leo, “Shut the fuck up, this is probably a paying customer. 

Hello?” 

JP’s face drops, he puts down the phone, and hits speaker. 

“Hyve, you there?” I hear Flapp say, the line is distorted, I can hear light traffic in the background. 

“Yes, of course I am, you should be too. “ Hyve responds. 

“That’s the thing, I shouldn’t be, and neither should you. 

We’ve spent so long pissing about with mortals, and things that vainly call themselves horrors. 

I get it, our kind has been anything but welcoming, but look at yourself. 

You are siding with a hunter, and a Greysmith.

I’m done with this Hyve, and with every bit of my will, I hope you are as well.” The sinister but heartfelt words coming in Flapp’s grating, comical tone makes the implication all the more terrifying. 

“Fuck! I told you, we don’t go working with the god damn malignant!” Leo screams at JP. 

“I have nothing to do with this betrayal!” Hyve says defensively.

“The hell you didn’t!” JP accuses. 

The argument turns to chaos, Flapp’s laughter cuts through the din.

“Oh well, I tried. We’ve grown to close to the meat Hyve, we’ve began to feel like them. Tonight is my first step toward purging that weakness. 

It’s been a slice.” Hyve says. 

Words become exhausted, every insult has been thrown, every accusation laid bare. All the while Flapp taunts us with threats of the Bishop’s power, and promises of his mercy. 

A few seconds of silence is broken by Leo throwing a vase in a fit of impotent rage. Injury and mental fatigue make his aim poor, instead of exploding against a wall, it shatters a livingroom window. 

The noise of the splintering glass is a cacophony. A signal flare of a person who refuses to accept his fate. 

Everyone’s blood runs cold, when we hear it again, a fraction of a second later through JP’s phone speaker. 

The six of us walk over to the now shattered bay window, and we see it. 

Nothing that would stand out at first, just average cars parked on an average street. Maybe at worst it’d seem like a handful of relatives visiting a dozen homes. 

But then, many of the cars start to flick their lights on and off. Slowly, perfectly in unison. 

“We’re going to get to know each other very closely over the next few weeks, Kinder.  Hope your comfy.” The Bishop’s voice says through the phone before the line disconnects. 

“What’s going on?” I ask, understanding the basics but nothing more. 

“It’s going to be a siege. They are likely tapping into my wards as we speak. 

It’s the smartest move, make things slow, low and quiet. Starve us out, this is what I was afraid of, this is what you can do with numbers. 

Can’t call the cops, they can cause all kinds of shit, and it’s not illegal to sit in your car with some rock salt and silver shavings. 

Can’t just get the cops called here, because as you may have noticed this place basically made of ATF and FDA felonies. 

If they catch us trying to go get food, they have plenty of psychopaths willing to go to prison. 

Fuck me, fuck us.” JP says, barely above a whisper. 

And that’s where things stand. Staring down a supernatural siege, with nothing but my friends and you guys. I don’t know what we can do to pull through this time, but at least all of us are here, right? 

Let me know your ideas in the comments. 

Punch.
