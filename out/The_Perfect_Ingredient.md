You know, they never really notice the small details. People are so caught up in their little lives, rushing from one place to another, worrying about things that don't matter in the end. No one cares about the people who disappear. Especially if they don’t fit the picture of what society calls ‘beautiful.’

Let me tell you a story. My story.

I’ve always had a fascination with beauty—what makes someone truly radiant. It’s not the makeup or the surgeries or the photoshopped images everyone obsesses over. No, it’s something much deeper, something hidden beneath layers of skin.

But they—the women society overlooks—had no idea. They thought they were invisible, unworthy, unlovable. Heavyset, curvaceous, they carried their burdens in more ways than one. But I saw them. I saw the potential in them.

At first, I didn’t know what I was searching for. I wandered, lost, just another ghost in the crowd. Until one day, I stumbled upon it by accident—the answer to eternal beauty. The right mix of ingredients, the perfect combination that no lab, no factory could ever create. Something raw, natural. You see, it’s not the fat itself. It’s what it *becomes*.

My first subject, I found her on the outskirts of town. She was waiting for the bus, staring at the ground like she was ashamed to exist. Her body was perfect for my experiment. Voluptuous, soft. The kind of figure society mocks and sneers at. But I knew better. I could make something exquisite from her despair.

She never saw me coming.

In my workshop, hidden beneath the earth where no one could hear the screams, I set to work. The smell of blood and oils mixed together, filling the space with something both revolting and intoxicating. I was nervous at first. But once I peeled back the layers—literally—I knew I was onto something extraordinary.

It didn’t take long for the first batch to be ready. A soap, pure and smooth, so luxurious you wouldn’t believe what it was made of. Her flesh became something else entirely. Beautiful. Desirable. I even tested it on my own skin, watching as the lines of time faded, as my complexion became brighter, clearer. She had given me a gift, and she didn’t even know it.

I sold my first bar to a boutique downtown. They had no idea what they were buying—just that it worked like nothing else on the market. It flew off the shelves. The more I made, the more they craved it. The soap, the serums—they became a sensation, a hidden secret among those seeking perfection. They’d never guess. They just wanted to be beautiful.

But beauty, you see, is a currency, and I’ve perfected how to trade in it. Those women, they were never appreciated for what they truly could be. Society mocked them, ignored them, made them feel small. But in my hands, they became something more.

They became...useful.

Do you know how easy it is to find the next one? They always sit alone, trying to make themselves smaller, hoping no one notices them. But I do. I always do. They’ve become part of something greater now. Something the world craves, though it doesn’t even realize it.

You might be wondering if I feel remorse. Guilt, perhaps? No. Not at all. I’m giving them the chance to be part of a legacy. They become the very thing they always wanted to be—desired, cherished, needed. Isn’t that what everyone longs for?

So, if you ever feel the smooth glide of an unfamiliar soap on your skin or notice your reflection looking a little too radiant after using that new serum, remember this: beauty has a price. And someone, somewhere, paid it.

Who knows? Maybe one day, you’ll be next. After all, perfection is hard to come by. And I’m always looking for the next perfect ingredient.
