tw: Mutilation, Suicide

I was staying with a group of friends in a cabin one of them inherited from a dead uncle in Oregon. I was hiking with them to a nearby outlook of a lake. When we got there, one of my friends said that "I'm never going to let them get me." He then proceeded to tell me I should join him and that I don't know what they can do. He then climbed up onto the railing and jump, falling 500 feet.

I was very distraught, but no one reacted. I asked them if they saw what happened and that our friend just killed themself. They responded with "who is \_\_\_?" I wanted to get out of there and never come back, but they insisted that I stay so I trusted them and hiked back to the cabin. When we walked in it smelled terrible, and there was a dead mostly naked man with a hole in his head and my name splattered in blood on the wall.

My friend took the liberty of disposing the body and cleaning up the blood. I couldn't sleep that night. The stench still filled the cabin, I don't know what caused it, but the next morning I decided, fuck staying here, I'm getting the fuck out of here. So I took the keys to our car, a 1976 Ford Bronco and took off.

I drove for like 20 minutes in the dark when I saw a hitchhiker. I was freaked out of my mind by the past few days, but I decided to help the poor man. I pulled over and let the man in the car. He told me "Take me somewhere far away from this place." So I kept going on my path back to civilization. After about 20 minutes of driving I closed my eyes for a moment and woke up  limp in the back of the car with the hitchhiker driving. I closed my eyes again and woke up at a strangely modern building. When we stopped the hitchhiker froze and in a flash a bony creature broke the drivers window and pulled him out.

When I couldn't see the creature I climbed up to the driver's seat and drove the fuck out of there. I reached the highway I was on and made a beeline to Salem. When I got to my apartment building the person at the front desk as surprised I was there as he read in an article that I died in a mass suicide in some cabin in the wilderness.

When I got to my room I slept for 18 hours and had dreams where I went back to the cabin and looked at the dead bodies. It was brutal, their insides coated the floor, and I looked into the eyes of a mutilated version of me. I've been trying to go to therapy, but no one is willing to help me. I feel like everyone stares at me, like I'm not supposed to be there. Just last night I had a dream where my friend's uncle raped all the dead bodies there, and then he stared at me with a wide smile. What should I do?
