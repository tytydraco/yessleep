It was after midnight, when it all began. I was still at the studio, working overtime. We had a massive project coming up, and I had spent the past few nights tackling some of the trickier animations. Nothing out of the ordinary. 

Then, a *ping* \- an email notification broke the silence.

I wasn't expecting anything, especially at that hour. Figured it was probably just spam, but curiosity got the better of me.

The subject line read, *"Remember me, Rachel?".*

No body text. Just an attached image. 

It came from someone called ***"Gareth, A."***

I had no clue who that was. Never heard the name, but it struck an uncanny chord within me. Against my better judgment, I clicked it open.

The photograph that appeared on my screen froze me in my chair. It was an old polaroid photo, maybe from the late 90's. I was in it - six or seven years old, in a park. The details were fuzzy, but I recognized the striped t-shirt I used to wear all the time.

*But it wasn't just me.*

Standing behind me in the photo was a boy in a bright, *orange* coat. His face was turned toward my back, watching as I was on the swing - eyes pale blue, so light they were almost white. They looked off.  Not just because of their strange color, but because they seemed to *stare through the photo.* 

It was like he wasn't looking at the camera, but at me right now.

His smile wasn't wide, not quite. It was more of a faint smirk, but it felt wrong. The corners of his lips were slightly uneven, one side tugged higher than the other. His cheeks were hollow, his skin bloated, but stretched too tight over his face, giving him an almost deathly appearance. 

*A chill ran down me. He looked like a drowned corpse.*

I forced myself to look away from his face and back to myself in the photo. My expression was just strange - frozen, stiff and to my own thoughts, if I had any. My small hands gripped the swing's chains so tightly they looked bloodless.

I stared at the portrait, my heart racing. Who was he? I couldn't remember ever knowing a boy who looked like him, nor named *"Gareth"* (as the sender's name suggested). But something about his face, *felt familiar*. 

And the way he was looking at me, it wasn't just watching. It was like he was waiting.

I shut the application. This wasn't worth my midnight oil.

I thought to myself - maybe it was an old friend trying to play some uncanny prank? 

Getting *rid* of it would be a *good idea.*

I reopened the email, hovering my cursor over the photo for a second longer. As I tried to move it to the trash icon, it began to behave erratically. 

It wasn't moving where I wanted it to. After a struggle of what felt like wrestling against an invisible force, I managed to delete the mail.  

**Problem solved. Out of sight, out of mind.**

Or so I thought.

I tried to throw myself back into work. The animations weren't going to finish themselves.

As I tried to navigate to the *assets* folder to import the new models into a scene I was working on, the cursor misbehaved. In moments, it froze in place. 

I clicked, shook it - but it didn't respond.

Soon, my screen began to flicker. I groaned and leaned back in my chair, rubbing my temples. Maybe the system was just overheating. I was pushing it *hard* tonight.

The flickering got worse. Jagged streaks of static ripped across the screen, distorting the monitor. 

*"No, no, no... "* I panicked, only hoping I had saved the work I had been working on for so long that night.

The screen died momentarily, but it sprung back in a flash. 

It felt like a temporary crash, and everything went back to normal again. Anxious about my saved progress, I opened the engine only to find it was all gone. 

Not a trace. My *assets* folder was corrupted too - and all the media I had imported went missing.

*Another ping, another e-mail.* 

The subject read, ***"It's hard to forget what's lost."***

The email application opened *by itself.* 

I didn't like this. Not one bit. I wanted to shut the system down, but I had to log out before I did that.

I couldn't tear my eyes away from the screen.

It had a *body* this time. 

It read:

***"You never acknowledged me, Rachel.*** 

***You never remembered.*** 

***But I always remembered you.***

***You knocked my head off, Rachel.***

***That was not very nice of you.***

***You left me there, in the cold.***

***I didn't know how to swim.*****"**

Attached was a photo I couldn't bear to look at for too long. The water was dark and still, and in the center of the frame, a *bloated, lifeless* body of a small boy in an orange coat, faced down, floating in a canal.

The canal, was a familiar one; exactly the one which was behind my childhood neighborhood in the nearing woods. 

The text continued,

***"I'm close, Rachel.***

***I'm right here.***

***You'll find me soon.*** 

***For when we meet again;***

***Don't forget to wave and smile -***

***Even if you cannot see me,***

***But feel me close."***

The photo seemed to ripple, as though the water within it had begun to move. My breath caught in my throat, and I shook my head, willing the image to make sense. 

But it didn't, and I had enough.

I couldn't take it anymore. I slammed the laptop shut and yanked the power cord out of the wall.

Fuck protocol. I didn't care.

Grabbing my bag, I bolted out of the studio.

Rushing through the lot, I frantically sat in my car - swinging the doors shut behind me with a loud clang. 

The night air was thick and heavy, almost suffocating. The overhead lights in the parking lot flickered sporadically.

As I turned on the ignition, I finally caught a breath. *"Get a grip,"* I whispered to myself.

The engine sputtered to life, and I pulled out of the lot.

At the first red light, I slumped back in my seat, letting out a shaky breath. The street was empty, eerily quiet. 

After almost a minute of waiting - the light finally turned green, and I began to move. 

That's when I heard it - a faint, unmistakable whisper; ***"Rachel?"*** \- childish, soft, and coming from my passenger seat.

It took me by surprise, and my movements almost froze. I was foolish enough to look in the rear view mirror at the passenger's seat as I drove away, hands on the wheel.

A loud, blaring horn of a truck approaching by my side snapped me back to reality. It was a near miss, and I would have crashed had I not paid the little attention I did.

My car swerved, tires screeching as I pulled over to the side of the road. 

I looked over at the passenger seat, and it was *empty*.

I drove off, unable to get my mind off everything that was bothering me.

When I finally made it home, I was too rattled to do anything but lock the door behind me and lean against it, trying to steady myself.

There was a mossy, deathly stench by the lounge near the kitchen.  I shrugged it off as *trash* I forgot to throw away. 

I was very exhausted. I needed to get some sleep.

I double checked all the locks and decided to hit bed, shutting off all the lights behind me.

Despite feeling head in hands, I did not feel drowsy. Not drowsy at all, especially after everything that happened that night.

I climbed into bed, pulling the blanket up to my chin. My mind refused to rest.

Finally, just as sleep began to claim me, a piercing wail shattered the silence. 

The smoke detector. 

I bolted upright, heart pounding - the sound dissonant and warped. It sounded usual at first, but then it slowly grew into what was like a *tormented child's screaming.*

It was ugly to hear. **Too ugly**. It grew louder and louder, until the detector finally crashed to the floor.

Covering my ears, I stumbled into the living room in the darkness, where the sound was the loudest - churning into what now sounded like a symphony of shrieking, painful laughter.

The dissonant cries died out.

Above the receding, shrill wails, I heard; rather felt footsteps.

Rapid, wet stomping, like boots sloshing through puddles. 

And *giggling.*

The sound was faint, and now I think I heard it coming from the bathroom.

*"Who's there?!"* I shouted, my voice trembling, trying to gather courage.

The giggling just stopped. An uneasy silence after the chaos.

I did not dare to go to my bedroom. I knew there was something very wrong inside the flat.

Just then, I realized the faucet inside the bathroom had been on all this while. I could hear the faint rush of water fill the bathtub gradually. 

I could see the light switch on from under the bathroom door. It slowly began to creak open. 

It was the sole source of light in the pitch-black darkness of my apartment.

My heart sank. I could see the water overflow from the tub, and a very disturbing sight before my eyes.

The pale, lifeless corpse of the child in the orange coat slowly arose from the splashing water in the bathtub.

His skin was shriveled and wrinkled, face pale and bloated, eyes bloodshot - as if he had fallen asleep under water with his eyes open for years. 

His lips curled into that smirk from the photo earlier. But it grew wider this time, a *smile*.

It seemed as if he had seen a distant friend after a long time. 

And then, he *waved* \- mechanically, almost *like a puppet*.

The boy began to move, crawling out of the tub, limbs twisting eerily.

He stood up, his small frame soaked in a wet, orange coat. He croaked in a low, rasping voice - drowned in gurgling breaths forcing its way out, ***"Smi..le.. fo-rr me, Ra..chhel!"***

I stumbled back, but before I could react, the bathroom door slammed shut with a deafening crash.

The sound echoed through the apartment, leaving me in the suffocating darkness.

For a heartbeat, nothing happened. It was dead silent.

Then, the footsteps beganâ€”wet, rapid, pounding toward my bedroom.

I turned as now my bedroom door closed shut, as if something behind it did so deliberately. The lock slowly clicked from the inside.

And from behind the door, I heard it; *soft, playful* giggling. 

*Like a child, playing a game of hide and seek.*
