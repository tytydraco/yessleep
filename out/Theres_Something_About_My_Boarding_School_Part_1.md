When you come from a town like mine, alcoholism is pretty common. *We’re unsurprised, but it’s not unexpected,* as the guidance counselor had put it to my mom. *Have you thought about getting Tommy professional help?*

At first, my drinking was innocuous. Beers with friends, swiped from somebody’s old white fridge in their garage. But by the fall of senior year, I was bringing vodka to school in a water bottle. Always drunk. I never told my friends, but I knew they had me figured out. The stench of liquor on my breath, the way I would be slurring my words by lunch.

The cop who pulled me over that night was a friend of my dad's. Not a good enough friend to let me go, though. Just tightened the handcuffs and said “Sorry, son. You blew a 0.16.”

When I told Lucas that story, he didn’t even look up from his desk– just kept erasing what he had written. The paper crumbled under him, and he huffed loudly before ripping another sheet from his notebook.

“A DUI,” he snorted in disbelief, glancing over his shoulder. “They put you in here for drunk driving? It’s not like you killed anyone.”

Lucas said he grew up in Charleston. I imagine he had one of those all-American childhoods: wrap-around porches, cicadas chirping on summer nights, sailing lessons. A frat house just waiting for him at Clemson.

Anyone else here would’ve shamed me. *Selfish bastard*, my dad had shouted at me through the streaked plexiglass at the police station downtown. *This is the last thing I wanted out of you.*

But not Lucas. He just gave me an awkward smile, like we were high school buddies exchanging stories about why we got detention.

Our room is small, with battered wood furniture and yellow fluorescent lights. The window would be grand– it’s springline, arched, like it’s meant to contain stained glass– but it’s barred from the outside by iron bars. Like I’d have the nerve to jump out of the third story, anyway.

Lucas’ side is sparsely decorated: navy sheets, a flag that reads something misogynistic and obscene. There’s a record player on his windowsill; he has The Beach Boys on vinyl.

“Why are you here?” I ask.

It’s hard to imagine him getting a DUI. Not because he doesn’t drink– the guy looks like he was conceived at a kickback– but because he had that old money look about him, the kind of look that made cops go easy on you.

“The dining hall closes in thirty minutes,” Lucas tells me. I take the hint.

When I step outside, I’m met with a labyrinth of identical doors and narrow hallways. Each is lined with dark panels and red, threadbare carpet. The air is damp, almost stale, intermingled with the sharp scent of wood polish.

As I walk, the silence presses in around me, broken only by the soft shuffle of my shoes and the occasional creak of the old building settling. A window here and there offers brief glimpses of the outside world, which currently is no more than that inky, five-o’-clock type of darkness.

It was about the same time of day as the meeting that had damned me here. Frankly, I would’ve rather gone to jail.

I can still feel the cold in that room, the way that cheap plastic chair pressed into my back. It’s the kind that sticks to your thighs in the summer and makes your hair stick up in the winter.

This was the second time I’d gotten in trouble with the police. The first time, they found me smoking weed in the woods behind school. Michael still blames it on our white lighter, but we both got off with a few hundred hours of community service and a fat fine.

I wasn’t sure this was something that would be forgotten with community service.

My parents were sitting across from me. Dad was rubbing his hands together, his eyes darting between me and Officer Collins, the cop who’d pulled me over.

Collins stood there, brows furrowed. For a second, I thought he might crack a joke, the same way he used to about how tall I was getting. *Tommy, you try out for basketball yet? Coach Beeson could always use another guy like you.* But he didn’t.

“Thomas,” my dad finally muttered, rubbing his palms over his eyes.

I cringed at the name. I was *Mijo* to him. *Tommy*, if he was angry. The only other time I’ve heard the name *Thomas*, I was also in a police station.

“You’re going to ruin your life if you keep doing this. Do you want us to come bail you out of jail every time you decide to act like a delinquent?”

I didn’t say anything.

Officer Collins cleared his throat. The sound was too sharp, too loud. Fake. “You’re lucky it wasn’t worse,” he said. “If you had been going a little faster, had a little more to drink–”

He cut himself off, realizing that the image of me actually killing someone wasn’t something my dad needed to hear. Instead, he slid a manila folder across the table. “This is your court order.”

“You need help, Tommy,” my mom managed in between sobs, her voice thin and fragile. Her lips pressed together. “You’re not the same. You’ve changed. Ever since you met that boy Michael…”

“Me and Micheal aren’t friends anymore, mom,” I growled, trying to defend myself, though I’m not sure how it actually helps.

I wanted to say something in my defense. I wanted to go home, punch a hole through my mattress. I imagined being able to stop time. First, to run away from this mess. Then, maybe, once I’ve reached Mexico or the Maldives or Bora Bora, I would just leave it frozen forever and spend the rest of my days lounging in a hammock and drinking Mai Tais.

Instead, I just stared at the folder in front of me. I zone out. The edges blur, blending in with the table. In and out of focus. In, out. In, out.

“Because Tommy is still a minor, they’re willing to let him go to rehab instead of jail. There’s a nice one about an hour away. Think of it as a sort of therapeutic boarding school. The details are in here,” Collins taps the folder.

“I’ll give you three a moment to discuss the possibility. He’ll still have to appear in court, but this would keep the DUI off his record.” Collins nodded at my dad, then turned and walked out without another word.

The door clicked shut behind him, and we were left alone in that cold room.

Wandering through the maze of dark hallways, it was hard to forget what had happened. Hard to forget where I was– these were not the dark neighborhoods of shuttered white houses back home. The crumbling asphalt roads and *Jesus Saves* signs. No. The eeriness of this school was a permanent reminder of what I had done.

I must have taken the wrong staircase at some point, because I find myself standing on a walkway overlooking an oratory.

I bend over the wooden railing, peering into the candle-lit expanse below. Shadows flicker on the walls, curling into forgotten corners where the light doesn’t reach. The air is thick with the smell of mildew and something sweetly decayed– rotten magnolias, I think. The pews themselves are empty, crumbling in the aisles.

Empty, except for one. In the darkness, a figure moves. It’s half-formed, like smoke swirling in the dim light, or my mind playing tricks, making shadows dance where none should. It’s hunched over in prayer– a whispered and broken hallelujah. But not to the deity that beckons from the altar. It’s praying to *me*.

A voice jolts me out of my trance. But it isn’t the creature stirring in the pews. Rather, it’s just a doe-eyed girl. Another student. No– another girl in rehab.

She wraps a strand of hair around her finger and twirls it as she looks at me– it’s thick, black, and most certainly dyed. Yes, she looks like she belongs here.

“Lost?” she purrs.

“Yeah,” I reply, dumbly.

She steps aside, revealing a darkened stairwell leading down. “The dining hall’s this way,” they say. “You’ve got ten minutes.”

I nod and turn to leave, but not before I ask: “What room is this?”

The girl glances at me with a soft smile, almost too polite, before brushing her hair out of her face. “Room?” Her eyes flicker briefly to the oratory below, then back to me. “I think the place speaks for itself, don’t you?”

Before I can respond, she glides away, leaving the question hanging in the air like an unanswered prayer.
