Deep violet had already chased the sun out of the sky by the time we pulled up to the trailhead. Crickets filled the cool summer air with their chorus, and a faint breeze played in the canopy of aspens.

A three mile hike stood between us and our campsite, all but guaranteeing the bulk of our trek would be in the dark.

I suggested sleeping at the car, and starting early the next day. This was mountain lion territory after all; they liked to prowl in the evening.

My friends insisted we press on anyway.

“We’ll just keep talking, and stay together,” Curt said. “They only pick off stragglers.”

And so we went, making idle chit chat to ward off any possible predators. Deep in the mountain valley, night didn’t fall so much as our visibility range dwindled, until I could scarcely see beyond the edge of the path.

Snapping twigs and rustling brush punctuated the brief gaps in our conversation. At first I paid it little mind; most wildlife wanted nothing to do with us. But as the hours crept on and the other sounds of the forest faded away, I found my body tensing up with each creeping footstep in the dark.

After a particularly loud crack, I whipped around my headlamp searching for the source of the noise. My light fell on a hideous sight, just beyond the tree line. It looked like an enormous buck—one that had just climbed out of a tar pit, dripping with black ichor. Sickly gray skin clung tight to an emaciated frame. What little fur hadn’t fallen off looked greasy and matted, sprouting like clumps of weeds from the pale gray hide.

“John?” Millie called from ahead of me.

“Yeah?” I turned my light forward, to find my friends were almost out of sight, up the trail. 

How long had I been looking away?

“Keep up—or you’re cougar food!”

I cast another glance between the trees. The deer was gone.

After four hours of walking, we made camp beside a snow melt lake.

I kindled the fire, tending to it long after my friends retired to their tent. Each time the flames fell low, a pair of red eyes danced in the dark, glowing like embers. When I added another log, the presence would retreat from view.

Despite the urgency I felt in my vigil, exhaustion eventually overtook me.

“John!” Curt shook me awake by the shoulders. “Millie is gone—did you see her?”

I jumped to my feet.  “How long has she been gone?” How long had I been out?

“Can’t have been longer than an hour since—” He grabbed my arm and froze. “Wait...listen.”

On strained ears, I heard the sloshing footsteps in the distance. Someone was wading through shallow water. *The lake!*

We raced each other down the embankment until we caught a glimpse of Millie. She stood a dozen or so feet from the shoreline, pale skin glowing in the moonlight. The inky water lapped at her thighs, reflecting none of the night sky above.

“Millie!” Curt hollered. She turned to look up at us for a moment before a second hulking figure came into view. My heart stopped when I recognized the shape as the same gray-skinned creature from farther down the trail. The beast stood on two legs and cast us a disapproving look with those hateful red eyes. It placed an almost protective hoof on her shoulder and led her deeper into the water.

Curt called her name again, making a mad dash for the water’s edge. But Millie had turned her back to us, walking deeper until the crown of head head disappeared beneath the surface. The animal’s antlers vanished shortly after in a scurrying series of tiny ripples.

My friend and I yelled ourselves hoarse, splashing around for close to an hour as we searched. No matter how far from the shoreline we ventured, we found the water to be crystal clear--never much deeper than chest height.

When we ran for help, the Sheriff didn't believe our version of events. Who would? Curt and I spent days in a cell until a search party could fully dredge the lake. Once they determined we hadn’t drowned her, deputies brought in cadaver dogs. This search too turned up nothing.

Millie Palmer simply vanished that night.

But the creature shepherding her into the depths didn’t.

It checks in on me often, on secluded trails or empty city streets; the location seems not to matter so long as it’s sufficiently dark, and there’s water somewhere nearby. Each sighting, my pursuer grows closer, bolder.

My questions grow as well.

If I’d let the fire die, would it have taken me that night instead? And what will happen the day it finally catches me [alone in the dark?](https://www.coleschapters.com)
