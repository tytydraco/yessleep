My name is Jake (fictional character), I’m 14 years old and I live in a small, suburban neighbourhood. It’s not that Big but definitely not small. I live with my parents and my older brother, Who is moving out in a couple months. Sometimes, I don’t feel like things are fair. He’s the older brother and he gets a bedroom almost double the size of my, tiny, cramped up room.

We recently moved in, and let’s say I’m not a huge fan of our neighbours. They’re rude, selfish and not very grateful. Our neighbour is an old man, he is around 70 years old. I’ve never seen anyone else living in there. Well, other than their horrifyingly vicious dog. I never learned the dog’s name, but almost everybody in the neighbourhood is horrified of it. Our neighbour doesn’t care at all about the dog. Half the time it’s on the other side of the neighbourhood, randomly strolling. Which is why I barely ever go outside.

Last week, in the middle of the night, I heard howling. This is normal, the dog does it every night. But this time it was louder and more distorted. Like it was coming from an entity, or a werewolf. Not a dog. When I looked out the window, I saw the dog staring at me with blank, glowing white eyes. It had a smile, so menacing, it was almost uncanny. I told my parents about this and they thought the same thing as me: That dog was weird.

It’s to the point we’re the dog is even killing other pets. I heard from my friend Marcus (fictional character), who lives down the street, the dog killed one of his neighbours pet bunnies. He said it had blood all over its mouth and it started... Smiling. Today I finally built up the courage to tell my parents, “Mum, Dad, we have got to do something! I mean it freaks me out, can’t we write a complaint? Or Tell the police?“

“You’re absolutely right, but I’ve heard the poor dog is mentally unstable and timid. We have complained about it before and the neighbour is using a muzzle on his dog… sometimes.” My dad replies.

”it’s either that, or a skinwalker.” I say. The next afternoon I try to ride my scooter over to the park near my house. I try as hard as I can to avoid the neighbours dog, and for the most part, it works out. Until I hear it… a loud growl, mixed in with a screech. I turn around, the dog on my tail. It isn’t chasing me, but staring at me weirdly. But it looks different than before, its legs seem to have stretched or grown. Its teeth are sharper, its gums, pulled back. Its tongue is longer. Ears stretched back. I check the time on my phone, 4:30pm.

I decide not to continue riding, and get home early. So I ride all the way back, trying not to look scared, even though I am. When I arrive home, I lock all the doors and shut the blinds.

When dinner comes by, I finally tell everyone. “I think something is seriously messed up about our neighbours dog. Not like a mental illness like something worse. I don’t know, maybe a real skinwalker! Or an unknown disease or something.” Everybody at the dinner table stares at me.

”Skinwalkers aren’t real, you’re fourteen, grow up. The dog is just like sick or like diagnosed with something. Maybe rabies? I don’t know.” My brother says replying to me.

After dinner it feels weird trying to sleep. I search stuff up on my phone about this issue. Or what it might be causing this. Most of it is videos of people recording strange looking dogs and saying they are monsters or skinwalkers.

As the next day comes by, I try to be as positive as possible. But it’s harder than it seems, I got barely any sleep due to that stupid dog. “How was last night? did you sleep well?” My mum asks as I sit down on a chair. I mumble, not being able to come up with a detailed answer.

The same afternoon, it’s 4:30pm and I need to get to my basketball match. I say goodbye to my parents and start walking there, and the evening goes well for the most part. I hang at the place for about 3 hours, shooting hoops with friends. Finally it’s time for my mum to pick me up. But she doesn’t. I wait around 20 minutes, before starting to walk home. Usually when she can’t pick me up, I walk home. So I text her that I’m coming. No response.

As I approach the house, I spot the front door is wide open. I start sprinting and when I get there, I’m shocked. I call out for my parents, but no response. Instead I see a large horrifyingly familiar dog in front of me. Blood dripping from its mouth. It smiles so wide, its eyes glow white. It stands up on its front legs. Standing at around 6 feet tall. Its body stretches. It reveals it’s true from, and it’s facial features get even more human like. I try to run… but it got to me first.
