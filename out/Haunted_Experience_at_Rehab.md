Finally decided to share. So went to rehab when I was 30 (38f now). Obviously was a hard time to start but got easier after a while. But I remember in the beginning I had a room by myself because I was still really sick which made me a horror to be around in general and part of that was me not being able to sleep… like at all… all night long. I wouldn’t even waste my time trying to sleep. They had 24 hour security not far away from my room so I felt safe enough and would just stay up all night listening to music and…. Painting. I had this overwhelming urge to paint and I’ll admit painting my feelings out brought me some serious much needed relief and comfort albeit not exactly a cure all for what I was going through but at that point any slight relief was so welcome.

Anywho I had no real agenda I would just paint whatever came to mind, nothing fancy of course- no painting talent. Well I started giving my crappy but heart felt paintings away to other patients just to try and get a smile on some faces and it was weird because, well, one in particular I gave away I remember the other patient was like “woah, it’s like you read my mind, like you painted exactly what I’ve been doing/thinking lately, that’s so crazy” genuinely blown away. Ok, that’s not that crazy but it happened with like 3 other paintings it was kinda weird. We all agreed but not weird enough to be disruptive or anything.

Ok so I get a roommate eventually, obviously, that’s the way it goes. And she’s hella super cool. Just like me. Free spirit we get along famously. But totally different but totally the same. Definitely a long lost friendship feeling. Again, no biggie. Ok here’s weird stuff. And believe you me, I thought she was haunted but I don’t know if her or me or what but!

Ok so same time ish every night I wanna say just after 3 I’d wake up. And be like… ‘in the bubble’ I call it. Like not awake but not asleep. Can’t move. But don’t need to move. So then why wake up? Type thing. Ok whatever that happens everyday for like a week but then… waking up in the morning with BOTH of our blankets on the ground. I mean all of them, so totally exposed and cold and 2 big piles of blankets on the ground. 

THEN one night… ok so I do fall out of bed sometimes. Always have. Don’t ask me why but then one night we both fell out of bed I remember climbing back into bed like whatever but in the morning I look over to find my roommate waking up on the floor! I didn’t even think of checking to see if she had also fallen out of bed during the night because well why would I?

Anywho I should just mention that on 2 occasions 2 different people randomly came into our room just to say hi or whatever at separate times on separate days and both remarked something along the lines of like: “woah! It feels awesome in here!” And me being like: “wait, what do you mean” … them: “I dunno like it just feels good! Like, nice, and happy, and warm and inviting” etc etc… things of that nature. I’m not explaining this right but like almost as if the energy was on a different plane of existence or something. Something you could feel hit you when you walked through our doorway. 

Anywho there’s other crazy stuff that took place there and yeah this stuff is minor but I figured I’d start small I have other experiences if anyone cares just thought I’d throw this out there!
