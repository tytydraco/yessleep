My wife and infant son died in a house fire a few months ago. It was set by some serial arsonist who has yet to be caught. While they were sleeping, he went around with a drill, screwing the doors and windows shut before pouring gasoline over the entire perimeter of the house.

I was away on work. I should have been with them- either to find a way to free them, or to die with them. And yet, I wasn’t. I can just hope they died quickly from suffocation and carbon monoxide.

We buried the charred remains of their bodies a week later in a closed casket funeral. People came from all over town to give me their condolences. None of it mattered. I was alone, and those who brought me happiness and meaning were now dead.

I couldn’t sleep anymore. Every time I did, I saw my wife and child being burned alive, screaming in agony, reaching out their hands towards me as their skin melted off their bodies. It was so real- I could see the little drops of fat that ran down my wife’s nose, beads of liquid fire that fell in front of her onto the scorched floorboards of the house. My son would be in his crib, his small, helpless body writhing and shaking from side to side as his mouth opened into a little O of pain. His blackened hands would clench, relax, clench and relax, opening and closing, the flames licking his pillows and wooden crib, his snugly wrapped clothes and blanket being burnt off his body. I would wake up screaming.

I tried everything I could think of to stop these horrid nightmares- prescription sleeping pills, opiates, meditation, cannabis and much else besides. Some of them helped me fall asleep, but they never stopped the visions that plagued me every night. They never stopped me from waking up screaming in horror, tears streaming down my face as I whispered their names over and over.

It got so bad after a couple months that I began to contemplate suicide. A choice that I would have never considered earlier in my life now seemed like the only way to stop the suffering. I thought maybe we could all be together again if I were dead: a happy, reunited family in Heaven. I began to look up painless ways to end it all, ultimately settling on a high-caliber shot to the brainstem. I immediately started applying for a long gun permit so I could buy a 12-gauge shotgun and boxes of slugs.

I hadn’t gone back to work since the arson, so I was living off savings. It was a beautiful day, and I went back to the charred remains of my house where our lives had all come to an end. I hadn’t been here once since their deaths.

Slamming the car door behind me, stepping out onto the sizzling pavement, I felt the warmth of the sun on my face. I tilted my head back with my eyes closed, smiling, feeling good for the first time in a long time. I knew my suffering would soon be over, and that gave me extra energy and hope in a perverted kind of way. 

I walked around the charred framework of the house, the smell of charcoal and scorched plastic and melted insulation still heavy in the air. The wrecking crew was supposed to come tomorrow so that a new house could be constructed. I certainly wasn’t worried about that; I wouldn’t be around to see it finished anyways.

From behind the house, I saw a flash of something white and twisted-looking. At first, I thought it was an out-of-season Halloween decoration. But as I looked closer, I realized it was a person.

It looked in general form like a woman, but not like any woman I had ever seen. Her skin appeared dead and lifeless, totally pale with dark black bruises randomly interspersed throughout her body. Most of the skin around her mouth had been eaten away, exposing very straight, very white teeth that seemed to leer at me in a perpetual smile. Blood-soaked rags were wrapped around her body, covering up her naked, torn body in some places. Parts of her scalp still had stringy, disgusting strands of black hair, but the rest were worn down to the skull, showing the clean white bone underneath.

“Excuse me?” I said. “Are you… OK?” My heart was thundering in my chest, and part of my mind instantly told me what a stupid question that was. Of course she was not OK. Half of her face was missing.

And yet, I realized suddenly, there was no blood. There were no stitches or signs of surgical intervention, so blood should have been pouring from the ragged stretches of skin left remaining on her bottom jaw and upper cheekbones.

She opened her mouth to say something, and I realized her tongue was also missing. I moved a few steps closer, and now I could see countless tiny insects wriggling in her blackened, rotting gums, eating her alive and laying their eggs in her ravaged flesh.

“Are you… OK?” she said back to me, trying to repeat the question I had asked her, except it came out like a gurgling, slurring sentence. Then she laughed, a horrifying phlegmy sound that grated on my eardrums. 

I backed up then, turning around to run. Isn’t it odd, I thought to myself, that someone who wants to die would run from danger? I don’t know what part of my subconscious mind that thought came from, but I realized it was right. My logical thinking overcame my instinctual fears. I stopped, turning back to the woman.

“Who are you?” I asked. At this, her dead eyes sparkled.

“They call me… the Pale One,” she said slowly. It was amazing how she could speak at all, I thought. How can she speak without a tongue or lips? But then another part of my mind asked the more important question- how can she even be *alive* at all?

“OK,” I said. “My name is Edgar. This is my property. What do you want?” She moved closer to me, her joints creaking, tiny maggots falling from her skull and mouth as she walked.

“I want… to help,” she said. She pointed at the corner of the burned-down house. “I left you… a present.” With that, she began laughing again, falling backwards on her emaciated and bruised legs. As if in slow motion, I watched her body dissolving. Her head disconnected from her torso, strips of flesh falling off her legs and chest and disappearing into the grass. Within seconds, she had vanished. Her entire body had come apart and been sucked into the high, unmowed grass. I ran over, looking down, but there wasn’t a single trace of the body that had been there.

Except for, of course, the maggots, flies and other various insects that squirmed in a pile where she had fallen.

“Wow,” I said to no one. “I am absolutely fucking losing it.” An imaginary checklist appeared in my mind: Suicidal thoughts- check. Hallucinations- check. Crippling depression- check. Isolation and loss of friends- check.

I walked to the corner of the house where she had pointed, the wall having fallen out during the fire and the resulting collapse of the structure. I caught a glimpse of something pale and white where she had pointed.

The charred floorboards crunched under my feet as I walked over to it and picked it up. It was just a book- though one that was totally untouched by the fire. It must have been put here after the fire, I thought.

I read the title: “The Book of Living Gates.” The binding felt warm under my touch, as if the book were alive. The leather used to bind it looked suspiciously like human skin, white and soft under my trembling hands. I opened the book to the first page and began reading.

Very quickly, I realized this was some sort of occult book. It called for gathering certain ingredients and calling on ancient, unknown gods to open doorways to the land of the dead. I will not be posting the necessary steps for the ritual here. No one should ever try to replicate anything I did. If I knew then what I know now, I would have immediately buried that book ten feet underground in the middle of the most isolated nature reserve, so that no one would find it.

Instead, I took the book home, went around to try to procure the necessary ingredients, and started the ritual in the back of the cabin I was renting. Some of the ingredients, like a pound of human fat, required me to break into medical dumpsters and biohazard areas. Others, like salt, candles and a dagger, were far easier to procure.

Within 48 hours, I was standing in the middle of the circle of salt and human fat, reading the incantation to the primordial god Vaalhotep. I had soaked the floor of the entire circle in human blood, as requested by the book, afterwards cutting my left hand and pouring some of my blood into the center to mix with the blood of the unknown strangers. As I chanted faster and faster, something began to happen.

The clear night was suddenly filled with lightning clouds. Bolts struck the forest all around me, splintering trees and sending a cacophony of thunder and destruction over the landscape. The perimeter of the circle had begun to glow, at first only a pale light, but then getting so bright that I couldn’t look directly at it. Before I knew what was happening, the circle I was standing on began descending.

It was eerie, the way the circle separated from the surrounding Earth. The walls of dirt were perfectly circular, perfectly straight. I went down faster and faster, seeing earthworms and vole tunnels as I descended. Soon, I was submerged into blackness. Looking up, I saw only the smallest pinprick of light where the night sky and flashing lightning still appeared. After another few seconds, though, even that disappeared.

Finally, the circle came out the bottom of whatever arcane tunnel we were in. It smoothly descended through a layer of blood-red clouds. Looking down, I saw I was in another world entirely.

What looked like lines of long ants trudged forward below me. But as the circle of blood-soaked earth slowly descended through the air, floating down even though nothing was there to support it, I realized I wasn’t looking at ants at all, but people. Millions and millions of people were moving forward slowly, trudging along without interest, their eyes dead and their faces blank.

Looking farther out, I saw huge pyramids being built by the enslaved masses. Some of them looked like they soared thousands of stories into the air.

I saw dark-green and black reptilian gods hundreds of feet tall, tentacles whipping out of their mouths as they surveyed the masses. Their wings moved languidedly behind them, stretched skin pushing out a soft breeze as the gargantuan, bat-like wings moved up and down. Claws bigger than a man appeared on the feet and hands of all these ancient gods, and I saw their likeness carved into many of the pyramids or sculpted into huge works of art.

An odor like ozone, sulfur, copper and iron filled this entire wretched place, blowing on the wind underneath the black and red swirls of the sky.

Flying monstrosities circled the assembled lines, looking like pterodactyls in some ways, but with glowing red eyes and dozens of whipping, razor-sharp tails. If anyone stepped out of line, the flying monstrosities would swoop down and pick them up, biting them in half or taking them away to destinations unknown.

My circle came slowly to the ground, landing softly. In the nearest line of people, I saw my wife, holding my infant son, trembling. Her eyes were wide and unseeing.

“Sharon!” I called. She blinked, looking around. She saw me, standing there only fifty feet away. She was part of a massive procession of women holding infants or young children.

“What are you doing here?” she asked in a slow, dead voice. “You aren’t one of us. Not yet. Go home, Edgar.”

“I… I just needed to see you one last time,” I said, tears forming in my eyes. “I couldn’t live without you and Mikey.” She shook her head slowly.

“It’s almost over,” she said, pointing at the pyramid up ahead of her. “They’re going to kill us, Edgar. Then this will all be over. The ancient gods want…” Emotion broke over her face, and she began weeping, falling to her knees, still clutching Mikey tight to her chest. “They want to cut us open and eat our hearts. Even baby Mikey. They don’t care. I tried pleading to them, offering myself instead…” I tried to run towards her, but the invisible, protective wall of the circle stopped me. I slammed into it hard, then began hitting my fist against it.

“Don’t let them touch you!” I said, but my time had run out. The circle had begun to ascend once more. I looked down at my wife and child one last time as she wept on her knees, lining up with so many others to be sacrifices to the eldritch gods of another dimension.

After another few minutes, the circle had finished ascending, dropping me back into my backyard. The Pale One stood there, her smiling skull of a face looking out at me.

“Are you… OK?” she asked me mockingly, her harsh, grating laughter starting up again. “I just… wanted to help.” I could do nothing else but fall on my knees, weeping.

I knew, in that moment, that we could never be a family again.
