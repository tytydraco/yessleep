So i was three years old  and i used to sleep with my parents, and i remember my parents and my friends telling me about what they have dreamt sometimes and i used to wonder why do i never remember my dreams or do i even have dreams ? , i used to question my mom about why don’t i have dreams, and she used to say “maybe you just don’t remember them” 

Time passed and i developed a fear , i remember watching a horror movie and due to that i had a fear that someone might pull my leg while i was sleeping , so i started folding my legs up to my stomach to avoid that fearful sensation after all i was in 3 years old , then started the loop of my dreams which was somewhat disturbing , i have never forgotten that dream till day , i remember that night i had trouble sleeping i was moving my head left and right , when i finally fell asleep , in my dream i was standing outside of an old shack broken,  rusty , and abandoned it was very small that only one person will be able to fit inside it , it had a door which was kind of hanging like it was about to fall but i was hanging by a thread , i opened the door and went inside, what appeared to be a small shack which could only fit one person, after entering it , it suddenly turned out to be an enormous room where a whole city could be built and it had blue neon lights like i was in a cube which was bright neon colour from inside and i was standing in the center of it and saw a big creature the sight of the creature was very disturbing it was emerging from the very end of the cube before i could fully see it my parents woke me up and i was drenched in sweat, even tho i was sleeping in an A/C.

Next day i was telling everyone what i saw and they thought that i was making up a story so that i could feel included in telling dreams like everyone else no one believed me , that’s when i was told that there are bad dreams (nightmares ) and good dreams , even tho no one believed me i was pretty disturbed that day , after that horrible dreams i feared closing my eyes and seeing that same thing again but i remembered my parents telling me about nightmares so i thought maybe i won’t happen again , as i closed my eyes and fell asleep , i was standing in the same position as if i was continuing my dream from last night but this time i i couldn’t move and for some reason i had a car tier around my body , as i stood their in utter fear i saw the big creature appear from the shadow’s , i don’t remember the exact description  of it but it was pretty fat and it had a smashed face like someone had smashed his face with a hammer and he was bloodied and he didn’t have a left hand except it was a screw driver like someone chopped his left hand and stitched a screw driver , seeing this made me wake  up and i couldn’t sleep that whole night. 

I tried telling my parents but they thought i was making up stories , every night i had the same dream except the person kept slowly coming towards me day by day like it was slowly capturing my body , i remember for straight 30 days i had the same dream , the same creepy figure slowly closing in towards me and the more the days went by the more i couldn’t move my body , i remembered on the 30th day the person was super close to me and i suddenly woke up and started throwing up and i didn’t even eat something weird the day before that , that night was very difficult i had a fever and my throat was sore , it was like someone was trying to take over me.

The next day i went to the doctor’s and they couldn’t tell the reason as of why this was happening all of the sudden they said maybe in school due to dust i have had this allergic reaction , at that point i had forgotten about the dreams that i was having because i was too sick and even standing up gave me a headache , now that i look back at it the allergic reaction explanation the doctors gave me seems quite absurd because if it  was dust why didn’t it happen earlier it wasn’t like i was not going to school  i mean maybe i am overthinking about it but it doesn’t seem to be correct either ways , that whole day i didn’t thing about that dream once but when it was time to sleep i remembered what i was about to see in my dreams and to be very honest i thought maybe i won’t wake up this time so i tried my hardest not to sleep that night i but i had taken to many medications not sleeping was quite difficult , i tried to stay awake , but i feel asleep tho the dream was different this time , i was standing outside the same shack in the middle of nowhere the same shack old, rusty, abandoned but i looked around and saw a pile of tiers right next to the old shack which i had not seen the first time , i don’t know why but my eyes kept looking at the tiers even tho i was not looking at them suddenly it all went black and what i saw next was terrifying. 

I saw myself sleeping and then another rapid blackout and i see my dream , the dream that i had the very first time i saw myself standing outside the old wooden shack and entering it and i kept seeing flashes of myself everyday seeing that figure not being able to move all the 30 days and then finally the last day in which i was standing outside the wooden shack and there are two me , one of me is looking at the pile of tiers and one of me is looking at the wooden door and i am witnessing this in third person , i don’t remember what happened next nor did i ever saw that dream ever again , i just remember seeing the glimpses in third person and the next day i woke up and was almost perfectly well i had a very mild fever , i am 18 years old now and i still remember that disturbing dream , and honestly speaking till this day i only have remembered three of my dreams and one of them is this one, the only time ever remembered this same dream was maybe when i was 11 but it was glimpse like it was that the old shack was telling me that i have not left you and that it was hiding inside my dream world. After that i realised maybe it is good to not remember my dreams.
