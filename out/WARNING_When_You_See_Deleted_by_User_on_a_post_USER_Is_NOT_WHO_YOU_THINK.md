When you click around and see this:

You need to be very careful. 

Most of the time, it’s harmless.

But sometimes *it isn't*.

When a post gets *too close to* *something real* – **USER** deletes it.

Not the mods.

Not the poster.

**USER.**

I work for a mid-tier agency in LA. I'm the assistant they shove weird projects onto – digging through Reddit, forums, Discords, wherever - looking for horror stories to option.

A few months back, I started noticing something strange.

Sure there are thousands of creepy posts. But a handful of them felt different.

Not your typical well crafted horror fan fic. Genuinely messy and scared.

Written like someone trying to get something out fast, before they lost the nerve.

And almost all of them ended the same way: Abrupt. Mid-thought. Like the person was cut off before they could finish. This went hand-in-hand with that post’s eventual deletion. 

There was a post about a girl whose brother had died but kept coming back to her window at night, tapping and whispering.

It had **8,342 upvotes** before it vanished.

Another about a guy who started hearing footsteps pacing around his bed every night at exactly 2:13 AM.

**9,107 upvotes.**

Gone.

One about a locked door in a new apartment — a door that never stayed shut, even after they nailed it closed.

**7,486 upvotes.**

Gone.

At first I thought it was normal.

Maybe they regretted posting. Maybe trolls scared them off.

But it kept gnawing at me.

I tracked down a woman in Ohio - her daughter had posted the story about the brother tapping at the window. 

When I emailed her, she answered almost immediately:

*"No. She loved writing those stories. She was so excited when people liked them. She missed her brother dearly and would never have deleted it."*

Shortly after the deletion, her daughter didn’t show up to work. Left her apartment with everything intact. Just vanished. Her mom hadn’t heard from her since. She filed a missing persons report. No leads. No suspects. 

I tracked down a Reddit mod who handled a dispute on the post about the footsteps around the bed.

He remembered the case:

*"He DM’d us. Said something was wrong: that he didn’t delete anything. He was worried his account was hacked. When I followed up, he stopped responding. That was the last time he logged in.”* 

The third post — the one about the door that wouldn't stay shut — led me to a friend of the poster who said:

*"He mailed me a copy of the story. Printed it out. He said he was scared the internet wasn’t safe. Then – nothing. He never answered my texts again. I followed up three times. Hope he’s okay.”*

Shortly after I did this research, the DMs started. 

No username. No profile.

Just:

**USER.**

First message:

*hello*

I didn’t respond. Sent it to junk mail. But got a new message the next day from the same account:

*why aren’t you responding*

I tried to block the account but my phone froze. When I rebooted:

*see you soon*

The messages themselves were innocuous, but it was the feeling they gave me. Like static crawling under my skin.

I knew I had to take my mind off it and get off my phone and laptop. I turned off notifications, shut down my devices and focused on the real world. Doing laundry. Going to a cafe. Getting back in sync with reality.

The feeling subsided and I started to calm down. Took a hot shower. Changed my sheets. Relaxing into a physical routine. But as I lay in bed, waiting for the hum of my air purifier to lull me to sleep, I heard it – 

Just faint creaking.

My pulse raced and I started to reel, ears straining. But only silence followed. 

Maybe it was nothing. Temperature change. Floodboards settling. I was just freaking myself out.

I nodded off again. 

Around 2:13 AM, I woke to another creak. This one was different. Louder. And right on the other side of my door in the hallway. I could see a shadow under the door crack. Someone was definitely there. 

My heart beat in my ear drums.  

“Hello?” I managed. Then I heard:

*"Sweetie?"*

It was my mom's voice. Unmistakable. 

I couldn't breathe. 

My mother's been dead for fifteen years.

*"Are you alright in there?"* she asked.

I was frozen. Too scared to move. 

*"Why don't you open up. Let me take care of you."*

The voice was hers but not hers. Like it knew the words to say but not the feelings behind them. Then –

The doorknob rattled.

My heart hammered so hard I thought it would crack my ribs.

*"Let me in. Please. I miss you."*

I didn’t respond or move an inch. After about ten seconds, I saw the shadow drift away from the crack under the door and heard its creaking steps receding, until it was gone.

I let out the smallest breath, then immediately heard quick footsteps heading back toward my door and BANG 

Something slammed into it. Heavy. 

BANG

The door started to splinter. 

BANG

I screamed. “Go away go away go away!” 

Then everything went quiet, just like that. The weight on my chest lifted. I could tell whatever it was had finally left.  After that, it was impossible to sleep. I stayed up until morning.

My phone buzzed around 5 a.m. I thought I had turned it off. 

New message.

**USER.**

*why are you making this so hard*

I got up and ran out of my apartment. Only grabbing my phone, keys, and wallet. 

I’m at a hotel now. Hoping I’m far enough away from whatever it is. Glad I have the time and space to tell you all this: 

USER wants the truth hidden. The real stories deleted. And if you tell them. Or read them. Then you need deleting too. 

I had to let you know to warn you. I realize this may also make you a target. But you may have become one anyway, without any warning. And you have to be prepared.

I pray this post isn’t deleted. 

You may be reading it in the only window it stays up. 

So save it, print it, preserve it. Because this next part is *most important.* It’s the only way to *not disappear.* 

If USER reaches out — *don’t respond*. And when you’re alone, especially if you’re on your phone or laptop reading stories like this, you must always make sure to
