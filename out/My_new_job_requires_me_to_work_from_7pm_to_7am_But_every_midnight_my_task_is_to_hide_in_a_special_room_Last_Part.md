[Part 10](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17gnz4c/my_new_job_requires_me_to_work_from_7pm_to_7am/)

My mind was conquered by something when I started writing this post. Something I had not seen them do for a long time. My wife, my kids, all of them had genuine smiles illuminating their faces. The breeze invited itself inside the train as we made our way to another city and a new life. Some days ago, I personally would not believe that things could take such a turn for the better, therefore, for this last part about my story, let me update you on what occurred.

We remained indoors in our house while I waited for Friday, 27th October to arrive. Connor kept in touch with me as we elaborated a plan for 'how' I had to attend the meeting. When the day arrived, Connor drove me to the workplace, while providing me with the items and the tips I needed to put a definitive end to the nightmare.

I arrived at work, finding Dylan in a strange and unusual mood, dressed in black like myself instead of red. He was not antagonistic with me as before, instead, he seemed to be trying hard to be nice while displaying an expression full of worries. My supervisor chose an extremely friendly attitude contrasting with the reasons why he organized the meeting, not even mentioning my absences. What surprised me the most was the venue and the time of the meeting: overlapping board room at midnight.

What did he mean by overlapping? I thought, already knowing that it was the next topic for a chat with Connor, before we reach midnight.

My supervisor then left without providing further details, apparently expecting me to work, however, I had other plans that could get compromised by serious obstacles. One of them was Dylan. For whatever reasons, even after 6:30 pm, he did not leave. When I asked him why he was still there, he said that he could not leave and that the company had trapped him. Nervous, trembling and almost crying, he had difficulties to express himself.

Of course, I asked him to elaborate, and he confessed to be the one who sent the man with the clown mask and the machete days ago. His plan was to organize a scenario that highlights my incompetency in order to get me fired and get him somehow in a spotlight. The company found out but chose to exploit him instead of handing him over to the authorities.

Dylan tried to make his mark in the company, and after achieving just that somehow, he was terrified. He had been asked to wait there without any mentioned reasons and obeyed not having a choice. During the whole evening, he pestered me with questions, and I managed to explain him the situation, making him more aware but also more afraid. I asked him if they made him sign anything new and he replied that it was not yet the case, but the process was already launched.

We neither patrolled nor indulged in any work activity. I was busy discussing the 'plan' with Connor through text messages, while Dylan just stared at the floor, occasionally breaking the silence with his questions. We just remained in the black room and waited as he became more and more nervous. Minutes before midnight, Dylan apologized for antagonizing me, but I brushed it off, demanding him to rather apologize to the family of the man he involved and succeeded in getting killed. Empathizing with me about breaking the rules, he assured me that the company had to know it and also counted on that. According to him, he does not know of one existing rule on earth that has not been broken at least once, for one reason or another, even by those who are supposed to be custodians of said rules. It is just human nature.

Midnight then finally arrived. I gathered the whole courage I could and cut off the lights from the room, thus creating my own loadshedding and plunging the entire building in darkness. I left Dylan alone in the black room and stepped out of there, with a backpack, ready to execute the plan. I made my way towards the board room, my heart beating and filled with fear at the idea of encountering the entity. I thought about something Connor told me earlier, understanding a little bit more what was meant by overlapping, but my train of thoughts came to an abrupt stop when I saw yellow lights approaching.

I quickly pulled out a piece of fabric from my pocket and blindfolded myself before tossing the backpack a few meters away from me. Connor had better be right about that. I heard the entity approach, the noises it made on the floor making it seem like a group of people walking or rolling on the ground. I heard it inspect the bag for a few seconds, move around a little bit more before it startled me with a question.

"Identify your soul." It asked with a child's voice. The moment to practice everything that Connor taught me had arrived, as he explained:

'If you do not have something from them on you, and you don't use your eyes, then that thing won't be able to recognize you.'

"Pilgrim." I responded, according to Connor's instructions, not having a clue about I was saying.

"Function." It said with a woman's voice.

"Unknown." I replied, getting several and long minutes of silence as a response. The entity's silence plunged me in an unbearable discomfort. I thought that it was about to rip my head off my neck.

"House?" It asked with an old man's voice, as I felt its lamps getting closer to my face, also hearing the metallic sounds they made all around me.

"Concealed." I spoke, plunging the entity in confusion, according to Connor.

As a result, the entity remained silent for a few seconds. I then heard it continue its way and I waited several minutes before removing the blindfold. I then picked up the backpack and carried on with the plan, reaching the board room at around 12:27 am. I pulled out a fancy flashlight from the bag, set it to UV mode and shone the light on the white door which immediately turned to black with the shining red patterns slowly appearing on it. I then opened the door and found four seated people, dressed in black robes, waiting for me inside. One of them was the Supervisor.

"Welcome Kol. Please have a seat." My supervisor spoke, coldly, immobile and looking straight in front of him as if he was hypnotized.

"Let's not waste further time." Another spoke.

"I never intended to." I replied, not intending to sit with those people.

"First of all Kol, whatever Connor has to tell, it won't help you. You're already involved so deeply in the project." One of the managers said.

"You mean involved in the ritual?" I retorted.

"Will you please switch off that thing?" My supervisor asked referring to the flashlight.

"Sure, but before, let me do one thing." I spoke, ready to put an end to the pain.

From the bag, I pulled out the T-shirt of my uniform and the contract. At that moment, they realized that I was wearing a similar but fake uniform and that the real one was in the bag. They all stood up. With swift movements, I tore the contract into two pieces, and was surprised by the blood that gushed out of the paper. I did the same with the T-shirt, ignoring the yells of the management board. Soon, we heard a rumbling noise as something was charging towards the board room, attracted by what just occurred. I blindfolded myself again.

"It's coming! We gotta hurry!" The Supervisor shouted.

The entity burst in and started a carnage I could only witness with my ears. Flesh tearing, bones crackling, screams of agony and pain resounding in the room, growing louder by second. Strangely, each of them begged the entity to stop, calling it with different human names. In the meantime, with my hands, I searched and found the door I came in through, ready to leave the management board members to their fate, but before I stepped out...

"Please, don't go just yet!" The entity spoke. I froze, but remained quiet. "Thank you for helping me." It added, but I just nodded in response. "What can I do for you? I'll do anything you want." It asked.

"I want you to return to where you came from." I answered, according to Connor's instructions again. He warned me about the so-called 'nice' side of the entity. This was a being beyond human understanding that had no sympathy, no empathy or love whatsoever for people, even though it could sometimes fake or mirror such qualities. Therefore, it was wise for any human not to have such sentiments towards it.

"I shall do it for you." It replied, maybe unaware that I had turned its trick against itself, to send it far away from this world. I nodded again and stepped out, before closing the door behind me.

Slowly and confidently, and after removing the blindfold, I walked into the darkness of the corridors, going to the black room. I found the door open upon arrival, something I found very strange, and approached for further inspection. I discovered Dylan on the floor, dead in the same manner that his clown masked accomplice died some days ago. He might have missed the part when I told him that the entity could be very subtle and cunning.

Without calling for anyone, I simply waited in the room for 01:00 am, with the door open, then exited the building a free man. Connor, who patiently waited for me outside, sighed in relief upon seeing me and drove me back home. On the way, I asked him how he came to know about all those things, with the entity and the company, but he told me that his full story was for another time. The most important thing as he said is that I am now free and that I should not expose the company. They have to cover the recent disappearances of their staff members anyway. They do not want any scandal.

Among all the questions that flooded my mind, I could not retain the one that struck me the most: why Connor, a complete stranger, went out of his way to help me? Me of all people, the dumb and stupid rule breaker that deserves to die because he brought a terrible fate upon himself anyway, right? In such an unforgiving world devoid of empathy, even towards fellow human beings, Connor was struck by my decision to help the clown masked guy. That fact alone, proved to him that I was a rare heart, by his own words, as he himself recognized that he would not have done the same, hence, people like me help him to still believe in humanity.

Following our conversation in the car, I have decided to follow Connor's steps and start something of my own. Something that I like to do, something that makes me feel happy and that do not require me to report to anyone or hide from something. This is why my family and I are traveling. Even though he had already did too much for my family and I, Connor had proposed to help me yet again with anything he could. I will maybe update you on how we are fairing, but that will be on another platform for sure. Narrators, this is the moment you have waited for, we can now discuss permissions to use my story on your channels.

Everyone, please take care of yourselves and thanks a lot for sharing that terrifying journey with me.
