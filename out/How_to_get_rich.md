Trigger warnings: Torture

Do I regret having a demon sealed inside me ten years ago? The answer is, "No!"

I had hit rock bottom. My financial problems were tearing my life to pieces. My wife and I were arguing all the time, divorce looming large in our minds. Our big, expensive house in our quiet, wealthy suburb was under threat of foreclosure. Our two boys would roll their eyes every night when they saw what we were having for dinner, stuff we never would've touched when the money was flowing. Our youngest, who was twelve, even wrote a poem about canned fish and instant noodles. I wince everytime I remember it. "Canned fish is such a bore. I don't want more. Instant noodles cost only a dime. They're a waste of my time."

No father wants to hear that from their kids. And it wasn't the worst of it. The worst part was when I had to beg my retired parents for a loan to cover some of my debts. They gave me the money and told me I didn't have to pay it back. My folks have always been good to me. They knew of my situation. I'm still ashamed.

So I went to see a witch. As one does when one has exhausted all other options. I had seen her ad many times in the local paper. It was hard to miss. She always took out a whole page. I'd rolled my eyes at what I considered filthy woo in our renowned local paper before, but when you start lacking certain things in life, you start to notice those who have them. The full page ad in the local paper, my company couldn't afford it back then, and that got me thinking she must have money. Money from return customers. Satisfied customers. That maybe there was something more to her, maybe she was legit, not some charlatan shuffling tarot cards or peddling potions that, "Return lost lover!" or "Curse your enemies!"

She had to be the real deal. Her store was in the middle of downtown. The rent there was spectacular, I knew. I had been forced to downsize and move a little further out. The optics were encouraging.

I was a little disappointed when I walked into the store and saw a teenage girl at the cash register. She looked too young to be a witch with a reputation for getting results. The store itself looked like a curio shop. They had what looked like mass-produced books on spells, yoga, and meditation; ugly dolls that looked more benign than sinister, some do it yourself guides to divination, beaded necklaces that looked more fashionable than occult, and t-shirts with astrological symbols. The store's mascot was the obligatory black cat. I almost walked straight out when I saw it. This looked like a b-movie idea of a magic shop. I'd expected shrunken heads, jars filled with exotic animal parts, foul smelling incense, and an old woman dressed in exquisite robes like Gandalf The White.

The girl smiled when she saw the look on my face. She said, "If you're looking for something more potent, Miss Smith is in the back."

"Miss Smith?" I asked. "Shouldn't it be Madame Cauldron or something?"

Her smile vanished. She snarled at me and turned back to her phone,  ignoring me. I would've fired her immediately if she worked for me. Customers are allowed to make bad jokes, that's how it works at my company. Not that it was doing us much good. How could this store be so successful with such bad customer service?

I wanted to be out of her presence asap. Mostly because I was embarrassed by her reaction to my lame joke. I darted to the back of the store. This was my last hope, I had to see it through.

I was even more disappointed when I saw the backroom. Miss Smith was a petite woman, middle-aged, wearing tight black jeans, white sneakers, and a long sleeved white dress shirt. Her office looked more like the office of a CEO of a medium-sized company. Sort of like mine.

She smiled when she saw me and said, "You didn't knock. Close the door, sit down, and tell me all about it."

She said this with no surprise or fear at the random stranger who'd just barged into her office. Like she'd been expecting me.

I closed my eyes, took a long breath, closed the door, then went to tell the witch dressed in business casual all about my problems.

She listened patiently, nodding and shaking her head at all the appropriate times. When I was finished, she gave me one of the brightest smiles I had ever seen and said, "I have just the thing for you. A demon!"

That was ten years ago. If you're down and out and thinking about letting a witch put a little something inside you, I can't recommend it enough. My marriage is now stronger than ever. I bought my parents their dream home in Florida. My boys have both left the house and gone to college. Neither of them makes any snarky remarks about the food our private chef makes whenever they visit. I've paid all my debts and my investments have soared. I know what you're thinking, money solved all my problems. It did. Money can't buy happiness, but it can make all of life's problems easier to navigate.

It didn't even cost me that much. The witch only asked for ten percent of the money I was going to make. A great deal for both of us. I got all of the demon's powers: enhanced luck, limited but still useful precognition, and the ability to tell when people are lying. All very useful in the business world. I can also absorb souls.... but I'm not into that sort of thing. It's demonic. Pun intended.

There's only one downside. The demon has access to me in my dreams. And, as you can imagine, he's not happy about our arrangement. He comes after me every night and is particularly vicious on the nights he catches me. Which is often.

The constant nightmares gave me terrible insomnia in the first two years, but I got used to it and it's been a minor irritation ever since.

Tonight is the tenth anniversary of our union. I'm looking forward to seeing Drexhas, the demon. Not something I would've said anytime before but ten years is a long time. We have to bury the hatchet. Become friends, or, if that's asking for too much, coexist peacefully. He's not going anywhere. And he knows it. If he did he'd take my soul with him and I'd be a dead man. So we're stuck together. Literally.

I want to make his stay inside me as comfortable as possible. I'm willing to watch 'The Real Housewives of Potomac.' He sees all that I see. Three thousand year old sentient beings love reality tv. There's something about the constant drama that appeals to them. At least that's what the witch told me. I have no reason to doubt her. I don't really know Drexhas all that well. He and I only exchange insults (both ways), and beatings (him beating me).

"We need to talk," I said, looking at the bathroom mirror.

My wife was sleeping in our bedroom. The words were meant for Drexhas. He couldn't communicate with me while I was awake, but he could hear and see everything I did. I kept my voice low as I continued.

"I don't want to fight anymore. I'm tired. I'm not the one who trapped you. It was Miss Smith, the witch. All I did was agree to have a demon sealed inside me. I wasn't specific. I didn't name names. I didn't pick you out. She did. You should focus your anger at her, not me. And you'll win in the end. You're immortal, I'm not.  I'll die one day and you'll have my soul. It could be tomorrow, five years from now, or forty. Point is, I'm going to die eventually and you'll be the last man standing. You'll win, and you'll be free to get your vengeance on the witch however you like. You just have to be patient. In the meantime, I'd like to make your stay inside me more pleasant. It's been ten years and our little cat and mouse game in my dreams is getting old. I'm willing to devote four hours each day to doing things you enjoy. I'll watch Survivor, Love Island, hell, if it'll make you happy I'll go as far back as Jersey Shore. I'll watch any sport you like; soccer, baseball, boxing, you name it, I'll watch it. I'll visit anyone you want to see; The Dalai Lama, Miss Smith, Paris Hilton, anyone. Four hours everyday. You're the boss."

My reflection stared back at me. I wouldn't get a response until I was dreaming. I prayed it wasn't a nightmare.

"Who were you talking to?" My wife asked groggily as I exited the bathroom.

"I'm practicing for a meeting tomorrow," I lied.

She gave a non-committal response. She didn't care for me to elaborate.

I hadn't told her or anyone else about my extra passenger. She's a very religious woman and she'd leave me on the spot if she knew that everytime she looked in my eyes a demon looked back at her.

Drexhas, being a demon, might ask me to strangle then revive her repeatedly until her heart gave out or something equally evil. I was hoping he'd be reasonable and not ask me to kill or hurt anyone. I wouldn't break the law to appease him.

I got under the sheets and looked at the ceiling. If Drexhas refused my offer tonight then our situation would likely never change, I'd have to live with terrifying nightmares for the rest of my life.

I closed my eyes.

My dreams have been lucid ever since I became entwined with the demon. It sucks, but it comes with the territory. Whatever he did to me would last only as long as the dream. No permanent damage. But I still miss the days when sleep meant eight hours of rest for my brain.

The dream started with me walking in the middle of a street downtown. The sun was shining and there were no cars or other people. I was hoping it would start with me in my house. The house was a place of strength for me, most of my successes against Drexhas happened there. It was easier to delay and defend against him in the house. When I avoided him long enough for my brain to move out of REM sleep, dream sleep, to normal sleep, that was a success.

The odds were heavily stacked in his favor out here in the open, like a house cat fighting a lion, not a fair fight. He appeared one hundred yards ahead of me, intentionally in the direction I would've wanted to flee to get to my house. He looked like one of the extras from 300.  Miss Smith had told me he'd lived somewhere in Anatolia three thousand years ago. His hair was long and dark and he had a short beard. He was tall and muscular and always shirtless, showing off his imposing physique. This was my dream but he was stronger than me here, he had greater control of the dreamscape. I had no doubt he could kick my butt in the real world as well.

"What did you think of my offer?" I shouted at him.

He didn't reply. His eyes were like daggers, making his hatred of me obvious.

"We could plot her demise together, you and I," I offered.

His eyes widened. He shook his head slowly. He was afraid of her. Not an unwarranted fear given she had a number of trapped demons in her office, demons she was sealing in her clients for profit.

I added, "I meant every word I said. We've done this too long. Even you must be tired of it. Let's try something different. You could write me instructions on what you want me to do for four hours everyday. It would be like playing a video game."

He replied by charging me. My shoulders slumped. So I hadn't gotten through to him. The only thing left to do now was flee. I made a red Lamborghini materialize in front of me. This was my dream after all. In here, I was like Neo in The Matrix. Or, more accurately, Morpheus, with Drexhas being similar to an agent. I knew he wouldn't take the bait and form his own car to chase me around these empty streets. He's such a bore. More likely he'd create a bazooka and shoot at the car. I was okay with that kind of demise. Quick and painless. My death in any dream always moved me out of dream sleep.

I opened the driver side door and jumped inside. Before I could start the car I noticed Drexhas wasn't behind the car on the rearview mirror. He wasn't on either side or in front either. Where'd he go?

He answered that question a second later when he smashed into the back half of the car from above. The impact flattened everything behind the driver's seat, but it did surprisingly little damage to me. Two feet further forward and this dream would've been over. Had he missed me on purpose? The car had been stationary.

He rolled off the wreckage he'd created and fell on the left side of the car. He wasn't invulnerable in these dreams but it took a lot worse than what he'd just done to take him out. This was my chance to get away, he was incapacitated.

I really needed to move but my hands were frozen on the wheel. I know I said his torment was a minor irritation earlier, but I was afraid of him. I watched his prone form slumped on the street.

He was breathing. He'd intentionally rolled off the car so he wasn't unconscious. I could go out there and bludgeon him with a hammer, or stab him repeatedly with a sword. These were the sort of things I was forced to think about in my dreams, things I would never want to consider in the real world.

I didn't try either. I wasn't sure how out of it he was. And I had a suspicion he was faking. I'd seen him rise quicker from worse in the past.

I tried to quietly move my right leg over to the passenger side. His head rose and we made eye contact on the side view mirror.

Bastard.

I bolted out the passenger side and ran in the direction of home. He was on his feet, I could hear him coming after me.

I jumped to the top of a skyscraper. He followed. It turned into a chase across the rooftops. These dreams would be fun if I didn't have a demon hunting me down.

I made a grenade appear in my right hand, pulled the pin, dropped it on the roof of one building before jumping to another. I didn't check to see if the explosion delayed Drexhas, a wall appeared ahead of me. I jumped over it. Drexhas was with me on the other side of the roof when I landed. I tried to turn back but the wall was still rising, blocking my escape. Chains appeared all around me and bound my hands and feet. He had me.

His smug smile made me regret pleading with him in the mirror.

"I didn't want to say this," I said, "but you leave me no choice. If you don't accept my truce, I'll start using your power to absorb souls. It's an evil power that I don't even want to think about, but I'll use it, and it'll prolong my life. You'll be stuck inside me forever."

"You don't get it do you?" he replied contemptuously. "They always do. I did. You'll get older and more frail and you won't be able to stop yourself. You'll become a demon just like me."

"I won't. Not if it means killing people.”

"You will!"

"I won't!"

"ENOUGH!"

He approached me, glaring again.

"What will it be tonight?"; I asked him. "Will you behead me? Throw me off this building while I'm bound? Run me over with a truck?"

His smile returned. "No. I let my rage decide how I treated you in the past. I made your demise too quick. That only moved you to a deeper sleep until you were dreaming again. I'm going to take my time from now on. Make you suffer. Make sure you think of me when you're awake. Make you dread going to sleep."

I looked back at the wall that had stopped rising behind me. And my bound hands and feet. My lucid dreams were so strong that even extreme pain wouldn't end the dream or wake me up, only death. I hadn't expected things to be getting worse tonight but clearly they had.

"You're going to crucify me?" I asked. I knew it could take hours, if not days for people to die from that.

"Not tonight. I have something else in mind."

"What?"

A small, sharp dagger appeared in his left hand. "Ever heard of the ancient Chinese art of 'Death by a thousand cuts.'”
