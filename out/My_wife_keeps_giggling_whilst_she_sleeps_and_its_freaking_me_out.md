This all started on one night where there was nothing out of the ordinary. 

Me and my wife of 8 years Jill had just finished watching Stranger Things for the night. 

As I shut it off we kissed each other and said goodnight before burying our heads in the pillows.  

I wasn’t the best sleeper.

It often took me a while to doze off so I would just lay there with my eyes shut for a considerable amount of time. 

“Hehehehehe” I heard whilst desperately trying to force myself to sleep. 

“What is it Jill?” I queried

No response. 

I thought I must’ve imagined her cackle. She was always asleep before me after all. 

Also the giggle certainly didn’t sound like one of my wife’s ordinary chuckles. 

I made nothing of it and tried to sleep again. 

The next day I asked Jill about it. 

“Did you see something funny on your phone last night before we slept?” 

“No? I just dozed off after we watched that episode” she replied with a hint of confusion. 

I was certain I heard her laugh but it was a quiet noise. Perhaps it was something outside that loosely resembled the sound of a person laughing quietly.

I made nothing of it and carried about my day. 

I came home from work that day to find that there was an absurd amount of food delivered to the door of our house.

My brother Gavin would often deliver us food before showing up unannounced. 

It was annoying cause he’d stay for hours but at least we got a bunch of free food out of it.

Bizarrely though Gavin didn’t turn up on this day. Maybe he’d ordered the food with the intention of coming to ours then something else popped up for him. 

Didn’t bother Jill and I much though. We gobbled most of the food for dinner without any regrets. 

We even took the large amount of leftovers into our room to eat while we continued watching Stranger Things. 

As we finished our episode I kissed her and said goodnight again. 

I shut my eyes and hoped that I’d fall asleep quickly but again I lay there for what felt like an hour. 

“Hehehehehe”

My eyes promptly widened as I heard the exact same noise again. 

I was now convinced that it was my wife laughing. I sat up out of bed and looked over to her as she was facing the other way. 

Jill looked totally out of it so she must’ve been laughing at something in her sleep. 

I remember thinking about how odd it was. I’d never heard her talk in her sleep before never mind laugh in it. 

I smirked at the weirdness of it before laying back down and shutting my eyes again. 

The next morning I attempted to make fun of my wife for it.

“You know you’ve been giggling to yourself in your sleep like a weirdo.” 

“What?” Jill asked bewildered.

“You’ve been chuckling faintly in your sleep. Why is that?”.

“I don’t know? Must’ve been dreaming about something funny.” 

We both set off for work shortly after. 

Later that day I came home absolutely exhausted. They had me working for 90 minutes longer than I should’ve been but I was willing to help out. 

I came home and Jill asked me about it straight away. 

“Jeez what took you so long?” 

“They wanted me to finish the Wednesday papers. Was a pain in the ass.”

“Well you’re home now. Safe and sound”.  She said in a strangely stern tone. 

I went to sit on the couch and as I flopped onto it I noticed the pillow in the middle was gone. 

Jill must’ve moved it which made me irrationally irritable. 

I let out a big sigh before shuffling my sluggish body over to the side of the couch. 

Afterwards we got into bed for the night and I was convinced my tiredness would let me fall asleep early. 
 
“Hehehehehe…hehehehehe” 

My wife yet again was giggling and now it was slightly louder than the previous night.  

Now I know you’ll call me out for it but I was irascible following a long tedious day of work. 

I decided to wake my wife up as the giggling was now slightly maddening me. 

“Jill, I’m glad you’re enjoying your comedy show in your dreams but I really need to sleep.”

“Huh?” She confusingly asked as she rubbed her sleepy eyes. 

I rolled my eyes and flung my head onto the pillow in an exaggerated tone like a child would before getting up for school.

The following day I was yet again working overtime when I really didn’t want to. 

I just felt so tired. It was as if every day was draining the life energy out of me. 

I got home in a state of utter fatigue. 

I opened the door to see a huge stack of unopened food yet again. 

Jill was sat on the couch watching some game show she used to like after work. 

I wearily wandered into the kitchen to get some cutlery for our food before even saying hi to my wife. 

Most of the drawers for some reason had been left open by Jill. 

For something so little I wanted to put my fist through the wall. How hard can it be to shut the drawers after you use them? 

My unfair and dreary mood couldn’t fathom it as I grabbed a set of knives and forks from the cutlery. 

I went back into the living room and sat next to Jill not even bothering to say a word.

We took some of the leftovers in the room with us again in the night. 

We made quick work of them before turning off the lights to go to bed. 

Not long after it happened again. 

“Hehehehehe…hehehehehe”

I yet again heard her sadistic giggling. 

It was so creepy to just hear her laughing to herself like a maniac every single night in total darkness. 

I rolled her over and used my phone as a faint source of light because I wanted to see what she looked like as she laughed. 

Surprisingly she didn’t awake when I manoeuvred her onto her other side to face me. 

I sat there for a few minutes but she didn’t laugh. 

My eyes began to close as I was almost overcome with tiredness. 

Suddenly however..

“Hehehehehe…hehehehehe.”

My heart froze. 

I was looking my wife right in the face when the noise was made. 

My wife was not giggling. 

“HEHEHEHEHE…HEHEHEHEHE” 

I began to hyper-ventilate as the giggles became frighteningly loud.

I could now make out the source of the sound. 

I turned on the flashlight on my phone. 

I leaned over the side of my bed. 

I lifted the covers as I peered my head upside down underneath our bed. 

What greeted me was fierce hazel eyes that looked directly into mine. 

A red haired woman with some of the food we’d been taking into our room was hiding under our bed. 

I could see that the cushion that was missing from our couch had been carefully hidden under the bed. 

Most frighteningly, I saw pieces of our cutlery that had been taken from our drawers.

The red-haired woman was grinning at me but during this few-second long stand-off her mouth opened more and more. 

She was smiling with so much joy like I was a friend of hers that she hadn’t seen in years. 

I then heard the sound that had been creeping me out for the last 4 nights. 

“HEHEHEHEHE” she pervertedly giggled as her frozen open mouthed expression caused her to drool onto the floor. 

I shouted so loud my wife awoke.

The still-grinning woman under the bed then grabbed a knife before swinging it at my dangling head.

Fortunately I lifted myself just in time before the blade could connect with my face. 

“JILL! RUN! GET OUT!”

We both jolted out the room as the red-haired woman began to climb out from under where we slept.

We locked ourselves in the toilet. 

Jill and I hugged each other as we both cried. We were both in a state of total fear and panic. 

All we could hear were thuds of this deranged woman trying to break down the door as she constantly giggled.

“HEHEHEHHEHE…HEHEHEHEHEHE…HEHEHEHEHE”.

I called the police as we prayed to god that the toilet door would hold. 

After what felt like hours they arrived and caught the giggling maniac banging on our toilet door. 

Fortunately Jill and I were both okay. 

A few weeks on from this and Jill and I are doing alright so you needn’t panic! 

It turns out this crazy woman had been living in our home for at least 4 days. 

She’d stolen our cutlery whilst we were out and also had taken a pillow from our couch to use under our bed. 

Now here’s the freaky part. Know how I mentioned that we kept getting lots of food delivered to our house. 

Initially we thought it was my brother Gavin however my wife noticed some really bizarre activity on her Just Eat account. 

It turns out this psychopath had been pre-ordering food for the following day using her phone. 

She must’ve grabbed my wife’s finger while she was asleep and used it to unlock the device. 

Jill and I are still pretty shaken about it but we are moving on from it just fine. 

I didn’t sleep very well before and as you can imagine that hasn’t exactly gotten better.

I’m just so paranoid that at any moment during these gloomy nights I’m going to hear those giggles again..
