I am going to complete my uploads today. Based on the last 24 hours, I am not sure I will have another chance. 

As the door to the storage unit swung open, I found myself inundated with the scent of mold and inorganic decay. Heavy and damp, the odor clung tightly to the inside of my nostrils as I fumbled blindly around the room, my hands searching for the pull string lighting fixture. After nearly tripping a half-dozen times, I felt cold metal against the inside of my palm and pulled downwards. With a faint click, the entire burial chamber was illuminated in an instant.

Innumerable marble notebooks were stacked in asymmetric, haphazard piles, nearly filling the entire volume of the room. From a distance it almost looked like an overcrowded cityscape, and the urban sprawl was now engorged with the light of an unforeseen rapture. At this point, all caution and hesitancy had melted away from me. I threw open the nearest marble notebook I could grasp, wildly flipping through until I found a page inscribed with blue ink. I read the first line, its words forcing me to catch my breath. I don’t know how long I stood there, simply rereading that first line over and over. Waiting, praying that somehow it would be different if I read it again. At a certain point, my mind began to overheat and short circuit. I tossed the notebook with such force that I could hear its spine snap when it collided with the rusty walls of the storage container. I opened a second notebook, and threw it with an even greater force than I had thrown the first after I read its first line. Then a third, and a fourth, and a fifth, an eighth, eleventh, fourteenth - frenzy completely enveloping me. And when my legs finally gave out, I slid to the floor and sobbed for the first time in weeks. 

The first line read: 

*The morning of the first translocation was like any other. I awoke around 9AM, Lucy was already out of bed and probably had been for some time. Peter and Lily had really become a handful over the last few years, and Lucy would need help giving Lily her medications…*

I didn’t check the contents of all of the notebooks, it didn't seem necessary after the thirtieth or so. The writings of every single journal were identical to each other, and subsequently the copy I had found at John’s hospice - one sibling reunited with thousands of identical twins tucked away for years in this warehouse. In the remaining space between the stacks of abandoned notebooks were thousands more crude sketches of [the sigil](https://imgur.com/a/symbol-above-every-entry-Rb2VbHP). The drawings were rushed but meticulous in form, they were all very identifiable as relative copies of one and other. 

There was one additional discovery, however. In the very back of the room, in the oldest, most eldritch portion of this catacomb, there was a small brown box. The words and insignias on the cardboard were weathered but interpretable:

*“CellCept Records, Biomodeling Department: DO NOT REMOVE”*

In my idling car outside the dilapidated storage warehouse, I finished reading the last of John’s deathbed logbook, as well as the contents of CellCept’s stolen records. Bewitched, I sat motionless for hours in the driver’s seat. I contemplated the meaning of it all, as I knew that would guide my next few actions. When my trance finally started to lift, I found myself looking up towards the night sky, though it had been mid-morning when I arrived at the warehouse. I then gently put my forehead against the steering wheel, in a silent reverie of the night’s firmament and the symbolism that spilled from it. I then thought of John - a guiding constellation, a series of dim lights an impossible distance away that somehow still found purchase in me, pulling me forward. 

Instead of driving home, I called an uber. An unnecessary precaution, maybe, but I probably didn’t need my car now any more anyway. As far as I know, it’s still there. When I got home to my empty apartment, I began typing post 1. 

These final few passages strike me as the most daunting to write. There is a lot to unpack in John’s translocation postulates. I’m going to attempt to boil it all down in a way that might make at least some sense. In truth, however, I don’t really need to - I think I already succeeded in what I set out to do. But, in honor of him, I will try. 

Unlabeled Entry

Dated as March 2009

*“I don’t want to disappoint you, but I still think Songs for the Deaf is better” I said, knowing exactly how to elicit a response from Pete.*

*Like a lit match to gas-soaked kindling, my son erupted into all manner of counter argument in defense of Era Vulgaris as Queens of the Stone Age’s best record. If I’m being honest, I don’t know which one I prefer. But I knew I had bought myself time to attend to a few things while Pete was occupied proving mathematically and without a shadow of a doubt that I was “too old” to appreciate the new record. I massaged the part of my thigh that was reachable just inside the rim of my cast. Took a few Advil, answered work emails on our family’s desktop computer. All the while, I got to be an audience to my son’s passion for something that clearly meant a lot to him. Which, truthfully, is probably better listening from my perspective than either of those albums.* 

*This had become our nightly ritual since my crash. He would play a song I had never heard, then I’d give him my impression. Then, I would play a song he never heard and he’d give me his impression. So on, ad infinitum. I’ve come around to Billy Talent’s manic guitar work, he’s come around to some older bands like Television and T. Rex. And turns out, no matter how hard we both try, we just don’t like Tool. In the past, I never came home with energy for much of anything after spending ten or so hours doing bench research.*

*All this was going to have to be put on hold for a while, however. I will be returning to work in three short weeks. The emails that CellCept were forwarding to me included some of Marjorie’s preliminary research on NLRP77, God rest her soul. I found myself staring blankly at the screen, dreading the thought of returning to work. In the end, it turned out I just wanted more of this. More time with Lucy. More time with my kids. The crash had put everything into perspective.* 

*“Oye, Major Tom to Ground Control, are you gonna play your next one or what?” Pete’s terrible, and potentially offensive, cockney British accent had brought me back to earth. His master’s thesis presentation on Era Vulgaris' artistic dominance had apparently come to a close, I had just been too distracted to notice.* 

*“Yeah Ziggy, hold your horses” I slid my rolling chair over to our CD soundsystem and leafed through my collection.* 

*“Ah - now we’re cooking. Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, track two of disc two, ‘Bodies’. It may be the second track on the second disc, but it’s number one with a bullet. A bullet with butterfly wings” I waited in anticipation for my son’s inevitable groan at what was arguably a passable Smashing Pumpkins joke, but I heard nothing. Also despite inserting the disc and finding the track, the music wasn’t playing, either. I pushed the play button a few times with my right index finger, when I found the urge to pause briefly and follow my finger back up my body, stopping where my forearm met my elbow. Blank, unadorned skin, save for hair and a few small freckles - no tattoo”*

*“...Huh”. Then, it hit me. I knew I didn’t have much time.* 

*Turning around to face my son, I found him standing a few feet from me, eyes fixed and glazed over but following my movements. I quickly began scanning my entire body for the tether. Both feet, both ankles, both legs. So far nothing. Before I could continue, the sight of my son’s blood stopped me.* 

*As if an invisible scalpel was being drawn over the white of his left eye, a semilunar laceration began to form over the top of his iris, stopping at about the three o’clock position. Crimson dew began to silently trickle steadily out from the wound, but in utter defiance of the natural order, it trickled upwards to his forehead, rather than towards the ground. When it reached his hairline, the blood continued its defiant pilgrimage by elevating in swift motion to the ceiling above my son’s head. It pooled and spread circumferentially on the wood paneling.* 

*Greedy paralysis overtook me.*

*What was first a trickle then became a stream, then a biblical flood. An impossible amount of blood spilling upwards onto my ceiling. By the looks of it, my son should have been completely exsanguinated three times over, but still had more to give.* 

*Suddenly, I broke free of my catatonia. The bleeding slowed, and the blood that had congealed on the ceiling began to darken. The silence, uncanny and grim, would not last. I knew what was next.* 

*I examined my wrists, my chest, felt my shoulder blades with both hands. Nothing. Right on cue, the room exploded with that familiar cacophony. Car alarms and jackhammers and torrential rain. Laughing, screaming, singing, people weeping for both births and deaths. A lifetime of noise condensed, packaged and then released into a space without the design to house even an atom-sized fragment of it.*

*Then, a figure, Atlas, began to sink from the blackness towards my son, almost angelic in its descent. As wrists appeared from the inky gateway, so did innumerable silver threads. The break in the skin that these threads escaped from, which could not have been larger than an inch, was dusky purple and black from the unwilling rupture of nearby capillaries. All of the silver fibers were pulled impossibly tight, no doubt owing to a connection to something equally impossibly far away. All those fibers, save one. One singular tether lay limp out of the metallic bouquet that came from the figure’s left wrist. As more of it appeared, I watched it arc upwards until it formed a curled plateau, which eventually began to turn downwards. I was able to trace it to where it ultimately lay on my living room floor, next to my foot, and up the small of my back. I pinched it between my thumb and index finger, almost too thin to appreciate, and let it guide me to its inevitable zenith at the point where my spine met the base of my skull. I could not trace it any further, as it appeared to plunge into my skin. My broken tether.* 

*When my consciousness returned, I saw Lucy standing above me. She was impatiently detailing my seizure disorder, along with my current spasms, to the 9-1-1 dispatcher over her phone. When she saw me looking at her, she dropped her phone and knelt to my side.* 

*I was right.*

Entry Titled: *An attempt to describe the biophysics surrounding the translocation of human consciousness* 

Dated as April 2009.

*Bear with me. This is not easy, but it is vital to everything.* 

*Let’s start the discussion with a question: How do we manage to all stay in the same “time”? How are you in 4:36 PM on April 15th, 2009 the same time I am, the same time your friend is, the same time the whole world is? Then, perhaps more importantly, how do we all move together, the entire world in lockstep, to 4:37 PM? How do we somehow, with no will or forethought, keep the entire world’s cosmic watch in synchrony? Do we make the conscious decision to do so? No, of course we don’t. But what are the implications of that?* 

*As a way of understanding this, imagine your consciousness as a dog and time as a leash. When we’re all in 4:36 PM on April 15th, 2009, we are leashed there and are unable to move from that time. You cannot will yourself into inhabiting the day before. Nor can you will yourself to inhabiting a week from now. You are stuck where you are, a dog on a leash. That is, until the thing holding the leash moves you forward. Essentially, the point is for this all to work as we know it does, not only do we all have to be anchored together at one singular time: To remain in synchrony we also all have to be moved together, as a unit, to the following point in time as well.* 

*Next, consider your position in physical space, where you are in the world at any one moment. That is something we do have control and agency over. If we want to go to the grocery store, we make the effort to find our way there. But we do have to put in the effort, the energy, to move there, don’t we? Why is time, another coordinate that describes our placement in the universe, just like our physical location, any different? If movement takes energy, whether that be in a time or in space, something has to exert that energy to make it happen. But if not us, then who?*

*Ultimately, humanity has not really needed to confront this mystery. It has always been a given, a natural law. We all occupy the same point in time, whether we like it or not. And if we are not in control of it, and it keeps moving without our input, why bother questioning it? But what if that system began to break, somehow? What if somehow, one’s consciousness fell out of line? Became desynchronized from the rest of us? Became, very specifically, untethered?* 

*I believe my translocations are what happens when that leash becomes damaged.* 

*Let’s continue with this line of thought: As much as I despise mixing metaphors, I want to instead imagine our consciousness as someone tubing through river rapids against a strong current. In this example, the body of water is time, which you are moved through by being tethered via a rope to a boat with an engine in front of you. If that tether were to be damaged, or even break, you’re not going to just stop in place. You are going to find yourself moving backwards down the river. The boat isn’t necessarily going to stop moving forward either. That is, until the person driving the boat notices you’re gone. That person driving the boat, moving us all through time, is Atlas.* 

*There is one final hurdle to cross before I can start to put this all together, and it's the one that I have struggled with the most. I wrote before about our bodies and how they occupy a physical space in the world. But time, as it would seem, is another plane of reality entirely. I think our consciousnesses, or souls if you’re more religiously inclined, occupy that plane of reality, not our bodies. As it stands to reason that we need some part of ourselves in that dimension, otherwise how could we be pulled through it?* 

*Now with all the pieces in place, let’s run a thought experiment. Let’s theorize, somehow, that I become untethered from Atlas. With nothing pulling me forward and the river's current inherently being in the opposite direction, my consciousness begins to move backward down that river, and I find myself experiencing my own memories as if it were the first time. In my translocations, I have always found myself in a past memory, only to be dragged forward to what appears to be the present. This would explain why I have the impression that there are some memories that I can recount, but do not feel like I personally experienced. If I become untethered, I theorize my body may keep moving forward, like it is on autopilot, despite my consciousness moving in the opposite direction. To the people around me, it would probably appear like I was not feeling myself or depressed, almost like the expression “the lights are on, but no one is home”. My consciousness is somewhere else, my flesh keeps moving. Then, when Atlas brings me back and I am reconnected with my body, my neurons still have stored memories of the events my consciousness missed.* 

*Continuing on, this could also explain a lot of the characteristics of my encounters with Atlas. It is tethered to every living person in existence, bearing witness to the entirety of humanity’s consciousness in unison. If Atlas realized I was missing and went down river to find and “retether” me, when I started to perceive Atlas, I theorize I might start to become attuned to what it experiences, moment to moment. Maybe that is why the sound in my memories goes silent as a harbinger of its approach, the so-called “inverse of a memory” I previously described. In a sense, Atlas experiences everything, but never directly. Omnipresent but imperceptible. Within but without. So it has lived those same memories before as well, just from another side of it.* 

*But if Atlas goes down river to find me, what happens to everyone else? Somehow, I think they just remain where they are. In my translocations, Atlas always has thousands of metallic threads erupting from his wrists into darkness. I believe these are all of humanity’s tethers. It would stand to reason that if everyone else remains up-river where they are, but are still connected to Atlas as it proceeds down river to find me, that those connections would become tighter, more strained - pulling and damaging him in the process. As described in some of my translocations, its face always appears red and strained, as if it is greatly exerting itself in the process of finding and returning my consciousness to the present while holding everyone else’s consciousness in stasis. As for what everyone else experiences when Atlas goes looking for me, I suspect nothing. If it is the one that moves time forward, and has the ability to lock everyone else in a single moment, it would essentially be like “time stopped” for those remaining in the present, only to resume when Atlas returned with my consciousness (*[see figure 29](https://imgur.com/a/e4J2LNf)*).* 

*I feel fairly confident in all this, not only because of the calculations I have previously noted, but also because I was able to find my loose tether before I was returned to the present in my most recent translocation. I had deduced that I wasn’t completely disconnected from Atlas, because it has been able to find me. Rather, my tether is damaged but still somewhat attached. Maybe loose is a better word.* 

*And what of the seizures? Well, in describing Atlas and its function, I don’t think it should be surprising that I would describe it as a God, or the closest thing humanity has to one. Atlas pulling my consciousness through decades of time to the present is likely beyond what our consciousness was built to endure. When Atlas brings my consciousness back, and it reconnects with my body, I imagine it has built up some kind of velocity in its trip up-river, only to stop abruptly when the present is reached, causing neuronal damage - like a whiplash injury for the cells in your brain. Think about the potential damage wrought by going one hundred miles an hour in a racecar and then slamming on the breaks. That excess kinetic force, somehow, overloads the brain’s wiring, resulting in a seizure.* 

*To me, that leaves one final question: what severed my connection in the first place?*

*In cellular topography, and science in general, you are taught to try to examine things from every angle. Ever since I saw Atlas and his scarred left eye, I have felt a compulsion to draw it over, and over, and over again. I felt the need to reproduce it.  At some point, it dawned on me. What if I took that sketch, the one that had so consumed me, and imagined looking at it from another angle? If I turned it, rotated it in three dimensional space - Would it not look like Atlas, its tethers, and me, falling behind? (see* [figure 30](https://imgur.com/a/uIzRDwl)*)* 

*The results of this epiphany were twofold. One, it was the first domino that helped me develop my theory about Atlas, and the tethers. More importantly, however, it broke some hold over me, some obscuring veil. I knew I had seen this shape, this sigil before. I had seen it more than any other person currently living, I think. But it benefited from me not knowing that. Once I made the connection, I realized I must quarantine this sigil, and these notes, at the cost of everything.\[...\]”*

I can take the rest from here. 

I want to use this moment to apologize for the deception in my intent, the sleight of hand. I know I have committed a cardinal sin. At this point, I don’t expect forgiveness. 

In that box that John stole from CellCept, I found NLRP77. It was a protein unique to that immortal stem cell line that John and Marjorie had been tasked with deconstructing. As far as I can tell, NLRP77 had never been viewed by human eyes before they were asked to research it. Discarding the more cryptic and unintelligible data logs, I found and uploaded this [summary sheet](https://imgur.com/a/nlrp77-3iG0Vhh), which I think provides an adequate explanation.

As a start, John and Marjorie never used NLRP77 to develop any sort of pharmaceutical. They had barely finished cataloging the protein’s structure when their symptoms began to take root. Evidently, they also presented their preliminary findings at a board of trustees meeting. Three out of eight of those board members in attendance would end up developing dementia-like symptoms, just from brief encounters with the visage of NLRP77. 

To finally come out and say it, it seems that simply viewing NLRP77’s biochemical structure, i.e. the sigil, is likely to blame for John and Marjorie’s deaths. Let me follow in John’s footsteps with a few of my own theories. 

I don’t think the translocations, the movement of John’s consciousness, did any real damage to his physical body. I mean he lost nearly everything that made him himself in the present, but his residual faculties allowed him to keep trudging through life. To me, he felt soulless, a notion John entertains during his theories as well. But Atlas transporting their consciousness back to their bodies, putting them through something they were never meant to be subjected to, I think that eventually killed them. I also think *that* caused their dementia-like symptoms before they died. Or maybe “dementia-like” is incorrect - maybe this is the true pathology behind dementia, and all dementia is just a representation of untethering, for one reason or another. 

Maybe the sigil is like prions, the infectious proteins that cause CJD. There was a point in medical history when we thought prions could never act like an infection, because they were not actually considered to be “alive”. And yet, here was an example of an insignia *itself* acting as the infection. I mean, John goes out of his way to nearly say as much - he needed to “quarantine” the sigil. He certainly felt a compulsion to “reproduce” the image, he just found a way to channel it and store it away.

The sigil also seems to go out its way to protect its reproduction, too. He didn’t realize that the shape of Atlas’ eye that he felt so compelled to draw and the biochemical shape of NLRP77 were one and the same until years after he began his research on the protein. As to why he was able to last so much longer than Marjorie, maybe he didn’t die as quickly because he inadvertently detoxified himself by replicating his logbook and that sigil thousands of times, physically exuding the image from his body. Or maybe his genetics were just better able to handle the whiplash of his consciousness returning to the present. I don’t think we’ll ever really know.

He was almost successful in quarantining it, too. It seems at the last second, however, the sigil won out - because I discovered his deathbed logbook. Some part of him clearly tried to fight it, he even hid the forbidden transcripts under his mattress in the part of the bed where his key to the storage unit would have been at home. He knew where the logbook needed to go, just didn’t have the ability to get it there. In the end, I found it. 

But maybe it is something more than just an “infection” - I mean, what about Atlas? Sure does seem like a God to me. Could NLRP77 just represent a divine threshold that we were designed not to cross? A symbol deviously manufactured so that, when we had the technology to find and view it, when we were on the cusp of ascending too high for our own good, would act as a self-propagating, neurological self-destruct button? What’s more, if this is just a biologic phenomenon, how did I end up with the sigil on my eye as well, a year before I would learn anything about NLRP77? Is that not evidence that I was fated to disseminate the sigil? Was I not marked with divine purpose?

Which brings me back to my apology. As you might have gathered by now, the goal of posting all this was not exactly to memorialize John - although that was certainly a bonus for me.

His narrative, in actuality, was a delivery system that I suspected would better reproduce the sigil - within you.

You may find yourself asking why I didn’t just post the image over and over again on every corner of the internet. I don’t think that's enough, or at least it's a smaller dose than what I need to administer to achieve my intent. Take the board meeting at CellCept - only three out of eight of the board members were seemingly infected, but they all viewed the protein the same number of times. Maybe the three that were infected found themselves more intrigued by NLRP77 then their fellow board members at that presentation. Maybe they lost sleep over the possibilities of what it could really mean, for all of us. Maybe they found themselves rolling the image around in their head, blissfully unaware that they were catalyzing their own untethering.

NLRP77, to my understanding, is not just biology, nor is just divinity - it's something more. It’s the common endpoint where intellectualism and faith meet and become inseparable from each other, and John finally found it. A monkey's paw for sure, but he found it.

Or, alternatively, I’ve fallen victim to grief-induced psychosis. Certainly not impossible, especially in the context that I believe I translocated for the first time the night after I visited my childhood home and found the storage unit key. I believe Atlas delivered my consciousness back to my body a few days later, as I woke up on the floor of my apartment with new bruises and a concussion. 

In the time that my consciousness was moving backwards on that river, I found myself translocating to the exact same memory John mentions in his last entry - the one of us sharing music. The return to reality after briefly imbibing in that memory crushed any last living piece of me in its entirety. I killed Wren. I lost John. There is truly nothing left for me here. If I was uncertain about spreading the sigil, that uncertainty left me when I finished his logs and discovered he translocated to the same memory. Two dying stars once again crossing paths with each other for a fleeting moment in the night sky. 

In untethering some of you as a result of reading this, I hope to completely overwhelm Atlas to the point that he begins to fail in his godly duties, or at least slow him down from finding me on the river. John says it himself in his logs - Atlas always appears to be strained and overexerted when it materializes. Maybe there is some God that designed Atlas, too. Maybe that God didn’t anticipate the amount of life that could bloom as a result of their ambition, and Atlas is simply buckling under the pressure. My theory is that the more people I untether, the less likely Atlas is to find me - allowing me to bury myself in a time far away from here. 

Or, if NLRP77 is a deadly infection caused by some visually transmissible prokaryote, or the carefully crafted machinations of a vengeful eldritch god, the promise of velvety sleep in a time far better than this would be an exceptionally coercive thing to whisper in my ear. Effective motivation for helping manifest an apocalypse. 

I miss you, Dad. See you soon.
