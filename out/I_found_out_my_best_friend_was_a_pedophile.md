I've shared this story on other subreddits, but this is a story that still haunts me. I've ruminated on every single part of this situation, but need to keep getting it off my chest. To clarify, my therapist knows. I am currently getting help over this. This story isn't your typical horror, as there's no paranormal activity or oddities. However, this situation has given me enough horror at night, making me feel validated in the fact that this truly is a horror story.

This persons name was Marissa. I don't even care about name dropping anymore. We met in our schools broadcasting class. She was two grades above me, however, we hit it off. She came out to our class as trans, however, nobody used their correct pronouns besides me. I am a gay man, and understand what it means to stand with your community. By using her correct pronouns, not only did others start following suit, but this improved our friendship. It showed her that I was a trustworthy person, perhaps too trusting.

Rumors started flying around the class that we liked each other. These were untrue. It's unfair for me as a gay man to date a trans women as that wouldn't validate their gender identity. Also, I just saw us better as friends. However, Marissa later confessed to me that she liked me at one point. In the moment, I saw this as a complete confidence booster. I'm very self-conscious of how I look (I'm 6'2 and about 280 lbs.) I was thrilled by the thought that someone could even love me like that. However, I understand that this may have just been said to manipulate me further.

Me and Marissa have had many sexual conversations, about or virginity, masturbation, just like normal teenagers. I even told her about my childhood friend who had ghosted me due to my sexuality. She knew so much about me.

Our friendship would even last after her graduation. She got accepted into college, and ended up at the school everyone in the class was looking forward to attending. She also became the top weather anchor at the school as a freshman! I was so proud of her. She seemed to be thriving at her university. They even let her use her preferred name on their newscasts. She also started a keto diet, and lost upwards of about 50 pounds. She even encouraged me to start a low sugar diet which has made me lose 20 pounds. I was happy. She was happy. I finally got to see her in her true self, at least I thought.

It was a normal get together on a weekend I believe. We were heading to one of the best malls in our state, when she suddenly got a call from one of her best friends. It always hurt my feelings when she would hop on calls in our get togethers. Every. Time. However, I accept that I may just be sensitive.

After getting off the call with her best friend, she talked about how much she appreciated her. It was a good conversation. I was happy to know she had people keeping her company up at her school. She then told me how her friend knew even her darkest secret imaginable. I was expecting this to be about abuse, neglect, addiction. I was ready to be there for her. Until, she confessed the unimaginable.

She told me that she had an ongoing addiction to CP. I was given graphic detail of what she was addicted to, what she would download, then fucking masturbate to. I'm 17 and pretty mature for my age, however, this caught me completely off guard. I wanted to scream. I wanted to hurt her. I wanted to run and get away.

However, I was an hour from home. I had no where to go. I had a whole day to spend with her. She told me that I didn't have the best reaction to her secret. How the fuck was I supposed to react? She told me she was getting help and that she would tell her therapist soon. Her old therapist actually dropped her, unsurprisingly.

I ended up spending the day with her. The situation was stuck in my head. She kept asking why I was so down, like what she told me was completely normal. To her, it is. She talked about how there are so many pedophiles in the world, that we just don't know about it.

During this time, I found out that I was a sufferer of a disorder known as OCD. I became obsessed with the thought that if I was friends with Marissa, then I was a pedophile. If I was part of the LGBTQ+ just like Marissa, then I'm a pedophile. These are far from true.

I ended up using my OCD as an excuse to distance myself for my own sake. I needed it. There was a period in time in which only me and my therapist knew about this situation. Seemingly, I was finally moving on from this, until Marissa sent me the following text.

"Hi. It's been a minute since we last talked and I don't know if you are ready to talk yet but ill just say some things.

I unfriended you on snapchat after you said that stuff to me mainly because I felt so bad that I caused you to think terribly about a lot of stuff.

But, another thing is, it upset me. It seemed like you were only blaming me for your intrusive thoughts. And as friends, we should obviously be able to come at each other whenever one of us hurts the other whether it was on accident or on purpose. So I'm sorry to make you feel so bad and cause you to think those thoughts.

I'm sorry for randomly unfriending you. I'm sorry if I ever treated you badly in our friendship. I'll make sure to ask next time if you feel comfortable talking about these sensitive topics. If you need more time, let me know. The last thing I ever want to do is make you feel uncomfortable."

This text still haunts me. It brought me back to how I felt in the moment they told me all of this. How did they not understand that I was fucking done with them? I wanted to complete high school strong, but I don't know today if I truly can. I immediately blocked them on everything I could think of at the time.

I eventually told the teachers who had both me and Marissa in class. They then encouraged me to tell my parents, who helped me report her through a tip line. According to my closest friends, she was admitted into a mental hospital. Marissa has deleted all her social media in the recent couple of days. This gives me hope that the police did something.

My therapist is helping me juggle my feelings. I feel responsible for this all. However, I'm also trying to go easy on myself. I'm young and a victim in this situation. Whatever your opinion is on this, I urge to anyone that ends up in a similar situation as me, to get out. Drop them off, and drive the fuck away. And report this person to the police. Don't wait like I did.
