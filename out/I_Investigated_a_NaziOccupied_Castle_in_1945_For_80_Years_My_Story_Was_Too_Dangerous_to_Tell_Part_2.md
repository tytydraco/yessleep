My grandfather’s journal was the strangest thing I’d ever read. I had trouble believing it myself at first. Only once I took time to reflect did I realize it was not written as an official report to give to his general. It was handwritten in a plain notebook free of any U.S. Army markings. I now understand he wrote it for himself so he’d remember as much about the Wewelsburg incident as possible. I believe it was his intention to present it to the world one day, whenever he thought people were ready to hear it, a day he sadly never thought came. The more of it I read, the more I understood his decision and, frankly, even began to agree with it. I’m still grappling with whether making it public is the right choice. I hope I’m not making a mistake.

From the journal of Jack Mikan, 2nd Lt.

United States Army, 4th Infantry Division

July 20, 1945

We drove through the village until we reached the sisters’ cottage. I had to drive slowly. It was night and the whole village population was in the streets. I did everything I could to avoid hitting them, but they were running around frantically, screaming and bumping into the car from every side. There were too many for me to listen to any one of them, but between their screams, I heard phrases of coherent German. The people had gone raving mad, but their nonsensical talk of soil, trees, and sun seemed to have stopped.

Edith ran outside when she saw our car pull up. “What’s happening to them?” I asked her.

“Mikan, look out!” she shouted.

I had just stepped out of the car when a woman came barreling down the street at me. “My children! My children! What happened to my children?” she wailed. I managed to step aside before she ran into me, flailing her arms and letting out another bloodcurdling scream. She was the same tall brunette we had seen in the village center, the first person to go rabid after dusk.

“Help me grab her! Take her inside!” I shouted.

Schayes and Edith rushed to my side. Together, we held onto the shrieking brunette and pulled her into the sisters’ cottage. Ella shut the door behind us. Schayes and I let go of the brunette so the sisters could guide her to sit down on a chair.

“Did she follow us all the way here?” asked Schayes.

I nodded, bewildered. “She must have.”

“It’s Sabina,” said Ella. The woman calmed down upon hearing her name. She sat with her eyes closed. Her breathing was uneven and she moved in small, odd twitches.

“What happened to all of them?” I asked again.

“I don’t know. It happens every night at dusk,” Edith said. “The sun goes down and they change.”

The sisters explained Sabina was a mother of three children. She was no Nazi, but her husband was forced to join the German Wehrmacht in 1941 and died fighting the Soviets on the eastern front. Sabina’s children were living with her when Edith and Ella returned to Wewelsburg in May 1945. But once the strange behavior overtook the village in June and July, the children and their mother lost each other. Edith and Ella had not seen them. I already knew children were stricken by whatever this was the same as adults and I feared Sabina’s had succumbed to a grotesque fate.

Then Sabina started to speak. It was clear but dreamlike. “I want to see my babies…Find them for me…I want to hold them.” Her eyes remained closed and her hand reached up to cover her quivering mouth, then her whole face. “If only I could die…I’m lost…I’m damned….”

It deeply affected Ella. She bent down on her knees and clutched Sabina’s hands in her own. “No. It’s not true. You’re not.” She started to cry and hugged an unresponsive Sabina around her waist. “We weren’t lost and neither are you.”

Sabina’s hand drooped. “I am lost…I am lost….”

Edith pulled Ella up. Ella wiped her face. The four of us sat in silence for a while, observing Sabina for any other strange signs, but she remained still. It was as if there had been an intermission in the spell hanging over the village, but the people had not returned to normal. Outside, we could still hear other villagers screaming and running amok. Schayes and I were fatigued and the sisters were a wholly different kind of tired. They had been dealing with this alone for weeks after spending years in a concentration camp. We were the first help they had received and we were powerless to do anything. I tried to assure them Captain Pettit’s squad would be there tomorrow and that they would be able to help, but the sisters found little solace in my empty promise. Then Sabina stirred.

She raised her head and her eyelids slowly lifted. A pained look crossed her and she covered her face in her hands once more. She let out four short breaths as if crying, leaned her head back, and focused her eyes upward while rubbing her jaw. She dropped her hand, leaving a single tear running down each cheek. Her lips quivered, her nostrils flared, and she gritted her teeth as her mouth gradually formed an expression that was truly chilling. She tilted her head to one side, then up, then slowly brought it across the other side, all the while holding a frozen grin that bared her full set of teeth. Her eyes continued to gaze upward as if looking at something invisible to the rest of us. It was different than the idyllic look we had seen earlier. This one was a look of mischief, the kind that came from knowing something we did not. Then she went stock-still, holding the frozen expression.

“Outside. Check the others,” I said to Schayes. We opened the door. All of the villagers who had been running amok just a short while ago now lay flat in the street. They were all completely still. Those on their backs and sides with their faces showing all had the exact same look as Sabina.

“They all fell as one,” said Schayes.

“Did you notice the time at dusk?” I asked.

“I did. 2105 hours, sir.”

I checked my watch. It was 2206. If we subtracted a minute for when Sabina first adopted the mischievous expression, the entire village fell still exactly one hour after they went mad. I told Schayes we needed sleep. We went back inside. “Does this happen every night?” I asked Edith.

“Every night,” she repeated. “They become rabid for one hour, then go still until sunrise. And then it starts again.”

July 21, 1945

Schayes and I were awake before sunrise. We awaited it from the doorstep of the sisters’ cottage. The villagers stirred when the first rays appeared over the treetops to the east. One by one, and then all together, they stood up from where they had lain in the street. They resumed walking, crossing paths with one another and exchanging odd pleasantries just as they had been when we arrived the day before. Sabina opened the door and came outside.

I stopped her. “Sabina, do you know where your children are?”

She looked at me with the same face as the others and said, “They are of the soil.” It no longer seemed to bother her. I got out of her way and she walked out to the street. She had been heartbroken the night before. Now her children’s fate was of no concern.

Captain Pettit’s squad from the 14th Army arrived at 1020 hours. I met them in the village center and showed them back to the sisters’ cottage. There were nine men in all. Pettit himself had been in the war since 1942, fighting in Africa, France, and then in the final push into Germany. His next in command was 1st Lieutenant Arizin, who had fought in Belgium and Germany. There was also a holy man, Chaplain Sharman. The composition and mission of this squad was a mystery to me. Schayes and I explained to Pettit everything we had seen in the village thus far. He listened and took everything we said seriously despite our report’s unusual nature. Pettit then posted the rest of his men outside while he and Arizin briefed us in the cottage. They agreed to allow Edith and Ella to listen in, though as the sisters only spoke German, I could not tell how much they absorbed.

Pettit began. Without specifics, he told us about something called “Operation Overcast.” It was an effort by the Allies to acquire top Nazi scientists and engineers before the Soviets did (Note from grandson here: Overcast was the program name at the time of my grandfather’s writing. Later in 1945 it was renamed Operation Paperclip, which it is better known by today). Some of these Nazis were war criminals, but their technical knowledge was considered too important to lose or let fall into Communist hands. Pettit’s squad was a part of something similar but different called “Operation Oxcart.” Its mission was to investigate the occult elements within the Nazi Party, assess them for any real-world utility, and acquire their practitioners and artifacts ahead of the Soviets. They had been hunting Wolfgang Müller since before the war ended.

Arizin spread a series of partially redacted papers and charts across a table for us while Pettit talked. “The Nazi concept of Aryan superiority is not as simple as you have been told. To the real hardliner Nazis, it has its roots deep in their version of the occult. Now this isn’t Satan and pentagrams. The Nazi occult is something that good men like you and I and the two kind sisters here would otherwise have never heard of. It combines ancient Nordic paganism with something called Theosophy, a pseudo-religion invented by a Russian New Yorker named Helena Blavatsky in the 1870s. They believe human civilization is traced back to what they call the seven root races. First were the Polarians, who didn’t have bodies at all. They were supposed to be spirits of pure energy concentrated above the north magnetic pole on a continent the ancient Greeks called Hyperborea. The second root race evolved from them, and these Hyperboreans were flesh and blood. They were said to have thousand-year lifespans, communicated telepathically, and had eyes set far apart on their heads to see forward and side-to-side simultaneously, meaning their peripheral vision effectively extended behind—”

Pettit abruptly stopped. He must have detected the skeptical look I allowed to cross my face. “Do I sound like I’m taking this anything but seriously?” he asked as he crossed his arms and looked down at me. “I was put in charge of this because of my ability to approach any threat with absolute sincerity, no matter how preposterous it may seem. I’ve seen things you wouldn’t even know to have nightmares about, Lieutenant. While we’re here, you will take this as seriously as you would a panzer division. Is that clear?”

“Yes, Captain,” I replied.

Arizin chimed in. “Hitler may not have believed the occult side of Nazism, but Himmler, Heydrich, Müller, and all the top SS guys did. And that’s why we can’t risk dismissing it.”

Pettit continued. “Hyperboreans could physically bond themselves to nature and had no need for solid food. They absorbed what they needed from sunlight, plants, minerals, and water vapor from the air. They reproduced through budding with offspring growing off the body of the parent like a plant. They could even charge the atmosphere through light and vibration, and conserve that energy in the underground walls of their temples. A great cataclysm of some kind eventually destroyed Hyperborea, but the survivors became the third root race on a new continent known as Lemuria. They moved south away from the pole, thereby losing some of their Hyperborean abilities. This process occurred two more times, with the Lemurians giving way to the fourth root race, the Atlanteans, and the Atlanteans to the ancestors of modern Europeans. People like Himmler believed us to be in the period of the fifth root race today, the Aryans. The SS were supposed to be the purebred genetic and spiritual inheritors of this history.”

Arizin added, “There’s a big Nazi book on all this called The Myth of the Twentieth Century by Alfred Rosenberg, and if you want to read it, just don’t fucking bother because we’ve already spared you the trouble.”

“Despite Lieutenant Arizin’s candor, I assure you he takes this as seriously as I do,” Pettit went on. “Men like Himmler and Müller were obsessed with contacting and resurrecting spirits of the Hyperboreans. They saw it as key to reclaiming their lost heritage, what they call ‘the race soul,’ which they thought would win them the war and dominate the other races. Himmler intended Wewelsburg Castle to become his Aryan Vatican. It’s where he planned to indoctrinate future generations of SS and make it the spiritual center of Germany. Müller was to be a major part of this. The legend behind his nickname is clever. Get too close to the Solar Man and you burn. But the truth goes deeper. The SS claim Müller has an unusually pure strain of Aryan blood, and they allegedly traced his ancestry to a line of ancient Teutonic knights. Going even further, they believe he is a descendant of Hyperborean nobility and that he possesses a clairvoyant memory that allows him to see and experience what his ancestors did hundreds of thousands of years ago. If the SS were planning a ritual to resurrect the Hyperboreans, Müller would have been key to any attempt. His nickname is a tribute to the importance of the sun in Teutonic pagan ceremonies and in Hyperborea, where it stayed above the horizon year-round. Mikan, you said these two women told you the change first came over the village on June 21st. Do you know the significance of that date?”

“No, sir.”

Pettit gave a knowing look. “The 21st was the date of this year’s summer solstice, the day when the sun is highest relative to the equator, with the most daylight of the year.”

I wondered, could Pettit be right about everything? Could Wolfgang Müller have gone to Wewelsburg Castle on the 21st to perform an occult Nazi ritual that was somehow to blame for everything we had seen in the village and was still hiding in the castle now? I had no other theory of my own. However, part of me questioned some of the facts Pettit presented. While the 21st being the solstice had not occurred to me, I knew enough about basic astronomy to know that the sun was only fully above the horizon at the poles from the spring to fall equinoxes. Not all year. I wondered if Pettit and his squad were taking the idea of Hyperborea too seriously.

Pettit then spoke to Edith and Ella in fluent German, surprising us all. “I don’t know why what’s affected the others hasn’t affected you, but Müller is as bad as they come. After everything you’ve been through, the last thing I’d want is for him to find you. I can arrange to have you taken elsewhere, anywhere you want to go.”

The sisters shared a look but didn’t need to discuss it. “We’re staying,” said Ella.

Edith nodded. “We’ve been told to leave our home too many times. We’re not afraid to stay.”

Pettit nodded back. “While I disagree with your decision, I respect it. It’s your right to stay.”

The briefing ended soon after. Pettit sent a recon team of three men to the castle ahead of the rest. His plan was to breach the castle at 1400 hours. Schayes and I were now part of the operation. Our objective was to apprehend Müller and any other SS remnants inside, determine if a ritual to contact the Hyperboreans had been performed, and collect any evidence of it.

“How can we be sure what happened to the villagers won’t happen to us?” I asked Pettit.

“That’s what the good Chaplain is for. Chaplain Sharman here is closer to the Lord than any man I know.”

We were now in the village center with the rest of Pettit’s men. Chaplain Sharman put a hand on my shoulder. “The God I know would call this root race occultism an abomination. He saw Captain Pettit and I through Morocco, Algeria, D-Day, and the Bulge. He’ll see us through this.”

I noticed the canvas field pack Sharman wore on his back. It wasn’t for carrying weapons and I could tell there was more than just a Bible and food rations inside. I wondered if there was anything Pettit and his men were still keeping from us. The recon team returned shortly after. They reported seeing no SS men or any armaments around the castle. If the SS were inside, they seemingly did not intend to hold it as a defensible position.

We moved on the castle at 1400 as planned. Pettit and Arizin led us on foot up the tree-covered hill onto a stone bridge that curved left over a dry moat to the entrance on the castle’s east wing. The double oak doors had been smashed open when the 83rd rolled through in April, and they remained that way now. We proceeded into the triangular central courtyard with our M1 rifles ready. There were three stories of windows above us, but no movement. We proceeded through a door at the base of the southeast tower. The knob had curiously broken off. Whoever was inside had not bothered to secure it after breaking in. The halls were silent. Only bare hooks and nails remained on the walls. There were no tapestries, artwork, or relics. Anything the SS did not remove when they fled ahead of the 83rd had since been taken by the American soldiers or German civilians.

Unlike the day before, this day was cloudy with the imminent threat of rain. The electricity had been cut months before and many of the windows were broken and boarded up. Light became scant and several of us turned on flashlights. My skin tingled. The air felt thick and produced a subtle thrumming in my ears. Schayes said he felt it too.

We navigated a sharp corner. “Captain,” one of Pettit’s men in front of me spoke up, “look at this.”

We all stopped and turned our flashlights at the same point as his. There was a human eyeball embedded in the granite wall. It was aimed along the direction of the wall surface, not facing outward. We looked closer and saw lines of a skeleton among the stone blocks. It looked as if bone and stone had combined into one, as if the whole human had sunk into the wall and all the tissue disintegrated, leaving only the silhouette of its skeleton and an eyeball. I stepped back from it as Arizin crouched to look more closely.

Arizin followed the lines of the skeleton with his light. “He was running when it happened. The bastard was trying to escape,” he said. Then I saw it. The lines in the stone showed a skeleton in mid-sprint, frozen in stone in a flash.

“Shit!” exclaimed one of the men, immediately hushing his voice. “The eye moved.”

We all watched it. The eye in the wall twitched and its iris pointed at us. I saw something else between the stones, something pink and flailing. A human tongue moved back and forth. Then we heard a scream. It was a male voice in despair and agony. It came from no one direction but from all around us, unlike the screams of the dying I had heard on the front. The tongue turned to sand, breaking apart onto the floor, and the eyeball hardened until the wall consumed it fully. Pettit had said in his briefing that Hyperboreans could physically bond themselves to nature. I wondered if the spirit of one had done so to this man, likely an SS officer, and bonded him to the minerals in the wall. It was very much like what I had seen in some of the villagers. One of the men photographed it and we continued.

Our squad proceeded up a staircase and back down another dark corridor. There were no sounds of the living, only more of the unpleasant thrumming sound. We cased the long east wing back and forth down the length of the corridor on each floor, entering rooms and working our way up from the second floor to the third. We found spent bullet cartridges, trash, burnt, papers, and broken furniture, but nothing that pointed to an occult ritual. The thrumming came and went, but each time it returned, the sound grew more precise. Eventually, it sounded like a baritone voice speaking strange single syllables I cannot describe. The voice came from no particular direction or source. It was all around us wherever we went.

At the end of the corridor on the third floor we entered the north tower. The towers were circular and the north tower was the widest of the three. We passed through an antechamber and into what Pettit called the generals’ hall. The thrumming voice ceased when we entered. This large room was brighter, with twelve narrow windows spaced between twelve columns encircling the round hall. The floor and ceiling were smooth marble, not the rough stone of the rest of the castle. In the center of the floor was a strange design. There was a large black ring ten feet in diameter connected to two smaller black circles at its center by twelve jagged lines. I knew these jagged lines to be Germanic sig runes. When two of these runes were paired, they formed the dreaded ‘double lightning bolt’ symbol of the SS.

“The black sun,” said Pettit. “This is where they would have met had they won the war, gentlemen.”

It looked the part of an Aryan Vatican, somewhere for Heinrich Himmler and his SS generals to gather and plot. We kept looking and went down a spiral stairwell into the castle’s crypt. It was under a 30-foot-high domed ceiling with eight slanted alcoves carved out of it. At the top of the ceiling was an ornate swastika sculpted to mirror the black sun on the floor of the generals’ hall directly above it. In the center of the floor was an unlit, circular firepit ringed by a curving concrete pedestal. Twelve smaller stone pedestals surrounded the crypt along the wall. We had to be at least one or two stories underground, but the height of the ceiling made it hard to tell. There was a large bronze urn beside the firepit, filled to the brim with silver.

“Totenkopf rings,” I said to the group as I removed a handful of the silver rings. They were engraved with Nazi symbols. Each one had a Totenkopf, the death’s head skull, as well as double sig runes and a swastika. “There could be a thousand of them.”

(Grandson again here: As of 2023, no one including the U.S. Army knows the location of the over 14,500 Totenkopf rings made in Nazi Germany. Himmler reportedly ordered they all be entombed inside a mountain near Wewelsburg, but they have never been found. If his account is true, my grandfather may have been the last person alive to see them.)

Pettit examined one. “Gerhard Gorman. 27 August 1937. They have the wearer’s name and the date the ring was awarded on the inside,” he said. “The 83rd would have taken these. Müller must have brought them with him.”

The thrumming voice returned. The syllables were crisper now, though it was not a language any of us had ever heard. We noticed something else about it. We were in a tall, domed chamber, yet there was no echo. Several of us remarked on it.

“Captain Pettit,” Schayes spoke up. “I think I know where the voice is coming from.”

“Go on, Corporal,” said Pettit.

“I hear it in my right ear just as well as my left. But I went deaf in my right ear when my platoon was shelled a year ago. It’s not a sound at all. That’s why there’s no echo. You said the Hyperboreans communicated telepathically. It’s in our heads, sir.”

The chilling effect on the rest of us was instant. We shared uncertain looks, each of us thinking versions of the same thought: if it was speaking into our minds, what else might it do to us? We had all seen what happened to many of the villagers, but for the first time, I was afraid for myself.

“Any advice, Chaplain?” I asked Sharman.

“The Lord guided us here for a reason. He guided you to the sisters and guided us to you. He hasn’t let anything harm us yet.” He quoted something from the Bible. “Fear not. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.”

Pettit told us to keep moving. Our objective was still to locate Müller, and we had more of the castle to search. We went back up the spiral staircase and checked up and down the corridors of the west wing. We found strange mounds of dirt and rock. We found a large growth of moss in the rough shape of a human body stretched across the floor, as if the man it used to be was crawling away, desperate to escape his fate. We found six such oddities in all, the seeming remains of men that had been reduced to the elements. There were surely more to be found in the rest of the castle and our chances of finding Müller dwindled. But then, in another dark spiral stairwell between the second and third floors of the southwest tower, he found us. Pettit held up his hand. We all stopped. Arizin moved up beside him and the rest of us fell in line behind them. We heard footsteps above us, the kind made by combat boots.

A voice spoke to us in German from around the curve of the stairwell. “Welcome to the center of the past and future world,” it said slowly in a tone that sounded like a very loud and harsh whisper.

“Oberführer Müller, we have retaken the castle. I have the men and guns to apprehend you and any men you have left,” Pettit said back in German.

“You are Americans,” the hissing voice said in English. “Your accent is like sandpaper to my ears.”

“I could tell you the same. I’m Captain Pettit of the United States Army. The war’s over. Let’s not make this bloodier than it has to be.”

We heard the footsteps coming closer. I tightened my grip on the M1. Then we saw him. Wolfgang Müller came around the curve of the wall. He was unarmed with his palms open at his sides, but I gulped when I saw him. He was shirtless and his body strong and lean, but on his chest was a tattoo of the black sun from the generals’ hall, and on his face was a pagan mask. There was a faceplate made from an animal skull rimmed with fur and straw. Sprouting from the top on one side was an antler and from the other side a jagged tree branch. I could not see his eyes through the shadows.

“I offer you my surrender, Captain,” Müller said. “But first there is much you will [wish to see.](https://connorgunnin.com/)”
