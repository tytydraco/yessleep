There were 4 of us, me, my husband Marvin, my best friend and her boyfriend Tom. We were having a drink and watching a movie, I can't remember what it was called but it was about a deaf woman who lived alone and someone trying to break into her house. About half way through, Marvin dismisses himself to go to the toilet so the 3 of us start talking about what we would do if we were in a situation similar to the movie. Then Tom jokes about how we should prank Marvin by pretending to break into our home one day. We laughed it off but he kept persisting, "should we? Should we? I'll do it!" At first I thought it was cruel but then I wondered what Marvin would do, how would he act? So we agreed we would. 

It was almost 3 weeks later when the prank came into play. It was about 8pm, we were watching TV in the living room and I pretended to get a phone call. I left the room to take the call. I had bought some hidden cameras to record the prank and while I was gone, I set them up. I sellotaped the first above the front door, this would record the hallway and most of the living room if the door was open. The second one was positioned in the corner of the kitchen. I'm not great at describing but it's important you know how the kitchen is laid out. It's square, roughly 12 by 12 foot. There's a door in the middle of the South wall leading to the dining room and out the back garden, another door on the East wall about 3 foot away from the South wall. The camera was positioned in the corner of the East and North wall, it could see the whole kitchen except the door on the East wall and had good visibility of the dining room. Now the cameras are set up, it's time for the prank.

I open the living room door and tell Marvin it was my mom on the phone and she needs help with something so I'm just going to help her out and I'll be right back. Roughly half hour after I was gone, I got a phone call from Marvin, he sounded scared and panicked, "it's Tom.....I've killed Tom!" I rushed back and Marvin was sitting there next to Tom's body in the kitchen. I told him to go sit in the living room and calm down while I think about what we can do. I quickly grab the cameras and plug them into the laptop, this is what I saw...

...20 minutes after I left, Marvin walks into the kitchen and starts washing the dishes, after a couple of minutes, the backdoor opens and Tom walks in through the dining room, dressed in black with a mask and a BB gun. Marvin turns around and sees him, Tom points the gun at Marvin. I don't know if anything is being said because the cameras don't have sound but Marvin with one swift movement, pulls his hands out the sink and throws a plate like a frisbee towards Tom, Tom ducks but Marvin has ran out the room by the time Tom stands back up. He is hiding behind the wall of the East door. Tom walks into the kitchen pointing the gun, as his about to walk through the East door, Marvin quickly steps out from behind the wall and throws a pan at Tom, Tom leans to the side to dodge it but I feel like this was Marvin's intention... because he had another pan behind his back which he swung at Tom and hit him in the head. Tom fell to the floor below camera visibility and then Marvin got on top of him, and all I could see was Marvin raising the pan and swinging it down again multiple times which I can only assume that he was smashing Tom in the face. After 30 seconds of this, Marvin reaches down and lifts up the mask. He then drops it and jumps to one side, he takes his phone out his pocket and that's when he called me.

I don't know what to do, I can't tell him it was a prank...
