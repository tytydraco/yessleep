When I was a kid, around the age of 7 or 8, me and my elementary school friends heard from local playground banter about a new awesome videogame called "Minecraft."

You could build anything you wanted, conquer the world, and do everything your mind desired.

Minecraft was a major part of my early years. Its where I made a wide variety of friends as a kid, and also the source of my elementary and middle school popularity due to my skill.

I think I spent close to 30000 hours over the course of my youth playing Minecraft. 

I loved it.

Yet, despite my long-running playtime, I never made more than 1 world. 

This world, dubbed "Brianville" by my amazing parents, was the pride and joy of my life for a solid 5 years. 

In this world, I had so much stuff that, thinking back on it now, I might as well have been a god, as the entire world was forged, morphed, and shaped to suit what I saw as good and cool.

In the center of the map, I had a massive house, 5 stories up and expansive. 

I had 5 farms, all of which grew different types of things. Animals, plants, netherwart, coral, and sugarcane. 

I had my very own mine that stretched the entirety of the map, covering every square block. 

And of course, as every player does, I had a wide variety of pets. Cats, fish, and some exotic ones like creepers and skeleton horses.

But my favorite pet of all was my dog, who I named Stephen after my baby brother, although I always called him Steppy.

I won't go into further detail of my world, but the bottom line is that I dedicated so much time and effort into making it as cool and awesome as I could.

Yet, life moves like a train, and you can't stay behind forever. So, once high-school rolled around, and the work began to ramp up, I stopped playing Minecraft altogether. 

After high-school, I went to college, and by that point, I had completely forgotten about the existence of my world as a whole. 

I just had too much on my plate at once to be worried about a children's game. 

Yet, as fast as I entered high-school, I ended my college career with a master's degree in architecture. Some of my friends from the old elementary school days were there too, all of them people I had invited to my world.

As soon as I graduated, I had been picked up by a well paying architecture firm 3 states away. My parents pushed me to take it, and 2 weeks after my interview, I was packing my stuff to move to my new home. 

As I was piling stuff away into their respective boxes, I eventually hollowed out my room, leaving one item remaining.

The I-Pad I had used to play Minecraft all those years ago, with the charger right on top of it. 

I was jubilant upon seeing it. It had been years since I had even seen it, let alone touched it.

It was dusty and old, almost completely conquered by a vast array of dust and age. However, I was dead set on doing something I had not planned for at that point.

Going back in, one last time.

So, after brushing off the dust and accumulated particles from the screen, and giving it a moment to charge, I opened the Minecraft app.

Since I had not touched this thing in years, it wasnt updated, but I didnt really care all that much. I was only going to reacquaint myself with the world for maybe 20 minutes or so, and then I would put it away.

And there, untouched and undisturbed, was my world.

Without any further pause, I clicked on the world. 

Upon loading in, a giant wave of memories slammed into me like a truck. 

My room, decorated head to toe in monster heads, banners, and artifacts from my adventures, shot me back into the past. This room was the first thing me and my friends built together. 

As I explored further, I couldn't help but start to tear up a small bit. Every room had its own memory attached to it, with every block activating a special part of my mind. There wasn't one speck in that house that didnt resonate with my heart. 

Eventually, after clearing out the whole house, and cleaning my face of the beads of tears that had left long stains across my face, I realized something.

I couldn't find Steppy, or for that matter, any of my pets.  

They was usually, as my memory served, somewhere on the top floor, where I built little rooms for them that resembled where I found them. 

So, I traveled to the 5th floor of my house, and saw my pet areas, but they had no pets in them.

I know that mobs despawn in Minecraft after a certain amount of time, but I had nametags on all of these, which I remembered stopped that from happening.

A part of me felt an aching feeling, as I wanted to give a last goodbye to what I saw as the only "living" things in this home. I had to find them.

I just had to.

So, considering I had checked the whole house over, I decides to head outside. Before I put my finger on the I-Pad to open the door, a part of me felt uneasy. 

Something about this world felt...off. Like I wasn't wanted here. The home felt safe, but next to that door, I felt this intense dread.

I attributed it to my annoyance at the difficulty of finding my pets, as I had similar feelings.

And so, I opened the door.

I was immediately given a reason to my unease.

The surrounding grass, dirt, and overall life of the world looked like it had been sucked out. The grass was a sickly gray, like it had died and frosted over. The dirt looked almost like it had lost all nutrients, being a solid block of light, sandy brown. 

The worst bit was the sky. There was no color to it besides this weirdly dark gray color. The sun was no where to be found. 

That sky had a weird feeling that came with it. The more I stared up at it in game, the queasier I felt in real life. It felt like as though I was being actively diseased with some sort of flu.

My head began to pound, and my stomach felt as though someone was playing pattycake with my insides.

I looked down, and all of the sudden, the pain wore off.

I was extremely puzzled, and above all else, frightened. 

Yet, it didnt dissuade me as it would most other people. I was committed to finding my pets.

So, I pushed on, looking down at the grass to avoid whatever affliction the sky gave me. 

Maybe it was just unease, I thought. Maybe it was just me finally recovering from stress. 

Looking down at the grass made everything extremely difficult, as, obviously, I couldn't see anything ahead of me. The sky sickness had, by this point, completely subsided.

My anxiety did not. 

That feeling of displacement of myself only mounted the longer I stayed in that world. Every sound threatened to tip me off the edge, the noise of my character moving a spark in my mind, one that was filled with gunpowder. 

Suddenly, I hit this weird cobblestone patch. I tried to move around it, but as my character passed it, I was immediately sucked back in to the front of it, my character forced to look up. 

I wasn't staring at the sky, which had turned into a brighter shade of gray, and didnt make me feel sick. Instead, I was locked in to a sign atop the cobblestone. 

The cobblestone wasn't a splotch either. It was a monument of sorts, stacked almost purposefully to look like a makeshift grave.

However, of all of the oddities that came with this odd monument, I was forced to drop the I-Pad and back away from it due to what was written on the signs attached to it. 

"Here lies Bomby, Sheepo, Goldilocks, and Steppy, abandoned by someone they thought loved them."

I couldn't go back to the I-Pad for what felt like hours. Did a friend of mine do this to mess with me? Had someone hacked my world that didnt like me? Were my parents screwing with me?

I couldnt make sense of it. Yet, as my fear subsided, I began to be inundated by a much heavier and denser feeling.

Guilt. 

And I think whatever made that monument knew it.

After I finally returned to my game, I was no longer at the monument. I was in front of my house. The sky had returned to a bright blue color, and everything looked like it had been injected with soul and joy.

I began to relax a bit, but I knew that it couldn't have been a bug. 

No code break could create a sign like that. 

It made no sense. None of it made sense. Why didnt any of it make any fucking sense?

Then, a second after these thoughts, I began to hear laughter. Not evil or menacing laughs, but children's laughs.

As they got closer, I began to identify whose laughs they were.

They were mine.

More laughs could be heard, and suddenly, upon me turning to face the oak and birth forest that surrounding our house, I saw the weirdest and most jarring thing I believe I will ever see.

Me, my friends, and the pets, all bunny hopping to the house. 

I thought for a second, and remembered exactly what moment this was. 

We had just killed the Ender Dragon, and we were celebrating. 

I couldn't believe it. Those laughs didnt inspire fear or nervousness in my body. Seeing myself didnt scare me. 

I was...happy.

As me and my friends opened the door to my house, and began their walk to our certified Artifact Chamber, the pets didnt go in with them.

They stopped outside the door, and in a split second, they turned to look at me. 

Judgement. The only thing I could feel in that moment was judgement. There was no soul behind their models, and yet, in that moment, I could feel a deep resentment emanating from all 4 of them. 

Suddenly, the chat opened, with message from Bomby, the pet Creeper. 

<Bomby> Why

I didnt know what to do, or for that matter, if I should keep the world going. A part of me wanted to respond, but the other part of me was too scared to move even a finger.

<Bomby> Why did you leave us

The judgement began to crush me, an anvil of shame and guilt crushing my mental state like a vise. 

<Bomby> Brian. Please, talk to me.

Judgement began to dissolve, replaced then by the emotion that would come to define the rest of the conversation.

Sadness.

I had to reply at this point

<brianrulez> Im sorry. I grew up. I became too busy.

<Bomby> You were too busy to check on us? To love us?

<brianrulez> I didnt know you were real. How could I have known that.

<Bomby> Yes, how could you. We have been asking that for a while.

I felt horrible. I felt like I had killed someone. I felt...sorry.

<brianrulez> I didnt know. Im sorry. You have to know that. You have to know that Im sorry.

Bomby stopped talking, and Sheepo (you can infer what they were) began to speak in place of Bomby.

<Sheepo> Why are you here now of all times. You must still be very busy.

The sarcasm in that message was intoxicating.

<brianrulez> I just finished college. I got a good job. I found my I-Pad after cleaning my room, and decided to give a last goodbye.

<Sheepo> So this is goodbye forever?

That message shot a hot, rusty dagger straight through my heart.

<brianrulez> Yes

Sheepo stopped talking, and Goldilocks, my pet kitty, spoke up.

<Goldilocks> You saw your past memories. You saw what you had. Even if you age, why couldn't you come see us ever?

<brianrulez> My friends aged too. That's just the way it works.

<Goldilocks> Do you think you'd stay if it didnt work that way?

That question got me thinking. If we really did all stay kids forever, and never aged, would we...enjoy that? Sure, I'd be able to be free and innocent forever, and never have to do certain things. 

But...that's not a good thing. We need to mature. We need to age. 

If life went on forever, then what is special about it?

<brianrulez> If it did, yes, but then we'd all be sad. 

Finally, Steppy emerged into the chat.

<Steppy> Its been a long time, hasn't it? Remember how you saved me with a healing potion in the end? It was a perfect throw.

<brianrulez> hahaha. yeah, it was.

<Steppy> It was the best day of my life.

<brianrulez> It was mine too, for a time. 

Talking with Steppy, I couldn't help but feel warm and fuzzy. It felt like seeing your family after a long time, or catching up with an old teacher.

No. It was like...no it wasn't like catching up with an old friend.

It was 100% catching up with an old friend

<Steppy> Brian. Do you love us?

<brianrulez> Of course. I always did, and always will. That's the cool part of us humans. We remember things forever, even if we think we forget.

<Steppy> That is cool.

The more and more I talked, the weaker and weaker my resilience against bursting into a mess of cries and wails became.

<Steppy> When do you have to leave?

<brianrulez> In 2 minutes. 

The final messages I received took exactly 2 minutes for Steppy to post. Whether or not that time was spent thinking or typing, I dont know. 

But what I do know is that I will remember it forever.

<Steppy> Brian. I dont know if you think what you're seeing is true or not. But you should know something. Behind all the resentment we showed you, all the anger, lies care. You were an amazing kid. You were kind, funny, sweet, and smart. We were happiest with you and your pals. We were happiest on your little adventures. But above all else, we were happiest with this world that you made. 
<Steppy> We love you, Brian. If no one else thinks like that, we do. 
<Steppy> Don't forget us. So long, buddy. 

And with that, the app closed itself; in place of the happy, excited soul I was some hour ago, was a broken, crying, destroyed mess of a man. 

6 years have passed since that day. I now am the manager of my architecture firm, and I now have a son of my own, a wife, and a nice house.

Yet, just as important as that, I found a way to upload my world to my son's computer. One of my buddies from the old days actually got a job at Mojang, and found a way for me to do so. Hes been playing on it every day after finishing his schoolwork, just like I did when I was a boy. 

Sometimes I peak in to see him play, and everytime I do, he looks at the chat box, turns to me, and says "My friends say hi, Dad!" I dont think he'll ever understand just how much that means to me.

But of course, as is the bane of every young boy, he has a bedtime. On his bedside rests 4 plush toys I bought him with the computer.

A Creeper, a Sheep, a Cat, and a Dog.

Some might call me crazy to say that I think they watch over him, like how they watched over me.

You might be right. Maybe they dont.

But I like to think they do.
