I keep telling myself I should have blocked him earlier. Most of the time I ignore strangers who slide into my messages with demands right from the start but  he was different. He was not rude in any way, just persistent in that slow drip way that eventualy wears you down.

He always asked for the same thing. A new story. No payment. No reason. Just a needy little message every other day at first, then every day, then every few hours.  At the start I did not answer. He would send a waving hand emoji followed by a sentence like a child making a wish.  
  
\-"*Write me a scarecrow story"* he asked. 

I let a week go by, then two. He keept asking.  Then one night he wrote something new  
  
*-"I need it tonight"*  
*-"please"*  
*-"he is in the field"*

I stared at that for a while. I typed and erased two replies. Anyone would think I should have blocked him and moved on. I thought the same but then curiosity won.

I sent back a question.  
*-"What field?"*

He answered in seconds.  
  
*-"behind my house"*  
*-"there is a small field"*  
*-"I can see him from the kitchen if I stand on the chair"*

I asked who he meant.

\-*"the scarecrow"*  
\-*"he comes when I stop reading about him"*  
\-*"that is why I ask people to write"*  
\-*"if I keep reading, he does not move"*

I told him to cut it out. I said it was not funny. He sent a photo taken through a window. It was hard to see anything but the blur of a yard light and night beyond it. In the middle of the dark was a shape that could have been a person or a bundle of sticks. The head looked round and odd. I could make out a hat that sat a little too low

He kept writing.

*-"if I scroll long enough or if someone writes it pushes him back"*  
*-"even one sentance helps"*  
*-"it is like he needs to be told away"*

I wanted to prove to myself that he was playing a simple trick. So I did the dumb thing and played along. I typed four sentences on my phone. They were nothing. The scarecrow in the old field watches crows and weather. The wind pulls at his straw and the rope on his wrists rubs a groove into the post. He cannot step down because he was built to hold still. He turns his head only when no one is looking.

I hit send and He replied with relief like I had just thrown him a rope.

*-"thank you"*  
*-"he stepped back toward the trees"*  
*-"it works when someone else writes it"*  
*-"mine do not work on him anymore"*

The way he wrote  that cought my attention, it sounded real. Not that i belived him, but the timings on those messages felt like he was exhausted. I told him he should call someone. A friend or a neighbor. The police if he really felt threatened.

*-"I called them before"*  
*-"they came in the day and they laughed"*  
*-"my neighbor said it is a prank"*  
*-"but there are no kids near here"*  
*-"I do not know who would make him move at night"*

He kept asking. Another paragraph. Then another. He started to beg in small words. A bit anoying but i felt strange symphaty. 

The next night he sent a voice message. I turned my volume down and listened. There were slow creaks like old wood, a dry rustle that sounded like someone dragging a broom across a porch, and something that might have been a breath through cloth. Then his whisper.

*-"Please write now. Please."*

I wrote again. I told myself I was just helping a stranger calm down. I wrote a few lines about the scarecrow staying tangled on his post while the stars turned. I sent it. He told me it helped. I tried to sleep and kept thinking about the broom sound.

After that he shifted from annoying to urgent. He timed his messages to my evenings. He watched for the little typing bubble. If I took too long he would push again.

*-"he is closer"*  
*-"I can see the stitches in the sack now"*

I asked for another photo. He sent one from the back door. It showed a fence and a yard gone flat and silver under frost. Beyond the fence, the line of trees made a black lid against the sky. In front of them stood a figure that could have been a man in rough clothes. Arms hung at its sides. The hat sat so low it looked like his eyes were suposed to be on the hat. There was a gap across the chest where straw poked out like rib hair.

My stomach went cold. Not from fear. From the detail I could not unsee. The scarecorw was not on a post.

I keep telling myself this could still be a person playing dress up. Maybe a mannequin. Maybe a cruel joke. I remind myself that cameras flatten distance. I remind myself that night makes familiar things look wrong. I text him another little piece because it made him go quiet.

Its the third night and I have a bad taste about the whole thing. He sends a picture every hour. The figure moved in small ways. A step. A turn. The arms did not hold out like a cheap scarecrow. They hung and then lifted and then hung again. In one photo the left hand rested on the top wire of the fence. In the next, both hands pressed into the fence as if testing it. He wrote:

*-"I think he smiles under the sack"*  
*-"the stitches pull tight when he is close"*

I did not answer that one. I set the phone face down and watched the ceiling and listened to the house settle. When I checked again there were more messages. He had started to offer money.

*-"I will pay you"*  
*-"I can send you proof"*  
*-"please write one page"*  
*-"i need him to go back to the trees"*

I told him to put on lights and go to a hotel. He said he could not leave yet. He said he had tried. The words were strange and plain.

*-"he waits by the car now"*

I thought about going to pick him up myself but I did not know his address. I asked for it. He sent a pin that landed on a road I did not recognize, too far to drive, hundreds of miles away from my town. The name of the road looked like a surname. I am not driving that far for a posible prank. I promised him one more short piece and then I would be done.

I wrote eight sentences about a field emptying at dawn. I tried to make it gentle. I hit send. He replied with a single word.  
  
\-"thanx"

That should have been the end. The next afternoon he messaged again and said he could still see the hat through the trees. He asked for a longer story because night would come. I did not answer. I was tired of the way he felt like a weight in my pocket. I was tired of doing work for a stranger who would never be satisfied. I blocked him and put my phone on the table and went for a walk to clear my head.

When I came back there were three new messages waiting in my inbox. Same guy, same content:

*-"write me a scarecrow story"*

I did not even open them. I made dinner. I watched a dumb video. I turned my phone face down. I did not sleep well. I dreamed of burlap that tasted like dust on my tongue.

The next morning my screen was stacked with messages. They climbed over each other all the way to two in the morning.

*-"he is at the fence"*  
*-"he is in the yard"*  
*-"he is on the porch"*  
*-"please"*  
*-"I can hear him at the glass"*  
*-"please write now"*  
*-"please"*

There was a voice message that began with a scrape like straw against wood and ended with a sound that made my hair pull tight. It was small and excited, the soft squeal a child makes when a surprise lands. That is the only way I can describe it. I did not press play again.

Then nothing. No new dot next to his name. The account went gray and stayed that way. I waited half a day before I felt brave enough to check one more time. Still gray.

I told myself this was where it ends. I would tell myself he found sleep or help. I tried not to imagine him opening a door he should not have opened. I tried not to picture stitches spreading like a grin. I put my phone in a drawer and went outside.

There is a field behind my building. Not mine. It belongs to the property next door. Grass and weeds and a low fence with a gate that sticks. In the day it looks ordinary. At night it is a flat dark floor where anything could stand. I have looked at it a thousand times without thinking.

On the third night of silence I woke up thirsty and went to the kitchen. When I passed the back window I stopped and stepped back. There was a shape at the far end of the field. It could have been one of the trash barrels the farmer uses. It could have been a stump. It stood like a man who forgot where he was going.

I told myself I was doing this to prove I was not scared. I turned on the porch light. The bulb hummed. The shape did not move. It was too far to be certain. I turned the light off and waited. The house ticked and sighed. I was about to laugh at myself when a faint rustle scraped along the fence.

The next morning something caught on my screen door. A strand of pale straw about as long as my hand, pinched flat as if pressed under a seam. I do not have hay here. I do not even have a doormat. I picked it off and carried it to the trash and stood there a long time with my hand in the bin before I let it go.

I decided to send that guy a message.

*-"Are you there?"*

No reply.  
  
The next day, i found  a scrap of paper pined to a railing on my porch. One sentance:  
  
*"Do not mention me again‚Äù*  
   
\-written in a shaky scrawl,  It looks like a pencil trace, strange. Old. 

I ran back in and locked the back door, drew the curtain over the glass and put a chair under the knob like people do in old movies. I sat at the table and keep telling myself to breathe. I went back and scrolled through our old messages and read them again from the start. Something clicked then in an ugly way. For how long did his own stories work? Did he get punished because i stoped writing? Is that thing here now?

I opened a blank note. I put the cursor down and did not begin. I tried to be logical. If it was a prank then someone was going to a lot of trouble to spook me for no reason. If it was a trick of the eye then why did the straw on my door smell sweet and old like a bale left in a barn all winter. If it was nothing then why did I keep hearing the faint brush of something dry touch the siding near the back steps, not once but twice, as if to remind me to count.

It is full dark now. The chair under the knob wobbles if I bump it. I have every light in the house on like a child. I moved a heavy bookcase in front of the curtain because I could not stand the idea of that thin glass. I put a saucepan on the stove and left the burner off and told myself that if I needed a reason to go into the kitchen later that would be the reason. I am writing this at the table with my phone plugged in so the battery will not die. Every time I pause I think I hear a step on the porch.

I keep coming back to the voice message he sent me. The creak. The broom scrape. The small happy sound at the end. I replayed it in my head this whole evening. I think that sound was not for me. I think it was for whatever stood on the other side of the glass.

I know you are waiting for the part where I look through the curtain and tell you what I see. I am not going to look yet. I am going to fill the space with words because he said that helps. I will tell you what I will do when I cannot pretend I do not hear the step. I will pick up the phone and I will write a small story that says the field is empty and the scarecrow is just old clothes on a pole and the rope holds fast. I will write that the stitches are tight but they only hold burlap to burlap. I will write that the hat is heavy with rain and the hat keeps his face turned down. I will write until my thumbs ache and my eyes sting.

Out by the fence I can hear something stiff catching on wire. I can hear that dry brush again. I can hear the porch boards decide where to put a new creak. I am not going to look. I am going to keep the words moving.

If you are reading this and a man  asks you for a scarecrow story, do not be kind the way I was. Send help to the pin he sent me if you have the nerve. I do not know what you will find there. 

I can hear strange noises outside again. I am not going to check. I am going to keep writing while I can. I am going to give it a field full of nothing and a night sky with no eyes and a hat that never lifts.

I will stop when the noise is gone. I will stop when morning comes. I will stop when I am sure there is no shadow against the curtain. I will stop when the creak moves away.

I will stop when the straw stops touching the door.
