I never believed in ghosts.  At least, I didn’t until this spring.  My name is Alex Turner and I work long hours at an IT firm.  I live alone in a small apartment in Seattle, and when I want to relax after a long day of screens and code, I usually play music through my nice new wireless headphones. I splurged on a high-end pair of EarGenix PX-3 buds last Christmas – supposedly the best sound on the market. They’re comfortable, nearly invisible, and the battery lasts forever. No smartphone bloatware, just a simple Bluetooth connection.

One Tuesday evening around 11:30 PM, I finally wrapped up debugging some Java scripts and leaned back at my desk. The apartment was quiet except for the gentle hum of the refrigerator and the wind rattling the window frame. I slid the headphones on and settled down with a beer to watch a movie. About forty minutes in, I paused the film because something strange happened: I heard a clear, faint voice right in my ear.

“Alex…”

It sounded exactly like my girlfriend, Marisa. She had visited over the weekend and accidentally left her headphones behind. I froze. Even though I was wearing my own headphones, I could have sworn I heard Marisa whispering my name. My apartment is small; I turned my head, expecting to see her standing in the doorway with her eyes wide, grinning. But the hallway was empty. The TV was paused on a frozen frame; the hissing white noise of cinema silence filled my ears.

I shrugged, thinking maybe I’d imagined it, and resumed the movie. About five minutes later, after a scene I barely remember, I heard it again. This time more distinct, with… a hint of panic.

“Alex… I can’t… Alex, help me.”

The soft voice was panicked, trembling. It sounded exactly like Marisa – same inflection, same accent. I ripped off the headphones, heart thumping. It was completely silent. I even turned them off. Dismissing it as stress-induced auditory hallucinations, I poured the rest of my beer and tried to focus on a comedy show to calm down.

Ten minutes later, I tried the movie again. At first nothing happened, but then a whisper at the threshold of hearing:

“Alex… I hear something… Come here…”

My blood ran cold. The voice wasn’t Marisa this time – it was higher-pitched, almost childlike, but still female. I bolted upright. “Who’s there?!” I shouted, but only a dry laugh echoed back. Then silence. The headphones were back on autopilot, playing “The Rolling Waves” by Wild Coast.

My hands were shaking. I fumbled to remove the headphones. They slapped against the desk. I snapped my laptop lid shut. “Fuck this,” I muttered, standing up. I paced the kitchen, my eyes darting around the dark corners. My phone showed 11:50 PM. Maybe I was tired.

I texted Marisa: “Hey, you okay? Do you hear my name or something?”

No reply. She was away on a work trip. Late-night messages from me weren’t unusual, so I assumed she’d read it tomorrow. To ease my mind, I took out the charger and set the headphones on the table (turning them off completely). If the voices were a glitch in the headset, maybe it needed a reset.

Deciding to get some air, I unlocked the balcony door. A cold spring wind blew in. The city lights shimmered below. I inhaled deeply, closing my eyes, trying to shake off the dread. But before I could relax, a buzz from my pocket startled me. I fished out my phone. A single text message, from an unknown number:

“I found her.”

My finger hovered over the reply button. Was I being pranked? But I couldn’t recall sharing any pics of Marisa or even that the apartment was mostly dark. And who would message me at this hour? I texted back anyway:

- Who is this?

Seconds later, my phone vibrated. New message:

“I’ll show you.”

The phone then pinged with a new email alert. I opened the Gmail app: a new unread message from an unknown sender with just one attachment. I hesitated but tapped it. The image was a photo of my living room. The scene: me, asleep on the couch, earbuds still on, a half-finished beer on the coffee table. My TV and laptop screens were on – exactly as I’d left them.

I jerked awake, falling off the stool I’d been sitting on. My heart nearly leapt out of my chest.

I WAS SLEEPING?

I would never doze off wearing earphones – people talk through this door all the time, or my laptop’s wifi could disable if it thought I was idle. And even if I did, who took that photo? The room was pitch-black to the camera; yet my earbuds were glowing faintly blue.

Panic set in and I scrambled for my phone to reply. But all the messages were gone. The text thread had vanished. The email alert had disappeared too. My internet connection was still on. I refreshed the inbox – no new message, no trace of that email.

Now convinced something very wrong was happening, I grabbed the headphones and stomped to the bedroom. I stood in the dim room and calmly – or as calmly as I could manage – examined the gear. The PX-3 Buds had a small indicator light that usually glowed blue when powered on. I clicked the power button. The blue light blinked three times and went out. They were off. I even physically tugged them off and set them on the bed. There was no way they could whisper if they were off, right?

The silence in the apartment felt oppressive. I texted a friend, Malik: “Dude… super weird. Gonna crash at your place, my place feels… creepy.”

My phone buzzed instantly:

Malik: “What the hell happened?”
Me: “I’ll explain tomorrow. I think someone broke in here.”
Malik: “U sure? I mean… like, I’m up.”

I paced and caught his late reply before I could send it: “I’m 2 blocks away. You want me there?”

I hesitated. I didn’t want to draw attention. But now someone had taken my photo while I slept, and then vanished without a trace or sign of break-in. If an intruder was armed enough to open my computer and send fake messages, I’d rather not stay.

“Yeah. Bring coffee,” I texted back. Malik showed up 15 minutes later, bleary-eyed. I opened the door to see his tall frame in the hallway light. Relief washed over me.

“I’m telling you, something is messed up,” I hissed as he stepped in. I gave him the rundown: the voice, the text, the photo. Malik’s brows knitted.

“This sounds like some clown on the internet. Phishing me or something.” He dropped his overnight bag by the door. “But you said the thread disappeared?”

“Yep. And the email.”

He frowned. “Did you get my text about your building’s security cams? I set them to auto-record last night in response to the noise from your doorframe creaking. If something came in…” He pulled out his phone.

We walked back to the living room. The red LEDs of the smoke detector cast a low glow. Malik picked up where I left off: “Tell me exactly when it sent that photo. If I open the record from 11:50PM…”

I gave him times and took a seat. He fussed with his phone. A moment later: “Got it.” He tapped the screen. We both watched the live feed.

“Nothing… wait,” he said. On one camera near the couch, the feed flickered. The figure sitting on the couch was me – but I was sleeping! I had crumpled to the side on the loveseat, head lolling, clothes slightly disheveled. The camera’s timestamp showed 11:48 PM. Then, the timestamp jumped to 11:51. I was gone. But there, crouched on the floor next to the couch, was a black shadow – a shape like a person bending over me. It had no clear outline in the grainy video, only an impression of bulk, an arm descending from above me. Then the frame cut out, static. It switched cameras.

“Jesus…” Malik whispered. “I think it’s–”

I leaned forward, pointing at the screen. The timestamp was now 11:55. In the dim kitchen camera, I appeared again – I was standing by the fridge with a glass in my hand, but the figure was also there, half behind me. The shadow was tall, hunched, a towering shape with something in its hands. Then the figure stepped forward. It glimmered for a moment (I saw it: a twisted grin?) and lunged forward. I collapsed, sending glass crashing. Malik lunged at the feed, but it flickered to black.

He looked pale. “What… did I just see?”

“I… that was me in the kitchen,” I said shakily. “The figure grabbed me from behind, I think. I blacked out.”

Silence. The camera sequence was harrowing. Malik took off his glasses. “This isn’t a prank or glitch. Something real is in your apartment.”

I felt the blood drain. I bolted from the chair to shut all the cameras off (Malik protested). Cameras off, darkness enveloped us except for the TV’s standby light.

Malik edged toward me. “Do you think… it’s the headphones, or those messages?”

I glanced at the powered-off buds on the nightstand. They were definitely off, the little light not glowing. “I don’t know what it is. But it’s connected to those headphones. It can talk. It took control of my laptop to send me an email. It’s inside the tech, Alex. It’s… everywhere I have a microphone or camera.”

He nodded slowly. “Maybe an AI experiment or something gone wrong. Some hacker messing? No, too coordinated. Your Siri or Alexa doesn’t have that kind of reach.” His face twisted. “Or… or maybe the story’s true. Maybe your new headphones aren’t just Bluetooth. Maybe they’re haunted.”

I gave him a horrified stare, but he had a point: the very moment I turned them off and removed them, the voices stopped – until the photo text came. If it was an entity, maybe it used the headset as an entry.

“Stay here,” I said abruptly. “Get some sleep if you can. I’ll try to call someone – maybe the police or at least someone in IT security. But we both know how that will go; they’ll blame software.”

He shrugged and lay down on the couch with a half-empty bottle of whiskey. “Just… if it tries anything, wake me up. Alright?”

“Yeah.” I sat on the loveseat, rubbing my eyes. The apartment was quiet now. Too quiet. I almost hoped I was hallucinating – that somehow, this was stress. But I knew better.

Around 3 AM, I drifted off on the couch. The police report would read “unknown intruder” anyway, so I kept that to myself. Sleep came fitfully; dreamlike snapshots of being held down, a cold breath in my ear. I woke at dawn slumped over, pillows tangled around me.

By morning, I was exhausted. Malik was gone when I woke – I left a note about his girlfriend not answering him (I don’t have time to explain), and left a breakfast bar and a bottle of water on the table. I tidied up the glass from the kitchen, took a hot shower (audio off), and looked over the still-powerless cameras through my phone for one last check. All was silent on the feeds.

I needed to be sure this thing couldn’t follow me out. I bagged the headphones and laptop, carrying them to the trunk of my car. In the bathroom mirror, I almost dropped them: behind me, a dark shape loomed.

I whipped around. The room was empty. I could still see the vague outline reflected in the mirror. It was tall, crooked, pale mask of a face. In its hands – my phone, buzzing with a message. Whose message? I recovered enough to slap it out of its hands. My phone skidded across the tile floor, screen cracked. The mirror snapped back to normal – nothing behind me.

Panting, I grabbed my keys and fumbled for breath. That was… definitely not the girl’s voice now. This being’s voice was older, dry, like a static-laced echo from old radio tapes.

I’d already backed out onto the street. I peeled out of the parking lot, accelerated without looking back. I don’t know what that thing is, but it knows my name, my home, my stuff. It has my technology now, and maybe part of my mind.

Tonight I’m in New York, flying out first flight. I booked a last-minute business trip, making up an excuse. Malik hasn’t gotten any calls or texts back from me – he’ll just think I left town for work. I doubt anyone here has devices connected to mine.

I just found an unlocked computer in the office lounge at JFK. I’m saving this document as UnnamedPost.txt, because who would believe it otherwise? In a few hours I’ll board a flight, shoot clear to Los Angeles where the sun actually comes up. I thought this would be like “The funny glitch headphones story,” but it’s not funny.

If this is posted on /r/NoSleep, well… I’m sorry. I wish it were a prank, too. I hear a faint whisper whenever I put on these rented earbuds in the lounge; but maybe that’s paranoia. The thing followed me – maybe it can use any microphone.

Listen to me: if you use weird tech or someone’s creepy messages end up at 3:33 AM, disconnect everything right away. Don’t assume it’s a software bug. I’m boarding now. Whatever “it” is, it’s real.
