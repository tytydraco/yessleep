My whole class is not that smart.You sure know that type of class where nobody really cares about studying and where the troublemakers are found,that type of class were all the fun is created,if this type of class didn’t exist,it would be boring.

I have to say that I am actually the best student in the university,the best at math the best at everything,I was the model student but to be onest that was a pretty weak university,as I said there were a lot of troublemakers,most of the universities wouldn’t tolerate that,I guess this one is different.

At one point one of the troublemakers,that was at the same time the class clown,wasn’t at school,it wasn’t odd of course,but that day was one of the most boring days I have ever experienced even the weather wasn’t nice,foggy and rainy all day,that dat my class was pretty calm not as in most days.

The next day he returned,he wasn’t the same,he would actually stay in place,he would not speak during class,making the other day no different than the previous one.But there was something wrong about his characteristics,He would walk different,he would speak different but the most terrifying one was that the one finger he got amputated a year ago was back.
He got fixed 

The next day 4 students were absent.
The next day 4 new students were fixed
Next day 2 more students were absent
Next day 2 new students were fixed
Then I realized that there were no more students
Not even from other classes

The other days I spent were like a nightmare that I couldn’t wake up already,I tried calling my mom but nobody answered.

I don’t know who to talk to…I don’t know who is human…

With enought hope I found some students who were normal,that hope disappeared as they said that nothing was wrong.
I feel like I am being made off,like a cat’s toy,They laugh
Is this my last day until I am finally being replaced?I started getting only F’s so I can be replaced too…hopefully like the students and professors 

The Copies do not feel empathy so I tried so hard not to beg,because I would be humiliated because they would laugh,I felt horribly,I couldn’t even go to the exit so I can escape They would block me always.

Today The Copies started laughing and looked at me,They didn’t do anything.

I can’t help but laught,they heard me,that was the time.They charged..they broke anything that was in their way.I ran for my life but what was the point of running?So I hid,they found me but they didn’t do anything they let me run so they can find again and again.They are laughting,crying,singing all at the same time.

They played arround for so long my legs became sorrow I needed to crawl but I have one more hiding place I knew I had to go there,it was like a babys bed to me

I am writing this from the rest room,they are knocking aggressively,it is time…to be replaced
