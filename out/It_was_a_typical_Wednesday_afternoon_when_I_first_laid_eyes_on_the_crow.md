   

I was walking home from work, lost in thought, when I noticed a commotion on the sidewalk ahead of me. As I drew closer, I saw a group of people gathered around a crow that appeared to be injured.

I couldn't just walk by and do nothing, so I stopped to see if I could help. The large, black bird was lying on its side, struggling to move. It had a broken wing and a deep gash on its leg.

I knew I had to act fast. I called the local animal rescue and they told me to bring the crow to their facility as soon as possible. I gently picked up the crow and cradled it in my arms, trying my best to keep it calm and comfortable.

But as I held the crow, I began to feel a strange presence emanating from it. It was as if the bird was communicating with me, speaking to me in a way that I couldn't understand. I shook off the feeling and attributed it to my own anxiety.

The first part of the trip to the animal rescue was a blur. I was focused on getting the crow the help it needed, and I barely noticed the curious looks and whispered comments of the people we passed on the street. 

Soon, though, everyone began laughing at me—pointing and laughing derisively as I hurried by, like I was some sort of fool for rescuing a crow. A small kid stuck me in the knee with the pointed end of an ice cream cone. His double dip of chocolate fell to the sidewalk. 

The crow, though grievously wounded, struggled against me. I sensed it was hungry and wanted a piece of the shattered cone. I pulled the bird closer to my chest. I could not allow the crow’s survival instinct to interfere with my attempt to save it, as contradictory as that may sound. 

When we arrived at the animal rescue, the crow was examined by a veterinarian and given the necessary medical treatment. As the days went on, the crow's injuries seemed to heal at an unnaturally fast rate. Its broken wing mended itself and the gash on its leg vanished.

I visited the crow every day, bringing it food and spending time with it as it recovered. But each time I saw the crow, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It seemed to be watching me with an almost human-like intelligence, its unblinking eyes following my every move.

As the crow's wing healed and it became stronger, I knew it was time for it to return to the wild. But I was terrified to let it go. I had a feeling that the crow was not what it seemed, and that if I released it, it would come back for me.

I couldn't shake the feeling that the crow was trying to tell me something, to warn me of some dark fate that awaited me. I knew that I had to face my fear and let the crow go, but as I watched it fly off into the sky, I couldn't help but feel that I was making a terrible mistake.

And as the days went on, I couldn't overcome the sense I was being watched. Every time I turned around, I half-expected to see the crow waiting for me. Perched on a branch. A fence. Angling its glossy head to get a better look.

I began having strange dreams, dreams in which the crow appeared, speaking to me in a language that I couldn't understand.

I tried to ignore the dreams and focus on my work, but they only seemed to grow more intense. And then, one night, the crow appeared in my bedroom. I woke up to find it perched on the foot of my bed, its beady eyes fixed on me. I tried to move, but I was frozen with fear. The crow seemed to be trying to tell me something, its beak moving up and down as if it was trying to speak.

I knew I had to get away from the crow, no matter what it took. I gathered all of my strength and managed to break free from the paralysis that had seized my body. 

Wearing only thin cotton pajamas, I stumbled out of bed and made a run for the door, my heart pounding in my chest. I could hear the crow's wings flapping behind me as I raced down the hallway, my eyes fixed on the front door.

I didn't dare look back, I just kept running. I burst through the door and out into the night, my bare feet pounding against the pavement as I ran for my life.

I didn't stop until I had put several painful miles between me and the crow. The soles of my feet were cut and bleeding. I collapsed on the ground, my chest heaving as I tried to catch my breath.

I knew I couldn't stay there, I had to keep moving. I forced myself to get up and keep running, my mind racing as I tried to figure out what to do.

I knew I had to find help, but who could I turn to? Who would believe my story about the crow that had tried to kill me? My pajamas were sweat-soaked, the knees and elbows torn away to reveal a gritty latticework of cuts and abrasions. My hands were pockmarked with grit and blood. I was hardly the picture of a man whose word could be trusted. 

I kept running/limping, not knowing where I was going or what I would do when I got there. All I knew was that I had to get as far away from the crow as possible.

As the sun began to rise, I finally collapsed in a heap, my energy completely spent. I lay there, my body trembling, as I waited for the crow to find me and finish the job.

But it never came. The crow was gone, and I was left alone, wondering what had just happened and if I would ever be safe again. 

I needed time to think. To process what was happening. I was in the countryside now, on the shoulder of a gravel road, exposed to any farmer who drove by. I couldn’t allow myself to be discovered in such a pitiable state. 

I rolled into a drainage ditch, and, drawing on the last of my strength, crawled into the yard-high concrete pipe that connected the ditch to the other side of the road. Its dark, damp confines smelled of ancient manure and decades of discarded beers. A desiccated rodent of some sort, a bald tire and assorted fast food containers completed the scene.  

I sobbed with relief. I was now where no one—crow or human—could easily find me. 

Feeling curiously at home, I lapped brackish water from a puddle at the bottom of the pipe. My eyes adjusted to the light. I spied the remnants of a weeks-old Big Mac. I ate it greedily, topping that off with a relish packet I chewed on and spit out.  Thirst quenched, belly full, I fell into an inexplicably sound sleep.

I’ve been here for who knows how long now, each day spent waiting for the Styrofoam thunk of a tossed away fast food box or the squeal of fresh road kill. 

I then hop out of the pipe and consume what’s left, tearing at it with my teeth, my fingernails before the other scavengers can move in. 

Crow, human, or a little of both.
