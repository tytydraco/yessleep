I’m not sure what woke me up. Maybe it was the sun beating down on me, or some spider crawling across my cheek – spindly legs jittering, touch both unwelcome and unwanted. I opened my eyes, blinking into late morning. The steps swam in my vision – our steps, the same ones June Howard posed on for her photo.

Our front porch.

I’d slept through the night out there.

I didn’t remember leaving the driveway, but I must have. Somehow being closer to the house felt wrong, like I’d been dragged there in my sleep, pulled against my will toward the dark. Left there by some unseen hand.

I remembered staring at the street last night, watching headlights come and go. Hoping each pair belonged to Jess and Win. Hoping and hoping… then nothing. And now this: waking up on the porch like something had picked me up and set me down again, forgotten.

I rubbed my hand over my face. Prickling pain. Sunburn. My back ached from sleeping against the door. Dirt streaked my jeans from the dusty stone.

I’d been dreaming. I couldn’t hold onto the shape of it, only the feeling—like I’d forgotten how to breathe. Everything was dark, too dark, and my lips wouldn’t part. They weren’t made to. In the dream I wanted to scream, to call out for Jess, for Win, for anyone. But I knew that to scream I’d have to split myself open, tear my mouth apart. And I knew something worse, too: even if I did, even if I ripped myself wide, there’d be nothing inside me to come out. Just silence. Just empty.

I was still caught half-way in the dream when I heard it: tires crunching gravel, a car door shutting. A voice, low but unmistakable.

Jess.

I craned over the hedge. Our car was in the drive. Jess bent into the backseat, reaching for Win. My heart jolted hard. My legs were stiff, my back screaming, but I forced myself upright – fast, like I’d been caught doing something wrong.

The porch light buzzed overhead, whispering. My mouth was dry and tacky. My pulse skittered as I lunged for the front door, fumbling the handle, nearly tripping over my own shoes. I stumbled halfway inside, caught myself on the knob, praying she wouldn’t think I was drunk—passed out like some stray dog left outside overnight.

But I was too late. They were already making their way up the walkway to the front door, and I was there, caught out in the open. On stage, a soiled puppet of the night before.

“Jess,” I croaked. My throat was raw, baked by the sun.

She looked up, catching a glimpse of me. She froze, startled, seeing me there on the porch. And only then did I realize what I must have looked like through her eyes – sunburnt, clothes rumpled, hair matted with sweat, filth from the porch clinging to me.

Her arms tightened around Win. She went rigid.

“Robert,” she said, steady but clipped. “I wasn’t expecting you to be out here.”

“I –” my voice cracked. “I waited for you. I stayed out here all night, watching for you to come back. I thought…”

Win stirred against her shoulder. Jess kissed her temple, turning so Win couldn’t crane her head to look at me. Then she met my eyes again. She wasn’t angry – not the way I thought she’d be. Her gaze was measured, arms protective, locked around our daughter.

“Don’t wake her,” she whispered.

I stepped down one stair. My legs shook beneath me. “Please. Just come inside. Both of you. Come home.” I reached my arms out, my hands shaking, beckoning to them both.

Jess shook her head, gently at first. “No. Not right now. Not like this.”

Her eyes flicked over me, really taking me in. And I saw the decision before she said a word – saw it in the way she held Win, in her refusal to take one step closer to the house, to me.

“I’m not bringing her inside. Not right now. I want you to go back in, Rob.”

The words knocked the air out of me.

“Jess –”

“Go back inside. Sit on the couch. Get yourself something to eat, something to drink.”

“Please, Jess, just –“

She talked over me, pulling Win closer to her. “I’m going to come back, okay? I’m taking Win to my mom’s, again,” she sighed, “and then I’ll come back here. By myself.”

“But—”

“I can’t have her here. Not when you’re like this, okay? Do you understand?”

It felt like a hand was closing around my chest. I looked around, wandering for a brief self-conscious second if any of our neighbors were seeing this. I lowered my voice. “You don’t feel safe with me? Jess, it’s me. I’ve just been here. I’ve been waiting.”

Her jaw trembled, but her voice stayed steady. “Rob, I don’t feel safe for her. I don’t want her to see you like this. We can’t…”

She broke off as Win stirred in her arms. Jess hugged her tighter, shushing, rocking. Then she looked back at me, imploring, eyes wide and glassy.

“Please, Rob,” she said. “Just go back inside. You can call me. Text me. I’ll let you know when I’m on my way back. I’ll go as fast as I can. I just… we have to.”

I nodded. Despite it all, I understood. I hated that I did. I hated that this was where we were.

“Okay,” I said. Hoarse. “Okay.”

Jess turned. The car door opened and shut. The engine caught. Gravel shifted.

And just like that, she was gone, down the road. Again.

I stood barefoot on the porch, my hand pressed to the wood of the door behind me, holding myself upright. The dream had left me, and the bare reality – in the glare of the sun, in the silence – shook me harder than anything in the house could.

Behind me, the house waited. I was aware of the door looming closed – the threshold of my nightmare. For a moment I thought I’d wait out there again, I’d wait for them outside where nothing could fuck with my head – no seam, no toybox, no toys. Just me and the day; I’d watch it shift around me, I’d watch the sun rise and set and fall and then soon after Jess would be home with me again and we could just…

But I knew standing out here would just make me look worse. I wanted to be right, I wanted to be okay enough for my family to let me in again. So, despite what I knew lurked in the house?

I went back in.

**

I didn’t know what to do with myself once the door shut.


The house felt larger without my girls, and emptier – but not the quiet kind of empty, not the calm that settles when peace is rich. The walls leaned close. The air thickened, pressing in on me, waiting for me to move. I couldn’t sit. I couldn’t stay in one room.

So I walked. From the living room to the kitchen, to the hallway, to the stairs. Each pass the same, each corner slower, as though the house was keeping time with me. My eyes snagged on every dark patch where the light didn’t quite reach. My body was exhausted, but my mind was rabid. Every shadow felt like it had been placed there on purpose, leaning toward me. I snapped my gaze over them in turns, one after another, in circles over and over.

I could almost feel the seam upstairs just as I could picture it. I couldn’t get it out of my head, and it pulsed in my memory and at the front of my thoughts like a second, secret heartbeat. The toybox, too. I told myself I wouldn’t go up there, that I’d just…wait, but the pull was constant. I felt like I could hear it: the sound of it – wood flexing, groaning like a beam under too much weight – threaded faintly through the silence. A voice that wasn’t a voice.

I thought of Milkshake. The lump doll. The basket in the garage where I’d locked them away. The thought came sudden and hot:

I should burn them. Should’ve done it already. Before it was too late.

I stumbled through the kitchen, out the back door, to the garage. I yanked the chain to flick the light on. The laundry basket sat in the half-gloom against the wall where I’d left it.

Empty.

I felt the room shrink around me with the sudden shock. I dropped to my knees, pawing through the corner like they might have just spilled out. Nothing. Just a smear of dust.

But then again, was it all that shocking? Was it all so strange that the toys wouldn’t be there?

I staggered back into the house. My pulse roared in my ears. They had to be here. I had put them here. I had put them here. I had to have, I had to have, I had to have.

I started searching. Room to room. Closet by closet.


The coat closet first, tossing aside old boots, the vacuum. Letting the picture we found of the two girls – Candace and Marie – fall to the floor between piles of unhooked coats. I searched under the couch, shoving my head into the shadows until my throat caught from the dust. I tore through Win’s dresser drawers. I got down on my hands and knees, pressing my cheek to the carpet to look beneath her bed.

More than once, I thought I saw something – a bit of thread trailing under the doorframe. A gleam like a button eye. A corner of fabric just beyond reach. I lunged after them, but when I pulled the door wide or flicked the light on, there was nothing.

The house was playing with me. It was hiding them. It had to be.

I looked in the same places again, feeling more and more like I was going to catch one. Like I was going to find they were shuffling hiding spaces – a silent, miniature game of musical chairs. The closets, our bedroom, Win’s room, under the couches and then…again. The closets, our bedroom, Win’s room, under the couches. The nook. The nook. The nook.

I was panting by the time I pulled down the attic stairs, sweat slicking my back. I dug through every box I’d shoved up there –candles, winter coats, old holiday decorations. I ripped them open one by one, hurling their contents onto the insulation. The mess grew around me until the attic looked like a rat’s nest, a trash heap for scattered memories.

Ignoring the seam. Ignoring the Lonely Way the whole time. Not looking, no, not looking. No matter how it whispered I did not look.

Still nothing.

I wandered back downstairs, to the living room, not sure what to do with myself. I sat back on my heels in the center of the floor, my chest heaving, the dust burning my lungs. The silence pressed in, heavy. I realized what I must look like – crawling through the wreckage of my own house, tearing it apart for ghosts.

I whispered to the dark, hoarse:


“Where are you.”

No answer. Just the groan of the house, deep and low, like it was biting back laughter.

I pressed my palms into my eyes, hard enough to make sparks bloom in the dark. When I opened them again, I was staring across the living room floor – and there it was.

The doll.

The one with the blue eyes. The one I had tossed away, that I couldn’t find when I had gathered up Milkshake and the lumpy girl. It was here now, almost exactly where I’d thought I’d left it after wrenching it from Win’s arms that night. Half-hidden under the feet of the couch, half-exposed, its button eyes catching the faintest glimmer of light from my phone as I switched on its light. Watching me. Waiting.

I crawled toward it, my breath shaking, the weight of dust settling into my lungs. I reached out and pulled her free. Heavier than it should’ve been. Cold as always. The blue eyes stared flat into mine, tiny sapphires stitched into felt. I thought I saw myself reflected there, bent and warped.

A tremor ran through me.

I knew what I had to do.

I carried it through the kitchen, out the back door. My hands gripped it tight, so tight the tips of my fingers began to ache pushing into that strange rugged thread. Behind the shed, I piled sticks, newspaper scraps, anything dry enough to catch. I found the pack of water-proof matches on a shelf in the shed and took them to the pile of catch, striking until one flared.

The flame caught, spread, licked up the wood. I held the doll over it. For a moment I froze -- I thought I felt its little limbs flex against my hands, a strange warmth that was alien to the toy seep into its body even as I held it away from the fire. Then I dropped it.

The flames took quickly – cloth darkening, curling, collapsing inward. I stared down, transfixed, my face burning in the heat as I stood above the makeshift pyre.

At first, there was nothing but the crackle of fabric. But then there was a hiss. A high whistling, like water boiling off wood. I almost laughed at the sound, told myself it was just steam, just damp heating.

But then it climbed. Sharpened. A shrill note, piercing the air, rising past what was natural. The whistle broke open into something jagged, something too close to a cry. A memory came back to me, sudden and sharp: driving my first car home on a country road, never seeing the rabbit that jumped out of the brush until my tire crushed the back of it into the pavement, crushing its legs. The sound it had made…it was too close to this, too much like hurt, like horrible, overwhelming pain.

My stomach dropped. I stumbled back, hands to my ears. My pulse throbbed in my teeth. The sound didn’t stop – it keened and shrieked, a high, awful wail folded into the burning.

“No way,” I muttered, staggering, “no no way. It’s nothing. It’s just wet.”

The sound went on until the last scrap blackened, until there was nothing left but a brittle mound of ash. The air stank of scorched fabric, acrid and sweet, like sugar gone bad. Heady mildew and smoke.

I stared into the embers until they went dark. My throat worked, but no sound came out. My hands were shaking, raw from where I’d gripped the doll.

It was gone. And the quiet after the screaming of the thing was worse.

I went back inside with the stink of smoke in my hair and the taste of ash in my mouth. For a second, I told myself I’d done it – I’d fought back, I’d taken one from the house, from whatever it was. I’d protected us. But the feeling never settled. It curdled. My chest felt scraped hollow, my stomach turning like I’d swallowed the ash myself. Each step deeper into the house was heavier, sicker, until I couldn’t tell if I’d won something or…

Or what? It was just a toy. It had just been a toy.

I drifted up the stairs on heavy legs, the house pressing in closer with every step, whispering from its seams. At the top, I lingered in the hall, staring at the half-open door to our bedroom. The bed inside looked too big without Jess, without Win curled in the middle like an anchor. I went in anyway, because I couldn’t bear the emptiness of the hall. The room still smelled like her: lotion, her coconut shampoo, the perfume I’d bought her on our honeymoon in Madrid – the same bottle I got her every year again for Christmas. I missed her so much I could feel it in my ribs, a constricting ache. I lay down on my side of the bed, pressed my face into the hollow of her pillow, and let the weight of it all drown me – the doll’s smoke still in my throat, the toybox humming low in my bones, the sucking absence of my loves. My eyes slid shut before I could reckon with any of it, and the house moved in around me as I began to go away.

**

I was in the upstairs hallway, drifting towards Win’s room. The wood bent under my weight, not creaking but bowing – pliant, like flesh. I wasn’t walking so much as being carried. Pulled.

Then – no door, no turn of the knob – I was inside.

It was Win’s room, only in appearance. The air pressed down, heavy, the furniture fixed in place like bones set in mortar. The stillness was absolute. Even the dust hung motionless, waiting. My breath caught in my throat. I tried breathing again, but my lips barely parted. It felt like they’d been sewn shut in my sleep.

At in the back, the nook gaped wider than it should have. The toybox leaned against the wall, lid hinging so far back it seemed it might snap. Its mouth was open wide, waiting.

Inviting.

I wanted to turn and flee. Wanted to run down the stairs, out the front door, and down the road, screaming until my voice shredded my throat raw. But the thought of opening my mouth, of splitting my lips to let the scream out, brought another thought with it: that nothing would come. No sound. Just emptiness.

I stepped closer. My shins pressed to the rim. The dark inside wasn’t shadow – it had weight, a palpable viscosity, a surface tension that almost reflected me. Almost. The longer I looked the more I swore I saw myself in there, but reduced. A face pale and smooth where features should be.

My leg lifted. And, without really willing it, I stepped in.

The surface yielded around my thigh, colder than water, softer than cloth.

Another step, the dark sucked at my waist.

Another, and I was up to my chest.

I held my breath, terrified of what would happen if I opened it. Like diving into the deep end. Like my lungs might never rise again.

It’s for you.

The voice was everywhere. Echoing, close enough I felt it inside my chest, vibrating against the ribs.

I blinked.

Win’s room and the toybox were gone. Instead, I stood in a hallway.

The walls were made of warped planks, the same unfinished wood from the back of Win’s closet, but stretched too long, grain pulled taut like skin. Names had been scratched into them – June, Candace, Marie – but the letters were split apart, warped, the letters crusted with something dark and wet, like the names were healing, like they were scars scratched open too many times. Doors lined the passage, discolored, splintered. Each lined with puckering seams.

The hallway stretched ahead forever, lit not by any lamp but by a sickly glow leaking from the wood itself – pale and faint, an uncanny illumination. At the farthest point, the shadows thickened until they became solid.

Waiting.

The farther I walked, the less it felt like walking. My legs moved, but I couldn’t feel my feet striking the floor. The boards rose to meet me, flexing under my steps, giving like a mattress, or muscle. The wood groaned low and wet, the sound of tendons stretching.

The first door was warped, its bottom edge sunken into the floor as if the hall had swallowed part of it. I reached for the knob without thinking. My hand hovered an inch away before the mottled brass pulsed – warm. A shiver ran up my wrist. I jerked back. The metal had left a print on my palm. A circle like a brand.

I kept going.

The walls leaned closer the deeper I went, bowing inwards until the corridor was no wider than my shoulders. I felt the walls brush me as I passed – the wood breathed. In. Out. The air filled with the smell of wet cloth left too long in a basement.

Something flickered at the edge of my vision. A toy, maybe – a doll – hung crooked on a nail in the wall. Its face was sealed over with black stitching, thick knots pulling the fabric shut where eyes and mouth should have been. I stopped, staring. The thread shivered once, a subtle tug, as though something on the other side had plucked it.

Then it jerked. Hard. The half-formed doll snapped upward, vanishing into the dark above. The motion was too fast, too clean – like a suture being reeled through flesh. I craned back, heart hammering, but there was no ceiling for it to hit. Only a vast, rippling dark that swam like water overhead.

I forced myself to keep walking.

My hand scraped the wall to steady myself. When I pulled it away, there were splinters in my skin. But not wood. Thin black filaments. Thread. They wriggled, trying to knot themselves deeper. I shook my hands, trying to beat them off. They fell away without a sound.

Another door. This one rattled on its hinges as I passed, shivering like something inside was clawing to get out. A faint sound leaked through – a whimper, thin and muffled, like a child crying into a pillow just inches from your ear. I froze, breath locked in my throat. But the moment I pressed my ear to the wood, the sound was gone.

The hall narrowed further. My chest scraped the boards on one side, my spine pressed to the other. I felt the grain biting through my shirt, scratching against my skin. Thin needling splinters.

The glow grew dimmer. The air colder. The silence heavier.

And still ahead, the dark. Not absence but presence. A fullness.

Something waiting.

The walls closed until I was nearly crawling, scraping my shoulders raw against their seams. Each inch forward cost me a little more breath, the air thinner now, harder to draw in. The glow faded until there was only a pallid shimmer leaking from the cracks between the boards.

Then the hall ended.

Not with a wall. Not with a door. With an opening.

It wasn’t shaped right. It wasn’t square or round or anything that belonged in a house. It was an absence in the wood, a tear in the fabric of the hall itself. The edges were frayed and splintered, and as I drew closer they pulsed with that same faint pale light. Like the glow was seeping out.

I couldn’t see inside at first. It wasn’t black – it was something else, a color my eyes couldn’t name. My throat went dry. The longer I stared, the more the opening seemed to lean forward. Like it was hungry.

Something brushed my ankle. A thread, slack and soft. I looked down and saw them spilling from the threshold – dozens, hundreds of black threads, pulsing across the floor like veins. They moved without sound, without purpose, except to creep closer. One looped around my shoe, loose but deliberate. Another brushed my wrist. I slapped at it, heart racing, but when I tried to pull free the threads clung tighter, flexing like worming muscle.

From inside the tear, something shifted. The glow swelled.

I saw arms or legs – I couldn’t be certain – or maybe just lengths of cloth, great crimson curtains shimmering wet in the sickening light. I saw glistening buttons purple like wounds gone to rot. I saw seams splitting open, mouths yawning wider and wider, tearing and gnashing and screaming, gushing forth filthy thread slick and black and festered with filth.

It was not one being. It was thousands. A mass of mouths and limbs, shrieking and weeping, collapsing into one another and then splitting apart again. A pit of bodies falling forever into a sheaf of brightness too foul to be holy, too searing to be earthly. They screamed, but the screams blended until they became something else – a fabric, woven out of agony.

And it knew me. It knew I was there.

The threads at my wrists tightened, tugged. My breath hitched. I tried to scream, but my lips were sealed, stitched from within.

The light surged. The shapes writhed closer, folding and unfolding, maddening and shuddering and rippling. I understood then, dimly, in the vanishing part of me that could still think: if I leaned into that opening, if I let myself be pulled in, I would become part of it. A voice among the thousands. A seam. A button. A mouth.

But my mind revolted. I pushed the terror onto the wrong shape, shoved it into the face of my daughter. The words in my skull spun like a desperate litany: It’s for her. It’s for Win. It’s coming for Win.

The threads jerked. My chest seized. The glow grew until it felt like the whole hall was about to dissolve in its brilliance.

**

I woke with my cheek stuck to something damp. For a moment I thought it was sweat again, or drool, or both. I lifted my face, whatever was on my face feeling like glue. I rose slowly, wincing at the sharp prickling pain from my cheek as I carefully tore myself free.

My eyes fluttered open to dim light. The couch. The living room couch. I was lying sprawled across it, my body twisted half-off the cushions. My jaw ached. My lips burned, stiff and raw.

How had I gotten down there?

“Rob?”

I jerked upright, groggy. Jess was in the doorway, frozen, Win nowhere in sight. Her face was pale, her eyes wide.

“Oh my god,” she whispered.

She was staring at my face, her hand moving to her mouth. Confused, I raised a hand to my own face, wincing as my fingers brushed my lips. I probed my mouth…and felt it. Thread. Stiff, knotted.

Pulled tight through my lips.

The horror struck me all at once. I clawed at it with shaking fingers, tugging.

“Mmm.mmm,” I moaned, eyes tearing as I tried to open my mouth. Pain exploded through my face as the stitches snapped, tearing flesh. My blood felt hot as it spilled down my chin, seeping into the front of my shirt.

“Jesus Christ, Rob!” Jess lurched forward – then stopped, frozen. Her arms jerked like she might reach, but she held them tight against her chest instead. Her body was stiff, trembling, caught between saving me and running from me.

I clawed the stitches apart, blood bubbling down my chin. My breath rattled. “Jess…”

Her eyes were wide, wet. “Don’t talk — stop talking. You’re bleeding.” Her voice broke, panic pressed flat. “What did you do? What did you do?”

I gagged. Spat red. “Why…didn’t you come home?”

Jess blinked hard. “Rob, I did. I texted you. I told you I was coming as soon as I could.” Her hand shook as she pulled out her phone. “Look.”

She scrolled. The screen lit her face pale blue. She froze. Her lips parted.

“What?” My mouth ripped wider with each word, flesh tearing. “What is it?”

She turned the screen toward me, her thumb trembling. Lines. Broken stanzas. The manic poetry, all sent from me.

THREAD THROUGH ME
SEAMED SHUSH
ARMS ARE SOFTER
I CAN BE FOLDED NOW
I CAN BE HELD BABE

Jess’s breath hitched as she scrolled. Her voice was hoarse. “You sent me this, Rob. Over and over. All night.”

I pressed my hand to my torn mouth, blood hot between my fingers. I tried to speak, to explain, but the words came out shards. “Not me. It’s the house. Please – you have to see. Please. It’s in the attic. It’s, it was hidden. It was lonely but it’s not hidden anymore.”

Jess clutched Win’s new bear to her chest, the stuffed head tight under her chin. Her knuckles were white against the fabric. She didn’t come closer. She didn’t leave either.

Her voice dropped, steady but thin as glass: “If I go with you. If I look. You’ll let me call someone? You’ll let me get you help?”

Her eyes burned into me, demanding an answer.

I nodded fast. Too fast. “Yes. Just come.”

Jess pressed her lips together, her breath shaking out of her. She stood, arms crossed tight across her chest, as if to hold herself together. “Okay,” she said finally, her voice so quiet I almost didn’t hear.

I rose, my body swaying, every movement ragged. The house seemed to shiver with us, like it knew we were coming. Like it was waiting.

And together, without touching, we went upstairs.

**

The stairs to the attic groaned under my weight, the loose blood from my ripped lips dripping onto the wood. Jess lingered at the bottom, her arms at her sides, her hands ready, her face pale. She looked like she might bolt, but when I turned and whispered, “Please,” she followed.

We climbed into the thick heat together. Dust hung in the air like a stale, kept breath. Jess’s hand brushed a beam once for balance, but otherwise she stayed a careful step behind me, watching.

“Rob,” she said softly, “this isn’t safe. It’s filthy up here. You’re –”

“Just look,” I cut in. My voice cracked, lips raw and glistening. I pointed toward the far wall, where the boards didn’t match. Where the house had a gash. My heart hammered in my ears. “It’s there. Do you see it?”

Jess stayed where she was, her shadow stretching long in the dim bulb light. Her eyes fixed on the wall. She didn’t blink. Instead, she stood very still. Breathing in short, hard hitches.

“Rob…” she whispered.

I walked across the makeshift walkway, feeling off balance on the planks. Jess followed, just a few steps behind me, letting me take another before she followed. I stopped before the seam and dropped to my knees, pulling at the rotten wood, the black tear already slick against my fingers. “Here. Touch it. You’ll feel it. Just come closer.”

Jess stood beside me, coming to stand close. Close enough to touch.

I reached for her hand before I knew I was moving. She flinched but didn’t pull away fast enough, and suddenly my fingers were wrapped around hers, guiding her forward. Her skin was hot against mine, and I could feel her heartbeat kick under my grip – flushed and full of adrenaline. I pressed her hand toward the seam. Inches away. All she had to do was lean in.

Jess’s breath hitched, sharp. “Rob – stop.”

Her voice wasn’t angry. It was scared. For me, maybe. For herself.

I froze, realizing what I’d done, how close I’d dragged her. I let go at once, my hand falling useless to my side.

Jess stared at me, then back at the wall. Her expression was unreadable – fixed, taut. She was looking right at it, at the black seam yawning in the boards, but her lips stayed closed. No affirmation. No denial.

And her silence was worse than any answer.

I sat back on my heels, trembling. My throat worked around words that wouldn’t come. I wanted her to see, to admit it. To be with me in this. But her face was a mask, glassy with tears she wouldn’t let fall.

“Jess,” I whispered, raw, “please.”

Jess pulled her hand back from the wall, shaking. She turned to me, her eyes wet, her grip closing hard on my arm.

“Rob,” she whispered, then firmer: “We’re done. You need help. We’re leaving this house, right now. I’m taking you to the hospital.”

Her urgency cut through the stale air of the attic. I nodded, too quickly, desperate to calm her.


“Okay,” I said, voice ragged. “Yeah. You’re right. I’ll come. Just… just give me a second.”

She didn’t let go of my arm. She pulled me toward the stairs. I followed, step by step, her hand on me like I was already slipping away. Her voice turned gentle, coaxing, as if she could guide me down with words alone.


“We’ll go now. We’ll get in the car. It’s going to be okay. I’m right here. I’m right here.”

For a moment I couldn’t believe it. After everything – dragging her up there, showing her the seam in the wall, standing her right in front of it, leading her to touch it – all she had for me now was this: concern, pity, the gentle press of her hand at my back urging me toward the door. Not a word about what she saw. Not a flicker of recognition, or fear, or even denial. Just… nothing. As if it wasn’t there at all. As if I wasn’t there at all. Some part of me wanted to shake her, to scream in her face until she admitted it. But another part – the only part of me that still felt steady – told me to hold on. To keep moving. To stay with her, no matter how wrong it felt.

Until we got downstairs, at least.

We reached the bottom, moving through the house together. The walls seemed to lean closer, watching. My feet dragged against the floorboards, each step heavier, but she kept me moving, whispering all the while:


“Come on, Rob. Twenty minutes. We’ll be there in twenty minutes. They’ll help you. They’ll help us.”

At the door she fumbled with her keys, turning back to me with a pleading look. “Please. Let’s go.”

I nodded, letting her step outside. She was already half-way down the stairs. I stepped forward –

And slammed the front door shut. The lock clicked under my hand.

“ROBERT!” Jess’s voice cracked against the wood. She pounded her fists, each blow shaking through me. “OPEN THIS DOOR! OPEN IT RIGHT NOW!”

Her voice broke into sobs, then fury, then begging.

“Please, Rob – don’t do this, don’t leave me, let me help you!”

I’m calling the cops Rob, I’m calling them if you don’t open this door right now!”

I leaned against the other side, shaking, the frame cold against my forehead. For a moment I almost unlocked it, almost let her drag me into the car and out of this place. But the truth pressed against me, heavier than her fists.

It was never her. It was never Win. It was me, this was my lonely way.

I walked back upstairs, my hands at my sides, the walls pressing closer, the floor carrying me whether I wanted it to or not.

“ROBERT!” Jess’s voice cracked from the front door, reverberating from downstairs. “PLEASE—STOP!”

I didn’t look back. Couldn’t. Her words frayed into sobs, muffled by the walls, then flared up again, ragged and raw, growing fainter and fainter as I walked towards our bedroom, towards the closet and the way to the attic. “Come back to me! Please, please come back!”

 

**

I don’t know how to explain it, sweetheart.

I’ve been writing this all down because one day, when you’re older, you’ll need to understand. I’ve been sharing this with you, hoping you read it. Maybe you’ll come back here with your mom and find all these pages I’ve printed out. Maybe you’ll see this online someday. Maybe you’ll wonder why your dad wasn’t enough.

It’s the house. It’s always been the house.

I fought as long as I could, but the pull is too strong. I know what waits for me in the dark now, and I know what I have to do. I’m sorry I couldn’t protect you better. I’m sorry I couldn’t be more.

I hope you got rid of those toys, Win. I hope you threw them away. Don’t take anything from that house with you. Leave it to the dark.

I wish I could be with you now. I wish I could arrange your toys for you to wake up to. I wish I was holding you.

I hope when you read this, you’ll know that none of it was your fault. You were my light. You were the one thing that kept me tethered.

But I can’t ignore it anymore.

I’m going into the seam, into that lonely way. If I don’t come back, remember this: stay away from the attic. Stay away from the box.

I love you so, so much baby.

Don’t follow me.

—Dad
