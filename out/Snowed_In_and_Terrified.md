I've always loved winter retreats. There's something about the crisp mountain air and the serenity of a snow-covered landscape that clears the mind. That's why, when my friends and I planned a week-long getaway at a remote cabin in the mountains, I was all in. It was supposed to be the perfect escape from our hectic city lives.

There were four of us: me (Ryan), Chris, Dan, and Matt. We've been friends since college, and despite our busy schedules, we made it a point to reconnect every year. This time, Chris had found a cabin that was "off the grid," nestled deep within a forest, miles away from the nearest town.

We arrived on a Sunday afternoon, our SUV packed with supplies. The cabin was rustic but comfortable, with a large stone fireplace and a panoramic view of the surrounding wilderness. The first two days were everything we'd hoped for—hiking, cooking hearty meals, and endless rounds of poker.

On the third day, the weather took an unexpected turn. Dark clouds gathered ominously, and by late afternoon, snow began to fall. Lightly at first, but then heavier, until thick flakes were swirling all around us.

"Wasn't expecting this," Dan remarked, peering out the window.

"Weather report said clear skies all week," Chris added, a hint of worry in his voice.

"Relax, guys," Matt said, always the optimist. "We've got enough food and firewood to last us. It's just a bit of snow."

By nightfall, "a bit of snow" had turned into a full-blown blizzard. The wind howled, rattling the windows and causing the cabin to creak. We huddled around the fireplace, the warm glow offering some comfort against the storm outside.

"Think we should check in with someone? Let them know we're up here?" I suggested.

"No signal," Chris said, holding up his phone. "We're completely cut off."

"Well, looks like we're stuck here for a while," Dan sighed.

We tried to make the best of it, sharing stories and sipping on whiskey. But there was an undercurrent of unease that none of us wanted to acknowledge.

Around midnight, just as we were considering turning in, there was a sudden thud against the side of the cabin.

"What was that?" Matt asked, sitting up straight.

"Probably a branch falling," Chris said, though he didn't sound convinced.

Another thud, this time louder and accompanied by a scraping sound.

"Doesn't sound like a branch," I muttered.

We fell silent, listening intently. Through the wail of the wind, we thought we heard faint... footsteps?

"Is someone out there?" Dan whispered.

"Impossible," Chris replied. "We're miles from anywhere, and no one in their right mind would be out in this storm."

"Maybe we should check," Matt suggested.

"Check what? Open the door to a blizzard?" I said. "If someone's out there, they can come to the door."

As if on cue, there was a knock—three slow, deliberate raps on the front door.

We all exchanged uneasy glances.

"You've got to be kidding me," Dan said.

"Who's gonna answer that?" Matt asked.

Before anyone could decide, I stood up. "I'll do it."

I approached the door cautiously. "Hello?" I called out.

No response.

"Whoever's out there, do you need help?"

Still nothing.

I reached for the doorknob, hesitating. "Guys, maybe we should all—"

Before I could finish, the knocking resumed, more insistent this time.

"Just open it," Chris urged. "They might be in trouble."

I took a deep breath and pulled the door open a crack. A blast of icy wind and snow hit me, making me squint.

There was no one there.

I opened the door wider, stepping onto the porch. The snow was falling so heavily that visibility was almost zero.

"See anything?" Matt called from inside.

"Nothing," I replied, shouting over the wind.

"Close the door!" Dan yelled. "You're letting the cold in!"

I stepped back inside and shut the door, bolting it securely.

"Maybe it was just the wind," Chris suggested.

"Wind doesn't knock," I retorted.

We tried to shrug it off, but the atmosphere had shifted. An uneasy silence settled over us as we returned to our spots by the fire.

About an hour later, just as we were starting to relax, the footsteps returned—this time on the roof.

"Okay, did everyone hear that?" Dan asked, his eyes wide.

"Sounds like someone's walking up there," Matt said.

"That's impossible," Chris insisted. "The roof's too steep, and it's covered in snow."

The footsteps moved slowly across the ceiling, directly above us. Then they stopped.

"Maybe it's an animal," I offered, though I didn't believe it myself.

We sat in tense silence, waiting. Then, from the chimney, came a soft scratching sound, like nails on metal.

"Is it trying to come down the chimney?" Matt whispered.

"That's it," Dan said, standing up abruptly. "We need to figure out what's going on."

"Agreed," I said. "Let's check the attic."

We grabbed flashlights and headed up the narrow staircase to the attic hatch. The scratching continued, intermittent but persistent.

Chris pushed the hatch open, and we shone our lights into the dusty space.

"See anything?" Dan asked.

"Nothing," Chris replied. "But the sound is louder up here."

We climbed into the attic, the beams creaking under our weight. The scratching had stopped.

"Maybe it left," Matt suggested.

Suddenly, a loud thump came from behind us. We spun around, our flashlight beams darting frantically.

In the corner stood a figure—a tall, gaunt silhouette barely visible in the dim light.

"Who's there?" I demanded.

No response.

"Hey, this isn't funny," Chris said, his voice shaking.

The figure tilted its head unnaturally, and for a brief moment, the light caught its face—a pale, expressionless mask with empty eye sockets.

We stumbled backward in horror.

"Run!" Dan shouted.

We scrambled back down the hatch, slamming it shut behind us.

"What the hell was that?" Matt gasped, panic etched on his face.

"I don't know, but it's not human," Chris said, bolting the hatch.

From above, we heard the sound of the hatch being tried, the handle rattling.

"It's trying to get in!" Dan yelled.

"To where? We're already inside!" Matt exclaimed.

"Just help me move something over it!" Chris shouted.

We dragged a heavy dresser over and shoved it atop the hatch. The rattling stopped.

"Okay, now what?" I asked, trying to catch my breath.

"We need to get out of here," Dan said.

"And go where?" Matt countered. "Into the storm?"

"Better than staying here with... that," Chris said.

We agreed. Grabbing our coats and whatever supplies we could carry, we headed for the back door.

As we reached it, the door burst open, snow swirling in. Standing in the doorway was the same figure, its hollow eyes fixed on us.

"How did it get there?" Matt screamed.

We backed away slowly.

"Split up!" I yelled. "It's our only chance!"

Without waiting for a response, I darted toward the kitchen, the others scattering in different directions.

I could hear footsteps behind me, deliberate and heavy. I grabbed a knife from the counter, holding it out defensively.

"Stay back!" I shouted, though I doubted it understood.

The figure stopped, tilting its head again. Then, with inhuman speed, it lunged at me.

I ducked instinctively, and it crashed into the cabinets behind me. I didn't wait to see what happened next. I bolted through the kitchen door, racing toward the front of the cabin.

I found Chris and Dan trying to pry open a window.

"Help us!" Chris yelled.

"Where's Matt?" I asked.

"He went upstairs," Dan said, panic in his eyes.

"We can't leave him!"

"Forget that!" Chris snapped. "We need to get out now!"

The window finally gave way, and cold air rushed in. We clambered through, dropping into the deep snow outside.

"Which way to the car?" Dan asked frantically.

"We can't drive in this!" I shouted over the wind.

"Then we run!" Chris said.

We started trudging through the snow, the icy wind biting at our faces. Behind us, the cabin loomed ominously.

"Wait!" I stopped. "We can't leave Matt!"

"We don't have a choice," Chris said, grabbing my arm.

"He's our friend!"

"He's probably already gone," Dan said softly.

I shook my head, torn between fear and loyalty.

Just then, a blood-curdling scream pierced the night, coming from the cabin.

"Matt!" I turned back, but Chris held me firmly.

"There's nothing we can do!"

I wrenched free and started back toward the cabin. As I approached, I saw Matt stumble out the front door, clutching his side.

"Ryan!" he called out weakly.

I ran to him. "Are you okay?"

He shook his head. "We need to go."

I helped him through the snow toward where Chris and Dan were waiting.

"Thank God," Dan breathed.

"Let's move!" Chris urged.

We pushed forward into the forest, the storm relentless. The howling wind seemed almost to form words, whispers that sent chills down our spines.

"Do you hear that?" Matt asked between labored breaths.

"Hear what?" I replied.

"It knows our names," he said, his eyes wide with terror.

"Don't listen," Chris said firmly. "Just keep moving."

Hours seemed to pass as we trudged through the unforgiving terrain. Finally, we saw lights ahead—the faint glow of a roadside diner.

We stumbled in, collapsing onto the floor. The startled staff rushed to help us.

"What happened to you boys?" an elderly waitress asked, concern etched on her face.

"Something... in the woods," I managed to say.

She exchanged a glance with the cook. "You're lucky to be alive," she said quietly.

We tried to explain, but our story sounded insane even to us. The authorities were called, and a search party was sent out to the cabin.

They found it empty. No signs of a struggle, no footprints other than ours. Matt's injuries were dismissed as self-inflicted during a panic.

"Probably got spooked by the storm," the sheriff said.

We knew better.

In the weeks that followed, the four of us drifted apart. Chris refused to talk about what happened. Dan moved away without a word. Matt... well, Matt wasn't the same. He started hearing things, voices calling his name. Last I heard, he checked himself into a psychiatric facility.

As for me, I can't escape the nightmares. Every night, I see that pale face, those empty eyes. I hear the whispers in the wind, feel the cold seeping into my bones.

I learned too late that some places are meant to be left alone, that there are things in this world we can't explain—and shouldn't try to.

If you ever find yourself in a remote cabin during a storm, and you hear a knock at the door, do yourself a favor.

Don't answer it.
