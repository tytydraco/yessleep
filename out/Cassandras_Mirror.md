Sabrina and I had been working together for some years before we decided to get married. She is a historian and I am a chemist. To be more precise, Sabrina specializes in the Witch Hunt which ravaged Europe from around 1450 until 1750.

In theory what we do is simple. Sabrina tracks down any journals she can find, owned by these so-called witches. Their grimoires if you will. Together we recreate and research the recipes we find inside for their medical qualities, selling the data to pharmaceutical companies. Due to the current demand for completely natural beauty products we make a pretty good living, although we are still waiting for our big payday.

We have always joked that we make our living off witchcraft. So much so that when I asked her to marry me, apart from the engagement ring, I also gave her a necklace with a little silver broomstick attached to it. Sabrina always insisted the necklace was a better representation of our love than the engagement ring ever could be. It sort of makes me regret I spent so much money on that ring.

About a year ago, Sabrina became obsessed with a name which kept recurring in various grimoires. Many of these manuscripts referenced a woman by the name of Cassandra. Apparently, Cassandra had been one of the most talented healers of her time. Her grimoire contained knowledge of plants and herbs far exceeding that of any other. Sabrina became fixated on finding Cassandra’s grimoire. She was sure that Cassandra would be our big pay day.

Sabrina spent months going through her research. She combed through countless inquisitorial documents of the catholic church hoping to find a trace of Cassandra in their witch trials. I had never seen her so focused. Sabrina became obsessed. Soon her obsession turned our relationship sour. Sabrina would wake up and lock herself into her office, only to come out to eat and sleep. For weeks we barely spoke.

Then last month, just as I was seriously considering organizing an intervention Sabrina found her.

A 15^(th) century German inquisitor, by the name of Heinrich Kramer, had been the one to condemn Cassandra. Kramer had written about Cassandra in his journal. However, the last page of Kramer’s journal was missing. It seemed to have been ripped out long ago. What we could decipher of Cassandra’s story seemed fragmented and fantastical at best.

Kramer wrote Cassandra had committed a most disgusting sin. A crime so vile it went against the very laws of nature. She had bargained with the devil. Sacrificing hundreds of lives in return for one.  However, Kramer’s writing is vague and due to the absence of the last page the story is incomplete. We did not know what Cassandra’s crime had been. Kramer’s journal offers no further detail about Cassandra’s trial, apart from stating that they would ‘lock away Casandra in a prison for all eternity so even the devil would not find her.’

Sabrina had been livid after reading Kramer’s journal. She thought that Cassandra had just been another victim of our patriarchal society. Just another woman whose only crime was that her knowledge exceeded that of mans.

That weekend I took Sabrina out for dinner in an attempt to lift the mood. She spent the evening silently staring at her food. When we got back into the car I locked the doors and turned to her.

‘This can’t go on any longer. Your obsession with Cassandra is unhealthy. It has to stop ’

Sabrina stared at me. She looked like she was about to argue but then sighed.

‘I can’t’ she said apologetically. ‘After all these months I can’t give up now that I found her. She exists, which means her grimoire exists as well.’

‘God knows how long it will take you to find her grimoire. It almost took you a year to find any reference of Cassandra’s name.’

‘I already found it.’

‘what?’

 ‘I made some calls to my German colleagues,’ Sabrina continued before I could interject. ‘Apparently Heinrich Kramer was quite the hoarder. All of his writings and all the manuscripts he collected have been archived. I asked my friends to do some digging and they found Cassandra grimoire. I have to go to Germany to pick it up.’

I thought about it for a couple of moments. The way I saw it, once Sabrina had Cassandra’s grimoire we could finally go back to how things were before her obsession.

‘Ok,’ I said. ‘Go to Germany and bring back Cassandra’s journal. But when this is done we are taking a vacation.’

Sabrina grinned and threw her arms around me.

‘I promise.’

After her return things became more peculiar. Sabrina just seemed off. She barely spoke to me locking herself away in her study pouring over Cassandra’s grimoire. Sometimes, when I stood at her door and listened I could hear her mutter to herself. Occasionally, I could swear I heard another voice whispering back at her. The thought sent a cold shiver down my spine.

After returning from Germany Sabrina also became obsessed with having children. Sabrina insisted that the time was right for a child, so we began trying every night. We had talked early in our relationship about having children and Sabrina had admitted she would rather focus on her career. Although I had always wanted children I had had no problem waiting until Sabrina felt ready. However, her sudden need for a child felt inexplicable to me.

Over the last three weeks my uneasiness only increased. Sabrina’s behavior has subtly been changing to such an extent I almost began to suspect that the Sabrina I am currently living with is not the one I married. I wanted to investigate what she has been working on so the other day I went into her study. Cassandra’s grimoire lay open in the middle ofr her desk. It seemed to invite me to come closer. As I placed my hand on the grimoires dark leather binding I thought I heard the faintest whisper coming from the book. Before I had time to react Sabrina caught me and kicked me out. I had never seen her so furious. Her eyes seemed to burn with hate as she closed the door behind me.

That’s when I came up with a plan. I needed to get back into her study and investigate Cassandra’s grimoire. A force I did not understand seemed to pull me towards the grimoire. Every Wednesday Sabrina goes out of the house early in the morning only to return in the afternoon. On Monday I told Sabrina I would be gone for a couple days visiting old friends. After I left the house I checked in to a hotel nearby. I waited until Wednesday morning to park my car across the street and wait for Sabrina to leave.

After she left I went into her study. Her desk was littered with stacks of paper. Cassandra’s grimoire sat on the middle of the table. Once again, I felt a strange pull towards the book.

I opened the grimoire and began looking through its contents. The moment my fingers touched the grimoire I could have sworn something whispered out to me. However, every time I tried to understand the whispers they disappeared.

I stared at the grimoires leather binding. It was more artistic then the others and beautifully crafted. Although the book was hundreds of years old the leather had not withered with age. Its black cover shone brightly, almost as if inviting me to open it.  I could make out faint lines cut along the cover. After absentmindedly tracing them with my finger I realized the lines formed a pentagram.

Suddenly the whispers began again, louder than before. I flipped open the book and placed my hand on the inside of the cover. Something felt odd. The leather bounced at my touch. After a brief inspection I realized there was a small incision hidden in the binding. Carefully, I pulled it open and stuck my finger inside, retrieving two sheets of yellowed paper.

I recognized the missing page of Kramer’s journal immediately. Its contents made me feel nauseated.

Kramer wrote that Cassandra had used her magic to kill hundreds of people in her village and sacrificed their souls to the devil. In return Satan granted Cassandra’s eternal wish. Her first born would be the antichrist and ring in the end of time. Kramer tried to burn Cassandra at the stake, but it did not work. She defied death and laughed as the flames licked her body. By his own admission Kramer had been terrified. He could not kill Cassandra through earthly means so to his own shame he resorted to witchcraft himself. Kramer writes that they locked Cassandra away in a realm beyond ours where she would hopefully rot for all eternity.

A pit in my stomach had formed and I could feel myself sweat profusely. Having finished Kramer’s journal I turned my attention to the other piece of paper which had been hidden in the grimoire. The markings on the sheet seemed foreign to me. I only recognized one word which had been scribbled on the top of the paper. Sabrina had written ‘key’ on top of the paper. The moment my fingers touched the sheet the whispers began again. Clearer than ever before. The page whispered at me in a language I did not understand. However, I felt compelled to repeat the words. Then as soon as I repeated the words the whispers disappeared. For a moment I looked around the room in anticipation, but nothing happened. The silence hung heavy around me.

After a moment the absurdity of it all hit me. I felt angry. Did I honestly believe in witchcraft? Was all of this real? I was a scientist after all. A field established through reason. None of this made any sense to me anymore. Maybe it was all in my mind after all. A cry for help from my subconscious?

I got up and walked to the mirror at the far side of the room, staring at my own reflection embittered by my own gullibility.

‘This isn’t real,’ I muttered as I crumbled up the piece of paper in my hand and threw it at my reflection.

The crumbled sheet slipped through the mirrors smooth surface. Like a stone falling in water the paper sent ripples across the surface as it disappeared.

I stood before the mirror petrified unable to understand what happened. I felt my heart going in overdrive. My mind felt heavy, yet I felt compelled to go through the mirror.

I held my breath and stepped inside.

I had entered a small room. It was cold and dark. After my eyes got accustomed to the darkness I began to make out different shapes. Apart from the mirror I had just entered through the room was filled sparsely. A small wooden table and chair stood next to me. On the far side of the room stood a tiny bed. On it I recognized the contours of a body hidden under the covers.

‘Hello?’ I said. My voice a faint whisper.

Hello?’ I forced myself to repeat before slowly shuffling towards the bed.

Once I reached the bed I summoned all my courage and pulled away the covers.

The beds contents made me shriek and fall backwards onto the hard-stone floor.

The shriveled body of a woman lay before me. I was horrified by the state of its decomposition. It seemed to me like someone had sucked the very life force out of her.

Although the body was impossible to identify the clothes it wore seemed familiar. I had seen them before. Tears began to roll down my cheeks. My body had already accepted what my mind was still unable to. That’s when my eyes lingered on the bodies neck. Something shiny had caught my attention.  I bent over the body and saw a small silver broomstick hanging on a necklace.

I began to sob. A sudden wave of despair crashed over me as my knees buckled. I don’t know how long I cried there but it felt like an eternity. The tiny room had drained all happiness away from me. I had to leave. I could not stand to be there anymore. I ran back through the mirror and found myself in my wife’s study once more. I looked back at the mirror. I had left my wife behind. An uncontrollable sadness spread through my body, quickly followed by rage.

All of a sudden, I heard a car door closing outside. Sabrina had returned. She could not find me here. I hurried out of her office and ran down the stairs just in time to see her walk through the front door.

She jumped as she saw me.

‘I thought you would be gone until this evening.’

‘The meetings didn’t take as long as I anticipated.’

Sabrina gave me a searching look.

‘Are you okay? Your eyes look puffy.’

I shrugged. ‘allergies.’

Sabrina beamed at me.

‘Well I’m happy you are here. I have some amazing news.’

‘What is it?’

‘I’m pregnant.’

I saw her lips move but I could not register her words.

Sabrina came towards me.

‘I’m pregnant.’

A smile spread across her face as she stared at me. Her eyes almost bulged out their sockets.

She grabbed my hand. Her touch felt like ice.

‘I’m pregnant.’
