I didn’t want to return, not after everything. But hunger gnaws at you, deep in places you can’t quite reach. It isn’t the hunger for food—it’s the kind that burrows into your bones, whispering, pulling, commanding.

It started two weeks after I got back home. The dreams became more vivid, more intrusive. They weren’t just dreams anymore. I’d wake up in a cold sweat, the metallic scent thick in the air, my muscles sore as though I’d been running all night. I started finding scratches on my apartment walls. Small at first, faint. But they grew deeper, more deliberate. I convinced myself it was nothing—settling wood, perhaps, or my mind playing tricks.

But then I heard it.

The voice.

Low, rasping, and unmistakable. It whispered my name from the shadows of my bedroom, the syllables stretching unnaturally, as if testing how they felt on its tongue.

“Come back.”

The hunger, my hunger, was a sickness now. Food tasted like ash, and sleep felt like sinking into a tar pit. Everything I did during the day felt muted, the edges of my world fraying as the pull grew stronger. I fought it, God knows I did, but one night I woke up in my car, engine idling, headlights piercing the dense fog of a deserted road.

The cabin was five miles ahead.

I don’t remember much about the drive, just fragments—the way the headlights seemed to catch on shapes that weren’t there, the crackling of the radio despite it being turned off, and the ever-present scent of rust and decay. The woods were waiting for me, darker and more twisted than I remembered. The snow had melted early this year, leaving the ground a slick, muddy expanse of rot.

The cabin stood where I left it, but it wasn’t the same. The wood looked older, warped and blackened, as though the forest had been reclaiming it piece by piece. The windows were shattered, the door hanging on a single hinge. As I stepped inside, the metallic scent hit me like a wave, so strong it made my stomach churn.

The fireplace was cold, but the shadows on the walls flickered as though a fire roared within it. And in those shadows, I saw movement—twitching, stuttering shapes that didn’t match the stillness of the room.

I wasn’t alone.

It started with the sound again, that awful scratching. Not outside this time, but inside, above me, below me, all around. The walls groaned and bulged as if something massive was pressing against them, straining to get out—or in.

And then I saw it.

It unfolded from the corner of the room, its limbs too long, its joints bending in ways that defied anatomy. Its eyes glowed with that same sickly light, but this time, there was no mistaking the expression it wore.

It was pleased.

“Hungry,” it said again, though now the word felt layered, as though a dozen voices spoke in unison.

I backed away, but my foot caught on the remnants of a shattered chair, sending me sprawling to the ground. The creature’s head tilted, watching, studying. Its claws tapped against the floor in a slow, deliberate rhythm, like a predator toying with its prey.

“Why?” I whispered, though I wasn’t sure who or what I was asking.

Its head twitched violently, a grotesque spasm that sent a fresh wave of dread washing over me. “Because you… called me.”

I didn’t understand. Called it? I shook my head, scrambling backward as it moved closer, its skeletal frame towering over me. Its breath was cold and foul, its voice dripping with malice.

“The hunger… it’s yours now. You took it from me. But it’s not enough, is it? It will never be enough.”

My mind raced. It didn’t make sense. But then I remembered the clearing, the desperation, the way it recoiled when I struck it. Did I take something from it? Or worse, did it leave something behind?

“You’re lying,” I said, though my voice trembled.

It didn’t respond. Instead, it crouched, its too-long limbs folding like a spider’s, its face mere inches from mine. Its eyes burned brighter, and in them, I saw flashes—images of the clearing, the twisted woods, the moments I’d spent barricading myself in the cabin. But they weren’t memories. They were different. Warped. In these visions, I wasn’t running from the creature.

I was following it.

“You belong here,” it whispered, its voice softer now, almost kind. “They’ll come for you, like they did for me. You’ll see. The hunger… it’s all that matters.”

I couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe. Its words sank into me, pulling at the edges of my mind like thorned vines. I felt it then—the hunger it spoke of. It wasn’t just mine anymore. It was spreading, digging into me like a parasite.

I don’t remember leaving the cabin. The next thing I knew, I was back in the woods, running blindly through the gnarled trees. But this time, the forest didn’t seem endless. It seemed alive, breathing and pulsing with a life of its own. The shadows followed me, whispering, laughing.

And I realized—I wasn’t running away.

I was leading something back.

When I finally emerged from the woods, I collapsed on the side of the road, my body trembling with exhaustion. A car stopped, and a man stepped out, his face pale with concern.

“Are you okay? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

I wanted to warn him, to tell him to leave, but the words wouldn’t come. All I could do was stare at the forest, the shadows pooling at its edge, and feel the hunger clawing at my insides.

The man helped me into his car, and as we drove, I caught a glimpse of my reflection in the rearview mirror. My eyes weren’t mine anymore.

They glowed.

“Am I still me?” I thought but the answer felt… distant. Hollow
