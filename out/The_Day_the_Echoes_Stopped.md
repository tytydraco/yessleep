I never thought silence could be so loud until the day the echoes stopped.

My family lives in a small town, surrounded by dense woods. The kind of place where everyone knows everyone, and nothing much happens. But there’s something strange about our house—something we’ve always chalked up to the age of the building or just our imaginations. You see, our house has always echoed. Footsteps, voices, laughter—it all reverberates in a way that shouldn’t be possible in a place like this. It’s not something you notice right away, but once you do, it’s impossible to ignore. The sound bounces off the walls in a way that seems almost... alive.

A few weeks ago, I noticed the echoes were changing. They started sounding... different. Instead of repeating exactly what we said or did, they began to distort, almost like they were mocking us. If I laughed, the echo would carry on a bit too long, like it was trying to laugh back but didn’t quite know how. When I’d Walk down the hallway, the echo of my footsteps would linger behind, just a second too late, as if something unseen was following me.

It was unsettling, but not enough to make us think anything was really wrong. At least, not until last Thursday.

That night, we were all in the living room. My dad was telling one of his old fishing stories, the kind that makes everyone groan and roll their eyes. Just as he got to the punchline, the power went out. We sat in the dark for a moment, waiting for the hum of electricity to return. When it didn’t, my mom suggested we grab some candles and flashlights.

And that’s when we noticed it.

The silence.

There were no echoes. Not from our voices, not from our movements, nothing. It was as if the house had swallowed every sound and left us in a vacuum. My dad clapped his hands, just to see if it was a trick of the mind, but the sound was flat, absorbed by the darkness. The air felt heavy, like it was pressing down on us from all sides.

We stood there, frozen, unsure of what to do. Then, from somewhere deep within the house, we heard a sound. It was faint at first, a low, distant hum, like a far-off machine. But it grew louder, closer, until we realized it wasn’t just a sound. It was an echo. Our echo, the one that had always been there, but now it was coming from somewhere else.

My dad grabbed a flashlight and started towards the basement, the source of the noise. My mom and I followed, too scared to stay behind but too terrified to go forward. As we descended the stairs, the echo grew louder, and with it came a feeling of dread that made my skin crawl.

When we reached the basement, the sound stopped. The silence that followed was so complete, it felt like it was suffocating us. My dad shone the flashlight around, but there was nothing—just the same old basement, cluttered with boxes and old furniture.

But then, something moved in the shadows.

It was quick, barely more than a flicker at the edge of the light, but we all saw it. My dad stepped closer, but before he could get a better look, the flashlight flickered and went out. We were plunged into darkness, and in that moment, I heard it. The echo, right behind me, breathing in my ear.

We scrambled up the stairs, slamming the basement door behind us. The power came back on a few minutes later, but we didn’t go back down. We couldn’t.

Since that night, the echoes have returned, but they’re not the same. They follow us now, everywhere we go in the house, like they’re watching, waiting. I’ve heard them whispering when no one else is around, mimicking our voices in a way that feels wrong, twisted.

We’re moving out tomorrow, but I’m afraid it’s too late. The echoes have attached themselves to us, and I don’t think they’ll ever let go.

Sometimes, in the dead of night, when the house is silent, I can still hear that hum, that low, distant sound. And I know, deep down, that the echoes are not just a part of the house. They’re something else entirely—something that’s been waiting for a long, long time.

And now, they’ve found us.
