The phone in my pocket vibrates, jolting me back to life. And pulling me away from zoning out. The reflection on the window familiar but yet distantly unrecognisable. I look at the caller ID there's nothing but just a a ghost emoji.

"Hello?", there's loud breathing from the other side, then a childish chuckle "Hellooooooo Mandy How's ya?" a rough voice echoes from the other side of the line. "I don't have time for this whoever you are. What do you want?" I let out a long exhausted sigh. "I wanna play a game witcha",I hang up the call and walk out of the bathroom, school has been chewing me alive I didn't have time for prank calls and silly games. I felt the vibration again on my pocket, and I answered
"If you hang up again. Someone will die. And-" I hung up. It rang a few more times and I did my best to ignore it.

These calls were getting irritating, I blocked the number and wiped my nose for any traces of anti depressants, making my way to the classroom. I found the door crowded, people with phones up shooting pics, "What's going on?", I asked Troy, my classmate who had his hands on his head "Duuude, Dan is dead. He was sitting on the chair, slightly laid back with two of its legs in the air. Perfectly balanced and just snapped, like he he fell and snapped his neck. It broke, I don't think neck has bones but I saw one poking out of his skin". I didn't get a good look at the body, the paramedics were already there dragging it outside with a sheet covering it. Who knew that life was not promised, we are living in hope.

Hope that we get tomorrow hope that we get old. After the whole incident was sorted, they still made us continue with class. The whole class was making a ruckus, some already making a TikToks about his death when my phone vibrated again, this time there were two ghost emojis "I honestly have no time for your bullshit. You fuckin weirdo!" I yelled at the phone as hushly as I could "If youuuuuuuuuuuuuuu hang up, somebody will die Mandy. Or someones" there was another giggle as the voice spoke. I cussed under my breath and hung up. Christina was seated behind me "Is everything okay Mends?" I nodded, "Yea just some silly prankster". The speakers boomed, and a siren rang for our attention. The headmaster spoke "ATTENTION STUDENTS, I'M AFRAID I HAVE BAD NEWS. WE'LL HAVE TO CUT OUR DAY SHORT AS WE HAVE FACED ANOTHER INCIDENT. PLEASE EXIT YOUR CLASSES QUIETLY" the whole school cheered, whistling, hooting and hollering.

On our way out we were met with another set of paramedics rushing towards the back of the classes, "What's happening now?" Christina asked, Troy shrugged "Prolly someone died. Again" I gave him a stink eye, he scrunched "What?". Then the art teacher came towards us teary and whimpering. She was muttering something under her breath. "Miss Lorraine is everything alright?" Christina asked her "Its, its Roger the caretaker. He he. He is dead. He was putting up a fluorescent and somehow the ladder slipped from under him. Sending his head crushing first on the floor" she made incoherent sentences.

"What. THE. FUCK is going on here. Goddammit!" Troy cussed, maybe I didn't want to acknowledge it. Or maybe it was the meds I was on but deep down I felt a chill in my bones. My insides tightened into a knot. Part of me felt responsible for not taking the unknown caller seriously or entertaining him. I shook it off as a coincidence. Until my phone vibrated the third time. Three ghost emojis, I hesitated to answer, the walls felt like they were closing in. The vibration reverberating my whole body. My hand shook as I pulled out the phone and answered "He, hello?" that maniacal voice responded "Hello Mandy. I want us to play a game. If you hang up. Someone DIES", That sent a chill down my spine "You. You're the one doing this? You're the one killing these people ?!", he laughed and clicked his tongue, I pressed record to record the call "Ohh am I? Ohh you are or WE ARE" he sounded menacing. I hung up. And looked around me, Troy raised a brow, "Are you okay Mandy?" I nodded, wiping tears off my eyes, I was crying. He moved towards me to comfort me and I stepped back. "Where's Christina?" I looked around frantically, "She went with Miss Lorraine, walked her to her car why?". I felt a lump in my throat, growing larger and larger making it hard for me to breathe. I ran, Troy yelled something behind me but I couldn't hear it.

What I found at the parking lot, scarred me. Christina was laying on her back gargling her own blood. A hole through her chest with a shiny metal on the other end "She, she came out of nowhere. I didn't. I didn't" Miss Lorraine wailed. The whole scene was grotesque, Christina had a car's exhaust inside her chest and blooding gashing out of her none stop. "That's not, that's not possible. How?!" someone else screamed. And the whole school was plunged into a frenzy. And I was plunged into despair. 

The phone vibrated again, three ghost emojis. I stared at it, legs wobbly and buckled under the pressure of what might happen next and I thought "Fuck it, what's the worst that can happen" I switched it off. Troy sat next to Christine's body, his phone started ringing but he ignored it. Eventually the sound of *Baby Shark* playing on repeat was starting to irritate him he switched it off. They gave me Christina's belongings mainly her backpack, I didn't feel like taking the bus I decided to walk home leaving the school behind me. I didn't go through it. Maybe it's the meds or I'm entirely numb, I didn't feel as much grief as I had hoped. Even though me and her have been friends our whole lives. Her backpack vibrated, I looked inside and it was her phone vibrating. Three ghost emojis flickered on her phone I answered "Listen up you sick fuck. If-" he cut me off when I was in the middle of my rant. 

"Nahh uhh Mandy, the penalty for switching off your phone resulted in another tintsy bitsy DEATH" I hung up. Sirens flew past me, heading back to the school. I must've been a 50 metres away, the ambulance came to an abrupt stop making a loud screeching sound. My feet dragged me backwards, yet my mind wanted to keep moving forward. Just as I was about to reach the gate the ambulance had crashed into Miss Lorraine. Dragging her across the asphalt, bits of flesh and blood painted the road. Apparently she got stuck under the wheel and the car just dragged her, and dragged her all over the road skidding to a halt.

Days passed, I didn't use my phone. I didn't even see my phone. I switched it off and put it in a box in the attic. Things started to die down bit bit, I decided to get a new phone. "Do you think those freak accidents were God? " Troy asked me one day on our nightly walks "I mean it had to be. Or the devil. Whichever one of them fucks", there was anger on his voice. "I don't know. I just. If it's a God then he has a shitty humor" I told him about the calls, and the threats, I even pulled up the call recoding and told Troy to listen to it. Placing it on his ear and listened intently "Are you fucking kidding me Mandy?! Is this some kind of twisted joke?!" he spat, throwing the phone at me. There was a look of resentment in his eyes. 

"What?! Can't you see. That whoever was calling me might have something to do with it?" he stared at me with daggers "That's you. Talking to yourself. Cut the theatrics", I listened to the call and my jaw dropped. There was no one on the other end. I was talking to no one, I started getting teary. "You really need to stop sniffing those anti depressants. Those are pills. You stick them in your mouth not up your nose Amanda. Geez, I've lost my- I've lost Christina I don't have time for this".

As if on cue, my phone rang four ghost emojis. We both stared at it, I looked at Troy in acknowledgement to see if we were both seeing it and sure we were. He snatched it off my hands "You fuckin bastard", before he could say anything his eyes widened. Stood there for a few seconds none blinking. Then he dropped my phone and started walking away in a robotic manner, walking right into the busy road. I charged just in time to push him away from oncoming traffic, he looked at me with those vacant eyes. Scrambling for my phone I picked it up the unknown caller was still there and so were the five ghost emojis, "What did you do. Why are you doing this?!", the response was a loud chuckle followed by clicking of the tongue "Watch and see", before me Troy took out his phone and puts it inside his mouth and starts biting down. He bites, bits of glass cutting through his skin. He kept chewing, swallowing, Troy was eating his phone. I could see the tears in his eyes as he struggled to swallow those shattered bits. Bloody coming out of his mouth and holes on his neck, my best friend died right before me he made sure to eat his phone until every bit of it was in his mouth. 

After that incident, the calls seized. My meds weren't working, maybe because I was broken mentally or because I was trying to hard not to think about those deaths. 

One day, what I dreaded the most happened. The phone rang, I was enveloped with a feeling of dread before I answered. Heartbeat seemed to intensify, palms sweaty and my breathing was labored. There were many ghost emojis, they covered the whole screen, I feared what it might symbolise "Hello?" I answered with a quivering voice "Hellooooooo Mandy. I want us to play a game. I was getting a bit bored", he chuckled. Finally it hit me, I haven't asked the game ever since he started calling "What. What game?". He chuckled  jovially "Yes!!! Oh yes That's a good girl. The game is Simple and fun. TAG. Play a game of tag in the bus and when it reaches the stop. You have to kill whoever It is. Or else you all die" the caller laughed, the sound of his voice booming in my head as he laughed like a maniac he was. I found myself crying again, tears streaming down my face. 

From what I've seen so far, I knew what he was capable of. I had to play, but it would be hard to convince the others. So I just tagged the quietest girl in the bus. Back and forth, everyone started warming up and joining in. The bus was lively, teens just having fun. It felt right, it felt great. The girl's name was Lizzy or something I think. She'd never had any interaction with anyone in the bus because of her shyness. I sobbed silently, as she smiled at me in approval. For once she felt like she belonged she felt like she was one of us. Until the bus came to a stop. I slipped all the crashed anti depressants I had in her glass of water and watching her drink hungrily every drop. Once everyone was off the bus, I gave her one look before I saw her eyes close. Forever.
