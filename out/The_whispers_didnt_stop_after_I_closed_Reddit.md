I’ve always had this bad habit. Every night before bed, I scroll through r/nosleep like it’s my own bedtime storybook. Not fairy tales, of course—nightmares. I don’t know why I do it. Most people listen to relaxing music or watch something funny. Me? I dive into ghost stories and urban legends until my eyes burn.

Usually, nothing happens. I’ll get creeped out for a bit, maybe glance at the closet once or twice, then fall asleep. The fear doesn’t follow me past the screen.

But last night, it did.

I was reading this post about a guy who kept hearing whispers in his apartment. It wasn’t even the scariest thing I’d ever read, but the way he described the sound stuck with me. He said it started soft, almost like someone breathing right behind the wall, and every night it got closer.

When I finished, I locked my phone and set it on the nightstand. It was around midnight. I turned off the lamp and lay back, trying to relax.

And then I heard it.

A whisper.

At first I laughed under my breath. It had to be in my head, right? Just my brain replaying the story. But the sound wasn’t inside my skull. It was in the room with me.

I opened my eyes. The whole place was dark, except for that tiny blue glow from the charger. I stayed perfectly still, holding my breath. For a few seconds, nothing. Just silence.

“Okay, you’re imagining things,” I whispered to myself.

But then I heard it again—closer this time. Right by my ear. A low, raspy breath that definitely didn’t belong to me.

I jumped, reaching for the lamp. Light flooded the room. Empty. Just me, tangled in the blankets.

I grabbed my phone, thinking maybe some ad had popped up or a video was playing in the background. But the screen was black. No sound.

I should’ve kept the light on, but I didn’t. I told myself it was all in my head, switched it off, and shut my eyes tight.

Minutes later, the whisper came back. Not by my ear this time. From the corner. The one with my closet door slightly cracked open.

I couldn’t move. My whole body felt locked in place, like if I even twitched, whatever was in that corner would notice me. The whisper got louder, almost like actual words. I couldn’t make them out, but I swear to God it was saying my name.

Somehow, exhaustion won. I don’t even remember falling asleep.

When I woke up this morning, the sunlight made everything feel stupid. Like it really had all just been a nightmare. I even laughed a little at myself.

But then I reached for my phone.

The screen was lit up. Reddit was still open. And there it was—the exact story I’d read last night, still sitting on the screen.

Except there was something new.

A comment. One that hadn’t been there before.

Three words.

“Did you hear?”
