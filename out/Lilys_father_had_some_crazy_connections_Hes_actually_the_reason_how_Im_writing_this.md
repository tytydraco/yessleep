Lily’s dad’s friend had connections. 

Whenever her family ran into the slightest inconvenience, it was solved hours later. Her mother was fired from her job, and was promoted to a higher position hours later. Her grandpa had terminal cancer, and was miraculously cured. Lily realized her family had their own personal fairy godmother. All her father had to do was ring Mike, who pulled strings that she never saw. 

Lily used to joke that if Mike ever died, his funeral would be attended by a mysterious man standing under a black umbrella. Her father said it was never *that* serious, but over the years she noticed Mike fixed all their problems. 

Her brother got into his dream college without even trying. He didn't even graduate high school, and somehow got into Harvard, with Mike’s connections. 

So, Lily didn't even *try* in her first year of college, moving back home and getting a job in the mall. She wanted to be a photographer, not a doctor, which was what her father insisted on. 

Mike got her into a prestigious medical school, but she was scared of blood. Lily’s father was pissed, but he didn't say anything, allowing her to stay for the summer. He told her Mike would be able to get her into another medical school abroad, but Lily insisted she wanted to do a photography course instead. 

She asked her father if he could get his *connections* to find her a job in photography, but he was adamant that both of his children were going to medical school. 

Lily’s brother was training to be a surgeon. 

Which was weird, when, just a year prior, he had attempted to leave home with his girlfriend, to pursue his passion for acting. Lily hadn't spoken to him in a while, but Dex had suddenly dropped his love for acting and dumped his girlfriend. 

The night before he ran away, he told her to do the same. 

*There's something wrong with Mike,* he told her. 

Lily’s brother had been suspicious of Mike since they were kids and their father’s friend had stopped them getting sick. The two had the stomach flu once during middle school, and had not been sick since. 

Dex was convinced it was witchcraft. 

Now he was a completely different person. 

Lily knew siblings grew apart when they left for college, but this was a whole other level. Dex never answered her texts or calls, and when he did, he was either studying, in night classes, or with his smart-ass friends. Growing up was a given, she knew that. But Dex became a stranger. He was too different at Thanksgiving dinner, too formal, like he'd been possessed by a royal, talking in depth about his classes, and that he was the top ranked student. That wasn't Dex. She knew it wasn't her brother, because Dex hated being categorised. 

He could barely focus in school, his teachers insisting on him being screened for ADHD, which their father refused. 

Lily jokingly commented that Dex didn't even graduate high school, and her father almost choked on a mouthful of turkey.

Her mother pursed her lips around the rim of her wine glass. 

Dex hadn't spoken to her since, completely under their father’s spell. 

When they were kids, her brother left Lily little notes to reassure her she was going to be okay. But when she searched his room, there was nothing, only the ghost of who her brother used to be. His application for a drama school in New York was still on his dresser, crumpled under old movie posters and textbooks, covered in coffee stains. He'd only written his name.

She laughed at that. 

*That* was Dexter. Distracted by everything. 

It was 2am when Lily’s father pulled her out of bed. 

“Huh?” wiping sleep from her eyes, she blinked at her dad, confused. 

“Get in the car,” he told her. “We’re going out.”

Sliding onto cool leather seats, hesitantly, Lily was still wrapped in her blanket, still sleepy, her head pressed against the car window. When Lily was a little more awake, her mind drifting into fruition, she noticed her father was driving out of town. Her heart started to skip in her chest, her stomach twisting into knots. “Where are we going?”

He didn't reply, cranking the radio up. 

Pressing her face against the glass, Lily blinked at the long, winding road, blanketed oblivion in front of her. 

They were in the middle of rural Virginia, and her phone was dead. She had several locations in her head, though neither of them justified 2am. 

Was grandpa sick? 

The more she thought about it, the sicker Lily felt. She didn't like the dark, and it was the kind of dark that felt almost empty, hollow, like there was no ending and the road would continue forever. To Lily, the dark was suffocating, and being enveloped in the wide open oblivion, her heart was trying to catapult itself into her throat. 

There were no streetlights, and the further away they were driving from home, from safety, panic was starting to creep its way down her spine. 

“Dad,” Lily said, her voice a sharp whisper, “Where are you taking me?”

When her father didn't answer, only stepping on the gas, she kicked his seat. 

“Dad!”

Lily’s father’s fingers tightened around the wheel. 

“Shopping,” was his only response. 

Shopping? Lily's mind whirred with questions. 

At 2am?

When she leaned back in her seat, her hands delving between the gaps by habit, her fingers grazed a piece of card. 

Lily thought it was trash, but peering at it, something was written in black ink. 

When a streetlight finally appeared, a sickly glow illuminating the note, she found herself staring at a single word written in her brother’s old writing.

Lily was well aware Dex’s handwriting had drastically changed. 

For example, on her recent birthday card, her brother signed his name in perfect calligraphy. 

But Lily knew his old writing, his scrappy scribbles that were hard to read, which was exactly what she was staring at. 

RUN. 

Her gaze flicked to the front. Luckily, her father wasn't paying attention. 

“Shopping?” Lily said shakily, her hand pawing for the lock on the door. Her breaths were heavy, suddenly, suffocated in her chest. She maintained a smile, but Lily felt like she was drowning, her brother’s note grasped between her fingers. She slid across her seat and tried the other door. Locked. 

“Mmm. Shopping,” her father hummed. “We’re out of milk.”

“But there are no stores open.” 

Lily was aware the car was slowing down, and was already planning her escape. Her mind felt suffocated and wrong, and there were so many questions. If Dex had been on this exact car ride, then what happened to him? Mike was her top suspect. If her dad’s friend could turn her brother into a stranger, then he could do anything to her. Lily weighed her options, feverishly watching her father find a parking spot. If she dove over the front seat when he wasn't looking, she would be able to get away. 

However, when she was ready to leap over the seat, her father stopped the car and jumped out, yanking her out of the backseat. In her panic, she dropped the note, stumbling out into cool air that grazed her cheeks. The sky above was too dark, no stars. Lily was going to run, when she glimpsed the towering building in front of her. The place reminded her of a warehouse, or even a facility, a silver monolith in the middle of nowhere. 

There was a lake nearby, and nothing else. 

Her father grabbed her hand gently, though his grasp was firm, a subtle order to stay by his side. 

He flashed his ID card at a guard, pulling her towards automatic doors lit up an eerie white light. Lily’s panic twisted into confusion, relief coming over her like warm water. Her dad was right. It *was* a shopping centre. When they entered, an aisle of canned food greeted her, then snacks and medical supplies. 

She passed survival equipment, and then a whole section dedicated to books. 

What was this place? 

It was like a super Cost-co. 

When Lily reached for a cart, her father kept pulling her further down each aisle, and the deeper she was dragged into this place, what was being sold started to contort in her vision, like she was in a nightmare. Lily was frowning at whipping cream and baking soda, before they turned a corner, a sudden blur of twisted scarlet surrounding her.

She thought it was fish at first, fresh fish being sold early. 

Except each bulging mass of red she passed was unmistakably human. 

“Dad,” she rasped, catching sight of a human heart sitting on display, encased in ice. 

“What is this place?”

Lily blindly followed her father, but she couldn't tear her gaze from each aisle becoming more clinical. Like she wondered inside an emergency room. 

There were body parts for sale, both dead and alive, human brains both separate, and being sold with their bodies. 

People. 

Normal people put on display, their skin marked with red pen, highlighting their parts. 

Lily stopped walking, coming to a halt, her body was petrified.

Lily couldn't breathe. 

“Lily.”

Her father pulled her in front of one sign in particular. *Intelligence. (17-25)*

She saw others. 

*Intelligence. 25-30*

*Intelligence. 30-40*

The advertisement showed a group of smiling teenagers, mid-laugh.

But her eyes weren't on the sign, or even her father, already forking out cash. Lily was aware she was taking steps back, but she couldn't bring herself to move, to twist around and run. They were too deep into the store, and the exit was so far away, a labyrinth she wouldn't be able to get through. 

The store owner greeted her father, and Lily had to breathe deeply to stay afloat. 

Her legs gave way, but she wouldn't allow herself to fall. 

Not in this place. 

Her head was spinning, everywhere she looked there was either body parts, or people with those body parts on display. 

Her father introduced himself as a friend of Mike, though his voice didn't feel real, drifting in and out of reality. 

The display said *Intelligence*, but intelligence didn't make sense. There was a guy standing in front of her, blondish brown hair, his pupils wide and dilated. 

Dressed in a simple white shirt and shorts, he looked almost high, and yet despite that, Lily noticed he was trembling, his hands pinned behind his back. He stood perfectly straight, his chin up, eyes forward, like a puppet on strings. It wasn't until her gaze found his forehead, where his IQ  had been written in permanent marker, when she realized what the store was advertising. 

Lily found herself wondering if this boy had the same suffocating urge as her. 

*Run.*

“Ben is our smartest! He was donated a few weeks ago. Apparently, he tried to kill himself! Who would have thought, right? A smart kid like that trying to end it! Anyway, he's been fully checked. The kid graduated early and attended Cambridge university in England, only to move back home and attempt suicide on Christmas Eve,” the stall owner's voice slammed into her, and Lily remembered her brother’s sudden change in personality.

She let out a sob, her nerve endings suddenly on fire. Still, she couldn't take her eyes off of the *intelligence* being paraded in front of her. 

This nineteen year old boy with a crooked smile, freckles speckling his cheeks. 

This kid, who had a life, a family and friends, and a reason why he chose to die.

Reduced to an empty shell with a high IQ.

The owner gestured to the kid, who didn't even blink, didn't dare make eye contact with her. *No*. Lily said, and then she said it louder, twisting around. There were three guards in front of her. 

Following the store owner’s order to restrain her, they did, hesitant when her father barked at them not to hurt her. 

“I can assure you, your daughter will have a sparkling career.” The stall owner was smiling widely, and Lily was screaming, struggling violently. 

“I'll take him,” her father said, unfazed by her crying. “How much is he?”

“950.” the man said. “My wife has done business with you before, so consider it a discount.” he turned to the boy with a laugh. “Ben is a good boy, so it'll take around three hours. Usually, upon removal, the brain goes into shock, and can sometimes shut itself down due to trauma. It can take weeks, even months for it to settle inside its new body.” his smile widened, and Lily heaved up her meagre dinner, spewing all over the guard. When she screamed, her cries were muffled. I have to get out of here, her thoughts were paralysed, fight or flight sending her into a manic frenzy. 

Her frenzied gaze found the boy, who this time met her gaze. 

But he kept smiling, wider and wider. 

The owner ignored Lily’s freak out. When she head butted a guard and lurched back, Lily had no idea where to go. She dropped to her knees, only to be violently dragged back to her feet. 

“However,” the owner rolled his eyes at her, “like I said, Ben wanted to die,” he chuckled. “I'm positive he won't fight back, and if he does, you're free to return him within thirty days, like all of our products. Oh! Also, do not worry. The mind had been wiped of personality. The only thing remaining is the IQ of the boy, and his achievements. We remove the core person, shortly after buying from our distributor to avoid… let's call them complications.”

Lily's father nodded slowly. “Then I'll take him.”

Lily stopped struggling, her body going still. 

Was this really happening? 

Was she going to die? 

“Dad,” she whispered, when her father cupped her cheeks and told her to be brave. She tried to use soothing tones, resorting to screaming at her father, telling him she wanted him dead. Lily thought it might wake him up, make him realize that she was his daughter. 

“Dad!” 

Except he didn't listen, his hands tightening on her shoulders.

“You want to be smarter, don't you, Lily?” 

“No!” an animalistic shriek ripped from her throat.

She tried to attack him, screeching like a wild animal. 

Lily tried to run, biting down on a guard’s hand. But it was her father who pulled her back, which brought reality crashing down on her. Lily stopped trying to get away, stopped crying, when she was picked up and taken through a door splattered with scarlet. 

She remembers being pinned down on an ice cold surface, a cruel prick in her neck numbing her limbs, and silver blades whirring above her. Her arms and legs were restrained, her forehead marked with a cold red pen that tickled. 

Lily laughed, but her laughter exploded into sobs. 

Figures in blue scrubs surrounded her in a blur. 

The sound of a saw startled her numb thoughts, and she twisted her head, eyes flickering, lips trying to form words. The back of her head had been shaved, her bald head grazing ice cold metal. 

When the sound of the saw became unbearable, she gave up and forced herself to peer through a curtain of plastic. Lily glimpsed a bed next to hers, pooling red seeping across the floor, a limp arm hanging over the edge. 

The hand was still moving, still clenching into a fist, like they could feel it, every cruel slice ripping them apart. 

She wondered about who the boy was. 

What his life was like, and why he chose to end his life.

Lily squeezed her eyes shut when the saw continued, blood beginning to run, almost black across pristine white tiles. 

When she opened them, the bed was being wheeled away. 

And it was her turn.

Footsteps came thudding towards her, the screeching sound of a saw coming to life. They didn't give her a countdown or tell her everything was going to be okay. Lily saw a bright light, so close she could almost reach it. 

She did, half wondering if it was her father. 

Maybe he'd changed his mind after all.

But Lily didn't wake up. 

I did. 

I woke with a smile and a body that felt comfortably mine. 

I took my new father’s hand, the bandages around Lily’s head itchy.

When my father took me home, I waited until night. Then I went into the kitchen and chose the sharpest knife I could find, butchering the bastard when he was curled up in bed. He should have been awake, like you were Lily. He should have been able to feel it. 

I'm glad Mom was out, because then I'd have to kill her too. 

I'm sorry I took your body, Lily. 

And for the record, I didn't *want* to die. 

I was kidnapped and sold overseas by my psychotic university professor. 

I didn't jump off of a fucking bridge on Christmas Eve. 

That's the story he tells to all of his customers. 

So they feel better about murdering us. 

I still have a family out there, waiting for me to come home. 

And I'm going to find them. 

Fuck. I'm sorry I took your body, Lily. 

I'm sorry your dad is a piece of shit. 

And I'm sorry I burned your house to the ground. 

Lily never answered me until a few days ago. 

Her voice is soothing, still haunting the back of my mind. 

*It's okay,* Lily is happy I killed her father. 

But she wants to know what happened to her brother. 

*I'm sorry my dad has connections.*
