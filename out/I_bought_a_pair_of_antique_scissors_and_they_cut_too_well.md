In full accuracy the title should say “shears”, as Elizabeth would insist on correcting me. Apparently once a pair of scissors reaches the ripe length of 8 inches it becomes shears. These measure in at 8 and a quarter. 



Elizabeth is a collector of vintage scissors. I suppose there is a bit of a world for that, but it’s not nearly as structured as some worlds of collection. Meaning that there aren’t inherently much better types of scissors than others in terms of collectability. And the ability to figure out exactly who the maker or the age of a pair of scissors is mostly a game of vague clues and indefinite endings. 



I found them in an antique stall at the state fair of all places. I had no idea that they had stalls like that but amongst vendors selling art and beef jerky and wind chimes I found a humble antique seller. The proprietor was a kindly looking old lady (I say “looking” because she was honestly kinda rude). I’m an avid explorer when it comes to things like fairs and museums, so I walked in to see what she had to offer. 



A pile of trinkets here and a mound of baubles there. I hate to say but it just felt like a lot of junk, none of this stuff was particularly polished or displayed with any sense of importance. I was happy to abandon my search when a smaller group of items mounted on peg boards caught my attention. I’d assume these were the better quality items, as they at least seemed to transcend the status of clutter. 



That’s when the scissors caught my eye.



I pulled them off the peg board. A gold foil picture caught my attention too so I grabbed that and made my purchase with the woman. 



The scissors, or shears upon measuring them, are old and iron. They are a dark brown hue marked with patches of patina, making some spots closer to orange and others tar black. The shape of the handles is plain but the blades are fascinating, one is similar to a modern day scissor blade but the other is thicker and nearly twice as wide. Based on some quick research they would appear to be “bookbinder” scissors designed for cutting through thick paper and leather. 



The next day I had placed them in a cardboard box with styrofoam peanuts and was measuring out the gift wrap, when something ironic happened. I couldn’t find any scissors. I needed to cut the paper, then the ribbon, but I couldn’t find a single pair. Not the one that’s normally in my desk, nor the kitchen scissors or even the fabric scissors usually in the craft closest. 



As I closed the door to the craft closet I laughed to myself. What a ridiculous issue when I had a solution right here. 



So I fished them out of the packing peanuts. Slid my fingers into the handles, then took them to the paper. This was when I realized that I hadn’t actually opened or cut anything with them yet. While Elizabeth doesn’t feel that strongly, her preference is that they work passably. So this would double as a test run. 



Surprisingly, considering their wear, they worked perfectly. They glided seamlessly through the paper then the ribbon. 



As I sat looking at the cut paper I decided that I needed to redo it. So I crumpled it up and began again. This time carefully, and methodically sliding the scissors through the paper. And I was amazed that even going slowly the blades didn't catch for a moment. I imagined how perfect that edge must be. How immaculately sharp…



Ow! 



I looked down to see red starting to spread into the paper. It radiated from a small knick in my thumb. In my fixation on the scissors I had stupidly left my thumb at the edge of the paper in its path. 



It was fine, I just finished the cut and removed any bit that had been stained. There was still more than enough. 



I placed the box in the center of the paper and I found myself hesitating. It was time to put the scissors back in the box but... I just didn’t want to. Not anymore. I started to think to myself that she has so many that she couldn’t possibly be able to actually appreciate any of them individually anymore. Not like I would, as someone who didn’t have a collection. And now it seemed I didn’t even have my normal ones, so I could only cherish them all the more. 



Quicker than I would like to admit I came to a decision and I wrapped the box and tied the ribbon- with the gold foil picture inside. 



Happy with the outcome I took the scissors and I thought it was no better a time to get to the collaging that I had been meaning to get to for weeks. A box under my desk overflowed with magazines taunting me every time I walked past it. It was about time that I faced it. 



In particular, I was so excited because on a previous antiquing trip I had found a glamor magazine from the 1950’s with a picture of Marilyn Monroe that I was eager to make the centerpiece of my new collage. 



Soon I was engulfed in a pile of scrap paper.



But for a moment, I felt a sort of panic like I was standing in a snow storm watching it build up around me and before long I would be buried alive in it, snow piling past my mouth, and I’d be choking on the cold before I knew what was happening…



I shook it off and continued on my way. Savoring and enjoying every snip and cut of paper. The scissors continued to perform perfectly in my hands. And finally I was facing a beautiful background for Marilyn. I had already cut her out in preparation so the only thing left was to glue her on. I turned to pick her up but…



I don’t know how or when. But it was ruined. She was in two pieces, split at the neck. I tried to be so careful but at some point I must have not noticed her sticking to a piece I was intending to cut and accidentally took her with it. 



I lamented her and felt my stomach drop. I sat with it for a minute before I picked up the tape and made-do as best as I could. In the end it looked basically fine, but it felt like a waste of its potential. 



Then a different disappointment struck me. I realized I didn’t have anything else that I needed to cut. I had efficiently moved through my collaging box and didn’t have anything else I needed to cut. So, with some melancholy, I put the scissors away in my desk drawer. 



The next day at work I had this persistent sense of longing. It didn’t take much time to realize that I wanted some excuse to cut papers again. 



I have a desk job and one of my tasks is making copies of receipts. I had a small pile of them that I had done this morning, which meant I no longer needed the originals. So excitedly I pulled out my desk pair of scissors and then took to cutting them in half then half again then taking off corners to try to round them out. 



But my excitement quickly faded and I felt ridiculous. I set aside the scissors and threw away the scraps of the receipts and went back to my work feeling, honestly childish. 



I have a coworker. Her name is Emily.  Emily is sort of a hippie type. Vegan, very organic, nature focused. She’s a kind person overall and after a talk with HR last year where it was requested that she switch off from natural deodorants she’s always been a super easy person to get along with. The other thing to know about Emily is her hair is long. Very very long. Usually at work she lets it hang all the way down to her butt. However, today was different. Today she had spent the time to braid all of its incredible length. 



My eyes were transfixed by it, following it around whenever she would pass my desk or go down the hall I could see from my chair. I would catch myself staring and go back to my work but I’d suddenly become aware that I hadn’t actually done any work at my computer and that minutes had gone by without me even realizing. 



At one point I ‘came to’ at my computer and realized I was staring at the lockscreen screen saver. That meant I hadn’t touched a key or even moved the mouse for at least 15 minutes, and if you had asked me I would have said no time had passed at all.



I decided to get up and walk to the water cooler to clear my head.



Lo and behold who got to the water cooler just a moment before me. She turned and apologized. As she turned back to fill her bottle that braid whipped in front of my eyes. 



I don’t remember catching it in my hand. And I absolutely don’t remember even putting that pair of scissors in my work bag. But now somehow the braid was in one hand and the scissors were in the other. 



I will admit that I was fully aware as I opened them then moved them to gently caress her on either side of the braid. Then with their oily smooth action I squeezed those two blades together. 



Three feet of hair fell to the ground. It even bounced, just a touch. 



It felt luxurious. 



For a moment I was lost in euphoria. Suddenly everything looked right. She looked right. No strange long ugly hair, now everything was correct.



But as I came back to myself and saw her eyes full of horror and anger and the tears welling in them, I was only too present. 



I was fired, packed up my desk, and was home within the hour. 



Strangely, I remembered packing that box close to the top with four years of accumulated bits and things, but when I set it down on my kitchen table I realized how incredibly light it was. When I opened it up there was only one item inside. 



I’m not a fool. I can see that there’s something wrong with these scissors; that they’re in some way pushing me to use them. And they seem to have a nature to them that is scaring me. The problem is I want to throw them away, but now I’m home without a job or anything to focus my energy on. Fortunately, I have enough money that I’m not in dire straits if it takes a few weeks to get back to work. So I’ve found myself with an excess of time. 



Time unfortunately has only provided fuel for this fire. As one day has folded into another I’ve found my fingers entangled in the handle of the scissors more and more often. On day one I ran out of legitimate reasons to be using them. Everything that needed to be cut has been. And since I’ve sort of just been sifting through papers that are lying around that I don’t need. 



Mostly what calls to me is that they often have such obnoxious corners. Jutting and inorganic. And I find that cutting through them makes the pictures themselves feel so much more…correct. I suppose that’s the word. Most of the time this correcting leads to a lovelier result. There have been a handful of times where I found myself providing correction after correction and before I realized it the picture or paper was rendered to nothing but confetti on the floor. 



I took them to cook. I got myself some carrots, celery, and onions to make a mirepoix and then maybe use that for soup or something else. I know cooking shears are not uncommon, especially in some cultures more than others. But I will guess that rarely are bookbinding scissors used, nor are they used as universally as I used them. 



They worked perfectly and everything was vanquished by them easily. As I cut the carrots a thought did cross my mind. Years ago, I remember being told that chopping carrots was similar in difficulty as cutting fingers. As someone with a fair amount of cooking experience, including taking apart animal parts, I’d guess carrots would actually be harder. 



After I made myself an excess of soup I found myself lacking for things to consume with my new obsession. I decided that the best thing to do would be to make my way to the hardware store so I could give my scissors and I new things to devour. 



Soon I had collected long delicious wooden dowels, and was bundling up lengths of rope that I knew would give me so many amazing cuts before it was too short to offer any satisfaction. 



The problem was as I was making my way to the checkout counter, I made the mistake of walking through the lamp section. As I was passing through that little tunnel of wonderful light. The long black cords caught my eyes. The ones that were plugged in had their cords behind them tucked away to reach the outlets. But the ones that were on display had them hanging long and thin. 



I stood there, moments turning into minutes. I didn’t even have to take my eyes off them when I realized there was a familiar weight in my hands. At this point I couldn’t even find myself to be surprised. I fear I was already well down a path that I didn’t understand, and finding I had subconsciously brought them into the store wasn’t all that surprising at the moment. 



There was one aspect that caught my attention though. I could feel the metal of the handle and it felt *cold*. At this point, I had been here long enough for them to have warmed up to my touch if they were always in my hand or even if they were in my pocket. 



But even that unexpected element only delayed me a few seconds before I took the cord in hand and slid that metal mouth around them. And with a satisfying bite, the cord fell to the ground. It felt incredible. I worried for a moment that I may even be drooling. 



I took another cord in hand when I heard a sound to my left. I think it may not have been the first. 



“Hey! I said don’t touch that!”



I looked over with glossy eyes. And just watched without really processing anything. Until a rush of adrenaline came over me and I realized a security guard was running toward me. 



That was enough to wake me back up and I was running too now, in the opposite direction. I cleared that aisle and glanced back to see him still approaching. I scanned over the store to plan my escape.



It wasn’t long before I burst into the parking lot, moving at a full sprint, and made my way to my car. Before long I was back home. However,  I had been forced to abandon my supplies during my escape. 



I came back into the house, with panic admittedly growing in my heart. The panic wasn’t about the security. It had far more to do with the fact that I in that moment I had felt that cutting that cord was such a normal, reasonable thing to do. It made perfect sense to me. I knew that me and the scissors would like it. 



…



“And the scissors”?



I’m not sure why I said that. I meant that I did it because I thought I’d enjoy it and that’s all it took.



As I panicked, the first thing that came to mind was that I should cut some things and that would make me feel better. Realizing the self-defeating logic that I just thought, I began to pace around trying to figure something out. Figure a way out of it. 



I couldn’t think of anything, and every time I looked around my room I realized all the amazing things that could be cut. Eclectic cords, family photos, art prints, and nearly anything else I could fit those blades around. 



My anxiety soared, so I went  to the bathroom and began splashing water on my face. The water was cool and shocking my body. I felt my heart rate lower and thoughts begin to slow and I looked up to face myself in the mirror. 



That’s when I noticed how much ears stick out. They’re so strange. The head is so smooth and consistent, except for those weirdly shaped protrusions of soft flesh. They just looked so odd all of a sudden. So unnatural. I considered that maybe it was just my ears, but no I think all human ears are just strange and irregular, but perhaps mine more so than others. 



I will confess, it did cross my mind how that soft flesh would feel as the scissors bit through them. But that’s not why I would do it, I would do it because it only made sense. It would return my head to a much more normal, much more “right” shape. But a part of me was ready to savor the feeling as they glided gracefully through me.



The blades sat above and below the base of my ear. I began to squeeze slowly -slowly because I reasoned that they were so soft it was likely they would go through so quickly I wouldn’t get a chance to savor it. 



I can’t lie about the smile that was pushing across my face as I watched the metal come closer and closer, then press into my skin. 



Thank god for that masochistic desire to prolong the sensation because as soon as they cut into my flesh and a bead of red ran down my face, I snapped out of it. I threw the scissors away from me. They bounced off the wall and clattered into the bathtub. 



I cupped my ear as pain shot through my head deep into my skull. 



What was I doing?



I rolled up a wad of toilet paper in my hand and pressed it against the cuts on the top and bottom of my ear. Fortunately they weren’t deep, just enough to draw a little blood and send jolts of pain through me. 



A new fear washed over me. Maybe for the first time I was feeling the proper amount of fear that I should be. I stared at those scissors in the tub, specks of blood around them and I was hit with the overwhelming sense that they wanted more. That they had just gotten a taste and now they wanted a *lot* more. 



I wasn’t sure what to do. I thought maybe it was best to use the pain as long as it was with me to make my move. I bent over and reached out to pick them up but then pulled away. I decided better than to touch them directly. I pulled my towel off the wall and threw it on top then bundled it around them. Like how you might use a tissue to pick up a bug. 



I took the swaddled pile and quickly ran outside and threw it into the trash bin. Trash day is only a couple days away. And when I wake up that morning they will be gone. 



I came back inside and sat down at my computer to type this all out. I thought I should document to myself what has happened these past days, before my mind has a chance to cast a fog of doubt and reconstruct things to feel more normal. 



Now I wait until the garbage truck arrives and takes them away. I plan to stay inside and stay away from the front windows where I might be able to see the trashcan. I know that they possess some sort of effects and whether that’s enough to bring themselves back in on their own or if they need me, I’m not sure. But I plan to not give them a chance to use me. Now I hope and wait, hoping too that they may not find another person to manipulate.
