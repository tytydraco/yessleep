  

Yes, I understand that the title sounds absolutely absurd. 

You are probably wondering how such a monumental thing is possible? How could *everything* have come into existence just the other day when you clearly remember events that had taken place years ago.

And then, you are probably wondering how such a groundbreaking statement has not been echoed throughout the science world. Surely, if what I’m saying is true, Other more learned and academic minds would be able to verify this claim. 

You are probably rolling your eyes thinking, “Here we go, another creepy pasta expressing some guy’s weird imagination.”

How I wish that is the case….

There is no lie in what I am about to tell you. Yet, whilst I am well attuned to what is happening, I am still clueless as to how *I* seem to be the only person who is able to live through the countless universal changes. Yes, you heard correctly. This is an ongoing phenomenon. This universe began last Wednesday, after the previous one that began the Tuesday before had ended. As far as I’m aware this has been happening since the year 2020. 

I have some strange ability to live through these changes, and I really wish I could tell you what that was. The purpose of this post is to try and reach out to others like me, before its too late...

As I said, I am still trying to work out what is happening. I have my theories but ill save them for the end. What I will tell you are these few things: I know WHAT is responsible for the changes, and HOW they are able to do it; Their method truly terrifying and completely unexpected….

I’ll begin when I first experienced one of these changes., back in 2020. I believe my experience will paint a suitable enough picture for you to get your head around it all. 

So it all began in the summer of 2020. *My* 2020. Covid was non existent back then…it never happened.

I lived and worked on my parents market garden that was situated a few km’s outside of the city of Mitten. The previous evening, I had completed my usual Friday delivery of fruits to the Rockhampton Markets. My usual routine for the weekend would see me drive to Mitten after the delivery had been made, parking the truck in a outer suburbs truck stop, and spend the rest of the weekend with my girlfriend, Sophia.

Sophia…. Mentioning her name is like shoving a knife into my own heart. Even after all this time I can never forget her. I refuse to.

Anyway, it was on this particular Saturday morning as I drove to the Mitten truck stop, where I experienced the first hints of my first Universal change. 

The Highway that led into Mitten was 100km/h. I had driven it so many times that my knowledge of its constant speed limit was second nature to me. Not that I ever sped anyway. I was quite proud of my flawless driving record, intending to keep it that way. 

So it came as a VERY nasty surprise when a Highway Patrol officer, hiding behind some shrubs on the side of the road, decided to follow me with its lights and sirens blaring as I drove past. The spot where he came from was a well known hiding place for police, so it wasn’t like I did not expect him to come out of there. I just didn’t understand why he was targeting me?

Confused, I pulled over and awaited as he walked towards my truck with a spring to his step.

“Good afternoon mate” The officer began, “You in a hurry, are you?”

“No sir, I thought I was going the speed limit” I replied, with pure honesty.

The officer gasped, clearly believing that I was giving him cheek. “Well Fuck me! How did you pass your license test if you are so blind?” 

Flustered, I stammered my response, which the Officer finished for me. “……. I’m a stupid Truckie who thinks he is above the rules. If you didn’t see the 80 sign, which mind you – it stands out like a kangaroo in front of Headlights- you are clearly blind. To be fair, I just think you’re a reckless prick!”

“I honestly didn’t know” I protested. You could imagine my surprise at his statement. *80km/h?*

“Well you will now Buddy!” The officer snapped, “20km over the speed limit is going to bite you in the ass. You’ll sure as hell pay better attention to the speed limit next time, that is, unless you don’t mind donating your hard-earned dollars to the revenue office”

Trying to make sense of the situation I accepted that the speed limit must have been dropped over the week. This only made me angry, as it absolutely made no sense to drop it in the first place! It was an open road for goodness sake!

“It shouldn’t even be 80 in the first place. So fucking dumb” I said. 

“Oh shit yeah!” The officer exclaimed with exaggerated agreement, “but I’m just a dumb cop. I don’t make up the rules. My job is to enforce them”, he held out his hand “License please”

I hesitantly fumbled for my Phone wallet, which just so happened to be open mid text to Sophia.

The officer noticed the phone screen like a child watching their parents open a pack of chocolates..

“Oh is that a message you didn’t get to finish?”, he began to chuckle to himself, “You’ve fucked up today”

I sighed as I handed my license to the officer. He was right, I did fuck up. There was no way around this, better to just cop the penalty and move on. It was a shame that after six years, I would have such an annoying stain on my driving record.

I watched as the Officer returned to his car and did his checks. Not even a minute later, he began to approach again, this time with a huge smile on his face. Something about his demeanor was not making me very comfortable. Returning to my window, the officer held my license card between his thumb and index finger and snapped it in half right in front of me!

“Won’t be needing this anymore” he mocked.

I was incredulous. Surely the Officer made a mistake.

“I was only going 20K’s over” I argued, determined to make my point. “It’s not double demerits this weekend, and last I heard, the maximum penalty for twenty over was six hundred bucks and four demerit points.” 

The officer shook his head as he chuckled, “I don’t have time for smart asses mate. I need you to step get out of the truck and come with me to the station please”

“You can’t suspend my license just like that!” I snapped. “I have never had a single fine in my life!”

The officer leaned forward, all look of jest suddenly replaced by cold ire. “I have checked your driving record and saw just how fucked it is. I HAVE seen that your license is currently suspended. I HAVE caught you driving whilst that suspension was still enforced. You WILL NOT be resuming what you were doing. YOU ARE under arrest and YOU WILL be accompanying me to the station for mandatory drug and alcohol testing. YOU WILL be issued with a minimum three thousand dollar fine, and your suspension will be extended”

I argued and argued, and nothing would budge him. As frustrated as I was with what felt at the time like an unjust treatment, I surrendered to the Officer and accompanied him back to the station, intending to press home my own complaints for his unfair treatment. I was convinced that he was doing the typical copper Authority “flex”.

When we arrived, he led me inside where we were greeted by the receptionist. I had never seen this woman before, so when we locked eyes and she exclaimed my name as fleetingly as an old friend, I was startled.

“What are you doing here?” she said in clear disbelief. 

I didn’t understand, nor care who she was, at this point all I wanted was to get this ordeal over and done with so that I could resume my usual routine. 

The Officer told her that I was caught speeding without a license, and her eyes lit up in shock

“Is everything ok? What has your piece of shit Dad done to you?” 

I narrowed my eyes at the jibe directed at my father. Who was she to call him such a name? I loved my father, and he the same to me. He would never do anything ill towards me.

Anyway, without getting carried away with the details of my ordeal at the station, I will summarize it with what I learned:

· I had lost my license five months ago for going 50km/hr. over.

· My father was supposedly an abusive Homophobic cunt.

· I was Gay.

· I had been going out with the receptionist’s brother, Billy, for five years.

You can imagine how confused I was. Everything about these conclusions defied absolutely everything that had been core to my identity. I prided myself for my clean record, My father was the greatest man I knew, I was as straight as a ruler and I was happily in love with my girlfriend, Sophia.

I was convinced that there had to be another Carl Tanner within the Metropolitan of Mitten, but when they had relayed my address correctly, a cold chill enveloped me. Something was clearly amiss.

By the time I got out of there, it was close to dark. I was absolutely furious that I had wasted the entire day at the station. 

With my license now suspended, I reached for my phone to call Sophia to let her know what happened and to see If she could pick me up. I thought she would find the whole situation quite amusing.

Opening my phone, I wasn’t surprised that there were over fifty missed calls on display. I knew Sophia would be worried sick with my lack of contact throughout the day. But when I read who the calls were from, my heart skipped a beat. 

*Billy <3*

Even as I began to process the information, Billy was trying to call me again. I declined it as fast as a striking adder, and hurried to my contacts to dial Sophia. To my frustration, her number was not saved where I usually had it. Luckily I new it off by heart anyway, so I typed it in and called her.

Words can not describe the sinking feeling in my chest when the provider answered, stating that the number did not exist. Frantically, I redialed just to make sure I got the right number, but the same result. 

It made no sense whatsoever! I had literally spoken to her the previous day as I drove to Rockhampton. That was before we video chatted on Facebook messenger whilst I slept in the truck. 

Instinctively, I opened up the app and searched for her name, and nothing showed up. I looked up her name on Facebook, Instagram, and still no accounts were found. Snapchat was my last resort, and when I saw that Billy was my BEST FRIEND, in her place, I threw my phone. 

The logical part of my mind suggested that she must have decided to break up and block me on all platforms. Ghosting me. That thought made me depressed. Why would she? We literally had phone sex the previous night, and had stayed up talking for hours after.

Without wasting anymore time, I called an Uber and went to her house. 

Sophia lived in a prestigious estate on the outskirts of Mitten renown for it’s award winning gardens, her parent’s own having gained much of them. So you can imagine the shock that gripped me when I arrived at a house surrounded by Gardens overgrown with weeds and Thirsty plants. Everything about the house was similar enough to how I remembered it, but the change in the Garden stood out like Dog’s balls.

By this time it was close to 8pm, and I knew that the Trask’s would be eagerly awaiting me, if they truly were worried. Despite this, not a single light shone within the house, indicating that they did not even care.

Still, I needed an explanation to this sudden dismissal, so I stormed to the door and belted on it with my pent up frustration. A light flicked on in the hallway and I waited patiently as a figure came to the door and fumbled their keys against three separate locks, before lifting the deadbolt.

Opening the door, wearing a flimsy night gown, was not Sophia. Nor was it her Mum or Sister. This was a complete stranger.

“Can I help you?” she asked, studying me with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion.

I felt so awkward for intruding on this stranger’s sleep, but had to force myself to remember that this was Sophia’s families house, not this imposter!

I attempted to brush past her to get a better look inside, only to be pushed aside by an unexpected strength in this little woman. 

“Who are you?” she pressed. “You need to leave now!”

Ignoring her, I tried pushing past her again, this time when she grabbed my arm, I threw her against the wall, a little harder than I intended. 

“Steve!, Help!” she cried out, and before I knew it, a heavily muscled and tattooed man stormed down the stairs and confronted me on the front porch. He had death within his eyes, the same look that any husband would have when they defended their wife’s attacker.

I pleaded with him that this was the Trask house, demanding to know what they did to Sophia and her family. The man argued that he had been living here for over twenty years, and he has never heard of anyone by the name of Trask. I refused to believe it. I was literally here a week ago! It didn’t make sense. 

Despite the man’s clear strength over my own, I was not afraid to stand my ground. He charged into me, forcing me to fall backwards on top of some terracotta pot plants, causing them to shatter. He began laying blows into my face, and in my desperation I reached for the first thing my hands fell upon and slammed it into the mans neck. 

At once he seized his fury and recoiled off me, his expression one of surprise as he held the side of his neck where I had just hit him. To my horror, his hand was quickly smeared with a stream of blood coming from underneath, and within seconds he collapsed onto his back, a pool of blood beginning to form around his throat. 

The woman screamed her emotions as she threw herself over her husband, wailing terribly. 

I lifted my trembling hands to see what it was that I had struck the man with. I held onto a terracotta shard, its pointed tip stained crimson. I could not believe that I had just killed the man.

Lights flicked on in the neighboring properties, and before I knew it, people began to make their way to the source of the wailing. 

Knowing no good was to come if I remained, I hurried away from the murder scene, desperate to get as far as possible before a manhunt would surely be underway. 

My mind was screaming for an explanation, yet as much as I tried, there was nothing I could come up with. So far everything that I had known to be normal in my life, has changed completely. The WORLD had changed.

At this point I was still trying to process the change, and in obvious denial of it. I ended up travelling to my Friend’s apartment in the CBD of Mitten where I learned of two more changes: He didn’t know who I was, and the once lavish CBD that I had been familiar with had become a rundown, crime filled neighborhood.

I only had one other option left, and that was returning home to my parents. 

That was the most hardest of all the changes. The Police were right. My dad was a homophobic asshole and tried to bash me. Not that I ever remember him being thus. My mum was a silent terrified wife, and I WAS Gay; The photo’s of the muscular Billy holding me in his arms, a memory I never had, the clearest of evidence.

So that was my situation when I first realized that the entire world that I had once known had drastically changed overnight. Despite knowing my way around the area, never in my life had I felt so lost. So Alone…

Eventually, I decided to give in to the phone calls coming from the only person in this new world that seemed to care about me. I had no intention on playing the part of Gay Carl as he must have been acquainted with, but I needed someone to talk to about what I was experiencing. Someone who cared enough to hopefully listen.

Billy was furious when he eventually picked me up, demanding answers for my avoidance of his calls. I acted like I wasn’t in the mood to talk and bade him to just take me back to his place where I would tell him everything then.

After pushing back many advances from Billy, a distraught and overly affectionate lover, I lost my patience and told him everything straight. How everything in MY life seemed to change overnight, being replaced with that which was central to a GAY version of myself.

You can imagine just how hard it was trying to explain this to someone who had not experienced any change at all. For ages, I was convinced that he would think I was mad. For all I knew at the time, maybe I was!

As I detailed the events of my story, leading up to the moment I last remember normality, Billy contradicted my own Memories with a different version of those same events.

Apparently on Friday night, I was not taking a delivery of fruit to the Rockhampton markets. I had stolen my Father’s truck and decided to drive it to Rockhampton, ignorant of my suspended license, to get away from my Father who was trying to hurt me. I had called Billy in hysterics with what I had done, and asked if he could pick me up from the Truck stop I was staying in at Rockhampton, in the morning. By the time he had arrived, I was gone and had not bothered to tell him where I went, leaving him worried sick.

Of course, it was all Bullshit to me, but I couldn’t help ignoring the connection. Both myself, and my Gay counterpart, were in the exact same location when everything changed. It was as though my thoughts, memories and personality had somehow transferred into this other version of me.

Logic was thrown out the window. Little did I know that I would become all too familiar with this strange phenomenon going forward….

Billy was still hesitant to believe anything I said, but his affection to me was enough to ensure that I would not be brought to justice for my crimes. By this point I was wanted throughout Mitten for Murder. By the time the police showed up at Billy’s door I was long gone.

Settling in the lawless former CBD of Mitten, I decided to reside here until the heat of my manhunt cooled down. 

This is what led to one of the most mind bending, and heartbreaking discoveries, that even now, I am crying as I write. 

Whilst I roamed about the derelict streets, I noticed a familiar license plate upon a familiar vintage car. It didn’t take me long to realize that this belonged to Sophia’s uncle! What he was doing outside the dingy establishment was beyond me, and I didn’t care as I approached him, my heart leaping for joy that I had found some connection to my Girl.

Victor, like everyone else before the change, had no idea who I was. Skipping past that, I enquired straight away to the health of his niece, Sophia. I was surprised when I was met with a sharp response. Victor glared at me as though I had just stabbed him in the chest. 

“She has been in the same place for twenty years. Mitten Memorial park”

I felt my soul depart from my body when I heard that. It made no sense, yet after everything I had seen so far, it did.

Denial gripped me, and the following evening I searched through every grave in the cemetery, studying each name on every plaque, until I found the names I did not wish to see. Sophia, and her parents all shared a grave, their deaths occurring on the same day, 7th Feb. 2000.

I was beside myself. 

Refusing to believe it even still, I did the unthinkable. I broke into the Cemeteries janitors shed, retrieved a shovel, and began to exhume the grave of my beloved. Digging holes is no simple feat, especially dirt that has been settled for twenty years, but that evening my purpose far outweighed my fatigue. 

I reached the tiny coffin that lay above the two adult sized ones, and when I opened it, I was met by a tiny skeleton. Surely it was no MY Sophia. The moon reflected off a pendant that hung at the skeleton’s neck, upon studying it, the confirmation of my worst fears were made.

The Sophia that I knew, used to wear the exact same pendant. It had been a cherished gift from her grandparents given to her at her baptism. It seemed even as a two year old she wouldn’t part with it.

So from here, you could imagine just how furious and distraught I was with everything. I needed answers. 

Sasha, Billy’s police receptionist sister, helped in getting information relating to Sophia and her families deaths. Apparently, they died during a wedding ceremony, alongside the bride and groom, as well as the entire congregation gathered to watch.

It remained unsolved, no one knowing how on earth the murders had been committed. It’s memory was a great stain in the history of Mitten, memorial services were held annually to remember the two hundred that had been killed.

There was something that disturbed me about this, and with little else to do in a world where I did not belong, I decided to investigate. 

I visited the church where the deaths had taken place and managed to speak with the parish priest, who just so happened to be the first one to discover the horrific crime scene. 

I asked him if there was anything odd that might suggest what could have done such a thing? He told me that nothing about the deaths made sense. The congregation - Sophia included - all appeared to have suffocated, whilst the bride and groom had both been decapitated; Forensic analysts later describing the severs as akin to a cut from scissors.

The priest could sense how passionate I was to learn about this crime, and decided to show me something that all the investigators dismissed, but he was adamant had occurred AFTER the crimes. 

He led me to the Alter of the church, where behind it was a large and beautifully decorated stain glass window, extending from the ceiling to the floor. At its base, directly in the middle was a cabinet which held the tabernacle. We moved it out of the way to reveal the portion of the stain glassed window that had been covered.

In stark contrast to the bright and vibrant images of Angels and Saints displayed up high, a dark and foreboding image about the size of my hand was imprinted onto the glass. 

It was the silhouette of an Earwig. You know, the tiny bugs that look like they have a head on either side of their bodies, one end with sharp claw like horns?

If it wasn’t for the randomness of the image, I would have been certain it was a part of the stained glass. But the priest insisted that he knew every single inch of this window, and that the Earwig image Silhouette only appeared AFTER the crime had been committed.

Something about that image screamed at me. Knowing that it was connected to Sophia’s death, which in turn was connected to the change, I felt obliged to take the shard of glass with the image for my own possession.

The following evening, I returned to the church, making my way to the rear of the stained glass window. Hidden by garden hedges, the Earwig silhouette was easily visible, occupying one pane of glass. Slowly, and carefully, I chipped along the outside of the pane, in order to snap it away from the frame that held it in its designated place. 

Once I retrieved it, I made my way straight back to Billy’s house, excited at the prospect that I might be a step closer to understanding everything.

Upon showing him the image on the piece of stained glass however, something completely unexpected and terrifying happened.

Billy walked as though he was possessed towards a photo that hung on the wall, and began to stare at it fixedly.

Even as I watched him in statement, I heard what sounded like heavy rain drops gradually getting closer. It was like the rain was coming from inside the apartment. But it was not rain.

It was a swarm of Earwigs!

They stormed in from under the gap in the door, and in my repulsion I launched myself onto a table to get as far from them as possible. I watched in horror as the Earwigs began to make their way to where Billy fixedly stood looking dumbly at the photo on the wall. It was of a young boy dressed in colored sporting clothes and a much older woman.

I beckoned for him to snap out of his stance, but he would not budge. Surprisingly, the Earwigs did not attack Billy, instead circled around him. 

Looking down from the table I was horrified to see that the entire flat was filled with these bugs. They crawled on top of each other, and I shuddered at the thought of what it would be like to fall onto them and be eaten alive.

Then, the Earwigs started doing something very bizarre. All of them, regardless of shape and size, raised their rear pincers in unison, pointing them towards Billy and the Photo.

I tried having a closer look from the safety of the dining table, at what he was actually looking at. 

From what I could see, the photo was at a sporting carnival. I could make out the tracks of a running athletic field, even a grandstand could be seen in the background where crowds of people, dressed in green, blue and orange sat.

But there was something very out of place.

Behind the boy and the old woman, lurking ominously in the background, was a strange looking creature.

I had seen this photo before when I was here, and never noticed such a strange looking figure in the background. To make matters more eerie, every time I blinked, the black creature somehow appeared closer to the two people at the focus.

Billy began to reminisce the memory of when the Photo had been taken. What he said, chilled me to my core.

“I miss my grandmother”, he began, “I cant believe how brutal it all was. We were only children! It was a fucking sports carnival for God’s sake! Grandma promised me that she would watch me run the 800meter track that year, and when I saw her I was so happy that I wanted to take a photo with her. But they came. Those things. The teachers….it turned them into like a blue jerky. And then Grandma”, Billy was now crying. “It crushed her into a ball of meat and blood.”

I held my breath. My heart raced a thousand miles an hour. The woman in the photo had disappeared, and in her place, stood the strange creature. 

What it was, I could not describe, nor can I even now. I call them Ghouls, but what they truly are, I am yet to discover. All I know is that it is these creatures that have been responsible for the countless changes I have been experiencing since. 

Their heads somewhat resembled the pincers of the Earwigs. Two tiny white eyes stared blankly and menacing from either one. They do not seem to have legs, though from my experiences I have never really been able to see anything below what we would deem as chest height. 

Photographs don’t usually tend to emphasize people’s feet do they..

Billy continued as he began to weep like a scared little boy “It came to me, and I didn’t know what to do. I just saw Grandma die and everyone around me was dying. I froze.”

There was a brief pause, as Billy stammered the next words “It stood over me, and then I felt its head. It’s horns. It’s pincers! They grabbed me by the throat” 

An ear-piercing shriek came out of Billy’s voice box, making my stomach churn. The next few words were spoken in a voice that sounded like a crackling old hag. It was so guttural and so distorted, that I could barely make out what he was saying “THHHEYYY cloooseed on my neck. It riepped off my head. I Felt mnyu heeafd faawl to thee flooorr and I looked up tol see my bediy and thehehe thing standing over emeeme……”

As Billy finished this sentence, I was not sure if I had just blinked or if I had just woken from a dream.

In a literal instant, Billy vanished. The Earwigs vanished. The orientation of the flat changed. I was no longer standing on a table, rather a bed. The white walls were now red and the bright light had suddenly reduced to a dull orange glow.

“Are you ready baby?” came a voice that I had never heard before. Turning in its direction I was startled to see an Asian woman standing in black lingerie holding a condom packet in her hand.

I looked down at himself, and noticed that I too was suddenly butt naked. 

“Billy!” I shouted as I jumped off the bed, carefully making sure that there were no Earwigs all over the floor. I ran to the wall, to the very position where Billy had only been standing mere seconds ago. There was absolutely no trace of any photo where it should have been.

I banged on the wall furiously, trying to work out what the hell was happening. I turned back to the lady

“Where the fuck is he!” Carl shouted at her

“Who!?” the lady replied, “You want sex or no?”

I was filled with an undeniable fear, but in those brief moments I was given the right mind to analyze my surroundings. I noticed images of naked women on the walls, a shanty bed, a packet of condoms, and the way the Lady was suggestively dressed.

Making my way to the door, instead of walking out into the hallway of Billy’s unit block, I walked into a similarly lit up hallway where more scantily clad women chirped amongst each other at the doorways to different apartments. They laughed as they looked down at my exposed manhood.

Within seconds I went from being within Billy’s residential apartment, to a Brothel.

“You no want sex?” The lady called out after me. “I don’t want your filthy clothes!” she tossed a heap of clothing towards me and slammed the door that should have been the entrance to Billy’s flat shut. 

I picked up the fluorescent shirt, and the blue denim shorts – clothes that were a strangers,. not the ones i had just been wearing with Billy. Regardless of whose they were, I threw them on and stormed out of the unit block, confusion running rampant in MY mind. 

It was then that I realized. The world had changed. In one moment I was in one place, the next I was in another. Unlike the first time this happened, ignorant to the drastic change through sleep, I had experienced this change first hand.

The shard of glass with the earwig Silhouette seemed to have vanished out of my hand through the change as well. I was convinced that it had something to do with the sudden appearance of those dreadful earwigs. 

At the time, I had no idea how it was all connected, and it would take me a lot of investigating and living through countless changes before I would ever be able to understand the mechanics of it. To save you time, for it is a damned LOONG story, I will sum up the conclusions I have made.

There are four elements needed to make a change possible:

· An earwig silhouette mark.

· A photograph, or video taken AFTER the last change, within the vicinity of the silhouette mark.

· Hordes of Earwigs

· Ghouls.

After very change, there will always be a mark left somewhere at the sight of the incident. Much like the church massacre that had caused the first change had a smudge on the stained glass, the sports carnival massacre that Billy witnessed had a stain on one of the seats of the grandstand.

This mark is essential for bringing about further changes and is the first stage in the cycle. 

The next stage is wholly reliant on a photograph or video, literally of anything. The only exception I have noted is that the media has to have taken place AFTER the date from which the last change took place; meaning for example, that photos preceding the date of the sports carnival massacre will not bring upon the next stage.

Why this is the case I have no idea, but I have my theories which I will mention shortly.

So, as soon as the mark manages to come within direct line of sight of a suitable piece of media, it will begin the next stage. The timing of this can sometimes be instantaneous, depending on the Mark’s exposure to Photos and videos.

This third stage brings upon the Hordes of Earwigs. They will swarm towards the place where the current photo has made a connection with the Mark. From here, they will turn their pincers towards the photo of interest, wobbling in a circular motion like they are sending some strange signal to the Photo.

In response to their motions, a Ghoul (sometimes multiple) will spawn into the photograph or video. At first, they will stand ominously in the background, but if one was to blink, they would see the ghoul move different locations. 

This is the terrifying part. For in these moments that precede an imminent change, a horrible massacre will take place. Any living thing that is present in the photograph or video, will be horrifically killed. Usually the focus subjects of the photo or video will be decapitated by the Ghouls pincer like head, whilst those in the background are seemingly suffocated. 

Video’s are particularly disturbing, as one can see every little detail of the massacre where photos only show the up to date image upon blinking.

If someone who is in the Photo/Video, is also present as the Earwigs horde is doing its thing, they will behave in a way similar to how Billy did. They will lose all sense of proper judgment, and despite the threat of the earwigs hanging around them, they will begin to recite the memory of the photo. But instead of detailing the happy memory which it once was, they will go into vivid detail of the massacre.

It is then, when the focus character of the photo, or every living thing in the image is killed, that a change will occur.

Now, a change will only occur FROM the events of the date of the Photograph/Video that was used by the Ghouls. So up to that point in time, History remains the same. Its just from that point on where the butterfly effect of change spreads. Obviously, the closer the date from when the change took place is to the present, the less drastic the change will be for me; time has not passed long enough to see great alterations.

The crazy thing about it all, is that the present timeline keeps ticking normally for me. 

So say that a change DOES take place on Monday the 27th of February at 2pm; the trigger being a Photograph taken in 2015 (the Ghouls can no longer travel through photos preceding this date). I will spawn into a new universe instantly after the former one ends, the present being based on the 8 years of history since 2015. The time will tick to 2.01pm and life will seem to just be continuing normally, oblivious to the fact that such a drastic shift of vents had taken place. 

I know, it’s a lot to get your head around and I’m starting to doubt the point in even posting this onto reddit considering that all of you will likely no longer exist by the time you consider the ramifications.

From my experiences, I am yet to meet someone who has lived through the changes as I have. To be honest, it is starting to trouble me now and is the whole reason why I have decided to post this onto reddit, in the hopes of finding someone else like me.

For I have a bad feeling about the Ghouls. 

My theory as to why they do not travel through photo’s preceding the last one they went through, is because they live in the past. 

I believe they are trying to make their way to the present. Gradually, they are getting closer and closer. When I first experienced a change, there had been a twenty year gap! Now there is only 8! I have been working non stop in trying to discover the location of the last massacre and change before a new change can take place. If I can cover the mark and keep it away from Photos or videos ill do so, but it is proving to be a much harder task with the accessibility we now have to such media.

A photo is almost everywhere you look, whether it be an advertisement, a photograph, a picture on a phone, they are literally everywhere!

And I tell you now, all it will take is for an unlucky recently taken photo to fall into the vicinity of the Mark for the Ghouls to get even closer to the present.

At the moment, the last change was centered around a photo that had been taken of the Colosseum in Rome. Considering it is a tourist hotspot, it won’t be long until a photo crosses the vicinity of the Mark, wherever it might be on those ruins. This is the scariest part for me.

I write this post now as I wait to board the plane from Sydney to Rome. If I cannot get to Rome on time, I will not know where the next change will take place from. I must find that Mark as soon as possible.

Based off my experiences of the Ghouls so far, I honestly dread what they might do when they reach the present. It terrifies me to my core.

The only way I can assure you that the change has not occurred yet, is If you still see this post on reddit. For whenever the next change takes place, this post will be lost forever. 

Share it around and try to get as many people to view it as possible. If there are others out there that share my strange ability I really wish for them to be aware that they are not alone.

I need to bring us all together if we are to stop these Ghoul’s from entering the present. 

I need all the help I can possibly get to find this damned Mark in the colosseum before it crosses paths with a photograph. If you can head there and begin the search for me, it will be greatly appreciated.

Remember, the Mark is no bigger than a human hand, and looks like a silhouette of an Earwig.

Spread the word!
