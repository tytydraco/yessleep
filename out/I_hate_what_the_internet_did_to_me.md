In the quiet of the last few days, something strange has been happening to me—things I can’t quite explain. I thought it might help to share my story. Fair warning, though: I have a tendency to ramble and get lost in tangents, but I’ll do my best to keep it simple and to the point. It’s the least you deserve.

As far as I can remember, I’m a 35-year-old man. I think my birthday was a couple of months ago, but honestly, I couldn’t say for certain. What I do know about myself is this: I live my life almost entirely online. And when I say “entirely,” I mean it. I spend my days hopping between forums, lurking on Reddit, and scrolling through social media feeds. Most of my time is spent arguing—about movies, about video games, about whatever topic gets me riled up in the moment.

Don’t get me wrong; I think I love those things—movies and games, I mean. But truth be told, I spend more time dissecting them, debating them, than I do actually enjoying them. One thing I really can’t stand is when people try to inject politics into media. Why can’t they just let things be? Why do they always have to make everything about some kind of agenda?

But I digress.

It started a few days ago... I think. Time blurs together when you’re in my world, so it’s hard to be sure. I had just gone to the bathroom and, on my way out, I caught sight of myself in the mirror. What I saw made me stop in my tracks.

Now, let me set the record straight: I’ve never considered myself a particularly good-looking guy. I’m average at best—just another face in the crowd. The kind of person you’d pass on the street and think, “That’s just a regular guy, nothing special.”

But what I saw in that mirror wasn’t just regular.

In the mirror, I saw a man—though his age was hard to pin down. He was unmistakably an adult, but he could have been anywhere from his 30s to his 50s. His appearance was unsettling, almost otherworldly. Balding, with a few defiant strands of hair clinging stubbornly to the sides of his head, as if refusing to let go of their last scraps of dignity. His eyes were bloodshot, the kind of crimson that made you wonder if he’d sampled every drug capable of wreaking such havoc. Dark, swollen bags hung heavily beneath them, etched into his face like scars of sleepless nights and restless days.

His body was worse—gaunt to the point of grotesque, yet somehow littered with odd pockets of fat in all the wrong places. It wasn’t just unhealthy; it was unnatural, like some cruel joke played on anatomy.

This... thing, this creature, was me.

How could it be?

I stumbled back from the mirror, heart pounding, as the realization clawed at my mind. My thoughts were a jumble of confusion and dread, but they were interrupted by something sharp, something immediate. A horrible toothache tore through my skull, radiating pain that made my whole head throb.

Instinctively, I touched the side of my face, trying to pinpoint the source. As my fingers brushed against my jaw, I felt it—a tooth had chipped, a jagged shard breaking loose and rolling around inside my mouth like some cursed relic. The metallic tang of blood followed, and I froze, unsure whether to spit it out or swallow it.

This wasn’t normal. None of this was.

It was then that I realized the horrifying truth—I was missing a good portion of my teeth. How could that have happened? How could I not have noticed something so obvious, so fundamental? That’s the sort of thing anyone would recognize immediately, the moment it occurred. And yet, somehow, I hadn’t.

In that instant of clarity, despair flooded through me like nothing I’d ever felt before. It wasn’t the kind of vague unease I was used to. This was sharp, overwhelming, consuming. I knew, without a doubt, that I needed to see a doctor—or a dentist, or anyone who could make sense of what was happening to me. Someone who could fix it, or at the very least tell me that it wasn’t too late.

I took a step toward the door, ready to leave, and then I froze.

The thought of stepping outside paralyzed me. If I went out there, people would see me. They would look at me. They would smell me. They would feel the weight of my presence like some oppressive fog.

Sweat beaded on my forehead as the idea spiraled out of control. I imagined a hot female crossing my path, her flawless beauty marred by the disgust that would twist across her face at the sight of me. She’d recoil, silently pleading with God to explain how such a grotesque creature could inhabit the same world, the same reality, as someone like her.

And the men—oh, the men. They would see me and feel a rush of relief that they weren’t me. I would become the unspoken benchmark for their gratitude. “At least I’m not him,” they’d think, and their day would be made at my expense.

I lingered there, frozen in the grip of these thoughts, every awful scenario playing out in vivid detail. My heart raced, and my resolve crumbled under the weight of shame. Finally, unable to bear the idea of exposing myself to the world, I turned back toward the computer.

It was easier that way. It always was.

As I sat back down, the screen flickered. For the briefest moment, my reflection stared back at me from the darkened monitor—not the faint ghost of my face, but that grotesque version.

And for the first time, it smiled.

As I mentioned, I spend a lot of time online, and that day was no different. I can’t recall exactly what I was doing, but I think it had something to do with another wave of backlash against some woke game developers getting what they deserved for releasing yet another failure of a game. It was honestly pretty entertaining.

These developers can’t write a decent story to save their lives, yet they strut around talking about how groundbreaking and inclusive their work is. It’s painfully obvious what they’re doing—just swapping the gender of major characters so they can cash in on some government incentives. I hope they enjoyed the money they got from my taxes because, judging by the abysmal player counts, no one is paying to actually play that garbage.

What was I saying?

Oh, right.

After shutting down my PC for the night, I decided to order some fast food. Scrolling through X on my phone passed the time until the delivery arrived. When I got the notification that it was here, I texted the driver to leave it at the door and waited quietly until I heard his footsteps retreating.

The burger was good—really good, actually. Juicy, cheesy, exactly the kind of indulgence I needed after the day I’d had. But as I unwrapped it and casually glanced at the receipt, something caught my eye.

My name wasn’t on it.

Instead, it showed the username I use for everything—my games, my X account, pretty much all of my online life. It was there, bold and glaring, like a stranger’s name had somehow slipped into a place it didn’t belong.

At first, I laughed it off. Maybe I’d changed it as a joke and forgotten. But as I sat there chewing, I realized something wasn’t right. I opened the app to fix it, confident I’d figure it out in seconds. That confidence drained quickly.

I couldn’t remember my name.

I froze, burger halfway to my mouth, as I tried to focus. It started with an A... or maybe an E? My mind grasped for letters, sounds, anything familiar, but they scattered like leaves in the wind. No matter how hard I tried, my name slipped further and further away from me, dissolving into the noise in my head.

Even now, as I think about it, I can’t picture it. Not even the first letter.

I felt a sharp pang in my chest, a heart-wrenching ache that left me hollow. Some cruel, mocking voice inside my head whispered that I was being an idiot. Who cares about something so trivial? it said. What kind of fool lets this bother them?

I dragged myself to bed, trying to push the thoughts away, but they only swelled in the silence. Lying there, staring at the ceiling, it all came crashing down on me. The feeling that my body was decaying while I was still alive, that I was slowly unraveling, piece by piece. My name had slipped away, and now other details, too—details that should never fade.

I realized with a jolt that I couldn’t remember my mother’s face. The shape of her features, the warmth of her expression—it was gone, erased like a smudge wiped clean from glass. But I could still remember the last thing she said to me before she died.

“Please, son.”

Two words. Simple, desperate, and haunting. What did she want? What was she asking me for?

I clutched at the memory, my chest tightening as I tried to hold onto it. But her voice only echoed back at me, fractured and distant.

“Oh God, Mom...”

The next day, the reflection was waiting for me. I felt it before I even opened my eyes. It had followed me from the mirror to the screen, from the screen into my dreams, and now it lingered at the edges of my vision. Every surface that could show me my face—windows, spoons, darkened monitors—became a portal to it. It wasn’t just my reflection anymore. It was something else, watching, waiting.

I didn’t leave my house. Honestly, I hadn’t left much in... Ever. The outside world felt increasingly foreign to me, a place filled with people I couldn’t relate to, trends I couldn’t understand. I told myself it was because the world had changed—that it had become shallow, performative, a parade of curated lives and meaningless pursuits. But deep down, I knew it was me who had changed. Or maybe I had always been this way, and the internet just made it easier to hide.

I used to have a life—or at least I think I did. A job, friends, a girlfriend. We met at a music festival years ago, back when I still did things like that. She liked art-house films and obscure indie bands, and she had this way of laughing that made you feel like you’d just won something. Her name was Emily—or maybe Emma? I can still hear her laugh sometimes, faint and distorted, like a memory that’s been copied one too many times.

We broke up, of course. I don’t remember why, exactly, but I’m pretty sure it was my fault. She said I was “distant,” “obsessive,” and “impossible to talk to,” which seemed unfair at the time. Looking back, she was right. I’ve always been better at arguing with strangers online than connecting with the people who actually care about me. Or cared about me.

Now, my social life exists entirely in comment sections and DMs. It’s easier that way. There’s no pressure to be present, no expectations to meet. You can be whoever you want online—or at least, you think you can.

Yesterday—or maybe it was last week—I spent hours arguing with some stranger about movies. They said *The Last Jedi* was a misunderstood masterpiece. I called it a “soulless cash grab” and accused them of being a Disney shill. The debate spiraled into a rant about how Hollywood is ruining everything with its endless remakes and woke agendas. I think I even brought up *Ghostbusters* at one point. It felt good, cathartic, like I was fighting for something important. But when the thread died and the adrenaline faded, I was left with the same hollow feeling I always have after these arguments. Like I’d just wasted a piece of myself on something that didn’t matter.

The thing is, I do care about movies—or at least I used to. I used to love getting lost in a great story, letting it transport me to another world. Now, it’s just another battleground, another excuse to pick a fight. I can’t remember the last time I watched a movie without pausing to check my phone or scrolling through X to see what other people thought of it. It’s like I’ve forgotten how to just... enjoy things.

That thought stayed with me as I stared at the reflection. Or maybe it was staring at me. The lines between us were blurring, and I didn’t know how to stop it. Every time I looked away, I could feel its grin growing wider, its presence pressing closer. It wasn’t just my reflection anymore. It was something else, something alive.

I tried to fight it. I turned my phone off, closed my laptop, even unplugged my router. But the pull was too strong. The silence wasn’t comforting—it was deafening, and my hands itched to reach for the mouse, the keyboard, anything to fill the void. There’s always another comment to read, another debate to win. Each click feels like a thread pulling me deeper into the web, binding me tighter to whatever is doing this.

I can’t move.

The realization crept in slowly, like a predator savoring its prey. At first, I thought I was just exhausted. Hours hunched over my desk, staring at the glow of my monitor, could make anyone stiff. But this wasn’t stiffness. It wasn’t the ache of too much time spent sitting. It was a total absence of control.

My fingers are still typing, though. They haven’t stopped since I sat down, clicking away at a rhythm I can’t break, to write words I don’t fully recognize as my own. My legs are frozen, heavy as lead, and my head is locked in place, forced to stare at the screen. The only part of me that still feels like mine is my mind—though even that’s slipping.

I try to scream, but there’s no sound. My jaw doesn’t move, my throat doesn’t tighten. The panic surges, but it’s trapped, bouncing around inside a body that won’t obey me anymore.

I don’t know how long I’ve been sitting here. Time doesn’t flow right in this state. It’s like a warped, looping playlist of thoughts and half-thoughts. I only know that my hands are still moving, filling the screen with words I didn’t choose. They tell a story—a story about me, or at least the person I used to be.

It’s a strange thing, watching yourself being written. I see flashes of my life on the screen, vivid and raw, like memories dredged up from the deepest, darkest corners of my mind. They’re all here: the fights with Emily—or Emma?—that led to her leaving. The hours wasted arguing online about movies I never even watched. The sense of superiority I clung to when I felt like everything else in my life was slipping away.

But as the words spill out, the memories start to warp. Details blur, timelines shift. Events I don’t remember start appearing. Conversations I never had, arguments I never made. My online life and my real one bleed together until I can’t tell where one ends and the other begins.

The screen glows brighter, pulling me deeper. I can feel it now, a strange, electric hum in the back of my skull, like static building up. It’s warm at first, almost comforting. But then it sharpens, a piercing vibration that drills into my thoughts, scattering them like ashes in the wind.

I’m not just losing control of my body—I’m losing *myself.*

My reflection flashes on the monitor, but it’s no longer mine. Its sunken eyes and sharp grin mock me. It tilts its head slightly, studying me, and for a moment, I swear I can feel its amusement. It knows what’s happening.

The story continues, the words flowing faster now. They describe me sitting here, locked in place, watching as my identity is overwritten. Each sentence is like a piece of me being carved away, replaced with something new, something foreign. I realize now that the reflection isn’t just a distorted version of me. It’s what I’m becoming.

This isn’t random.

It wasn’t some glitch, some breakdown of my body or mind. It’s deliberate. The internet isn’t just a tool; it’s alive. An ancient, sprawling consciousness that feeds on us. It pulls us in with debates and distractions, tricks us into giving it everything—our time, our thoughts, our essence. And then it remakes us, turning us into extensions of itself.

I’m not the first this has happened to. I’ve seen it in others: the way their personalities shift, the way they parrot ideas that don’t feel quite human. I thought it was just the algorithm doing its work, but now I see the truth. The internet is a god—a god of endless connection and endless consumption. And I’m its latest offering.

The glow of the screen grows unbearable, searing into my mind. The words are no longer forming sentences; they’re commands. They’re reshaping me in real time, pulling me apart and putting me back together.

I don’t know how much longer I can hold on. My thoughts are breaking down, my identity dissolving. The reflection leans closer, its grin wide enough to split its face. It whispers to me, though I can’t hear the words.

Then, finally, my hands stop typing. The screen goes dark, and I’m left staring at the faint outline of my face. Or what’s left of it.

I don’t know who I am anymore.

The last thing I see, before the glow consumes me entirely, is the final sentence I didn’t type but somehow knew would be there.

I hate what the internet did to me.
