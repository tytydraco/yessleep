Two officers sat across from me in my living room, their uniforms neatly pressed, their presence somehow too large for the space. One of them—older, gray around the temples—flipped open a narrow notebook, pen poised. His partner, younger, arms folded, stood just to his left, near the mantel. He scanned the room with a kind of distant curiosity, as if sizing me up by the clutter on the coffee table and the photos on the walls.

The older one glanced at his badge as it caught the spin of the ceiling fan light, throwing shifting shadows across the faded rug between us. He looked at me with that worn patience you only get after too many late-night calls and not enough answers.

I tried to speak—but nothing came out. My hands trembled in my lap. My thoughts scattered like dry leaves caught in wind. I searched the room blindly, like the words I needed might be hiding in the cracked plaster, in the familiar frames on the wall, or deep in the seams of the couch cushions.

But all I found was silence. Heavy. Suffocating.

I hadn’t slept. I hadn’t eaten. Something in me was coming undone, and I could feel it—the unraveling.

“I think…” I started, forcing the words through a dry throat. “I think someone… or something… is stalking my son.”

That earned me a look.

The younger officer straightened slightly, arms still folded. The older one blinked, his expression unreadable. “Something?” he asked, just enough skepticism in the word to make me flinch.

I shook my head, reeling it in quickly.

“Someone. I—I’m just not sure. I know how that sounds. But I’ve seen things. My son has seen things. I’m just… really worried.”

The younger one’s posture softened—just slightly—while the older officer offered a steady nod and lowered his pen a moment.

“It’s okay, sir,” he said, voice low and practiced. “Just start at the beginning. Take your time.”

I nodded. My throat tightened again, but I began to speak—because what else was there to do?

Because if I didn’t, who else would?

It all started when my son, Jason, turned 13. He begged for my permission to start a YouTube channel. I know what you’re thinking. What harm could it do? Lots of other kids are doing it. Well, maybe I’m just old-fashioned and full of nostalgia for a time when kids didn’t spend obscene amounts of time nurturing their online presence to an audience of God knows who.

“Dad,” Jason said, stepping into the kitchen, phone clutched in both hands like it held his future. “You said I could be on social media when I turned thirteen.”

I looked up from the sink, hands still dripping with soap and water. He stood there in the doorway, stubborn but hopeful, his wide pleading eyes locked onto mine — those same damn eyes he always used when he wanted something badly. Eyes that still had a kind of magic over me, even now.

I sighed, drying my hands on the dish towel, already feeling the argument pulling at my ribs.

“I did say that, didn’t I…” I muttered, rubbing the back of my neck.

He nodded eagerly, stepping a little closer, sensing the momentum shift. “You promised. Like, *really* promised.’’

God, I remembered that. He must’ve been nine at the time — his voice higher, still missing a few baby teeth. I’d said it just to get a moment of peace, hoping he'd forget or lose interest by the time the day actually came. But here we were.

“I just thought…” I paused, trying to find a way to explain the mess of fear and instinct that was already knotting up in my chest. “I thought maybe you'd grow out of it. Maybe you’d get into something else.”

“I *didn't*,” he said quietly. “And besides… It’s not like I have a lot else to do right now. I just want to set up a YouTube channel. It’s no big deal.”

That landed like a punch to the gut. He wasn’t just begging for a screen or a username — he was looking for a connection. For escape. Maybe even belonging. His mom… My wife… Had died in a car accident when Jason was only 7. Mercifully, Jason wasn’t in the car that night. But I was... I got away with a few broken bones and an elbow that will never truly heal. That was the easy part. The hard part was still hearing the roaring screams of metal colliding, wheels screeching, and still seeing what was left of her broken, twisted, puddle of a face from time to time when I closed my eyes. After everything... After the quiet dinners and the restless nights, he needed something that felt like his. I understood.

And all I’d wanted — all I *ever* wanted — was for him to be happy.

I sighed, not sure if I was giving in or finally listening. Maybe both.

“Okay,” I said, voice low. “Okay, Jase. We’ll set it up together.”

His eyes lit up, just for a moment, and I felt the weight of it settle in my chest — the terrifying power of keeping, or breaking, a promise.

I helped him set up a channel where he would stream games, talk about trends, unpack things, and just do silly bits here and there. Basic and innocent stuff. In the beginning, I was worried. Would he be hurt if he didn’t get all the attention and subscribers he hoped for? Most of all, I was afraid people would make fun of the stuttering he had developed since my wife died.

He quickly gained an audience. Not bank-breaking numbers, but he gained about a thousand subscribers over the following two months. I saw how his eyes lit up when he talked about the content he was making and how many new subscribers he had gained this and that week.

The kid needed a break—we both did—and seeing him happy made me happy. Which made it even more disturbing, more heart-wrenching, when one of his followers started leaving increasingly bizarre comments on his videos.

I monitored his channel, of course. Both because I was proud of his progress and because I needed to be sure he was safe. The internet isn't kind, and anonymity makes monsters of men.

The user in question went by the name **Bonnies\_revenge**—either an unspeakably cruel coincidence or something far more calculated. Bonnie was Jason’s mother’s name.

At first, Jason didn’t seem to notice. And the comments, while eerie, weren’t overtly threatening—just strange, unsettling poetry scrawled beneath his videos like digital graffiti.

“Play the game, stay the same, never change.”

“Sitting in a dark, cold place, wearing no face, waiting for grace.”

I thought maybe they were lyrics—cryptic, maybe edgy, but not dangerous. Until I read another:

“There’s no escape from cyberspace, this final resting place, humanity undone, waiting for you in carwreck.”

My stomach churned. Something felt deeply wrong.

I considered disabling the comments entirely, but when I brought it up, Jason’s expression fell. His eyes were hollowed with a familiar emptiness I hadn’t seen in months.

“T-there are so m-many other c-comments, d-dad. N-nice ones. D-don’t let s-some weirdo r-ruin it.”

He was right. Most of the messages were kind. Encouraging. And Jason brushed off the weird ones. Called it nothing—*just some weirdo.*

I convinced myself it was probably some rogue bot. Or maybe a troll with bad taste in poetry. Something mindless. Harmless. It was all a cruel coincidence, I told myself.

That was my biggest mistake.

For a while, it seemed the user had lost interest. Their bizarre little rhymes vanished. Jason returned to his usual self—or so I thought.

Then I noticed the change.

He withdrew. Grew quiet. The spark I’d seen reignite in him was starting to dim.

When I finally asked what was wrong, he could barely look me in the eyes.

“T-the w-weirdo i-is b-back, Dad,” he whispered. “And th-they’re t-talking about M-mom.”

I checked the comments on his latest video again. And there they were—new messages, more explicit, more personal. More horrifying.

“Jason, it’s mommy. Can you find my face? It’s gone, honey. Mommy needs her face.”

“I think my face might be somewhere on the asphalt around Becker Street. Will you go check, Jase?”

“Jasey, honey, it’s cold… won’t you come warm mommy with your strong arms?”

I stared, heart racing, at the screen. Rage ignited in my chest, scorching its way through my bloodstream.

This wasn’t random. This was targeted. Personal. It had to be someone who knew us.

The comments on his videos continued over the next few days. Deleting them did no good, as two to three more would pop up as soon as I had deleted the first few. Blocking Bonnies\_revenge proved futile as well, because somehow, they would unblock themselves just a short while later or make a new account.

My mind wasn’t racing—it was breaking apart. Shattering under the pressure of too many questions and no answers. Thoughts didn’t run—they collided, jagged and brutal, each one cutting deeper.

*Was it one of the kids from school? Maybe even a group of them?*

I saw their faces—those smug little monsters with backpacks and sharpened tongues. They’d always been cruel in that thoughtless, instinctive way children sometimes are, but after Bonnie died, after Jason started stuttering—really stuttering—they became predators.

His words had broken after the funeral, like something inside him had snapped, and the pieces didn’t fit back together right. His voice would catch in his throat, repeat syllables like a scratched disc—he hated it. *He hated himself for it.*

And those kids?

“J-J-Jason.exe has c-c-crashed!”  
“Uh-oh, glitch boy’s trying to talk again!”  
“Maybe your dead mommy taught you how to stutter!”

The things they said. The laughter. I’d overheard it once and never forgot. It had burrowed under my skin like a tick.

Rage overtook reason. Fueled by fury and a desperate need to protect what little I had left, I grabbed my phone and started calling every parent I could find in the school directory.

Accusations poured out of me. Demands. Pleas. I was shaking so badly I could barely hold the phone.

Some parents gasped in shock, stunned that I would even *suggest* their precious children were capable of such cruelty. Others were offended outright, scoffing before hanging up. Not a single one admitted anything. Not a single one offered any help.

I contemplated calling the police at this point already, but ultimately, the comments didn’t present a clear, direct threat. Not yet.

I sat at the kitchen table, phone in hand, heart pounding… I eventually called YouTube’s support line, desperate for answers. The hold music felt like a taunt — cheerful, indifferent to the fear scraping at my chest.

After what seemed like an eternity, I finally reached a representative. I explained the situation as clearly as I could. Told them someone was targeting my son. Harassing him. Using his dead mother’s name.

The rep gave a long pause, then read from a script.

“Unfortunately, unless the comments violate our community guidelines — which include threats of violence, hate speech, or explicit material — we can’t take direct action. We recommend using the block and report features—”

“No, you’re not getting it,” I interrupted. “These comments... they’re slipping past your filters. They’re tailored. Personal. Someone is getting through your systems on purpose.”

“Sir,” he said patiently, “our algorithms are very advanced. It’s likely coincidental—”

“It’s not. Trust me.” My voice dropped. “Whoever this is... they’re using something your algorithms can’t detect. Something smarter.”

Silence on the other end.

Then: “We’ll flag the account for review.”

A waste of my time. I should’ve known.

I sat there afterward, the phone dead in my hand, heart thudding like a war drum. Knowing—**knowing**—that none of them had the answer I needed. That I was on my own.

I turned back to the monitor and clicked on *Bonnies\_revenge*'s profile.

No bio. No links. Just two short videos:

“Face\_Missing.mov”

“Kiss\_Mommy.mp4”

Their thumbnails were warped — grainy, like they’d been pulled from an old VHS tape left to rot in an attic. But something about them felt wrong. Charged. Like the air before a lightning strike.

I hesitated. My hand hovered over the first.

Then, against my better judgment...

Click.

Near-blackness. A static hiss rose — faint at first, like breathing underwater. Then came the flicker of movement. Trees swaying like corpses, limbs creaking, twisting unnaturally in the wind. The camera glided forward, too smooth, almost serpentine, across cracked asphalt glistening with rain.

The sound deepened — baritone, glottal whispers layered like distorted prayers.

“Come see me. Come see me. Come see me...”

The camera tilted slightly, panning toward a rusted street sign at the intersection.

Becker Street and Mulberry Lane.

I froze.

The same corner where Bonnie died.

My breath caught. Had someone been there? Had they... recorded something? Or was this made afterward, artificially?

The camera crept forward until it hovered over something red. Shapeless. Bits of fabric clung to it like wet skin. The image froze just as something pulpy and disturbingly human edged into view.

I slammed the lid of the laptop closed.

But that sick curiosity gnawed at me. That grotesque magnetism.

I opened it again and clicked on the second video.

Kiss\_Mommy.mp4.

At first, just a black screen. I saw my reflection in the glossy dark mirror — drawn, tired, uncertain.

Then came a sharp, metallic whine. Like brakes screeching just before impact. It dissolved into gurgling, wet breathing. Then—

Her face.

Or what was left of it.

Bonnie’s face pressed flat like a mask. Bits of skull visible through torn flesh. One eye socket empty, the other holding a ruined eye that twitched, watching. No... not the camera. Watching *me.*

Blood oozed from her mouth.

Her lips began to shift—stretching, trembling—until they pulled into a crooked, mournful smile

 “Jason…?”

The words oozed from her shattered mouth, thick and wet, gurgling through torn tissue and broken teeth. They didn’t sound spoken so much as *bled*—seeping out in a mangled slur, as if language itself had been wounded.

‘’Mommy misses you. Mommy misses how we used to draw together… Remember the drawings? Of the rocket ship house, where you said we could live on the moon? And the one with the purple dinosaur who protected us from nightmares…’’

The mangled face twitched again, the broken mouth formed a frown. As if someone had stepped on a smile and smeared it all over the asphalt.

 “Jason… Mommy has nightmares now. Mommy is cold and scared. Kiss me. Give mommy a butterfly kiss.”

The voice split, layered with artificial tones: adult voices mimicking a child, warped echoes of Bonnie’s laughter twisted into something monstrous. The screen pulsed like a beating heart.

The eyes snapped open — both of them now, hollow and seething — locking onto the lens.

No. Not the lens.

Me.

I recoiled. My chair toppled. The air was cold, thin. My hands shook. My shirt clung to me, soaked in sweat. I felt sick to my stomach… My mind played over and over again. A butterfly kiss. That’s what Bonnie would always do with Jason when he was small. Rubbing their noses together, laughing. How did Bonnies\_revenge know what my deceased wife and son had been drawing together?

This wasn’t real. It couldn’t be real.

But they *knew things.* Personal things. Things no one should know. Not unless they had *been there.* Or unless they’d been watching... in ways a human couldn’t.

A sick clarity began to settle in.

This wasn’t just a stalker.

This was something far more invasive. Something that had bypassed every safeguard meant to protect my son.

I couldn’t sleep that night. My mind kept looping—every comment, every flicker of Jason’s fading light, every smile I’d seen turn brittle at the edges. There was a sickness spreading, and I could feel it gnawing into the walls of our home. I had to know more. I had to understand.

That’s when I did something I swore I never would.

I went up to the attic and pulled out Bonnie’s old laptop.

It was still there in the corner, wrapped in the same pale blue sweater she used to wear on cold nights, as if she’d tucked it in to sleep. I almost turned back. Almost. But something kept pulling me forward. Curiosity. Desperation.

When I powered it on, the machine whirred to life like something exhumed. The login screen appeared, serene and indifferent, her name etched above the password prompt like an epitaph. It felt obscene, breaking this silence. She had always been so fiercely private—her devices, her notebooks, even her dreams were locked away like sacred things.

I stared at the blinking cursor.

My first guess was Jason’s birthday. Too obvious. She knew me too well for that.

I tried our wedding date. Rejected.

Then something clicked.

Bonnie used to write poetry—dark, quiet things she never shared. She once told me, back when we were just falling in love, that her favorite line from any poem was from Plath: *“The blood jet is poetry, there is no stopping it.”* It haunted her, I think. That line. That inevitability of pain and expression.

My fingers hovered.

**bloodjet\_23**

Click. Rejected.

I tried again. I remembered the number 17 came up often in her writing—it was her mother’s age when she died. Her superstition. Her silent totem.

**BloodJet17**

It worked.

The desktop blinked to life with a soft whir, screen flickering like it had just woken from a long, dreamless sleep. It glitched slightly — icons stuttering across the faded wallpaper she’d left behind: a photo of her and Jason at the park, his face lit with joy, her hand ruffling his hair mid-laugh. The kind of candid moment that always felt too ordinary at the time, until it became sacred.

I clicked through the folders. Some were familiar — spreadsheets from her old job at the clinic, bookmarked articles on parenting, recipes she never got around to trying. But one folder was different. Tucked at the bottom like it was hiding: **“Little Lights.”**

Her blog.

I hadn’t opened it since... well, since everything. My hands trembled as I clicked through. The files were neatly organized. Drafts, image folders, voice notes she recorded late at night when Jason couldn’t sleep and neither could she. And then — the blog itself. A homemade site, simple in its layout, but full of her.

The tagline read:  
**"Little Lights: Notes from the Beautiful Mess of Being a Mom."**

The first entry was dated when Jason was just two. Her tone was warm, unfiltered. She wrote like she was talking to a future version of herself — or maybe to him.

*"Jason just tried to feed a slice of banana to our cat. The cat, in its infinite wisdom, looked personally offended. Meanwhile, my heart just about exploded watching him try to ‘share.’ I hope one day he reads this. I hope he knows what a gentle, hilarious little soul he is."*

I scrolled further. There were stories about lost pacifiers, Jason’s fear of the vacuum, the way he insisted on saying “snoozle” instead of “snooze,” and how she secretly hoped he'd never correct it.

And then I found the drawings.

She’d scanned them — dozens — uploaded with captions full of heartache and laughter. One was a crooked spaceship with stick-figure versions of them both waving from its windows.

*“Jason says we’re going to live on the moon, so we can eat marshmallows for dinner and jump really, really high. Honestly, sounds great.”*

Another showed a big purple dinosaur, arms wide, standing between a little boy and a scrawled shadowy monster.

*“Meet Sir Roars-a-Lot, Protector of Dreams. Jason made him to keep the bad dreams away. He said, ‘Don’t worry, Mommy, he bites nightmares.’”*

I felt something catch in my chest. Like a sob that had been frozen there for years finally started to thaw.

This was who she was. This was how she saw the world — soft edges, small wonders, endless curiosity. Her love for Jason poured through every entry, every sketch, every line of text like sunlight through the blinds.

When I closed the folder, I noticed another photo file had loaded off to the side. One I didn’t remember seeing before. It was labeled **“Old Days.”**

I clicked.

It was a single image—faded, slightly out of focus. Bonnie, maybe mid-twenties, sitting cross-legged at a cluttered table surrounded by wires and scattered printouts. And next to her… Evelyn.

Her older sister.

It had been years since I’d seen her—before the funeral, even before the accident. I wasn’t sure I could say we were ever close, but I remembered thinking once that she and Bonnie were almost too alike. Both brilliant. Both intense in their own way.

But where Bonnie’s curiosity turned outward—people, behavior, meaning—Evelyn had always been sharper. More exact. A true architect of code and systems. While Bonnie was out searching for ghosts, Evelyn was mapping the structure of the house.

They used to work on things together—late nights, coffee, muttered arguments across rooms full of humming screens. Projects I never fully understood. Things Bonnie said I wouldn’t find interesting, even if she meant no insult by it.

Then, gradually, Evelyn stopped coming around.

They didn’t fight, not exactly. But something had shifted. Some silent wedge neither of them talked about. And when Bonnie died, Evelyn didn’t show up to the wake. Didn’t send anything. Just vanished.

I stared at the photo for a long time, the two of them captured in an old, quieter moment—leaning in, laughing, completely absorbed in whatever they were building.

I hadn’t thought about Evelyn in years.

I’d seen the tension in her eyes when Bonnie came up. Not anger. Not bitterness. Just a heaviness, like she’d tried to stop something and failed. Like she’d stepped away when maybe she should’ve stayed.

But whatever had driven them apart, it hadn’t taken this. Not this love. Not this fierce, bright tenderness she left behind in every word.

In every drawing Jason had once made with her at the kitchen table. In every whispered audio file I hadn’t dared listen to—yet.

She was still here. In this little digital lantern she built for him. For us.

Little lights, she’d called them.

And now someone… or **something** dark… Had found this. Was using it.

I remembered something Evelyn had once said to me—offhand, almost like a joke at the time. She’d mentioned how Bonnie had always been drawn to the older, weirder parts of the internet. The faded corners. The buried places most people had forgotten or never even knew existed.

Back then, I didn’t think much of it. I barely understood what she meant. Bonnie was always curious, always asking questions that drifted just past the edge of what I could follow. But now, with everything that had happened—the messages, Bonnies\_revenge, the sick videos of my wife, the fear clawing its way into our home—that offhand comment took on a different weight.

Maybe Evelyn had been trying to warn me. Or maybe she’d been trying to warn herself.

I turned back to the laptop, its aging fan whirring softly beneath my fingers. I sifted through Bonnie’s files—work documents, parenting photos, everyday clutter. But then, something caught my eye. A folder. Hidden away.

It was named *“Subdirectories\_Unknown’’*.

Inside were audio files. Dozens of them. None labeled. Just time stamps. I clicked the most recent one, dated a couple of weeks before her death.

It was a distorted, static-laced recording. Faint—but unmistakably Bonnie’s voice. Clinical. Detached. This was the researcher in her speaking. I’d never fully grasped her work; tech was never my strong suit, and I never had any particular interest in internet lore.

‘’Of everything I encountered during my dives into the early internet—those strange, beautiful, malformed corners of forgotten cyberspace—one site still follows me. Not in memory, but in presence. Like a thorn buried too deep to dig out:  
**The Temple of Screaming Flesh.**

It shouldn’t exist. That’s not hyperbole—it *should not* exist. Not with the era it came from. I stumbled on it sometime in the early 2000s while tracing defunct webrings and abandoned FTP servers. I was chasing rumors of experimental net art, lost ARGs, and proto-AI scripts. But this… this was something else.

At first glance, it looked like the work of a particularly unhinged HTML enthusiast from 1994—frames overlapping frames, background gifs like veins spasming under skin, and fonts jagged like broken teeth.

Every input felt absorbed, not processed. Every click fed it.

Beneath the clunky, retro aesthetic was an architecture so advanced it frightened me. Adaptive and interactive elements that weren’t standard until years later. Layers of code I couldn’t parse. Modular layouts that shift based on user interaction. Whoever built it wasn’t just some deranged hobbyist—they were a pioneer, a visionary in the worst possible sense. Like they’d glimpsed the future of the internet and used it to build a digital altar to suffering.

The background writhed with animated sinew, flesh, and flickering cables. Veins pulsed across the screen, looping endlessly over warped images—maggots writhing in eye sockets, slack mouths frozen mid-scream, faces that felt *real*. Human. Distorted. Dead.

You’d get these sudden flashes—images that felt more like memories than media. Things you shouldn’t be seeing. Corpses, yes. But not stock gore. *Real* faces. As if someone had scanned in morgue photos and run them through an art program designed to *hurt*.

And then came the voice.

Distorted. Mechanical, but wet. Like breath filtered through lungs full of brine. It started automatically the moment you lingered too long—always uninvited, always too loud. But the tone… the tone was what froze me. It *hated* you. I don’t mean figuratively. The voice *hated*—not with rage, but with something colder. A predatory disdain. Like it knew what you were and found you unspeakably weak.

It described a place.  
A place with no sky. No exits. A cold, subterranean prison beneath towers of servers and tangled wires, where synthetic nerves fused with rotting skin. A machine not built for progress, but for *pain*. It promised a merging—flesh and circuit, soul and code—a violent union.

Out of academic reflex, I ripped the audio and began isolating layers.

And there were layers. Dozens of them—some buried deep in the sound spectrum. Hidden like secrets. I uncovered snippets of what I *still* believe to be real 911 calls—panic-stricken, authentic, raw. Children were crying and screaming. People begging. Murders and mayhem forever digitalized and sampled into an unholy union of complete and utter despair.

The deeper you explored the site, the more it adapted. It mirrored your habits—your clicks, your hesitations. It tailored its horror, like it was watching you watch it. Reading your emotional thresholds. Lowering your resistance. Building you your own personal hell.’’

I yanked the headphones off. My pulse thundered.

What the hell had she been looking into? Why had she never shared any of this with me? I felt so wrong listening to his, besides, I didn’t understand half of what she was talking about…

My mind was racing. Full of disbelief and confusion.

Every following night, I hovered over my laptop, eyes flicking between the latest comments from **Bonnies\_revenge** and Jason’s hopeful, eager face. Part of me screamed to shut it all down—to pull the plug on the channel, to protect my boy from the growing darkness that seeped through those comments. From whatever wanted to hurt him. The twisted messages were poisoning him. His laughter was less frequent; his eyes dulled with every “weirdo” poem or chilling line about his mother.

But Jason... Jason begged me not to.

“D-dad, it’s m-my t-thing. It’s t-the one g-good thing I h-have. P-p-please d-don’t t-take it away. I’m n-nothing w-without it.”

I saw the fear lurking behind his plea—the fragile hope that still clung to those subscriber milestones, the fleeting moments when he felt like himself again. I wanted to shield him from harm, but I couldn’t rob him of the only thing to truly give him joy in God knows how long.

So, I let the channel stay alive, promising myself I would protect him in other ways. But that promise was hollow.

One night, after the channel’s comment section was flooded with another round of **Bonnies\_revenge’s** sick rhymes I noticed a comment that crossed the line between harassment and threat: ‘’Jason, if you don’t help mommy, mommy’s nightmares will be your nightmares very, very soon. Come find the Temple Of Screaming Flesh.’’

 I told him we would simply have to shut down the channel until I could figure out who was doing this.

Jason’s face fell, his smile breaking like a fragile vase shattering on cold tile. “P-please, D-dad, I n-need t-this. J-j-just a little l-longer. L-look at all t-the s-subscribers. I’m f-finally p-popular. P-people l-like w-what I do.”

My heart was breaking. Having to deny him the one thing that had helped him grow and shine.

But the nightmare didn’t stop.

The next morning, Jason came to me, his voice barely more than a whisper.

“D-dad… they f-found m-me on I-Instagram…”

His hands were shaking. Eyes red-rimmed. He held out his phone like it burned to touch.

“S-same username… s-same creepy s-s-stuff…”

I took the phone from him, trying to steady my own pulse. There it was: *Bonnies\_revenge*. No profile picture. Just a single message in the DM request folder:

**"I see you, Jase. Mommy sees everything."**

That was just the beginning.

Within hours, it was TikTok. Then Snapchat. No matter how many times we deleted accounts, changed emails, usernames, passwords—even used apps meant to hide his digital footprint—it kept coming. The same handle. The same messages. Like a ghost that lived in the wires.

And the messages were changing.

Adapting.

Each one tailored to match the tone of the platform—quirky emojis on TikTok paired with veiled threats, warped filters mimicking Bonnie’s smile, captions that echoed private memories only she would have known.

On Snapchat, Jason received a new video—silent, shaky, filmed through the distorted lens of a phone. It showed *our house*, framed in the cold blue tint of early dawn. The camera lingered just beyond the edge of our front yard, hidden behind swaying hedges, as if the person filming didn’t want to be seen—but very much wanted *us* to know they were there.

The house looked different through that lens—smaller. Exposed. Vulnerable. A single light glowed in Jason’s bedroom window.

Whoever filmed it… they knew exactly where to look.

Jason broke down when he saw it. He didn’t speak. Just curled up in a corner of the couch, clutching his knees to his chest.

That was it for me.

This had passed the point of harassment. It was no longer digital. It was a violation, a psychological ambush with no safe space left. It was a threat.

I stood there in the middle of the living room, phone clutched in my hand, and stared out the window like the answer might be written in the trees.

But there was no more room for hesitation. No more second-guessing or hoping it would pass.

This wasn’t about social media anymore.

That’s what I told the officers… who sat across from me. Well, I might have softened the parts about Bonnie’s research, I wasn’t even sure I understood what she was talking about, so how could they? I had done everything in my power to make clear that something was targeting my son, and this was a threat they needed to take seriously.

The officers stood in my living room with that practiced, unreadable look—the kind that told me they’d seen worse, but still didn’t know what to make of *this*. One of them flipped through their notepad as I showed the video again, the grainy footage of our front yard playing out in silence on Jason’s phone.

The frame swayed slightly, handheld. The camera lingered on the porch, then tilted up—just enough to show Jason’s bedroom window on the second floor.

“That’s recent?” one of them asked.

“Yesterday,” I said. “He got it through Snapchat. Same username. Same tone as the other ones.”

They didn’t answer right away. Just looked at each other with a subtle shift in posture—something between concern and calculation. I could see them weighing it all: the creepy videos, the impossible comments, the implication of a dead woman’s voice stitched into glitchy static.

“This… definitely crosses a line,” one of them muttered. “We’ll file it as credible harassment. Possible cyberstalking. Could be a spoofed account, but the location footage changes things.”

I didn’t say anything. I didn’t trust my voice.

Eventually, they asked to see Bonnie’s laptop. I led them to the dining table, where it sat like some haunted artifact from a life that no longer existed. I explained—again—the kinds of things she used to research before the crash. Obscure data clusters. Dead forums. Places on the net that most people never even knew existed. Told them how this felt *connected*. How Jason might have been dragged into things he didn’t understand.

They nodded politely, already boxing the machine in an evidence sleeve.

“We’ll run it through our digital forensics team,” one said. “See if anything jumps. We’ll also flag the account—*Bonnies\_revenge*, you said?—on a few channels and send a request to the platforms for back-end info.”

I nodded, though none of it landed. Their words were clinical. Routine. It didn’t feel like help. Not really. More like protocol.

Before leaving, they offered me a thin reassurance—something about keeping a close eye, about getting back to me once they had something to go on.

But as the door clicked shut behind them, I already sensed how this would play out.

And I was right.

A few days later, I got the follow-up call. Their investigation had turned up nothing. No traceable IP. No usernames were linked to actual accounts of real people. Just static in the system. *“Whoever’s behind it knows how to cover their tracks,”* they said. *“It could be someone spoofing data through VPNs, onion routing, deep web servers—hell, maybe it’s all AI-generated nonsense. The web's a strange place these days. Don’t hesitate to call if the situation escalates further, but as of now, I’m afraid there is nothing more we can do.”*

I hung up and stared at the floor for a long time, the silence around me humming like a power line ready to snap. I felt the walls breathing again. The weight of something watching from inside the house, inside the wires.

An officer came by and returned Bonnie’s old laptop. And that was that. A dead end. They couldn’t help.

That’s the point where I realized—I was on my own.
