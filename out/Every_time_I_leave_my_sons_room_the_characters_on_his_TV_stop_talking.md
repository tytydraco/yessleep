I slide in the DVD. Hit play. 

An image fades in. 

There are two men standing shoulder to shoulder, smiling into the camera. A lightbulb hangs above them. Another hangs in the back of the room. Everything else is dark.

“Hey, kids!” the man on the right says. “Today—you’re gonna learn how to take care of...” The camera zooms out, revealing another person on the ground between them, wearing a dog costume. “Doggy!”

“Alright, sweetie,” I say. “Watch your movie. Mommy’s got work to do.” 

Jack sits crisscross applesauce on the floor. His eyes are glued to the screen. He gives an imperceptible nod. 

Heh. This’ll work even better than I thought. Jack’s entertained. I get housework done. Win-win.

I kiss Jack on the cheek and head out the door. When I step in the hall, I hear the same man say, “First, dogs need lots of love. And *lots* of attention. Like this—” 

The sound cuts out. 

Oh crap. Don’t tell me it broke. I bought the tube TV *and* the DVD player at a garage sale for twenty bucks. The lady who sold them called it *a steal*. But maybe she’s the one who did the stealing. I peek back in. 

Jack is still staring at the screen, but at this angle, I can’t see what’s on it. I step in and the screen comes into view. The image is frozen. All three characters are standing still. I’m about to walk closer and restart the player, but I notice something. 

A faint hum pipes through the speakers. I listen closely and realize it’s traffic noise outside wherever they’re filming. Then above their heads, the light bulb flickers.

This movie is still playing.

I examine the face of the man who spoke in the intro. His eyes angle downward. The second man stares in the same direction. And even though “the dog” is in a costume, the costume head angles down in the same spot. 

I follow their eyeline—down to the ground, off the edge of the screen, and onto my son. 

I take a step forward to turn it off, and both men drop to their knees and pat the dog. The person inside the costume nuzzles their head side to side, breathing in a quick rhythm, simulating panting. 

“Maybe I shut this off…” I say. Jack gasps. He peers up at me. “Alright, fine. But tomorrow, we’re buying some different DVDs.”

For the next hour, I leave Jack to do my vacuuming and dusting. Jack doesn’t come out of the playroom once. At noon, I make Jack a PB&J, and slide it on the kitchen counter. “Jack!” I yell. “Lunch!”

The house is silent. 

“Jack?”

Nothing. 

I cross the kitchen and head down the hall to the playroom. When I’m several feet from the door, I hear whispering.

I pause. 

It’s Jack’s voice. Every few seconds, his voice spikes. But otherwise, he’s being so quiet I can’t make out what he’s saying. Then he stops. Goes quiet a few seconds. And a deep voice whispers back. 

My heart slams in my chest. “Jack. Honey.” I sprint in.

Jack sits in the same position—leaning forward with his legs crossed, watching the TV. I scan the room. It’s empty. “Who were you just talking to?”

Jack looks back at me. His forehead scrunches. “No one, Mommy.”

“But I just heard you.”

He presses his lips together, really thinking about it. Then he shrugs. He turns to face the TV again. Those men are now walking “the dog” around the room on a leash.

“Well, shut that off, please. It’s time to eat.”

After lunch, I let Jack resume his movie in the playroom while I sit at my computer and do my taxes. An hour passes. I’m incredibly productive. Too productive. 

Why hasn’t Jack come in to tell me he’s bored? Or that he wants to go outside and play? Usually that occurs way before now. 

I walk into the hall. Listen.

No TV sound. No whispering.

I pace down the hall and into the playroom. 

It’s empty.

“Jack?” I say, loud enough to penetrate every room. I hear the tick of the living room clock. “Jack. Answer me. Right now.” But he doesn’t. Is he hiding from me? I pull open the closet. 

Empty. I walk into his bedroom, check under the bed. 

Not there.

I open his closet. Not there either. Panic fills my chest. I run into my room and check there. Empty. I rush through the house, checking under furniture, behind curtains, under tables—anywhere he could be hiding, but after ten minutes of searching, I arrive at a sickening realization. 

My son is gone. 

First I call the police, then my husband. The cops beat him here. At the kitchen table, an officer hammers me with questions about today. I answer them as clearly as I can. Eventually my husband walks in and sits beside me. When I reach down to take his hand, he crosses his arms, like he’s repulsed by my touch. Disgusted. 

“Do you usually leave your son alone?” The officer asks. 

My throat tightens. I can’t take it anymore. “Officer, would you excuse me?”

His eyes snap up from his notepad. He shrugs. “Of course.”

I wander into the playroom, not bothering with the light, and sit in the spot Jack was in earlier. I look around. Some of Jack’s toys are scattered on the floor. Something twists inside my chest. I bury my face in my hands and begin to cry. My husband is right. How could I have let this happen? I glance up at the TV.

I bought a TV set for my five-year-old so he’d leave me alone for long enough to do housework. Now he’s…kidnapped? Run away? What kind of mother am I? I should take that thing, walk it over to the window and send it flying out into—

Wait.

What if the movie told him to do something? To go somewhere. This could be a clue.

I lean forward and smack the power button. The TV flashes on, and a paused image crackles to life. 

A door. 

*This* is the last thing Jack saw. I reach under the TV, snag the remote and hit *play.* 

The men step into frame and stand on either side of the door. “Alright, *kids.* The last thing you need to know is where to keep your dog at night. Since you don’t want him wandering around in the dark, it’s best to keep him *in a cage.* Like this!”

He reaches out, twists the door handle, and pulls. The door creaks open, revealing the inside of a closet. On the floor, there’s a small cage. The person in the dog costume is crushed inside. But the cage is so small, maybe it’s a different person.

“Well, goodnight, kids,” he says, then glances at the other man. “Can you say goodnight, Charlie?”

“Goodnight.”

Then the man turns to face the cage. “What about you—dog? Can *you* say goodnight?” The camera zooms in on the cage. The actor’s head droops so low, the costume’s floppy ears scrape the ground. And the sound they make is so soft, I barely hear it. I listen closer. Then I realize they’re crying. “I *said*, can you say good night, *dog*?”

The actor takes a trembling breath, and in a tiny voice, thick with tears, they say, “*Ruff…ruff*.”

My knees buckle. I fall into a sitting position. I can’t breathe. The voice I just heard—the voice that just came from behind that mask—sounded just like my [son](https://www.reddit.com/user/ElliotPryce/comments/1ouk6um/the_stories_of_elliot_pryce/).
