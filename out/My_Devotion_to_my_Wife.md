The light in the dressing room was always too yellow, too dishonest. I flicked on the high-intensity vanity bulbs, the ones Elena used to complain made her look like a specimen under a microscope.

"Don't be dramatic, darling," I whispered, resting my hands on her shoulders. She felt light today—fragile, like a bird made of balsa wood and silk.

Elena didn't move, her gaze fixed intently on her own reflection. She was always so focused when I did her hair. I picked up the silver-backed brush and began to work on the tangles. It was a slow, rhythmic labor. Sometimes the strands came away in the bristles, more than they used to, but I simply tucked them into my pocket. We had plenty of time.

"My pearls, Samuel," her voice drifted into my mind, sounding like the rustle of dry leaves. "The ones you gave me in Florence. They’ll hide the... the marks."

"Of course," I said, reaching for the velvet box. "The pearls solve everything. They always have."

I leaned in close, my face inches from hers. I could see the fine pores of her skin, the perfect stillness of her nostrils. I loved this part of the evening—the quiet before the world tried to take her away from me again.

I leaned in, the scent of her favorite lavender water thick in the air, though underneath it there was that sharp, metallic tang of the "medicine" the doctors had prescribed. I had to be meticulous. Elena was always a perfectionist.

"The rouge is too heavy, isn't it?" she asked. I could almost feel the phantom pout in her voice, a playful ghost of the woman who used to dance in the kitchen.

"Just a touch, my love. To bring back the roses," I murmured.

I picked up a small sponge, dabbing the thick, flesh-toned cream along her jawline. It was a heavy-duty brand, the kind used by stage actors to hide deep lines, but today I needed it to bridge the gap where her skin felt a bit... loose. I smoothed it over the transition of her neck, being careful not to tug. She didn't flinch. She had become so brave about the pain lately; she barely moved a muscle when I worked on her.

"Am I still beautiful, Samuel? Even like this?"

"You are a masterpiece," I said, and I meant it. My fingers traced the curve of her ear. I noticed a small, darkened spot near the lobe, but to me, it was just another blemish to be conquered.

I reached for the spirit gum and a small strip of silk.

"Just a little tension here," I whispered, more to myself than her. I applied the adhesive behind her ear, pulling the skin taut to smooth out the hollow of her cheek. It was like restoring a fine painting. You have to understand the bone structure, the way the light is supposed to hit the planes of the face.

I picked up the eyeliner. My hand didn't shake. It couldn't.

"Eyes open wide, now," I teased.

I propped her lids just a fraction higher. They felt heavy, resistant, like the springs in an old watch that had finally wound down. I painted a thin, sharp line of charcoal black along the lash line. It gave her back that piercing, intelligent look that had captured me twenty years ago.

"There," I sat back, wiping a smudge of grease from my thumb. "Now, for the lips. Do you want the 'Midnight Red' or the 'Petal Pink'?"

"The red," she sighed. I could feel it in on the back of my head. "The red makes me feel like I’m still burning."

I unscrewed the gold tube. The wax was rich and thick. As I began to outline her mouth, I had to use a small, careful movements to hold the corner of her lip in place—just a temporary measure until the "setting spray" dried.

The bedroom door groaned as I pushed her through. I’d have to oil those hinges tomorrow; the house was starting to sound as tired as I felt.

"Careful with the threshold, Samuel," she whispered. "You know how I hate being jolted."

"I've got you, darling. Smooth sailing from here."

The hallway was a gauntlet of shadows, but it was the smell that hit me—the one I’d grown used to, though it grew heavier every day. It wasn't just the lavender or the makeup anymore. It was a dense, suffocating sweetness, like overripe fruit left too long in the sun. I’d placed bowls of potpourri on every radiator, and a dozen scented candles flickered on the side tables, their wax dripping like slow tears.

We passed the bathroom, the door ajar. I caught a glimpse of the bathtub—stained with dark, rust-colored rings that wouldn't scrub away, and the stack of heavy, yellowed towels I hadn't had the heart to wash yet. Beside the sink, my toolkit sat open: the fine-gauge wire, the bags of cotton, and the long, curved upholstery needles. Anything to help my poor Elena, sense the doctors do nothing.

"Is the house always this dark?" Elena asked, her voice a thin vibration in the air.

"It’s atmospheric," I replied. "Candlelight suits you. It hides the... well, it highlights your best features."

The truth was, the curtains were nailed shut. I couldn't risk the harsh, judgmental glare of the afternoon sun. Sunlight was the enemy of preservation; it faded the fabrics and did unkind things to delicate surfaces.

As we entered the dining room, the wheels of her chair crunched over something on the hardwood. I looked down. It was just a few stray grains of sawdust that had escaped the workroom in the basement, clinging to my slippers like pale sand. I kicked them under the rug.

The table was a triumph. Crystal glasses, the silver polished until it screamed, and a centerpiece of lilies so white they looked bleached.

"The lilies are beautiful," she sighed. "But they smell like a funeral, Samuel."

"They smell like memories," I corrected, locking the brakes on her chair so she faced me across the lace tablecloth.

I reached across and took her hand. It was stiff, but still perfectly soft. To anyone else, it might have felt like marble, cold and unyielding. But to me, it was the only anchor I had left in a world that insisted on taking things away.

I poured two glasses of deep, dark Cabernet. One for me, and one for the glass I placed just in front of her, the liquid reflecting in her wide, unblinking eyes. 

I raised my glass, the crystal chiming against the silence.

"To us," I said.

"To us," she echoed. But the voice in my head was thinning, fraying like an old ribbon. "Samuel... I’m so heavy. Why am I so heavy?"

"It’s just the dress, Elena. Rest now."

I took a long sip of the wine, but my hand slipped. A single, dark red drop fell, splashing onto the back of her hand. I gasped, reaching for my silk handkerchief to dab it away. I didn't want the moisture to seep in; I’d spent hours ensuring her skin was cured and dry.

As I wiped the skin, I pressed a little too hard.

The sound was small, like a dry twig snapping underfoot. Beneath the heavy layer of foundation and the silk-wrapped wire, her ring finger gave way. It didn't bleed. It didn't bruise. It simply broke off at the second knuckle, hanging by a solitary, stubborn tendon.

"Samuel?" her voice screamed, a jagged tear in my mind. "Samuel, what’s happening to me?"

"Nothing, my love," I choked out, my heart hammering against my ribs. "Just a little maintenance."

I reached for her hand to steady it, but my thumb caught on the edge of the "pearl" necklace. The string snapped. The beads didn't scatter; they fell into the deep, cavernous hollow of her collarbone.

The sudden weight shift was too much for the internal frame I’d built. I watched, frozen, as the elegant tilt of her head began to slide. The stitches I’d hidden so carefully behind her ears groaned under the tension. With a sickening, wet *pop*, the staples at the base of her skull tore through the softened tissue.

Her head didn't just slump; it rolled forward, the chin hitting her chest with a dull, thudding weight. The movement forced a pocket of trapped air up through her throat. It wasn't a word. It was a long, low hiss of escaping gas—the final, putrid breath of the rot I had tried so hard to bury.

The smell hit me then, a physical blow that no amount of lilies could mask. It was the scent of a cellar, of damp earth and liquefying organs.

I looked down at the floor. A thick, dark fluid was beginning to seep from the hem of her velvet dress, pooling around the grains of sawdust on the floor. The "makeup" on her face began to crack as the skin beneath it bloated, the gases of decay finally winning the war against my needles and thread.

"Samuel," the voice whimpered one last time, dissolving into a wet gurgle. "I think... I’m spilling."

I sat back in my chair, the silver fork still clutched in my hand. I looked at the beautiful, red-lipped thing across from me—the sagging, leaking puppet of a woman I had spent weeks disemboweling and stuffing with wool.

"Don't worry, Elena," I whispered, picking up a needle and a fresh coil of wire from the table. The wine in my glass was the exact same color as the sludge dripping from her chair. "We’ll just start again. I can make you better."

I leaned over the table, my fingers sinking into the soft, grey mush of her cheek as I began to sew her eyes open one more time.

“I will make you perfect again, no matter how long it takes”
