CW: Animal death, psychological torture, suicidal thoughts   
\-------------------------------------------------------

This text message is all that I have left, all that I will ever have left. Even my own death won't save me from this hell. I know he can see it. Every word I write. Sometimes my words, sentences, get deleted and I can't do anything about it. I haven't kept track of how many times I've written this. The only thing I had kept track of was the amount of times I saw these grotesque arms. Twice.

He's probably not paying attention to me. I have memorized every single line, every word, every character I want to share. Just like how I had memorized that pleased smirk that startled me to my core. He knew me. I had already seen him contact my friends, sent them pictures using my name. I often never dared to look at those pictures.  Just based on the reaction of everyone, they seemed horrifying. I was being called names, hate was flung against me. Whatever he sends them is something that affects them so deeply that I wouldn't even begin to understand how someone could learn so much personal information about so many people. His work was akin to that of a demon that had studied humans for far too long.

I didn't want any of this.

Even the calls that people have made to my phone have slowly ended. At first I had received a few, and they showed genuine concern. But over time, that concern faded. I sometimes checked my social media on my PC to see if things had changed. I opened up any way to contact anyone and what I saw was hollow. They were all there. I saw them interact, their posts. They seemed so happy. Over time that view into happiness had faded. I had been blocked by countless of them.

But whenever I tried to reply to those who still had me as friends online, even if it worked for a moment, he deleted it. He posted whatever he wanted under my name. He, using my likeliness, accused my best friends of crimes I knew they were affected by. I wanted to move my cursor and just close whatever processes I had running to put an end to this, but he didn't let me. Because when ever I tried to my input devices stopped working. He must have installed a script that disabled my devices once I tried to open the task manager. All I could do on my PC was sit and watch. I miss the way my dogs would bark. I miss the way my wife talked to me.

I could only watch as he burned everything to the ground.

I had considered standing up already countless times. But I can't. I haven't been able to move in so many years. My legs feel numb. It was a miracle I could even use my hands enough to write. I was never bothered my inability to move. I was bound to my desk, but before everything happened I was surrounded by those who loved me. Even right now, I never hated myself for it. My mouth slowly moved to form sentences whenever my caretaker came over. She saw me and my situation. But she never cared. No matter how many times I tried telling her. She just shoved food and drinks into my mouth and left.

Despite that, I cannot blame her. I had looked at some of the images. He had sent her a photograph of her beloved daughter, beheaded, via my name. I don't know why he started any of that. I am afraid to know the truth. Seeing the head of the girl always made me feel horrible and nauseous. I don't want to blame myself, but I can't shake of this feeling. I could have at least consoled her whenever she visited, but I never brought myself to do it. She must have despised me.

No matter how many times I cursed at the situation, the mangled wreck I had become caused me to be unable to move, unable to fix what he is destroying. Eating was already a challenge, and so was enjoyment. But as soon as he got access to everything, I could do nothing but watch. He sent whatever he desired. I saw my beloved dog's corpse posted to a website about helping dogs. The caption made me look like I was some heartless monster that just got a kick out of posting this type of content.

I'm scared. I am terrified of what he was doing, is doing, and will keep doing. I once saw texts appearing one day, sent to my beloved wife. He had told her all my insecurities. He leaked my medical information on some shady sites, and used that to convince her to commit suicide. The last time I saw her posting had been 5 months ago. She was someone always posts a lot, but I haven't seen anyone mourn her.

The lack of mourning had always worried me. No one in my friend groups or family seemed to care, but at the same time, I don't know if they don't care or not. Because there was always the chance that he had deleted these messages for me, or spammed them with so much disgusting imagery and hateful messages, that I couldn't see the heartfelt messages anymore. It had been years and I never felt safe ever since. The pain in my heart at times was growing more intense as time went on. I could feel it starting to burst open again and again. That it would grow out of it once more.

And each time I had written about my wife, I had lied, I knew the truth.

I had not seen any positive message directed towards me in so many years. All because I had opened up one program too many. Someone I thought I could have trusted had sent me a file. He told me, hectic and in fear, that I should open it up immediately. Years back, when I was still na√Øve, I had opened it up. I never thought that all of this would have happened because of one person that had it out for me. I was aware that maybe I have done some things wrong in my life, but this was beyond reason. I was afraid of this officer and what was truly going on in his mind. He was demonic in my eyes.

It began infecting my computer, the only thing I had to talk to anyone. All the people I cared about were being sent messages that do never belonged to me. The accident I suffered from made it impossible to change anything. Looking back at it, I saw him there, he, the officer, watched me with his pleased expression. I never knew why, but my treatment was lackluster. I was never able to recover as I should have had. I had the feeling this officer was the reason for it. My eyes were only able to look away. That never changed anything, he could still continue to drag me to hell. I am scared. I just wanted to be loved again.

And from that point onwards, everything I had just described, occurred.

It don't think I can write this message for much longer. He had probably seen this message and variations of it countless times. I was fully aware of that. But it was the only thing he allowed me to do. Write. Observe.  Survive. He was cruel and beyond any love. A real demon.

At this point I should just starve myself. I am terrified. If only my body was able to move. If only I was young again. Whenever I did try to starve myself my caretakes forces food down my throat. She was not too blame. Because if I were to die, she would be held accountable for it. I don't want to see anyone feel even worse.

Even if I were to kill myself, my false digital footprint would continue moving because of him. Although I had considered it. I had attempted it. I was horrified of what things he had send the youngest generations; My own grand children and their friends. Those were the only messages I had never read. I had no need to read them because I had already have the police knock at my door more than I can count.

They raided my home, roughed me up, and searched through everything. They glared at me with a disgust only reserved for the lowest of scum. I could tell that if wasn't illegal for them they would have already  caved in my skull with their guns. At this point I wish it were legal for them to put me out of this hellish misery. Please, I am afraid of living. No matter how many times I silently begged for it, this demon was always changing their minds. Although I knew some genuinely just did not care about me.

I had heard the police enter my room so many times, go through everything so many times. Those stares, I wanted them to go away. They should have understood by now that all of this wasn't my fault. But they didn't because every time I saw them going through my messages all the vile messages stopped being written. The devil himself was there. No matter how often his body type changed, no matter if he got larger, smaller or anything else. He was always there, watching my torment.

I swear, it was as if I could often see the same police officer leading the raids. Every time the police visited the officer gave me a look, not of disgust, but of something far worse. He looked pleased. I saw this small, hardly noticeable smirk a few times by this point. At one point he had placed a machete into my room, but only after forcing me hold it. There was blood on that blade.

I should have long been thrown into jail, but they always just leave me alone without doing so. I had heard them laugh when leaving my home. I don't even know how my home looked like anymore. It was probably broken and ruined. When I thought about that, I had never been visited by my wife in all this time. I knew why. I knew exactly why I hadn't seen her smile in a few months.

I understood my situation, but every time I get to writing this part down, I felt myself want to die, I am scared. The truth is something I already knew. I just kept running away from it. The only thing I had to do to learn about the status of my wife was look to the corner of my room. She was hanging there. Lifeless, from a rope, that she herself had put there. Of course they had never removed her.

I can only see my life being further pulled into hell, all while she was rotting.

The stench, I had never been able to get used to it. And no amount of looking at her would get me used to seeing her dead corpse dangling from the ceiling. I watched pieces of flesh falling from the body I once hold so dear to me. To this day I don't understand why this all happened. I never thought someone would feel pleasure from all of this. It scared me, knowing that he was out there, taking my name to torment me. Even if I would have been able to move, I was afraid of doing anything about it, because what if someone recognized my face and assaulted me?

The knocking on my window at night, that pleased smirk, this demon knew how much I feared that. I would never be able to forget it if I kept living. I knew he was occasionally just watching me through my window, voyeuristic, sadistic. He knew what he was doing to me. There was a question he asked me with his far too content expression, a question that was constantly replaying in my mind.

"You are still alive, you know?", he had asked me. He knew far too well how I felt about being alive right now.

Only a few more months and my body should hopefully die from old age. This was my only way out of this hell, at least I would find salvation. Then I wouldn't have to think about this question anymore. Because I knew far too well that I was still alive. The devil knew it as well, that's why he tortured me with it. Thinking about it, the officer, no, that demon, was likely just waiting for me to die, to meet me in hell itself.

I doubt he would stop tormenting my family and friends though. I was fully aware of that. At least I was able to write this far. I had never been stopped from writing, only set back countless times. Because to him, this was likely just a game. I had glanced over to the machete more times than I can count. When I was younger I never thought I would have wanted to die so much.

At one point, as I had already mentioned, I had tried taking my own life using as much force as I could. I really did. I tried to purposefully choke on a piece of food that was too large for me. I planned on blocking my own airway, but the devil had other plans. I first thought that he was just human. But as I felt his arm growing out of my heart and reach into my throat to save me by pulling out the piece of food, I knew he was the devil.

The thought that one day the devil would grow tired of tormenting me like a human could, scared me. The deformation I witnessed when he grew his arm out of my own heart was terrifying and agonizing. Even if I could run away, he would just be with me all the time. Of course I had no way of confirming that, but I felt it deep within me. Because even when I attempted to blind myself in the hopes that losing my vision would mean no longer seeing his pleased expression, his grotesque arms prevented that as well. I could not escape the torment. I could only wait. Wait and pray that it won't get worse.

I had no intention of enraging him. That's why I only tried escaping this hell twice. Only twice did I see his arms. I was afraid of attempting it a third time, because who knows what the devil would do then. What if whenever I try to do something he prevents, he is able to move further and further out of my body, until he could roam on earth in his true form, exiting my body as if it were a cocoon?

If only I hadn't trusted him. I am scared of trusting anyone ever again.
