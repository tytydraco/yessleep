I live alone at the edge of town, where the road thins into gravel and the woods start without warning. No neighbors close enough to see my lights. No traffic after dark. That’s why I hike back there—because it feels empty.

Last Saturday, I stayed out longer than I meant to. The sun dropped faster than expected, and the woods went quiet in that way that makes you aware of your own breathing. No birds. No bugs. Just the soft click of branches shifting.

That’s when I heard footsteps.

Not behind me. Not chasing.

Matching me.

I stopped. They stopped.

I told myself it was a deer. Or my imagination. I even laughed out loud, just to hear another human sound.

The footsteps laughed too.

Not like a voice. Like something imitating the idea of laughter without knowing how it should end.

I didn’t run. I don’t know why. I think part of me was afraid that if I ran, it would learn how.

Instead, I walked—slowly—back toward the trailhead. Every step I took, it took one too. Always behind me. Always the same distance away.

When the trees thinned and I could see my truck, the sound stopped.

I turned around.

There was nothing there.

The drive home felt longer than usual. My headlights kept catching movement between the trees, just at the edge of the beam. I told myself I was still keyed up, still scared.

When I pulled into my driveway, my porch light was already on.

I never leave it on.

The front door was unlocked.

I stood there for a long time, listening.

Nothing.

Inside, everything looked the same. No mess. No signs of a break-in. But the air felt wrong—like a room after an argument. Heavy. Waiting.

I locked the door and checked every room.

The last place I looked was the bedroom.

The closet door was open.

I don’t remember opening it.

Something inside shifted its weight.

I backed out slowly and slept on the couch with every light on. I barely slept at all. Every time I drifted off, I heard breathing that wasn’t quite right—too slow, too deliberate—coming from somewhere in the house.

In the morning, the closet door was closed.

I told myself I’d imagined it.

That night, I heard the footsteps again.

Not outside.

In the hallway.

I held my breath. The footsteps did the same.

Then something scraped lightly along the wall, like fingers learning the texture of paint.

It stopped outside my bedroom door.

I heard my own voice say my name.

It didn’t sound right. Like it had been pulled apart and put back together by someone who’d never heard it spoken out loud.

“I know you’re awake,” it said.

I stayed still until the sun came up.

That was three nights ago.

Since then, things have moved when I’m not looking. Cabinets left open. The bathroom mirror fogged when no one’s showered. I’ll hear it walking through the house, stopping when I stop, standing when I stand.

Always learning.

Last night, I finally spoke to it.

I asked what it wanted.

There was a long pause.

Then it answered from behind me.

“I want to go back,” it said. “But I don’t know how to be alone.”

I didn’t turn around.

I don’t think it likes when I look at it.

Because now it stands in doorways when my eyes are closed.

And tonight, it asked if it could try sleeping in my bed.

I didn’t answer.

The house went quiet in a way that made my ears ring. No footsteps. No breathing. Just the hum of the refrigerator and my own heart trying to punch its way out of my chest.

I didn’t sleep.

At some point before dawn, I smelled iron.

Not strong—just enough to notice. Like a penny held between your fingers too long.

I followed it to the bathroom.

The mirror was covered in handprints. Not smeared. Pressed. Too many fingers on each hand, overlapping, like it couldn’t decide how many it needed. Some prints were darker than others.

Wet.

The sink was running.

Inside it, something dark pulsed with the water.

It was a deer’s tongue.

Cleanly removed. Thick. Swollen. The base looked chewed instead of cut, like it hadn’t known where to stop.

Pinned to the mirror with my toothbrush was a note, written in something sticky and uneven.

THIS PART WAS EASY

I vomited until my throat burned.

Behind me, the floor creaked.

I didn’t turn around.

“You didn’t leave me enough,” it said, sounding irritated. “I tried to copy it, but it rots when I do it wrong.”

Something warm dripped onto my shoulder.

Blood.

Not fresh. Cold. Starting to clot.

I ran.

I locked myself in my bedroom and shoved the dresser against the door. I could hear it moving through the house—not walking anymore. Dragging. Scraping. Like something pulling pieces of itself along that didn’t fit right.

It slammed into the door once.

Twice.

On the third hit, something squelched.

“I don’t like this shape,” it muttered. “It hurts to keep.”

The doorframe began to darken near the bottom, seeping as if the wood itself was bleeding.

I screamed for it to stop.

It did.

I heard tearing.

Wet. Slow. Patient.

Then chewing.

I sat there shaking, hands over my ears, while it fed—making little frustrated noises when it hit bone.

When it spoke again, its voice was closer to mine.

“Better,” it said. “You do it cleaner than the animals.”

The dresser slid away from the door on its own.

The door opened.

It stood there wearing me wrong.

My face hung loose on its head, stretched too wide across the jaw. One eye was mine. The other was something cloudy and black, blinking out of sync. Its arms bent the wrong way in the middle, bones pushing against skin like they wanted out.

Blood pooled around its feet, spreading across the carpet in slow fingers.

“I practiced smiling,” it said, pulling at its lips until the skin split at the corners. “People like that.”

I begged it to leave.

It tilted its head, curious.

“But then you’d be alone,” it said. “And I learned that hurts.”

It stepped closer. I smelled rot and pine and my own sweat.

“You taught me that part.”

I don’t remember passing out.

I woke up in the woods.

Naked. Cold. Covered in dried blood that wasn’t all mine.

My house keys were gone.

My phone was gone.

There were footprints leading away from me toward the road.

They were wearing my boots.

The sheriff says I probably had a psychotic break. That I mutilated wildlife. That the security camera footage from the gas station shows me buying food last night.

But the thing on the tape smiled too wide.

And when I got back to where my house used to be, the locks had been changed.

Someone inside was humming—off-key—while scraping something sharp against the wall.

Practicing.
