I found these old cassette tapes along with a player in this old house I bought, the previous owner killed himself. Hanged himself off a tree in the front yard. It's not haunted, I don't think anyway. If it is. I'll leave. I don't care what losses I incur. No, thank you. Anyway, I figured I'd transcribe what the tapes say. I only listened to it a little bit before I decided to write it down, but I thought it would go great here.



Tape 1



I think I might be going crazy.

I think my shadow is watching me.

Maybe I should start from the beginning? I noticed it a month ago? Maybe two? I'm not sure, it's been a while since, but not more than three months. It was little things at first. Noticing my shadow out of the corner of my eye. I know that sounds silly, but it was weird. A little darker than the other shadows, angling slightly differently from the other dark spots. Not much, I barely noticed it when I did. It was so... So surreal, if you know what I mean. I was sure I was just imagining it. Maybe I still am. But it got worse. Could I be imagining it? I don't think so, maybe I'm losing my mind out here. I know I shouldn't have moved away like I did, but Mom was just so... Just too much.

Whatever the case, I'll get on with it. After I noticed my shadow being different, I started keeping an eye on it. I know that sounds stupid. Watching your shadow? It's just a shadow. It has to be. Right? But, I saw it. It started moving, not much. Maybe it was my eyes, I don't know, but it looked like it was shifting, ever so slowly. I was sitting in my room when I noticed it. It looked like it had moved, only an inch or so. But, I think its arm moved. Or was it mine? Did I move my arm? I don't know. I still don't know. I... I need help. I'm scared, even writing this. I don't understand. Sometimes when I'm in the bathroom I swear it looks like my shadow is watching me. Not when I look right at it, but when I see the reflection through the mirror. Does my shadow not understand mirrors?



End of tape 1

Tape 2



The date is the twenty-third of May, nineteen ninety-two. My first tape was two weeks ago. I didn't think to label it or record the date. I'm doing both with this one. I hope it finds you better than I am.

I'm not crazy. I swear I'm not. My shadow has been moving more. Three weeks ago, I was standing still, and I noticed my shadow's arm moving, reaching out. It was so weird. I know I didn't move my arm. Why did it move? Please, Rob, I know you think I'm losing my mind, but I'm not. More happened! It wasn't just the arm! I-I blacked out, just, out of nowhere. Four days ago, I had just finished dicing onions for that salsa you love so much. Then, I blacked out. I never pass out, it's never happened to me before then. But I woke up in the bathroom. The mirror was smashed and my hand bloody. It knows I can see it through mirrors! I need help!

I bought a new batch of tapes today. I blacked out again and woke up before I could finish smashing them all. I bought a pack of ten, I only have two left. It destroyed the rest. I know I'm not crazy. I know I'm not. Anyway, I'm going to send this before it destroys it. When you get it, send help. Please. I need help.



End of tape 2

Tape 3



The date is the fifteenth of June, nineteen ninety-two. Are you okay Rob? I tried calling you after I sent the last tape, but you never answered. Then it ripped out my phone cable and destroyed the telephone. I just had it put in too. I'm scared. I'm so scared, Rob. It's gotten worse. My shadow isn't hiding anymore. It's watching me I know it is. It's moving constantly. And it's always watching me. I... Rob, I stopped blacking out a week ago. But I - (unintelligible due to crying) - I haven't blacked out in a week, but it doesn't need that anymore.

After I sent the last tape, it only got worse. My shadow started moving more and more, turning and twisting, stretching, and sliding in front of me while I was facing a light. Climbing the walls and even the ceiling. I know I'm just seeing things. I kept on blacking out, more and more frequently, and doing things that I would never do. It stabbed all my knives into the wall. I love my knives, and the wall is plaster. It destroyed the blades. You know, you know how much I cared for my knives. The fits I would throw when you or Janet would mess with them before I left. I should have never left.

I'm scared Rob. I haven't been blacking out, but my shadow disappeared a week ago, and when it did, I lost control of my body. I watched as I moved around the house. I couldn't do anything. It was like I was watching a movie. My body stumbled around like a baby learning to walk. I got my control back about ten minutes later. But Rob... I... I don't know what to do! It's been happening more! Yesterday, it walked around for three hours before I could do anything! Rob, I'm scared! Please! Please help me!



End of tape three

Tape four



I hope you liked my prank, Robby! Don't worry about anything. I'm fine. I just wanted to scare my big brother. How have you been? You should drop by. We want to see you! Hope you can make it here! You'll love it! Love you lots and lots!
