The night of March 23, 2024, was one I would never forget. My buddy and I had decided to venture to an abandoned train station in As, Belgium. We'd read about the eerie place online and were drawn by tales of unexplained noises and lingering shadows. The idea was to capture some footage for our urban exploration channel, but what we found was far more unsettling than we anticipated.

As we arrived, the first thing that hit us was the sound. A low, thudding noise reverberated through the air, accompanied by what could only be described as a dark, ambient hum. It was around 10:00 PM, and the station was shrouded in darkness, save for the occasional flicker of light from a distant streetlamp. We scaled the fence and immediately sensed something was off.

Behind the trains, a large warehouse loomed, its doors slightly ajar. From inside, the eerie sounds emanated, growing louder and more menacing. We crouched low, making our way closer. Suddenly, we saw figures moving within one of the trains—people in blue overalls, their faces obscured by shadows.

"Dude, do you see that?" my buddy whispered, his voice trembling.

"Yeah, I see them. What are they doing here?" I replied, equally unnerved.

The figures exited the train and headed towards the warehouse, flashlights in hand. Intrigued and terrified, we decided to follow them, moving as quietly as possible. The warehouse door was slightly open, and through the crack, we could see the faint glow of machinery and hear the strange, rhythmic noises.

We crouched behind a nearby train, watching as the figures disappeared inside. For a moment, all was still. Then, without warning, the noise changed. It became a series of loud thuds, like heavy metal striking the ground, followed by an unearthly screech that made our blood run cold.

"We need to get out of here," I whispered, but my buddy shook his head.

"No, we have to see what's going on. We came this far."

Steeling ourselves, we moved closer. Suddenly, flashlights appeared from the other side of the train. Panic surged through us as the figures returned, their movements precise and mechanical. We ducked into the shadows, hearts pounding, and watched as they scoured the area, seemingly searching for something—or someone.

"They're looking for us," my buddy muttered.

"Let's go. Now."

We sprinted back to the car, not daring to look back. As we drove away, the oppressive atmosphere of the station seemed to follow us, lingering like a dark cloud.


Two months later, on June 1, 2024, curiosity and a need for closure drove us back to As station. The memory of our first visit haunted us, and we were determined to uncover the truth behind the strange events.

This time, we arrived during daylight, hoping to get a clearer view of the area. The sky was overcast, casting a grim pallor over the station. The same eerie noises greeted us as we stepped out of the car, a hauntingly familiar sound that sent chills down our spines.

"We're hearing the same sounds again. Two months later, and it's the same thing," I said, setting up the camera to capture everything.

My buddy nodded, his face pale. "It's like we never left. Let's just be careful this time."

We moved cautiously, sticking to the shadows as we approached the warehouse. The large doors were still ajar, the same faint glow emanating from within. We crept closer, the gravel crunching under our feet.

Suddenly, a man's scream pierced the air, desperate and chilling. We froze, exchanging terrified glances.

"I just heard someone scream," my buddy whispered.

"Yeah, me too. This isn't possible."

We edged closer, hearts pounding. From our hiding spot behind a red train, we could see into the warehouse. Inside, the figures in blue overalls were gathered around a large machine, the source of the unearthly noise.

"Maybe we should go back," my buddy suggested, his voice shaking.

"No, we need to know what's going on."

Our curiosity overrode our fear, and we moved even closer. Suddenly, footsteps echoed on the other side of the train.

"Did you hear that?" I whispered, my voice tense.

"Yeah, I did. Sounds like they're coming this way," my buddy replied, his eyes darting around nervously.

"Get ready to run," I said, my heart pounding in my chest.

We held our breath as the footsteps grew louder, closer. Then, three figures emerged from the shadows, their expressions cold and menacing.

"Run!" I shouted, and we sprinted back to the car, adrenaline pumping through our veins.


Breathless and trembling, we reached the car. "Why were they coming after us?" my buddy gasped.

"I don't know," I replied, my mind racing. "But something's not right. We need to get out of here."

We leaned against the car, trying to catch our breath. "What the hell was that?" my buddy asked, still panting.

"I have no idea, but it's not safe here. We need to go."

"Wait, I dropped my flashlight when we were running. We need to get it back."

"Are you serious? Those guys are still out there!"

"I know, but we need that flashlight. Let's just be quick and careful."

Reluctantly, I agreed. We made our way back into the woods, moving slowly and cautiously. Every rustle of leaves, every snap of a twig, made us jump. The feeling of being watched was palpable, the oppressive silence weighing down on us.

"I don't like this," my buddy whispered. "It feels like they're still watching us."

"I know. Just keep moving."

We finally reached the spot where the flashlight had fallen. I bent down to pick it up, my hand trembling. "Got it. Let's get out of here."

"Wait," my buddy said, pointing to a tall wooden lookout tower in the distance. "I saw them running towards that tower. We need to check it out."

"Are you crazy? We should leave while we still can."

"No, we need to know what's going on. If they're hiding in there, we need to find out."

With heavy hearts and trembling legs, we approached the tower. It loomed above us, a dark silhouette against the overcast sky. The wooden steps creaked ominously as we climbed, every sound amplified by the silence.

At the top, the view was both breathtaking and terrifying. The entire forest stretched out below us, but it felt like we were being watched from every angle. Suddenly, a loud thud echoed from below.

"Did you hear that?" my buddy whispered, his face pale.

"Yeah. It came from the bottom of the tower."

We peered over the edge, our hearts pounding. There, in the shadows, were the three men in blue overalls. They looked up at us, their expressions cold and unfeeling.

"They followed us," I whispered, panic surging through me.

"We need to get out of here, now!" my buddy replied.

We descended the tower as quickly and quietly as we could, the men below us moving with an eerie, mechanical precision. As soon as our feet hit the ground, we ran.

Branches tore at our clothes, and the darkness seemed to close in around us. The rhythmic thudding grew louder, closer. I glanced back and saw the men gaining on us.

"Keep running!" my buddy shouted.

We burst through the edge of the woods and sprinted towards the car. Just as we reached it, I heard my buddy scream. I turned to see one of the men grabbing him, dragging him back into the forest.

"Run! Get out of here!" he shouted, his voice filled with terror.

I hesitated, torn between helping my friend and saving myself. The look in his eyes made the decision for me. I turned and ran, heart pounding, lungs burning. Behind me, I heard his screams, then silence.

I stumbled through the forest, branches tearing at my clothes. The thudding grew fainter, but the fear remained. I didn't stop until I reached a small clearing, collapsing on the ground.

Hours passed before I dared to move. I made my way back to the road, hoping for a passing car. Eventually, headlights appeared, and I flagged down a driver. They took me to the nearest town, where I contacted the authorities.

A search party was organized, but they found nothing—no sign of my buddy, the men, or the warehouse. The station was deserted, the eerie noises gone.

Days turned into weeks, and my buddy was declared missing. I couldn't shake the feeling that something sinister was still out there, lurking in the shadows.


To this day, I can't explain what happened. The memory haunts me, a reminder of the darkness that can hide in the most unexpected places. The abandoned station, the warehouse, the men in blue overalls—they remain a mystery, one that claimed my friend and left me forever haunted by the unanswered questions.

As I sit here, writing this, the events replay in my mind like a never-ending nightmare. The screams, the unearthly noises, the figures in blue overalls—they all blend together, a horrifying collage that refuses to fade.

The authorities never found any evidence of what we saw. The station was abandoned, they said. No signs of recent activity, no machinery, no people in blue overalls. It was as if the entire place had been swallowed by the darkness, leaving no trace behind.

But I know what I saw. I know what I heard. And I know that something evil still lurks in that place, waiting for the next unsuspecting souls to stumble upon it.

I only hope that whoever reads this heeds my warning. Stay away from the abandoned train station in As. Some secrets are meant to stay buried, and some places are better left unexplored.

For me, the memory of that night will always be a haunting reminder of the darkness that can exist just beyond the edge of perception, waiting to drag the unwary into its depths.
