‘’Oh… Sweet child. Don’t cry. I’ll lick your scars softly, nibble at them, slowly… and finally eat them. Baby Blue… Your pain is so beautiful... There, there, let me take it all away… Close your eyes...’’

Even now, from time to time, so many years later, in the dead of night, I hear those words delivered to me in my most vulnerable moment. I hear that monstrous, syrupy sweet, vile, and oddly seductive voice. It slithers through my memories like a wet tongue on raw skin, teeth gnawing forever on wounds that never close.

No child ever expects to come face to face with pure, unadulterated evil. What was lost then can never be regained, but perhaps, I can find solace and peace of mind from writing this down.

Two events happened throughout the spring and summer of 1994 when I was 14. Kurt Cobain blew his brains out, and something very, very evil and predatory made the small town I grew up in its hunting grounds. Although in a sense, these two events were unconnected, both affected me deeply.

This story is a tribute to a time and place I both wish to forget and remember, to the wonders and frailty of youth, and the shaky dreams that never came to be.

 And most of all… To my cherished group of childhood friends.

Gordy, Stump, Dylan. Wherever you are now, I hope you found Nirvana.

The day was April 9^(th,) 1994. We were all gathered in Gordy’s parents’ garage. The mood was solemn and quiet. Gordy was fiddling with his pick, just strumming on his unplugged electric guitar. You could faintly hear the intro to ‘’Come As You Are’’ resting in the still night air. Gordy was the kind of kid who liked to stay quiet and let his guitar speak for him. Then at times, he’d open his mouth, and you could tell he considered his words carefully. Whenever everything got out of hand, he would always be the one to ground things, cut through the noise, and approach it all with a clear head. He was, unquestionably, the one we all looked up to.

Stump sat at the drum set, just staring straight out into nothingness with a blank stare in his eyes, which was very unlike him. He was always abrasive and outspoken. He’d run his mouth like he ran the drums. Fast and loud. With a wit none of us could match. Not tonight, though. His real name was Jackson, but we called him Stump since he was a year younger and half a head shorter than the rest of us. Fiery auburn red hair and freckles, which fit his energetic and fast on his toes persona. He’d been moved up from 7th grade to our eigth-grade class. He wasn’t being challenged enough intellectually, according to his strict parents. Besides Stump, we’d sometimes call him Shortstein because he was supposedly too clever for his contemporaries but also short. I know, we weren’t very inventive with the names, but really, he took the light-hearted bullying like a champ, and that’s why we liked him and quickly invited him into the fold.

I sat on the banged-up couch we’d found under an overpass. The scratched-up wooden table in front of me was littered with cigarette marks, beers, and soda cans we’d stolen from Stump’s dad.

Dylan threw himself down next to me on the couch and lay his head in my lap, staring at the ceiling. ‘’Jesus Christ, this is fucking depressing, you’d think someone died.’’ Dylan was the jokester, also chronically incapable of reading a room, which meant he didn’t have many friends besides us, but he played a mean bass, and really, he wasn’t that bad once you got to know him.

In that moment, though, on that April night in 1994, I welcomed him, breaking the awkward silence. It made Gordy get up, plug his guitar in, and before long, we blasted ‘In Bloom’’ so loud it tore through the night and probably woke up the neighbors several blocks away. Gordy’s voice soared through the garage and beyond. Like an angry period and conclusion to everything Kurt had been to us.

I know it might seem odd that the death of a person we never met would hit us this hard, but Nirvana, and Kurt Cobain in particular, had been our beacon of light. To us, he was proof that misfits and oddballs could make it. We felt he spoke to us when he sang about apathy, boredom, and disillusionment with that raspy, unmistakable voice. The fact that he would opt out of life just like that was a major blow. Like losing a kindred spirit.

We felt invisible, except for the odd bullying here and there, it was as if no one even noticed we existed. Except when we played together. Then we all became one unit. Loud. Young. Dumb. Determined. Hoping for that breakthrough that would take us all away from this butthole of a small town we were stuck in. Misery and boredom had brought us together; the never-dying and optimistic spirit of youth kept us going. It kept us determined not to stay invisible.  

Looking back now, I wish more than anything we had just stayed that way. Invisible and together. I wish we hadn’t been noticed. Singled out by that… Thing.

The final echoes of *Smells Like Teen Spirit* faded, swallowed by the silence that rushed in like a cold tide. The garage felt different now—heavier, as if something unseen had slipped in between us, listening, waiting.

We all put down our instruments and sat around the garage table. Gordy shifted in his seat, then stood, disappearing for a moment before returning with something dusty and old in his hands. A wooden board, edges chipped and yellowed with age. He set it down on the table, and we leaned in, the candlelight making the letters shimmer like whispers carved in bone.

"It’s a Ouija board," he said, voice low, almost reverent. "I thought we might try to… You know… maybe get in contact with him. It might help us make sense of it all.’’

I had never pegged Gordy as the superstitious type. His expression was unreadable—serious, almost expectant. However unconventional it may have seemed then, I now realize he was trying to present a way for us to process what we were feeling. None of us could have known then the horrible road it led us down. It was just a stupid game… Or so we thought.

"Come on," Stump scoffed, arms crossed. "Don’t tell me you actually believe that crap. What are you? 12?"

Gordy shrugged. "What harm could it do? Worst case, it doesn’t work. Best case, we get to talk to the legend himself."

Dylan snorted. "Dumbass, even if it *did* work, which it *won’t*, why the hell would Kurt Cobain’s ghost be hanging around *your* garage? Why would he talk to a bunch of nobodies?"

Stump shot him a glare. "Hey, why wouldn’t he? We’re pretty cool."

Dylan laughed. "Stump, shut up. No, we’re not. And you don’t even *believe* in this."

"Whatever. I’m just saying. We’re awesome. Fuck you."

I swallowed, an uneasy weight settling in my stomach. The air felt charged, electric, like the moment before a storm. I wasn’t sure why, but something about this felt… wrong. *Off.*

"I don’t know…" I muttered. "What if there’s, like… evil spirits?"

Dylan pulled his shirt over his head, waving his arms like some cartoon ghost. "Boooo, Jakey! I’m the vengeful spirit of all the kids you shot into your cum-sock!"

I shoved him, suppressing a laugh. "Oh, piss off."

"Come on," Gordy cut in, voice firm. "I’m bored. Let’s just do this. If it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work. *Nevermind.* And Jakey… as long as we stick to the rules, we should be fine."

Boredom and curiosity won out over the unease gnawing at me. *Nevermind.*

"Yeah," I exhaled. "Let’s do it. Nevermind."

"Nevermind," Stump and Dylan echoed.

Gordy doused the lights, struck a match. The candle flames flickered, casting long, shifting shadows against the walls.

Dylan smirked. "Oooh, looks cozy. Now we just need a red and white checkered tablecloth and a bowl of spaghetti and then Stump and Jakey are ready for date night."

Stump shot back with his usual quick wit, "You know that’s the kind of thing someone in the closet would say, right? It’s okay, Dylan. We all hate you just the way you are. It’s safe for you to come out."

For a second, Dylan’s smirk faltered—just a flicker, then it was back. Gordy cut in before he could throw another jab, his voice sharp.

"Can you guys just shut the fuck up for once and try to be serious?"

We heard the tone of his voice and realized the time for joking was over. He had a way of commanding our respect. We all scooted together as he laid out the rules and explained the process.

Gordy laid the board down slowly, almost ceremonially, then straightened up and fixed us each with a serious look. The candlelight threw restless shadows across his face, making his eyes seem darker than usual.

“Alright,” he said, voice low and steady. “Before we start… the rules.”

He raised a hand, ticking them off with fingers that trembled just slightly.

“Rule number one: Never play alone. We’ve got that one covered.”

He didn’t smile when he said it. No one did.

“Rule two: Be respectful. Don’t mock the game. Dylan, this especially applies to you.”

Dylan rolled his eyes and opened his mouth, but for once, thought better of it. His face tightened, and he nodded—just once.

Gordy glanced around, making sure we were still with him. His eyes lingered on each of us. Then he went on.

“Rule three: Never take your fingers off the planchette until the session is over. That’s the tether. You break that connection; you risk letting something in.”

‘’Planchette. Tether.’’ Dylan made a fancy gesture as he said it. ‘’You sure know some mighty big words, Gords.’’

Gordy just barked at him. ‘’That’s what it’s called, dickhead.’’

I was concerned about what exactly could happen if this rule was broken.

“How bad is that, exactly?” I asked, trying to sound casual, but my voice wavered and cracked at the end like a snapped twig.

Gordy didn’t flinch. “Bad,” he said. “Like… something comes through. And stays.”

My stomach twisted, cold and hollow. I didn’t even know if I believed in this stuff, but somehow, breaking the rules felt worse than just inviting bad luck. It felt like a dare we couldn’t take back.

Dylan leaned in and slung an arm over my shoulder. “Don’t worry, Jakester. I’ll protect you from the ghosties.”

His voice had that usual sarcastic tone, but there was something else there, under the joke—a flicker of sincerity I knew better than to brush off. For all his posturing, Dylan never bailed when it counted. He had proved his loyalty to us more than once before.

“Rule four,” Gordy said. “Keep a candle burning. It’s not just for atmosphere. The flame wards off dark energy. But if it flickers hard or dies out completely, we stop. Immediately.”

Stump scoffed, arms crossed. “Wow, Gordy. You’ve really been doing your spooky homework. Is this your end-of-year essay topic now? ‘How to Summon Dead Rockstars in Your Garage’? And aren’t you breaking a rule by doing this in your own home?”

Gordy glared at him, jaw tightening, but he didn’t rise to it right away. Then he muttered, deadpan, “The garage isn’t connected to the house. So technically, it doesn’t count because this isn’t mine or anyone else's home. And no, Stump—I’m writing my end-of-year assignment on your mom’s tits.”

Dylan wheezed and nearly choked on his own spit, howling with laughter. I bit back a snort. Gordy didn’t usually jab like that. Maybe the tension was getting to him as well.

Stump smirked and shrugged it off like he always did. Nothing ever seemed to stick to him.

“Rule five,” Gordy said, getting back on track. “If the planchette starts moving too fast—stop. That’s not normal. It can mean the spirit is angry, confused, or... something else…”

We all went still at that.

Gordy continued. ‘’Rule number six. Always say goodbye at the end of a session.’’

No questions about that one. It made sense.

Gordy’s voice dropped, barely above a whisper now.

“And rule number 7. If the planchette moves in a figure eight—end the session immediately. No questions. Just stop.”

“Why?” Dylan asked, more curious than sarcastic.

“Because the figure eight is a symbol of infinity. Eternity. If a spirit does that, it’s not talking. It’s latching. It wants to cross over and possess someone, permanently.’’

Stump blinked and then raised a brow. “7 rules? That’s it? Weird number. I always thought spooky shit came in threes or fives.”

Gordy gave him a flat stare. “Well, Shortstein, maybe there are other versions. These are ours.”

We sat in silence for a moment, the rules hanging in the air like heavy smoke. Outside, the wind scraped against the side of the garage. Inside, the candlelight flickered like it was trying to warn us.

We placed our fingers lightly on the planchette, the silence in the garage stretching tight as wire. You could’ve heard a pin drop—or a breath held too long. The air was heavier now, dense with something unseen, something *waiting*.

Even Dylan wasn’t joking anymore.

Gordy cleared his throat, his voice low, careful, like he didn’t want to wake something.

“We wish to speak to the spirit of Kurt Cobain…”

A heartbeat passed.

Then Dylan, ever the idiot, broke the tension with a lopsided grin.

“And if he’s busy, maybe someone else can go get him? Big fans here!”

Gordy shot him a glare that could’ve cracked glass. “Dylan. Don’t.”

Dylan shrugged and fell quiet, the fragile stillness felt thinner now, as if something had *noticed* us.

The candle burned steadily. Its small flame cast long, reaching shadows that slithered across the garage walls. Nothing moved.

Gordy tried again. “We wish to speak to the spirit of Kurt Cobain… can you hear us?”

The planchette twitched.

Just a small, shivering motion, but enough to freeze the breath in my lungs.

I leaned toward Dylan, whispered sharply, “Knock it off.”

His brows furrowed. “I’m not doing anything.”

I looked at Stump. His face was unreadable, but his hands were slightly shaking.

Then, once more, Gordy’s voice: “Kurt… are you with us?”

The planchette slid slowly across the board.

Y…  
E…  
S.

I jerked back slightly. “Okay, no. One of you is messing around. Come on.”

But I scanned the others' faces—and saw only confusion and suspicion. As if they were all quietly contemplating who might be moving the planchette.

Stump tried to lighten the tension. “You know, Y for yes, N for no—that works fine. No need to burn through the alphabet.”

“Stump, shut up,” Gordy snapped, his voice harder than usual. He leaned closer to the board, eyes fixed.

“Kurt… is that really you?”

Y…  
E…  
S.

Dylan shifted beside me, muttering under his breath. “Jake, are you messing with this? Seriously.”

I dug my elbow into his ribs. “No, dude. I swear.”

“Whatever.” He didn’t seem convinced.

The candle flame fluttered, though there was no wind. The shadows on the walls stretched long and crooked.

Gordy continued, slower now, as if somewhat afraid of what might answer. “Kurt… we have questions.”

The room seemed to pull in tighter. The silence wasn’t just absence—it was a vacuum.

Stump took charge now, leaned forward, his voice quieter than before. “Kurt, what did it feel like… knowing the whole world knew your name? That you’d made it?”

We all wanted to know this; we dreamed of that feeling.

The planchette hesitated, then moved again.

Y…  
E…  
S.

I sighed. Nonsensical answer. In that moment, I felt stupid for even believing this whole thing for as much as a second. “Guys, seriously. This is so lame. You could’ve at least put some effort into it.”

They didn’t respond. Their eyes were locked to the board.

Then, without warning, the planchette *jerked*. Our fingers barely stayed on as it sped across the surface.

W-O-U-L-D Y-O-U L-I-K-E T-O K-N-O-W H-O-W I-T F-E-E-L-S?

We all looked at each other, too stunned to speak.

“I don’t get it… What does that mean?” Dylan said, clearly directed at us but the planchette began moving again.

I C-A-N S-H-O-W Y-O-U H-O-W I-T F-E-E-L-S.  
I C-A-N M-A-K-E Y-O-U-R D-R-E-A-M-S C-O-M-E T-R-U-E.

The air turned icy. Not cool—*cold*, like winter air leaking in from somewhere it shouldn’t. The flame flickered violently, casting the walls in wild, shifting shapes.

I swallowed hard. This felt wrong. “Gordy… I want to stop. Please.”

Dylan nodded. “Yeah, man. That’s enough. This is messed up. Can’t you see Jake’s upset?”

Dylan tried to seem brave for me, but I felt his frame shivering against me.

But Gordy didn’t even look at us. “This isn’t a game to me. I need answers. I know you all want to know the answer to this.”

And then he asked the question.

“Why did you kill yourself?”

The words hit the air like stones breaking glass.

“Dude, no! You can’t ask that question!” Stump snapped. “You *said* to be respectful! That was your *own* rule!”

Everything in me screamed to pull my hand away—but I didn’t dare. None of us did. Not anymore.

Dylan leaned into me, his body trembling against mine. “This is bad. Seriously. Jake, this is bad.”

I nodded. I knew. I felt it in my teeth, in my gut, like a storm about to break.

Gordy leaned closer. “Please… just tell us why.”

The planchette moved, slow and deliberate.

I.  
A.  
M.

It stopped. Hung there, like it was savoring the moment.

Gordy’s face was drained of color. His voice dropped to a whisper. It seemed he finally snapped out of whatever space he had been in, and the realization hit him like a ton of bricks.

“…That’s not Kurt.”

“No *shit*,” Dylan muttered, voice tight with panic.

Then, the planchette started moving again. I traced each letter, with a rising sense of dread and unease as the message was revealed.

T  
H  
E  
—  
S  
C  
A  
R  
—  
E  
A  
T  
E  
R

“What the hell is that? What does that mean!!?” My voice rang through the garage, the words clawing their way out of my throat in terror.

Stump was pale as a ghost now, his hands trembling on the planchette.

“I want out,” Dylan said. “I want out RIGHT NOW!”

But none of us could move. Our fingers stayed pinned to the planchette as if nailed in place.

Then it happened.

The planchette snapped to life, jerking beneath our fingers with a violence that defied explanation. It dragged our hands across the board in a looping, relentless motion—sideways figure eights, carved again and again with mechanical precision.

The infinity symbol.

None of us were moving it. Not willingly. I was sure. Our fingertips clung to it out of reflex or fear, I don’t even know which. Something primal locked us in place.

Dylan screamed first, a ragged, panicked cry. I followed, and even Stump—the eternal skeptic—let out a shrill, guttural sound that didn’t seem like it belonged to a boy his age at all.

“STOP IT!!” I shrieked. “GORDY!! WHAT THE HELL DO WE DO?!”

Gordy looked like a corpse. His skin had gone paper-white, and his lips quivered like they’d forgotten how to form words. His voice finally came, hoarse and cracking:  
“Say goodbye! All of us! NOW!”

We did. All at once. The word tumbled from our mouths like a desperate prayer rising in intensity:  
“Goodbye… Goodbye!! Goodbye!!!”

But deep down, I think we already knew.

It was too late.

The candle beside us sputtered once—then died. A hiss, like a final breath. Shadows swallowed the garage whole.

Then, from the far end of the room, past the stacks of old tires, the rusting bikes, and the shelves thick with dust, came a sound.

Wet.  
Heavy.  
A sickening slap. Like raw meat hitting concrete. Then… The sickening sound of flesh being ripped open. A sound of writhing, screaming flesh we’d come to know as its calling card.

We froze.

None of us spoke. None of us breathed.

The silence stretched out—humming, pulsing, alive.

Then, cutting through the dark like silk through skin, came a voice.

Not loud. Not angry.

Soft.  
Sweet.

A sickening, unnatural pitch.  
Almost childlike in its amusement.

“I’ll make you beg for it… I’ll make you plead… Like a hungry puppy… Then I’ll take you to that special place you all dream of… At a price: All your pretty scars, inside and out.’

Something moved in the shadows, something barely perceivable, so quick you could blink and miss it, like a millisecond snapshot of screaming flesh, maggots, and torture.

Then silence reclaimed the garage, thick and suffocating, like a blanket soaked in dread. The air felt wrong—emptied of presence yet charged, as if something unseen still lingered just beyond the edges of the garage, watching.

Dylan clung to me like a drowning man to driftwood. His whole body trembled against mine, silent tears streaking down his face. I’d never seen him like this before.

Stump sat frozen, lips twitching, eyes vacant. He whispered into the stale dark like a mantra or a malfunction:  
“This didn’t happen… This isn’t real… There’s no such thing… Ghosts aren’t real… Demons aren’t real… This did n’t—didn’t happen…”

Gordy looked around at us. Pale and white as a freshly washed sheet. ‘’What did we just do? What the fuck just happened!?’’

Stump broke out of his frightened trance. ‘’We?! You mean YOU!! YOU suggested this shit to begin with! And then you took it too far!’’

Gordy’s frame shivered, clearly upset. ‘’Stump… I’m… Sorry I…’’

I broke in between them. ‘’Shut up, just shut up. We are going to forget this happened, ok?’’

Dylan was sobbing slowly beside me. Stripped of his jokes, his bravado, reduced to something raw and terrified. I put my arm around him.

‘’Forget it? One thing is the stupid planchette moving… That could’ve been one of you assholes. But… We all heard that voice… Didn’t we? I think I saw something too… For just a glimpse…’’ Stump looked around at all of us. Clearly broken. This defied his deep-rooted sense of logic. His lips quivered as he said it… ‘’And… what the fuck is a scar eater? Forget that, I don’t even want to know.’’

We just nodded. We had all heard the voice. We had all heard its ominous threat.

Gordy cleared up. Then he did what he always did whenever we had landed ourselves in trouble. He tried to rationalize himself out of it.

‘’Look… Ma… Maybe we all had a bit too much of that spliff we shared earlier, maybe… We shouldn’t have mixed that with beer.’’

I don’t think any of us bought that explanation, but we wanted to. We desperately wanted to. So, we all ended up agreeing on that explanation. We were high, drunk, got ourselves all riled up and… Saw and heard shit that just didn’t happen.

If only that had been the truth. But the horror to come was darker than shadow, crueler than silence, and so vile it felt stitched from the marrow of our deepest fears. Like it came from some realm beyond ours, where evil had infinite time and resources to devise torment like carefully crafted artwork. Artwork, fit to hang in the great halls of hell. It defied the boundaries of nightmare—especially for us, who already knew how pain could wear many masks, from the quiet ache of neglect to the raw wound of loss and abuse.

The following week, nothing much happened, although I swear it felt as if something had changed. I could feel it, subtly. Footsteps scraping behind me, faint and strange laughs carried by the wind. Shadows looming, forming shapes they shouldn’t be forming. I kept it all to myself, told myself I was imagining it.

It was Tuesday, and I was on my way to see the school counselor, Mr. Wentworth. The school had called my foster parents about my ‘’behavior’’. Yes… Foster parents… I suppose you might as well get the story so we can be done with it.

My dad left my mom when I was about four years old and never looked back. My mom, a recovering addict, lost her last life-line the second he went out the door. Apparently, I wasn’t motivation enough for her to quit. So back on the needle she went. For one last trip. I found her lifeless in her bed, a solemn smile smacked across her addicted lips, needle still in her arm. I’ll never forget that image. Was she smiling because she was finally free of the responsibility her and my dad never wanted? I’ll never know. I was 8 years old. Susan and Robert took me in and, quite honestly, they gave me the comfort and security I never had before. I will forever be grateful to them for that. But they never understood me, although they did their best. Now they were concerned that the kid who found his mom dead at the age of 8 was a bit maladjusted in school. Honestly, I didn’t see the big deal. What 14-year-old kid around these parts didn’t skip school on occasion? Apparently, my attitude was shit, I was heading nowhere, and my grades were down the drain. I should give up on my ‘’impossible’’ musical aspirations and focus on school instead, they would say to me. Not knowing their disapproval of my dreams only fueled my desire to prove them wrong. I don’t deny the grades, honestly, I was terrible at most subjects besides English. The teachers didn’t help much though, most were fossils who just went through the motions and never even tried to inspire us at all. Well, except Andrew, my English teacher, he was different. He also didn’t insist we call him ‘’mr. inser last name’’ which helped a lot. He told me I could be a writer, which was the most uplifting and supportive thing any of these dried up asshole teachers had ever told me.

Mr. Wentworth’s office was… Different, to say the least. Old movie posters, band posters… Trinket and souvenirs from what I guessed was a lot of traveling. One poster caught my eye. Nirvana? I nodded in silent approval before sitting down. (descripe in more details)

Mr. Wentworth looked through some papers before he looked up at me. My first impression was that he looked like an unwashed hippy. Not nice, I know. But that’s the feeling I got. Rough, unkempt beard. Check. Hippy glasses? Check! Flowery and colorful shirt? Check again.

I sighed. I just had to string him along. This wasn’t the first time I had to deal with this sort of thing. My fosters had sent me to several child psychiatrists right after taking me in. I had learned how to give them what they wanted.

‘’So… Jake. First things first. I’m here to help the best way I can. I’m not a psychiatrist, so don’t worry, I’m not going to psychoanalyze you or anything like that. We’re just going to talk a bit about how you’re doing in school and basically whatever you want to talk about that might be bothering you. Does that sound fine?’’

I nodded. I was already bored.

He nodded too. ‘’Good, whew… I was afraid you might be one of those needy brats actually expecting me to solve all their problems for them.’’

I raised my eyebrow a bit. This one was definitely new.

He shot me a crooked smile when he saw my surprised reaction.

‘’Hey, counselors are human beings too, I get tired as well. You know what especially get my gears grinding? Kids who expect me to magically solve problems they themselves are causing. I know it’s my job, but honestly… Well, sorry, I get sidetracked. Tell me a bit about yourself.’’

I was astounded honestly, but his straightforward no bullshit attitude was refreshing. I decided to give him a chance.

‘’I don’t know what to say. I’m just not very interested in school.’’

He nodded. ‘’No harm in that, there must be something you’re interested in though?’

My eyes trailed towards his Nirvana poster. ‘’I guess, I really want to be a musician. If I’m being honest. My foster parents think it’s stupid…’’

His eyes locked on mine, and I felt the sincerity in them, maybe even a form of kinship, but a slight sadness too.

‘’There is nothing stupid about having dreams, Jake. As long as you’re realistic about them. Do you expect to be a rockstar?’’

‘’Hell yes I want to be a rockstar, who doesn’t?’’

His laugh was heartfelt, no condescending tone at all.

‘’I understand, I do. What an exciting life it must seem like to a kid from this, let’s be honest, boring little town in the middle of nowhere.’

He kept on surprising me.

‘’But, I guess I wonder, if you might be able to temper your expectations somewhat. If you don’t become the next Cobain, maybe you would be fine with something less?’’

A reasonable question. But to a fragile 14-year old with a head full of dreams, it seemed more like the same kind of disapproval and lack of belief in me I had heard before.

I think he sensed my disapproval and quickly asked another question.

‘’What got you into music in the first place?’’

My heart skipped a beat. I didn’t like that question. I never did. I always lied or shrugged it off. But something about his sincere interest made me come clean. What could it hurt anyway?

‘’My mom used to sing me songs… Velvet Underground, The Byrds… Stuff like that. She had all these records she would put on, too. Then she’d pick me up and dance with me in her arms. I really liked that…’’

He must have felt like he was getting somewhere, like he was connecting with me. Like he was picturing these happy moments. I had him hooked.

‘’It sounds like your mom was a wonderful person.’’

I flinched at the assumption. This is why I don’t like telling people how I got into music.

‘’No, I fucking hate her. She was a junkie who only cared about me when she was high. She did have a pretty voice though and some nice records.’’

Clearly he was taken aback. I almost relished in it. Now comes the excuses, the attempt to salvage it all. She had loved me, after all, addiction does terrible things to people. Yada yada yada.

‘’I’m sorry to hear that, Jake. I really am. I certainly understand if you hate her.’’

What was this guy’s deal?

‘’You don’t understand anything.’’

His voice changed… A calm, soothing quality came over it.

‘’Addiction is a hard thing to grasp… It really does change people. But I’m not concerned with how she may or may not have felt about you. I’m concerned how you feel about it.’’

I was getting slightly annoyed at this point. Was he just going to keep validating my feelings? I felt like testing him.

‘’I hate her… That’s how I feel. In fact, I hate her so much I don’t even care if I fuck up my life, because there is nothing I could ever do or be that will be as shitty as she was to me. I just don’t care.’’

He looked at me calmly, with what seemed like genuine concern behind his gaze.

‘’Well, that is certainly one way to go about things. I can’t deny that.’’

I scoffed at him. ‘’And what is the another?’’

He looked me dead in the eye, and I will never forget what he said next.

‘’You could prove that bitch wrong. She made you feel worthless, didn’t she? Like you weren’t worth it. Worth her recovery, worth her effort to stay clean. Prove her wrong. Be better. Chase your dreams, whatever it takes, let it fuel you, that resentment. You are right to be hurt, Jake.’’

I was dumbfounded. This counselor surely weren’t like any other I had met before.

‘’I guess, that’s true…’’

He nodded. ‘’Well, Jake. I think we’re off to a good start. I’m not going to take any more of your time now. We got some more mandatory talks, but I want you to know, you run the show here, we can talk about whatever troubles you.’’

I nodded, still in shock over this guy’s alternative approach.

‘’And Jake?’’

I stopped and turned around.

‘’Don’t tell anyone I said ‘’bitch’’, ok? I’m told counselors aren’t supposed to use that kind of language.’’

I nodded with a smirk and left his office.

I hadn’t even made it halfway across the schoolyard when Gordy grabbed my arm with a grip like ice.  
“Jake. We need to talk. Now.”

His voice was tight, clipped—none of the usual Gordy calm. He dragged me past the rusted chain-link fence at the edge of campus, into the forgotten scrubland behind the school, where the old train tracks lay buried under weeds and broken glass. Our usual after-school hangout spot.

Dylan and Stump were already there, standing stiff beneath a skeletal tree, their faces drawn, eyes hollow. I instantly felt unease and dread coming along.

“What the hell’s going on?” I asked, heart already picking up pace. Stump wouldn’t meet my gaze. Dylan just stared past me, like something terrible was standing right over my shoulder.

Gordy didn’t answer right away. He reached into his jacket and pulled out a crumpled note, holding it like it might burn him.

“I found this in my locker this morning,” he said. “So did they.” I’m guessing you didn’t check yours.

I unfolded the paper. It was damp, smudged—dark stains had soaked through in places, like it had been written with something thicker than ink.

“Did you all forget? About the garage?  
I haven’t.  
I want to play with your pain.  
I’m hungry for your screams.  
I need your scars.

Here's a question:

What snack is white, red, and resting forever sweet in Monument Park?”

A chill sliced down my spine. I stared at the writing—at the warped, scrawling letters, still faintly glistening—and my mouth went dry.

“What the hell is this written in?” I asked, my voice sounding thin and far away.

“That’s your concern right now?” Gordy snapped. His voice cracked. “Jesus, Jake.”

I looked up. “Someone’s screwing with us. What did that last part even mean? Snack? Monument Park? It makes zero sense!!”

Gordy tried to cut in. ‘’Jake, if you let me talk, I can expl...’’

I pushed him aside. ‘’Shut up, Gords!’’

“Who?” Stump hissed. His voice was unsteady, eyes wild. “Who even knows what happened that night? Who could’ve sent this?”

I backed away from them, my pulse hammering. “No. No, this isn’t real. We all agreed—whatever happened in the garage, it was just… it wasn’t…”

“Jake,” Dylan said, cutting me off. His voice wasn’t angry. It wasn’t sarcastic. It was just… dead. Flat. “It was real. You know it.”

I laughed—but it came out broken. Too sharp, too loud. “You’re all in on this. This is just a sick joke, right? Come on. Say it. You’re screwing with me, just admit it.”

No one moved. No one smiled. Dylan’s eyes gleamed with something close to pity. Stump looked like he was about to cry. Gordy stared at me like I was the one losing my mind.

And suddenly I felt like I couldn’t breathe.

“Stop it!” I snapped. Stop this shit! Tell me you’re joking! Tell me this is just some twisted way to get back at me for that time I locked you all in the basement and played that backstreet boys tape on loop!’’

Dylan stepped forward, slowly and deliberate. He put his arm around me. “Jakey… No one’s joking.”

I shoved him hard. “Liar. You’re all liars—”

“Jake!” Gordy barked, his voice cracking. “This isn’t a game anymore! Some… Someone is threatening us.’’

I looked at him in disbelief. ‘’Someone? Or something? Go on… Say it Gordy. You too Stump and Dylan. Say it! Say what you really mean!’’

Gordy stepped closer, his eyes locked on mine. “You saw it. On the board. You saw what it called itself…”

I saw as his lips formed the name…

Then the world tilted.

The air thickened—sour and electric—as if the wind itself had inhaled a scream and never exhaled. A low, almost imperceptible moan seemed to rise around us, like children wailing and screaming through torn lungs. The stench of something rotten drifted in on the breeze—burned sugar, spoiled milk, and blood.

I stumbled back, nausea swelling. My body knew what my mind refused to admit:  
**This wasn’t a prank.**

We’d awakened something in that garage.  
And as much as we had tried to forget… It remembered us.

Gordy pulled me out of my dread with more terrible news. ‘’Jake, there’s more… I heard my mom and dad talking last night… A boy was found dead near Monument Park yesterday. My dad told my mom he was the one who had to tell the boy’s parents… That…’’

I looked at him. ‘’That what, Gordy? Just tell me.’’

He pushed the words out, like it was some painful chore that just had to be done.

‘’That someone ate part of their son…’’

I felt sick… A snack in Monument Park… This thing had already murdered some poor boy. What were we then? The main course?
