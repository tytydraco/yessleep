The virus had been spreading for weeks, but it wasn't until my parents contracted it that it became real to me. They had been careful, wearing masks and washing their hands constantly, but it didn't matter. The virus had found its way into their bodies, and there was nothing anyone could do to stop it.

I watched as they began to show the first signs of infection. It started with a cough, and then a fever. They became weak and tired, unable to do anything but lay in bed. As the days went by, their symptoms only got worse. The virus had taken hold of them, and it wasn't letting go.

1. Incubation Period: The virus had a long incubation period of up to two weeks, during which time my parents showed no symptoms. It was during this time that they unknowingly spread the virus to others.

2. Early Symptoms: The first signs of the virus were mild, including a cough, fever, and fatigue. My parents thought they just had a cold and didn't take it seriously.

3. Viral Replication: The virus quickly replicated itself, spreading throughout my parents' bodies. It attacked their heart cells, causing them to become inflamed.

4. Immune Response: My parents' immune systems kicked in, trying to fight off the virus. But it was too powerful, and their bodies couldn't keep up.

5. Heart Overload: On the seventh day, my parents' hearts began to overload with blood. It was a gruesome sight to watch as their chests heaved and their veins bulged. They screamed in pain, but there was nothing I could do to help them.

6. Death: And then it was over. Their hearts burst, and they died instantly. It was a bloody, gruesome end to a terrible disease.

The virus was called Hemostrain-19, or H19 for short. It was a highly contagious virus that attacked the heart, causing it to overload with blood and burst after a week of infection. The virus was spread through respiratory droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces, and there was no known cure.

The world was in chaos. Lockdowns were in place, and people were turning to cannibalism due to the lack of food. It was a world I didn't recognize, and I was terrified for my own safety.

As I watched my parents die, I knew I had to survive. I barricaded myself in my house and tried to wait out the virus. But it wasn't long before I started to feel the first signs of infection.

I coughed and felt a fever coming on. I knew what was coming next, and I was terrified. I didn't want to die like my parents did, but I didn't want to turn into a cannibal either.

I tried to fight the virus off, but it was too strong. My heart began to overload, and I felt it getting harder and harder to breathe. And then, just like my parents, my heart burst, and I died.

The virus had won, and there was nothing anyone could do to stop it. The world was a graveyard, and I was just another victim of Hemostrain-19.
