Minimum wage living. That shit is for the birds. Clocking in at some half-filthy fast food restaurant or unloading truckloads of cheap junk into a big box store. Hauling a metric ton of stacked shingles up a rickety ladder in the July heat. Backbreaking labor for the uneducated or recently released felon. I was both.   
  
After a seven-year stretch in one of the state’s most charming maximum security prisons, I found myself desperate for work. As a high school dropout with a list of petty theft and robbery convictions, I managed to shorten my ten-year sentence with good behavior, but I was still stuck with finding “bona fide employment”. Those are the words of the Department of Corrections, not mine.  
  
“They barely pay me anything to babysit you and watch you piss in a cup every week,” Gene Hoskins had said. He was my probation officer and was supposed to help me find a decent gig, but he let me know early on that he wasn’t going to be much help.  “You want work? Hit the unemployment office.”  
  
I played the game, though. Got a little part-time job at a Mom and Pop grocery store in my old neighborhood. Dabenideto’s. The place was an institution in my neck of the woods. Old Man Dabenideto and his wife were so old they probably babysat Jesus, but they were still alive and kicking when I got released and were kind enough to give me twenty hours a week sweeping up and running the register. Pay wasn’t great, but it kept Hoskins off my ass most of the time.  
  
My old man used to take me to the very same shop after school to get a soda and he’d buy one of those scratch-off lotto tickets. We did that every day until he got tossed into the slammer himself. Petty theft and robbery, just like his boy. You see, me and my Pop come from a long line of shitty criminals. Our heart was in it, but our skills never matched. Every man in my family did time as far back as my great-grandfather, so far as I’m aware.  
  
“Ain’t got no guardian angels in this family, Paulie,” my old man would tell me when Ma and I came and saw him every other week in prison. “Ain’t nobody watching out for you but you.”  
  
At least my luck was better than my dad’s. My stint wasn’t too bad. Got a job in the commissary so the other cons tended to like me. Fellas wanted to enjoy staying on the good side of the guy who brought them their snacks and toiletries.  Kept my head down and my nose clean, at least as far as the guards were concerned. A little bit of pot or hooch here and there got a blind eye when you stayed quiet. Passed the damn time, too.  
  
My dad, though, no, not so lucky. Peter Havill was a little man with a big mouth. Got fleeced at a game of cards and lost a few more smokes than he thought was fair. Gave a fella a bit too much lip and got a sharpened toothbrush handle hammered through his eyeball. Ma didn’t mind too much, though. When he died, the government sent a tidy little social security insurance check to the house each month.   
  
“More than he ever did,” she’d say. Damned if she wasn’t right. Pop was too, though. No guardian angels for this family.  
  
The Dabenidetos treated me pretty good, though. At least twenty hours a week, like I said. More if I wanted them. They were old and staying on their feet all day in the little bodega was a lot for them. I’d usually pick up an extra ten hours or so, sometimes a full work week. Things woulda been a lot better if I’d stuck with that, but it didn’t last long. Things took a turn when my old pal Tony popped back into my life.  
  
“Who’s this sad sack of shit?” I heard a familiar voice say from over my shoulder. My head was craned into the cooler pulling gallons of milk to the front. I recognized the nasal tone. Turning toward the voice, I smiled. “I knew it was you, Paulie Havill!”  
  
It was Tony, alright, but he didn’t look like I remembered. We’d been pals since second grade and he’d always been an ox of a kid. Almost six feet by the end of eighth grade and he shot up another half foot before I dropped out my sophomore year. The boy had been a slab of muscle and built like a brick shithouse, but the guy that stood in front of me looked like a scarecrow. If it wasn’t for the black slicked-back hair and shark’s grin, I may not have recognized him.  
  
“Tony Tenant!” I bellowed. “How you been?”  
  
“Better than you, jailbird! Some of the boys from the good old days told me you got picked up a while back. Surprised to see you here keeping shop for Mr. and Mrs. D. Smells like parole requirements to me. Hard for a man to make a decent living with a PO breathing down his back.”  
  
We laughed and gave each other a back-slapping hug before slipping through the front door and lighting up a couple of smokes. Tony jabbered on about some of our old acquaintances and the various prisons they were currently cooling in. I threw back a handful of inflated jail stories myself and he listened and laughed, coughing violently on occasion as plumes of cigarette smoke spilled from his nostrils.  
  
“You ain’t looking so good, Tony,” I said, crushing my cigarette beneath my heel. “Never seen you this thin. You alright?”  
  
“Never better, Paulie,” he said with a smile. A thin circle of blood rimmed his wide nostrils. He dabbed at it with his coat sleeve. “Doing real damn well, as a matter of fact. Been on a bit of a winning streak! May wanna get you in on it.”  
  
I smiled in response, but there was something hollow in his words. The man looked like he was in the late stages of cancer or some other terminal illness. His skin was ashen, all of his bones seemed to be trying to rip out of his skin, and his teeth had gone the worst shade of yellow I’d ever seen. His hair, which looked black from a distance, was heavily peppered with gray streaks.  
  
“If I know you, may not be the kinda winning streak I need to be on. Seems like you and I were in the same line of work, but that ended with me heading upstate for damn near a decade, my man. Can’t go back. You enjoy that winning streak, Tony. I’m gonna stick to stocking shelves here instead of another decade of passing out prison commissary.”  
  
“It’s foolproof, Paulie.” Tony’s eyes locked on mine with an intensity that I’d never seen before. They looked like predators eyes focusing on some poor critter with its head in the grass and ass in the wind. “Meet me at Mahr Park tonight at midnight and I’ll clue you in. You ain’t one to skip out on easy money if I remember.”  
  
“Tony, you had all the luck, but I came up with the short end of the stick.” I gestured to the bodega behind me. “I’m gonna make this work here.”  
  
“Look, I’m just saying this, Paulie,” he responded. “You can spend the next few years wasting away mopping floors and slinging cigarettes to the nobodies wandering around here. You’re gonna die broke and frustrated. What I’m offering you is money. Big money. It’s safe, too. Mahr Park tonight at midnight. If you don’t show up, I get it. Mop floors and sling cigarettes.”  
  
He turned and headed down the block without another word. For a moment, I thought to yell at him and tell him it was past my curfew. My PO could check in on me at any time and I’d be back upstate on a thin bunk mattress trying to ignore the nighttime screams on the cellblock.  
  
I didn’t though, but I wish I had.   
  
\* \* \* \* \*   
  
I turned the lockpick over in my hand beneath the streetlight. It looked simple and unimpressive, the only difference I could see was the sharp spike at the end of the handle. I’d owned at least half a dozen through the years and never had much luck with them. Breaking a window had always been easier, but I guess that’s how I ended up locked away in the first place. Speed was never a replacement for caution, but I had never been able to stick with that line of thought.  
  
“Tony, what the hell am I supposed to do with this?” I said, feeling pissed off. “You told me you had a foolproof gig for us, but you just brought me here to give me a fucking lock pick?”  
  
“It ain’t just a lock pick,” Tony said with a smile. His yellowing teeth looked like sulfur in the street lights. “That thing’ll pick any damn lock you put it in, I guarantee it.”  
  
“I call bullshit,” I spat and pushed the pick back toward him. “I don’t need to get caught with this garbage anyway. My parole officer can smell a problem a mile away. He brags about sending guys back to the pen all the damn time. Jackass would love it if he popped in for a visit and saw this little beauty sitting on my kitchen table.”  
  
“What’ve you got to lose, Paulie? They got you working part-time at a bodega just to stay out of prison. You can’t use a little more cash in those pockets? I’m just trying to help a friend out!”  
  
Tony paced, seeming agitated that I hadn’t accepted the pick like a Godsend. He muttered under his breath as he walked a tight circle. I was getting ready to drop it on the ground and head home when he finally stopped and faced me.  
  
“If it don’t work on your first try, I’ll give you a thousand bucks! Honest to God. There’s an abandoned house just on the other side of the park. You go over there now and try it on the front door. If the lock don’t pop, you get a thousand bucks from me first thing tomorrow. Whadda you say?”  
  
Against my better judgment, I agreed. He beckoned me out of the streetlight and I followed him down the narrow gravel trail through the park. Park was a generous term for the tiny patch of grass and withering trees in the middle of the city, but it was as close as you got living in the center of a major metro area. The sound of sirens from miles away drifted through the calm night air while my head scanned side to side looking for any signs of life.  
  
“There it is,” Tony said, pointing to a solitary row house across the street. It was surrounded on both sides by the crumpled remains of burned-out buildings. I could remember the houses from when I was a kid. All painted bright colors, stoops always littered with kids wasting away summer afternoons. It sent a chill down my damn spine to see the block had burned down while I was locked up. Somehow, it had left the single house standing, its color faded and covered with soot. “Test the handle first so you know I’m not fooling you. It’s locked tight, but that little pick will open it up like a hot knife through butter, Paulie!”  
  
I tried to reply, but my throat was parched and scratchy. It always got that way when I was nervous. Scanning down both sides of the street, I searched again for prying eyes. I expected to see some kid out sneaking a smoke or some old lady walking her dog, but the streets were empty. Nothing but me, Tony, and the ruined old house across the street. My footsteps were audible as I made my way toward the house.  
  
There were only two steps leading up to the concrete slab of the stoop and nothing to block the view on either side, so I sank to one knee and examined the lock. Gripping the knob, I turned it in both directions, but the door didn’t budge. It was locked just like Tony said it would be. After a final test, I decided to give the pick a try. Pulling it from my pocket, I examined it again. The tooling on the end looked too large to slide in the lock, but Tony had seemed so sure it would work that I wanted to give it a try before I went back to tell him how full of shit he had been.  
  
I pushed the end of the pick to the lock and tried to push it in, but it met resistance almost immediately. The tooled end was flexing and bending like it was trying to make its way in, so I decided to give it a little more force. Holding it tightly, I pushed the pick harder against the lock. My hand was sweaty and began to slide down the shaft of the tool when the tiny spike on the end bit into my hand. I winced in pain and was preparing to pull the pick back out when it slid gracefully into the tumbler. Without even wiggling the damn thing once, the lock clicked and the door popped open.  
  
Like a hot knife through butter, Tony had said. He was right. It hadn’t taken any effort after I applied a bit more force, but the spot that the end of the pick left in my hand throbbed like a bee sting. I looked at my hand expecting to see blood but to my surprise, there was only a tiny hole, raw and pink.   
  
“Damn thing works, Tony,” I said in a low voice. “But that spike at the end bit into my damn hand. Why didn’t you file this thing off?”  
  
There was no answer. I pulled the pick from the lock and slid it back into my pocket before standing up. Once I had safely stashed it away, I turned around to find Tony, but there was no one there. The street was completely empty. The sirens that had been far off in the distance seemed much closer than they had been when I first approached the house. Looking down the street, I could see the first sign of strobing red and blue lights bouncing off the wall of one of the burnt-out houses.   
  
My heart began to beat quickly as I realized in just moments a cop would see me standing on the stoop, with a lock pick in my possession. It wasn’t illegal to own one, per se, but any cop with half a brain could string it together that an opened door on an abandoned property probably met that pick at some point. I was just getting ready to run to the other end of the street when the same dull flickers painted the walls of the apartment building across the street.  
  
“*Go into the house*,” a silky voice said from somewhere nearby. I jumped and spun around but there was still no one in sight. The lights of the police cars were getting brighter, the sirens nearly deafening. “*This is a setup courtesy of your ne’er-do-well friend, Anthony Tenant. He has contacted the authorities who will find you in mere moments if you do not go inside. Do you understand me?*”  
  
“If I go in, I’m cornered!” I shouted to the disembodied voice. All logic and reason had fled my mind under the deafening roar of sirens. “I’ve gotta make a break for it.”  
  
“*GO INTO THE HOUSE, FOOL,*” the voice demanded. Mind-numbing pain erupted from my palm where the pick had broken my skin and I fell to one knee clutching my hand to my chest. “*We have work to do and if you aren’t able to follow my simple directions, I will be forced to find another vessel.*”  
  
“Vessel?” I questioned, painting and reeling from the pain in my hand. “What the hell is happening?”  
  
“*Mr. Havill,*” crooned the voice. My hand screamed with pain again and I thought I would vomit or pass out soon if the wave of agony didn’t go away. “*I am usually more in favor of the carrot than the stick, but if you don’t go inside the house, I am afraid the discomfort you are currently feeling is only a trickle of what I am capable of providing.*”  
  
My hand felt like I’d stuck the damn thing in a blender. Looking down at it, I could see that the hole was still no more than a small, dry opening in my palm. From the corners of my eyes, the glint of headlights rounding the corner at the end of the block and turning in my direction sent my pulse racing. With no other choice, I stepped inside the abandoned house. The door slammed behind me and I heard the deadbolt slide in place with a dull crack.  
  
“*Up the stairs, Mr. Havill. I have taken the liberty of locking the door behind us. My connection to the lock will not remain long and I will not be able to keep the inquisitive officers from gaining entry. There is a doorway immediately to the right when you reach the second floor. Go inside and look through the window. Once you see the patrol vehicle pull out of sight, open the window, and move slowly down the fire escape. Walk three blocks in the direction of your boarding house. There will be a police officer on the way who will stop us, but I shall handle that.*”  
  
I opened my mouth to question the voice, to argue in favor of just hiding out until the cops left, but the white-hot pain in my palm made my jaw clench. As quietly as I could, I started to pad up the stairs to the landing and fiddled with the knob to the door on the right. The frame was warped with age and bowed out from water damage, so I threw my shoulder into it, sending the door arching quickly and smacking against the wall. I winced at the noise, afraid the officers outside may have heard me, but it seemed unlikely over the sound of the sirens.  
  
There was a single window in the dusty bedroom covered by a yellowing sheet. The smell of mildew and rot was so thick I could have cut it like a loaf of bread. It was hard to breathe the stagnant air, so I pulled my t-shirt over my mouth. The bright lights of a police car were strobing in the darkness, piercing the dry rotted cloth on the window. It milled slowly down the street, the spotlight sweeping from side to side as they looked for signs of intruders. After scanning the alleyway behind the house, the engine revved and it moved quickly out of sight.  
  
“*Now. The window of escape is short and time is of the essence, Mr. Havill.*”  
  
The cloth fell apart in my hand as I pulled it from the window. There was a dull squeal as I thumbed the rusted window locks open and lifted the bottom pane into the frame into the track above. Looking out, the fire escape had seen better days. Rust, cobwebs, and garbage were strewn all over and there was a section near the end that had been eaten away, leaving a gaping hole leading to the ground two stories below.  
  
“Oh man,” I said aloud. “This damn thing isn’t gonna hold me.”  
  
*“It will hold, but you have to move now, Mr. Havill. The officers are almost through the door and once they set foot on the stairs, your chance will be gone.*”  
  
Ducking my head and lifting a leg, I straddled the window frame and planted a foot on the metal grating outside. It creaked and bowed beneath me as I shifted my weight onto the landing, but it managed to hold together. I inched toward the railing and stepped over the hole in the mesh, vision blurring as I looked at the drop below. Metal buckled and popped as I placed my hands on the ladder and made my way down.  
  
I made contact with the concrete below and bellowed a sigh of relief. Through the open window of the abandoned house, I heard a loud bang and the voice of two police officers asking anyone inside to identify themselves. Their loud footsteps going up the stairs rang out in the alleyway and I made a break for the street, running as hard as I could.  
  
“*I told you to walk, you simpleton.*”  
  
“There are two cops behind me, asshole. You want me to saunter off like I’m heading to the boardwalk? You gotta be crazy.”  
  
“*Mr. Havill, walk or I will be forced to hurt you. Have I led you astray thus far?*”  
  
“No, but I gotta…”  
  
The pain in my palm erupted again and my knees buckled. I fell hard, my face scraping against the concrete and the feeling of hot blood spread across my skin. My whole body ached like I had the flu and I rolled onto my back. The sound of the pursuing police was washed over by a ringing in my ears. The pressure in my head was building to a crescendo and I felt like my temples were going to pop.  
  
“*Up. Walk. Slowly. I had so hoped you would be a bit more intelligent than Mr. Tenant, but I see that my hopes were all for naught*.”  
  
My head felt clear again and the pain in the rest of my body drifted away, leaving only the sharp sting from the scrape on the side of my face. My feet stumbled to life and I walked slowly, dabbing at my cheek and pulling my hand away to see fresh blood under the streetlights. I brushed at the wound again, knocking away dirt and a small rock that had dug into my skin.  
  
“*Take a left at the end of the alley and walk three blocks. The police officer I spoke of will be standing on the corner. When he sees you, do not attempt to flee. I will get us out of this.*”  
  
“What the hell are you, man?”  
  
“*Be quiet and walk, fool. We will have endless time to speak when we are in the safe confines of your boarding house.*”  
  
“I ain’t doing shit else you tell me until you tell me what you are. I don’t know why I’m even talkin’ to you. One of my screws is loose and I’m losin’ my damn mind!”  
  
“*I assure you that while you are not mentally ill, you are not an ideal vessel. I am a passenger with a noisy means of conveyance at the moment, now shut your mouth. The officer is just ahead and I will need to attend to him.*“  
  
I could see them just ahead, standing in the dull glow of a flickering streetlight. The tail end of a police cruiser poked out from the side of a house and the officer was leaning against it, looking down at his cell phone. My throat felt dry and I began to slow my pace for a moment, but a small throb of pain in my palm spurred me forward. A rock skipped down the sidewalk, knocked away by my foot. It caught his attention immediately.  
  
“‘Ey!” he shouted and started walking in my direction. I saw him unclip the holster of his gun and rest his palm on the butt of the pistol. “Come on over here nice and slow, sir. Little bit late to be out for a stroll, don’t cha think?”  
  
“*My apologies, officer,*” the voice said through my mouth. My heart hammered against my chest. I tried to stop walking, but I no longer had control of my body. “*My vehicle is not currently in an operable state and I was forced to take the pedestrian route to my place of employment.*”  
  
“Why are you talkin’ like that, huh?” the cop asked, his body tensing. “Why don’t cha stop right where you are and show me some ID? Get it out real slow. No surprises, you hear?”  
  
My body stopped and I could feel my left arm rise slowly in the air and the right slipped behind me to fish my wallet from my back pocket. My hand rested on the dull leather and froze. Sweat was beading on my forehead, not out of nervousness, but from a sudden rise in body temperature. Suddenly I felt like I had the worst cold of my life. My body was covered in perspiration and my shirt was clinging to my chest.  
  
“Unless you want me to get nervous, you better get that ID,” the cop said again, his hand wrapping around the handle of the gun. If I had control over my body, I would have pissed my pants.  
  
“*Mr. Havill, I am going to need you to go to sleep for a brief period. We will talk after I have completed my interaction with this man. I shall get us back to your abode.*”  
  
“Who you talking to, freakshow?” the cop said.
