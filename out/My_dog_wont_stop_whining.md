We knew when we adopted him he had some health problems. They got worse before they got better, but with enough money, and more than one sleepless night in a vet’s ER waiting room, he healed up pretty well. Once he put some weight on, grew some fur back, and settled into our home he was the perfect dog. Always happy, never barked, was perpetually good spirited and still is consistently an amazing companion. 



He’s a great dog, but by that point nothing could have saved our relationship. It’s not relevant to the story, but I fucked up, went off my meds, and before long my ex and I had split ways. My work schedule didn’t let me provide for the care the dog needed so it was an easy decision to let the ex take him full time. 



From the start she was always worrying about me. My schedule didn’t let me take the dog much, but when I could I’d let her give him to me for the  weekends so he could enjoy his old yard and we could together revisit the miles of trails in the park the three of us used to live by.



Recently, my work schedule cleared up and I took the week off to relax. I thought spending as much time outdoors as I could and enjoying the spring weather with the dog would let me get ahead of my depression. 



His behavior was completely fine up until the night I drank too much. 



The preceding afternoon I had to clear my head and we went on a long walk. Maybe I dragged him too far. He tried his best to keep up. He was a much better walker before he spent so much time alone with my ex. 



Once we got home I filled up his water and let him relax out on the patio. He rested, panting happily outside while I kept trying to take my mind off of things. 



I don’t do this often anymore, but despite the long walk I was still feeling pretty shitty and found myself dipping into the liquor cabinet. I don’t remember much else from that night except when, some hours later, I put my gun into my mouth. I’m almost positive it wasn’t loaded. 



It’s not too uncommon for me to blackout. I’ve never done anything bad, and even now as I write it, the gun thing doesn’t scare me much. I get sad and go to bed– without fail. I’d never hurt myself and I’d never, ever, ever hurt my dog. 



The problem is, after our walk two nights ago, and since I woke up the morning after my drinking, he won’t stop whining. It’s more like a continuous yowl.  



My depression is worse than ever and I’ve used all my strength to try and make sure his food and water bowls are full. The side door is open and he can go potty if he needs.  I just don’t have the energy anymore to get out of bed to try and calm him. Instead of his normal, happy, wiggly, self it’s been two full days of his crying.  



All he does is lay at the foot of my bloody bed and loudly moan. It’s been days now. 



I try to reach out and pet and soothe him and tell him that he is such a good, good boy but he just won’t stop crying and crying and crying.



If any of you know what is wrong with my dog please reach out, I am so desperate for your help.
