Hi, first of all, this is my first post. I'm new in this community so I apologize for any mistake I could make sharing this matter that is happening right now.

Pd. I'm not a native English speaker so sorry for any inconveniences reading this.

I'll start, since June 2024 I moved into my own house, I'm a 29yo male that does a blue collar job. Here were I live salaries are... Shiete. So I got an opportunity to get a very cheap house near a factory complex, I literally doesn't have neighbors because in front of my house there's a large depot that belongs to these factories.

Since let's say, late January or early February I'll be getting some random hits at my front door at night, it's always one knock, sometimes it's two but not more. My dog becomes berserk and when I get up to see anything on my front window I see nothing.

So, as I'm writing this, it's just happened again, it's not every night and is not in the exact moment. I don't know what to do because if I get ready to confront this guy I have to be awaken all night, all nights. And I have to work early in the morning so it's frustrating. 

I have a weapon, my dog, and my little house is full protected with barrels and locks. Nobody can get inside, even less from the front door, it's literally zombie proofed.

At the very front of my door that goes to the street there's a little field with a couple of trees. One of them loses all it's leafs so you can hear the bastard when he goes away running. 

If I hunt him down it could be a disaster, and here police doesn't break a sweat for anything that's not "really gruesome".

I will try to put cameras outside, maybe at least this will show me how the f**ker looks like. But believe me, Im currently living in Latin America and we barricade our homes to the extreme because it's very hum.... Horrid outside at night some places have literally no law and it feels like The Purge, if you don't believe me you can see it in YouTube
.... so there's no chance this guy will break into my house, and if he does, hell will let lose. 

At some point I believed this was a joke from a worker wandering the street on his way home,

But it's still happening after almost three months. 




Pd: they removed my first try to post.... Uh .. this post because I could get it to five hundred words but I can't add more information because it will be just something that I invented, I can't give you guys more information and it could be that bastard maybe is a redditor reading this and laughing his ass off.

So here's a little story on my trip to Murica. 
I was in the US one time, and I love it. My wish is to go back again and drive a HD to Daytona Bike Week to meet with my NC (North Carolina) based girl. I meet her in a bikini bike wash from a HD franchise in there, Gator Harley Davidson. Blonde, tall, skinny with a southern way of speak, parents were from WV, and was always extremely cherish, funny and overall happy (for anyone wondering she had a two part black bikini like the rest of the girls). She washed my bike, tell her I love her ( I drank couple beers), she said to go back again and say hi with my rented bike (lol) and at the fourth day I got a date with her to a local restaurant. 

Since that day I was in constant contact with her and I hope in the nearly future I got to see her again. Loved it there, but Daytona in Bike Week was expensive as hell mate
