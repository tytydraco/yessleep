I never thought I'd be writing something like this. My hands are shaking as I type, and I'm not sure how much time I have left. But I need to share our story, to warn others, and maybe, just maybe, someone out there can help. My name is Lily, and I'm a 22-year-old anthropology student from the University of Chicago. What started as an exciting research trip through Eastern Europe with my brother, Jake, has turned into a living nightmare. We're trapped in a situation that I can't even begin to fully comprehend, and I fear that Jake might already be... No, I can't think about that right now. I have to focus on getting help.

It all began eight months ago. I'd been awarded a prestigious grant to study ancient harvest rituals across Eastern Europe for my thesis. The plan was to backpack through Romania, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, and finally, Albania, visiting remote villages and documenting traditions that had been passed down for generations. I spent months preparing, poring over old texts, learning basic phrases in multiple languages, and plotting out my route on detailed maps.

My parents were worried, of course. "It's not safe," my mom said, her brow furrowed with concern. "You can't go alone to those remote areas." That's when Jake, my 24-year-old brother, stepped in. He had just finished his master's in environmental science and was looking for an adventure before starting his PhD. "I'll go with her," he said, throwing an arm around my shoulders. "We'll look out for each other."

With Jake by my side, our parents reluctantly agreed. We set off together, our backpacks loaded with gear and our hearts full of excitement. Jake had always been my protector, my best friend. Having him with me made me feel invincible.

The first six months were incredible. We started in Romania, exploring the Carpathian Mountains and the villages nestled in their valleys. I interviewed elderly women who still practiced traditional weaving techniques, their gnarled hands creating intricate patterns passed down through centuries. Jake, with his environmental background, was fascinated by the sustainable farming practices that had been used for generations.

In Bulgaria, we witnessed a fire-walking ritual that left us breathless, the air thick with the scent of burning embers and chanted prayers. Jake and I held hands as we watched, feeling the heat on our faces and the energy of the crowd pulsing around us. 

North Macedonia brought us to tiny communities perched on the shores of Lake Ohrid, where fishermen shared tales of water spirits and sacred springs. Jake would often sketch the landscapes while I conducted interviews, his artistic talents capturing the beauty of our surroundings in a way my words never could.

With each stop, my notebooks filled with observations, sketches, and transcribed stories. Jake kept a detailed journal of the flora and fauna we encountered, as well as the traditional ecological knowledge passed down through generations. We felt like we were peeling back layers of history, uncovering the threads that connected these diverse cultures to their ancient roots.

We were riding high on the success of our trip when we entered Albania in late September. The country was even more beautiful than we had imagined – rugged mountains, dense forests, and tiny villages that seemed frozen in time. Our final destination was supposed to be a small village called Rrogam, nestled deep in the northern Albanian Alps. Local folklore suggested they still practiced harvest rituals dating back to pre-Christian times.

On October 3rd, we set out from the last major town, armed with our backpacks, a detailed map, and the excitement of potentially making a significant discovery. The hike was challenging but breathtaking. Autumn had painted the landscape in vibrant reds and golds, and the air was crisp and invigorating. As we climbed higher into the mountains, the forests gradually gave way to rocky slopes and alpine meadows.

I remember pausing around midday to eat our packed lunch, perched on a boulder overlooking a stunning valley. Mist clung to the distant peaks, and we could hear the faint tinkling of sheep bells from somewhere below. Jake pulled out his sketchbook and began to capture the scene, his brow furrowed in concentration.

"You know," he said, looking up at me with a grin, "I think this might be the most beautiful place we've seen yet."

I nodded, taking a deep breath of the clean mountain air. "It's perfect," I agreed. "I feel like we've stepped back in time."

If only we'd known then how prophetic those words would turn out to be.

As the afternoon wore on, we began to worry that we'd taken a wrong turn somewhere. The path we were following grew fainter, eventually disappearing altogether. We pulled out our map and compass, trying to get our bearings, but the terrain didn't seem to match what we were seeing on paper. The sun was sinking lower, painting the sky in brilliant shades of orange and pink, and we knew we needed to find shelter soon.

That's when we heard it – a rustling in the underbrush behind us. We turned, expecting to see a deer or maybe a fox, but there was nothing there. Just shadows lengthening between the trees. An uneasy feeling settled in the pit of my stomach. Jake must have felt it too, because he reached for my hand, giving it a reassuring squeeze.

"Let's pick up the pace," he said, his voice low. "I don't like the feel of this place after dark."

We quickened our steps, hoping to find a clearing or some sign of the village. But the forest seemed to grow denser, the shadows deeper. The temperature was dropping rapidly, and I could see our breath misting in the air.

I'll never forget what happened next. One moment we were walking, and the next, the ground simply vanished beneath our feet. We found ourselves tumbling down a steep, rocky slope, desperately trying to grab onto something, anything, to stop our fall. I could hear Jake shouting my name, but I couldn't see him through the tangle of limbs and backpack straps.

There was a moment of searing pain as my leg twisted unnaturally, then my head struck something hard, and everything went black.

I'm not sure how long I was unconscious. When I came to, the world was a haze of pain and confusion. I was lying at the bottom of a ravine, my backpack a few feet away, its contents strewn across the forest floor. My left leg was definitely broken – I could see the unnatural angle it was bent at – and I had cuts and bruises all over. The metallic taste of blood filled my mouth, and when I reached up to touch my head, my fingers came away sticky and red.

"Jake?" I called out, my voice weak and trembling. "Jake, where are you?"

I heard a groan from nearby, and relief flooded through me. Jake was alive. I turned my head and saw him a few yards away, struggling to sit up. He looked as battered as I felt, with a nasty gash across his forehead and his right arm cradled against his chest.

"Lily," he gasped, crawling towards me. "Are you okay? God, your leg..."

"I think it's broken," I said, gritting my teeth against the pain. "What about you? Your arm..."

"Pretty sure it's dislocated," he grimaced. "But I'll live. We need to get help."

Jake managed to retrieve our phones, but as we feared, there was no signal. The screens were cracked, but miraculously, they still turned on. Not that it did us much good in this remote wilderness.

Night was falling fast, and the temperature was plummeting. We huddled together for warmth, using what was left of our supplies to try and make a shelter. But we were both injured and exhausted, and I could feel myself slipping in and out of consciousness.

"Stay with me, Lil," Jake kept saying, his voice tight with pain and worry. "Help will come. We just have to hold on."

I don't know how long we lay there, drifting in and out of consciousness, getting colder and more terrified by the minute. I remember Jake trying to keep me awake by asking me questions about my research, making me recite the names of the villages we'd visited. But his voice was getting weaker, and I could feel him shivering violently against me.

As the pain and cold intensified, a strange calm settled over me. I remember thinking, "This can't be how it ends. Not after everything we've seen and done." I closed my eyes, listening to Jake's labored breathing and the wind rustling through the trees, wondering if anyone would ever find our bodies.

That's when we heard the voices.

At first, I thought I must be hallucinating. But then I saw the flickering light of a lantern, and two figures emerged from the darkness. An elderly couple, bundled up against the cold, peered down at us with concerned expressions. The woman said something in Albanian, then switched to broken English when she saw our blank looks.

"Oh, poor children," she said, her voice warm and grandmotherly. "What happened to you? Don't worry, we help."

I tried to speak, to ask who they were and where they'd come from, but all that came out was a weak groan. Jake managed to croak out a plea for help. The man knelt beside us, his weathered hands gently probing our injuries. He spoke to the woman rapidly in Albanian, then turned to us with a kind smile.

"Is okay," he said. "We take you home, make you better."

I wanted to protest, to ask them to call for proper medical help, but we were in no position to argue. With surprising strength for their age, they managed to lift us between them. The pain of being moved was excruciating, and I must have passed out again because the next thing I knew, I was lying in a soft bed, staring up at wooden beams crossing a low ceiling.

Jake was in a bed next to mine, his arm now in a makeshift sling. He looked pale and drawn, but he was awake and alert. When he saw me looking at him, he managed a weak smile.

"Hey, sis," he said. "Looks like we found our village after all."

We spent the next few days drifting in and out of consciousness, our world narrowed to a haze of pain and feverish dreams. The elderly couple – who introduced themselves as Mira and Zef – tended to us constantly. Mira changed our bandages and spoon-fed us hearty soups and herbal teas that tasted strange but seemed to dull the pain. Zef set my broken leg and Jake's dislocated shoulder with practiced ease, using what looked like hand-carved wooden splints.

As we began to regain our senses, we took in our surroundings. We were in a rustic farmhouse, all rough-hewn wood and hand-woven textiles. Bundles of dried herbs hung from the rafters, filling the air with a pungent, earthy scent. There was no sign of modern amenities – no electricity, no running water, not even a radio. When we asked about calling for help or going to a hospital, Mira and Zef just shook their heads.

"No hospital close," Zef explained. "Very far. You stay, we make you better."

We were too weak to argue, and honestly, their care did seem to be helping. The pain was gradually subsiding, and we could feel our strength returning bit by bit. Mira's herbal remedies worked wonders, easing our pain and bringing down the fever. We found ourselves feeling intensely grateful for their kindness.

As the days passed and we were able to stay awake for longer periods, Mira and Zef would sit with us, telling us stories about the local area and its history. Their English was limited, but between that, our few words of Albanian, and a lot of gesturing, we managed to communicate. They told us they had lived in these mountains their whole lives, rarely venturing into the larger towns. They seemed fascinated by our stories of the outside world, listening with rapt attention when we talked about our studies and our travels.

It was during one of these conversations, about a week after our accident, that I first noticed something... odd. I was telling them about my research into harvest rituals, and I mentioned a particular tradition I'd read about involving the sacrifice of a young animal to ensure a good crop.

The moment the word "sacrifice" left my lips, I saw something flicker in their eyes. It was just for a split second, but their expressions changed, becoming almost hungry. Zef leaned forward, suddenly intense.

"You know of old ways?" he asked, his voice low and eager. "Of... giving life for life?"

A chill ran down my spine, though I couldn't have said why. I laughed nervously, trying to brush it off. "Oh, you know, just old stories. Nothing people really believe anymore."

Mira and Zef exchanged a look I couldn't quite interpret. Then Mira smiled, patting my hand. "Is good you learn old ways," she said. "Very important, not to forget."

The conversation moved on, but that moment stuck with me. It was the first time I felt a flicker of unease about our situation. I glanced at Jake, wondering if he had noticed anything, but he was engrossed in a book Zef had lent him about local plant life.

I told myself I was being silly, letting my imagination run wild after all those folklore stories. Mira and Zef had been nothing but kind to us. They were just a harmless old couple, probably excited to talk to someone new after being isolated for so long.

Still, other little things started to nag at me. We were sleeping much more than usual, 12 to 14 hours a day, but somehow still felt exhausted all the time. And I was having these vivid, terrifying nightmares. In them, I'd see Mira and Zef standing over our beds, but they looked... wrong. Their faces were twisted and inhuman, with huge black eyes and mouths full of needle-like teeth. I'd try to scream but couldn't make a sound. Then I'd feel this horrible draining sensation, like my very life force was being sucked out of me.

I'd wake up in a cold sweat, heart pounding, the images still vivid in my mind. But in the light of day, with Mira bringing us tea and Zef telling us another one of his endless stories, it was easy to dismiss the dreams as nothing more than trauma from the accident playing tricks on my mind.

But other strange things kept happening. Our belongings would disappear and reappear in odd places. We'd hear whispering and footsteps at night when Mira and Zef were supposedly asleep. Sometimes we'd catch glimpses of movement out of the corner of our eyes, but when we turned to look, there was nothing there.

The most unsettling thing, though, was how quickly we were healing. My broken leg, which should have taken weeks to mend, was almost completely fine after just a few days. Jake's dislocated shoulder seemed to have healed overnight. At first, we thought maybe Mira's herbal remedies really were some kind of miracle cure. But as the days went on and we felt simultaneously better and worse – our injuries healing but our overall energy depleting – a creeping sense of wrongness began to take hold.

I tried to talk to Jake about it, but he seemed... different. More distant, less interested in leaving. "Maybe we should stay a while longer," he'd say, his eyes slightly unfocused. "There's so much we could learn here."

I tried to rationalize it. Maybe we were having some kind of delayed stress reaction to the accident. Maybe being cut off from the outside world was making us paranoid. But I couldn't shake the feeling that something was very, very off about this whole situation.

One night, about two weeks after our accident, I woke up suddenly, my heart racing. The house was eerily quiet, but I had the overwhelming sense that I wasn't alone. I lay perfectly still, hardly daring to breathe, and that's when I saw it – a shadow moving across the wall, cast by no visible source. It seemed to pause at the foot of my bed, looming over me, and I felt a wave of cold wash over my body.

I must have made a sound because suddenly Mira was there, her face concerned in the dim light. "Bad dream?" she asked, smoothing my hair back from my forehead. Her hand felt ice-cold against my skin. I nodded, not trusting myself to speak. She smiled, but in the shadows, it looked more like a grimace, her teeth too sharp and too numerous. "Sleep now," she said. "All better in morning."

But things weren't better in the morning. I felt weaker than ever, my limbs heavy and my mind foggy. When I looked in the small mirror hanging on the wall, I hardly recognized myself. My skin was pale and waxy, my eyes sunken and dull. I looked like I'd aged years in just a few weeks.

Jake didn't look much better. His once vibrant green eyes seemed dull and lifeless, and he moved with a sluggishness that was completely unlike him. But when I tried to talk to him about leaving, he just shook his head.

"We can't leave yet, Lily," he said, his voice flat. "There's still so much to learn."

That's when I knew we had to get out, no matter what. I waited until Jake was asleep, then crept downstairs to confront Mira and Zef. I found them in the kitchen, speaking in low, urgent tones. When they saw me, they fell silent, their faces a mixture of concern and something else... hunger?

"We need to leave," I said, trying to keep my voice steady. "Thank you for your help, but it's time for us to go home."

Their reaction was... not what I expected. Mira's usually warm face clouded over, and Zef's eyes took on that strange, hungry look I'd seen before. They began talking rapidly in Albanian, their tones urgent and angry. When they turned back to me, their smiles seemed forced.

"Is not safe," Zef said, his voice stern. "Many dangers in forest. You stay until fully better."

I insisted that we were fine, that we needed to go. That's when Zef grabbed my arm. His grip was impossibly strong, his fingers digging into my flesh hard enough to bruise. For a split second, I swear his eyes turned completely black, pupil and iris and whites all swallowed by darkness.

"You stay," he said, and it wasn't a request.

I backed down, terrified by the sudden change in him. As soon as I agreed to stay, they both relaxed, acting like nothing had happened. Mira busied herself making tea, humming softly, while Zef went outside to chop wood. I retreated to our room, my mind racing.

Jake was still asleep when I got back, but he looked... wrong. His skin was almost translucent, and I could see dark veins pulsing beneath the surface. I tried to wake him, but he just mumbled incoherently and turned away.

That night, I made a decision. We had to get out of there, no matter what. I waited until the house was silent, then gently shook Jake awake. "We have to go," I whispered urgently. "Now."

Jake's eyes fluttered open, but they were unfocused, almost glazed over. "Go?" he mumbled. "But we can't leave. They need us."

"Who needs us, Jake?" I asked, a chill running down my spine. "Mira and Zef? They're not what they seem. We have to leave!"

But Jake just shook his head and closed his eyes again. With a sinking heart, I realized I would have to try to escape alone and then come back for him with help.

I crept downstairs as quietly as I could. I had just reached the back door when I heard it – a soft scratching sound, like claws on wood. I turned slowly, my heart pounding.

Mira and Zef stood at the foot of the stairs, but they weren't the kindly old couple I'd come to know. Their bodies were twisted and elongated, limbs bent at impossible angles. Their skin was a sickly gray, stretched tight over protruding bones. Their faces... God, their faces. Their mouths had split open vertically, lined with rows of jagged teeth. And their eyes were just empty black pits, like holes cut into reality.

I ran. Somehow, I made it out the door and into the woods. I could hear them coming after me, their movements unnaturally fast and fluid, like smoke drifting between the trees. I ran until my lungs were bursting, then hid in a hollow log, praying they wouldn't find me.

I must have passed out from sheer terror and exhaustion because the next thing I knew, I was back in the farmhouse. But not in our room – in the cellar. It's dark down here, and it smells like decay and something copp
