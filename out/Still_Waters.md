People say Lady Bird Lake is peaceful. That it’s good for your mental health to walk the trail in the mornings, breathe deep, sweat it out, clear your head. I’ve lived in Austin my whole damn life, and let me tell you something: that lake’s not peaceful. It’s quiet. There’s a difference.

Peace doesn’t come with six bodies in eight months.

They all floated in the same way — facedown, arms at their sides like they’d just given up. Not a single sign of trauma. All were found early morning, east of the I-35 bridge, down by the reeds where nobody jogs because it smells like dead fish and shame. No IDs. No next of kin. Just statistics in a city that likes to pretend it’s too weird for evil.

I wasn’t supposed to work the case. They assigned it to Violent Crimes, but the first one? The first floater? That was my sister’s kid, Levi. I identified the body. Didn’t tell the chief. Just started showing up where I wasn’t supposed to be.

They called the killer “The Waterman.” As if giving him a nickname made it all feel less real. Like he was folklore. An urban legend. Some Reddit creepypasta. But Levi was real. So were the others.

And then number seven washed up — and he was still alive.

Barely breathing, clothes torn, eyes wild like he’d seen God and been disappointed. He didn’t talk for two days. When he did, he gripped my wrist like I was his last lifeline and said:

“I think he’s from the past.”

I thought maybe he meant the guy dressed old-school. Fedora, trench coat, whatever. But then he said, “I saw a sign behind him that said ‘East Avenue.’ Not I-35. East Avenue.”

I stopped cold.

You’d have to be a local — and old — to know that East Avenue was what they called I-35 before the 1970s. It ran right through black neighborhoods they bulldozed to make the highway. My granddad used to call it “the scar that split the city.”

I hit the archives. City maps, missing persons, newspaper clippings yellowed with time and tobacco smoke. And there it was: five people drowned in ’67. Same spot. Same M.O. All ruled accidental. Except there were whispers, even then, about a maintenance man — Ellis Ray Kirkwood — who vanished right after the last death.

They never found him. Never found anything, actually, but his name popped up in one article. And when I saw the sketch? My spine went to ice. It was the same guy I’d seen weeks ago walking the trail. He even nodded at me, like we’d met before.

That’s when I started camping out down by the lake. Took my recorder, a bottle of bourbon, and just listened. I wasn’t sure what I was looking for until I saw it: a glow under the water. Not a reflection. Not a spotlight. It looked like a submerged streetlamp. Pale yellow. Flickering.

I stepped in.

I don’t know what I expected — maybe death. Instead, I got… Austin. But not my Austin. No skyline. No condos. No Teslas. Just low buildings, wide cars, and a haze in the air that tasted like leaded gas and cigarette smoke.

A paper blew across my feet: Austin Statesman, July 9, 1968.

I wasn’t dreaming. I was in it.

I wandered up the bank and saw a man dragging a girl by the wrist. She was young. Scared. I yelled. He turned.

Same face.

Ellis Ray Kirkwood.

I didn’t think. I ran, tackled him. We hit the dirt. He hissed something I didn’t catch, and then—FLASH. Like someone ripped the sky open.

Next thing I know, I’m choking on lake water, alone on the shore. Back in my time.

But now things are different.

Bodies stopped washing up.

For a while.

Until last week. Young guy. Face-down. In his pocket? A 1966 bus ticket. Fresh ink. Perfect condition. From a company that stopped running fifty years ago.

Someone’s still crossing over.

And I think they know I followed them.

Now, every time I look at the lake, I see that yellow light flicker just under the surface. Like it’s waiting.

Maybe next time I go in, I’ll stay.

Or maybe I’ll drag Kirkwood back with me.

Either way, this isn’t over.

And the water’s not done with me yet.
