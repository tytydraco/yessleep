The Grey Hills Home for Boys was perfectly unpleasant in every way - the secrets it hid were just some of them.

But you learned in foster care that you didn’t complain - not even in the worst homes. If you did, you were beaten, starved, or worse. At Grey Hills, they only had to give us kids one warning: Mrs. Blanche.

No one quite knows why people are so afraid of Mrs. Blanche. The older boys said she was a vampire, who once a year took the nastiest boys at our home as a human sacrifice. Others, say she was a ghost as old as the dilapidated, unkempt home itself - and if you made eye contact wi the her she stole your soul. Some said she was just a nasty old witch that you didn’t want to be on the bad side on.

But there was one thing they all agreed on, the tall, the small, the young, the old, the well behaved and the misbehaved…

If you went to the forbidden third floor at exactly four o’clock, you were never heard from again.

I was fifteen years old, and a “problem child” when they dared me to do it. Tommy, the oldest boy at the home at nearly 18, and his cronies, Butch and Ace. They saw the “tough boy” attitude and decided to make it a test. If I survived the night, they told me, I’d be cool enough to hang out with them.

I hadn’t quite decided if I wanted to, if I’m being quite honest. But none-the-less, I didn’t like being challenged. And so, at exactly 2:55AM I ascended the dark, creaky wooden staircase in the pitch dark. 

In the middle of the night, the two hundred year old home seemed spookier. During the day its pastel colored walls and bright lighting gave it an almost homey feel. But at night, the lack of light sources made it almost seem like a dungeon. 

I tried to steel my nerves, as hard as it may have been. I could feel my heart racing as though I’d run a half marathon as the gravity of what I was doing sank in. Mrs. Blanche may have been an old urban legend, but it was one of the expressed rules of the home to never, under any circumstances go to the third floor. It was my tenth home in six years now, and the thought of being kicked out nearly froze me in my tracks.

Truth was, I wanted a family, more than anything. I would never say it aloud but it was the reason for my temper, and devil-may-care attitude. But at fifteen, it seemed little more than a daydream I reminded myself. No matter how many social workers promised my happy ending the truth was I was simply not going to have one.

So I simply didn’t care anymore. 

At exactly four o’clock I opened the old door to the third floor, rusted over with age, wood splintering, lock broken. And as I expected to see only darkness and dust - I saw something else instead: paradise.

The room was draped in a bright light, illuminating something wonderful. It was as if Christmas and Thanksgiving had come all at once. A long table, lined with food, candy, gifts, and all the trimmings laid before me. It’s warm red walls inviting and colorful. It was more food, more toys, more sweets than I had ever seen in my life.

And without a doubt, I knew it to be a trap.

It reminded me of an old story: Hansel and Gretel. Things that are sweet and inviting, in my experience are never what they seem. And for that matter, what would all of this be doing in an old house falling apart at the seams?

None-the-less, I took a small step inside and looked it over carefully. There was nothing inherently off about the decor, nor the food. And when I’d looked back to check, nothing abnormal had happened: the door hadn’t locked, it hadn’t disappeared as you’d so often believe by this point. It remained open for me to flee at any time.

It left me a single question: what was happening here?

It was then I noticed the neatly folded letter at the head of the table. It may have been a big mistake, I believed. But on the other hand, it was, as they say, curiosity that killed the cat. Instead of walking right out, I took that paper - and decided now was the time to leave. With this as proof I had done as they asked.

The room let me leave, and I will never understand why. There was no Mrs. Blanche, no deadly curse, no evil spirit… But there was an uneasy dread that crept over me long before I descended the stairs and found the home empty.

Not just of children, or workers, mind you.  But abandoned, empty, as if everyone and everything had vanished in the night. Panic set in about that time, as I rushed out the front door and into the still night air. But the home was not all that changed…

Where there had been a long dirt road now stood a firm black surface. Where there had been trees, now stood tall buildings, and on our once quiet road a blinding light of some sort of vehicle hit me long before I felt my body hit the ground and my vision grow dark.

They told me I’d been missing one hundred years. Told me that Grey Hills had been abandoned after World War II. They kept my name out of the paper, kept my story under lock and key, and when I was released from their hospital - they put me back into foster care. In a world I barely knew anymore, a world that had forgotten me, the old house, and the story of the forbidden third floor.

I live in 2025 now, or so they tell me. It’s been three years since that day, and while I’ve adapted and moved past my fear and shock… A new fear has replaced it. Because if you thought time travel was the twist of my little fable, you’d be wrong.

It started when I found the note hidden in my things:

“Take something, or she follows you there.”

I didn’t understand it until a week later when I saw her for the first time. A woman with matted hair, greenish hued skin, and a tattered dress made from what I can unmistakably describe as human flesh. She watches me from the corner of every corner, of every house, pearly white fangs barred in a smile that would be inviting if she wasn’t so unsettling.

Every year she gets a little closer, her sharp, dazzling red eyes get a little sharper. Her grin, impossibly wide a little nastier. This year, I woke up to find her at the foot of my bed, watching me with a look that told me whatever horrible thing Mrs. Blanche has planned for me… My time is up.

So if any of you so-called urban explorers decide to explore the old Grey Hills Home for Boys… If you dare go up to the forbidden floor. Don’t make the same mistake I did…

Take something, or she follows you there.
