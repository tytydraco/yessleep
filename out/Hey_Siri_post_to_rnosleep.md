Fuck. Okay, I hope this works. Sorry for formatting, I guess, I'm not sure how this will turn out.

I don’t remember falling asleep, but when I woke up, I was in the Red Barn theatre - it's a small, single-screen movie theatre that has only one door, used to both enter and exit the screen. 

If you want to see the movie, you have to queue up outside to buy the ticket. *Outside,* outside. Anyway, sometimes, during winter, the temperature can drop to negative 30 degrees celsius. Although I *think* it’s winter, I can’t be sure. Surprisingly, it's quite toasty in here. But that might be something to do with the fact that we are packed in here like sardines. 

The screen actually looks really far away now that I think about it. 

Anyway, if it was summer, I’d feel the sweat running down my back, so I reckon it’s winter… although I suppose it could be spring or… what’s the other one? Autumn. Oh right, I guess it could be autumn?

I don’t feel anything, now that I think about it. 

So listen to this, I get a feeling like I’ve been here before, deja vu - right? But… in fact, wait… what time is it? I don’t know - my watch isn’t working. Damn thing’s out of battery again, but I don’t think I could tell even if it were working. 

Look, this is going to sounds fucked because it is. It’s *fucking with my head*. 

Basically, I just noticed the guy to my left is wearing the same pants as me. They’re those tan khakis that everyone above the age of 25 seems to own. 

Well, he’s clearly got a good sense of style. Man’s wearing the blue version of my shirt. 

So I go to nudge him to point it out, I thought, *maybe he’ll find it amusing too.* 

I elbow him, but as I do, someone elbows *me* on my right arm. I turn to look, but the guy is looking in the other direction. 

What a coincidence, though!!!! 

*He’s* wearing my red shirt *and* has the same colour khakis as me! 

I poke him in the arm.

As I poke the guy on my right, the guy in the blue shirt pokes me on my left arm. 

‘Hey man.’ I say as I turn back to look at him. But he’s looking the other direction now.

‘Hey man.’

‘Hey man.’

‘Hey man.’ rippled through the theatre. In fact its getting really hard to keep talking, I can't concentrate on what I'm saying. I looked at the guy in front of me. I tapped him on the shoulder. At the same time, someone taps *me* on the shoulder. I turn around, but the guy behind me is looking behind him. In fact, all the way up the auditorium, the people are looking at the person behind them. 

Wait. 

What. The. Actual. Fuck. *Right*?

It’s me. 

*Yep.*

They’re me.

I mean, I’m sure they are. They’re saying everything I’m saying.

I look at the guy to my left again. He’s looking to his left. I lean forward to see what he’s looking at. At the same time, he leans forward. 

Shit. 

I know I didn’t take any shrooms before I came here.

Man, I don’t even *like* this cinema. Why would I come here?

More importantly, *why the fuck can I see hundreds of me?* 

You know what? Fuck it, I’m going to walk towards the exit. Shit I can’t. The guy in front of me, *the me in front of me,* can't get past the me, in front of him. 

I’m stuck. 

Fuck. 

*Fuck.* 

‘Fuck.’

‘Fuck.’

‘Fuck.’

‘Fuck.’

‘Fuck.’

‘Fuck.’

I just got my phone out of my pocket, every *single* one of me followed suit. The buttons, words, numbers on the screen just… look like… hieroglyphics, I guess. They’re all mushed up and it’s giving me a headache just looking at them. 

The apps all still had their images though. I clicked on Reddit. I was able to dictate this post, but I don’t know what the fuck to do now. Fuck.
