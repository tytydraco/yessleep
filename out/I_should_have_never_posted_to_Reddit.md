I recently made a post on Reddit, just a story I wrote and I wanted feedback on it. I wrote it months ago and it was my first time really sitting down and working up a complete fiction. I'm a very amateur writer and I thought this would be a good platform to really see if I have what it takes to be a writer. I was hesitant at first because I figured the story wouldn't get any feedback or any reads, but I figured what the hell, I don't know until I try, so I uploaded it. Within the first hour it got a few upvotes, which is honestly more than I expected, but no comments, so no feedback yet. I was constantly refreshing the page, trying to see if a comment would pop up or if it was getting more upvotes. 

Unfortunately I could not sit there all day and refresh the website due to me being at work, and I didn't want to get in trouble. So I let it go for a few hours until I got home. When I looked back at my phone there was nothing, no new upvotes, no comments at all. I checked my notifications and saw that my story was removed from the subreddit I posted it to, the only one I posted on. I was a bit taken back, I read the reasoning and it was due to the nature of my story, the contents of it didn't fit the guidelines. I reached out to the moderators for more clarification.

I only received an automated message that said "Thank you for your patience, it may take a few days before our team reaches out to you." So, I guess I had to wait. It kept racing in my head though, my story had nothing racy in it, nothing vulgar in it, it was a story about loss and acceptance, a thriller mystery. How could it have broken the guidelines? How many stories are taken down due to strict guidelines? I started thinking more maliciously, thinking about all of the writers like me who are constricted by these guidelines and a constriction on their creativity. I couldn't wait a few days for a response, this was tearing me up inside. I reached back out hoping it would expedite the process, seeing as I am desperately trying to make a career here.

Within minutes I get a response from the moderator team. "DO NOT MESSAGE US AGAIN!" Okay, now I'm pissed. So I'm at the mercy of them and their schedule, that's not how this is gonna go. Before I continue on, II would like to note, I'm a bit impatient.

"Please, I would just like to know what I can do to post my story on this subreddit."

"STOP MESSAGING US WE WILL RESPOND WHEN WE ARE READY"

"But you had to already read my story if you already took down my post, so one of you should be able to give me feedback, or did none of you read it?"

No response. They never messaged me after that, and I figured I'm not gonna get any feedback on my story either, so I kinda blew it. I just put down my phone and decided to forget it, maybe I'll write something new, within the guidelines. Then it dawned on me, I'll write a horror story about a Reddit community. It's a genius idea, a horror parody about someone trying to post to Reddit, but what would be the horror? There really anything scary about rejection, for most people at least. I sat around and thought about it for a bit until I got a notification on my phone, it was a message on Reddit.

"DONT DO IT"

It was from the Reddit moderator, I was chilled at first, for a second I thought he knew what I was about to write down, but maybe it was just them reiterating their last message. I tried not to think about it and I just started writing. I wrote about how I wrote a story, but I changed it up a little from my original post, I didn't mention anything about the plot or actual themes of the story, which I have to say are very intricate. I was a whole paragraph in when I got another notification from Reddit.

"JOSH DONT"

"What the fuck, that's my name. How the fuck do you know my name? Are you looking me up somewhere?"

"WE KNOW YOU"

"I'm reporting this, this has to be an invasion of privacy"

I went to report the moderator messaging me but I couldn't, I was clicking the button but it just wasn't doing anything. I thought maybe my phone isn't working so I hopped on my computer and logged into Reddit, but as soon as I went to messages, they were gone. All of the messages from that chat were gone, as if it never happened. I checked my phone again, still logged in, and they were gone there too. How the fuck did my messages disappear? I was freaked out, I instantly logged out from everything, I shut my computer and phone off. They know who I am and they are trying to hide it. I started pacing my room, trying to think of a way to make this right, but I don't want to message them anymore. Maybe I just wait, they might actually respond to my original message about my story and give me decent feedback or a way to rewrite it. I'd be okay with that at this point, but it was getting late so I decided to try and sleep it off.

I had trouble falling asleep, I kept thinking someone was gonna come to my house in the middle of the night and creep into my room. I tossed and turned for hours, all I could think was "It was suppose to be funny" "I figured they would just remove my new story anyway", but they took it too far. Maybe that's what I deserve for not listening, maybe that was their idea of a joke. As I was half asleep looking up at the ceiling, I noticed my computer was turned back on. It sat in the corner of my bedroom, the color shining at full brightness was not the same color as my background wallpaper, it was a bright orange. I slowly picked my head up to look at my computer screen to see it filled with the bright orange glow and nothing else.

It was more of a glow than the LED's in the monitor, as if the color was resonating out of the screen and into the room. I thought I was going crazy, but this was definitely NOT my mental health, it was something I could not explain. I quickly straightened up and started to get out of bed when suddenly a loud hum started pulsating in my ears. I had to cover my ears from the pain, it felt like my ear drums were going to explode, I fell to the floor next to my bed. I forcefully lifted myself up using my bed as support and starred at the monitor, the color was shifting, as if waves flowing through the air. I was mesmerized by the flowing colors surrounding my dark bedroom until the humming intensified and shot needles of pain through my sinuses. I screamed in agony and begged for mercy. 

"YOU HAVE BROKEN THE GUIDELINES. YOUR POST AND ANY FUTURE POST WILL BE REMOVED." The computer boomed these words in a synthetic voice. It was as if my computer was alive and speaking to me, no programs or hacking, the actual computer was doing this.

"Please, I'm sorry. I-I'll stop. Just please don't." And with that, the humming silenced, as if it was dialed down from a 10 to a 1, and the color from the screen dimmed but didn't go all the way out. It's presence was still there, as if it was listening to me. Hesitantly I spoke again.

"I-I just wanted feedback on my story."

"WHAT DID YOU WANT TO KNOW?" The computer said in a less authoritarian voice.

"Um... why was it taken down?"

"IT DID NOT FIT WITHIN OUR GUIDELINES"

"Yea I know that, but I can't make it fit without rewriting the whole story."

"THEN YOU WILL HAVE TO POST IT ELSEWHERE"

"Well... that sucks. Sorry for bothering you, I guess I'll find another subreddit to post to then."

"DO NOT MESSAGE US AGAIN" The computer went black after that, the humming stopped entirely leaving my bedroom dark and quiet.

I felt kinda at fault for what happened, also after that night I didn't touch Reddit for a few years and continued writing short stories and keeping them to myself. I'm only writing this to inform or warn others who may not know what kind of power some platforms possess. This isn't a promotion or slander of any kind, I just enjoy writing and I don't want something like that to happen to me ever again because I know I got no sleep that night.
