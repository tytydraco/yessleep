I never expected a routine hike to turn into the most terrifying experience of my life. My friend Jesse and I are avid urban explorers. We like to push boundaries—abandoned buildings, underground tunnels, and sometimes, forgotten hiking trails that wind through the dry, rolling hills of Los Angeles. It started with a rumor about an old New Age commune that supposedly vanished in the 80s. No one really talked about why, just that they had been there, and then they weren’t.

We found an old map online, marked with a single, strange word: “Elaria.” No record of it anywhere else. Google didn’t turn up a single result. So, of course, we had to check it out.

The trailhead was overgrown, nearly impossible to find without GPS. As we walked, the feeling set in—something wasn’t right. The deeper we went, the quieter it got. No birds, no wind, just the crunch of our boots on dry leaves. About three miles in, we found the first sign that Elaria had been real: A massive, circular stone arch covered in cryptic symbols—some resembling astrological signs, others looking eerily like inverted crosses.

Jesse was the first to step through. The second he did, he went pale. “Do you hear that?” he asked. I listened. And then I heard it too—a faint, rhythmic humming, coming from deeper in the hills.

We followed the sound.

What we found was worse than any horror movie.

At first, it just looked like an old hippie compound—abandoned shacks, tattered banners with faded sun and moon motifs. But then we saw the altar. A massive stone slab in the center of a clearing, surrounded by dozens of wooden effigies—some shaped like people, others like twisted creatures. The symbols we saw on the archway were everywhere, but now they were mixed with grotesque depictions of horned figures, their eyes gouged out.

And the humming? It wasn’t coming from speakers or wind passing through the trees. It was coming from the ground.

Jesse grabbed my arm. “We need to go.”

But before we could turn back, we heard footsteps. Slow, deliberate, coming from behind one of the shacks. We ducked behind a crumbling wall, barely breathing. A man in tattered, sun-bleached robes stepped into view. His face was gaunt, eyes sunken but wild, like he hadn’t slept in years. He stopped at the altar and knelt, pressing his forehead to the stone. Then, whispering something we couldn’t understand, he raised his hands—and we saw the knife.

It was long and jagged, blackened like it had been pulled from a fire. He drew the blade across his own palm, letting blood drip onto the stone. The humming grew louder.

And then, the ground moved.

Not like an earthquake—more like something beneath the surface was stirring.

We ran. We didn’t stop, didn’t look back. Whatever Elaria had been, it wasn’t just a hippie commune. It was something older. Something hungry.

When we finally reached my car, Jesse swore he heard the humming still. I laughed it off, told him it was just our nerves. But when I got home, I found something that made my stomach drop.

A smear of fresh blood on my boot.

I washed it off, but last night, I woke up to a sound outside my window.

Humming.

And when I checked my phone this morning, I had a new notification.

A calendar reminder I never set.

Tomorrow. Midnight.

Elaria calls.
