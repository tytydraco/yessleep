I don’t have any pictures or videos but this happened to me two nights ago in Wenham, MA and is 100% true. I’m not sure where to post this but please feel free to comment or ask any questions.

I was coming back from a long walk, for background I like long walks and was just walking on the street/sidewalks. I had been walking for roughly 8 miles and still had another 4 ( 1hr and 30 mins ) to go and had my gps giving my directions back to my college campus. The sun was set but just enough to still see I’d say around 30-50 feet in front of me and there was the occasional street light. So anyways there was heavy woods on both sides of me when I noticed far off to the right alongside a tall hill/mountain side a white figure, it stood out against the dark and I couldn’t tell if it was moving but I didn’t care or think too much of it. I continued walking down the road when out of the corner of my eye ( I didn’t hear it at first as I had earbuds in ) I saw this white, pale, skinny figure walking and seemed to be looking in my direction.

For a split second I thought it was a person and started to approach it but quickly realized it wasn’t a person. I took out my earbud immediately and froze, starring at this thing about 15 feet from me. It raised both of its “arms” at me and made some crazy distorted nose and looked like it was about to charge and I stepped back into the middle of the road and said outloud to myself “that is not a fucking person!” and sprinted down the road. It stayed in the woodsy area, matching my pace and I saw two cars coming down the road in the distance and I almost flagged then down cause I was so scared and new I needed to find shelter or a place to hide right away.

I didn’t though for some reason and kept running all the way to 3 way intersection where there was a house on the corner and street light. My heart was pounding and I was struck with pure fear. As soon as I saw whatever it was my heart just sank and my fight or flight instinct kicked in. I kept looking behind me and down the road to make sure whatever was there wasn’t chasing after me still. I didn’t see anything but I didn’t care and started jogging down a different road/ the road my gps told me to keep going. Thats when I thought I saw it again. I still had my music playing and turned it down when I heard a clicking noise, I thought it was the wind knocking something into a metal can or something. To hear it better I paused my music and thats when I saw another white creature crouching in the grass, starring at me. I sprinted to the street light freaking out again, I was tempted to go bang on the door of the house right there but I just didn’t. I didn’t even no if anyone was home. I stayed where I was in the light and called an uber. I was never more scared in my entire life. I had nothing to protect me ( I had a walking stick but chucked it when I took off running the first time ). There was an occasional car or two coming down the road but I just stood by the driveway of the house waiting my uber 4 mins away. Eventually my uber came and practically threw myself in and went back to my campus.

Can someone tell me what the hell I encountered?? I’m tempted to go back to where I saw it (during the day-time) and just replay what happened. It clearly wasn’t human and wasn’t any animal I could think of. Was it a skinwalker or some other paranormal creature?? If anyone has encountered something similar lmk. It was near Ryder Creek, Wenham MA.
