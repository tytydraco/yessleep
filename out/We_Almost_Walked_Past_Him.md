When I first moved out on my own, I started taking late-night walks.

Not for exercise. Not because I had to. Just because I could.

Because nobody could tell me not to.

I’ve always loved to go on walks. To me, they’ve always represented freedom. Being able to just go out into nature, to move as I pleased with no commitments to anybody. Now I was in my own place, I didn’t have to tell anyone where I was going, ask whether it was too late, or if I could go on this route or that route.

I loved the feeling of it, pulling on my coat whenever I wanted, slipping out into the quiet whenever the walls started to feel too close. I’d walk with my headphones in, hands buried in my pockets, letting my thoughts wander as far as my feet carried me.
There was one route I loved more than any other. It took me past a college campus, along a long, straight main road, then toward an industrial estate of darkened science buildings and empty office blocks. Beyond that, the sidewalks thinned, warehouse walls pressing in on one side, open farmland stretching endlessly on the other before dissolving into a thin line of trees.

By the time I looped back home, I always felt lighter. Calmer. Like I’d shaken something loose inside my chest.

I usually went between ten and midnight. Late enough to feel private. Early enough to still feel safe. There were always a few cars. The odd worker heading home after a late shift, or students wandering back after studying late in one of the offices. Always, someone passing through. Enough movement to remind me I wasn’t truly alone, but not so much I couldn’t relax and enjoy my peace.

My boyfriend at the time, now my husband, was over at my place. I’ll call him Chris for the sake of my privacy. We’d stayed up talking until nearly one in the morning, stuck in that hazy middle space where it’s too late to do anything but you’re enjoying yourselves too much to sleep.
I suggested my walk.

Chris hesitated. Said it was too late. That the road would probably be empty.

I shrugged it off. I’d walked it dozens of times without incident. “Empty” felt like part of the appeal.

Eventually, he gave in and grabbed his coat.

It was autumn. The air had that sharp, electric cold that makes every breath feel thin and clean. A light frost glittered across the pavement under the orange streetlights. The kind of night that makes being outside feel peaceful and being inside later feel warmer. That point in the year where you can feel the holidays slowly creeping up on you and the chill in air just makes your coat feel cosier and your bed even more snug.

The road was quieter than usual. One car passed us near the start.

Then nothing.

We walked and talked softly. About nothing important. About everything. The kind of conversation you make when you’re falling for each other and you have the night to yourselves.

Halfway down the road, a bird let out a sudden shrill cry from the direction we had just walk. It sounded like a scream. We both jumped, then laughed at how easily it scared us, neither of us wanting to admit the late hour and lonely road was getting to us.

“It’s an omen,” I joked. “It’s telling us not to turn back.”

I was wrong.

Far ahead of us, under the streetlights, I noticed a figure in the road.

At first, it barely registered. Just a silhouette drifting in and out of the orange glow. Hoodie. Tracksuit bottoms. A man.
He was walking in the same direction as us, away, so my first reaction wasn’t fear.

Then I noticed how he moved.

He wandered from one side of the road to the other, like he couldn’t hold a straight line, occasionally stumbling. Every few steps, his head tilted awkwardly up to one side.

I assumed he was drunk.

That actually made me feel calmer. Drunks are predictable. Unsteady, loud, usually more danger to themselves than anyone else.

Then I noticed something else.

He wasn’t swaying because he was unstable.

He was drifting because he kept twisting his head to look back at us.

Not casually.

Not briefly.

Deliberately.

Each time his body wandered, his face angled just enough to make sure we were still there.

The chill hit instantly. The kind that doesn’t start on your skin, it starts by creeping down the back of your neck, making every hair stand on edge. My chest tightened for no clear reason, like my body had registered the danger before my mind would allow it.

Without a word, Chris and I both slowed.

Ahead of us was the turn-off I usually took. The wide, well-lit road that led properly into the industrial estate and stayed open all hours.
But before that, along the sidewalk, was a much smaller side path. It slipped off behind a tall roadside sign and vanished into thick bushes, leading to a back gate at the rear of one of the buildings. It was used during the day and usually closed at night.

The sign blocking it was about five and a half feet tall, short for a road sign. In the summer, the low height stopped it from blocking the bushes and flowers in bloom along the sidewalk.

If someone stepped behind it and continued down the path, you wouldn’t see them again at all.

The man crossed the road.

Then he moved behind the sign.

Chris whispered, “Did he just go into the bushes?”

I leaned slightly, hoping, stupidly, that I wouldn’t see him. Because not seeing him would mean he’d gone down the path. That he was no longer on the sidewalk with us.

That he was no longer our problem.

For one brief second, I didn’t see him.

Relief fluttered weakly in my chest.

Then my eyes dropped.

At first, my brain refused to name what it was looking at.

There was a darker shape pressed into the shadow at the base of the sign. Something too solid to be just darkness, but not enough to grasp what I was seeing.

My thoughts stumbled uselessly over the image.

I didn’t want to understand it.

“Chris,” I whispered.

Headlights appeared at the far end of the road.

As the car approached, the light slid slowly across the pavement… climbed the metal face of the sign… and spilled underneath it.

Legs.

Bent at the knees.

Pulled tight to a crouched body.

Hiding.

Waiting.

The sensation in my body was immediate and violent. Like my stomach dropped straight through the ground. Like all the air in my chest had been sucked by some invisible force. My hands shook so badly I had to curl them into my sleeves.

If we hadn’t hesitated to check…

If we’d just kept walking…

We would have passed him without ever knowing he was there.

We turned around immediately.

We didn’t run.

I was afraid that if we did, it would trigger something in him. That sudden movement would flip a switch from patience to pursuit. He was bigger than both of us. I didn’t like the odds of outrunning him, and I was terrified of what would happen if I stumbled, if Chris slowed down for me, if he got hurt.

So we walked.

Fast. Rigid. Every nerve screaming between my shoulder blades and an icy cold running down my back.

I looked back.

He was in the road now.

Crossing over to our side.

Following us.

Not stumbling.

Not rushing.

Just keeping pace. Close enough to make sure we were in sight, not enough to make us run.

Chris booked an Uber as we walked. The pick-up point was still several minutes away. We wouldn’t have to stop, or call the police right in front of him, but we knew rescue was coming.

Every footstep sounded too loud.

I glanced behind again. The man had drifted closer to the bushes along the sidewalk, staying where the streetlight thinned into shadow. He never spoke. Never called out. Never hurried.

The only sound he made was the occasional soft, steady tap of his shoes. No breathing. No rustling. Just the sound that meant he was still there.

We continued on, fighting the urge to run, praying our rescue would be quick.

I looked back again.

He was gone.

That terrified me more than seeing him.

When the Uber’s headlights finally appeared around the bend, relief hit so hard my knees nearly buckled.

The second we saw the car, we ran.

And the second we ran, I heard footsteps again.

Faster.

He was running from the shadows across the road.

We reached the car first. The driver had already slowed, mid-turn. The doors unlocked as we grabbed the handles and threw ourselves inside.
I slid in on the far side, staring blindly out the opposite window. Chris was on the side closest to the man.
For a few unbearable seconds, there was nothing but glass and a few foot between them.

Between safety and whatever he intended to do.

The doors locked. The car surged forward.

As it completed the turn and we were facing back down the road, I saw him clearly for the last time, standing in the middle of the street, leaning forward slightly, staring straight at us.

Then he jogged back into the bushes and vanished.

The driver muttered, “Wow,” under his breath, shook his head, and accelerated.

When we got home, we called campus security for the nearby college, terrified some student would have the same stupid idea as us. Then the police. All we could give was a vague description. A man just under six feet. Grey tracksuit bottoms. Hoodie. No clear face. No age. Nothing that actually mattered. The operator sounded irritated. Unconvinced. Like we’d called about something trivial. He said they would send someone to check the area.

No one ever followed up.

The days after hit Chris harder than they hit me.

He couldn’t stop thinking about who it could have been. What if we saw them again? Maybe in town, or walking the same path in the day… we wouldn’t know who he even was. Would he recognise us?

“He wasn’t trying to scare us,” he said once. “He was trying not to be seen.”

That’s when the rest of it settled into place.

That road was too isolated. If he wanted an easy target to rob, the town center was twenty minutes away and full of drunk, distracted people.
Instead, he chose a place where no one would hear anything.
A place where he would have to be patient, somewhere he would have to hope anybody at all walked down.

I started keeping the lights on at home. Checking behind doors. Inside the wardrobe. Under the bed. Every shadow felt temporary, like it might shift if I looked away too long.

I kept wondering if he’d seen me walk that road before. Did we know him? What was he waiting there to do?

And sometimes, late in the dark, I still think about how easily the timing could have changed. If we hadn’t hesitated for a second. If I hadn’t glanced down…

No passing car.
No headlights.
No hesitation.
Just us… walking past a sign…
Never knowing what chose to wait on the other side.
