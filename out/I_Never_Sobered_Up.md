Drugs don’t agree with me. I haven’t ventured far into the world of substances, but weed is routinely ready and available in most settings. I’ve never liked weed; I’ve pretended to like it, occasionally bought my own supply to build up a tolerance, but I never grew into it. I’m anxious by nature, and my body reacts badly to most strains, given that I can’t stand losing control of my brain or consciousness. I know this about myself. I’m smart enough for that. 

Sitting around in a circle on the floor of the cabin, my friends passed around a new weed pen. It was a small device, something I’d never seen before, manufactured colorfully, almost as if marketed to young audiences. I hadn’t smoked in a while, and Carter was kind enough to provide for us, so I felt obliged to try it. Each friend exhaled a few coughs as they went. “Weak lungs,” I said, and they rolled their eyes. I felt the urge to prove some sort of superiority. In a bout of immaturity, I grabbed it and inhaled as deeply as I could, gripping the pen like it had value. Upon exhaling, I erupted into a fit of coughs, and admitted my defeat as the group laughed. I chuckled along with them between heaving breaths and passed the pen to my left. 

I sat still for a moment, listening to the conversation around me, and watching the pen pass from hand to mouth to hand. Carter, above anyone else, was used to his own substances, and fought down numerous hits before pocketing his little device and ending the circle. I stared at him as he patted his shorts… and then I realized I was staring. The realization. It was hitting me. 

The ringing in my ears came first. Then the rapid heartbeat, like a wild hare being chased by a coyote. The room around me blurred, my breathing became labored, and I cursed myself for my irresponsibility.

I looked up at Jamie, who was conversing with someone else in the circle (I didn’t care to analyze too thoroughly), and said, 
“Fuck. I’m high.” How astute of me. 

Jamie laughed. “I’m not,” she said. “I don’t feel anything.” 

I looked through her, focusing too hard — and not at all — on her eyes. “No, I’m really high.”

She laughed again. Then came the lapse in time. My next moment of consciousness came far later, I’m sure, because I found myself lying in Jamie’s arms. She was stroking my shoulder, and my head was heavy against the carpet in the corner of the room. I opened my eyes, scanning the walls, and everything shifted in and out of focus. “You’re okay, sweetie,” she said, feeling me move under her hand. I nodded into her lap and asked for water. I felt each sip slide down over the rapid beats of my heart, and instant raging nausea. I wanted to puke, to throw up every ounce of weed in my body, but I knew it wouldn’t work. 

Then I was face down on the floor, and Jamie was nowhere to be found. I refused to open my eyes or speak for fear that I would scare myself. My heartbeat reverberated off the wooden floor and the feeling only brewed more anxiety. The more anxious I became, the faster my heart was. Could I die from this? No, no one dies from bad highs, and we’ve all been in this situation. But if I did die, I wouldn’t even know. 

Even trying to think was too difficult. My thoughts folded over one another in a strange inner dialogue. I was arguing with myself. Using one finger, I tried to spell each letter of the alphabet on the floor, but couldn’t manage to focus hard enough to get past “e”. I tried over and over, anything to calm my mind. I sang a song in my head, tripping over the lyrics, laughing at myself for each mistake, then starting again. The voices of my friends around me seeped through my ears and circled in my skull. I didn’t understand what they were saying. Their laughter made me twitch. 

I must have fallen asleep, because when I opened my eyes again, the world was bright. The darkness from the night before was gone, and my ears weren’t ringing. My heart felt normal. My friends were curled up in their beds, barely stirring, breathing slowly. I savored the calm of a sleepy morning. 

“You almost killed me,” I said, watching Carter rise from his nest of blankets. “That was terrifying.”

“You were insane last night,” he said, laughing at the memory. “You stood outside for, like, 45 minutes. You didn’t move.”

I didn’t remember that. “No way,” I said, gesturing to a wall. “I was over there somewhere.”

“I mean, yeah, you were there for two hours, I think. Then you went outside. Thought I lost you.” He spoke so calmly, but something about my lack of memory made my heart speed up. It was so eerie to have been so far from my mind. 

Suddenly, I was at the kitchen table with a bowl of half-eaten cereal in front of me. My friends were scattered around the cabin, coffee mugs in their hands and breakfast in their mouths. I don’t like cereal, and I don’t remember pouring it. There were mounds of mush in my mouth. My tongue was dry. I couldn’t swallow. The pen sat next to my bowl where a spoon should have been, and there was milk dripping from my palm. I reached into the bowl to shovel another load of cereal, not registering quickly enough what I was doing. Cereal with my hands. That’s funny. Where did I get cereal? Who gave me cereal? I didn’t know we had cereal. 

I picked up my phone with my dry hand and clicked the camera. Looking at myself, my eyes were comically red. I laughed at myself. I looked high. I wasn’t high. My eyes were red. But highs don’t last that long. Three hours, usually. I put my phone down and laughed into the cereal. Forgetting my spoon-hand altogether, I dropped my face into the bowl. 

Then there were trees all around me and the sun was setting. My friends lay around a camp fire, speaking too quietly for me to hear. No, not quietly, just too quietly for my ringing ears to capture. I looked down at my hands. Little stars fogged my vision and my skin was deathly pale, even in my palms. I could see each wrinkle and crevice. I moved every finger. One at a time. 
“Guys,” I said, searching for words in my swirling head. My mouth begged for water. “I’m still high. Something’s wrong.”

Carter looked up. “Stop hitting the pen if you’re so worried about it, then. More for us.”

I shook my head. “Haven’t hit it since last night.” I trained each word to lie flat in my voice as I spoke. I could be calm if I decided to be. I hadn’t hit it. Hit it. I hadn’t. The pen. Carter brought the pen. Remember the pen. Don’t touch the pen. 

My friends stared at me. Carter frowned. “Yeah, we need to cut you off. You’re cooked.” 

Then I was back in bed. I hadn’t so much as blinked, and suddenly my face was deep in the pillow. The covers were so hot on my body that I thought I could roast, but I was shivering from head to toe. Why couldn’t I feel my toes? Were my toes losing oxygen? Can you lose oxygen? Where does your body get oxygen? Shivers. Waves of spasms kept me from falling asleep, but I didn’t know how long I’d been awake, either. The pen was gripped tightly in my hand. The pen. Put down the pen. I needed to put down the pen. 

Carter was standing over me. “How the fuck did you get that?” He asked, pulling the blankets off of me. “Stop using it.”

I tried to respond, to tell him that I didn’t know how I’d gotten it or how long I’d had it, but I couldn’t. My mouth felt like a desert and my spongy tongue flicked against my teeth. The ringing was coming in waves, like electric currents through my ears. My heart shook in my chest. 

“Jamie,” I whispered. “Get Jamie.”

Carter pried the pen from my grasp and then turned. I could hear his voice faintly through my daze. Get water. Get up and get water. I needed to get water. My mouth hurt. My throat was burning. Where did Carter go? He was just here. Carter. My friend Carter. Is he my friend? 

Jamie was stroking my head. She was whispering to me. It was early in the morning. Or was it night? The sun was out but it was cold. Night or day? My heart rang even faster than before. Slow down. Slow down. Breathe. In. Out. In out in out in out. 

“Give me the pen, honey,” Jamie said, combing through my hair. “Just give it to me, please.”

I couldn’t bring the words out of my head because my brain was too loud. I couldn’t hear her. Speak up, Jamie. The pen. She wanted the pen. What pen? Jamie was stroking my hair. It felt nice and it slowed my heart. No, my heart sped up again. What did she want?

She reached over me and plucked the pen out from under my head. I’d slept on it but it was warm. It smelled strongly and when her hand brushed my lips they were dry, not her hand but my lips and where did the pen go, did she take it from me or did my heart just slow down again or was it faster and how am I supposed to tell when I can’t hear and time is moving so quickly and where is Jamie?

She was gone. I was sitting in a pile of leaves. The sky was dark again and the stars were dancing. I heaved labored breaths. I couldn’t stop breathing or I’d forget to. I heard my friends calling my name from the distance. I couldn’t respond or I’d forget to breathe. They were far away and my heart was too loud in my ears. I held the pen to my cracked lips and yanked the vapor into my splintering mouth. The leaves were soggy under my head and I wanted to suck the dew from them to hydrate my drying tongue. I was thinking too hard and I wasn’t listening to my friends as they called for me and I’d forgotten to breathe for too long but I’d also suddenly forgotten how to breathe because my ears were too loud and the leaves were too wet and I dropped the pen onto the ground and the buzzing cloaked my ears and my eyes and my mouth and my body settled. 

In the blackness, my hand shot out to find the pen in the mess of leaves. And then, I didn’t know where I was. Where I was the pen I needed the pen the pen so high stop thinking breathe the pen where is Carter the pen need water pen the pen remember the pen to breathe the pen. The pen.
