I never believed in the supernatural. My great-aunt’s mirror, a grand, ornate piece with intricate gold framing, seemed like a curious antique more than a harbinger of horror. She left it to me in her will, and though it didn’t fit with my modern décor, I hung it in the hallway, thinking it might add a touch of vintage elegance.

At first, everything seemed normal. I’d catch glimpses of myself in the mirror as I passed by, occasionally noticing how the reflection seemed unusually vivid. But then, the disturbances started.

A few weeks ago, I was woken by an unsettling scratching noise coming from the hallway. It was faint at first, almost like the sound of something small moving against the wall. I ignored it, thinking it might be a mouse. But the noise grew louder each night, accompanied by whispers that I couldn’t quite make out.

One night, I couldn’t sleep. I got up to investigate and noticed something alarming: faint smudges and handprints on the surface of the mirror, as if someone had been pressing against it from the other side. I tried to clean them, but they wouldn’t budge. It was as if the marks were etched into the glass.

That’s when things took a horrifying turn. The mirror, which had previously reflected the hallway, now displayed a dark, foreboding corridor that didn’t exist in my apartment. The walls were draped in shadows, and a door at the end of the corridor was slightly ajar, with a dim, flickering light coming from beyond it.

I blinked and rubbed my eyes, trying to convince myself it was a trick of the light. But every time I looked back, the corridor remained, and the door creaked open wider, revealing glimpses of a dark, shifting shape. It was as if something was moving just beyond the threshold, watching me.

My heart raced, and I reached out to touch the mirror. As soon as my fingers made contact, the air grew frigid. A cold, clammy sensation enveloped my hand, and I felt a powerful force pulling at me from the other side. It was like icy fingers wrapping around my wrist, trying to drag me through the glass.

I yanked my hand away and stumbled back, but the sensation didn’t fade. Shadows in the mirror twisted and writhed, and the whispers grew louder, now distinctly angry, as if they were screaming for release. I saw fleeting images of distorted faces and grasping hands pressing against the mirror, desperately trying to break free.

Since that night, the mirror has become a source of constant dread. I’ve noticed other oddities—things being out of place, inexplicable cold spots in my apartment, and objects moving on their own. The whispers and scratching sounds are now a nightly occurrence, and sometimes, when I glance at the mirror, I see shadowy figures watching me from the other side.

I tried covering the mirror with a cloth, but it didn’t help. The whispers grew louder, and the shadows seemed to seep through the fabric. I even tried to move it, but it felt unnaturally heavy and resisted every attempt.

Now, I’m too afraid to approach it. I’ve considered destroying it, but something in me fears what might happen if I do. Whatever is trapped in that mirror feels malevolent and hungry. It’s as if the mirror has become a gateway, and I’m terrified of what might come through if I provoke it.

I’m left with a constant sense of dread, knowing that whatever is behind that glass is not just watching me—it’s waiting for a chance to get out.
