I knew what was happening—the inevitable turn. I reversed back to the fork, where there was more light. A part of me shouted for me to keep going—exit the air duct, hop into the car, forget about this place. But I told myself I must be close to the medicine cabinet. Get Roy his insulin, or he would die. Get me some food, or I would die. I also reasoned that the man was stuck. I could still take the other shaft at the fork and complete my goal.

In a split second, I stopped all backward momentum and crawled through the right shaft. My pace mirrored my quickening breathing. Any pain from my bad ankle was numbed by an eruption of adrenaline. My heart pounded so heavily that I thought it would slam me against the top of the shaft.

I kept my head low and crawled. I assumed I had pulled even with the man stuck in the parallel shaft when a loud crack halted me. I hadn’t a clue what it was. It was suppressed, so it was not in the same shaft as mine. But it was loud enough to be nearby. Then I heard it again. They were in quick succession like exploding firecrackers. Panic gripped my heart when I thought the air duct was separating from the store’s ceiling. I pictured every screw holding each segment of the air duct against the ceiling disengage. I locked my fingers behind my head and braced for impact with the ground. But despite the continuous cracking, I didn’t fall. The cracking then ceased and transitioned to a thunderous, repeating pounding. Something was striking furiously at the inside of the shaft. It felt so close to me that my teeth began to chatter. Then the pounding felt less close like it travelled away somewhere behind me. I turned my head back, following the movement of the source. Just as quickly as it went, it roared back louder than before. The pounding grew more intense with each strike, shaking the air duct and me within it. It was no longer muffled. The echoes hit me unobstructed. Eyes strained to see in the darkness, I squinted and held my breath. The din was building all around. Thin shafts of light shined at me. They danced behind a moving silhouette. Then—even in the dark—I could see the nightmare that was heading right for me.

A man—one of those things—was crawling towards me. He hammered a fist into the air duct and dragged himself along. And his crimson eyes glowed in the dark like they held all the fire of hell within them. He was horror incarnate.

My jaw dropped to release a scream, but it stalled in my throat. The only sounds in the shaft were incessant pounding of metal and demonic shrieks. My head snapped forward, and every limb worked double time to drive myself forward. Further into the darkness was my only escape. I pulled, pushed, and scratched as quickly as I could to get away. Pieces of my skin remained on the metal where my forearms and elbows had been. My knees slammed into the air duct walls with every crawl.

To my astonishment, the passageway before me began flooding with light. I could see the light streaming from below through the grille covers on the air duct floor. I looked down as I crawled over them. The medicine cabinet was positioned below, but I could not stop, or I was a dead man. My exposed flesh scraped against the covers, and more bits of me were left behind. When I passed through the flood of light, any residual hope I had was snuffed. Directly ahead of me was a grille hood. I was at the end of the air duct.

The entire shaft shook violently, and a deafening rumble filled the tight space. That thing shrieked again. It felt like my ears were bleeding. Lying flat, I rotated to my back and lifted my head to look down the air duct. That thing was here. I thought I would die of a heart attack if he didn’t kill me first. The noise surrounded me like I was strapped to a rocket. I closed my eyes, conceding to my impending doom.

Then—for a split second—I was entirely weightless. My stomach felt as if it suspended momentarily in the air before falling back into place with the rest of me. I smashed into the air duct floor before rebounding up into the ceiling. I came to rest against the air duct floor again but at a near-vertical angle. There was something beneath my feet. I was standing. Through the sparkling white stars swimming in my eyes, I looked up. The grille hood that was there seconds ago was gone. In its place was the white ceiling of the store’s interior. I reached up with both hands and gripped the edge of the shaft’s opening. It was another test of strength for my frail limbs, but I climbed out of my hell and into the light.

Some ceiling lights were still in working order. My time in the shaft made me shun the light bathing me. I shut my eyes and shielded them with my arm. When I adjusted to the brightness, I saw what had happened.

A large section of the air duct system had broken from the ceiling. The damage was likely due to the combined weight of that thing and me and its forceful hammering. My section landed on top of a metal desk, bending and propping it upright. The entire thing resembled an *L*—the long side rested on the floor. My section was the vertical short stem.

Before I could consider my good fortune, that thing slithered out from the other end of the air duct. His mouth twisted and agape, pointing at me. White foam oozed down his chin. Covering his pudgy frame was the same black dust that blanketed me. In areas where there was no dust, his skin glistened in the light, coated in some kind of oil. I realized he was wearing nothing but a pair of dark boxer briefs. He continued his crawl towards me with only his right arm. A strong fist slammed into the ground and towed his body along. The left arm was flaccid at his side, connected to a shoulder that had dropped to his chest. His hip was twisted—the right pelvic bone protruded from his back. The right leg was considerably shorter than the left. His feet slapped at the linoleum with each twitch of the knees. He was powerful and fast despite his handicaps.

It dawned on me that this thing was the man stuck in the air duct. The cracking I heard was that of his bones.

He stared at me like there was nothing and no one else in the universe. Though his eyes were bloodshot and housed an innate evil, I could not help but see the melancholy within. As he neared me, he reached out. His palm opened, and his fingers straightened as though hoping for someone to take it. At that moment, I felt a kinship with him. Then, his fingers curled around an invisible throat. He let out a shriek—a reminder that he was programmed to terminate me.

Before he got any closer, I hobbled around him. This forced him to slow and turn in a semi-circle. I busted through the waist-height swinging door of the mini pharmacy. A small shelf and medicine cabinet lined the back wall. Most of the medication had been ransacked. It was Roy’s lucky day that he was the town’s only diabetic. In the cabinet sat three vials of insulin, all labeled with his name.

I grabbed the insulin and turned to the sight of my crippled stalker crawling under the swinging door. I leaned onto the pharmacy counter and rolled onto the other side. He clawed at the counter and pulled himself up to follow me over. There was no time to grab any food, nor did I have any courage left to do so. With the pharmacy ransacked, it was likely the rest of the store had been also. A few more hobbled steps later, and I was at the back door. I unlocked it and rammed it twice with my shoulder. Without much flesh to cushion the blows, a sharp, tingling sensation shot down my arm. I heard the heavy dumpster roll from the other side of the door. A long squeak on the linoleum floor trailed behind me. I pushed the door open just enough for me to squeeze through. My pant leg jerked back, but I did not stop or turn to look. I jumped into the RAV4 and peeled out of there.

As I reached the next block, I brought the engine to a low hum again. I tried to convince myself I did well—that I stared death in the face again and survived. Roy now had his medicine. He would be fine for the next while. But what had the whole ordeal done for me? I would wake up the next day with more injuries and a stomach no less hungry. I couldn’t shake that reality, and the byproduct was a bitterness that grew stronger as I got closer to home.

That thought lingered in my mind when I saw it—the white grocery at the doorstep of the house I had seen earlier. Whoever was the intended recipient had yet to retrieve it. I imagined the bag filled with food. Without a second thought, I turned the wheel sharply, hopped the sidewalk, and stopped just inches by the doorstep. I opened the car door and snatched the bag. The car tore off the lawn and back onto the street.

In the rearview mirror, I saw the door open. Stumbling out with a cane gripped in a shaking hand was Mrs. Nakayama—the elderly mother of a prominent plant engineer. The cane lashed uncontrollably in the air as she cried out. It was a long, excruciating cry spilling with fear, anger, and despair. The kind of cry you wail when your world has been stolen. Each of her steps looked more precarious than the one before. It was telling she had not moved that fast in years. The frailty of her legs prevailed, and she fell forward. Her face smacked hard off the concrete walkway. From the mirror, I saw her wet eyes. Her bellowing cries chased me down the street. I watched as she got smaller and smaller.

“I don’t believe it,” Roy said. His drawl was slower than ever. “You done did it.”

I heard the vials clinking on his end. They were delivered to his front door in the same manner I had stolen from Mrs. Nakayama. Something so delicate and important was not going to be launched through the air. But there was no gratitude from Roy. He sounded like I had done him a disservice by extending his life. It was easily read by my ear now. And in the mood I was in, it pissed me off.

“Better get to it,” I said through gritted teeth.

“Say what?”

“The insulin. Don’t wait any longer, Roy. You don’t sound so good.”

“Uhh… yeah. Right.”

He had no intention of using the insulin. I couldn’t bite my tongue any further. “Something the matter, Roy? Did I get you the wrong meds? A little light on food, perhaps?” Mrs. Nakayama’s bag left much to be desired. That fueled my sour mood.

“I done told you not to go, son.” He must have sensed my displeasure. His tone was as thorny as mine.

“Stop calling me that. I’m not your damn son.”

In an instant, Roy changed. Raged tinged his voice. “What is your damn prob—” He stopped just as fast and subdued himself. His volume lowered. “I th… think you’re still jacked up. Do what you gotta do to… take the load off.”

Hearing him calm himself only emboldened me further. “I nearly died! Again! The things I’ve seen. The things I’ve done. I stole from an old lady. Nothing’s ever coming off, you understand?”

“The hell is wrong with you, boy?”

“Oh, what? The world’s gone to shit, and I still have to stick to my morals like ol’ righteous Roy?”

Shallow breathing came through the radio.

“I just crawled through hell to get you your medicine, old man. And you sound as thankful as someone who got his medicine taken away!” Roy tried to interject, but I kept talking. “The only reason I am still alive is pure dumb luck. No one helped me out there. *You* certainly didn’t help me!” I could hear the rush of my blood.

“I… I thought you would listen.”

“And I thought you were a fighter. With the insulin, I thought you would change your mind. But you used me, Roy. You were using me all this time. I was too dumb to catch on. You used me, and you lied to me.”

“Watch… your mouth,” he barely got that out.

“Telling me what to do again, huh? I thought we would help each other get out of this shithole. But you just wanted a buddy so you didn’t die alone. That’s why you wanted me to stay put. You reserved that lonely death for me after you kicked the bucket. You’re not a fighter. You’re a fraud.”

More shallow breathing.

I said, “You got a gun. Just pull the trigger and save yourself the anguish, coward.”

Roy took a long breath and cleared his throat. “My life been full of death… and violence. I ain’t got the strength to… fight no more. There ain’t nothing left to fight for. I just want to go peacefully, with dignity. My way. Ain’t no cowardice in the way I’m doing it. Poppin' myself would be the coward’s way out.” He let out a wheezing cough. “I done some real bad things in my day. Ain’t sure I’ll be seein’ my Estelle again. I want to die here… where she passed… so I can be as close to her as possible.” He spoke like those were the very last words he could muster.

Still, in a haze of anger, I said, “Good riddance, you old bastard.”

The immediate days that followed were tough on all fronts. Everything was running low—food, water, courage, hope. Each time I considered leaving my house to raid another, I heard one of those things scurrying in the distance. Whether I actually heard it, I could not be sure. Facing another one was a tall order I knew I could not surmount. My food supply, which began to dwindle before my blowout with Roy, was down to two cans. I had stretched what I had by eating every other day. Hunger had long ago stopped being a feeling I had to satisfy. It was a part of my being. A constant that led me towards death. My water supply was not faring much better. To preserve it, I reduced my daily intake to a quarter bottle. A low dose to wet the tongue a few times a day. I still could not bring myself to drink from the tap. My busted ankle had set and healed poorly. Its misalignment at the end of my bony leg resembled a double knot in a skinny garden hose. The radiating pain was so chronic it felt like an eternal fire was lit inside my ankle. Any remnants of muscle remaining on my body sat low to the bones. I found myself under a blanket on a nightly basis. Just shortly before, I had fantasized about a sweeping blizzard rescuing me from the stale, boiling heat.

My Battleship game board sat useless without the other half. A stark reminder that I was, yet again, all alone. A pall of silence and boredom once again draped over the house. The walls of my spacious house shrank with each passing day and formed a cell I was condemned to. The sound of my voice—something I became reacquainted with when Roy came along—was extinguished. There was no one to speak to, so there was no reason to speak. The boredom paled in comparison to the fear that returned to haunt me. The same fear that was held at bay by just knowing Roy was there. That he was going through the same ordeal as I meant I was not truly alone. Now, I was a ship sailing uncertain seas without a guiding light.

I cursed myself for succumbing to the demons of my isolation. For being so mentally weak. For always needing someone to be there. Feeling all this validated what Roy did for me. The human connection—as he put it—was the medicine for my mind and soul in this solitude. Without it, it felt like I was dying twice as fast. My anger towards him began to subside. The weight of it all lightened, only to be replaced by the heaviness of regret. I reflected on my outburst and his calm, poignant words. Regret was soon joined by shame. The fact that I survived as long as I had was due in large part to Roy. That did not change despite our different interpretations of what helping each other meant.

I pictured a weak and helpless Roy splayed out on his bed, waiting for death to close his eyes for the last time. The thought of calling him on the radio passed through my mind repeatedly. I thought of apologizing and confessing how much he meant to me. That I was out of line. But would he even have had the strength to answer? Was he even alive to answer? Did he even exist to answer? Each time I lifted the radio, the doubt of his existence forced it back down. I wondered if our last conversation was just my mind putting an end to him because it knew it was the end of me. Perhaps my subconsciousness had finally conceded to the inevitable. This was the end of the line for me. This was where my survival story ended.

On a rare night when sleep had found me, I was awakened by the jarring crackle of the radio. Still on my side, both eyes snapped open. I saw the radio on my coffee table lit by a sliver of moonlight that cut through the curtains. My gaze remained on the radio, willing it to tell me if I had really heard something. It crackled again. This time, there was an audible cry. It was quick. Like the transmission button was hit by accident, allowing a brief opening for sound to come through. It sounded like Roy, and it sounded like he was in distress. I pushed myself off the couch. Standing there in my living room, I was unsure of what to do. Then came the unmistakable shriek. It came from outside towards the back of my house. Yet, it commanded every hair on my arms and neck to stand on end.

I picked up my crutch and marched to the kitchen window beside my fortified door. Slowly parting the curtains, I looked beyond the alleyway to Roy’s house. The entire distance was largely cloaked in darkness. However, I was able to make out sections of the house in the pale moonlight. The window to the left of the barricaded entrance was now a gaping hole. I heard another chilling shriek, and my blood turned to ice. It was coming from within Roy’s house.

I was suddenly faced with a decision—should I stay or go over there to help Roy? I struggled to find my breath. My heart smashed against my rib cage. If I stayed, he was as good as dead. If I went, he had a fighting chance to stay alive. But there were two glaring caveats with the second option. My proximity to Roy would turn him. And my death was a real possibility. Dread washed over me as the decision teetered in my brain. Then the question that haunted me hit me for the final time—was Roy even real?

Another shriek rang out like a gunshot, hurrying me for a decision.

I had called Roy selfish, a liar, a user. I accused him of not being a true fighter. All those things could have easily been deflected back at me. That was how I lived my life and treated even those close to me. I was rarely there for them when they needed me. At that moment—more than any other time in my life—I felt compelled to change who I was. If Roy was not real, then I was destined to enter that house to slay the demon of my past self. If Roy was real, then there was only one option that guaranteed his death. A death in a manner he did not want.

I turned and pushed and pulled the refrigerator blocking my door. The mug perched atop fell and shattered. I slid into my runners sitting by the door. Forgoing my crutch, I grasped my flashlight in one hand and my metal pipe in the other. I opened the door and stepped away from safety. The cool night air hit my skin, chilling my blood further. I took quick strides across my yard and into the alleyway. My ankle pulsed with each step, but the adrenaline killed the pain. The darkness engulfed me and overpowered the moonlight. I refrained from using my flashlight to not attract any unwanted attention. Out in the open and without much sense of my surroundings, I was completely vulnerable. Death could reach out and touch me, and I would not know what killed me. I was a blindfolded man walking through a minefield.

The moonlight shimmering off Roy’s pool let me know I had reached his property. I stuck my pipe out in front of me and walked towards where I recalled the broken window to be. The pipe clinked against the window frame. I had arrived. Darkness was all I saw inside the house. Groping around the frame, I felt jagged shards of glass still on the edges. The glass was wet. Pipe firmly in hand, I ran it along the bottom edge to remove any glass. Due to the height of the window, it was not possible to enter feet first. I stuck my torso through with my belly resting on the bottom of the frame. My hands pulled against the wall on the inside, creating a momentum that took my legs through the window in a forward roll. My back landed with a dull thud, followed by my heels. I stayed down for a few seconds, listening intently for any movement I may have stirred. But there was nothing. The house was eerily quiet.

I stood up, clicked on my flashlight, and shined it on myself. Red spots formed against my white t-shirt at the belly. I moved the light to my legs and saw blood streaming from under the hem of my shorts. Strewn around me was shattered glass and the wood that once barricaded the window. I moved the light to the floor and saw a trail of blood leading out of the kitchen.

My soul nearly leapt from my body when footsteps rocked the ceiling overhead. They were fast and heavy, with no intent to be stealthy. I clicked off my flashlight and thought of where to run, but the footsteps stopped. In the pitch black, I placed a fist over my heart to calm it. All was quiet in the house again. Remembering where the blood trail led, I started walking. The glass crunched beneath my shoes. At the archway dividing the kitchen and the connecting hallway, I clicked the flashlight on and off. Just quick enough to see the trail of blood. It was no longer a smear but individual drops. I swallowed and entered the hallway. All houses had the same architecture, so I was not navigating blind. My back pressed up against one side of the wall as I walked. I felt the pricks of a thousand glass slivers against my back. The adrenaline was firing and made the pain tolerable. Faint shafts of moonlight landed at the end of the hallway. I could see the low steps at the bottom of the stairway. Another couple clicks of the flashlight confirmed the blood led upstairs.

As I ascended the stairs, my mind primed me for survival. All my instincts sharpened. Everything capable of triggering my senses magnified. The silence felt heavy and palpable like I could reach out and grab a handful of it. This only amplified the creaking under my feet as they pressed on wobbly steps. Crooked bones in my ankle jutted into ligaments, producing a click. The drumming of my heart bounced around my chest as if trying to break from the restraints of my rib cage. Beads of cold sweat tickled my skin as they tracked down my temples and along the back of my neck. The scent of oxidized blood travelled into my nostrils, depositing a metallic taste at the back of my throat. Pitch black faded to grey tones as my eyes acclimated to the darkness. I began to see the sharp lines of the bathroom door at the top. But at no point was I able to detect any noise not created by me. This unsettled me to the highest degree. And before I knew it, I was holding my breath the rest of the way.

At the top of the stairs, my foot kicked something. It was small but heavy and scraped against the wooden floor. My heart skipped a few beats. Placing the pipe under my arm, I bent down and felt around for the object. My fingers found the rubber grip of something. I picked it up. It was a revolver. It was the first time I had ever held a gun.

As I stood, I heard it all at once. The thunderous footsteps, the horrible scream, the force smashing into me. I felt the lashing of hair against my face, and then there was nothing under my feet. The wind filled my ears as if I had fallen a hundred feet. My back bounced hard off the unforgiving wooden steps before sliding down to the landing. The clang of my metal pipe filled the space as it ricocheted down the stairs. Somehow, I managed to hold onto the flashlight and gun. From my back, I clicked on the flashlight and aimed it at the top of the stairs. Staring down at me with those sinister red eyes was Ada.

I gasped. My eyes batted repeatedly, testing whether the image before me would disappear. Ada remained. Bright red smeared across her mouth. The blood was like a careless brush stroke across a blindingly white canvas. A mess of hair bunched on both sides of her head. Her negligee—white when I last saw her—was now a dark burgundy.

She screamed and leapt from her spot. It all happened in slow motion. I saw her floating towards me, hair flapping behind her, fingers curled like talons. Her mouth parted wide, giving a view of her crimson teeth. I raised the revolver and pulled the trigger. The shot was loud. My weak hand kicked back from the recoil. Before my arm could straighten, I pulled the trigger for the second time. The revolver nearly fell out of my hand.

For a few seconds, an unbearable ring battered my eardrums. Having overshot her leap, Ada’s torso hung off the railing beyond my head. Both of her feet rested on my chest. I pushed them off and scrambled frantically to my feet. The gun trained on her from my shaking hand. My body struggled to suck in the air. I coughed and expelled some blood that spattered into my mouth. Ada slid off the railing and fell onto the hallway floor with a heavy splat. She was motionless, but the gun remained on her. Blood pooled from under her and spread out in all directions.

Eyes still on Ada, I yelled. “Roy!”

A weak voice reduced to a near whisper answered. “In… he… here.” It came from above. The voice was shaking.

I climbed the stairs again. In front of me, the bathroom door was slightly ajar. I pushed it open with the barrel of the revolver and directed the flashlight inside. A set of bloody fingers curled around the edge of the bathtub. The back of a head raised from the bathtub, and the rest of the body followed. At a painfully slow pace, the figure turned and faced me. My eyes widened like I was looking at another person for the very first time. Standing before me was Roy. His face was sunken and tired. The bloody wife beater hung off his gaunt figure as if three sizes too large. He had one hand placed over the opposite forearm. Blood dripped from the spot and dotted the white porcelain. He was convulsing, fighting hard not to lose himself. We were out of time.

“Goo… good to see… you… son,” Roy said. He shot me a smile I had never seen before. His eyes flickered in the light. In that fleeting moment, I knew he felt for me what I wished I had told him. His shaking intensified. He turned his back towards me again and spread out his thin arms. “S… s… send meh ta… Es… telle.”

The bathroom flooded with light as I stepped in. I choked back a lump in my throat as a tear fell from my eye. The revolver raised in a tight grip in my hand. I said, “Goodbye, my friend.” Roy fell in a heap at the sound of the shot.

Cascading clouds dusted the morning sky in a dreamy haze. They rolled and parted for the blood-orange glow that rose over the horizon. My mind harkened back to my first sunrise with Julia. Just two young people in the wilderness. My arms wrapped around her, providing the warmth of her protector. Sitting now with my feet in my pool, I watched the calming rise of the sun signal the start of another day. Another day where I live as a failed protector. I had failed my wife, my son, Ada, Roy.

I watched traces of my blood unfurl like thread under water before fading into nothing. The nickel of the revolver caught a ray and glinted. I turned it and popped out the cylinder. In the chamber was one remaining bullet—one permanent release from the everlasting guilt of my failures. I pushed the cylinder back into place and looked out at the sky one more time. But it was something else that caught my eye. Bobbing in the water—partially obscured by a deflated swan pool float—was a blue ball in a Ziploc pouch. I picked up the skimmer net and hurried to the other side of the pool. The pool float drifted with a slight nudge, and the net dipped in the water for a scoop. I ripped apart the Ziploc seal and took out the note within. It read:

*Keep punching, son.*
