I thought it prudent to write this account, of the worst job I’ve held in my life thus far, and in hope that this acts as a precautionary tale for some of you.

At the time, I was closing out my doctorate (in humanities—much less exciting) at a university nestled deep in the state’s tablelands region, where hills undulated like waves for kilometres around, bundling into the occasional mountain wrapped in dry grass and eucalypts. And between these mountains you would have towns, an hour apart, of which my humble abode was the largest in the region owing to its steady stream of university students.

In the far reaches of the campus, wedged between grass fields and the foot of Mount Curtin, was Cotter Hall—a student residence housing just shy of a thousand in its mix of single and multi-share apartments, where I had the deep misfortune of being the after-hours Residential Assistant. Like many in my field, degree-related jobs were about as common as winning lotto tickets, so the vast majority of us got by on a rotating roster of customer service and hospitality gigs. A life of quiet, underappreciated duties.

Depending on who else was available, I’d score two to three on-call shifts a week, where I’d walk four rounds throughout the grounds between 7PM and 7AM, fix what small maintenance jobs I could, mop up rivers of wine-induced vomit, and respond to endless noise complaints with only the light prospect of a “residential citation” as my stick to wave around.

The first event in the chain that would lead to my resignation was the death of a student, after what the police concluded was a fall from the rooftop garden of the residence. 

Her name was Catriona, part of a multi-share clique nicknamed (self-named, so it was a little obnoxious/pretentious) the Fantastic Four. The remaining three flatmates in the clique, in addition to the dozen other students who were partying on the roof that evening, confirmed to the constables that she must’ve been jumping next to the railing, trying to get someone’s attention, before she tumbled.

I wasn’t on duty that evening, thankfully. Trevor had to deal with the mess. From what he told me, he heard the screams from his window, parting the Red Sea of Mount Curtin’s usual hum of cicadas and 4AM kookaburras. When he got to the rooftop, the party was whispering to each other, hands tugging at scalps, mouths agape. They were far across the roof, out of sight of the one security camera watching the terrace’s entrance. Apparently, he had to ask around once he got up there, to piece everything together, leading him to look over the railing where she fell.

Ricky, the self-proclaimed head of the Fantastic Four, and occupant of the flat’s largest bedroom, sat next to me at the memorial the following week. I hadn’t been called to any welfare checks on him or his flatmates since, but I knew he was having a tough time. Detective Haddad had swung by to his apartment every second day, pushing past processions of neighbours extending their condolences. Ricky himself was bloodshot, and the bags under his eyes looked like they were chiselled into his skull by centuries of dripping water.

The standard courtesies. Condolences. I offered, “If you ever need to talk, you know my room number. I’ve been around the traps a while; happy to sit through whatever you want me to, even if just as a sounding board.”

Ricky didn’t look at me. Not that he would normally, since he was the kind of guy to look past anyone who wasn’t a part of his circle, a LinkedIn opportunity, or a potential suitor. But he just sat there, trembling. His fists were clenched though, veins unearthed. Finally, he nodded.

When the remnants of the Fantastic Four were summoned onto stage—Ricky, plus Gabrielle and Nate, both classmates from Ricky’s law subjects—Ricky took the lead and spoke on behalf of the group. Gabrielle and Nate looked as shaken as their point-man, colourless gargoyles on the flanks. Catriona would be sadly missed. She did some quirky things that made us laugh. If we remember those things, she’ll live forever. Et-cetera.

It wasn’t my first time at one of these memorials, our generation being as it is.

What I want to get to though, is the fact that this level of authority I ostensibly had in the Hall, earned me a non-alcoholic invite to what was a highly-alcoholic student wake hosted in the Fantastic Four multi-share apartment. I was on duty that night, so I would be dropping by officially to tell them to keep the noise down, but Ricky mentioned in passing that he wouldn’t mind me mingling. 

So, at my 10PM round for that night, I tucked my lanyard and master key into my front pocket, set out from the main office, and crossed the paved quadrangle to the apartment blocks, taking a dip into the glow of the common lampposts. Music was blaring, and if there was fog in the air, you probably would have seen smoky ripples from the bass. 

Cheap Ikea lamps and standard-issue uni student fairy lights plunged the apartment into a warm, but dazzling ocean of amber. There was barely any room to move in the living room and kitchen, with attendees packed all the way down the metre-wide hall to the bedrooms. Ricky, Gabrielle, and Nate were heavy in the sauce, with Ricky already dancing on the benchtop. The other two were trying to hold steady by the kitchen sink, watching their roommate with blank stares.

In the corner of their living room though, in a makeshift mock altar of some-empty, some-full shot glasses, was what I thought was a wooden *totem*. Most peculiar thing I’ve seen so far in any of the room inspections I’ve taken part in, mostly because it looked so out of place. It had the rough, albeit featureless shape of a chunky man, perched on top of a conical mound. There were two holes shaped like half circles at the top of the figure, where the face was supposed to be.

Didn’t scare me then. At that point. But it did grab my attention, and Ricky must’ve noticed because he came stumbling off the counter once he noticed me there, unmoving in the crowd and entranced by this rocket-ship-looking trunk of wood.

“You like it? It was Catriona’s idea to feed it alcohol.” He was already slurring his words, arm draped around mine. Breath stank like sour cask wine.

“Where’d you get this?”

He double thumbs-upped and pointed at himself. “Found it when I was travelling. We were like, five hours out of Manila, I don’t know. The guy we were following needed to take a piss break and I haggled this off one of those random street-side stores…” 

Manila, huh. Probably some sort of indigenous effigy then, and saying that, the mound it was standing on looked like one of those big, conical volcanoes. 

Ricky started toppling. I held him up, and he came back around.

“Sorry. I’m fucked up, as you can tell.” He took another swig. “Catriona loved this thing! I reckon we’ll keep it, in her memory. She was always a cheeky one, so I reckon this is good for a bit of an… in-memoriam… laugh, every now and then. Won’t give it alcohol though, what a waste.”

“Maybe you should put her portrait up next to it instead.”

“What?” I think he said that because he was too far gone to hear me properly, and not because he was offended at my attempt at humour.

“Drink a bit more water, mate. You don’t want to be paying the steam cleaning charge for these floors.”

Ricky laughed, and started pulling away. “You’re Cotter’s best RA. Good one. Hey… when I’m sober we should have a chat more, eh?”

He didn’t wait for a response. Just slithered back through the crowd with his red cup raised above his head. I could see Gabrielle and Nate also off the table now, watching me from a distance. Blank faced, again. I’m not sure if it was because they were trying or use every ounce of concentration they had to stay with the world, or if they were legitimately concerned about something.

I pushed my way to them, checking the floor for broken glass, vomit, as I went. “You lot okay?”

They nodded, in unison. They were looking at each other, as though unsure if they were allowed to speak.

“As I’ve said to you guys a few times; happy to chat about anything if you need. I can see you’re quite on the grog at the moment, and that’s not always the best way to get over these things.”

Nate set his drink down, moved his lips silently at first, trying to speak, and then blurted, “Well what the fuck do you know about any of this? Do you know what it’s like losing a mate of two years?”

Gabrielle didn’t move. I noticed her stare was pinned on the totem in the corner of the room. “That thing is so bloody stupid. It’s not a pet. And now it’s like, Catriona forever.”

Well fuck me then. I wasn’t expecting these two to be a riot but a friendly, consoling chinwag would’ve been nice. On further reflection, it was probably my fault for being too assertive.

Nate chimed back in. “Look, it’s just… it’s so hard, especially when you start blaming yourselves…” He steadied himself on the counter. “We’d just had this massive, massive fight the night before.”

“Ah, I get that. Well, not personally. But as the RA, I’m always here.”

\*\*\*

My evening rounds, and the campus in general, became much stranger over the coming weeks. Like the mountain and fields nearby were fighting back at everything stood upon them, and quite literally so, as I soon discovered.

The first oddity was probably the upturned soil and conical mounds of rearranged garden mulch that had started sprouting across the university. We were in a La Niña year, so the dirt was clumpy, moist, black and deep brown. I spent almost half an hour on one of my post-midnight rounds in the first week, following a trail of soil that had weaved itself throughout the many corridors of Cotter Hall. To anyone watching I probably looked like an ant following a breadcrumb trail. I couldn’t find where it led.

After that, there was an incident across the clearing that separated Cotter Hall from the mountain and its stringybark forest proper. We were first alerted to it when, in an uncharacteristically loud manner, even for Australian birds, the kookaburras and cockatoos that shared the tree cover at the foot of the mountain erupted in unison. At three in the morning. One resident who peeked out the window couldn’t see much in the darkness, except for squadrons of our feathered friends lifting into the night, a typhoon of screeching fear.

She decided to route her daily jog by the tree line, and when she reached the site of that morning’s commotion just as I was concluding my shift, she buzzed me on the duty phone. I went over and saw with my own eyes a trench spanning a hundred metres across the tree line, as though it was carved by a giant tooth. Tree roots were exposed, some looking half eaten and frayed. Feathers littered the walls of the trench. Hoof prints.

Throughout all of this, our security cameras were pitifully incompetent. We weren’t allowed to look at them—only managers were—but when they tried to, they said that the cameras had all malfunctioned at the times when we though these events were happening. The dirt tracking. The tree and bird massacre. Waves of static that came and went, the managers said.

I even tried doing more than my four assigned rounds when I was on shift. I went every two hours, from sundown to sunrise. And while the dirt tracks kept appearing, the mounds gathering, I found no one and nothing. Only person I ran into, was Nate of all people.

I’ll admit, the hairs on my body were standing on end when I approached him. Duty called, however. I found him in the laundry room, which was a tiled, windowless basement cavity with an anti-septic, medical smell all throughout. He was pacing, arms crossed, between the rows of washing machines. 

“Nate, it’s like, two in the morning. Doing laundry?”

He looked up, eyes wide and fingernails blackened under the tips. “Oh, hey Mary.” He smelled like he’d been rolling around in the rain.

“When was the last time you took a shower?”

He laughed, wearily. I surveyed him, up and down. And then he pushed right past me, scurrying out without another word, feet *pitter-pattering* rather than stepping. I stood there for a moment, only realising after he was well out of my sight that none of the laundry machines were on, and he took no basket of clothes with him.

The next day, the mood within Cotter Hall’s staff nosedived. It was a twilight hour, and Trevor was just about to come on shift, cycling home from his last tutorial for the day. Just as he was rounding one of the Hall’s enormous towers to the bike sheds nestled out back, he heard someone scream. High-pitched, piercing, real and genuine terror and not just someone finding a redback in their jeans. 

It was Gabrielle, foetal on the grass by the bike shed door. No one else was around, and because the shed itself was like a bunker under a hill next to Cotter Hall, none of the residents would’ve seen a thing from their windows. Trevor thought he saw something ripple through the tree-line, but his focus was on Gabrielle’s left leg—or what was left of it. 

She was hyperventilating when he leapt off his bike and launched himself at the wound, and she passed out from the pain before the paramedics arrived, still breathing in irregular, staccato rhythm, occasionally coughing out what Trevor thought was mud. Our first aid course taught us how to deal with abrasions, impalements, burns, cuts, severed digits. We didn’t get taught how to deal with what looked like all of the above, all at one time, in one limb.

Trevor relayed it all to me when we did a weekend handover. He could barely keep his eyes open, and it looked like his uniform had a permanent sweat stain down the front. “She was choking on mud, for heaven’s sake,” he mumbled.

I hear he begged management for a week of leave and travelled back up to Sydney, to stay with his girlfriend, to de-stress.

She’d live, but from the gossip I overheard in the back-office, the leg certainly didn’t. 

From the window of my room I saw Nate and Ricky later that night, smoking out near the bike sheds where it happened. Nate flicked his cigarette into the ground and gesticulated sharply. Arguing. There was a shove. Ricky grabbed Nate by the collar, held a finger up to his face. A “you listen here,” kind of finger. They parted without further clamour.

Neither of them had taken up my offer of a chat. Underappreciated, yet again.

\*\*\*

With Trevor out of commission, I picked up his shift for the week—a Tuesday. A dead night, mostly, as students tended to save their money for cheap-o Thursday evenings at the two clubs in town, and Friday through Saturday to celebrate the week ending. I could do my rounds after 10PM and there wouldn’t be a sound in any of them, and it was even quieter once you had to do the outdoor perimeter sweep.

There was less dirt being tracked inside the Hall, so I was in a lighter mood, but the air all throughout Cotter Hall was still, delicate, encumbering. An errant word could be thrown, an ill-timed joke, an accidentally-too-loud-remark of the “curse” on the Fantastic Four, and the glass facades of Cotter Hall could come crashing inwards, burying us in our own reflections.

Even Ricky at around 8PM, formerly in the goon-induced stupor he relied upon to cope, sat soberly on the top edge of one of the sofas in the common room, elbows on knees, his frown and gaze marble and herculean. None of the televisions were on and not a single ping-pong ball or billiard stick clacked and echoed, as was usual practice. In front of him seated on the floor and scattered on the bean bags at his feet were mostly his circle, all of whom were present at the party where Catriona passed. I couldn’t see Nate.

When I passed through the common room though, on my way to the stairs up into the belly of the Hall, his expression changed. Almost hopeful, eyeing me as I hurried to change a door lock battery in Room 304.

By the time I made it to my first post-midnight patrol, the weather felt even thinner. Like the warmly lit, multi-tower apartment block and all the silhouetted, black forestry around it could be peeled back as though they were curtains. And the thing that bit off half of Gabrielle’s leg, the thing that has been turning this party-hard throng of students into modest mice, might just reveal itself, leaping and bounding towards me in the dark. Was it responsible for Catriona going over that railing too? I shuddered at the thought.

The corridors outside the apartments were uneventful, as were the study rooms on each floor and the common areas on Ground and in the basement. Time to loop the perimeter. I was tempted to cycle it, but I figured I could use the walk. Might also miss things, zipping around like a blue heeler. 

Before I knew it, I was at the spot where Trevor had found Gabrielle. As I’d mentioned before, the entrance to the bike shed (again, more like a bunker) faces Mount Curtin instead of Cotter Hall, a straight cut out of the hill as though it was split in two down the middle. Accordingly, no one could see me from the apartments, and I couldn’t see any part of civilisation. Only the grass clearing on either side, and what the bike shed’s fluorescent lights could illuminate of the tree cover at the foot of the mountain. 

Gate locked and latched properly. No signs of bolt cutter or circular saw damage to the steel grates that framed either side of the door into the bunker. 

Behind me, a low rumble, the faraway thunder of snorting. I turned towards the tree line. It looked like a man, or at least the shape of one, stocky about the chest, waist, legs. More snorting. From what little light the bike shed afforded, I could see a glimmer against a pillar of drool stretching down towards the earth. I squinted. Its head was much larger than a man’s.

It shrieked with a vacuum inhale through leathery lungs, a blood-boiling rumble from within its gut that pushed up into its throat and out into the world. The wail of a wild boar about to attack, and I watched that man-boar-thing collapse away from its bipedal stance, down onto all fours, and launch itself across the grass, hurtling towards me.

I swiped my master key into the bike shed lock and unlatched the door. I had no idea if it would hold. I clearly didn’t think too far ahead because the sheer number of bikes stacked up inside made it hard to swing wide enough—some had taken a tumble, and were blocking the path of the door. Wheezing, running off pure adrenaline, I gave another shove and saw several bikes tumble at the far end of the stack. Enough room for me to slide in. 

With a horse’s buck I slammed the gate shut and wheeled around to find myself facing the creature. It jammed its long head partially through the grates, its teeth catching on the metal, tusks preventing it from moving in any further. Another round of blood-curdling squeals. Its eyes were perfect circles, glazed over lapis for pupils and encircled in an unembellished white. Flat and inanimate but seething, widening and contracting with every snort. Longer hairs gathered around its snout like a beard, and at the crest of its skull, all unsheathing towards its nostrils of two half-moons, glistening and searching. 

The creature snorted and withdrew from the grate, regarding me, up and down. And then, it darted back towards the trees and dissipated, its silhouette withering into a kaleidoscope of shadows.

\*\*\*

Ricky was the first person I saw when I arrived back at the main entrance. 

I had picked the first bike I found without a lock and pedalled back to the residence like I was on the last leg of Tour de France. Skidded sideways on the concrete and tumbled, my hijab almost slipping down the back of my head. Had I worn it any looser, and without underlayers, I would’ve lost it in the bike race back to Cotter Hall and my ears would be grazed all over. When I scrambled back to my feet, he was hurrying to me from the elevator hall.

“We’ve got to talk. You’re like, the oldest student I know here and you’re trained to help stupid kids like us, right?”

I obliged, silent, but heaving with adrenaline. Couldn’t be any worse than what I had just dealt with.

We went to a corner of the common area, which was in a shroud of silence at this time of night. I’d thought we’d be heading up to his room, but I guess this made for a more neutral setting. “I think Nate wants to hurt me.”

Life is full of surprises. It took all my energy to be the stern, stoic RA, at that point. I asked what was making him think that.

“He’s been threatening me. Says it’s ‘not right that I get to be walking around after what happened.’ Says that I’ve ‘disrupted something fucking important,’ or thereabouts. Variations on the same themes. He’s lost the plot.”

I asked when. Past few nights. I matched it up in my head; it aligned well with that evening of Gabrielle being taken away, the night of their argument. I had to ask. “What triggered this?”

Ricky looked around, and then back at me. Starting into him harder now, I noticed he was more wrinkled, strained, weathered, than I’d ever seen him before. Couldn’t have been getting more than three hours of sleep a night. “You can’t tell a soul.”

I opened my mouth, paused, and gritted my teeth. I couldn’t promise that.

Fortunately, he went ahead anyway. The words unfurled out of his mouth in a cascade. “Catriona falling off the roof was an accident. But it was *our* accident. We’re normally cool with each other, but earlier that week she’d pissed all of us off. Came storming into the living room, opened the fridge, and pointed to her empty vegetable shelf. Screamed at us that we’ve been stealing her shit and this was *literally* the seventh time its happened and she wouldn’t deal with it any longer because she had exams and she was the only vegan in the flat and she needed to eat, and she needed the half kilo of sweet potatoes she would buy each time she went to the shops.

“Well, I had exams too. Important ones. Law ones, that you can’t fuck up. So, I lost my shit as well. This chaotic screaming match ensues, and Nate and Gabrielle are chiming in my favour, partly because we do the same subjects, and mostly because we hadn’t taken her fucking sweet potatoes. Catriona gets all pissy that we’re placing ourselves on a pedestal above her and her subjects.”

I scratched my head. Ricky probably noticed my eyes starting to glaze over.

“I say this, because the gag we pulled on her on that rooftop was picking her up and carrying her on our shoulders. Putter her on her own pedestal. We were all fairly wasted by that point, and Nate and I are big guys, plus Gabrielle, so she just let it happen. Don’t know if Catriona even remembered the argument by that point. Everyone was laughing. Not just the Fantastic Four, but everyone on that rooftop. Clapping, chanting. We start bobbing along with the chants and before we know it, we’re next to the railing and we’re off kilter.”

And there it was. Ricky was doubled over, looking only at the ground, but he heaved out a sigh that could’ve brought Catriona back to life, if her cadaver was in the room. A bold, bruising rush of blackwater after releasing the sluice gates. It must’ve felt good getting that off his chest.

I leaned back, trying to process. “And why is this driving Nate to want to hurt you?”

Ricky was choking back tears, by the sound of it. “Because I coached their stories. I told them that if they all stuck with the cover, nothing would happen to us. I don’t know why he’s crumbling all of a sudden, but it’s like he’s just bursting at the seams with guilt. I don’t think one of the other rooftop attendees is egging him on, because he’s the only one who’s making a fuss.”

Even more to process. My training kicked in, and I went into first responder mode. “We need to get you somewhere safe. Do you know where Nate is? Is anyone upstairs? You might need to pack an overnight bag.”

He shook his head. “Not sure where he went, but he’s not at home. I saw his Merc leave the carpark earlier.”

I sent him back upstairs to pack a bag. Essential documents, wallet-phone-keys, change of clothes only. I was glad I made no promises earlier because as I got back to the main office, sitting behind the counter shutters in the dark, illuminated only by the Windows home screen on the reception computers, I started making notes to relay to the police. This all sounded like something I could comfortably breach resident confidentiality over. 

That was when I saw something at the corner of my eye, far beyond the reception’s glass walls, down where the front gates to the residence are located. A black Mercedes-Benz, parked on the roadside behind the gum trees. Nowhere near the resident parking, but just far away to be out of sight for most. I couldn’t read the rego from here, and several rich sophomores had nice cars, but I took no chances.

Boots pounding against the asphalt, I made my way back across the quadrangle, past the bike I had crashed earlier in the evening, and towards the fire stairs, which I climbed three at a time until my calves started to give way.

Floor five was as still as ever. I’m barrelling so hard down the corridor to the Fantastic Four multi-share that I’m sure I woke someone up, but nothing moves. By the time I master key into their room without knocking, all I can hear is my blood thundering in my ears.

I let loose an ugly scream that’s part wail, part exasperated, breathless shock. 

In that same warm amber lighting that they’d deployed in their “wake” weeks ago, I saw Ricky face-up on the ground at the foot of that cursed wooden totem, welts and the violent, imprecise lacework of blunt force trauma embellished across his skull. His jeans around his shins and knees were deep maroon in the light, with one of his feet bent crooked. But his mouth. His mouth.

It was stretched out to its furthest extent in an “O” and filled with tightly packed soil. Wet, swallowing soil, condensed so tightly that there was no way Ricky was breathing through it. And someone had moulded it, shaped the mound so that it rose out of his mouth like a cone, like a volcano. Mud was streaked across Ricky’s eyes, shut, like a blindfold.

And knelt before him, back facing me, was Nate, clothes torn and sweaty. From where I stood, it looked like he was rubbing his cheeks. I called his name.

He turned. His eyes were black with mud. He was shovelling soil into his mouth, handful by handful, pushing it further and further back into his throat with his jaw unhinging like a snake. 

I kicked him onto his back. Not sure why. None of this was in my training. Nate started coughing and a chunk of soil came loose and cracked against the carpet. I rushed forward, trying to clear his airway, but he grabbed my neck, spluttering. As Ricky said, he was a big guy, twice my size.

“*Catriona,*” he rasped, eyes still glued shut with drying mud. “*He needed her food, feeding him without knowing it. And we just come along and kill her.*”

What the fuck. He loosened his grip as he talked, as though wanting me to hear.

“*He came to me every night. He kept telling me what needed to be done. To make things right.*”

I looked at the totem on the TV stand in the corner. Unmoving. Surrounded by empty shot glasses. The holes in its front I realised then looked more like boar’s nostrils than the eyes of a man.

The more he talked, the more his grip wavered. I found a gap, wriggled, and came loose, kicking and screaming. Nate wasted no time. All the soil that fell out of his mouth while trying to speak to me was in his hands again, and he shovelled, shovelled, shovelled it back in.

There was only so much that a small woman like me could do to a man that size, possessed either in actuality, or just of some perverse, urgent intent. So I ran.

\*\*\*

I resigned shortly after the incident, as you might imagine, once all of the enquiries were completed. Detective Haddad was back, in full force, and I spilled the beans about everything I was told that night. Everything I saw in that apartment. Went through the rigamarole of having the same questions asked again in different ways, by different investigators. I didn’t have to lie at any point, so it was straightforward throughout. I’m not sure if he was grateful that I gave him the truth, or if it just made his life more difficult, now that he had to upgrade his accidental death to manslaughter. 

In any case, two of the three parties to the initial Catriona accident were now deceased. One murdered. The other self-asphyxiated, as per the local paper. Gabrielle was still in hospital, now with an array of new visitors from Detective Haddad’s side of the patch. For a few weeks there they even had a protective officer sit with her overnight. Just as a precaution as they pieced together the information I had given them.

But while I didn’t lie, I didn’t tell them everything either. Not like it would have changed the outcome. I decided that my encounter with the boar creature wasn’t believable in the slightest, so I scrubbed that part of the night, and said that I’d run into Ricky at the end of a normal, uneventful round at approximately 1AM. Security cameras wouldn’t have shown anything down by the bike shed anyway.

When it came to Nate’s mid-strangulation utterances, I gave them all of that. But I said I had no idea what any of it meant. Not sure who was giving Nate these orders, or who he thought Catriona was feeding. Ramblings of a psychotic episode, perhaps. So no one had any reason to ask serious questions about the totem that sat in the corner for around a month, watching it all unfold, until I nabbed it on my frenzied sprint out of there.

Management was happy with me and my loyalty over the years, so they gave me stellar references for the next gig I landed. Call centre operator. Centrelink. Paid well, but I was, yet again, a glutton for misery, day-in, day-out. Little by little, the disturbances around campus simmered gently down into non-existence.

I wrapped up the PhD and settled into the call centre gig full time. With the extra money and time on my hands, I found it easier to forget about the events of my time at Cotter Hall. The frantic chasing of dirt tracks around the apartment block started to fade, as did the specifics of that final night I spent working there. The more mundane nights faded as well—the vomit clean-up, that emergency welfare checks. Just another duty that comes and goes, because it needs to, to pay the bills.

My only touchpoint with that god-forsaken job was my weekly hike up Mount Curtin, charting a careful, repeated path through the gum trees. I carry a backpack with me each time I go up, packed to the brim with tubers, root vegetables, sweet potatoes especially, judging by what happened to Catriona, and by my quick Google search of what boars from that part of the world like to eat. Also, a flask of liquor, for good measure. 

The totem sits there mostly undisturbed now. I’ve sheltered it under a collection of broad, flat rocks that tends to blend into the scenery surrounding one of the less-frequented offshoot tracks, especially with the stringybark trees peeling en masse, collapsing into blankets of tangled, concealing hair. I can’t imagine it would be *entirely* pleasing, with our high-altitude Australian clime being a far cry from the volcanic plains of the Philippines; but with my weekly offerings, I think this spirit, animal, creature, doesn’t mind too much.

So if you come across the pile of sweet potatoes I’ve left, the shot glass of hard liquor in the mountains, please don’t touch that. If you move any of it before he gets to it in the middle of the night, he won’t be happy. I’ll start receiving small conical mounds of soil on my doorstep, as I sometimes do when I need to travel out of town for a month, or when I simply forget my weekly routine. Just as a reminder of all the little, underappreciated duties one has.
