my name is not important 
since I am going to die here anyways , I should have listen to her warnings , I put myself into this hellhole and now I just have pay the price 

It all started in the late summer. I just got home from school and decided to have a sleepover with my friend Sarah.
Sarah and I were friends since first grade , We had a lot in common and she is the best person I ever knew.

"Jackie and you sure you want to have a sleepover? " She asked

"Yeah Why not , Your parents seem very chill about it ? " I answered

"Well I think it's a bit dangerous for you " her face showing a bit discomfort

"Naahh I sure I am gonna be fine I am just staying at your house it's not like am going outside in the dark " I said 

"Hugh so there's no convincing you then " She sighed then hand me a piece of paper

RULES FOR HOUSLHOLD 606 LAKESIDEVILE

RULE 1. Do not enter the basement IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

"What? Only one rule you could have told me " I said


The next day I went to her house
Everything is going fine until in heard a noise from the basement I went to check it out 

"Please HELP ME " a man's voice echoed in the basement

"Who are you? " I asked
"Please runaway it's now to late for you that fucking family is not what you think it is " I shouted
"My arm ... ahhh" he cried , Sensing danger I rushed in the save him forgetting that one rule

Inside was nothing but bright red blood
I saw the man's arm lying on the ground
' Is my friend a fucking murderer ' I think to myself but in reality it was more terrifying

In front of me is Sarah, blood soaking her white dress 
" Haven't I told you not go into the basement "  she said with a disappointing look
" You fucking murderer what the hell is wrong with you " I yelled I have never expected my friend to be a killer
" Oh " She said
"Then I guess I will have to meals then right father mother ?" She said while looking at the parents
There's something ood about them , their eyes have no life in it , they just looked like a shell of a human or if somebody took their souls away

No , they looked more like puppets being controlled, their movements are not human like .
Then I saw it , around there legs and arms are tenticles moving them around 

" Yes Puppeteer" their said in unison they voice sounded so similar, it's likely that the source from one thing; Sarah

" I genuinely want to be friends with you, unfortunately you can't go out alive " she said before stabbing with one of her tenticles
Before I died ,I saw a horrifying site ; hundreds of corpses attached to tenticles looking at me ,frowning
.
.
.
.
.

"Hello there Jackie how's the view down there "  Sarah asked

" It's Fine " I said , actually this place is not that bad......


Amity's POV

" Whoops That's another one , Doesn't the Puppeteer kill once a year? " I think to myself. The 606 household will glow red when the Puppeteer killed someone 
Maybe her killing schedule have changed.
