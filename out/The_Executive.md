  “Ms. Di Cesare will be with you very soon,” The receptionist said. “In the meanwhile, could I get you something? Coffee? Tea?”

  “Coffee’s fine,” I said. “Black, please.”

  “Of course Mr. Beach. And for your associates?”

  “Coffee for me too,” Mr. Jones said, “Two sugars, no milk.”

  “Same for me, only with milk,” Mr. O’Neal said.

&#x200B;

The receptionist looked expectantly at Mr. Harris who refused to make eye contact with her.

  “Just water,” he said, and when she turned to leave he watched her from the corner of his eye, as if she were a viper waiting to strike the moment that his guard was down. Personally, I thought that the overt suspicion was uncalled for. That poor girl probably had no idea who she was really working for. Hating her for it was pointless.

&#x200B;

I gave him a look once she’d left the board room, but he really couldn’t have seemed to care less. If we weren’t in the middle of a hunt, I’d have given him hell for that but I held my tongue. 

Despite Harris’ attitude, this was not the time to lose one's head. Not when we were in the lion's den, waiting for the Lion to walk in.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

  “We’ve got a rare opportunity right now,” I’d told Mr. O’Neal. We’d met up at a bar about a month ago to go over some work matters and were sitting in a quiet, isolated little booth. “Vampires are bolder now than they’ve been in centuries. I figure they think that since they’ve finally gotten a little more organized, they’re safe. Whatever it is, I keep hearing about new vamps popping up all over the west coast. They’re like goddamn cockroaches. You kill one, and there’s like fifty more waiting in the wings.”

&#x200B;

  “You are aware that isn’t exactly a new development, right Dave?” O’Neal asked. “It’s been that way since the dawn of time.”

  “Not like this,” I said. “It’s like the freaking vampire renaissance right now. I’ve heard a few old names coming up too. Konstantin Saragat, Roman Spencer even the Di Cesare family.”

That made O’Neal raise an eyebrow.

&#x200B;

  “The Di Cesare’s are back?” He asked. 

  “According to Jordan Sweeney, they’re moving out in the open again. He’s got a line on most of them too, and he’s looking for guys who are up to the task. He’s already got Ed Kelley putting together a group of guys to go after one in San Francisco. Eris The Maenad… not sure how the hell he plans to kill a Maenad in the middle of San Francisco, but it’s more of a shot than we’ve had in centuries.”

&#x200B;

O’Neal still didn’t seem sold.

  “Are you even sure we should be taking it?” He asked, “Look, I’m not trying to say we shouldn’t be going after them but I’ve heard more than enough about the Di Cesare’s to know that provoking them would be kicking the hornet's nest. Every single story I’ve ever heard about them tends to end with: ‘*And then everybody died horribly.*’ Anyone with that kind of reputation isn’t someone you should challenge lightly.”

&#x200B;

I’d have been foolish to pretend that he didn’t have a point. Most members of the Brethren Knights knew the stories of the Di Cesare family. Once upon a time, they had been a coven of 12 powerful witches, one for each sign of the zodiac. Each one had been endowed with vampirism by their ‘*mother*’ an old vampire in her own right, who had saved them from their deserved execution. In 1654, they drove our organization out of Venice, slaughtering hundreds of men and leaving the canals red with blood. We didn’t gain a foothold back in the city until it fell to Napoleon almost 150 years later. In all of our recorded history, there was only one record of one of anyone ever killing a Di Cesare sister, and even that story ended with the remaining sister's bloody retaliation and subsequent disappearance. 

&#x200B;

Some brave souls had tried to change that across the past few centuries, making a move on the Di Cesare’s whenever they popped up again although those men were either killed or never heard from again.

Challenging any of the sisters would be difficult… but I knew that.

&#x200B;

  “You would certainly need to go into it with an appropriate strategy,” I said. “And I might just know how to pull it off.”

  “Would you now?” O’Neal asked, still not convinced. “I’m sure those words have been uttered a thousand times through the past few centuries, haven’t they? You know, I can’t imagine any of the Grandmasters would sign off on this.”

  “According to Sweeney, Grandmaster Ivory has already given this whole operation his blessing.”

&#x200B;

O’Neal raised an eyebrow at that.

  “And you believed him?” He asked, “Not to question the man's integrity, but he’s been known to ask forgiveness, rather than permission. Coming from him, having Grandmaster Ivory’s blessing could mean: ‘*Oh I’ll bet he’ll be so happy when he hears we took down another Di Cesare!*’ with ‘*When he hears*’, being the operative words.”

  “Well, whether he’s lying or not he’s got some significant support behind him already,” I said. 

&#x200B;

  “Ed Kelley?” He asked, before scoffing. “Not to question Kelley’s distinguished career, but he is not the man you bring in for a job like this. Kelley is a hammer. He’s a good vampire hunter. But there aren’t ordinary vampires. No, what you need for a job like this is a scalpel.” 

  “Why do you think I’m talking to you?” I asked and that actually got a chuckle out of O’Neal. He took a sip of his drink.

&#x200B;

  “Flattery will get you nowhere, old friend,” He said.

  “What about strategy? Like I said, I’ve got a plan in mind.”

  “Fine, you buy me another drink and I’ll tell you why it won’t work,” He said.

I took him up on that offer, and waved the waitress over to order another round for the two of us.

&#x200B;

  “You ever read about the Kennard Assassination in 92?” I asked.

O’Neal almost laughed.

  “You’re joking, right?” He asked, “That job was a disaster!”

  “Yeah, but the problem wasn’t the strategy, it was the target,” I said. “They were trying to kill an Ancient God. They were all doomed from the start. But the strategy… *that* was sound! They set her up at a business meeting, and they used a Malvian ice dagger to deliver a killing blow from behind. If they hadn’t been trying to kill a God, they could’ve walked right out of her conference room and been gone before anyone realized what had happened. Something like that would absolutely work on one of the Di Cesare’s.”

&#x200B;

O’Neal raised an eyebrow. I could see him thinking it over.

  “Where would we get Malvian ice?” He asked, “We only ever had some in the 90s because we’d confiscated it from some dead witch, and I don’t know about you but I’m not screwing around with some pagan rituals to try and get some.”

  “Well now you’ve just answered your own question,” I said. “We just need to find a witch who can be persuaded to forge us a Malvian ice dagger… and I might just have a line on one.”

&#x200B;

The waitress brought us our fresh pints and I took a long sip of mine.

  “We get the blade, we get ourselves in front of one of the Di Cesare’s and then we’re golden,” I said. “We’ve got a weapon that can actually kill one… and if it sweetens the deal, I know *exactly* which member of the family this’ll work on.”

&#x200B;

O’Neal was still thinking it over, but I could clearly see which way he was leaning

  “If I’m the one overseeing the logistics…” He finally said, “If I personally screen every individual we bring on board here… and if we can guarantee a clean escape immediately following a confirmed kill, then maybe.”

  “Maybe is good,” I said.

  “Get the Malvian ice first. Then, you come and talk to me again,” He said. 

&#x200B;

It wasn’t a No.

And I could work with that.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

The home of Allison Pace was quiet in the dead of night, with light being visible in only one upstairs window. I only knew of Pace through what I’d been told, although what I’d been told was more than enough. She was the Vice President of *Floor Sale*, a chain of growing retail stores that I think may be better off unnamed. Hardly the wealthiest woman in the world… but still rich enough to own a nice house in an expensive neighborhood, among various other luxuries.

&#x200B;

Mr. Jones sat in the drivers seat of the car beside me, smoking a cigarette as we studied the house. Watching him from the corner of my eye, I think he might have almost been looking forward to this.

&#x200B;

  *“It’s sort of an obsession amongst folks like her,”* He’d told me over dinner a few nights before. *“This one idiot started screwing around with magic trying to get mystical powers or something like that, and now the rest of them want in on it too. It’s like a new gold rush for these morons.”*

*“And you’re certain she’s been dealing with it too?”* I’d asked.

*“I’ve got a friend in accounting and he’s noticed her making some very strange purchases on the down low,*” He said. *“I did a bit of reconnaissance the other night too. She’s got a room in her basement full of all sorts of interesting books. Grimoires, an altar. Mark my words, she can get you some Malvian ice.”*

&#x200B;

That had been all I’d needed to hear.

&#x200B;

I never really savored the violence of my Brotherhood… but when you’re part of an organization that hunts monsters, it’s necessary to get your hands dirty. I saw the light upstairs go off and looked over at Mr. Jones.

  “Looks like Pace is turning in for the night,” I said.

  “Good. We’ll give her another hour to get comfy and then we make our move.”

That sounded alright to me.

&#x200B;

When our hour was up, Mr. Jones and me put on our masks and got out of his car, bringing only our guns and an attache case we’d brought with *supplies*.

&#x200B;

We went toward the back gate, moving casually as if we were meant to be there. I watched as Mr. Jones knelt down before her lock, took a simple lockpick out of his pocket, and set to work. It was a little exciting watching him in action. I’d known Randall Jones by reputation long before I met him, and he was by all accounts the king of discretion. I always thought that was a useful tool to have in our line of work. Too many of the Brethren are content to rely on sheer brute force to deal with our enemies, and maybe that was enough in centuries past. But we live in a world where monsters hide in plain sight. Werewolves gather at local bars, vampires pay mortgages and witches work in finance. In a world like this - discretion is the way of the future. And with Mr. Jones, all he really needed was an address. If you wanted a monster dead, all you needed to do was provide him with that and one morning they simply would not wake up. 

&#x200B;

He had Pace’s lock open in less than a minute and the door quietly swung open. 

&#x200B;

We ascended the stairs together, quietly surveying the silent house before heading toward the bedroom. Allison Pace lay sleeping in her bed with her back to us and we kept our guns trained on her as we drew nearer. I set down the attache case before taking out my phone to shine the light on the back of her neck.

&#x200B;

  “No attribution spell,” I noted. I hadn’t expected there to be one. Only the most powerful witches knew how to do them and they were by all accounts, difficult to deal with. A spell like that made it so that any damage you inflicted upon the caster was instead inflicted onto you and finding ways to get around it usually required some creative thinking. 

  “Alright,” I said. “Wake her up.”

Mr. Jones went to do just that, only for the room to suddenly move around us. 

&#x200B;

Pace sank into the mattress before us, before disappearing completely and the room grew darker around us.

We’d been made.

&#x200B;

  *“You’re not just here to rob me, are you?”* A voice asked from the darkness. *“No… you’re something else.”*

&#x200B;

Mr. Jones and I looked around, guns at the ready in case she made her move. But in such absolute darkness, it was nearly impossible to see. The only light streamed in through the window and even that suddenly seemed so small. I felt that old familiar sensation of my heart starting to race. A quiet fear crept through my mind. A natural response to being in danger.

&#x200B;

We didn’t bother responding to her. There wasn’t much of a point talking to things like her. All we needed to do was stay alive.

&#x200B;

I heard movement off to my left and knew she was coming. I turned, firing twice and trying to aim low so that I would only wound her. I heard her cry out in pain before feeling a dagger rake across my chest, cutting open my shirt and leaving a gash in my flesh. I felt the air on my face as she slashed at me again, only to miss. 

&#x200B;

In the darkness, I could hear Pace panting heavily. I knew she was wounded, but she hadn’t given up the ghost just yet. 

  *“What do you want with me?”* She demanded, *“I haven’t done anything to you!”*

  “You’re a witch… it’s reason enough,” Mr. Jones said. 

&#x200B;

I heard Pace hesitate for a moment, and in the darkness, beside me I saw Mr. Jones tense up.

 *“Randall Jones?”* She asked, sounding genuinely surprised. *“What are you-?”*

I fired again in the direction of her voice, hearing yet another cry of pain. The darkness flickered around us and I could see the shadow of Allison Pace nearby, leaning against the wall for support.

&#x200B;

I aimed at her, drawing closer.

  “Knife down, witch,” I warned. “Don’t make me shoot you again.”

She hesitated, glaring at me with icy blue eyes through the darkness… before finally giving in.

&#x200B;

The shadows faded and when they did all that was left was a woman in her fifties with messy blonde hair, leaning weakened against the wall. Her knife clattered to the ground as she glared up at us, waiting for one of us to kill her.

  “What… do you want with me?” She rasped.

I looked over at Mr. Jones who picked up the attache case from by the door.

&#x200B;

  “You’re going to bring us something,” I said. “Something we need. Do it… and we’ll permit you to live. You may leave this place, and find somewhere else to study your blasphemous texts.”

  “And if I refuse?” She asked.

  “Then you’re of no use to us, and won’t live to see the morning,” I replied.

She knew that I wasn’t joking.

&#x200B;

Mr. Jones opened up the attache case, and Pace looked down at the contents, confused.

  “What’s this?” She asked.

  “Everything you need to procure a dagger of Malvian ice,” I replied, reaching into the case. “Human bones, obtained from the local coroner this morning. And cypress incense. You will conduct the ritual and I will follow you into the Gloom, while Mr. Jones waits here, to ensure my safe return.”

&#x200B;

It was a risky move… I knew that. But I didn’t think that Pace had the knowledge to do much more than open a door and forge the dagger… and if I was wrong, well, then I simply wasn’t fit to deal with a Di Cesare if this was all it took to kill me.

&#x200B;

Judging by the look on Pace’s face, she knew that there was more I wasn’t saying.

  “You want a dagger of Malvian ice?” She asked, “Why?”

  “That’s our concern, not yours,” I said. “Now will you perform the ritual, or do we have to find somebody else?”

She wasn’t brave enough to say no. I saw that in her eyes. 

&#x200B;

  “I can’t bend down,” She said. “You shot me in the stomach, you’ll have to construct the altar… and it’s better to do this either downstairs or outside. The altar must be burned.”

I nodded at Mr. Jones.

  “Downstairs, then,” I said.

&#x200B;

It was around three in the morning when we’d finished constructing the altar of bones and set the incense burner inside of it. We set the cypress incense alight, letting it burn before Pace and I approached the sweet smoke.

  “You need to breathe it in deep,” She said. “Venturing into the Gloom isn’t natural. You must retain constant focus while you’re in there or else you’ll drift back to the living world.”

&#x200B;

I nodded, making sure she breathed in the smoke first before doing the same. Mr. Jones watched us from across the room, as we inhaled the smoke… and drifted away.

&#x200B;

I’ve never partaken in any sort of ritual before, so doing this was a little bit exciting. I felt myself drifting out of my body and through the smoke that enshrouded us. Then when at last my feet touched the ground again, we were somewhere new. A pinkish mist filled the air and beyond it, I could see a serene but mostly empty forest.

&#x200B;

Pace was beside me, letting the mist sift through her fingers. As she did so, I realized that I didn’t have my gun with me. She watched me out of the corner of my eye as I searched for it, before scoffing.

  “Your gun is with your body, back in our world,” She said. “Here… you and I exist as spirits. This is a place for dead souls. We’re not meant to enter this place physically.”

&#x200B;

She reached into her nightgown, taking out the wooden dagger she’d used to attack us earlier.

  “Then why do you have that?” I asked.

  “This? This isn’t a weapon you simple minded idiot. This is a tool. Something that’s bound to me. I need it to craft your weapon.”

&#x200B;

I didn’t respond, only kept a close eye on her as she used the dagger to draw a circle around her in the dirt, before stabbing it into the ground. Then, I watched as she collected the ice, twirling the pinkish mist around her fingers, gently molding it into something that looked like a dagger, and pausing periodically to carve a new rune into it.

&#x200B;

The process took longer than I’d thought it would. The dagger needed to be forged inch by inch… but when it was done, she stood and offered it to me willingly.

  “This is what you came for…” She said, “Take it and leave me alone.”

I looked down at the dagger she offered, before gently taking it from her hands.

  “Of course,” I replied.

And without a further word I plunged it into her heart.

&#x200B;

Pace just looked into my eyes, exhaling in pain… but looking unsurprised. I imagine she must have known this was coming. If nothing else, I could respect her for making her peace with it. Slowly her body began to fade, growing steadily less solid.

  “I liar… I thought so,” She said her voice both bitter and melancholy. “I’d say that I hope I’ll see you soon, David Beach… but we both know your soul has no place here. You’re destined for something else. Fate is a wheel, Mr. Beach. What you do comes back to you, in one way or another.”

&#x200B;

  “Say whatever you want,” I said, looking down at the dagger she had forged for me.

  “Whatever you think you’re going to kill with that… I hope it makes you suffer,” She replied and a moment later, she was gone.

I stared at the spot where she had been, before allowing myself to slip back into my body.

&#x200B;

Mr. Jones stood beside me, as I opened my eyes again and when I looked over, Allison Pace lay dead beside me. The Malvian ice sat cold in my hand, and I looked knowingly down at the dagger.

Our work here was done.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Mr. Jones had arranged the meeting through a business associate of his. Officially, we were here to discuss a partnership between Mr. Jone’s company and the Di Cesare Diamond House and to that end, we were expecting to meet with Claire Di Cesare herself.

&#x200B;

Claire Di Cesare was admittedly probably one of the easiest of the Di Cesare sisters to find. While the family historically kept a low profile, the Di Cesare Diamond House had always been their primary source of income and a member of the family was always the one pulling all the strings. While in the past, they’d often done it from behind the scenes using some stuffed shirt as a proxy, lately they’d been taking the reigns more directly, and more often than not it was Claire Di Cesare serving as the face of the company. She’d changed her name a few times over the decades, but she was usually the one running the show whenever her mother was away.

&#x200B;

Mr. O’Neal had gone through our plan over and over again. Once Claire Di Cesare joined us, we would let Mr. Jones control the conversation. We knew that he would be able to do so the most convincingly out of all of us. 

&#x200B;

Roughly half an hour into the meeting, Mr. Harris’s phone would ring (or more accurately, his alarm would go off) and he would get up to answer it, moving behind Ms. Di Cesare as he did. It would be at that point that he would take the Malvian ice dagger from his jacket and plunge it into the back of her neck. Claire Di Cesare would inevitably have an attribution spell on her, and we reasoned that stabbing her there should neutralize it in the event that we failed to kill her. We did not expect the spell to activate against Malvian ice… but in the event that it did, it wouldn’t be us who died. It would be Mr. Harris. He understood the risks, of course, and he had agreed to them.

&#x200B;

Even if he died, he would be honored as the first man to kill a Di Cesare since the late 1700s. I really don’t think there could be a higher honor.

&#x200B;

Down the well lit but empty hall outside of the conference room, I could see the receptionist coming back in with a tray, carrying our drinks. She let herself in and with a calm, professional smile set them down in front of us.

  “Thank you,” I said smiling right back at her as I took a sip of my coffee. It was perfect.

&#x200B;

Mr. Harris, still set on being an ass declined to so much as acknowledge the girl when she gave him his drink. He glared at her as she left, just as he’d glared at her when she’d come in earlier. I was past scolding him at this point. No point in it, really.

&#x200B;

  “Is everything to your liking, gentlemen?”

The voice that spoke to us made me look up suddenly, and I could see the other men with me doing the same.

&#x200B;

We had not seen anyone else enter the room aside from the receptionist, and yet we were not alone.

&#x200B;

Sitting at the head of the table was a well put together woman who looked to be somewhere in her early thirties. Her short hair barely came to her neck and was styled in a very tidy bob cut. She wore a black blazer over a white button down shirt and a modest skirt. Her tie was plain and black, with a simple golden tie clip being the only standout item on her wardrobe. She was smiling at us, but the smile looked manufactured. I might even go so far as to describe it as robotic. It didn’t reach her eyes which were dark and expressionless. Her hands were neatly folded on the desk in front of her, although I could just barely catch a glimpse of a tattoo on her wrist displaying a *Capricorn* sign. 

&#x200B;

This was Claire Di Cesare.

&#x200B;

  “Yes, of course!” Mr. Jones said, “I’m sorry Ms. Di Cesare, we didn’t see you come in!”

  “No apologies necessary, I just sat down,” She replied. “Now… shall we get started? You’re with…”

  “Floor Sale, we’re a smaller department store brand but we’ve got a number of locations in Texas, New Mexico and Louisiana!”

&#x200B;

  “Ah, yes. Now I remember!” She said, “So, you’re interested in carrying Di Cesare brand jewelry?”

  “We’re looking to offer more luxury goods to our customers and expand our market a little bit,” Mr. Jones said. “We think that partnering with Di Cesare is a good first step and could open some doors for us. And, we think it might do your brand some good in turn?”

  “Oh? That’s a very bold claim, Mr…?”

  “Randall Jones,” He said.

  “Mr. Jones? Like the song! Very charming.”

&#x200B;

Mr. Jones smiled meekly but didn’t comment on that.

  “We’ve positioned our brand as being a little more price friendly. Which I understand, may not necessarily mesh with what Di Cesare is generally seen as. But like I said, we want to start offering a more upscale experience and I am aware that you’ve been looking into more cost effective lines of product. Hell, considering your history with synthetic diamonds you’re really some of the best equipped people for the job.”

  “So you believe that we have aligning goals?” She asked.

  “Exactly,” Mr. Jones replied. 

&#x200B;

While he worked his magic, I took another sip of my coffee before looking over at Mr. Harris again. The kid seemed a little agitated… maybe too agitated. I hoped to God he wasn’t about to blow our cover.

&#x200B;

  “I see your point,” Ms. Di Cesare said, “But if we’re going to discuss any kind of distribution agreement, I’m going to need to have a guarantee of ROI. How much data have you collected regarding sales? Or I suppose I may need to ask, how soon could you have data for me?”

  “I’ve actually got some numbers for you right now,” Mr. Jones said, reaching for his laptop to get into the powerpoint segment of our presentation. 

&#x200B;

So far, so good it seemed…

&#x200B;

All we needed to do was wait for Mr. Harris’s alarm to go off,  so he could get up to take his ‘phone call’.

&#x200B;

I took another sip of my coffee, only to pause when I noticed something at the bottom of the cup.

&#x200B;

A symbol that I recognized, even if I couldn’t see the entire thing.

&#x200B;

It was the symbol of the zodiac sign ‘*Capricorn*’ the same one that Claire Di Cesare had tattooed on her wrist. I looked over toward Mr. O’Neal who had turned a shade paler. His eyes locked with mine, and I realized that he’d seen the exact same thing I had at the bottom of his cup.

&#x200B;

Claire Di Cesare’s eyes shifted from side to side, first toward Mr. O’Neal and then to me. Her robotic smile remained ever present. 

&#x200B;

She knew.

&#x200B;

Mr. Harris was staring at us too, and I could see the realization in his eyes. I think the only one who hadn’t realized what was going on yet, was Mr. Jones who was too busy playing his part to be looking at us.

  “So, based on the sales of our existing jewlery brand, there is absolutely a market for affordable jewlery here, and I believe it is highly likely that with the Di Cesare brand name attached, that market will only grow.”

&#x200B;

  “You’ve mispronounced the name Di Cesare three times now,” She said and Mr. Jones paused.

  “Excuse me…?” He asked.

  “It’s not Dee Caesar… that would be either a deceased Roman Emperor or a salad. It’s Dee Ches-Ar-Ay… do you understand? Dee Ches-Ar-Ay.”

Mr. Jones turned slightly red.

  “I… of course!” He said, “I’m very sorry!”

&#x200B;

  “You know I find it incredibly disrespectful when someone walks in to a meeting and can’t even pronounce the name of my company properly. Although of course, not as disrespectful as I find coming to a meeting with the intention of killing me. That’s simply not good business.”

&#x200B;

Mr. Harris moved, grabbing the Malvian ice dagger from under his jacket as he lunged at her. Claire Di Cesare just casually waved a hand and hurled him against a nearby wall. The dagger slipped out of his hand, before gliding over to the desk, where it came to a rest in Claire’s waiting hand.

  “Sloppy. You used the exact same tactic in 1992, did you not? I recall it not being successful then either… although I suppose that had more to do with the choice in target, didn’t it? Either way…”

&#x200B;

She stood up from her seat and adjusted her tie.

  “I would applaud your attention to detail and the lengths you went to prepare for today. However, it was the few mistakes you did make that permitted this whole production of yours to unravel. Would you like me to expand on that?”

&#x200B;

None of us answered so she seemed to take that as a yes.

  “The recent death of Allison Pace was a signifigant tip off to me… one of my sisters was familiar with her. Not closely so, but aware that she was interested in this silly little magic rush some people have been following. When she died during some sort of arcane ritual, I made a few calls. You really should have cleaned up the crime scene more… burning the house down was a start, but you left the altar behind. After that it wasn’t really that difficult to figure out that somebody had exploited her to gain access to Malvian ice and a simple process of elimination determined who the most likely culprits might be. Although that of course is not the most damning piece of evidence. I only had suspicions that you weren’t on the level when you contacted me… but your associates little stunt in San Francisco last week confirmed it.”

&#x200B;

Little stunt? What was she talking about?

&#x200B;

Claire’s eyes met mine, before narrowing.

  “You don’t know what I’m talking about, do you?” She asked, before shaking her head.

  “Some of your people made a move on my sister Eris, recently. You weren’t very subtle about it. I’m not entirely sure why you people thought you could kill a Maenad in the middle of a party in San Francisco… but it worked out for you about as well as expected.”

&#x200B;

Oh God.

&#x200B;

Ed Kelley.

&#x200B;

Of course he’d failed. O’Neal had been right about him… and it seemed that he’d been the one who’d truly damned us.

&#x200B;

Mr. Harris was starting to pick himself up again, and Claire gave another casual wave of her hand, throwing him back into the wall.

  “Well…” O’Neal said quietly. He hadn’t moved from his seat while Claire had been talking and though he was trying to stay calm, I could tell he was terrified.

&#x200B;

  “Seems we’ve made some mistakes ourselves,” He said.

  “It seems you have,” Claire replied. “Once I became convinced you were here with less than professional intentions, I took the liberty of looking into you further. It only confirmed what I already knew. I will be completely honest with you, Even if your offer was legitimate and in good faith, our family has not forgotten your past sins. There is nothing you can offer us and nothing we will accept, in business or in any other enterprise.”

 “Of course,” Mr. O’Neal said. “So… how exactly does this play out from here.”

&#x200B;

 “Oh, it’s all very simple,” Claire replied. “This conversation ends with you getting up, walking away, and explaining to your employers that we would like to be left alone.”

I saw Mr. O’Neal’s brow furrow as he looked at me.

  “Excuse me?” I asked.

  “Believe me… that’s not how I would have chosen to deal with you,” Claire said, “However… if I were to simply slaughter you here and now, my Mother would consider that an escalation, and that is something she would like to avoid. I suppose I do see her point. It's not currently practical to deal with you as we did in Venice all those centuries ago. Not in todays modern age. However, should circumstances change…”

&#x200B;

She threw Mr. Harris into the wall again just for fun. This time he hit it hard enough to leave an indent in the drywall. All the while, Claire just stared at us, her cold smile never once faltering. 

  “The three of you may leave…” She said, “Although you…” Her attention turned to Harris now.

  “You will remain with me.”

  “W-what…?” He rasped.

  “Why?” O’Neal demanded.

  “Compensation for my time,” She replied. “Don’t worry. I won’t be killing him. Once we’re done, he will also be free to go.”

&#x200B;

  “That’s not going to work!” O’Neal snapped, and in an instant, he’d pulled his gun.

Claire just stared at him with an unimpressed look.

  “By all means, shoot me,” She said. “See where that gets you.”

  “I don’t have to shoot you,” O’Neal growled, “I just need to shoot them…” He gestured to the door to the conference room, “I can turn this day into a living nightmare for you without laying a finger on you!”

&#x200B;

Claire still looked unimpressed. She sighed, before raising a hand and giving another nonchalant flick of her wrist.

&#x200B;

O’Neal wasn’t thrown back like Harris was though. Although I did see his body tense up. He let out a quiet gasp, as a trickle of blood dribbled out of his nose.

  “Wha…” He rasped before falling suddenly, hitting the desk and crashing, lifeless to the ground.

  “Oh no, how unfortunate… Mr. O’Neal has suffered a fatal but preventable brain hemorrhage. I suppose it only goes to show how important it is to take care of your health…” Her eyes were on us now.

&#x200B;

Mr. Jones was dead silent, mouth hanging slightly open as he failed to find the words. All I could do was stare down at Mr. O’Neal’s corpse. Beside us, I saw Mr. Harris rise to his feet, a look of utter terror on his face. 

  “Wait for me in my office,” Claire said coolly, before dismissing him with a wave of her hand, and like a perfect puppet, he marched out of the room.

&#x200B;

  “Is our business here concluded?” She asked, “Or will there be any other tragic accidents today?”

A small part of me wanted to still try and fight her. I wondered if maybe I could reach that dagger of ice…

But no.

&#x200B;

Looking into Claire Di Cesare’s eyes, I knew she was waiting for me to try and I knew she’d kill me the moment I did. 

&#x200B;

With the dagger in hand, she finally turned and headed for the door.

  “Goodbye gentlemen, I trust you’ll find your own way out,” She said and just like that, she was gone. 

&#x200B;

Mr. Jones and I stood in stunned silence for a moment, before deciding that the only thing left for us to do was to [leave.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/)
