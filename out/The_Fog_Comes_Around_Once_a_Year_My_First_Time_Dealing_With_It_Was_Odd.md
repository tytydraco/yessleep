I want to start this by apologizing for the long set up but I feel it's important to have and also stating a few things, you can call me Alex, I moved into town with my cat, I wasn't born here, there's also a pretty big wall around town, okay so I've been living in this little town for around 5 years I moved in because the rent was cheap for the house I wanted, the neighborhood seemed nice enough, it's near my job, and the local crime is almost nonexistent, so all's good right? No, not really there's this weird thing that happens, It would be normal, even pretty if it weren't for the fact it only happens once a year and if it didn't do what it does, a thick dense black fog that looks mixed with a fire rainbow or an oil spill in the sun, the fog is relatively predictable the day before it happens but any time other the that nobody knows when it will happen, so gods help you if you somehow sleep through the day before it happens.

I should probably tell you about my first time I experienced the fog, be warned my memories are kinda muddy so there won't be any quotation marks when some speaks (sorry if that's annoying to read), it was my first year here, it had only been a few months since I moved in, it was a relatively cold winter and it wasn't much better inside mainly because of the fact most folks can't get to the heating system in my house so it was way out of date I even worried a couple times it would catch on fire, but while I was in small talk with my neighbor, well the more correct thing to say would be my neighbor walked up to me while I was weeding my garden, when rather suddenly the smell like rotten eggs hit me like a truck the pale clouds that were overhead turned dark and heavy, Don, my neighbor told me that he had to go and stock up and I should as well and that the fog stays for days at a time, it was food shopping day so I had no real reason NOT to get things.

I was after all, running low on the food my cat's vet had proscribed and I had been meaning to get a second space heater, my cat, Toast, the old boy likes how warm the heaters are, but anyway food was low enough I felt like I should go and get something for the next couple of weeks, I don't like to go to the store it's bright and I get mentally overstimulated easily, so I just grab stuff for 2-3 weeks that I can just put into a freezer and pop in the oven so I can limit the amount of time I spend out and people-ing, I'm rambling sorry, I'll cut the whole shopping trip out nothing really eventful happened other than more folks in the store, then that guy, dude thinks he's a dragon and was making a ruckus while trying to horde milk, I just grabbed a jug and ignored him as he yelled at me to come back and fight him, he's all bark, you know I once saw him get decked by one of those kids wearing gas masks, sorry, I have lots of stories but you're here for the fog gotta keep on track.

Anyway, after my shopping trip I came back with my normal stuff, milk, couple boxes of cereal, microwave meals, cake mix, meals I can just throw in the oven, flour, eggs, some ice cream, Toast's cat food, and water bottles, I won't touch the water in my house with a ten foot pole unless I absolutely need to, and you wouldn't either, the stuff looks like blood if you let it run long enough I know it's probably just weirdly high amounts of iron I'm still not touching it, anyhow I set up the heater I got, Toast decided that this heater was his new favorite thing in the house, guess that puts me in the third place box, right below the catnip mice he rips in half and drowns in his water fountain, well after setting up what was apparently now Toast's heater I grabbed a bag of fries and tossed em in the oven along with an actually seasoned chicken breast, not like the ones my dad makes, I love him but that man has seemingly only heard whispers of the word "seasoning,"

I woke up to the sharp metallic scent of blood, I don't know what's weirder how it physically hurt to smell, or how this was the only time it happened, my lungs felt like they were about to burst, it was dark I felt like I was being crushed under debris. My skin felt like it was housing millions of maggots slowly eating out of my skin, I grabbed at my skull, when I couldn't feel my hands I began scratching at my face trying to feel something ANYTHING, and I did I felt something let go of my face and what seamed like a tube slide out of my esophagus then out of my mouth. I opened my eyes fast enough to see a pale, thin, boney, and all to long hand disappear into my closet, I went to look in my closet although that wasn't going to be until I grabbed a pipe wrench, when I did the poorly taped down label scratched my left hand it wasn't deep but it did sting.

I slowly and incredibly silently crept one foot in front of the other toward the door, reaching for the small wooden knobs on the slightly open closet door, the loud creak that erupted from the door and I flinched at how unexpected it was inside, nothing but the clothes I had, I looked left and I looked right, hell I even looked up, nothing not a trace of whatever had gone in and I KNEW it couldn't have gotten out want to know how I knew, well I'll tell you, I keep my tools next to my bed I don't have to look away from the closet to grab any of them, and after what I saw I wasn't going to let where that thing slinked to out of my sight, so unless my closet is a portal to the land of oz, I don't believe it left, however due to the fact it clearly wasn't there I checked the floor to see if it left any blood I could follow, I saw thick green blood but it lead to the mirror of the vanity pressed to the foot of my bed, no where near my closet, you would need to go around the bed to get to the closet from where the blood started.

Somehow I had managed to get it in my head that there was a leak in the pipes and I was imagining everything that had happened that morning but I did have a small pit in my stomach that felt like it was starting to become a sinkhole. Looking outside it was dark and monochromatic like someone slapped a grayscale filter on the outdoors and tinted it purple, it was unsettling, Toast decided I was moving to slow with breakfast and started biting my shins.

The sound of hooves mixed with slapping caught my attention it trailed from the distance almost imperceptible to my front door in a loud cacophony I took a peak out of a second floor window to see a centipede of meat like if you took thin strips of beef and draped it over ground meat that hadn't really died yet, writhing, squirming, crying out in pain, long nerves weaving themselves around like undersea grass, it had multiple heads and from what I counted there were the heads of two to five cows, three to seven pigs, at least ten sheep, a few deer, and a single human, the human head wad the only one with skin, most of the things legs were cloven hooves however there was a pair of human legs and a set of arms, the eyes in the sockets of the animals skulls locked on to me as this thing backed up, turned to the window and began climbing the side of my house the facade of my home crumbling being marred under it's weight.

There was creaking behind me it sounded like wet footsteps one two, one two, left right, left right, this along with the snapping of the beams from outside had me frozen, the feeling of a cold hand on my shoulder, the feeling of the hardwood floor suddenly under me, then the room got dark. From my place on the floor I looked up to see a child, wearing a gas mask holding a single thin, long, and pale finger up to where her mouth would be clearly shushing me, I couldn't see her face but I knew just by how she was acting she didn't like me, I asked why that thing hadn't busted through the window, she stomped her foot you know that stomp that little kids do when they don't get what they want as she told me that, it could only exist if it's target could see it and that if it had gotten to me, it would've made her a target after dealing with me and that wasn't something she wanted.

Just to clear up something, after that meat millipede attacked and I was thrown to the floor I tried contacting C.P.S, after all there was a random child in my house and I had no clue where her parents were, sure clearly she wasn't "normal" but I didn't know what else to do, but the phone rang for a disturbingly long time and there seemed to be a looping ring with audible cuts where it started to ring and where it stopped ringing over and over until it clicked like someone had hung up, I tried again and got what seemed like an automated voice message telling me that while the fog was around there was nothing that could be done and to please call after the fog cleared, when I asked where the kids parents were, she just crossed her arms and said that she didn't get home before the fog came and my house was closest.

My eyes felt heavy, my phone said it was around midnight, I had tried sleeping in the living room on a reclining arm chair with what happened the first day I didn't feel safe in my bedroom, after a point I felt like I needed to keep myself awake so I went to the bathroom to splash water in my face, turning on the light I faced toward the mirror, what I saw wasn't me, well it was but my reflection had a thick green scab on it's face, I touched my face to make sure it wasn't really there, there was nothing but the scars left from picking at my skin as a teen.

I suddenly felt I was being watched from behind but I was the only one in the mirror, with how my reflection was clearly different from my actual body I didn't trust my senses. I heard the girl in the gasmask tell me they can't act on their own if I'm awake or someone else is awake and can see them and they're no different then animals and with what I did to mine it will most likely never try something like what it did again. (you know what, I'm just realizing why I've haven't been attacked in my sleep again) I asked her, what would happened if they were killed, she told me flatly, that I won't have a reflection if I killed it.

The next morning the girl in the gasmask was wandering around my house with no real goal at least I think it was her moving around without a goal, I couldn't tell I was to out of it, to accurately tell. I decided I'd make actual breakfast food instead of cereal so I got out the stuff to make bacon, eggs, and pancakes, I made enough for me and the kid, speaking of the kid she'd been hovering around me while I was cooking, she asked if she could have some, I'm not going to deny food to someone let alone a kid so I told her I don't mind and that it was there till it was gone, toast was at my feet begging for some of my bacon, if his vet didn't tell me not to let him eat stuff like bacon I'd give him some.

I fell asleep after eating, when I woke up it was around two in the afternoon, I was unable to breath when I reached up and felt the long soft fur of my cat, gently removing Toast from my face I heard sounds of rain I looked outside to make sure it was actually rain with what had happened I wasn't going to ignore it, a thin film of water clung to my window, only drops of water racing one another down the warped glass, no monster, there was still a thick cloud of mist but from what I could tell it was only rain, remember how I said it was winter and my heating system didn't work well, pausing for a moment to take this in I felt like I was sweating and there this foul smell in the air, like when you vomit, reaching to the sleeve of my shirt I felt a hole that wasn't there when I passed out. (I liked the shirt and I'm still upset I had to get rid of it)

The fraying fabric where my shirt had been torn reminded me of moth damage, I had decided I'd find where the source of the vomit stench was coming from, the smell lead me to my laundry room, The girl in the gasmask was just staring at a green-ish purple puddle on the ground looking up I saw what looked to be a large cocoon or chrysalis with a gash cut in it, the kid was mumbling about how she was to late and it was missing, I almost ignored the fact there was most certainly a giant bug monster in my home now until I saw a hole in the window that looked like a person could crawl out of covered in purple goo and yellow fur.

When I asked the girl in the gasmask what she meant when she said she'd been late, the kid just looked at me like I had two heads and six arms and asked if I had any idea what was going on, when I told her I didn't know, she explained that most of the weird monsters followed the fog and with how the town for some reason was a place the fog would stay for days it became a hotspot for starting or ending life cycles and how unless someone chases the fog it has no effect of humans, I did ask what would happen if the fog were followed and she just told me to chase it if I was so interested.

The morning of the third day I saw the girl in the gasmask trying to make some eggs and I do mean trying she could see over the stovetop but it was like looking at someone in a swimming pool who can't swim but stands in a pool that's filled up to their neck yeah they technically CAN be there but just barely, she was looking at the eggs extremally upset like they insulted her personally, the kid's fist was wrapped tightly around a spatula to a point she was shaking like she about to cry, looking at the pan I could tell she accidentally dropped some shells into the pan, I asked the girl in the gasmask if she wanted some help, she nodded and asked me to help her make eggs.

By the time mid day rolled around I looked out the kitchen window to the bright blue sky where not a trace of the fog could be found other then a ground encased in a thick sheet of clear ice from where it melted the day before, when I pointed it out the girl in the gasmask asked if she could visit later, I told her it was fine with me so long at it was fine with her parents and light out, at that she stuffed the remaining eggs she had into her mouth, waved at me and left.

She comes around from time to time, I met her mother during a visit where she thanked me and gave me a blueberry lemon bunt cake for making sure her kid was safe (I got the recipe off her) my neighbors told me I could interact with the people in the gasmasks they warned me to never make deals with them that gave them more then what I wanted to give up, I asked the girl in the gasmask why that was, and she told me that her family can make a lot happen and people tried making unreasonable deals in the past and her mom wanted to stop people from doing that.

Well I'm going to sign off for now and sorry for the long post, it's getting late see you later bye!
