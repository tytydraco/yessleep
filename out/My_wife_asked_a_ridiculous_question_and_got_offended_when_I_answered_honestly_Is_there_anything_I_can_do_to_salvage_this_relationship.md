Now look, I’m not saying I was the bastard love child of George Clooney and Ryan Gosling or anything like that, but when you factored in my soft features and my career, there was no denying I was a catch. A *serious* catch.

The problem was status mean everything to Hannah. *Everything*.

I’d known since early on in our relationship she sought validation through her physical appearance. Personally, I blamed her father. Years ago, she told me he once refused to put up her school photos, and when she asked why, he smiled and said, “Don’t take it personally honey, it’s not your fault your acnes so bad.”

So you can see where her toxic obsession sprung from. And although her skin may have cleared up, those self-esteem issues most certainly did not.

It’s funny, in a grim sort of way. Because between her long, golden curls and those piercing green eyes, you could count the number of times Hannah needed to buy her own drinks on one hand. Don’t get me wrong, she wasn’t vapid or shallow or anything like that. I mean, hell, she had a master’s degree in chemical engineering for crying out loud.

It’s just her obsession with always being the centre of attention could get a little…*corrosive*.

Like this one time, at a gala dinner, the senior partners at my firm practically started a Battle Royale craning to get an intimate look at my Cesare Attolini suit and new Rolex—the one with the fancy black dial. If Hannah had arrived wearing a refuse sack and fuzzy pink slippers, it would have gone unnoticed.

For weeks afterwards, she insisted, *insisted* on attending every last cocktail party and charity ball, no matter how low-key, in the flashiest dress imaginable, her hair all made up, luscious and bouncy. With a glass of white wine in hand, she endlessly referred to herself as my trophy wife. The apple of my eye. According to her, I strolled around with a winning lottery ticket hanging off the end of my arm.

Little by little, these snide comments ate away at me. From the way she talked, you’d think she married the elephant man’s wealthy twin-brother. So, the next time she dropped a ‘*don’t you think you’re punching well above your weight with me honey?’* quip in front of polite company, I casually answered, “Actually, I reckon we’re about even looks wise.”

There was a long, awkward pause, interrupted only by one startled lady choking on her shrimp tartlet.

To Hannah’s credit, her temper didn’t boil over until we got home. However, rather than explode because of the humiliation, she just endlessly ranted about how I’d placed us on equal footing in terms of attractiveness.

Thirty minutes of shouting and screaming and stomping around the house later, with half the furniture sprawled across the floor or damaged or shattered, she said, “Fine, we’re even. You’re the window dressing AND the primary breadwinner in this relationship. Congratulations.”

With that, she climbed into bed, still so mad I could practically feel the heat fumes emanating from her body.

Did I know this was an unhealthy reaction? Absolutely. The sun was already creeping up, though. I just wanted to get some sleep. Hopefully, once she got a little shut-eye, my beautiful wife’s ugly temper would dissolve…

When I opened my eyes, my hands and feet were bound to the bedposts by metal cuffs. My dearly beloved sat on top of me, her hips straddling my chest. In her gloved right hand, there was a glass container filled with clear liquid.

She said, “I’ve been mulling over what you said, and you’re absolutely right: we *are* equal.” As she unscrewed the container's lid, a pungent aroma seeped out and singed my nostril hairs. “But that got me thinking, if I’m not the pretty one, what exactly do I bring to this marriage? Nothing, that’s what. So I’m gonna knock you down a few pegs. You know, to balance things out.”

She held the container directly above my head, slowly tipping it forward, inch by terrible inch. Along the side, there was a yellow and black illustration of a beaker spilling over a bare hand and melting the flesh—a warning symbol.

Oh fuck.

Now a stammering mess, I choked out a feeble, “Hannah…please…”

The last thing I remember was her big, bright smile. After that, there was only scalding liquid dousing my eyes, an invisible battalion of hungry ants sinking their mandibles deep into my skin, and the foul, repulsive stench of melted flesh…
