There really is no better way to say it. I came very close to summoning a demon, thanks to my hobby.

This disastrous hobby happened to be antique collecting. Yep. Who knew shopping for old coins and jewellery caskets could be so life-threatening? Well, for 10 plus years, it wasn’t.

Then, last month, I was just looking around yard sales and antique stores in my city, as I usually do when I get paid and have a day or two off work. 

There’s a few places near my house that I frequent, and I’m on a first-name basis with the staff in each of them. Sounds quite sad but, believe it or not, it’s a fulfilling hobby. 

I tend to look for metal work - coins, silverware, knives, stuff like that. Within a couple years of buying from sales and visiting local auctions, I managed to mostly fill my basement with shelves and tabletops with plenty of specimens. 

I didn’t really have a plan for what to do with them. I guessed I would start selling them on at some point when I ran out of room, but I still had some space in the basement, so I wasn’t stopping just yet.

One day, I stopped by one of my local antique stores and started with the usual small talk with the lady working the counter. 

I asked if she had anything new in recently. She did. First, she showed me over to a display case full of old pocket watches. She pointed out the newest one, which I gave a quick look, then a polite nod as she moved on to the next thing. Clockwork wasn’t really for me.

The lady took me to a different room, where I found plenty of new pieces. Some silver goblets, cutlery sets, bracelets, brooches, and some rusty arrowheads and bullet casings that some metal detectorist must have dug up in a field somewhere. 

On a normal day, I would have jumped at the opportunity to buy half of her stock and blow half of my wage for that month, but on that particular day I just wasn’t feeling any of it. 

When I told her, she was a little puzzled. She knew me, and she also knew that I loved stuff like this. She stood for a moment, thinking. Then, her eyes squinted and a smirk curled her mouth. “Follow me.” I did.

She led me behind her counter and into the backroom, where she kept tons of stuff she didn’t have the space to put out on display. Loads of interesting things caught my eye, and lots of metalware. But none of it kept my attention for long.

The lady reached high up on a shelf and pulled out a black box, a little larger than a book. My attention was immediately and intensely fixated on this object. She placed it on a countertop and pulled the lid off. 

In the black box, a knife was revealed. It was beautiful and ornate, with a gold handle and red gemstones worked into it. I had never seen anything so captivating. 

The lady said: “I kept this back here for you. I figured you would want to see it.” Until she spoke, I had forgotten that I was in an antique shop. None of the metal, silver, gold, copper or bronze pieces around me mattered anymore. All that mattered was this knife.

I bought it on the spot.

Looking back now, I was out of character. But, at that moment, I felt like I hit the jackpot. I rushed home in my car and flew downstairs to the basement, where I picked out a nice spot for the blade, on its own shelf. 

It wasn’t as expensive as I was expecting, since the store clerk marked the price down a bit when she saw how enthusiastic I was about it. I’m sure she was just trying to help me out. Or maybe she felt just as compelled to sell it to me as I was to buy it from her.

A couple days went by, and I didn't think much about the knife. By the third or fourth day after buying it, however, I felt the urge to buy again. Of course that was perfectly normal for me, especially after finding something so amazing.

I went to another store the next day and started looking around. I didn’t really go to this specific store very often. Maybe once every six or seven months. It was in a dingy area and was right next to a liquor store that tended to attract undesirables. But, for some reason, I felt like going there that day. 

The clerk had a very nice collection. A brilliant metal lampshade from the 70’s, a couple good looking Civil War revolvers, a weird little chess set made of titanium. All very cool, but nothing I felt like buying. 

I went up to the guy at the desk, who was arranging some old coins in his gloved hands. He saw me approach and put the coins down with a smile. Then, I asked the question. “Anything new in recently?” 

He thought for a second before responding. “Well most of the new stuff’s already out in the cases. Couple Victorian lockboxes, few medals from the Second World War over there.” 

I was about to thank him and walk away, when he stopped me with another string of words. 

“But… I do have this one thing. Came in yesterday. Just haven’t had a chance to price it yet. Come with me.” I followed him upstairs into a store room full of stacked boxes and scattered trinkets of all varieties. 

As soon as he fished a small, pale wooden box out of one pile, I felt the same fixation as I had felt with the knife. He opened it to reveal a dainty necklace with a shimmering silver chain, haphazardly strewn within the box. 

I wanted it. He was more than willing to haggle for a price. When it was settled, I walked out, got in my car and drove home to place the new pale box right beside the black box of the knife. 

A couple days later, the shelf collapsed. The two boxes fell to the concrete basement floor and splintered into pieces. When I eventually came down and found what had happened, the knife and necklace were out of their boxes and loose on the floor.

I had no spare boxes or containers on hand to put them in until I could buy new ones, so I simply placed the items on the table by the wall.

The plan was to buy new boxes for them and return them to the shelves, but I got distracted half way through ordering them and I never ended up getting any. The fact is, they ‘made’ me forget. They ‘wanted’ to be out in the open.

Instead of buying new boxes, I went online for more locations where I might find more things to buy. 

Things started getting a little strange in my house at that point. Doors slamming and picture frames falling from walls. I just chalked it up to a strong breeze and bad hanging nails. 

Over the next week and a half, I bought another two items: a gold ring and a mediaeval European coin. Both equally beautiful must-haves. 

After buying each one, I placed them all on the table in the basement, beside the necklace and knife. I took the new items out of their boxes, since they all looked so nice together in the open. 

I couldn’t help but think to myself how much nicer they would look with one more item to complete the collection. Except, I didn’t know what the last item would be, or what kind of mismatched ‘collection’ I was assembling. 

That night, as I lay in bed, I saw someone in my house. 

At first, I thought I saw a dark stain on the wall, long and slender. I thought to myself how I had never noticed it. Was it mold? Ripped wallpaper? Then I saw a human shadow cast against the wall, and I thought my jacket, hung on its hook, was catching the moonlight through the window.

Then my eyes focused and I saw the dark figure standing in my doorway. I lay in bed paralysed, unable to move as the dark thing looked at me with eyes it didn’t have, before receding from view without sound. 

When it was gone, I slowly found feeling in my limbs again, but I still didn’t move. I stayed there all night, watching the door, waiting for that shadowy person to return. 

It didn’t. I was so willing to disprove what I had seen with my own eyes, that I managed to convince myself that it was sleep paralysis. I mean, it basically was, except for the fact that I knew it wasn’t. I just wasn’t prepared to admit it. 

That same morning, I went online and looked for another antique store. I was presented with a list of places all within ten miles of my house. I picked one at random and drove there. Clearly, it wasn’t random. Clearly, I was ‘meant’ to go there.

When I arrived, the old man at the counter saw me and greeted me. He pointed out how tired I looked, with my dark, baggy eyes. I said I hadn’t slept. Done with the small talk, I asked if he had anything new in stock. 

“Yeah. I’ve got a couple things in the back.”

I followed him. When he opened a drawer and lifted a book out of it, I found myself short of breath, wanting nothing more than to buy the book. 

The man started talking about the brown, dusty book in his hands, and I was surprised he knew anything about it. The other four items I had bought had hardly any historical information known about them. I listened as he spoke.

“This book is apparently one of one. Never mass produced. Never even copied, apparently. This is the only one of its kind.”

Now I thought he was just trying to upsell it to me, or give himself an excuse to charge an extortionate price. He carried on.

“The text is in a dead language somewhere between Russian and Latin, so no one has managed to translate it.”

I was losing interest by this point, not taking my eyes off the book in his hands.

“It’s apparently haunted, you know?”

“Excuse me?” That’s the very last thing I expected to hear.

“Yeah. Some say it’s imbued with a demonic presence. I got it looked at by a spiritualist a couple years ago who agreed. They said that it’s a totem that belonged to a cult.”

His words were starting to blur together. My breathing was quickening and my blood raced the longer I stood looking at the book. The longer that book wasn’t in my hands. 

Any sane person would have walked out as soon as he mentioned the cult. I, on the other hand, asked for a price and bought the book. 

As I was walking out of the place, I stopped and turned back to the clerk.

“You mentioned a spiritualist before. Are they nearby?”

Sure enough, she was a few doors down. Here’s what she told me:

The book I had just bought was supposedly imbued with the soul of a demon. Well, one part of its soul. One fifth, to be specific.

She told me about the historical accounts of the cults that worshipped the demon, and how it was fated to rise again once all five totems were collected from the ends of the Earth and placed beside one another on an even ground.

Somehow, these items had found their way to my local area over the years, and were now infiltrating my mind, influencing me to assemble them and, well, summon a demon. 

I left that place light-headed. I drove home without thinking, barely breathing. When I pulled into my drive and turned off the engine, it was only then that I realised the gravity of what I had done. I had brought the book home.

There was an intense feeling compelling me to bring the items together, to see them all beside one another on the table. To complete the collection. I had to fight that urge. 

I had to fight even harder to toss the book into the street. My stomach sank like a stone when the book hit the ground and its pages splayed open, fluttering in the breeze. 

That night, I locked myself in my bedroom, dreading another visit from the shadowy man. Visit me, he did.

He stood over me in the night as I lay still, unable to move, no matter how much I desperately tried. The phantom lifted its misty arm and brought it down on my shoulder.

There was a sudden and intense pain, like a candle flame being held against my skin for longer than I could bear. I couldn’t scream, so I just cried as I looked up at the thing. Its arm shot back and I bolted to my feet with the worst boiling pain I’ve ever felt. 

The figure was gone as I stood. When I checked my arm and shoulder in the mirror, I saw a giant red gash, running with dark blood.

By the time the sun rose in the sky, I had crudely patched up my arm with the few bandages I had in my first aid kit. I sat for a long time on my couch, thinking about what to do. 

Eventually, I called 911. I honestly don’t know why. What could they possibly do? I guess I just needed some company while I suffered. 

I told them about the gnarly gash in my arm and they said they’d bring some paramedics, which I wasn’t at all opposed to. 

Then, there was a knock at the door.

I opened it to my neighbour. He held the book in his hands. 

“Hey! Sorry to bother you. Is this your’s? I think you might have dropped it on your way in.” I had no idea what to say. I wanted to say no, but something in the back of my head, something down in the basement, told me to take it from him.

“Yeah… thanks.”

“No problem, dude. Take care, now!”

As I started to close the door, I felt so alone. But I wasn’t. The phantom was back. It stood at the far end of the hall, watching me. It pointed to the basement door, between me and it.

My mind raced. Could I make it to the oven? Could I burn the book? As this thought crossed my mind, the spectre took a ‘step’ towards me, as if it knew what I was thinking, and warned me not to try it. 

It pointed at the basement door again, and it opened, and I had an overwhelming desire to go down and see my collection finally completed. 

I took the first step without knowing it had been taken, my fingers still gripping the front door, which creaked open as I let go to take my second step. I was losing my grip on myself.

Any ideas of rebelling were gone from my mind, as the rush of getting downstairs fuelled me. I descended the steps, and was joined once more by the shadow when I reached the bottom, watching me from a corner of the room. 

I ignored it, focusing my full attention on the table with the coin, ring, necklace and knife. The knife. I regained consciousness for a split second as a fleeting thought popped into my head and, in that same instant, I felt a searing pain in my back.

The phantom, now behind me, looming over me, clearly didn’t like the idea of me killing myself with that knife. The pain intensified, flowing up and down my back in what I could only imagine as a giant wound running the length of my spine. 

My choice was die or summon a demon. I had no way of knowing what would happen to the totems after I died. I could only hope that someone would separate or destroy them. It wouldn’t matter to me. At that moment, my mind was made. 

‘Now or never’, I thought, swiping the knife off the table and stabbing it into my arm and slashing downwards. The pain got so intense that I couldn’t stand up any longer, collapsing to my knees and then onto my side.

The beating of blood in my ears grew louder as the pain swelled, then began to subside as I lost more blood. 

Then, the table broke one of its legs, collapsing to the floor and casting the cursed antiques across the ground around me. The totems were together, but according to the spiritualist, needed to be resting together on the same even surface for the demon to rise. 

The gold hilt of the knife sticking out of my wrist was already touching the ground, but I couldn’t let the book do the same. I held it in my free hand, which was now being burned hot by the phantom, desperate to make me drop it to the floor. 

The shadow lost its humanoid form, becoming a cloud of vapour, filling the air with a black smoke that burned like fire across my entire body. Despair fell over me, chilling my blood as I began to picture my own death, lying in a pool of blood in a smoky basement, which was soon to be the birthplace of a demon. 

My eyes started to go, as the totems lay soaking in a slowly expanding pool of my own blood. Every fibre of my being told me to drop the book and ‘complete the collection’. Then, from off in the distance, I felt vibrations through the house. They got closer, and I realised they were voices. 

The phantom gave one last sting of unimaginable agony concentrated in my hand as the paramedics got me up onto a stretcher and marched me upstairs. I still clutched the book in my hand as they got me outside and, as soon as I felt the cool air on my face, I blacked out. 

I came to my senses in a hospital bed. I felt dreadful. I had all kinds of lines and drips feeding into me, and a heart monitor to my side to let me know I was somehow still alive. I glanced down and saw that my hand was wrapped tight with bandages. 

In that second, I realised the book was no longer in it, and I frantically looked around for it. A nurse saw me struggling and asked me what was wrong.

“Your book?”, she said. “It’s ok, sir. Your book is right there on your bed table.”

I turned and breathed a deep sigh of relief as I saw the book, lying on the table beside a vase of flowers. The pages of the brown book were dark red with my dried blood. 

“Sorry, sir”, the nurse continued. “I’m afraid we weren’t able to save it from being soaked.”

I laughed at what she said. I laughed and cried. 

When I finally got out of the hospital some days later, I held the book in my hands. Even then, I felt the demon’s grasp. I wanted to bring it home. My wounds stung with fresh pain. Distant pain, like thin tendrils trying to wrap me up and pull me back to the basement.

It was a dark evening when I got out and, from the other side of the hospital parking lot, I could see a couple of homeless guys huddled around a flaming bin, vying for warmth. I was cold too, I thought. I could use some warmth. 

I walked over, a task that felt like it took years, and when I eventually made it to the flaming bin, I threw the book in without a second thought. As it flew through the night air, I felt a dull, spiteful burning in my back, but once the book descended into the fire, the pain was gone.

I stayed, watching for long enough to see the pages crinkle into black nothingness. Only then, could I be sure it was done. 

I got home in the early hours. My door was closed, taped up by the police. I pulled it down and came in. As of writing this out, locked in my bedroom, there’s no signs of the phantom. Tomorrow I'm planning on getting those blood-soaked antiques in a garbage bag and driving them to the sea.

The police are probably going to have some questions for me, and I’m probably not going to have the answers they want to hear. 

I’m not sure what answers I’ll give them. I’m not quite sure of anything anymore. 

All except for one thing. I need a new hobby.
