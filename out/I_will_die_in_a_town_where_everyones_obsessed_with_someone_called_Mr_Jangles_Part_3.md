Carla is gone… 

… and soon, so am I.

They were right. It was Mr. Jangles. Just three days ago, he was nothing but a story for me, a myth people told each other when the lights went out. Or like I said - a lie. 

The next day, he became a real. 

And now, he’s going to be the thing that kills me.

I don’t know how much time I have left. If this message cuts off - if it just ends - then assume the worst. Assume I didn’t make it.

I’m not writing this from the safety of my rented room anymore. I’m somewhere else now. I think I know where… I can tell it by the smell. You could practically taste the wet soil, and I can feel the dirty water drip on my legs. There’s no reception here at the moment. None at all. So I don’t even know if this update will ever reach you. But if it does…

Never come to Maywood Mills. 

Not out of curiosity. Not out of pity. Not because you think you’re smarter than me. Stay. The hell. Away.

I'm going to type this out as fast as I can. I’m cold and running out of oxygen. My hands won’t stop shaking. This will be my final update. And I’ll tell you everything I can - everything I’ve figured out - while I still can.

…

That night, I stormed back to the bar.

The regulars were exactly where I’d left them - hunched over their drinks like barnacles clinging to a shipwreck. The jukebox wheezed out the same tired country song. Same dull eyes were staring into half-empty glasses. Nothing had changed for them...

But everything had changed for me.

The handyman - who I'd find out was called Mickey - and Horace were at their usual table. Still soaked from the rain. Mud caked their boots, and their coats dripped onto the floor like the storm had followed them inside. They hadn’t been back long. 

I didn’t waste time. I slammed Carla’s badge down on the table, hard enough to make the glasses jump.

“Where is she? I know she's been here.”

Mickey didn’t look up. He just stirred his whiskey like he hoped to find another one of his dirty lies swirling at the bottom.

“Speak godammit!” I yelled. He just downed his drink.

I opened my mouth to press him further - then I heard it. Chairs creaking. Boots shifting on that god-awful sticky wood. The bar had gone quiet. Everyone was watching me.

Mickey finally spoke, slow and gravelly, like I was interrupting something important.

“Yeah,” he said. “She came through. Dale saw her. She said her phone was dead. Needed a charger. There are no phones here, so we told her what we tell everyone - the next town's a few miles south. She drove off. That’s it.”

“That’s not it. I heard your friend here speaking to his wife the other day."

"Landline." Horace muttered with a cheeky grin.

“You’re withholding information from a federal officer!” I snapped.

Now he looked up at me, and smiled.

“And what are you gonna do about it…” he said. “Call backup?”

I froze. I didn’t know what to say. I guess authority only works when someone believes in it. The room seemed to lean in. 

“I want to talk to Dale,” I finally said. “Where is he?”

Behind me, Lucy’s voice cut in, cold and flat.

“Dale’s dead.”

I turned. Lucy was standing in the doorway, arms crossed, eyes grave.

“Mickey and Horace just found him. Down by the dam. A Western rattlesnake got to him, we think. He fell in and drowned.”

“What?” My voice cracked. “A rattlesnake?”

She didn’t answer. She didn’t have to. 

I could feel it now - that heaviness in the room - the thing I’d mistaken for hostility - it was grief. Every eye was on me now. The stranger. The outsider.

A low-life trucker in the corner eyed the mud on my boots.

“No, I’m not joking,” Lucy said, sharper now. “Come on.”

She led me down the back hallway. Past stacked chairs and crates of liquor. Even here, the smell of bleach stung my nostrils. She opened the cold room door. And there he was…

Dale.

Pale. Bloated. Draped across a table like a shot deer. Dirty water slid from his fingertips, dripping onto the tile below. I just stood there, listening to the drops. I couldn’t move. My breath got stuck somewhere high in my chest. The air felt thinner, like the room was closing in on me. 

“You’ve never seen a dead body before, Agent?” Lucy asked.

“Of course I have.” I said.

It was a lie. I’d seen bodies in photographs. In reports. In situations where you could look away. This was different... it made me sick.

“You’re soaked.” Lucy said, gently now. “You’re going to get sick.” She put a hand on my back. “Let’s get you to bed,” she added. “I’ll bring you some tea.”

There were only a few hours left until morning. I didn’t sleep through a single one of them. I lay there staring at the door, waiting for it to open. Waiting for him to come for me - just like he must’ve come for Carla... and Dale?

That was another thing that I couldn’t shake. The note on my door.

Did Dale write it? Did he want me to meet him there? Or was it Mickey? Horace? Was the note meant as... bait? A colder thought crept in. What if they’d mistaken Dale for me in the dark? What if that’s the reason he was dead?

The idea settled in my gut and refused to leave. Another death I could trace back to myself. I was up to three now. My mistakes were starting to stack up. I was practically a serial killer.  Yeah… try sleeping with that on your conscience.

The next morning, I was invited to a town meeting. 

Dale’s death had rattled everyone. The room buzzed with anger - whispers, accusations, fingers pointing at me, eyes scanning me up and down. More than a few people asked if Mr. Jangles had something to do with it. Apparently, he hadn’t “taken” anyone in a while. 

“Except Carla”, I thought. I didn’t say it out loud. I was afraid of what would happen if I did.

I knew I wasn’t welcome anymore. I could feel it in the air. I was the outsider who’d brought trouble with him. That stirred their fucked up idea of peace. Heads turned toward me. Angry eyes glared at me. Voices sharpened. If Holly hadn’t stepped in - put herself between me and the crowd - I think they would’ve run me out of town right there.

The strangest part was how rehearsed it all felt. The outrage. The fear. Even the blame. It was like they were all reading from the same script. Like the meeting wasn’t about Dale at all - but about turning me into the problem. About making sure I packed my bags and left.

And if it wasn’t, if it was all genuine - would people act this way toward an FBI agent? Or had they all decided I wasn’t one? Either way, one thing was clear…  The clock wasn’t ticking for me anymore - it was counting me out.

I had to act fast.

Outside, I ran into Cherry - the girl from the school. I asked her how she was doing. She shook her head and took a step back.

“I’m not allowed to talk to you anymore,” she said.

“Did your mother teach you not to talk to strangers?”

"She taught me not to talk to you..." she giggled. She glanced around, then whispered, “I have to keep Mr. Jangles’ secret. If I don’t… you’ll vanish too.” Then she ran.

I’ll vanish too… 

The words stuck with me. Was my gut right? Had I finally brushed up against some kind of truth? The story... The god-awful lie everyone here agreed to live inside. But if that was the case, the work felt impossible. I mean, how can you sniff out the truth in a place built on lies? I came here to find justice for Nadine, but can justice even exist in a place where lies have become the law? Where pretending not to see is the price of survival? Does the truth just rot - quietly, patiently - the same way Nadine did? In the same way all those people vanished. Out in the open. While everyone else looked straight past it.

For the first time, I didn't know what to do.

With my car still out of commission, Lucy offered to drive me to the nearest train station. Said they’d have someone else finish the repairs and tow the car to me once it was done. All she needed was my address. 

Let me tell you, something about giving it to her didn’t feel right. 

At the time, I told myself it was just paranoia. Another symptom of too little sleep and too many unknowns. But then something else awakened in me... something I said last night in the bar, tangled up with an unhealthy dose of stubbornness...

A need to make things right.

Now, lying here in the dark, I realize I should’ve taken her up on the offer.

But I didn’t. I was too close. Close enough to feel the truth breathing down my neck. So I decided to stay.

That decision came from a hunch - something I couldn’t shake. The phone call I’d made back at the police station. The one I’d almost written off as nothing. A landline? Come on. Really? I just needed to be sure…

So I broke in.

As the evening fell over Maywood Mills, I waited until Horace left. Then I said “fuck it” and put my elbow through the back window of the police station. The glass gave way with an ugly crack. I climbed inside and peeked back out into the street - the coast was clear. No shouts. No lights came on. I turned my attention to the station…

…and there it was. Lying by a charger next to a humming fan… Carla’s phone. 

The screen lit up when I touched it. Her lock screen stared back at me - Carla and her daughter, cheek to cheek at the Grand Canyon. My throat tightened. I felt nauseous. Swallowed it down. 

Every message I’d sent her was there. Every missed call. Dozens more from her fiancé. I checked her notes - I wasn’t sure how long she’d been here before Mr.Jangles took her, but maybe she’d been here long enough to see something I hadn’t. She was better at this than me... always had been.

She'd made a note 4 days ago. The day before I arrived.

*Havers, 1998.* But before I could make sense of it, I heard something outside.

Keys.

I froze and slowly turned toward the door. Then I heard the unmistakable sound of metal sliding into metal. 

His keys entered the lock.

I didn’t think. Didn’t hesitate. I shoved the phone into my pocket and bolted for the broken window. Glass bit into my palms as I hauled myself back out. The last thing I heard was the door creaking open behind me. I didn’t look back. I ran as fast as I could to the elementary school, and with a little courage left in the tank... 

I busted my second window of the night.

Lucy had told me most of the locals still clinging to Maywood Mills had gone to school with Nadine - that they’d all been in the same class. But I’d never heard of this boy, Lyle. Not once.

The school itself was… unsettling. Not because it was falling apart (though it was), but because of what filled it. Crayon drawings of Mr. Jangles lined the halls. Taped to the walls. Hanging on classroom doors. Kids holding his hand. Him dancing in the woods. Him picking flowers by the creek.

It almost felt like… curriculum. Suddenly, the idea of a cult didn’t seem far-fetched. It felt practical. Organized. Something taught young enough that no one thought to question it. Maybe this was it...

I made my way to the teacher’s lounge - though calling it a lounge was generous. It looked more like a college dorm kitchen that had been abandoned mid-semester. Burnt coffee hung in the air. Unwashed dishes in the sink. One sad, stained microwave in the corner.

In the back, I found a tall metal filing cabinet. And there they were.

Thick, dust-covered yearbooks. The kind schools used before everything became digital. Nadine’s murder happened late summer, which meant she’d still be listed in the 1998 edition. 

However, it wasn’t there. It was gone. 

The closest book I could find was from 2000. I flipped through page after page. The photos were sun-faded and grainy, and most of the kids looked like they had a gun to their heads. Still, a pattern started to form.

Lucy. Mickey. Horace. They were all there. All old classmates to Nadine. But Dale? He wasn’t listed anywhere. Instead, there was a boy who looked just like him.

Lyle Havers.

The pieces clicked together with a dull, sinking weight.

Dale was Lyle. But if that was the case, then why change his name? I worked myself backward through the books. Lyle wasn’t in ‘97 or ‘96 - but Nadine was. That meant he’d moved to town sometime between ‘98 and ‘99. Probably 98 since Carla had flagged him as a person of interest. 

Was there a story here? New kid arrives. Falls for the girl next door. Gets rejected. Heart breaks. Cue violent end. Maybe he’d been a suspect back then. I couldn’t remember his name from the case files - but given how sloppy they were, that didn’t mean much.

Still, the question lingered. Why change his name?

Because the evidence probably didn’t stick, however, suspicion does. I’d seen it before. Changing your name doesn’t erase the past - but it does bury it.

Then something else surfaced. A memory from the missing files Horace had given to me. One of the elderly couples. They were named the Havers. Ruth and Earl Havers. They vanished in 2003. I snapped a couple of photos of the pages, hands shaking slightly. Couldn’t tell if it was cold or something closer to excitement. 

That’s when I heard it.

…a faint clatter of metal, echoing down the hallway.

I froze. Didn’t move. Didn’t breathe. Just listened. How the hell did he know I was here?!

I slipped out of the lounge. If I remember correctly, the exit was on the other side of the hallway - the one lined with kids' drawings… because that’s just what I needed. More of him.

I moved through the corridor as quietly as I could. Then I felt it again - that strange pressure in the air, like the building itself was swallowing sound. I glanced out a window. Silent lightning bloomed over the woods. No crack. No wind. I turned back toward the hallway - 

\- and almost screamed.

Down the far end of the corridor - illuminated only by moonlight - stood a figure. Tall. Perfectly still.

Mr. Jangles.

Lightning flared again, carving his silhouette out of the dark. The top hat. The long coat. The wide, awful smile. With the next thunderboom, he started to dance. It wasn’t ballet, like last night. This dance felt wrong. It was off-beat. Childish. Unpredictable. Like someone mocking the very idea of what makes dancing beautiful.

But I was spellbound...

My blood turned to ice. Every scrap of anxiety I’d ever carried dumped into my veins at once. He was coming closer. I imagined this was what small fish felt like when they finally realized the beautiful light belonged to a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth.

His long, gaunt hand reached out for me.

Lightning cracked outside again, this time I heard it, and the spell broke. I ran. Full sprint. Blind through the dark. My boots hammered against the old linoleum, loud as gunshots. I didn’t know where I was going - just away. Anywhere else.

I rounded a corner too fast, slipped, and fell on my broken arm. The snap echoed off the walls. I bit down hard, choking back a scream. Fumbled for my painkillers. Swallowed more than I should’ve, dry. When the pain dulled enough for me to function, I forced my eyes open.

I saw lockers. Tall, metal lockers lined the wall. I didn’t think. I yanked one open, shoved myself inside, and pulled the door shut. The metal clicked softly.

Then, silence fell. All I could hear was my own breathing. Through the narrow slats, I watched the hallway. My heartbeat thundered in my ears.

Then a horrible sound filled the silence - keys scraping against metal. He was dragging his keys against the lockers. One by one. I could hear him getting closer. I did my best not to move and held my breath. My sweat ran cold down my spine. My arm ached with pressure.

Then, he paused. Just a few feet away. Just like that. No sound. No final scare. And then... he was gone.

I don’t know what came over me. I should’ve stayed hidden. Slept in there until morning. But how do you explain that to a kid? A grown stranger passed out inside a school locker? No, I had enough trouble as it was. I ran back out. Out of the school, into the night, and I didn’t stop until I couldn’t see the building anymore.

As I was getting close to the bar, I fished Holly’s number out of my pocket and called her. As soon as she answered, I blurted out some adrenaline-fueled theory. I can’t remember exactly, but I think I said something about Dale, or Lyle, having killed Nadine that summer. How the kids must’ve covered for him, and as they got older, they got rid of anyone who sniffed out the truth. Even his parents. Then they blamed it all on Mr. Jangles… and created a lie that now everyone has accepted.

It didn’t really make sense, but I was desperate for answers. This was all I got. But why would the entire community get together to protect one disturbed kid? Wouldn’t you just want to get rid of him?

I couldn’t think about it anymore as a strong smell hit me…

Burning wood.

I looked up and saw thick black smoke curling up into the sky, swallowing the treetops. The bar was on fire.

By the time I got close enough to see through the smoke, it was already too late. Flames licked the walls and gutted the windows to my room. Glass exploded onto the street. The old neon sign took its last breath and flickered to death. I ducked behind a dumpster, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. And that’s when I saw Lucy - sobbing. On her knees in the gravel, her arms streaked with soot.

People from the town had gathered around. They didn’t look scared - they looked furious. Their faces twisted with grief and firelight. And they were shouting… shouting my name.

They were hunting me.

I slowly backed away and ran down the street. There was only one place left to go.

Holly's house.

She took me in without a word. I must’ve looked worse than I felt - soaked to the bone, shaking. Half from the cold. Half from fucking everything else I'd been through. She handed me a mug of hot coffee and told me to sit tight. Said she was going to take a quick shower. That I could rest in the basement if I wanted. Lock the door, if it made me feel safer.

I nodded.

Finally, I had time to think. What was next? Everything I owned was gone in the fire.  All files, all my equipment... all my personal belongings. I was just about to head downstairs when I remembered - I had something - Nadine’s diary. It was tucked into the inner pocket of my jacket. I pulled it out. It was damp around the edges, but intact. It was all I had left of her.

I sat down and flipped through it. The first pages were what you’d expect from a teenage girl. Crushes. Classes. Doodles. Fights with her mom. Song lyrics. But then I hit something else.

Pages and pages written between April and August ‘98. At first, it looked like a creative writing exercise. A story she made up for school. Something about a man in a tall hat who lives in the woods.

Mr. Jangles.

At first, he was harmless. A story Nadine made up for a class exercise. A monster that only existed on paper. But as the entries went on, her tone changed. She wrote about how the other kids became fascinated with him. Obsessed. Lucy especially. And another girl - Anna Havers.

Anna Havers... Lyle had a sister?

I didn’t recognize the name. I couldn't remember her from the school photo.

Nadine explained that Lucy and Anna liked the idea of Mr. Jangles. So they started adding details. Drawing him. Talking about him like he was real. Like they could hear him. Then it stopped being a game.

In the middle of summer, Nadine wrote that Lucy and Anna had convinced the others to hold small rituals. Meeting at the creek. Praying. Leaving offerings. Talking to him at night. Nadine wanted it to stop. She said that she was scared. That she tried to tell the others that Mr. Jangles had left town. But they didn’t believe her. And then I found the last entry she ever wrote:

*Lucy and Anna asked me to come with them tonight. My mom has told me not to hang out with Anna... she told me she's being homeschooled because she's... special.*

*Anna says he wants to see me. That I’m the only one who can do this right. Because I know him and because he listens to me.*

*The other children have decided to sneak out tonight too. Everyone will be there. They’ve already decided on the forest. The place by the creek.* 

*I tried to tell them he isn’t real. That he never was. They accused me of lying. That I was just scared to admit the truth.*

*Now they want to see him. He'll only come if I'm there. They say it’s not dangerous. That nothing bad will happen.*

*I don’t want to go. But I’m afraid of what will happen if I don’t.*

*If something happens to me, I want it to be known -* 

*I never believed in him.*

*They did.*

Who was Anna Havers? Who came to Maywood Mills later… and didn’t keep her name? It dawned on me. I didn’t want the answer. I tried to push it away. But it was already there, waiting.

Holly.

That was the last clear thought I had before the sharp pain exploded at the back of my head… and everything went black.



I woke up here.

At first, I could hear them. Voices, somewhere above me. Muffled. Angry. Arguing, maybe. Then… the dirt. Or... not dirt. It must've been mud. Thick and wet and heavy. It slid over my casket like wet cement. I screamed. Begging for them to stop.

And then… I heard it. The dam. Cracking like a gunshot in the distance. And then a sound like the sky tearing open. Rushing water. Flooding everything. Washing over my grave. I can only assume that’s what I heard when I arrived three days ago. That they buried Carla...

Her body was probably just a few feet away. Dale’s too… He left me the note because he was ready to talk. To confess. Ready to tear open the lie that had been holding this town together for decades.

They couldn’t let that happen.

I don’t know how deep down I am. I can’t move. The walls are tight and pressing in on all sides. My ribs ache every time I try to breathe. 

Please. Don’t get any ideas… don’t come look for me. They’ll find you.

He’ll find you.

I’m writing this on my phone - which they forgot to take from me for some reason. So, if they somehow remember, I assume they’ll come back for it. But I’ll be long gone by then. So, if you hear an update from me again… please now, that it won’t be from me.

They say small towns hold onto their stories longer than they should.

And Mr. Jangles?

His story will be safe with me. 

Forever.
