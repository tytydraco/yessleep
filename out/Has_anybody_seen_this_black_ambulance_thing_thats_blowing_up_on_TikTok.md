I thought the videos were staged. I mean, a black ambulance (that was harder to capture on camera than Bigfoot) driving around my hometown abducting teens in the dead of night? Yeah right. If that was true, there’d been missing persons reports. Police investigations. Grieving parents.

In the most watched video, a teenage boy wearing a red hoodie kicked a ball around an empty construction site while his friends recorded from inside a half-finished office block.

“Holy shit there, look there,” the guy holding the phone said.

The footage went all ‘shaky-cam’ as the kid’s friends helped drag him up some scaffolding, then everybody freaked out about something happening off-screen. Really the video was boring and unmemorable, but that didn’t stop the wild speculation in the comments. Who was behind this great mystery? Aliens? Vampires? Politicians operating illegal underground organ farms?

Nobody knew what happened if you got caught—only that you disappeared forever. *How* anybody knew this was unclear.

I was in the final year of a journalism degree, and starving on a diet of unpaid internships that paid me in a ‘wealth of experience’. Anytime I asked about actual work, the staff threw quotes about entitlement in my face. I was reminded, again and again, how us kids these days are allergic to putting in the hard work.

But then the editor of my city’s largest news site came to give my class a guest lecture. This was a lady who reported from the front lines of war-zones before catching a knee full of shrapnel. Now she’d taken a desk job and was helping expose a children’s hospital that cremated several bodies before the parents got their chance to say goodbye.

She said they were hungry for “writers who could connect with Gen Z” and encouraged us to submit samples. Anything (within reason) that’d help them engage with a younger market. And what were all the kids talking about?

That’s right: the black ambulances. I figured the subject would make a tasty piece about how easily you can spread bullshit online.

I reached out to the group behind most of the vids. Told them I knew they were faking and that, if they let me tag along, I’d write an article about them. Hell, I’d even make them sound all heroic. So, on a cold night, me and two wannabe influencers hung out on a dark path that wrapped beneath a concrete bridge.

After five minutes listening to them brag about their follower counts, I was already planning a different article—about how the lengths people go to for fame.

The younger guy pointed around the bend and said, “Wait. What’s that?”

“Is Dan here already?” the other one said. “But we haven’t give him the signal yet.”

Across the river, the cameraman was still setting up his equipment.

The guys threw their backs against the slimy underside of the bridge. I peeked out but couldn’t see a thing except the quiet road. Clearly this was them trying to pull one over on me…

Just then, footsteps splashed through a pool of rainwater, somewhere close. The two guys exchanged a look and then scrambled in opposite directions.

The truth is I wasn’t convinced by their performance, but I also didn’t wanna get jumped for my phone. There was a stairwell on the far side of the bridge. I hurried up the slippery steps, dirty leaves crunching beneath my boots, and got headed off at the top by two figures dressed all in black, their faces hidden beneath motorcycle helmets.

I paused, chuckling, and said, “Okay guys, very fun—”

Before I could finish, an aerosol can triggered inches from my face, then everything cut to black.

I woke up in a warehouse, my brain all mushy. The roof was 50 ft high, and I was surrounded by strange medical equipment and curtains on sliding rails. I tried to move, but my wrists and ankles were strapped to a wheelchair. I didn’t realize I’d been gagged until my calls for help came out all muffled.

Behind me, a curtain slid back. Then a masked doctor wheeled an old, seriously ill man in front of me. He looked so frail his bones stood out beneath the fluorescent lights, and his spine curved forward at such an extreme angle that it exposed a tangle of grey chest-hair beneath his blue hospital gown. His eyes locked onto me from within their dark hollows.

I yelled for the doctor’s attention. Ignoring me, the bastard plugged tubes into the old man. Some hooked directly into the medical equipment, but others the doctor jabbed into my arms. Only then did it hit me that I was also in a medical gown.

Were the theories true? Was I about to become an unwilling organ donor?

I screamed and thrashed against the restraints, unable to break free. As the old man laughed, his stale denture breath blasted me in the face.

The doctor stood back and flicked a switch on an odd device, then a shudder ripped through my entire body. There were two clear, plastic bags—one on my left, which slowly filled with a black, oozing substance, and one on my right, which swelled with transparent fluid.

With his work complete, the doctor disappeared behind the curtain. I studied my surroundings. The only sounds were the steady hum of the medical equipment. I rocked from side-to-side, then back and forth, trying to twist my arms free.

“Calm down snowflake,” the old man said with an impatient sigh. “You’re not going anywhere. And this is gonna take a while.”

I screamed into the gag.

“Are you gonna do that the ENTIRE time?”

I caught the condescension in his voice, but was too busy freaking out to care.

“Look, if I take that gag out will you simmer down?”

I couldn’t see any other obvious way out of that mess. I nodded frantically.

After he slipped the gag beneath my chin, I said, “What the hell is going on?”

“Just let the treatment do its work.”

“Treatment? What treatment?”

 “The revitalize treatment.” He announced each word carefully like an annoyed schoolteacher.

“The…what?”

“We’re doing a transfusion,” he said, sighing impatiently. “I’m old, I’m sick, and I need a piece of your youth. Just a teensy piece. No need to cry about it.”

“My what?”

“*YOUR YOUTH*. I swear, kid’s these days,” he said, rolling his neck in circles. “Those phones have fried your brains. The treatments safe as houses and it hurts about as much as a bee sting, so quit being such a fairy and take it like a man.”

Several machines beeped. I heard some kind of pump kick to life, then the liquid in the two bags bubbled away.

The room and everything in it became white and fuzzy, as if filling with a sudden fog. “My eyes,” I cried. “Whats happening to my eyes?”

“They’re probably ruined ‘cause you play video games all day.”

As the machines beeped and whirred, the veins in my hands became red and swollen, and the vertebrate in my back cracked, one after the other. My shoulders hunched forward, against my will, and next time I thrashed against the restraints an awful bolt of pain ran down my spine.

“Please. It hurts. Whatever you’re doing, please stop.”

The old man leaned back with satisfaction. “I swear, your generation aren’t happy unless you’ve got something to belly-ache about.”

It was like my joints caught fire. Deep wrinkles webbed through my hands, running up my arms, and the skin peeled away in giant flakes. A sticky, yellow fluid seeped out of my mouth, ran down my chin and onto my lap. I cried for help again and was surprised by how much gravel there was in my throat.

In a whiney voice, the old man said, “My back, my eyes. I suppose you’re gonna start crying about house prices too?”

His voice sounded so much softer now. I blinked until my vision stabilized and squinted hard. The bones in his face and neck had become less defined. His liver spots faded, too, and those dark bags beneath his eyes? Gone. The shapeshifting man flexed his biceps and rotated both feet, as if using them for the first time.

Meanwhile, I felt my insides shrivel up. If you’d slit my belly, the organs would’ve been grey and unhealthy.

When the machines beeped and fell quiet, the doctor returned to unplug the rejuvenated man, who straightened his spine and drew a deep, satisfied inhale.

“You fucking prick,” I rasped in an awful, liquid wheeze. “What the fuck have you done to me?”

“See that’s the problem with your generation,” he sneered. “Always blaming somebody else for your problems.”

With that, the masked doctor faced me, shook up a cannister and then triggered it in my face.

I woke up in a tiny bedroom, all neutral colours, very little decoration. I tried sitting up, praying the experience had all been a nightmare, but that turned out to be a difficult task. Rolling my feeble body off the mattress took five minutes. I hobbled toward a mirror on the far wall where a ghoul with thin, grey hair and sunken features stared back at me.

I knocked on the door, waited, knocked again, took a breather. Finally, two nurses appeared. I told them I needed help—that I was a 21-year-old man who’d been a guinea pig in some sick experiment. They listened with patronizing sweetness, then took me by the hand and dragged me back to bed where they fed me pills that made me drift off to sleep.

And since then, they haven’t let me leave. It’s like I’m in a waiting room, ready to die.

Wherever I am, I’ve got limited contact with the outside world. It’s taken days to get this story jotted down.

Either the staff here think I’m senile or they’re part of the conspiracy. So far, it’s impossible to tell.

But if anybody can help blow the lid on this black ambulance thing, please message me.

Because I need to undo whatever those bastards did to me before it’s too [late](https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/)…
