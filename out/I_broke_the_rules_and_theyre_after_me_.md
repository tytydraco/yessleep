I'm pretty sure the Mods have it out for me. And not in a paranoid kind of way. Genuinely, I think they have it out for me. 

 

I'm being followed. Really. I'm not lying. Everywhere I go I see these people. All of them wearing bright orange jumpers. Each of them with a name tag that just reads 'M O D'. 

 

The Mods are watching me. 

 

Yesterday I was walking my dog Goose. The usual route. The familiar time of day. It was around the third block I realized I was being followed by a strange man in a bright orange jumper. Immediately, this man made me feel uneasy. I picked up my pace. He picked up his pace. My sneakers slapped against the wet sidewalk as I sped forward. The orange jumper enhances his speed. I start to run. Goose is having the time of his life running down the next six blocks at top speed alongside me. I'm running faster than ever before. I look over my shoulder mid stride and see that this orange jumper wearing beast is right behind me. He's got no expression on his face. His eyes are locked on me. He's not even sweating at the top speed I'm fighting for.  

 

Goose is smiling with joy. His bicoloured ears flapping behind him as if he were a superdog.

 

I'm freaking out. I'm running out of steam. I slow down. The burning in my legs from such a sprint has me dry heaving. I stumble - graciously - into a half falling forward, half Bambi on ice, jog. Then, forfeit into a speed walk when this orange man runs right past me into oncoming traffic. 

 

Bam! He's hit by a car. Medics say he dies instantly. His name? Mod. His jumpsuit - orange.

 

Goose - He's slightly traumatized.

 

Me? Ah, I'll unpack this in therapy a few years from now. For now, in the box of scary subconscious stuff it goes.

 

The police takes Goose's and my statements before letting us leave. Not even three blocks later I see another one. This time a female wearing a bright orange jumper. She is holding the biggest pair of binoculars I've ever seen. Those lenses stalk me. Her blank gaze peering at me through the lenses. Analyzing my every move. Each step I take scrutinized. I gulp heavily and guide Goose in the opposite direction. 

 

 

The woman races towards us at Bolt speed. Goose barks loudly, protecting me from this Mod assault. The bark doesn't phase her. She's almost at us. I prepare to scream and clutch my pepper spray. She is a few feet away. Then the craziest thing happens, she falls into a manhole and dies on impact! 

 

What in the hell?! Two orange wearing Mods in the same day, perishing while full speed railroading in my direction. The same police officers take my statement and give me an apologetic “tough day eh buddy” before sending me on my way again. 

 

Goose and I make it home in a haze of grief. Naïve me, believes that I'm safe now from the Mods. I decide that I'll take the long way to work from on. A new route. *Maybe a change of routine will be good* I think to myself.

 

 WRONG. 5 orange jumpers were mixed among the crowd the next morning. I just finish dropping Goose off at daycare and bam there they were. All their eyes on me. Their gaze following my every move. They were closing in on me. All six of them. I feel like I might faint.  

 

No, I feel like I might die. The way my heart is pounding in my chest. I can't die. No not here. The Mods won't allow it. I feel their sweaty hands hold me. I don't struggle. There's no point. Once the Mods had you. Once they decided you broke the rules. You were done for. 

 

Goose barks at me from the window of the daycare. The Mods yank me away from him leaving his puppy dog eyes full. I lock eyes with him for as long as I can. Rain starts to fall heavily around me as I mouth ‘goodbye’ to Goose. The Mods pull me out of his eyeline. My heart bursts. Metaphorically, of course – they won’t let me die.

 

The Mods drag me to the edge of town and throw me out. I'm tossed out of their digital dimension. I broke their rules. I didn’t intend to. It was an honest mistake. I cease to exist in the last dimension. Not even a memory of me exists. I am hidden from the eyes of all those that once interacted with me. The Mods took me from my best friend Goose. Those orange jumper wearing dictators took it too far. When they tossed me out they erased all of me. It's like I never existed to Goose. He will be alone in the day care, and no one will know where he came from. He will be confused, alone, and afraid. My heart breaks for him.

 

This new dimension appears to be less populated. It also seems to have fewer rules than the last dimension. The Mods are nicer here. They wear blue jumpers. I was assigned a cat here. Her name is Arlo - I bet Goose and her would have been great friends. I really miss Goose. I wonder if I appeal to the great Mods in orange jumpers, they may consider letting me upload back to their dimension. I get a lot more sleep in the new dimension, but I would happily suffer through no sleep if it meant having Goose back. If it meant Goose would remember me. Until then I cease to exist there - ruled over now by the Mods in blue jumpers.
