"I'm trying to find out who you are, Michael," I sighed. "And I would never call anyone any of those things. A person is more than just the problems they face–"  
  
"Problems?! You don't know sh\*t about problems! I may not be like those sad folks out there–" he gestured to the other homeless waiting in the hallway of the center "–but I've got a big effing problem!"  
  
"That's why I'm here, Michael. Why don't you talk to me about what's troubling you?”  
  
"Because I want to sleep under the stars tonight, not get dragged off to some padded cell in a straightjacket."  
  
I leaned forward and pushed up my glasses, stroking my chin like I just couldn't find the right thing to say. It was a disarming gesture that I found helped people to open up to me. As a social worker specializing in homelessness, I needed every helpful strategy that I could get. Most of the people I worked with viewed me at best as a waste of their time, and at worst, as a threat.  
  
"The more I understand, the more I'll be able to help. That's all I want, Michael. To help you. Will you let me do that?"  
  
The twenty-something blonde across the desk from me rolled his eyes, rubbed-red and dark-pitted from lack of sleep. Apart from that, however, Michael wasn't a typical case. He was well-dressed and clean-shaven, even if his suit had seen better days and his eyes bore the rubbed-red, dark-pitted signs of insomnia.  
  
"Look, if I talk about this, there might be consequences. Horrible consequences. It might even bring her into your life... and I don't want to be responsible for that. I've got enough stuff to deal with already..." Michael grabbed the arms of his chair and pushed himself to his feet. If he walked out that door, I was sure I'd never get another chance to get him the help he needed.  
  
"Michael, it says in your file that you never sleep in the same place twice. Why is that?" Michael paused, his worn-out pack halfway up his back. Through its bulging seams, I could see his tent, sleeping bag, and clothing all packed neatly away inside. "It's because of her, isn't it?" Michael sat back down.  
  
"You have to promise me that I won't get locked up anywhere," the young man muttered gruffly. "And that if I ever get picked up by the cops or whatever, you'll do your best to spring me the very next night. I need you to promise me all that–and mean it. Look, I know it's a tall order, and it's okay to say 'no.' I'll just walk out that door, you'll fill out your little form, and we can both pretend that this conversation never happened…"  
  
"Michael," I grabbed the young man's hand solemnly. "I promise that I'll do everything in my power to meet your conditions, should they ever arise."  
  
Michael looked around, as though to reassure himself that no one else was listening. The troubled expression on his face was one I recognized: he was struggling to convince himself to open his inner world to a stranger. I let him sit in silence for a while, knowing full well that at this point, what happened next was up to Michael.
