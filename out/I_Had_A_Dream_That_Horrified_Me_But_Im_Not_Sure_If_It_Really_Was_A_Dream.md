 I just want to get this out of the way. It's been two years, since my experience which led to the issue I'm in now. Before I share what happened, allow me to introduce myself.

My name is Luke Sandwell. I'm 23 years old, and I'm just a simple college student from Pennsylvania, in the city of Pittsburgh. Since I'm not some random, important figure who would seem believable, or someone wearing a lab coat and holding a PhD, I don't expect anyone to believe me on what I'm about to tell you. Some of you might even find this amusing, or perhaps terrifying, probably because you're having a similar issue.

You see, it all started back when I finished my usual day at college. I stayed in a dormitory until it was summer. That's when I decided to stay with my parents until college started, then I would head back to the dorms. When I was at my parents' house, nothing particularly scary happened. It was a simple day, and we even had a relaxing barbecue with family and neighbors. It was a pleasant time too, and during nights, I just sleep in my old bedroom. I planned to stay for at least two months at home, and once that's done, I'm heading back to college to prepare for the next semester.

However, after over a month, this is where my normal day of living, came to an end. In fact, it was the moment where I had one of the worst experiences of my life. Why? Because in one particular night, I had a horrifying experience, something I don't want any of you to have. Trust me, you wouldn't want to experience this. If you did, you probably get an idea of what I went through. Sometimes I think I'm going insane now, and I'm not sure how long until I eventually end up in a mental asylum.

At that night, I got ready for bed for the next day. My dreams I had since the past nights, were normal and simply vague. In certain occasions, I had dreams where I became 'lucid' and realized everything. But strangely and recently, my dreams got weirder and weirder. It constantly involved a very strange entity of some kind, one I didn't understand or know about, nor recall its appearance, until this night. This was a night I wish I could forget, but the memory of it still haunts me even to this day.

As usual, I fell asleep, wondering if I'll ever see that entity again.

I didn't recall much else that happened, other than supposedly "waking up" in some unknown place. I was hoping that the lights in my bedroom and throughout the house, were out, because it was dark, darker than I expected. It looked 'pitch black' and I thought I was still in my room. However, I noticed something was off. I immediately recalled the shape of my room, and remembered the distance from my bedroom to the light switch. I walked towards it, and I was in complete shock. I assumed I would hit a wall at least, but I kept on walking. It's as if there was no wall there, or I walked through it.

"Mom? Dad?" I called to them, but there was no response.

"Mom!? Dad!?" I yelled. Still, no reply.

"Mom!? Dad!? Can you help me!? I can't see anything! Please!!" I yelled to them. I received no reply from them, other than a chilling voice I didn't recognize.

"Who is Mom and Dad?" whatever it was asked me.

Terror shot through me, not only because of how terrifying that voice sounded, but I also assumed I was asleep for too long, I must've been abducted by someone, because I didn't recognize the voice. I tried to look around, but wherever I was, it was pitch-black. Nothing but darkness all around me. I've been hoping I was still dreaming.

"Who is Mom and Dad!?" again asked someone or something, and it sounded closer. I was frightened, but I was at least relieved someone was keeping me company at the time. I didn't like the thought of being all alone in a place I don't know, so I decided to respond to who this "person" may be, given the impression he was respectful.

"Mom and Dad are my parents! What happened to them!?" I asked the voice.

"Your parents aren't here." it responded to me, and I felt chills down my spine.

I immediately assumed I was abducted by someone, or something. My eyes adjusted to the strange environment, and my vision adapted, which allowed me to see things clearly. However, I wished that my vision didn't clear and adjust. Not only that, but recalling the sound of this voice, it sounded like it had what I could only describe as a deep, guttural, masculine tone. Apparently, this wasn't a human I was speaking to, this I didn't realize until after things became clear to me.

When I was able to get a good look at everything, I was able to see strange lights all around. It looked as if I was in some sort of city. I thought that my old hometown had a blackout, and I must have sleep walked outside. However, the streetlights, or what looked like streetlights, were a completely different color. Instead of the usual, bright, yellowish-white color that most lights have, these lights had green, blue, and purple colors, and they all looked dark and vague. When I looked around, there were also a few tall "structures" as I could describe them, which I assumed to be buildings, next to a row of what I assumed to be houses.

The strangest thing was, I could not see the features of the buildings, houses, and poles of the street lights. They were all pitch-black in color, along with everything else other than the lights. This "city" I was in, it was completely devoid of colors save for the strange lights, other than that pitch-black. The entire space itself was the same thing. It was so dark, and terrifying. I don't know how I ended up in that place. I was back home at my parents, visiting for a month's time. So how the fuck did I get in this terrifying reality? Was this Hell? The Void? So many questions flooded my mind, trying to make sense of everything. To be honest, I would much rather be in a void, all alone. To experience something like this, I would never wish even on my worst enemy.

Thinking about the voice that spoke to me, I began to talk to it.

"What is this place?" I asked it, hoping to get a response.

"You're in our world." the voice said to me, and my heart began pounding rapidly. It seems I ended up in a world I didn't know, truly existed. I noticed one of the supposed street lights nearby, and decided to walk to it to get a better look. I went under it, wondering what would happen to me. But nothing as I expected happened to me, which made me relieved, so standing under that street light was safe for me. After that, I decided to ask the voice one more question.

"Where are you?"

Soon as I did, I got my response, one that I'll regret as my answer.

"I'm right behind you."

Soon as the voice said that, I felt an eerie 'presence' just two feet away from me. That's when I slowly looked toward the direction of that presence. When I did, I felt cold a terror run through me. I saw an entity, standing behind me. This 'thing' had a form, but no discernable features could be seen, and the entity was just as 'pitch-black' as everything else, save for the street light that allowed me to see this. I wouldn't have been able to notice it standing behind me if the street light wasn't here.

Still, I was terrified. I slowly backed away, thinking it would try to harm me. Then, it started asking me questions.

"Where did you come from?"

"From Pittsburgh." I told it.

"Never heard of that place. Is it a new world?" it asked me.

Catching onto this thing's voice, I recognized it being the voice that previously spoke to me. It seems it was this entity that was talking to me.

"No, it's a city. I'm from a state called Pennsylvania." I told it.

"Is that state also a world?" it then asked.

It was clear to me that this entity doesn't know anything about our world. So I became specific.

"No, its part of a country called the United States. I'm from a planet called Earth."

The thing didn't say anything for a few moments. I assumed it was trying to 'process' what I said. The moment it spoke, it said something chilling.

"Nothing was supposed to be alive on that planet. It's filled with its own destruction."

I tried to make sense of that. My best guess was that this thing referred to the world's capabilities as a destructive force, such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, and other disasters Earth is capable of producing.

Then, it asked me another question.

"How did you come to exist on that world?"

"I don't know. It was said that in the theory of evolution, we evolved from primates that existed on the planet long before we became modern humans." I told it. Then, it asked me another question.

"Evolved from primates?" this thing then asked, sounding confused.

Apparently, this entity knew nothing about us. It's as if they were unaware of our existence until now. That's when it asked another question.

"Where did those primates come from?" it asked.

"I don't know. I think they came from bacteria that was on a meteorite? The meteorite crashed onto earth, and in time, the bacteria formed over millions of years, and as a result, we existed." I said. I did not think what I said was true or accurate, but it was the best I could describe it at the time. I also felt nervous and terrified just speaking to this entity, so my mind wasn't clear.

"That ball of rock chose the wrong world to make new life. It also doesn't make sense how that ball of rock could carry bacteria to begin with. You are either lying to us, or you're incompetent." it said, as it started coming towards me. I started to panic, feeling like this entity is about to hurt me.

"I don't know, alright? It's only a theory, so there's no telling how humans truly came to be." I said, in my hopeless efforts to plead with the entity not to threaten me.

"But you sound like it's the truth. Then perhaps you are incompetent." it said. I had so many thoughts flooding my mind, thinking of what this thing will do to me. Thoughts of fear, anxiety, and terror shot through me instantly. Then, it said something that ran more chills down my spine.

"I know everything about you. Your thoughts. Your language. English is not our native tongue, but I'm capable of it. That's why you understand me, and everything I say to you, otherwise I would leave you here, stranded in our world, trapped with a language you wouldn't understand."

I was horrified. This made me realize the fact I was listening to this thing speak in English, but I think it's because I previously suspected I was still back home, abducted by other humans. What made me feel even more terrified was this thing saying it understands me completely. Then, it spoke again.

"You are terrified and timid. Do you not understand us?" it asked me.

"Us?" I asked.

"Do not think I'm the only inhabitant of this world. Look around you." it told me. Then, it smiled at me, revealing what looked like glowing, crimson-red teeth. From my peripherals, I saw another glow of the same color. When I looked in the direction, I noticed there were multiple instances of that smile, which confirmed to me that there were other entities all around us, and they were looking at me. Because of the pitch-blackness, I couldn't see their forms, other than the one I was speaking to thanks to the help of the light sitting above us. There appeared to be twelve more of these entities with us, counting the smiles.

"Are there others like you?" a different figure asked me. It also had that deep, guttural masculine tone, but slightly higher than the previous one.

"Yes. There are." I said, as I reached into my pocket in an attempt to pull out my phone. I was glad that my phone never got taken, or it didn't vanish. When I did, I did a simple google search and typed into the search box: Humans.

Some images of different people all over the world popped up, while others were just depictions of a hominid we evolved from. A few others were silly depictions of human beings. I decided to show the images to that entity.

"But you don't look like them." it told me, so I kindly responded.

"Yes. We are all humans, but we all look different in some way. We come in different races, cultures, as well as other countries around the world. But we are all humans." I explained.

"Races? Cultures? Countries? What's that?" another entity asked, this one having a guttural, but more feminine tone.

I admit, I began to feel slightly annoyed, but understanding that they don't perceive their existence in the same manner as we do. So I kindly explained.

"We come in different races. I'm Caucasian, or "white" as they say. The person on this image, is "black" or an African-American man. Then this woman here is said to be Asian." I said, showing a picture of a woman who I assumed to be from Asia, perhaps Japan or China.

"We also have different cultures around. Her culture is different from mine. We also come from many different countries. I come from a country called the United States. I think this lady may be from China or Japan." I explained.

"You humans are strange beings." said the previous figure, more specifically the one that stood under the light with me. Then, it continued, and I took its next words as an insult.

"You are silly creatures, calling each other different names and things, despite being humans. You just brought to us silly creations of silly minds. You're all humans, therefore you're all the same, but you all see each other differently despite this. Perhaps you consider yourselves 'different' in some way."

"Well, people are trying to find ways how we're all different. Like the 'Race-IQ Gap' that was told by an interesting but also disliked person. It's considered there are racial differences in Intelligence. Even in our genes too, people have claimed different races exist in us." I responded, not thinking of what I just said, but rather out of desperation to help these entities understand why we do this. Of course, I didn't plan to sound racist, but to come up with ideas of how humans classify each other with various means like race, culture, intelligence, all that kind of stuff.

"IQ? Genes? Do you specialize in knowing these?" the figure in front of me then asked.

"No. They are used to determine racial differences in us." I said.

They all started laughing. It seems that these entities view us as stupid beings, trying to classify each other as different races and different cultures despite sharing the same world.

"I was doubtful when I read your mind, but it seems your thoughts and knowledge are genuine. We've never encountered such strange creatures with foolish imaginations. Therefore, we consider you as a repulsive species." it told me.

I admit, I was upset when the entity said that. Then, I said something to it I would later regret.

"Yeah, well your species isn't any better! You all laugh at me, and even insult my Intelligence because I explained something which you yourselves don't understand! You're probably as dumb as I am! There are different countries! There are different cultures! You're just too primitive to see that! Maybe you're all just fucking dumb, perhaps violent like us!"

Yeah, good going Luke, because what happened next, is the reason I'm experiencing this problem I'm having even today. The one in front of me spoke up and said the following:

"Our species has never ridiculed each other, like yours do. Our species never went to war against each other, like yours do. Your fellow 'white' men have judged so-called "colored" people as being the least Intelligent, and called them \[REDACTED\]. Some still do now. The same men of supposed "color" aren't any better. They rely on thievery, murder, and so called "gang" violence as a means of survival. Every piece of your memory and knowledge I'm getting from you, I did not understand them until now. It's clear that you're aware there exists humans in every corner of your world, constantly killing, torturing, or inflicting any means of harm upon each other, sometimes for the sake or for the fun of it. I hoped I wasn't seeing the truth about your species, that your memories and everything you know about your fellow man, is a lie. But now, even from seeing your reactions to us, it was all true."

That's what it told me.

"What are you trying to say?" I anxiously asked the entity,

"You humans are a threat to yourselves, and I fear that in the future, you will become a threat not only to yourselves, but also to our species if your fellow humans discover the whereabouts of our world. It will be a dire problem for us. Therefore, you and your fellow humans must face extinction, to prevent future catastrophes you may inflict on us and others out there who may exist. I will start, with you." it responded to me.

I then realized that the entities now believe we're a primitive and threatening species, and believe we would put an end to their existence if we discovered their world. Just as I was realizing this, the entity suddenly 'floated' a few feet above, and lunged at me. Even though I didn't feel pain, I could feel said entity go into my body.

That's when I suddenly felt dizzy, and just before I could say anything, I passed out.

I woke up shortly after, on a gurney. I assumed that the emergency staff was taking me into the E.R or another room. I was able to look around, and though my vision was a little blurry, I could at least make out some small details of the room I was brought in.

"Good. He's awake." one of the staff members said, looking at me with my eyes open. "That's strange. His heartbeat was erratic. Now it's normal." she said with confusion, looking at the heart rate monitor. My parents came in, crying and happy to know I was okay.

My dad ran up to me and asked me a question which shook me.

"Luke, where were you all this time!? You've been gone for three days!" he asked.

"Three days!? But I was asleep in my room the whole time! I didn't go anywhere else!" I explained.

"No, Luke! You were missing from our house for two days, so we had a 'missing persons' case filed. We found you back on your bed the third day, but you weren't waking up or responding to us! That's why we're in the hospital!" my mom spoke.

When she saw that, my heart sank. Never had I thought I would go missing for about three days. Just thinking about this made me wonder if I truly did end up in that world, and it wasn't a nightmare. My mother also told me that because I was missing, and then came back on the third day unable to wake up until now, she and my father were suspected of attempted homicide. However, there was no trace of drugs or poisonous substances in my body, nor any wounds or damages to my body.

Thinking back on the situation, I explained to my mother.

"I was asleep this whole time. All of a sudden, I ended up in a place that didn't seem-"

I stopped when I felt this strange, guttural feeling in my stomach. It felt slightly painful, but at least it wasn't fatal. Still, I had stomach problems before, and I've never felt this sensation happen.

"Are you okay, dear?" my mother asked me with concern.

"I'm okay. Just a stomach problem, that's all. I just need to use the bathroom." I said.

I got out of the gurney, and went into the bathroom to wash myself. I got to the sink to wash my face, thinking about the events. I assumed that I must've sleepwalked for three days until I woke up. But it wouldn't make much sense, because I would be spotted sleepwalking by my parents or my neighbors quicker than expected. This assumption went away, the moment I looked into the mirror. I saw, it.

What I thought to be that strange, pitch-black entity from the dream, was standing behind me in the mirror, smiling with that crimson-red glow. Afraid, I instantly turned to look at it. Normally, when one sees a strange figure behind and we look, it disappears. However, it was right there, smiling at me for a few moments, before disappearing. Looking back at the mirror, it was truly gone. Then, I was hit by this sudden and horrifying realization:

It followed me back home.

So now, here I am, typing this. I'm back at my dorms, continuing my last semester of college. But like I said, I'm not sure how long I have until I end up at a mental asylum. I tried many methods to get rid of this entity. I went to visit some mental health clinics, believing it was all just a hallucination. However, I never had any improvements, and despite the drugs they prescribed to help me, it didn't do shit since I kept seeing that entity. Then, out of desperation, I turned to religious methods to deal with the issue. Baptists, Priests, anyone capable of blessing my soul along with the places I stayed, only to no avail.

It was clear to me that this 'figure' was from another world outside of our understanding. It wasn't an angry, restless spirit, or a demonic presence haunting me, even though I get this impression because the entity wasn't physical, or composed of any material form. Yet, it can materialize and de-materialize at will, this I'm aware as I been stuck with the entity and have been observing its behavior.

My only question that came to mind was, why hasn't it killed me yet, even to this day? Did it change its mind and decide to roam around our world to learn more about us? Or is he planning to strike at the right time? If it was the latter, I'd wish this entity would get on with it. My life's been going downhill all because of it, since I lost many friends over the fact they think I'm hallucinating every time I tell them there's a dark entity haunting me. My parents think I should be in a mental asylum now, since they're not convinced of my experience, and I wouldn't blame any of you for thinking the same thing.

What I said does sound outlandish, let alone crazy, right? Maybe I am going crazy after all. Maybe I do deserve to be in that mental asylum if this whole thing was just a mindfuck. But I can't say this is truly a mindfuck, given that I was missing for three days and never been spotted within that time, but only to be spotted on the third day on my bed, and the entity matches the appearance of what I saw in the dream. Like I said, I'm not sure if it really was a dream. If it wasn't, why me of all people, get picked to end up in such a place? That didn't make any fucking sense at all.

Just now, I can see the entity in the mirror I have next to my wall, while I'm writing this sentence. I can see it just standing there, smiling at me with those horrifying teeth, giving that crimson-red glow.
