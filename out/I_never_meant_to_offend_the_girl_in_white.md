I started at a new school about 7 weeks ago, due to me moving states. I remember the first week, I made a few new friends and I really enjoyed the school. Everything was going accordingly, until about my third week there. It was fourth period on a Thursday afternoon, and I remember desperately needing to use the restroom. I asked my teacher, who we'll call Mr Su. He agreed to let me go, on the conditions I take no more than 5 minutes. Of course I agreed, and so I went on my way. 

As soon as I was finished, I hurried back to the door to the restrooms, but I was stopped in my tracks when I heard a girl crying. I turned around, trying to find a closed stall, but all of them were opened. With a sigh of confusion, I turned back around and let a screech out when I saw a girl dressed in all white crying. A small gasp escaped my lips as I realised she was crying. But not tears, no, blood. Tears and streams of blood dripped down her face. Her raven hair framed her pale face and skimmed against her stained cheeks.

"Uh.. a-are you okay..?" I stuttered, taken aback by the perplexing sight in front of me. She didn't say anything, just stared. But not a stare as if she could see me, just a blank and empty stare, as if I was completely invisible to her. "He's coming, he's coming for you."

I blinked, and she was gone by the time my eyes flicked back open. Chills ran down my spine, and I hurried back to lesson. "Perfect timing, Lilith, your time was almost up," Mr Su chuckled as I walked in the door. I gave a nervous laugh back, still taken aback by whatever the hell I had seen in the bathroom. There was something about the look in her eyes that looked inhuman. 

For the next week, all I could think about was what she meant. Who is 'he', who is coming for me? But, unaware to me, I would soon find out who 'he' was.

I saw her again, on a Thursday during fourth period... again. It seemed that's the only time I saw her. She did the exact same thing, the same familiar blood stains running down  her chalk face. This time, though, it seemed she saw me. She stared with concerned eyes. "Lilith, he has chosen you. You need to run as far away as you can, you need to go." Her eyes remained fixed on me. "Please, please just tell me who you mean," I pleaded, but to no avail. "Unless you run far, far away. Lilith, please just listen. For your own safety." She then disappeared once again, and I was left puzzled.

The next week, it happened again. But this time I snapped at her. "Just leave me alone already! You're completely useless, your warnings mean nothing, just get away!" \]

For the next three weeks, I didn't see her again. I prayed it would remain that way.. but of course, it didn't.

I'm still shaken up from this experience, and I'm warning you, if you see her, you need to listen. You need to run.

I went to the toilet while in Mr Su's lesson, and I didn't see her. But as I walked out of my stall and looked toward the door, I saw him. 'He' was Death. The face of death stared back at me. A dark aura engulfed him, and I slowly walked back. Before I hit the wall, I bumped into something, I took my eyes off of him and turned around, only to be met by the cold, empty eyes of the girl in white. "I told you to run. I warned you. He maybe would of left you alone if you hadn't disrespected me, he would've let you live. Welcome to the other side, Lilith." They were the last words I heard before my vision went black.

When I awoke, I felt a cold, wet liquid streaming from my eyes. And as I looked down, I saw I was now dressed in white. 

I stood up and peered into the bathroom mirror. She was right, I should've listened. I should've ran. I've been stuck here a week, and I'm slowly going insane. It was a mistake, I never meant to hurt her feelings.
