Hey , this happened pretty recently and im struggling to close an eye over it.

My name is Annabella and Ive been trying to write a story called "Orchid legends of the ancients" for this past year. Plannings been good but progress has been.. rather inneffective.

Recently i was at a used good store, common here in switzerland.

While looking around i found something weird under a shelf. An In box GBA game with a drawing i remember commisioning and "Orchid legends of the ancients on the box.

I was confused to say the least I looked at the back and it gave a description thats basically identical to my Story.

"16 year old Orchid Elsher has a very unusal life, Adopted by her single dad , professional men liker Mattheo when she was a baby, having a crush on her 2 best friends and trying her best  to not be seen as a boy are only the beginning. No the real kicker is that Hoffnung , The spirit of Chaos ( The power of hope and free will) lives in her pendant and helps her play the card game Legends of the ancients. Togetehr with the 2 you must face many diffrent opponents the only question is Can you do it?"

The game looked like a Rpg similar to Pokemon from what  i saw form the screenshots on the back. But the weurdest thing was it was labeled to have released in 2004 , I was Born in 2006. How could this game exist? had i copied the story and forgotten?.

I had to get answer so i bought the game (5 chf pretty cheap).

I went home and it it into my  Ds-lite to start it.

The option for "New game" was grayed out so i selected continue.

When i did i was loaded into darkness being slowly lit by a single candle and i was on a table across from me was Who i recognsied as Mattheo, i designed him to be Orchids adopted dad who loved her to pieces and tried to be as supportive as he could be.

Though this version of Mattheo seemed a bit..off his hair and beard had bits of grey,his sweaters colors looked faded and his eyes..they looked like they had seen some thing no one wants to ever see. Just then he spoke.

" Oh Hello, a new challenge... oh its you. Its been a while hasnt it? ..Perhaps you dont know what im talking about. Anyway,perhaps youve forgotten the rules of this game allow me to explain".

The game from there is pretty diffrent than the one on the back of the box its like a rogue like where you collect cards or aditional boons and all the while youd fight smaller scaled down duels of Legends of the ancients fights.

I saved after a bit and put the game down but i havent been able to get it off my mind.

Why does this game exist? HOW does this game exist? Did i create Orchid? Did i steal it and not Realise? Why is the game so diffrent than whats on the Box? 

And Mattheo... what did he see?

Ill try to get some sleep and keep you updated soon.

Any advice on what i should do or try it out its greatly appreciated.

Ty

<3 Bella
