In 2022, documents on the disappearances of the Plain-View Neighborhood Association were leaked on Halloween. This is exactly three years to the date of the disappearances themselves. What was considered a popular and somewhat spooky mystery turned into a complicated PR disaster with far more sinister undertones than expected. No one is exactly sure why they were leaked, but nonetheless, what appears below is the transcript of the Associations’ Group Chat.

Anyone with information that may be of use in solving these disappearances are encouraged to come forward. We also strongly encourage any linguists familiar with Latin or Greek to come forward. Some grammatical corrections were introduced for readability without compromising the original intent of the messages.

**Trigger Warning:** Some language may be seen as offensive, outdated, or political in nature.

(10.00pm) ***Brian:*** Relax Relax Tomorrow morning I’ll go over and sort this out. Everyone just calm down.

(10.01pm) ***Brian:*** You never know. This could be one of Gary's "funny" jokes. You know what he is like. I'll have some words with him tomorrow though. This one went way WAY too far.

What follows is a audio note. Much of which is indiscernible, but Brian Heap relays information pertaining to the residency of Daisy Shaw. According to the audio note, two smashed windows and an unknown red substance was smeared on the walls of the kitchen. The substance, later confirmed as the common variety pomegranate states.

"Portitor has horrendus aquas et flumina servat terribili squalore Charon, cui plurima mento 300canities inculta iacet; stant lumina flamma, sordidus ex umeris nodo dependet amictus."

Grace Heap was ruled out as a potential person of interest. Odin was left unharmed.
