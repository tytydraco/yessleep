Okay, so this just happened last night, and I’m literally shaking as I type this. I don’t know if I’ll even be alive tomorrow, but I need to get this out there.

I was in my room, scrolling through Reddit (ironically, I was reading r/nosleep—crazy, right?), when I saw something move out of the corner of my eye. I turned my head super slowly, heart pounding in my chest.

It was a shadow.

Not just any shadow, though. It was… darker than normal shadows. Like, REALLY dark. Like, if regular shadows were a 5/10 on the darkness scale, this one was at least a 12. Maybe even a 13.

I blinked. It was still there.

I squinted, trying to make out if it was just my imagination. Maybe it was a trick of the light? But then it wiggled. Yes, WIGGLED. Like it was alive. Like it knew I was looking at it.

I whispered, “Hello?” because that’s what people do in horror movies, and I guess I wanted to be an idiot, too.

No response.

I grabbed my phone and took a picture. The picture came out… normal. Just my wall. No shadow.

I turned back, and the shadow was closer.

I froze. My brain was screaming at me to run, but my legs felt like they were full of wet cement. The shadow wiggled again, like it was laughing at me. Then it whispered:

“Turn off the light.”

I swear my soul left my body.

Now, at this point, any sane person would have run, right? But no, not me. Instead, I decided to be smart and ask, “Why?”

It wiggled some more, and this time, I swear it got even darker. Like, how is that even possible? It was already a 13 on the darkness scale.

“Turn. Off. The. Light.”

I slowly reached for the lamp, but then my brain caught up with me, and I was like, “Wait a minute, why would I do that? That’s literally the dumbest thing ever.”

So instead of turning off the light, I grabbed my lamp and THREW IT at the shadow.

And guess what?

The lamp went right through it.

Like, it didn’t even care. It just stood there, still wiggling, still staring at me (somehow).

I screamed and ran out of my room, nearly tripping over my cat, Mr. Pickles. I burst into my mom’s room, gasping for breath.

“Mom, there’s—there’s something in my room!”

She groaned and rolled over. “Did you eat too much junk food again?”

“No! I swear! It’s a shadow! A really dark one!”

She sighed, got up, and followed me back to my room. But of course, when we got there, the shadow was gone.

Everything looked normal. My lamp was on the floor, my bed was messy, and my phone was still open to Reddit.

Mom just shook her head. “Go to sleep. And stop reading those creepy stories before bed.”

I tried to argue, but she turned off the light and left.

I held my breath.

For a few seconds, everything was quiet.

Then, from the corner of my room, in the darkness, I heard the whisper again.

“Thank you.”

I am NOT sleeping tonight.
