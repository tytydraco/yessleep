I'm so sorry. I didn't want to involve you. I never meant to get you involved, just by reading this.. I'm just so sorry.


I got caught up in this, like you are now, as you read this you're now part of the game and the only way you can leave is by doing what I'm doing now >!It's almost already too late!<.

>!Stop reading now, please, They are tracking you! !<


Must stick to the rules >!They cant read what's in the spoilers, It's some kind of programming oversight!< , They dont mind me telling you about them because it's too late, and they know this >!They can detect a spoiler but not read them, cant put too many or they will know somethings up!<. When the time comes you'll be contacted..once they have made contact the clocks ticking.


This is the information passed on to me. Im so so sorry. These are not my words and you need to keep these and pass them on word for word. Oh God Im so so sorry...

***'We know your name. We know your address. We know where you work or where you spend your time when you are meant to be looking for work. If you are reading this then the previous contestant has passed their part of the game on to you. Congratulations.***

***Make no mistake, this is no scam. This is no scary story. This will determine how you will be judged and only you can influence the outcome. If you try to contact the authorities we will cut the call then cut your throat. If you try to contact friends or family then we will make contact with them.. You dont want that.***

***You must kill someone, anyone, it must be within 2 hours of our call which is in 26 minutes.'***


>!I did it...Mr Robinson.....I'm so fucking sorry...I had to...I was running out of time. Fuck....ok ok, this is what we are going to do. !<

I went into my neighbours house......he was asleep in the armchair, TV still playing in the background. Mrs Robinson was fast asleep upstairs. You must take photos for proof and you must take an item from your victim and keep it safe, its their way of tying you to the crime. >!Im going to the police after this, I'm putting an end to this before you have to do anything, hang in there.!<


I can still see the look of fear in his eyes as I stuck him with that kitchen blade.....I'm so fucking sorry.


Forgive me, I had no choice. I couldn't risk them hurting Melissa and the kids, if you have a family you understand, Oh God I hope you dont have a family.

>!Right, as soon as you have read this and had the call, I need you to meet me, meet me at 145 west Boulav..!<


>!He won't be sending you anymore messages, he was mistaken...we can read spoilers..!<


>!You now have 30 minutes to get your kill, and pass on the game. See you in round two. !<
