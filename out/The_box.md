Some of the best memories of my childhood don’t involve toys, birthday parties, or old photographs.

They involve places.

I was nine years old when all of this happened. I was a quiet kid, the kind who spent a lot of time staring at landscapes and wandering around, enjoying moments alone. I was never very popular, so I didn’t have many friends—but I had Eli. He was my best friend.

We’d known each other for about two years. It was Eli who showed me our meeting spot: a road that crossed the sea at the edge of the city. We stayed on the stretch of land before the water began, underneath the bridge, where the noise of cars faded into background hum and no one paid attention to us.

Around that time, I had started exploring emptier places. I felt a strange sense of peace in them. One of those places was a park.

The park had never been opened to the public. Construction had started and then abruptly stopped. I went there often, always telling my mom I was going to the arcade, when in reality I was wandering through that abandoned space.

The park was surrounded by tall metal construction panels, but not completely. If you walked around to where the land met the woods, there was a low, crooked fence—easy to climb.

What made that place special was one thing.

The sunset.

There was a small hill inside the park. If you climbed it, you reached a specific spot where you could watch the sun rise and set behind the city.

It’s hard to put into words, but every time I saw it, it felt new.

I invited two other friends to go with us—Remy and Levi, two brothers who were chaotic but fun. And of course, I invited Eli. I had this feeling that I needed to show it to him, that he would love it.

Eli didn’t like the idea when I told him.

He said he was tired of the walk. That his mom didn’t like him getting home late. That places like that always led to trouble.

I laughed. I told him it was nothing, that I went there all the time, that it was safe.

Over the next few days, I kept mentioning it. Not insisting—just casual comments. Saying the sunset had been beautiful that day. That it might be the last one before the weather changed.

Eventually, he sighed and said he’d go.
Not because he wanted to.
But because he trusted me.

So I picked a day when all four of us could go.

We agreed we’d tell our parents we were going to the arcade, grab something to eat, and be back before it got completely dark.

I met the brothers under the bridge. They were throwing rocks into the water. Eli arrived shortly after, and then we headed toward the park.

I showed them the hidden way in. My heart raced as evening settled in. Even though I was used to being there, it felt different bringing friends along.

“This place is huge,” Remy said, already climbing the fence and swinging from it like it was a game.

There wasn’t much inside—just sand, construction materials, and a few unfinished benches. Still, being there felt special. Like we had some kind of VIP access.

I led them to a path that cut through a small wooded area. There were markings where lampposts were supposed to be, but they stopped halfway. If you kept going and climbed a bit higher, you reached a clearing. Just past a few trees was the best view of all.

We arrived just as the sun began to set.
Eli broke the silence.

“Wow… it really is beautiful.”

I smiled and said that I was always right, that they should enjoy it.

Remy and Levi started arguing about which buildings they could recognize from up there. One of them swore he could see his house. The other said that was impossible. I barely listened. I was watching the sun. It was even better than last time.

Eli stayed quiet.

After a while, he stepped closer to me and spoke softly, like he didn’t want to ruin the moment.

“We should probably head back,” he said. “It’s getting late.”

I looked behind us, toward the path we’d come from. The trees were already turning into overlapping shadows, and the line of lampposts was fading into the dim light.

“Relax,” I said. “We’ve got time. Besides, I know a shortcut.”

He frowned.

“A shortcut?”

I nodded. “It’s shorter. It brings us out closer to home. I’ve done it before.”

That wasn’t exactly a lie. I’d been there once during the day. It hadn’t led anywhere important—just more woods and a section I hadn’t explored much.

One of the brothers joked that if a shortcut were any good, it would be called a road. The other asked if Eli was scared, which he quickly denied.

“Then let’s go before we screw ourselves,” 

I said, laughing.

Eli hesitated. Just for a second—but I noticed. He glanced back at the familiar path, then at me.

“You’re sure?”

I nodded.

We descended on the opposite side of the clearing, where the vegetation thickened. The path wasn’t really a path—just a place where the plants looked like they’d been pushed aside at some point. Dry branches cracked beneath our feet. The low sun filtered through the leaves in thin, crooked beams.

Remy walked ahead with me, kicking rocks. Levi followed, unusually quiet. Eli stayed in the back.

After a few minutes, I noticed something was off.

The sound had changed.

The leaves still moved when we brushed past them, but the constant background noise—the wind, the woods—was gone.

“Do you guys hear that?” Remy asked, slowing down.

“Hear what?” Levi said.

Remy paused, then grinned.

“A ghost,” he said. “Mwahahaha.”

Levi rolled his eyes and lightly punched his arm.

We laughed.

We kept walking. The sky between the trees had lost its orange glow and was turning dark blue—too fast for my liking. I tried to recognize something, anything—a fallen tree, a rock—but everything looked the same.

“Guys… we’ve passed this rock already.”

I looked down. A large, uneven stone with a pale streak across the middle.

“No,” I said quickly. “There are a bunch like that.”

Not long after, I started recognizing the path again. Realizing we were heading the right way filled me with confidence.

I moved to the front, certain we’d leave with nothing but a good story.

Then Levi stopped.

“Guys… what’s that?”

I followed his gaze. Between the trees, something stood out—a faded wooden box, tipped on its side, leaning against a tree.

My chest tightened. I felt the tension ripple behind me.

“A treasure chest?” Remy tried to joke, but his voice came out low and strained.

Levi took a step forward, then back.
“I don’t know… it looks wrong.”

I ignored the feeling and moved closer, pushing branches aside. Remy followed but stopped short, his hands shaking. Eli stayed back, clearly wanting to leave. Levi stood frozen, breathing hard.

I crouched near the box. The smell of damp earth mixed with something stronger.

Something rotten.

A chill ran down my spine, but I shook it off.

Remy leaned over my shoulder.
“Dude… that smells awful.”

Levi muttered, “It smells like something died.”

Eli finally spoke, barely above a whisper.
“I think we should go.”

He was gripping the hem of his shirt, knuckles white.

I hesitated. Then I pushed the lid open.

The hinges creaked loudly. The air felt heavier. The smell intensified, thick and suffocating. We all covered our noses instinctively.

Remy swallowed hard. Levi turned away. Eli took several steps back, tense and rigid.

Inside the box, wrapped in dark plastic bags, was something that didn’t belong there.

Remy stumbled backward, his face drained of color, eyes locked on the contents. A heavy silence fell over us.

Then he screamed.

A scream that came from somewhere deep inside him.

“What is that? What the fuck is that?!”

Inside the bag was a body.

Not whole.

Just a torso.

I slammed the lid shut and stumbled back.

Levi turned away and vomited onto the ground.

Eli didn’t say a word. He just turned his face aside and stepped backward, nearly falling.

I looked at the brothers. Remy was breathing fast, shaking. Levi wiped his mouth with his sleeve over and over. Eli stared at the ground, breathing hard.

“Let’s go,” I whispered, finally taking the lead again—guiding us along the shortcut that had once felt so safe.

The woods felt different now. Shadows stretched unnaturally. Every sound was too loud. Even the snap of branches under our feet felt threatening.

We left in near silence, each of us dealing with it in our own way. Even when we reached the exit, the weight of it followed us.

When we reached the street, everyone ran toward their houses. No one looked back.

I didn’t tell my family what I’d seen. I planned to talk to the others the next day, figure out what to do.

But the next day, none of us went to school.

All four of us missing school was rare.

That afternoon, the police came to my house.

Two officers in dark vests stood at the door. One of them said he needed to speak with me.

The words left my mouth, along with the air in my lungs—and didn’t come back.

We sat in the living room. My parents and I on the couch. The officers across from us.

“Your son saw something yesterday,” one of them said, looking at my parents. “Something we’re investigating. We need his account.”

My parents exchanged a tense glance. My father nodded, trying to stay calm, though his fingers trembled. My mother gripped my arm tightly.

I wanted to run. To disappear. I wanted that day to never have existed. My vision blurred, my face breaking into tears. All I could say was sorry.

“I’m sorry, Mom… I didn’t mean—”

A sharp noise cut me off.

One of the officer’s radios crackled.

The other spoke, his voice low and serious.

“We found the box and the body. Likely David Herson. Ten years old.”

My stomach dropped.

I knew that name.

David Herson.

He was the boy who lived in the house next to Eli’s.
