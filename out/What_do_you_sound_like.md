I’m not sure why I’m writing this here, conventional medicine has me classified as a maniac but I suppose if I can get this out there on the internet then someone might be able to help.

To keep it simple, I can’t hear anything

Well, that’s a bit contrived, I can hear, but it’s not normal, something is missing. I was deaf for the first decade of my life before I got surgery to give me my hearing back. I know what the complete absence of sound is, and this is not it, I’d much prefer total loss than this nightmare.

There’s no noise, but there is ‘something’ and I know this because I still wince whenever a loud noise would be made but there just isn’t anything else. I can’t tell it’s coming though so I’m always caught off guard.

I’d learned to live with it, especially since multiple doctors have said my ‘hearing’ is fine and is ‘probably just gradual hearing loss’. I’ve been this way for ten months now and I’ve mostly adapted because I already knew how to read lips.

But a week ago I heard something, really heard something. It would’ve been lost in the general mix of sounds in a suburban area, god I miss that, but I heard it.

It sounded like a footstep, but barefoot and I couldn’t be sure but it seemed laboured, like whoever had taken that step was in pain. I went to investigate but I couldn’t tell where it had come from and honestly I questioned if I was finally beginning to go insane until I heard it again.

This time it was louder, closer. I wasn’t anywhere too populated so I thought I could find the source but it had evaded me again, leaving me looking around frantically and making those around me steer clear out of caution.

It went on like this for days and I’m hearing it as I type this out now, it gets closer every day and I need answers fast.

Update: I forgot I wrote this, it’s been another month, and I still haven’t seen the entity making the sound, it’s encapsulated every waking moment I have, I am enveloped in its noise and it bothers me more and more every time I hear it.

The time between the steps has changed, they happen more frequently, more every day and one after the other. I need to find it’s source.

Update #2: it’s constant, I hear it all the time, my nightmare has gotten worse, please just make me deaf again. I’ve been searching everywhere, making a fool of myself outside trying to find the source and I’ve gotten nowhere. I’ve resorted to demanding the people of the town to walk for me so I can hear their steps but besides the worried glances, I get nothing.

I’m thinking of giving up, I’ll live whatever I have left of this miserable life so I’ll sign off here and hopefully I can…

Wait, what’s that? It sounds different. Wait? What? I can hear… breathing? Pained breathing, but I can’t see anything, I don’t know where it’s coming from!

Update #3: I don’t know if any of you are safe, I’m so sorry if I’ve brought this onto you but I have to get this out there to warn you. If you end up like me, don’t listen, don’t look for the source, heed my warning. Lest the source finds you and asks.

“What do you sound like?”
