It's been a little over a year since this has happened. I've been told, or well I looked up that writing a diary entry or something else to keep notes was better, for my mental health and all. I don't know why this has been happening or how, but I stopped asking after some time. Each and every time I'm about to head home I see something, something that's never human. It's always been my last customer of the day, or at least the last one triggers it.

I was driving down the hollow empty streets, devoid of almost anyone except the few aimless wandering them. My eyes were scanning for my last passenger. It was the dead of night, I prefer ending it at this time. There were usually less people around so it seemed less weird to everyone's eyes. It's not like they were hard to spot or anything, it's just I wasn't too keen on accidently driving past them. Until I finally spotted him, despite the heavy rain beating down on the streets he was unmistakable. 

A lengthy, well dressed man, ready and fit for work. His face was what clued me in. Whatever was his head it had been replaced with a large flowing flame that spewed out of a black spot center. The flame became like a star and its burning was soft and gentle, it felt almost angelic, with a small bowler hat resting on top. What was surreal was how this object functioned, it looked like 2d vestige . No matter how I turned my head or observed it, it was the same view it didn't change. 

I pulled up right next to him, slowing down to an eventual stop. I waited for a moment before p he moved. Eventually he opened the door crawling his way in. He could barely fit having to readjust himself. “Sorry if it's a bit cramped sir.” He paid me no mind, slowly moving himself to close the door. He turns sitting in his legs tucked together as he attempts to fit. I saw him limply reaching his hand out shaking, within his black gloves were two large coins. I didn't know what they were or how they got them. Once I tried to sell them, but apparently there was no metal that matched the coins, although it was adjacent to copper apparently. 

I took the coins thanking him as I placed them on the passenger seat. “Thanks, sir. So….where do you want to go”. The man paused before I heard a faint deep voice, it was uncanny and vague. It sounded like a human but different, and confused. “Work, go to work”. It mumbled out sounding like it didn't know the words that it spoke. “Sir you don't have to go to work”. I said it gently making sure there was a small little pause between each word so I didn't confuse it. “Work, now.”

“Alright sir” I began slowly driving through the dark streets, lights littering the view of open shops, lamps, and apartments. The rain refused to let up as I drove. “Do you have a family?” it paused, while I couldn't hear it, I felt like it was taking a deep breath. “W-work” it sounded less uncanny this time, the voice was more coherent, more human. “i-i’ve been told. It's a blessing. But I'm…..I'm only in my early twenties and all.” I was glad to hear it respond quickly. “Yes, there a blessing.”

“So you do have a family sir, that's great. Do you know where they are?” I couldn't tell if he was stunned or just thinking to himself again. I know these types, the more inhuman they look the more confused they are. “H-home” I started driving knowing my destination, knowing these things made my job a lot less difficult and prevented me from using the guessing game and having to waste gas on driving in circles. 

“i-i was heading home” despite these being new words he spoke like a regular man, I could still hear the confusion in his voice. Yet it was still unmistakably human. We drove slowly moving around the city until I began approaching his home. “M-my daughter.” 
I paused for a moment, slowing the car until I reached an eventual stop. 

“Your daughter”. I faced the streets, my eyes locked on the rain drops falling into the newly formed puddles. “M-my daughter, s-she started school recently.” *I turned my head facing a what seemed to be a different world, the dark dingy streets were replaced with what seemed like a dream. It was like a sunny day, bearing a fuzzy filter over it. I looked to the side, where I parked up, seeing an almost picturesque home. There was a nice colorful garden and a few people walking by with grins ingrained into their faces. “I was suppose to take her to school”

A little girl, only around 6 years old stumbled out racing towards the car with an innocent little grin, skipping over. “Papa” her features were misty, and vague. I could make out her eyes and mouth but everything else was a blur. I heard the car door open as the man stepped outside. Both of them walked towards the house, the little girl grabbing his hand as she excitedly skipped. I couldn't see his face, by the time the flame disappeared he had his head turned back to me only being able to see his hair. I watched them slowly walk the closer they got. I saw the two of them get enveloped by flames. “We waited so long papa.” 

I blinked, the ghostly vestige of an almost stereotypical American house vanished, replaced with the large ruins of a long burnt and charred building. It was such a shell it could have been knocked over by the rain beating down on it. I took a sigh fidgeting with my face as I look across the streets eyeing it for anyone unusual. Thankfully there was no one, else left so I made a break back to my apartment.

Although recently I did find some use to these coins, there's a reason I keep doing this. The coins end up disappearing every week and that's when I found out what they do. I can't avoid the monsters if I don't bring them to where they want to go, they may just follow me
