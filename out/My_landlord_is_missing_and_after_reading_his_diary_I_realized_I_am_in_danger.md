I did it! I officially moved into my first place after graduating college. I was so excited to move away from my parents and start a more independent life. 

It had taken weeks of searching before the end of the semester, but I finally found a small room in a modest house for rent. I had never rented a room in a house before, so it did surprise me when the landlord informed me before signing the lease that he would be living in the house with me. My mom raged at the idea of me living alone with a man I didn't know. I understood her concern but at least for the time being, it was the most affordable option I could find.

But this was not good enough for mom, so she stalked my landlord on social media. Oddly enough, there was little to be found. After enough digging, she eventually found his LinkedIn. “Dr. D. Moskowitz,” he looked to be a wiry man in his 30s or 40s. His face was angular, almost sharp, and pointy looking. He had black hair, large brown eyes, and neatly trimmed facial hair. At worst, I thought he looked a bit strange, almost unreal, but that wasn't reason enough to not live with someone, at least to me. 

Mom, however, was deeply unsettled. “There's something about this man that doesn't look right,” she said, “I can't place my finger on what that is exactly. But I'm not comfortable with you living here. That man looks like a bat with those big eyes and I just sense darkness about him. I don't trust that this would be a good decision for you.”

I gave her an exasperated expression. “Well, he can have as much ‘darkness about him’ as he pleases if he rents a room out for $400 a month.”

She shot back daggers at me. “I'm serious. Call it a mother’s intuition, but I recall you telling me that my first impressions of people are always correct.”

I sighed. “Almost always, mom. Let’s not assume horrible things about someone just because you think they look funny.”

She didn't like that answer but as far as I was concerned, it was settled.

On their way out, mom reminded me again that she and dad were on my phone’s speed dial, and that she had friends at the local sheriff's department. 

Move-in day went successfully, as expected, with one exception. My landlord was nowhere to be seen.

I messaged him accordingly. "Hi Dr. Moskowitz, I just moved all of my things in. Are you on vacation? If so, I'm sorry to disturb you, I just wanted to check in so you don’t think your house has been broken into when you return. Hope to see you soon."

A few days passed without a response. I was starting to get nervous. While I had pre-paid my rent for this month and next, the concern was not monetary, I was starting to wonder if my landlord had been kidnapped or murdered.

I smirked despite myself, I did think landlords were leeches on society, but I truly was worried something horrible had happened to Dr. Moskowitz. 

Eventually, weeks passed. There had been a key under the mat when I moved in, so at the least, I could come and go as I pleased without needing to learn any special lock or security codes. For the time being, I stopped concerning myself with my landlord, because maybe, as dad said, he was taking a hands-off approach and I needed to stop worrying about it.

Eventually, it had been two months. No landlord in sight or my messages. And for those two months, I dutifully kept to the bottom floor of the house without straying upstairs. But as time grew on, I was beginning to be tempted. That’s where Dr. Moskowitz was supposed to live. But he had explicitly told me, "upstairs is off-limits." 

I eyed the stairs to the second floor with trepidation. I walked up a step, then three, and then quickly ran back downstairs. My gut screamed at me, “do not proceed!” If Dr. Moskowitz wasn't answering my messages, what if something horrible had happened to him? What if he was dead, what if his body was in that upstairs room I was forbidden to enter? I briefly considered calling the police, but what would I say? Should I file a missing person's report? No, that would be an overreaction, right? 

I looked to the stairs once more and sighed deeply. Fine, I would look upstairs. Just to see if Dr. Moskowitz was there and alive. And if he wasn't there then I'd just go back downstairs and pretend that nothing ever happened.

With each step up the stairs, I felt my heart racing. I knew I was being ridiculous but I couldn't help it. I felt as though a monster would jump out at me at any moment.

Once my feet touched the carpet of the second floor, I began scanning the area. No one in his office, no one in the bathroom, no one in the bonus room, and more importantly, no bodies. I felt myself gulp as I faced Dr. Moskowitz's bedroom door. That was the last place unexplored, the last stone unturned.

I closed my eyes and exhaled. Everything was going to be fine? I hoped. I reached my hand for the doorknob and as I tried to turn it, noticed it was locked. 

I felt myself freeze in place. What did I do now, run back downstairs, and try to find a key? Against my better judgment, I looked around for a key. I walked into the office to see if he had left any personal items around like that. 

I scanned the room. No key? Great. But just as I was about to leave, I heard something fall to the floor. I turned around to see a pad of sticky notes had fallen off of Dr. Moskowitz's desk. I picked it up and put it back on the desk. Before I could ruminate on that being kind of weird, I looked at the sticky note. 

"The door will open when you are ready to receive me."
