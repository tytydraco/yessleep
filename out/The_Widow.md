September 1^(st), 1995 

Alderbrook, Oregon  

Officer Parker McDermott 

Bage Number 4823  

Transcription of audio file titled “Audio log one” 

“Officer McDermott reporting on Highway 19. The emptiest road this side of the state. Nothing but a two-way, curvy road with desert on both sides. Chief decided this was a clever way to torture me. Wasting my nights away, alone.” 

A pause in the audio log, a crinkling sound can be heard. 

“At least I get to eat snacks.” 

A tapping sound is heard coming from inside the vehicle. Assumed to be Officer Dermott drumming on his steering wheel.  

“I honestly don’t see what I did wrong. I am an officer of law. I serve and protect the town. If an order is wrong, then I’m not doi--”  

BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP 

“What in the world?”  

Officer McDermott shifts around in his patrol vehicle. Clicking and typing sounds can be heard. 

“The uh, the LIDAR just went off. No cars are present on the highway. Maybe it’s a malfunction.” 

More typing and the sound of Officer McDermott hitting the LIDAR gun. 

“So, this can’t be right. This thing just clocked something going 245mph. It’s 1:34 AM, no one is out here. Tomorrow, I need to get this thing fixed.” 

The audio recording cuts off. Let the record show that Officer McDermott does not log what the LIDAR gun caught. A pause for about 2 minutes  

“Okay, I shouldn’t freak out. Technology is weird. Things glitch all the time.”  

Crinkling sounds can be heard again. 

“What can I talk about to calm myself down... Oh! I saw this movie trailer on T.V today. It's for this new action flick with Brad Pitt. It looks pretty cool. He’s a detective with Morgan Freeman and they basically have to--”  

BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP 

Silence on the recording. Heavy breathing is heard, followed by typing. Radio static is heard.  

“Officer McDermott to dispatch. Officer McDermott to dispatch, over.” 

“Dispatch to McDermott, what seems to be the problem, over.” 

“My LIDAR seems to be acting funny. It keeps clocking super high speeds, but nothing is going by me, over” 

“Just finish out your shift and we’ll get it checked out tomorrow, over.” 

“10-4” 

Officer McDermott sits in silence for the remainder of his shift. Again, he did not log the speeds into any sort of database, nor did he file a report of his equipment malfunctioning.  

 

September 4^(th) , 1995 

Transcription of audio file titled “Audio log four” 

“So, this morning I went to the station and got another new LIDAR. No one really believed me when I said it went off on its own. I know I saw actual speeds.” 

Officer McDermott shifts around his vehicle. 

“I brought a book, it’s a Stephen King novel called ‘Gerald’s Game’, the lady at the bookstore said it was good for a King book. Hopefully that’ll distract me. It gets really boring out here. And lonely. Lonely and boring. You know, Officer Cooper told me this story about the road. Some local legend stuff. He was telling me this story of how people would always go missing on this road. Late at night, too. And that this huge spider women would chase cars down the highway and eat the people inside. I think it’s all bullshit.” 

For 10 minutes, the sound of pages turning and breathing is heard. Until there is a faint sound of scratching. 

“What the fuck was that” 

The door opens, and McDermott can be heard cocking his gun.  

“Alderbrook Police Department! If anyone is out there make yourself known!”  

Footsteps are heard; we assume McDermott is walking around the vehicle. After a few seconds of the footsteps, we hear McDermott laughing. 

“It’s a tumble weed! Ha! A damn tumble weed scratching my car.” 

McDermott gets back in his patrol vehicle and slams the door shut. The following is a combination of the audio file and what was typed on his computer.  

“I was so worked up about nothing. Man, I need to stop being so para--” 

The beeping sound from the night previous is heard. 

“You gotta be kidding me. I just had this thing replaced.” 

238 mph at 12:24 AM. Might be a malfunction. 

Again, we hear the beeps. 

245mph at 12:25 AM.  ? ? 

“Alright, this has to be a prank” 

Again, but faster than normal.  

267mph at 12:26 AM LETMEINLETMEINLETMEIN 

“This can’t be possible. Nothing is here!” 

Again, but it’s quicker. 

278 mph at 12:27 HELPHELPHELPHELPHELPHELPHELP 

“Leave me alone!” 

The beeping has turned into a high-pitched noise.  

300 OHGODPLEASEHELPMEHELPHELPHELPHELP 

“FUCK!” 

McDermott starts his patrol vehicle and drives away. The high-pitched sound stops right before the audio recording ends, with the sound of McDermott sobbing. When asked by Chief DeVries what the writing was about, Officer McDermott says he doesn’t remember typing anything.  

September 12^(th), 1995 

Transcription of audio file titled “Audio log twelve” 

“I haven’t been able to shake this feeling of being watched. Like someone, or something, is watching me just out of view of my peripheral vision. I don’t know. Maybe this road is making me crazy. Wouldn’t that be something.” 

We hear the turning of pages, assuming that McDermott is reading. After about an hour of silence, a car horn is heard. The sound of the audio recorder moving around takes over the recording. We hear the end of his sentence as he approved the other vehicle. 

“...trouble in the dark sir?” 

A man's voice, later identified as Charlie Lambers, is heard. 

“Sorry to bother you officer, but I’m having some engine trouble.”  

“What seems to be the issue” 

“Looks like my battery died. Do you have jumper cables?” 

“I should, let me pull my car up so we can get you charged up” 

Officer McDermott proceeds to move his vehicle over to the front of Charlies car.  

“There, let me go get them.” 

“I really appreciate it, Officer.” 

“So, what’re you doing driving this road so late?” 

“I’m doing a solo road trip across the country before I go to college. Like my last hoorah before I’m back to work.” 

“Sounds like fun, where are you from originally?” 

“Oh, I’m from Kansas.” 

“Nice! Here they are...now whe-” 

Silence for a moment. We hear the sound of an engine running, and the wind hollowing. 

“Hello? Buddy? Where did you go?” 

We hear shuffling noises, and the low hum of the vehicle's engines. 

“Hey, if you’re trying to pull a fast one on me, it won’t work” 

McDermott draws his weapon and begins scanning the area.  

“I’m still a police officer, so if you’re trying to do anything wild, i will-” 

Radio silence.  

“Oh good lord.” 

McDermott runs back to his patrol vehicle. 

“Officer McDermott on highway 19, I have a 10-54, please send available units out!” 

“Officers Cooper and Miller responding and en route” 

We hear the muffled sounds of gagging from McDermott. 

“Oh god, this is so bad.” 

He leaves the vehicle. 

“This is Officer McDermott with the Alderbrook Police Department, make yourself known!” 

Silence.   
“Make yourself known know!” 

Again, silent. After a few seconds, a distance high-pitched screaming is heard. 

“Alderbrook Police Department! Show yourself or I will open fire!” 

Police sirens are heard approaching. Officer Cooper and Officer Miller arrive on scene. Initials will be used in this corresponding conversation. 

BC: Jesus Christ McDermott, how the hell did this happen 

PM: I don’t know, I went to go get jumper cables and I come back and...and 

RM: Oh god, I’m gonna call the corners office.  

PM: It all happened in a second! Like, like it was so quick and quiet, I don’t know what to do.  

BC: Did you see anyone else with him? God, this is disgusting.  

PM: No! I literally turned around! We were having a conversation! 

RM: Corners office is en route.  

BC: Thanks Miller, now McDermott, did you at least get this guy's name?   
PM: No, all I know is that he’s from Kansas.  

RM: I thought putting you out here would make you a better cop, but jeez, a guy was massacred right in front of you.  

PM: You don’t have to remind me, Miller! I know I let this happen. Shit.  

The audio log is cut off.  

The body of Charlie Lambers was pale and looked to be drained of all blood. What was left in his bloodstream seemed to be a mix of his own blood and some sort of paralytic venom. His abdomen was ripped open, but not with precision; it looks adjacent to someone digging into his stomach and pulling it open. The edges of skin were black and coated in a strange saliva-like substance. Most of his organs were missing and/or liquified. When medical examiners tested the liquified organs, most were a mix of bile, chunks of skin, and some of the strange saliva discovered on the outer parts of his body. The officers in this case do not have any suspects as no one was there on scene besides Charlie and Officer McDermott.  Officer McDermotts LIDAR went off at 1:35 AM, clocking something going past at 254 mph. 

 

September 16^(th), 1995 

Transcription of audio file titled “Audio file 16HELPHELPHELPHELP” 

“I don’t know what else I’m supposed to do. This road is playing with me. Even when I’m not out here, it’s like it follows me home. In my dreams, I can hear something calling me. This sultry, deep woman's voice calling my name. Begging me to join her. How she feels lonely on the road. And every time I follow her out onto the road, I see this thing. A tall, slim, black spider. Half of the body is the woman. Long, slick, black hair covering her face. Bright, round, white eyes peeking out between the strands. She crawls toward me, and her jaws open to show fangs and rows of sharp teeth. I always wake up before she can consume me. I don’t know if this is my brain fucking with me or something has a hold on me.” 

McDermott sits in silence for 10 minutes.  

“Gerald’s Game is pretty fucked up book. I finished reading it earlier today. I should pick something nicer to read when I’m off. Or maybe I can pick up a new hobby. My Nana says knitting calms the body and the mind.” 

We hear a roaring engine and loud speakers as a car rushes past.  

BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP 

186mph at 12:39AM 

“Finally, something to do!”   
McDermott actives his sirens and lights and proceeds to chase down the other vehicle. The sirens blare over the audio recording; another sound is heard but is hard to decipher over. It’s either tires screeching or a woman’s scream.  

“Alderbrook Police Department! Pull over!” 

McDermott says over the intercom system. The other vehicle slows to stop and pulls over. 

“Turn your engine off and put your hands out the door!”  

“Please man! It’s right behind us! You gotta let us go!” 

McDermott radioed dispatch 

“Officer McDermott to dispatch, I have a possible 10-55. Please stand by, over” 

“Copy that, over” 

McDermott proceeded to exit his patrol vehicle and approach the vehicle. 

“License and registration please.” 

“Please Officer you have to believe me, this...this giant black creature thing was chasing us down the road!” 

“Have you been drinking or consuming any sorts of drugs tonight?” 

“What? No! Look behind us man! Its gonna catch up to us!” 

McDermott walks into the road with his flashlight drawn. 

“There is nothing on this road but you, me, and the sand. So please, license and registration” 

“What?!”  

The other gentlemen poked his head out the window. 

“That’s not possible!” 

“Sir, I need to see your license and registration” 

“It was following me! I swear on everything holy it was behind me!”  

“McDermott to dispatch, I need back up on highway 19, suspect is not cooperating and appears to be intoxicated, over.” 

“Dude, I already told you! I’m not intoxicated or anything!” 

“Then show me your license and registration!” 

“Officer Miller en route, standby, over” 

The suspect shoved his license and registration out the window.  

“Very nice, don’t move.” 

McDermott goes back to his vehicle and processes the suspect's information. Screaming can be heard, assumed to be the suspect.  

“Oh jeez” 

McDermott steps out of his vehicle and approaches. 

“IT’S COMING! LOOK BEHIND YOU!” 

“The only thing coming is my other officer. Please step out of the vehicle for me.” 

“Hell no! Not when she’s approaching!” 

“There is nothing coming besides another officer. Now step out of the vehicle please, with your hands behind your head.” 

The suspect slowly opens his car door and shakingly comes out. He stares down the road with wide eyes, as observed by McDermott.  

“Now, I have some reasons to suspect that you’re intoxicated, so I need you to perform some field sobriety tests for me, is that alright?” 

The suspect says nothing. Just staring down the road as Officer Miller pulled behind McDermotts vehicle. Initials will be used in this part of the document; the suspects' name was never identified, so the initials HS (Highway Suspect) will be used. 

RM: “What seems to be the issue here McDermott” 

PM: “He’s not cooperating and keeps talking about something following him” 

HS: “She’s real! She was there!”  

RM: “Sir, what’s your name?” 

HS: “She comes for every man on this road.” 

RM: “Sir, I asked for your name. Can you tell me your name?” 

HS: “The Widow” 

PM: “Excuse me?” 

The suspect starts to walk towards them. His eyes are wide, almost uncannily wide. As described by Officer McDermott in a later report. Officer Miller draws her weapon.  

RM: “Stop! Stop where you are!”   
HS: “She comes for the sons of Adam” 

PM: “Sir, please stop” 

He comes closer, dropping his arms and screaming. Loud, demonic like screams come out of the man. 

RM: “If you do not stop, I will shoot!” 

HS: “SHE’S COMING” 

The man sprints toward them and Officer Miller opens fire.  

RM: “Call dispatch and have them send an ambulance. McDermott. You okay?” 

PM: “Yeah, sorry. I froze. I’m sorry” 

RM: “Just call dispatch. It had to be done” 

Officer McDermott called into dispatch and ambulances arrived on scene. The man did not have any identifying information on him and the vehicle was reported owning to an elderly woman who reported it stolen earlier in the day. When doing a toxicology report, no alcohol or drugs were in his system, but a strange substance that came up as inconclusive came up. The audio log continues after all the other vehicles leave. 

“He saw her. He died because he saw her. Something is on this road. I have to do something.”  

The audio file ends.  

September 21^(st), 1995 

Transcription of audio file titled “NOONECANSAVEHIM” 

“So, I was able to get a spike strip. I’ve almost caught this thing going past me twice, and I don’t plan on letting it get past me tonight. I attempted to get it on camera with one of my sisters’ motion activated cameras, but all I got was a blur of nothing. So, this has to work. My nightmares have gotten worse ever since the incident on the sixteenth. I hear her voice more frequently, even when I’m not sleeping. I can’t shake the feeling that she wants me to find her.”  

Officer McDermott has been showing signs of mental distress more frequently since September 16^(th). Anytime Chief DeVries suggested that he get a psych evaluation, he declined. Chief DeVries even offered to have him reassigned, but again, he declined. Since he has been stationed on Highway 19, he has logged over 50 LIDAR returns. 

“I just have to be vigilant tonight. No distractions.”  

The audio log is silent for an hour. 

BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP 

“Oh shit” 

245mph at 1:20AM 

McDermott got out of his vehicle and let out a sigh. 

“Shit. Nothing.” 

He goes to back his vehicle and sits in silence for a while  

The beeping chirps from the LIDAR 

267mph at 1:38AM 

“Again, how is nothing happening?” 

McDermott slams his hands on the steering wheel.  

“It’s a spike strip! It can stop cars at high speeds. How can’t it stop this god damn thing!” 

The beeping comes followed by a blood curdling scream.  

“Oh, my sweet Jesus.” 

He runs out of his vehicle and runs after what screamed. 

“I got it! Holy shit I got it!” 

A high-pitched yelping sound is heard as McDermott approaches.  

“Holy shit.” 

McDermott is standing in front of the thing. The audio that follows are the last spoken words of Officer McDermott. 

“It appears to be an animal? I can’t tell, it’s too big to be anything I’ve seen before. All black covered in fur? I think? I don’t know.” 

A yelp comes out of the creature. Then a second voice is heard. 

“I-I’m hurt” 

“Oh lord, ma’am?” 

The woman (?) in front of him screamed. 

“You hurt me!” 

McDermott stayed silent and began to hyperventilate.  

“All I wanted was for you to join me, Parker.” 

A pause in the audio.  

“It’s you” 

“Parker, help me.” 

“What...what are you?” 

“I am what you seek Parker. The ‘thing’ on the road.” 

We hear the creaking and snapping of limbs, assuming the woman (?) stands before McDermott.    
“Come with me, Parker” 

“Holy...” 

“Take my hand and come with me” 

“I...I...” 

“Parker, please.” 

McDermott cocked his gun, and a low growl came from the woman.  

“Don’t do that Parker” 

“I have too...” 

The woman screamed again, distorting the audio file. What we hear next is the screams of Officer McDermott. He’s screaming and crying for help and for God. The wet sounds of skin ripped, the low snarls of the woman are heard as she tears into him. His gurgled screams are drowned out by the snapping of his rib cage. The screaming stops, and the rustling of him being picked up, causes him to drop the audio recorder. The woman grunts and yelps as she takes McDermotts body. The recording continues for hours until it ultimately cuts off when the storage fills up. Officer McDermotts' body was never found. The police investigation is still open. Officer Cooper is now stationed on Highway 19.
