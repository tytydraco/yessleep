First of all I would like to say I decided to share my story after I seeked help (in my late twenties/ close to 30) Most of this story ranges from age 16-22-- this is very compacted and lacking details.

I went to a very small highschool where there was a lot of upper-class families (I was not one of them), but I started dating a guy who was. He at the time was undiagnosed with mental health issues, would have outbursts, was controlling and would throw tantrums. I was only a teenager and had no clue what I was doing. After a instance that happened on a school trip with outbursts, sending 100+ texts a day, cussing me out and my ex cheating on me, I went to guidance counselors/ VP of the school for help. My ex being of a more wealthy family, I was manipulated by the highschool staff by them telling me if they were in my shoes they would also be mad and "punch someone in the face" and basically acted like it was the mature thing to turn my head and pretend like nothing happened (the school already had a lot of legal issues). This delayed me from ending the relationship for 2 years and it was non-stop emotional and eventually physical/sexual abuse. I waited until graduating high school and moving into the dorms to break up with them- I was 18, almost 19. 

Me being unhealthy immediately clung myself to a situationship that was the exact opposite of them that I met at our college orientation. This relationship was my freshman year and was on and off, they did not care for me at the time and I thought texting a lot was healthy (no it wasn't). Throughout 6 months of it my ex was reaching out to people to screenshot my profile activities. Making fake accounts, call from fake numbers and having mutual friends give him updates. He even freaked out at one of our friends saying it was my fault he got suicidal. He started in-person stalking my new (no longer) friend group and would try to enter my dorm but was denied access and tracked. He even shoved the guy I was seeing  in a building on campus. I got a job at my college and all my friends in security knew of him. Finally I threatened a restraining order and they left me alone. Years later he reached out with a letter (left at my parents) on how he seemed treatment and was sorry. As for the situationship, the guy was on tinder the whole time we were together, kept giving me hope thay we would date and then left me for a girl he worked with over summer... not much there 


Good news after 4 months I met my now healthy partner and we have been together for 7+ years 

you think that's the ending but nope.COVID happend: I was 20 (almost 21) years old

I move in with a girl I previously lived with 3 other roommates. I worked a lot and was in classes my freshman year. We had bickering before but nothing out of the ordinary (so I thought until I remembered her drunk). Well she would white-lie constantly. Make up stories, stalk her ex best friend and get weirdly jealous. Me and this girl only knew eachother for 2 years when moving in but she studied abroad and I didn't see her for a year. She also was still friends with the ex-situationship I saw (who really hurt me, even though i was toxic about it). This girl obsessed about weddings and would make pinterest boards for her wedding when she wasn't even dating anyone and talk to me about being my maid of honor..... well fast forward all that crazy shit, 8 months living together in lock down, a physical altercation where she attacked me for saying no to 40 people coming over in our small apartment on her bday. I find out a month later (tension is still high)she soft-hooked up with my ex-situatuonship and lied to me saying he came on to her drunk. - she got kicked out after all of this took place

 (I'm almost 22 years old)  I already am a toxic mess letting in toxic people with my patterns, my partner -- wanted nothing to do with it and supported me but never hung out with these people and very much was the only reason I ended up healthy out of this domino effect. My childhood bestfriend moves in with me (thank god). We lived together for over an year and we're still best friends.

During living with my best friend (still covid) I was hurt and everything felt out of control from these situations....so I started stalking the ex-roommate and situationship.

Why? : because control

I never got closure so I would go on their accounts, tik toks, spotify, I even looked into their exs. Anything to feel in control by knowing information, because I was scared of being hurt again. They never found out about any of it, it wasn't to hurt anyone but feel control. I hid the stalking from my partner. I was so ashamed. We finally moved in together after years of dating, I was in therapy, got a car and a new job, finished school. I was still obsessed at times whenever something felt out of control I would internally spiral. I obsessed with justice, had lack of closure and only been exposed to so much toxic patterns with failed systems since I was 16. 

The worst part, I allowed a lot of it. 

I'm grateful to be where I am today and have gotten a lot of help. I wanted to share my story and hopefully have others dealing with patterns seek help. 





Disclaimer: I could write a series of books in more details of everything that happened. I sat years in therapy and still have so much to dive into. Sorry this is choppy, but it's what I'm currently willing to share.
