For context, my mom told this story to my sister and I for the first time when we were 21 and 22, well beyond the amount of time someone would want to tell their two kids a ghost story just to mess with them. Especially considering I'm not sure I even really believe in ghosts in the first place. Additionally, she was very serious when she told it to us. I have no doubt that these events all happened, at least in her perception, but I will leave it to you to decide what "actually happened."

When my sister was young, probably about five or six years old, we had just moved into a new house as a family. My sister was always good about sleeping by herself at night, which was ironic given how I myself was not, but regardless she gave our parents relatively little trouble sleeping by herself ever.

Except for on one night when she apparently had a particularly rough night falling asleep and went downstairs to my parents bedroom to ask my mom to come sleep with her in her bed, because as little kids tend to do, she got scared by something in the dark. Typical, right?

Well, my mom agrees and goes upstairs with her and lies down with her in the bed, holding her until she starts dozing off. My sister falls asleep quickly, but my mom is struggling to fall asleep. She said she also felt a bit of a creeped out sensation lying there, like someone was standing behind her watching them both, but she figured it was probably nothing and ignored it. After all, ghosts and the monsters under your bed arenâ€™t real, right? 

She laid awake there for about half an hour I think until to her relief dad gets in bed behind her, holding them both. That helps mom fall asleep, and they all pass out together in the bed.

The next morning my mom wakes up and dad isn't in bed with them anymore. That's fairly typical, my dad gets up super early to go to work most mornings and lets my mom sleep in. Usually he's extra quiet so he doesn't wake her up, so she thinks nothing of it until he gets home.

She asks him later that day when he gets back from work what time he came upstairs to sleep with them last night, as he was asleep when my sister first asked mom to come to bed with her. She also asks why he came up the stairs so quietly, as she didn't hear him at all until she felt him get into the bed.

Dad replies that he never left their bed, he slept by himself downstairs all night. He woke up wondering when my mom had gone upstairs that night, and figured he would just ask her when he got home.

And if it wasn't my dad that got in bed with my mom and sister that night, who was it?
