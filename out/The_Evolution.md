Scared and alone, I sit in the tree line, waiting for whatever fate this thing has in store for me. The silence is worse than its screams. Snow muffles the world, yet every breath I take feels too loud, too alive.

The not knowing terrifies me more than the creature itself.

I tell myself I could hide for months if I had to. I’ve rationed in harsher conditions. I’ve survived storms. But no storm watches you. No blizzard whispers your name in the dark.

The only people who knew we were out here were the soulless company that hired us—and our families. A faceless organization, contracts signed in sterile offices. No logo. No history. Just a paycheck too good to question.

The dotted line was the death of us, indirectly of course but no less guilty.

They knew. They had to. Why else send a team no one would miss to a harsh wilderness no one would dare to venture to?

A branch snaps nearby. My heart locks.

Then I hear it.

A whisper. My name, faint, strangled almost inhuman, as though torn from a throat that should no longer exist.

Everyone on my expedition is dead. Frozen faces, torn bodies, blood in the snow and only gore left in their place.

This voice isn’t theirs. Not anymore.

Was it mimicking them? Pulling their voices from a hat like magician? Torturing the air with their voices? The thought makes me sick, but worse—it makes sense.

It’s smart. Too smart.

I need to reach the bunker. one of the buildings marked on the map, sealed in our briefing packets with all other details blacked out. Out here in the open, the snow betrays every movement. I needed a distraction.

I drop my backpack. Supplies won’t matter if the monster gets me. Peeking around the tree, I spot it—something impossibly large, hunched, steaming breath spilling from a mouth too wide. I duck back. My body seizes.

Seconds pass. Nothing.

I risk another look. It’s gone but for how long?

It’s now or never.

I bolt toward the road almost hidden in the snow. Each step is a betrayal—the ground trembles as if the earth itself fears what follows. My heart is a drum, my ribs its prison.

It’s fast. Far too fast for its size.

I fall, snow swallowing me whole. The tremors close in on me.

I roll to face it, ready to meet my end with a bravery uncharacteristic for me—when a flare arcs across the sky, bright as a false sunrise.

The creature freezes. Turns. And leaves me for the fire.

Or maybe for its next meal.

Someone out there saved me.

For now.

Inside the bunker, time has rotted. Dust chokes broken desks, blood smears the walls in long, desperate strokes. The air smells of iron and mildew, this is not the stench i was expecting. No bodies. No bones. Just gore. Meat stripped of identity.

How has everything decayed so rapidly? 

I find a journal under collapsed shelving. Pages swollen from the damp. The words inside read like a confession.

The scientists here were chasing folly that has plagued men since ancient times. Ten years of failure hardened into madness. When sleep refused to bend, they bent instead. Dissidents fed to animals. Dead processed into rations. The research became hunger itself.

Their triumph was Subject Y. _The Evolution._ A bioreactor of flesh. Not man, not beast. Something carved to outlast us all.

And it escaped.

The shriek comes again, closer, bending the metal walls like reeds. Time to pray that i make it to the lab.

---

The lab doors hang rusted on their hinges. I slip through. Inside, shattered tanks ooze black residue. Teeth marks scar the glass. I know now—this was its womb.

I feel anger more than fear. My team. My friends. Gone because of arrogance and cowardice. Because humanity cannot leave limits alone.

A sudden swipe tears across my back. Heat and cold flood me. My vision tilts. My ears ring.

Horns. Black fur. Claws red with _me._

I run. Somehow, I run. It toys with me. It crushes my legs, drops me, waits, watching me crawl. The grin—it shouldn’t have a grin.

In desperation, I find a flare, spark it, hurl it down the opposite direction of the escape route i spotted in the shuffle. It takes the bait. I drag myself into a vent, each pull painting the metal with blood.

I felt it pull me, legs were dead but the rest of me came to life.

It was trying to prevent my escape.

It was no match for my survival instinct.

Light ahead. Hope.

It felt like 10 years had passed before i saw any way to escape this claustrophobic shaft.
Just as the madness of the dark nested its way into my psyche i notice the light again.

But when I emerge, my soul cracks.

I’m back where I began. This time near its nest. Bones stacked like architecture. The monster gnaws, gore dripping like candle wax.

Voices echo down the hall. Flashlights cut the dark. Soldiers. Too late.

I scream, warning them. My voice fractures.

The monster turns, but falters in its excitement. Its frame shudders. Its fur hangs loose. It is dying, rotting from within.
It had aged.

Far quicker than i expected, it was now a far cry from the indomitable subject Y i had met before crawling into the vent. 

A grenade rolls in. Light, fire, thunder. Soldiers storm with rifles and fire. Bullets punch holes through the beast. A shotgun blast splits it open.

It falls.

Relief drowns me—until I look down.

No legs. No waist. Just ruin.

The scream that leaves me is not mine. Not human.

The soldiers hear. One approaches, hesitant. His boot presses my chest.

And I remember.

I never escaped. I never crawled into the vent.
I died in this room, torn apart.

Everything after was the last flicker of a brain refusing to extinguish. A dream spun in the moment of death.

Memories flood my brain like a tsunami crashing upon shores.

I was ripped from the vent like weeds from a garden and thrown aside as such.

My final moments were of being thrown and crashing to this corner where i spotted yet another vent shaft. 

The brightness hits like a burning sun, and disorients me as much as looking at a solar flare with no glasses.

The contraption on this soldiers wrist gives me the date, 
20 years after my crew had landed in this godforsaken wilderness.

The realization hit me harder than subject Y ever could have.

Apathy hits me.

The cold takes me. Darkness.

And then—silence.
