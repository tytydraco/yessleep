[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1cb404k/im_snowed_in_part_1/)

It’s been two days since the night I last wrote. Luckily there was only an inch or so of new snow, but that didn’t subtract from the overabundance we already had. It was still bitter cold as well, so it looked like we would have this on the ground for a long time. 

Yesterday morning, after removing what little extra snow we received from our porch, I donned my snowshoes once more and hiked up our road towards our closest neighbors, an elderly couple I’ll call the Johnsons. Mrs. Johnson was my favorite teacher in elementary school, and her husband used to hold a position in the town offices. However, they were far past their youthful days and I was certain that very little had been done to remedy their situation thus far.

Upon reaching sight of their house, I realized the situation was worse than I’d originally suspected. Only the second storey of their house was above the snow, and I could make out a slight disturbance in the otherwise even snowfall in the yard that I assumed to be Mr. Johnson’s old truck. Luckily, the snow hadn’t reached their second-floor windows, and they saw me coming, slowly stumbling across the top of the snow with my shovel.

Mr. Johnson opened the window and assured me they were both alright and keeping warm despite the power outage on the road, and I glimpsed a fireplace in their bedroom, which made me sigh in relief that they wouldn’t freeze to death. I helped him slowly clamber out of the window and onto the porch roof after he insisted I let him help me clear their house out, if only a little bit. We got to work immediately, and by the time the sun was setting, we’d cleared a considerable amount. In spite of the frigid air, I was sweating significantly.

We sat on the porch roof for a moment, watching the sunset and taking a minute to breathe. Luckily I’d had the foresight to leave enough slow for him to get back into the house if we were unable to get the door out in time. 

“How’s the missus?” he asked me, breathing heavily and pulling his hat off. 

I shrugged. “Alright, I guess,” I replied. After unzipping my coat, I took a moment to stretch my arms out, grimacing as I strained against the dull ache that now pervaded my entire body. “We had some kind of experience with something yesterday. Shook her up quite a bit.”

Mr. Johnson was silent for a moment. “Bear or something?”

I shook my head. “Don’t think so. According to her it was much too tall. Killed one of our hens as well.”

He was on the side of my roof closer to my house, and as my words settled on him, he peered over to see if he could catch a glimpse of anything through the trees. I did the same.

“Too tall…” he repeated over and over again, blinking as he weighed the idea on his mind. His breath came in short, sporadic huffs and lingered visibly in the air. I remembered how cold it was and zipped my coat back up.

Motion caught in my peripheral and I looked over to see a nearly perfectly camouflaged dark shape in the trees. It was almost indiscernible, and if my senses weren’t already heightened with my wife’s story from the previous day, I would’ve dismissed it as shifting shadows in the rapidly lowering sun. 

My senses were heightened, however, and I realized it was near my house.

“What is *that*?” Mr. Johnson exclaimed, starting up from his seated position. I was already on my feet and collecting my hat and shovel.

“Probably what she was talking about,” I said, hurrying to pull on my snowshoes. 

“Good God, it *is* tall,” he continued, peering into the woods. For an old man, his eyesight was surprisingly sharp. His voice was quavering. “What is that thing?” 

I was already off the roof. “I’ll be back around as soon as possible,” I called back, partially running back toward my house and my wife. “Get back inside before you catch cold.”

I didn’t find out if he heeded my warning. The last time I looked back at him before turning and focusing on my trek back home, he was still standing on the roof, peering wide-eyed into the distance.

As I got closer to the house, there were less trees between me and our property, and I could make out a bit more of the shape near our house. It seemed to be moving out of the clearing of our yard and into the woods, and I caught a glimpse of just how big it truly was. It was dark, tall, and thin, but at the same time it seemed heavy and thickset. Maybe it was the low light, maybe it was the fact that it blended into the trees really well. The only thing I could really discern was its height, which was, very concerningly, well above the roof of our house.

I didn’t pay attention to much as I hurried inside to check on my wife. The house was quiet when I entered, but I made sure to shut the door and latch it, pushing a chair in front as well. After my mad dash to secure our only space of safety, I stood for a moment, listening for any signs of life.

I called out my wife’s name as I climbed the stairs, knowing she was probably in her previously designated hiding space, but received no response. Fearing the worst, I quickened my pace and tried to open the bedroom door, but it wouldn’t budge. She’d barricaded it from the inside.

“Honey, please open the door,” I said after a minute of trying to push whatever she’d shoved up against the door to protect herself. “You’re safe now. Whatever it was, it’s gone.”

Silence ensued for a brief moment before she replied. “Prove it’s really you.”

Two things struck me at first. One, she’d very clearly been crying and maybe still was. The second was that I had to prove myself to her even though I’d very clearly spoken and she knew my voice well.

“It’s me, your husband,” I said, playing along but slightly frustrated and confused.

“What’s our anniversary?” her voice hadn’t lost its quivering.

I sighed, rubbing my face. “June 14th. We’ve been married for about a year now.”

She still hesitated. “What’s our engagement anniversary?”

“January 2nd,” I replied in a perfect monotone. “Please just open the door.”

After a moment of silence, I heard her footsteps approach the door and then a struggle as she heaved something away from the door. It opened and she looked up at me, her eyes red from crying but also filled with a nearly inexplicable terror. 

I tried to manage a smile, tried to hide my own fears, but it faltered almost immediately as she collided into me, wrapping her arms around me and sobbing into my chest.

“It came back,” she repeated over and over in between breaths. I stood there for a minute, holding her close and trying to calm her down. After a short while, I guided her past the dresser she’d dragged in front of the door and onto the bed. I noticed the curtains were drawn, which was probably a good idea. However, the room was slowly getting darker. 

As she sat holding her knees to her chest, I lit some candles and placed them around the room so we’d have some light. “Just like our first date, right?” I quipped, trying to ease her mind slightly. She sniffed and rubbed her nose like a dejected child.

“A little bit,” she managed. “Except you’re not wearing that awful tie.”

I rolled my eyes as she laughed sadly, remembering my mistake that night. Walking over to the door, I briefly debated boarding some of the windows, but figured it wouldn’t be a good idea to leave her alone.

Instead, I pushed the dresser back in front of the door, making sure we still had access to the master bathroom, and clambered back onto the bed next to her. She shifted to lean on me, and we sat there for a minute, watching the candles flicker in the dim light.

“Why did you ask me to prove that it was really me?” I asked finally. 

I felt her tense up slowly and reached my other arm around her to calm her before she had a panic attack right there. After a moment, she replied. “I heard it talking.”

Every hair on my body stood up. “What?”

“It was *talking*. It didn’t really say anything, but it was *talking*.” I felt her shaking and unconsciously relaxed my grip slightly.

I was broken out of my stupor by a sudden coughing fit from my wife. I patted her on the back a couple times, still trying to grasp what she’d just said.

“My throat hurts,” she said, her voice quivering again.

As she looked up at me, I didn’t see the ever-present happiness of the woman I loved. Her sunny demeanor was replaced with that of a scared child, trying to make herself as small as possible and trying to hold in any more tears. I reached over to my side and opened my night table to pull out the bottle of medicine I had for such occasions before realizing it was nearly empty and there was barely a full dose left.

Nevertheless, I gave it to her and told her we were out and that I would have to venture into town and get some more for her tomorrow if her condition persisted.

“Please don’t,” she said after downing the medicine. “I’ll be fine, I promise.”

Another fit of coughing ensued. I rubbed her back as she took a moment to breathe. 

“I’ve got no choice, honey,” I said, holding her close again. “Look, as soon as I’m gone, just barricade the door and only come out when you hear me say our anniversary and however many dates I can recall relating to our relationship, okay?”

After some significant coaxing, she eventually relented and I blew out most of the candles so we could sleep. My phone is nearly dead (again), but it tells me that it’s barely 9 pm at the moment. Crazy how early it gets dark in winter, and speaking of winter, I’ve noticed it’s gotten significantly colder inside the house, likely due to the fact that I haven’t run the wood stove in a while due to our lack of firewood. I’ll start one tomorrow before I leave for the store.

She’s asleep beside me. Her breathing sounds labored, but she’s oddly serene. I gave her one of my pillows to prop her head up in order to avoid congestion in the hopes that I might not need to leave tomorrow, but I’m fairly certain I will regardless.

I took a peep out the curtains to make sure no more snow was falling. It wasn’t, but I couldn’t shake that feeling of a presence somewhere in the woods.

And this time, it *was* watching me.
