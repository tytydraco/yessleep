[Liam's perspective](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1elnfwj/someone_sent_me_photos_of_my_funeral_1/)

My brother has been using the same password for almost every account for years. It really wasn't that difficult to get in here. 

Now it's time for my side of the story.

--



As children, my brother and I weren't very close. He's three years older and when we were growing up, I always wanted to be like him. I did the same sports, listened to the same bands, and begged him to take me to every event he went to but it all only seemed to annoy him. In his eyes, I was a child, following his every step and making him look uncool in front of his friends.

But as we got older, that changed. He started seeing me as an actual person. Especially after he moved out. He'd invite me to his place when I was fed up with my parents because I was still living at home after high school. I called him crying after my boyfriend broke up with me and he talked to me until I was finally laughing again. He started becoming the big brother I'd always wanted.

Until yesterday, when everything suddenly changed. Now, I am afraid of my own brother and I don't know what to do. 

Liam showed up out of the blue. Something he's never done before. He's usually too busy with work to just stop by on a whim and when he visits, he always calls before. So I was pleasantly surprised but also a little worried when he was standing in the hallway that connects our rooms. 

He didn't seem happy at all to see me and kept pressing me about something he found in my room. My black dress. He seemed to get angry at the sight of it. And that triggered something in me that he couldn't have known about. Because it was the dress I was wearing to his funeral.

Well, not literally of course. My brother is alive. But lately, I kept having the same recurring dream. It started a few weeks ago, with no apparent reason. There was a service where a man who didn't know my brother was talking about what an astonishing but far too short life he lived. Then we went to the graveyard, where his gravestone was already prepared and a hole was dug up. I would be holding the teddy rabbit he once gifted me, digging my nails deep into the fake fur.

It was the same each time, and each time I'd wake up with my face drenched in tears.

So when I saw my brother at home, all I wanted was to hug him but he wasn't acting like my brother at all. He was standoffish and cold, all because of some dress that couldn't possibly mean anything to him.

I couldn't tell him that I'd put it there to throw it out because that dream had left me with a sick feeling each time. I didn't want to burden him or even scare him. So I made up an excuse and left him alone to start making dinner.

He even joined me later, apologized, and started acting more normal. At least that's what I thought until he told me he would be going upstairs for a nap.

I finished everything in the kitchen and set a timer for the food when I got this strange feeling. 

It felt like the temperature had suddenly dropped several degrees. I was just about to head to the living room when I noticed the sound of shallow breathing from behind me.

Slowly I turned my head and almost screamed when I noticed my brother peeking from behind the door frame.  

"Liam! God, you almost gave me a heart attack," I shouted. "I thought you were taking a nap." 

I put my hand on my chest, taking slow breaths to calm my heart. But my brother stayed silent, watching me with a joyless smile on his face. 

"What are you planning, little Emma?" He finally asked, moving closer toward me.

"What are you talking about?" 

"You gave me that knife earlier, what did you want me to do with it?" 

I didn't know how to answer that.

"Did you want me to cut my own wrists with it?"

He asked, his voice dropping. He was now standing right in front of me, looking at me through his lower lashes.

"Liam, what the hell?" I shrieked, trying to push him away with my palms but he grabbed my wrists and kept me in place.

"I'm just joking, Em. Don't we both like to joke?" 

With that, he let go of me and turned around.

Liam used to play pranks on me a lot when we were younger. There was a time when he was around fifteen and I was thirteen when he'd prank call the house with his cell when our parents weren't home talking in strange voices to scare me. He'd usually only stop when I started crying. It was messed up but that's what siblings do. They annoy each other.

But we're not teens anymore and he was really freaking me out. I even thought about calling my parents but there wasn't much they could do from so far away and I didn't want to worry them with something that was probably nothing.

So I went to the living room and watched some TV while the food was cooking in the oven. Those words he said about cutting his wrists kept repeating in my mind. Was it a threat or a cry for help? 

I fell asleep on the sofa, the image of the casket appearing in a dream, when I opened my eyes, a gasp escaped my lips. My heart skipped a beat when I noticed that Liam was sitting beside me. 

"Why are you crying?" He asked.

"Bad dream," I mumbled, rubbing my eyes with the backside of my hand.

I took a deep breath. Maybe it would help if I simply told him what was going on with me. That way he might back off from his strange act. Even when he was being an annoying brother, he would always snap out of it whenever I was actually in trouble. I held onto that, to the fact that my brother loved me and wouldn't want to see me distressed.

"Listen, there's something I need to tell you." I tried to swallow the lump in my throat. 

He draped one leg over the other and leaned his head on his fist, looking like a ridiculous caricature of a therapist. 

"I'm listening."

"I've been having this really terrible nightmare. At first, it was only now and then but now I see it every time I go to sleep. It's,-" I sighed. "a funeral."

At this, his eyes opened wide and he started smiling. *Actually* smiling at the word funeral. 

"*Your* funeral. I know it's crazy but I've been wondering whether my subconscious is trying to tell me something and seeing that you're now suddenly here and acting so off. I'm worried about you, Liam."

He nodded several times. 

"Well, there's quite an easy solution to your little pickle, isn't there?" His smile grew even wider. "You can't be at my funeral if you die first. And the gravestone said 2024 so I suppose we don't have much time." 

A bitter taste filled my mouth.

"What are you talking about? What gravestone?" 

"I know you're planning something. I'm not stupid," he started shouting but then he closed his eyes and formed his hands into tight fists. He loudly breathed out and when he spoke again, his voice was calm and collected. "I don't want Mum and Dad to come home to a bloodbath. You can do us both a favor and just leave. Leave and never come back."

With that last sentence in the air, he got up and left the room. I wondered if he knew that he had just ripped out my heart, leaving only emptiness inside me.

After I collected myself, I got into the car. I hadn't brought anything but my phone because I was too scared to go upstairs to my room. And there was still this sense of disbelief within me. This couldn't be my brother. He would never say anything like that. But whatever was going on with him, I knew he needed help. I just wasn't sure if I could give him the necessary kind. So I called my mother. I didn't tell her exactly what he said to me because that would have broken her heart but I told her to check up on him.

Then I drove to a friend's house to stay the night. The entire time my mind was on my brother though and my thoughts kept spiralling. Only after I talked to my mother again and she told me that he was fine and that he explained to her that he'd been stressed out, did I finally calm down a little. Before that, I'd even thought about calling the police to check up on him. I decided against it but kept checking every few minutes if he'd been online, just to make sure he was okay.

I kept it a secret from my friend and made up some excuses about having boy problems. I just didn't know how to explain what was going on with me and I was too ashamed to bring my brother down like that.

The following morning I got into my car, ready to face my brother when I suddenly got an incoming call. From Liam.

"Emma?" His voice sounded broken and distraught. "Emma, are you okay?"

"Yes.. I'm fine, Liam. How are you? What are you doing?" I tried to sound as normal as I possibly could because I knew that freaking out wouldn't help him.

There was a loud sigh on the other end.

"Not really," he nervously laughed. "I don't know what's going on. I don't know what my mind is doing to me. I'm sorry," he whispered.

"It's okay, Liam. You're okay. Just stay home, I'll be there soon and we can talk, okay?"

I heard papers shuffling in the background.

"I'm not home. I'm at the library."

"Library?"  

"Yeah, I've been here all morning. Emma, just listen to me, please. After you disappeared last night, Mum called me, worried about you. She mentioned someone named Ben so I went through your laptop but I couldn't find anyone with that name. I'm sorry, I was just really freaking out. But then I remembered something grandpa mentioned once before he passed away, about his son. *His* name was Ben. He was Mum's older brother. Even then I thought it was weird that she never mentioned him but grandpa was dying and it didn't feel like the right time to talk about it."

"Okay, wait, Liam, calm down. Mum had a brother? What is this all about?"

"He died, Emma. When he was my age. And he wasn't the only one. Our family tree is filled with people who died at a young age. This whole time I thought you were messing with me. But I believe there's something far more sinister going on."

Had my brother finally lost his mind or was there really more to it?

"Did you talk to Mum about this?" I asked.

"No. I don't trust her right now. I'm heading home now, can you meet me there? There's something I need to show you." For a minute there was silence between us. "Please, Emma. I don't want to hurt you."
