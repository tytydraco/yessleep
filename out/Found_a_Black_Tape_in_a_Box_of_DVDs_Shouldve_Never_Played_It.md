**3:03 a.m., Sept 13**

I woke up gasping. The room’s black. Not dark, but black. Like there’s no depth. No light. Like I’m floating in a fucking void.

I’m 100% sure I left the bedside lamp on. After everything lately? I *know* I left it on. But right now, nothing. No shadows. No shapes. Only my phone screen glowing. At least I know I’m not blind.

An odd smell is coming from somewhere: rotten and burnt. Like meat left too long in a microwave. Or skin.

Tried using the flashlight on my phone. Just this weak glow barely showing the edge of my blanket. I feel like I’m not even in my room. Like I’m on a slab floating in pitch black. 

Typing to stay sane.Typing to stay grounded.

Wait. Something just moved.

I can hear a noise. A growl. It’s coming toward me.   
Pressure. On the other side of the bed. Like the mattress dipped. I can *feel* it there.

The smell is thicker now. I still can’t see. Why is my throat burning so much? Stomach too. It feels like someone’s peeling my skin off.

I want to scream, but my mouth is dry.

It said my name. What the fuck?   
It knows my name. I can hear it say my name. 

Not exactly a whisper. But more…flat. Like a broken recording.  
I feel like it can see me. Even though I can’t see shit.

Fuck, it’s too close now. My leg zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz



**7:48 a.m., Sept 13**

I think I blacked out.

Just woke up. My head is pounding.

There’s a sharp pain running down my right leg. Feels raw. Throbbing. The sheets are wet. I think I pissed myself. 

Pulled the blanket back, and there were three gashes. Deep. Like claws. Whatever it was, it grabbed me. I remember the pain and then, black.

I read what I wrote last night. Don’t remember all of it. Just flashes. The smell. The weight beside me. That voice.

Day four now. I’m losing my mind. I don’t know if I’m hallucinating or if something is actually… in here. With me.

I stopped going out two days ago. The last time I tried, on the subway back to my apartment, I saw blood drops leaking from the ceiling. Thick, red, slow. The whole compartment reeked. No one else noticed. The blood ran down the walls. I ran when the doors opened.

I haven’t set foot outside since. But am I even safe here anymore, in my own room?

NO NO NO, keep your mind calm, Jenna. Stay focused. Don’t let it fuck with you. 

I should sleep. I’m getting drowsy again. Just one last thing, I think, all these are somehow connected to that fucking tape.



**2:10 p.m., Sept 13**

Up for half an hour. Ate cereal. Took a hot shower.. 

In the bathroom mirror, I noticed claw marks across my stomach. The ache from last night makes sense now. I called in sick again. I lied and said I had food poisoning, easier than explaining to anyone that something invisible grabbed me.

But I think I should tell someone. About this. For real.

Maybe Ruby. She might actually believe me.

Mom won’t. I can already hear the “you need sleep” speech.



**4:34 p.m., Sept 13**

I was going through that black tape again, and yes, I was right. Somehow, this tape is connected with my nightmares and hallucinations. The sound I heard last night was also there, in this tape. 

It’s from that weird collector lot I ordered off eBay. Supposed to be random DVDs and CDs. But this… black cassette was inside. No label. No case.

I hooked up my old miniDV deck and fed the cassette in.

At first, there was just noise. Then the pictures came. Hard cuts. A book. A barren field. A flower drying. Grass. A wooden cross—graveyard?— a group of people kneeling before something. 

The camera stopped cutting. A filthy room. A stone slab. A few people are standing around it. A girl lying naked across the stone, belly swollen. In the corner, an odd stone smeared with symbols.

Someone stepped into frame with a bowl, marking her belly. 

There was no dialogue. Then, A masked figure moved in front of her, blocking the camera. The girl’s legs kicked. When the figure shifted, a knife hung in their hand. Blood dripped. They had cut her. The bowl slid under the wound. Blood hit stone and spread slowly. I almost puked.

They didn’t dig deep. The masked one reached in with gloved fingers and took something I couldn’t see, held it up to the camera for one frame. Then they poured the blood over the marked stone. 

Here I heard the growl, the inhuman sound I heard last night

Then more random shots stitched together: faces with mouths stitched shut; chopped-off parts arranged in bowls; a room full of empty chairs; a doll; fire; so much fire; a building burning that looked like a church; a cross reversed against the smoke. Then all black.

So my initial thought was, this is an art project, probably an indie film. Found-footage cosplay. Like The Guinea Pig series or Blair Witch. 

But maybe I am wrong.

I messaged the seller about the black tape. He replied in five minutes: “I only listed DVDs/CDs. No cassette. Must’ve been packed by the store.” He sent a stamp from a pawn shop two towns over and said he’d “check with them.”



**7:32 p.m., Sept 13** 

Spent the evening triple-checking locks. Ordered my dinner and microwaved it. 

I’m not sleeping tonight. I know that now.

That fog, the drowsiness from last night—it’s crawling back. I can feel it in my head. Like, my thoughts are getting slower. Heavier.

I’ll drink coffee. Or tea. Just need to stay awake. And tomorrow, first thing—I’m calling Ruby. I’ll tell her everything. I don’t think anyone else would believe me anyway.



**9:17 p.m., Sept 13**

I don’t remember the last hour.

I think I somehow fell asleep on the couch again. 

The miniDV is in. That tape is playing on the TV. No idea when I set it up. Don’t remember turning anything on. And I can’t imagine why I’d want to watch it again.

I checked my phone. Still no reply from the eBay seller. His last message was about the pawn shop, and then nothing. Maybe he doesn’t know much about the tape either.

Or maybe he does and just won’t talk about it.

I think I should get rid of the cassette. 



**10:32 p.m., Sept 13**

I’m thinking of burning it.

I packed all the DVDs with that black tape. I don’t know what else to do, and I’m sure this is all because of that tape.

I am gonna try to burn these cassettes. I don’t care what it is. I don’t care what happens. This thing’s not staying here.

I’m going to text Ruby to come over. I don’t want to tell her everything right now, just “Can you come down?” Kinda text. Dont wanna sound all nuts, or freak her out, but I need someone here. *I need her.*



**11:57 a.m. Sept 13**

My right hand is blistered and raw. I didn’t even realize I was screaming until my throat went dry. The whole apartment smells like something cooked or burnt meat. 

There’s black liquid leaking from my hand. Not blood. It’s thicker, darker, like oil. It smells sweet, almost syrupy, and I don’t know if that makes it worse.

The stove’s still on. The tape I am holding is half-melted, dripping plastic. The counter’s splattered with soot. I think I was burning the tape… but I can’t remember when I started, or why I stopped. I don’t remember *anything* after lighting the match.

The kitchen’s quiet now—too quiet—but the floor’s a mess. There are wet footprints in front of me. Small. Bare. Shaped like a person’s, but the steps don’t stop at the tiles.

They go up. Up the wall. And then across the ceiling, perfectly spaced, like someone walking upside down. 

I followed them. Of course I did. I don’t even know why. They led me out of the kitchen, down the hallway, straight into my room. Right to my bed. And then—nothing. The last print stops there, like whatever was walking just *waited*.

There’s a sound outside now—the building’s fire alarm. I opened my door just enough to peek out, but the hallway It’s full of fog. 

I called Ruby. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely type. She picked up. She said she’s coming. God, I hope she’s fast.



**12:44 a.m. Sept 14**

I don’t remember lying down, but I’m naked now. The blanket’s on the floor, the lamp’s still flickering, and everything around me hums.

My stomach looks wrong. It’s swollen—tight, like it’s been filled with something. When I touch it, I can feel warmth under the skin. Movement.

There’s a mark there. Carved into me. Not deep enough to bleed, but it stings on touch. It’s the same one that was drawn on that girl’s stomach in the tape, right before they cut her open.

Am I going to die?

The black ooze from my hand is drying now, turning crusty, but the smell’s stronger. Sweet. Metallic. Like fruit and rust.

I heard something in the living room. I stood up, somehow, and walked over.

The tape’s in the player again. The one I *burned*. Half of it’s melted, edges curled, but it’s still spinning.

I can hear footsteps behind me now. Slow.  
I can *feel* almost it.  
I know if I turn around, I’ll see it.  
See *him*.

I think I should lie down again. Just for a second. Maybe if I rest, he’ll stop watching. He’s not angry anymore. I can feel that. He’s calm. Gentle. He loves me.

He just wants me to listen.

There’s music in the tape. A low rhythm under the static. It’s Comforting. I’ve been humming it without realizing.

My hand doesn’t hurt now. The black is gone. My skin looks new.

I think I know what he wants.  
A gift. Something that proves I trust him.

I have a knife in my hand.

He’s saying it’s okay. I should finish what *they* started, and the song, it is louder now, so beautiful I can’t breathe. I want to be part of it. I want to join him.

I should stop fighting it.
