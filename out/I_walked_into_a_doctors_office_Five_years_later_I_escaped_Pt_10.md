The door creaked open as I stood, my eyes wide in shock and fixed on Nichole. She had her gun. I was immensely thankful to see it this time. Neither of us moved like frozen effigies fearing the inevitable fire. The footsteps from the room beyond were soft – slow, measured. What is a chimera? My mind conjured images of the mythological creature but that couldn’t possibly be what she meant. The creature now roaming the living room was not a wild, ancient beast. It sounded human, and it was hunting for us. My heart – so frequently on the run – was back at a sprint. I feared it would soon give out. A horrible swooping feeling in my stomach made me slap my hand over my mouth, refusing to let that stupid reflex win. The faint sound of my hand striking my face may as well have been a scream. The footsteps stopped, and then the intruder did something utterly staggering. It called out to me.
“Liz! Hello?” it beckoned with a voice that was at once alien and eerily familiar. A face swam in my mind’s eye of the not-me that released me from that underground hell. It was still a husky, growling voice, but it seemed slightly more…human than before. It wasn’t her. This was a trick – something to lure me out. Nichole’s expression was stony, but her eyes betrayed the fear and confusion I felt. Then it spoke again.
“I’m not here to hurt. I’ve been helping. Photos. DVD. I sent,” it said, sounding breathless. “Been following. Keeping safe. My sister.”

Sister? Who is her sister? Did she mean me? Nichole? 

My mind was a beehive, ceaselessly buzzing with question after unanswered question. The footsteps started again, coming ever closer. Nichole raised the gun, ready to take aim. For some inexplicable reason, I waved her down and stepped directly in the way. I must have trusted whatever or whoever this was. I could barely justify it to myself. Nichole begrudgingly removed her finger from the trigger but did not lower her arm. I held my breath as the thing stepped through the open doorway from the living room into the kitchen. It – she – was mere feet from me. I almost laughed when I saw her in normal clothes. It was an errant, split-second reaction. I had only ever been able to imagine her in that tattered and stained hospital gown. I stifled the thought immediately. Her movements were more fluid and natural than they were in our first encounter. I felt a heavy sadness take over when she turned, finally, to face me. She did not come closer. Once she saw me, our eyes locked, and I saw hers fill with tears. Her expression was grim, sorrowful. Without thinking or deciding to act, my feet took me closer to her. I was not aware of moving until I was only an arm’s length away. Her mouth split into a goofy, genuine smile. She lumbered over the remaining space between us and pulled me into a bone crushing hug.

“Miss sister. So much. Be together. Always,” she attempted to whisper in my ear, but that was one skill she did not seem to have mastered. It was too loud in my ear, but that may also have been due to the preceding hours of silence. The hug was unbearably tight, but I somehow knew she wasn’t meaning to hurt me. She also did not seem to want to let me go. Nichole, still on high alert, walked up behind us, tapped the not-me on the arm with the barrel of the gun, and demanded her attention.

“Hey!” she shouted, her voice quavering. “Hey! Let Liz go. Who the fuck are you? How did you find this place?” The arms around me relaxed and the not-me gently pushed me away from herself. She then stepped between the gun and me.
“I am friend,” she told Nichole. “Liz is sister. Followed. From Liz home. From motel.” There was a strained, frustrated tone as she explained. It was like there was a disconnect between her brain and her mouth. The stilted way she spoke had the simplicity of a caveman, but it occurred to me in that moment that even though she sounded like an animal trained to speak, she was not actually stupid. There was a depth of emotion and the look of intelligence in her eyes I hadn’t seen until now. What had they done to her? Who was she before?

Nichole needed more convincing. A floorboard creaked behind the three of us, and we all jumped. Nichole’s whole body was tense – like someone strapped to a rocket and unsure when it would explode. She screamed at the boy now standing in the hall. “Fuck! Damnit, Aaron! I told you to stay in your room!”

He had the panicked and guilty look of a dog being scolded. He even whimpered, solidifying the image. He looked at my “sister” as if she were a wild, bloodthirsty bear. He started to say something, his mouth opening for a moment, but Nichole spoke before the words escaped him.
“Liz is not your fucking sister. I know WHAT you are,” she declared, every word filled with venom. She shifted her gaze to me, “Don’t trust this thing, Liz. She’s a killer.” Her accusation should have shocked me or scared me, but I already knew she was a killer. I had seen the bodies she left in her wake. I was still afraid, but not of what I thought she would do to me. The fear I felt was deeper, more sinister. I feared what she was – what they had made her. She was the perverse funhouse mirror image of myself. She was the monster I could have been – the monster I would have been if she had not saved me.

But did she really save me? They let me go. They had a tracker implanted in me. Did she know? Was she – is she still – playing her part? I believed her. I knew I shouldn’t, but there was a connection I couldn’t ignore. I was struggling to find words – any words – that fit this moment. I wanted Nichole to back off. I wanted to comfort the childlike boy cowering down the hall. I wanted desperately just to be able to sit the fuck down. But mostly, I wanted the not-me to give me the answers I had been burning to know. The time stretched seconds into centuries, no one willing to give an inch to the other. It was maddening. 

Finally, I spluttered out a rushed and nearly incoherent sentence, “Stop. All of you. Let’s just…Just… Let’s figure this out.” All eyes snapped to me. Nervously, I gestured for everyone to follow me back into the living room. I sat down on the couch. Nichole and the not-me followed my lead, though warily. The boy, Aaron, hovered uncertainly in the doorway. It was downright bizarre. The living room’s antiquated yet pristine décor stood in stark contrast to the three people now occupying it—each teetering on the edge of sanity.

Nichole had made the short walk from shadow into light, her gun still fixed on our intruder. I was beyond exhausted – every muscle screamed with an ache so deep that no amount of rest would restore me. My mind was bubbling over with adrenaline and fatigue, oscillating between clarity and confusion. One good push would send me reeling into a psychological void I might never escape, so I clung to the relative normalcy of this room as it were the only buoy in an unforgiving and stormy sea.

“Have question?” the not-me asked, pointing to me. “Have answer.” she added, pointing to herself. Of course I had questions! Thousands! Millions of questions! I looked at her, then Nichole. The first question that tumbled from me stemmed more out of a Southern girl’s upbringing than anything else. “What do I call you? I mean, your name?” As I said it, I wasn’t sure if she had a name, but also worried about the name she might say.

She sat in thought for a moment. I could see the wheels turning. This was a difficult question and clearly not one she expected me to ask. Eventually she replied, “Don’t know…what name… was. They…call me…E.A.L. 4. I call me…Elle.” I wasn’t sure if the name she gave was just referring to the letter, but I could hear the sadness in her croaking voice. 

Then another thought struck me. E.A.L.4. Elizabeth Anne LaFleur? Was that meant to be my initials? And the number 4? As if she was reading my mind, Elle held up her arm and drew my gaze to her wrist. She was still wearing the hospital band—faded, worn, and identical to the one I’d once had. Lafleur, Elizabeth. Admitted: February 6, 2019. And just beneath that, in small print: E.A.L.4.

Elle had given me something invaluable. I never noticed that print on my bracelet. The police had removed it and stored it in evidence the night I made my statement. If mine had a number…. I found myself praying that if it did, that it would be the number one. I needed to get that back, and there was only one person I could trust to help me. 

I had to call Mark.
