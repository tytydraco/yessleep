I just want to give a brief disclaimer before this starts. This all took place in a logging town with a population of just under ten thousand. I would be more specific, but I refuse to be responsible for whatever may happen to anyone trying to visit this place.

I've lived here my whole life and most of the residents felt like family to me. Especially two kids that I have known since preschool, Brandon and Jake. We had similar interests and spent pretty much every minute together.

It was just a couple of months before our graduation, but we weren't thinking about that. Our final class of the day was video production and we loved it because filmmaking had always been a shared passion of ours. From running the camera, to acting or editing, we loved it all. And it was time to start our final project.

"Quiet down, everybody!" Mr. Peterson said, everyone quickly coming to a silence. "Today you will be starting your final for this class. I am going to give you four weeks to complete it. One week to figure out what you want to do, and three weeks to shoot and edit! Any questions?"

I raise my hand and he points to me "Yes, Dylan, what was your question?"

"What can it be about?"

"Anything you find interesting honestly. As long as it is appropiate. I hope I can trust all of you to keep these PG."

He then proceeded to hand a paper out to the class, with the specifics on the project. It just had to be an hour long and include a few key things he was looking for. I think it just to show that we had actually been paying attention to him in class. Coming up with an idea was a lot harder than we had anticipated.

The first couple days of brain-storming accomplished nothing but waste time and gas. We had discussed all of the easier options, but nothing seemed to grab our attention. A few days later, an idea finally came to us while we were in my car.

"Why is this so hard?" Brandon whines. "Going with something easy feels like such a waste. This is like our dream project, guys!"

"I know, Jake! We all feel the same way, I just don't know what else to do, man. That documentary idea Jake had yesterday sounded pretty good." I say.

"I mean, yeah, it'll work. It's just going to be super boring.." Jake said, pausing for a second only to speak again. "What about a found footage film? Everyone likes a good scary movie nowadays, right?"

Are we even allowed to make a scary movie?"

"I don't think Mr. Peterson will mind, as long as we don't throw in any jump scares!" he joked.

"That sounds awesome!" I bet we're gonna be the only ones in class making a scary movie, too!" Brandon said, obviously excited.

"What are you thinking, Dylan? Do you like that idea?"

"I do. It sounds perfect! We just need a good location."

It was quiet for a bit before Brandon spoke again. "That'll probably be the hardest part. Let's each look up some spots tonight and see what we can find. Bring anything that looks good tomorrow."

I dropped them both off at home and made my way across town to my place.

It was a little crazy that we hadn't thought of this idea sooner. We spent most weekends at my place looking for a new scary movie to watch, and found footage happened to be our favorite genre.

It was close to eight o'clock when I finally got home, so I warmed up some leftovers and started looing into spots. I was really hoping the guys had better luck than me, because all I found was a little abandoned hunting cabin about ten miles outside of town that everybody already knew about. I was sure the guys wouldn't care for it, but I printed it anyways since I had nothing else.

This little house has always been a mystery in our town. It was apparently over two-hundred years old and has sat abandonded the last century or so, but no one really knows why. Everybody has a different story, but no one will dare step foot anywhere near it. If we were looking for a "haunted" place, this was probably our best option.

I didn't see them until lunch most days. The next day was a little different though, because none of us had gotten any food. We were all so wrapped up in this project that eating was the last thing on our minds.

"Did you guys find anything good?" Jake asks us excitedly before even greeting us. "Because if I'm being honest.."

"You didn't look anything up last night, did you?"

"I'm sorry! I got home and started gaming, and totally spaced!" he said, trying not to laugh. "Well? What do you got?"

"I found an old house in town that's been abandoned for awhile, but.. it's no asylum." said Brandon, a big fan of anything to do with an old, creepy institution.

I was hesitant to bring up mine since everyone in town already knew about it. But I decided I probably should since Brandon had the only other idea, and his looked less promising than mine.

"All I found was that really old hunting cabin outside of town. It isn't much, but I think we could make it work for this." I finally muttered. I pull the paper from my bag and hand it to them.

"Oh, yeah! I've heard of this place!" Brandon says excitedly, handing the paper to Jake after looking at it for a bit.

"Isn't it called like.. Hollow Point, or something?" Jake says, still looking at the paper.

"That's what everyone in town calls it, but I didn't see any mention of that name online. It just looks like a really old cabin up the mountain a bit."

"I remember hearing about this place when we were younger. It seemed like everybody had a story. Well, a story that someone told them atleast." he replied.

The bell rang. Jake handed the paper back to me and we made our seperate ways toward our next class.

I couldn't stop thinking about this place.

I spent the next couple classes jotting down any ideas that came to mind. I was so excited, and when last period finally came, I could tell the guys felt the same way.

"I am so ready to go check this place out!" Jake says, while doing a little dance.

"Yeah, I'm pumped, dude. This is going to be awesome!"

"You guys are welcome, by the way! If you recall, I was the one that came up with the found footage idea." Jake said jokingly.

"And I was the one that brought up Hollow Point, so you are welcome for that!"

Once we were out of school we all climbed into my car and started making our way to this spot, hoping to explore it a bit before the sun went down. I put the locations in my phone, it was just under twenty minutes away.

We were all hungry from skipping lunch, so we decided to stop at a little gas station along the way. We found what we wanted and made our way to the counter, talking about the cabin the whole time.

"Did you guys mention.. Hollow Point?" the old man asks, as he scans our items.

"Uhh.. yeah, we did. Have you heard of it?" I ask, not sure where this is going.

"Everybody in this town has heard of it! I just haven't heard that name in awhile. You kids.. weren't going up there, were yuh?"

"No, no! We.. just heard about it the other day and thought it sounded cool, is all." I lie, hoping he'll drop it so we can leave. I hold out a twenty dollar bill and he takes it.

"That's smart. I ain't ever heard anything good about that place. Seems like a portal to hell or something from the sounds of it!"

We grab our items and hear him shout "I've heard of cults! And demons! Stay away from there, yuh hear?" as we quickly made our way through the door.

We hopped into the car and began our journey to Hollow Point. I hadn't noticed before, but the last seven miles or so, were a dirt that ventured up the mountain. The sun hadn't even began to set yet so we decided it was safe. Imaptiently, Brandon started getting his camera ready.

"That was.. weird. I go into that store all the time, and I've never really heard that old guy talk before." Jake says, puzzled.

"I'm sure it's nothing. He seemed pretty crazy to me. He probably let all of those Hollow Point stories go to his head!" I say, only partially kidding.

"Yeah, maybe."

"So what's our story going to be?" said Brandon, trying to change the subject.

"What?" I asked, confused.

"You know, like a lady killed herself and her kids and now she haunts this place, or something?" Like, we have to have a story for the film."

"Jesus, dude!" I don't think it should be that gruesome for a school project!" I say with a laugh.

"I'm all ears if you got a better story."

"Can't we just use one of the many stories we heard growing up?"

"Like what? Do you remember any? Because I sure as hell don't."

And he was right, it was hard to recall stories. If I'm being honest, people haven't really talked about it much since we were younger. Concentrating, I searched the depths of my mind for any story I had on Hollow Point. None came to mind.

It was quiet for a bit. We were just a few minutes away now and the only noise in the car was the faint sound of rock music quietly playing over the radio, and Brandon occasionally pressing buttons on his camera.

"Let's just do a serial killer story or something, with a little shack like this." I blurt out, breaking the silence. The cabin came into view just seconds after I said that and the three of us looked at each other, knowing we had a good location. This was all coming together so nicely. Now all that was left, was our favorite part - the production.

The little house was about fifty feet from the car, with nothing but tall weeds between us. So, I decided to just park it right there on the road. I didn't think anyone would mind. We grabbed our equipment and got extra batteries, water, and some snacks from the trunk, and made our way through the unkempt land. As we got closer, it started to look worse and worse. Small details hidden behind tall weeds like broken windows, moss and spots where the wood had begun to rot away came into view. In hindsight, it was a death trap but we thought it was perfect.

We got up to the house all noticed something, almost in unison. On the front door in black ink was a circle of symbols. I say symbols because there was no way these things were letters or numbers.

"Woah, what the hell is that you guys?" Brandon shouts.

"Dude relax, it's probably just some kids. Some of them will graffiti anything, they think it makes them look tough or something." I quickly say trying to calm him down.

Brandon takes a deep breath in, follow by a sharp exhale. "Yeah, you're probably right. It just surprised me, I guess." he said, realizing he may have overreacted.

And like a brick wall, an odor of what smelled like bodies baking in the sun hit us in the face as we entered the small cabin. It was putrid. I don't know how we couldn't smell it from outside. I've smelled shit and vomit before, but nothing even close to whatever this was.

Jake whips around and steps outside, emptying the contents of his stomach just outside the door. Brandon right behind him. I follow them outside to get some fresh air, and to see if either of them wanted some water. They rinsed their mouths out, drank a bit and were ready to go a few minutes later. The door being wide open helped with the smell, but it was still nearly unbearable.

"Dude, is this project even worth hanging out in that shit smell for a few hours?" Jake said, as he noticed I was heading back in.

"Did you want to shoot in that eight-by-eight-foot shed Brandon found in town? Because I think this is a far better option." I stare at them waiting for a response. Eventually, they both gestured to me that they agreed.

We took a second to gather ourselves and started making our way inside. "Wait, what's the story going to be? Have you thought of a name for this guy yet? All of that would probably help if we actually wanted to shoot anything today." Jake said, just behind me.

I stop in my tracks, one foot in the doorway and let out a sigh. The three of us stand there, looking at each other hoping the other one had an answer so we could just start recording already.

After a minute or so, Brandon speaks up. "We could do something like.. The Butcher? I think the class will like it."

"The Butcher it is then! And we could say that he like.. brought people out here and cut them up with a butcher knife and him and his victims haunt this place!" Jake replied, ready to get things going. We all agree that the story will work and proceed inside.

The place had obviously been abandoned for quite some time. It had a tiny kitchen in one corner, with a small bed across from it. In the last one, a small fireplace that looked like it hadn't been used in decades. And at the center of all of it was a giant bear-skin rug. A thick layer of dust lay on every single inch, showing no sign of recent life.

After a minute or two of processing what we were looking at, Jake spoke. "That bear rug is pretty sweet. You think it's real?"

I turn to look at him, dumbfounded by the question. "No, I think he bought it." I say, sarcastically.

"Okay, shut up man. You can be nice about it."

"I'm sorry, but that was pretty dumb!" I say laughing.

Jake playfully shoved my arm. "Let's just find a good place to shoot this thing! I don't know how much sunlight we got left today."

We quickly agreed on who was going to do each role. Brandon was going to run the main camera, Jake was going to run the other camera and microphone, and I was going to be the host. Of the three, I was probably the most comfortable in front of the camera, so it was a no-brainer. We stepped right outside the cabin and closed the door. We figured this would be the best spot to setting for the start of our project.

"Are you ready to become a star?" Brandon says jokingly to me as he gets the camera ready. But he had to say it again because I didn't notice the first time, I was too busy thinking of what I was going to say. I mean, this whole thing was improvised after all. It took them a few minutes to set up, and by the time they were ready, I also felt like I was prepared to start.

They both got into position and assured me that they were ready. Feeling confident in myself, I gave them a thumbs up. "Five, four.." Brandon says, followed by a count down on his hand, while he mouthed the rest. And then it was time. He mouthed "action" and signaled with his hand that we were rolling.

"Good afternoon, ladies and gentleman!" Welcome to the first episode of Paranormal Pioneers! I am Dylan, and I will be your host. Today we are at Hollow Point, small cabin just outside of \[REDACTED\]. It was said to be home of the famous Butcher! He was a crazed serial killer that would chop up his victims with a large butcher knife. And it is said that the ghosts of him and his victims still linger here today!"

Brandon signed at me that he was satisfied with the take and put the camera down at his side.

"Paranormal Pioneers? Freaking genius, man! It almost sounds like a kids show!" he jokes, trying not to laugh.

"Well you guys weren't much help! Besides, I've seen shows on TV with worse titles!"

Brandon was getting tired so we decided to call it a day, and I knew it was almost dinner time because my noisy stomach kept reminding me. It turns out you're pretty hungry when you're running on gas station snacks and a thirty-two ounce of Mountain Dew.

I dropped them both off and made my way home. When I got there, I did what I did most nights. I reheated some leftovers, and found a good movie to watch. I really looked forward to time with my friends, because I wasn't a big fan of my home life. My father left a long time ago, so it's just my mother and I, and she works a lot so I don't get to see her very often, and when I did she was probably sleeping.

I went to school the next day, but honestly don't recall anything. I was completely consumed by this project. The final bell of the day rang and we hurried out to the parking lot.

"I thought you said you were fast?" Brandon jokes as he takes off running towards my car.

"I am! Your mom just insisted that I slow down a bit, you know, for her pleasure!" I say with a laugh as I get to my car.

We climb in and made our way to the house, talking about the ideas we each had came up with. We arrived and grabbed everything we thought necessary from the car. As we got closer to the front of the house, I noticed something, something that wasn't there yesterday. And it was definitely man-made. I pointed it out to the guys, because it didn't look like they had noticed it.

"Okay, dude. What the hell? Are we going to find something weird every time we could out here?" Jake says, worried.

"What is that thing?" Brandon asks.

Jake grabs the small item, pulling it from where it hung to get a better look.

"Are you sure you should be touching that thing?" I asked.

"I think I can handle it. It looks like something my little sisters would make."

He was right. It was a small circle made of sticks, about six inches in diameter. In the center was a symbol made of small animal bones. I really hope they were from an animal, at least. Everything was tied together with long strands of black hair. And the weirdest part was that the symbol in the middle, was identical to some of the symbols we had seen on the door.

The very idea of this thing and the person who might've made it, sent a shiver down my spine. Were we unknowingly trespassing on someone's land? Was this a warning? But my friends and I obviously didn't feel the same way.

"Are we really going to let this thing slow us down?" Jake drops it on the ground, crushing it under his foot. "Besides, like you said, were close to town so I'm sure kids are coming over here doing this, just trying to scare someone."

"Yeah... okay. You're probably right." I say, trying to convince myself that nothing was wrong.

We brushed off the incident and decided to continue on.

As the guys got the cameras set up, I walked around looking for something interesting to use in the video. Something did catch my eye, but I don't think it was going to do our project any good.
