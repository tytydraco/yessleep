“We need to figure out our next move,” I say, breaking the silence. My eyes scan the faces of my squad. Despite their exhaustion, a resolve shines through.

Văn, his usual abrasiveness softened by the gravity of the situation, nods. “We can’t go rushing into things. We need intel.”

Lâm interjects, “And then what? What can we possibly do? Do you expect us to take on the US Military?”

Before I can respond to Lâm, Tuyết approaches, her expression grim. Beside her is a frail woman, her eyes brimming with unshed tears. "This is Mrs. Hà," Tuyết introduces. "Her son, Lực, was taken by men dressed like the ones we've just fought."

Mrs. Hà's voice trembles as she speaks, her hands clasped tightly together as if holding onto hope itself.

"He's just a boy," she pleads, her voice breaking with emotion. "They came at dawn, took him... Please, you must help me find him!"

Mai, still visibly shaken, clings to her aunt's leg, her small frame trembling. Tuyết kneels down to her level, her voice a soothing whisper, trying to coax her niece into sharing what she saw. "It's okay, Mai. You're safe now. Can you tell us what happened to Lực?"

Her voice is barely above a whisper, her words fragmented by fear. "We were... we were fetching water... from the stream," she begins, her eyes darting around as if the memory itself could bring the terror back to life. "And then... then they came."

"Who came?" I press.

Through her sobs, Mai explains how they were ambushed. "A smiling man came... he grabbed Lực," she manages to say. "I hid... I hid behind the rocks. They didn't see me."

"Did you see where they took him, Mai?" I ask, keeping my voice gentle, not wanting to push her too hard.

Mai shakes her head, fresh tears brimming in her eyes. "No... I was scared. I stayed hidden until they were gone. I'm sorry..."

"It's okay sweetie. You were very brave." Tuyết pulls her niece into a tight embrace, her eyes meeting mine over the girl's head.

"Please, you must help me find him!" Mrs. Ha pleas.

"We'll do everything we can to find your son," Tuyet declares. "Won't we, Thanh?"

Lam furrows his brow, "How can we? We wouldn’t even know where to start.”

"He might know something," I say, gesturing to our captive.

We pull Wright into a nearby hut, surprisingly intact amid the ruins. Inside, the dim, tense air fills our lungs. We tie him securely to a chair. His head stoops forward, unconsciousness clinging to him like a shadow.

I find a bucket of water outside, the liquid cold and indifferent. I splash it over Wright's face, the shock of it cutting through his stupor. He jerks awake, sputtering, his eyes wild and unfocused until they settle on us. Even bound and captured, there's a defiance in his gaze, a smoldering ember of resistance.

The young commando jolts awake, coughing and spluttering, his eyes darting around wildly as he realizes his predicament.

Wright's initial reaction is pure instinct—a desperate yet futile attempt to free himself from the constraints that bind him to the wooden chair.

I position myself directly in front of him. My English is rough, pieced together from interactions with American advisors, and heavily skewed towards military jargon. But it's marginally the best.

"We can do this the easy way or the hard way.”

"You've made a huge fucking mistake," he spits out, his voice laced with venom.

“I’m not the one hogtied to a chair,” I retort.

Wright chuckles, a sound devoid of humor. "You think you're in control here? You have no idea what you're up against."

"Clue us in then," I press, my voice a low growl of barely restrained anger.

"You're playing with fire, boy," he sneers, the corners of his mouth twitching into a disdainful smirk.

I ignore his threat. "Where did your men take the village boy, Luc?"

"Go fuck yourself," he replies, the words dripping with contempt.

The moment hangs suspended, a standoff of wills. I reach for the pack of cigarettes tucked into my shirt pocket, drawing one out with deliberate slowness. The flick of the lighter casts a brief glow. I take a long drag, the smoke swirling in the air between us.

Exhaling slowly, I watch Wright's defiant gaze. Then, without warning, I press the burning cigarette against his exposed forearm. The smell of burning flesh mingles with the tobacco smoke.

"You'll have to do better than that," he gasps through gritted teeth.

I nod slightly towards my men, an unspoken understanding between soldiers.

Văn steps forward, a twisted grin spreading across his face. He casually adjusts the heavy ring on his finger.

Then, in a movement as swift as it is brutal, he drives his fist into the commando's jaw. The sound of impact is sickening. Blood splatters, and several teeth scatter across the floor.

The commando slumps in his chair, groaning.

"We can keep going," I tell him. "All night if we have to."

Wright coughs, a spatter of blood staining the dirt floor. He tries to laugh, a hoarse, grating sound that ends in a wince. "I ain’t saying shit to a bunch of peasants playing at soldiers."

“Your choice,” I say coldly.

Van, his patience frayed to its limits, lands another blow to Wright's midsection. The sound, a dull thud, echoes in the cramped space, mingling with the captive's ragged breaths. Wright doubles over as much as his bindings allow, a groan escaping his lips.

Lâm, usually the more composed of us, steps in with a calculated iciness. He delivers a kick to Wright's ribs, the dull thud echoing through the hut. The commando's body jerks, a sharp intake of breath the only indication of his pain.

I glance at Hùng, who's been standing back, a storm brewing in his young eyes.

"Hung, it's your turn," I say, my voice steady, but with an edge that leaves no room for argument.

“Me?” he asks sheepishly.

“No, your grandfather… Yes, you!” I say, irritated.

With a reluctant step forward, Hung raises his fist. His punch lands on Wright's shoulder, a half-hearted attempt that barely elicits a reaction from the commando.

I lock eyes with Hung, my gaze disapproving. "Harder," I instruct, my voice a mix of command and encouragement.

Hung's eyes flicker to me, a hint of irritation in their depths. He draws back his fist again, this time with a bit more force. The punch lands with a better sound, but still lacks conviction.

I glare at Hung, disappointment sharp in my eyes. "Is that all you've got? You hit like a bitch! Look at him! He's laughing at you!”

Something shifts in Hung's expression, a shadow passing over his features. The next moment, he's a blur of motion, his fist connecting with Wright's face with a force that has the chair rocking back. The sound of impact is sharp, definitive.

Hung doesn't stop there. Another punch, then another, each blow landing with increased ferocity. His pent-up rage, the frustration and fear of the past days, seem to fuel him. Wright is at Hung's mercy.

—

After an hour of relentless interrogation, Wright is bloodied and bruised, yet his defiance remains unbroken. His face is a mess of cuts and swelling, yet he manages to smirk through the pain, taunting us with a cruelty that chills the bone.

"You're just dogs, chasing after scraps. You have no idea what's coming for you." He spits in my face to add an extra layer of insult.

Something inside me snaps, the calculated restraint I've held onto evaporating. Without a word, my hand shoots out, clamping around Wright's throat with a grip tighter than iron. I drag him out of the hut, his legs scraping against the ground.

Tuyết intercepts me as I emerge into the dwindling light of day. "Did you get anything from him?" she asks, trying to catch my eyes.

I don't answer, my mind racing, consumed by a singular thought. "Where's Mrs. Thảo?" I ask, my voice rough, almost unrecognizable to my own ears.

Tuyết hesitates, her eyes searching mine for a moment before she nods, understanding the urgency in my voice. She leads the way through the devastated hamlet, past huts that are little more than charred skeletons of what they once were.

She guides me to a structure on the outskirts of the hamlet, its silhouette ominous against the fading light.

The interior of the structure is dimly lit by a single oil lamp, casting long shadows that dance along the walls.

The air is thick, suffocating, laced with the iron scent of blood that clings to the back of my throat. The floor is stained dark, a patchwork of dried blood. Chains hang from the ceiling.

In the corner, a collection of tools lies scattered on a wooden table—knives, pliers, a hammer with a handle worn from use.

We walk past the grim aftermath of today’s massacre. The bodies of victims lay side by side, their lifeless eyes staring into nothingness, each face etched with the terror of their last moments.

Beyond the human tragedy, a row of slaughtered pigs hangs from meat hooks, their carcasses gutted and lifeless.

As I move past the pigs, a sudden sound halts me in my tracks—a shuffling, a soft, wet dragging. My heart pounds against my ribs, each beat a thunderous echo in the oppressive silence. I raise my flashlight, its beam slicing through the darkness, searching for the source of the movement.

And then I see her.

Dangling from a hook among the pigs is Mrs. Thao, her body a horror show of gaping bullet wounds and torn flesh.

Her head snaps to attention at our presence, the chains that bind her to the hook rattling in a sinister melody. Her mouth opens wide, revealing a maw of broken teeth and blackened gums, eager to rend and tear.

I turn back to Wright, my expression hardened by the horrors I've witnessed.

"Do you even know their names?" I ask him, my voice steady despite the rage boiling inside me. "The people you've terrorized, the lives you've destroyed. Do they mean anything to you?"

I turn to Tuyết, signaling her to step closer. "Tell him their names."

Tuyết swallows hard, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. She begins, her voice steady but filled with a profound sadness.

"This is Nguyễn Ngọc Lan, mother of three. She was trying to protect her children when your men gunned her down." Her voice breaks, but she presses on.

"Phạm Minh Khoa, just seven years old. He was hiding in the rice paddy, too scared to cry out. You found him anyway."

"Here are Lê Gia Bảo and his little sister Quỳnh Đào. Bao was teaching Quynh how to read when your helicopters first appeared. They never had a chance to run."

Bùi Hòa Bình, he survived wars and famines. He died standing up for my sister."

Ending with Mrs. Thao, Tuyết's voice is a whisper, laden with grief. "And Trần Thảo Vy. She made the best bánh xèo in the village. Now, look at her."

I step closer to Wright, my voice low but filled with an intensity that commands attention. "You did this. Every name she mentioned, every life you've ruined, it's on you and your men."

My men, sensing the shift in my intentions, grasp Wright firmly, pinning him against his chair. Their grips are ironclad, allowing no room for resistance. The commando's eyes flicker with a hint of fear for the first time, a realization dawning that his situation has taken a darker turn.

I approach Mrs. Thao, her undead form bound by the chains that dangle from the ceiling. The twisted parody of life that animates her now is a horror beyond words.

With a deep breath, I grasp the chain above her, pulling her closer to Wright. Her movements become more frantic, the scent of living flesh driving her into a frenzy. Her chains rattle as she strains towards him, her hunger palpable.

"Yo, what the fuck are you doing, man?" Wright gasps, his voice cracking.

"Talk," I say, my voice cold and steady. "Tell us where they took the boy, or she starts eating. Feet first."

"You can't be serious," Wright. stammers.

"Just try me," I respond, my tone ice-cold, betraying no hint of bluff. With deliberate slowness, I bring Mrs. Thao closer, her jaws snapping centimeters from his face, putrid drool dripping on his face. The commando's earlier defiance evaporates, replaced by a primal fear.

"Okay! Okay!" he gasps, desperation cracking his voice. "I'll talk. Just... just keep that thing away from me."

With a firm grip, I pull on the chain, drawing Mrs. Thảo back slightly, her gnashing teeth still snapping hungrily in the air.

"Start talking. Now," I press, my voice a razor's edge of urgency.

He swallows hard, his resolve crumbling under the weight of his predicament. "There's... a facility. Deep in the jungle. It's run by the CIA," he stammers, the words tumbling out in a rush.

"About 20 clicks northeast of here, by the Thu Bồn River. That's where they bring in… the subjects," he explains, the last word a whisper of horror.

"Subjects? What subjects?" I ask.

He hesitates, his gaze flickering to Mrs. Thao before returning to me. "Criminals. POWs. Villagers. Anyone they can grab. They're using them as test subjects for... their experiments."

I nod to Lâm, who quickly unfolds a topographical map on the ground in front of us. The creased map is smeared with dirt and stained with sweat.

I drag Wright's chair closer, positioning him over the map. "The base. Point it out," I demand.

With his arms bound and his body wracked with pain, Wright leans forward as much as the ropes allow, his nose hovering over the map. A droplet of blood, oozing from a gash on his forehead, falls, marking the map. The bloodstain blooms on the paper, a crimson mark that signifies our target.

"There," Wright whispers.

I scrutinize the marked area. "How do we bypass the base’s defenses?"

Wright shakes his head, a bitter laugh escaping his lips. "You don't get it. This place... it's not just guarded. It's designed to be a goddamn fortress. They've got perimeter patrols with shoot to kill orders, motion sensors, mines in the surrounding jungle.”

"Even the strongest fortress has weak points," I say, my voice low, as I pull Mrs. Thao closer to help jog his memory. Her snarls grow louder, more desperate.

“Wait! Wait!” Wright blurts out, panic edging his voice as he watches the undead form of Mrs. Thao inch closer, her teeth snapping in anticipation. "There might be... a way. But it's a long shot. A one in a million."

I hand the reins over to Hung, who tightens his grip on the chain, holding Mrs. Thao at bay. "Explain," I demand.

He swallows hard, his eyes darting between Mrs. Thao and me. "There's... a drainage system. Runs underneath the compound, empties into the river. They use it for... for runoff. Chemicals, waste. It's guarded, but not as heavily. Everyone's focused on the jungle."

"Where's the entrance?" I ask, my mind racing, trying to piece together a plan from the fragments he's offering.

Slowly, painstakingly, he nudges his head forward, indicating a spot on the map with the tip of his nose. "Here... The entrance is concealed. You'd miss it if you weren't looking for it."

"But even if you manage to sneak past the guards at the drainage system, what's inside the base is far worse," he adds, his voice a mix of fear and warning.

I lean in, my interest piqued. "What's inside?"

Wright shakes his head, a haunted look in his eyes. "I wasn't authorized to go into those areas. But I had to... dispose of the 'failed experiments.'"

His admission sends a chill down my spine. I press him for details, "What failed experiments?"

He shudders, closing his eyes as if to block out the memories. "Things... not human anymore. Some were dead, but not dead. Others... twisted, screaming. They were trying to weaponize them, use them against Charlie. But some... they couldn't control."

I stand up, processing the information. Around me, my companions exchange grave looks.

"Who is the Smiling Man?" I ask directly, my tone neutral yet firm.

Wright's confusion is evident as his brow furrows, clearly caught off guard by the question. It takes him a moment, but recognition slowly dawns in his eyes.

"I've only heard the name," he confesses, his voice a low murmur. "Never met the man. But they say... he's the brains behind this whole operation. Obsessed with perfecting Agent Indigo."

"Agent Indigo?" I echo. "What is that? Some kind of weapon?"

"Agent Indigo... it's not just a weapon. It's something worse," Wright says, his voice barely above a whisper. "Something that can bring back the dead. Make them... like her," he nods toward Mrs. Thao, his voice thick with revulsion.

I take a moment to reflect on what he said.

Wright's bloodshot eyes meet mine, a flicker of something resembling acceptance passing through them. "You gonna kill me now, boss?" His voice is devoid of its earlier bravado, replaced by a weary resignation.

I hold his gaze, the weight of his question heavy in the air between us. "If the roles were reversed, would you let me go?"

He laughs, a hollow sound that echoes off the walls of the hut. "Hell nah. I'd fill your ass with lead before you could take ten paces."

I nod, the grim truth of his words settling over us like a shroud. Even if I wanted to let him go, I couldn't. He'd warn the others we were coming. “Then, you know what I have to do.”

Wright's expression hardens, the reality of his situation fully dawning on him. He stares at the dirt floor, then back up at me. "Just make it quick then, bro. A bullet... right here." He tilts his head slightly, indicating a spot between his eyes, a grim acceptance in his gesture.

The room is thick with tension, the air punctuated by the incessant, guttural gnarls of Mrs. Thao. Each sound she makes is a reminder of the horror that Wright and his kind have unleashed upon us. The sound burrows deep, igniting a seething hatred that festers in my chest, a dark, burning rage that I can no longer contain.

"You know, in my culture, they say the dead don't rest," I tell him, my voice firm. "Not until justice has been served. Not until they've had their fill of vengeance."

I take the chain from Hùng, my hands steady despite the turmoil churning inside me. As I pull Mrs. Thảo closer to Wright, her movements grow more hectic, an anticipation in her snarls. Wright's defiant facade crumbles, giving way to raw, unmasked fear. His eyes, wide with terror, dart from Mrs. Thảo to me and back again, pleading silently for a mercy that's no longer mine to give. “No… please…”

With a steady hand, I release the chain, stepping back as Mrs. Thảo lunges forward. Wright's screams fill the hut, a symphony that cuts through the silence like a knife. Mrs. Thảo tears into him with a savage hunger, her teeth sinking deep into flesh and bone.

Without a word to each other, we turn our backs on the scene, stepping out of the hut into the fading light of day.

As I step outside, Wright's cries haunt the air. I try to detach, to distance myself from the horror unfolding just steps away. My feet carry me farther, yet his screams anchor me to that spot, a tether to the darkest depths.

My footsteps are heavy, each one echoing the pounding in my head, a rhythmic beat that I try to match by humming a tune, any melody that might drown out the cries.

The notes falter, die on my lips as Wright's cries take a turn, morphing into sobs. "Mom... please... help me," he gasps, the words slicing through the armor I've built around my heart.

It's too much. The line between justice and cruelty blurs, and I find myself staggering back towards the hut, propelled by a force I can't name. My hand finds the grip of my M16 as if of its own accord.

The sight that greets me is one of pure carnage. Mrs. Thảo, or what she's become, is hunched over Wright, her hands buried deep in his open abdomen. She's chewing on his entrails, pulling at the sinew and flesh with a gruesome eagerness. His eyes meet mine, a silent plea in their fading light.

I raise my weapon, my hands steady despite the chaos of my thoughts. With a breath that feels like it carries the weight of the world, I squeeze the trigger. The bullet finds its mark, piercing through his skull. The impact is instantaneous.

Mrs. Thao continues her macabre feast, oblivious to her meal’s death. My rifle shifts towards her, the sight aligned with her head. My finger hesitates on the trigger. I just don't have it in me to shoot her.

Then, without warning, a gunshot pierces the air, sharp and definitive. Mrs. Thảo's head explodes in a shower of viscous black fluid, her body slumping lifelessly atop Wright's.

I whirl around, my heart racing, to find Tuyết standing behind me, her rifle smoking. Tears carve tracks through the dirt and blood on her face.

The rifle slips from her fingers, clattering to the ground as her hands cover her face. I move towards her, closing the distance with a few, quick steps. Wrapping my arms around her, I pull her into a tight embrace.

She collapses against me, her body wracked with sobs. Her grief presses down on us both. "I couldn't let her... I couldn't..." she whispers between sobs.

“I know… I know…” I hush her, rocking her in my arms.
