I never thought I would be that person posting a creepy story online, but here we are. I need to get this out somewhere that isn’t my head because it barely feels real anymore, and I need the weirdness to stop growing.

It started with small stuff. I moved into an old duplex two months ago because rent was cheap and I liked the neighborhood. The place needed some work, which I expected—peeling paint, a squeaky back door, that kind of thing. There was an empty lot next door with weeds and a chain link fence. Other than that, the block was quiet. The people who live here leave you alone, and I liked that.

About a week after I moved in, I noticed a man standing across the street. He was there a lot. Not always at the same time, not doing much—just standing. He had a long coat even though it was warm, and he watched the houses, never reading, never on his phone. I thought maybe he was waiting for someone or had nowhere else to go. I stopped looking out the window as much, but I kept seeing him when I walked to my car or took the trash out.

Then I started to hear things. I would be in my kitchen making dinner and I’d hear someone humming low and badly from across the street. It sounded like a lullaby that had gone wrong. Once, I heard my name softly spoken outside my window. I froze. It was the middle of the day and there was no one out there except that man at the corner. I told myself I was being paranoid.

A few days later, a note was slid under my door. Just a scrap of notebook paper with my full name written neat and centered, nothing else. No handwriting quirks I could identify, no signature. I almost tossed it, but I kept it, because it felt important in that stupid irrational way. I considered calling the police, but what would I say? Someone put a blank note under my door? That is not a thing that by itself proves anything. So I taped it to the inside of a kitchen cabinet and pretended it was normal.

The man kept appearing. He started to be where I left for school buses, or where I took my trash out at night. He was always just far enough that I could not get a good look at his face. I began locking the deadbolt at night, even though I live on the second floor and the back door has a gate. I also started checking my windows before bed.

One morning, I found my toothbrush moved to a different cup. The toothpaste cap was off. I texted my mom and she said I was overreacting. I wanted to believe that. I scrubbed the sink until my hands hurt and told myself I had done it before bed absentmindedly. That night, I put a cheap baby monitor in my bedroom that streams to my phone. I wanted proof. I fell asleep with the phone under my pillow.

At two in the morning, the monitor pinged. There was a quiet clicking on the feed, like nails tapping on glass. I sat up and watched the live feed. Outside my bedroom window, at the top of the stairs that lead to the first floor, someone had left a scrap of paper taped to the banister. I unlocked the phone and leaned toward the window. The camera was shaky but I could make out the shape of that long coat.

I swallowed and opened the stairwell door. The note on the banister had two words: I SEE.

My hands shook and I threw the note in the trash. I thought about moving out. I thought about calling the cops again. I knew in my gut that if I made a scene, the man would vanish and then I would be left wondering if I had made it all up. I did nothing.

A week later, I found a voicemail on my phone. No number, just a recording. It was an old woman’s voice whispering my name like it was a secret and then saying a street I had only mentioned to one person. I replayed it until my phone’s battery died. The battery died twice in two days. I bought a pack of new batteries. They were dead out of the package.

Then the drawings started. At first it was scribbles on the backs of junk mail left on my porch. Then better ones. Small sketches of my living room from different angles, drawn as if someone had stood outside and looked in. One of them had the couch, the lamp, and an outline in the middle of the rug where my sleeping position usually is. Someone had drawn the rug and the exact scuff on the left arm of the couch that happened when I dropped my keys last month.

I began sleeping with the lamp on. I covered mirrors. I stopped going to the mailbox at night. I told myself none of it could be tied to that man for sure. People in the building downstairs must have weird hobbies. But every time I looked out, he would be across the street, watching.

Last night I woke up to a soft tapping at my window. Not the window I sleep facing, the smaller one near the kitchen. I looked through the peephole on the door and saw him standing in the street, head bent, looking at something in his hands. He lifted his head slowly and I caught his eyes in my peripheral vision. For the first time, I saw them clearly. They were gray and empty, like two polished stones.

When I opened my door a crack to yell, I found a new note pushed under my doorstep. It said, plain and neat: WHERE DO YOU SLEEP.

I am writing this because I will not stay another night in this apartment without telling someone, anyone. I packed a bag. I left it by the door as if I might leave. I have the baby monitor recording. The man is still across the street. I can see him, standing there with his shoulders moving like he is laughing to himself.

If anything happens to me, please remember my name. If I disappear, check the empty lot next door. I am going to try to get to my car without him noticing.

I will post what happens next. For now, text your friends a code word, tell someone where you sleep, and lock your doors twice. It sounds basic until you find a note that asks you where you sleep and you realize it is not a hypothetical question.
