I apologize in advance for this not being theatric, but it’s not a work of fiction, it’s based in reality.
I was abused as a child, severely so. My father was stationed in Iraq, and came home with PTSD. He beat on me and my mother, and she drowned herself in the bottle to stop the hurt, or that’s what I’d assume, I don’t know why else she’d drink so heavily. I’ve forgotten a lot, I believe I pushed it down deep in my psyche, in a box, in another box, in an old fridge, in a junkyard.
But he came back the other day.
I first saw him when I was about 7, maybe 8. I was staring out my window, bored, and I saw him for the first time. He was short, about three and a half feet tall, with long fingers, and bowed legs, he was also quite pudgy. He was halfway behind my neighbors bush in her front yard, at first I thought he was part of the bush, but he began to wave, that’s when I saw his fingers. They were impossibly long, even for a normal sized person. He was a person…
Then I saw he was crouching, or I thought he was, until he stopped waving, and began running, or should I say waddling, across the neighbors front yard and over the fence into their backyard. His legs were stuck like that. I didn’t see him for a while after that.
My next experience was different, I don’t think it was the little man.

A few months later, I was laying in bed, my blue sheets illuminated by the streetlight. I was playing, probably with Legos, when I saw a shadow creep across my curtains, but it looked less like a actual shadow, and more like a projection of a shadow walking across my curtain. I live on the second floor of my house, making this impossible. 7 year old me told my mother what happened, and she told me to stop making up stories. I saw the little man a few times in my life, but he never waved again, he just stared at me, waiting. About a year later, I saw a man walk into the bathroom, when I was in the shower. You can see shapes and shadows through the curtain of my shower. The issue is, this was a lean person, and (may I be frank) nobody in my house is thin, at least not back then. I never saw the person leave, just walk by, towards the toilet. I didn’t tell my mother again, I didn’t want to get in trouble for telling stories.

I began losing sleep, and (embarrassingly) wetting the bed. I had a doctors appointment, and he asked why I wet the bed, or if I knew why I did (I did not, looking back it may have been the apparitions) I told him it was from watching too many scary movies, and he recommended I didn’t watch them anymore. My dad knew I wasn’t scared of scary movies, and beat me for lying.

When I was 13, around the time my father and mother got divorced, the little man left for good, I haven’t seen him in YEARS, until a few days ago. People around me keep dying too, I never knew any of them well, the lady across the street with the little man in her yard, I knew her the best, was first. She was elderly, probably 70, and lived alone, I talked to her a few times, I remember selling her chocolates for a school fundraiser, and she paid extra, she was just kind and it was sad to see her go. Then, three days ago, the house behind us, a young man who also lived alone, passed away, medical examiner’s came and everything. My family horse, who my grandma had had for years (she grew up on a farm, but not with that horse) passed away too. And my 96 year old grandpa is the most recent to go, yesterday, before he died, he called my grandpa to tell him his wife (who’s been dead for years) had finally come home.

Last night, he returned, the little man. I saw him, outside the vacant house, the little old ladies. He was waving, with those 9 inch fingers, I don’t know if he was waving hello, or goodbye.
