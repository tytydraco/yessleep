I live a little over an hour away from my mom. I’m renting a house from her and she needs some house paperwork she got in the mail. I make this hike every week to spend some time with her as well. However, I quit my job last night… well. Technically three weeks ago for me. And it’s the morning after. I’m not gonna get into why I quit, as it’s not relevant. But I think the reason why this is happening is so I can continue to contemplate my life choice where I don’t waste any time. It sound stupid. Utterly ridiculous. But it’s my only source of comfort. 

Maybe I’m wrong though, and I fucked with someone I shouldn’t have spiritually and this is my punishment. 

It’s never ending though. I get on the interstate from the route 49 from Greenville, and I get on I-70 interstate and it’s straight forward. I go through Huber Heights, I’m in the left passing lane. I always pass the same Old Dominion semi truck. The license plate is for Franklin County Ohio. The same Chevy Equinox, from Darke County. And when I get into the middle lane, right as it splits into three lanes in Englewood, I pass another car in the far-far right lane from Montgomery County. 

I don’t know why it’s important to know the counties, but my eyes draw to them. Maybe it’s the boredom. But I always memorize it. 

I’ve tried to do different things. I’ve tried to get off in Huber Heights. Both exits. I’ve tried Springfield Enon. I’ve tried Xenia exit I’ve tried Springfield, South Charleston. I tried to get off at route 62. And I’ve tried pushing through, maybe I’ll get to Columbus eventually, maybe Dayton if I hit I-75 — But to no avail. I get jumped back to right where I started. 

Getting onto the on-ramp from route 49, a couple miles from Philipsburg. 

After a certain threshold it’s like the world rewinds. And it’s always in the same spot, right before my normal exit to get to my moms house. 

And before you ask. Yes. I’ve tried crossing the median to go home. I’ve even caused two accidents. But right on impact, I blink. And I’m right back to where I started. 

The weird thing though? My feed for my socials keep updating as if I’m not stuck in a loop. But in a weird way; because sure. My clock goes back too, but the only thing that changes is the posts made, but even though the content of the post is different every single time. It’s still always posted at the same time. 

And example: a twitter thread about Ukraine  can be posted at 2:30pm. But when my threshold hits. I check my twitter, and there is a 2:30pm post, but not about Ukraine, but about some novice YouTuber that no one cares about. It’s from the exact same person though. 

Hell, I’ve even struck up conversations with twitter threads in hope that maybe the notification would still be there, and the user simply deleted it. But nope. It’s like it never existed. 

I hope that makes sense. Maybe not. 

That’s why I’m posting this here. I have my drivers assist on in my car to help me stay in my lane as if it matters. 

I’ve read stories here about being stuck in a time loop before on here, and they’re interesting, if impossible. But now I know. It’s not impossible. It happens. 

I’m not too distraught about it though I guess. My YouTube feed updates for something new to watch, which is good. So I have entertainment. My gas tank is still full, my phone battery is fine. And all the stories I’ve read on here seem to get out of the loop eventually. 

But sometimes a thought does cross my mind. 

What about the ones that don’t make it out, and have been trapped for months? Years? Decades? 

My case seems super unorthodox though. Haven’t read one where they’ve had good access to internet. 

I call my mom. My roommate, and a few friends and it’s them saying the same thing. In short sentences. 

My mom: “hey. I’m busy right now I’ll call you back in a couple minutes.” Call ends. 

My roomate: “thanks for waking me up I was gonna be late if you didn’t. But I’m gonna hang up so I can get ready.” Call ends. 

And when I try to call back, the line is dead. I can’t hardly ever get a word in. 

I’ve tried not blinking, before you ask. But have you tried to not blink for an hour an ten minutes? Haha. 

I am hopeful though. 

I’ve tried to tuck and roll from the car to end my life, but the doors won’t budge, and the window doesn’t roll down all the way. So… that sucks. 

Anyways. I’ll give you an update if anything changes. Suggestions would be nice. Maybe some theories too? I’ll even welcome “Typical day in Ohio.” Jokes. 

I’m also giving you these locations because if post might not even stay up after I hit the threshold. I haven’t tried anything like this yet, so, I’m not too worried. Hell. Maybe someone will be driving down the same interstate and see me, and find a way to break the cycle. 

Thanks for reading, and I’ll definitely give an update. If there ever is one.
