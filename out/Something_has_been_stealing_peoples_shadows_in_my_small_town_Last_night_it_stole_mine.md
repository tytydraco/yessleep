I know how strange it sounds. I didn't believe it at first either, I mean really? Something stealing your shadow? That's just not how it works. Your body will always cast a shadow when there's light. Your shadow can't just disappear. Until it does.

The worst part is, once your shadow is stolen, you slowly become forgotten, invisible, until you too, disappear. This tiny town was home to over 3000 people. Since last week, that number has dropped to 2500. And no they didn't move out. We know they existed, we can remember talking to these people, we can remember doing things with them. But their names, how they look, how they speak, it all just slips your memory. You never see them again.

Me and my best friend, Adam, were talking about it yesterday after the uneventful new years eve. "But how do they know their shadows have been stolen? Why stolen? I mean how do you assume they were stolen if your shadow is suddenly gone? Can't it just disappear on it's own?" Adam was tumbling over his words, stuttering. But I understood what he meant.

" Yeah I get what you mean, it just doesn't make sense. If you suddenly notice that you don't have a shadow anymore, how will you assume it was stolen?" I replied to him, he nodded in understanding. "Yeah, how would you steal a shadow anyway?" He asked me. "I don't know man." I got up to get another beer from the fridge. "Getting beer?" Adam asked. 

"Yup!" I yelled back. "Grab me one aswell." He requests. I returned to the living room with two ice cold beers in hand. "Catch!" I tossed him one. "Cheers."

"I remember talking with my next door neighbor.. I forgot his name." Adam began saying, then stopped, seemingly in thought. "Well his name doesn't matter, point is, he said he felt as if he was being followed, watched, he'd see things move at the corner of his eyes." He continued, Adam looks a little frightened, and he isn't one to scare easy.

"He told me this after his shadow disappeared, like man I witnessed first hand, he had no shadow, scary shit."

I took a big sip of my beer. "Oh yeah I remember talking with that guy.. He uh.." For some reason I couldn't remember the details, I couldn't even figure out what I was trying to say, it was at the tip of my tongue. "Can't remember?" Adam asked in a serious tone. "No.." I replied in defeat. "That's how it is for everyone, we had over a hundred people report missing their shadows, and then a couple days later just disappear, almost completely forgotten." He told me. I gazed at him for a long moment. Memorizing his features, his hazel eyes, buzzed brown hair, lush eyebrows and his viking like beard that everyone loves and respects. Adam stood up."Gonna take a leak." He announced and walked off to the bathroom. I leaned back on the sofa, relaxing my limbs and closing my eyes.

I don't know how long I stayed like that but I eventually opened my eyes because I heard a noise, two taps, one after another. It came from the kitchen side, which is on the opposite side of the bathroom, so it couldn't have been Adam. I looked around the room, everything suddenly looked just a little darker, despite all the lights still being on. I shrugged it off mentally and decided to investigate the tapping sound.

I walked over to the kitchen, having this feeling of uneasiness. The hairs on my arms and legs standing. I felt like a pre teen scared of the dark, and after thinking of myself like that, I chuckled loudly and calmed down a little bit. I flicked on the light and looked around, nothing was out of place. Just as I flicked the light off however, I saw a shadow rapidly moving from one wall to another, before disappearing out of sight. I flicked the light switch on again, rubbing my eyes. Seeing nothing new, I turned off the light once more, and rapidly walked back over to the living room. I was definitely spooked. Adam still wasn't back, which was strange, nobody needs more than a minute to take a leak. So I started walking over to the bathroom.

Once I entered the hallway, I saw something dark and shadowy quickly leave from under the bathroom door and into one of the guest rooms. What the fuck? I quickened my pace and knocked on the bathroom door once I got there.

"You good in there?" I asked Adam. I heard some shuffling, and then the water running. Soon, the lock clicked and the door opened and Adam stepped out. "Woah, you scared me there, you need to go too?" He looked at me with a puzzled expression. "Did you not hear me knock?" I asked him. "Knock? No, you good? You look a little pale man." He asked with genuine concern. "Yeah, I do need to go actually, so if you'll excuse me." I brushed past him and he put his hands up in defeat, I closed the door behind me ans locked it.

I turned on the sink and splashed some water on my face. I was more drunk than I had thought. I looked in the mirror, and again saw something dark disappear as soon as my eyes landed on it. I rubbed my eyes and splashed more water on my face, washing it. Once I was done, i turned to the toilet and unzipped my pants, taking a long leak. I closed my eyes, like you do when its a long one. When I opened them I saw yet another shadow just rapidly leave my eyesight. It startled me and I stopped aiming, making a mess on the bathroom floor. I swore, beginning to clean it up. I instinctively checked for my shadow, and it was still there, I took a breath, not having realized that I was holding it.

My heart was pounding and I was shaking. I tried to laugh my fear off, but it wasn't helping, so I decided it was best to stay in Adams company. I finished up my business in the bathroom and quickly made my way back to the living room, seeing another shadow move as soon as I opened the bathroom door to leave.

"You good?" Adam asked me once I returned, still concerned.

"Yeah man." I followed his gaze to where my shadow should be, and it was there. I heard him chuckle. "Just checking." I chuckled as well, looking in his general direction when I realized something. I didn't see a shadow. "Stand up." I said in a commading voice. "Why? What's wrong?" Adam stood up, frantically looking around, until he saw it too. "What in the hell?" He said out loud, and at the same time, I heard something in the kitchen, like a whisper. I shushed Adam, who was now panicking, looking for his shadow. I listened in closer, there definitely were whispers coming from the kitchen.

I began tip toeing to the source of the sounds, and it grew louder, but not loud enough to make out what was being said, if it were words to begin with. "What?" Adam said behind me loudly, making me jump. I shushed him once more, a little louder this time, and listened in closer again. The whispers were gone. I flicked the light switch and there was nothing in the kitchen. I sighed loudly and looked back at Adam, who was pale. "Did you just notice it gone?" I asked him, beginning to walk back to the living room.

"I don't know man, what do I do? It's gone!" Adam was in full panic mode.

"Calm down, we don't know anything yet."

I looked around the living room, it was even darker than before. "Is it just me or is the light dimming more and more each moment?" I asked Adam, who looked around and nodded. "You're right." Just then, another shadow sped through the living room, coming from the direction of the kitchen, and going in the direction of the bathroom. "Did you.." I began saying, and Adam cut me off. "See the shadow? Yeah. Not the first one tonight."

For some reason I decided to look out the window, the curtains were drawn, but I could still see outside, and I saw it. A dark humanoid silhouette, just standing there. I pointed to it with my finger. "What the fuck?" Adam swore.

I glanced at the other windows. They too had dark humanoid silhouettes hiding behind the curtains. I heard another sound, a loud pair of footsteps, in the bathrooms direction, and simultaneously, a couple taps in the kitchen. Adam came closer to me, he was shaking.

I noticed a shadow peeking from the bathroom hallway, before it disappeared from view. "What do we do?" Adam asked me. "I don't fucking know." I swore under my breath. This was crazy, what were all these fucking shadows doing here?

Suddenly a loud crash came from somewhere above us and momentarily all lights flickered out, before coming back on. In that moment I saw multipke shadows racing through the living room. "They're gone!" Adam pointed with his finger to the windows. I looked around the living room, there were no more lurking or moving shadows. I Listened intently for any sounds. There were none. I sighed a sigh of relief. "Yeah, they're gone." Adam looked at me, grinning, seemingly having forgotten that his shadow was stolen. His grin turned into a frown, and his eyes turned to shock. "Your shadow..." He trailed off. I Looked behind me and to my horror, my shadow was gone.

"What the fuck?" I swore loudly. This reminded Adam of his shadow too. "How the hell did they disappear?" He asked.

We walked around the house, turning on all lights. Adam stayed over, and not wanting to sleep seperately, we bunkered down in the living room. Me on the sofa, and him in the couch. Our shadows didn't return in the morning. We tried to do some research, to figure out what the hell was going on, but we found nothing. We don't have a lot of time left. Which is why I'm making this post now, if you know what's happening, if you know what it was that took our shadows, or how to get them back. Please let me know. I don't want to disappear like this, and neither does Adam.

We're going to church in a couple minutes to consult our local pastor. Maybe he knows more.
