[Part 2 - Metal Sphere](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h8dedw/metal_sphere/)

Almost a month has passed since I watched my body live my life without me, controlled by some invisible, malicious entity. It somehow managed to excel in every aspect of my life better than I ever could—my job, my social interactions. It even managed to start a relationship with a woman named Alice.

Alice is a beautiful brunette with a petite frame. By day, she’s a receptionist; by night, a painter; and in her spare time, an avid outdoorswoman. She’s incredibly kind and outgoing—definitely out of my league. My shy personality would never have deserved or earned the affection of someone as precious as her. This thing better not hurt her.

As soon as Friday’s work hours ended, it decided to go on a date with Alice. After enjoying my favorite dish at my favorite Mexican restaurant, Alice invited it over to her place for coffee. I've seen this in movies—where "coffee" often leads to intimacy—but I’ve never experienced such closeness with anyone before. The thought of this thing losing my body’s virginity is both insulting and painful on so many levels.

This is the first time I’ve seen her place—a small farmhouse with a relatively large barn, 20 minutes out of town in the middle of nowhere. The late winter makes the surrounding fields barren and lifeless. The air seems colder here, the isolation almost suffocating.

When they entered her home after parking the car, it said, “This place is perfect.”

“I’m glad you like it,” Alice replied with a warm smile. “Usually, people are spooked out by how isolated it is. It doesn’t really spook me, but I can feel the emptiness when I’m alone. Especially since both of my brothers are on vacation in Japan right now—they’ve always wanted to go there.”

“Well. Make yourself at home. I’ll make coffee. Do you prefer milk and sugar?”

It stayed silent for a few seconds, then replied, “Surprise me.”

“Okay then,” she said, puzzled by its response. “Black it is.”

As she went to prepare coffee in the kitchen, it sneakily grabbed a small knife from the counter. The moment it did, however, Alice excused herself, saying she needed to get the coffee beans from another room. I don’t know if it noticed, but there was a mirror positioned near the coffee machine, giving me hope that she saw it grabbing the knife.

Alice returned to the kitchen a few minutes later, holding the coffee tin in one hand and asking it a question. “Why’d you take the knife?”

She did notice! But why didn’t she run? Why didn’t she call the cops? Wait, she has something behind her back.

“I was merely… admiring it,” it replied in a low voice.

“Admiring it?” she repeated, raising an eyebrow. Slowly, she revealed a revolver hidden behind her back. Her grip was steady, her eyes locked onto it.

“Fine. You caught me,” it said, its voice calm, almost amused. As it noticed Alice’s weapon, it slowly placed the knife back on the counter with its right hand. Something felt wrong, like it was smirking internally, hiding an ace up its sleeve.

Before she could react further, it raised its left hand. Alice’s body jolted upward as if pulled by invisible strings. She levitated a foot off the ground, her limbs jerking stiffly, the revolver trembling in her grip. She struggled to aim, but her arm seemed locked in place by some unseen force.

“Put me down!” she demanded, her voice cracking but defiant.

The entity tilted my head, my lips curling into a smile that wasn’t mine. “You’re an intriguing one, Alice. I underestimated you.”

Alice’s eyes darted to the counter, then to the mirror. Was she looking for an opening? Did she have a plan? Her breaths quickened, but her expression remained sharp, calculating.

“Whatever you are,” she said, her voice steadying, “you’re not going to win.”

For the first time, I felt a flicker of hope. Alice wasn’t backing down. She was fighting, and somehow, her resistance seemed to strain the entity. I could sense it—a momentary lapse, like a crack in its otherwise impenetrable control. But as the entity tightened its grip on her, I could only watch, powerless, praying she had the strength to endure.

And then, amidst my helplessness, something shifted. A faint tingle in my right arm. Was the entity so preoccupied with Alice that it was losing its grip on me? Tentatively, I focused on my hand, willed my fingers to move. To my astonishment, they obeyed. My hand trembled, weak and sluggish, but it was mine. The realization hit me like a lightning strike: I had a chance. I could fight back.

Summoning every ounce of courage, I reached for the knife it had set down moments ago. My movements were sluggish, like pushing through water, but I managed to grab the blade. With a silent, desperate resolve, I plunged it into my left arm. Pain seared through my body, but the entity screamed—an otherworldly, guttural sound that reverberated in my skull. For the first time, it faltered.
