I made my way to the main lifts at the shopping center, only to be greated by the same sheet of paper, on all the doors.

&#x200B;

'Out of Order, please use the spare lift located at" and then a location just around the corner.

&#x200B;

The lifts had been out for weeks at this point, i was wondering if or when they were going to be fixed, it was by no means a dead mall, being very popular around christmas time, but i heard rumours of a property developer with more money then brains who saw potential for a block of flats, i guess the lifts aren't worth fixing if some greedy pig is going to reduce the place to dust.

&#x200B;

I walked to the spare lift, why didn't i use the escalator? i don't know, i usually do, and i wish i did.

&#x200B;

A set of staff only doors were left open, leading into a dark industrial looking corridor, as i walked in, the sound of fluids running through pipes overhead became apparent, a shopping center is a living, breathing place, and here i was not only inside one, but inside it's guts.

&#x200B;

I looked around for a while, realizing that if i touched the wrong thing, i could get hurt, after peering into an eerie space behind the shops, i called up the service lift, half expecting it not to work.

&#x200B;

But it did, the doors rattled open to reveal a large dark space, i walked in, the metal floor resonating with every step.

&#x200B;

The interior was dark, the only thing not metal was the wood bars around the interior, a red glowing segment display above the door displayed the current floor, the control panel seemed understandable enough, but there were some odd switches, a large door beneath the control panel had a pictogram of a telephone on it.

&#x200B;

Without thinking i hit the button for my desired floor, the button lit and the doors closed, it was almost like going down in a dodgy submarine, it felt dark and disconnected from the outside world, strange and uncanny, it was the only lift that freaked me out.

&#x200B;

Suddenly the lift stopped abruptly, and the doors opened to yet more corridors, i saw the glowing red 'B' above the door and knew my mistake, i was in the basement.

&#x200B;

Again i hit the floor button, but a sound of electrical sparking was apparent, the lift died and some smoke came out of the panel, great, guess i'll use the emergency phone.

&#x200B;

I pull open the door for the phone, and i saw trailing wires, the phone was gone, ripped out no doubt by some ne'er du wel vandels.

&#x200B;

Great, that's the last thing i need, i thought as i stepped into the corridor and shouted some calls, none of which were answered, it was dark, there were pipes everywhere, i walked down, checking every door in search of some stairs or a lift i could use.

&#x200B;

After a few minutes of walking i realized this basement was quite big, i started trying to open doors, some of which were locked with key or keycard, one door was unlocked but wouldn't budge, i gave it a good shove only for it and me to be blown back by some huge industrial fan.

&#x200B;

Eventually i came across a door to an odd place, it opened into a square office, unfurnished, with yellow walls and carpet, the ceiling seemed strangely low and there were two more doors in this office, one on the left and one on the right.

&#x200B;

What is this? i thought, perhaps it was some employee rest area, but my thoughts were cut off as the right hand door swung open and a man walked out.

&#x200B;

'Who are you? do you work here?' i said

&#x200B;

He seemed confued at my question, saying he didn't work here but he was an 'explorer' and that he could help me get out of here.

&#x200B;

'An explorer of what? urban exploration?' i asked

&#x200B;

'No, of the ***Backrooms***' 

&#x200B;

That word, it echoed through my brain, i had heard it somewhere before, but wasn't sure where.

&#x200B;

'Yea' he said 'When you noclip out of reality, you end up in this series of rooms, some of which are inhabited by monsters'

&#x200B;

'But how the hell did you get here?' he asked

&#x200B;

'I just, uh took the spare lift at a shopping center'

&#x200B;

'Oh the lift trick, i ended up here when i walked through the wrong door at work, been hooked on exploring since'

&#x200B;

'If you get bad vibes about a lift, best to get away, it could be to the backrooms you know?'

&#x200B;

Without further questions we soon made our way through the left door, he said this was the way out, we found ourselves walking down some strange spaces, some werider then the rest, i got freaked out when we find our way into a dark basement with balloons around, like the night after a birthday party.

&#x200B;

'I know this level' he said 'Through this window here'

&#x200B;

As i climbed out of the window, i couldn't believe what i was seeing, the most typical of american suburban streets, a row of houses as far as the eye could see, people mowing, talking, even someone working on an old muscle car, but they all fake, none responded to you, nothing felt real, it was like a movie set, or a dream, and according to the guy, nothing here ever came to completion, the man working on the car would always be there, tightening a bolt that seemingly never got tighter, nor did the gardens being mowed become shorter.

&#x200B;

Down the street, even a group of firefighters fought a never ending, though never expanding garden fire.

&#x200B;

'This place is always stuck' he said 'But there's one thing we need to do, jump on the count of three'

&#x200B;

3.. 2.. 1... Jump!

&#x200B;

The ground below us suddenly departed, like we were in a rocket, we were going up, as we went higher and higher i could make out a vast network of streets below, interlinked with squares of green and grey.

&#x200B;

After a while the blue sky became black and soon were sorrounded by blackness, except for tiny little dots, like stars, all around, the suburban street had become of these stars, shining brightly below.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

'What is this place?' i said

&#x200B;

'This is the backrooms matrix, out of everything, of time, space, the lot, all these stars are a liminal space, you are moving at the moment but you can't feel it, when the universe knows you are here, it needs to set things right by putting you back in the overworld'

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As he said this, we sped up, like a spaceship going through a star field, i could make out some of the stars as rooms and corridors as they whizzed by, but one thing became apparent, a bright star in front of us becoming brighter.

&#x200B;

And as quick as it started, i was back, the guy telling me we were back in the overworld and that he entered 'through some mall in america' when i told him he was in england, he didn't seem surprised, one room in the backrooms can be on the other side of the world, i was apparently in austrailia when i walked into that werid office.

&#x200B;

But as i opened the door, this time on the right level, i realized the shopping center was closed, it was 10 PM, seven hours after i was supposed to leave, yet it only felt like 10 minutes.

&#x200B;

And as i walked back, i realized the guy was gone, out of nowhere, then i had to call the fire brigade to be let out of the car park, that was fun, not being able to explain how i got stuck.

&#x200B;

Shortly after that, the spare lift went Out of order too, wheelchair users were advised to wheel all the way to the otherside where a ramp was, and able people just told to use the escalators.

&#x200B;

Needless to say, if a lift feels strange, don't use it, take the stairs or escalator intead.
