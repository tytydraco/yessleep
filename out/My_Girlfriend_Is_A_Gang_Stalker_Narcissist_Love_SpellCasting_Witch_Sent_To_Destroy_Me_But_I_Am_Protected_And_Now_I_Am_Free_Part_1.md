When you talk about the spiritual battle happening in Earth Realm and running into well connected satanic cult mafia families, well, the story is going to be insane even if you get just 10% of the Hell that it is. Still, the lessons learned are worth the scars. One simply couldn´t make the truth up. The truth is simply unbelievable. There´s somethings you just don´t say, but people kind of know.  They just hope it isn´t true even though they know it is. We love to gaslight ourselves.

  This story is one I want to keep my distance from because the people involved are murderers and their ties cross lines into government, police, organized crime, ritual sacrifice and highly profitable international cartel businesses. On the front, it's all legitimate organizations and but behind some layered veils lays the occult, satanic influences, unreal thrist for power and cult bloodlines. The spiritual other world is very real.  Just talking about parts of it is dangerous... but it is even more dangerous to not talk about it. Remember what we are told ´be wise as serpants and kind as doves´.  In this world, if you are a sheep, that´s what you are. Nobody wants to be a sheep. Because sheep get taken advantage unless, in rare instances, they have a shepherd that truly loves them. You want to be be a wolf this world. As for us wolves, it´s a personal choice whether to be a good wolf or a bad wolf.  I want to remind that wolves are very loyal to their own pack and very loyal to their mate. It's good to be in a wolf pack. 

  
  This is a love story that involves witchcraft, lovespells, lovebombs and ultimately lies, deceit, betrayal, curses, ritual sacrifice and cold blooded murder. I will tell this story from the first person persepective but it did not happen to me. It happened to someone else, someone who listens to the Smoking Owl Tales youtube channel and wants to share the truth for those with ears to listen. In fact, this story is happening again and again. The names and places change, but the story stays the same. You might just recognize this story´s pattern from something you´ve seen in your life  ...your story.  This story is not connected to yours.  Even though it actually is. We're all connected.  This story takes place in two cities primarily, I will refer to these cities as Oz and Emerald City, which obviously are not their names. The part of the story that happens here is mostly in Oz. It's amazing how small the big world is when you start naming events and places. I want to stay 10 feet from this story and the dark forces involved.  So officially, this story is just some fiction that I made up. Your discernment will have an idea if that is fact.  There is truth in fiction and fiction in truth.  With this one, there is wisdom in entertainment or maybe entertainment in truth. That´s enough on that, this experience blew open the door of spirituality in my life. Even though I´ve had certain gifts the entire time. Now I know why I was targeted.  Here´s how it went down. 

&#x200B;

  
  I was living in Oz City. I got out of the gang world and had cleaned up my life.  My name is George, but people call me G.  That is definitely NOT my real name. I had gotten involved with some bad stuff.  Bad people. Bad stuff if you know what I mean. I thought about it all and realised where the road I was on lead to. I didn't want to arrive at that place. I managed to get out of the gang world, drug free and had started my own business. I was over two years clean when my business started to take off. I had to hire workers for all the contracts coming in. This is a few years back, 2018.  I don´t want to get into specifics, but I had a few employees and the numbers were good.  We were doing installations on commercial properties. I had achieved the financial success that I thought was impossible.  I made it.  Mostly.  I lacked the love that I wanted.  I thought I´d really be happy if I had a woman in my life to live in this success with.  With Tinder, Hinge, Insta and OnlyFans, dating is crazy now.  Did you know OnlyFans has 3 million ´content creators´ at the start of 2023. Not sure this is a plus for humanity. I wanted to find a woman that had her virture intact, to build something good, something wholesome together.   

  
  As part of cleaning up my life, I started to be a regular at a local church in Oz City.  The people were friendly and I looked forward to going and being part the community on Sunday mornings.  One time after the service, they offered prayer services. I asked to have a prayer said over me.  An older and kind gentleman put one hands on my shoulder and the other on my heart and prayed and said that like in Psalm 23, I will drink from the good water.  He said that I had a glow, and he could see it.  I felt amazing that morning.  And that is when I notice her looking at me.  She looked away in an awkward moment when I caught her just staring at me.  It was like she was waiting to get her turn to talk to me.  She wasn´t exactly my type, but almost exactly. She had an energy and enthusiasm about her and she just seemed to single me out in that big room with all those people.    

  
  ´Hi my name is Maria.´ She said.  ´I just love the music they sang here this morning.´ She said.  “Yeah”. I said.  I´m a traditional guy and usually like to start the talking with a girl, but I guess people are just so open and friendly in this setting. There is a level of trust. I mean, the bad girls who go clubbing on weekends and indulging in worship of their ephemeral beauty are probably home asleep with hangovers while this one is bright eyed and fresh for church at 10:30 on a Sunday morning. There´s a cafe as part of the building the church is in.  ´Want to try a chocolate croissant?´ They give them free to new attendees.  ´Is this your first time here?´ I asked.  ´No´ she said. “I try to be here every Sunday.”  Funny, I had been coming here for about 4 months and not seen her once.  “The chocolate croissants won´t be free for us, but let´s grab a couple.” She said.  We did. And they were good.  Maria was amazing.  She was a young beautiful woman who could have any man she chose.  And she just seemed to stare at me with puppy eyes.  She was a musician as I am.  This was a wonderful day.  But something was off.  She didn´t seem to know anyone there except me.  But I wanted to enjoy her company and not be weird or paranoid.    

  
  We started dating.  I wanted to move slow, but Maria seemed to want to rush things.  I´ve had my streak of crazy relationships, so I like to get to know who I am getting involved with.  My most toxic one would later pale in comparison to what was flowing down the river and into my life.  If I had any idea who Maria was, I would have ran as fast as I could.  For my safety, for my life and for my sanity.  It´s the perfect story, meeting a beautiful and brilliant woman at a church service on a sunny Sunday morning.  Maria claimed to have only dated a couple other men in her life, but she seemed to really know what she was doing when we were together.  I asked her once how she could be so satisfying and know what she was doing in between the sheets. And she wrote it off and said “its not that complicated”.  Now I know that she had targeted me.  Why? Because she could see my glow. When you got the glow, Satan comes or more likely sends his minions to try to derail you.  She saw that glow, which I didn´t understand at the time, but I do now. The glow. You dear listener might just know what I am talking about here. You probably have it too or know what it is. 

  
  This all turned out to be a big wake up call. But before I ever met Maria, I had always been different.  I know now that my family line carries a curse.  Most are aware of it, but we don´t talk about it. It´s one of those things that you hope will go away if you just don´t talk about it long enough. But things go the other direction. Holding back this secret while misunderstanding it just makes it like a volcanic eruption when the top finally blows the lid. The spiritual attack in the form of Maria was the passcode for blowing the lid off this volcano.  I know now that I have the glow.  Some call it chosen.  The being different that cursed me is actually a gift. I am a ´playable character´ in the Earth Realm game. And the gang stalkers, NPCs, trucker hitchhikers are all here to derail my mission. 

  
  I was born during a leap year, and it was strange because, aside from my own mother, two other women in my family had their babies that year.  It´s like they were trying to have babies that year.  I know now, that this was indeed the fact. I don´t want to say the year because that will reveal a personal datapoint about who I am. But it really was a leap year. This has significance.  You see, I can see the spirit world.  Everybody can to a degree, but so many don't understand their own powers.  The dark forces above don´t want the masses to understand their spirtitual power. Keeping the masses in the dark helps maintain control. Some will wake up during their lifetime, others will not.  Some awakened ones pretend they don´t see it.  There are sheep, wolves in sheep´s clothes and then there are those like me, just wolves.  The others in my family can see with their eyes too, but they hate me for my glow. I´ve had several near death experiences in my life.  Looking back, my own family was trying to off me.  But I just wouldn´t die.  Bad stuff happened. But I just kept on keeping on. And glowing. This is why Maria targeted me. She wanted the light for herself. It´s not love, it´s more like stealing. She doesn´t have the light so taking mine is like survival for her. She´s like a dark void that feeds on life energy, a real vampire. She is a witch from a long line of witches and warlocks. They wanted my life energy.  They say the devil wants your soul.  This is so true. But he wants so much more than just your soul. The devil wants your whole bloodline. 

  
  About my Near Death Experiences, I was poisoned as a child.  A television fell on me from above. I was injected with something. None of it worked.  I just wouldn´t die.  I couldn´t see it but somehow none of it worked on me.  There are things that can´t be explained with logic. They always treated me lesser.  My mother left my Dad when I was 10, not sure what that was about. There were demonic spirits all around. I could sense it. Somethings just happened and were not explained.  Things happened that I will just describe as “blasphemy against God” and leave it at that. Growing up, I was surrounded by family members and people who had sold their soul for powers, gifts and wealth.  The theme was spiritual loss for material gain. The deal always sounds good on the surface, but it´s like nobody reads the fine print. In the end, it´s a bad deal. A very very bad deal. Everybody, each and every single one will later regret the bad choice they made. It´s that simple. I'm going to say that one more time... everybody later regrets the very bad choice.    

  
  Some call it narcissism, others just say demonic and spiritual possession. As a child I would dream of the spririt realm, and it made sense to me. It just did.  I tried to hide the fact that I knew these things. But I was the black sheep. I would be the scapegoat for the others.  I just wanted to belong to something good.  That´s why I got involved in some stuff in my teens.  I wanted to be a part of something. That´s the thing about gangs, it really feels like a good community at first.  The pride and power feels amazing when you´ve never felt that before.  I was surrounded by narcissists. They call some “covert narcissists” because when the masks drops it is just shocking to see how evil they are. Some are good at hiding it.  But like the saying goes, there are three things you cannot hide for long, the moon, the sun and the truth. 

  
  I have a good temperment.  After I cleaned up my life and got focused, success just came steadily to me. Once the distractions were gone, good things just start to happen.  I didn´t want to be like my older brother and cousin.  I wanted to stay out of gang life.  I wanted to have an honest business, pay my taxes and sleep at night knowing nobody has anything on me.  It took some hustle, but it really actually happened.  It's not easy to make a plan and maintain the discipline to make it actually happen. The other path would lead to life in prison or worse. This path will lead to, well it lead to wealth and wholesome independence. This is what I wanted. This was my dream and it came true. Almost. 

  
  When Maria came into my life, it felt like this is it.  God is sending me a good woman to compliment my success.  But as people familiar with toxicity and narcissism and dark arts are too familiar with, things always seem too good to be true in the start. This was the case. It just all seemed to be too good to be true. Maria was so nearly ideal in so many ways and she seemed so attentive and focused on working towards making me happy. I thought maybe God had sent her to me. But this was balanced out with dread. I took it real slow with her. I wanted to be sure.  She was trying really hard. 

  
  Aside from showering me with the physical love that a man naturally loves, Maria used the word 'love' quick.  She said she loved me.  'I love you'.  Beautiful words.  But the ultimate manipulation tool of the narcissist, or a witch or warlock. She used her spells to trap me. She cast her evil spells on me. It is natural for a man to love a beautiful young and virtuous woman who loves him. But in a world where so many women, people, have fallen from grace, when a man finds a such a prized woman he is ready to give such a woman a crown of divinity.  And the woman gives the man his crown of divinity.  We are stronger together united.  This is the way it has to be for it to really work. And this is why such unity is being targeted in our world... to promote disfunciton.  Such a healthy tree will bear sweet fruit. But this woman, Maria, is no woman of virtue. She is an actor, a chamillion.  She is a witch in disguise and none of such witches can keep their mask on forever.  A harlot of Babylon is too good to be true and the so horrible, it is unreal. I had dreams that were prophetic. One really shook me and now it makes so much sense. That is the one of the black mantis perched on a beam of light.  It must have been just a couple months after I met her that I started having this dream.  The mantis represents her, and the light is my soul energy that she is siphoning from me to her for her desperate survival. She casted her lovespells.  Words have power and she wrapped her spiritual tethers around me with her lovebombs and spells that she spoke to me and spoke over me in private outside of my physical presence.

  
   I wanted to believe the sweet lie, so I tried to make things work. She told me that I'm all she ever wanted but continued to disrespect me. Basically she wanted to condition me to be okay with the abuse. My toxic family was no different, In the realm of witchcraft they have what you call 'familiar spirits'. Dear listener I couldn't tell you how many times Maria would stare at me and I would ask what is wrong? Her reply was 'I can't read you or what you're thinking it's hard'. Anyone who operates in Witchcraft without meeting each other knows they can communicate telepathically. This is why it was not only my old gang friend Crawler but random people we would meet where I suspected & felt like they knew each other.  She is not the only one who has told me that she could not read me. This is the spiritual essence of gang stalking. All she ever had to do was ask, and I would have told her what I am thinking. I'm not big on lying & I don't ever wish bad on people or become jealous for no reason. I like to see people make it in life & succeed. Well these people are the exact opposite. They are literally children of the Devil. He came only to lie, steal, cheat, & destroy. 

  
  My body was sounding the alarm bells, but I stayed.  There was a time where I was laying with her and I got up to go in the other room because I felt literally sick to my stomach.  This effect she had on me would only get worse from here.  It´s like my body and spirit knew I was in danger, but my mind was stuck in some lovespell logic loop and wanted to believe the chamillion illusion I was bearing witness to. There were so many coincidences, or synchronicitites. Her last name was pretty much my name, my real name.  Her birthday was the day after mine.  It like she was put her on Earth for me exactly.  And she was... her assignement being to destroy me.  Little by little, and despite the often strange vibes, I gave her the title.  Girlfriend.  We were going steady. I thought that maybe I was just being paranoid and that she might just be my soulmate.  But things changed after she got the title. It´s like she had been working doubletime to earn the title. Once she got it, once she secured me, she started to change.  She said \`I was being an ass.\` She stopped giving compliments.  

&#x200B;

  I was a little uneasy.  At times I started wondering exactly who it is that I have here as a girlfriend.  Her stories just simply did not add up.  I asked her to clear up stories that didn´t add up and she would just double down on her unrealistic and obviously a lie story.  This is calculated gaslighting.  I don´t like admitting it, but I needed to know. I paid for a background check on her.  It was money well spent because I was shocked to find out who it was I had sleeping in my bed with me.  She actually was very wealthy and had considerable assets internationally.  This was shocking for a young woman who presents herself as sweet and inexperienced.  In truth, she was born into a wealthy Satanic Mafia Cult family and she is very very aware of her status.  Such a status comes with pride, but behind that veil is dread.  None of them are happy about their predicament.  Maybe more than the wealth is the status of the forbidden knowledge that gives them their sense of pride and entitlement.  Her act was slick, I have to admit. Without her youth and beauty, she´d be powerless, but she still has this and will for some years from now.  

&#x200B;

  Maria was sent to take me out.  I understand this spiritual reality now.  One more thing about the background check that really really threw me off.  Maria was a paid and salaried police informant.  Seriously, you can´t make this stuff up.  Imagine finding out that the supposedly virtuous girl that is telling you she loves you is a spellcasting, salaried by the corrupt authorities, satanic culy mafia family member on assignment to destroy you and suck every last ounce of life energy out of your soul before leaving you for dead.  Yeah, it ain´t a pretty love story this one.  With all their power, you might think they won... but they lost. The whole gruesome affair just made me stronger wiser and my glow even brighter after the period of darkness and awakening. And the truth about them is exposed. This is why they must run an absurd smear campaign, to try to poison the well of truth about them. That is the thing about evil.. it is a parasite.  The lies are cheap and laughable once you know the playbook.  It´s plain as day to see it once you trust your divinity which is your natural god given intuition. 

  
  Things started getting crazy.  It´s half anxiety provoking and half exciting. That is how such a witch hooks you.  It´s the addictive nature and the thrill of the trauma bond.  That Machiavellian vampire manipulation cocktail of enticement and fear.  We kept going to church on Sunday during the first year.  I know that having God in your life doesn´t require church attendence, but I enjoyed the messages, the music and especially the good vibes from the community. Through all that I felt like I was catching myself and my path to personal heaven.  I was happy to have Maria by my side.  One Sunday, she whispered to me during church service ´I´m not wearing any panties.´  I mean I am a man.  And that is hot.  But why would you do that at church.  It left a bitter taste and I knew she was poison, but you know when the poison is sweet, sometimes you just make a bad decision.    

  
  I noticed things were disappearing from my home. The razor. My toothbrush. Things that I wear where disappearing. She was pocketing my stuff for her dark magic witch rituals. It´s sounds crazy. I know.  But this is the situation.  Some of my friends started acting strange around me.  I knew something was up. Things are going down and people are not telling me. I´m getting spoonfuls of lies from the people closest to me in my life.
