"I'm a real person! I am *literally* standing in front of you!" I screamed at the woman from the bank. Her face stayed flat. Bored.

"Please calm down, ma'am, I don't deserve to be spoken to lik-..."

"Oh! Oh, *you* don't deserve it? Let me tell you what *I've* been through!"

I tried to keep my voice from shaking. “First, my debit card stopped working. I thought it was a glitch. Customer service said my account doesn’t exist. My *life savings.* Gone! Then the DMV wouldn’t renew my license! They said they couldn’t find my file. They accused *me* of forgery. Then the hospital? No record. Not even in billing. And now you’re telling me I don’t have an account *here* either?”

She glanced at her screen and clicked around like she wasn’t even trying. "Ma’am," she said, cool and scripted, "if there’s no record, there’s no record. Maybe you’ve made a mistake."

A mistake. I’d heard that too many times. From clerks, officials, even friends who acted like they’d never met me.

One of them, Rachel, actually called the cops on me when I showed up at her place, asking if she remembered me.

They said I was harassing her.

I slammed my fists on the counter. “Do I look like a mistake to you?”

She picked up the phone. "Security."

I left before they could touch me.


Outside, everything felt off. Like the colors were just slightly wrong. People passed too quickly. Too quietly. A woman on her phone bumped into me hard.

*"Hey!"* I barked.

She didn’t turn. Didn’t flinch.

I pulled out my phone. Still no service. My contacts list was empty, except for one name I didn’t recognize: ***Alex.***

I tapped it.

The screen blinked.

Then a low strange sound buzzed in my ears. A flat voice followed.

***"You are aware now."***

My skin literally crawled. I looked around. Nothing unusual, except the edges of things seemed…unsteady. Like heat rising off asphalt.

"Who is this?" I asked.

Silence.

Then: ***"This is a necessary correction."***

The voice didn’t sound mechanical. It didn’t sound human either.

"What? I don’t understand."

The line went dead.

A week ago, I found my old birth certificate in a shoebox, except, it had someone else’s name on it. Same birthday. Same hospital. Different person.

My therapist said I was *"externalizing unresolved trauma."* Said stress can cause *"memory distortions."*

But this wasn’t *memory.* This was *everything.*

I backed away, nearly tripping off the curb. The shimmer grew stronger—like the edges of the world were peeling. A child’s laughter twisted into a static hiss. The sky pulsed, just once.

"I’m real," I said aloud. To no one. To myself. "I’m *real.*"

My reflection in a window...it flickered. Just for a second. Like a broken signal. My skin, my face...it didn’t look right.

I reached out. My fingers blurred at the edges.

"No," I whispered.

I tried to move. Tried to run. But my legs slowed, like the air was made of mud.

My arm dissolved painlessly into drifting fragments. My reflection vanished from the glass.

The world around me dimmed, warped, and folded inward.

And then-...

Nothing.

I don’t know how long I was gone. Honestly, it felt like I just blinked, and now I’m back. But I'm in a different city. And there's a different name on my ID.

My phone works again though. My accounts are all back. Everything seems normal.

But I think it’s only a matter of time before it happens again.

Am I a real person?...
