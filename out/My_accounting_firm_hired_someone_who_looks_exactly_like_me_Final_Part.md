I'll try to recount the next several days as they happened, but [my last conversation with Alex](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mrlixn/my_accounting_firm_hired_someone_who_looks/) had left me in a very miserable state, and I can't remember the finer details of those days no matter how hard I try. As such, I can only expand on very brief details that clued me in, at the time, to the changes that were starting to take place in my state of existence as a whole.

Sunday: My sister didn't notice me in the kitchen when she got home from work. I was making dinner. I'm pretty sure I greeted her. I thought about calling my mom again.

Monday: I went back to work. I think I was just grasping at familiarity at that point; miraculously, I hadn't yet gotten fired, but I suspected that was also probably Alex's doing. Lucy, the secretary, mistakenly gave my paycheck over to Alex. He handed it over to me, but I got the impression at the time it would be the last time he needed to do that. I thought about calling my mom again. I got halfway through dialing her number before I gave up, because some part of me was convinced that she was talking to Alex, and that Alex would be a better child to her anyway.

Tuesday: I went back to work. I didn't do much other than stare at my computer screen with my headphones on. I think it was genuinely powered off for half the day, but no-one said anything to me about it. I told Alex I'd never liked the name Sam, but that it would break my mom's heart if I ever tried to change it, so I didn't. He told me he knew. One of his coworkers bumped into me in the hallway and didn't say anything to me. My sister was watching a movie in the living room when I got home. I didn't greet her and she didn't greet me. I thought about calling my mom again because I just wanted to hear her voice. I wanted to hear anyone's voice that wasn't Alex.

Wednesday: My computer refused to turn on. I remember the most about this day because it was the first time I tried to speak to anyone at the firm since Alex had first arrived more than a week ago. I asked Lucy if she'd be willing to ask IT to take a look at my computer. She looked at me strangely, and told me she'd just seen me working on my computer when she walked by the office. I knew she was talking about Alex so I didn't push the issue further than that. I felt relieved someone had talked to me, so I thought especially hard about calling my mom that night, on the off chance she might remember me.

I vaguely remember falling asleep on Wednesday to the sound of ASMR videos, because I liked the way the person on the other side of the screen talked to me like I was really there in the room with them. I had just begun to drift off when I felt the crushing sensation of nothingness come back, like it had on the day Alex had visited my apartment.

The first time I had been nothing, it had scared me.

This time, it felt a little bit like slotting into place where I was supposed to be. I was only just aware enough to know that I wasn't anything—that there was no body laying asleep in my bed. I had become the absence of everything. And it didn't feel much different to laying peacefully in my bed, except that it was a lot quieter and a lot more peaceful.

If I was nothing, I didn't have to worry about Alex. Or my life, that I'd wasted away by being a coward. I didn't even know what worrying was. I knew that no-one would miss me, because I wasn't even leaving my absence behind—something was already filling the hole I would have created otherwise.

I felt grateful to Alex. He was so happy with everything I'd never done. With my neighbors I never spoke to and my coworkers I was too afraid to approach. And my mom, who I never called.

And then suddenly, I wasn't nothing. I thought I was eighteen again, and my mom was in her truck somewhere halfway across the country while I was sitting alone on the floor of my apartment. I remembered sitting there for hours, phone in my hand, even though she'd only left the state the day before. I'd told her goodbye when she left. I'd been the last one to see her off.

I still wanted to call her, though. To talk to her and ask how her day was going even though she was in the middle of driving cross-country to her new home, to re-start her life without me in it.

And then it was Thursday afternoon, and I was twenty-two and sitting on my apartment floor with a ringing phone in my hand. My mom picked up before it could even finish its first ring.

"Sam?" she asked.

I was silent.

"Are you okay?"

I was silent.

"You haven't called in so long! I was getting worried."

I couldn't help myself then. I remember I just started sobbing, uncontrollably, into the phone. My mom started to panic on the other line, but I don't remember exactly what she'd said, because I was too busy getting wracked by sobs so heavy they were almost starting to make me wretch. I don't know how long it took me to calm down, but my mom was still on the phone with me.

I felt a number of things all at once. I was suddenly terrified all over again that I'd come this close to letting someone else walk himself into my life and take it from me. I was happier than I'd ever been to hear my mom's voice through the speaker, trying to calm me down from over two thousand miles away. I was relieved that I was there, and that my mom hadn't heard from me in over a week, because that meant she hadn't spoken to Alex.

But mostly, I felt like something.

I did eventually calm down, of course, and I assuaged my mom's worries by telling her I'd just felt a bit out of it for the past week or so, and that I missed her and wanted to hear her voice. I know there are probably some of you who thought I should have told her about Alex, and I think I probably could have if I wanted to. She probably would have thought I just had a nightmare or something, but I could have told her.

I was just scared, still. I felt like I was hanging on by a thread, and that if I brought Alex to her, she might end up preferring that version of my life, too.

From a perspective of perfect clarity: I wouldn't have blamed her if she did. I genuinely preferred that version of my life, too, where I was a more friendly and confident person whose coworkers didn't absolutely hate them. Where I didn't give up on my art the moment things got hard. Where I was really honest with myself about the fact that I didn't like the way that people looked at me. 'Alex' was even, probably, the name I would have chosen for myself, in that life where I was confident enough to do so.

She stayed on the phone and listened to me talk about everything I wanted to do with my life for an hour. And then I told her I was tired, and that I'd skipped work, and that I'd talk to her tomorrow.

Despite the conversation with my mom, I still found myself sitting in my room and thinking for a longer time than I'd have liked.

I was still afraid to face Alex again. Now, more than ever, I dreaded seeing my own face show up on the other side of my door to show me all the things I'd missed out on doing and being again. I was—and still am—the same pathetic person I was before Alex came into my life. And I felt oddly guilty at the prospect of having survived, like I was taking something that wasn't mine to take.

I still remembered the way he'd looked at me when he'd offered me champagne, like he was the happiest person on earth just for the reality of being me. I'm ashamed to say that even at this point, I still kind of wanted him to have that.

Only kind of. Ultimately, I chose to be selfish. I thought about my call with my mom, and how worried she'd been about me, and I made the choice to stand up from my floor only because I knew she'd be worried about me, if Alex filled the space I was supposed to take up.

It was late into being nighttime when I found it in myself to move from my bedroom to the kitchen. I had to force myself to move, because there were still parts of me that wanted to lay down and take what Alex was offering me. I knew it would have been the easier way out, but I steered my own body towards the knife set anyway.

My mom had gotten them for me. That was why I could put my hand on the handle of the biggest one in the set and pull it out. These knives were only here because someone cared about me.

I felt a little emboldened by the fact that I had a weapon in my hands, although I didn't know what to expect. I sort-of feared that Alex would be standing right outside my front door, so I looked through the peephole before I even touched the handle.

The space between our two apartments was empty. I let out a relieved exhale, and I opened the door.

It was a cool night. I could see the moon overhead between the gaps of the buildings connected by this tiny landing that made up the bridge between our two apartments, and I took a second to stare at it, because I was still a little worried that I might never see it again.

I approached his door.

I wondered if I'd known the password back then, when I first saw him standing here. If there had been a single passing thought in my mind that told me which four numbers he'd entered.

I knew it now, at least. It was my password.

His apartment was a reflection of my own. His kitchen was my kitchen, only there weren't any dirty dishes in the sink. There was a dry-erase calendar hung on his wall with events and dates and names marked in green ink, a stark contrast to the one in my entryway, which was almost entirely filled with my sister's red writing.

His furniture was a little nicer than mine, like he'd been less worried about money when he'd first moved out. He had decorations on his walls where mine were bare—I wasn't confident enough for interior decorating, because I knew I had no sense for it.

His bedroom door was open.

He probably wasn't afraid of that, either. He probably didn't have to close every door in the apartment when he slept, because he was confident enough to let himself be a little afraid. His room probably didn't get stuffy at night, because even if the air conditioning was faulty, he left his goddamn door open.

I saw him sleeping on his bed.

It was my bed, but he had a set of sheets on it that I'd looked at longingly before deciding not to buy them, because changing my sheets and throwing out my old ones seemed like too much trouble. They were green. And he'd decorated his room with merchandise and posters of all my favorite things, that I was too scared to buy and proudly display because I was worried that my family would tease me when I came over. And he had plants in his room. I'd killed every plant I ever touched.

Here was a person who everyone liked, sleeping peacefully with his back against the bed. And suddenly I wasn't scared of him—I was scared of myself. Because there I was, standing in the doorway of a man with a happy life with a knife in my hand, and I knew what I was going to do with it. I was going to rid the world of someone whose life had meaning.

I realized I was shaking again as I took a few steps closer.

He didn't stir. I've always been a heavy sleeper; I didn't expect him to.

I crept up to the side of his bed, and as I raised the knife above him, I was still afraid. I was afraid that I'd kill Alex, and everyone would look at me with their thinly veiled hatred when they realized what I'd done. I was afraid that even if I made the choices he made now, it was too late for people to start liking me, or tolerating me. I was afraid that I had already gone past the point of no return, and that killing him would mean committing to the shitty, lonely version of my life I'd lead up until now.

"I'm sorry," I whispered. "I'm so sorry. You can't do this to me."

I was prepared for there to be some grand, terrifying barrier preventing me from stabbing Alex. I expected, at least, for him to try and stop me. But he was still sleeping, and the knife sunk into his chest. I watched as his eyes flew open, and I acted automatically—I jerked the knife out, and then plunged it back into his chest, over and over and over again until I was sure he'd been dead five minutes ago.

Alex, his sheets, and I were all soaked in warm, red blood. At the end of the day, he'd been something enough to bleed.

I sat there next to his corpse for what felt like hours. Then I got up and walked out of his apartment, back to my own bed, and fell asleep to the sound of silence.

Friday was my birthday.

I woke up to blood everywhere on my body and my sheets, and I half-expected the police to show up at my door the moment I opened my eyes. I wasn't even sure Alex had ever been real, but I felt the blood wash off of me when I stepped into the shower that morning.

There were still no police at my door when I finished my morning routine, but there *was* still blood on my sheets. I supposed that answered my question.

My mom called me to wish me a happy birthday, and we talked for a few minutes, even though we were both busy. Then I went to work, because I hadn't been enough of a person the day before to request time off for my birthday.

I was sort of still dreading it. Alex or no Alex, I'd still heard exactly what the rest of my coworkers thought of me; the idea of continuing to work in a place where I knew no-one exactly respected my position there felt like it was going to give me hives. But I'd killed something, last night, and this job was a part of the life that I killed him over.

I thought it was probably about time I had the slightest bit of pride, as a person. Whether I'd earned it or not, I deserved that much, and it was because I was coasting on those sorts of feelings that I ended up going rather than calling in sick last minute.

When I walked in the door, Lucy smiled at me, and I smiled back at her as I headed straight towards my empty office.

Alex's computer was set up right where it had been, only it didn't seem like the monitors were connected. And there were no personal items—no green-and-brown stationery or paperweights or organizational tools. I sat down at my computer, which still refused to turn on, and took a second to laugh miserably about my own misfortune. Of course, this would be the one thing that remained constant.

Lucy came in after a few minutes of me twiddling my thumbs and frowned.

"Oh," she said, like she was just remembering something. "I forgot to ask IT about your computer."

"It's fine," I said, and smiled because she'd remembered that conversation.

"I'll go send an email now," she said, but I stopped her.

"Um." It was still difficult to get the words out—like asking would still be a chore. "Is anyone using that computer?"

I jerked my head towards the computer Alex had used. Lucy frowned, then shook her head.

"I don't think so. I can have them set it up for you if you'd like."

I nodded.

"Okay," I said, because I was still afraid I'd sound too demanding if I just asked for it. "Sure."

"I'll go let them know," she said, and started to walk back out of the room. Halfway through the doorframe, she paused. "Wait!"

When she turned around again, I noticed she'd been holding something in her hand. It was a small, store-bought cupcake with the kind of frosting I hated because it was too rich and too sweet. It wasn't anything special; everyone in the office got one on their birthday. But I was just happy they'd cared enough to give me a cupcake at all.

Lucy set it down on my desk. "Happy birthday, Sam."

"Thanks," I said.

It felt like the best birthday present ever.

I didn't talk to any of my other coworkers. I didn't go out to lunch with them, and they didn't ask me, and I spent the day with my headphones in. I left early, and on the way home, I stopped at the store and bought my green bedsheets and three different succulents I was probably going to slowly kill. When I pulled into my apartment complex, there was a moving truck with an open back, and a middle-aged woman carting out furniture and boxes who smiled at me as I walked past her to my apartment.

I saw the open door of the apartment across from me, inside completely unfurnished, as if the past two weeks hadn't happened at all. 

I thought about Alex, and how happy he was, and how I still felt like I was kind of a monster for killing him when all he'd wanted to do was live. How I killed him just so I could go back to being unhappy and too afraid to really talk to people.

It's hard to explain exactly why, but I felt like I owed it to him to at least try and do things I was uncomfortable with. I didn't want to talk to my new neighbor; I wanted to change my bedsheets, and listen to music, and try to make some art or write something worthwhile.

But I knew I'd still have time for that later. I knew that for the rest of my life, there would still be time. I dropped my things off in my room and went back outside. 

"Hey," I called, peering down at the array of belongings at the bottom of the stairs. "Do you need help?"

She laughed, and told me she was glad I'd asked.

I did find time, once the sun had set, to change my sheets. Then I sat down and drew for about five hours, for the first time in a few months; a sloppy, imperfect picture of Alex, or me, or both of us. 

The distinction didn't really matter to me anymore. I figured that if he ever did come back, it wouldn't be for a long time.
