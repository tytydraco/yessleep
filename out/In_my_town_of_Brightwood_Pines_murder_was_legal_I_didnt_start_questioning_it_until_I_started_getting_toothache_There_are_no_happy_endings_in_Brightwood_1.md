There are no happy endings in Brightwood.

It’s rich, and kinda naive that you would actually think there would be inside a fabricated town controlled by despair. 

I have come to the end of my [story](https://www.reddit.com/user/Trash_Tia/comments/13o31kn/brightwood_parts_17/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), with one half today, and the other, tomorrow. 

Around me is an interrogation room. 

Just like the movies. I’m illuminated in bright light which blinds me. It doesn’t hurt, but I do lift my hand several times to shade my eyes. There’s a glass of milk sitting in front of me. 

There are shadows in front of me. 

Two cops. They speak to each other in low murmurs and at times I have to lean forward to understand what they are saying. The light gets brighter. Almost uncomfortably brighter, until everything is shadow. Everyone in the room are silhouettes I cannot make out. But that is okay. I'm okay with shadows. I am okay with faceless figures looming over me. The glass of milk turns to water, and then to soda. Coke was my favorite. Mom never let me have it when I was a kid. She said the sugar would rot my teeth.  I tip my head back and allow myself to breathe. 

I think about speaking. But I don’t. 

Instead, I wrap my fingers around the glass of milk—which is now Coke and gulp it down until it recoils back into my mouth in a sour paste.  I can’t keep the smile from my face—and it is real. I am grinning through ice-cold milk splashing down my chin because only one thought invades my mind, relentlessly choking me. I know it will never leave me; that it will continue to entwine through my very being, eliciting every nerve ending.

*I am free.*

“Elle.” One of the shadows in front of me leans forward with steepled hands, and I keep drinking from the empty glass, my teeth clinking against the rim. I hear what the shadow is saying, but I choose to play with his words, twisting them in my mind. “We know you’re still in shock," The shadow says inside my skull. “But you still haven’t told us…” 

He drifts off, and I use the pause to laugh. 

When an explosion of agony rocks the back of my skull, and I can feel it—wet warmth running down my neck and staining the back of my shirt, my hands balling into fists in my lap– I laugh again, and my mouth is dry.  Still, I smile. I smile until my jaw hurts. I smile until the pain in the back of my head, which no longer feels like pain, is far more prominent. “Elle, can you hear me?”

Yes.

No.

I don’t know.

I communicate through those words because I can’t find any of my own—and when I do, I found myself laughing.

“Yes.”

I can feel it again. It drips down my back and my neck, spiderwebbing down my face. I am used to it. The shadow cleared its throat, and I felt my body jerk slightly. The light in front of me was so… so bright, but I couldn’t look away from it. “Please take this seriously,” the shadow said stiffly. “Can you tell us what happened to Felix Delacroix?”

I nodded.

“Yes.”

“In your own time, please.”

“Yes.”

“Elle, try and stay calm, okay?”

No.

“Yes.”

My body jerked again, and this time I am fully aware of myself. I am aware of the blackhole drilled inside me, and my unravelling self.

Leaning forward, I pulled my best smile which I knew they loved. That exact grin which split my mouth apart, hurt my jaw. It was the one which sent me spiralling. I looked directly at the camera staring down at me where I knew thousands of eyes were. So many eyes on me. So many eyes waiting for me to break down in front of these talking shadows in the light. 

They were all laughing at me. 

What happened to Felix Delacroix? The question echoed in my head. 

I saved him.

I don’t remember saying those words. They were purely inside my mind, and those specific words were the only ones keeping me situated. Keeping me anchored. Keeping my eyes glued to the cameras, I play with my hands in my lap. 

To the shadows in front of me, I say nothing. 

I keep my mouth shut. But inside my mind, I am coming apart slowly, unravelling. I am back inside the control room inside Brightwood, and I am on my knees. The floor is ice-cold but it is a relief from the numbing feeling seeping into my mind and taking an unyielding hold. The control room was filled with darkness, and my only light was… him. The screen displaying the final contortions of his brain which would rip away his humanity for good. It wasn’t… fair. The words were gritted between my teeth. 

I had seen his beginning, an innocent child twisted into the seed of a psychopath. I had seen his awakening, his killings, and even my own family suffering at his hands. But I also saw the parts of him which didn’t want to be that person anymore. The parts of him hiding from that twisted version of himself. So, how was it fair… how was it fair that I had to watch his final unravelling? The question already had an answer—but I was in denial of it. Brightwood had failed to turn me into a killer through brainwashing, so this was their trump-card. 

Or rather HE was their trump-card. The red haired woman was as brutally cruel as she had been when he was a child, snapping the rabbit’s neck in front of his wide eyes. 

But as a seven-year-old, Felix had been engineered through subtle influence meaning to slowly twist his mind into a killer. Now, with two narrow metal rods, the woman was able to achieve what had taken ten years, in a matter of minutes. As if transfixed, I watched both rods delve into his skull once again; just like they had inside the Redroom. Though, instead of tricking his brain and contorting his thoughts into happiness instead of agony, the procedure worked as a reset. Resetting him back to the person who took part in turning me into Elle.

Who kidnapped my sister, and sliced into her brain until she was a broken shell of herself.

How can I describe agony with cohesion? 

How can I even begin to write my happy ending? 

It begins with an abyss inside my heart and a splinter in my gut as I watched hope ignite right in front of my eyes. I remember screaming, slamming my hands into a door which I knew wouldn’t open. His screams twisted into wails, before collapsing into whispers begging for death, and then…. Nothing. I had only tore my eyes away from the screen for a single moment—and when my gaze found the screen once more, all of the life had been drained away. There was just a wooden chair, and slumped in it, with his head bowed, his body a puppet severed from his strings…. Kaz Issacs.  

What had been the last lingering pieces of Felix Delacroix’s humanity.

“Consider this your very own Redroom treatment,” The announcer’s voice crept into my mind, rattling my skull. 

I couldn’t look, but how could I not? 

How could I not look at my hopes of walking outside of Brightwood with Kaz and Annalise at my side? “The first real peek into your own despair,” He said. “Will finally give us our Elle.” 

His words sent me to my feet once again, grasping hold of the handle, which jerked suddenly, allowing me to pull open the door. 

I expected the announcer to continue, but he was gone. The guards standing behind me, were also gone. When I threw myself into the room, I don’t know what I expected. For one, the redhaired woman was nowhere to be seen.

Felix was still in the exact same position he had been on the screen, but there was no sign of his torturer. Hesitantly, I took slow steps towards the boy. His head was bowed, and I could see spatters of red pooling down the side of his forehead where the metal rods had penetrated through his skull.

I made myself a promise right then and there.

If he was gone, I would abandon him and wipe the boy clearly from my mind, find Annalise, and run.

“Felix.”

I spoke his name through a breathy whisper threatening to choke into a cry. The more I was looking at him, memories from my old life were starting to bleed into me. He took me from my life, killed my parents, and somehow I was standing in front of him wanting him to be okay. That realization was like ice-cold water slamming into me. 

I wanted him to be okay. I wanted him to be the boy I left behind. So, I said his other name—louder. “Kaz! Hey, it’s me.” 

Part of me wondered if he was going to lunge off of the chair with a maniacal grin, throwing himself on me like a wild animal. I never did see the end of the procedure. Just him slumping forwards, his body relaxing against the chair. 

Looking at him, however, the boy just looked like the kid who had sat behind me in math class for two years, who killed Jessa Pollux in our sophomore year, and followed me on his bike to uncover the mystery behind our town, and the so-called Urge. No matter what I had seen and what had happened to him, he was still Kaz Issacs. So, ignoring every ounce of my being telling me to turn around and run for my life,  I forced myself to get closer and grabbed his shoulders, shaking him. I grabbed at his restraints, struggling to untie him. 

He was in bad shape. I was brushing bloody clumps of brown hair from his eyes, when the boy’s body shifted in the chair, and I froze up, my hands still grazing his forehead. “I told you.” 

His voice was a broken moan which sent me springing back, my breath in my throat. Automatically, I knew he was gone. I knew the procedure had worked and there was nothing left of him for me to save. Not the six year old little kid forced to become a weapon for people’s entertainment, or my oblivious classmate living inside a fractured fantasy. When he didn’t move, however, his bound wrists only struggling slightly before going limp again, I realized his voice was pained. 

Felix was feeling pain. I knew in his twisted mindset, pain didn’t exist—or did, but he was taught it was a side effect of euphoria. I had been inside his memory, suffocated by his lack of emotions and feelings under the guise of the screen filled with blood, and the haunting murders of his father and brother which had sent him into the abyss, embracing pain like pleasure. 

That wasn’t what I was seeing. 

The boy was clearly suffering, his shoulders trembling, sharp pants escaping his mouth as he drifted from slumber. My  gaze found the cavernous hole in the back of his head, where the redhaired woman had attempted to lobotomise him. It didn’t make sense in my mind that it hadn’t worked. That, against all odds, he had somehow survived Darkroom’s last resort into resetting him back to default. But it wasn’t the first time he had fought it and won. Kaz Issacs was the product of that. “I told you not to let them take it out." He said in a shuddery breath. "You're the reason why he came back." 

His words almost sent me to my knees, but that was okay. I knew them. I had known them days earlier, when Kaz had grasped hold of me, high on pain meds, and told me to promise him I wouldn’t let them remove the device which reverted him back to his original self. 

Could it be… that instead of resetting the boy back to murderous Felix, it had in fact turned him back into Kaz Issacs? I could have laughed, but I wouldn’t let myself smile. Not until all of us were safe. Felix’s voice was a pained hiss. 

He attempted to look up, and I helped him, grasping hold of his face, cradling his bloodstained cheeks and lifting his head so I could see the state of him. His cheeks were ashy pale, blood still staining him, painting him.

When I risked reaching forwards and grazing my fingers over the boy’s bloody nose and lips, Felix pulled back with a hiss. “Ow!” He pulled a face, before his half-lidded eyes were drinking in his surroundings. Which was just a single empty room which was being used for storage. His gaze found his bound hands, and then his legs—before meeting eyes with me. 

"Where are we?" 

I swallowed. "It's probably better if you didn't know."

"Oh." He blinked rapidly, seemingly remembering he was pissed. “You fucking promised, Elle!” I saw hurt in his expression, and he tugged at his restraints. I was speaking to Kaz. “You promised you weren’t going to let them take it out, and what did you do?” 

"Felix." I said in a breath. "Are you okay?" 

He rolled his eyes. “Oh, yeah! I'm great! I'm tied up, my head is pounding, I'm pretty sure I'm bleeding out, and you and Annalise left me." He gritted out. "You let them drag me away and turn me into...whoever he was."

I straightened up, lifting his eyelid to check the boy's eyes, and he pulled away with a hiss. “That hurts.” He shuddered when I ran my fingers through his hair, my fingers scraping his bloody scalp, a pained moan escaping his lips. “Hey! What did I say?”

“Right. Sorry.” I whispered. “Are you… all of you?”

His lip curved slightly. “What do you mean by that?”

I turned my attention to his restraints, freeing one of his wrists. The other was a lot harder, though I managed it, stumbling with his other.

Whoever had restrained him wasn’t playing around. Felix was watching me with an expression which made me wonder if he was either high, or Ava had actually loosened something in his skull. Still, I pulled at the ropes pinning his arms down. “That woman.” I said through a breath. "She was doing something to your head.” I cringed at the thought of the metal rods cruelly inserted into his skull. 

I couldn’t understand that he was—okay?

Somehow. 

The announcer told me the process was permanent, that it would change his brain chemistry and revert him back to the raging sociopath lacking humanity. My grasp on his restraints relax. I held my breath. “They pulled Kaz out of your head, so who exactly are you now?”

He made a snorting noise. “That’s… kind of hard to answer, dude. What I am right now, is in fucking pain. So, if you could get me out of this chair, that would be great."

“So, you’re… you?”

The boy groaned. “Who the fuck do you think I am? Get me out of here!” Felixhissed out when I attempted to check out his head wound. “That hurts!” I jumped back when he lifted his head, speaking through gritted teeth. “Do you seriously think poking it will help?”

“Sorry, it’s just… urgh.”

“Urgh?” Felix laughed, and it was weirdly comforting. “Thanks! I’ll make sure to insult your head wound next time you come to the brink of death.”

“No, I mean,” I bit back a groan. “I’m trying—"

“Shh.” Felix didn’t move for a moment, his gaze snapping to the ceiling. He leaned forward in the chair, one wrist still strapped down. “We’re being watched.” He blew a raspberry. “I can bet all of my subscribers, those bastards are pissed I’m not a raging psychopath right now. Which is crazy, right? Who in their right mind would want to watch a teenager on a murder spree?”

“Obviously.” I muttered. “They turned your attempted lobotomy into a show.” Holding my breath, I untied his other arm.

Diving to his feet, Felix seemed to remember his head wound, his lips curling back in a pained cry. He was setting things in motion quickly. “Thanks for finally coming back for me."

"In my defence, you did try and kill me last time I saw you," I said. "But speaking of whatever the fuck she did to your head, how are you still you?”

As if noticing the state of himself, Felix scratched at the back of his scalp, grimacing when his fingers came back dripping red. “I have no idea. But it’s good, right?” His lips formed a small smile. “I don’t know what happened, because I was pretty sure I was about to become Darkroom’s puppet for the rest of my life—and then I wake up like this.” 

With newly found energy, he paced up and down, his gaze occasionally finding the cameras. “So. We call it what we want, right?”

Felix shot me a smile, and I found myself liking it. “Fate.” He took a step towards me. “Or maybe Ava’s gotten a little rusty over the years. But.” He took my shoulders gently. “This isn’t something to question, Elle. It’s not something to be suspicious or scared of- - because this is exactly what I wanted. Kaz.” 

His smile split into a grin. “Ever since Kaz started to make me feel human again, he is all I’ve ever wanted.” Before I could reply, the boy strode over to the door and jerked the handle. 

“Locked.” He scoffed. “Sure.”

“Who are you?” I found myself asking.

He didn’t turn away from the door. “Do you want me to sugar-coat it?”

“No.”

“Alright, we’re getting out of here,” Felix muttered to himself, before going on the hunt for weapons. While he grabbed random objects and swung them like a bat, I waited for his reply. 

It did come eventually, though the boy was like a dog, distracted by everything. “I’m the one who gagged your screams while my friends killed your parents,” he said after a moment, his tone sobering. “I… I kidnapped you and your sister. I helped turn you into Elle, draining you of your identity, and mutilating your sister’s body and mind. I live-streamed hunting you down and killing your family right in front of you, Elle. I am Felix Delacroix.” 

He came to a standstill in front of a shelf full of old books. Felix picked up a hardback, flicking through dusty pages with his back to me. “But.” He said softly. “I’ve been thinking about this, trying to find a way to justify what I did with some shitty excuse like brainwashing, and yet I fucking can’t.” He stumbled over his words.

“But I can… I can remember who I was. I sat behind you in homeroom for two years. I listened to old music on my outdated radio in my room and went to the skatepark every weekend with these guys from school. I joined junior varsity, went to the lake every summer, and worked for my dad’s friend at the scrapyard.” He still wasn’t looking at me, and I knew why. His fingers grazed over the bottom shelf. “Do you remember in freshman year when Milly Lockhart brought tacos for everyone, and they turned out to be like, two weeks expired?"

Felix surprised me with a laugh, but the boy still wasn’t turning to face me directly.  “Holy shit, and I mean literally holy shit. I have never known sickness like that. I didn’t even know it was possible to go from both ends at the same time.” This time, the boy did turn to me.

I figured this was a step forward, or his own personal development. Looking at me and addressing things was definitely a start. “We spent the entire day in the nurse’s office because our parents refused to come get us, and you called me a baby,” Felix leaned against the shelf with his arms folded. “Which was justified. I was crying like a little bitch. But hey,” his amused eyes found mine, lips curled into a grin. I knew he was in pain. I could tell from the crease in his brow that he was in agony, and that wasn’t going to get better. The hole in his head needed seriously tending to, or he was going to fucking die. Which meant I would lose both of them. Kaz and Felix. Annalise too. Still though, I knew what Felix was doing. And I was comforted by it. Those weren’t my memories. They were Elle's’s. 

Part of Elle. And whoever became her, was filled with them. But I was awake now. “You actually told me stories to calm me down,” He chuckled. “The two of us just… lay there tripping on a raging fever and telling stories for hours. It’s probably one of my favorite memories. Minus the. You know, projectile vomiting.” Snapping out of his nostalgic trance, Felix continued searching, ducking under the shelf.

“They weren’t mine.” I said stiffly.

“Hm?” Felix was on his knees, trying to reach for something under the shelf.

“Those memories you were talking about,” I wrapped my arms around myself. “They weren’t mine.”

“Oh, I know that.” Felix jumped up, this time waving a lead pipe, before striding over to the chair and pushing it over to the wall. Before I could ask what he was doing, the boy hopped onto the chair, and slightly off balance, his body swaying to the left and right, reached up to grab the security camera, and pulling it off with a violent tug. When a loud siren sounded suddenly, a screeching crawling its way into my skull, his lips stretched into a grin. I resisted against clamping my hands over my ears. We had definitely caught Darkroom’s attention. Though maybe that’s what he wanted. If the announcer was so obsessed with sending me spiralling through the death of Felix’s mind, the audience were going to be disappointed that the opposite had happened. 

However, just like the man had told me on the intercom, nothing was worse than zero content. Felix removing the camera had probably just cut off their live feed. “There!” He yelled over the siren, diving off of the chair and coming to a stumbling halt in front of me. I had to thrust out my arms to stop him actually knocking me over. Ignoring the sirens, he grabbed the lead pipe off of the floor. I watched his hands wrap around rusted steel, something cold slithering down my spine. He knew exactly how to use it. His fingers were primed, ready to use it as a weapon. His expression sobered for a moment. “It wasn’t you.” Felix said. “She wasn’t you, I mean. 

But… just like me having Kaz’s memories, you have hers. And the ones before her. Charlotte, Olivia, and Ally. So, in conclusion," Felix waved the pipe in front of me, thrusting it into my hands. I frowned down at it, my thoughts spinning. He folded his arms. "What? Why are you looking at me like that?”

"I don't know how to use it."

"Swing it! Like you're playing baseball."

I gritted my teeth. So far, his plan sucked. The pipe could work as a bat to impale, but I wasn’t a Darkroom OG. I had zero experience taking a life. Felix, who was busy fashioning what looked like a coil of wire into what I could only describe as a makeshift garotte, twisted to me. “Don’t think about it, just swing,” he said. “These people don’t want to hurt us. They see us as merchandise… puppets they can continue to parade around on their broadcast. Use that to your advantage, okay?” He grabbed my hands, positioning my fingers. “Hold it like this. They won’t attack you. They’ll try and get a needle in your neck. So, just swing. Like cracking an egg. If they go down, continue until they’ve stopped moving. Or they start, like bleeding out.”

“Right.” I tightened my grip on the pipe. “And how exactly do you know this?”

“You’re kidding, right?” The boy actually laughed, continuing his assault of the room. Felix kicked the wooden chair over, and stamped on the leg, breaking it off and waving it in an arch. “Didn’t those bastards force my memories onto you? Dude, as if you don’t know. I am a fucking brainwashed psychopath trained from pre-school age to be some degenerate basement dweller’s entertainment.” He twisted around to me, raising a brow, and the pipe. “Maybe they did do something to your head, because I refuse to believe after everything you have seen me do, you are questioning me beating someone to death.”

His smugness, even amidst our current situation, was driving me crazy.

I kept an eye on the door, anticipating pursuers. "I still don’t know which one you are.”  I yelled over the alarms. “When are they coming?”

I braced myself with the pipe.

Felix shrugged. “Any time now! If there’s something those bastards despise, it’s not being able to get their cameras into juicy shit. And I’d say our daring escape and the rescue of your sister counts as juice,” He came to stand in front of me, his breath in my face. “So. Here’s how it’s going to go down,” Felix said. “Our friends out there will burst into here, probably confused why I haven’t ripped you apart yet. You will hide behind the door. They’ll see that I did not in fact submit to their lobotomy number two and am no longer part of their psychotic cult of influencers,” he paused for effect. “They’ll come over to me, probably to see if I’m all there in the head. Oooh! Should I act? I can do a mean impression of being like, fully braindead.” When I shoved him and hissed at the boy to focus, he shook his head. “Anyway! While they’re freaking out over my amazing impression of Felix Delacroix’s death, you will creep behind them, and BAM. All you have to do is swing, and they’ll go down.”

“I just… swing?”

“Yep!” He stumbled off balance, and that was how I knew something was wrong; that the hole in his head wouldn’t just magically go away.  Like, I said, Elle! Just like cracking an egg.” Righting himself, he mimed swinging the pipe, making impact.

“Bam! And just like that… “ Again, the boy was stumbling, struggling to stand up. “You have successfully made your first kill.”

Easier said than done, I thought dizzily. But I didn’t have time to think about moralities. I started to protest his questionable plan, before once again, the boy’s expression sobered. 

I had to guess he was either high on adrenaline, or maybe the redhaired woman had actually tampered with his mental state. However, the slight mania in his eyes faded, replaced by an emotion I couldn’t quite place. I had never seen it in his eyes—not even Kaz’s eyes. 

“You told me you don’t remember Charlotte’s memories when she was Elle, right?” He murmured. “That’s because you’re not her… you’re…” he struggled, throwing out his arms. “I don’t know who you are, but I can’t wait to find out who that is. Because we’re going to find her, or.. or you.” His eyes were suddenly far too soft, and his voice a gentle murmur I could still hear over the deafening alarms slamming into my ears. “Neither of us are anyone, and that? That is okay.” Felix shrugged, looking lost, suddenly. So lost, like he was falling, and I wouldn’t be able to catch him this time. 

“Well, it’s not okay. Because I’ve done fucked up things. Things that I know will haunt me for the rest of my life, and I can’t even… I can’t even start to apologise, or even thinking about apologising, because truthfully?” He blinked slowly, and I took in every word. Because each word was pulling me from that oblivion I was falling towards. “I don’t even fucking know how, Elle.” His voice choked, and his words were suddenly entangled in sobs. “I don’t know what comes after this, because I have never known a life outside of this. Fighting. Fighting to keep my humanity and fighting for Kaz to take over. Fighting to get away from this place." He hissed out a breath. “But.” Felix shook his head. 

“For the first time, I actually feel like… like me, you know? Actually me. I don’t know what that woman did to me, but I think she… you know, I think she saved me?” He shrugged. “Well, she saved Kaz. Which is… crazy, right?” His grasp tightened on my shoulders. “No matter what they do to me, he keeps coming back, and all the fucked up shit I did, it’s going to disappear, right?” He laughed, but I noticed he was shaking, his hands kept creeping to the back of his head. “Can you imagine it, Elle?” His warm breath tickled my cheeks. “Forgetting everything?”

“Felix.”

“I’m not Felix,” his voice slurred a little. “Man. Now that I’m standing, and like, not doing anything productive, my head actually, like really fucking hurts…” He trailed off, and I caught beads of sharp red pooling from his nose. Swiping at his nose, the boy groaned. “Aww, come on! That’s not fair!” His eyes darkened, fear twisting his expression. “What, so when Kaz is in control, I start fucking dying? Is that what they want?” He tipped his head back, yelling at the ceiling. “Hey, assholes! Is this what you want?!” The boy choked on a laugh. “And once again, where are these guards? Are you all enjoying the show, huh?”

“Stop.” I didn’t mean to say it but speaking it out loud felt right.

Inclining his head, Felix frowned. “Stop what?”

“Talking!” I hissed. “You’re making yourself sicker by ranting like an idiot. Stop putting pressure on your brain and relax.” 

“Oh, yeah?” He scoffed. “Well, what if I don’t want to go to an emergency room? What if I want to die right in front of every bastard watching?”

“Felix—”

“No.” The boy shook his head, sniffling, slurring. “No, I really, really want to tell you that I… I’m… fuck, I don’t know!”

I found myself suffocated with accusations suddenly, my blood starting to boil. “You’re sorry.”

“Something like thaahhht.”

I nodded, swallowing hard. “Well, say it.”

Clarity seemed to find his eyes for a moment. “Will it make a difference? Will saying sorry really make you forgive me for not just ruining your life, but your family’s?” His tone turned ice-cold. “Do you even remember what I fucking did to them?”

Something squirmed down my spine. “I don’t understand what you’re saying.”

“Exactly.” He murmured. “You don’t want to accept my apology, and that is okay. Just let me… let me say it. I need to say it so it’s real, you know?”

His sudden vulnerability made my heart ache, and I found myself wondering why I couldn’t forgive the six year old boy engineered into Darkroom’s entertainment. Just like I had sensed his spiralling sanity inside the boy’s memories, I could feel them now; he was feeling hopeless. Inhuman. His flickering eyes found mine.  I saw the mental fight within him struggling with two sides of himself, or maybe he just wasn’t used to having empathy.  “I don’t think I can do say it right now.” Felix whispered. 

“Not here, I mean. With everybody watching, and these fucking ALARMS blaring,” he raised his voice over them and I couldn’t resist a small smile. “But I will say it. I promise.”

I knew he was struggling to fully register what he had done, his actions under Darkroom's control, and to my family and Annalise. I knew that talk was coming, but for now, I would focus on escaping and getting him to a doctor.  

Then we would talk. I don’t know what we would talk about. Maybe we wouldn’t. Maybe we would go our separate ways after escaping, but somehow it would still be enough closure. 

I could be at peace with who he was and what he had done, as long as he admitted that part of him was gone. The boy surprised me by holding his trembling hand for me to shake. I couldn’t tear my eyes from fresh rivers of red gushing from his nose. “But I do want you to know the real me. Soo, it’s nice to meet you, Elle,” he slurred with an easy smile through a mouthful of blood. “I’m Kaz.” The boy lifted his other hand in a lazy wave. “Hopefully we can be friends?”

I stared down at his hand, and then at his haemorrhaging nose, well aware of his debilitating mental state.  “You need to sit down.”

“Wait, no,” His eyes widened, and the boy tipped to the left. I had to grasp onto him. “You’re not Elle. You’re…” Felix’s head twitched slightly, our conversation forgotten. 

His dwindling mental state was scaring me, but the boy was still in there somewhere. Felix was reminding me of Annalise. Was this what had happened to her too? And was he, like her, going to lose his sanity? The thought of the redhaired woman with her needle-like prongs inside my sister’s head made me feel nauseous.

Felix was still coherent, thankfully. Though he was obviously dealing with a lot of mental trauma, which was playing with his head. He seemed to have a lightbulb moment, swiping at his mouth and nose, before striding over to the door in playful steps, like he was dancing. His movements once again eerily similar to how Annalise had acted. “They’re still watching us.”

“How?” I hissed. “Didn’t you get rid of all of the security cameras?”

The moment those words slipped from his lips, the alarms came to an abrupt stop, and the boy’s eyes lit up.

“They’re stopped.”

When I tried to speak, Felix lifted a finger to his lips in a shushing motion. He tried the handle, and to nobody’s surprise, it slid open with barely any effort. They were playing with us, I thought. Still grasping the pipe, I joined him, all of the breath caught in my throat. “It couldn’t be this easy, right?” I muttered. “They wouldn’t just let us go free knowing you’re still… you.”

Felix twisted to me with a grin. “You’re underestimating Darkroom’s obsession with getting good content. If broadcasting my descent into madness didn’t work, they’ll use our escape.” He made a face. “Again. Which must mean their audience likes us. Our dynamic. Which, of course, they don’t want to lose.” He grabbed my hand, squeezing it. It was wet and slick with his blood, and yet somehow I found his fingers entangled with mine comforting. “So, why don’t we give them what they want?”

“Which is what?”

The boy slipped through the gap in the door, dragging me with him. Just as I thought, the hallway was empty. There were doors parallel to each other. Felix took the lead, gesturing to the security cameras blinking down at us. 

“A show, of course. Every show has its season finale and consider this Brightwood’s. Darkroom have enough brainwashed kids fashioned into influencers. I’m sure they’ll find another Kaz and Elle.” He scoffed.  “Now, if we can just find Annalise and get the fuck out of here, we’ll be home free.” He said, quickening his pace. “She should be down here somewhere.” When he twisted around to frown at me, Felix was looking worse for wear. I wasn’t sure how long he’d be on his feet for—and I needed to find my sister.

“Where did they take her again?”

I thought back to the room with the human laughing track; townspeople turned into the laughing track which had haunted my skull. “She was in a room of laughing people,” I whispered.

He nodded. “That sounds ominous. Can you remember which room?”

Against my own judgement, I did. Somehow. However, when we crept inside and were greeted to an all-too-familiar cacophony of pained laughter, I couldn’t find her among rotting faces and decomposing bodies with flesh sliding off their bones, shredded skin and organs still on puppet strings—forced to laugh. 

These people were already dead, their bodies, their voice-boxes, being broadcasted alongside Brightwood. There were new faces. Young and old. Joey Cunningham and his father, and some kids from school. Whoever ended up inside the laughing-track room meant some part of them had come back, their real identity bleeding into them. I just had to hope when we escaped, we could save them too. “She’s not here,” I said, backing away. Felix was frowning at a woman whose face was peeling off with every jolt of her body when she screamed out a hysterical laugh. He wasn’t moving, his eyes wide, hands balled into fists at his side. “Felix.” I grabbed and pulled him away.

Further down the long, winding hallway, he let out a strangled breath, clawing at his face. “I think I… made that room. I mean, it’s kind of blurry, but when I was a little kid, this place was our playground. The other kids and I helped build our own torture rooms.”

I didn’t stop walking, a slither creeping its way down my spine. “You made the laughing-track room?”

Felix swiped at his nose and mouth, beads of red still creeping down his face no matter how many times he tried to staunch the bleed. He joined my side. “Yeah. I think it was a game I made with Sim. We wanted to see how long they could laugh for.”

“Then you know how to turn it off.” I said stiffly.

I noticed he was stumbling again, struggling to keep up, trying to staunch his nose. “Well, not exactly.”

“Meaning?”

“I helped design the program which makes them laugh,” he said shakily. “There’s a health and safety protocol overriding it. Even if I wanted to turn it off, I think I’d have to input some sort of code. And we were never told codes. I mean, why trust a bunch of sociopathic children with scary numbers?” He laughed, but it was more of a sob. “I’m sorry, Elle. I don’t know how.”

The boy buried himself in his arms, sobbing into the material of his sleeves.

“It’s…it’s okay.”

I was saying those words, but I didn’t mean them. How could it be okay? How could I just leave hundreds of people to rot away under a program he had created? “You can let them go after,” I said, more to myself than him. 

“When we escape, and we bring down this place—you’ll let them go.” I only had to see his expression to know it wasn’t as easy as that, and every person in that room was already dead. He was a kid, and he didn’t know better. 

In fact, his brain had been twisted and contorted to think in a certain way. 

But that didn’t stop me tightening my grasp on the pipe in my hands, and wondering, just for a second, if killing the root of Darkroom—which was him, would release me from their clutches. It would give them a show, sure. Darkroom had wanted me to kill Felix after forcing his memories onto me. Something acidic crept up my throat—and then I was wondering if it saving him was even possible. Bringing him into the outside world would surely put both myself and other people at risk. He was a psychopath, sorry or not. Empathy or not. Yes, Kaz still clung onto him, humanity still clung on. But he would never stop being Felix; would never get rid of that mindset drilled into him, and that fucking terrified me.

“In here.”

Felix’s hiss cut through my thoughts, snapping me back to reality. This time, he led me into the Redroom. Which looked just as horrifying as I remembered, from the boy’s memories. It was modernized, however, larger, with a cinematic screen filled with deep, dark red, and the line of surgical beds spread out in a certain formation. The room wasn’t empty. There was a girl sitting cross legged on her bed, rocking back and forth, her eyes on the screen. It wasn’t Annalise. 

From Felix’s expression, I could tell he knew the girl. I watched him take slow steps towards her, before seemingly changing his mind and twisting around.  I thought he was going to speak to her, before he took my arm gently, and led me back onto the hallway. “She’s not here,” he whispered. “If she’s not in the laughing track room or the Redroom—I think it’s pretty obvious where she will be.”

I nodded. “Back in Brightwood.”

“Having fun, Fee?”

The voice came from behind us. When I glimpsed the girl from the Redroom was poking her head out of the door. 

Her eyes were hollowed out, a twisted grin splitting her lips apart. She was a Darkroom OG. I could tell from the empty look in her expression, like every splinter of her had been drained away and replaced with the kind of darkness I didn’t know existed. This girl was what Felix was supposed to be. 

Like Sim, she was ethereally beautiful. The girl looked to be of Japanese descent, dark curls framing a heart shaped face, porcelain skin which likened her to a doll. The scarlet smudges on her nose and lips in contrast to her skin made her almost breathtaking to look at. 

She looked more doll-like than human, and I wondered if that was what Darkroom had moulded her into since childhood.  Her eyes found mine, her smile widening until it was stretching across her face. Something about this girl set my nerve-endings alight. There was nothing I could see. Just oblivion staring back at me. I thought I had only seen this expression in Felix in my memories when he brutally killed my family, but this girl was worse.

This girl didn’t know humanity, and I wasn’t even sure if she had even bene human. She was more of an inhuman creature, a shadow creeping at the corner of my eye. Her voice was a hysterical screech like a child. “Having fun playing with your little mouse?”

Felix didn’t turn around. “Fuck off, Yuna.”

“But… but aren’t you going to tell her?” the girl let out a squeaky laugh before slamming her hands over her mouth, mocking horror. “Oops! Spoilers!”

“Like I said, Yuna,” the boy rolled his eyes. “Fuck off.”

She pouted. “You’re bleeding, Fee-Fee.”

“And you’re annoying.”

The two of them reminded me of little kids.

“You need the emergency room, Fee!” She giggled. I glimpsed her fingers digging into the edge of the door, hard enough to draw blood. “Before your brain goes poof!” Her laugh grew louder into a hyperventilating squawk. “Poof! Bye-bye brain!”  

He kept going, pulling me with him. “Yeah. I know that.”

I expected the girl to follow us, but she just slipped back into the room, leaving us with one last chilling remark. “Spoilers, Fee! Spoilers, spoilers, spoilers!”
