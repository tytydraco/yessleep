Last week, me and my husband moved into a small house we bought deep in the country.

It was a nice change from our tiny, cramped apartment overlooking the bustling city we had called home for so many years. Until the sink started talking to me.

It started out as quiet murmurs whenever somebody turned the tap on, but I wrote it off as the plumbing. It *was* an old house after all. Until one morning, I woke up to get water for the coffee pot, and I heard her clear as day for the first time.

"Hello? Can you hear me? I need help, please."

I took a step back, bumping into the kitchen table and almost dropping the coffee pot. Then my husband, Harold, strolled into the room.

"Hey hun, where's the coffee? I gotta leave for work soon." He said, doing up his tie and buttoning his cuffs.

"Harold, I just heard a woman's voice coming from the sink."

"Babe, you're just hearing things. We were in the city a long time, your brain is just trying to fill in the gaps of silence with noise, look."

Harold cupped his mouth with his hands and hunched over the sink.

"HELLOOOOO DOWN THERE!!".

He paused before looking up at me with a big goofy grin. "See? Nobody dow-"

Harold's words were cut short by the garbage disposal grinding to life and catching his tie, pulling him into the sink in a death-grip.

*HOLY SHIT, HAROLD!* I tried flicking the switch next to the sink to turn off the machine, but it was no use. Thinking fast, I quickly ran over to the kitchen drawer to grab a pair of scissors, and began snipping away at the back of the tie, severing my husband from his pinstripe noose.

Harald took a couple of deep breaths as we watched the rest of the tie being sucked down the sink like a starving man slurping spaghetti. As soon as the tie was out of sight, the garbage disposal shut off.

"Woah, that was scary. I didn't know that thing was automatic" said Harold.

It wasn't. But I was too shaken up to let him know that.

Late that same night, I woke up totally parched and wandered into the kitchen for some water. I eyeballed the sink, but decided to grab something from the fridge instead.

As I rooted around for a bevy, I heard a soft, feminine voice from behind me.

"Hello? I know you're there. Please talk to me."

Startled, I turned around to face the sink.

"H-hello? Who are you? *What* are you?" I stammered out.

"My name is Melissa, and... I'm not sure what I am anymore." She sounded sad and tired.

"Okay" I said, trying to decide if I could make sense of what was going on, or if I had completely lost my mind. "You turned on the garbage disposal earlier, right? You could have killed my husband!"

"I'm sorry, but I don't trust men. I don't want you to go through what I did. My husband murdered me after I caught him having an affair. He cut my heart out and jammed it down the garbage disposal."

"I'm so sorry, that's awful" I said; also realizing I would need to have a chat with my realtor about how they failed to mention a fucking *murder* had taken place in this house.

"Earlier, you said you needed help, right?" I asked.

"Yes, it's an awfully big favor to ask. But please! I think you're my only hope to be set free".

I was a little taken aback.

"How?" I asked.

"My husband buried my remains somewhere under this house. I can't rest until they're properly buried. Please, I've been trapped in this sink for so long now." Melissa said, weeping.

"Well, how will I know where to look?"

"With your new eye" Melissa said. Then the tap turned on and began to run a fluorescent green liquid as she continued on. "Just cover one eye, and run the other under this this. Be sure to bandage it up and wrap it in gauze afterwards. In the morning, cut the bandages off and you'll have a new eye, one that can see all things dead and far into the other side."

I was a little shocked at her proposal. But I didn't know how shocked I could be. I *was* having a conversation with my kitchen sink. I approached the running faucet, hesitated, then held my hair behind my head with one hand, covered my right eye with the other and let the water trickle over my left.

The water had a weird tingling sensation to it. Like somebody was tickling the back of my eyeball with a feather and I desperately wanted to scratch it. I ignored the feeling until the water shut off.

"All done!" Melissa said gleefully. "I'm so excited for tomorrow! Quick, go bandage that bad boy up! I'll be waiting!"

I did just that. After dressing my eye, I felt lethargic and my body felt heavy. I shuffled my way back to bed and fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow.

When I woke up, everything felt wrong. I had a headache like a colony of fire-ants were throwing Coachella in my skull. I rolled over to see Harold had already gone to work. I looked past his spot on the mattress to the bedside clock, and saw it was almost 1pm.

I reached up to grab my throbbing temple, and felt the bandage I'd done up the night before. I walked out to the kitchen to grab some scissors and greeted Melissa, but she didn't respond.

*Maybe she can only talk at night?* I wondered, fumbling through the drawer for the scissors. I retrieved a pair and my headache began to worsen. I stumbled to the bathroom and did a double take when I got to the mirror.

My face looked gaunt and pale and my hair, previously voluminous and blonde, looked thin and brittle. I stifled a scream and opened the bathroom cabinet for some sort of painkiller, but everything was gone. Well, everything but a pair of nail clippers.

With a trembling hand, I focused my sights on the mirror and snipped the strand of bandage I had wrapped around my head, and unwound it until I was just looking at the gauze pad. I took a deep breath in, and began to peel it off.

I don't really know how to describe what I felt next. It was like an emotional cocktail of anger, sadness and disgust.

My iris, formally ice blue, was now a pale, milky, grey blotch. The rest of my eye was beyond a jaundice shade of yellow and looked more like a ball of rotten, coagulated turkey gravy left over from a thanksgiving's meal.

Another wave of pain surged throughout my head. I couldn't think anymore. I just had to act.

I ran into the kitchen and began screaming at Melissa, demanding to know what she had done to me. But again, there was no response. All I knew, was that I had to do something about that eye. The pain from it was blocking out all rational thought. I approached the drawer again, grabbed a spoon, and headed back to the bathroom.

It took several attempts to slide the spoon under my eye, but eventually I made it happen. When I tried to jimmy the spoon upwards to pop the eyeball out, the spoon simply slid through my pupil like jell-o. I made several more attempts, the pain worsening each time until I couldn't take it anymore and just jammed my index finger into the corner of my eye, hooked the optical nerve and pulled it out.

I reached down for the scissors where I placed them on the sink, but they were gone. I was in too much pain to keep looking for them and realized I would have to find another way to sever this abomination.

The spoon had slide through my eye no problem, but was too dull to saw through the cord. I tried stabbing at it several times as as it hung off my cheekbone, oozing yellow puss thick as dish soap with every thrust of the utensil.

That's when I remembered the nail clippers. I flung the cabinet open, grabbed them, and pulled my eyeball tight as I chewed away at the cord with them. After a painful minute or so that stretched on for an eternity, the cord snapped and shot back into my head like an elastic band. And I was left alone, lying on the cool, quiet, tile floor, clutching the smashed remains of my eyeball in my hand.

I crawled back out into the kitchen and began pleading for Melissa to talk to me. But instead of her soft, kitten-like voice, I heard a deep booming laugh echoing off the walls.

I'm terrified and don't know what to do now. All the doors and windows are locked, and every time I try to call Harold I just hear that fucking deep laugh. It's pitch black outside, so black it's like my house is sitting in a void. None of the clocks are working either, even the one on my phone keeps sporadically changing.

I summoned all my strength to go back and look in the bathroom mirror and saw a ghostly little figure in the dark hole where my eye was. Laughing, taunting, and beckoning me into my own skull. None of this makes any sense. I even googled the house and there was only one previous owner. No Melissa, no murder.

I'm looking worse with I can only assume is every hour passing. This has to be some kind of demon, but what? Do any of you have some advice?
