When I was younger, bedtime was always a difficult and scary thing for me. I wasn’t scared of the dark, but rather something entirely sinister in its own right.

My young mind always chalked it up to dreaming or my family playing jokes on me. Looking back, I feel like an absolute idiot for even thinking that my family members would go through the effort of trying to mess with me so late into the night.

Well, family *member*, I should say. It was just me and my mom growing up.

Mom was an artist, or, at least, she was super into artsy stuff when I was younger. She was particularly interested in the making of clothes. Consequently, we had a few mannequins in the house. They’d always stay in her study where she used them for fitting.

I wish we could have realized what was happening sooner.

Often, I’d have bad dreams. Terrifying experiences that my mind conjured up when I went to sleep. I think that was why it was so hard to come to terms with it. It was also the main reason why going to bed was such a difficult task for me. I’m still not sure whether the first couple were nightmares or not.

I vividly remember all three times I experienced it.

The first time it happened, I didn’t think much of it. I’d gotten into bed and was actually able to fall asleep without much trouble. What didn’t happen so easily was staying asleep. At first, it was blackness. And then my eyes opened.

I was in my room, still in my bed. Something was different, though. My room was much darker than it’d been a few hours earlier, which made sense, considering it just naturally got darker the later it was.

That wasn’t what scared me, though. What scared me so badly I hid under the covers was a figure standing in the middle of my bedroom. The only reason I could even see them was due to the faint bits of moonlight streaming in from between my blinds.

I looked at the figure just long enough to make out some slight details on what they were wearing. They stood stock-still, clad in a pair of black—what I assumed to be—dress pants and a white shirt with black stripes. That was it. I couldn’t make out their face, not that it mattered. They just stood there, motionless. I didn’t suppress a scream, rather, I couldn’t. I was so completely and utterly terrified in that very moment that I could do nothing but retreat into my covers and wait until it went away.

I might have fallen asleep. Not sure, can’t really remember. All I do remember is hiding under my covers one moment and waking up to a brightly sun-lit room the next. The figure was gone; so I assumed I’d had a dream.

I still wasn’t sure, so I asked my mom about it during breakfast. 

“Hey mom.” I  said. “Did you—did you put one of your mannequins in my room?”

Her face went from calm to nervous. “What? No, of course not. Why would you ask that?”

“Oh, okay.” I said. “It was probably a dream then.”

“What?” She asked.

“It looked like a person in my room, but I could barely see them or anything. When I woke up, it didn’t look like anyone had been in my room. I think it was dream.” I said.

“Hmm.” She said. “Sounds weird. You let me know if anything happens, okay?”

“Okay.”

I feel the need to state that my mother is not, and has never been a stupid person. She thought out the possibilities. She searched the whole house after we talked and found nothing. She couldn’t have thought that my dreams, though vivid, might have not been just dreams. But I digress. There was no way anyone could have broken in. She even checked our cellar and the parts of it we refused to go in. Nothing.

The fact that she found nothing makes what happened even harder to think of—to explain, but I’ll do my best.

The last incident happened about a week after the first. I had just gotten to sleep and was having a relatively good dream when it was interrupted.

This time, there was an actual noise. I woke up to the sound of my alarm clock falling off my dresser and crashing to the floor. I was sure that I’d kept it well away from the edge of my dresser, but I could have been wrong. Thinking that I’d just placed it too haphazardly, I undid my covers a little and leaned out and down to pick it up.

I recoiled in horror. There, sticking out slightly from under my bed, was an arm. Not a severed one, it was clearly attached to someone. The alarm clock hadn’t landed near the hand, so I couldn’t make it out, but I just assumed it was a similar situation to the one I’d experienced a week prior.

The light glow of my alarm clock showed me that the arm belonged to the same figured I’d seen. The same white shirt with black stripes. I shot back and once again retreated to the safe space that was my blanket. I shut my eyes tight. Somehow, despite the unyielding terror I’d felt witnessing that very same figure under my bed, I managed to fall asleep.

The next morning, mom was pissed. I’d gone downstairs for breakfast, once again preparing to tell her about what I thought might’ve been a dream. She was in a mood, though. Apparently, some animal had been messing around outside our house and broke one of the windows leading into the cellar.

She was grumbling about two things. One—the fact that whatever animal had broken the window might’ve still been in the cellar. When she’d checked, some items had been shuffled around, most notably near the dark crawl space-like area. Two—how she was going to afford to fix the window. Both her and I found out that she wouldn’t need to worry about getting it repaired when I tried to speak to her.

“What?!” She snapped.

“I—um.” I stuttered.

“Sorry.” She said. “Just a little peeved about the window. What do you want to tell me?”

“I saw it again.” I said. “The figure. I think I was dreaming?”

“You dream about that a lot.” She said. “Do you remember anything from it?”

“It was wearing one of the striped shirts you made.” I said.

My mother’s face went still. She didn’t speak much just then. When she did, though, it was serious. She grabbed me by the hand and we moved towards the front door. As I was getting my shoes on, I asked her a question.

“Why are you upset?”

She didn’t answer until we were out of the house and in her car. As she started it, she looked at me and spoke with a very serious tone.

“I didn’t do that. I never made any striped shirts.”

We moved out that same day.
