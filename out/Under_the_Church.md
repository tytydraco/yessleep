They say St. Elias Church was built on consecrated ground. But I never felt God in that place—just a silence too deep, like something old was listening and waiting to be worshipped again.



My sister died right outside its doors. Slipped on the steps one icy November night and cracked her skull. We were altar kids. She died holding her bible in her hand. Father Brennan said it was God’s will. I stopped believing that very day.



It started when Father Brennan stopped showing up to Sunday service. For fifteen years he’d been there, rain or shine. But two weeks ago, the doors were locked, and no one answered the rectory bell. Some said he’d gone on retreat. Others whispered about his age catching up with him. But I lived right across the street, and I’d heard something that made my stomach crawl.



Chanting. Not the usual type of chanting you would expect at a church. Something about this chanting sounded off. Dark. It had made my skin crawl.



Late at night, soft and rhythmic; too low to understand the words being chanted, but loud enough to keep you awake. I thought maybe I was letting my imagination get the best of me. Maybe he was just deep in prayer. But then came the night that I saw the light.



A crimson glow was pulsing behind the stained-glass windows like a heartbeat. No candles. Just a red glow that burned so bright.



The next morning, I couldn’t stop myself. Not after that red glow. Not after everything I’d buried for years began clawing its way back up. If something was wrong inside that church, I needed to see it. I needed to know if the place that took my sister had finally cracked open. The front door creaked open when I knocked. Inside, it smelled like rot, like wet wood and something... more ancient. I called out, but only my echo responded. I felt sick to my stomach when I saw the holy water. It had curdled into a black sludge, bubbling faintly as if a dark sacrament was being performed. Right before my eyes, the crucifix above the altar had been turned upside down, but not by human hands—the wood itself had warped and bent back upon itself. Looking around me, I could see that the pews were askew. It was like they'd been violently shoved aside by something immense moving through the nave.



But the altar was what disturbed me the most. It was cracked down the center, like a stone tomb forced open from below. Around it, the broken remains of communion wafers lay scattered like chips of bone. The chalice had tipped, spilling something. What it spilled looked far thicker than wine. Upon closer examination, it looked like blood.



The fresco above the chapel’s door showed the Virgin Mary holding the infant Christ but someone had scratched out the child and replaced it with a mass of black, curling eyes. Beneath it, a Latin inscription had been crudely carved into the stone: “Verbum caro factum est… et non est redemptio.”



(The Word became flesh… and there is no redemption.)



There were scratch marks on the floor, clawed into the stone. And a trail of dried blood led toward the side chapel. Every instinct screamed to run. But if I left now, I’d never stop wondering. I had to go down. I had to see. I had to know.



Behind the chapel, I found a trapdoor I’d never noticed before. No lock, just an iron ring set into the wood. The blood trail ended there. 



When I opened it, a blast of air hit me, wet and fetid, like an animal’s breath. A narrow staircase wound down into blackness.



The chanting began to grow louder. I lit my phone flashlight and stepped down. At the bottom was a stone room. Suddenly, the chanting stopped.



Father Brennan stood in the center of the room, arms raised, face radiant like some divinely blessed saint, except the blood running down his chin told another story. His mouth twitched into an unnaturally wide grin.



"I thought it was God," he said, weeping. "But it was never God." His robes were soaked in blood, and his face was... wrong. Like it had been altered in some way. His eyes looked wild. His mouth twisted into a smile too wide for his skull.



He looked at me and spoke: "Forgive me, child, for I have sinned. I mistook its voice for God’s.” His collar had fused to his throat—flesh and cloth morphed into one. His Bible was still clutched in his hand, but the pages were blank, covered instead in thin membranes that twitched as if with breath. "I let it in", he said.



“It was never exorcised,” he continued, choking on blood. “Only entombed.”



The church wasn’t built to honor God. It was built to bury something else. To trap a god-shaped thing too vast and old to understand. And it lied dormant until enough faith pooled around it to wake it again.



Behind him, the shadows began to twist. Something emerged from the darkness. It stood where the pulpit had once been, as if poised to deliver a sermon to the damned. Its body rippled like vestments in the wind. Its head looked like a stained-glass window, but the faces within it screamed silently, mouths moving in grotesque mock-prayer. As I stared, my ears filled with whispers; twisted verses that sounded almost familiar… until I realized they were prayers spoken backward.



I saw it standing where the pulpit once was, hands spread wide like a priest giving the homily. It spoke in strange tongues, words unraveling in the air like corrupted and cursed scriptures. I understood none of it, and yet, deep in my soul, it felt somehow sacred. I began to feel as if I had somehow forgotten the true faith, and now was about to be baptized or consumed by it.



It whispered in a dozen tongues.



It feeds on faith the way fire feeds on wood; not hatefully, just hungrily. The more you believe, the more it whispers, promising meaning, miracles, reunion with the dead. And when you give in... it takes more than your soul. It takes your silence. Your awe. Your worship.



It wore vestments made of shadow, stitched with stolen voices. Its face was like a living stained-glass window—each shifting fragment a worshipper who’d given far too much. Their mouths moved in silent prayer. Their eyes never blinked. And when it turned toward me, I heard my own voice join the choir.



The longer I stood there, the more I somehow remembered things I’d never done. I remembered kneeling. I remembered chanting. I remembered its name; not in words so much as in dark surrender.



I turned and ran. Up the stairs, across the chapel, and out into the street. I didn’t look back, not even when I heard the trapdoor slam shut behind me.



That was a week ago. They condemned the church for “structural damage.” But in a way, they didn’t bury what was underneath. They just handed it off… to me.



Because now, at night, I hear the chanting again. And this time, it’s not just from the church.



Now the chanting follows me. And when I open the cellar door of my house, I swear I see faint candlelight, flickering like a vigil. Last night, I found a crucifix at the foot of the stairs—burning, but not consumed.



It doesn’t need to chase me. It knows where I live now. It knows how long I’ve gone without praying. And it knows I’m ready to believe in something again.



I think it wants me to build a church.



Down in my cellar.
