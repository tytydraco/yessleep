Let’s get one thing straight right off the bat: I never intended, nor did I ever want to become the devil’s son in-law. Yes, THAT devil. The big D, Satan, Lucifer, lord of all evil and father of lies, not to mention about a thousand wickedly beautiful daughters, and now, my honest-to-God father in-law. Don’t tell him I said it that way though, he really doesn’t like it when someone brings up the big man upstairs.

It began a year ago, at a Halloween party. It was fantastic. It was a massive affair in a rented warehouse, fully decked out in the most outrageous Halloween decorations that money could buy. The smoke machine was working overtime to create a fog effect. Animatronic horrors of all shapes and sizes were scattered along every conceivable surface. There were bleeding trees in a literal pool of blood. The ceiling was made to look like the night sky on a full moon with bats, ghosts, demons, and witches flying about. Whether these were animatronics or projections I neither knew nor cared.

One end of the warehouse had a raised stage with a massive DJ set-up, and, and a regionally famous DJ was spinning and mixing vinyl in an eerie yet energetic mix that was both atmospheric and highly danceable. I could feel the music in my very bones, and it practically hypnotized my feet, compelling me to dance.

There were over a thousand people in attendance, all by exclusive invitation, and I was one of them. Everyone was dressed in the best costumes they could buy or create, and many of them were so convincing that they could have passed for the genuine article. That’s why I thought nothing of it when the most beautiful woman I ever laid eyes upon wearing a sexy succubus costume approached me to dance.

When I say beautiful, I don’t merely mean “beautiful”. Truly, the word fails to do justice to the otherworldly creature who chose me, of all people, to be her dance partner for the night. Her every curve was sheer perfection. Her skin was flawless and glowing. Her hair was thick, luxurious, and almost ethereal in the way it moved without once ever having so much as a single strand fall out of place. The way she moved simply oozed passion. Her sweet and lilting voice had just a hint of huskiness that made sweet, sweet love to my eardrums with every word she spoke. Her touch was electric, and her smell . . . how could I possibly describe it? It had the sweetness of flowers, the freshness of an early spring breeze, the smokiness of smoldering hickory, and a number of unnamable notes that blended together to seduce my sinuses and enrapture my mind.

Her costume fit her like it was part of her. She had short, curved horns on her head, set near the front of her hairline, and she did a fantastic job blending the spot where the base of the horns met her head. They looked completely natural. The same goes for her tail. It had a proper fleshy quality, didn’t drag the ground, and looked to have a motor system built in that allowed it to move like it was alive, and not a simple prosthetic connected to her spine jut above the vivacious curve of her firm, round buttocks. She had a modest pair of leathery black wings affixed to her back in between her shoulder blades. Not only were they expertly attached and blended, but they moved so naturally that they seemed to be a part of her. Her skin was flushed pink, not cartoonishly pink, but a deep, fleshy pink, like a perfect blush, as though it were dyed multiple times to achieve the perfect color, tone, and luminosity. She topped it all off with a scandalously short black leather miniskirt, and equally scandalously short, and low-cropped halter top that buttoned together over her shoulders so it could be worn with her wings.

To this day I still have no idea why she chose me. I can’t even imagine what drew her to me, out of all people. Frankly, I’m nothing special. Sure, I’m fit, but that has more to do with being a young man in my twenties than any special athleticism. I have all my hair, but it’s ordinary brown and mostly straight, cropped short and neat. My face isn’t bad to look at, but far from one that naturally draws attention from the ladies. I’m ordinary, although in hindsight, that might be exactly the quality that first drew her to me.

Still, choose me she did, making eye contact from halfway across the warehouse, and walking right to me, ignoring all others on her way to demand that I be her dance partner for the night. I didn’t care in the least that she demanded rather than asked. Every last inch of her, every millimeter, every micron, screamed desire, and I listened. Like any foolish young man, I listened.

The party was a blur of rapture and sensation. We danced a lot, talked little, and touched each other constantly, so when three AM rolled around and she suggested that we go back to my place and finish what we started, I was all in.

I don’t remember anything about the drive home other than the fact that every minute of the five mile drive was an agony of desire that demanded to be fulfilled. She touched me the whole drive, funning her fingers up and down my head, neck, torso, and leg in a manner that not only teased and tantalized my body, but promised to make good on what they suggested once we got home.

I’m sorry if all I sound like so far is a mindlessly horny dude being led around by his little man, but this is how it all began, and in my defense, her unnatural beauty, allure, and sheer animal magnetism overloaded my brain because, well, it really was unnatural, but how was I supposed to know that?

Once we got to my apartment, we threw all restraint and modesty to the wind. It struck me that as she shed her clothing, she kept the costume prosthetics on, but I didn’t mind. Actually, if anything, they made her even more desirable, so I didn’t question it, I enjoyed it. Without going into details because this isn’t that kind of story, we spent the next three hours engaged in the most passionate and delightfully filthy activity, and I realized very early on that this woman utterly ruined me for anyone else as there was no possible way any other woman could compare to her qualities, and when we were done, we fell asleep with our bodies entangled as though we would never let each other go.

I discovered the reason for this upon waking up, and what began as a fun party topped off with reckless passion turned fully and horrifyingly surreal.

I awoke that afternoon to a startling sight. As my eyes opened, I first saw the lovely form of the woman in my arms, all of her costume prosthetics still perfectly in place. I barely had time to wonder at how she managed to attach them so well that they stayed on throughout last night’s activities and the hours of sleep that followed before I noticed someone else standing at my bedside with arms crossed and staring at us both with a disapproving glare.

The bleariness of having only just woken was flushed away in an instant as alarm bells went off in my head at the fact there was an uninvited stranger in my bedroom. I shot up in bed, screaming in surprise and fear, not knowing what this stranger’s intentions were, but knowing that they couldn’t possibly be good. Nobody breaks into another person’s home with good intentions.

My sudden movements and loud screaming woke up the woman lying next to me, and she reacted less with surprise and fear than with annoyance. She glanced at me briefly as she awoke, turned her head, saw the stranger, and sat up quickly.

“Daddy!” she chided the man. “Why must you always do this?”

The word sunk into my ears and rattled around in my brain like a ping pong ball gone wild. This man was her father? He didn’t look a day over thirty, had the ideal medium build with a trim waistline and obvious physical strength without being too bulky, had fine, slightly sharp, even facial features, and a full head of thick black hair that was as neatly trimmed as his fine goatee.

“Daddy?” I questioned, bewilderment overriding my fear.

“Don’t call me that!” the man stated sharply. “I’m Lucifer to you.”

Lucifer? The name rang out in my mind. The situation was ludicrous, and my initial fear became mixed with indignation. Forgetting my modesty I stood up. “I don’t care what your name is or why you did it, you can’t break into my home like this!”

I intended to say more, but the man, Lucifer, simply raised his hand, one index finger up in a dismissive gesture, and my voice caught in my throat, rendering me speechless.

“Every year, Lilly.” He said with extreme disappointment in his voice. “You do this every year. What am I supposed to do with you?”

The woman, Lilly, and yes, she told me her name the night before, sat up in bed without the slightest bit of modesty or shame in front of this man claiming to be her father. “Give me what I want,” she said with a pretty pout.

Lucifer sighed in exasperation and sank down into the chair I kept against the wall for putting on my socks and shoes in the morning. He lowered his head, which I only just then noticed had horns attached to it, longer and more curved than the ones Lilly wore, and rubbed his temples with his fingertips. I also noticed that his fingernails were longer than a man typically wears, sharp, and colored black at the base, gradually shifting to red at the tips. After a few moments he turned to look at me with a combination of frustration and disdain. “Do you see what I have to deal with?” he asked, gesturing toward Lilly with his right hand. “Such a stubborn and rebellious daughter!”

I couldn’t reply. My voice remained stuck, frozen and useless. I could only turn my head to look at the perfect creature sitting naked in my bed. Even in this strange and frankly horrifying experience, I found myself wanting her, liking nothing in the world more than the sight of her bare before me. It made no sense. How could I be horny just then? I should have felt nothing but sheer horror, not just because of the break in, and not also because the man calling himself Lucifer somehow had the power to silence me at will, but because it was beginning to dawn on me who Lucifer actually was, and that Lilly’s costume might not be a costume at all, and her prosthetics were not just realistic fakes, but actually natural parts of her body.

Before you judge me for failing to realize this the night before when any reasonable person would have noticed that something was off when they stayed perfectly in place and moved naturally even in the most vigorous of activities, please consider the extent of young male horniness, and how it can easily wipe away all sense and reason, especially with a woman as enthralling as Lilly. In other words, my mind was focused on other things.

“She has one job!” Lucifer continued without noticing my inability to respond. “One job! And every year ignores her responsibilities and goes off to do her own thing!”

He turned his attention to Lilly, who still had made no move to cover herself. “You’re such a rebellious daughter!” he scolded.

Lilly scoffed. “I am my father’s daughter,” she replied mockingly. “What do you expect?

Lucifer turned his attention back to me. “See? She has no respect for me. What would you do in my situation?”

I opened my mouth to respond, and no sound came out.

“Really dad?” Lilly mocked. “He can’t talk. You silenced him, remember?”

Lucifer sighed in exasperation, again. “Fine, speak.” He commanded resignedly.

With that, my voice returned to me, not that it did much good.

“What’s going on here? How did you . . . why . . . are you really the devil?”

I spoke in a confused, jumbled mess of words, not knowing what was more important, or more preposterous than the other. The entire situation was simply surreal and couldn’t be real. At least, in that moment, it’s what I hoped. I hoped it was a dream, a nightmare, and that I would wake up peacefully with the most beautiful creature in the world in my arms, and an unknown future filled with blissful possibilities before me.

I wasn’t that fortunate.

Lucifer turned again toward Lilly. “See?” he stated more than asked. “Mortals are so . . . inferior. Yet you insist on crossing the line from tempting them to sin to actually engage in sin with them. It makes no sense!”

Lilly laughed. “Because they’re delightful, daddy. He’s delightful. You just can’t understand it.”

I felt both flattered and insulted at the same time. They were both talking about me as though I were an inferior creature, but Lilly still defended me, or at least complemented me. “Hold on!” I demanded, somehow finding my courage amidst the confusion. “What exactly is going on here? I deserve an explanation!”

Lilly’s eyes went wide, and Lucifer turned to regard me with an indignant glare. “You dare take that tone with me?” he threatened. “Do you understand who I am?”

Something broke inside me at that, and any sense of fear I once had got swept aside as the sheer rudeness and pride of this man managed to irk me to no end. “You call yourself Lucifer. The name of the devil himself. You have the ability to break into my home, and feel perfectly entitled to do so, and you somehow have the power to take away my ability to speak, which . . .” I trailed off at this, “is the only part that I can’t explain by some natural means. So how about you drop the bravado, show me a little respect, and tell me plainly just what in the blazing hell is going on here!”

Lilly held her breath as if she expected something deeply unpleasant to happen. Lucifer glared at me in silence for an uncomfortably long while, then, slowly, his lips curled in a grin, not an evil grin, not a mischievous grin, but a genuine, amused grin.

“You have balls, for a mortal,” he said with a hint of admiration. “I’ll make you a deal. Normally, I would kill you right now, send you to Hell, and set your soul ablaze personally. I’ve done it plenty of times before. But I’m going to give you a chance. We’ll have a nice little chat, and when it’s over, maybe I’ll spare you, maybe I won’t, but it’s the only chance you’ll get. Deal?”

He extended his hand, waiting for me to reply.

I don’t know what possessed me in that moment. Maybe I’m braver than I think. Maybe I just understood the truth of my situation and accepted it. Regardless, I reached out, took his hand in mine, feeling the unnatural heat radiating out from it, and shook it firmly. “Deal,” I agreed.

I felt a strange sensation, as if my soul itself changed in some way in response to the bargain I had just agreed to, and somehow, I knew on the deepest level that I had entered into an unbreakable contract, and my fate depended entirely on the interaction to come.

Lilly exhaled, relief washing over her features, and I could have sworn I detected just a hint of hope in them as well.

I turned and went to my closet.

“Just what are you doing?” Lucifer inquired with annoyance.

“I’m getting dressed,” I replied firmly. “You may not mind talking to a naked stranger, but I mind being that naked stranger. If you want to talk, let’s at least both be dressed.”

Lucifer rolled his eyes, clearly indicating his complete lack of concern for my state of dress or undress, but did nothing to stop me.

“You want something to wear?” I asked Lilly. “They’ll be loose, but I have some shorts and tee shirts that should fit you.”

Lilly’s cheeks blushed an even deeper pink at this. “How considerate of you,” she purred. “But I’m fine like this. Besides, if this goes badly for you, I want to be the last thing you see and desire.”

Her response was pleasing, frightening, complementary, and casually insulting all at the same time. She seemed far too familiar and comfortable with the situation, as if she expected the worst and thought that her nude form would be some comfort to me when her father freed me of my mortal coil.

I’d be lying if I said I didn’t like it.

I dressed quickly in jeans and a polo, and yes, I remembered my undergarments.

“Ready?” Lucifer asked impatiently.

“Yes,” I replied. “Now, for the love of all that’s unholy, what exactly is going on here?”

That wasn’t what I intended to say. I intended to say, “for the love of all that’s holy”, but somehow, as if some power demanded it, the word holy was replaced with unholy. My expression shifted to one of puzzlement as I noted the involuntary alteration.

Seeing my expression, Lilly spoke up. “There are things you can’t say in my father’s presence,” she explained. Any words that explicitly reference the one who cast him down to Hell are either silenced or adjusted. You’ll get used to it if he lets you live.”

While I appreciated the answer, I really didn’t the whole bit about “if” he let me live.

Lucifer relaxed in his seat and intertwined his fingers in front of his chin. “Here’s the situation,” he began in an even, gentle, soothing tone. “I’m literally the devil. Yes, lord of evil, source of all sin, and ruler of Hell. Lilly is my daughter, one of my many daughters, and the only one who can’t seem to just do her job and tempt mortals into sin.”

“I do my job!” Lilly protested.

“Not without breaking the rules!” Lucifer scolded. “The rules matter! The rules are everything!” He turned his attention back to me. “Do you have any idea how many times she’s done this?” he asked.

I was unclear on exactly what “this” was, but it definitely involved Lilly engaging in carnal relations with men. The greater details though, those I had no idea.

“No,” I replied, shaking my head.

“Too many,” Lucifer replied. “In fact, she’s done this every year since Halloween was invented. Can you believe that?”

“No,” I said, still not fully understanding, but trying to remember how old Halloween was. Hundreds of years? A thousand? More?

“Lily used to be my best daughter. She did her job to perfection.  Tempting mortals to engage in all manner of sexual sins. Using their base desires to create conflict, betrayal, self-harm, harm to others, and ultimately leading them down paths of hedonism that led straight to the pits of Hell where they serve an eternal sentence of torment separated from all hope, pleasure, or even relief as their souls burn for all eternity.”

“I still do that!” Lilly protested.

Lucifer ignored her. “She did that. Her sisters all did that. Her sisters still do. But there’s one rule. Tempt, but do not engage. Do you understand what that means?”

“It means they don’t get to have sex,” I replied with more certainty than I felt.

“Exactly!” Lucifer replied. “But then you mortals created a holiday where you dress up as monsters, demons, and whatever else your puny minds can imagine up, and Lilly, my dear Lilly, my best daughter who has led the most men and women into sexual sin by far, decided to exploit the fact that you take one day a year to disguise yourselves to manifest herself in the physical world, and enjoy the very pleasures she’s SUPPOSED to merely lead mortals into engaging in. Do you know what that means?”

I truly had no idea. “It means she needs a man?” I said uncertainly.

“Yes!” Lilly squealed.

“NO!” Lucifer shouted. “It means she’s breaking the law. You don’t break the law in eternity! There are consequences!”

“There are consequences here too,” I replied. “But let’s suppose everything you’re saying is true, and Lilly has had sex with hundreds-“

“Thousands,” Lilly Interrupted.

I took a deep breath, letting the full meaning of her interruption sink in. “Okay, thousands of men. One man a year for thousands of years. What are you going to do? Send her to Hell? Send her to H- . . . Pa- . . . the other place?”

Lucifer sighed in resignation. “That’s the problem now, isn’t it? Lilly was born in Hell and has lived there her entire life. She comes here, to the mortal world to tempt mortals with all manner of lustful sins and aberrations, and she cannot possibly go to the other place. If I exile her to the mortal world, it won’t be a punishment for her. She would thoroughly enjoy it. Probably make it her mission to sleep with every man and woman in the world, and love every minute of it. If I ground her, keep her at home, she’ll be perfectly happy and comfortable, and Hell loses out on the souls of the mortals that she would have tempted into eternal damnation if she weren’t on restriction. And she would just go back to her old habits once I let her back on the job anyway. I learned that long ago. Do you understand my predicament?”

“Actually, I do,” I replied confidently, “Its a damned if you do, damned if you don’t situation. Literally. So, based on your threats, your answer has been to murder every last one of Lilly’s lovers, and you came here today fully intending to do the same to me before, as you said, personally setting my soul aflame in Hell, assuming this is all true and I’m not dreaming or hallucinating this whole thing. And also assuming that you’re really who you say you are. What proof do you have that you’re the real devil and not just some home-invading, murdering psychopath who thinks he’s the devil?”

“Proof?” Lucifer asked incredulously. He turned toward Lilly. “The balls on this one, talking to me that way!”

Lilly merely smiled in response.

Turning back to me, he said “You want proof? I’ll give you proof!”

With this he raised his right hand, snapped his fingers, and my bedroom, my apartment, the whole world vanished in a blinding flash. My vision swam and sparkled for a minute, and when I could see again, I found myself standing on a raised dais overlooking a vast plain of sulfurous flames accompanied by screams and wailing.

Lilly, still naked as the day she was born, walked up to me and wrapped her arms around me in a sweet embrace before linking her arms around my left arm as she leaned into me.  “How delightful!” she happily exclaimed. “Daddy’s never brought one of my boyfriends home before, at least while he was still alive!”

“Home?” I stated stupidly, entirely dumbfounded by the impossible scene before me, the fact that everything Lucifer had claimed was true rapidly sinking into my brain, complete with all the subtext and repercussions. “It’s all real . . . this really is Hell.”

“You’re damn right this is Hell,” Lucifer declared proudly. “My home. My kingdom. The place where all damned souls go to burn for their crimes for all eternity.”

 “Isn’t it lovely?” Lilly purred sweetly into my ear, sending a tingle of pleasure into my already overwhelmed brain.

Polite. Yes, polite was definitely the way to go. Do not insult the devil, or his ridiculously beautiful daughter.

“Yes, in a . . . horrifying sort of way,” I said slowly, carefully.

“I know, right?” Lilly happily replied.

Lucifer stared me up and down. He glanced from me to Lilly, assessing us both, but mostly me for an uncomfortably long time. “The mortal has taste,” he finally conceded. “And he was right about how my way of handling things has been ineffective.”

He paused in thought, and I waited nervously, but making sure that I kept it on the inside, showing no signs of the abject fear and uncertainty I felt inside.

“Okay,” He finally decided. “It’s time to try something different.”

He turned his gaze to Lilly and looked her in the eyes. “Okay. You can keep him,” He declared. “The wedding will be in six hours.”

Lilly squealed in delight and began to excitedly bounce up and down as she clung to my arm even harder.

I was dumbfounded. “The . . . wedding?” I asked, still not sure I’d heard him right.

“Yes, the wedding,” Lucifer replied with finality. “We have rules in eternity, and rules are rules for a reason, and while my daughter is supposed to, no, required to tempt mortals to sin, she can’t just live in it herself. So if she wants you, she has to marry you, and all that it gives and requires of her, and you, comes with it.”

“Do I have a choice?” I blurted out without thinking.

Set aside the fact that I just found out that the woman I spent a night of pure bliss with was a literal demoness. Set aside the fact that her father is literally the Devil himself. Ignore the fact that no woman on earth could hope to compare to her womanly charms. I didn’t really know her. All I knew about her was who she was, which was a huge surprise in and of itself, and that she is the most . . . delectable and physically desirable woman imaginable. Sure, it was tempting, but it’s not enough. Not enough to get married for.

Although . . . I could certainly think of worse fates. In fact, the worse fate was literally all around me, filling my nose with smoke and my ears with the tortured screams of the damned. That still didn’t make that agreeing to spending a lifetime bound to a lust demon anything short of a wild gamble.

Lilly was taken aback by my question. She disengaged from my arm and gave me an angry look. “You don’t want me?” she demanded.

“I do,” I said honestly, and, frankly, fully terrified of the consequences of any other answer. “But We only just met. Isn’t marriage kind of . . . fast?”

Lilly’s face clouded with genuine confusion. “Fast?” she asked.

“It’s a mortal thing,” Lucifer chimed in. “Mortals exist in a continuum of time. Everything for them is orderly from start to finish, and incredibly restricted as a result. It’s nothing like eternity.”

Lilly seemed to understand. She nodded her head, and the anger left her face. “A mortal thing,” she repeated slowly.

I didn’t understand. “You don’t think this is fast?” I asked.

Lucifer got a patient look on his face for the first time since this weirdly tantalizing nightmare that literally landed me in Hell began. He addressed Lilly. “Go tell your mother and get ready. I’m going to have a talk with your mortal. Lord of Hell to potential son in-law.”

I know it’s strange, but despite Lucifer telling me that Lilly was his daughter, I never once considered that she had a mother. Blame it on the weirdness of the situation coupled with the mind-numbing horror of being threatened with eternal torture by the Devil himself, and I’m sure you can understand why this consideration escaped me up to this point.

Lilly gave an excited squeal and vanished without a trace.

“What the-“ I began.

“It’s not teleportation, at least not the way you understand it,” Lucifer interrupted. “Time isn’t a thing in eternity, so we can be anywhere or everywhere in what would appear to be all at once to a mortal.”

“I guess that makes sense,” I replied.

“Of course it does, to a mind capable of understanding eternity,” he said dismissively. “So not yours. You’re just a mortal with mortal limitations. But you should be able to at least get a vague idea of the concept.”

“It means you exist outside, so the rules of time don’t apply to you,” I replied defensively.

Lucifer scoffed. “In the crudest possible terms, yes. It must be that way. How else do you think we do our job of tempting every mortal on Earth all the time? Existing in time would make that impossible, but because we exist in eternity, we don’t follow the same rules that you mortals are forced into, but we still have rules, and our rules are absolute!”

I looked at him blankly, not knowing what to say.

“Walk with me,” Lucifer commanded more than requested. “We need to have a proper talk, and it’s going to be easier for you to grasp if you aren’t standing around looking like a stunned cow.”

We walked together, in silence at first. We walked to the edge of the dais we were on, and without any kind of transition, found ourselves walking along a black stone path that wound its way through walls of flame.

“Why can’t I feel the heat?” I asked. “With this much fire I should be burnt to a crisp.”

Lucifer nodded. “Yes,” he replied matter-of-factly. “You should. But you aren’t because you’re not here as one of the damned . . . yet.”

Something clicked in my head. “So, because I’m not dead, the fires of Hell don’t hurt me.”

“Exactly!” Lucifer replied with genuine satisfaction. “Maybe you aren’t as stupid as I think you are.”

I didn’t bother reacting to the insult. “Mind telling me why you want me to marry your daughter after I’ve known her for less than a day?”

Lucifer scoffed. “A day, a millennium, what’s the difference? What matters is that you have a choice, and the reason you have a choice is your mortality.”

Like everything that had happened since waking up, this made very little sense to me. “Why does my mortality give me a choice? Doesn’t everyone have a choice?”

Lucifer sighed in resignation. “No mortal, not everyone has a choice. Your free will is a gift. You have infinite choices given to you at all times. You can even violate your own nature and purpose. The only catch is that every choice you make has consequences. Good consequences. Bad consequences. Even the final determination of where you go once you enter into eternity. This, is one of those consequences.”

I took a moment to process what he was saying. “So, you’re saying the Bible is right? H- . . . the other place and Hell. Salvation and damnation. All of that?

Lucifer took a deep breath and let it out slowly. “The Bible is right so far as your puny mortal minds can comprehend. It’s the basics, the most basic of basics. The fullness of truth is far beyond anything your kind can hope to understand. It’s like a trail guide. It tells you how to get to your eternity, but not everything about your destination, or all of the reasons you would choose one over the other.”

“So there-“ I began.

Lucifer cut me off again. “This isn’t about that. We’re far beyond that now. What this is about is you making a choice, and since making your choice under threat, well, exclusively under threat, is no choice at all, allow me to tempt you with the benefits of marrying my daughter.”

“So, this isn’t a shotgun wedding?” I asked.

“Oh, this is absolutely a shotgun wedding,” Lucifer replied with a laugh. “But that doesn’t mean you can’t say no, or that you can’t enter into it willingly.”

It made no sense to me, but I decided to play along. “Okay, so what are the benefits?”

Lucifer smiled. “Smart reply. I might just grow to like you after all.” We stopped walking. “Look around,” he commanded gesturing to the raging inferno around us.

I did, and as my gaze moved from one place to another, the landscape shifted rapidly, filling my mind with visions of the many places of torment, the cities of demons, and the palace of the ruler of Hell itself.

“It’s amazing isn’t it?” Lucifer asked.

I nodded. “Amazing, and, honestly, horrifying. There are so many damned souls.”

Lucifer nodded. “Yes. Most of humanity has chosen Hell as their eternity. Only those who die in innocence, either because they were so young, so mentally deficient, or forgiven go to the other place. Back when most mortals died as children, most of them went there. But now that most live into adulthood, most of them practically run here.”

“Who would choose this?” I asked. “It seems like . . . the wrong choice to make.”

“Wrong according to who?” he asked. “You need to understand. Grace and forgiveness are exclusive to the mortal world. Here in eternity, the law is everything, and once we enter into it, our nature is fixed, and we no longer get to make the kind of consequential choices that you mortals make on a daily basis. Consequential for eternity, not for the blink of an eye that is a mortal life.”

“So why would I choose to marry Lilly and stay here for the rest of my life?” I asked sincerely.

Lucifer smiled. “Ah,” he said dramatically. “That is the right question. Since we are beyond threats, allow me to do what I exist to do, and tempt you.”

We began to walk again and the landscape around us slowly shifted from one infernal landscape to the next. “To begin with, A marriage in eternity is not ‘til death do us part’ like it is in the mortal realm. Here, marriage is forever. No divorce. No abandonment. No infidelity. And no death.”

It took a moment for the meaning of Lucifer’s words to sink in. “So, you’re saying that I won’t die, and Lilly will never leave me or cheat on me?”

“Exactly!” he exclaimed enthusiastically. “Remember, in eternity the law is everything, and vows are truly unbreakable. It’s impossible. As for you living forever, it wouldn’t do to have the only prince of Hell become a mere damned soul, would it?”

“So, I won’t age and die?” I asked stupidly.

Lucifer laughed. “Tia!” He called out, and a woman who I can only describe as every goddess of sex, beauty, and motherhood all rolled into one, dressed in a revealing, flowing black gown appeared at his side. “Mortal, meet Tiamat, my wife. How old would you say she looks in your human years?”

“Ummm . . . . twenty-nine?” I guessed.

They both laughed. “I am older than humanity itself,” Tiamat said in a voice that was like a choir of angels. “I was there with the Creator at the dawn of time, and I will be here when He destroys it.”

“And she hasn’t aged a day!” Lucifer finished proudly. “As you can see, in eternity, your form is fixed. Not only will our dear Lilly look exactly the way she does right now forever, but you will remain just as fixed. No aging. No illness. No infirmity. No death. But pain and torment will remain very real possibilities. Remember that if you ever cross me or fail me.”

It was both a promise and a threat. The carrot and the stick. The carrot was especially nice, and the stick especially harsh.

“I’m going to go finish helping Lillith prepare for her wedding my love,” Tiamat said to Lucifer, and just like that, she was gone.

“There’s something I don’t understand,” I said carefully as we continued our walk. “You said it will be impossible for Lilly . . . wait a minute, did she say Lillith? As in THAT Lillith?”

Lucifer laughed again, finding it absurd that it took me so long to realize who Lilly was. “Yes, that Lillith”, he said mirthfully. “The legends have some truth, some lies, and totally fail to capture who she is or all that she has achieved. She is the first princess of Hell, but since I can never die, marrying her has no chance of you becoming king of Hell.”

“And how is it she can’t cheat on me if we get married? Isn’t she consumed by lust?”

Lucifer shook his head. “No mortal, she isn’t consumed by lust, she embodies lust. There’s a huge difference. And the law is clear: No adultery, never, for any reason. It’s literally impossible for her to cheat on you and for you to cheat on her if you get married.”

“Is it common to get married in Hell?” I asked.

“Not at all,” Lucifer replied nonchalantly. “In fact, Tia and I are the only married couple here. We’ve been married since before Adam and Eve were kicked out of Eden, and I can say that it’s never been dull, she’s only more beautiful now than ever, we’ve been completely faithful to each other, and our daughters, I lose count these days but we have well over a thousand, are a pure joy. Well, except for Lilly’s insistence on exploiting the All Hallow’s loophole every year to dally with a mortal.”

The All-Hallows loophole? I opened my mouth to ask the question, but Lucifer hushed me and pointed to a pit of raging hellfire. “Look carefully,” he commanded.

I looked into the flames, and I saw thousands of souls burning in torment. They were all men, their naked flesh charred, bubbled, scorched, and ran off their bodies in a foul bunt slurry only to be regenerated as fast as it was destroyed, guaranteeing their suffering could never end. Yet, in spite of this, every one of them was in a perpetual state of arousal, and they . . . did things, anything, everything, to try to relieve that arousal even as they screamed out in eternal pain.

Lucifer grinned the most evil grin I’d ever seen, raised one hand in a crooked claw, and twisted it in the air. Every tortured soul in the pit screamed out in unison as their scrotums twisted like corkscrews, and kept twisting, stretching and swelling until they all burst at once in a s shower of blood and . . . other fluids.

“These are Lilly’s past lovers,” Lucifer explained, looking and sounding like the cat that ate the canary. One of the great pleasures in my life is coming here every day to personally add to their torment. They were all such fools for falling prey to their base animal instincts.”

I was utterly horrified. It was not lost on me that I was looking at my potential future, and what would have surely been my right now had Lucifer not given up on doing the same thing over and over again without success.

“And what will I do once I marry Lilly?” I asked, my mind made up.

Lucifer turned to me and smiled. He smiled with all the evil, malice, and sin that has ever been, and will ever be. “You, my boy, will have a job to do. As first prince of Hell, you will become my right-hand man, and your duties will take you to the mortal realm with great frequency.”

And that is how it all began. My new life married to Lillith and serving the Devil himself. Perhaps later I will tell you about the wedding and the nearly year-long honeymoon in Hell with all of its horrors and delights. To be honest, I’m still not accustomed to Hell and all its gruesome glory, and only the thought of reuniting with my dear Lilly can get me to go back. And return I will. There is no bliss on earth or in Hell below like being in my wife’s arms.

Which brings us to the burning question: Why am I here? The answer is simple. I am here to give you a warning. Marrying Lillith was a one-time exception Satan made for his favorite daughter. He made that very clear in his speech at our wedding reception. But her sisters, her thousand plus sisters, are jealous. Envy is a real thing, especially in Hell. Lucifer knows that many of them are considering exploiting the All-Hallows loophole in the hopes that one day their father may relent and grant them a husband like he did for Lilly, and they don’t mind adding thousands of men’s, and in some cases women’s souls to the pit of infernal lovers each as they pursue this goal.

So if a particularly beautiful creature in a stunningly realistic costume approaches you this Halloween, be mindful that it may be one of Lucifer’s daughters, and be aware of the consequences if you fall prey to the intense lust you will surely feel.

I’ll be here, watching in my father-in-law’s stead, aching with my own desire as I await November first so I can return to my wife’s embrace in Hell. Yes, I will do my job exactly as instructed, I have no choice in the matter. I’m in eternity now, and the law is the law, and failing Lucifer will break my contract, and he has assured me that my punishment will be the immediate destruction of my mortal body, and my return to Hell will be one of eternal torment rather than the sweet embrace of my wife.
