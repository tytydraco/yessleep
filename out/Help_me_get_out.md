I am so proud of myself. I finally made it and stepped out of my apartment again. Of course, I am still not showered and smelled like shit with some deodorant and hair perfume on top, but I am out in the fresh air and I immediately feel better. My thoughts circle, but it feels like they do so in a distance in my head. The sun is not shining yet, but really it is a blue sky and the sun is only rising now. Fresh early morning. Maybe for me, a new beginning.

The last weeks have been really difficult. The damn anniversary of January 4th. I could not take the comments I read online, but I read them all. At least that is what it feels like to me. If people are hostages or rightfully prisoners, how a day like that should be remembered? And I also make sure to not forget other things that happen. The attack in New Orleans, the attack on that German Christmas market, even though that was a while ago. Trump, Austria, Germany, Canada. I still have the key in my hand, and I reach for my phone, perhaps I should just check if there is anything new. I haven’t read an update about the fires in California for a while. My finger quickly unlocks my phone and I scroll through my apps for one moment, trying to find my NYT app. I freeze. Breathe. I need to stop this. Okay. Maybe the fires are not so important right now, at least not to me. I need to get some food. I need to get my head clear a little. 

People tell me they are worried about me. Honestly, I am worried about them. How can you not care this much?  How can you read all these things and just go on with your day? This is why issues keep on piling up, nothing gets solved because people fucking just go on to the next one. I see the same for me, because of the broken pipe I had to move my boxes out of the hallway, I had just moved in four months ago, and still have not unpacked everything. Fair enough, they were my winter clothes, and it is January, but I would say a warm one and really, I have better things to do. Now the boxes are in the shower. My landlord can not be reached, but I guess that he is still on Christmas vacation with his family. So that is fine. 

Oh, damn, I am still standing here with the keys in my hand. I looked around for a moment and tried to remember what I wanted to do. Go out. Get some food. Damn, I am even out of coffee now and that is awful. I feel ashamed that this is what gets me out of the house, not that I haven't had a meal that wasn’t cereal in 2 days. So be it. I should write a list, shouldn’t I? It is stupid to go shopping without a list, especially if you are hungry. And broke on top of that. I push the key into the lock and go inside again. Only after a few minutes of standing outside in the cold, do I feel how damp and warm it is here in comparison. I checked the thermometer that the previous renter left here and it says 62°. Yes, I definitely should take care of the heating issue I have. Landlord. I grab my phone and there is an update on the newsfeed about the fires. 

I look at the top right of my screen and notice that 15 minutes have passed, with me standing in the hallway, scrolling. My thumb hurts, it hurts all the fucking time. And since I got outside, I noticed this smell in here. Like something is rotten. The list. The shopping list. Shit, I really should get going and go to the market, it is still morning and I can get some fresh stuff if I am lucky. 

I step outside again, and I close the door after me. In a moment of panic, I look for my keys, find them, and then run away from the door for a few steps, just to slow down and hope that the neighbors did not see that. I take another look at my phone and decide to check if I can find anything about Kongo. It has been going on for ages there, hasn’t it? I stand there and scroll, and then remember I should get the hell going. What am I doing? The world is going to shit. It is. In front of the house, two pine trees used to feel green and fresh and like a welcome diversion from the gray of the city. Now in the gray air, some clouds have come up in the meantime and the sun is still not completely there, they just look dead to me. Still green, but sparser than usual. At the same time, they are big, and I wonder if a storm could make them fall on the little building that my apartment is in. What would happen if there was a wildfire here? I can’t imagine what these people must be going through. 

My apartment is on the back of a building and I need to go down the metal staircase to get to the front and make my way to the market. The staircase is icy and slippery, and I need to hold on to the rail tightly, it is so cold. After a few steps, I stop and check if I made a shopping list on my phone. That would save me at the market. Angrily, I put my phone back into my pocket, almost slipping as I take the next step and continue my way down the stairs. As I am on the last steps, I stop. I see a dead rat lying there, with what seems like a footprint on top. The black fur is sticking out of frozen crimson sludge, stuck in the profile of a boot. Did someone stomp that rat to death? It looked like insects were crawling there, some ants, in January there were no flies here. I did not smell anything over the cold, crisp morning air. Some rat blood was frozen on the sidewalk. The cadaver was lying right in front of the last step, and I would have to walk over it. I stand there for a minute. This is too much for me. Fuck. I turn, and I make my way up the stairs. Fuck. 

Can someone help me? How am I supposed to go outside anymore?
