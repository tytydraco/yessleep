The tall blonde girl explained to me that hot chocolate with espresso and steamed oat milk was actually called a Mocha Oat Latte. I thanked her for hepping me to the vernacular and waited to become ungrumpy.

It was a record high in Brooklyn for the ides of March and I was dressed accordingly. Cargo shorts, Brooklyn vs. Everybody tee, Nike slip on sneakers topped off with a Humphrey Bogart fedora. I was everything the aging software consultant who worked from home should be. And I was high as a helicopter on the Lush sativa pen and didn't care who knew it.

I heard the door jingle bell open and in lumbered a very, very large man who appeared to be of indeterminate origin. He had a shock of wild black curly hair and a sparse beard and moustache that only partially concealed a deeply tanned set of missing teeth.

The man's stench preceded him, and except for a large burlap blanket swaddling his amazing girth, which I imagined to be somewhere in the neighborhood of close to 400lbs, there was nothing else to clothe him.

He was at least six feet and upon his wild eyed face sat a pair of black rimmed Buddy Holly coke bottle glasses covered in duct tape. The man was making high pitched unintelligible noises. That went on for a few interminably long and painful seconds.

I kept my eyes open but held my breath. I finally surmised the fat man was wanting to be fed as the noises seemed to coalesce into real words. Words that spoke of his homelessness and hunger. The three GenZs behind the counter seemed fascinated by the espresso machine in the back behind the bar.

A woman with a double baby stroller deftly maneuvered around the man and jingle belled out of Cafe Grumpy. I took a step back as a smell so hideous confronted my olfactory glands. Then two things happened I had no control over.

1. My mouth started uttering obscenities about the smell and;
2. My hands extracted a twenty dollar bill from my wallet

I put it on the counter near the coffee lids and syrup bottles and said, "For the f$W(#%&\* love of God just @#$(&#@$)\*Q@#)$\*Q@#)$\*#Q)$\*)#Q$\*)QW#$\* and GO!"

The man said, "I'm OSWALDO!"

I felt the room start to spin and felt myself grow lightheaded. I summoned up a righteous indignation and heard myself bellow, "TAKETHE()@$)@#$\*)@#)\*$\*#@MONEYANDGET@$)(\*@#)$)\_@#)@#$ OUT!"

Our eyes met. Oswaldo Buddy Holly seemed to hear something in the distance I did not. He did a fast double take that showed signs of intelligence. Then he nodded as if to confirm something to himself, took the twenty and left the cafe.

The bell jingled and I breathed into my fedora like an N95.

"Here's your Mocha Oat Latte," the blonde girl said, offering me a white paper cup with a grumpy face on it and an oatmilk leaf slowly discorporating upon the surface.

I thanked her and when I went to put a lid on the cup two men wearing navy blue banker suits jingle belled in to Cafe Grumpy like they were somebody. They walked in and kept walking right up towards me. As I watched this, I turned from the lids to greet them with a smile. While they didn't look none too friendly they did let in some fresh air with them and they did not smell like dumpster juice; so there was that.

"Why'd you say *that*?" one of them asked me referring to me by name.

I felt a chill mosey down my spine. They were both in their late 30s I imagine. One guy on the left had curly hair and mirrored aviator sunglasses. His face looked expressive as a Buckingham palace guard and there seemed to be a bulge under his sport coat by his left armpit.

There were three things that immediately bothered me.

Things that immediately bothered me:

1. What, exactly, did I say? and;
2. How did they know I said anything? and;
3. And how the F$#(% did they know my name?

The other man softened his features in to what I supposed was to be taken for compassion. Good cop, bad cop? It's best in times like these to take matters into your own hands. Looking down at my hand I raised it to my face. Cup to my lips. Eyes on the men in bankers' suits.

I took a long slurp/gulp then rinsed and repeated until we all stood there a cool half minute while I caffeinated. The sugary chocolate caffeine beverage talked to me like spinach to *Popeye the Sailor Man.*

It said, "F$#(% these men in blue. Let's roll."

The silent banker began to flinch as if he was going to move his arm and I drank quick and readjusted so my elbow was triangled between myself and them. The GenZs seemed busy on their phones.

Some people walked by on 7th avenue. I saw the filthy, fat man in the burlap blanket come towards them. Once again his stench preceded him and their spring gamine like expressions of hope immediately changed to fright.

Putting their heads down, the pair gave him a wide berth as he ambled off, blanket wrapped tight, in the opposite direction, south. Toward my part of town. Swell. I thought I'd follow. Full of caffeine I walked around the bankers. One said, "Hey," and put his hand out as if to touch me.

I stepped back and gave them the malochi.

"Follow me and I'll put you in Methodist hospital," I heard myself growl. A voice in my head said, in an admiring, almost fawning voice, 'F$#(% Grumpy latte don't play!'.

The talking banker started to move his mouth, his eyes did a double take at his partner, his partner seemed to have some kind of tremor. Coffee in hand I jingle belled out and kept an eye over my shoulder to make sure I wasn't followed.

Back on the street I went north, in the opposite direction of the Blob and figured I would get some supplies for the crib before going back to work. As I walked down 7th Avenue listening to Sam Cooke's, That's It. I Quit. I'm Moving On. and thought of the dubious circumstances of his death I began to feel the eyes of Laura Mars upon me.

Mothers with strollers gave me a wide birth. I took a quick sniff of my person. Nothing but Tom's natural and Aqua Gio. I was sweet smelling, my teeth clean, freshly shaved and full of caffeine, fat and sugar; the three food groups best to start one's day.

Then a mother and her school age daughter came out of the community bookshop walking quickly.

I slowed my roll to give them space to pass when the daughter and my eyes met. Her eyes shone worried with compassion.

"They're coming for you," she said and referred to me by name. I stood straighter as if I had stepped on an electrified manhole cover. And then her mother slapped her so fast and hard across the face I gasped. Her mother grabbed her arm hard and pulled her away down the street without another word.

As I regained my composure, a middle-aged woman coming down the street with a golden retriever caught my eye. At first my own eyes did a double take as she appeared to be naked from the waist down; only wearing a denim jacket and some kind of wife beater.

She held a rolled-up yoga mat and then I realized they were flesh toned workout bottoms. I shook my head slightly and smiled softly as our eyes met.

"Ask them no questions. For they can tell no lies." And then, as if a spell had been broken, she gave me an arrogant look, as if, 'how dare you gaze upon my attractive self you inferior prole," before she disappeared south.

"What the F$#(%?" I thought to myself and contemplated the wisdom of another coffee and a pre-roll. I did have to go to the ATM machine and might as well go with the flow.

In front of the Chase bank the man who always greeted me and asked for money simply said, "You said a bad word, son. Don't do it again."

I went in an withdrew some cash. I put some sanitizer on my hands and rubbed them together. I used my hip to push open the door and the man in front said in his normal voice, "Can you help me get a meal?" I smiled sadly, nodded no, and walked south to the weed shop.

Inside the weed shop I got my usual pre-roll. This time though, instead of the usual warm greeting Isiah acted as if I were a total stranger. I paid for the weed and asked to borrow his lighter.

Isiah gave me a stern look. He handed me a lighter and said, "Keep it. Don't speak. Go home. If you got a door lock it. Turn off all your devices. Don't do a F$#(%ing thing until tomorrow. Now get the F$#(% out of here."

I was going to say something but his eyes were like two lasers boring down on me. Just boring into me like punctuation that went on with no end. I nodded my thanks and left the shop. A man pushing a lady in a wheelchair went past me. The lady in the wheelchair looked up at me.

I was lighting the pre-roll and our eyes met. She said, "Is that the man who said the bad word?" to the man pushing her. He put his head down, then shot a quick sideways glance like a swimmer coming up for air, then pushed her past like I smelled bad as a big & tall man's burlap homeless blanket.

I felt my stomach grumble. It had been a while since something had been in it. I found myself in front of the register of Starbucks at the Barnes & Noble on 6th Street across the street from Methodist Hospital. 

I was planning to get a coffee but there was this young boy, maybe ten or eleven with his mother. He was touching everything on the display case like he had OCD or something. His mother kept saying, "James! James!! When we get home I will make you a smoothie. Mom will make you a smoothie! James! Are you listening to me?!!?!?"

James then said, "I want to say bad words, too, like <insert my name>."

Then, as if the needle had stretched across the vinyl everything stopped. The mother grabbed the boy hard by the arm and shot me a nasty look. She was fat and had a hairy mole on her chin. She wore a button on an ill fitting denim jacket that read, "Ethical Slut," around a peace sign.

She said, "You shouldn't ever say that word again."

She, too, knew my name. I was not famous. In fact, you could best describe my lifestyle as that of the poor and relatively unknown. How the F$#(% did she know my name. What word did I say.

The fat middle aged lady in the green Starbucks shirt who was the manager and always anticipated my order acted as if I were a total stranger.

"What. Can. I. Get. You?"

Our eyes met. I looked down and spied chocolate covered espresso beans. I wanted out. I didn't want to draw attention to myself. I pulled a five from my wallet and took the beans.

"That all you want?"

"Thanks. Keep the change."

She looked at me with no expression and said, "Thank you and watch your mouth," before turning her back on me to some Starbucks related things by some large boxes of liquid I couldn't see well. For a second I thought the box read, "Prop Coffee," but then a lady behind on her phone said, "Some people just don't know when the F$#(% to shut their mouth, Hector?!?!!?" Our eyes met, and she said to Hector, "Some people should stop saying bad words and go home and think about whether they value the above ground life..."

A baby cried and I walked away from the lady to the napkin station. Out on Seventh Avenue everything seemed normal. But wherever I went it was not normal at all. Perhaps I should go home. I grabbed some napkins and left Barnes & Noble.

At the convenience shop I bought and paid for a Powerball ticket and the man acted also as if he did not know me. As I thanked him and turned to walk away he said, "You are not lucky, sir. Go home today. Take the day off."

I spun around and he acted as if he said nothing. The door opened and some kids from John Jay high school blew past me blathering about instagram. One girl in pajama bottoms gave me a quick look and said, "Go home," and used my first name.

Back on the street it was sunny. The air was fresh. The birds chirped. Delivery trucks, buses, cop cars, meter maids, pedestrians, hospital people in scrubs, teens in their spring training uniforms; but something was off. I apparently had said a bad word. Apparently, everyone knew my name.

I tore the plastic wrapper of my espresso beans to make a hole. I shook about six in my mouth and began to jaw them. They were bitter and sweet. I thought about taking a walk in Prospect Park to clear my head. I thought about going to the Union Market for produce and spaghetti and hummus.

I swallowed the espresso beans and watched a jet fly across the sky. Probably headed to JFK. Some more high schoolers went by and one in min-dreadlocks said to me, "If you blow it here one more time you don't want to know what the next simulation gets like." He then quickly walked on by. He too, knew my name.

I felt a bead of sweat slide down my butt crack. Someone came out of the juice shop, passed me and said, "Fucker." and kept walking. Three people coming out of Pino's pizza looked at me as I walked by and said, "Keep saying bad words. Watch. Watch what happens."

I thought to myself, No, I'm dreaming. I will wake up in the memory foam and this will all be a dream. My phone vibrated. It was Nathalia. There was an issue at work. They were waiting for me in a Zoom. I checked the site on my phone. It was still up. I logged in. It was fine. I checked my Outlook for production errors. There were none but there was one email that caught my eye.

It read, "You said a bad word and now you're going to be sorry," and it too used my name. I went to open it and suddenly my phone screen turned black. The phone restarted showing the little Android.

Across the screen it read. Go home. Do not go to the Zoom meeting. Turn off this phone. You said a bad word. Management knows. Do not speak to anyone for 24 hours. 24 hours. 24-

And then I saw Snoopy. Then my familiar icons.

I went home. Fast as my feet could walk. On the streets everyone began to sing.

*Karma, karma, karma, karma*

*Karma chameleon*

*You come and go, you come and go*

It wasn't loud like Christmas caroling. It was pointed. It was monotone.

Back in my apartment I turned on the laptop. There was an invitation. I went to Teams and asked Nathalia what was going on.

"You said a bad word. Management is not happy. We have a meeting. Can you come?"

I thought about it. Out on the corner of 6th Avenue and 15th Street I heard a woman's voice yell, "F#($&(#@$& YOU! The light is RED. Are you F(#$@\*(@#$ STUPID?!?!"

I took my hand and gently closed the laptop lid.

That was Friday.

It's Sunday now and I am nervous about work tomorrow. I haven't slept right. The lights are out. The blinds are drawn and every hit of weed from this Lush pen is making me paranoid.

Just. What. The. F@#($&\*. Did. I. Say?
