Strawberry Abbey was never visited by the locals, for there was no longer a road, and it was little more than an ancient pile of rubble, with little resemblance to any kind of structure. According to my attorney, the requirement for access to our dynasty trust was simply a notarized visit to the grounds. Considering the trust still had nearly seven hundred thousand dollars left, I decided to take a mobile notary, my attorney and a photographer I'd hired online, and go claim the last of the old inheritance.

We drove up and down the old forestry roads until I was convinced that we were in the right spot. We only had a quarter of a mile to hike from the road. I was going to go there, have my visit witnessed and signed for, and my photograph taken. When we got back, I'd take the documents to court and claim the money. I could retire from the menial unskilled jobs I lived off of, getting hired from labor pools and in front of hardware stores. I was tired of starving and being homeless.

Mr. Wilder - my attorney and Sir Boss - the Rastafarian cameraman, kept up with me and Ms. Clanderfield - the notary, until we reached the part of the forest close to the grounds. There we began to slow, worried by the wilted and desolate change in the wood. Nothing stirred, no animals, insects or birds. There was no breeze, only a kind of ominous stillness. I was the last of our expedition to feel unnerved by this, and only when I beheld the walls surrounding the abbey, overgrown in dead vines, and with barren clay soil beyond.

We entered through the western entrance and found ourselves in a cemetery with several hundred antique graves, their faded epitaphs testifying to the century and a half of dereliction. Those graves belonged to the denizens of the abbey, and to my ancestors as well. I found the last of the graves, those that bore my family name of Vendel.

"This should do. I'll stand with these." I said to Sir Boss.

"Everyone sign this. We are all your witnesses, Bradley." Mr. Wilder had brought out the document testifying in detail what the affidavits represented. I had visited the grounds, that's all I had to do. "Nothing has changed since the last time I was here, of course, I never actually set foot inside the place."

I also had to survive, for we all felt it, something was quite wrong with that place. Strawberry Abbey was haunted by something, and it wasn't going to let us leave. We all knew something was wrong, and it wasn't long before we all looked at each other and knew we all felt the same.

"You feel that? Something evil here, man." Sir Boss had taken my picture and stood staring in the direction he felt he was being watched from. We all slowly turned and looked, but there was nothing there but standing rubble and the ruins of the abbey.

"It's cold, and nothing is growing here. I do feel a little weird." Ms. Clanderfield, who until then, had maintained a very professional demeanor, suddenly revealed that her nerves were starting to fray.

"Maybe we should get going, head back the way we came." my attorney, Mr. Wilder suggested. He placed one hand on top of a gravestone and drew it back in shocked surprise. A moment later blood was dripping from a cut across his palm. "What the heck?"

We looked at the gravestone, where shards of glass were embedded. These were atop every gravestone, in fact. We looked around at the bizarre addition to the graves, mortar embedded with shards of glass.

"To keep the stones from being stolen, perhaps?" Ms. Clanderfield said, but nobody thought it sounded right.

"It's the ground. The ground here is bitter, tainted. Something cannot touch the ground, goes hopping along the walls, the rocks, the gravestones. Look, glass atop everything." Sir Boss said with a frightened look in his eyes and uncanny certainty in his voice.

"I need a tourniquet." Mr. Wilder was having a hard time, as he was afraid of blood, apparently.

"No, that would make it worse. You won't bleed to death." I said, and I tore off part of my t-shirt and wrapped it neatly around his wound. "Now hold it up above your heart. The bleeding will stop, you'll be fine."

"How is it getting dark already?" Ms. Clanderfield looked around. "It's only a quarter 'til six."

"In the valley, the shadow comes fast, night lasts long. In the forest, in the dark we won't find our path." Sir Boss was spooked and was looking around in fear.

I was starting to feel nervous too, surrounded by people having dark premonitions. I shook my head, deciding it was all just paranoia. I was out there with a bunch of sensitive people, unused to being outside the comfort of their familiar surroundings. The injury had gotten everyone freaked out. That's what I told myself.

"Let's get going. It will be dark soon." I said. "Everyone calm down. There's nothing in these woods to worry about."

As I spoke, I realized they were all looking away from me at something, staring wide-eyed. I slowly turned and looked and saw something drop from the alcove of deep shadows to a stone beam. I couldn't be sure what I had seen. It crossed under a broken archway and vanished, something with too many limbs and fast movement, leathery horror and scrambling nightmare - that I thought I had seen. I dismissed it, unable to believe I had just seen something so awful.

"What was that?" Ms. Clanderfield asked, terror making her voice tremble.

"It's not right." Sir Boss stammered.

Mr. Wilder gasped and fainted.

"We have to carry him." I said, unable to think of a better plan.

"How, man?" Sir Boss asked reasonably while looking around like a hunted animal. I was slapping Mr. Wilder, but he remained in a terrified and shocked state, unresponsive except little childish-sounding whimpers and objections.

I looked up and Ms. Clanderfield had dropped her small briefcase and decided to flee back towards the car. I saw her leave the western entrance and into the dead forest surrounding the grounds. We heard her screaming, her voice in terror and then in frantic anguish and then in broken shrieks and finally silence. Beyond the walls, whatever was out there could touch the unholy ground.

"The grounds of the abbey, it can't walk on the grounds of the abbey. Just out there, and along the rubble." I realized, accepting Sir Boss's idea and knowing somehow how it moved. The broken glass in the mortar atop everything, and the panic, it all made sense in the moment.

"Yeah, man. The cemetery and the abbey, consecrated ground. It is an unholy thing, a monster!" Sir Boss exclaimed. "We've gotta leave him and go!"

"I'm not leaving anyone behind." I refused, despite my fear. I couldn't abandon someone like that.

"Then, I'm sorry. I can't stay here!" Sir Boss shoved me aside and took off running. He must have gotten away, I thought, because I didn't hear him scream.

It was getting dark fast, and I was very afraid. I used my lighter and some dried vines and pieces of old wood from the rubble to build a campfire, hoping the light would repel whatever was out there. It wasn't long before it was true night, darkness advancing like a tide. Then the creature returned. It used the same path it had to exit and hunt the others, to return. I looked into the shadowed alcove, beyond its archway, and saw something there, watching me.

I felt the coldness of that place, an unnatural memory of the gothic perversions of my ancestors. I knew it wanted me most of all. It's leathery cloak, or quilt, shone in the firelight. It covered itself in the skins of its prey, leather made from human flesh. It had taken this, the bones the meat, everything.

As though hypnotized by the feeling of familiarity I descended the staircase of the archway and found its lair. I was in some kind of trance, responding automatically. I was aware of my actions and afraid, and it was only when I stopped that I felt like I was myself again. Whatever had compelled me to walk down those stairs, it was pure instinct.

I felt numb, staring at the bed made of corpses. My lighter gave only flickering and nightmare illumination, showing only a few details. When I was out of fuel, I was alone in the darkness. I had stood there looking around for so long I had learned of the thing.

To its lair it brought its kills and used every part of the person for its belongings. The skin it had sewn together, repairing its blanket-like robe. There was also a book, a very old book, bound the same way, and the pages too, and the ink was made of the chemistry of human fluids, blood, bile and nervous liquids. I had looked at the pages, and seen it was able to write, spending its dormancy between protracted visitations recording something into its book.

"Bradley Vendel." A deep whoosh of stagnant air carried its inhuman voice to me as I tried to leave its lair. It stood in my way, dripping from murder.

"How do you know my name?"

"Who is made this? Is it father? Grandfather, older than grandfather? What sees the Vendel who lives among the new times? Surely strange things out there." The creature's voice and articulation were slow, steady and deeply bewildering. What sort of monster was speaking to me. In the dimness of my nightvision, all I could see was a massive thing hunched over, its many long limbs folded under its thick leather blanket, its robes of many people who it had taken over the decades. It was old, I knew it was.

"I'm Bradley Vendel. I have returned." I said, unsure why I was speaking to the abomination.

"Yes. And you've sustained me for long, with three for my skulls." It gestured with a hand made of folded hook-like claws, from under its tarp, and there was a glow where the shelves of skulls sat neatly arranged. "In return, you will carry our bloodline. Again, another generation, and then another. This is not what would happen, but it happens anyway."

"You, you are a Vendel?" I asked in disbelief. My fear had simmered low, and had become like a background terror, and I acted and spoke on instinct, indistinguishable from a living nightmare.

"Am I?" It asked. "I have no skin, and too many parts. I am made of the sins of your ancestors, perhaps a distant cousin, but your blood and mine flow together."

I trembled, horrified that this thing was related to me. "How is this possible?"

"The unhallowed ground beneath us, the sacred ground above, which burns my skinless flesh at the touch. Must the leather of strangers keep me sheathed, must I never leave, to keep our history alive, below."

I looked where it pointed, its foul voice and breath taking me to a vision of the depths below. Truly cavernous catacombs existed, where none should. "Let me go." I said quietly, shuddering in cooling fear. Some deeper disturbance, some kind of knowledge, something that cannot be unknown threatened my mind.

"Yes, when you know how many rats it took to chew our family tree into dust." The thing led me and I reluctantly and anxiously followed.

"Count Vendel, takes the abbey and calls it his home. Where do the nuns go? His mercenaries were wicked men, who stripped them. What curses they put on our name?" The creature gestured as we passed the first of its historical dioramas, made from corpses posed in representation of the day it spoke of.

We descended, and my eyes kept adjusting, and I could see as though there was light. I've always had good nightvision, but I've never relied on it on an ancient stone staircase. I discovered I could see in almost total darkness. I realized my eyes are not human.

"Isabella Vendel, with the girls she hired, bathes in blood, their dried remains dropped into the waters of the village well. She kept her flesh young, her skin soft as silk, until the villagers burned her alive. Crispy shreds like black snowflakes, all that drift in the smoke. Let her scream, can you not hear the echoes, in our blood?" The creature had stopped and held several of its limbs in gesture at the scene.

We continued deeper, the stairs taking us into the cold earth below. The darkness was not at its blackest, for my eyes adjusted still, until I could almost see clearly without any light at all.

"The family tree grew narrow. So many moments in the same bed, why I would not bother to sleep anywhere else. It was upon a bed of corpses, that Vendels mated. See how the face of each birth was less human - more horrible?" The creature showed a series of portraits, and I wondered who had painted them all.

"Was an artist in the family, very talented. Long-lived, reclusive. Keeps me a prisoner. Puts mortar and glass where I can walk. Why not I break away this glass?" The creature was looking at me, but it had no face, just the cowl of patchwork skin.

"Was the glass also consecrated?" I asked.

"Was the glass from the stained window, each shard a part of a saint, each consecrated, even in pieces." The creature affirmed. "A curse is a curse. What I touch, what I eat, these are not for me to choose."

"What happened to him?" I asked

"He raped his sister on bed of corpses." The creature said, matter-of-factly. "Then, when he had continued our bloodline, in his madness, he ended his own life upon the very glass he had placed."

"I'm from out there." I objected. "I'm not like you."

"You can see with the eyes of the shadows. Nobody does that. You are the result of all this. Each of these gave you blood, and your heart pumps it every minute."

"Spare me the rest." I begged.

"Oh, do you realize it will become worse as we get closer to your birth?" The creature wondered.

"I don't want to know anymore. I never wanted to know any of this." I was afraid of the creature, yet more afraid of learning where I was from.

The creature stopped and hesitated. "That is understandable."

"What?" I asked. The sudden hint of compassion had caught me while I was feeling guarded, I was surprised.

"You should know. It would be unfair to end your story here, with these wretched facts." The creature decided. "Come and learn how Strawberry Abbey finally ended. How it has lain in wreckage for over a hundred years, while yours went to the world where the sun shines and people do not even believe I could exist."

"There is a world like that." I recalled. I felt like we had left it long ago, descending through time, into a hole of unmaking.

"I brought down the stones, originally. I was like you, I did not accept this history. Yet I am living flesh, skinless and changed from your perfect form. Look at you Bradley, you have only two hands, each with only five fingers. You look entirely human. Aside from our kinship, you have no reason to care what I think." The creature was waiting for something from me.

"Let us proceed." I decided.

"Thank you. I might be a murderer, a cannibal and a monster, but do not think I have no human feelings. I do not enjoy what I do, I'd rather nobody ever came here. Let me sleep and write my stories. I do not wish to be bothered, and I do not wish to harm anyone. It is not something I can choose not to do. I am a monster, and nothing more."

"I see. Show me the rest. I accept." I decided.

We proceeded to the rest, where the creature showed me the photographs, starting with old black and white ones. I started recognizing family members, aunts and uncles and grandparents I had seen in family albums. I began to relax.

"Do you see? Humanity returned. You are not Vendel, you are Vendel, but not like the ones before." The creature brought me to the last photograph, it looked like it was from when I was in high school.

"Where did you get all of these?" I asked. Then I heard a voice from the entrance of the final chamber of the catacombs. It was my attorney, Mr. Wilder.

"Haven't you guessed that?" Mr. Wilder asked.

"We have the same attorney." The creature told me. "He has helped me find you and bring you here. Long have I waited."

"For what?" I asked.

"A family reunion. I am lonely." The creature said. "And only a Vendel would listen to me and feel for me. Do you not feel sorry for me?"

I did feel sorry for the creature, while it stood hunched under in its carpet of leathery rot. I shook my head. I asked:

"But you killed the others."

"Yes, and Mr. Wilder has some grace, but he is not Vendel. Only a Vendel may leave here alive. I must kill all others. I am a monster, I have no choice."

"No!" I objected. "Let him go. Don't kill him. You mustn't. If you kill him, you will always believe that!"

"How could I believe anything else? You have not seen what I look like, Bradley."

"My god!" Mr. Wilder sounded very afraid, realizing there was no escape.

"You must go and continue our line. There must be offspring. Raise a family. You are human, with just a drop of monster blood." The creature was rising up, preparing to attack its victim.

"Stop yourself. I have a monster in me. I can take all these stories and live with them, sleep in my own bed of corpses, so to speak. You though, you are Vendel, and you have a drop of human blood in you. We are kin." I told the creature. It hesitated.

"You are right. I wish to let him live. It will prove you right. Who knows, maybe I will not kill ever again, maybe I will sleep and write my stories, and I have collected my last skull." The creature sounded hopeful.

"Let's go." I told my attorney.

We went back up the stairs, and I felt the horror of each station, like counting backwards through the shadowy centuries. I could hear the echoes, smell the blood and feel the horror wrought by my people. When we emerged to the world above, there was a difference.

The sunlight had come, and the abbey looked peaceful, sad, but peaceful.

A wood tit was chirping merrily, as though he was trying to cheer us up. I saw a butterfly in the shafts of light through the trees, and green sprouts were climbing through the dew, claiming patches of the barren clay. The very land itself had begun to heal.

I took the dark history with me, swearing I would spend the rest of my life doing only good things, the best things, making my name a good word in my own mind and soul.

I sat across the desk from Mr. Wilder and his hand wore a clean bandage. He was smiling strangely at me and then he slid a file across the desk. He said:

"When I was put in charge of this, I had power of attorney that included collecting on your investments and also the bonds bought by your grandfather. There's a lot more than seven hundred thousand dollars. I wasn't sure when I should tell you, because you never really asked about the money."

"Yes, I did." I argued.

"You asked me if you could have it all, and I said yes. I'd only mentioned that the trust was originally worth a million dollars, and that I'd required a third of that after handling things for your family. You never asked how much money I grew while handling the fortune. If you had, I'd have to tell you."

I opened the file and looked at the statement highlighted in yellow. I nearly fainted.

"What will you do with all that?" He grinned weirdly, his ordeal changing him into a more poetic man.

"I'm going to give some to the Mayo Clinic and donate a lot to women's shelters. I want the rest to be used to fund an orphanage." I said without hesitation. "I've got a lot of work to do."

Mr. Wilder smiled at me, a glimmer in his eye.

"I'd like to help you with that, Mr. Vendel."
