"So, that's what a dead body looks like?" asks Pablo, my little brother, staring into the empty sockets of a corpse on the cover of ¡Alarma! Its bold letter title obscuring half the cadaver itself: "CARNAGE IN COLIMA!"

He points to it, smiling. "A vampire did that! Vampiros!"

On October 29th, 2010, my grandmother, Alma Abascal, died at the ripe old age of 103. Autopsy days later would reveal she died of a heart attack; despite having both a healthy heart and a projected age of 111. Not a day later, my uncle receives the news from a compadre.  This news catapults my family from Oakland, CA, all the way to Coatzacoalcos (say that three times fast), Mexico. There to be picked up and delivered to Catemaco: the Land of Witches.

“¡Oy! Vamanos! Car’s here!” calls Uncle Mateo, having spent the past five minutes barfing into a trash bin. "Aunt" Regina, with ruby lipstick smudged on her teeth, skips to the self-opening doors in haste.

Out on curbside, a procession of nacro-tanks speed past, each mounted with .50 Browning machine guns. Screeching to a halt, the last one, a semi-truck entombed in steel plates, opens, revealing a man clad in tactical gear: his cotton balaclava matching his pixelated camouflage uniform. *He's a sicario.* An assassin of the Mantando Güeros (Killing Whites) cartel. A monster made flesh.

“You El Cana’s kin?”

At first, no one answers. Regina breaks the silence by slamming her heel on Uncle Mateo's foot. “S-Si! I’m Mateo, that’s Regina, Cecilia- "

"Alright. Good enough for me. Mind the step."

Regina goes in first, taking hold of the sicario's hand. I don’t dare, shoving myself in without sparing a glance. Uncle Mateo hands me Pablo, too distracted with his G.I Joe action figure to care, before struggling to shut the heavy door behind him. Taking a fist to the bulkhead, we take off. The procession tearing through the streets of Coatzacoalcos in uncomfortable silence.

Out my window, boats trudge through the fiery waters of the Gulf. Sicarios patrol the blocks. Some clad in the same military-grade armor, others mere children with flat-billed caps and Halloween masks guarding paths of marigolds. It's not until we pass under a bridge where my heart hardens to iron. Several hooded bodies hang from a railing, complete with a nacro-banner spray painted on them:  “Los Cerdos Azules” (The Blue Pigs).

"When did we do that?" another sicario sitting with us asks, his shades balancing on the bumpy red nose of a rubber clown mask. The first guy, the one who greeted us, looks out to see what he means.

“Oh, you weren’t there, Guerrero? Happened this morning. Pigs got ratted out by the kids for extorting Lorenzo’s bakery, those cocksuckers.”

Second to him, with lime green dust goggles around his neck, scrunches his forehead. “What? You disturbed all of a sudden?”

Guerrero shifts in his seat, lips straining under the mask.

The first furrowed his brow. “We’re only kidding.”

"I just- I dunno, haven't been sleeping well these days."

The second guy bumps knees with the first, snorting an invisible line on his finger and giggling. Guerrero, not paying attention to them, continues:

“Been having these bad dreams lately. Pesadillas, I think."

“Pesadillas? Hell nah, now you tell us?"

The small slide door separating us and the driver opens. Another, much more annoyed voice, roars through the slit. “Guerrero! Raúl! Martin! Shut the fuck up!"

A moment of silence passes between them. Guerrero whispers to the second:

"Alvaro's a nervous driver."

The further we go, the more buildings shrink into houses, the houses then digest into wilderness. Ruled by Carboniferous-colossal trees looming overhead; their lowest subjects the spineless tentacles of fog seeping from rotting logs. If reincarnation holds water, I wish to become a lizard, or something out there. A lizard would be cool though, I won't complain.

It's not long before we reach Catemaco. The rolling mountains carry us to a stretch of dirt road, leading us to a sprawling property. Two stucco columns connect a low-pitched roof, framing a gothic arch. The door under it fixed with iron straps and scratches marring its wood. Iron grilles spiderweb over dozens of windows; the bars left entangled in leafy vines crawling out the greenhouse next door.

We swerve through a graveyard of abandoned cars, dodge guest houses in ruin, finally reaching the chapel. The structure leans; its plaster soughs; the paint feels in curdled slivers. Its steeple bends, weighed down by a bell warped by dents.

An army of sicarios gather outside. Many disguised in ski-masks and plaid long sleeves, and many more armed with rifles larger than themselves.

Our door opens. Another sicario beckons us to come out: his face wrapped in bandages snug under a black beret topped with a little fuzzy red dot. “Olá, niñas and niños! We’ve been waiting!”

Keeping Pablo glued to my thigh, one after another we follow. A heavy clang of the church doors unleashes a gust stinking of mildew. Beams of dying sunlight filter through dust motes, highlighting grandma’s nose sticking out from her open casket.

“You guys go on ahead; we’re still waiting for the boss.”

Uncle Mateo pushes us along, onward to meet our grandma.

“So, that’s what a corpse smells like?”

“¡Cállate! Show some respect!”

Pablo shrugs, waddling to a random seat among the pews. I gaze upon my grandma for what I believed would be the last time. I examine every tucked-in fold; every steamed-over wrinkle; every faded liver spot and swollen skin tag; her eyes, ones I've seen in pictures, now replaced with plastic replicas.

This wasn’t Alma Abascal, merely preservatives and meat in a bowl.

With her, a rosary as old as herself: the last belonging of the last "real" witch in our family. Both laid to rest not in a coffin, not like she couldn’t afford one, but in a marble tomb set to be sealed after three days of prayer. I, raised Catholic, of course, think of the afterlife. I know her practice is considered heresy, but it's not like she killed anyone; not like me. So, where does a good witch go when they die? Whatever the case, my stare meets the pained, rolled-back eyes of Christ on his cross towering over us, and, in silence, I pray she's where she wants to be.

“Mija,” whispers Regina, squeezing my arm. “No time for that. Don’t make the line grow longer.”

“You take your time, dear,” says another voice. Gruff like razors but smooth as honey. “Not like she’s going anywhere anytime soon.”

Head on a swivel, my eyes meet the gaping socket of a man. A scar, winding and jagged, runs through his lips, exposing black gums and blackening teeth. Right then, the difference between a cold sweat and my tears was razor thin. Regina, first noticing my fear, then him, drives out a forced wail. The one-eyed man slithers to the right of her, hand gyrating on her back.

I slip away, taking the hint, and go find Uncle Mateo; maybe he'd know more about the guy. However, I find him sobbing on another sicario’s collar, the guy’s brows drooping with immediate disgust as he offers a tissue.

Pablo tugs at my sleeve. Or rather, his Snake Eyes toy does.

“Think Alma’s sleeping well? Stone doesn’t look too comfortable to sleep on."

I stare at him, then at the doll cradled in his arms.

“It’s abuela, Pablo. Abuela. And, I don’t know, tradition?”

"Hmm, must be a good dream she's having then!"

First half of the ceremony is uneventful. Typical funeral stuff. The bandaged dude recits scripture. Sicarios of all kinds leave offerings on the stage's steps - mostly wads of cash. It's weird. If not for being a family member, my grandma, I would've dozed off in the first hour. Sure, a grandma I didn't know well, and by my choice, but still my grandma, right? Then again, hard to remind yourself that when you're surrounded by people you don't know. Worse when those "people" aren't people at all.

Interest worms its way past the jetlag after my uncle leaves the podium open. *Did I miss his eulogy? God, I'm terrible.*

With a bald spot wide enough to be a crop circle, El Dos Caras (Two-Face), the one-eyed leader of the Killing Whites, taps at his mic.

"Never have I seen so many under one roof. From us, to the equally as honorable Los Niños Con Armas (The Kids With Guns), to uh," Two-Face grips the pedestal, squinting his one eye. "A clown?"

Seconds later, Two-Face flips the podium, reaching into his collar, producing a golden M1911. Two guards descend on him. One goes for the legs, the other his wrist; both begging and pleading.

"It's Guerrero, boss! It's Guerrero!"

Two-Face grapples one to the ground, cramming the muzzle to his cheek. "Oh yeah? How'd you know?" A click follows his thumb pulling back the hammer. "You with La Muerte Risueña (The Laughing Death) too? You a fuckin’ clown, Alvaro?!"

The sicario, scared shitless, holds out his hands in surrender.

“I ain’t no clown! I ain't no clown!"

Two-Face licks the sweat collecting on his stache, lips curling at their ends as his glare locks with mine. Another agonizing moment later, he backs off, laughing.

"Apologies Alvaro. Can't be too sure with those slippery bastards! Especially this time of year!"

Like clockwork, two others lumber the podium back to its place. One even kicks at an edge to scoot it an inch to the left like it was. Once everyone absconds, Two-Face shambles back to his spot, clearing his throat.

"Where was I? Oh, yeah, you know, back a while ago, when I was two of thirteen from Guadalajara, forming what we are now, El Cana came to me."

I scoot closer, elbows propped on knees to balance my growing intrigue.

“Like a ghost giving an omen: be wary of your brother, she’d say. Be wary and check your brakes!” He waves dismissively. “Yeah, yeah, you old cook. I should put two in your melon for talking to me... Few days later, I get into an accident.  Bad one. Damn near split my melon in two. Now, stop me if you’ve heard this before, but days later, I find out my brakes were cut! By who? My first brother! The one I loved most! So, I had ‘em soup’d!”

Pablo nudges me, jaw dropped in awe, not paying mind to my twitching eyelid. “They put people in soup? Do they eat people? Are they vampires?!”

“... No, Pablo. Vampires don’t exist.”

“To El Cana! And may the world rot having her gone!”

Everyone folds the pews and pushes them aside. Uncle Mateo greets his compadres, together shredding their vocal cords while mariachis strung along. Pablo and Regina sway in a corner. Boots clang; spurs clash; strobes flare; corks pop and fly. *Pop. Pop. Pop.*

I tremble in place, my nerves sizzling and then *POP! POP!* Popping. The shadows transform the corks into bullets. *POP! POP! POP!* Alcohol spurts; the dancers take cover and return fire. *POP-POP-POP-POP-POP-POP!*

Pablo sneaks over, flapping both a Pan de ánimas (bread shaped into a person) and his Snake-Eyes in my face; the bread-man's arm noticeably missing.

“Cee-cee! This man has been attacked! We must call the vampire hunter!"

Following a moment of unrequited silence, he lowers them, sulking.

"I need to pee. Come with?"

“Pablo, you’re thirteen. You don’t need me to," I then think: let my thirteen-year-old brother wander in a dance hall filled with America’s most wanted? Yeah, and let him wander through a minefield blindfolded for his fourteenth too.

“Where’s Tia? Can’t she take you?”

“She’s walking and talking funny again.”

*Of course she is. All that A&A and for what?* “... Keep close.”

A sea of writing limbs digests us; its roars drunken blabber. Pablo keeps his head down below the waves, arms locked around my waist. I puff out my chest, tanking hits from stray elbows. A butt of a gun hits my stomach. I double over, lungs bleeding air. The strobes convulse. Smoke wafts from the helmets and masks, there's a pakol.

The hall plunges into darkness, leaving me bathed in light. Rotor wings whirl above, splicing the light above them. Standing in front of me now, bowtie crooked; coat opened; uniform wrinkled and hair slicked back in a stiff wave: *Garza. Nathan Garza Mendoza.*

Garza’s hand disappears into his collar, fishing around for something inside. His thin smile put to an open flame when he comes back empty. I notice his shirt, undone by a few buttons from the bottom. Without thinking, I close the gap. Our eyes lock; my hands move; electricity surges through my fingertips as they trace his fabric. *I remember this*.

*“Woah- uh? Sorry I was late? I- "*

I blink, realizing I was undoing more buttons than re-doing them. Garza’s hand shoots out. The propulsion fires out a rose hidden under his sleeve. It slips past his grasp, landing near a couple who, too distracted with each other’s lips, trample over its thorny stem. I don’t remember why; maybe it was the alcohol, but I burst seams laughing. It was the night before our deployment, so what better to set the tone of tomorrow? *Why did I never tell him how handsome he was?*

Garza scratches back of his neck, a guilty grin stretching his plump lips. ***POP!*** Red mist sprays on my face.

“Nice gun! Where’d you get the diamonds from?” The stump once Garza’s face gurgles, iron puss bubbling from the chasm.

“¡Aye! Thanks, little man! Wanna hold it?”

Multicolored strobe beams spear Garza’s headless corpse, burning him away into another man. Hunched, with a clown’s smile beaming, Guerrero offers Pablo his gun; pointing it at his chest.

My vision narrows, centering on the nothing behind the man’s eyeholes. I lunge, a wet thwack sends my target stumbling; his pistol clattering; a tooth soaring; finally tripping over himself and collapsing. I pounce on him. Fists shatter shades into shards. Knuckles bash his nose. Nails tear rubber. The warmth smearing my hands like jet fuel to my veins, setting the crimson alight.

Mask caught in my fingers, Guerrero flashes a pleading glare through empty sockets where his eyes should’ve been. It’s then I register what I’m looking at: the sicario’s “face” was skeletal; emaciated. Near parchment-thin skin stretched over and stapled to bone.

What feels like three men rush me from behind, arms coiling around my waist. Their combined strength sends me crashing backward. A boot heel slams onto my back, twisting the flesh underneath. I try to push myself up, only to face hundreds of greasy metal barrels glinting under the lights.

The singer’s mics screech with feedback. On the stage, standing next to grandma’s tomb, stands The Pakol Man, tunic decorated with soda cans linked by wires. Smoke covers its face, rising to be churned in ceiling fans. 

“The Hell’s going on here?!” roars Two-Face, parting the crowd.

One guy goes to check on Guerrero, only to trip back over himself, eyes wide with fright. Two-Face damn near tosses him aside and grabs Guerrero by his scalp; his flesh stretching; revealing bone underneath.

"Had to be you, didn't you?"

Guerrero’s thin lips quiver, his jaw now slanted to the left.

“B-boss!” someone calls out. “Camazotz!”

Two-Face’s one bulging eye centers on me, then the person sitting atop me.

“Well, well, looks like a bat flew out of its cave too early.” *A bat?*

Cold steel hooks cram themselves in my nose, hooks of a hammer latching in my nostrils. forcing me to face the intruder - the Camazotz. I first mistook his rubber mask for a dog, but the lights sharpen its ears; brighten its small, pointy fangs; reflect off its beady eyes and outline its upturned snout.

Two-Face presses his gun against Guerrero's temple. The Camazotz pulls harder. My pulse thrums against the metal. I share a watery glance with Pablo hiding behind another sicario’s leg. *Is this how he sees me die?*

"Judging from those teeth, you're fresh out the back, right? Well, I'm no tyrant, children always need guidance,."

***POP!*** Guerrero drops to his knees; spine bending back; arms retracting. Ink spurts all over the floorboards. Bits of brain spill onto Two-Face's shoes like messy pie filling. Guerrero falls over, rest of himself splashing on another sicario’s pants. “Next time, don’t skip the price of a good mask.”

He points his gun at the Camazotz. "Now you know, do you also know what happens when a thing like you is shot with a hollow-tip silver bullet? And, follow-up, do you wanna find out?"

Ahead of me, a broken leg of Guerrero's shades lay. I coax it into my palm, roll over, and with my might, thrust it upward. Doors slam in the distance, leaving a torn piece of bright yellow mesh impaled on my shiv.

Two-Face groans, hiding away his firearm, then clasps his hands together in another *pop!*. "Amigos! what are you doing with your hands full with no alcohol? Back to it, yeah?"

As he commands it, everyone obeys.

The mariachis strum another melody. The sicarios dance. Two-Face beckons a few over; two to drag Guerrero's corpse, one to wipe down his shoes. Uncle Mateo races over, hoisting to my feet. His forehead lined in stress. “Are you okay? Did they hurt you? Where’s Pablo?! Pablo!”

On cue, Pablo scurries to me, banging his figure on my thigh.

“See! I told you! Vampiros!”

“Shut up, Pablo! Where’s Regina?”

"She's not with you?"

“She was with- Pablo! Hey! Do you know where Tia is?”

Pablo’s weight doubles, slumping to my ankle. I turn to yell, words catching in my throat as we’re dissolved in Two-Face’s shadow. Two guards, wielding pump-action shotguns, stand side by side to him.

“Mateo! My old friend! What’s the matter? The party’s just- “

“We’re leaving Emanuel. Where is my wife?”

Two-Face, or rather, Emanuel’s eye twitches. “... Ain't no need to be rude. We’re friends! No way to treat your friends, right?”

Uncle Mateo cuts between us, going chest to chest with Emanuel. “Rude? RUDE? How about the thing you let in here!”

"Know your place, Mateo. You know they get inside unless someone lets them. My guess is Guerrero, and he's dead. Problem solved."

“Yah! Yah!” hollers Aunt Regina, stumbling her way to us. One hand tight around the neck of a wine bottle. Puffy cheeks glowing; awash in a bright blush. She leans on Emanuel, her giggling filling the small space between them.

“Plu-please, Mateo... Don’t," she trails off. “They didn’t, didn’t hurt them! One more! One more hour!”

Uncle Mateo’s fingers ball into boulders. Emanuel takes full advantage, swiping Regina by the waist. Voice laced in sinister intent as his hand creeps lower.

“She’s right. With this frail thing here, wandering the streets at night, and those things out there, well... who knows what could happen?”

“It’s fine. I was just taking Pablo to the bathroom.”

Emanuel points to me. “See? Your niece understands. No fear, just like her father, God bless his soul. But, to remind you of what friendship means, I’ll have one of my guys escort her outside, yeah?”

Nodding to his left, a guard steps forward, presenting arms to me. A silver cross pendant dangles around his padded neck.

“There we go. Alvaro over here will keep you safe. I’ll bet his head on it. Trained to be the best, better be the best."

Regina breaks from Emanuel to nab my uncle’s wrist. “She’ll be fi-i-i-i-ine! Let’s dance, culero! Make me feel like a woman again!”

As Uncle Mateo is digested by the swarm, Emanuel and his guard following, he tugs down at his eyelid, the message: “watch out."

Outside, Pablo wades through tombstones of scrap metal: caskets glowing under the bright buttermilk moon. Back glued on the wall closest to the chapel doors, I take a breather, gawking at all the vintage vehicles peppered throughout the land; so many restoration projects in the making.

Pablo waves at me through a smudged window. I give a weak, almost limp wave back. Sometimes, I wonder where Pablo would be if I’d never enlisted. Maybe then I’d been there after his accident. Maybe then I’d be a sister worth a damn.

Alvaro stands beside me, shotgun resting in reverse arms. The tip of his makeshift bayonet creaks, bending from him leaning on it.

“... Can you not?”

“Not what? I’m guarding.”

“That. With your gun. Damn blade’s ‘bout to break.”

“Ain’t this like how they do it back where you’re from, gringa?”

“I ain’t no fuckin’ gringa, mamón! Just stop it already!”

Alvaro huffs, inspecting his blade. "You look it to me... You military too, gringa?"

"No."

"Don't lie," he nods to my calf. On it, a tattoo of Rocky the Bulldog captioned: To those we’ve taken, and those we’ve lost - 2007. “I’ve heard all about you. American hero! Just like your dad.”

“My dad’s dead.”

“... Jesus. Just trying to make conversation.”

I unroll my sleeve, prying a hidden carton of Marlboros.

“What’s there to say? Not like I just watched someone get executed or anything."

“He wasn’t someone anymore, you know.”

Cold, oily brass slides across my wrist.

“And besides, that’s nothing compared to what we did to this one guy. We- "

I shoot Alvaro a scowl, bursting him into a hearty snort.

“Guerrero was already dead! Been dead. Weeks maybe from how he looked. Nothing we could do for him.”

I slide my thumb across my lighter's wheel. “Of course. Only a thing like you would say that.”

Alvaro scoffs. “A thing? He was the thing! Me? I’m a good guy. I served, like you! Even did disaster relief!”

I put my smoke to flame, taking a few puffs. “Oh yeah? So you traded saving lives for taking more?"

Alvaro peeks around the corner, reaching into a pouch to pluck a carton of Delicados and his own brass lighter. He nods to a car out in the field, "What car is that? When was it released?"

"Buick Century SS. 1985."

"What else happened in 1985?"

"Wasn't there an earthquake?"

“Yup. The big one. Mexico City. Showed up a day later with orders to save what we could. Machines first, people second, they said."

“Machines?”

“Industrial equipment. Government needed to sew emergency apology sweaters to the survivors."

Bud bright and swirling, Alvaro drinks murky clouds, blowing them back out through his nose.

“Imagine. You wake up crushed. Made to scream, beg. Then, a soldier comes along, asks you if there's any loom weavers around. Of course, with everything crushed, you say no, there's no loom weavers. Next thing you hear, the dude walks off to ask the neighbor, who gives the same answer and to try asking their neighbor! Hah!"

“... Of course. You have jokes. What thing like you doesn’t?”

Alvaro winces, teeth bald to chew on his smoke.

“Can you stop calling me that? I ain’t no thing.”

“Joking like it was a good memory. What thing doesn’t?”

Slinging his shotgun over his shoulder, Alvaro faces me, the grey in his eyes blending with the smoke.

"Good memory? You think it was a good memory when I had to hold a woman down as a doctor cut off her infected arm?”

"I- "

“Or, or, how I carried a two-year-old holding their dad’s severed leg to a baseball field to find his dead mom? Or, how about- "

Alvaro coughs, the hard edges of his words softening through another long, contemplative drag.

“My mother... I used my first paycheck ever to her these nice ruby earrings. Turned out those were the things they needed to identify her body. And you know what? She's not even counted with then 10,000 who died with her!"

A guilty grin finds its way to his stubble.

“Can you imagine that? Being told to value a machine more than your mother?”

The shadows on his face shift, contorting his face into Garza's. It brings back memories; memories cast from the sandbox. A sandbox I don’t think I’ll ever stop playing in.

*"Those people... they were just going to church, and then- “*

*“I know, I know. Today was a bad day, but you made it good. You saved so many. I bet you they’re thanking God you came!”*

*“Enough with that God bullshit, C.”*

*“What do you mean? You saved them! You- “*

*“It’s the way they looked at me. Like it was my fault. Like I’m the reason this is happening to them, and the worst part is, I can’t say they’re all wrong.”*

*“What are you talking about, man? They were probably stressed out their minds. No one gets blown up with a smile.”*

I’ll never forget how Garza flashed his titular smile, that penitent sneer. *"What are we still doing here? Didn't we win already?"*

I blink, shredding his visage off Alvaro’s. Together we share a drag; smoky tendrils intertwining in fleeting strands.

“Guessing you went AWOL? After I mean.”

Alvaro chuckles, “You wouldn’t?”

Almost speaking for myself, I ask: “You ever regret it?”

“... No. Not really.”

My blood boils to steam, wafting through my pores and mixing with the mist below.

“Of course, why try to fix things when it’s easier to make them worse, right?”

A scornful frown upends his self-satisfied smirk.

“Excuse me? We protect people. Unlike your government, we- '

“Protect each other? Like your boy inside?"

“I told you already! He was already dead! A damn ghou- “

A sharp, shrill scream echoes behind him. Alvaro gives me a look of "you that heard too, right?" and I nod, reaching for my nonexistent service pistol. Alvaro twirls around, finger knotted around the trigger. “WHO- who...”

I run up to him undoing the strap of his holster. Before I take his pistol, I too catch what he's staring at. It’s a body. Another sicario. Lime green goggles busted and shirt ripped. Candy-red muscles of his back pulsing. And standing over him, wielding a small hammer, The Intruder - the bat - the Camazotz.

The dying sicario mumbles, “O’ Virgin of Guadalupe, Mother of- grant- grant- “

Hooks come down on the man’s head with a hollow crack. It yanks him up, presenting his throat. Heel click in pursuit, revealing another Camazotz, her skeletal frame blocking out the moonlight shining through a white gown. She squats down, positioning the pail under the sicario and the blade to his Adam’s apple. Like a bow to a violin, she pulls it back. I clamp my eyes shut, air catching in my throat as metal drums with what I wish was rain.

Another Camazotz lands to the left of Alvaro, encased in body armor. A blur of movement and flash of metal slices through Alvaro's forearm. Fresh blood spurts from the stump. The third Camazotz, its eight-ball eyes rolling in its pockets, kicks Alvaro onto me. In the chaos, he retrieves his pistol, a Desert Eagle, hand shaking, voice stammering.

However, the Camazotz puts a finger to his mouth, shaking its head; its fangs too long to speak. It then takes off its glove, palm hugging the gun's muzzle. Alvaro pulls the trigger, a bright flash of flame erupts beneath it. When the smoke splits, my veins freeze into a pulpy slush. Residue smudges its hand. The bullet, flattened, falls into Alvaro's lap.

Heart knocking in my ears, I snap off his silver cross and dig the piece into the creature’s eye. Ebony warmth splatters across our faces. It throws itself back, writhing and scratching at itself. I weave Alvaro’s one arm around me, heaving him over.

Holding my breath hostage, nausea batters my balance. The graveyard wobbles. Strength fading, I hop over the nearest car hood, tumbling over, my fall cushioning on Alvaro's plated chest.

“Cee-cee?” says Pablo, zipping his trousers and taking a bite of his bead-man. “I already claimed this spot. Pee somewhere else.”

The Camazotzes circle their fallen. It snout purses, whistling a faint, gurgled tune. Standing over it, The Intruder hooks its wrist veins, releasing a slurry of black blood over the fallen's face. It swipes the weeping limb away, shaking its head, whistling louder. The woman Camazotz then stomps on its head. More oily essence belches around its lustrous heel, soaking her skirt in a goopy soot.

Alvaro coughs up blood and crumbs, gasping. The Camazotzes freeze in place. That's when it hit me. When they attacked Alvaro, they left me alone. Why? I was holding my breath. Bats use echolocation, vampire bats especially - they must sense breathing!

In a split-second decision, I whisper to Pablo. “Hold your breath.”

Caging the wind in my lungs, I carry him off, leaving Alvaro behind.

“GRINGA! WAIT! COME BACK! COME BACK!”

Coals burn in my stomach. the steam roasts my eyes. *Don’t look back.*

"YOU BITCH!"

The world folds at its edges. I grapple my mouth, suppressing a choked wail. *He's a monster. Just another monster.*

“YOU KILLED ME! YOU FUCKING KILLED ME!"

We push through a maze of cars, racing towards lights twinkling in the blackness. Unable to hold in anymore, air seeps past my lips. The bands holding together my knees buckle. My teeth scrape against the prickly embrace of grass.

I’m back in the dance hall. Garza’s head paves the floor in chunks. At my boots, his mouth on a flap of flesh, grimaces; lips moving; trying to find the right words.

***"YOU KILLED ME, CECILIA!"***

A hot rush of caramelized dough stink blows into my nose, Pablo’s squeaky voice coming through. “Wake up! Wake up! We have help! The vampire hunter is here!”

A choppy cry rips past cracked lips. Bolts shoot through my limbs, flinging me upward. The fuzz around me straightens, tapering into blades; grass blades; a thousand grass blades a shade darker than I left them.

“Ma’am? Are you okay?” asks a voice. Hoarse yet refined. The blades beside me give way under white loafers.

They lead my gaze up two billowing misty paths; a pair of ghostly white bell-bottoms. Tucked into them, a white satin dress shirt, half unbuttoned from the collar and sleeves tucked; hooked like finch wings

"Are you okay?" The man asks again, offering his hand; his skin pallid with thick, ropey veins protruding underneath. I follow them to a toothy grin, half his face covered by a white wide-brimmed hat.

I take his hand, spitting out grass clumps off to my side. "Y-yeah, I'm okay, I'm- "

He heaves me close, my head bounces on his chest. I remember my lips parting, fueled by an urge to yell, but I didn't. I couldn't. All the muscles in my face, all at once, rela. The darkness parts; his face pours through. The man's pupils like tiny black holes festering in seas of iced over white; white like his skin; white like his clothes; his face white like a blank canvas. It was like staring into a star. A cold, dead star.

"Woah there! You buying me dinner first, at least?"

"... What?"

*“I said, give me a second to admire you, at least!”*

Paint runs along the canvas, transforming his face into another's - into Garza's face. The tired glow of his lamp illuminates one side of his face, going so far as his collarbones; kindling his caramel skin.

*“How about I do everything tonight? It’s the man’s job for the first time."*

Garza cups my face. A thumb brushes over my cracked lips. My thighs magnetize to each other, squirming. I burrow my fingers through his locks, jerking him close; his lips mere inches from mine.

*Shut up, and do as you're told, soldier.*

I push him back onto the bed, wrap my hair in a bun and straddle his waist. Before my lips can pounce, I stiffen, agony burning past my cheeks.

*"Something wrong, baby?"* Garza coos, his head missing. Pieces of himself slather on the wall. An eye stares from a piece. Under me, molars gnashing with stifled laughter, under my crouch, Garza's mouth; contorted into a permanent, grotesque smile. *"No one gets blown up with a smile, right? Then blow me."*

I blink, and there's my hands, caught in the middle of undoing the man's buttons.

"Goodness! If I was greeted like that for every funeral, I'd drop by all of them!"

I drop to my knees, holding out my hands. The pads numb; cold. If anyone had given me a blade to cut them off, I would've.

"We've been attacked! By vampires!" Pablo holds out his Snake-Eyes. “He told me you’d come!”

The man turns to squat and meet Pablo eye to eye. I try to scream, my voice bouncing back to me; I try to move, but my legs refuse.

"And he wasn't lying! Tell me, what did these vampires look like?"

Pablo flaps his arms, mimicking a bat.

"They had bat heads! We held our breaths and ran!"

"Hold your breaths? That's new. No one's thought of that! You must be a vampire hunter yourself!" Pablo lights up at the praise. "Tell me, little hunter," the man points over him. "Did they look like that?"

The Intruder drops from the sky. Pablo, already turning to run, screams as it snatches him up. A clawed hand muffles his cries. I stomp one foot forward, pushing with all I can muster. A searing pain erupts from my thigh as metal comes down on it; a rusty machete. The woman Camazotz drags it out, scratching bone and muscle.

"Okay, I've already rummaged through the mansion. Did you guys find, wait." The man spins on his heel, counting his breath. "Where’s Coño number two?”

The intruder's head drops, a tear working its way off a whisker.

"Oh, oh! Coño number three!"

The man, that Sinister Gringo, pins an open palm to his core, a pinky missing, and dangles his other arm out. "Did he sing?" he asks, slow dancing with himself. "Mi pollo no tenia plumas... Y yo quería que volará!”

The Intruder bends his wrist back, showing off his gauze wrappings. Appearing before him, the Sinister Gringo inspects it.

"Vampire bats have this funny trick," he grumbles, waltzing.

"Much like humans, if they don't get enough to eat, they die. However, another one of itself will always feed it. Regurgitates its meal to share."

The Sinister Gringo's nails, long and serrated, smooth over its wrinkly forehead. "Such compassionate beasts they are."

***SNAP!*** In a blur, The Intruder's eyes face backward. Its ear twitches, and then it drops. Pablo pries at its fingers, now struggling against the instant rigor mortis.

"No more turning teenagers. Adults always make better killers."

The female Camazotz shambles onward, tossing a prize to its master's feet. The Sinister Gringo claps its hands, a bloodcurdling cackle escaping his lips.

"Ah! There he is! The big boy! All grown up!"

Alvaro crawls over with his one arm, grabbing the creature's ankle.

"You... YOU!"

A well-timed kick from the Sinister Gringo sends Alvaro reeling into the female Camazotz's reach, lifting him. "Oho! Big man, I say! Where's your big man words today?"

Alvaro huffs, eyebrow split and gushing. "W-what are you doing here? This is holy ground!"

The Sinister Gringo backhands Alvaro. "I go where I damn please! Besides," he faces me, cracking his knuckles. "Besides... I'm here for an old friend." 

Alvaro claws at the empty air. "Leave them alone!"

"Do you believe in fate, Mr. Alvaro?" 

"Fuck you!"

"Easy tiger. Where would be the fun in that? Anyway, I do. I think fate brought us together, brought us all together. So, of course, I came prepared with my finest threads."

Removing his hat, the Sinister Gringo spins it around on a finger, and there, spinning with it, sewn to the back, an ear. And dangling from it, a ruby earring. 

"After all, I couldn't let such refined taste go then, so why let it go now?" 

An equally as sinister laugh erupts from the creature, its lips stretching far beyond the limits of his face; the clamor like rocks rattling in a tin can. Alvaro, given an opening, spits a gout of crimson. The glob lands in its mouth, repelling the Sinister Gringo. “¡La madre que te parió!”

"That's- that's for my mother!" 

Whites of eyes glowing between black slits, the Sinister Gringo's mouth mouth opens. Cheeks lifting and gums protruding. Molars push themselves out, making way for thread-like needs to fill their spaces. 

The female Camazotz yanks Alvaro's head back, offering his throat. Alvaro keeps his smug smirk, even while tears pour past his captors fur. The Sinister Gringo pounces, shoulders rolling; clothes filling out. Alvaro body folds, buckling on itself as the Sinister Gringo leans over him to finish. A few gulp later, he dislodges, his thread-needle-teeth stirring in the night. 

"And here I was expecting a different taste from her."

The Sinister Gringo comes closer, getting down on one knee to mock my petrified stance. "Now, now," he summons a napkin from under his sleeve, padding around his greasy mouth. "Here's the deal. Your grandma took something from me a long time ago, and I intend to now get it back."

With a snap of his fingers, the female Camazotz lurches to a crawl. The Sinister Gringo stands, holding out his hand for the bat to nuzzle into. From his index, a geyser of black blood spews out. The Camazotz's tongue, a lanky appendage, laps the fluid into its mouth. 

"You have until Día de los Muertos to give me her body. For each day you don't, a tragedy will befall you and your family."

Dots, bubbles of void, grow at the corners of my sight; amassing; spreading; consuming me whole.

"Three days, Cecilia. Three days."
