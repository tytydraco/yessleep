My Grandfather passed away about 9 months ago. He left his house to my dad, his only child. My grandfather kept almost everything, basically a hoarder but without the trash. Most things he delegated to cluttered storage in the attic, pole barn and basement. We spent many weekends digging through all of his stuff.


Recently, while searching through the attic, we came across some things dating back to the civil war and just after, all things that belonged to my great great grandfather. I never knew he was in any wars, but my dad told me he remembered my grandpa talking about it once or twice.


Looking through his gear and wartime nicknacks we found his leather bound journal. He had written about many of his days as a Private in the United States Army. Honestly some of the passages in his journal described some pretty unsavory things to say the least. Especially in his time under Cpl. Corcoran during the Indian Wars. So much of his life that I know of was spent helping and hanging around on the nearby reservation with his best friend Atsa. I could not believe he once was at war with Native American tribes.


The most bizarre entry was the last one in the journal. It's been a few weeks and I can’t stop thinking about it. I decided I had to transcribe it for others to read and to hear if any others had  similar stories. Here it is below:


July 1869


We heard of a small Native encampment from a farmer in a town a week back. He said that he thought they might be readying an attack against the town. He sounded mostly unsure but it was all the Corporal needed to hear before giving us the order to march off and find them.


Private Tudor found the encampment last night, they seemed to be having a celebration. We left our supply carts just over the hill to avoid detection and waited until the sun peeked through the cracks of the tall grass. There was no hint of our presence, they were unaware of our incoming ambush.


Corporal Corcoran smiled at us as we lay in a line behind a fallen tree. He raised an arm, the orange sunrise glinting off the metal hook that adorned his nub. Dropping his hand we let loose the first volley shredding the quiet tranquility of the land. 


I reached into my pouch and tore through a packet, that familiar metallic taste of black powder saturated the tip of my tongue. Ram rod already in hand I slipped it smoothly down the barrel before returning it to its home directly under. I placed the firing cap on.


We readied the next volley. Smile, raise, drop, and fire. It was the only time we really saw true joy from the Cpl. 


We initiated our reload again. Two distinct war cries remained and approached our position. The Cpl. reached his hand out for his repeating rifle. A private placed one in his outstretched palm.


He brought the stock to his shoulder and rested his cheek upon it, he took aim. Silencing the first warrior then the second. He continued to push the lever forward and bring it back, silencing the screams of the fleeing crowd of Indians.


He tossed the rifle down to Pvt. Tudor, arms already extended to receive it. The Cpl. chuckled, “Fix Bayonets.” We followed. “Don’t leave any animals alive.”


The troops walked in step towards the village. Bayonets plunged into those unlucky enough to survive the ambush. I searched the huts for any valuables. I always tried to avoid executions, I hated the noise people made, when they sucked in for that last bit of air but found none. So I continued rummaging through the homes.


A group of soldiers laughed from outside my hut, I exited to meet them. The Cpl. and a group of the less kind stood over an older Indian. Blood pooled in the crook of his hip, bullet hole sitting right above his waistline. Eyes closed, he spoke in his native tongue, stringing his words together, long, slow and rhythmic. His head turned, closed eyes staring through lids directly at me. His arm raised loosely, finger extended. His chant grew louder and stopped. He held his eyeless gaze upon me. 


Removing his accusing finger, he raised his hands towards the sky, palms open.  The clouds shifted in front of the sun and wind swept through the village. A chill found its way from the base of my neck through my spine, my hairs to stood upright. I clutched my hat to my head for the gust grew stronger.


The Cpl. did not share in my concern. His attention focused on the man before him. With a disgusted scowl he fired a shot into the man’s temple. His arms flopped to the ground and his body came to rest, slouched into an awkward position. 


“Corporal! Looks to be a big storm approaching!” Private Tudor interrupted. The sky had turned dark as dusk. A faded threatening red hue weaved its way through the clouds as they suppressed all remaining sunlight.


Then the rain came, thick globs sunk into our woolen clothes weighing us down and pooling in our boots.


“We can use one of their huts until this blows over.” said Pvt. Lee.


The Cpl. scoffed at the idea but he knew the decision would be best. “Ready your guns and enter that hut there. We don’t want a repeat of what happened to Private Jacobson.” The Cpl. gestured to the Private being held up by two of his fellow soldiers, blood letting from the deep gash his shoulder.


We entered the largest hut. It was a dome like structure made of hardened mud and reinforced with logs. Smoldering Embers in the central fire stretched dim light through the room, pushing uncanny shadows along the curved hut walls. The interior was mostly empty of furniture save for one chair opposite the only entrance and a large chest surrounded by miscellaneous wears and instruments. Blankets and various padding circled the floor around the fire. Woven sticks, twine, and colorful beads dangled from the ceiling. Behind the chair hung a large tapestry, filled with colors. The center of it looked to be a depiction of a bird, wings spread wide and noble.


“Rip that rug down. Lay our injured on it, least we know the filth haven’t been sitting on that one.” the Cpl. ordered.


The hut was relit as the fire was remade, slowly smoke wove its way up through a small chimney. Men hung their soaked overcoats on the decorations strung to the ceiling. Rain slapped hard onto the exterior of the hut, echoing throughout the dome. Wind whipped the ajar door fully open and rain streamed into the hut. It took two men to push the door back closed and latch it shut. Thunder rumbled low and consistent in the sky.


The men grew bored and the storm grew stronger. Many expressed discontentment with the lack of food as we hadn’t eaten since yesterday. Most had already eaten their emergency rations. Pvt. Jacobson groaned softly from the blood damp tapestry.


The Cpl. became tired of the complaining and while snacking on his own rations he said, “If all you’re going to do is whine, go out to the cart and get some food. While you’re at it, bring some for everyone and grab the medical supplies.”


Pvt. Tudor, ever the pleaser, was immediately up to the task. He slithered into the sleeves of his damp overcoat and unlatched the door. It flung open allowing the wind to flood into the room and rain to further fill the puddle formed on the floor. He paused for a moment staring into the gray fog. He held his cap to his head taking a low stance and marched out into the monsoon. 


Squelching steps drew off into the distance. Rain blended the outline of his body until he disappeared into the storm. With considerable effort the door was shut again.


The men returned to talking and laughing. Pvt. Lee paced around the room observing the hanging decorations and rugs laden about the floor. Inevitably he found his way to the chest on the far wall and picked up a headdress on the ground beside it. He placed it on his head and made a mock war cry, mustering some laughs from the group. The Cpl. jokingly aimed his revolver at him. The laughs stifled a bit. The Cpl. held it for a while until the corners of Pvt. Lee's mouth dropped below a smile, skin whitened with apprehension.


Pvt. Lee removed the headdress quickly and refocused his attention on the chest. Removing its lid he let out a sharp gasp stumbling back, nerves finally taking hold. I hurriedly reached back for my gun as I felt mine do the same.


The Cpl. took aim at the chest, “What’s wrong?” 


“Indian!” The private responded. 


The Cpl. ran over and sighed, “You pansy it’s just a cub.” He reached into the chest and pulled out a small Native boy, no more than six or seven. He tossed him a few feet onto the ground.


“Any more of yas hiding about,” the Cpl. said. The kid looked confused. Corcoran grew angrier. “Are there more!” he said louder.


The kid cowered down and pointed to the roof of the hut. He spoke in quick frightened bursts, “I nee, I nee.”


“What the hell does that mean? I nee?” He felt the letters in his mouth. “You need? Boy, you are in no such position to make demands.” He raised his revolver.


“Corporal!” a soldier called, worry coating his throat. “Private Tudor’s been gone awful long, it’s only about a hundred feet to the cart. Should be back by now.”


“Reckon there’s more out there?” I said. My voice shook as my mind rifled through the implication, an army of vengeful warriors waiting quietly, deep in the storm. The Cpl. didn’t answer, his face twisted with anger and he forced his teeth together hard.


A tap on the shoulder jolted me from my thoughts. The kid had crawled over while the Corporals attention was momentarily diverted.


“Are there more of you?” I whispered. I signaled with my hand pointing at him then at the door.


The child shook his head back and forth, loseley raising his hand, finger meekly outstretched and said, “I nee.” 


My tension laxed. It took me a moment to think of what the child needed. “Food?” I took some of my rations and slipped it over to the child. His brows raised inquisitively. He paused a moment before taking the food and slowly tearing a bite from the dried meat.


The troops sat for a while eyes on the door waiting for the Privates return. Cpl. Corcoran broke the silence, “Send the cub out, tie a rope to him so he dont run off. Maybe he’ll find Tudor or at least get us some of the supplies we sent him out for in the first place.” He stepped heavily over to the kid and grabbed his arm hard. He pulled out an empty medical kit and pointed at it. “This! Ya go out and grab this.” He tapped it over and over until the kid nodded.


“Tie ‘em up and open the door.” The troops followed and tightly winched the rope around his waist.


The kid could barely approach the door; the wind kept him still. He dropped to his hands and knees and crawled out the door muttering some prayer in his native language.


Once again the heavy rain obscured his visage until the rope seemed to simply end in a wall of water and wind. The hut was silent watching the rope shift slowly back and forth in the doorframe. 


We sat watching, minutes slipping by, rope moving far to the right then far to the left until the rope stopped moving for many minutes. 


Then the rope went slack.


“Ready!” the Cpl. ordered. The hut clamored, aiming our rifles at the open door. My mind brought visions of many tall shadows returning in the child’s stead, roaring with anger and our ruin.


The Private on the rope pulled and it became taut again, then slowly drooped down sinking into the mud puddle at the open door. The Pvt. pulled again. Taut then slack. “He’s coming back,” the private said. 


Fifteen minutes passed by when a small shadow appeared in the rain. We hesitated to lower our guns. The child’s details became clearer and he approached the door frame. In one hand he held a med kit and the other a food tin. I let my hammer rest and placed my rifle against the wall.


The Cpl. grabbed the rope and tugged the kid inside, the med kit skittered on the floor and stopped abruptly in the mud. Pvt. Jacobson was flowing in and out of consciousness making very little noise besides uneven, labored breaths. The troops grabbed the kit and quickly went to work on Jacobson.


The kid crawled deeper into the hut and curled up against the nearest wall, cold, wet and exhausted. He looked at me and weakly pointed up. I walked over, removing my knife to cut the rope that had tightened around his waist. Light bits of blood seeping through his waterlogged shirt. He struggled to keep his eyes open until he slipped into sleep.


Men went to close the door again. “Wait,” the Cpl. said, “If the kid made it and no Indians came to save him, it must be pretty safe out there. Tudor probably walked off in the wrong direction and couldn’t get back.”


I interrupted, “Corporal. should we fire a flare, it might give Private Tudor the direction to head to get back to us. Maybe let nearby forces know our position if things get too bad.”


“Storms too thick, no one would see it. Someone needs to go out and get him.” He responded. “Private Lee, you seem to be adept at finding people today. Tie up and go out and find Tudor.”


Pvt. Lee parted his mouth but couldn’t summon a protest. It slowly drifted shut and he went to cinch the rope about his waist. He grabbed the laces of his boots and pulled them tight to keep the water out. One step and the boot was submerged in the now deep puddle at the door. He turned towards the Private on the rope, “If I pull three times, start pulling me back.” 


He knew it wouldn’t help if he was attacked, but it must have made him feel better. He turned back to the door and sucked in the humid air, lightning cracked turning the rain into sparkling glass. Followed closely by a thunder that rattled the ramrods in our rifles. One final breath he pushed off into the torrent, disappearing into the unknown. 


Just as last, the rope shifted back and forth staying taut. Soldiers softly talked to each other all while maintaining constant gaze on the door, noting even the slightest out of place movement in the line. 


The rope stopped and the whispers ceased. The cord was still, only bobbing from the wind and water. Then a quick three tugs came. A moment of pause and the tugs on the rope became frantic. The rope began to shift again moving fast towards the right becoming taut and slack intermittently. The men on the rope started pulling back bringing more and more into the hut. 


The rope halted, unable to be moved by the soldiers. A tug sent some of the men falling forward, hands burnt as they lost progress on the rope, more men joined but it was of no consequence. It ripped faster and faster through the door frame, shifting higher up in the door darting left and right with great speed. 


I ran to help, positioning myself at the front of the rope by the door. I planted my feet and pulled with as much might as musterable. The rope shot to the very top of the frame bending and tearing about it. Past the door the line directed itself straight up into the sky continuing its motion upwards. Rain began to soak my face and coated the abrasions forming in my palms. The rope snaked its way through the soldiers hands until it tore itself from mine and hastily vanished into the great sea above us.


With resistance ripped from my hands I fell to the floor. The door frame stood towering in front of me, giving the nebulous storm beyond it shape. As if an executioner looming. The wind pushed and pulled me, showers drenched my clothes. I felt the storm may take me then. 


I stumbled my way across the hut to the furthest corner from the door and plastered myself against the wall.


The men were quiet, all eyes shifted towards the Cpl. He stood in almost perfect stillness, hook trembling, stare held upon the door. He said nothing.


The child was awake, face gripped with fear, “I nee. I nee. I nee.”


The Corporals hate snapped him out of his trance. His eyes were widened and bloodshot, lips parted, a predator showing its teeth. He removed his revolver from the holster and closed in on the frightened child. He wanted to speak but rage kept his words incoherent and growling. He jammed the gun up and under the child’s chin tipping it up, redirecting the flow of the boy’s tears. Corcorans fingers fumbled on the hammer until the found grip and shifted it to full cock.


The child's eyes made their way to mine a penultimate search for mercy. Thunder rumbled deep through my bones, a bystander to the child’s fate. Terror gripped my mind, but my body moved towards action. I shoved my hand outwards breaking the Corporals line of fire, and threw my body into his. The hammer struck the firing cap and the bullet tore through the cemented dirt. The sky matched the Corporal's anger bursting forth in a flash of power, opening the roof of the hut and leaving the interior subject to the cyclone. 


Hand outstretched I fought the rain to gaze into the sky. The clouds shifted awkwardly, as if a great mass swam through them. It had come to claim us.


Hands trembling from adrenaline and dread I fumbled inside my leather pouch and raised my flare. Pulling the trigger, light shot through the rain up into the clouds, hovering within. The clouds glew orange exposing an immense silhouette. Wings stretched nobly across the sky. It struck them downwards sending wind and thunder with its movement.


It descended from its home above the clouds, lightning flashed in its stead. My eyes closed to accept the end.


Corcoran yelped beside me and a tremendous gust pushed me fully into the ground. On my back I glared into the sky. The shadow moved away and the Corporals screams followed.


The flare had burnt out, the beast slipped into the darkened clouds where the screams stopped. Globs of rain turned warm and thick, it smelled of iron. A flash of lightning illuminated the scene of viscera. We sat on the ground, soaked in blood as the rain continued and washed Corcoran away.


The child took my hand and beckoned me to rise from the mud. He lurched me towards the door confidently and muttered native words in a rhythmic, repeating pattern. Though he was young and meager I felt protected. 


We moved through the raging cascade, thunder cracked and lightning provided sporadic illumination. Gunfire rang out from behind us, flashes of powder and hot metal directed up towards the sky. The silhouette descended once more and I looked away. Screams saturating the land behind us.


The child walked steadfast forward, his words cutting through the showers ahead. We passed by the supply wagons, the wind tore wood from nails and scattered all that was inside. The stored cannons ripped from the cart and flew in short bursts through the air. In contrast the thin trees nearby stood as if monoliths. Leaves shifting like the wind were nothing but a spring breeze. The tall grass bellowed lightly in small ripples. 


I pushed with difficulty against the whirlwind and the child moved me along. Water simply streamed down his face as we walked a few miles. 


Then it stopped, suddenly and without warning. The calm after the storm.


We continued walking for a while, sun and breeze drying our soaked clothing. Over a hill crest we spotted a large group in formation contrasting heavily against the tall grass fields and sparse trees. They were marching towards us.


I called out to them and they answered back, “Did you fire the flare?” 


I told them I had. 


“Where’s the rest of your troop?”


“In the storm. We were part of an ambush. I’m the only one left” I said back. Almost fully back to the platoon.


He looked with solemn understanding, although misplaced. He glanced down to the child, “Who’s this you have with you?”


“A kid from a village we passed through.” I said. Keeping my answers vague in case the inclinations of this commander were similar to that of my old Corporal.


The child excitedly pointed to the sky and said, “I nee, I nee.”


“Chayton” the commander called out. A uniformed Native stepped forward. “He keeps saying he needs something. Could you figure it out?”


The kid and Chayton exchanged some words. The kid shaking his head back and forth at the end of Chaytons sentences. Again he pointed to the sky and said “I nee.” Chayton laughed and said, “He doesn’t need anything. He’s saying Ii’ni. It’s a Navajo word. The constellation of the Thunderbird said to protect the land and its people from destructive forces. If you saw a storm, it’s common for some to associate them with the Thunderbird. He’s probably just excited about the big storm, thinking the Thunderbird brought it and he got to see it.”


I looked at the kid with his finger still pointing at the sky. I brought my finger up and pointed with him, “Ii’ni” I said. A smile took over his face.


Chayton interrupted, “The Navajo have a truce with us, we can help you take him back to his people.”


The statement snapped me back to before the storm and I fully understood the severity of my actions. We not only attacked a village of a tribe who held a truce with us. We slaughtered a village of innocent people trying, like most everyone else, to live a good, peaceful existence.


Maybe cowardly I was not ready to face judgment, perhaps I already had back in the storm. “Please, you take him back to his people. I still have some things I should do.” I leaned down to the child, “I hope to meet you again, one day.”


I deserved punishment, but I would not receive it just yet. I was spared, for now, and I am left wondering what to do with this second chance. With any hope I’ll know for sure, in time.
