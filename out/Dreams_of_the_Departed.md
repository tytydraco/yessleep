My name is Alex. I want to tell you something about myself. Whenever someone I know dies, I start having strange dreams connected to that person. They’re not just dreams — they feel like warnings, like I’m being shown their last moments, the ones I’ll never see in real life.

The first time it happened, I was thirteen. My grandmother was very sick. Cancer was slowly taking her away, and even though she fought hard, she was already too weak. She had stopped walking and, to be honest, was living her final days. One night, I had a dream. I was visiting her, and everything felt normal at first — we were drinking tea, watching TV, talking like usual. Then suddenly, she stood up from her chair, came over to me, and hugged me tightly. I didn’t want to let her go — I just wanted to keep her close. Then she said something I’ll never forget: "People should be valued while they’re still alive." After that, she walked out of the apartment… and I woke up. I was sitting in bed, crying, covered in cold sweat, shaking. After a while, I fell asleep again, thinking it was just a strange dream. The next day, when I came home from school, my mom looked serious. She said, "Son, I need to talk to you. I don’t know how to say this..." I interrupted her: "Just don’t tell me Grandma died." She froze. "Who told you?" "No one," I said. "I just know."

The second time it happened was when my childhood friend died. We’d been close since we were kids — always together, always laughing. But his family moved to another city, and we completely lost touch. The last time I saw him, I was eleven. I was sixteen when I had another dream. We were hanging out in the old yard, climbing garages like we used to, laughing, messing around. Everything felt so real. Then he said, "I have to go now." I didn’t want to let him leave. He walked away, heading in the opposite direction of home. Before he turned the corner, he looked back and said, "People should be valued while they’re still alive." Then he hugged me and said, "Thank you." That’s when I woke up — crying, sweating, shaking. The next day, I found out he’d been hit by a truck. He didn’t survive.

The third time, I was seventeen. It was a guy from my martial arts club. We’d trained together since childhood, but we weren’t close — I barely knew anything about his life. Later, he moved abroad. Then I saw him in a dream. We were training together, paired up for sparring. I didn’t usually train with him, but that time we talked more than usual. We laughed, remembered old training camps, tournaments, stupid moments from the past. When the session ended, everyone left, but for some reason, I stayed behind. It was just the two of us left in the gym. He started saying goodbye, getting ready to leave. I asked him to stay and talk a little longer. He smiled, stayed for a few more minutes, then said, "Thank you, but I have to go." He walked to the door, stopped for a moment, looked back, and said, "People should be valued while they’re still alive." Again — tears, cold sweat, and that same heavy feeling in my chest. The next morning, I heard the news: he’d been hit by a car while crossing the street. He died in the hospital. Maybe that’s why he stayed in the dream a little longer — maybe he was still alive for a short while, just enough for us to talk one last time.

I’ve noticed something strange: before each of these dreams, I start thinking about the person out of nowhere — even if we haven’t talked in years. Out of all those times, the only person I actually spoke to before their death was my grandmother. All of the dreams were vivid, emotional, and unforgettable. Each one felt warm, peaceful, full of good memories — like they came to say goodbye one last time. But when the time came, they always left, and there was nothing I could do to hold them back. Recently, I had another dream. But this one was different. It didn’t come true. I managed to stop it.
