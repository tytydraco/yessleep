I don’t know how long I’ve been dead. Here, time isn’t just lost—it never existed in the first place. The silence is a living thing, thick as fog, b every thought before it can fully form.

I died in a car accident, sudden and violent. I remember the sound of metal crumpling, the cold snap of bones breaking, and then... nothing. I wasn’t a religious man, but I’d hoped for something—peace, light, anything. Instead, I woke up here, to a blinding, oppressive whiteness. Purgatory. I don’t know if that’s what it’s really called, but it fits.

There are others here, too. Shadowy figures, drifting through the vastness of this empty desert like smoke. Their faces are blurred, indistinct, as if their identities were scraped clean by the wind. Sometimes, when I try to focus on them, they seem to shimmer, almost disappearing into the fog. I wonder if I look like that to them.

Maybe they’re already forgotten.

The first thing I learned here is that there’s only one way out. It’s not about redemption, or paying for sins, or waiting for some divine judgment. No, the only way to escape this place is to be completely erased from the world of the living. You must be forgotten—your name, your face, your memory, all of it has to fade. Only then can you move on.

At first, I thought it wouldn’t take long. My wife, my kids—they’d grieve, they’d miss me, but eventually, they’d move on, right? Time heals all wounds, they say. 

They lied.

Their grief held me here like chains, heavier than anything I’d ever known. Every thought my wife had of me, every tear my children shed, was another link. I could feel them, these chains, digging into my flesh, pulling me deeper into the fog. Every prayer, every whispered memory at the dinner table, every glance at the old family photos—they were weights, binding me tighter.

I tried to scream, to beg them to stop. But no sound ever came out. I felt my throat tearing, my vocal cords shredding, but the silence here is impenetrable. It swallowed me whole. And the figures around me—those blurred shapes—they didn’t care. I knew then that I had become one of them, just another forgotten soul, waiting for the world to move on.

But my family didn’t forget. Even after my wife remarried, she still came to my grave once a year, on the anniversary of my death. She’d place flowers, say a quiet prayer, and cry. The first few times, I cried silently as she wept, wishing she’d move on. The last time, I felt nothing but bitterness. Every tear that fell was another shackle.

I watched my children grow up. I saw my son visit my grave, years after I was gone, with his own children. His voice was steady, but I felt his pain, his quiet sorrow for the father he barely remembered. It was a knife in my chest, twisting deeper every time. 

I grew desperate, clawing at the air, trying to push their memories of me away, force myself into oblivion. But every attempt felt like trying to tear myself out of their hearts with bare hands. The love that once comforted me was now an anchor, dragging me down. When I saw my children’s children standing at my grave, asking who I was, I felt the familiar weight of the chains tightening again.

Decades passed. I think. It’s hard to tell here, where the sky never changes, where there is no sun, no moon, no stars—only the emptiness, thick and choking. But eventually, their visits grew fewer, their prayers softer. The chains began to loosen. I felt lighter, as though I might finally float away.

For the first time in what felt like forever, I allowed myself to hope. Maybe I was close. Maybe I would finally slip free from this place, from the silence and the mist. Maybe oblivion wasn’t so bad, if it meant an end to the waiting.

And then... she found it.

I felt it like a punch to my gut, a heavy weight slamming me back into the fog, crushing me beneath it. My name—my name—whispered on the lips of someone I had never met. She found my journal in a thrift store, dusty and forgotten, buried beneath old books no one wanted anymore. She flipped through the pages, curious, wondering who I was, what my life had been.

With every entry she read, I felt the chains tightening again. My soul screamed, but no sound came. I could feel her fascination, her connection to the words I had written years ago, words I’d forgotten long before I’d died. With every page she turned, she brought me back, one memory at a time.

I could see her, as clearly as if I stood beside her. She was sitting in a small, cramped room, the dim light of a lamp casting shadows across her face. Her fingers traced the lines of my handwriting, and I could feel her curiosity, her wonder. „Who was he?” she thought. „What kind of life did he lead?”

I wanted to reach through the fog, through the pages, and tear the journal from her hands. I wanted to scream at her to stop, to forget me, to burn the damned thing and let me fade. But I couldn’t. All I could do was watch, helpless, as she bound me tighter and tighter to this place.

She’s reading it still. Page by page, she’s pulling me back from the edge of oblivion, and I can’t stop her. I’m trapped here, waiting for her to finish. Waiting for the next person who might find the journal after her. 

Maybe I’ll never be forgotten. Maybe I’m already part of the fog, one more shadow lost in the mist, tied to eternity by the memories of people who never even knew me.
