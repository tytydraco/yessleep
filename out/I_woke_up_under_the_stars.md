Searing pain

Cold air

Roaring wind

The sound of splintered wood.

Blackness.

I opened my eyes to a sea of twinkling light on an inky backdrop. 

The first thing I noticed was the silence.

No birdsong. No crunch of leaves under passing animals. Not even the wind. Just the still hush of a forest that seemed to be holding its breath.

I squites to let my eyes adjust slowly, gravel biting into my cheek. Damp soil clung to my lashes, and when I wiped it away, my hand came back streaked with mud and blood. The smell of iron was sharp in my nose.

I sat up, my breath ragged, and saw the state of myself. My hiking jacket was shredded, hanging in limp tatters from my shoulders. My jeans were stiff with dried blood, my boots scuffed nearly to ruin. I lifted my hands. One was whole, the nails cracked and filthy. The other—two fingers were missing at the tips, ragged edges raw and swollen. My stomach turned.

My skin felt wrong. Cold. Not the cold of autumn air, but a deep frost spreading under the surface, as though my blood had been replaced with ice. I pressed my palm against my chest and felt no warmth. My heart beat sluggishly, muffled.

My teeth ached. I probed them with my tongue and frowned. They didn’t feel sharper, exactly, but harder. Denser. Like I could bite through a branch and not chip a single one.

The last thing I remembered clearly was the trail. A short loop I’d hiked after work. I had only wanted air, a break from the fluorescent hum of the office. The sky had been flat gray, the forest already bare-boned with late fall. I remembered the chill seeping into my jacket, remembered thinking: if I don’t come out today, I’ll be trapped inside until spring.

Then—pain. A sudden impact. The snap of branches. A crash. Falling. And then nothing. A blank wall where the rest of my memory should have been.

I staggered to my feet, unsteady. My knees buckled, but I caught myself against the rough bark of a cedar. The forest stretched around me in every direction, unfamiliar. I tried to tell east from west, but the clouds hid the sun.

My stomach growled, hollow and angry. But when I pressed my hand to it, I felt only that same unnatural cold.

And so, without knowing why, I began to walk.

Time blurred. Hours or days—I couldn’t tell. The forest was endless, a maze of dripping branches and tangled roots.

In the daylight I grew weak, nauseated. The gray sky seemed to press down on me, every step heavier than the last. My skin grew clammy, my eyes sensitive. I curled beneath trees to rest, shivering in a cold that came from inside me.

But at night, something changed. The forest seemed clearer, sharper. The darkness did not blind me; instead, it revealed itself in layers I had never known were there. I could see the shapes of trees, the glimmer of eyes in the underbrush. My body steadied, my mind sharpened. The sickness faded.

Still, hunger gnawed at me.

It was the coyote I smelled first—rank fur, musk, and blood. I stirred awake to find it tugging at my leg, teeth sunk into the soft flesh of my calf as though I were already a carcass.

The smell of my own blood hit me like lightning. Something inside me snapped.

With a snarl I didn’t recognize as my own, I lunged. My fingers locked around the coyote’s throat. It yelped, squirming, but my grip was iron. I sank my teeth into its scruff, tearing, ripping. Hot flesh filled my mouth, copper and salt. I chewed, swallowed, ripped again.

The frenzy blurred into red. When I came back to myself, the coyote was nothing but a ruin of bones and scraps. Blood smeared my face, thick on my tongue.

And for the first time in days, I felt good. Whole.

The sluggishness in my chest eased. The color returned faintly to my hands. The loose, unhealed wounds knit tighter. I flexed my shoulders and felt almost… strong.

But then came the nausea. A tightness in my stomach, swelling to agony. I fell to my knees, heaving, but nothing came—no bile, no blood. Instead, with a tearing spasm, I coughed up a dry mass that clattered to the ground: a tangled wad of fur, splinters of bone, bits of hide.

It looked almost… familiar.

I retched again, another pellet tumbling out. My throat made a noise as it forced its way up—a low, mournful sound, almost like the wail of a loon, broken into short howls. The sound startled me. It hadn’t come from any human throat I knew.

When at last the convulsions stopped, I sat gasping. The pellets lay in the dirt, grotesque. And then memory struck—grade school science. Owl pellets. They looked like owl pellets.

I wiped my mouth, trembling. The taste of blood lingered, both foul and intoxicating.

The hunger had quieted, but it would not be gone for long.

The forest was different now. I moved easily through it under the crescent moon, even through the heavy quilt of cloud. I could see every branch, every burrow. The night did not hide; it illuminated.

And with it came the hunger again.

An owl swooped low ahead of me, clutching a rabbit in its talons. The sight ignited something primal. I lunged, faster than I thought possible. My hands closed around feathers and fur. The owl screeched, the rabbit thrashed, and I tore them both apart with a ravenous joy.

Again the fullness. Again the sickness. Again the retching, the dry cough, the horrible pellets expelled into the leaves.

Each time, that same low howl shuddered from my throat.

The forest grew quiet after. Too quiet. No rustle of deer, no chatter of raccoons. Even the wind seemed to die. A heavy silence pressed on my ears.

I felt it then—the gaze. Something was watching.

And then I saw it: a figure half-hidden in the trees. Cloaked, tall, its outline wavering between human and monstrous. For a moment it seemed like a harpy, wings folded around its form. Then like a man in a long tattered coat. Its eyes glowed pale.

I froze.

The figure moved. The next instant I was airborne, a massive force striking my side. I crashed into a tree branch with bone-rattling force.

“Get out of my land!” the figure shrieked, voice both human and not.

Pain tore through my ribs. I staggered upright, demanding to know who—what—it was.

It descended upon me, talons at my throat.

The creature’s face was pale, hawkish, lined with age. His nose curved sharp, his eyes bright as stars. His mouth curled in disgust as he squeezed my throat.

Then—hesitation. Recognition flickered there.

He dropped me. I crumpled to the ground, gasping.

“Go,” he said, voice tight. “Leave this place.”

“No,” I rasped. “Tell me what you are. Why you attacked me.”

His wings rustled, feathers black as pitch. He looked away, then back, something tortured in his expression.

“I’m sorry you are here,” he said. “But your presence—I cannot abide it.”

“What the hell are you talking about?”

“It is my fault you have become what you are now. I attacked you on the trail.”

The words struck like ice water. I remembered—shadows overhead, the blow that sent me falling.

“I should have finished it,” he said. “But the sun was too high. My strength too weak. There were hikers nearby. I could not risk being seen.”

He bowed his head. “And so you lived. Half-changed.”

I staggered back. “Half… what?”

His eyes glittered. “One of the Night Kind.”

The words hung between us.

He explained in slow, deliberate tones. The Night Kind had hunted the forests longer than memory. They were not vampires, not as stories told, though some might call them that.

“Yes, blood is food,” he said, pacing. “But it is inefficient. Once the heart stills, blood thickens, congeals. Most of it is lost. Far better to consume flesh, rich with what life left inside, and cast out the waste.” He gestured to the pellets at my feet. “As you have already discovered.”

I shuddered.

“Most are territorial,” he continued. “Hunters. Fliers like me cover vast ground, and so we must guard what is ours. Your… purge calls led me here. To you.”

“Why me?” I asked. “Why did this happen?”

He grimaced. “Because I was careless. Because I let you live. Normally there is nothing left. We consume everything. When we do leave a body, it does not rise. But you—” He shook his head. “You are among the rarest. What we call a blender. One who can live among humans, should you choose… It is… not easy. But there are those who seem to have accomplished it.”

The word sat heavy on my tongue. Blender. Between two worlds, neither one nor the other.

He softened, just slightly. “My progenitor…. My mother… They were like you… able to hide in plain sight. She wanted me to be like you. But after several years I developed the feathers you see before you and I became a danger to her. She abandoned me far from here. She had skill I never learned. Perhaps you can find one of your kind to guide you. They survive by cunning, not by hunting alone. Less territorial. More patient.”

“Why are you telling me this?” I asked.

His expression hardened again. “Because your presence gnaws at me. I feel hunger rising even as I speak. You must go, but I am too weak to make you. I hope that you will leave me to my solitude. Leave this land until spring, when life returns and prey is plentiful. Then perhaps I will have answers.”

He spread his vast wings, shadow blotting the sky.

And then he was gone, vanishing into the clouds.

The forest was silent again.

I stood alone beneath the clouded moon, breath ragged. My hands trembled, my stomach knotted with hunger and fear.

Night Kind. Blender. Predator. Outcast.

I walked, slowly at first, then faster, until the lights of the distant village shimmered faintly through the trees. A day’s walk, perhaps less with my new strength. A world still within reach.

But could I go back? Could I live among them, smelling their blood, hearing their hearts beat? Could I sit in an office again, laugh over drinks, touch another human hand?

The memory of tearing flesh rose up hot and sharp. The taste of blood still clung to my teeth.

I clenched my jaw and walked on.

Above me, the clouds shifted, revealing a sliver of moon. Its light washed my face, pale and cold.

By spring, he had said. By spring, I might find answers. By spring, perhaps, I might return to life a little.

Until then, I walked into the dark.
