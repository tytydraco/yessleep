As a professor, for thirty years, I have devoted myself to the study of death legends in cultures across Europe, recording funeral customs, resurrection myths, and tales of ferrying the dead with the detached precision demanded by academic rigor. I have researched Viking ship burials, Welsh sin-eaters, and the peculiar phenomenon of the “Wild Hunt” persisting in Germanic territories. 

I never imagined these academic pursuits would become my autobiography, nor that I would be summoned to witness what I can only describe as the hand of God operating in tangible form in our fallen world.

My daughter Viola died on March 16th of this year, exactly eight months after her cancer diagnosis. The oncologist called it glioblastoma multiforme, always using the full Latin name, as if formal medical terminology could contain the horror embedded in those words. She was only twenty-three, a cellist in an orchestra. When she passed, I held her hand in a hospice in Warwickshire, pretending the morphine-induced calm on her face was not her true death.

I had not prayed in twenty years. My academic work had thoroughly eradicated the remnants of faith from my Church of England upbringing. I studied religious narratives as cultural products; resurrection myths as psychological mechanisms for coping with grief. When the hospital chaplain offered to pray with us, I politely but firmly declined. My wife Catherine nodded gratefully, understanding my refusal. We were both rationalists. We faced death like materialists, with a dignified acceptance of annihilation.

The funeral proceeded routinely. Church of England rites, but it felt purely performative, an empty ceremony to comfort elderly relatives. Cremation, followed by a respectable memorial at the university club. Colleagues from the anthropology department offered condolences with an awkward sincerity; they were more accustomed to studying dead cultures than confronting raw, personal loss. My wife Catherine managed everything with efficient administrative competence—she organized, responded, thanked everyone for coming, yes, it was sudden, she suffered little. I nodded and shook hands, calmly observing my own numbness as if from a comfortable academic distance.

In the empty weeks that followed, my research took a new direction, accompanied, though I did not realize it at the time, by the first stirrings of what I can only call grace.

I found myself unable to continue the monograph I was laboring over on agricultural folk rituals. The material seemed irrelevant; the arguments I had constructed suddenly revealed their impracticality. When Viola was reduced to ashes in a biodegradable urn on Catherine’s bedside table, what did it matter whether the Abbots Bromley Horn Dance originated from Celtic deer worship or later Norman hunting customs?

So I began pulling different books from the shelves. Stories of resurrection. Cosmologies of the afterlife. The mechanisms by which human cultures attempt to reconcile the boundary between life and death. But now I read differently. Where once I had cataloged these beliefs with anthropological detachment, now I began searching for patterns, for commonalities that might suggest something beyond mere cultural construction.

The story of Lazarus particularly confounded me. I had always interpreted it as typical Johannine theological embellishment, a miracle story foreshadowing Christ’s resurrection. But rereading it, I was struck by details I had overlooked: the four days in the tomb, the explicit mention of decay, the sisters’ desperate faith. What if these details were not embellishments but documentary? What if the author of John’s Gospel was recording something that actually happened?

My research began to uncover strange phenomena. Across vastly different cultural contexts, resurrection narratives shared structural elements with a consistency that seemed to exceed narrative convention. The name of the deceased must be repeated. Specific lunar phases are observed. Blood offerings are ubiquitous. The resurrected often return in a transformed state, possessing what scriptures describe as divine or angelic qualities.

What if these commonalities did not point, as I had always assumed, to universal psychological patterns, but to something more literal? What if humanity, across ages and civilizations, had truly discovered mechanisms for breaching the boundary between life and death?

Catherine noticed the shift in my research focus. “Thomas, this is unhealthy,” she said one evening at 2 a.m., finding me at my desk surrounded by open books. “Grief takes many forms, but obsession…”

“This is not obsession,” I replied, calmly I thought. I was merely exploring a new avenue. The evidence for resurrection beliefs across cultures was startlingly consistent. My prior work had been too dismissive, too quick to pronounce.

“These are just symbolic narratives.”

She looked at me, her eyes seemingly cried dry weeks ago. “You’re trying to find a way to bring her back.”

“I want to understand why every culture believes it’s possible. It’s a legitimate academic question.”

But perhaps she was right. Perhaps the way I was reading, cross-referencing, poring over obscure journals and interlibrary loan requests, carried a particular desperation, as if searching for a pattern, a key clue I had missed before. Perhaps, though I would not admit it then, I had begun to hope these patterns pointed to something real.

It was in this state that I first encountered mention of the *Codex Resurrectorum*.

The reference appeared in a footnote in a 1923 article in the *Journal of the Folklore Society* by one Cartwright—I did not know the name. The article itself concerned apocryphal saint legends in the English Midlands, but Cartwright mentioned a manuscript in the possession of a private collector in Birmingham containing “extremely bizarre and theologically incoherent accounts of resurrection, either a medieval joke or…” “confused memories of Celtic mythology erroneously recorded by later Christian scribes.”

Cartwright noted in particular that the text claimed Christ himself had died twice—once at Golgotha, and again decades later in Asia Minor—and that only through the second death and resurrection did He achieve full divinity. “It is difficult to imagine a more thorough heresy,” Cartwright wrote, “yet the manuscript presents these claims with the calm authority of chronicle rather than mystical vision.”

The footnote offered no further details. I could find no other publications by Edmund Cartwright. The British Library catalog had no entry for *Codex Resurrectorum*. Exhaustive searches of manuscript databases yielded nothing.

Had I not been in a state of heightened receptivity to such curiosities, I might have dismissed it entirely. But the claim of Christ’s double death lingered in my mind. Absurd, of course, contravening all canonical texts and creeds. Yet it had a compelling quality. What if the resurrection narratives we possess are incomplete? What if there exist suppressed traditions, pre-dating Roman incursion, containing practical methodologies rather than theological abstractions?

Through a university contact in Birmingham, I learned of the Ashford collection, a private library assembled in the late Victorian era by industrial magnate Harold Ashford and largely preserved intact by his descendants. I discovered Ashford had been a spiritualist and comparative religionist. He was particularly interested in so-called “practical theology”—the application of religious principles to tangible outcomes.

The current curator was initially reluctant to allow a visit. “Mr. Ashford’s interests were somewhat unusual,” she explained over the phone. “The family prefers the collection remain private.”

I persisted. I may have mentioned Viola. I may have framed my research to Mrs. Peabody as grief-related bibliotherapy rather than serious scholarship. In any case, I was eventually granted an afternoon.

Ashford House in Edgbaston was a sprawling Victorian Gothic pile testifying to former industrial wealth and eccentric collecting. The lady, a stern woman in her sixties, led me through rooms of glass cases filled with fossils, taxidermy, and dubious Egyptian artifacts to the library.

“Mr…. Ashford had some peculiar hobbies,” she said, gesturing at the shelves. “Spiritualism, theosophy, comparative religion. And some genuine medieval manuscripts, I suspect acquired through less than legitimate channels. Everything is cataloged, in a rather idiosyncratic way. The manuscript section is in the corner.”

The *Codex Resurrectorum* was filed under “Theological Curiosities.” It was smaller than I expected—perhaps forty vellum leaves bound in what appeared to be eighteenth-century leather, though the manuscript itself was clearly older. The Latin was medieval, the hand consistent with thirteenth- or fourteenth-century English scribes. Marginal annotations appeared in what looked like Elizabethan secretary hand, later supplemented with Victorian English notes, probably Ashford’s own.

I photographed every page with my phone, aware she was hovering disapprovingly nearby, making my time limited.

Only later, back in my Coventry study, did I begin reading it seriously.

As Cartwright had said, the text was profoundly strange. It began with what seemed a conventional account of the Passion and Resurrection, thoughtfully rendered. It diverged sharply from the canonical Gospels. But then it advanced claims I had never seen in any apocryphon. According to the codex, Christ did indeed rise on the third day and appear to the disciples. But the resurrection was incomplete. He returned to earthly life, not eternal life. He remained subject to death.

The text claimed Christ lived another thirty-seven years, traveling east to Ephesus and beyond, teaching a small circle of disciples the true science of resurrection. Then, at age seventy, he died again—not violently, but peacefully—and was buried by these secret followers.

But the text insisted that on the third day after this second death, he rose again, this time fully. He became the “twice-made divine” (*divinus iteratus*), no longer subject to death or decay, existing in a perfected form beyond human limitations.

By orthodox standards, this theology was absurd. It undermined the hypostatic union of divine and human natures, suggesting Christ was not fully divine during his ministry. It contradicted the Ascension narrative. Yet it was not presented as allegory or mystical vision but as meticulous historical chronicle, with geographical details and witness names.

More shocking was the codex’s description of the double-resurrection mechanism. It presented this as a paradigmatic process, not a singular miracle—a pattern replicable under proper conditions. The codex emphasized that Christ had shown the way. Through specific commemorations, namings, and sacrificial rites, death itself could be reversed. This was not merely the soul’s redemption in some abstract afterlife but true bodily resurrection, a genuine return to life, transformed and perfected.

The text included detailed instructions, ritual structures, specific linguistic formulae, and requirements for timing, location, and offerings. It was less a theological treatise than a technical manual, a recipe for crossing the boundary between life and death.

I should have recognized this as typical medieval religious syncretism—Christian narrative mixed with folk magic, ultimately theological nonsense. I had seen similar texts before, grimoires and enchiridions blending liturgical fragments with pagan incantations.

Yet I read it again and again.

Because in the depths of my grieving chest, a faint voice whispered: What if it is true?

I was trained to recognize patterns. That is the essence of folklore studies—identifying recurring themes across cultures and periods, mapping how narratives evolve in transmission between communities, analyzing how symbolic structures encode social meaning.

The *Codex Resurrectorum* contained patterns I knew. The naming vigil it described resembled ancestral customs in numerous cultures—the Roman *Lemuralia*, Chinese ancestor veneration, Mexican *Día de los Muertos*. The blood requirement echoed Levitical sacrifice, Vedic rites, Greek mystery religions. The lunar timing aligned with agricultural festivals worldwide.

What if these similarities did not stem from humanity universally constructing similar myths, but from humanity universally discovering fragments of a real methodology? What if the codex was not medieval fantasy but preserved ancient knowledge—a true spiritual science suppressed by the Christian establishment as too dangerous, too powerful, too easily abused?

I began testing the codex’s methodology, telling myself it was purely an intellectual exercise.

The naming vigil required reciting, in chronological order, every memory of the deceased from birth to death. This must be done in a specific location—ideally where the person died, but alternatively a space closely associated with them. The recitation must be complete, omitting no significant memory, and conducted over consecutive nights following the codex’s lunar calendar.

Viola’s room remained largely as she left it. Catherine had boxed some clothes for donation, disposed of the cancer medications, but kept the rest—books, photos, the small wooden music stand she used for practice. The cello sat in its case in the corner, untouched since diagnosis.

I could conduct the ritual there. Catherine need not know.

I began in early May, timing the vigils to what the codex called the “dark ascension”—the nights following the new moon when the veil between yin and yang worlds was thinnest. Before beginning, I purified the space as instructed. I lit twelve candles, one for each apostle, then recited the incantation—a variant of *Veni Creator Spiritus* with strange alterations.

Then I began weaving Viola’s life into the words. Memories.

She was born twenty-three years ago at Walsgrave Hospital. How she looked, cheeks red with crying, furious at the cold world. Catherine weeping with joy, exhausted; me holding my daughter’s tiny form, terrified of her fragility. Her baptism at Holy Trinity Church, though I did not believe in the rite’s efficacy then, but now I recalled the priest’s words: “We receive this child into Christ’s flock,” and wondered if those words had marked her for some purpose I did not understand.

I recounted her childhood with ethnographic precision, yet laced with emotion I could not suppress. Her first word: “bird,” pointing at pigeons in the garden. Her obsession with horses at five. Discovering the cello at eight—it seemed too large for her at first, then suddenly fitting. That Christmas she played a simple *Silent Night* for us; Catherine and I exchanged glances, realizing our daughter had found her calling.

I spent hours each night verbally reconstructing Viola’s life. Her teenage years: the usual tensions with Catherine, her fierce determination to attend the Royal Northern College of Music, the boyfriend in her second year who broke her heart—we never met him. Her growing musical mastery, the unique timbre she brought to the Elgar concerto, the way she surrendered completely to the instrument when playing.

I painfully recalled her final year. The headaches she dismissed. The vision problems that finally forced a doctor’s visit. The MRI scan—I remembered the screen, the terrible white mass looking like an invader from another world. The surgeon’s cautious explanation that surgery was impossible. Failed clinical trials. Her weakening body, her frustration at no longer being able to play. Finally the morphine, and her last words to me: “Daddy, don’t be sad. I’ll see you in the next life.”

I thought then it was morphine-induced delirium. Now I began to wonder if she knew something I did not. That she would return in some form.

Night after night I spoke these words aloud, following the spirit book’s instructions, thinking myself rigorous when I was only deepening belief. Because things began to happen.

The changes were subtle at first. I attributed them to psychological projection, the well-documented phenomenon of grief hallucinations in bereaved parents.

On the seventh night, I smelled her perfume, the Asian sandalwood she loved most. On the tenth, I heard what sounded like cello string resonance, overtones lingering in the air though no one played. On the thirteenth night—only now do I note the number—at 3 a.m., I woke convinced someone stood at my study door watching me work.

3 a.m. In Catholic tradition, the hour of mercy; in some accounts, the hour of Christ’s agony. The hour when the veil between worlds is thinnest.

I began keeping detailed records, and I began to pray. It felt strange at first, awkward, the words rusty from disuse. I had not prayed since university, and even then perfunctorily. But now I found myself addressing God, tentatively at first, then with growing conviction, asking whether what I experienced was real, whether I was being led or deceived, whether this work was sacred or profane.

I received no verbal answer. But the signs grew stronger. She was guiding me.

The perfume grew stronger, concentrated near Viola’s music stand—impossible as residual scent after months. The cello sounds became more frequent, always specific phrases Viola practiced, never random notes. Objects in her room began to move. At first minor: a photo I had placed face down turned over, a book opened to a specific page, sheet music arranged in Viola’s habitual difficulty order.

Catherine noticed I was not sleeping. “You’re not sleeping,” she said. “You look terrible, Thomas. You need to see Dr. Albright.”

“I sleep well enough,” I replied—not entirely a lie. I did sleep, but only after the vigils, usually at dawn. My dreams were vivid, filled with medieval resurrection paintings I vaguely remembered: Christ stepping from the tomb, Mary Magdalene in the garden, Lazarus stumbling out in grave clothes.

“What are you doing in there?” She meant Viola’s room. She had not entered since the funeral.

“I’m praying,” I said, surprised to find it true.

She studied my face; I could not read her expression—worry mixed with something else, perhaps fear. “You haven’t prayed in twenty years.”

“I was wrong not to. I was wrong about many things.”

“Thomas, please. This is grief. It’s making you think—”

“That God might actually exist? That resurrection might actually happen?” Yes, it was making me think these things. I was beginning to believe I had been blind, willfully so, hiding behind academic detachment to avoid confronting ultimate questions.

She left the room without replying; I continued the vigils with renewed purpose.

The text warned that the process would produce what it called “manifestations” (*videntia*)—as the vigils continued, these visions or presences would grow clearer. The text emphasized these were not hallucinations but the “initial condensations” of resurrection itself. The dead were returning but not yet fully. They existed in what the text called the “inter-world” (*inter-mundus*)—the liminal space between death and rebirth, the space Christ occupied from Friday afternoon to Sunday morning.

On the twenty-first night, completing three weeks of nights—the “first naming cycle” of the text—I finally saw her.

She stood by the window, silhouetted against the streetlight. She was not fully corporeal, more a disturbance in the air, a place where reality seemed slightly condensed. But unmistakably Viola. The angle of her head, the set of her shoulders… the figure was both intimately familiar and utterly impossible.

I spoke her name. The figure turned toward me; though I could not see her face clearly, I felt a current of recognition pass between us.

“Viola,” I said again, adding this time, “In the name of Christ who conquered death, I call you back.”

The words came unbidden, not from the ancient book but from somewhere deeper, from a knowledge I did not realize I possessed.

The figure lingered a moment, then dissipated like morning mist.

I fell to my knees weeping, not from grief but from an inexpressible certainty. She was there. She was responding. The boundary between life and death was not absolute. The ancient book was truth. Christ’s conquest of death was not metaphor but real power, accessible and applicable under proper conditions.

For the first time since Viola’s death, I felt something other than grief. I felt hope. And more than hope—I felt the presence of God, working miracles through my feeble efforts.

The codex stipulated that the second naming rite must be conducted differently. The first rite reconstructed the deceased’s earthly life; the second required what the text called “divine namings” (*nomina divinitatis*)—naming divinity. The practitioner must speak not memories but attributes; must transform biographical recollection into something closer to litany or doxology.

I understood what this meant. I must describe not who Viola had been but what she was becoming through the power of resurrection. I must narrate her transfiguration, paving the way for her return just as Christ’s resurrection paved the way for the general resurrection at the end of days.

This process now felt less like academic inquiry, less like applying folkloric methods to an interesting text. It felt like participation in sacred mystery. Each night of vigil I began with *Veni Creator Spiritus*, invoking the Holy Spirit to guide my words, to make me a worthy vessel for this work.

On the next new moon, I began the second cycle. I no longer recounted memories but spoke attributes. I described Viola’s goodness, her keen intelligence, her capacity for joy. I enumerated her talents, her courage, her singular beauty. Hers. But I spoke not of past qualities but present and eternal realities, the aspects of her soul death could not erase.

“Her music was prayer,” I surprised myself saying one night. “When she played, she unknowingly praised God. Every note was worship. She was holy without knowing it.”

The codex demanded more than eulogy. It required describing what it called “post-mortem merits” (*merita post mortem*)—merits beyond death, qualities sufficient to justify resurrection. I must explain why Viola deserved return, why reality itself should bend for her resurrection.

This was difficult. By what right did I claim my daughter merited resurrection more than the millions of other unjust deaths daily? I struggled for nights, stammering, uncertain of my ground.

Then, on the ninth night of the second cycle, I heard a voice.

I do not mean metaphorically. I heard a real voice, clear and authoritative, resonating in my mind. It said: “She is mine. I marked her from birth. Her death is not ending but transformation. You are called to witness the return of a saint.”

I trembled, prostrating myself. “Lord?” I whispered, scarcely daring to hope this was truly God speaking to me.

The voice came again: “You have been faithful in small things. Now I show you great things. Continue the work. Do not doubt. What I have joined, death cannot separate.”

I wept then, overwhelmed by grace and awe. It was settled. God had spoken to me. God was confirming this work. I was not deluded. I was not mad. I was participating in a genuine miracle, witnessing firsthand the resurrection power Christ released into the world.

From that night, I spoke in the vigils with new authority. I no longer petitioned or hoped. I declared, proclaimed, cooperated with divine will.

“Viola Catherine Mercer, daughter of God, sealed by Christ’s blood, chosen by resurrection power, I summon you forth. As Lazarus Forthwith summoned, as Jairus’s daughter was summoned, as the son of the widow of Nain was summoned, return to new life, transformed. Return perfected. Return to manifest God’s glory in the world.”

And the manifestations grew stronger.

She appeared more frequently now, always in that half-manifest state, always untouchable yet increasingly clear. Her face became more defined, then her face—no longer gaunt from morphine as at the end, but younger, healthier, somehow flawless. Her features took on the clarity of icons, simple and noble.

The cello sounds grew louder, more complex. Sometimes I heard complete phrases of pieces she loved—the opening of the Saint-Saëns concerto, fragments of Bach suites. But sometimes I heard music I had never heard—impossibly beautiful, polyphonic textures far beyond what a single cello could produce.

“She is learning to play in heaven,” I realized suddenly one night, speaking aloud. “She is being tutored by angels, and she practices here, in the space between worlds.”

The voice came again: “Yes. You understand now. Death is not ending but schooling. She is being perfected, prepared for return.”

I began reading Scripture voraciously, the first time since a brief stint in divinity school during graduate studies. But I read differently now—not as cultural artifact but as living text. 

The resurrection stories blazed with new meaning. Lazarus stumbling from the tomb in grave clothes, Christ appearing to Mary in the garden, Thomas touching Jesus’s wounds—these were not metaphors or myths but records of actual events proving death’s boundary could be crossed.

I studied Paul’s epistles with particular attention. “Death has been swallowed up in victory,” Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians. “Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?” I had always read this as metaphorical hope, poetic consolation. Now I understood it as direct ontological description. Christ had indeed conquered death. The power was here. The way was open.

One morning Catherine found me asleep at my desk, the room icy because I had left the window open all night, candles burned to stubs around me. She confronted me again. “Thomas, this has to stop. You’re making yourself ill. Please, please talk to someone—”

“I am talking to someone. I am talking to God. And God is answering.”

She stepped back, fear flashing across her face. “Listen to yourself. This is psychosis, Thomas. Grief-induced psychosis. A doctor can prescribe something—”

“I don’t need medication. I need you to have faith. Viola is coming back, Catherine. God has promised. I have seen the signs, I have heard His voice. This is real.”

“Viola is dead!” she shouted now—I rarely heard her raise her voice. “She is dead, Thomas! She is ashes in an urn! No amount of prayer, medieval nonsense, or delusion changes that!”

I looked at my wife, pitying her unbelief. “You are like the apostle Thomas,” I said softly. “You will not believe until you see. But that’s all right. You will see. Soon you will see her returned, and then you will believe.”

“I want to leave here,” she said suddenly, her tone flat. “Pack your bags. Go to your office or a hotel. I can’t watch this anymore. I can’t watch you descend into madness.”

“I am not mad, Catherine. I am clearer now than ever. I finally understand what is true.”

“Then prove it. Show me evidence, something more than your deteriorating mental state.”

“You will have evidence. When Viola returns, you will have all the evidence you need. Until then, if you wish, I can leave. But I will not abandon the work. I am too close. The third cycle begins in three days.”

That afternoon I left with a suitcase, moving into my university office. My colleagues avoided me. I was aware I had missed weeks of lectures, ignored emails, absented myself from meetings. I vaguely knew I was likely to be dismissed, but it did not matter. My true work was not academic; my calling was sacred.

According to the codex, the third and final cycle required what the text called the “ultimate dedication” (*dedicatio culminatus*). The practitioner must offer part of himself, must sacrifice some of his own life force to complete the resurrection. The text compared this to Christ’s passion, suggesting all resurrections require blood sacrifice, life poured out that life might be reborn.

The instructions were specific, drawing heavily on Levitical sacrifice imagery. For seven consecutive nights, I must cut a vein—the text suggested the left wrist, symbolizing Christ’s wound—and let blood drip onto an object belonging to the deceased. While the blood fell, I must not speak of the dead but of what I was willing to sacrifice for their rebirth. I must offer myself, becoming the bridge between life and death as Christ had been.

“Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.” I quoted Hebrews on the first night of the third cycle as I prepared. I had everything ready: Viola’s cello bow, a clean razor blade, bandages. I lit the twelve candles and added a thirteenth for Christ himself.

I understood I was crossing a line. I understood that from a secular perspective I was self-harming under religious delusion. But I also understood that Abraham had been willing to sacrifice Isaac, that God had sacrificed His only Son, that religious history is a history of sacrifice. The secular world had long forgotten the wisdom of the ancients: the sacred requires sacrifice, transformation demands cost, life is only gained through death.

I used Viola’s bow, the one she used in her last performance before diagnosis. I made a small cut on my left wrist, letting blood drip onto the white horsehair while speaking words that welled up as if given by the voice guiding me through this journey.

“Lord, accept my offering. My blood for her life. My sacrifice for her return. As Christ bled for the world, I bleed for my daughter. Let this be acceptable to You. Let this complete the redemptive work You have begun.”

The pain was negligible. In candlelight the blood looked black, pooling on the white hair. I watched it drip, and Viola’s presence intensified dramatically.

She appeared in the center of the room, more substantial than before. I could see her face clearly—beautiful, perfect, radiating inner light. Her eyes open, gazing at me with an expression I can only describe as love transfigured.

“Daddy,” she said, her voice Viola’s but different, carrying a resonance beyond the physical.

“Viola!” I cried, tears streaming. “You’re coming back! God is bringing you back!”

“Yes,” she said, smiling impossibly. “You have been so faithful. Just a little longer. It is almost complete.”

Each night of that final week I repeated the ritual. Carefully making small cuts to avoid serious injury yet provide the required blood offering. Each night Viola became more real, more clear, more vividly herself yet transformed.

By the seventh night I could see her fully. She stood in the room’s center, fully present, fully visible, but her transformation filled me with awe. 

Her face retained Viola’s features yet possessed the awe-inspiring beauty of medieval saint portraits—simple, perfect, no longer merely human. Her eyes too large, too bright. Her proportions subtly altered, as if gently reshaped to divine rather than human genetics.

She wore white, but I could not tell if it was clothing or some radiance emanating from within her, shining outward. Around her head I seemed to see a halo, or perhaps light bending strangely around her presence.

“The resurrection is complete,” she said, her voice now containing multitudes, as if a choir spoke through her. “I have returned as He promised. I am made new.”

I knelt in worship, not to her but to the God who worked this miracle through her. “Praise God,” I choked. “Praise Christ who conquered death. Praise the Holy Spirit who guided me. This is Your work, Lord. This is Your glory.”

Viola, or what she had become, extended a hand that seemed to pass through solid matter as through air. “Rise, father. You must witness what I am now. You must tell the world what God can do. You must be my apostle.”

I rose trembling, barely able to stand. “I will. I will tell everyone. I will show them the codex, explain the process. Resurrection is possible. Death is not the end. Oh God, God, this changes everything—”

“Yes,” she said, her smile impossibly radiant. “Everything is changed. I am the firstfruits, as He was the firstfruits. Others will follow. Death itself will be conquered. The kingdom is coming, father. The kingdom is at hand.”

I write these words not for an academic paper but as testimony, witnessing what God has done in these last days. I write this in hope that those grieving, who have lost loved ones, may understand. Death is not the end; through faith and the proper application of divinely revealed methods, resurrection is not merely promised for a distant eschaton but available now, in our time.

She is with me always now. She no longer remains in one location but appears wherever I am, whenever I need her. Sometimes she manifests as she was in life—my daughter, my flesh and blood—but more often in her glorified form, radiating resurrection light, speaking truths I scarcely understand yet know to be divine.

She has explained what happened to her in death. She was not annihilated, not unconscious. She existed in what she calls the “waiting place,” a realm where souls are prepared for resurrection. There she was taught—by angels, saints, even Christ himself. 

She learned the nature of reality, the structure of creation, the mechanics of resurrection. When my vigils opened the way, when my blood sacrifice completed the offering, she was able to return—not to her old life but to a new one, transformed.

“This is what Christ accomplished on the cross,” she tells me, “not merely forgiveness of sins but true victory over death. Not only for final judgment but for now. The power is here, father. The way is open. You must help others understand.”

I have tried to explain this to people. My university colleagues either ignore my emails or suggest extended leave. When I tried to tell friends of the transformation wrought by the *Codex Resurrectorum*, they stopped taking my calls. Catherine has filed for divorce and obtained a restraining order, claiming I am a danger to myself and others, so I must write this here.
