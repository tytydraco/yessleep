I’m used to the isolation of my work as a mycologist, thriving in nature’s solitude far from city life. So when I got the chance to spend a week in Green Ridge State Forest collecting fungal samples, I eagerly accepted the chance to spend a week of peaceful study in one of the East Coast’s most pristine forests.

The first day was routine. I spent hours trekking through the woods, collecting specimens and noting details. By evening, I returned to my camper in a secluded clearing and began examining my samples under the microscope.

An odd smell soon filled the camper. At first faint, it grew stronger, evoking memories of my childhood—the metallic scent of blood sausage being made during hunting season. The smell was out of place and unsettling. I tried to dismiss it, thinking it might be animal decay, but it lingered, gnawing at my senses.

Later, I heard a strange sound outside—a distant whooping followed by rapid chittering, like an animal communicating in the dark. Though unsettling, I assumed it was nocturnal creatures. I was in their territory, after all.

The next morning, I stepped outside my camper, hoping the new day would bring some relief. The sky was overcast, hinting at an approaching storm. As I looked up, a droplet of something cold splashed onto my head. Rain already? But the storm still looked too far away for rain? 

I touched the top of my head and looked at my fingers—blood. I glanced up to see a mangled fox hanging from a low branch directly above the camper. Its disemboweled body dripped fresh blood onto me. A surge of nausea and fear gripped me. ationalizing it as the work of a bird of prey, I buried the fox’s remains far from my campsite and tried to push the growing unease from my mind.

That night, the forest seemed to close in. The noises grew louder—whooping and chittering surrounding me, and low, guttural murmurs that sounded malevolent.

By the third night, my nerves were frayed. Concentration was impossible; the oppressive atmosphere made me feel watched, as if something lurked just beyond my flashlight’s reach.

Around 2 a.m., I was jolted awake by high-pitched cackling, echoing like a demented predator’s laughter. This was followed by violent banging on the camper door, as if something—or someone—was trying to break in. My heart raced, paralyzed with fear. The cackling grew louder and more frenzied, the banging more forceful.

For what felt like an eternity, the assault continued. The camper shook with each blow, and I lay frozen, too terrified to move. Then, as suddenly as it started, the noise stopped, leaving a suffocating silence broken only by my ragged breathing.

Trembling, I pulled back the privacy curtain just enough to peek outside. At first, I saw only darkness, but then a pair of glowing orange eyes appeared from below, staring directly at me. The eyes were animalistic but held a very human, terrifying intelligence.

Panic surged. I scrambled out of bed, stifling a scream as I dashed to the cab of the camper. My hands shook as I fumbled with the keys, finally starting the engine. With a roar of the engine, the camper lurched forward, tires skidding on the dirt as I sped away.

As I tore down the forest road, my equipment and samples were thrown to the floor in chaotic disarray. I didn’t care—all I wanted was to escape the forest.

Behind me, the cackling and chittering faded, but the malevolent laughter and screeching haunted me as I drove through the night. By dawn, I exhaled, gripping the steering wheel tightly. “Fuck these mushrooms,” I muttered. As I left Green Ridge behind, I knew it was time to consider a new line of work—one that didn’t involve remote forests or the dark things that might be hidden within them.
