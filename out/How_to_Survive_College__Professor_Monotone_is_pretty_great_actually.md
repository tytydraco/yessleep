Professor Monotone is now my favorite professor.  As a person.  Not my favorite lecturer though.  Definitely not my favorite lecturer.

I’ve been making it a habit to drop by his office hours after class.  I feel a little bad because that means my escort needs to wait for me, but it’s Josh that has that time slot and Josh is the nicest person alive.  Either that or he feels indebted to us for helping save him and his mousie buddy from the Millions.  Could be both!

Probably both.

Anyway, Professor Monotone is now fully up-to-date on everything I know.  I’d been hesitant to talk to him about some things as I didn’t know how he felt about the administration.  There was a way to find out his allegiances, though.  I talked it through with Cassie before going ahead with it.  We rehearsed what I was going to say.  I’m finding that’s helping a lot in giving me the confidence to have difficult conversations.  It feels stupid, practicing *talking* to people, but Cassie keeps reminding me that if it works, it works, and I shouldn’t pass up on something that’s helpful just because I feel I should be a certain way.

First, I told Professor Monotone that the flickering man was gone.  Did he remember what happened to the folklore professor?  And potentially others that I didn’t know about?  That creature that was ensuring the professors didn’t talk about *anything* was gone.

“Are you certain?” he asked.  “*Very* certain?”

He always seemed a bit distracted to me, as if teaching wasn’t all that interesting and he was using the majority of his brain for something unrelated.  Right now, however, his entire demeanor had shifted.  He was focused intently on what I was saying.

I stared at a point over his shoulder and tried not to think about what I did.

“Yeah,” I said, “I’m very certain.  I saw him… die.”

Professor Monotone leaned back in his chair.

“Well,” he said quietly, “guess I can be a lot more blunt with certain folks around here.”

I… have a suspicion he’s talking about the other professor in the geology department, the one that was having a nervous breakdown because I stole his heart-shaped piece of petrified wood and was suddenly able to see the stabbed student.  Which reminded me.

“Have you seen James recently?” I asked.  “I think something bad happened to him.”

“What, something worse than being trapped for eternity in the geology building, stabbed all over with various objects?  But no, I haven’t seen him.  I was hoping maybe he’d finally passed on.”

That’d be a comforting thought.  The university president dove into the traveling river to finally die, after all.  Maybe tossing James into the pool of water in the power plant basement had a similar effect.  However, I’m a little alarmed at how many of the creatures on campus I’ve had a hand in removing.  This feels abnormal.  Between this and the whole ‘drinking the water in the power plant basement’ thing, I’m starting to wonder if I’m not as in control of myself as I think I am.

But this wasn’t the reason I was here to talk to Professor Monotone.  I was here to tell him that Grayson - the president’s son - was James.

“Well that explains a lot,” he said, far calmer than I expected.  “I thought I was seeing things.  Or maybe going senile.”

Shortly after James vanished, he said, he thought he saw a new student that looked exactly like James.  He didn’t try to call out to him, because by then all trace of James had vanished.  None of the other professors remembered him, his name wasn’t in the student registry, and the dean had gently suggested that some things weren’t worth following up on.  

“When I saw you sneaking into the power station I half expected to never see you again as *you*,” Professor Monotone said.  “I was afraid I’d have another James situation.”

“I’m kind of worried about that too,” I said miserably.  “So I guess you’re… not a fan of the administration?”

“What, the board?  And the president?  Since I guess we can talk more freely now - hell no.  The board is content to shove their heads in the sand so long as the university keeps being profitable and the president - well - I’m not actually sure what the president wants, but he gives me the creeps.”

“He’s dead.  I mean, he’s dead as in he’s like… a zombie… but also he’s dead-dead now.  I saw it happen.”

I was deviating from the script, but that was okay, because the real test was to tell him about James and see how he reacted.  If he got angry, if he blamed the administration, or if he tried to shut me up and not talk about it.  I’d never have tried this if the flickering man was still around.  

Since I now had nothing to fear (hahah jk I’m always anxious) I went ahead and told him *everything*.  Legit everything.  It was like I couldn’t stop myself after I got started.  I even told him about my bargain with the devil, though I admit I left out the parts where the devil was content to help me cheat my way through exams.  I presented it more as he’s my tutor.  A tutor that can stop time to create the world’s worst all-nighter.  Professor Monotone remained calm the entire time I talked, his only reaction being a raised eyebrow every now and then.

“Huh,” he said when I was finally finished.  “You’re in *deep* with this stuff.”

“I think it’s because of my hometown.  There’s a lot of inhuman creatures roaming around there and people don’t try to hide it.  Also… something killed my dad.”

He was quiet for a moment.  Then, very softly, he said that he was sorry and that must be very hard for me.  I began to tell him the usual excuses I give people so they don’t feel uncomfortable, that it was fine, it happened a long time ago, but for some reason they stuck in my throat.

“Yeah,” I said instead.  “It is hard.  I miss him.  He’s - he’s not going to see me graduate, you know?  He’d have been so proud and I just -”

I took a deep breath.  I wasn’t here to talk about my dad.  I was here to talk about the monsters on campus, but it was too late, I was crying, and Professor Monotone just pushed the tissues closer to my elbow and waited for me to calm down.  I’m getting the feeling this happens a lot in his office.  He might be a terrible lecturer, but he’s got this super calm demeanor that makes you feel like he’s not going to freak out if you tell him your problems.

“So what do you need my help with?” he asked, once I’d stopped crying and declared I was okay.

For now, at least.  I’ll be okay for now.

“I really hate being escorted everywhere,” I said.  “My friends are trying to seal up the pool in the basement, but I kind of want to figure out what *I* can do to fix… myself.”

“Have you been carrying that piece of petrified wood around?” he asked.

“Yeah, it’s in my backpack.  I don’t think it’s working anymore.”

“You said it harmed the inhuman things, right?  Well, you’re human.  It might keep them away from you, but it’s not going to do anything to keep you away from them.”

“So it’s useless.”

He gave me a thin smile.

“Not quite.  I think we need to find out more about that tree in the graveyard.  Between that petrified wood and the tree roots, it’s looking like the tree is actively hostile towards inhuman things.  That could be very useful.”

“We asked the Folklore Society to find out more about the groundskeeper but they haven’t found anything.”

“That’s assuming the groundskeeper was ever human.”

That gave me pause.  I guess I’d made that assumption because we did have things on campus that used to be human, and it seemed to me that the logical progression was someone planted the tree and then became its keeper.  But what if it was the other way around?  And this was a case of the inhuman imitating humanity?

Also, Professor Monotone pointed out, it wasn’t like the university would keep records of who was employed at the graveyard from a hundred years ago or something.  Technically, the city owned it, and he was deeply skeptical that the city would retain employment records that far back.  We might not be able to find out if the groundskeeper was ever human.  Some things we just never figured out, he said, and that was one of the hard lessons I’d have to learn both as an adult and as someone majoring in the sciences.

“Let’s focus on the tree instead,” he said.  “I kind of want to know if it’s actually a prehistoric tree or if it’s something more current.  We really need another fossil to know for sure.  A leaf or pollen sample.  How do you feel about sneaking into the graveyard with your rock hammer?”

Yes I have a rock hammer.  *Of course* I have a rock hammer by this point.  

“Honestly, not great,” I replied.  “I hate the idea of going back in there.  But even if we don’t identify the tree, having a few more pieces of it to protect my friends with sounds really appealing.”

“You’re up for it, then?”

“Yes,” I replied miserably.

“Great!  When are you done with classes for the day?  I have one more lecture at three and then I’m done.”

“You’re not… going to come with me, right?” I ventured.

“Of course not.  I’ve got retirement to look forward to in another ten years and I want to live to enjoy it.  Also, you need to be able to run away without worrying about me.”

Cool.  Great.  Sensible.  I was deeply relieved.  Professor Monotone did want to come, but he would stay at the gate and ensure it didn’t lock on me so that I had a quick exit.  Which is a decent plan.  And since we wouldn’t go until later, I could talk it through with Cassie and Maria first.

I was almost out the door when a thought occurred to me.  I paused and asked Professor Monotone how we were going to get into the graveyard, since it was locked except for Sundays.

“I can lockpick,” he replied calmly.  “Thought it would be neat to learn a while back.  Also comes in handy when I lock myself out of my office by accident.”

College is wild, y’all.

I shared the plan with Josh on the way back to my apartment.  He had one modification to the plan.  He volunteered to come as a lookout.  That way, I could focus on finding the rocks we needed and not have to watch over my shoulder the whole time.  I had to admit that wasn’t a bad idea.  We couldn’t send someone else, someone more athletic like Grayson had done with the thing in the hallway.  I needed to go because I knew what to look for.  We weren’t just looking for fossils laying out on the ground, after all.  I was looking for the imprint of a leaf or pollen and something like that wasn’t going to be an obvious find.  I’d be looking more for the *type* of rock than a visible fossil.  I’d grab them, shove them in a backpack, and tote them out to split open with Professor Monotone’s help.

Cassie wasn’t home, so Josh stayed until it was time to meet up with Professor Monotone.  We both emptied our backpacks and I put my rock hammer in mine.  That was all we’d carry.  Then we headed for the graveyard.  Josh didn’t seem nervous at all, which I found astonishing considering how explicit I’d been with the the danger we’d be putting ourselves in.  

“I’m surprised you’re okay with me trespassing,” I said as we approached Professor Monotone, who was waiting at the graveyard entrance.  “You were concerned about me being expelled earlier.”

“Nah, if you get caught I’ll just tell them I asked you to go get a sample of the ignafrackenmule rock in the corner of the graveyard.  I’ve got tenure, it’ll be fine.”

There is no such thing as an ignafrackenmule, for the record.  Professor Monotone was willing to break into the graveyard and then lie to cover for us.  Amazing.

Professor Monotone had already picked the lock and while it would have been hilarious to see my extremely boring professor breaking into the graveyard, I was kind of glad I wasn’t there for that part.  It would have made me exceedingly anxious.  Probably more anxious than actually going into the graveyard where the groundskeeper would be stalking about, even.

I don’t understand my brain.

We didn’t waste any time heading for the center of the graveyard where the petrified tree towered above all the headstones.  Josh kept a close watch on our surroundings as we proceeded.  It usually took a little while for the groundskeeper to find us, I reminded myself.  We had a bit of time.  We just needed to be alert and Josh had that covered.

The roots grew thicker as we approached the tree.  I haven’t actually seen the tree up close and sadly, today was no exception.  The roots began to break through the ground as we approached, thick cables of stone erupting from the earth.  They swallowed up the headstones, forming irregular mounds where they trailed over the top and down the sides of the tombstones.  I scanned the dirt between the roots, searching for any exposed stone that looked promising.  If we went much further, the ground would be entirely composed of roots and I wasn’t confident we’d find what we were looking for at that point.

“There,” I said, pointing.  “I’m going to go break that apart.”

It was an area where the ground had collapsed around the roots, forming a depression.  On one side of the depression, nearly covered by the tree, was a layer of rock.  Shale.  Perfect.  I told Josh to watch for the groundskeeper while I hacked pieces off.

I’ve only done a little bit of digging for fossils.  This really isn’t something I’m super interested in.  I kind of prefer stuff like erosion and rivers, maybe it’s from coming from a farming community.  So I kind of made a mess of things, but that could have also been the anxiety.  The shale split easily enough, at least, and after a few minutes of chipping pieces off I found what I was looking for.  An imprint.  Granted, I’d also managed to crack it into three pieces, but I figured Professor Monotone could help me put it back together.  I shoveled it into my backpack and then resumed digging for another specimen.

“Hey,” Josh said, “don’t panic, I don’t see the groundskeeper yet.  But I do see something weird.”

I got off my knees and went over to look at what he was pointing at.  There was a mound not far from where we were.  A big mound, formed of overlapping layers of roots.

“Maybe I’m being paranoid,” Josh said, “but I feel like that’s about the size of a human.”

It was.  I stared at it a long moment, heart pounding, wondering if perhaps I should just ignore it and focus on the shale in front of me.  But I was confident that I had at least one good leaf and something about that mound called to me.  It felt… suspicious.

“I want to see what’s inside,” I said.

Josh, surprisingly, agreed.  We carefully made our way over, stepping on and over the roots that littered the ground.  It really was as big as a person, once we reached it, assuming the person was sitting down.  I pried at the exterior roots and they reluctantly gave way, cracking like stone, but only the exterior layer flaked off into small fragments that fell on my feet.  The rest of the root moved like a living plant and I shoved it aside and dug at the next layer.

“I don’t think the tree likes what you’re doing,” Josh said nervously.

The roots around us were beginning to move.  Only the small ones, slithering along the ground towards my feet and I felt cold, stony tendrils brush against my ankles.  I kicked at them, keeping my focus on the roots covering up whatever was inside the bulbous growth.  There.  I wedged the hammer in, twisted it, and pulled aside enough of the roots to see what was contained within.

There was a face.  A person’s face.  And my heart about stopped in terror, because it was my manager, the one from the food court, who the tree had dragged beneath the earth.

It was holding him here.  The tree had him.

I had to get the roots off.  I had to get him free.  I hooked the end of the rock hammer under one of them, for I was close to his face now, and didn’t dare to keep hacking away at them.  I pulled with frantic, panicked strength.  He wasn’t dead.  *He wasn’t dead* and I was here and I could get him out-

“Ashley,” Josh said nervously.  “We need to go.”

“I’ve almost got him - I have to do this -”

No, you don’t!  And something is coming!”

I pulled.  The root cracked and came loose.  I could see his eyes now, closed gently, and the steady rise and fall of his chest.  All around me the stone creaked like it was living wood, trying to cover up the hole I was digging.  Josh pulled on my arm.

“Seriously,” he snapped, “don’t make me carry you.  *I will*.”

I glanced up and beyond Josh, I saw a large shape prowling towards us.  It walked on all fours, its head slung low between its shoulders, and moss hung off its bark-like skin in thick sheets.

“Oh shit that’s the dog,” I whispered.

“I was trying to tell you we had to go!”

I was torn.  Fear ran cold in my gut but at the same time, I felt a wild desperation, that I’d failed him once already and now I had a chance to redeem myself - except Josh was pulling and the dog was accelerating, I could feel the ground shake beneath the impact of its stone? wood? paws. It leapt from root cluster to root cluster, barely impeded by the broken terrain.  

We weren’t going to be able to outrun it.  Maybe if we could get just a few yards further, where the roots thinned and we’d have a clear shot to the front gate - but I heard the crunch of its body behind us - 

“Sorry,” Josh said.

Then he grabbed the rock hammer out of my hand, turned, and threw it.

My rock hammer.  My precious rock hammer that I’d asked for as a birthday gift.  It spun end over end and slammed into the creature’s face.   

I heard a crack, sharp and bright.  The sound of metal being snapped in two.

RIP rock hammer.  You served me well.

Its sacrifice slowed the dog down long enough for us to get a lead on it.  I ran as fast as I could, barely keeping up with Josh, as the roots receded in front of us and my feet hit cobblestones.  Then we could break into a sprint.  And maybe the dog was behind us or maybe it had decided that chasing us away from the tree was enough, I don’t know, because I didn’t look back.  I just let panicked adrenaline carry me past the gate and then Professor Monotone was slamming it shut behind us and I heard the latch fall into place.

“Let’s go,” the professor said, walking more briskly than I’ve ever seen him move before.  “Back to my office.  Let’s not linger.”

Neither Josh nor I needed to be told twice.  We followed him back to the office, where I dumped my haul out onto his desk and he inspected the broken fossils.  He’d need to get someone from another department involved, he said. If this was a modern tree, it wouldn’t be something he could easily figure out.

“But what about my manager?” I protested.  “What do we do about him?”

“Nothing,” Professor Monotone replied.  “We need to figure out what we’re dealing with first.”

“But-”

He fixed me with a steely glare.

“You asked for my help,” he said.  “I may not have hands-on experience with this bullshit like you do, but I do have more life experience in general.  He’s not dead or dying.  He’s asleep.  This isn’t an emergency.  We figure out what the tree is and what its function is, and maybe then we can get him out.”

Then he shoved a few pieces of rock at me that he said looked like bark and told me to divvy it up among my friends.  So we’ve all got petrified wood to carry around now, that’s a silver lining I guess.

It didn’t take long before I heard from Professor Monotone.  I got an email asking I drop by for office hours.

“I think we’ve figured out what the tree is,” he said as soon as I entered his office.  “It did exist back in the Paleocene, but I think this one is a modern species.  It’s an alder tree.”

I admit I looked up symbolism around the alder tree online afterwards, but I don’t know if I trust the search results.  The websites looked sketchy.  And I don’t have the folklore professor to ask, so I’m just going to consider the symbolism a dead end for now.  However, Professor Monotone had taken a different perspective.

“What’s most interesting to me,” Professor Monotone continued, “is that the alder wood holds up remarkably well to water.  And what is the biggest problem on this [campus](https://alderrayne.com/)?”
