When I was little probably 5 or 6 I would have these nightmares of being in the woods late at night and even though the full moon shone brightly above you could barely see your own hands. I would hear people calling my name people I knew like my dad mom sister brother aunts and uncles but at the same time something was off. They sounded like m family but…

I told my mother about theses dreams and she would shrug it off. We lived in the city and I had never been been near any woods because most of my family lived in the city. Years passed and the dream subsided and I eventually forgot about them completely and when I was 19 I took a trip  with my childhood best friends Alex and Macie and Lexa. This was a girls trip but Alex could not leave Scott so the 100 pound Husky that was afraid of his own shadow came to. When we arrived at the cabin in the woods we unpacked and chose our bunks. 

The first 3 nights of our 7 day vacation was great. We hiked the mountains zip lined through the mountains and went swimming in a creek near our cabins. The locals were welcoming but strange and never talked much. On the 4th night was when we made our biggest mistake. Scott had to pee at like 10 pm and we were all sitting around in the living room telling ghost stories and what not. I may wanna add that we took this trip in the fall and it’s that time we’re the leaves are orange and yellow and all pretty and stuff. So Alex takes Scott outside and the pops her head back inside. 


“Why don’t we go for a moon light hike?” She asked and we agreed and put on our sweat shirt and shoes. Scott lead the way as we walked down a path we had been down when we first arrived. It was a 10-15 minute loop that led you to a creek then back to the cabin but it also split off deeper into the woods. Well when we were in deep conversation a bird of some kind flew out of the bushes and Scott bolted and pulled Alex force Ig her to let go of his leash. We all ran after this dog our cheep flash lights in had yelling for this dog. Thankfully Alex has a tracker in this mutt so we followed that and obviously he has chose the longer train we had not been on but he also strayed into the woods. Lexa suggested that we just turned back and look first Scott in the morning because he was an almost solid black husky with only a little white. 

Macie aggreed with this and headed back while I stayed with Alex to search for just 10 more minutes as he has stopped. So we go on and look for him. I hated horror moves as a kid and looking back I would have watched some because this would have been a great plot line. So Alex being so very smart forgets to charge her flashlight and so it goes dead leaving us with just 1 and it had been over 10 minutes but i just could not tell her we needed to turn back this dog was her life but we had to. Just as I was about to tell her we needed to got back she said something and then runs off. 

I chase her but lose sight of her and to make things worse she took my flash light. I go in the direction she was going in and it leads down a steep hill. I began walking down but trip and hit my head on a rock. I closed my eyes for a second and sat up my vision was blurry but I got up anyways. Everything was dark around me and my head was ringing and I swear I could hear something calling me then I remembered my dream. I thought I was going crazy but this was exactly what I dreamed about. I called for my freind but I got no response from them but something was heading towards me. I keeled calling there name no response and everything in my body told me to run but I was frozen to the ground. 

Finally I made my self run and only stopped after I reached a cave and was dieing for breath but my heart stopped when the bushes began to move.Then Scott burst out of the bushes covered in some sticky slimy stuff. I grabbed the dogs Leash tight and tied it to a tree out side of the cave (it was a rock over hangs but it felt like a cave to me) and thought about how Alex must have went back to the Cabin. I took Scott’s leash and lead him in a straight line till I hit a road and flagged down a car and after that it was a blur as the stranger drove me and Scott to town were I saw a doctor who confirmed I had a concussion but other than that was fine. Then the doctor asked what I was doing and told him everything that happened. He looked at me with a straight face and asked “ then why did the dog have blood on his fur?” The sticky stuff I that was all over him was blood and I froze. Scott was brought to me and by now the run was being to come up and I saw Scott’s matted bloody fur. 

Cops arrived at the cabin and reported that no one was there. They sent out a search partyand found what was left of Lexa  and Macie but not Alex. They said it looked like a bear that attacked them but from the few foggy memories I have I can tell you I felt something there that night and it was no bear. I have no clue what happened that night and do not even remember much of what happened all I know is somehow a dream I had as a child may have saved my life.
