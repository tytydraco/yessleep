Hell isn't a place. It exists inside of all of us.

What is the last dream that you remember? How much of it do you remember? Do you remember how it starts? Do you remember how it ends? Do you remember how you die?

My names is James. I'm 33 years old, and live in a quiet suburb with my wife, Alice, and our two kids, Carrie and Caleb. Our lives are fairly uneventful. I work as a bartender at a hotel down the street from a fairly busy plaza. Alice works as a part-time accountant for a large company, and a full time mom with the twins. I grew up as the only child of a single mother in the middle of nowhere special. I was an okay student, and never really caused trouble, if I could avoid it. My mom passed away from cancer about a year after I left home to join the work force. I always had a dream to open a restaurant of my own. Things never quite worked out that way, but I make decent money where I'm at, and I'm perfectly content with my peaceful, if not bland, life. The reason I'm beginning my story with a borderline cliche establishment of my background is because I truly don't know what I could have done to have possibly deserved this. I'm not even entirely sure if anything actually happened, or if it's just a cruel trick being played on me by my own mind. I don't have any real history of mental illness in my family, and I have no idea how to even begin to explain this to a medical professional. I think I just need to get my thoughts out. I need a vent, and God help me, the internet might be my only outlet.

I've been having the same recurring dream for some time. Well, it's less that it's the same dream. I guess it's more like it's several dreams that all take place in the same area. At least, I think it's the same area. It's difficult to explain, so I think it's best to start from the beginning. I will try to recall the events as they occurred to the best of my ability. If anyone has any idea as to what is going on, please reach out to me. I'm almost at my wit's end.

I wake up in an elevator. I don't recall how I came to be here. I don't even remember the drive here. The flickering lights inside are dim, but I can piece together my environment. The elevator looks about as you'd expect, save for a few details. The electronic screen that denotes which floor we're headed to is glitching. The numbers on the panel are all scratched off and the lights aren't working. There's no way to tell which floor I came from, nor which floor I'm currently headed to, aside from the fact that I can tell that the elevator is moving upward. There is no music, just the rumbling and creaking of the elevator as it makes its way to whichever floor it plans to dump me. The walls are currently covered by a thick, blue tarp held together by worn down duct tape. It's almost as if the building is still under construction, but I don't believe that to be the case. After some time, I can feel my ascent begin to slow until I come to sudden stop. An electronic voice glitches as it attempts to announce which floor I've arrived out. I couldn't quite work it out, but it sounded like it said the thirtieth floor. An insufferable screech pierces the thick, humid air as the doors slowly creep open. As the doors open, I'm nearly blinded by overly bright and pale fluorescent lights. As my eyes adjust, I feel a strange sense of melancholy wash over me.

I step out of the elevator and begin to observe my surroundings. It appears to be a relatively simple office setting. I can see several small offices lining the walls, with several dozen cubicles in the center of a large, open area. I can hear the sound of clocks ticking, typing, footsteps, phones ringing, and printers printing surrounding me, but there's nobody in this room but me. On the screen of one of the computers inside a cubicle, is a sticky not with "XXX" scribbled on it in red ink. Off in the distance, I can hear what sounds like people talking in the distance, but it's too far away to make out what they're saying. All I can say is that there is a lot of them. I begin walk toward the end of the room. I notice a clock on the wall, and decide to check the time. The displayed time is 12:18, and I can hear the quiet ticking, but the hands aren't moving. I survey the room once again before looking back the clock for a moment. The displayed time is now 12:19.

I make my way to the hallway entrance in order to take a look around and get a better idea of where I might be. I couldn't believe what I saw. The hallway seemed nearly endless, and stretched toward the horizon that, somehow, was noticeable inside of this building. Along each wall was a nearly limitless supply of doors and corners that turn into what was most likely more cubicle areas. Off in the very far distance, I could see what looked to be the outlines of people, but they were too far away to make out any specific details. At best, they looked like oily shadows that would quickly disappear out of sight whenever I tried to approach them. Beyond the strange office-themed ambience, there was no other sound aside from the soft crunch of my shoes upon the crappy office carpet and my heavy, nervous breathing. Adorning the hallway walls are several painted portraits of people whom I'm certain I've never met before. They say that your mind can't invent human faces, only things that resemble human faces. I guess that must mean. logically, that I've at least seen these people before, but somehow, I don't think that's the case this time.

Before I begin to make my journey into the ominous hallway, I take one last look at the cubicle section I currently find myself in. I head into the hallway and begin looking around. One thing that becomes immediately noticeable is the view from the hallway windows. There is a fair amount of sunlight coming in from the windows despite the sky being completely overcast. I appear to be on the ground floor, and through the window, a vast parking lot can be observed without a single car in sight. Off in the distance, I can see a thick tree line with a fair amount of fog flowing between the trees, almost like the lot connects to a deep forest. Something about this image might be somewhat comforting to someone slaving away in this office for eight hours a day, but for some reason, it only filled me with anxiety. Something about that tree line wasn't right. I simultaneously had the feeling that something was out there, waiting for me, and that there was nothing there at all. Almost like those trees could extend to the end of the Earth itself, and that I was truly stranded here. After staring out the window for a few minutes, I shake off my feeling of unease and press on.

As I approached the next section of the office, the shadow people didn't simply vanish into thin air. Instead, they all walked around the corner, out of sight, and when I turned the corner, they were all gone. It was almost as if they had all gone into different rooms, but the nearby offices had large see-through windows and it was obvious that nobody was inside. I take a quick peek into both restrooms as if to convince myself that I didn't already know what I knew. The restrooms were empty. Puzzled, I lean up against one of the walls next to the men's room and begin gathering my thoughts. Whatever this place is, I was currently trapped here. There was nobody here except for me, at least that I could tell. I took a quick peek at the clock on the wall. Once again, the hands weren't moving, but it was still ticking. The time was now 12:27. Whether it was AM or PM didn't seem to matter. Surely, the logical expectation would be that the time was just past noon, but I quickly decided to myself that logic was in short supply in this place. The uneasy feeling I had when looking out the window told me that I couldn't really trust the environment outside as I came to realize one detail that I hadn't considered before. Outside the window, I appeared to be on the ground floor, but the elevator sounded like it said that I was on the thirtieth floor. Even if that's not the case, the elevator was very clearly ascending from somewhere before I was dropped off here. I didn't want to think about where exactly I came from.

Scraping whatever resolve I had left to continue on my journey, I begin to explore this new cubicle area. I very quickly gave up on this idea, however. After only a couple of minutes, I already figured out what I needed to know about this area. It didn't take long for me to realize that this area was exactly the same as the on I was just in. The cubicle layout was exactly the same, the portraits on the wall were exactly the same, and the offices were exactly the same as well. Every little detail that I could remember from the previous area was exactly the same in this new one. I remember that one of the crappy computers in one of the cubicles had three sticky notes on the screen. They didn't say anything, which struck me as odd at first, but the same cubicle in this new area also had three sticky notes in the exact same layout. I'm beginning to question what I should and should not consider odd in this place. I walk over to the hallway entrance again, to head back the way I came, but quickly stopped. The hallway where I just came from is gone. Despite the fact that the entrance to this office section just disappeared into thin air, I didn't panic. In a weird way, it made sense to me. Afterall, if this area was completely identical to the one I was just in, then there wouldn't be a hallway on this side of the room. It was just another wall with a portrait of what I assumed was the building I was currently residing in. As weird as that may or may not seem, one thing became abundantly clear immediately. I can not go back, I can only go forward. That is where my first dream ended.

I wake up in my bed, drenched in a cold sweat. The clock on my night stand reads 4:26 AM. I'm not sure what I had just experienced, but somewhere deep down, I knew that it wasn't over. A feeling of dread washes over me as I glance down at my feet. I'm currently wearing shoes in bed. I didn't fall asleep in these shoes. My head starts to ache as memories flood in of the dream's events. These are the shoes I was wearing in the dream. What the hell is going on?

Regardless, it's time to wake up the kids for school. I peel myself out of bed before waking up Alice. "Hey hon. I whisper to her. It's time to get up. I'll go get the kids if you wanna start getting ready."

She rolls over and stretches before letting out a yawn. "Good morning, babe. How... Are you wearing shoes?" She asked, rightfully confused.

"Don't worry about it. I'll go start the coffee."

"Mmmm. Hey, don't forget. I need your help dropping off cookies for the potluck at the office this morning."

"Don't worry," I said playfully. "I didn't forget. Now, out of bed, lazy butt."

After spending thirty seconds deciding whether or not to take my shoes off before slipping on my jeans, I go to wake up the kids. "Up and at 'em kiddos. Time is money, and you're both going broke."

The siblings both in unison sit up in their beds before proceeding to throw whatever they could get their hands on at me. "Nice try, losers," I yell at them as I walk to the bathroom. "Maybe your PE teacher can teach you how to aim!"

"SHUT UP, DAD!" I hear Carrie and Caleb shout, again in unison. They really are twins. Another twenty minutes pass by as I help my wife and kids get their things together before loading them into the van. Trying to shake off any fatigue left in my system, we quickly depart for the day's activities. After dropping off the twins, I must have still been half asleep because in my periphery, I could have sworn that saw some of those same shadows among the thirty or so kids waiting to enter their school. That can't possibly be, right?

"What is it?" Alice asked, seeing the expression on my face. "You look pale, hon."

"Nothing, don't worry about it," I said, not realizing how cold I sounded just now. "Sorry. I didn't sleep well at all last night."

"Yeah, I noticed are you okay?"

"I will be, babe. Thanks."

We arrive at Alice's office building. Parked on the third level of the parking garage at her designated tenth spot, I grab an enormous basket filled to the brim with cookies that she had spent all day yesterday baking for her co-workers. We shuffle our way to the elevator and she presses the button for her office floor.

"Why don't I get any of these?" I ask in the saddest and most pathetic way I could muster.

"Did you think I didn't notice you sneaking several of them away yesterday? You aren't as slick as you think you are."

"Ouch," I said, slightly offended.

"Besides, you can have any that are left over, I promise."

The elevator whirs its way to our destination. I notice some of the blue tarp and duct tape on the walls, and I start hearing my heartbeat in my ears.

"Honey, are you okay?" Alice's concern was noticeable in her expression.

"Thirtieth floor" the female electronic voice announced.

"James, you don't look so good. Are you sure you're doing okay?"

"Yeah. I'm okay. Thanks, babe."

"Okay. I know this is your first time here, and I was hoping to introduce you to some friends, but I think you should go home as soon as possible."

She was wrong. I don't know how I knew for certain, but I know for a fact that I've been here before. As the elevator doors creep open, I find myself now standing in the exact same office that I had just dreamed about. The only difference is that now there were actual people here. I quickly dropped off the cookies, kissed Alice goodbye, and went back home. 

I feel like I've barely slept at all, and my feet hurt as though I'd been running a marathon. I'm not in the best shape in the world, but I'm hardly frail. Yesterday was a day off, and I spent it mostly lazing around. The dull pain in my legs wouldn't make sense unless I'd been walking around in circles for hours. The thought upsets me. As I arrive at home, I make myself another cup of coffee and sit down on the couch. Ideally, I'd probably lay back down for a nap, but I don't want to fall back asleep right now. It was a bizarre experience, and one I'm not looking forward to experiencing it again, if it does happen again. The more I think about it, the more I think that it was less like a dream, and more like I was taken somewhere. None of this makes any sense.
