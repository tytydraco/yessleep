Now, years later, I sit here writing this, hoping it will exorcise the lingering dread. But as I finish, I hear it—a soft giggle, carried on the winter wind. The snow is falling again, and I swear, out by the stable, I see a figure in a crimson bonnet waving at me.

It was the winter of 1987, a season when snow fell so heavily it muffled the world, making everything feel soft and secret. I was but eight years old, a child of quiet inclinations, content to let the days pass in solitude. Our modest home stood on the outskirts of town, its backyard stretching into a field blanketed in white and bordered by an old, sagging stable. The stable had stood long before we arrived, its wooden beams weathered and silvered with age.

One frosty afternoon, as I trudged through the snow, I heard the faintest sound—laughter. High, lilting, and sweet, it seemed to weave through the crisp air like a melody meant only for me. Turning, I saw her for the first time.

She stood near the stable, her dark curls escaping from beneath a crimson bonnet, her cheeks flushed pink from the cold. She wore a simple woolen coat, the kind you’d expect to find in a trunk in the attic, and her eyes held a curious sparkle. She waved, and without hesitation, I waved back.

Her name, she said, was Clara. She spoke softly, with a peculiar lilt I couldn’t place. Clara claimed her family lived nearby, though she never said precisely where. I didn’t pry; it wasn’t my nature. We spent hours together that day, laughing and building snowmen, our voices echoing in the stillness of the winter landscape.

Days turned into weeks, and Clara became my constant companion. We’d meet by the stable every morning and play until the sun dipped low and the shadows grew long. She seemed to know so much—how to weave wreaths from brittle twigs, how to spot the faintest tracks of a fox in the snow. Yet she never mentioned school or siblings, and when I asked about her home, she only smiled, enigmatic and serene.

One evening, over supper, I told my mother about Clara. Her fork paused mid-air, and she frowned.

“Clara?” she repeated, as if tasting the name. “Where does she live?”

“Just nearby,” I said, my voice bright. “We play in the stable. She’s wonderful, Mama. You’d like her.”

My mother didn’t answer. Her eyes lingered on me for a moment longer, then she continued eating.

The next day, Clara wasn’t there. I called her name into the cold, empty air, my voice swallowed by the snow. She never returned.

My parents dismissed her absence as the natural ebb and flow of childhood friendships. “Maybe her family moved,” my father said. But I couldn’t let her go. I searched the stable, the fields, even the woods beyond, but there was no trace of her—no footprints, no laughter, nothing. Clara had vanished as if she’d never existed.

Weeks became months, and eventually, years passed. Clara became a distant memory, a bittersweet ache in my heart.

Eleven years later, in the spring of 1998, my mother decided it was time to clear out the attic. “We’ll donate the toys,” she said, “to children who need them.”

I wasn’t home that day, but when I returned, I found her sitting in the living room, pale and trembling. In her lap was a doll—a strange, old-fashioned thing with glassy eyes and a painted smile.

“I found this among your toys,” she whispered. “Do you remember it?”

I didn’t. The doll was exquisite, dressed in a miniature woolen coat and a crimson bonnet. My stomach churned. It was Clara—every detail was exact.

My mother looked at me, her voice trembling. “This doll… it wasn’t here before.”

That night, I dreamt of the stable. The air was thick and cold, and the snow shimmered unnaturally under the moonlight. In the dream, I saw Clara again, standing by the stable door. She didn’t smile this time. Instead, she pointed toward the shadows inside, her eyes glassy and unblinking.

When I awoke, I was drenched in sweat, the doll sitting upright on my dresser, though I’d left it downstairs.

Something compelled me to return to the stable the following day. The years had not been kind to it; the roof sagged further, and the wood smelled of rot. As I stepped inside, I felt it immediately—a wrongness, a pressure in the air.

In the corner, half-buried under years of hay and debris, was a trapdoor. My heart thundered as I pulled it open, revealing a narrow staircase spiraling into darkness.

At the bottom, the air was thick and damp. The space smelled of earth and something faintly sweet, like rotting fruit. And then I saw them: translucent, egg-like pods glowing faintly in the dark. Inside each one floated a child, their faces eerily serene.

My knees buckled as I stumbled forward. In one pod, I saw her—Clara. But it wasn’t just Clara. It was me.

Her face, my face, turned slowly toward me, and her eyes opened. They weren’t Clara’s eyes or mine. They were the doll’s—glasslike and void of life.

I don’t remember running home, but when I arrived, the doll was gone. My mother never spoke of it again, and I buried the memory deep, pretending it was a dream.
