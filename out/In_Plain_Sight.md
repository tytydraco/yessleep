Before leaving home, I saw my local news channel showing the City State Police Chief standing on a podium:



“Good morning, everybody. The information I am about to give you is preliminary, as our investigation is still ongoing. I’m going to discuss the abhorrent psychological torment reportedly causing severe anxiety and emotional distress in a public setting. The incidents occurred in our good City on the 4th, 7th, 10th, 14th, 16th, and today, the 18th. I will not be releasing the victim’s names at this moment. Each incident appears random, and the perpetrators reportedly have no memory of their actions, even when provided with audio and visual confirmation. We advise everyone to stay indoors and to avoid crowds of people. There have been no reported casualties at this time, although there have been reports of physical coercion. We are working closely with local authorities to address this issue and to ensure public safety. Thank you.”



An invisible being had attached itself over my shoulders, happily attracting the unwanted attention of others. It twisted their emotions to that of malice and coerced them to hate in its direction. With a front-row seat to enjoy my torment.



Weirded out by the announcement, I left to get my morning coffee. I noticed everyone in the coffee shop stopped talking and gazed in my direction, uncomfortably quiet.



The barista didn’t acknowledge it either, so I awkwardly asked for my drink, and everyone stayed quiet as I waited to grab my coffee. He and everyone else stared at me as I hurriedly left the building.



I strolled into the subway, heading to work. The people there were also staring. I sat across from a man who would not look away. I tried not to pay attention, but it didn’t feel right. His leering was unwavering. I shifted in my seat, asked him to please stop, and told him that it made me uncomfortable.



He stood up.



I didn’t know what to do, so I moved next to a few people a few seats away. His head followed me. He walked over and stood above me, staring down.



He smiled a little too wide. The smell of his astringent cologne invaded my nostrils. The couple stopped talking and sat on either side of me, linking arms behind my back.



I squirmed out of the way as they laughed. My heart was beating fast as I scrambled to the next car.



 I rubbed my head, trying to find a new seat.



The first person I sat across from said, “I saw you run away.” as he giggled a soft laugh. “That was pretty funny. You’re such a fucking pussy, aren’t ya?” He got up and blocked the doorway.



I started hyperventilating as the other guy was staring through the window.



A woman sitting next to him sneered, “Look at you with your damn tight jeans and messy hair. Why’d you even get out of bed?”



She showed off her cleavage. “You like staring, you goddamned pervert. What the hell is wrong with you?”



The entire car erupted in laughter, pointing in my direction.



All of them got up and surrounded me. I fled the end of the car. They chanted:



“Asshole!”



“Pervert!”



“Take his clothes off!”



They pushed me to each other.



“Sick freak!”



“Loner!”



All crowding around me, standing in my way.



“What a little bitch!”



“Look at him; he’s just cowering on the floor.”



“What a fucking cunt!”



I covered my ears and curled in the fetal position, waiting for it to be over, tears running down my face.



They stood there laughing over my body for what felt like hours.



We finally reached my stop, and everyone just sat down like nothing had happened.



They just talked amongst themselves like normal.



I stumbled in a daze toward my work, unable to process what happened. I intended to tell my boss I was taking the day off, not even thinking about calling the police.



When I got to the office, my boss of three years asked me to step into the conference room. One of my coworkers, whom I had known for nearly a decade, locked the door behind me.

“Hello, Maurice.” My boss smiled. “We’re having a little party for you.”



My coworker handed me a bottle.



It was full of vodka.



Everyone there chanted.



“Drink! Drink! Drink!”



Holding me down, they forced the bottle into my mouth.



“This is for your own good!”



“You need to fucking lighten up!”



“You’re such a damn suck-up.”



They lifted me up and paraded me around the room.



“I’ve always hated you.”



“Your little brown nose had it coming.”



“Why do you even work here!”



They tied me to a chair and wheeled me through the office, forcing alcohol down my throat.



I screamed and struggled to get away. They gagged me with a vodka-soaked rag.



They reinforced the tiedown with duct tape.



I cried as my boss ripped my pants down and shoved another alcohol-soaked rag up my body. He taped a resignation letter to my chest, and everyone wheeled me to the curb, cheering.



I vomited all over myself and blacked out.



I woke up, still strapped to the chair, with people walking past me like I wasn’t even there.
