It was the summer of ‘06 and we had gone to Rick’s house by Claytor Lake. The old place wasn’t the flashiest, but it was nearby the water, and in the summer, a podunk lake-beach was enough to get a bunch of kids like us ready for anything.

I was still a junior and Rick was a senior, but his family had money, and his parents were out of town a lot. For what, I don’t know; in retrospect, maybe I didn’t know enough about Rick to begin with. But everyone at school knew it was old money—the kind of money that didn’t take kindly to flashy sports cars or gaudy jewelry. Maybe it was because Rick was still young or maybe it was because he didn’t like the stuffiness he’d been raised with, but he was very much the opposite.

He had this sweet-ass yellow Camero where the blower protruded out of the hood. I never knew much about cars, but you could hear that thing coming from a mile out. Generally, Rick wore oversized sports jerseys and cargo shorts. It was a rarity to see him with anything on his feet besides grungy flip flops. His personality defied his style. He enjoyed showy muscle cars and dressing down, but if you were to get him talking about something that he genuinely cared about, you’d have his attention for hours. Sometimes we’d sit out on his porch in Blacksburg till the sun came up, drinking Millers and talking about life. On those weekends, I’d crash on his couch, and he’d end up falling asleep in the recliner beside me; the TV would go on with infomercials till one of us drunkenly remembered to shut the thing off.

Among groups, Rick was a loudmouth and a braggart, but sometimes, when it was just me and him or sometimes with Jon, he’d become contemplative and inscrutable. It was a metamorphosis, but not an entirely negative one. We’d talk about where we were all headed in life, and Rick would go on about Hunter S. Thompson and about how the whole world was insane. He had a real hard-on for the author and sometimes waxed philosophical about the rigid expectations thrust upon him by his parents.

“It’s never as easy as it is in the movies,” Rick said, before cracking open the plastic on a glass bottle of Jack, “Never. You expect the whole world to open up for you and blossom like a flower. I expect—or I keep expecting that at some point all of this will begin to make sense. We’re growing up boys! Yes, that’s right, Jon, give me your glass and I’ll pour you one. You too Ren.”

At the call of my name, I offered my empty pail for refilling, and Rick obliged enthusiastically. Each of us sat on plastic chairs on the front porch of Rick’s house by Claytor Lake. Though all were dry, each of us was still in our swim trunks with towels draped around our shoulders.

Jon, a bit slower on the uptake, never could discern what Rick was talking about, and honestly, with age, I’m beginning to believe I never really understood either. Jon said, “What’s the point? Let’s drink. You’re bringing the mood down, Rick.”

Sometimes I’d waffle with Rick about what he meant and say things like, “What’s the meaning of life?” or “I think we make our own meaning.” This is where I came in with a point, “The world’s all meaningless, isn’t it?”

Rick rebuked this thread with, “No, Ren, I can’t believe in all that absurdist shit. It’s good for fun. It is! But I think it’s better to just accept that this universe is a madhouse and we’re all in it. It’s like one big game of marbles, right? They teach us that shit in school. Newton discovered the laws of physics. If you expand on that, then we’re all just apples fall from trees.”

“Wait,” said Jon, “I thought we were marbles.”

“Doesn’t matter,” said Rick, “Whether there’s an architect, we’re each predestined. It’s physics. Do I have control over myself? Nah. It’s all coming up.” He nodded drunkenly and took a drink. “It’s all coming up, for sure. I’m a little marble bouncing around in a can. Sure, it seems random, but if I could see how the cans shaking from the outside, I’d have some idea of where I was going next.”

Jon, having enough, cupped his hand to his head and said, “Let’s stop talking about this stuff, it’s late and like I said, you’re bringing the mood down.”

It was late. It was well past midnight. Pivoting round in the plastic chair, I peered out across the narrow front yard where the gravel driveway disappeared around a rightward bend into the trees; trees surrounded the house. Rick’s yellow Camero sat in dark shadows, so it looked like a great black lump in the yard. Moths flickered across the overhead porchlight. Crickets pumped a thousand volts through the trees.

Rick had driven us there for a celebration; it was summer, and he had graduated. He’d be going to Radford. Whenever asked about it, he’d say he wanted a good practical school—not some prestigious place his parents bought him into. It’s funny; he wanted to despair over his parents’ money, and only attend a college he earned, but I never ended up going to any college the following year. I never had the money for it. I don’t mean to say that I was actually jealous of Rick, but there were times when his complaining fell on deaf ears.

Me and Jon (who was also senior) had come out to Claytor and intended to stay the whole weekend, drinking and cheering our friend on. Jon had no plans for college; when prodded, he said he’d probably get his truck license like his dad. I don’t think he had any real plans, not really. But neither did I.

With some mumbles and talk about it getting cold outside, we shuffled into Rick’s house and took up in front of the TV on the couch in the dark living room. The living room sat to the right directly by the entryway. Rick went to the kitchen which was to the left and rummaged around while me and Jon blankly watched The Brak Show at low volume. It was the only thing playing that looked interesting to us.

When Rick rejoined us, he was licking the finishing touches on a fatly rolled joint. He ran his lighter along the paper’s seam upon finishing; this was something he always did but I don’t think it actually did anything. Rick lit the joint and plopped onto the couch beside Jon then passed it to Jon and I took it next then we began to dole out more drinks. This time it was more Miller. It was too early to kill ourselves completely on liquor. Idle conversation continued among us.

Jon finally asked among the jibes, “You guys hear about that girl that drowned in the lake last year?”

“Was it a girl?” I asked.

“I think it was.”

Rick took the joint from me and, still holding the thing out from himself, said, “I’m pretty sure it was a little kid, wasn’t it?”

Jon shrugged, “Fuck if I know.”

“Well, what’d you bring it up for?”

“I don’t know.”

Rick laughed, “You said I was the one bringing the mood down.”

“Hey,” said Jon, “You guys are going to come back sometimes, right?”

I wiped my mouth and slid from the couch to angle my elbows across the narrow coffee table in front of the TV and took stock of the several things strewn there on its surface: a box of playing cards, the TV remote, the keys to Rick’s Camero; I removed the playing cards from their cardboard box and began to shuffle them in my hands idly. “What are you talking about?” I asked.

“I mean—you guys are heading out. I know. Me and Ren will be alright without you for the next year, but I know Ren’s heading out. He’s too smart not to. But after that, it’ll just be me. So, I guess I just mean—we’ll still get together like this sometimes, won’t we?”

Rick seemed to sit a little stiffer, “Of course we will, man. Don’t get all weird. Hell, Radford’s not that far. I’ll be back on some weekends, and we’ll do something.”

Jon took his turn on the joint and held onto the smoke until his cheeks turned pink and his eyes began to water. The thin smoke became a fog in the room with us and cast everything in a strange haze by the light of the TV screen.

I took the joint out of Jon’s shaking hands, “Yeah, of course we will.”

Rick nodded and sat stiffer still, until it almost seemed there was an iron rod in his back. “Could I?” he started, “Could I tell you guys something I’ve never told anyone? Well—I never told anyone but my parents.”

Jon let go of the smoke in his lungs and spat words through a coughing fit, “It’s not about more of that deep and meaningful bull, is it?” His words were harsh, but his tone was jovial.

“Nah,” Rick shook his head and when he was next offered the joint, he stabbed it dead into the ashtray which sat on the coffee table. The thicker smoke continued for a while, hovering stringlike. I sipped from my beer while I waited for Rick to continue. Jon got his coughing fit under control and also awaited elaboration. Finally, after rocking back and forth a bit, Rick said, “It’s not a good secret.”

Rick’s face took on a waxen quality; his face shone madly by the glow of the TV. In the relative darkness of the living room, his jaw seemed to elongate and physically protrude from his face. I blinked and assured myself mentally that it was only the odd angle of the light. And the fact that I was rather inebriated. But something didn’t sit right with me. His eyes too seemed to change from their familiar roundness until they became great big almonds on the sides of his head. It looked like his head might explode.

“Hey,” said Jon, leaning forward to better examine Rick’s face, “Are you feeling alright? Maybe I’m not feeling alright.” He nodded at the joint in the ashtray, “Was that laced with something? Jesus!” He rubbed his neck.

“No,” said Rick. His voice came gutturally and unnatural from the back of his throat. “It’s a full moon tonight. I’ve been feeling it all this while. I knew it was coming.”

Suddenly Rick stood from where he sat by Jon and his swim trunks leapt from his body with a loud rip and they fell to the floor in a pile of strands. His towel soon followed, rolling off those massive shoulders. He grew. The kid I’d known for years towered over me and Jon by a measure of several feet. He’d always kept himself fit, but never like this. I too began to wonder if Rick had laced the weed with something different. I blinked again, but Rick remained the same hulking creature. What had once been my friend was now something completely alien. Hair sprung from his pores and covered his body in thick fur. Bones snapped into place as his snout came fully into view. His round eyes no longer contained any placid trace of humanity. They were the yellow eyes of a wild predator. The low hum of a growl resided somewhere in that great fur-covered chest as the transformation came to completion.

Jon flubbed a few inconsequential words from his mouth before Rick—or what had once been Rick—reached over with a massive left paw and sheared Jon’s head clean from its shoulders. Blood sprayed across my face, and I flinched. It’s probably what saved my life in the end.

I slapped my hand across the coffee table’s surface, snatching the keys to the Camero, just as Jon’s headless corpse toppled onto its own head, into the floor beside me, and I launched myself from sitting over the back of the couch, but Rick caught my right ankle on the way over and pulled be partially back. I kicked my free leg, hoping to land a blow on the chest of the beast, but failed miserably. The towel which had rested around my own neck flopped over my head, so I was blind. I swung my fists wildly, trying to pull myself forward over the couch.

Feeling a hot exhaust of air come up my lower back, I tensed and then came a sudden rush of pain. It ran the length of my body and sent a shiver to my brain then back down to my feet before it came to rest directly on my right buttock. Slapping the towel away, I turned to see Rick’s wolfish snout buried into my rightward flank. Pitifully, I moaned, “Not my ass.”

Then the creature tore away a great hunk of my flesh and I spilled the rest of the way over the couch, landing on my own face.

Adrenaline shot me to life, and I scrambled for the door, putting my weight primarily on my left knee as I slid across the floor. As I brought myself to stand at the front door, I felt something almost like a charlie horse forcing my right leg to bend up towards my abdomen. I had no idea the extent of the damage but did not intend on remaining by the entryway to examine it. I bolted through the doorway, sliding down the steps of the porch into the blackness of the yard; the crickets met me out there again, a million voices in unison.

I went hopping, half-stepping to the Camero, feeling blood begin to drip from my right foot. Coming to the car, I took a brief moment to glance back at the house. There stood Rick, lumbering out of the doorway. He was a great big werewolf, humanoid yet monstrous, there’s nothing else to call it, not really.

Spilling into the car, I peeled out of the driveway and hit the main road. I shot through one of the routes intended for the Claytor Lake State Park and just kept on going. The headlights illuminated a spiraling dark road ahead. Everything was spiraling.

The Camero roared and I brought it to sixty miles an hour around a sharp bend and that’s when I slowed. I began to feel the blood puddle around the leather seat I was sitting in. I would need to stop and plug my wound or wrap or something.

I brought the car to a slower pace and began to search the shoulders for speed limit signs to adjust my speed by. Would it have been better if I’d been pulled over by a cop? How would I describe my circumstances? I stole my friend’s car. But my friend is a werewolf, and he bit me. Also, he killed Jon. I promise I’m not crazy. I’ll take you to see him. No. I could’ve done that. But I didn’t want to return to Rick. I didn’t want to ever see him again. Or whatever it was he’d become. I couldn’t. Besides, I’d not yet fully realized the situation. The idea of a werewolf had not even come to mind yet. What I’d seen was a monster, yes, but a werewolf was like the movies. Besides, I was losing blood, and I was tired from the adrenaline spike.

Pulling into a Citgo station with only a single car, I left the engine running while I parked and yanked open the glove compartment; old fast-food napkins spilled from there into the floorboard and I reached for them and began to shovel them into the back of what remained of my tattered swim trunks.

My dad rushed out to the Citgo after I called him on the exterior pay phone. Over the phone, he was initially angry, then worried, then said, “I’ll be right there Ren.”

I waited in the parking lot, counting the seconds while sitting in the driver seat of the Camero.

When my dad finally arrived, he rushed me into his own car, an old beat-up Buick, and took me to the hospital in Pulaski. I must’ve looked faint, and all torn up, because he didn’t ask me very many questions on the ride there. He just kept tapping me on the shoulder and waving his hand in front of my face. Every few seconds he’d say, “Stay awake!”

Upon receiving treatment from the assbite of ’06, my parents finally asked their questions. I told them I’d been attacked by some wild animal, and I feel like that wasn’t totally untrue. Whatever Rick was certainly wasn’t human.

After packing my right buttock with gauze, the doctors injected me with a rabies shot. At that point, the idea of werewolves had come clearly into my mind, and I began to wonder if that little shot would do anything for lycanthropy. Thankfully, this was something I never had to consider further. I remember those first few full moons, I was waiting for a change, but nothing came. It did not seem that whatever it was that Rick had could be passed on via bite. I was in the clear. Unless the gestation period takes longer.

But it’s been years at this point, and I doubt I’m going to suddenly wake up one day as a half-man half-wolf hybrid.

Rick and Jon both ‘disappeared’, naturally. I never heard from Rick again, and Jon was dead. My dad mentioned to me that he’d read in the Roanoke Times that they found Rick’s car at the Citgo he’d met me at. I kept expecting the cops to beat our door down, but they never did. Whether it had something to do with Rick’s rich parents, I couldn’t say. Assuming they did seems right.

They had my blood in the driver’s seat. If they’d investigated the house, surely there was blood everywhere from Jon’s death. But who knows?

I’ve only been out near Claytor twice since that night, and on both occasions, I went during a full moon. I drove along the backroads, snaking around the park, and passed Rick’s old house; I never had the guts to pull up to the place. What would I find? Would I pull into that yard and see Rick standing there in the threshold, ready to pounce? I don’t know.

On each of my drives, I rolled the windows down, just a crack, to let the cool air wash through me. And each time, I heard wolf howls in the [dark distance.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Edwardthecrazyman/comments/17qis3x/archive/)
