This is Telemachite, the town where I grew up.

Population: Zero.

But once upon a time it was Population: Twenty. It was a thriving, bustling town, named for the mineral underground that was said to be twenty times more powerful than uranium. It was recently discovered and the discovery was a game-changer.

Since then, scientists had been working around the clock to harness this incredible new source of nuclear energy. At least, that was what we had been told. The truth was, none of us really knew. Maybe we were too simple-minded for such confidential information. Everyone was roped in from all over the country to go underground and mine it. Most of us were poor and desperate, willing to do anything for a little bit of cash to stay afloat. 

We were, in the simplest terms, easily expendable. Forgotten. Missed. I know because I looked us up after everything happened in Jenny’s house. No town, no telemachite. Hushed up as always after word on what was going on and what telemachite could do had hit the higher-ups.

Like we had never existed.

My family was one of them. I was 10 at the time; my brother, Lucky, only 13. I remember days where we had to go to bed hungry. 

I remember when my dad got the letter. I remember my father’s eyes lighting up like he just won the lottery. I remember him hollering at us to pack.

We were there at Telemachite a year later.

All that seemed to happen so long ago, like a dream, almost. Sitting in the old mines, l looked at once was a thriving town. Typing this down on my phone, I can’t help but feel regretful. I wished we had never moved here. Wished we stayed in our old place, poor but safe.

But most of all, I wished we had never found Violet.

Violet was our family dog. I still remember the day we found it. We had just gotten off school and finished all our homework on the bus back since our school was far from the town. With nothing else to do, we had gone to a field west of the mines to play. We technically weren't supposed to be there since it was so near the mines and therefore dangerous; but we never listened anyway. It was a beautiful day, and after an hour or so we ran out of games to play, so we laid opposite each other with our heads touching to stare at the clouds swimming lazily by in the azure blue sky.

Then all at once a purple shadow washed over us and I heard my brother giggling, “Gem! Stop it!”

It wasn’t me. I sat up to look at the culprit and found a mangy dog bending over my brother. But this didn’t look like any of the strays I’d seen. 

No.

Its fur was purple.  Left to right, top to bottom. It stood up straight and stiff, like the bristles on my hairbrush, only this time it was poking out at unnatural angles. It twisted its head to grin at me the way a dog could, and I saw that one eye was silver, the other gold.

The weird thing was that we had been here for a month or so, and I had never seen any animals or any sign of wildlife. And this thing staring back at me now looked more robot than dog. No way around it.

It was a beautiful summery day and the sun was out shining, but my heart was as cold as ice and I couldn’t stop shivering.

The dog was still licking Lucky’s face. He laughed and rolled around the grass.

“Gem, can we keep her?”

I swallowed and looked forlornly at my brother and the dog. They both stared back at me with the same puppy-dog face.

“I don’t think it’s a good idea…” I said slowly.

Lucky wasn’t listening. He scooped up the weird purple dog and ran down to our town, shouting about his discovery for all who would listen.

***
Our parents stared at Lucky’s beaming face and my worried one. Lucky was still holding that dog. It was panting like crazy, and trying not to drool.

“Where did you get the dog again?” my dad asked. He was tired. His face was caked with purple telemachite dust and the stress of the day curled in his brows.

“Near the mines!” Lucky answered.

My mum smiled wearily at her son’s enthusiasm. Like my dad she spent all day in the telemachite mining business and you could see it in her hollow, haunted eyes.

“You can keep it,” she said softly, and Lucky squealed in victory and dashed up to our room.

I opened my mouth to protest but my mum put a hand on my shoulder. 

“Let him. He’s really happy about it.”

There were tears welling in her eyes.

“Besides,” my mum said softly, and she gave me a broken smile that cracked my heart into pieces as well.

“You kids have been spending too much time in that field. I think a dog might do you good.”

Lucky insisted I gave his dog a name. He said he hoped I could get to know it better. He also decreed the dog was female, even though it showed no signs of either gender.

So I named the dog Violet. And the other weird thing about Violet was that it (she?) was surprisingly a good girl. Came as asked, sat as asked. Easy to train. It also required no sustenance—no food, no water—we tried to give it some dog food we got at the supermarket and it didn’t eat any of it.

That also meant Violet didn’t poop everywhere. My mum was grateful for that.

While Violet won the rest of my family over, I wasn’t as sure. Violet limped around the house like it quite did not know how. Every joint sounded like a rusty tin can; every twist of the neck threatened to pop out its head. 

It gave me the willies.

I remember wearing gloves while petting it. In fact, the whole time Violet was in the house I could not remember taking it off. And to Violet’s credit, it kept trying to win me over too. Snuggling up next to me; snoring at my feet.

Finally, I crumbled.

“You’re a good girl, aren’t you, Violet?” I murmured, stroking its belly. Violet purred like a cat, wagging its tail.

Then I saw a fist, and the next second I knew I was on the ground, gasping for air. Lucky towered over me. His face was as red as a tomato and his brows furrowed like twin thunderclouds. He stomped on my abdomen and I winced.

“Get your filthy hands off my dog!” he screamed.

I stared at him. Lucky had never acted that way before. In fact, he was willing to always share his things. A good brother, of sorts.

But now he was foaming at his lips and his eyes were rolling round and round his head like a madman.

“Lucky?”

He kicked me again and I scampered away, whimpering. Then he grabbed Violet and stormed up to his room, slamming the door behind him.

The tight knot of fear in my stomach unravelled on its way to my mouth and erupted all over the marble floor.

I saw neither boy nor dog for several weeks after that. Lucky refused to go outside for any reason. He would only permit my mother to go upstairs to visit him and give him food. But even after that he stopped accepting food altogether.

We were all worried about Lucky. It was the subject of hushed conversations during dinner; in the day we averted our eyes and pretended we didn’t know he existed.

But even then it wasn’t enough. Screams shattered the silence every so often, screams of pain and the cracking of bones. Then it morphed into growls and roars that you could hear from miles around, and sometimes I woke up to those with my hair standing up on end and my breath caught in my throat.

My parents forbade me to check on Lucky during this time. I wasn’t allowed anywhere near his room. Only my mother went, every day, and I could hear her sobs as she tried to console her son.

Then even then she disappeared. My father cooked, tended to the garden and did chores. I helped. We sat in silence, just the two of us, while ear-splitting sobs and screams and growls and roars chilled me to the bone. I would look up, distracted, while my mind raced with questions and my heart ached with worries about my mother and brother.

But even my companionship with my dad didn’t last long.

I was sleeping peacefully one Friday evening when his rough hand shook me awake.

“Gemini. GEMINI WIGGINS!”

When someone yells my full name it is never good news. Particularly when it is three-thirty in the morning.

I know because the time is imprinted in my mind. The night I rolled over to check the clock, rubbing my eyes.

**03:32 AM**

“Gemini Wiggins! Get up right now!”

Everything was still spinning. The moon was still up, bright and full.

“Huh?” I yawned.

“You need to go.” 

His voice was soft yet urgent, but there was something strange within it, like the crackling of dead leaves under my feet. My vision cleared and I could see my dad’s face staring seriously back at me. 

And that was enough to jolt me awake.

For it wasn’t a human staring back.

It was a dog.

Or maybe half human and half dog.

Purple face. Golden eyes with no pupils. Ears rising slowly up to his head. He was hunched over, his limbs elongating like mad, and purple telemachite spikes erupted from his spine.

I watched, frozen, as bones cracked as his face jutted out into a snout. His glasses fell on the floor next to me and shattered.

“GO!” he roared, grabbing me and throwing me out the bedroom door. He must’ve known this was going to happen in advance, for there was a knapsack waiting for me by the front door.

I stumbled, tripped, grabbed the knapsack and when I got past the doorway I risked a glance back.

Three hulking shadows danced in the shimmering moonlight. The house shook with their roars and thundered with their heavy footsteps.

I fled.

***

Looking back, the rest of the night felt like a dream. I wandered house to house in my pyjamas and knocked on doors. Most of the lights were off and the curtains were closed. Several did not answer the doorbell.

Numbly I simply walked over to the next house. And rang the doorbell again.

If there was one thing I am grateful to my father for that night, it was that he gave me a heads start. I could hear those beasts at least two houses behind. Roaring and howling and shaking my bones.

Then I heard a crash and the shaking of another house. I stopped—and as if a magnet was calling me—looked.

The walls of the houses had crumbled under their new claws. Strangled screams pierced the air; even from a distance I could see hulking figures over my wide-eyed neighbour. He screamed again as they went for his throat, and blood exploded in all directions.

Then silence.

Then a growl. Telemachite spikes exploded out of his back.

**More** purple telemachite monsters turned and locked eyes with me.

*Oh god oh god oh god*

I turned and ran, trying not to scream.

*PLEASE let the next house let me in.*

The doorbell rang. It was the last house on the street.

*Please please PLEASE*

The door creaked open and an old lady glared back at me. All wrinkles, all frowns. Silvery hair.

“YES???”

It was turning to dawn, and the crimson sun rose majestically in the east. At the corner of my eye I could see the monsters—countless of them now—stand up on their hind paws and sniff the morning dew. Their eyes caught the sun and they howled in a way that sent chills up my spine.

Then they scattered, several disappearing into trees.

“Spit it out, girl.”

The old woman was still glaring at me. I withered.

“I—”

Words choked me. For the first time all night I was crying.

So instead I jerked my head behind me. Luckily there was still a telemachite monster in plain view. It screeched in the sun’s glare, as its purple skin melted like ice on a hot day. Soon there was a telemachite puddle on the pavement.

It was all the evidence she needed. The old woman nodded, business-like.

“Come in girl. And take off your shoes.”

She introduced herself as Jenny and it was clear she was living alone. Her house was bare. There were only some chairs, a table, a bed and a dusty baby grand piano. Another doorway led out to what I assumed was the kitchen and bathroom.

I stayed with her for a couple of days. She tried to take care of me even though it had been so long since she had a child. We ate soup for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and in the evenings we talked. It was a great way to keep our minds off the howls and screams outside, as new victims were swallowed by their bloodlust.

Although Jenny had never opened her curtains while I was there, the chaos outside seeped into the primal parts of my brain and stayed there. Even in my dreams, where I would sit, surrounded by my smiling family, before telemachite spikes erupted from bare skin and all over the table.

I woke up in a cold sweat.

I asked her a couple of times to tell me about herself. She was mostly quiet though. Just sat and watched me eat. Our conversations mostly focused on me, my family, my school, my hobbies. All the way until dawn.

It was only a few nights later (and after a lot of prodding) that she finally opened up.

Jenny had a son, apparently, who was once in the Army, and he was contracted to work in the mines after an injury forced him to retire from service. He was crushed to death by a huge slab of telemachite a few weeks back and then her husband committed suicide the next morning out of grief.

“Hanged himself,” Jenny had whispered, leaning in close. “I found him.”  I could barely hear her; cracks were starting to zigzag against the walls. My blood curdled when I realised we were probably the only two left.

The monsters howled again, and the house shook as they threw their weight on the house. The tips of their claws poked into the wallpaper.

“They’ve moved me out since,” Jenny continued. “Into this tiny little house where no one can see.” She was staring intently at me, her voice way too steady. I wondered if she knew monsters were destroying her house. She was doing her best not to look.

I didn’t want to look either. The roars and howls were enough. Still dust was fluttering gracefully to the floor. Every word sounded like they produced an earthquake.

“It’s been just me since,” Jenny said calmly. She smiled weakly. 

“Until you came, of course.”

Then she swallowed. Sat up. Her ears pricked upwards like a rabbit on the alert.

Seconds passed. Jenny swallowed again.

“They call me,” she said with such finality my heart stopped.

She walked gracefully towards the wall. Like a swan preparing to take flight. The walls finally gave way to reveal a gaping hole.

I heard what she was hearing. A mix of screeches and growls and barks, like a robotic animal trying to speak English. But there was also something unearthly *beautiful* about those voices lying underneath. Like a siren’s song.

Before I could stop her she had jumped through the hole and into the hungry telemachite monster mob below. For a second I was tempted to join her, but then I resolutely shook my head and jammed my fingers into my ears.

I turned away then, curling into a ball and burying my head on the bed. I shut my eyes, trying to block out the shrieks and wails and cries of celebration as they feasted. The howls that made me wish I was part of the furniture instead of on it.

Finally I felt the sun’s warmth covering me like a soothing blanket. I finally opened my eyes, only to find the house bathed in a golden light. The hisses of the monsters as they dissipated.
Dawn had arrived. I was saved by the morning.

I already knew it was no use staying here. Part of Jenny’s house was destroyed, and the new hole was more a liability than a form of protection. I found a can of soup and heated it up. After some breakfast, I gathered my things and departed.

Then I walked.

And walked.

And walked.

I had no idea where I was going at first. Just wandering aimlessly as the sun rose. But it didn’t take long for me to realise I was walking towards the mines. There was the field; there was the spot where we found Violet. There was the spot where it all began, where Lucky and I watched the clouds as happy as the summer stretching out long and thin before us.

The stairs leading down to the mines were still there. Well-trodden and carved from stone. The darkness beckoned. I hesitated for a bit, knowing the mines were a really dangerous place to be in—but neither was the open air anymore.

So carefully placing one foot in front of the other I went down the stairs.

Once upon a time these mines were busy. Miners scuttling to and fro like rats, hefting telemachite crystals to send to the labs. The clink of the pickaxe and shovel or the grunt of a miner as they attempted to dislodge a particular piece of rock. Now it was quiet. Peaceful almost.

It was uncanny.

I wandered a couple of miles from the entrance before sitting down beside a telemachite slab. My throat was parched and my head was swimming with exhaustion. I closed my eyes, rested, and downed half of my water bottle.

In school we learned about emergency services. I like to call them the Siren Gang, because they all have sirens on their heads. Back in my old neighbourhood there were everywhere. You couldn’t walk one step without hearing them screech and a policeman wrestling a dealer down the street.

They were my heroes.

But could my heroes help me now?

Maybe.

I held my breath as I called. I wasn’t even sure if I could get a reception down here.

Then:

“000, what is your emergency?”

*Yes!*

The operator was quiet, but understanding. He assured me he would deploy someone right away by helicopter. But he sounded nervous. Twitchy. He whispered his words like they were going to kill him.

Then he hung up.

All I could do was wait.

***

Look, they have been taking a long, long time. I mean, after twenty minutes of waiting I started writing this; I’m almost done now and they’re STILL not here.

Is Telemachite REALLY in the middle of nowhere? Literally not in any atlas or GPS or chart?

I used to take a rest by leaning against the slab and closing my eyes from time to time. But not any more.

See, I became aware of a pair of eyes staring at me. One silver, one gold.

It is breathing against my neck now. My heart is in my throat and shivering in fear.

*How—*

I see the snout. The gleaming eyes set back in its head. The smile, like it is celebrating its genius of finding me here.

Its jaw closes around my arm. 

Telemachite spikes ripple along my spine and push itself outwards. My skin is on fire. My vision is blurry, but I’m holding on.

I am staring at my phone now and at the big ‘POST’ button, sucking in another painful breath.

I do hope the rescue services get here soon. Hopefully with a cure.
