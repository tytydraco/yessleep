Right I’m not even jokin when I say this but don’t ever book surgery in Scottsdale Arizona especially not with anyone offering a “private consultation” and definitely not if the name Dr Roth comes up

I was 19 at the time just on a little trip with my cousin Ava to visit her mates and do all the usual tourist stuff you know palm trees fancy drinks hot weather whatever

She’d been going on about this plastic surgeon she found on Insta yeah Dr Ellis Roth apparently he was all the rage in that area real exclusive invite-only type of guy only took certain clients blah blah and she got this email saying she was approved for a consultation which she thought was mad lucky

Me being a good cousin I offered to drive her since her car was basically falling apart

So we pull up to this posh looking strip mall thing yoga studio one side wine bar the other dead bougie vibe and smack in the middle is this glossy white clinic with gold lettering on the glass BOTCHED by Dr Roth

Sounds more like a horror film than a business but whatever

She goes in I’m chillin in the car scrolling TikTok 20 mins pass 40 mins then nearly an hour and I’m starting to think this is taking the piss

So I head inside

Place is weirdly quiet like there’s music playing that spa-type stuff all waterfalls and wind chimes but no one's at the front desk no receptionist no other patients just that kind of silence that makes your ears feel loud if that makes sense

I call out no reply

I go down this hallway that doesn’t feel right like it’s too long for the building like it just keeps stretching and the lights overhead are flickering a bit like they’re struggling to stay on

Then I see it

This one door at the very end black frame red blinking light above it proper horror movie stuff swear down

And then it opens

Out walks this tall bloke wearing a surgeon's mask soaked in something dark not red more like black oil and he's got this calm slow walk like he knows I can’t run

Behind him I see Ava strapped to some chair eyes wide mouth hanging open like she’s trying to scream but something's stopping her

But bruv her face was wrong like genuinely wrong

Her eyes weren’t in the right place like one was lower and her mouth looked like it’d been stitched up and turned inside out

Like someone tried to rearrange her face like a puzzle but didn’t know what the picture was meant to be

Dr Roth or whatever he is just looks at me no words just raises his hand and does this weird pinch motion with his fingers like he’s grabbing the air

And suddenly my nose starts pouring blood and I drop like a sack of bricks

I wake up in the car engine running Ava gone sun setting

Clinic completely locked up

Next day we go back the whole strip’s fenced off boarded up like it never existed

Not even a listing for the business online anymore

I tell Ava’s parents what happened they think I’m on something cops treat it like she ran off

I start digging online and I find a post here on Reddit someone claiming Roth wasn’t just a surgeon but like some occult freak who believed he could fix people’s souls by literally taking their flaws and reshaping them into new bodies

Then there’s this old episode from the show *BOTCHED* the one with the surgery disasters right

One episode never aired I swear on my life

Season 4 episode 9 called “The Butcher of Scottsdale” only aired once on some late night US channel apparently

I found a low-res thumbnail before it got pulled completely and if you look close enough

There’s a guy in a surgeon’s mask standing in the background

And I swear his smile is stitched on

Not like with surgery

Like with thread

I don’t know what he is I don’t know where Ava is

But sometimes when I sleep I see that hallway again

And I hear that pinch

Like he’s still trying to fix me
