At 6:30 AM, the alarm woke me up then I dragged myself out of bed, kissed my wife on the cheek, and made breakfast for the kids before heading out to work. We live in one of those quiet suburban neighborhoods where everyone knows everyone, and you can hear a pin drop after 10 PM. Typical stuff, right? I work a boring 9-5 in an office, a job that pays the bills but doesn't do much else.

About four months ago, I started getting these letters. At first, it was just one. A plain white envelope with no return address. Inside? Just a single word, typed, no signature or anything: *"Hi."* No big deal, right? I tossed it in the trash, figured it was some prank, probably from one of the neighborhood kids. The next week, another letter showed up. Same envelope, same typewriter font, and this time it said, *"You."* Again, no return address, no explanation.

By the third week, I was getting annoyed. This one said, *"Are."* I told my wife about it, but she just shrugged and laughed it off. "You’re being paranoid," she said. "It’s probably a dumb joke. Ignore it."

I did my best to push it out of my mind. But as the weeks went on, the letters kept coming. Every Tuesday. I’d get home from work, open the mailbox, and there it was, waiting for me. *"Being."* *"Watched."* *"Carefully."* By the time I had six of them, I started noticing things. Little things. A car parked outside our house late at night. A man walking his dog across the street, pausing just a bit too long by our mailbox. I’d look out the window, and someone would be staring right back at me. Always. Watching.

I asked my neighbors, but they hadn’t noticed anything unusual. It started feeling like I was the only one who saw these things, like I was going crazy. My wife stopped laughing it off. "Maybe it’s time to go to the police," she said one night as I paced around the living room. "But what can I tell them?" I snapped. "Some idiot’s sending me letters with random words?"

The next week, the letters didn’t stop. They got worse.

One morning, I found another letter in the mailbox. This time, instead of just one word, it had three: *"They’re here now."* I felt a chill crawl up my spine. I scanned the street—no strange cars, no weird neighbors lingering outside. But something felt… wrong. The air was thick, oppressive. I didn’t go into work that day.

The paranoia set in deeper. I started avoiding eye contact with everyone. My coworkers. My neighbors. Even my wife. Everyone seemed suspicious. My sleep was a mess—I’d wake up in the middle of the night, heart pounding, convinced that someone was standing in the room with me, just out of sight. Waiting. Watching.

That night, while my family slept, I locked myself in the garage and spread out all the letters on the floor. I stared at them for what felt like hours, placing them in order by the dates they arrived. And then it hit me—the letters weren’t random words. They were in a pattern with the first letter of each word spelling out

*"Open the metal box"*

My blood ran cold. I stared at the sentence, my mind racing. No. This couldn’t be real. I slammed my fist against the wooden cabinets, the crimson of my hands beading down the wood, the pain not even registering. Outside, the world turned black. The streetlights flickered and died, the familiar hum of suburban life faded into a hollow, oppressive silence. My tears came, slow at first, then faster, pooling at my feet in the dim glow of the garage light. I was frozen, unable to move, like I had become part of the house itself.

Then, the light—blinding, searing—burst through the windows. It was so bright, I thought the sun had exploded, swallowing everything. I shielded my eyes, but the reflection from the kitchen mirrors made it impossible to escape. The light bore into me, through me, peeling away the world I knew.

And then… 

At 6:30 AM, the alarm woke me up then I dragged myself out of bed, kissed my wife on the cheek, and made breakfast for the kids before heading out to work.
