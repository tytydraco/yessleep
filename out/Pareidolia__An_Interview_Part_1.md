A few years ago, I started researching some of the history and lore of Southeast Ohio. It's on the edge of Appalachia, where the traditions of the mountains and the farms and factories of the Midwest overlap. The roots of this place run deep, and the stories I've uncovered are as varied as the people who call these hills home.

I've tried to avoid those stories that have already been told, and to find people and places who haven't yet shared their experiences outside of warnings to children or after a few drinks around a bonfire. It took some time, but the rumors and tales eventually led to discoveries - some of which I'm still trying to wrap my head around. The following is one such discovery - a transcript of an interview given to me by Mr. “John Owens” (not his real name) on September 17, 2021, at his current residence. We talked for over an hour, so I'm splitting it into [two parts](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12n160t/pareidolia_an_interview_part_2/).

*\[Interviewer’s Notes: It is evening and we are seated at the subject’s dining room table. The subject, Mr. Owens, is male, early 50s, medium height and build, with short dark hair and stubble peppered with gray, and a button-down work shirt over worn jeans and heavy boots. He’s drinking a beer and bouncing his leg nervously.*\]

ME: Ok, can I just have you state your name and a few details about yourself while I check the levels and make sure this is recording correctly.

JOHN: \[*loudly*\] Hello, this is John Owens and I’m–

ME: Oh, sorry, you don’t have to get that close to the mic. I can adjust levels here on the laptop. So again, if you–

JOHN: Can I say somethin’ real quick? Just so that it’s on record?

ME: Uh, yeah, if you have–

JOHN: I just want to make sure we’re 100% clear here. The only reason I agreed to this, is ‘cause Caleb says you’re trustworthy, and you said that you’ll change my name and all that when you write your book or whatever you’re doin’ with this. I don’t need folks down at Sharky’s thinkin’ I’ve lost it any more than they already do.

ME: Absolutely. I assure you that this recording is for my ears only. And you have it in writing that you will remain completely anonymous in anything published from this interview.

JOHN: Yeah, alright. Sorry, I just wanted…

ME: Nope, totally OK to ask, Mr. Owens.

JOHN: Call me John. Please. I guess I’m just a little nervous. I haven’t really spoke much about…all this.

ME: Again, totally fine. And also…\[*pause, keys tapping*\]...everything’s good on my end, but if you don’t mind, I want you to go ahead and state your name and some information about you for the record.

JOHN: Oh, ok, sorry…um, well, uh…my name is John Owens and I’m, uh, I’m the manager of the local branch of a heavy equipment sales and rental place and, um…well I’ve lived here all my life, about half that time right here where we’re sittin’. On this property, I mean. Do you..do you want me to talk about, like, my favorite TV shows? Or–

ME: No, that’s good. Let’s go ahead and “set the scene” for the first part of your…your experiences. Can you tell me what your childhood was like?

JOHN: \[*chuckles*\] You wanna know if my parents locked me in the basement or if I read too much Stephen King?

ME: Ah, no, not exactly. I just mean I want to know what it was like, growing up here.

JOHN: Yeah, ok. Well, I reckon I had a pretty average childhood. Daddy worked all the time, wasn’t home much but at least he was good to me when he was. Momma was a secretary at the high school for ages. We was pretty close, her and I. Didn’t get into too much trouble, grades were alright I s’pose. Come summertime, I was outside, keepin’ myself entertained. Growin’ up a “country kid” ain’t like you see in the movies…you can’t just ride your bike down the street to the sandlot or the ice cream parlor. If you’re lucky, there might be someone your own age a mile or two down the road.

ME: That’s how you met Sharon Gibson?

JOHN: \[*laughs*\] We “met” when we was both in diapers. Her folks had the farm just over the ridge there along Liberty Creek. Momma started watchin’ her as a baby when they had farm or church stuff to do. Youngest of four, had three older brothers. All homeschooled, kinda weird, you know. She was a hell of a lot smarter than me though, and I ain’t no dummy. She was also a tomboy, always in bibs and rubber muck boots, and usually covered in dirt unless it was a Sunday. Not that her mother didn’t wash her up, but I swear, she was like a dog that had to find somethin’ to roll in after a bath \[*laughs*\].

ME: You two got along well, then?

JOHN: Momma said we was like Charlie Brown and Lucy. I even called her Lucy when she was bein’ bossy. That was a good way to get punched. \[*laughs*\] She always seemed to be one growth spurt ahead of me, and she could pack a wallop . But we never had any real bad fights. Everything was fine between us until she left.

ME: That was in…\[*papers shuffling*\]...summer of 1980?

\[*There’s a long pause. A beverage can is heard opening in the background.*\]

JOHN: August 2, 1980. It was a Saturday morning, I’m in the kitchen and Momma’s hangin’ the wash out back, and then I hear her say, “Oh my God, where did you come from?” I look out the screened back door, and I see her talkin’ to Sharon. Momma brings her in, and she’s filthy and holdin’ her left arm up to her chest. She *said* she was on her way here and fell off her bike, broke the chain and maybe sprained her wrist. Instead of walkin’ the road, she’d decided to take a shortcut through the woods.

ME: You didn’t think that was the truth?

JOHN: Nah. Momma believed it, though. Then when she goes to call the Gibson place, Sharon says they ain’t home, had to go do “church business”, and they’d be by later that evening to get her. That was somethin’ else I thought Momma didn’t notice. Sometimes, Sharon just didn’t want to be home. I always thought it was because her Daddy was strict and made her do chores like clean out the cow stalls. She always seemed to get a lot of bruises from doin’ *that* job.

Anyways, Momma gets her cleaned up and puts a bandage ‘round her wrist. I was surprised when she said we could go back to the woods for a while. On the way, Sharon tells me we were going deeper into the woods than usual, back onto her property to visit somethin’ she called the “draggin’ oak”. We had to cross the little ridge there between her property and ours. It’s not that steep, but for a kid it felt like climbin’ Everest. First thing I noticed on the other side was how different it was from our woods, how big the trees were. Easily five, six feet and over a hundred feet tall. My daddy had told me there used to be trees as wide as cars in these parts back before they were all cut down. I reckoned these had escaped the ax somehow.

We came to the creek where the trail crossed it at some shallows. It was hot that day and it felt good to get my feet wet. But Sharon kept us goin’, clearly on a mission. We came right out into a flat clearing, ‘bout 50 yards across, ringed with giant old white sycamore trees. In the middle was this massive log covered in brush. That’s when I realized what Sharon had *actually* meant. Not “draggin'", like you’re draggin’ somethin’, but DRAH-GUN. I know I was just a kid at the time, but I swear to God it had two horns, two big knots where a set of eyes should be, and a ragged split at the end like the jaws of a crocodile. All the briar and vines on it were like ropes holdin’ the beast down. Sharon walks right over to it, runs a hand along it. So I did, too.

\[*Note: John leans back again, takes another long drink.*\]

ME: What did it feel like?

JOHN: \[*laughs*\] Like a fuckin’ tree. The closer you got to it, the more it was just a weird log. Huge, monstrous, but just an old dead tree. There were little blue-tailed lizards climbin’ all over it, and we tried catchin’ those for a bit. Then we went back over to the creek to look for crawdads. We’d been there maybe an hour when Sharon says “hey…I think I just saw something…” She’s lookin’ towards an old trail that was followin’ the creek upstream from the clearing. She grabbed her bag and marched towards it, sayin’ “Well, are you comin’?” So I grabbed my own stuff and took off after her.

The valley got narrower quickly, turnin’ into one of those gullies like you see up at Hocking Hills, cliffs and rocks on all sides. We climb over this one boulder–wasn’t easy with Sharon’s wrist–and now we’re standin’ on a huge slump block below the cliffs where the gully dead ends. It probably used to be a shallow cave at one point, but now it’s just a pile of rocks, with the creek makin’ a waterfall splashin’ over the cliffs. There’s a big hole off to one side, and Sharon’s already makin’ her way over to it, diggin’ out her flashlight. I come up next to her and peer in, and the floor of the pit, probably 15 feet down, is covered in a bunch of white shapes.

ME: Bones?

JOHN: Yes sir. Most I couldn’t make heads or tails of, but the skulls I could. Birds, squirrels, deer, cows even. I swear I even saw a bear skull. We climbed down to the creek where you could see all the rocks the big one was layin on, like the lid on a pot. There were gaps, including one big enough that I thought we could crawl inside the pit. Right as I’m thinkin’ that, Sharon disappears into the hole. I got real nervous about that. It wasn’t maybe a minute later that a coyote skull comes flyin’ out of the hole and stops almost at my feet. Then she’s squeezin’ out of the hole, droppin’ a box turtle shell in front of her. She brushes her self off, sticks the shell in her pack, and she says all matter-of-fact, “we’re goin’”. I didn’t argue with her. I picked up the coyote skull and we left.

ME: What do you think spooked her?

JOHN: I wasn’t sure. I noticed that she kept looking up at the trees, like she was seein’ somethin’. I asked her ‘bout it but she never really answered me, just shrugged. I was used to her bein’ like that sometimes, so I let it go.

ME: Did you go straight home after that?

JOHN: Yeah.

ME: And that was the last time you and Sharon played together as kids?

JOHN: \[*nods*\] For ten years.

\[*Note: John finishes his beer, then goes to get another. His refrigerator is stocked with Miller, a few bottles of condiments, and not much else.*\]

When we got back to the house, Sharon’s mom was already there waitin’. I thought maybe we’d be in trouble, but Momma didn’t seem upset at us. Mrs. Gibson did, though; her eyes were all red and puffy. Even after she put Sharon in the car, she talked with my Momma for a good long while. I knew somethin’ was wrong, but I was afraid to ask.

ME: Did you ever find out what happened?

JOHN: ‘Course I did. \[*pause*\] Turns out ol’ Pastor Harold Gibson was a piece of shit. He might have been a well-known farmer that also preached the Good Word every Sunday, but he also had a temper and a drinkin’ problem. Sharon’s older brothers had gotten the hell out when they could, leavin’ his wife Joanne and his only daughter to take the brunt. I felt like an idiot for not seein’ the signs, but when you’re a kid, unless you’ve been through it yourself, you *can’t* know, can you? It took me a long time to stop feelin’ guilty for not doin’ something about it.

The night before, Harold had caught Sharon sneakin’ out. He trashed her bike, then grabbed her when she tried to make a run for it. She got away, but spent the whole night huddled under the Dragon Oak with a broken wrist. Her mother didn’t even know she was gone till that next mornin’, she’d called my Momma right after we’d went to the woods. That Sunday, ol’ Harry shows up to the chapel, and the elders and a sheriff deputy are waitin’ for him. Seems he’d been skimmin’ money off the collection plate. That was the final straw for Joanne. She’d packed them both up and went to stay with an aunt over in Fort Randolph.

ME: And you never heard from Sharon after that?

JOHN: Nope. I had no idea where she was or how to get a hold of her. I wondered for a long time why she never thought to call me, though. She’d always had my number. I felt bad for her, but I’d be lyin’ if I said I wasn’t a little bit angry that she’d kept the truth from me and never tried to keep in touch. I think that made it easier to move on.

ME: So when did you two reconnect?

JOHN: Back in…’83, I think, I was workin’ at the paint factory over in Creston and made friends with a guy named Scott Klicher. One Friday, he said his sister was havin’ a little get-together that night, and she had a hot college friend named “Shari Wellington” who he wanted me to meet. I didn’t want to go but I owed him for beer or somethin’, so I went. He introduces me to this tall, drop-dead gorgeous blonde, and I say hi, and she’s lookin’ at me funny and says, “Johnny?” And I’m like, “do we know each other?” Then she says, “Johnny Owens, I oughta slug you!” That’s when it clicked.

ME: So you had no idea it was her?

JOHN: Not only did she look…very different from what I remembered, she’d also started going by her mom’s maiden name. And by Shari instead of Sharon. It was…surreal, finally gettin’ to see her after all that time. I figured she’d probably changed too much by then, but after we started talkin’...I mean, yeah, she wasn’t exactly puttin’ frogs in her pockets anymore, but she was still Sharon.

ME: Things were good after that?

JOHN: Really good. I never told her this…and I’m torn on whether I should have or not…but before I went to that party, I was in a pretty rough place. I was drinkin’ too much, did some harder stuff, and the shame of knowin’ I was turnin’ out like one of the people I hated most was bringin’ me down bad. Seein’ her and bein’ around her reminded me of what could happen if I kept goin’, and gave me somethin’ to live for. She saved my life then, and didn’t even know it.

ME: That’s pretty amazing.

JOHN: \[*pause*\] It is, ain’t it?

ME: \[*papers shuffling*\] So, you and Sharon were married in 1993.

JOHN: That’s right.

ME: Two kids, Hannah and Caleb. Then Sharon went to med school in 2002? That must have been hard to do with two young children.

JOHN: It was. But we had plenty of help. My momma was more than happy to help, as was Sharon’s mom when she was still able. She got Alzheimer’s around 2008 or so.

ME: You lost your dad right around then?

JOHN: Yeah. Heart attack. Not surprised, he was never one to take care of himself.

ME: \[*pause*\] And what about Harold?

JOHN: Well…right after Joanne and Sharon left, he’d tried to get himself straightened out. Mostly succeeded. Sharon’s youngest brother, David, had started comin’ back around, helpin’ on the farm. Both of ‘em tried reachin’ out to her a few times, but it wasn’t till after the kids were born that Sharon let it happen. We brought them out to the farm a few times. I think ol’ Harry had a lot to prove to her.

ME: And did he? Prove himself, I mean.

JOHN: Mostly. The Lord and his sponsor worked on him hard. \[*pause*\] He was still a stubborn old bastard sometimes. Remember that big wind storm in June of 2012? A *derecho*, they called it. We didn’t have power for a week, and neither did Momma or Harry, but at least all had generators. I came out here a few days into it to check on ‘em both, and when I get to the farm, Sharon’s dad on the tractor, makin’ a massive burn pile from all the fallen trees. I told him that wasn’t a great idea seein’ how hot and dry it was. By the time three different volunteer FDs arrived, more than half the woods was gone. After the fire, it looked like somethin’ out of a disaster movie.

ME: What did you do about it?

JOHN: Not much to be done. I got Scott and some other folks I knew, borrowed some backhoes from work, and we cleaned up as much as we could. Moved the biggest stuff into piles and took down some trees that were dead. It was such a shame to lose that place.

There was one spot, though, that we didn’t stay around. The clearing, where the Dragon Oak used to be, all those big ‘ol sycamores, half-blackened with ash. Like standin’ in the burnt-out rib cage of some giant animal. And I say the Dragon Oak used to be ‘cause it was gone. Nothin’ left but a pile of charcoal. I figured that punky old log had went up in a hurry. Damn shame.

I didn’t go back out there after that. Sharon didn’t want me to, anyways. But we still had to go out to Liberty Creek at least once a week. Momma was here in the old house, and Harry was just two miles down the road at the farm. Sharon and I worried about them both livin’ by themselves back then, so we checked on them as often as we could.

One day that fall, I came out to check on things, and Harry’s headin’ towards the woods with a dead cow hangin’ off the loading arms of his old Massie Ferguson. I remember sayin’, “You ain’t gonna be burnin’ that cow, are ya Harold? Didn’t you learn your lesson the first time?” But no, he says instead he was just gonna leave it “for the critters”. That’s almost as stupid - a good way to attract flies or coyotes. I offered to help him bury it, but he…*politely* declined. Basically told me to mind my damn business. That winter his cattle herd went from about 30 head to less than half that. I asked if he knew why his cows were gettin sick and dyin’, but never got a straight answer.

Then, right before Easter in 2013, I’m back out there and I find him in his kitchen, just staring out the window towards the woods. He doesn’t look at me, doesn’t even turn ‘round. I ask him if everything’s alright. He’s still starin’ out the window, and then he says, “I don’t think I’ve done enough”. “Enough of what?” I ask. “I didn’t do enough to make up for what I done.” Well, ‘course I think he’s talkin’ about what he did to Sharon and Joanne, so I say that he’s a changed man now, and that he shouldn’t keep beatin’ himself up over it. I ask if he needs me to stay longer. He says no, that he’ll “take care of it”. I called Sharon and asked what she wanted me to do, that he was actin’ strange. At that time, we was both pretty busy, Sharon had a rough day at work. Just stressed out, you know? I fixed him some soup, checked out a few other things, then I left.

That was the last time I saw him alive.

ME: Was that the night of the other fire?

JOHN: I get the call right as I’m pulling into work. It’s the sheriff’s department. Another damn fire out on Liberty Creek. I swing by the hospital and pick up Sharon. By the time we get there, the house is ashes. Waitin’ as they sifted through it all, looking for…lookin’ for him, that was a horrible feelin’. But they never found his body in the house. Somehow, that was even worse. I suggested we needed to check the woods, just to be sure. Me and a bunch of officers and firefighters head back there. That’s when we found the rest of Harry’s cows. At least a dozen piled at the edge of the woods onto a huge bonfire, now just burnt steak and charred bones. God, it stunk. But no sign of Harry.

ME: How long did you keep searching?

JOHN: All day and all that next night. As far back as the gully and the Bone Pit. The first fire had never reached that far. That was the first time I’d set foot there in 20 years.

ME: Did you…did you think they’d find him there?

JOHN: I…maybe. Yeah. You know, it was Good Friday. A part of me wanted to find him there, roll one of the stones away under the slump rock and he comes walkin’ out in his boxer shorts like some kind of old hillbilly Jesus. Wouldn’t that have been somethin’.

ME: But he wasn’t there. In the Bone Pit.

JOHN: No. And neither were the bones.

ME: What do you mean–

JOHN: I mean there wasn’t a single bone in that hole. Nothin’ but bare rock.

ME: That’s…what do you think–

JOHN: At the time? I had no idea. Maybe that someone else had found it. Cleaned it out.

ME: What about Harold? The police report said you thought it was sudden onset dementia, that maybe he’d thought whatever was makin’ the cows sick was makin’ him sick and that’s why he burnt them and the house.

JOHN: You read that? Yeah, that’s what I told ‘em. Part of me even hoped it was true.

ME: But you didn’t believe that?

JOHN: Like I said, I wasn’t sure what to believe. Sharon...I think she knew. And I think a part of me did, too, though we didn’t want to admit it to ourselves.

In the meantime, we found a will in Harold’s fire safe. He’d left the farm to Sharon. ‘Course it was stuck in probate for years due to the investigations and…everything else.

Then less than a week after we lost Harold, Momma got sick, went downhill fast. I think she’d been sick for a while but just kept it from me so I wouldn’t worry. And I know how this is gonna sound, but I’m actually glad it happened when it did.

ME: Why’s that?

JOHN: Because three days before she went into the hospital, she showed me a picture on her phone. There was a row of trees that had grown up along the fence at the edge of the back yard. She zoomed in on one of the trees and…yeah, it looked like a face. She said it was strange because she couldn’t see it again after she took the picture. She’d even taken more pictures just to be sure. I wish I still had it. The picture, I mean.

ME: You think she would have ended up like Harold? If she’d stayed?

JOHN: \[*long pause*\] Maybe. Yeah, I reckon’ I do. But, again, I didn’t know that then. She died on Memorial Day, two months after Harold. And Sharon and I had inherited all of the land we’d grown up on. It was our responsibility now.

Me? Well…I just wanted to move on, go through Momma’s stuff, figure out what to do with the house. Sharon would come with me sometimes. I’d catch her just starin’ out the back door, lookin’ towards the ridge.

ME: Is that when she started having…experiences?

JOHN: \[*snorts*\] “Experiences”. Nightmares, you mean. She’d have these horrible dreams of running down Liberty Creek with a tidal wave of blood and bones coming behind her, while twisted trees with...with twisted faces and branches like claws would reach for her.

We went back to the woods again together, just one more time. It was a few days after her daddy “went missing”. She said she needed to…needed to feel like she’d done *something*. We took the side-by-side as far as the clearing. I told her we wouldn’t go any farther than that. She got out, shakin’ like a leaf the whole time. When she got to where the Dragon Oak had been, she just dropped to the ground and bawled her eyes out. That was…I think it all finally got to her that day. She wasn’t the same after that. That’s when the nightmares started. That’s when she finally started tellin’ me about all of it, what had been happening to her.

She saw a face at the end of June, she said. It was where my mother had seen it, along the back fence. I told her not to go back out there, to either property. And then I took a chainsaw to every damn tree within 500 yards of the house.

ME: Did that…did that do anything?

JOHN: \[*scoffs*\] Who knows. Maybe. But I had no idea what we was dealin’ with.

ME: Was that the first time she saw one of the faces?

JOHN: Nah, she’d been seein’ ‘em off and on for years. Always just assumed her mind liked to play tricks on her. Like she’d see someone watching from a distance, but then blink and it’s gone. Or, she’d see one, move closer and it’s just some knots on a tree. The day we went to the Bone Pit, she’d seen one *turn* to look at her. Then something moved fast through the trees. That’s what we had followed, though I never saw it.

ME: Did she say if she ever saw them after she moved?

JOHN: I asked her that, and she said yes but it wasn’t the same. She thinks that she was just conditioned to see them everywhere. There’s this scientific term for it, I’ can’t remember it, but you know…some ten-dollar word that means you see faces in things. A car’s lights and grille, or the Virgin Mary on a piece of toast. It’s hardwired into our brains, to find faces in things. It works for other stuff, too. That’s how our ancestors spotted our dinner hidin’ in the bushes. Or somethin’ that wanted to make dinner out of us.

ME: That makes sense. So was there a part of you that still hoped that it was just all in her head?

JOHN: Of course. I was worried that she’d inherited some sort of…psychosis from her father, maybe. But then, maybe it was something else. Somethin’ on the farm that was messin’ with people’s heads. You know, like that mold that caused the witch trials? Anything other than…trees with fuckin’ *faces*.

A week later, I was right over there in the backyard, and I hear something makin’ an awful racket back by the woods. Sounded like a deer or somethin’ bein’ attacked, snortin’ and bleatin’. I thought maybe it had got stuck in the old barbed wire fence there. By the time I got to where I figured it was, it was quiet. I looked all around, was about to leave when somethin’ fell out of a tree to my left.

It had been a deer, alright. *Had* been. What was…left, was mostly just skin, some of the meat. No organs, no bones. Not much blood. The head was…was turned inside-out. Imagine pullin’ the skull out of the skin like a glove. Yeah.

I’m just starin’ at the carcass there on the ground, and then I hear a noise above me. I saw it then. A face, clear as I can see yours but…it’s *part of* the tree, of the trunk. Then just like that \[*snaps fingers*\], it’s just a couple of knots. I ain’t gonna lie, I ran like a scared kid.

ME: And then you told Sharon about what you saw.

JOHN: I did. I shouldn’t have said anything. I had convinced her to stay home, and away from that godforsaken land, and then I’d sell it and it would’ve been someone else’s fuckin’ problem. But…\[*chuckles*\] I don’t actually believe that. She wouldn’t have been able to let it go. First time she’d heard about a fire, or somethin’ happenin’...she would have done what she did either way.

ME: I think you’re right, John. It’s not your fault.

JOHN: Yeah. \[*sniffs*\] It was a total fluke that Hannah, my daughter, had been tryin’ to get ahold of her at work after she didn’t answer her cell. They’d told her she’d left early, so she called me to ask if I knew why. I didn’t, had no idea why. I started callin’ other people, hopin’ somebody might know where she was. I got to the house, of course she wasn’t there. But on the kitchen bar was…a box turtle shell, sittin’ on a note.

ME: \[*long pause*\] What did it say?

JOHN: \[*crumpling of paper. John begins reading the note*\] “I can’t tell you enough how sorry I am that I am writing this. There was a time where I thought maybe I had escaped, had put enough distance between it and myself…but it has always somehow pulled me back in. And now, it has gotten too close, and taken too much from me.

“There is something in those woods - you know it now as well as I do, as well as my father did. It was kept at bay but now it is free to roam. I really thought that maybe I could just distance myself from it once again, that you and I could just stay away from that god forsaken place, sell the land and make it someone else’s problem. Then we could be at peace.

“But I can never be at peace knowing that it’s still there, waiting. Waiting for me, the last Gibson willing to hold back the evil. I don’t want to do this, God knows I don’t want to. But I hope that, if you can’t understand what I’ve been through, you can at least understand why I have to go there and end this. I have to protect what is mine.

“I don’t want you to follow me, but I know you will. If you do, protect yourself as much as you can. I think fire might do it, Daddy always told me to carry a lighter just in case. Maybe guns work, too. We’ll find out.

“I love you, blockhead. Sharon.”

\[*John puts the paper back down on the table and rubs at his eyes.*\] Do you–do you care if we take a break? Sorry, I just need to get up, stretch my legs for a minute...

ME: Um, sure. Let me just stop the--

\[*Interviewer's Notes: I paused the recording here. John gets up quickly and heads to what I assume is a bathroom. I hear a door shut, and I'm left alone. I look around the small, dark double-wide trailer. Out the nearby sliding glass doors, I can see his back yard. John had said that he'd removed every tree from his property, and his yard is indeed tree-free, save for one, a young one about 10 feet tall at the old fence line.*

*I squint, the sun just beginning to touch the trees atop the nearest ridge. I wonder what the forest looks like on the other side, perhaps new growth mingling among the charred remains of what came before. I imagine what it would be like to see faces peering back from each burnt trunk. And despite the late summer warmth, I can't help but shudder.*\]

[PART TWO](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12n160t/pareidolia_an_interview_part_2/)
