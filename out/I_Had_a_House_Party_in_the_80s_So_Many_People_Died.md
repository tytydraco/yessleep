Back in the '80s, we thought we were untouchable. We were young, reckless, and about to graduate high school. The future was a distant thing, and all that mattered was that one last night to burn everything into memory. If I had known what was coming, I would have begged my friends to stay home.

But I didn't.

And so many people died.



We planned the party for weeks. No one cared about prom—our party was the real event. "Tom" was hosting, and his house was perfect: isolated, no neighbors, no nosy adults. We had enough booze and food to last all weekend, and word spread fast. When the night came, nearly everyone showed up.

The music blasted—Guns N’ Roses, Motley Crüe, all the good stuff. The air stank of beer, sweat, and weed. People were hooking up, breaking furniture, and screaming over the music. At some point, I remember looking up at the sky and swearing I saw something—a bright streak cutting through the darkness, too fast to be a plane, too controlled to be random.

A meteor?

I blinked, shook my head, and laughed it off. Probably just the booze.



Sometime around midnight, "Tom" invited a few girls and me to his parents' bedroom. We started playing Spin the Bottle, then Truth or Dare. Typical drunk teen stuff—making out, stripping, laughing too loud. One girl, "Kim", hadn’t really been playing. She sat slumped in the corner, her head bobbing slightly.

"Too much to drink," I thought.

But when we tried to skip her turn, she stopped my hand.

“I wanna play,” she slurred, grinning.

Her eyes looked… wrong.

"Tom" smirked, spinning the bottle. When it landed on him, he grinned wider. "Alright, "Kim". Give me a lap dance."

The girls laughed. "Kim" just stared at him. Then, still smiling, she pulled her top off without being told.

The music outside was deafening. Someone was screaming, but the party was so wild, I barely noticed. All I saw was "Kim", swaying her hips as she walked toward "Tom". She straddled him, pressing close. His cocky smirk faded.

Something was off.

"Kim’s" skin… moved.

Then her chest split open.

Tentacles, black and glistening, shot out of her ribs, wrapping around "Tom’s" face before anyone could react. His scream turned wet and gurgling as they yanked him forward, his skull crunching like a soda can. Blood sprayed in a hot mist, and "Kim"… moaned.

The room exploded into chaos.

Everyone screamed, shoving against each other, clawing for the door. I was pushed forward, my body crushed against the others as "Kim" tore into them. The girls shrieked as the tentacles latched onto them, ripping flesh like paper. I reached the door, fumbling, my hands slick with someone else’s blood.

I turned the knob.

The hallway was worse.

Blood covered the walls. Bodies—so many bodies—torn apart, limbs scattered like discarded dolls. The music still played, but beneath it was something else. A wet, sucking noise.

And they were everywhere.

Dozens of them. Some still looked normal—laughing, dancing—until their bodies burst, and the tentacles inside erupted. People ran, slipped in blood, fell, were dragged away.

I ran.

I don’t even know where I was going—just away. I shoved my way into the bathroom, slammed the door, locked it. My breath came in gasps. My hands wouldn’t stop shaking.

There was a window.

I peeked out, expecting more horror. Instead, I saw the backyard. A few creatures were dragging bodies toward something glowing in the distance. A red light pulsed beyond the trees, bright and unnatural. The ones that reached it… changed.

Their bodies snapped and twisted, new limbs forming, mouths stretching too wide. Then they turned and came back. Disguised. Laughing.

They weren’t hunting anymore.

They were recruiting.

Something banged against the bathroom door.

Then another.

Then another.

A hole punched through the wood. I stumbled back as slick, black tendrils slithered through, feeling, searching. "Kim’s" face appeared in the gap, her mouth too wide, her voice sing-song.

"Come out, baby. I saved you a dance."

I threw myself at the window, shoving it open. The drop was high. I didn’t care.

I hit the ground hard. Something cracked in my ankle, but I forced myself up, limping toward my car. Behind me, the creatures screamed. A new light appeared in the sky.

Not a meteor.

A missile.

I barely made it to my car before the explosion hit. The shockwave knocked me forward, heat searing my back. I didn’t stop. I didn’t look back. I just drove.

The last thing I saw in my rearview mirror was the fireball where "Tom’s" house used to be.



I didn’t get far.

A mile down the road, men in black military gear blocked my path. Helicopters hovered overhead. Before I could react, they yanked me from the car and shoved me onto the pavement.

I was tagged, bagged, and dragged away.

They tested me. Asked questions. Threatened me into silence.

Then they let me go.

The official story? Gas leak. Explosion. Tragic loss of young lives.

But they never explained what those things were.

They said they got them all.

I didn't believe them.

I moved away, changed my name, started fresh. I don’t go to parties anymore. I don’t talk about what happened.

But some nights, when the sky is clear, I see something streaking through the dark—too fast to be a plane, too controlled to be random.

And sometimes, late at night, I hear something scratching at my window.

A soft, wet sound.

And I know.

They missed one.
