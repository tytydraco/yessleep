Day 1

I can't shake this feeling. Something's off. The air feels heavy, like a storm's brewing. People on the street seem on edge, their eyes darting around, searching for something. I can't put my finger on it, but it's there. It's real.

Day 2

The news is buzzing with reports of a mysterious illness. They say it's spreading fast, but no one knows what it is. Hospitals are filling up, and the doctors are baffled. I can't help but feel a knot in my stomach. This is just the beginning.

Day 3

I saw one today. A man, stumbling down the street, his eyes vacant and wild. He was covered in blood, and he was... growling. People screamed and ran, but I couldn't move. I just stood there, frozen in fear. What the hell is happening?

Day 4

The city's in chaos. The infected are everywhere, attacking anyone in their path. I've barricaded myself in my apartment, but I can hear them outside, scratching at the door. I don't know how much longer I can hold out. I'm so scared.

Day 5

I ventured out today, desperate for food and water. The streets were eerily quiet, the only sound the distant moans of the infected. I found a grocery store, its shelves mostly empty. I grabbed what I could and hurried back, praying I wouldn't be seen.

Day 6

I can't sleep. The nightmares are too vivid, too real. I dream of being chased by the infected, their hands reaching out to grab me, their mouths open wide, ready to bite. I wake up drenched in sweat, my heart pounding in my chest. I don't know how much more I can take.

Day 7

I met someone today. A woman, hiding in the shadows of an abandoned building. She looked as scared as I feel. We didn't speak, just exchanged a knowing glance before parting ways. I wonder if she's still alive.

Day 8

The news says the government is working on a cure, but I don't believe them. This is too big, too out of control. I think they're just trying to keep us calm, to stop us from panicking. But it's too late for that. We're already lost.

Day 9

I can feel it, creeping up on me. The fear, the paranoia. I'm starting to forget things, like my own name, my past. I don't know if it's the illness or just my mind playing tricks on me. But I'm scared. So damn scared.

Day 10

I found a group of survivors today, holed up in an old warehouse. They're just as terrified as I am, but at least we're not alone. We've decided to stick together, to try and find a safe place, somewhere far away from the infected. I don't know if we'll make it, but we have to try.

Day 11

We lost one today. A man named Tom. He was bitten by one of those things, and we had no choice but to leave him behind. I can still hear his screams, echoing in my head. I can't help but wonder if I'll be next.

Day 12

We're running low on supplies, and the infected are closing in. We have to keep moving, but I don't know how much longer we can last. The fear is eating away at us, turning us into shells of our former selves. I can see it in their eyes, the same fear that's consuming me.

Day 13

I can't do this anymore. I can't keep running, keep hiding. I just want it to be over. But I can't give up, not yet. I have to keep going, for the others, for myself. I have to believe that there's still hope, that we can survive this nightmare.

Day 14

We found a safe haven today, a small town untouched by the infection. The people here are wary, but they've taken us in, given us food and shelter. For the first time in weeks, I feel a glimmer of hope. Maybe we can beat this thing, maybe we can find a way to live again.

But as night falls, and the shadows grow long, I can't help but feel that the darkness is still out there, waiting to swallow us whole. And I know, deep down, that the horror is far from over. I don't know how much longer I can survive.
