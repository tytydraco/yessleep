The house I grew up in was quite a new build, so it couldn’t have been haunted. But the things I experienced in it would convince you otherwise. 

Over a period of two nights and three days, I went through the most terrifying times of my life. 
I’d been seeing all sorts of weird things already but the majority of it was pretty benign, young children came and went through the walls, curtains and doors opened and shut on their own, the tv turned itself on to static with white noise etc, the usual stuff you see in films. 
My parents said it was just an overactive imagination and now older I would have believed it if it wasn’t happening again. 

It started when I walked into the room next to my bedroom, my mum told me it was always there, just a spare room they stored stuff in but I don’t remember it ever existing.
But I do remember what happened afterwards. 

You’re probably asking how do I know it started when I went in if I don’t remember it? Don’t worry, I’ll get to that. 

I got really ill as a child once, getting to 106 degrees Fahrenheit and it was in that room my parents found me passed out on the floor.
They called the doctors who told them not to move me but to run a cold bath and put ice in ready. 
One doc came for a home visit not believing that I was that temperature, that the thermometer was wrong or had been misread. The bath was for just in case. 
He only took 5 to 10 minutes to get there (luckily my local GP was literally around the corner), he checked on me and yeah,  the thermometer wasn’t wrong. 

He picked me up and carried me out of the room, ready to throw me into the freezing bathtub. 
I woke up and felt like I’d just had a nap, I asked what was happening and shouted for him to put me down instead of shivering and crying while still unconscious (a weird side effect I know). 
He didn’t want to put me down so I bit him and he dropped me. 
He then took my temperature again and told my parents he was the most confused he’d ever been throughout his career, my temperature was normal, I was acting like a normal kid, like I hadn’t been sick at all. 

Nothing else happened that day until it turned into night. My parents had gone next door for a cup of tea and a chat so I was at home alone, not very caring but I had seemed normal again. 
I was playing with my toys in my room, chatting to my imaginary friend who I’d funnily nicknamed Ghostboy. 
Then I heard my name being called from downstairs, it didn’t sound like my parents or neighbours but it was definitely an adult voice. At first it was calm and soothing, almost like whoever it was, was actually singing my name. 
Halfway through however, it changed to be more gruff, nasty sounding like I was being told off. I could still hear the singing within but there was something what I would consider evil, like it wanted to hurt me. 
I did what all kids do and ran up the ladder into my bed and hid under the duvet until I fell asleep. 

The next morning I was woke up by the light shining through my window, I felt refreshed. 
My eyes slowly opened and I saw something blurry above me. 
At first I thought it was my dad coming to wake me up, so I told him to go away and I rubbed my eyes. 
Then I saw what it was clearly, a translucent head floating, watching me. I couldn’t make out any details but I could see it was the shape of someone’s face and part of a neck. 
I screamed that loud, my parents who were downstairs heard me and thought I was behind them. They ran upstairs to check on me and found me once again buried beneath my covers. 
For the next hour, I cried nonstop. The only thing that eventually stopped me was my dad promising to take me to a shop to get some new toys and suddenly I forgot all about the strange head. 

On the way, I saw a man dressed in a long brown robe with his hood up and a rope tied around his waist. 
I asked my dad why the man was out wearing his dressing gown, he laughed and asked where I saw him. 
When I turned to point, he was gone, vanished into thin air. 
My dad thought nothing of it and off we went again. 

When we got home, I took whatever toy we bought up to my room and started playing, dismantling parts to put them back together again. 
My curtains shut themselves and I told Ghostboy to stop messing around and open them again so I could see what I was doing. 
He didn’t reply. 
Having blackout curtains, it was almost pitch black so I couldn’t see him anywhere either. 
I stumbled over my toys to the window and opened my curtains, letting the sun shine back through. I looked up at the blue sky and saw a cloud in the shape of a hand. 
Then I turned to play with my toys again, but in place of Ghostboy was a woman, a small and very thin naked woman. 
You know how people say it’s scary when people see straight through you? That it’s like they’re looking into your very soul?
Well this woman was staring straight at me. Right into my eyes, fixated on them. She didn’t care about my soul, she was watching my whole self. 
Once again I screamed and I don’t know why as kids we think we’d be safe under the covers but I tried running to my bed again. 
As soon as my foot moved though, so did she. 
She lifted her hands up to her head and started tugging at her hair, ripping it out bit by bit to the point of it getting wrapped around her boney fingers. 
So she pulled harder and harder and with a bloodcurdling shriek, tore her scalp off. 
Blood ran down her face, she was still staring at me and I ran past her hesitantly. 
The rest of the day when I closed my eyes, all I could see was her screaming bloody face accompanied by strange moving creatures zooming towards me but with their attention on her. 
Nothing else weird happened except that I didn’t see ghostboy at all, normally he was with me almost 24/7. 

That night, things only got worse. 
I dreamed that I was on a school trip and I lost the group I was in, then the scalpless lady came and told me I was stuck, that I was hers forever. 
I woke in a sweat and needing to use the toilet, I jumped out of bed. 
To the left of my room was my parent’s room and the forgotten room, to the right were stairs that curved around the wall with a big window above. 
I didn’t want to look towards the forgotten room but had to make sure my parent’s bedroom door was shut, that way I knew they were asleep. 
It was, so I thought ok nobody is downstairs, I can go for a wee in peace. 
I turned to my right and froze in place. Floating in front of the window was something all I can describe as a white mass in a humanoid shape, the face resembling the Scream Ghostface mask but with inverted colours. This was years before that film existed by the way. 
It raised its “arms” towards me and started slowly moving my way. 
I wet the bed that night. 

The third day, nothing happened during the morning. I went to school and all was fine up until midday when my mum came to pick me up because my dad had a heart attack and had to go to hospital. 
He survived and is still alive to this day but he was in that forgotten room when it happened, and I’m pretty sure it was because of that room as to why it happened. 

Ghostboy greeted me when I got home, I was so relieved to see him. He told me that I was going to get hurt if I went into the room again but that I needed to if I wanted things to stop, and that we needed to go during the day before the lady and whatever the other things were got stronger. 
I was frightened for my life. I was only a kid but legitimately felt like I would never see my parents or friends again. 
We went upstairs, ready to confront the beings of the house. 
I opened the forgotten room’s door and stared in, nothing stood out at first. Old toys of both mine and my parent’s, an ironing board, wardrobes and shelves. 
Then I saw something moving on the floor out of the corner of my eye. 
I couldn’t tell what it was, it looked like a plastic bag moving erratically in the wind. 
When it became aware of our presence it shot upwards and faced us, it was the same face I’d seen through the window with Ghostboy, the same blurry face that scared me when I woke up the day before. 
It rushed towards me but Ghostboy jumped in the way, it took one look at him and fell to the floor, cowering, back to its plastic bag state. 

Ghostboy then took me to one of the corners of the room where it met my bedroom and told me to follow while he effortlessly went through the wall. 
I ran out of the room and into mine expecting to see him somewhere in there but I had no idea where he was so ran back into the other room to the corner he took me to and realised there was a gap between the inner and outer walls just thick enough for me to squeeze through. 
At the end was a much larger room, one that couldn’t have possibly been in my house. 
In the middle was the scalpless lady, stood motionless, waiting. Her eyes opened and she stared at me the same way she did before. It took every bit of my energy to not run away. 
I realised Ghostboy had gone, had he ran away scared? I couldn’t blame him if he had and in the brief moment I looked away for him, the scalpless lady came at me, hands stretched out ready to do whatever she was going to do to me. I felt her grip my head and push inwards to try crushing my skull, her long sharp nails cutting me open and I screamed and watched as the hair from her fingers slithered their way inside the wounds. 

Suddenly, everything stopped, Ghostboy had managed to pull her off me. He told me to run, that he was sorry he brought me there and thought I’d be strong enough to defeat her. 

After that day, nothing of note happened. I still saw creatures in my mind when I closed my eyes and still saw the random ghost on occasion but as I grew older, I started to forget everything that happened, I grew more sceptical that ghosts existed. 
Yesterday however I woke up to my neighbour screaming, today another neighbour screaming, then I saw a door to a room in my house I never knew existed and the memories came flooding back. 
I don’t have Ghostboy anymore though, this time I’m on my own.
