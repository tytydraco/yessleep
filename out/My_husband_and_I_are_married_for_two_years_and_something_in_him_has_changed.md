I looked at the reflection in the bathroom mirror and suddenly startled seeing my gloomy face. I had almost forgotten that there was a power cut in the area I lived in. I picked my phone and dialed a number. The person on the other end said "Hello babe". I could not help myself but smile hearing his voice. I had been married to this person for almost 2 years now. His name is Michael. We met each other in our senior high and started off as friends, but soon we hit the road as lovers. He was an year older than me. I know him since 6 years now. I had wandered off in my own thoughts when suddenly my husband said "Babe, are you still there? You okay love?"

I blushed silently and replied "Yeah, I am alright. I just wanted to tell you that there is no electricity and I am kind off scared of the dark." 

"So do you want me to come over and peck you on your neck love?" replied Michael.
His reply made me blush even harder. I remembered last night. It was another romantic nights of unlimited passion. During the first year of our marriage, we had frequent love making, but now it feels different. It feels new, as if I have been sleeping with an entirely different person. 
"Hello..?" said Michael. 

"Hey sweetheart, I'll be okay. Just come home early. I love you", I replied. 

"Love you too" he said, then I disconnected the call. 

It's a full moon night and there is a power outage in my area. I lit up a candle and started walking towards my bedroom. The sheets on the bed still had Michael's scent on them. I blushed again thinking of what tonight will be like. Lately, Michael have been the definition of a perfect husband. He was never so close to me. We were together and happy, but now it feels like he knows exactly what I am thinking and what I'm expecting of him. 

The candle in my hand flickerd as I noticed that the window beside our bed was open and moonlight shown through it. I quickly covered the candle with my right hand. I stood infront of a large mirror that I had bought from an antique store last month. As I looked at my reflection, I felt bit different. I felt as if there was something more to the mirror than what could be seen through my bare eyes. I was looking extremely beautiful in the white sattin dress that I wore to surprise Michael. The moonlight now fell upon me, making me look like the main character of a movie. I couldn't resist myself and went to touch the mirror. As I did so, the surface of the mirror liquified and I was sucked in. 

I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that I was standing in a room that lay inside the mirror. I could hear rats squealing somewhere infront of me. Luckily, the candle was still lit. I started to walk through the empty room. I felt a presence and I was startled by a frail voice. 

"Help me Meg", the voice said. 

I was taken aback for a moment. 

"Who is it?" I asked. 

"Heeeelp", the voice cried back. 

Somehow, it felt as if I knew the source of the voice and I knew that person for a long time. I raised my candle and I was startled to see a lanky man with long beard sitting in the corner of the room holding a dead rat in his hand. 

"Michael, is that you?" I asked.

The only reply that I got was "Meg, help us".

....

I suddenly remembered how unhappy I was in our marriage. Michael had been distant and I had started to wonder if our marriage was falling apart, when suddenly he changed. One day, I was sitting infront of the bedroom mirror and was wishing for my life to change for good. 

"Please help me out of this hell", I prayed. 

The next day, Michael was a different person. He was caring, loving and he never again fought with me. It's been almost a month ever since. 

"Meg", the voice said.

I rushed to him and picked him up. I had already understood what was happening. The Michael who was on the call with me was my husband's doppleganger. I hurriedly took his hand and pulled him out of the mirror. Luckily we both came out of the frame and at the same time, we heard the front door creak open.

"Oh sh*t, he's back", the real Michael said. 

My hands were freezing at this point and I started to hyperventilate. Michael quickly grabbed my hand and we hid in the closet. The voice from downstairs called for me. It slowly began to move upstairs and somehow, the voice began to get heavier and the foot steps sounded like stomping. 

"I know you found him and I am coming for you", the doppleganger said. 

I was out of my mind at this point. 

"Come out Meg, come out. Lets play this twisted game where you and I will not be the same. 
I will wrap you in my arms so strong, and make love to you all night long.
I will hold your body next to mine until the moonlight falls upon you and makes it shine. 
Come baby come, let's have a night of passion,
If you want it hard or just the old fashion."

His voice grunted while he sang this song. I could feel my husband's blood boil in rage. I held his hand and shushed him. 

Currently that entity or doppelganger or whatever it is, is standing outside the bedroom door and trying to open the knob. I am posting this from my phone. I don't know how much time I have or what I can do to come out of this situation. Please pray for me. And if I don't post any further, then understand that we are no more.
