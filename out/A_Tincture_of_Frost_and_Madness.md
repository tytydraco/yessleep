The cold is a fickle thing, no less human in its endeavours than beast. It is a case of split personality, a calm, idyllic expanse, a gentle inviting face, with a deep vindictive streak ready to pounce at the opportunity. 

You can try to withstand it. Yet, it will reciprocate by pushing through the cracks, creeping in while you are none the wiser, blowing at your fires, and breaking through your woollen layers. 

A stand against it will surely meet with a punishment which will rarely leave you without a story to tell, blackened vestiges, or a lack of both. 

And if you are met with the misfortune, the frost will toy with you. It will nibble at you, grip your lungs, and paint your skin white. 

Then as it is just about to encompass you in a whirlwind, both elegant and merciless, it gives you a false illusion of warmth, a fake sense that everything is alright, allows you to believe you succeeded in defeating the beast, 

and in your lunacy, while you could just jump for joy, it rips this life from you. 

Perhaps an act of mercy, killing you not in your misery, but in your delirium, or perhaps it is the cruelty of a predator playing around with his prey. Like a tomcat to a battered mouse, cut open and exposed, letting it believe for a moment, there is a path of escape, only to reel it back in for another round of torment.

Regardless, you are dead all the same. 

The void greeted me, and I greeted back— briefly. Linger too long; you are bound to be swept in its embrace. With a resolute slam, I shut the door to the hold. It was 13:00 and I was the fortunate participant of a 5 hour habitat analysis. As I took off my glasses, I winced at the deep indent left on the bridge of my nose, then aptly began wiping the coating of frost which dressed it. 

My temporary residence in Antarctica was designed to make use of almost all ‘state-of-the-arts’, even the arts unknown to the average person of the states. To me, it looked like you rented a hospital room and then followed the directions of a home decoration magazine. The place wasn’t horrible, don’t get me wrong, but it was a zoo, just a hollow replica of one’s true habitat. 

It was the size of a New York apartment, and shaped like a capital D when viewing from the front. As a result, the interior was designed to be modular and compact. Opening the pressurized doors greeted you with your workspace, a hollowed out part of the wall to suit your monitor, a chair, and the computer built into the wall adjacent. I was fairly certain that work being the first thing you saw was management's idea. To the left, your bedding sat, with another hollow out in the structure to fit a potted plant. If you were ever kept up at night, the curve of the roof just beginning to dip gave comfort to all but the claustrophobic. To the right was a kitchen, everything that could be built into the structure was. It featured an upside down L shape, starting at a fridge on the end closest to the computer, and a dishwasher on the farthest. In the middle sat an island block with a single chair for eating.  As an afterthought, the bathroom was squeezed in the empty space where kitchen and wall were separated. On the horizontal of the L, the fridge was coupled with a sink and counter.  Opposite, a complete bio-monitor panel, 5 feet in length and 3 in width. Two arcs of white light extended from its middle, encased in white paint, and wrapped around the whole structure; the exception was the cupboards, seeming to flow behind. It provided a visual break from the soft rose tones present everywhere else but the black floors and marble tiling. 

It was all such a rush, declassified documents, the slaps on the backs from my colleagues, looks of admiration from my superiors. Finally, it was time to make a name for myself, like a great explorer of old, I was to pursue the unknown. But like any rush, it left without saying goodbye, leaving me yearning for times lost in the sands. The whole operation was menial work dressed up in a fancy covert package. If I had known what I know now, I would’ve slapped myself for even considering wearing a suit to the mission debrief— a symptom of a ‘Bond’ binge. 

As if to further dismantle my delusions of grandeur, a team of 10 arrived alongside me, all outfitted in identical units. A larger central hub housed a mess hall, vehicles, and laboratories. Inside of which was where you had a few moments of socialization; the rest of human interaction was the glance of your reflection upon computer startup. 

I was still burnt from my dance with the climate, my nose trapped in a perpetual cycle of leaking and freezing. When I went to heat  my hands under the warm stream of the sink, it felt as though a match was lit under them.

And ever lurking was the hound of the north, its howl present to remind all of its dominance. It whipped at you with winds sharper than most blades, and a flurry of snow encapsulated you from each direction. 

Observed even from the research facilities mobile units, the storm's vicious nature remained on full display. 

I had ridden in a robust one man vehicle, the designer clearly taking inspiration from a space rover. The cockpit was a fair compromise between a claustrophobic nightmare, and a well spaced laboratory. 

The majority of my time was spent noting behaviours of various organisms, and albeit fascinating, began to get dreary as the hours grew long. I did notice however, a thriving population of cross breeds between what looks to be a bear and some kind of aquatic animal, lacking any fertility issues. I recalled my enthusiasm outpacing the truck's engine on the ride home. 

I sat on the stiff office chair, and a quick biometric scan of my face confirmed my identity. The computer sprang to life, with the monitor displaying the motherboard’s manufacturer. I extended a cord from its spot on the desk into the usb slot on the wall. It was a bridge between the raw data held on the vehicle connected to the larger compound to my housing unit. I cracked my numb fingers, and let out a yawn as the computer parsed the info. As soon the files were available, I clicked into the external camera log. The trip had been a slog up until now, but perhaps this discovery would be a respite from the boredom. 

Recordings of the species frolicking about, in and around a small patch of forest were served to my display, and I ate it hungrily. Potential names, the fact that an interbreed of such distant animals could produce offspring, all of it, and more raced through my mind. At first glance it could be mistaken for a classic polar bear, sporting a fat insulation layer, white fur, a round robust build. Yet, little details gave it away, its paws partially webbed, its form more streamlined than the average bear. The head was strong, broad, but the snout was sleek. Ears pinned back, and eyes faced forward. The thick muscular tail was the biggest clue that this was a unique creature.

A true apex predator, both land and sea adaptations, and if I had to guess it had a form of sonar. The genetic incompatibilities between whatever parent species seemed to have been remedied in some unique way. It fascinated me, encouraging a raw, powerful, curiosity. 

Yet, something else, it was just past the tree line. It flickered in and out of frame, a deep, rich black that would have blended in with the forest if not for its glimmering, slimy, sheen. I immediately chalked it up to a bug in the enhancement AI. Still, I laid my elbow on the desk, hand to my temple, brow furrowed as I pressed ‘enlarge’ and rewound the log. Normally, I would have ignored something so trivial, but the possibility of a second discovery lured me in like a fish to water.

That, and the storm had begun to call. The wind picked up, scratching at the walls, searching for a way inside. I wouldn’t be leaving this room for quite some time. 

Just as I was nearing the unidentified footage, the program buffered, then promptly crashed.

I placed my hand to my head, palm rubbing my eyes. I had just realized how long it had been since I last blinked.

A deep sigh left me as I leaned back in my chair. The screen had gone black, save for a faint reflection of myself, illuminated by the dim emergency light overhead. For a few seconds, I just stared—half at my own tired expression, half at the void where the footage had once been.

Then, the monitor flickered.

A soft click. Then another. The system whirred back to life, but something was wrong. The playback window reopened on its own, skipping ahead. Lines of corrupted data scrolled past like something was sifting through it faster than I could follow. My fingers tensed over the keyboard.

I hadn’t touched anything.

Another flicker. Then, the screen stabilized.

The footage had changed

it was as if time itself had stopped to gape at what I was looking at. I took a sharp breath, and for a moment, it felt harsher than if I had thrown myself into the midst of the storm beyond my door. 

AI glitches are supposed to resolve themselves after reanalyzing the affected frames. There was no glitch of the system. When I replayed the footage, I bore witness to what now clearly appeared to be the thin limb of a creature that dwarfed even the animals beside it. But something else had changed.

The flickering stopped.

I was certain, the line, well limb, in the distance had been perfectly straight yet it’s shown … bent. Impossible, I thought. I rewound the footage again. No. I was sure of it. It had definitely moved. My mind raced with questions I couldn’t answer, and even with the conditions threatening to pull the roof off my head, the only sound in that room was my own pounding heartbeat.

And then, any resolve I may have had dispersed. A misshapen head glared back at me from the screen. No, a moose skull, charred and melted. My eyes darted back and forth between, its head, its legs, how it began lowering itself to peer at me. 

The walls of the cabin groaned under the storm’s relentless assault. The wind howled through unseen gaps, rattling whatever was not tied down, sending them toppling one by one. And somewhere in the madness, my heart joined the chaos, hammering in time with the storm.

The footage became more convoluted; my head thundered with every second I kept my eyes pressed on the screen. My eyes began to twitch, and my agape mouth rattled back and forth. It felt as if my body was a generator, my capacitors ravaged by a surge too powerful. 

A flash of light illuminated the room, driving  out any wayward shadows. I was there in that moment for eternity. My eyes peeled open by an unseen force. The white expanse was unnatural, it was too bright. I felt as if I was looking straight into the sun, but there was no warmth. Only cold. 

Then in an instant, my monitor cracked, and my glasses flung to the ground. A mesmerizing display of light lit up the room as the rays danced off the glass shards. In a daze, I was on the floor, gasping for air, my vision covered by blanching spots. I was left with no memory of the past hour and a dying urge to return back to that thicket. 

A primal, raw, maddening call no man could dream of refusing. 

I arose into a seating position, one knee up and one down, and gasped at the chaos that surrounded me. The panel on the monitor was completely destroyed, and its remains circled me— along with those of my glasses. Cupboards flung open, dishes strewn across the room. The plant above my bed seemed to have exploded, with its former inhabitants caking my mattress. I shook my head, gazing at the fridge door which was hanging on by a twisted scrap of metal. 

What the hell happened here? I had asked no one in particular. I looked at the monitor in front of me, squinting my eyes. For the life of me I could not recall what I had just been doing, or where I was for that matter. It was not exactly forgotten, I could feel the emptiness which my memories were supposed to fill. It was as if they were stolen, and there was an imprint left in their wake. 

I blinked.

Everything was back in order.

The cupboards closed, my monitor whole. The fridge steadily humming, door shut as if it had never been disturbed. The plant above hung lazily, lush and thriving. 

I sucked in a breath, my pulse started pounding again. The air had gotten tight, each rise of my chest harder than the last. 

The details of my setting blurred, and merged together. Fine lines dissipated as colours bled into one another. 

My eyes strained trying to keep track of the shapes' choreography, before I squeezed them shut. 

I wanted to curl into a ball and scream until I had no throat left to do so. The hum of the fridge grew louder, sharper, until it became a loud whistle shrieking overhead. 

My eyes shot open, and began darting around. 

My surroundings began to solidify, I recognized the dim concrete, a faint red glow all around. it felt so familiar to me, but for the life of me I couldn’t imagine why.

The air felt no less suffocating than if I were drowning. The room— no, the walls, the men in white coats, everything was wrong. 

They sat hunched at rows of box computers lining the walls. Their fingers punched the keys urgently, dots of sweat beading on their foreheads. Each wore a pistol strapped to their chest, but knowing these gear heads they weren’t using it for offensive. Just for a way out. 

I blinked again. Hadn’t I just been somewhere else? 

Yes, that’s right. 

I had thrown up in the bin just 15 minutes ago. Spent the next 15 cleaning any remains off my uniform. The tan and green kept my secret safe. I recall looking to my chest, the 3 pointed stars a reminder that any sign of weakness can be the whole platoon's downfall.  

A second whistle cut through the air. 

Red lights now pulsed powerfully overhead, flashing against the barren concrete walls. 

I braced for impact, grabbing hold of a chair with my left and desk with my right. 

An explosion sounded out in the distance, rattling the dust in the bunker. it had just missed us. 

A thin man ran to me, whose oversized helmet banged around his pinhead. I could see the wisps of blond hair cut short, betraying the confines of his headgear. 

“General, we need to retreat from the eastern front,” he stammered out, the bunch of papers he held falling as he spoke, “it’s imperative that—“ 

“Not another word Jenkins,” I barked, “how can we afford losing our advantage?” 

My vision sharpened, the haze lifted as the spell melted away. The air grew lighter, the bunker quieter. How dare this lackey, Jenkins, mean to tell me how to win a war? I’d fought my way into this world, and by god, would I be willing to leave the same way. 

“Sir, how can we afford not to?” 

I closed the distance between us, my eyes burning into his. I jabbed my finger into his chest as I spoke, my voice low and dangerous. 

Then I paused, taking a puff of my cigar for dramatic effect. I leaned back in my leather chair, drumming my fingers on the polished wood of my desk. My colleague, Tom, sat across from me, mouth slightly agape, hanging on every word. 

“Well, what’d he say?” Tom asked me, his brown suit crinkled as he leaned forward, elbows on his knees. A half empty glass of whisky caught the light of the June sun. 

“Ah, I hadn’t gone that far yet,” I said, glancing around my office. The rotary phone next to a stack of papers, faint hum of the typewriters being worked in the next room— it all felt so mundane opposed to the war time narrative I recounted to Tom. 

“Don’t just stop there,” Tom said with a smile, “I smell a best seller coming from you, pal” 

I stood up and turned away from Tom, taking in the large green plant in the corner of the office. The tiger carpet, which had cost a pretty penny, lay lazily gazing at my mahogany doors, their gold finish catching the sunlight.

Striding over to the large glass windows adjacent to my desk, I clasped my hands behind my back. The city sprawled below, bathed in the warm glow of the afternoon sun. Dust motes danced in the light, normally unseen but now illuminated like tiny stars. A Presley song played softly in the background, its melody at odds with the unease creeping into my chest.

I turned my head slightly. “Tom, you never did tell me why you have a moose’s skull for a head” 

Tom leaned back into his chair, fingertips touching. There was nothing behind the charred bone— but I could tell he was burning a hole into my back. 

The eye socket partially melted, like glass pulled too soon from a furnace. A sickly sheen coated the head, as if routinely dipped in oil. 

I stared back at him, his jaw rattled as his head tilted slightly, as if to raise an eyebrow.  

A soft chuckle, before he spoke, “what are you talking about buddy?” 

The warm glow of the office was gone, the music faded, and I sighed as I was no longer immersed in my recollection. The therapist’s concerned eyes met mine, her pen poised over her notepad. “And how often do you have this dream?” She said gently. 

“I dunno, maybe once a week? I always tell some different story.” I said, looking up from my vantage point on the therapist's lounge chair. 

“So tell me”, she leaned forward, gaze steady, “how does this dream make you feel?” 

I hesitated, the image of the skull flashing in my mind. “Feels like I’ve been lying to myself,” I said finally, “You know what I mean, like I’ve been ignoring something so obvious, staring me right in the face” 

“It’s interesting you say that,” with a soft tone, quite mother-like, “ if you don’t mind me asking, what would you say is your biggest fear?” 

“Well, truthfully, losing control of who I am, my personal compass, it terrifies me, really.”

The therapist began dotting something down in her notebook. I took a moment to scan the office, a habit I’d picked up. The lounge chair beneath me was familiar as ever, and across a small coffee table sat my therapist, in a recliner. I turned my head, glancing over my shoulder at the large window behind me, where the second story view overlooked a bustling downtown street. A few feet away, a bookshelf stood beside a bamboo tree.

Even though I never read the books, nor the titles, their presence made me feel welcomed. As if to say, you are grounded, their colours touching a spot of comfort in my mind. The midday light caught the leaves of the bamboo. I sat staring at them, analyzing the plant’s intricacies. 

“Mr. Hansen?”

I glanced up quickly, “Ah sorry,” I said, embarrassed. “What was the question?” 

“I want you to look at a few images and tell me how they make you feel,” she peered at from behind her glasses, “can you do that for me?”

On the table, she had laid out a series of printed black shapes that could be interpreted this way or that. I picked up the stack, and started to make out the first one. 

“Uh,” I furrowed my brow, “I see a couple” 

“Hmm, interesting.” She wrote a quick note, “keep going and I’ll write what you say” 

“A person- no, a group running.” I set the page on the coffee table atop the previous. 

“A man crying out, his hand, I think, is raised?” 

“I- oh, oh man.” 

My chest conscripted, I tried to make a sound but to no avail. This time, I wasn’t guessing. I knew this shape, and very well at that. 

“Is something the matter Mr. Hansen?” 

“No, it’s uh, just that”, I trailed off, the papers falling from my hand. 

I recoiled back on the lounge, like a scared animal. My heart threatening to pound through my rib cage, mouth hanging agape. 

“Mr Hansen,” 

the sound of bones clicking after each word.

“Get control of yourself.” 

The lifeless sockets tore into me. I couldn’t bear to look for longer than a few seconds, yet I could describe the features as if I marbled them in stone. 

The face of my tormentor. Just a glance and its grip grasped my lungs. My attempts at breathing were futile. 

The bookshelf, had it always looked so dilapidated? Was the dressing of mold, the black rot of the bamboo stem, ever so present? 

My eyes winded, as if forcing me to take in my surroundings.

“Stay back,” I commanded, though my voice betraying my words. 

“I swear to you,” it was more pleaded than threatened, “stay.. stay back” 

“STAY AWAY FROM ME.” 

“STAY AWAY FROM ME,” the man repeated. 

I groaned, and b-lined for the living room. My half chopped carrots kept vigilant in my wake. 

I stood in front of the television watching the scene play out a little longer, then I changed the channel. 

Reruns of cheesy horror dramas are all they play these days. 

A hop and a whistle and I was back to preparing dinner. Now, what would Linda like  in a soup? Does rice work in a soup? 

To not keep the carrots waiting any longer, I got back to work, making a mental note to fully flesh out my recipe. 

Chip, chip, chip. 

A quite therapeutic sound, it brought me back to when I was a lad.

My mother loved the kitchen, even devising a cookbook of her own. She made an effort to always hand it out at every neighbourhood function. It was truly an example of her determination, I recall many times she invited friends for tea— just to hand out that damn book. 

Shaking me out of my daydream, a fat blob of red stained deep in the hem of my white shirt caught my eye. I held my arm out and stared for a moment. 

Did I knick a vein? No, that wasn’t my blood. Well, no bother, I’m not hurt, but this shirt might be done for. A quick wash under cold water and I was finishing up with my carrots. 

She might like some beef, that woman is half carnivore I swear. 

Or, I could ditch the soup, go full on fried rice. Although, we did eat at that Asian place just last week. Anywho, I’d have to decide by the time I finish cutting the onions. 

I set the carrots aside and picked out an onion from the fridge. A second mental note was made to add onions to the shopping list; I had just picked out the last one. 

“So, ya’ve gather’d your boys here to g’wan with my treasure, have ya?,” the television blared out lines from an old western. 

I gave a few curious glances at the action, a tense drawing of pistols, and a gunfight ensued.  

As I returned to my task, I took note of the knife. Heavier than before. The onions, soft. Too soft, and supple. 

For some reason, I felt a chill raise its way up to my nape; I grew acutely aware of the beating California sun shining on my forehead through the window overhead the counter.  

Was my hand shaking? “Get a hold of yourself man,” I spoke out loud. 

I cracked the window, this heat must be making me delirious. 

The breeze hit like a crashing wave to a beach shore. I could hear the neighbourhood kids yelling. I smiled, oh to be young. 

Shunk, shunk, shunk. 

The onions were chopped in halves, then in strips.  

Again, I managed to become distracted by the tv. There was an actor, whose face of abject terror was discernible even in my peripherals.  

I stood inquisitively, turning to face the screen. I get the sense I worked with that fellow, but just where? 

As I tried to recall, the chill creeped up on me again, as if to let me guard down. I shook my head, and, partly to distract myself, continued the chopping. 

Thunnk, thunnk, thunnk

Without exactly knowing why, I began to cut the onions with more passion. I felt, almost a sense of rage begin to bubble, my hands felt clammy. I began to dive the knife harder into the cutting board. 

It no longer felt like I was cutting onions, nor was it in the kitchen. 

Thunk, Thunk, Thunk.

Shadows began to feel longer, the lights a little dimmer. Yet, all the same, I felt like a puppet, my hands moving of its own accord. 

Thunk…. Thunk.

At times I didn’t even realize it was moving at all, I had intense focus only on what was in front of me. 

My knuckles grew white as I gripped the handle tighter; my breath became ragged. 

My attention was solely on the board, each stroke my blade slid more powerful than the other, all the while— CRACK. 

“Ah, brother,” I said exasperated. I had cut a deep indent in the cutting board, which pulled me out of my stupor. 

I breathed heavily, could I be having a stroke? A sick unease washed over me. Without a moment's notice, I grabbed a rag and thrust it under the cold of the sink. I put it overtop my forehead and made way for the dining room chair, knife in hand. 

I had to get out of the sun. 

“Are you going to still live in ignorance?,” the television blared before I had the chance to sit. 

My interest piqued, I turned my head. It was that actor from before, yet this time in a white lab coat. An infomercial was playing. 

Seeing him twice raised my spirits, I cracked a smile. Albeit, tainted by the lethargy that seemed to infect deep into my body. What could be the chances he’s shown in a time slot back to back. 

“You can’t keep chopping away forever,” the actor grinned. A gleaming smile so bright you could light a room with it. 

“How long do you want to live in your fantasy world ignoring everything you’ve done?” 

The children playing, the birds chirping, the dripping of the tap I never bothered to tighten. All ceased as a close up of the man seemed to encapsulate me into keeping my eyes locked forwards. 

It was as if he turned directly at me. As I titled my head slightly, I could swear his eyes tracked. 

“And what of our families? Who let you become executioner of the innocent?”

Then the sound of applause and laughter began to fade in, ushering out the silence. 

Hot iron passed into my veins. 

I felt my chest struggle against a crushing weight. 

I slowly peeled my head off the screen, whatever else the man was saying a blur. 

I ran to the cutting board in an attempt to regain normalcy, to no avail. 

The feverish cuts synchronized with the sound of glasses clinking. 

My crisp suit began tugging at the seams, with every powerful thrust of my blade. 

Tears began welling in my blood shot eyes. Any confidence left had finally dissipated, evident of shaking breath 

In a desperate attempt to keep myself grounded, I prepared a powerful swing of the blade. 

I pulled my hand back, intended a slam of the blade with everything I had in me. 

But— 

There was no knife. 

Instead, my champagne glass sailed to the ground, shattering on the ballroom floor. 

The music didn’t stop, nor did the laughter waver. 

Although, a whale-like man turned to face me, jowls trembling with rage. A dark stain now present where my drink had caught him.

“Composure, man! You ought to learn it” he huffed, a thick, gruff voice from under a bellowing moustache. The fat on his neck shook ever so slightly as he spoke. 

“I-I’m sorry,” I stammered, “I seem to have lost control of myself.” 

He left with an astound “harrumph” and turned away into a mess of people. 

I took in my surrounds, shimmering balls reflecting off crystalline dresses. A mess of fur scarves, tailed suits and men with a skewed sense of importance. A fat air of sophistication hung over the crowd. 

My hands were still trying to grip a phantom knife when a woman touched my shoulder. 

“I see you stuck to your usual dramatic introductions, dear” a voice teased. 

I turn, a sly mood overcame me, though I was unsure why. 

The woman wore a flowing, obsidian gown, The diamonds at her throat seemed to ripple and move along with the light of the crowd. 

“I took it you were going to make me find you” she laughed, stepping closer. 

A heavy scent of lavender, and something metallic, accompanied her. 

I must know her, of course, but the name my lips searched for was nowhere to be found. 

“You were always good at making a scene,” she smiled knowingly, as if we shared some unspoken secret. 

My hand twitched, there was no knife, yet my fingers curled as if they grasped a handle.

I let my gaze wander, a subtle attempt to jog my memory.

It’s when I noticed— everything was too perfect. 

They danced in unison, movements seamless, like they practiced this a hundred times over. 

Yet, when they laughed, mouths moved, faces contorted, but the sound came moments later. 

The glow of the chandeliers too bright, as if to drown out fine details, not illuminate.

Why did every man have the same smooth skin, every woman an hourglass figure.  

Why did the air tug at my throat, like a turtleneck one size too little? 

She touched my cheek, fingers softer than the feathers. She guided my face to hers.

“But tell me,” she whispered, brushing her nails on my chin “did you enjoy the show” 

My stomach jumped. 

“..what?” 

The music warped, the elegant waltz lurched, now jumped from one tune to the next. 

The dancers didn’t stop, they jerked in painful movements to the new beat. 

Why couldn’t I remember the woman’s name?

Why was I here? 

What was my name? 

Who.

Am.

I?

A breath. 

A twitch. 

A snap. 

I lunged. 

The moment my first collided with her face, it was not flesh, nor bone, but painted ceramic that shattered on impact. 

Beneath? 

Hollow. 

Panic took hold of me. I began lashing out at the guests. 

legs, torsos, all to the same effect, all cracking and splintering revealing nothing underneath. 

Not one person turned to address the commotion, even the ones smashed in half. 

Simply keep laughing and dancing. 

I fell to my knees and raised my hands to the sky, tears rolling into my gaping mouth. 

In the flash of the waiter's belt, I caught my own reflection. 

A man grinned back at me— wide eyes crazed with desire, a flush smile too wide for his face. 

It was me. 

And it wasn’t. 

The scene all around me spun, as if I were caught in a tornado. Everything blurred together, and details crashed into me, sharp and sudden, like a head on collision. 

Distant screams pierced through my head as I struggled to make sense of what was in front of me. 

I shut my eyes tight, knowing it was no true protection against the cruelty of the outside. Then— drip. It was soft at first, barely a whisper. 

Despite the chill creeping into my bones, I smiled. 

It was just a bad trip, nothing more nothing less. An adverse reaction to some frozen airborne deliriant I must have inhaled. 

That had to be it. I was back in my dorm, and absently-minded-me forgot to tighten the sink again! 

But no matter how hard I tried, the cruel mistress of reality had other plans. I could not deny the feeling of snow, as I kneeled down on the ground.  

I finally mustered the courage to peel my eyes open. I was instantly aware of the frostbite gnawing at my fingers, the cold seeping deep into my bones. What I saw next was worse than any injury, My hands were dressed in a cruel glove of blood. The crimson was too real, there was no denying it. 

I wiped myself off and clambered to my feet. Just behind me, the door to the main faculty lay open. A faulty component let off sparks. Inside was dark– though the sun, bleeding through the jagged frame, betrayed any notion of serenity. 

My knees buckled as I made my way towards nowhere in particular. The wind whipped around me, a symphony of my misery. 

I had no direction, nor a plan. The open room seemed as good as any. 

I took a few steps, then under my boot a squelch. 

I looked down to see a beady eye, dislocated from its owner, gazing at me accusingly. 

With muted acceptance, I lifted my leg, shaking off what had once been a man’s face.

Out of habit, I dragged myself to a powerswitch.

For a few moments, the fluorescents burned my corneas. As things stabilized I lay witness to the full, grotesque splendor– my massacre. 

The dorm was in utter ruin, tables and chairs pushed aside in a mad frenzy, clearing the space for the real spectacle.

The conglomerate of the research team, those accompanying me, had been arranged in a stiff, unnatural display, their bodies forced into grotesque vaudeville poses. Their muscles, pulled taut into exaggerated smiles, were stitched in place by sharpened molars and jagged shards of bone. Those not propped up, presumably their pieces repurposed for the set, laid scattered around the would be theatre crew. 

At the center of it all, the man, the one who had spoken to me in my daze, stood grinning. His own peeled-off face dangled from his fingers like a discarded mask. His other hand, gripping a blood-slicked blade, pointed toward the wall behind him.

It was not a question that it was intended for my eyes. I lurched forward, past the twisted remains of my coworkers. I was waiting for one to move, pat me on the back, tell me “Hey, buddy, we wouldn't have done much better in your shoes.”

No respite came. There would be no salvation. 

On what used to be the tray collection table lay a pile of photographs—every photograph from the facility’s records.

Each had been replaced with a picture of me— and the charred skull of a moose.In each, I was the central figure. My face inserted seamlessly into group photos, with everyone else replaced by the blackened skeleton. There was a wedding photo with me standing in place of the groom, the bride now a skeletal husk. The edits were flawless, as if I had always belonged in those frames.

I picked up one particular frame, and laughed. 

It was a harsh, strangled sound at first, then built up to a maddening roar. 

I turned my back slowly to the frigid metal behind me, and sank slowly to the floor.

I began to sob, laughing all the while

The most vicious thing winter’s mistress– No. that damned creature, had done was leaving me alive to witness my massacre, not killing me in ignorance. Maybe I should do it myself after I put down the pen.

“*I intend to detail this log as a last service to the company and to humanity, so this mission is not clouded in secrecy, speculated on, then green lit once more for  fresh victims to embark on.*”

I concluded, having detailed everything I could on some wayward tablet which I had clearance for, before tossing it aside.

With a sigh, I realized my mask of temperance had begun to slip. I was going to come to terms with myself, whether I liked it or not. 

I rubbed my thumb over the frame I had grabbed. 

“Don’t keep your mother worrying! My fav picture of you ;) XOXOXO!” 

My tears fell over the childhood photo, of who I would never know, as my face had been plastered over his.
