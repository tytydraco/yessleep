My story is a strange one. Most people don't belive me when I talk about it, yet the fact I am alive and here to tell the tale at all is incredible.

It's a rather long story, so I'll break it up and upload it into segments over the next few days to make it easier to read. This is how I survived being stranded on Crescent Moon island.


It was a hot summer day when my grandfather died, leaving behind a small, tightly knit family to mourn his passing. After dividing his assets between everyone, I ended up receiving a small chunk of money. I didn't really think much about the inheritance during those dreary weeks following his funeral, because everything seemed like a blur.

Sitting alone at the table one autumn morning, I got a phone call from my boss back at the shipping station:

“We've gotten word from upper management that it's time to scale back operations, which means layoffs. Since you've been out for a while on personal grievance time, they picked you to get canned. Sorry, Ethan.”

My wife overheard the phone call as she walked into the kitchen, expecting breakfast. Our baby was due in just a month and I could tell that just walking over and taking a seat at the table left her exhausted. She raised her brow and cast a worried look in my direction.

“Well, it's a good thing you got that inheritance money. Hopefully it can keep us afloat until you find a new job.”

“Yeah, I'll hop on the laptop and browse job postings later today,” I replied, a sinking feeling in my chest. My mind couldn't stop nagging about how awful of a husband and father I was for choosing work over spending time at home when our baby would be born. The mortgage wasn't going to pay itself, however, and I didn't have any family leave options with my job at the shipping station terminated.

Cooking up a quick batch of sunny-side up eggs, I sat down with my laptop and scoured for job listings. One post I came across sounded very promising. Too good to be true, in fact.

*Clean up crew wanted, will require operating a boat and box truck which will be provided. Compensation starts at $100 an hour. Expect to work 10 hour shifts until the clean up site is completed.*

I couldn't believe it, one thousand dollars a day just to perform clean up duties? Without hesitation, I applied and continued looking for jobs, not expecting to hear back from anyone in particular. To my surprise, I got a phone call before I was even done browsing on my laptop.

“Hello?”

“Yes, is this Ethan?”

Something about his voice sounded familiar. Thick rasp of old age was hiding hints of a southern accent. During the fleeting moments of pause between speech, I could make out a faint sound in the background. It sounded like tides coming in over a shoal of rocks.

“Yes, this is Ethan speaking.”

“I noticed y’all applied for the clean up crew on my web postin’, although you're a bit far away according to the address you provided. We'll be over on the coastline, clear across the mountain range. Would you still be interested?”

“Yes, of course!” I said, standing from my chair in excitement. Glancing at my wife, I noticed a soft smile growing on her face.

“Excellent, how about I meet you here on Friday, then? That'll give y’all some time for that 3 hour drive!”

“I appreciate that, thank you! Just one question, how many days do you think I'll be working?”

“Oh, it depends on how much you'd be willin’ to hustle, but I'd say about a week. I'll email y’all the address and additional details later.”

“Okay, thank you so much! By the way, I didn't catch your name?”

Seconds passed in an uncomfortably long hesitation, the sound of receding waves holding back total silence. Finally, the man cleared his throat and gave a vague answer:

“Just call me cap’n, alright?”

“Cap’n? Like… Captain?”

“Yeah, that'll do son. Well, I got business to tend to, but I'll shoot you that email real soon, take care now.”

Without further delay, he ended the call and left me with more questions than answers. Facing my wife, I took a seat and gave her a coy grin.

“You got the job?”

“Yeah, it's just temporary but pays really well. Enough to cover a few months of our bills, in fact. I'll need to travel to the coast, though. Wanna tag along? I'll probably be staying in a hotel while I'm down there.”

Her smile dissolved into a frown as she looked away. I couldn't expect her to endure such a long road trip and time away from home, not when our baby was due so soon.

“I think I'll stay here, maybe ask Maddie to keep me company while you're gone. You'll be back before the baby comes, right?”

“Yeah, he said it's only going to be a one week job. Guess what, though? It pays $100 an hour.”

Her jaw dropped as her face lit up. Standing from her chair, she enveloped me in a tight hug with surprising strength. I reciprocated the embrace and patted her back, thinking we'd be okay, if just for a little while longer.

Friday came with blistering speed and before I knew it, I was driving my crappy 20-year-old car up through the mountains. Winding roads of evergreen forest eventually subsided as the bright blue horizon of the ocean came into view. The address provided in the email took me down a quiet dirt road which ran along coastal cliffs, with towering pines growing right along the bank and keeping erosion at bay.

Completing the long drive, I arrived at a run-down dock nestled in a small cove where the cliffs receded into a sandy inlet. An old boat floated next to the dock, just a few hundred feet away from an equally old box truck parked near a run down shack. Stepping out to stretch, I savored the crisp, salty sea air and began a slow walk towards the sea. A faint silhouette of an island hung in the distance, rendered barely visible through the mirage of shifting blue waves and sky.

A creak caught my attention and I turned to the shack, where an old man hobbled through the doorway. Dressed like a modern day sailor, the man sported a wooden cane and limped over, seemingly unable to put any weight on his right foot. He wore a gold chained necklace with an upside down cross ornament dangling from the chain. Catching his bright blue eyes hiding behind puffy, wrinkled cheeks, I straightened my posture and smiled.

“Captain?”

“That’d be correct, how was the drive, son?”

“Not bad, I enjoyed the scenery actually.”

Slicking back what remained of his thinning snow-white hair, he reached into his pocket and casually pulled out a thick wad of cash. He offered it with all the eagerness of paying off a lifelong debt.

“Here's advanced payment for yer first day, son. I can already tell you got the spunk needed for this kinda work.”

Reluctantly, I accepted the cash and counted it. One grand, paid out in fresh Benjamins.

“So, does that mean I'm on the clock right now?”

“Clock? Bah, this is under the table work, son. I'm not keepin’ track of shit, so long as we get everything cleaned up!”

Looking around the property, I couldn't make out any real mess that needed to be cleaned. Stuffing the money wad into my wallet, I chuckled and shook my head.

“Looks like a pretty clean job site, what exactly did you need me to do, captain?”

“Oh, this ain't the clean up site, son. That over there is!”

Leaning on his cane for support, he pointed off to the distant island. A gentle breeze swept over the cove as we both stood there, staring out at the vague outline in a vast backdrop of endless blue.

“Ah, offshore work? I guess that explains the decent pay.”

Shooting a cheesy grin, I could tell the joke didn't land. His cracking dry lips thinned as he pivoted to look my way.

“Well, son, here's the deal. My father operated a lighthouse out that way, stayed in it for many years helping along cargo ships on dark, stormy nights. Of course, ships nowadays run off these fancy GPS satellites, so they don't need lighthouses anymore. That place out there is known as Crescent Moon island, a tiny raft of land sportin’ its own pine forest. I plan on cleanin’ that island up and turnin’ it into a private resort. Yer job, son, is to clean out all the junk in and around the lighthouse on that there island.”

“Alright, that doesn't sound too bad.”

“Well, when you get there you'll see it'll take some work. My father wasn't exactly a tidy man, I'll say. Anywho, we're gettin’ hung up on small details. Yer gonna use that boat there to haul back loads of junk and stuff it into that box truck. I'll then drive the junk down to the nearest dump. Clear?”

“Yes, I understand. Anything I should know about that might be important to the job?”

Gazing down, the man wrapped both hands around his cane and slowly shook his head.

“Just two things, really. Don't load that boat up more than a ton at a time. In her prime she could haul double that, these days she struggles to cut through the wakes on a frosty morning.”

“Okay, and the second thing?” I asked, following a few second pause. His eyes narrowed, lips thinning again as he craned his head ever so slightly towards the ocean.

“This’ll sound odd, son, but take this rule seriously, you hear? On the top floor of that lighthouse, there's an old red landline phone. If you hear it ring, don't pick it up. It shouldn't be ringin’ anyway, seein’ as there's no damn land to connect the line.”

Pivoting back to the shack, the man hobbled away, refusing to elaborate any further on the strange rule. Not thinking much about it, I got my things ready and boarded the boat, setting a course for the lighthouse.

Cool ocean air ran through my hair as I sailed the boat a good few miles out into the water. Crescent Moon island rose from the waves, appearing as a miniature mountain complete with a forest of evergreens and jagged cliffs. Approaching the lone dock resting along a rocky shore line, I parked the boat and hopped off, taking a long hard look at my surroundings.

A small footpath connected to the dock, winding up a steep embankment surrounded by massive pines towering into the sky. Thick clusters of weeds and overgrowth choked the ground, only receding by the sandy shore and barely maintained footpath. Shafts of sunlight seeped through the branches on the trail ahead, illuminating the path forward with mesmerizing dapples of light. Taking in a deep breath, I began my ascent up the embankment.

Unlike the forested region which covered the mountain range I drove across, this island's forest remained eerily quiet… devoid of any bird songs or rustling squirrels one might expect. An occasional hum of wind sounded through the trees, lifting the salty aroma of sea air up the embankment and further inland. After just five minutes of hiking, I reached the crest of the island's terrain, where the forest thinned out and gave way to the lighthouse sitting along the edge of a cliff overlooking the sea. From the vantage point upon the crest, I could see the crescent shape of the island which gave its namesake. Taking out my phone to snap a picture, I was surprised to see I still had cellular connection.

Towering into the sky, the lighthouse stood taller than any tree and appeared weathered with cracking gray stone. Old boxes and random pieces of gardening equipment lay strewn around the area surrounding the lighthouse, along with a few busted stone statues and a large wheelbarrow. I grumbled, irritated at the thought of making hundreds of return trips up and down the embankment with a wheelbarrow full of junk.

I decided to scout out the lighthouse before getting to work on the stuff outside. Approaching the arch-shaped wooden door, I looked through the tiny square window built into the rotting wood, which had a row of rusting iron bars keeping anyone from reaching down inside. It was far too dark to see, so I turned the knob and swung the door open on its noisy hinges. A thick blanket of dust kicked up off the stone floor, swirling around in the light now pouring into the room.

The first floor of the lighthouse reminded me of a scene from a cozy medieval cottage. An old hearth sat along the far wall, containing a black iron stew pot on a cooking rack. A single rocking chair faced the hearth, sitting on an old crochet carpet which dominated more than half of the stone floor. On the wall to my right, there was a large bookcase full of leather bound books, with wooden shelves that contained old, half melted candles. A small table sat by the only window on the left wall, which blocked all sunlight with a thick curtain. Stacks of crates were lined up along the wall next to me, filled with old linen and other random nicknacks.

Pulling the curtain open, I could see the room much better with abundant sunlight. An old ladder ascending to the upper floors waited by the bookcase. Behind the ladder, a small passage opened up to a tiny space where a rusted toilet sat. Looking at the setup, I realized any junk on the upper floors would have to be dropped down the ladder shaft, likely breaking it and making my job just a little bit harder. Shrugging off the thought, I approached the ladder and tested the old wood by pulling on it. Satisfied it wouldn't break midway up the shaft, I climbed up the steps and felt the air get colder on the second floor.

Without getting off the ladder, I took in a brief glance of the second floor. A series of open windows without any glass circled the stone walls around the cramped space, offering an explanation on why the room felt so cold. Curiously, the only thing on this floor I'd have to get rid of was a small table and chair. A thick diary sat on the table, sprawled halfway open with an ink and quill pen nearby.

Ascending to the third floor, the space grew even tighter. A small bed with stained blankets occupied most of the floor space, with a dresser and tiny window looking out into the open ocean. A small globe and telescope sat on the dresser, with a broken device I recognize as a miniature sextant leaning against the headboard of the bed.

Arriving at the fourth and final floor, I spun around on the ladder and observed the small chamber where the main clockwork control for the lighthouse beacon rested. To my surprise, this room appeared more modern, with electric cables running across the wall and even several power outlets. My eyes fell upon a red landline phone, perched on a desk along the far wall. A single light bulb hung suspended from the ceiling over the desk, caked in yellow grime. On the wall behind the desk was an upside down cross.

Just as I turned to descend down the ladder, a shrill ringing echoed through the building. It was the red landline phone, the one I was told not to answer by the old man. Frozen on the ladder, I watched the phone as it continued to ring several more times before going quiet. Left in disbelief, I stood on the ladder a few more seconds, wondering how exactly this island had power and a working landline connection. I hummed in curiosity, shrugging off the thought and looking on the bright side of things. At least I could use the outlets to charge my phone.

Heading outside, I began working on the clean up by tossing chunks of the broken statues into the wheelbarrow. After several trips back and forth from the boat, the old statues were cleared off the property. Returning from my last run, a faint noise drew my attention to the lighthouse. That same shrill ring tone echoed from the top floor, a mere whisper from outside. For a while, I ignored it as I gathered the old garden tools into the wheelbarrow. After what must have been a solid 15 minutes of nonstop ringing emanating from the building, I decided enough was enough. That old man had to be pranking me, I thought. Who else would have the number for some remote lighthouse on an island in the middle of nowhere?

Ascending the ladder back to the top floor, I marched over to the still ringing phone and answered it. For a moment, silence hung on the line after I said hello. A sickly wet sound broke that silence… a sound I could only describe as someone dragging a sack of viscous slime across their face as they made mouth noises. I almost jumped when a dial tone interrupted the call, indicating the connection had abruptly ended. Unsettled, I set the phone back on the receiver and made my way back down.

A dense blanket of fog greeted me outside the lighthouse when I stepped out. The drastic change of weather I could not explain, how such a warm sunny day could so quickly be replaced with a cold haze. I could barely see five feet ahead. Taking out my phone to check the weather, I sighed in frustration when an offline symbol indicated I was no longer getting a cell connection. Ready to take a break from the now dreary island, I felt my way around the fog until I found the wheelbarrow and began pushing it down hill.

Five minutes elapsed and I still found myself hiking down the steep trail. After ten minutes of pushing the wheelbarrow downhill, I knew something was wrong. It didn't take that long to get back to the boat, I must have taken a wrong turn in the fog. Backtracking up the hill, I was bewildered when I returned to the lighthouse property after just a few minutes of walking. My mind wrestled with what was going on, did I seriously walk around in circles on the trail for 15 minutes without realizing?

Leaving the wheelbarrow behind, I tried walking down the hill again. After more than ten minutes, I broke out into a full sprint, desperate to find my way back to the dock. Everything looked similar in the choking fog… every tree, branch and rock seemed copy and pasted over and over again. Turning to walk back uphill, it again only took a few minutes to return to the lighthouse.

Turning around, I saw something that almost stopped my heart cold: dozens, maybe a hundred silhouettes in the fog of floating heads without a body. Bobbing up and down, some appeared to smile with twisted, gnarled and toothy grins. Many distant voices laughed hysterically, sounding too high-pitched to be human. All at once, the drifting heads backed off and disappeared into the fog, silencing the laughter as they went.

Panicking, I took out my phone and began to text my wife and call people I knew. I even tried calling 911 at some point, but every call resulted in the same error dial tone and no text would go through. At that moment, I realized the gravity of the situation…

I was somehow trapped on Crescent Moon island.
