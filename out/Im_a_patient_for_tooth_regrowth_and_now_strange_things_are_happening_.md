Hi, long time lurker, first time poster. 

So it's like the title says...I'm a patient for tooth regrowth and now strange things are happening... 

So we'll start out on like this... I had a child young and couldn't afford much, including dental care, so my teeth suffered. I also had a lot of ear infections as a kid, which they say affects the teeth. 

Anyway, by 38 (2 years ago) they told me I was going to be better off removing my teeth and getting dentures. I'd had filling after filling. I could only get silver as I was allergic to the porcelain. I often had root canal like pain for no reason. Then my front teeth started rotting from all the pop I drank later in life. It was just inevitable. 

I'm 40. I hate not having teeth. But for the life of me, I can't seem to adjust to the dentures. They gag me in the back, my food just sticks to them and I can't really eat with them, so I eat without my teeth. It's much less embarrassing to eat without them, than it is too gag in the middle of eating and have to chuck them out of my mouth with food. 

I am also single and a female. Not having teeth really affects my self-esteem, but I feel more comfortable eating without them because of how they fit. So that's what I do. 

Then I read an article. Last month I want to say, maybe 2 months ago. Dentists in Japan have learned how to regrow teeth. They were starting with men and children for their studies. 

It consisted of using stem cells somehow to regrow the teeth. 

I was so excited! This ment maybe I could have my real teeth back! The article said in just a few years! 

I got a phone call from my health insurance a couple weeks ago, asking if I had any unmet needs. I, of course mentioned the dentures. They offered me a spot as one of the first female test subjects! I was even more excited! 

So they gave me the address of the closest study, and gave me a date. 

Last week I had to go fill out some paperwork and go over test rules. Just your general stuff I assume, though to be honest I didn't really read it. I was just too excited to get my teeth back at this point. 

I came home 2 days ago after getting my first injection of the stem cells that are supposed to regrow my teeth, and feed my cats (I have 2...one a year old, and one kitten I just got last week) 

I sat down to watch ancient aliens (you know the alien guy with the hair) and all was well. I munched on some fast food I brought home, then went to bed around 2:30 or so. 

I woke up at 8 to my kitten missing and my apartment having a blood trail. I don't know what's going on. 

My other cat is still getting used to her, but has never thrown paws like THAT! 

Then this morning, I woke up to my other cat being gone, and even more blood. I can't find anything. I would think I'd be able to find either of them somewhere, but I can't. 

I don't have a raised bed, so they can't be under that. I've already checked behind the couch, and tv stand. Only one can climb up on top of the cabinets and bookshelf. She's not there. 

It's like they vanished. 

I'm afraid the shots the gave me to regrow my teeth gave me some kind of side effects.... Help!

Also apologies if there are any mistakes, my nails have grown 2 inches overnight. I tried cutting them, but the clippers broke. So I'm trying to get used to them.

I greatly appreciate any help anyone can give.
