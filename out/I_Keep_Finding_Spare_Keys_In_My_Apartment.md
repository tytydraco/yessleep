It started the day I moved in. The lady from the property management company (it was always a lady) brought me into the place and handed me two keys. They were for the front door, both the deadbolt and knob locks. I thanked her, and we shook hands. I went through the place with a fine tooth comb, taking pictures of any pre-existing damage.

As I surveyed the living room, I saw an object lying underneath one of the baseboard heaters. Upon closer inspection, I realized it was a key. It was coated with dust and a thin layer of grime. I washed it off in the sink and considered what it could be for. The first thing that came to mind was the front door, so I started there.

It worked. On both the deadbolt and door knob, it worked.

I called my property manager to explain the situation, and (to my surprise) they were cool about it. They had to replace a key when the previous tenant lost one, and assumed this was the one I’d found. They marked my apartment down as having three keys instead of just two, and told me to make sure I left all three in the unit when I moved out. This seemed fair to me, and for a while, that was the end of it.

A few months into my lease, however, I found another. It was under the kitchen sink, deep in the far right corner of the cabinet. I had slid some paper towels under there and felt the key slide back until it hit the wall. I pulled out the paper towels and looked inside with my phone’s flashlight. Sure enough, there it was. It was in similar condition to the first, caked with dust and grime. This was the first time I performed the ritual of find key, try key. Of course, it worked in both locks on my front door. This was on a Saturday and my landlord’s office wouldn’t open until Monday. So I placed the key on the counter and went about my weekend.

When I called on Monday, they actually sent someone out to collect and verify it.

“Well, this is a pickle,” the lady said, holding both keys in her palm. “The last time this unit had to replace a key, before recently, was eight years ago.”

“It *was* under the sink,” I said. “It’s possible nobody noticed it until now.”

“True, but I wonder how it got down there in the first place.”

That was something I hadn’t considered. The first had been in the living room under the heater. It made sense that someone could have dropped and left it there. It made less sense that another ended up *under* the kitchen sink.

“I’ll leave this one with you,” she said, handing me the first key I’d found. “This one I’ll take back to the office.” She placed the key into her purse before wishing me a good day and leaving.

In the months that followed, I found more and more keys. At their request, I stopped calling my landlord. I was told to collect any keys I found and keep them safe until I moved out. They would dispose of them after I was gone.

Now, the last thing I want to do is piss off my landlord, so I’m turning to Reddit. I gotta tell somebody about this because it’s getting out of hand. They’re everywhere. In my shower, on my desk, even in my goddamn microwave. That last one I only found because it started sparking when I tried heating up a bowl of soup. And now they’re appearing in... aggressive ways. One was stabbed through the center of my TV like a fucking railway spike. Another was in my garbage disposal, which demolished it the second I turned it on. I found them lodged in the windows, the patio door, the bathroom mirror (more than once), and even in one of my car’s tires. 

I was at a loss for what to do. The property management was unresponsive to my calls and emails on the matter, and were quick to tell me that this wouldn’t get me out of my lease early. I’d still have to pay out or find someone to take it over. So, despite everything that had happened to me, I decided to grin and bear it for the remaining three months of my lease.

Then came a turning point. Not too long after I moved in, I adopted a black cat who I named Mystic. She’s a great roommate (even if she scratches my couch and her poops are nuclear when she doesn’t bury them). She’s very cuddly though and always greets me at the door with a little *mrrp* when I get home from work or leave my bedroom in the morning.

So when I left my bedroom last week and she didn’t greet me, I tensed up. Looking down the hallway, I noticed speckles of a dark liquid on the floor leading into the living room. My heart sank as I bolted down the hall and found her there, lying on her side in the middle of the room. She was breathing hard and there was a key stabbed into her hind right leg.

Everything was a blur after that. I know I scooped her up, felt the dried blood on her black fur, and rushed to the nearest vet. Thankfully, they removed the key and stitched up the wound no problem. Afterwards, they hesitated to send her home with me, thinking I’d done this to her. But when they saw how badly she wanted to be near me the second she woke up, the hesitation vanished. I was thankful for that, but didn’t want to bring Mystic back to my apartment. So I took her to my mom’s to stay for a bit while I figured things out.

My plan had been to research my apartment building and see if anything like this had ever been reported to the authorities or talked about online. I didn’t get very far, though, because this morning I woke up to find a key in bed with me. It was lying near my right calf with the tip pointed towards me. The message was clear enough. I wasn’t sure if I’d provoked it (whatever “it” is) by digging into its past or if it just wanted to hurt me. I’m not even sure if there is an “it” in this situation. Regardless, after that experience, I headed to a hotel. I booked two nights and am spending the first by writing this post.

My plan now is to go to the apartment in the daylight tomorrow and grab some more stuff, including the sandwich bag I’ve kept the keys in and a copy of my lease. I also want to count the keys. It’s something I’ve put off far too long. I doubt it’ll do any good, but it’ll satiate my curiosity if nothing else.
