We hiked up the so-called “Haunted Hill,” hoping to make it to the top before midnight. The story went that you went up the hill, read out loud the gravestone of Josef Whitaker, and the haunting would begin. To make it more fun, you’d do it with a group of friends and then try to guess who got the haunting, curse, or whatever it was. The small cul-de-sac at the bottom of the hill was filled with abandoned cars and trash, which led me to believe it was more of a dumpsite for the locals more than anything else. Maybe the story was made up so kids wouldn’t go around playing in the trash and cut themselves on rusted metal - the true horror.



Why the story had held up was because of the myriad of hauntings that were bestowed upon Haunted Hill, the place seemingly having a never-ending supply of hauntings and curses to throw at its visitors. We were of course keen to find out if there even was the gravestone of a certain Mr. Whitaker up there, let alone a curse. The real curse seemed to be how damn difficult it was to climb up the hill, which was quite honestly a dangerous hike, especially in the dark. 



We joked our way up, the moon playing hide and seek with the clouds above us until finally there was nothing more to climb. We’d made it, and immediately we slumped down to the rock beneath us and took out our water bottles. 



“I don’t see nothing,” said Reg.



“No shit, we literally just came up. Let’s have a drink and then look around with flashlights, eh?” replied Liam.



Reg was the tenured doofus of our group. Don’t get me wrong, he was actually quite smart, but sometimes he’d just say the most *obvious* things. It’s like his mind sometimes clocked out, letting the lizard-brain take over.



“Well thank fuck I at least brought an *actual* flashlight,” Reg said, taking it out of his backpack. (See? I said he was smart. Sometimes.)



And he was right. We’d all just brought our phones, putting way too much hope in the camera’s makeshift light which could barely light the ground beneath our feet. Turning on his fancy, battery-powered flashlight, Reg pointed the bright beam straight at Liam’s face, laughing as he blinded him.



“Cut it off, shithead.”



Reg began to tap on the on-button, making the light flash in and out of existence like a strobe.



“Make me,” he said.



Liam threw a small rock at Reg. He responded by turning off the light.



“Flashlight access is henceforth denied for Liam, our brave canadian. The rest of you can still receive my luscious photons.”



The rest of us laughed. 



\-\*-



We gathered our strength for a bit before heading out to explore the rest of the hilltop. We split up, each of us pointing the weak light of our phones in different directions.



It was no surprise that Reg was the one to find the gravestone. He yelled at us to come look, and we gathered around the crumbling piece of rock that faintly resembled its intended form. I think we were all surprised that it actually existed, and also for the fact that it did say *Josef Whitaker* where Reg’s flashlight was pointing. Had someone actually buried this odd, nobody of a man here, or just brought up the gravestone to fuck with people? Seemed like an awful lot of work either way.



“So, who’s gonna read the poem?” Reg said.



“The poem?” I replied.



Reg moved the flashlight below Josef’s name. Engraved with old lettering were the words:



*On the hill where shadows play,*

*The winds dance at close of day,*

*A trickster’s laugh, a haunting sound,*

***Turning all things the wrong way round.***



Nobody volunteered for the recital. Not yet.



Nobody said anything, actually, until finally Liam blurted out “Well, I can’t do it. Reg is pointing his fancypants-flashlight on it, and as per his previous email, I’m still locked out of those photons.”



“Well phone it up, son,” Reg said, clicking the flashlight off. The silhouette of the gravestone flashed in a phantom on my corneas, sliding slowly out of view as my eyes adjusted to the darkness. 



“Don’t mind if I do,” Liam said and turned on the light of his phone. 



He looked around at us in turn, then pointed the light under his chin, giving his face a grade-school-halloween makeover.



“Y’all boys ready for the monster of Haunted Hill?”



Reg said “Aye-aye,” but the rest of us - me, Noah, and Amos -  just nodded, deciding not to indulge any more joking. And so Liam recited the poem with a half-funny, half-awkward sort of timbre.



After he finished, Reg started to laugh.



“Haw-haw, Mr. Trickster,” said Amos, while the rest of us chuckled politely. 



But Reg just kept going and going, his laugh beginning to battle with each breath that he took. “We get it, Reg. The bit was half-baked at best, so you can stop now,” Liam said.



Reg didn’t stop. Tears began to well in the corners of his eyes as he laughed. I could sense a panic settling in, his eyes darting around wildly.



“You alright?” I asked him.



“He’s just trying to spook us,” Noah said. 



“No, no. I think he’s having some sort of seizure,” I said, walking up to Reg and pointing my phone’s light closer to his face. 



His eyes were wide with fear, and his forehead was dripping with sweat. He blinked once, but it was a slow, difficult movement, like he was stretching a muscle. The rest of the boys gathered around me and looked at Reg’s face. 



“Fuck,” Noah said. “I think he’s having a stroke. Can someone call an ambulance?”



“How the fuck are we going to get an ambulance up here?” Liam replied. “You better quit it, Reg, or you’ll have to explain to them why they came all the way out here for nothing.”



I was trying to keep myself cool, but I could feel the palms of my hands starting to sweat. “Just fucking do it, Liam. We’ll take Reg back down and the ambulance can meet us there.”



Something was wrong with Reg, and it was going to be difficult to get him help, but we had to try. Thankfully Liam stopped fucking around and dialed 911. Reg had sat down. His laugh was beginning to really steal his breath now. He was trying to keep his hands from shaking by keeping them in tight fists. 



“We need to do something,” Amos said over Liam cursing at the operator on the phone. “Before the ambulance gets here, y’know.”



Fear had quickly taken us over, and we all sort of grunted and said *yeah* and moved around a bit, all without actually accomplishing anything. We didn’t know *what* to do, and that was a problem. My temples felt hot as I tried to think and clear my head.



First thing was trying to get Reg’s breathing under control. I kneeled in front of him, and he looked up at me. I’d never seen fear like that in my life - his eyes bloodshot and swollen, his lips drooling with saliva, and that laugh echoing like the devil’s rain in my ears. 



“Hey buddy, we need to get your breathing under control,” I said. “Can you try and slow down? Count slowly as you breathe in and out?”



Reg simply shook his head, his eyes darting around to look at the others. With great exertion, and each word bookended by a few seconds of laughing, he fumbled out the words “Am… I… dying?”



I took his face into my hands and told him “No. You’re **not** gonna die. Whatever this is, we’ll figure it out.” I could feel the muscles in his face cramping like twisting snakes. 



“M-Maybe it’s the curse,” Noah said. He was the most superstitious one of us. Upon hearing this, Liam, who’d walked a bit of a way’s off to talk to the emergency operator, stomped his way to Noah. 



He got close enough for the spit to drench his face when he said “It’s. Not. A. Fucking. *CURSE!*  Jesus, Noah. At least *try* to do something.”



Noah looked like he was seriously contemplating just running off the cliff and tumbling his way down. I walked up and put my hand on Liam’s shoulder to divert his attention. “Is the ambulance coming? They got the address?”



“Yeah, yeah. I had to explain the route to them a billion fucking times, but they’re coming.”The tension turned to confusion and fright when Reg stood up. We all turned to look at him, trying not to stare at his laughing face as if there was something awkward about it, like staring at someone’s birthmark. 



Suddenly the laughter stopped, but the grin remained.



“Did you like my trick?” he said. 



Silence fell as none of us had an answer to give. *Was he seriously just fucking with us?*



Just as Liam looked like he was about to open his mouth, the grin snapped half an inch wider, tearing the edges of Reg’s mouth open. “Would you like to see another?”



I knew it wasn’t a real question, but I still think about if there was some answer that could’ve stopped it all from happening. 



The edges of Reg’s mouth made a violent *snap*, leaving his cheeks in two fleshy pieces that flopped against his chin. Taking one of them into his hand, Reg began to carefully pull the skin away from the fat and muscle, tearing it all the way to the back of his neck. He repeated the gesture on the other side. His flesh glistened in the moonlight, red and sparkly from the fresh blood. 



He then moved on to the skin left above his cheeks, pulling it up from both sides until his face - the skin-mask that we knew as Reg - was removed. He continued on, pulling the skin off his scalp, his oily hair made darker by the blood. He pulled and pulled until the skin connected to the pieces torn off from his cheeks. 



Someone fainted or sat down with a thump. I think it was Noah. the rest of us simply stared, forced into shock by the act and the quickness in which it had happened. Nobody tried to help Noah, not even me. Nobody helped Reg. It was as if the situation we had found ourselves in was already so horrible and cruel and nightmarish, that a little bit more wouldn’t hurt. Like we needed to just see where it was going before we could find our way back to ourselves, to the part that says *do this* and *don’t do that*.



Reg kept smiling, his teeth and eyeballs white against the intertwining clumps of flesh and tendons. He turned his head to look at each of us in turn, and when his gaze landed on me, I could feel that whatever was looking at me - maybe it was in the eyes - wasn’t Reg anymore. Something had taken over. How long had he been gone? Was it when the laughing started? *Could we have stopped it, instead of trying to call a fucking ambulance?*



A sloshing sound came from Reg’s mouth, and he opened it up, letting bits of chewed up flesh fall to the ground with a wet slap. His breath became ragged, probably from all the blood flowing down into his lungs. 



He then moved his arms behind his head until the bones cracked and tendons popped, grabbing the shawl of skin hanging by his neck. Through a chorus of awful sounds that came from torn ligaments and squeezed soft tissue, he somehow pulled the skin all the way down to his waist. With a snap, he did the exact same thing to the flaps of skin that used to be his cheeks and upper neck. 



I regained some control over myself, and began to move back from Reg slowly, hoping that the others would catch on. Whatever this thing was, we needed to get away from it.



Like a clown or perhaps a mime, he smiled and cocked his head. As if he was taking off his pants, he pulled the skin off his lower body in a ragged, awkward movement, throwing the bloodied suit of skin on the ground next to him. 



I was two steps farther than the others, and when Reg locked eyes with me, I knew I’d been found. He lifted up a finger, swiveling the bony thing from side to side. *Scolding me.* 



Surely I was going to die. It - Reg - or whatever this fucking thing was was going to do the exact same thing to me. I was sure of it. But he didn’t. Instead he made an ‘*o’* with his mouth and brought his hand to cover it up, then brought it back down revealing a sly grin. The act seemed almost childish in a creepy way, like an adult acting *naughty*.



With overexaggerated steps and a swooping of the arms, he picked up the sack of skin from where he’d thrown it. While slightly bended down, he turned his head from skin to me to skin to the others back to the skin, then nodded like a broadway actor and began to pull the ragged and torn skin back on like a pair of pants. 



Except that he put it on the wrong way around. 



As he stretched and toyed with the skin, it was hard to see what used to be Reg as anything human. It wasn’t just the blood and the flesh and the bones, but also the fact that any person who’d gone through all that would’ve been long dead. It was like the body was being puppeted by something else.



The thing sort of got the skin back on, but it was torn and stretched in parts to give the appearance of a patchwork quilt. Once it was all done, he looked at us with a smile and bowed like a 19th century gentleman. 



It was only then, as the show finished, that I realized how far out I had stretched my consciousness. My experience of the whole thing. I couldn’t feel anything, couldn’t hear anything, could barely take in what it was that I was seeing. The realization pushed my cortisol levels up and pulled my mind back to its place, and the first thing I realized was that Noah was screaming. How long had he been screaming for, I had no idea. 



Curses and pleas weaved themselves between boyish shrieks, and for some reason I was surprised that Noah wasn’t calling for his mommy. 



“Noah, Noah! Hey, what’s going on? Calm down, okay? Calm down,” I blubbered on as I walked up to him. I had to help him even if it meant turning my back to that wretched thing that used to be Reg. Noah was inconsolable, crying like he was in a nightmare that he was simply brute-forcing his way out of. No such luck. 



I took him by the shoulders and tried to make him look at me. “Calm down, Noah. It’s gonna be alright.”



He shook his head, and the words *no, no, nonoNO* fluttered out of his mouth. “You need to breathe. Just breathe, okay. In and out,” I told him.



“NO!” he yelled, tearing my hands off him. I noticed his eyes were fixated on the sky. “Look!”



I turned to see what he was looking at, and for a moment I couldn’t understand what he was talking about. The sky was dark as it had been, faintly illuminated by the… the moon. The moon, which was replaced by a soaring, evil dark sun that licked the sky with black rays like tentacles.



It wanted me to stare at it, my corneas begging for a taste. I had to force myself to look away, to keep myself steady. To keep myself from going insane. I decided to check up on everyone else to keep myself busy.



Amos and Liam were slack jawed, staring up at the black sun. I tried shaking them, slapping them, even knocking them down, but they wriggled their way free, like they were in a trance. Noah had stopped screaming, I realized, and the hilltop was eerily quiet. I felt like I had no more strength. Nothing more to give. Nothing I could do to solve anything.



“Isn’t it beautiful?” said the thing behind me.



I turned to face it, and its eyes were gone, poked out and seeping something like mucus down its face and between the folds of inverted skin. 



Anger swelled up inside of me, wrestling away the fear.I had to say something, Do something. Tell it to go fuck itself, to curse this place harder than it was cursed already. Even if it killed me, I would haunt the haunter until it was burnt ash or whatever the equivalent of that would be on the other side. 



As I opened my mouth, fear locked my voice into a whine, and all that came out was a pitiful “Please stop.”



“*I will*,” it said, “here on *Haunted Hill!* What a delightful *rhyme*, and you, rotten apples to the *swine*.”



“Wha… what?”



“***What*** is the predecessor to when and why, but for those I must leave you to cry. ***When*** is the one that has an answer, for you are the wind, the key, the *dancer*!”



Everything was going dark. The black sun was encroaching on the world, taking over the sky and sending shooting, cold pain to my limbs. There was nothing more I wanted to say. I accepted death, and I’d find a way to avenge it. If not for myself then for the others. 



The world became a shadow upon itself, and I could no longer see. And for an indeterminate amount of time I floated, not knowing, not feeling. 

At some point, a small ripple of light poked through and it grew and it grew until it was a blinding light and I could feel my eyes again, which I immediately closed, my eyelids burning. 



When I opened them again, I saw that I was back on Haunted Hill. Everyone else was gone. Noah, Liam, Amos. Reg.



\-\*-



I made my way down slowly, leaving Reg’s car behind and taking my own back to town. I called the others in as missing, but when I mentioned *Haunted Hill,* the police seemed incredulous. They did write down the report, and promised to go take a look, but I’m not sure if much will come of it. 



I hope writing this out will take away the sun that still sometimes shines black and cold. I don’t know if I seek to avenge my friends anymore. I don’t have that anger in me. All I have is a fear that pushes and pushes, trying to find anything to take me away from it all. To try and move on.
