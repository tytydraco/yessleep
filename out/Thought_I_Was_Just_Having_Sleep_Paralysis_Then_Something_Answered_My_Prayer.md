The first time I had sleep paralysis, I was terrified. I couldn’t move, couldn’t speak... just trapped inside my own body. But I started praying. Not out loud, just in my mind. Over and over.

And then, I woke up.

So that became my ritual. Every time it happened, I’d pray. And it always worked. No matter how dark it got, no matter what I saw in the corners, I prayed, and I came back.

Until last week.

Last week, I prayed… and something prayed back.

It started normal. Heavy pressure on my chest, that thick electric feeling in the air. But this time, the room felt colder. Not just chilly, wrong. Like the air didn’t belong to me anymore.

So I did what I always do. I started praying.

Only… I didn’t feel like I was alone in it. The words were still in my mind, but it was like someone else was inside them. Echoing them back. Not copying… answering.

I said, “Father, protect me,”
and I heard: “I already am.”

But the voice wasn’t right.

It sounded like a whisper through gravel. Like someone had learned to mimic what comfort should feel like, but didn’t really understand it.

Then it leaned closer, this shadow with a mouth, and said:

“You only wake up because I let you.”

I tried to change the prayer. I switched to something I knew only I would say, my grandmother’s old bedtime blessing. I hadn’t heard it since I was a kid. But halfway through, the voice interrupted me.

“You said that when you were seven. You cried after.”

That’s when I realized... this thing hadn’t just been watching me. It had been with me. All those times I thought I was alone, whispering to God through fear and clenched teeth, something else had been listening. Learning.

And that’s when I remembered her.

It happened a few years ago. I had just fallen asleep, barely under when I felt it. Not the paralysis, not the fear... her. Standing at the foot of my bed.

I hadn’t seen her before, but I knew she was there. The air shifted. My skin prickled. She didn’t speak the first time, just watched. I told myself it was a dream, even after she came back the next night. And the next.

The last time I saw her, she said something low and urgent.

“He’s waking up.”

I thought it was nonsense. Some sleep-delirious fragment. But now? Now I wonder if she wasn’t part of the fear, but a warning.


---

I woke up like nothing happened.

Except now, every night, I feel it waiting. I go to bed exhausted and terrified. I don’t even know if I’m actually asleep anymore. The dreams feel like reality. The prayers don’t work the same. And sometimes—God help me—I think I can hear it during the day.

Just faintly. Like a voice behind mine.

Praying.

The worst part? Last night, I didn’t hear it while I was asleep.

I heard it while I was brushing my teeth.

And this time… it finished the prayer before I could start it.

Want a Part 2? I’ll write it as soon as I get the nerve to sleep again.
