I remember the days when Noah and I roamed the wild coasts of Alaska like two wolves bound by the same pack instinct. Our friendship forged in the bitter winds that whipped across the frozen tundra and the relentless waves that crashed against the jagged rocks where we built our first cabin with nothing but our hands and the axes we carried on our belts. We had met as boys in the shadow of the great mountains, where the snow lay thick and unforgiving through the long winters, and from that time onward we shared everything. The hunts that left us bloodied and triumphant with caribou haunches slung over our shoulders, the nights by the fire where we spoke of dreams that stretched beyond the horizon, and the silences that needed no words because our bond ran deeper than any river we had ever crossed together. Noah was the stronger of us in body, his frame broad and unyielding, while I possessed the sharper mind for tracking and planning, and together we made a pair that no storm could break, facing down blizzards that buried lesser men and pulling each other from crevasses of ice that had opened in small ravines. In those years we laughed at the tales of sailors who spoke of sirens in the deep, dismissing them as the ravings of men driven mad by isolation and the sea’s cruel whisper, for we trusted in the solid earth beneath our boots and the loyalty that tied us closer than blood, vowing that nothing could sever what the wilderness had welded between us.

We had ventured far north that fateful summer, drawn by rumors of gold flecks in the streams that fed into the Bering Sea. Our packs heavy with provisions and our spirits high with the promise of fortune that had eluded so many before us, and it was on a fog-shrouded evening as we trudged along the pebbled shore, the salt air thick in our lungs and the distant calls of seabirds, when we first heard the voice that would unravel everything we held sacred. The sound came drifting over the water, a melody woven from the sighs of the wind and the lapping of the tides, carrying with it a sweetness that pierced the soul, and we stopped in our tracks, our eyes straining through the mist toward a cluster of rocks where the waves broke in foaming fury. There she was, perched upon a slick outcrop, her form half-shadowed by the dying light, her hair cascading like seaweed tangled in the currents, and though we could not see her face clearly at first, the pull of her presence gripped us both with an invisible force that made our hearts pound in unison. 

Noah turned to me with a grin that split his bearded face.

“Look at her, Charlie. Ain’t no shipwrecked girl. That’s something else entirely.”

I felt the chill crawl up my spine.

“Something else,” I answered, voice low, entranced.

“And she’s looking right at us.”

He laughed, the sound rough and eager.

“Then let’s go say hello. Can’t leave a lady sitting on rocks all night.”

We approached her cautiously, our boots crunching over the shells and driftwood that littered the beach, calling out greetings that the wind seemed to steal away before they could reach her, and as we drew nearer, her beauty unfolded before us, her skin pale as the moonlit snow, her eyes gleaming with a luminescence that reflected the hidden stars above, and she spoke no words at first, only tilting her head in a way that invited us closer, her lips curving into a smile that promised secrets buried in the depths. Noah was the first to reach her side, extending a hand to help her from the rock, and when she took it, a shiver passed through him that I saw ripple across his broad shoulders, but he laughed it off as the touch of the sea’s chill.

“Easy now,” he said to her, voice softer than I’d ever heard it. “We won’t hurt you.”

Then he looked back at me.

“Come on, Charlie. She’s cold. Help me get her down.”

I stepped forward and felt her fingers brush mine, light as the foam on a breaking wave yet searing with a heat that burned into my very core.

“She don’t weigh nothing,” I muttered.

Noah’s eyes met mine over her head.

“She don’t need to,” he said. “She’s got hold of us already.”

She needed no name, for in that moment she became everything to us, the embodiment of the wild allure that had drawn us to these lands, and we led her back to our camp, wrapping her in our furs and feeding her from our meager stores, watching as she consumed the dried meat and fish with a hunger that matched our own growing fascination. That night, as the fire crackled and the aurora danced overhead in ribbons of green and purple, she hummed that melody again, low and insistent, weaving it into our thoughts until sleep claimed us, and in our dreams she appeared as a vision of endless ocean, pulling us downward into waters where the pressure crushed and the light faded, yet we awoke refreshed, our bond seemingly strengthened by this shared discovery. 

As the days stretched into weeks, we lingered on that coast longer than wisdom dictated, our quest for gold forgotten in the haze of her presence. One afternoon while we gathered clams together, Noah spoke quietly.

“She looked at me longer today, Charlie. Did you see?”

I kept my eyes on the tide pool.

“She looks at us both.”

He gave a short laugh that held no humor.

“Not the same way.”

I straightened, wiping wet hands on my pants.

“You’re seeing things.”

“Am I?” His voice dropped. “Or are you the one pretending not to notice?”

I met his stare then.

“We said nothing would break us.”

He looked away toward the sea.

“We never said nothing about her.”

Noah and I took turns tending to her, gathering clams from the tide pools and berries from the thorny bushes that clung to the cliffs, each of us stealing moments alone with her where her touch would linger on our arms or her breath would warm our necks, igniting fires within us that raged hotter than the blazes we built against the night. At first, our friendship held firm, as we shared stories of her subtle graces around the campfire.

“She laughed today,” Noah said one night, staring into the flames. “Just a little sound, like bells under water.”

I nodded slowly.

“I heard it too. When I brushed her hair back.”

He looked at me sharp.

“You touched her hair?”

“Only to keep it out of her eyes.”

A silence stretched, heavy as wet snow.

“Don’t do it again,” he said at last.

I stared at him across the fire.

“You don’t own her, Noah.”

His jaw tightened.

“Neither do you.”

But gradually a shadow crept between us, born from the glances she cast that seemed to favor one over the other, her hand resting longer on Noah’s knee or her gaze locking with mine in a manner that stirred jealousy like a storm brewing on the horizon. She never spoke a word, yet her influence spread through us, twisting our thoughts until what had been brotherly affection soured into suspicion.  I found myself watching Noah with narrowed eyes when he approached her, wondering if his smiles hid intentions that would steal her from me, while he began to mutter under his breath about my lingering too long by her side, his voice carrying the edge of a blade honed for the hunt.

The vexation grew insidious, and soon our conversations turned from camaraderie to veiled accusations. One evening Noah stopped me outside the cabin.

“You were in there with her for an hour, Charlie.”

“I was fixing the fire.”

He stepped closer.

“The fire don’t need an hour.”

I felt my pulse rise.

“You were with her all morning.”

“That’s different.”

“How?”

He leaned in, voice low and hard.

“Because she asked me to stay.”

I gave a bitter laugh.

“She don’t talk.”

His eyes darkened.

“She don’t need to.”

We argued over trivial matters, the division of chores or the direction of our next foray into the wilds, but beneath it all lay the unspoken rivalry for her favor, and one evening as the sun dipped low, painting the sea in blood-red hues, Noah confronted me directly, his fists clenched at his sides and his face contorted with a rage I had never seen in him before.

“You’re planning to take her, aren’t you?” he said. “Slip off in the dark while I’m checking traps.”

I felt the blood surge in my ears.

“That’s your plan, you mean. You’ve been whispering to her every night.”

He took a step forward.

“I’ve been protecting her from you.”

“Protecting her?” I spat. “Or claiming her?”

He bared his teeth.

“She’s mine, Charlie. You know it.”

I stepped into his space.

“She ain’t nobody’s. And you ain’t mine no more.”

The nights that followed blurred into a torment of sleepless vigils, each of us guarding her as if she were a prize won in battle, and dreams plagued me where Noah’s hands reached for her in ways that filled me with a murderous fury, visions so vivid that upon waking I could scarcely meet his eyes without envisioning the betrayal.

Later that same evening, as the wind began to rise and the sky darkened to the color of bruised iron, Noah found me sitting alone on a drift log near the water’s edge, sharpening my knife with slow, deliberate strokes. He stopped a few paces away, shoulders squared, voice rough with something that might have been exhaustion or grief.

“Charlie… we gotta talk. Before this goes any further.”

I didn’t look up. “Ain’t much left to say, is there?”

“There is.” He took a step closer. “We been brothers since we were boys. Shared every damn thing. Food, cold, blood. You remember that winter on the Tanana when we ate nothing but snowshoe hare for six weeks straight and still laughed about it?”

I paused, the whetstone still in my hand. “I remember.”

“Then listen to me now.” His voice cracked just once. “Whatever she is… she ain’t worth this. She ain’t worth us tearing each other apart like dogs over a scrap. We walk away tonight. Both of us. Leave her to the sea. Go back south. Start over. Just you and me, like it used to be.”

I finally met his eyes. They were red-rimmed, desperate. For a heartbeat the old Noah looked back at me—the one who’d pulled me from the ice, who’d split the last piece of jerky when we were starving.

Then I thought of her eyes on him that morning. The way her fingers had lingered on his wrist.

“You’d leave her?” I asked, voice flat.

He swallowed hard. “For you? Yeah. I would.”

I stood slowly. “Liar.”

“Charlie—”

“You’d wait till I was asleep. Then you’d take her and run. I see it in your face every night.”

His fists clenched at his sides. “That’s what you think of me now?”

“That’s what she’s made me think.”

He stared at me a long moment, something breaking behind his eyes.

“Then God help us both,” he whispered.

He turned and walked back toward the cabin. I watched him go, the knife still heavy in my hand, and knew there would be no more talking.

The jealousy snapped on a moonless night when we had ventured out to check our traps along the shore, leaving her behind in the cabin’s dim glow.  Noah accused me of tampering with his gear, claiming I sought to strand him in the wilds so I could claim her solely, and his words ignited the powder keg within me, for in that instant I saw him not as my brother but as an enemy, a thief intent on robbing me of the one light that had pierced the darkness of our existence. We grappled there on the rocky beach, our bodies slamming together with the force of colliding icebergs, fists flying in a frenzy that drew blood from split lips and bruised knuckles, and as we rolled in the surf, the cold water soaking us to the bone. I felt a primal urge surge through me, stronger than any survival instinct I had known in the face of starvation or storm. Noah pinned me momentarily, his weight bearing down like the crush of an avalanche, but I twisted free and struck him across the jaw with a rock clutched in my hand, the impact resounding with a sickening crack that sent him reeling backward, blood streaming from his temple and mingling with the saltwater that foamed around us. He lunged again, his eyes wild with the same madness that gripped me, but I dodged and drove my knee into his gut, doubling him over, and then my hands were upon him, tearing at his coat and shirt with a ferocity that knew no restraint, my fingers digging into his flesh as if to rip away the very essence that dared challenge my claim.

In that blind rage, I clawed deeper, my nails raking through skin and muscle, the warmth of his blood spilling over my hands like the hot springs we had once bathed in together, and he gasped, his struggles weakening as I plunged my grip into his abdomen, feeling the give of tissue and the slick resistance of organs that yielded to my pull. I wrenched outward with all my strength, loops of intestine uncoiling in my fists like ropes hauled from the sea, glistening red and purple in the faint starlight, steam rising from the exposed viscera as the cold air met the heat of his innards, and Noah’s screams pierced the night, raw and guttural, echoing off the cliffs. Blood poured from the ragged wound, soaking the pebbles beneath us in a dark pool, chunks of flesh and membrane clinging to my arms as I tore further, his liver and spleen spilling forth in a grotesque cascade, the metallic tang of gore filling my nostrils while his body convulsed in agony, his hands feebly clutching at the emptiness where his guts had been. He collapsed then, his face pale as the underbelly of a fish, eyes wide with shock and betrayal, and as the life ebbed from him, his final whisper reached me, ragged and wet with blood:

“Shoulda… walked away… together…”

And then, as suddenly as a fog lifting from the bay, the vex shattered, her spell dissolving like mist under the rising sun, and I stared down at what I had wrought, the mutilated corpse of my dearest friend lying eviscerated on the shore, his entrails strewn about, the blood congealing in the chill while his vacant eyes accused me from beyond the veil. Horror flooded me, a tidal wave of regret and despair that drowned all else, for in that clarity I saw the truth of her nature, the siren who had ensnared us not with chains but with illusions of love, turning brother against brother until only ruin remained, and I howled into the night, my voice joining the wind’s lament as I cradled his ruined form, the warmth fading from his body like the last embers of our fire. She was gone when I returned to the cabin, vanished back into the sea from whence she came, leaving me alone with the ghosts of our friendship and the indelible stain of fratricide, condemned to wander these cursed coasts forever, haunted by the memory of the man I had loved and destroyed, my soul as torn as his flesh, in a tragedy deeper than the ocean’s abyss.
