Hey everyone,

I’m not usually the type to post on forums, but I’m in a bit of a weird situation and need some advice. My dog, Rex, passed away about two weeks ago. He was getting up there in age—13 years—and I guess I should’ve seen it coming, but it hit me harder than I expected. He was always there, you know? Every morning, those big brown eyes would be waiting for me, and now there’s just this empty space.

I want to preserve him. I know that might sound strange to some of you, but I’ve seen people who get their pets stuffed through taxidermy and I think it’s a great way to honor their memory. Rex deserves that. I just don’t want him to… decay before I figure out how to do it right. The thing is, I don’t know much about taxidermy, and I’m worried about the flesh starting to rot before I can get to it. 

I did some research, and I found some info about using formaldehyde and borax for preservation, but it feels a bit too clinical, too impersonal. I want to do it right—something that feels more like I’m caring for him, not just turning him into an object. Freezing seemed like a good option, but my wife—well, my love—she suggested that wouldn’t work for the long term. She’s always been the smart one between us, even with everything she’s been through lately.

She’s been recovering from this accident. I don’t want to get into the details, but it’s been hard on both of us. But she’s strong, always has been, and she’s doing better now. Some days are good, some are bad. She’s resting a lot these days, and I’m just trying to keep things together at home while she heals. I’m lucky to have her. I don’t know what I’d do without her. 

I’ve been trying to take care of everything myself, and preserving Rex is just one of those things I need to get right. It’s important. I want him to look like he’s just sleeping, like he could wake up at any moment. He’s still in the basement for now—cooler down there, which I’m hoping helps slow the decomposition a bit. But I can’t keep him there forever. I need to figure out how to treat the flesh before it really starts to break down. 

I’ve seen some guides online, but they all seem a bit… detached. They talk about the process like it’s just another dead animal, but Rex isn’t just some dog. He was part of the family. I can’t stand the thought of him rotting away. My love says I’m putting too much pressure on myself, but I can’t help it. It’s like I’m failing him if I don’t get this right. I’m wondering if anyone here has experience with something like this? Is there a way to preserve him without stripping him down to bones and fur? I’d like to keep as much of him intact as possible.

I’ve also thought about using glycerin. I read somewhere that it can keep tissue from drying out and keep it soft, but I’m not sure if it’s enough to prevent decay. I want Rex to stay just like he was—soft, real. I need to feel that fur again, to have him near me, like nothing’s changed. 

My love says I should take it easy, but I’ve always been the kind of guy who needs to be hands-on. She knows that about me. Even now, while she’s resting, she tells me not to stress over things, but how can I not? She’s been through so much already, and I just want to make everything right for her when she comes back downstairs. I keep thinking about how it’ll be once Rex is preserved and I can show her. She loved him, too. 

Sorry if I’m rambling a bit. It’s just been a lot, with everything going on. Sometimes, when it’s late and the house is quiet, it feels like I can still hear him padding around, or feel him brushing up against my leg. Maybe that’s why I’m so desperate to keep him with me, to hold on to some part of him. My love gets it, even if she thinks I’m a little obsessive. She’s always been so patient with me, even before the accident. 

I guess that’s why I’m so focused on this project. I want everything to be perfect for when she’s better. I want things to feel normal again. I know they never will, not completely, but at least we can have Rex with us, in some way. I’ve been thinking about that a lot lately—how to keep things the way they are, or how they used to be. My love and I used to talk about that all the time before the accident, about how things change and you can’t stop it. But maybe, in some small way, I *can* stop it. At least with Rex.

I’m going to keep researching, but if anyone has any advice on the preservation process, I’d appreciate it. I’m not looking for anything too technical or distant—just something that feels personal. Rex deserves that. 

My love has been asleep for a while now, so I should probably go check on her soon. She’s been sleeping a lot lately, but that’s normal, I think. The doctors said rest is the most important part of recovery. She still looks so peaceful, even with everything. Sometimes I’ll sit by her side and hold her hand for hours. It’s colder than I remember, but they said that’s to be expected with her condition. I try not to worry about it too much. She’s still here, and that’s what matters.

But yeah, I’d really appreciate any tips you guys have on keeping Rex from… falling apart. I’m doing my best with what I’ve got, but I feel like I’m missing something. My love says I should trust myself more. She always knows how to calm me down when I’m spiraling like this. She’s right, of course, like she always is. I just wish she could be up and about to help me with this, but soon, I know she will be. 

Sorry if this post got a little off track. It’s been tough lately, trying to keep everything together while also dealing with Rex’s loss. But I know it’ll get better, eventually. Once Rex is preserved, I think it’ll feel like things are back to normal, at least a little bit. 

Thanks in advance for any help or advice you can offer.
