LocomotiveC: WTF is that in gen chat? 

Frontier16: Tried deleting. But they keep spamming.

JazBlu87: Yikes! Has Nine seen this?

Lemon-time: No, trying to ping.

LocomotiveC: Timezones...

Lemon-time: yep

Frontier16: can't ban user.

JazBlu87: why?

Frontier16: don't know. Just keep coming back.

LocomotiveC: what is it? That thing they keep posting?

Lemon-time: not sure, but it can't be here.

JazBlu87: looks like a baby 😟

LocomotiveC: that's what I thought at first.

Lemon-time: it's not a baby.

Niner2: yo, ping? 

JazBlu87: Nine!

Frontier16: Nine, something's popping off in gen chat

Niner2: It's late guys...

Lemon-time: hey, yeah sorry. We have a little situation... 

Niner2: whoa 😳 

JazBlu87: yeah...

Niner2: what is that?

LocomotiveC: we don't know. I clicked the link and it gets weirder

JazBlu87: loco! 😱 Why you click? 

Frontier16: Trojan incoming, my man 😂

LocomotiveC: ye I know. Dumb. I just needed to figure it out

Niner2: have we banned user and deleted?

Lemon-time: countless times

Frontier16: keeps coming back and spamming more

Niner2: and other users?

JazBlu87: they're freaking out

Niner2: have they clicked?

Lemon-time: we hope not. We announced saying not to

JazBlu87: only Loco ATM 😂 

LocomotiveC: sorry...

Niner2: well, what is the link?

LocomotiveC: hard to say

JazBlu87: ???

Lemon-time: brb DMs are pinging 

Niner2: ok. Loco? 

LocomotiveC: well, it was a gif. A little odd. A dark doorway and then a small shape moving in the darkness.

JazBlu87: yuck

Niner2: doesn't sound too bad. Just spam then? Okay try and ban user. I'm heading for bed 💤

JazBlu87: What kind of username is H3r3tic theory anyways?

Lemon-time: DON'T BAN AND DON'T CLICK. It's not a gif.

Frontier16: wym?

JazBlu87: 🍋 needs to 😴. It's just spam from some incel loser.

Lemon-time: Shoes718 just DMed me and asked if Voidlina67 is okay. They clicked the link first. Now they're acting weird in chat.

LocomotiveC: weird, how?

JazBlu87: isn't Void usually weird?

Frontier16: yikes. Essay jumpscare

Lemon-time: have you read it?

Niner2: reading now. Why is she writing about a dead horse?

LocomotiveC: fuck

Frontier16: loco?

LocomotiveC: my office door just opened

JazBlu87: wifey calling time?

Frontier16: 😂 

LocomotiveC: no, nothing's there. But I thought I left the hall light on. Just dark.

JazBlu87: weird

Lemon-time: 👻 boo! 

Niner2: can't make sense of Void ATM. Sounds like she's writing a spaghetti western. Probably memeing

LocomotiveC: wait

JazBlu87: loco???

LocomotiveC: something's in the hall. I saw it moving about in the dark 

Niner2: wife?

LocomotiveC: called out for Kel, but she ain't answering

Frontier16: what?

JazBlu87: okay I'm creeped tf out 

Lemon-time: sorry what's happening? had to timeout Void. Still working on how to deal with the troll

Niner2: Loco is trolling

LocomotiveC: metal sound. Scrapping.
