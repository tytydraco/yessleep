On February 10, 1998, emergency services responded to a domestic violence call in Fargo, North Dakota. They arrived on scene to discover a semi-conscious woman who bore signs of severe injuries and mutilation consistent with torture.



The bedroom in which she was discovered contained bloodstained ligatures, bedding, clothing, and a variety of weapons including a baseball bat, a hatchet, a kitchen knife, a machete, and dumbbell plates, all of which bore signs of use. 



In the center of the room was a large shattered mirror. Broken glass covered the room. One shard approximately eight inches in length and three inches in width was lodged in the victim’s stomach.



The victim, who was clearly delirious, told officers that her boyfriend did this to her. “But it’s not his fault. He was crazy, and the mirror made him crazier.”



Despite extensive search efforts, no other individual was discovered on scene, including the victim’s boyfriend. It should be noted that this man was never located, and to date is considered missing.



EMS transported the victim to the hospital, where emergency surgery commenced.



No matter what treatment was rendered, the wound inflicted by the large mirror shard would not heal.



After significant medical intervention, it stopped bleeding but did not knit, effectively leaving the victim with a small cavern in her abdomen.



Approximately two weeks into her hospital stay, one of the nurses providing treatment went into hysterics and refused to go back into her room. When asked, the nurse explained that while performing wound care, she “looked inside the patient’s wound and saw a room.”



According to the nurse, the patient herself was somehow inside this room inside the wound, smiling back at her.



The patient was not capable of providing any additional information. At this time, she was still extremely mentally unstable owing to her ordeal, and medically fragile. 



Shortly after this, the patient was taken for further study with the goal of closing her wound once and for all.



The details of this study are disturbing and fundamentally irrelevant.



Suffice to say, the medical professionals studying her wound also observed this bizarre “room” described by the nurse. Following a distinctly unfortunate incident relating to this room, hospital staff facilitated her transfer to the custody of AHH-NASCU.



The inmate, Ms. Pauley, has been with the agency ever since. She is currently a T-Class agent assigned to the agency director.



Ms. Pauley’s ability is simply astonishing. In simplest terms, she is the keeper of an open-ended pocket dimension. This dimension takes the form of a living room paneled in mirrors. Ms. Pauley says the space is identical to the living room of her childhood home except for the mirror walls.



The entrance to this pocket reality is the wound cut into Ms. Pauley’s abdomen by the mirror shard. Ms. Pauley and Administration both agree that the spectacular properties of this wound derive directly from the properties of the broken mirror that inflicted the injury. After taking her into custody, Agency personnel attempted to find additional shards of the mirror but were unsuccessful.



Notably, the pocket-dimension includes a front door that, when opened, leads to other locations. Previously, Ms. Pauley claimed to have no idea where the door led. However, following the recent escape of Inmate 70 (Ward 2, “The Man Who Never Smiles”) the agency learned that Ms. Pauley not only knows where the door leads to, but can control where it goes. 



Given Inmate 70’s unique abilities, Ms. Pauley was not disciplined for his containment breach. However, on 12/14/24, when she was caught trying to help Inmate 22 (Ward 1, “Lifeblood”) breach containment.



It should be noted that Inmate 22 reported Ms. Pauley of her own volition, although she displayed extreme emotional distress at the idea that Ms. Pauley would “get in trouble.”



After this incident, Ms. Pauley was fitted with a device that removes her ability to control whether to open or close her pocket-dimension. When the device is active, her body is intact, the wound appears to be healed, and no going in or out. The agency director currently monitors this device himself.



Ms. Pauley is a 51-year-old adult female. She is 5’9” tall, with brown hair and blue eyes. She suffers from major depressive disorder and anxiety. Despite extensive therapy and full compliance with her treatment plans, she experiences significant distress whenever she looks into a mirror. 



Ms. Pauley has historically been extremely cooperative with Agency directives, but due to recent events she was reclassified to uncooperative status.



At the director’s discretion, she still maintains T-Class status, albeit in a highly restricted capacity.

**Interview Date: 12/21/2024**









My boyfriend used to talk to mirrors.



He told me that talking to his reflection was a coping mechanism he developed as a kid. I had a few of my own weird coping mechanisms, so I understood. I didn’t like it — mirrors have always made me uneasy — but I understood.

Besides, talking to the mirror wasn’t the only bizarre thing he did, and certainly not the scariest. Not by a long shot.



*Crazy* is a bad word, especially for people like me. I hate using it, even now.



But looking back, Philip was crazy.



But at the time, his particular kind of crazy felt familiar. He felt comfortable. He felt like home. Everyone wants to find home, me included.



So what are you supposed to do when crazy feels like home?



No one else has ever felt like home to me. Only him. 



And he wasn’t a monster. Far from it. He was sweet and thoughtful, and stable enough to get custody of his baby sister, Alice, who adored him. They had the same eyes, this spectacular pale green. 



Most importantly, Philip was sure about me from the very beginning. He showed it, every day. He once told me that he knew we were meant to be from our very first conversation. Like he’d known me his entire life. Or that we’d known each other in a thousand prior lives. 



I didn’t believe in any of that, of course. But I believed the way he treated me.



And he treated me extremely well.



Above all, he was so considerate. It’d take days to tell you everything he did for me. But just as an example, I once told him no one had ever read me a bedtime story. From that point on, every night before we went to sleep, he’d tell me a story. Sometimes fairy tales, sometimes urban legends, usually stories he made up himself. Falling asleep next to him while he whispered a story in my ear is one of my favorite memories, even now.



I asked him once where he got his story ideas. “From the mirror,” he teased. “I talk to it, and it talks back.”



In a lot of ways, he was wonderful.



Now, don’t get me wrong. Our lows transcendently awful. But the highs were correspondingly spectacular. And even on the worst days, we never went to sleep angry. That was a first for me. Even if we’d been fighting, even if we’d been screaming, even if we were angry and even if I was scared, that all melted away as soon as we got into bed and he started telling a story. 



That’s why it was so easy to stay with him.



As for the things that made it hard to stay — well, that’s where my own weird childhood coping mechanism came into play.



When I was a little girl, I used to imagine a little pocket behind my heart. A hidden, dark, secure, and above all safe place where I put all my bad feelings.



That pocket is where I shoved all my fears and doubts about Philip, and it’s where I hid all the instincts that screamed at me to leave him. 



There were a lot of those. Too many. But the heart-pocket was magic, so whenever I had too many bad feelings for the pocket to hold, it grew to accommodate them.



Once, after this particularly insane fight, I could practically feel it expanding. I felt it stretching from my heart to my hips, gently displacing my organs and grazing along my bones. I was sure I’d be able to press down on my stomach and feel it hiding, firm and heavy and full of all the darkness that threatened my light.



I hated our fights. I hated how they made me feel. I hated how they made him feel. I hated that they were never about anything important. I hated that Alice had to hear them.  



Most of all, I hated how he talked to the mirror after every one of those fights.



Because no matter what he said about coping mechanisms, he only ever got worse after he talked to mirrors. 



There was one day, maybe a week after the new year, where we basically started fighting the minute we woke up.



Nothing I did helped. No matter what I did, everything just kept getting worse and worse, snowballing into something uncontrollable. I could feel it in my gut and in the depths of my heart-pocket: 



We were headed for disaster.



And that night, he didn’t get into bed with me. He stayed in the bathroom, talking to his mirror.



What I heard him say was terrifying.



He kept repeating *Every life, we kill each other.*

  


And he kept saying he needed to sever “the soul tie.” How pain is the only way. That’s what he kept saying: *Pain is the only way. The greater the pain, the cleaner the cut. You have to do it. It’s the only way to end this forever. It’s the only way to save each other.*



I tried to shove all the fear into my heart-pocket, but it wouldn’t fit. It kept bursting out to run through my bloodstream in terrible electric surges.



Finally I couldn’t take it anymore. At three in the morning on that frozen January night, I confronted him.



He had a full-bore breakdown.



He started screaming and begging by turns. Grabbing me and shoving me against the wall, only to fall to his knees begging. He asked me to forgive him. He said we were cursed, that the angel in the mirror told him so and the angel never lied. He said he loved me so much that he would do anything to break the curse. Anything to sever the soul tie.



Anything to set each other free.



Something in his face made me sure that he was about to hurt me.



So I dragged Alice out of bed — it wasn’t hard, she was wide awake and crying, bright green eyes swollen and swimming with tears — bundled her into her coat, and took her to the car.



It was snowing. We slipped and slid on the icy driveway as gusts of wind tore through our coats. Philip came after us, screaming, begging us to stay. That he needed to save us once and for all.



He even chased after the car. I saw him in the rearview mirror, a manic shadow that only vanished when I turned the corner and sped away.



The snow was coming down hard and the wind was spinning it out into billowing blankets. It was impossible to see.



I wasn’t driving well to begin with because of stress. About ten minutes after we left the house, I hit a patch of ice. The car spun out of control. I heard Alice scream.



The next thing I knew, I woke up in a hospital.



Philip was slumped in a chair by my bed, fast asleep and whiter than a sheet.



I tried to wake him up, but my head was swimming. The world was tilting. I couldn’t remember anything. I fell asleep again.



When I woke up, the doctors told me I’d make a full recovery. By some miracle, I’d survived.



Alice had not.



Somehow, Philip didn’t blame me.



It’s so awful to say, but losing Alice changed him for the better.



No more fights, no more screaming, no more anything. Just hopeless gentleness.



He stopped doing all the little considerate things I’d loved, so I did them instead. I didn’t tell him bedtime stories, though. That was a uniquely Philip thing. Even the thought of whispering fairy tales to him as he drifted off felt like a betrayal in a way I couldn’t articulate.



The only thing that didn’t change was the mirror.



He still talked to the mirror.



He always kept his voice so low that I couldn’t make out his words. Sometimes it sounded like two voices. But one morning, about a year after we lost Alice, I woke up to the familiar sounds of his mirror-conversation. For once, he was talking loudly enough for me to hear.



And he was crying.



“How am I supposed to hurt her? How can you expect me to do any of this?”



Then he shushed himself, and his voice returned to that indistinguishable softness.



I almost left that day.



But I didn’t.

The next morning, Philip basically became a different man.



He woke me up with toast and coffee for breakfast, something he hadn’t done in nearly two years. He started smiling again, and doing all those little things he used to do.



And that night, after I climbed into bed, he brought me a cup of tea. While I sipped it, he finally told me another bedtime story:



*Once upon a time, a woman named Akrasia fell in love with a man named Kairos. But Kairos wouldn’t have her. Kairos was rich, you see, while Akrasia lived with her penniless father in a hovel by the sea.*

  


*Out of desperation, Akrasia went to the god Hynthala. She entered his mirror palace and offered anything and everything in her possession if only Hynthala would make Kairos love her. ‘You have nothing,’ Hynthala told her. ‘Nothing but the clothes on your back. Clothes do not buy love. Love buys love. Your father loves you. Bring me your green-eyed father, and I will make Kairos love you.’”*

  


*So Akrasia brought her father to the mirror palace. Hynthala accepted him as an offering, and told her to go to Kairos. “He will love you now and forever,” he promised. “From this moment until the very last star dies for the very last time.”*

  


*Akrasia went to Kairos. True to Hynthala’s word, he loved her above all else.* 

  


*But he still would not take her to wife.*

  


*He would have to renounce his family and the bride they had already chosen for him. Though he loved Akrasia deeply, he would not forsake everything for her.*

  


*Akrasia held onto hope that Kairos would change his mind, but he did not. On the night of his wedding, she flung herself into the sea and drowned.*

  


*Kairos grieved her passing deeply, for he did love her. But although he loved Akrasia until his dying day, he never regretted the choice to keep his family, his position and his inheritance.*



And that was the end.



“This story is about us,” Philip said quietly.



I felt sick. I knew, somehow, that this was Philip’s way of ending things with me. 



Through tears, I asked, “So what, am I supposed to be Akrasia?”



“No.” He cupped my face. “Never.” His thumb brushed across my cheekbone, smearing the tear against my skin. “You were Kairos.”



For the second time, something in his face made me sure I was about to die.



Before I even realized what I was doing, I was halfway out of bed. But when my feet hit the floor, the world spun and stretched, swinging upward, and I fell back.



Philip shot forward and pinned me down. I tried to struggle, but every time I moved the world flipped upside down. I felt like I was stuck to the ceiling, ke whatever was holding me was giving way. Like I was about to fall to the floor and smash like a porcelain doll.



“It’s going to be okay,” Philip soothed. “I promise. Listen. Please listen. I’m doing this because I love you. I have to sever our tie, for your sake and for mine. We find each other in every life. It should be beautiful, but it’s not. We always destroy each other and everyone around us. The mirror told me. The mirror never lies. If I’d listened to it, Alice would be alive and you would be happy somewhere else. I know it. *I know it.*”



He tied me down. I tried to fight, but whatever he put in my tea rendered me helpless.



As he worked, he explained what he was going to do and why.



“Memories don’t transfer, but essence does. We have to make our essence remember. The only way to do that is suffering. We have to make it hurt so badly that our essences repulse each other in the next life and every life that comes after. It’s the only way we’ll be happy: By making sure we never love each other.”



Then he got up and left. I tried to wriggle out of the restraints, but every time I moved my head, the room spun.



Some time later — maybe a minute, may be ten minutes, maybe an hour or six or two days — he came back with the mirror. He put it on top of the dresser, angling it so I could see myself.



Then he came to the edge of the bed and told me another story.



I could barely follow his words. My head was swimming. Consciousness dipped in and out, just like when I’d been in the hospital after the wreck.



*A long time ago, two homeless orphans were best friends: a beautiful and very angry girl, and a sad little boy with a green-eyed cat that he loved more than anything except the girl. All they had was each other. They slept during the day to avoid those who might prey on two small children alone in the world. They woke at sunset and traveled at night, stealing fruit from moonlit orchards and eggs from sleepy chickens in their coops.*

  


*But when winter came, the orchards died and the chickens stopped laying. The children were soon starving.*

  


*One bitter morning, the girl left the boy and his green-eyed cat sleeping in a barn, and revealed herself to the farmer.*

  


*The farmer welcomed her into his house, but he did not help her.*

  


*When the boy woke to find the girl gone, he thought she had abandoned him, so he cried. But then his green-eyed cat hurried to the barn door, meowing.*

  


*When the boy left the barn, he heard the girl screaming from inside the farmhouse.*

  


*His little cat found a way inside through a broken window and led him through dusty, sunlit rooms to a door, behind which he heard the girl weeping.*

  


*She was in a terrible state, but he helped her to her feet. The cat led them  back through the dusty, sunlit rooms to the broken window. The cat jumped onto the sill, but lost her balance and fell back. She knocked a pot to the floor, where it shattered.*

  


*The sound alerted the farmer. As he came crashing down the stairs, the boy helped the girl through the window. He tried to follow, but the farmer caught him.* 

  


*The boy’s last memory was the sound of his cat meowing as he died.*

  


*The girl tried and save him, but she was too late and too wounded besides, and died for her trouble.*



When Philip finished, he leaned over and picked up a baseball bat. It made me scream, which made him cry.



“I’m sorry,” he wept. “I’m so, so sorry.”



He brought the bat down on my knee, once, twice, three times.



Agony. Pure, white-out agony. I could hear myself scream, but barely noticed. The mirror loomed across from me, dark as a nighttime pool. I imagined teeth inside the glass, bared in a smile.



Philip talked to the mirror after. As he spoke, I felt my heart-pocket shudder and expand. I pretended to open it and dropped things inside: Fear, the dizziness, the overwhelming pain in my knee.



It was slow and tortuous, but by the time Philip had finished and curled up next to me, whispering tearful apologies, I was able to sleep.



The next day, he told another story. 



But I interrupted him quickly, calling him a fucked-up, gender-bent Scheherazade. I told him he needed help. I promised I’d get him help. I told him I loved him, I still loved him and would always love him and none of this changed that, just please, please, please, *please*—



He struck me with enough force to daze me.



As my ears rang and dark spots swarmed my eyes, Philip told another a story in between his own sobs.



He told me of another life where I was captured by a warlord. He traded his green-eyed sister to the warlord to free me so we could escape together. But it was all for naught, because we died anyway, long before we reached safety.



As he spoke, I saw glimmers of his story. Scenes from a fading dream. The warlord grinning as he pulled the green-eyed sister in and shoved me out. Philip’s sick and haunted eyes — but they weren’t Philip’s eyes, it wasn’t Philip’s face. The devastated countryside, the bugs and animals feasting on the dead left to rot among the rocks. The roving band that finally killed us long before we reached our destination.  



When Philip finished, he pulled out a knife.



I immediately kicked him, sending the knife skittering across the floor. He moaned, then picked up the bat and smashed my other knee.



He screamed even louder than I did.  



Then he talked to the mirror.



After he left, I prayed — not to God, but to my heart-pocket. I prayed for it to become huge. Bigger than big, bigger than the room I was in.



And it answered. I felt it grow. Felt my organs shifting, the tickle as it scraped along my ribcage. When I felt it was big enough, I opened it up and dropped myself inside it.



Part of me was still in Philip’s bedroom, gazing blankly at the mirror while I wept.



But the other, bigger, more important part was inside my heart-room.



It looked just like my childhood living room early on Saturday mornings, right down to the cartoons on the TV and the half-eaten bowl of cereal on the floor and the battered cardboard boxes stacked against the wall to predawn gloom outside the windows.



I sat on the floor, criss cross applesauce, and watched Looney Tunes and ate soggy cereal until Philip came back.



He told me another story, some fucked-up beauty and the beast analog about a man who was a monster inside and out, and the woman he loved who was just as monstrous, but only on the inside. When they were finally caught, she betrayed him to save herself. He attacked her in a heartbroken rage, only to find out it wasn’t true — her betrayal had been a clever ruse to save him.



The hunters killed them both. He died loathing himself as he drowned in his own blood. 



There were no glimmers this time. I saw the entire thing in the mirror, as clearly as if it were playing on TV.



Philip hurt me again. I don’t remember what he did, because I managed to hide inside my heart-room before the pain entirely hit.



But even from the depths of my heart-room, I heard Philip talking to the mirror.



And this time, I heard something talking back.



For the first time, it occurred to me that I was losing my mind. With that realization came a storm of rage, pain, and above all, terror The terror made me feel crazier than all the rest put together.



I felt it coming up my throat, like vomit but impossibly too much. Enough to tear my throat open, to rupture my stomach, corrosive enough to burn holes in my heart-room.



I ran blindly to the stack of battered boxes in the corner, dumped one out, and vomited everything inside me into the box.



The box swelled and undulated like it was going to burst open, but it held.



When I was done, I closed up the box.



Then I shuffled back across the room, sat down in front of the blaring TV, and continued to eat my cereal.



Philip came back a while later to tell me yet another story of how our other selves did nothing but ruin each other and everyone around them.



I don’t remember what it was about, because the moment I saw him, I opened the door to my heart-room and hid inside.



This is how it went for days. Maybe weeks. Maybe even months.



Every day Philip told me some awful bedtime story where some man or woman or child destroyed the person who loved them most out of cowardice or calculation or terror.



After every story, he hurt me. After he hurt me, he told me through his own tears that the pain was another blow against the soul tie. Once it was cut, we would finally be free and in the scheme of eternity, all of this would be nothing but a bad dream. 



Then he would talk to the mirror, and the mirror would talk back.



No matter how deeply I hid in the pocket-room beside my heart, no matter how loudly I crunched cereal or how loudly I turned up the volume on the TV, I always heard the mirror talk back.



That frightened me. The point of my pocket-room was to protect myself. To preserve my sanity. To make sure I got out of anything I fell into alive.



But even my room couldn’t protect me from the fact that Philip’s mirror always talked back.



Philip got worse and worse. I barely noticed. Even when he hurt me, even when he wept afterward, even when he crept into bed and held me while he sobbed into my hair, I barely noticed. How could I? I was sitting in my cozy living room, watching Looney Tunes and eating my favorite cereal while the sun came up.



I was happy there. No one, not even Philip, could touch me while I was happy. 



It got to the point where I couldn’t even remember anything he told me, or differentiate the pain of one injury from another.



But I do remember the day he broke the fingers on my right hand.



He cried because I loved to play the violin, and with broken fingers I would never be able to play again.



That made me laugh.



That’s why I remember it: Because it made me laugh until I gagged.



I mean of all the things to worry about while you’re torturing your girlfriend to death, that’s what breaks you?



That was actually it, though. It really is what broke him.



After that, Philip told the mirror he couldn’t hurt me anymore. That he would never hurt me again.



For some reason, that pulled me out of my pocket room. Just as I surfaced, he left. 



I tried to go back inside myself but couldn’t. The door to the pocket room was locked.



So I stared at the mirror, crying weakly as tides of pain drowned me.



As I faded out, the mirror flickered to brightness. Just like a TV.



And I saw another story.



Two men in military uniforms, cut off from their squad and hiding from enemies. One was a monster of a man, a quintessential soldier. The other was his opposite, small and badly wounded. He expected the big one to leave him. *I* expected the big one to leave him.



Instead, he bundled the small one in his own jacket and kept watch for hours while the winds screamed and enemies trekked by obliviously. He built a small fire and used it to cauterize the small one’s wound.



When the coast was finally clear, he hoisted the little one onto his back and carried him for hours, until he caught up with their squadron.



No one got hurt.



No one betrayed anyone else.



No one died.



And the two of them stayed best friends until the day the big one died.



It was a good ending. A happy one.



And I knew, as that story faded away, that it wasn’t the only happy one.



I focused on the mirror, willing it to show me something else. Something that was good.



It did.



And a third time.



And a fourth.



Again and again and again, all day long.



Philip finally came back, apologizing. “I got weak. I’m sorry. That was unfair to you. I have to be strong to break our tie for good. From now on, I will be.”



I saw that he had a hatchet with him.



The truth flooded out of me. All of the good stories. All of the love. Every last detail of every last happy life.



“Where did you see this?” he asked.



“In your mirror,” I said.



For the last time in his life, Philip had a breakdown.



But unlike his other breakdowns, this one felt right to me. Even positive. Like the breakdown was an earthquake shattered the hole in which he’d fallen, and he was riding back to the surface on a tidal swell of broken earth.



Like he was finally coming back to himself. 



Like a spell had broken.



Once it broke, he ran to me and started untying my restraints. 



But then the mirror spoke again.



Something ancient and deep and awful, something that made my bones thrum.



The mirror blazed to a flat, brilliant, shimmering darkness.



Philip threw it to the ground, shattering it.





The broken glass shot upward and whirled impossibly, like a tornado. Pieces spun out, cutting Philip, embedding themselves in the walls. One huge shard flew at me. I saw Philip’s reflection for an instant, and then my own right before it lodged itself in my stomach. I felt it cut my pocket room. I felt the contents spill into my bloodstream.



The storm stopped. Shards fell to the floor like shining rain, thudding on the carpet, clattering against the glass still clinging to the frame.



As I watched, the floor inside the frame flickered and vanished, transforming into a void. Into a bottomless black tunnel. Just like in the cartoons I watched in my pocket-room.



Shining white hands rose out of the mirror tunnel and gripped the frame as Philip reached for me.



If my pocket-room had not been cut, I would have reached for him too. I would have pulled him close, away from the glimmering black tunnel and those shining monster hands.



But my pocket-room had been cut. Everything inside it — all the hate, all the pain, all the rage, for Philip and for everyone and everything else  — was surging through me now. I’d been torn open. I had become a passageway. A door. A portal, not just for my own pain but for the suffering of each and every life we’d been cursed to share.



When he saw my expression, he crawled back. Glass crunched under his hands. He left smeary handprints of blood on the carpet.



His backed into the broken mirror. The moment he touched it, those shimmering white hands grabbed him and pulled him down into that insane tunnel.



I lunged after him. When I hit the floor, every bone and muscle in my body screamed. But that pain wasn’t enough to stop me.



I crawled to mirror frame and looked down into the tunnel. There he was. Beneath him, far below in the darkness, something billowed into being. Something ghostly bright and shimmering, with monstrous hands grasping upward.



I reached for him, lost my balance, and started to fall.



And as I fell, I saw the walls of the tunnel or the wormhole or whatever you want to call it were alive. Like a cosmic TV. I saw things I recognized. Things from my own life, things from my life with Philip. I saw other things that I didn’t recognize with my eyes, but still recognized with my heart.



I saw things I didn’t know at all. I saw things that frightened me. I saw things that felt terribly wrong, and things that felt beautifully right.



Ten million scenes from ten million lives, whirling around me, bright and almost blinding against the dark tunnel.



Somehow I knew, in the truest part of me, that I could have reached out and fallen into any one of those lives and lived there without being any the wiser



But I didn’t care about any of those lives.



I only cared about Philip falling into the arms of the monster far below.



My fingers finally brushed his. His hand convulsed on mine. Pain exploded as the broken bones ground against each other.



I thought he was going to claw his way up my arm. Even though it would hurt, even though the pain would be exquisitely hideous, that was all I wanted.



Instead, he shoved me away



He continued to fall.



But I shot upward, spinning back like a retracting yoyo, far, farther, farthest, past the empty mirror frame and back in the bloodstained bedroom.



Even though the room tilted and swam, even though I was in more pain that I could even comprehend, I dragged myself to the phone and called the police.



This will sound insane. More insane than what I’ve already told you.



While I waited for the ambulance to come, the shimmer-handed monster spoke to me from the shard of mirror lodged in my guts. “It was impossible to make him let you go.”



“Is it broken?” The room swam around me. I wondered if I was about to die. “The…the soul tie. Is it broken?”



“There is no soul tie. That was a lie. I tell many lies. Even the lives I showed him were lies. Most of them weren’t even yours.”



I started to cry. “Did he end it, at least, like he wanted to? That’s all he wanted. Is it over now?”



“No. Didn’t you hear what he told you? Nothing is over. It will never be over. Not until the last star dies for the very last time.”



I yelled at it, but it didn’t answer. He never spoke to me again.



Which is rude as hell, especially when you consider that he still occasionally crawls out of the tunnel his mirror cut into my stomach.



\* \* \*





If you’re not interested or up to date on my office drama, this part won’t make sense or matter, so feel free to leave it.





After that interview, I was a wreck.



So I went to see Numa.



Even though I didn’t particularly want to invite him, Christophe looked almost as sick as I felt, so I asked him to come along. He declined.



So I set off alone.



Numa was my first patient, and still one of my favorites. I don’t talk to him often because he just…doesn’t like talking. But I interview him about once a month, and I feel like we’re making slow progress.



Unbeknownst to me, the Agency recently acquired an injured puma cub. Yesterday they had me present it to Numa. Long story short, they’re getting along famously. Numa’s already named her Cub.



I watched them play for a while, then went back upstairs.



As is typical these days, Mikey was waiting for me.



But this time, I was finally ready for him. I immediately made eye contact and asked, “What’s on your mind?”



“There are five wards in the Pantheon.” He answered quickly, like they always do when I make them talk. “Ward One, where we’re at? It’s kind of like fancy ad-seg. Or federal prison. I know about both. I guess you do, too. Just from the opposite side of the cell door.”



“What else?” I asked.



“I was supposed to be A-Class, and you were supposed to be me sidekick. Seems redundant if you ask me, but Admin really liked the idea. But I fucked it up. That’s why you’re stuck with Charlie. Sorry.”



I filed this information away for further consideration. “Why do you want me to be best friends with Christophe?”



It’s hard to explain, but the best way I can put it is Mikey put up a shield. Not enough to stop me from compelling him to answer, but enough to tell the truth without telling the whole truth. “Because he’s a company man for a company that holds in contempt. He gets punished when he obeys, and punished when he doesn’t. He needs is for someone to convince him he fits in. You’re different than him, but not that different. That means you can convince him he fits in.”



“Why can’t you do that?”



“I’ve tried. I can’t. But I think you can.”



I tried to pull out more information, but he was resisting. People try to resist me all the time, but no one ever succeeds.



Except Mikey was, in fact, succeeding.



Christophe came stomping in, breaking my concentration. I felt Mikey slip through.



“Wait here,” he said, then followed Christophe.



I waited patiently for several minutes. Then it finally occurred to me:



*What the hell am I doing?*

  


Thoroughly spooked, I spun around and went after them. I couldn’t find Mikey, but I found Christophe brooding in the empty conference room. He’d been out in the woods because he reeked of evergreens. The smell was almost enough to put me at ease.



“What do you want?” he asked.



“You should go see Numa. He named the mountain lion Cub.”



“Of course he did.”



I waited, trying to figure out what to say to make him look at me. Once he looked at me, I could make him talk. About what, I didn’t know. But I figured it would come to me, like it always did.



Finally I asked him about the mirror shards. “Didn’t they ever ask you to like…track them down?”



“They did.”



“Couldn’t you?”



“Of course I could. I told them I couldn’t.”



That made me laugh. “I can’t say I’m grateful for much here, but I’m pretty grateful to not have to worry about getting sliced up by pieces of a magic mirror. And that’s all thanks to you.”



“It is.”



My patience died. “Christophe, look at me.”



He did.



“What do they do to you downstairs?”



I felt that same sense of deflection I’d gotten from Mikey. Of telling the truth, but not all of it.



“They make me into what they need.”



“What do they need?”



“A vicious dog who does bad things for his bad rewards.” His face contorted, not terribly but just enough to compromise the humanity in it. His eyes took on the mirror-like shine that I despised. “You don’t have to make me talk to you. I will answer what you ask.”



“Okay.” Even though I didn’t want to, I went over and stood beside him. He tensed up. I couldn’t help but wonder what he was afraid of. “Then tell me, what do they do?”



“I never remember. Only that it hurts very much during, and that I feel very good after. When we first met, and I made you frightened — when I liked how it felt to make you frightened — they had just finished with me. Their work was supposed to last a long time, but it lasted a very short time. They are unhappy and they think it’s your fault. I have told them it is not. I have told them you and I do not even get along.”



“We kind of do, though.”



“If we got along, you would not look at me and see only teeth.”



I didn’t know what to say.



“Do not feel sorry. You are right to see what you see.”



We stood in silence for a moment.



Then he said, “I have not always done bad things for bad rewards. I have done the right thing, sometimes. But always too late, and the right thing does not matter if you do it too late.”



I felt a twinge of instinct that made me want to recoil from him and from myself, but knew I had to follow it if I wanted any kind of positive outcome. So before I could think about it — or rather, think myself out of it — I put a hand on his shoulder.



He tensed up again.



“That’s probably true,” I said, “but the fact that you can think that far about it still puts you way ahead of all the other staff here. I can see that just as clearly as I see your teeth. Is there anything I can do or say to keep them from hauling you downstairs?”



“Yes. You can stop whatever this is.”



With that, he shrugged me off and stalked away.



I won’t lie, it was a relief to see him go.

He won’t be gone for long, though, because I just got next week’s interview schedule and he’s still assigned to attend each and every one.



I hope that means they’re not planning on taking him downstairs any time soon.



Partly because I don’t really want anyone to hurt him, and partly because I have the feeling he’s the only person here who will talk to me about all the different wards.



I guess all I can do is wait and see.
