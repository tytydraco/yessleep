Our stomachs ached from hunger, and our minds drowned in thoughts of despair. But, none of us were ready to say aloud that all hope was lost. We were lost, but we were still outwardly clinging to some kind of optimism. 

This wasn’t the hike we expected, but this dreadful, dark reality was ours now. Blisters lined our feet, making every step feel like our tender flesh was being hugged by hot needles. Our mouths were so dry from thirst that it hurt to swallow. 

All we had wanted was to hike to an unforgettable watering hole for a cool swim and a memorable moment. A fun, exciting journey among best friends. 

Nights before, we had met a fellow traveler who shared our appreciation for cheap drinks at an unassuming pub near the hostel. He’s the one who told us about this idyllic oasis. He said the swimming hole was worth every bit of effort and grit to get to, and upon arrival, we would be rewarded most handsomely. The way he preached about the swimming hole as if the journey was the missing puzzle piece he had been long searching for in his life left us with no doubts or questions. We had to experience this place for ourselves. After all, our trip was in honor of celebrating new chapters in life. It felt so serendipitous. Now, we were well into the hike from hell. At one point, we debated how many days we had been lost. We couldn’t be sure.  

Late into our last night lost, we came across a rocky overlook. Using our headlamps, we looked around, hoping to spot something — anything — to be cheerful about. Sam began to laugh. He couldn’t believe it. We made it to the clandestine watering hole. We actually made it! Meg looked up into the night sky and thanked God. We found water! Below us, we saw the deep pool, our headlamps reflecting on the top of the water’s surface. 

 

I was so tired at this point. I tried hard to focus my eyes on the scene in front of me. Before I could say anything, Sam and Meg jumped off the cliff and into the water, one right after the other. 

 

I dropped to the ground in exhaustion. Nausea took over. I listened for sounds of my friends splashing around below. All I could hear was silence. I suddenly remembered a story I heard about a group lost at sea. After a couple of days, they all started to lose their minds and hallucinate rescue boats. A couple of the men jumped into the water to greet their heroic rescuers and were never seen again. The only survivor was the person who stayed in the broken-down boat, awaiting help. 

 

I breathed deeply and tried to right myself. I thought I could make out the sounds of laughing. Or was it the wind? No, I heard laughing. Joyous laughing. I was certain I could hear Sam and Meg calling my name. I felt relief and hope for the first time in days. Just as I was preparing to jump in and join my relieved friends and too feel the calming waters embrace my sore and tired body, I couldn’t gather the strength to fully stand up. I was too light-headed and weak. And the darkness became dizzying. So dizzying. A sense of motion sickness was rocking me to my core. It was all so overwhelming. All I could do was curl up into a ball and remind myself to breathe. Just breathe. Everything will be OK. You’re safe now. Just breathe. 

All I remember after that was waking up to warm sunshine on my face and looking over the edge of the cliff to see my friends’ bent and broken bodies where welcoming waters hadn’t been at all. 

I won’t bore you with the details of my rescue. To be honest, I don’t remember much of that part of my story. They said I was in shock and severely dehydrated. The hostel had contacted local police after we hadn’t returned to collect our belongings. A search and rescue team guessed that we had set out to find the infamous, mysterious swimming hole and figured they’d find us in the northern side of the backcountry. They were surprised to find us in the complete opposite direction. 

How was I in the opposite direction of the swimming hole when we had been certain we followed the directions given to us, even using our compass on our phones before the batteries died? Did we all somehow mishear the directions? Was this some kind of joke? Did the traveler get confused and say south when he meant north? Did the traveler himself ever even find the swimming hole like he claimed? In my gut, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were somehow some kind of ploy in a more sinister plot. 

All I know for sure is that I deeply regret every decision that led us to going in search of that perilous pool. 

If you are ever traveling and a fellow adventurer at a bar warmly speaks of an unbelievable swimming hole that’s paradise and life-changing if you are able to find it, I beg of you…do not be tempted to listen to this stranger. Do not go seek out this aquatic utopia. Your life might depend on it.
