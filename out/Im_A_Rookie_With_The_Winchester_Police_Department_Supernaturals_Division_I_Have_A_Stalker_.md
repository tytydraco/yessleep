Of course, on top of a blood sucking serial killer, I now have this to deal with.

FML.

If you're new, you can read what I've been covering in my therapy sessions: [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpnsAthenaeum/comments/1gpe8cd/guide_to_im_a_rookie_with_the_winchester_police/)

I might have to move my therapy session up from next week. It’s just been punch after punch these past couple weeks and honestly? I feel like I’m about to crash out.

Which is really disappointing because according to my therapist I’ve been making really good progress. I went down from two sessions a week to two every month for crying out loud!

Addressing the elephant in the title, I’m pretty sure the stalking started sometime after Halloween. I’m not sure when I picked up on it, but it started off small. The quick flicker of a shadow in my peripheral vision. The feeling of being watched or followed, only to find nobody there when I tuned around. The small pit of dread that formed in my stomach after thinking I heard my name being whispered in the wind.

A sense of paranoia started to invade the back of my mind. Deep down I knew something was wrong, but I couldn’t quite place what.

Then everything came to a head the other night. My stalker approached me while I was in my backyard.

It was almost midnight. The sun had long since set. Pale blue light shone from the moon, bouncing off the litany of stars that littered the sky, making them glow ethereally. The celestial beauty was in its waxing gibbous phase. Not quite full, but close. The full moon would show itself in a day or two.

I live out in the woods, on the outskirts of Winchester, far away from people. I know it’s shocking, a self proclaimed city-girl roughing it in the wild. But I gotta say, it’s pretty damn peaceful out here. At least it *was.*

My home is a one story timber frame log cabin that was built in the late eighties. Since it was quite the fixer upper, I got it for dirt cheap. Most of the renovations have been completed though. The last things on my list are to fix the gutters above the porch, paint my bedroom, re-tile the kitchen floors, and fix a pesky leak in the roof.

I’d been out on the back patio sipping on a cold beer, stargazing. My eye particularly gazing upon the Cassiopeia, Orion, and Andromeda constellations. The quiet sounds of nature and the heat radiating off my crackling bonfire, coupled with the scenery, made for a perfectly relaxing activity. Just the thing I needed after an exhausting day at work.

I was on the cusp of falling asleep when something suddenly pulled me to attention. The sound of a stick breaking and leaves gently crunching just beyond the tree line.

I sat up in the green lawn chair I’d been lounging in, sobering up quickly. Slowly, my eyes analyzed the tree line and accompanying surroundings. *”Lucy\~* the wind seemed to whisper, tauntingly.

Then I saw them. Soft glowing yellow eyes. The figure they belonged to loomed beneath the dark depths provided by the trees canopy. Then slowly, they pushed forward, revealing the tip of a glistening black snout. Soon, the moonlight illuminated a large white wolf.

My breath hitched in my throat as the wolf stood there at the edge of my property, watching, waiting. Analyzing. Those piercing eyes gazed right into my soul.

My staring contest with The White Wolf couldn’t have lasted more than thirty seconds, but in the moment it felt like thirty minutes.

A sweet tinkling emanated from the metallic wind chimes that hung on the low branches of my trees as a gentle breeze blew by. On other branches, dangling dream catchers and cedar bundles swayed in tandem with the wind. A slight feeling of relief rushed through me as I was reminded of all the protective wards surrounding my property. Two twin horseshoes were nailed to a pair of old oak trees at the apex of the yard. And every couple of days I’d walk the perimeter of the cabin, replenishing the mountain ash that lined the outside of my home.

With a slight chuff, The White Wolf stood in place and bowed his head while still maintaining eye contact. The look it gave was as if it were trying to say “I’ll get you one day. You’re mine.”

Then, just as suddenly as the creature appeared, it disappeared back into the woods where it came from.

Once again alone, I chugged the rest of my beer and went inside for the night. Paranoia wracked my brain rendering me unable to sleep. Like I was going to anyway after *that* interaction.

The White Wolf definitely wasn’t a regular lupine, my wards proved that fact. If it’s fae or something else, I don’t know. However, I have a sneaking suspicion this might be connected to Demon Dan in some way. But right now he’s like a fart lost in the wind, so…

Anyway, enough about me. You guys don’t come here to solely read about my personal crap. Nah, you come for the action and to see me get my ass handed to me time after time. I get it. I understand.

It’s why I’m still a rookie. I *have* only been at Winchester PD for about eight months now.

Moving on, there’s an update on Rudy, our supposed serial killer. I say supposed because the results came back on the blood we found on his clothes. It wasn’t human but  cervid- deer blood.

That doesn’t mean he isn’t responsible for the deaths of Lana and our other victims. We just needed something concrete to prove it. Sure we have Ms. Walker’s witness testimony, but that’s circumstantial at best. Do you know how easy it is for the brain to misremember things? How easily memories can be misinterpreted, manipulated, and influenced?

And on top of all that, because Rudy is lucid- for the most part- the division doesn’t have grounds for *termination.* He’s a revenant, yes, but so far all we can prove is that he drank Bambi like a god damned Capri-sun.

For now, he’s being kept in one of the maximum security underground holding cells until we can prove he’s our killer or someone from The Court comes along to evaluate his case.

All Dustin and I could do is keep working the case until Rudy revealed something or new evidence surfaced. So that’s exactly what we did.

The morning after my encounter with The White Wolf was a bad one. My mind and body were exhausted from the lack of sleep and overthinking. During the commute to work, I was constantly peeking out the rearview mirror of my car, paranoid that I would spot it again. Standing, staring, analyzing.

I could’ve sworn I heard my name being whispered into my ear in the precinct’s parking lot. A quick look over my shoulder revealed the lot to be desolate of any living things. When I turned back around, the living shit was scared out of me.

“Ow! What the hell, Hale?” Dustin questioned rubbing his sore shoulder in an attempt to relieve the pain. I’d punched the appendage out of reflex after he startled me.“What’s got you so jumpy?”

“Had a bad night,” I replied apologetically.

Dustin pressed his lips together as he got a good look at me in the morning light. Still tending to his shoulder he said, “I can tell. You look like shit.”

“You gotta reason for sneaking up on me this morning, Dustin?” I asked, my lack of sleep making me more irritable than normal. I was seriously debating punching him again in the same spot just for the way he was grinning down at me.

“Well, I’ve been thinking,” he shoved his hands into his pockets to escape from the cold November air, rocking back and forth on the balls of his feet.

“Oh no, should I be worried?” I interjected with a sarcastic smile, heading towards the precinct.

Dustin rolled his eyes, his grin deepened before he followed after me into our place of work. “About Rudy. How we might be able to get something out of him.”

“We’ve both been interrogating him for the past two days, Dustin, and we still can’t get him to say anything,” I had to remind him as we walked through the main corridor after the lobby.

“I understand that, Lucky, but hear me out. Good cop, bad cop?”

I stopped, scoffing after pressing the down button on the elevators. “Let me guess, you want to be bad cop?”

*Ding!* The elevator I summoned reached our floor, the doors gliding open. We both stepped in. “No, actually, I was thinking you could be bad cop on this one. My gut is telling me if you get him upset enough you might lodge something free from his memory.”

Dustin stuck a key into the button panel. With a satisfying click, another hidden panel popped open. The white button lit up with a golden light as he pressed it.

“Don’t tell me you actually believe in that amnesia crap act?” I crossed my arms into my chest as the doors closed.

Davidson shrugged. “I mean… he did turn himself in. He seems like he genuinely doesn’t remember something.”

“I know, but something about him just doesn’t sit right with me.”

The door to the elevator opened as we reached the bottom floor. Dustin stepped out first, and I followed. We walked down a long concrete corridor filled with doors on either end, nearly all the rooms containing some type of dangerous supernatural. The division was still reeling from the events on Halloween night. Plus there seemed to have been an unusual surge of supernatural activity in Winchester which kept the department at almost full capacity.

“It’s probably got to do with the fact that he’s a lucid revenant,” Dustin said dismissively.

I pulled on his wrist, stopping him. He turned to face me. “Exactly my point Dustin. It doesn’t matter that he can talk and think and feel, he’s still a revenant. A blood thirsty, nightmarish killing machine, revenant.”

We stood there like that for a second. Dustin staring into the depths of my serious eyes as I tried to convey just exactly what I was feeling on this. After a moment he nodded, “okay, you’ve made your point.”

A sharp bang against one of the cell doors brought the both of us to attention. The small sliver of glass revealed that it was Audra. She banged and hissed at us through the glass. Guess she was still bitter about being caught.

Dustin and I finished our walk as we arrived at the last door. Using that same set of keys, Dustin twisted it in the lock and pulled the door open.

Two red eyes shown through the darkness of the cell. A sense of Deja Vu crept down my spine as they reminded me of the yellow ones that had stared at me the night before. The light flickered on, revealing Rudy silently sulking on his cot.

Back in one of the precinct’s special interrogation rooms, Dustin was going to town on the Indian-American man. It was my turn to watch and wait as I stood in the adjacent room behind the two-way mirror. Rudy’s dark stubble had almost thickened up into a beard. If he weren’t a monster, I’d say the rugged look suited him well.

He leaned back in the chair, staring blankly at the wall behind Dustin, revealing his figure. Rudy was a short man, but he had some weight on him. The standard grey jumpsuit didn’t show it well, but Rudy had a bit of a dad bod. His arms were thick and muscular but his abdomen was a bit distended with a bit of a beer gut. Although, Rudy was starting to look a bit sickly and emaciated without a constant supply of blood.

After thirty minutes of going nowhere, Dustin decided to tap out. He left the interrogation room, leaving it wide open for me.

“Like I told you and your partner before, I can’t tell you anything,” Rudy mumbled into his chest as I entered the room.

I didn’t say anything, instead, electing to lean against the door. I crossed my arms into my chest and one leg over the other. Silence filled the room as I examined the man.

His eyes were dark. He looked down at the cuffs around his wrists and fumbled with his thumbs. I let him stew in the quiet for a little longer before going at him.

“Tell me, then, Rudy, since you claim to have no recollection of who you are or how you got here, how did you know your name?”

He scoffed ruefully. “It’s not my name, my real one anyway.”

“And how do you know if you can’t remember? Are you lying to me, Rudy?”

His ankle chains rattled as he adjusted himself in his seat, leaning forward on the table instead of the back of his chair. He was getting agitated. “I’m not lying. I just *know* that it isn’t my real name.”

“That sounds ridiculous,” I muttered. “Just like this whole ‘you can’t remember anything’ bit. It’s the oldest trick in the book for criminals like you.”

“You’re right, this whole thing *is* ridiculous!”

“Last I checked you were the one that turned yourself in,” I commented.

“So why am I still here?” He snapped.

I walked over to the table and slammed my palms down on the cool metal, causing him to jump. “You want to go to jail, don’t you?”

Rudy blinked, dumbfounded by the question. “Not particularly, no. B-but I woke up covered in blood. If I hurt someone then I need to face justice.”

Fed up with the nice-guy act and everything else going on in my life, I went full throttle. “Do you think this is some kind of a JOKE?”

That got his attention.

“What do you mean?” he questioned.

“I mean the blood,” I answered. “The blood on your clothes wasn’t human, Rudy. It was deer blood. So, have you been sitting here these past couple days wasting my time for your own sick enjoyment?”

“W-what?” He looked at me confused. “No, I thought…”

I did a quick circle around the table, his eyes following me the whole time. “You thought what, Rudy? Because you really don’t remember feasting on that poor doe’s neck? Sucking and draining it dry of its delicious, delectable, blood?”

A shocked and horrified look filled his eyes, but something else swirled in them too. Hunger. They started to glaze over as he imagined drinking the substance. “No!”

“What about before then, hm? Do you remember draining the life out of that old woman behind the animal shelter?”

Rudy squirmed in his seat. He closed his eyes and turned his head away from me. “No! Stop, please!”

“What about when you followed that poor nursing student into the hospital? Did you enjoy picking the stringy sinew of his neck out of your fangs after you ripped his throat out?” I got up close and personal, “Huh? HUH?”

Rudy whimpered as tears started streaming down his face. I was getting close to striking a nerve. He wouldn’t be reacting this way if he wasn’t guilty.

“DON’T YOU REMEMBER KILLING AND DRAINING THE INNOCENT LIFE OF A FUCKING CHILD? YOU RIPPED HER THROAT OUT AND FILLED YOUR STOMACH WITH HER BLOOD, DIDN’T YOU? BUT THAT WASN’T ENOUGH TO SATISFY YOU WAS IT? YOU WENT AND DRANK BAMBI TOO!”

A pain cry left Rudy’s mouth as he tugged and pulled on his chains in an attempt to get away from me. “Why won’t you believe me? I told you, I don’t know! I can’t remember, I can’t remember *anything!*”

“MAYBE THIS WILL HELP JOG YOUR MEMORY,” in the heat of the moment, I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced a small slit in my wrist, blood instantly started trickling down. I grabbed a tuft of Rudy’s black hair and pushed his head down, making sure he got a good whiff. His warm breath blew on my open wound as he took in the scent, sending a shock down my spine.

**“I told you I DON’T REMEMBER!** Rudy roared as specks of spit flew out of his drooling mouth. His teeth had sharpened into fangs. The pupils in his eyes blew up as the scent of blood permeated up his nose. **“I didn’t want to hurt anyone, I just want to go back to** ***normal!*****”**

Dustin threw open the interrogation room door. “Hale, what the *hell* are you doing?!?”

He pulled me away and out of the interrogation room, leaving the raving revenant to greedily lap up the puddles of blood I’d left behind. Rudy was completely lost in the sauce, snarling and grunting like a wild animal.

The door slammed behind us. Davidson pressed me against the wall, quickly taking his jacket off and wrapping it around my wrists tightly. “l said bad cop not crazy cop!”

I couldn’t help but chuckle weakly. The blood loss was starting to make me dizzy. “Didn’t you hear him in there? He said he wants to go back to normal. That means he must remember something!”

Dustin rubbed his temples furiously. “Hale, seriously, what the fuck? What is going on with y-“

“Hold on, I’m getting a phone call,” I shushed him, sleepily putting my finger to his lips as my phone began to buzz. I pulled the device out of my pocket and answered the call, not bothering to look at the caller ID.

Dustin sighed defeatedly, watching over me cautiously. “This isn’t over, you know. Me and you are going to have a serious conversation about this.”

But I tuned his whispers out.

The words I heard on the other line were enough to get my adrenaline going, rendering my lack of sleep and blood loss null. After her initial call the other day, I reached back out and left Sage Walker a voicemail with my phone number so she could contact me if she remembered anything else about Lana’s murder and seeing the killer. I hadn’t told her we had Rudy in custody.

After the first sentence, I had the mind to put it on speaker so Dustin could hear.

“Officer Hale! Help me, please! I- I just saw him kill again! I think… I think he saw me. Please you have to help, the serial killer is going to come after me next!”

I looked at Dustin, wide-eyed. As Sage continued to ramble over the phone, the two of us looked back in the interrogation room where Rudy sat handcuffed and chained. The revenant was still in our custody.

We turned back to each other, pale as ghosts, because whoever Sage saw out there wasn’t Rudy.

And if Rudy *wasn’t* our serial killer then that begs the question of: *Who is?*
