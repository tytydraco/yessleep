Grave robbing is not a glamorous act. To wrest away any valuables attached to a corpse is by all means depraved, not to mention the horror brought upon a family who discovers their loved one’s final resting place has been desecrated. It’s safe to say the ethics of performing such a thing are dubious at best. Then again, what use do the dead have for jewelry and keepsakes? Wouldn’t their utility be far greater on the living, and especially for those who are in need of money? That was how I justified it for the longest time. I thought that, if anything, it was selfish of those families to waste such valuables on glorified fertilizer rather than giving back to their community. I look back on such thoughts with contempt, even if I can understand that desperation can bring cruelty out of the most golden hearts. Cruel acts seem so reasonable when we’re the ones doing them.

The reason I stopped was not related to a reevaluation of my morals, or some grand epiphany. I was very much the same person before and after in terms of my values, at least for a while. It was by pure chance that I stopped. One singular event spurred the end of my illicit activities. Winning the bad lottery, so to speak. I want to preface by saying that although I may not be brave, I am rarely frightened. Hanging around corpses long enough tends to desensitize you. When I say I was rattled to my core, I really do mean it. It will always amaze me how much can change in one night.

It was not an unusual job. Some rich family’s son had supposedly died in his sleep. I don’t remember the details exactly, but it was chalked up to a condition of the heart. Whatever the case, the likelihood of him being buried with jewelry was high given the family owned a company which sold rings and necklaces. They were also the type to flaunt their wealth. Although the business of grave-robbing tends to rely on assumptions, even one particularly valuable ring can ensure that you don’t have to work for years. In my young mind, it was worth the risk and uncertainty. I had scored before, so I had no reason to give up for a more ethical profession, if you can even call it a profession. 

This was a time where security cameras were not as widespread as they are now, so I often acted recklessly. Normally I wouldn’t go for such a fresh grave, but I really needed the money if the guy was indeed buried with something valuable. It was slightly past midnight by the time I got to the cemetery. I remember thinking it to be odd that the family had him buried in some random cemetery instead of their family plot, but brushed it off. It didn’t matter much to me at the time. In fact, it made my job a whole lot easier, as breaking into a rich family’s plot would be far more risky. Some of those places have actual security.

I already knew where the grave was courtesy of a visit I made in the daylight. I learned over time that scoping out the place beforehand can do wonders, as having to locate a grave in the dark is infuriating. Constantly scanning over names like I was in *The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly* was a mistake I only made once. There were stars visible above me as I trudged through the muddy ground towards the back of the cemetery. They would be the only witnesses to the sinful act I was about to take part in. 

By the time I reached the grave, I was exhausted. I hefted the shovel over my right shoulder and took a moment to breathe. It struck me in that instant just how quiet the place was. I know full well that the dead tell no tales, but not even the insects made their presence known. To say it was eerie would be an understatement. A certain dread gripped me as I soberly realized that I will find a place underneath the ground someday. It could very easily be me in one of those boxes, hidden away from sunlight and starlight. There is a certain cruelty in the fact that the dead are banished to an eternity in darkness after bearing through the pains life has to offer. What if our consciousness stayed stuck in our body after death, forever doomed to languish in a coffin’s confines? I grimaced at that thought, then pierced the shovel’s head through the Earth’s soft skin, making my entrance wound.

The digging was always the worst part. The monotony and strain for only a chance at a reward. It was like playing the lottery sometimes. There was of course the aftermath, too. Even the most hardened individual may feel at least a little guilt when they unearth someone’s loved one for nothing. In such cases, my usual justifications wouldn’t work. I was simply traumatizing people’s families. When you dig, you have time to think. Each shovel strike was another opportunity for a pang of guilt to encircle my mind. The only relief comes when the shovel hits against wood. Then the excitement comes in. The excitement of what you might find, and the dread of there being nothing of note.

As I cracked open the coffin, another feeling entirely gripped me. It started with a pit in my stomach as the smell wafted out of the opening. I had to turn my head to the side to vomit, yellowish bile bubbling against and staining the dirt. It smelled of piss. It smelled of shit. Worst of all, it smelled of fresh death. Hunters may be familiar with that stench, especially when approaching the corpse of a recent kill. There’s nothing like it. 

Once my revulsion subsided, I opted to plug my nose as I got closer to the open coffin. I wanted to take a closer look. Something was very wrong, and somebody clearly hadn’t done their job properly. Hell, the family was rich enough that they had their own mortician, so what the fuck had happened? I was overcome with horror as I shined a flashlight onto the body. It was the eyes. They were milky and wide open. His face was contorted in the sort of terror I had never seen on another human being. His chin was encrusted with old vomit. I had to turn away.

I was in denial. He had to have been dead when they buried him. Stuff like that just doesn’t happen. I was going to close that coffin, fill the grave to the best of my ability, and leave. I should’ve just run then and there, but no, I just had to clean up the scene. The truth became clear to me when I went to put the lid back on the coffin, as I spared one last look. There were broken fingernails, stained with blood that now looked brown. After that, the scratch marks on the inside of the lid hardly registered to me. 

I’ve thought about the incident a lot ever since I cleaned up my life. It just made no sense to me how such an oversight could occur, even with the more limited technology of the 80’s. People being buried alive was meant to be a thing of the far past. With such a wealthy family, how could such a thing have occurred? Did they even view the body before consigning it to the ground? A certain conclusion came to me after giving it enough thought. What happened to that boy was deliberate. His own family saw to it that he was buried that way. I can never know the why, but I don’t see how else it could’ve occurred.

It’s so hard to believe that there is good in the world now. To know that I added to the bad haunts my dreams. Sometimes, I wake up in a cold sweat. I have nightmares, where instead of the stars in the sky, I see nothing but hard wood above me. People walk over me without ever knowing I’m there. I scream, but the blanket of dirt is louder. As the air thins, I scratch against my enclosure with abandon. My fingernails chip and peel, before one comes off entirely. I always wake up after that, but I fear one day I won’t be so lucky. Living or dead, my body will find its way to a box eventually. It is that which scares me more than anything.

To be entombed in the dirt of the Earth, so uncaring to those who inhabit it.
