Over the years, I’ve found a lot of crazy shit inside dead people. A penny from 1932 lodged in an old man’s small intestine, probably for decades. A knife blade that broke off in an abdomen and stayed there for two years. Bottle caps. Gum. Rocks. A My Little Pony (I think it was Rainbow Dash.)

But this was the first time I’d ever found books.

The deceased must have put a decent amount of work into ingesting them. The pages had been cut from their bindings and rolled in tight columns, then placed in several greased plastic bags and shoved down the esophagus fairly violently. None of that was fatal, of course.

The rest of my analysis caught a gunshot wound, subcutaneous bruising and shattered bones suggesting a fall from a great height, and finally, significant liquid in the lungs. No surprise there, as they’d pulled the body from the harbor.

Based on these findings, I concluded that the deceased likely was shot in the back while walking on a bridge and subsequently fell several hundred feet into the water.

For some reason though, I hesitated to mention the swallowed pages in my official coroner’s report. Truth be told, I’d opened a bag and read the first few sentences of page one, right there next to the body:

*In the year 1601, with the help of a half-dead bloodhound, I discovered the 4th stairway to hell. Two years later, I would begin my descent to That Fiery Place. What follows is a true account of that adventure.*

The sentences were captivating, but even more striking was the title page. The work was called *Don Servante* and attributed to Miguel de Certvantes with a publication date of 1611, translated by Thomas Goodwell in 1665.

As I continued to flip through the pages, it became immediately clear that it was a work of fiction–and one of the best things I’d ever read. Leading through to the end, I saw that the book ended mid-sentence: it was only a partial manuscript.

Quickly, I tore up the other bags, hoping to find the rest of the novel. Instead, I found two wholly different works. One was a longish short story by Edgar Allan Poe entitled “The Wrath of the Earthworm.” It chronicled a man’s experience being buried alive and his ongoing argument with an earthworm waiting for his demise. It had been a while since I’d read Poe, but I felt with some certainty, that this was by far the best thing of his I’d ever read.

The third manuscript was a novel written in the late 90’s by an author named Sara Knave, who I’d never heard of. It seemed to be about a group of teenage girls who spent their last summer of high school working at a haunted amusement park. As soon as I started reading it, I couldn’t stop. Whoever Cameron Knave was, she had the horror chops of Stephen King and the literary virtuosity of Cormac McCarthy. It seemed impossible that she hadn’t been a bestselling phenomenon.

Yet when I searched for her name on Google, I couldn’t find a single hit. As far as the internet was concerned, she didn’t exist. The same was true for Poe’s story and Cervantes’s book. Not a single reference existed for either one.

I surreptitiously stashed all three manuscripts in my backpack and tossed the bags they’d come in. Then I filed the official report without any mention of the corpse’s stomach or its contents.

Back at home after work, I opened my backpack and devoured all three books. Coming off of them, I was buzzing with excitement–and furious that they were *all* only partially complete. I was left with Cervantes’s narrator sitting down to a tea party with the devil. With Poe’s protagonist finally clasping the worm with his left pinky. With Knave’s main character facing off with a possessed boyfriend in a hall of mirrors.

Of course, as soon as I’d finished reading I got online and checked every resource I could. Google again yielded nothing. Same with Quora and Reddit. I even tried Bing. None of them mentioned a single reference to any of the books.

Desperate, I scrolled through old Facebook contacts, half-remembering an old high school girlfriend who’d gone on to get a PhD in English lit. She was married now, with a kid, and it took about four hours for me to think of a way to reach out that didn’t feel creepy.

*Mark D.: Hi Claudia! Long time no talk! I happened to come into possession of a few books by some famous authors (and one unknown) that I have some questions about. Not really my area of expertise! Any chance I could get your eye on these? Not sure if you’re still local.*

*Claudia M.: Hi Mark. Surprised you still remembered me. Depends on the authors. I’m focused mostly on Mexican-American literature, specifically poetry. Seems unlikely that you found anything like that…*

*Mark D.: Well, one is a translation of Cervantes. I know he’s Spanish, so maybe that's related? Seems like previously unknown work.*

*Claudia M.: I’m listening…*

It turns out that Claudia was working at the University of Oregon, up in Eugene, just a few of hours north of Klamath Falls. I made the drive up there the next weekend, and we met in the university library. She was definitely older now but still as gorgeous as when we’d dated for a few months sophomore year. Not that she was interested in anything like that. Claudia was all business.

“That manuscript,” she said. “Let me see it.”

I handed it over, and she sat down at a table. She was immediately engrossed, reading the book with the same concentration I might exhibit craving through a sternum.

Finally, she looked up at me, her eyes wide.

“If this is real,” she said. “This is probably the most important literary discovery in a hundred years. This could completely change the way we see Spanish literature. World literature. This… this is like the literary missing link. Connective tissue that links Dante to the modern novel. It… also might be the first horror novel ever created.” She took a deep breath. “Where’s the rest of it?”

“That’s all I’ve got,” I said.

“Can you get the rest?” she asked.

I shook my head.

“I… found it in a kind of unusual circumstance,” I said.

“If we had the rest of it…. This could be world changing,” she said. “Did you say you had other manuscripts?”

I nodded and provided her the others. She read both with rapt attention, like a starving person thrown a wagyu steak. She didn’t speak a word to me for hours until she’d read every word of both partial manuscripts.

“Each of these, on its own, would constitute a literary earthquake,” she said, almost shaking. “Together… together they suggest something more.”

“Like what?” I asked.

“Like a private collection,” she said. “A private collection stretching back centuries, potentially containing several of the greatest literary works ever known.” She was almost hyperventilating now.

“Do you need some water or something?” I asked. I was trying to be chivalrous. I was also starting to remember how nice it had felt to kiss her by the lake after homecoming. How soft her lips had felt. How nice it felt now to be bringing her something that made her salivate.

“Can I keep these?” I asked, but I shook my head.

“Sorry,” I said. “I feel like I should hold onto them.”

Suddenly, she grabbed my arm, her eyes wild. She leaned in close.

“Get the rest of these books,” she said. “We could change the world. These are… good. Great. They might be amongst the best things I’ve ever read. If the rest of the world didn’t get a a chance to read these, it would be–”

“I understand,” I said, picking up the manuscripts. “I do.”

Of course, there was nothing I could do. I took the books home and reread them. They really were quite good. I was no expert, but I liked to read. All three, even incomplete, captured my attention in a way no other book had for years.

Unfortunately, I knew, I would have never found the rest. I would never find out more. The idea of it filled me with an odd dread. There were certain questions in life that you needed answered before you died. Had your childhood crush ever felt the same way? Did you parents truly prefer your brother over you? And what happened at the end of these fucking books. Somehow, this questions had become more important than any other.

For days, I couldn’t sleep. I tried to make up my own endings, but all of it seemed trite, contrived. I was sure the masters had come up with superior endings, endings I needed to read. And yet, what hope was there of me ever finding out?

And as I tossed, sleepless, another thought hit me: whoever owned these novels must have tried very hard to make sure they weren’t stolen. I thought of the body I’d found, the bullets piercing his back. Whoever he was, he’d gone to great lengths to smuggle these books out in his stomach, and he’d paid the ultimate price. Was I willing to push it that far? To do whatever it took to know the endings?

Then, two nights later, I got a knock on the door. I opened it to find thing man in a blue pinstripe suit holding a hunting knife in his right hand.

“So sorry about this,” he said. “But it’s come to our attention that you have something that belongs to the library. We’ll need it back.”

I backed up into my living room. I’d seen enough bodies to know how my autopsy might read. Two stab wounds to the chest, causing a cessation of cardiovascular function. The victim put up little fight, likely due to the sudden nature of the attack.

“Please,” I said. “I’m happy to comply with whatever demands–”

I was stumbling over my words, barely able to hear my own thoughts. For all the dead bodies I’d seen, I’d never really imagined myself joining them. In truth, I was a coward. I’d been challenged to two fights in high school and run away from both, much to the derision of my peers. After that, I’d lost the few friends I’d had. Dating was an impossibility. My life was a joke.

“Just give me the manuscripts,” said the man. “Then we can talk.”

My heart was pounding. Fear gripped me like the hand of a ghost, reaching through my chest, squeezing my heart with its icy fingers.

And yet, strangely, the thought that came to my mind wasn’t that I was afraid to die: it was that I didn’t want to go before I finished the three stories. What happened to Don Servante at his tea party with Lucifer? Did Poe’s narrator defeat the worm? And who survived the the haunted amusement park. If I died, I’d never know.

“You can’t let me live,” I said after a few seconds. “You can’t let me talk any more about what I’ve read.”

The man met my eye, his expression suddenly deadly serious.

“So you told someone,” he said. “No matter. Must have missed it in our first look. We’ll find out who. Easier if you tell us, of course.”

That’s when I reached into the open bag by my side and pulled out a scalpel. I brought it home more often than you’d think. Sometimes I’d used it to practice on an orange or a piece of leather. I made the cleanest cuts of anyone at the coroner’s office.

“You don’t want to go this road,” said the man. “Even if you were to beat me, there are others who would follow. The end result is inevitable.”

He took a step toward me, knife in hand.

"Out of curiosity," he said. "Before I kill you. Why did you take the stories from the corpse? It would have been easy enough to just turn them into your bosses. This could have all just gone away. Now, unfortunately, you have to go. I don't relish this. It's just the way it has to be."

“That’s the thing,” I said. “I don’t need to live forever. I just want to find out how the stories end.”

And so, for the first time in my life, I didn’t run. Instead, I rushed at him, scalpel in hand.

We both stabbed forward, but only one of us had pierced a thousand bodies. Only one of us knew the perfect spot to stab a human heart.

And so, a minute later, I sat in the living room next to his body. I was bleeding from a minor stab wound to the abdomen. He’d hit nothing critical. For all his talk, he ended up being an amateur. And as I sat there bleeding, I searched his pockets and found his wallet.

There was an ID, probably fake. A useless credit card. I tossed it aside. Then finally, I found what I’d been looking for all along: a library card. A membership to a very private collection downtown.

I texted Claudia with a picture and a smiley face.

We were going to read the end of these stories, [even if it killed us.](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/)
