Part One^^^


I hate that I have to post again. I kept trying to convince myself it was just a weird dream from the stress of that stupid empty reddit link, but I still feel that frigid water sometimes. I feel Laika's warmth. When I think about it, I'm almost comforted by the fact that she wasn't cold like a specter. She felt human, as warm and soft as I expected her to be in real life. Her voice wasn't distorted by a shitty microphone on her cell and laptop, which are the only devices I had ever heard it on. I haven't told anyone in my life. I feel like I'm losing it. My friends have noticed that my responses are short, and a bit dry, and I'm trying to work on it, to mask my insanity more successfully but I can't. Here I am again, begging strangers for help. 

No one commented saying that they had any info on the story, but maybe if I push a little harder I'll find something. There has to be some little fragment of information that could crack this all open, or at least that's my hope. I'll talk more about it later in this post, but I found a fragment of a fragment. A crumb, if you will, and it came from Liv of all people. 

I haven't talked much about Liv, but I'll tell you what's necessary to know about her. Next to myself, she was probably the second closest person to Laika. She didn't have a phenomenal childhood and also hails from eastern europe. I guess I'll reveal that Laika is Russian. I won't say exactly where, and I still won't share her last name, but Liv gave me permission to talk about her  own life story online. She's kind of the only one I've told about what's going on. Not in full detail, though. I told her that I had been having strange dreams about Laika, and she responded very interestingly. When I say that Liv is a sensitive girl, I'm not just talking about her personality. I know I mentioned it before, but Liv is deeply emotional. She may be silly, and hate criticism, and cry whenever she feels like she's done something wrong, but she claims to be sensitive in a very special way. When Liv was younger, she said she saw a ghost. 

Her grandmother who was very close to her passed away when she was 6 years old (she's 21 now if that matters). I think that's when things started to go wrong in her life. Her slavic parents were very, very religious and huffed at the fact that their daughter could be some sort of pagan ankle-biter, and apparently they never saw her the same way when she told them about the fully clothed woman in their bathtub. After little Liwia came out screaming that a lady in black was wasting all of her hot bath water, I don't think they ever treated her right again. I personally have a very different outlook on ghosts and spirits ever since my experience in that starry abyssal lake, and now I finally think I believe her. We all made poked fun at her for this when she first came out about it, and I deeply regret that now. The things that go bump in the night suddenly seem real to me, like a part of my life I'm gonna have to deal with until the day I die. I'll always be waterlogged by Laika.


"r, u are safe wit meeee. have u ever tried 2 lucid dream? maybe that's wat it was. yew spent so long flipping about the story stuffs... maybe yer subconscious gave u a freaky dream 0-o", she messaged. Maybe she was right. It honestly made a lot of sense. I had spent a long time thinking about Laika. She was always on my mind, and it was strange that she had never made a guest appearance in my dreams since she disappeared. Maybe being freaked out about the story brought her to the front of my mind and conjured up some bizarre dream. That was the only reasonable explanation.

"i've only ever lucid dreamt abt the back of Laika's head... i wish i got 2 see her..." Liv typed.

"not like i did. you don't wanna see her like that, i promise." 

Liv didn't respond for a while, and it made me feel crazy. Did something I said set her off? Did I scare her away? Why was I having all of these anxieties about my friendship with a girl who has never once been mad at me in the years I've known her? My experiences were starting to fuck with my head in a serious way. It got even worse on the first day after submitting my movie for review. I should have known it wasn't just a dream, and I should have told everyone how I was feeling and what I was seeing before the incident. I know I'm not crazy. I'm sure of it, because now I have evidence. 

As you may know from my last post, I made a movie called Vampiric Undead Robots 3 for my final project in school, which I miraculously was able to finish despite everything going on. It's stupid as all hell, featuring two big breasted robot vampires who go around sucking the brains and blood out of an evil legion of incels, and the most palatable part of it is the romantic aspect. I got a pretty good grade on it, but that doesn't matter. I only got my grades back for it last night. I noticed something incredibly strange when I checked the notes. There was one moment in particular that my film teacher really loved, and it was a moment I have absolutely no memory of ever writing or conceptualizing. Apparently, about halfway through the second act, there is a shot of myself.

I sat through the film again, waiting to see whatever masterful last minute edit I made that impressed Professor Kapinski so much, and wouldn't you have it, there I was, 53 minutes in. 

"She's here, I just can't prove it," I whispered into the camera. I pointed the camera towards my shower, and there was a blue light bouncing around behind my shower curtain. I could hear the water running, and the footage was strangely grainy. As soon as it started, it was over and back to the stupid B movie I had worked my ass off on. What in the fuck was that? I watched it over and over again. The light went down, then up, then to the right, down again. It went down once more, and the footage cut. After hours of rewinding I tried to call Liv again.

To my surprise, she answered.

"Hiiiii," she said sleepily into the mic. My heart swelled. It was Liv. My sweet, thick accented Liv. She was talking to me again. 

"Liv, I'm gonna need you to tell me about your ghost."

"What about her?" She yawned into the mic.

"Anything you remember. Please." There was a moment of silence, and then she agreed.

"Well, she was a woman. Not too tall or anything. Her skin was pale, and her hair was short. Wait. I'm remembering wrong. Hold on." She went quiet for a long time. I sat patiently, waiting for the image to be painted out for me, to fill the shoes of poor little Liv staring a ghost dead in the eyes, but it didn't come.

"Liv?" I said into the mic.

"Huh?~" she said even sleepier than before. She had pulled a classic Liv move and fell asleep mid sentence. I rolled my eyes.

"Liv, please, it's really important."

"Okay... Um. She was young, in track pants and a tank top. I thought she was a cousin or something."

What? This went against everything I had ever thought about Liv's ghost. I had always imagined her as an old victorian type woman, wrinkly and... Well, old. I imagined her all buttoned up in some black night gown, not athleisure. 

"Since when was she young?" I asked. 

"Since... Wait. Maybe she was old. I'm- I'm really confused about it now. I remembered it perfectly until now," she said. I imagined her scratching her blonde head in confusion. Suddenly, a video call was coming in. I answered. There she was, in her Hello Kitty pajamas. I hadn't seen her face in a while. It was comforting, as always.

"Liv, have you ever seen orbs, or specters, or anything like that. She cocked her head in thought. 

"You look like shit, are you okay? What's wrong?" She asked, her brown doe eyes staring into me, gapped teeth poking out from her plump, gaped lips. I checked myself in the corner of the video call and gasped. My under eye bags were purple, eyeliner smeared all over. My dark hair was sticking up in five different places, and my eyes were bloodshot. It was just like she said. I looked like utter shit. 

"We can talk about this after you get some sleep Lucy." She real named me. I sighed deeply.

"Please Liv," I said, breath shaking. She sighed back and then nodded.

"Okay. I used to see little blue orbs in the bathroom. Behind the shower curtain." My bloodshot eyes went wide. I scrambled to my feet and grabbed my computer, opening up the footage from my movie. I pointed my phone at the screen and hit play. I watched closely as the orb scattered across the screen again, and I think it hit us both at the same time.

"They spelled out-"

"Hi. It spelled hi."

"I've never seen such clear footage before. You need to submit this somewhere. But are you okay?"

"I'm fine. Thanks Liv," I said before hanging up. Soon enough, after panting heavily at the foot of my bed, I passed out.

When I woke up, there was a light shining in my eyes. Several, actually. My room was covered in little shining blue orbs, like bioluminescent jellyfish floating before my eyes. I stood up, trying to touch one, but my hand passed right through it. I walked over to my window, and horrifically, I saw nothing. Just pure, undeniable blackness. I stepped back, terrified to fall into the void, and heard something amiss in my room. The water in the bathroom was running. Before I made my way to the bathroom, I stopped in my tracks. 

A shadow sat cross legged on my bed, in the very center. I stared it down, unblinking, scared of what would happen if I looked away. It stuck out a skinny, foggy arm at me, and I mindlessly stepped forward, crawling onto my bed, towards the shadow that taunted me. 

"Hi" I heard echo through my room. 

"Hi" I said back, perplexed by the beauty of all of these shining blue orbs in my room, and the form of the shadow, reaching its hand out for me to hold. I tried to grab on, scrambling at the cold black fog, unable to catch it until I remembered something Liv said. A lucid dream. Yes! That could work. I focused my mind, shutting my eyes tight, trying to bring my dreams to life. Suddenly, I felt a cold hand wrap around mine, soaking wet. I opened my eyes and there she was.

"Laika..." I said softly, staring at her illuminated face in the dark. She smiled back.

"You're getting better at this," She said, a sad smile plastered on her face.

"At what? What is this? Where are you?" I begged for answers, squeezing her dripping wet hand. 

"Don't make it bad, Lucy," she said, rubbing my shoulder with her other wet hand. 

"Make it bad?" I asked, confused to hell and back. The orbs started to multiply, flying out from my open bathroom door, swirling around Laika. She looked scared for a moment, but shook it off. I watched as her face flickered with light rapidly, enough to give an epileptic a seizure. 

"I love you. I'm sorry for the water," she said, squeezing onto me tightly in a hug. 

"No, no. Don't leave!" I begged her. She smiled against my shoulder.

"This place isn't for you, Lucy," she said. My eyes flew open and I catapulted forward into my pillow, scrambling for her. It was light out. I was in my bed. It was another dream. 

"What the fuck..." I mumbled to myself, gathering myself a little before I felt it. I was soaking wet. I knew it. I knew these were more than just dreams, and I knew it even more when I stood to go to the bathroom and ate shit, falling on my ass. Footprints. Wet footprints, leading to my bed. My fucking shower was on, full blast, cold water pumping out. This was the final straw I needed. 

Rushing to my phone, I was careful not to disrupt any more of the wet footprints while I called Liv. After I showed her the shower, the footprints, and my dripping wet self, I asked the big question.

"So Liv, do I have a ghost?"

"Undeniably."
