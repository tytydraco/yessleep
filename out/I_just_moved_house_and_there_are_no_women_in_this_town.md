Other than me.

On the day of the property viewing, that wasn’t the case. These streets were bustling with men, women, boys, and girls. It felt like any ordinary town. Cul-de-sacs branched off from the main strip. Cosy pockets of red-bricked homes and cobblestone streets. There was a local drinking hole named after some animal or monarch — amusing that it’s often one or the other, though I’m not calling the two things synonymous. It had every ingredient of a quintessentially-British settlement.

One month later, however, I returned to a very different place. Moving day — ‘Moving Monday’ as I called it — was overwhelming for exactly thirty-seven reasons, and the emptiness of the town didn’t make the list. My ever-growing list of things to remember.

*What a waste of a day off*, I thought.

Anyway, I wasn’t concerned by the lack of women. In fact, I hardly noticed the lifelessness at first. After all, I arrived a little after lunchtime on a weekday, so I assumed most people were at work.

In place of its true name, I’ll call the town ‘Propagate’. That word was written with blue paint in large, uneven capitals on a low-level wall. Several truant schoolboys sat atop that bricked partition, which separated a small, detached house from the main road. A dozen legs swinging back and forth like a row of pistons. They had an odd energy, given they were rule-breakers. An energy neither giddy nor intimidating. But the blank-eyed boys *did* keenly watch my car as it drove by.

That sighting was only the first oddity. There was also the young man walking the cocker spaniel. The five elderly gentlemen at the bus stop. The neighbour standing with both arms around his two sons — they watched from the front lawn as I pulled into the driveway of my new home.

As I said, I noticed the quietness, but it didn’t concern me. The lack of women might’ve triggered warning sirens in normal brains. Brains with a little common sense. But I was completely oblivious. An awe-stricken, first-time homeowner with a bulky moving van in tow.

Don’t judge me yet. I’m not, by any means, the bluntest blade in the knife block — just the least even. I was hardly surprised by the autism diagnosis in high school, as I’d always been a little rusty when it came to, as my dad called it, the ‘real world’. People and politics. The fuzziness of social science. My mind has always belonged to rigid sciences.

Let me put it this way: I have a PhD in Chemical Engineering, but I once let a tittering teenager and his pack of hooded friends ‘borrow’ my phone.

“Oh dear! Of *course* I’ll let you ring your mother to pick you up,” I obliviously said.

That was how I waved goodbye to my brand-new iPhone.

I’m smart-dumb or dumb-smart. Take your pick. Stephen Gawking, the trio of school bullies used to call me. It took their one collective brain cell to come up with it, but it was a good one. I’m surprised they even knew what ‘gawking’ meant.

Anyway, moving to Propagate was supposed to be a turning point. I was determined to prove everybody wrong. My friends in the city. My family back home. I wanted to show them that I wasn’t a socially-stunted egghead. I had *the stuff*, whatever *the stuff* might be. The independence and street smarts of my peers, I suppose. I turned 27 this year, so I knew it was time to make something of myself.

And that certainly happened in Propagate.

After only half an hour, the two movers had unloaded all of my belongings, and they left me alone. I heard one of them mutter about a strange look from a neighbour. Given what would follow, they were right to flee.

I spent the next few hours sorting through my belongings, but my mind soon started to wander. I needed something less mind-numbing to do, so I decided to spend the rest of my day exploring Propagate.

I took a stroll to the nearest convenience store, hoping to familiarise myself with the layout of my new hometown. And as I left suburbia behind, Propagate’s true nature revealed itself to me.

I entered a main street littered with dozens upon dozens of townsmen. Far more than there had been on my street. And there came a twisted feeling in my belly. Even an atypical mind like mine knows when it’s outnumbered.

It was an infestation of suited business types, schoolboy clusters, and dog-walkers. There was no longer any avoiding it. The fear. The feeling of eyes dancing across my flesh. And once I realised that heads were *swivelling* to track my movements, I scurried across the road to enter a store on my right.

Things were worse inside.

On the street, there had been options. Routes of escape. Even as an autistic woman, I’ve acquired the social skills necessary to detect when the male gaze tips from icky to *sticky*. When it glues so industrially to your skin that you sense impending, inescapable danger. When you realise that the watching man or men might want to do more than look.

That early evening, mere minutes before the sun merged with the horizon, I felt utterly and entirely alone. I had only an inch of daylight on my side. I didn’t feel safe.

I *wasn’t* safe.

And, as I said, I had hoped things would be better inside the convenience store, but they weren’t. I’d only thrust myself into a more claustrophobic arena of prowling eyes.

What terrified me so greatly was that the eyes hardly looked like eyes at all. Eyes can’t hurt you. But the town’s many sets of spheres were alive. Hundreds of spheres connected to one unified horror. And whatever thing followed me, disguised as countless pairs of pupils, it promised a nightmare.

*Would you rather be alone in the woods with a bear or a man?*

That question rang in my head, and I thought about a third option. Something neither man nor beast. Whatever that thing might’ve been, I was already alone with it.

A supermarket worker, name-tag reading ‘Mike’, eyed me from a few yards away\*.\* He looked sick. Not sick with lust. Not even sick with a common cold. His eyes were swollen, appearing too large for the sockets in which they lived. And his skin bore stretch marks, as if bulging from the pressure of something. A terrible thing below Mike’s flesh, settling alongside his skeleton and organs.

Now, I’ve been stalked and even manhandled before. I wasn’t new to the fear of strange men. But this was something else. A scenario above the pay-grade of my primitive fear response.

Strangers were stopping in their tracks. That was what unsettled me. It was if they had been skewered by poles protruding from the ground. As if each man had been forced, by something beyond his control, to endlessly pivot. To follow me with a cutting gaze.

“Nadia?” a static female voice called.

Relief and fright simultaneously seized my body. Relief at having heard the voice of another woman, but fright at the mystery of its origin. My eyes eventually slid downwards, and I realised that I had, half-consciously, heard my phone ring several seconds earlier. Realised that I’d answered the call with a shaking thumb, though I’d barely been aware of doing so.

I was relieved to see that my screen read ‘Chloe’.

“Nadia?” my friend repeated. “Did you answer by accident? Let me talk a little louder… *Nadia, I’m trapped in your pocket! Help!*”

I smiled, thankful tears collecting in my eyes. With Chloe’s colourful voice to accompany me, I wasn’t alone.

Still quivering, I lifted the phone up to my ear. I didn’t want my friend to worry about me. Didn’t want her to know that I’d stumbled at the first hurdle of independence. Like nearly every other adult in the world, I had to feign normality. Putting on a brave voice took significant masking, but it was a skill that I’d mastered over the years.

“I’m here,” I said, before uttering a faux laugh. “Sorry. It must’ve been my *gyatt* that answered.”

Chloe snorted. “Where are you, bitch? You stood me up.”

*Ah*, I thought.

I’d invited my oldest, dearest friend to visit my new home after work. That was one of the thirty-seven things I was supposed to remember, but I’d entirely forgotten, as is typical of me. The serotonin overload of becoming a homeowner had wiped my brain. Happiness and fear frazzle my thoughts equally.

“You forgot, didn’t you?” asked Chloe.

“No…” I lied. “I just nipped to the supermarket to get us food and drinks.”

“A likely story,” she replied in a chipper tone. “It’s okay, Nads. I forgive you. Just bring some vino back for your dear friend, okay? She’s shivering on the porch. Talking about herself in the third-person.”

I grinned, making my way down the liquor aisle. Chloe’s distracting voice enveloped me like a warm blanket. She helped me to temporarily forget about the many watching eyes. And I soothed the remaining ache in my chest with a little sensory stimulation. Let my fingers brush against the bottles of Sauvignon blanc on the middle shelf. Let my gaze brush against the price labels beneath.

“I hear you, girl,” my friend said. “You’re drooling over the dirt-cheap brands.”

“It just seems unnecessary to buy an expensive bottle,” I pointed out. “They’re all the same, really.”

Chloe groaned and replied, “They are *not* all the same. Do I need to come down there and pick for us?”

*No*, I inwardly pleaded, tuning into my environment once more.

As much as I craved her company, I didn’t fancy the idea of *doubly*-hungry eyes salivating at the only signs of female life.

“I’ll buy a good one,” I promised. “See you in ten minutes or so.”

“Okay,” Chloe said. “See ya.”

I wanted to scream for her to stay on the line, but my friend hung up before my lips had even parted. And then I returned to the reality of my situation.

After I put my phone in my pocket, I scanned both ends of the shop. In the aisle adjacent to mine, an elderly gentleman was lightly tapping a box of oatmeal with wrinkled fingers, but his eyes were facing me. I noticed his walking cane on the tiles below. He’d let it clatter to the floor at some point. His free hand hovered aimlessly, and his fingers were curling in a groping motion. Not for the cane that he’d been holding. For *me*.

I drew blood from my bottom lip, tightly biting it to stifle a slight whimper of horror, then I spun my head back to the line of liquor. After taking a mid-range wine, only wanting to get out of that place, I turned to leave. But my uncoordinated fingers knocked a bottle beside it. As it started to topple, I watched in panic, bombarded by a nightmarish vision of strewn glass and red liquid. By a vision of every last townsman converging on my location to inspect the commotion.

I was thankful, of course, when the wine did not fall. Thankful until I realised that the tilted bottle was suspended in mid-air.

Realised that a set of bulky fingers were wrapped around it.

The hand came from within the sea of bottles. And I knew I shouldn’t, but I instinctively squatted to look through the gap between two shelves. Followed the black-sleeved arm to the next aisle. To the stranger who had stretched his arm through the shelving unit to catch the bottle. A man whose face was not revealed, for he rose far above the middle shelf. I saw only his midsection. An unbuttoned blazer and a second hand. An open palm frozen in the shape of a high-five or a wave.

When the hand did move, it did not offer a friendly gesture. It started to walk — nearly *run* — across the middle shelf. Started to cross the bridge between our two aisles. And it was not shooting towards a second toppling bottle. It was shooting towards me.

I screamed, clutched my chosen wine, then dashed out of the aisle. Dashed towards the self-checkout registers at the right-hand side of the store. I hoped, by doing the scanning myself, that I would avoid any more of the unnerving townsmen.

“May I help you?” a watching member of staff asked oppressively, not cooperatively.

“I’m fine,” I said, before wincing at the *‘Are you over 21?’* message on the touchscreen.

The supermarket worker took slow strides over to my register, then swiped a card to give me permission. The smiling man stood far too close to me, exhaling puffs of cheese and onion. A pungent aroma that, horribly, concealed something even worse beneath. A scent I didn’t manage to place.

“You hardly look 21, my dear,” he softly said. “But I’ll allow it.”

“I’m 27,” I shakily promised, fumbling in my purse for some form of identification.

The man shushed me, lifting a finger towards my lips but stopping just shy of touching them. And as I looked at his face, I saw what I had seen in Mike. A wrong face.

The worker inhaled deeply. “You will grow. Yes. You’ll grow.”

I thwacked my card against the reader, bagged the wine, then strolled speedily out of the store.

Even with eyes firmly locked upon my shoes, I felt those predatory gazes. The shoppers, at first, then the outdoor townsfolk when I exited the store.

It was only a ten-minute walk home, but it felt longer. Perhaps because, during those minutes, the sun finally dipped over the horizon and plunged the streets into darkness. The streetlamps sprang to life, revealing solitary figures watching me from pavements and front yards.

My body moved sluggishly forwards, burdened by heavy gazes. But what *truly* made the itch on my flesh unbearable was the knowledge that I had seen so little. Seen only those caught in the glow of lampposts and headlights. There were, undoubtedly, figures in the town’s unlit pockets. Men eyeing me from the shadows.

To make it all worse, I returned home to find only my bright-orange Mini Cooper in the driveway. There was no sign of Chloe’s Ford. No sign of Chloe.

“Pick up,” I muttered as I tried and failed to ring her. “You said you were here…”

“She *was* here,” a voice explained.

A yelp escaped as I turned to face the lawn beside mine. Turned to face the next-door neighbour I’d seen when I first arrived. He was still standing on the front lawn with his two boys, large arms wrapped around their shoulders.

*They haven’t been there all day*, I told myself, though I wasn’t convinced.

There had been something quirky about the sitcom family earlier in the day. But they seemed far more sinister at night. They stood in their blackened front garden, barely illuminated by the nearby streetlamp. They had been waiting for me. I pretended otherwise, but I knew better.

“I beg your pardon?” I asked, voice coming apart at the seams.

The father smiled and said, “Your friend. She was here.”

“We invited her inside for a cup of tea,” one of the boys stated.

The child spoke without a hint of emotion. Without a single inflection in any of his words.

I found myself thinking of the truant boys sitting on the wall. The lack of joy on their faces. The lack of anything remotely human behind the eyes.

“I don’t see her car,” I found myself saying aloud.

“She drove to meet you at the store,” the man explained.

It was an instant response, as if my neighbour had foreseen the question and prepared an answer earlier.

“Oh, that reminds me,” he continued, stepping onto my driveway and bringing his eerie smile into the light. “She left something for you.”

The father’s hand shot outwards, offering a phone with a cracked screen. I reflexively reached for it before even processing the dread in my gut. I wasn’t unnerved by the cracked screen. Not even by the idea of Chloe giving her phone to a stranger. No, it was something about the way in which my neighbour spoke. Something about the way in which he held out the device.

And as my hand met his, something pricked my index finger. I recoiled, as if a sharp hair within the creases of his palm had cut me. Mouth gaping, I inspected the bloody droplet forming on my fingertip. It dripped and fell into one of the many cracked wounds on the phone screen.

I lifted my fearful face and said, “What happened to…”

But the man and his boys had vanished. Fled without so much as the sound of grass crunching beneath their feet. Something pained my mind. Not just the town. Something that poisoned the very colours of the world. Something which prompted my soul to primally scream that I must hide.

I ran to the porch, clumsily unlocked the front door, and tried to steady my breathing.

“Listen…” started a voice from the darkness.

I screamed and twisted to see the silhouette of a man in my unlit lobby. I only half-registered that the intruder was holding up his hands defensively.

“I’m sorry,” he said, stepping forwards. “I had to find you first.”

He may well have said more, but I heard none of it because the world disappeared.

Then, an unknown length of time later, a voice from the blackness whispered, “Miss?”

I heard the familiar stranger before I managed to open my eyes or move my limbs. Probably for the best, as I would’ve fought him. He wasn’t like the others. I’d known that, somehow, even in the darkness of the lobby. Sensed it in the man’s presence.

I didn’t say any of this, however. I groaned, unable to produce intelligible words. Unable to move my eyelids.

He shushed me. “You’re safe now.”

“What is happening?” I finally managed to grunt, opening my eyes a sliver to see that I was sitting in the passenger seat of the stranger’s vehicle.

“I still don’t know, but it began six days ago,” he replied. “Mr Robertson entered Brent Monroe’s restaurant with a horrid smile and blood-stained overalls. Half the town was there. We were celebrating Margaret’s retirement. Anyway, we all thought somebody had hurt Mr Robertson. A disgruntled customer at his repair shop, perhaps. But it wasn’t that.”

“What was it?” I asked, eyeing the middle-aged driver beside me.

The man shrugged. “Brent walked over first. He held Mr Robertson’s shaking hands, intending to help. But then the owner became just as calm and broad-smiled as the mechanic. It was all a blur after that. The place descended into chaos.”

“I don’t understand,” I said.

“No,” he replied. “I didn’t imagine you would. The men changed. All with a simple touch.”

“Did *you* change?” I asked fearfully. “Are you going to hurt me?”

The stranger shook his head fiercely. “No, love. I’m not going to hurt you. My name’s Tom Lawson, and I’m going to get you out of here. What’s your name?”

“Nadia,” I said. “What happened to the…”

I trailed off, but Tom knew what I was going to ask. My eyes had focused enough to see the outline of his face. Unkempt facial hair revealed that he wasn’t willingly unshaven. And the dark circles under his eyes told me that he hadn’t slept well in days.

He eventually said, “I had a wife and two boys. Katie, Jack, and Sam. I thought only of them. That was why I didn’t stay at the restaurant. Why I didn’t help anyone. And when I drove through town, I saw men and boys carrying the limp bodies of wives, mothers, daughters, and sisters. But they weren’t dead.”

Tom noticed me inspecting the dried blood on my index finger, and he nodded.

“They didn’t want to kill the women, Nadia,” the man explained. “They wanted something worse. Something no man should want. But they’re not men. I reckon you know that by now.”

I hung my head.

Tom said, “It spreads by skin touching skin. Only the men. I don’t know why. It might be a virus. Might be the rapture. All I know is that, whatever they were, I didn’t want to become it.”

“You don’t have to explain yourself,” I said. “I just want to leave this place.”

“Well, anyway, I came home to find my street in disarray. I don’t know how it spread so fucking quickly, Nadia…” The man paused for a long time, tears brewing in his eyes. “It took my boys.”

I had no words, so I sat silently.

“They were waiting for me in the front hallway,” he continued, “and they told me that they hadn’t seen their mother. I wanted to hug them. I did. But they were lying. And they weren’t my boys anymore.”

“What happened to your wife?” I asked.

The man started to sob. “I don’t know.”

“Why are you still here, Tom?” I whispered. “Why haven’t you left?”

“Where would I go?” he replied. “I have nothing. No-one. I wanted to redeem myself, Nadia. I wanted to help those left behind… People hid at first. Those not infected. Those not taken. But it caught up to all of them in the end. Haven’t seen a woman in days. Not until you, of course.”

“Rotten timing,” I said.

He shrugged. “I found you before they did.”

“I know,” I said, nodding. “I owe you my life.”

Tom waved a hand dismissively.

“Katie might still be out there,” I continued. “They might *all* still be out there.”

“I hope so,” he replied, before turning to me. “That’s what keeps me—”

By the time the car’s beams lit the figures, it was too late to brake.

They stood three abreast on a road near the perimeter of town. A road without streetlamps. The barricade of bodies was revealed by the headlights only when two-hundred feet away. And believe me when I say that, whilst travelling at fifty miles per hour, it takes only a couple of seconds to cover two-hundred feet. Tom managed only to veer the steering wheel to the left, losing control of the car and colliding with a tree beside the road.

The force of the impact didn’t leave us unconscious. A small blessing, given that the three strangers were already approaching our vehicle before I even managed to undo my belt. After freeing myself, I placed a hand in my empty window frame, cutting my hands on glass shards. I was grateful that the front bumper of Tom’s Jeep had taken the brunt of the impact, but we were not both unharmed.

The driver grunted painfully as we clambered out of the car, clutching his abdomen, then he offered me a bloody smile. “I’ll keep them occupied, Nadia. Go.”

I wanted to stay and argue. It was the proper thing to do. But the man, having sustained either minor or major injuries, had already started strolling towards the approaching figures. Either neurodivergence or my flight response kicked into gear, and I found myself running along the road. Running back into town, because I didn’t fancy my chances with the bulky men who were blocking our escape route.

There were frightened cries from behind, and then there weren’t.

Tom Lawson had been unplugged.

His scream did not fade. It instantly died. He *chose* to stop screaming of his own accord. I knew what that meant. I knew what had happened to him.

The road back to town was obstructed by several more men walking towards me. I was being sandwiched by my hungry-eyed watchers. No way out of town. No way back to town. The woodland was my only recourse.

I turned to my right and sprinted into the blanket of bark, praying that I would find an exit. Find the next town over. I prayed that the townsmen’s sickness, earthly or not, had not travelled beyond the bounds of Propagate.

I fumbled with my phone, turning on the torch, but it was my ears that became aware — not my eyes. I heard not-so-distant moans. Garbled voices around me. Not voices of the haunted men who were pursuing me. No, these were muffled words of a higher pitch.

The cries of women.

I cast my torch from side to side, not daring to slow or stop. But I found no sign of the captives. And, in my fearful search for the missing persons, I forgot that my uncoordinated limbs do not fare well when I multitask. It was no surprise, then, when I tripped — when I was sent sprawling across the forest floor by one of my feet tripping the other.

I rose quickly, feeling a weightiness in my throat as the sound of men’s footsteps loudened, but something at my feet had caught my eye. And when I cast my torch downwards, I shrieked.

On the ground were bodies. Dozens and dozens of women’s bodies. In fact, they weren’t on the ground. They were *in* it.

The missing women of Propagate were the dirt beneath my feet. The soil, the undergrowth, or the whatever-forms-a-forest-floor. Their bare flesh, which had been stretched and mangled, *merged* with the soil. Long, fleshy tendrils sprouted from their arms, sides, rears, and all other parts of their bodies, as if they had taken root. As if they had become one with the woodland.

Worst of all, the townswomen were still very much alive. They must’ve wished they weren’t. For, as I looked closer, I realised that each woman — tied to another by skin-formed rope — was no longer just one, but many.

And by that, I mean I looked down at the woman below my feet to find her own face looking up at me *four* times. Four separate faces, each tied to a different part of her body, screamed up at me. Not as some united hive mind, but as four separate versions of her. Every face moaned in a slightly different way. All moaned with lips closed, but each expressed itself differently.

The smaller faces were nothing but circular mounds that had been propagated from her.

They would grow, of course. They would propagate too.

*What?* I thought in horror, wondering where those direful thoughts had originated.

Her eyes were coated in tears and flecks of mud. She opened her mouth to speak, but spewed only mushed foliage and blood. Her muffled words failed to permeate the greenery spilling from my guts. I knew though. Knew she was asking me to kill her, much like the hundreds of other stripped women who were inexplicably part of the forest floor. Hundreds of women who might have numbered thousands, having multiplied. Having grown new, smaller abominations.

I woke from my horrified trance when the crunching footsteps of the pursuing men were too close to bear.

“I’m sorry,” I whispered tearfully to the woman, hoping the others would hear.

I hoped they’d understand, at the very least.

I felt their tearful eyes watching me from below. There was no running around them. Only over them. I realised that the nearby squeals I had heard earlier were the sounds of women being crushed beneath my boots. I hadn’t paid attention. The squelching ground beneath my feet hadn’t been loose and unstable. It had been moving. Breathing.

A macabre pool of rippling mud and flesh that nearly swallowed my feet as I ran across it. Apologising and sobbing as I went. The townswomen formed an interconnected blanket of skin and dirt. They were forced not only to become one with nature, but to suffer through that hellishness.

I don’t know how long I spent fleeing. An hour. Two hours. All night. But I know the sun hadn’t risen when I finally made it to a small village miles away.

I no longer heard the footsteps of men behind me. I’d outrun them. They moved at a glacial pace, seeming to have been slowed by whatever corrupted them. But part of me fears that they were simply in no rush. That they know, no matter how far I run, it is only a matter of time. They will spread through even village, town, and city on Earth. Recruiting men. Propagating women.

There is no running. I know that now. I’ve returned to Propagate, and I pray that I stop the nightmare before it spreads. This may be my final message, but I’ll kill everyone if I find a way.

And they will thank [me](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).
