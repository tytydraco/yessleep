I shat myself. In a tree. I can feel it running down my shorts. I'm not proud but I have a reason. That reason is walking around on the ground beneath me, snarling. If this doesn't make sense then you've never met me before. My name is Carmen LeQuixe and before today I was a monster hunter. If I make it out of this alive I quit.

It started on a Monday. I was casually hunting a crocotta when I heard a noise. It sounded like footsteps. I started to creep towards the noise. Being as silent as I can in the woods. It sounded like someone was coming closer as they dragged something along the ground. I looked around the tree at what I thought was the crocotta. Instead I saw a creature that has no name. I have searched vigorously since that day and have found no records of any other creature like this. I opened my mouth to scream but I was too terrified to make a noise. This creature had eyes the size plates but they were drooping, almost as if they were liquid. It's face was more square shape. Like a toddler making a cube out of play-do. It had scaly peeling skin, yet it looked so soft I wanted to touch it. It sniffed what I could only assume had once been a nose. It turned its eyes towards me and let out a god awful scream that was muffled by the lack of a mouth. It started to run towards me like a gorilla, though it was the size of a Mack Truck. I turned and started to run. I have never felt what I felt then.

Absolute fear.

As a monster hunter you are not allowed the simple privilege of hiding underneath your bed. On that day however I ran to my car and drove. I guessed I had lost it in the woods. 

If only I knew.

I had to continue my work. It's been 2 weeks since that incident. I have hunted monsters since but always felt like something was watching me. Stalking me. I felt like prey. I was in downtown NYC when I heard footsteps. Then that creature turned around the corner. I didn't freeze this time. I started running.

That's how I ended up here. Central Park. I'm telling you this so if I die people will have warning.This creature is different. There is no fighting this. You have to run and find your brother, sister, mom, dad. I don't care! Hide them underneath the bed and turn off all the lights. If I survive I will find a way to kill this but if not, I'm sorry I failed.
