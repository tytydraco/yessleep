I'm writing this sitting in my room crying I hear them scratching at the door I know a door can't hold whatever is trying to get in for long this all started a few years ago when my wife had my one and only son from the second he could talk he was weird

He seemed to be obsessed with anything death related he loves watching horror movies when I turn away from them he leans in closer to get a better look I always chalked it up to him just being a weird kid you know it happens

Sadly my wife passed away in a car crash around a year ago now that's when everything in my life took a nose dive I fell into a deep depression and started drinking often forgetting my child I slowly got better but never fully recovered but I noticed more and more weird stuff

Now I've always been a believer in the supernatural but this scared me to the bones shadow figures in the corner doors slamming in the house and scratches on my back this all started happening when I started to stop paying attention to my son but calmed down once I stopped drinking

God I wish right there and then I put him up for adoption if only I knew my son was always closer to his mom but after she died he went from interested by death to absolutely obsessed with it this is when it became weird and creepy I grew distant and cold to him one day I walked in and saw him playing with a dead animal I snatched it from him and yelled at him

But day after day after day he kept practicing on animals I fell back into old habits from stress from work I came home from one day and what I'm about to say may be disturbing but its the reason I'm at this point I saw him playing with a dead cat I lost it I saw red and started punching and didn't stop until he was bleeding

You may say I deserve what was coming to me after that you have your own opinion but I'm sharing my story as a cautionary tale to help other people the next day the weird unexplainable stuff started happening but this time much stronger I discovered just days before my wife died she punished Jack for playing with animals that had been run over days later she died in a car crash for what seemed to be no reason

I have a feeling jack did this back to present day the things happening have turned from shadow corners apprecing out of the corner of my eye to them running at me and disappearing and scratches drawing blood on my back eventually it led to this night I woke up to banging on my door and demonic screeching I cowered in my bed then the scratching came it screamed my name in my wife's voice

I don't know what it is but a door won't hold it back for long and I hear the door splintering this is goodbye and a warning if you ever have kids that are interested in death please don't do what i do
