Hello everyone from r/nosleep. My name isn't important, nor is my current location. I'm here to share a true story from my experience as a generator technician. The title of my post may not grab a lot of attention, but I have no clue how else to share this without risking my knowledge being discovered by the wrong people—or worse.

To start off, I’m a 20-year-old in North Texas working as a generator technician at sites all over Dallas and Fort Worth. I have many customers that range in size, shape, ethnicity, and even quirks. Some of my more notable clients include the George W. Bush ranch in West Texas, Mark Cuban’s home in North Dallas, and the coolest of all, the Cody Jinks residence (famous country music singer, for those who don’t know). The company I work for is highly trusted by many big names and celebrities to take care of their power needs.

About a year ago, I received word from my company that I would be the new major account tech and needed to run an inspection job at the FBI building in Dallas. As much as I hated the idea of more work, I was a little intrigued about the prospect of working at the FBI building.

My first day at the FBI building was the following Monday. My coworker and I showed up to perform an oil change and a few other repairs. It wasn’t at all what you would expect—there was minimal security, lots of paperwork, and a bland office building. Once we checked in and got into place, we performed our service and left. I returned once a month for about eight months, going through the same process each time and wanting to leave immediately after checking in. 

The last time I was there, about six months ago, I showed up and went through the usual routine: inspected the unit, checked voltage, and checked out with security. On my way out, I noticed a red disc lying in the dirt near my service truck. I picked it up, and it read as follows:

PROPERTY OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

THIS DISC CONTAINS TOP SECRET INFORMATION THAT IS NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION

FILE NAME:__________

CASE NUMBER:__________

I thought it was a cool trinket and didn’t really think there was anything on it since the name and case number were blank on the front. I showed it to all my friends and girlfriend, and they all said the same thing: destroy or return the disc. I tried to explain to them that it was most likely blank and that it was silly of them to think I was in any danger for having it in my possession. I thought, if anything, it would just contain a lunch schedule or maybe, at the very worst, some light paperwork for a homicide case that had long been solved. I held onto the disc and kept it in my truck, hidden away where it still remains.

The next week, I went through work as usual, clocking in a 70-hour week, and I was exhausted by the weekend.

I received a call early that Saturday morning and had to be in Plano by 7:00 a.m. I went out to my truck, and a very large man approached me in a white 2013 Impala. He handed me a knife in a leather sheath that had bold letters engraved: SHERMAN KNIVES. The knife looked familiar—it was the knife I kept in my truck. He informed me that it had been lying in front of my truck in the parking lot. I thanked him for returning it and questioned myself as to why it was so far away from where I usually kept it.

I got my answer as soon as I opened my truck; receipts, paperwork, tools, and all my gear were wrecked and out of place inside my cab. Someone had been looking for something, and I knew exactly what it was. The disc, the one I thought had no value, was the only thing that hadn’t been misplaced due to how well I had hidden it. What was on this disc that was so important? What information was in my possession?

As I pondered this, I felt more and more foolish. Maybe I was overthinking it. I found that whoever had been in my truck had made off with my flashlight, a traveling movie screen, and an empty vape—just some kid or a crackhead. This was all too stupid; I scared myself into thinking that I was being pursued by the FBI. I went through my day, completed my job, and came home around 5:00 p.m. 

When I got home, I was tired. A 70-hour week plus a weekend job called for a few beers and a good night’s rest next to my girlfriend. I walked up the steps to my apartment and opened the door to my dimly lit apartment. I threw my keys on the side table and cleared my pockets wearily before surveying my living room. 

What I saw made my heart drop. My 80-inch TV lay shattered on the floor, kitchen utensils were scattered everywhere, and my fridge had been raided. Clothes were thrown about haphazardly. The bathroom was in a similar state, with the shower curtains pulled off, the mirror smashed, and cabinets ransacked. My bedroom was equally trashed, but the worst sight of all awaited me there. 

My beautiful six-month-old puppy lay slaughtered and mutilated under my sheets. The only thing missing was a collar that had belonged to her, and a laptop from 2011 that no longer worked. Nothing of value was taken—not my Xbox, not the TV, not even my $3,000 collection of gold and silver that had been opened but left untouched.

I stood frozen, overwhelmed by disbelief and horror. I felt too tired and broken to properly analyze what had happened. I needed to sleep, to escape from this nightmare, but the image of my puppy lay heavy in my mind. 

I gently picked up my beloved dog and placed her in a small box, intending to bury her tomorrow. The grief was suffocating, but I forced myself to complete the task. 

Why had they broken into my home, and what were they looking for? As I sit on the edge of my bed, the weight of my thoughts press down on me. I can’t shake the feeling that I have stumbled onto something highly important to the government and i am going to get to the bottom as to why they want this disc so bad. 

im gonna buy a laptop tommorow to find out what’s on this thing. i’ll share what i find soon.
