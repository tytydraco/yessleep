I don't even know where to begin. 



The events over the past few days have been enough to send my mind reeling. I guess I'll begin by addressing the first update. Some of you might've noticed it got removed after sitting on the front page of the sub for a couple of days. This was strange to me. 



When I clicked on the post to check a new comment, I was suddenly met with an error: "Sorry, this post has been removed by the moderators of r/NoSleep". I couldn't figure out for the life of me why moderators would remove a post that had been on the front page for multiple days, it just didn't make logical sense.



So I asked them. Sent a message through mod-mail and asked them outright.



No, they didn't. 



Mod-mail is anonymous so I couldn't see who I was talking with, but they informed me that they asked the rest of the team and no one could figure out who, or even how it had been removed. 



They tried to reinstate it to no avail. The post was dead. 



I tried to post it to my account page. 



Error.



Frustrated, I installed some free VPN and tried again. It stayed. My world vibrated, hummed with nervous energy. Was my IP blocked? Infected?



I don't know enough about internet security to make sense of what specifically this meant, but it scared the shit out of me. If nothing else, it confirmed that I was onto something, that \*someone\* wanted me to shut up.



And I had my suspicions as to who.



Before I get to my meeting with Saul though, I want to address a couple of comments. Someone suggested I put some fishing line across the bottom of my buildings door to see if it was broken in the morning.



It wasn't.



Just to verify my dead-complex theory, I repeated this on both the building to our left and right. All of the strings remain intact to this day. I've made a habit of checking.



A couple of you suggested I post the photos Maddy sent us, and one of you even suggested I record a video of it passing by my apartment. 



I'll do both.

I know they're zoomed in and blurry, but they're what I was given. As for the video, I stayed awake until the truck came around again the day my post got removed and recorded the following:



VIDEO: [https://youtu.be/YUN4OreprdM](https://youtu.be/YUN4OreprdM)



It's muffled since I was obviously inside, but you can hear the warning fairly clearly. I hope anyone hungry for evidence is now satiated.



The morning after filming this video was my meeting with Saul. A dense fog hung low from the previous nights rain making it hard to see the reception building clearly. It crawled, almost living, along the cracked pavement as my feet tapped across the sea of tar.



Fog had become commonplace around here, the weather always switching, never content. Cold and warm fronts met overhead like invisible plumes of dust, scattering their particles about in a thick sheet of white. A single car peeked through the cloud, presumably Saul's. The door opened with an electrical 'ding' as I stepped back into 1970. 



No employee sat behind the sliding glass pane, though the door to the offices was propped open with a bucket of paint. New wooden boards were stacked to one side, apparently awaiting renovation. A static-riddled radio show played from an unseen speaker somewhere in the back. 



"Saul" I called out, eviscerating the curtain of calm which hung above the outdated decor. I canted my head, listened for a response.



Silence.



I swallowed a lump of alarm which set itself deep in my throat, shook off the sense of unease, and walked through the door. I made my way across flat, gray, carpet and faded eggshell walls, noticably empty of the paintings and decorations which dotted them just a few days prior. Boxes filled the open offices, and furniture sat stacked and organized in various corners.



Was the place getting a complete makeover?



I turned down the final stretch of hallway and stopped in front of Saul's office. Pausing for a half-instant, I walked inside. 



The amount of time I stood there is unknown. It could've been hours. My body was frozen, stiff. My eyes darted around rapidly, scanning; attempting to comprehend the scene.



He swayed slightly, his suit flapping in the breeze of a small fan. The rope, connected to a light fixture, was taut. It creaked with each hardly-perceptible swing. His desk was laying forward, the contents of its drawers strewn wildly about the floor.



A heavy fecal scent burrowed it's way into my nostrils as I noticed a slow drip from his shoes. I retched. Everywhere. Through my fingers which tried in worthless desperation to contain the explosion.



Black splotches clouded my vision. My face went numb. I remember turning to leave.



In an instant, I was on my back, face-to-face with a nondescript figure who looked over me. A ring of lights above bore into my eyes, casting the figure in an eerie shadow. A smile full of teeth stretched across its otherwise indecipherable face.



"Thaaaat's it." The figure hissed. "You're okay."



I was in a room no bigger than a closet; strange tools and instruments covered the walls. The whole place vibrated slightly, with an underlying rumble-whine. The figure made a sudden movement and I realized they were pulling something away from my face. 



I blinked hard.



The fluid in the small ammonia capsule glistened in the sterile white fluorescents of the ambulance. The paramedic clicked a button and the light dimmed to a bearable level. I slowly sat up, feeling myself for any injuries. 



"You had quite a fall there." The paramedic said, pulling out a small flashlight and shining it into my pupils one by one. "Any dizziness? Cloudiness? Blurry vision?" I shook my head and had to grab the stretchers railing as the world pulled itself out from under me.



"That's a yes." She stated calmly, now sliding the light into her pocket. "We're taking you to Sunrise, mild concussion, have anyone you'd like to call?"



"I live here, can you just go get my girlfriend? Can she ride with me?"



"Sorry, no passengers." She said, and banged the back wall twice. The ambulance started with a jolt. "Box is too small."



I pulled out my phone and called Lex, explained the situation, and told her not to worry about meeting me. She had gone back to work the day previously, and her boss wasn't the forgiving type. I stressed that I was fine, just a minor concussion, and after shooting down a couple of attempts at leaving early, hung up the phone.



The paramedic broke the short silence.



"You know him?" She asked rather coldly.



I nodded; said simply: "landlord."



She shook her head.



"Such a selfish thing to do, especially when you leave it for someone else to find."



I looked down at my feet, not wanting to discuss the ethics of suicide. 



"I was supposed to meet with him. Talk about an... issue with the complex."



"Hopefully it wasn't too big an issue" she said awkwardly.



I shook my head.



"Just apartment shit"



\~



Lex stayed the night in the hospital with me after she got off work, and after the doctor's verified I probably wouldn't randomly die, they discharged me in the morning. We went over the details of the previous day for the tenth time on the drive home, lex incredibly curious about what went down.



"You said everything was packed up and there was paint and stuff, right?" She started. I nodded and she continued.



"Okay so say I own an office building that hasn't been updated in decades"



"Okay, you own an office building that hasn't been updated in decades." She fake-laughed and continued once more.



"Business isn't good, but I spend what little money I have on the resources to spruce up the building. I plan on painting, repairing various floorboards, decluttering etc." 



I saw where she was going with this. One too many true crime podcasts.



"You plan out all these things, you buy the resources to do it, then you kill yourself before you even start."



"It doesn't make any sense!" she said enthusiastically 



I mulled this over as we winded our way through town, past banks and fast-food chains, schools and houses. I remembered the packed boxes in the office, the sheer number of them.



"Okay, okay, what if they're not trying to re-do everything, what if they're leaving; bailing on the whole thing. Throw up some new paint, patch a couple holes, and it's good to go for the next owner?" I asked as we pulled into the complex.



As if understanding the question, the complex itself answered.



Every vehicle was gone.



Lex slowed the vehicle to a crawl as we took in the empty lot. It felt like a wasteland. An abandoned project awaiting a bulldozer. We made a loop around in awe.



Not a single parking space was in use.



"Okay so you're abandoning your business". Lex started as we pulled into our regular spot, now feeling exposed and unsafe, "you start packing, you start getting ready for the place to be sold, you even arrange for your creepy, psycho car collection to be picked up, and you kill yourself before any of it's done?"



I shook my head. Nothing made any sense. 



I started to suggest calling the police, and then it hit me; just how perfect all this looked from the outside. 



A lonesome guy, hardly any employees, struggling so hard to run a successful business he rented or bought vehicles to make the place look busy, finally gave in and ended it all after buying the stuff needed for the next owner to fix the place up. 



It was quite literally the perfect suicide.



Open and shut before the pages could be read.



\~



We didn't sleep at home that night; needed some time away to get our heads right. We paid for a hotel room for the week and spent the rest of the day moving over our necessities. 



I called a U-Haul garage and reserved a truck for two weeks out. We were moving for good.



We were done. 



\~



Yesterday, I drove back to the complex to sever our lease. I didn't even know if anyone would be there, didn't even know if the employees had a job anymore, didn't even know if they were real employees.



To my surprise, a vehicle was parked in front of the office, one I hadn't seen before. The silver convertible Corvette threw rays of sunlight in every direction, splashing strange geometries and patterns across the asphalt and brick. I pulled in beside it, readying myself for confrontation.



The sun beat down on my head with the with the ferocity of a solar flare. It felt as though the soles of my shoes might melt themselves to the ground. I squinted my eyes against the glare of the glass door, and pushed my way inside once more. 



Looking around, I shivered. 



The place no longer seemed like something out of the 70s, but like something out of a dream. Empty, unfurnished, a slight feeling that the rooms and hallways stretched on forever in labyrinthine silence beyond the yellowed wallpaper.



No noises filled the space, a sheet of silence lay draped across the scene. I almost screamed when I turned to see an older man standing behind the sliding window.



"Shit! Sorry, I didn't notice you!" I said sheepishly, a trickle of adrenaline dripping it's way down my spine. 



"You knew my son." The man said, no trace of emotion bubbling to the surface of his cool exterior.



"You're Saul's dad?" I said more than asked.



He nodded.



"The day he..." I stopped, unable to form the words with my tongue. "He said he wanted to tell me something. Do you have any idea what it was?"



He smiled, his lips curling up around a row of perfect teeth. 



"What can I help you with today?" He asked, ignoring my question entirely.



"I just wanted to say that we're severing our lease, we found a new place that we just can't pass up." A lie.



His smile grew. He chuckled.



"You're leaving." He stated, smile growing so wide it could've split his face.



He chuckled again, laughed harder. He wasn't taking breaths. He wheezed, now howling with laughter.



His face contorted; twisted into a despicable emotion which humans can't feel.



"THE LAMB RETREATS TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE PASTURE" 



The laughing inched ever-closer to a scream.



"AS THOUGH THE SHEPHARD MIGHT NOT SEE THAT SIDE! IGNORANCE! THE MERE ASSUMPTION BIRTHS BLASPHEMY THAT BUBBLES IN THE BROKEN RECESSES OF YOUR MIND!"



His voice was a gasp now, a scratch, sandpaper on metal.



"MAY THE WORMS BURROW INTO THE SOFT PUTRID TISSUE THAT CONSTITUTES THE MISTAKE THAT IS YOU!"



I backed out of the building, hands held up. When I was back through the door, I sprinted to my car. 



"-AND WE SHALL FALL TO OUR KNEES IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS LIGHT! AND THE-" 



He continued screaming as I peeled out of the lot. Continued screaming in my head even as I sped through the city, putting miles of asphalt between myself and whatever the fuck that was. 



I couldn't handle this anymore. I would never look back. Id hire movers if it meant I never had to go back to that enigma made of brick and tar. 



I got home to find lex waiting for me. I told her what happened and fell into bed, feeling like a corpse. She had no idea what to make of it, neither of us did. We kept telling ourselves it didn't matter, we were done. We never had to step foot in the complex again. All of it was behind us now, shrinking in the rearview.



We even started to believe it.



Lex fell asleep shortly after midnight, and I was on course to join her when it happened. I had lowered the volume on the television to a whisper, and had just clicked off the lamp at the beds side. 



The near-silence was intoxicating. It folded itself around me, enveloped my exhausted mind in a blanket of peace. Lex breathed softly and rhythmically next to me. The crickets and frogs provided the night with an underlying chorus. My brain stopped. 



"Caution"



Sobriety crashed into the shores of my mind like a rogue wave. I shot upright, my brain more awake than it had ever been.



"Please remain indoors"



"No no no no no no no no no" I repeated, tears treating to dislodge themselves from the corners of my eyes.



"Do not exit your home under any circumstances"



I was crying now, shaking lex awake.



"Please remain calm."
