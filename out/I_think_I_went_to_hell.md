"One Hundred Fifty American is a fair ask for such a rare piece of literature." The old man clung to the book like it was a coveted artifact, and I had just asked him to give it away for nothing. It was a dusty place, and the scent of old unread books clung to the air. I had never been to this particular bookstore before, in fact, I had never seen it until today when the sign caught my attention and I chanced a peek inside.

The Books sat on rotting shelves and small piles on ancient, dilapidated tables. I had roamed for over an hour as I read spines and flipped open covers. That was when I found it. It appeared to be bound in dark leather, no title written on the cover or the spine. When I opened it, I felt this strange sense of foreboding, like what I was looking at was something I wasn't meant to see. The front page was blank, save for some old water stains. The paper didn't feel normal. It was thicker, softer, and almost like fabric. As I flipped through the pages, I was greeted with strange diagrams and arcane symbology. Pushing further in, there were stories about men and women who had experienced wild and terrible things. For a work of fiction, it was incredible. So, I brought the piece to the strange old man huddled at the counter, murmuring to himself.

He was ancient, sallow skin much like the parchment of these books with a hooked nose that almost curved fully in on itself. His eyes sat sunken deep into his skull while quivering, wrinkled fingers slowly turned the page of a book I couldn't visibly see when I placed my intended purchase on the counter. He looked at it, eyes wide as saucers, as though even he didn't realize he had it in this vast collection of ancient literature. His gnarled fingers curved around the tome and pulled it quickly toward himself. When he spoke, it was like he was trying to clear the cobwebs from his own voice. That was when he made his offer.

"Rare is it?" I shot back. "It's in deplorable condition, the pages are deeply water-damaged. Some even feel like they've absorbed a small flood. For something so treasured, you certainly didn't bother to provide ample care for it. I'll pay no more than twenty-five for such a damaged piece." I shot back. Negotiation, especially for such rare and exotic pieces, was something I did well.

"Do you even know what it is you are buying? The power of such a book? The 'water-damage' you claim to see is the blood of those who've read this before you. Those soft pages? The skin of a beast beyond our understanding, flayed and stitched into these pages. The book itself is a living, breathing organism that feeds on the greatest folly we as human beings possess. The thirst for knowledge. The desire to know more, to know what happens next, to know if we are alone in this vast cosmos. I will take no less than One Twenty-Five," he shot back.

I had to admit, it was quite the sales pitch; the old man had likely been playing the game far longer than I, but I wasn't about to give him such a simple victory. "If it's such a powerful relic, then you wouldn't be willing to part with it at all. A fascinating story, old man, but perhaps you should stick to your books instead of trying to write new tales off the cuff. Fifty dollars. No more."

He smiled, thin and cracked lips curving into a crescent. "Like I said. The book feeds. It will find its way back here when it is done with you, The price is really just a part of the game. It's already yours," he relented. Until now, he had been clutching the book like a child would a favorite toy, but when he said this he placed it back on the counter and slid it my way. "Fifty American, then," he stated, holding out his hand.

I had expected the game of negotiation to continue on longer than this, but he had given up so readily. Surprised and a little disappointed, I paid the man what he asked and left with my prize.

I was eager to read the book, more eager to study the symbology I had seen written on the pages when I had skimmed through them. When I made it home, I had made sure to gather a few notebooks to keep my notes accurate, and I brought the book into my ritual room.

My father had died several years ago, and he never approved of my interest in the occult. He had said it was an unhealthy obsession and that I'd find myself digging up some relic that would result in my untimely end. Knowing what I know now, I wish I had listened. Perhaps I wouldn't have chosen to use my inheritance to build this accursed place.

The room itself was small, ten feet by ten feet of sandstone brick with pillars erected to help maintain a completely arbitrary series of archways that encircled the center, leaving an open place on the floor for the drawing of ritual circles and arcane symbols. Something I had hoped I'd be able to do with this newly acquired book. Setting the tome on a small lectern, I opened it and began to flip through the pages, trying to find something interesting within its pages. Strangely, I found what I sought almost immediately, as if the book knew I wanted something that I could utterly engross myself in. A ritual titled "Boon of the Traveler." According to the book, it would take me where I was destined to go.

It was a promising lead, so I took it. Carefully, I took the chalk I had saved from a pouch and began to draw out the symbols on the pages in an arcane circle. I recited the words, which to my surprise were written in English. Another red flag I chose not to see. 

I don't know what I expected, if I had planned on my meddling with forces unknown actually working I certainly would have exercised far more caution, but when I finished drawing the symbols and reciting the mantra, something happened. I can't quite explain the feeling, but there was a flash. Blinding light filled the room, and I felt myself being pulled by the midsection into what I can only describe as television static. It was that strange pins and needles feeling, but I felt it across my body. Before I had the chance to even consider what was happening, I fell flat on my face.

The ground was cold, almost like concrete. As I pulled myself away and checked for any sort of major injury, I gave my surroundings a once-over, and I certainly wasn't in the ritual room anymore. This place was flooded with cool fluorescent lighting, the ground was what appeared to be a single solid slab of concrete, while the walls were slate gray with a series of hallway cutouts. I felt like I was in one of the most depressing office buildings I'd ever seen. Fortunately, my fall hadn't resulted in anything more than a bruised ego. So, I collected myself and picked a hallway, wandering along the drab walls and looking for anything that might tell me where I had found myself.

The hall seemed to stretch on endlessly. Every now and again I'd find a simple white metal door, but when I attempted to open it I'd find it locked. Knocking never elicited a response, so I'd continue to wander. Though the hall dragged on, there were points where it would eventually break and lead me down another series of corridors with another series of locked doors. The thing that unsettled me the most about this place was the loneliness. I was in what could only be described as some sort of massive compound and there was never a single soul or other individual to be found. Only the echo of my footsteps against the concrete and jiggling sound of every door I attempted to open. 

On and on I wandered, never finding an opening that would lead me out of this maze of doors and monochrome halls. There were many times I felt I had walked in circles, but I had no chalk anymore, I had nothing to mark where I had been. It had to have been hours of this aimless travel, I was growing tired, and I was getting hungry. At some point I had taken to calling out, trying to find any source of life that wasn't my own, but no one ever responded. Defeated, I slumped against one of the cool gray walls and stared at the ceiling.

"Lost are we?"

The voice shook me from my defeated stupor and a clambored up against the wall looking for the source. There, not five feet from my person, was a man. He was pale, wore a simple white shirt and black slacks. The most striking thing about him was that his face was perfectly hairless. No eyebrows, no facial hair, and nothing on top of his head. He blinked a pair of cool blue eyes and maintained this professional smile that made me uneasy.

"Where did you come from?" I demanded of him.

His smile remained as he motioned to one of the many doors. "My office, of course. I heard you shouting and grew concerned. Not many get lost in this place anymore."

"What *is* this place?" I asked curiously, thankful to have a comrade in the monotony.

"Hard to say, really. An access point? A business? Who knows. I just work here, after all."

"Then...what job is it you do?"

"Oh, a little of this a little of that. I haven't done an onboarding in a long time, though. So, I suppose I'm glad you arrived when you did. It was growing dull."

*"What* was growing dull!?" Every answer he gave was this vague half-response. Nothing explained anything.

"I think you'll learn soon," he motioned to a nearby door and nodded. "You should try that one. Pretty sure it's open."

Before I could respond to argue, he turned on his heel and disappeared behind another door. I ran to it, trying to pull it open so I could ask more questions, but the door locked behind him, leaving me alone in this strange and nightmarish place once again. I growled under my breath, looking to the door he had pointed out and marching toward it. I tried the handle, and just as he said, it turned for me. Relieved to finally be able to escape this odd limbo I pushed into the space beyond the door.

I found myself back in my father's home. The manor was quiet save for the faint sound of beeping medical equipment. It was unsettling. After my father had died, I had all of the equipment that was being used to care for him returned. I didn't want to think about those tools that were being used to keep him with us artificially for so long after his accident. I didn't want to consider them, just as I had never wanted to see him in such a state. After his injuries, I had abandoned him. Left him to die alone in this massive place, returning only when I got the call of his passing.

I followed the sounds of the machines right to his old bedroom, one I had sealed off after his death. Forbade anyone from entering. Testing the door, I found it unlocked and slowly pushed it open. My father's massive four poster bed sat in the middle of the room, curtains drawn. I could see tubes and medical equipment surrounding the bed as I nervously approached. The pained sound of shallow breathing resonated from behind those curtains, only amplifying my fears. I fought them every step I took, morbid curiosity winning over self-preservation. Pulling back the curtain, I saw him.

My father lay in the bed, breathing raggedly as machines did most of the work for him. His body was covered in bandages, many of them browning from the treated wounds beneath. There were parts of his face that were uncovered. Parts where I could see the burns. He turned a milky eye in my direction and I nearly stumbled back, barely able to hold in the contents of my stomach.

"What's wrong, son...?" I heard his broken voice rasp. "Can't bear to look upon your old man anymore? Just like you ignored me all those years ago? Left me to die? After you did what you did?"

"I-I haven't the slightest what you're talking about." I spoke, voice quivering the whole time.

"Don't you?" he rattled back. "Your little games in the pool house? The candles and the animal blood? The stupid *fucking* rituals." the machines beeped faster as I turned away, trying to run from whatever this monster wanted to reveal, but I heard them. I heard the tubes shuffle, the squeak of medical wheels. "You did this." I heard him growl, then I felt his charred fingers upon my shoulder, still warm. "Your *petulance*. Your *obsession*!"

My breath left me as he spun me to face him fully. I could smell the sickly sweet scent of burned flesh, and his bandages fell away. Leaving me to look upon my father in all his glory. From head to toe his flesh was charred. His eyes were sickly white orbs in his blackened face. Loose flaps of skin flared where his nose once was and a pair of holes were all that remained of his ears. Any flesh that wasn't directly attached to bone was gone, burned away in the fire all those years ago. "I-I wasn't home that night! I was...I was with a group of friends!" I tried to justify what had happened, but he was right. 

"Oh yes, your little group of cultists who followed you around like puppies, wanting to suckle from the teat of your money. You left the candles burning. You left the kerosene on the counter. It was your negligence. Your *stupidity* that caused the fire. I was so worried about you, son...so worried. I ran into that building to save your life and it cost me my own. What thanks do I get? Months of skin grafts and medical treatments while my only son wouldn't even bother to visit! You left me alone. LEFT ME TO DIE!"

The room grew warmer as he growled, and I could see the smoke coming from the machines. I tried to run, to escape the coming conflagration, but my father's grip was firm on my shoulder. "I'm sorry!" I begged. "Please, father! Don't do this to me!"

"Do what?" he demanded, turning me to face the sparking medical equipment. "Leave you to feel what I have felt? The rejection, the pain, the loneliness?! This is what awaits you, son. This is the answer to your question. Rejoice! You know what comes after!" I struggled against him, but his grip remained firm. The equipment sparked again, catching some container of medicine. When it did, the medication sparked and burst into flame. Before I could even scream the entire room was suddenly engulfed in an inferno. I prepared myself for the flames, for death to take me, and I felt their heat. I felt my skin begin to crack and char as the flames burned away nervous tissue, but when I finally opened my mouth to scream I was in the hallway once again.

"Lost are we?" I heard the voice of the man from before and I quickly rushed to my feet, the terror still present on my face.

"Is this hell!? Where am I!? WHO ARE YOU!?"

The strange bald man simply smiled at me. "You must've just had your first onboarding." he'd say with that same calm smile.

"I saw my father...I...He tried to kill me!"

"Oh dear. That must've been quite the experience. I'm sorry that happened. Perhaps now you understand, though." his voice grew darker as he spoke those words.

"Understand what?" I asked, the sweat from my last encounter now beginning to mix with sweat from this one.

"Some things are best left alone. Some doors best left locked. Some books best left unread." he'd look to another door that slowly creaked open. "Go home." he said plainly. "Don't come back here until you are meant to. Get rid of the book." he'd motion to the door. "Before I change my mind and decide you need more training."

I looked to the door. Then to the strange man. I didn't need to be told twice. I didn't *want* to be here anymore. I didn't *want* to experience this nightmare any longer. I ran to the door and rushed through.

I woke on the floor of the ritual room, one of the runes I had drawn in chalk had been smudged. Looking to the book I breathed a heavy sigh of relief and closed it. A scent seemed to carry on the wind, some sort of cooked meat. It made me shiver as I rushed back up the stairs of the manor, sealing the ritual room and locking it.

That night I visited my father's grave for the first time. I apologized, sincerely for my selfishness and the next day I sought out the old bookstore again only to find the old man waiting. "I told you." he said with a wry smile. "The Tome of the Traveler always returns to me." I didn't care to ask more, or demand a refund. I wanted the book gone and he gladly took it back. The whole incident occurred two years ago. The ritual room was turned into a private viewing room for more...light-hearted films. I donated a hefty portion of my inheritance to charity and started attending church. Anything, I've told myself, to avoid going back to that place. Because I think I know what it was, and I never want to see it again.
