I first heard about *La Dernière Repas* from a man I’d never met before. He sat beside me on the subway, sharply dressed but with a faint smell of something acrid, something metallic.

I had been on the phone with my wife, discussing anniversary plans, and reassuring her that I had something big in mind that she was going to love. In truth, I hadn't the faintest idea what stunt I was going to pull, and with our anniversary date closing in, I was beginning to feel the pressure.

As the call ended, my phone screen flashed, showcasing the captivating, bright smile of my lovely wife.

I didn’t notice the man until he spoke, softly, like he had a secret to share. 

“A man like you, with a woman like her… You should take her somewhere special.” I turned my head slightly, uneasy but intrigued. His smile was thin, knowing. “A restaurant unlike any other. No address. No phone number. Just a name. *La Dernière Repas.* If it’s meant for you, you’ll find it.”

It was absurd, the kind of thing you’d hear in a bad horror movie. But something about the way he spoke, the quiet intensity in his voice, lingered with me long after he left. That night, curiosity got the better of me. I typed *La Dernière Repas* into my search bar, expecting nothing. Instead, a single result appeared, a jet-black webpage with gold lettering: *For those with refined taste. Submit your request. Await our call.* There was a form. No location, no menu, just a space for my name, my wife’s name, and our anniversary date. I filled it out without thinking and pressed send.

I almost forgot about it. Almost. Until the phone rang two days later. The voice on the other end was crisp and polite, with the faintest accent I couldn’t place. “Your reservation has been accepted. Tomorrow night, eight o’clock. Dress accordingly. Follow the instructions sent to your email.” A chime on my laptop confirmed it, directions, simple but specific. A street I didn’t recognize. A door with no markings. A knock, three slow raps, one quick. No further instructions.

When I told my wife, she was thrilled. She loved places like this, hidden gems, underground exclusivity, the thrill of being in on a secret. “How did you even hear about it?” she asked, already planning her outfit. “Just a recommendation,” I lied. Something about that man on the subway unsettled me, and I didn’t want to dwell on it. Instead, I let her excitement pull me along.

The next evening, we arrived. The address led us to a nondescript alley, where a lone, unmarked door waited at the end. I knocked, three slow, one quick. The silence stretched just long enough to make me wonder if this was all a joke. Then, with a quiet click, the door swung inward. A man in a tailored black suit stood before us, smiling with perfect teeth. “Welcome,” he said, stepping aside. “Your table is waiting.”

The moment we stepped inside, I felt the air change. It was warmer than I expected, not in an uncomfortable way, but thick, like the room itself was alive, breathing alongside us. The lighting was low, golden, casting shadows that stretched a little too far. A grand chandelier hung from the ceiling, dripping with obsidian crystals instead of glass, refracting the dim light in unnatural ways. The place was stunning, no doubt. High-backed velvet chairs, long candlelit tables, waiters gliding noiselessly between them. And yet, something was…off.

The maître d’ led us through the dining room, his polished shoes clicking against the marble floor. I noticed the other patrons as we passed. They were elegant, dressed to the nines, but eerily silent. No casual laughter, no clinking of glasses. Just the quiet scrape of cutlery against porcelain and the occasional whisper, hushed and urgent. Their eyes lingered on us, not welcoming, not hostile, just watching. My wife, oblivious to my unease, squeezed my arm in excitement. “This is incredible,” she whispered. I forced a smile.

We were seated at a table near the center of the room, a prime spot. The maître d’ handed us thick, black menus with gold embossing. No prices. No descriptions. Just a list of names, cryptic yet alluring. **The First Offering. The Hunger’s Delight. A Taste of Memory.** My wife chuckled, flipping through the pages. “Very dramatic,” she mused. I nodded, but my fingers felt stiff as they traced the embossed lettering. Something about the names unsettled me.

Our waiter appeared, tall, pale, dressed in a pristine white uniform that seemed untouched by even the idea of a stain. His features were sharp, his smile deliberate. “A pleasure,” he said smoothly. “Might I recommend allowing the chef to guide your experience? A curated journey, tailored to your palate.” My wife glanced at me, her eyes sparkling with intrigue. I hesitated, but she was already nodding. “That sounds perfect,” she said. The waiter’s grin widened. “Excellent choice.”

As he glided away, I leaned closer to my wife. “This place is…strange.” She smirked, sipping from her glass of water. “That’s what makes it fun.” I tried to ignore the weight of the stares around us, the way the air seemed heavier now, pressing in just slightly. The first course was coming. And with it, I had a feeling, no, a certainty, that something was wrong.

The first course arrived with no fanfare. A single plate, placed before each of us with practiced elegance. The dish was minimalistic, three small, gleaming spheres arranged in a triangle on a thin, crimson sauce. They shimmered under the candlelight, almost too smooth, too perfect. The waiter, still smiling, gestured toward them. “A delicacy from our most…intimate selections. Best enjoyed in a single bite.”

My wife picked one up without hesitation, rolling it between her fingers before popping it into her mouth. Her expression shifted immediately, eyes widening, lips parting slightly. “Oh my God,” she breathed. “That’s incredible.” I hesitated, then followed suit. The texture was strange, dissolving almost instantly, flooding my tongue with a complex, rich flavor. It was savory but carried an undertone of something metallic, something warm. I swallowed, and for a moment, a strange sensation bloomed in my chest.

The waiter observed us carefully, head tilted just slightly. “Fascinating, isn’t it?” he said. “Each guest experiences the first offering differently. A memory, perhaps. A sensation long buried.” His voice was smooth, measured, as if he were more interested in our reactions than our satisfaction. My wife laughed, shaking her head. “I don’t know what it reminded me of, but it was amazing.” I forced a nod, but I wasn’t sure I agreed. The taste lingered, clinging to the back of my throat in a way that felt invasive.

Around us, the dining room had changed. The conversations, once hushed, had ceased entirely. I turned my head slightly, pretending to reach for my water, and noticed the other patrons watching us again. But now, they were smiling. Faint, knowing smiles, as if we had just passed some unspoken initiation. I swallowed hard, placing my hands on the table to steady myself. Something about that first course had left me unsettled. Not sick, not in pain, just *off*.

The waiter bowed slightly. “I shall inform the chef that you are ready for the next course.” As he turned, I noticed something on his hands. Not a stain, his uniform was immaculate, but his fingers, just at the tips, were slightly red. My wife was still savoring the taste, oblivious to the weight pressing down on my chest.

The second course arrived in a dish that seemed too ornate for what it held, a single piece of meat, seared to perfection, resting in a shallow pool of dark jus. The aroma was intoxicating, rich with something almost primal. The waiter placed it before us with the same precision as before, his expression unreadable. “This dish is special,” he murmured. “Prepared with the utmost care. A cut so rare, it can only be served once per evening.” His eyes flickered to me, just for a second, as if he expected me to understand.

My wife didn’t hesitate, slicing into the meat with delicate ease. The juices pooled, thick and glistening, as she lifted a bite to her lips. The moment she chewed, she let out a soft moan of pleasure, closing her eyes. “Jesus,” she whispered. “That’s unreal.” I forced myself to follow suit, my knife sinking into the flesh effortlessly. The first bite melted on my tongue, its flavor impossibly deep, layered with something... familiar.

A wave of nausea rippled through me, not from sickness, but from recognition. I knew this taste, though I couldn’t say how. It was like a memory on the edge of waking, slipping through my grasp the moment I reached for it. Across the table, my wife was savoring every bite, blissfully unaware of the ice crawling up my spine. I set my fork down carefully, trying to steady my breath.

From the corner of my eye, I noticed something, the other guests were eating the same dish. And yet, some of them weren’t chewing. They were watching. Watching us. One man, seated at a table near the back, had his plate untouched, his fingers drumming against the table in a slow, deliberate rhythm. When he saw me looking, he smiled. Not with warmth. Not with welcome. Just the acknowledgment of something inevitable.

I turned back to my wife, who was already finishing the last bite, licking a drop of sauce from her lips. The waiter’s voice pulled me back into the moment. “You enjoy it,” he said, more a statement than a question. My wife beamed. “It’s perfect.” He nodded, but his eyes remained on me. “The next course is… revealing,” he murmured. “I’ll let the chef know you’re ready.” He stepped away before I could respond.

The third course was coming. And I had the sickening feeling that, whatever was next, I wasn’t ready for it.

The third course arrived under a silver dome, carried with the same reverence as before. But this time, the waiter did not remove the lid immediately. He placed it between us, hands lingering on the tray as if savoring the moment. His smile was smaller now, but more assured. “This is our most intimate dish,” he said softly. “A reflection of one’s own past. A taste you may have forgotten… or rather chosen to forget.”

A flicker of unease passed through me. My wife, however, leaned forward with anticipation. The waiter lifted the lid with a slow, deliberate motion, and a strange, sweet aroma drifted into the air. On the plate were two small pastries, delicate, golden, almost inviting. A drizzle of something dark and syrupy pooled around them, glistening under the candlelight. They looked harmless. Beautiful, even.

My wife picked hers up immediately, breaking it apart with a gentle crunch. Steam curled from the center, carrying a scent that tugged at something deep inside me, something buried. She took a bite, sighing with delight. “It’s perfect,” she murmured. “It tastes like…childhood.”

I hesitated, staring at mine. A memory surfaced, unbidden, a kitchen, small and warm. A woman’s hands kneading dough. The scent of something sweet baking in the oven. But the memory was incomplete, fractured. The harder I tried to grasp it, the more it slipped away. My stomach twisted. This wasn’t just food. It was something else.

Slowly, I brought the pastry to my lips and took a bite. The moment it touched my tongue, the memory crashed into me with brutal clarity. But it wasn’t warm. It wasn’t comforting. It was wrong. A taste I shouldn’t know. A taste that didn’t belong to me. Faces I didn’t recognize. Laughter that wasn’t mine. My chest tightened, my throat constricting around the bite. Across the table, my wife was still eating, lost in her own recollections.

I forced myself to swallow, hands gripping the table to keep steady. The waiter watched with quiet amusement. “Fascinating, isn’t it?” he murmured. “How taste can awaken what the mind has buried.” He leaned in just slightly, voice lower now. “Some memories are best left untouched.”

I knew then, with cold certainty, that we needed to leave. But we couldn’t just get up. Not yet. Not without drawing attention. So I nodded, forcing a tight smile. “Incredible,” I choked out. The waiter’s grin widened. “The next course is nearly ready,” he said. “This is where the meal truly becomes…unforgettable.”

He stepped away, and I felt my pulse hammering in my throat. I didn’t know what was coming next, but I knew we wouldn’t be the same once we tasted it.

The fourth course arrived with a shift in atmosphere. The candlelight flickered as if disturbed by an unseen breeze, the hushed conversations in the dining room thinning into near silence. The waiter returned, gliding toward us with a plate covered in a deep red cloche, different from the silver domes before. His expression was unreadable now, the smile gone, replaced with something closer to expectation.

He set the plate down between us, his hands lingering just a moment longer than necessary. “This course,” he said, voice soft but weighted, “is unique to each guest. A dish that recognizes you as intimately as you recognize yourself.” His eyes flickered toward me, just for a second, but the weight of that glance felt unbearable. He lifted the lid with a smooth motion, revealing the dish beneath.

It was raw.

At first glance, it resembled a carpaccio, thin slices of deep red flesh arranged in an elegant spiral, drizzled with something dark and viscous. The scent was rich, iron-heavy, primal. But it was the shape of the slices that unsettled me. They weren’t cut like any meat I had seen before. They curled at the edges, soft, too soft. My stomach clenched, something inside me recoiling before my mind could place why.

My wife inhaled sharply. “It smells incredible,” she whispered, picking up her fork. My breath hitched in my throat. “Wait,” I murmured, reaching for her hand. But she had already taken a bite. The moment she swallowed, her entire body tensed. Her fingers curled against the tablecloth, eyes flickering with something between ecstasy and shock. A shiver ran down her spine.

I stared at the plate, my own fork trembling in my grip. I didn’t want to taste it. I couldn’t. But I had to act normal. The entire dining room was watching now, subtle, still, but undeniable. The weight of their stares pressed against me like a held breath, waiting for my reaction. I forced myself to pick up a piece, pressing it to my tongue.

The moment it hit my mouth, I *knew*.

It wasn’t just meat. It wasn’t just food. It was *me*.

A phantom pain rippled through my body, a distant, echoing ache, as if something had been taken from me long before this moment. My chest constricted, my mind screaming at me to spit it out, but I couldn’t. I chewed, swallowed, and the sensation passed, leaving behind a hollow sort of recognition. Across the table, my wife shuddered, dazed and unaware.

The waiter bowed slightly, satisfaction flickering across his features. “The flesh remembers,” he murmured. Then he turned, disappearing back into the kitchen.

I clenched my fists beneath the table, my entire body screaming at me to move. We had to get out. But the next course was coming. And I had the horrible, sinking feeling that it would demand more from us than just a taste.

The fifth course did not arrive immediately. Instead, an eerie stillness settled over the restaurant. The other guests continued eating, but their movements had become… synchronized. Forks lifting in unison, glasses tilted at the same angle. The clinking of utensils formed a slow, rhythmic pattern, like the ticking of a clock. My skin prickled as I glanced at my wife, who seemed blissfully unaware, still lost in the aftershocks of the last course.

I reached across the table, placing my hand over hers. “We need to go,” I whispered. Her brow furrowed slightly, as if I had spoken in another language. “What? Why?” Her voice was soft, distant. There was something wrong with her eyes. Not the color, not the shape, but the way they didn’t quite focus, like she was slipping away from herself.

Before I could respond, the waiter reappeared. This time, he was not alone. Two chefs flanked him, their pristine white uniforms immaculate, their expressions devoid of anything resembling warmth. The waiter smiled, but there was no amusement in it now. “The next course,” he said, “is a privilege.”

A long, narrow tray was placed before us. Upon it rested two small, intricately carved bones. Delicate, almost decorative. The sight of them sent a fresh wave of nausea through me, but my wife leaned forward with curiosity. “What is it?” she asked, reaching out.

The waiter’s smile widened. “A choice.”

My breath caught in my throat. The bones were not random. One was smooth, almost polished, its surface bearing tiny, unreadable etchings. The other was jagged, broken at the end, a splinter of something much larger. The second I looked at them, I knew, they belonged to us. Not metaphorically. Not symbolically. They were *ours*.

My wife picked up the smooth one without hesitation. The moment her fingers closed around it, she gasped, her entire body going rigid. Her eyes snapped shut, her breathing shallow. I lunged forward, but the chefs took a step closer, their presence a silent warning.

“Don’t fight it,” the waiter murmured. “This course is not for the body. It is for the soul.”

A deep pressure settled over the room, pressing against my ribs like unseen hands. My wife’s lips parted, and a whisper escaped, so soft I could barely hear it. It was not her voice. It was layered, distorted, *something else*.

I turned to the waiter, my pulse hammering. “What did you do to her?”

His head tilted slightly, amused by the question. “The meal is progressing.” His smile returned, a thin, cruel thing. “And so are you.”

I looked down at the remaining bone, the jagged one. I knew, without being told, that I was expected to take it. I knew that if I did, I would understand what was happening. And I knew that understanding would cost me something I could never take back.

My fingers hovered over it, trembling. Around us, the other diners had stopped eating entirely, their eyes locked onto me. *Waiting*.

I took a breath. Then, slowly, I reached for the bone.

The instant my fingers closed around the jagged bone, a searing cold shot through my arm, crawling up my veins like ice. My vision blurred, the candlelight stretching into strange, fluid shapes. For a moment, I thought I had made a terrible mistake, I had given them something, something I couldn’t name, and something I could never reclaim.

Then the visions began.

I was not in the restaurant anymore. I was somewhere dark and vast, a space that felt beneath the world rather than within it. Flickering shapes surrounded me, people, but not as they should be. Their faces were wrong, shifting, as if memory itself had melted away their identities. I recognized none of them, yet their presence filled me with the kind of grief reserved for the long dead.

A great table stretched before me, hewn from something ancient, something that *breathed*. Figures sat at its length, silent, watching. Waiting. Plates lay before them, but they did not eat. Their eyes burned into me, hollow and insatiable. I realized, with bone-deep dread, that I was the one who had to serve them.

I turned, drawn by an unseen force, and my breath caught. My wife was there, but she was not herself. She stood stiffly, her lips barely parted, her eyes locked in that unfocused haze. And behind her, a shape loomed. A figure I could not fully see, its form shifting like candle smoke. It pressed against her, its hands, long, too long, resting lightly on her shoulders, as if she belonged to it.

Panic surged in my chest. “Let her go,” I whispered, my voice barely carrying in the vast emptiness.

The thing did not respond. The figures at the table remained silent, their hunger thick in the air. Then, the waiter’s voice, soft, familiar, drifted from the shadows. “You were chosen,” he said. “Not for the meal. *For the offering.*”

I turned sharply, my pulse a hammer in my ears. “No,” I rasped. “We didn’t agree to this.”

The waiter’s expression did not change. “You accepted the invitation. You took the courses. You partook in the ritual, even without understanding.” His head tilted slightly. “You belong to it now.”

I looked back at my wife, at the thing behind her. A part of me knew that if I didn’t act, she would be lost, taken, consumed by whatever this was. But I also knew that fighting outright would be pointless. I had seen the way the other diners moved, the way the staff watched. They were too deep in this. If I wanted to save her, I had to play along.

Slowly, I released the bone. The world snapped back into place, the restaurant settling around me like a shroud. The guests resumed their eating, as if nothing had happened. My wife blinked, shivering slightly, then looked at me with cloudy confusion. “What… just happened?” she murmured.

I swallowed hard. The waiter smiled approvingly, his gaze lingering on me. “The next course,” he said smoothly, “will be the final one.”

I forced myself to nod, my fingers tightening around the napkin in my lap. Whatever came next, I had to be ready. Because I knew, without a doubt, that the last course would decide whether we left here at all.

The waiter stepped away, leaving us in a silence heavier than before. The other guests had resumed eating, but something had shifted. Their movements were more purposeful now, as if each bite carried an intention I couldn't decipher. My wife shuddered, rubbing her arms as if she had just emerged from deep water. Her eyes met mine, she was coming back to herself, but something lingered, something that had settled into her skin like an unseen mark.

I leaned forward, forcing my voice to stay steady. "We have to leave. Now."

Before she could answer, the final course arrived.

The doors to the kitchen opened, and the staff emerged in unison. No longer just waiters and chefs, but others, figures in dark clothing, their faces obscured by deep hoods. They moved without sound, carrying a long, narrow table draped in crimson cloth. They placed it in the center of the dining room, and one by one, the guests turned their attention to it, their forks resting, their anticipation palpable.

At the head of the table, the head chef stepped forward. I hadn't seen him before, not fully. His uniform was pristine, but his presence was oppressive, like the weight of something old and vast pressing against my ribs. He clasped his hands together, surveying the room with an almost paternal warmth. "You have all been most gracious," he said, his voice smooth, deliberate. "And now, the feast will conclude as it was always meant to."

With a single motion, he pulled away the cloth.

Beneath it lay a body.

It was impossible to tell if it was a man or a woman, its form was still, its skin smooth and pale as wax. No wounds, no signs of suffering. It looked less like a corpse and more like an empty vessel waiting to be filled. As if God himself had stopped mid-creation, neglecting to add a soul. My wife inhaled sharply, her hand clamping over her mouth. My own stomach lurched, but I forced myself to stay still, to watch.

The head chef gestured to the diners. "The final course is communion," he said. "The moment where the meal becomes one with those who have partaken."

A soft murmur swept through the room. The guests rose from their seats, moving with eerie synchronization. One by one, they approached the table, placing their hands over the body's chest. As they did, their expressions shifted, relief, reverence, something close to ecstasy.

Then, I saw it. The body's chest *moved*.

Not the rise and fall of breath, but a ripple, something shifting beneath the skin. As if it were absorbing them, feeding off their presence. The guests exhaled, their shoulders slackening, their eyes growing distant.

My wife clutched my arm, her nails digging in. "We need to get out of here," she whispered.

I nodded, carefully pushing my chair back. But the moment I did, the head chef's gaze snapped to me. He smiled, knowingly. "And our newest guests?" he asked. "Will you not complete the meal?"

The diners turned as one.

Their faces were different now. Some had lost their wrinkles, their skin tighter, younger. Others looked drained, hollow, as if something vital had been taken from them. But all of them were watching us. *Waiting*.

My pulse roared in my ears. I knew now what this place was, what it did. It wasn't just a restaurant, it was a cycle. A ritual of giving and taking, of consuming and being consumed.

I forced a smile, my fingers tightening around my wife’s wrist. "We wouldn't dream of leaving," I said. "Not before the final course."

The chef's smile deepened. "Then, please," he said, gesturing to the table, "step forward."

The room had become a pressure cooker. The walls seemed to close in around us, the air thick with something heavier than heat. The figures at the table had returned to their places, their faces now frozen in a state of perfect calm, like statues waiting for a command. The smell of something sweet, metallic, filled the air. It clung to the back of my throat, sickeningly familiar, like the scent of old iron.

My wife’s grip tightened around my wrist. Her knuckles were white. Her face was pale, but I could see it now, she knew. There was a darkness behind her eyes that hadn’t been there before. She was seeing what I saw, feeling the weight of it. And I knew, in that moment, that if we didn’t move now, we would be part of it forever.

I turned toward the back of the room, where the door was. The staff had formed a barrier around the table, their eyes never leaving us. Their silence was deafening, a thousand unspoken words pressing against me.

“We’re leaving,” I said, to my wife, careful to cloak my words from the rest of the patrons. My voice didn’t tremble, but the air around me did, vibrating with the tension of every eye in the room. My gaze locked on the door. It was our only chance.

I yanked my wife’s arm, but she hesitated. Her eyes flickered between me and the body on the table. Something deep inside her, something that wasn’t her, was reluctant to leave. I could see it now. The pull of the meal, the need to complete the cycle. It was as if the restaurant itself had started to claim her.

“Don’t look at it,” I hissed. “Look at me, we’re going. Now.”

A small sob escaped her as she tore her gaze away. With a sudden, sharp tug, I yanked her towards the door, the staff moving slowly, deliberately, like shadows in our periphery. The world held its breath. The room waited for us to falter.

We reached the door, but as I gripped the handle, something caught my wrist.

I turned. The waiter. He was standing mere inches behind us, his face utterly unreadable. His eyes had changed, something had slipped behind them.

“You won’t leave,” he said, his voice flat, like the final note of a lullaby. “Not without the *consequence*.”

I didn’t think. I didn’t care. With a single movement, I wrenched away from him, throwing the door open. The cold night air hit me like a slap, and I pulled my wife through, the door slamming shut behind us. We were outside, but not free.

The street was empty. No cars. No lights. Just the suffocating silence of a world that had forgotten us. The restaurant, with its faintly glowing windows, loomed behind us like an eye watching in the dark. And somewhere deep inside, I knew, we weren’t safe. We hadn’t escaped.

“What happened?” she gasped, her breath ragged. “What was that place?”

I swallowed hard, my thoughts racing. I tried to collect myself, but everything about the night felt wrong. The images of the body, the guests, the staff, they were still with me, twisting in my mind.

I shook my head. “I don’t know. But it’s not over.”

The world began to shift, the streets warping, bending at the edges of my vision. The darkness didn’t retreat, it followed. My fingers trembled as I reached for my phone. I needed to call someone. Anyone. But the screen flickered, no signal.

I looked around. A sound broke the quiet, distant but unmistakable: the low hum of a car engine, growing louder. I turned, and a shadow passed overhead. A black vehicle pulled up beside us, the window rolling down slowly.

The voice inside was calm. “You left before finishing the meal,” the driver said, his face hidden in the dark. “And now, you must be reminded.”

Before I could respond, the back window rolled down and a man came into view. The head chef, his smile stretching impossibly wide.

“It’s not just a meal,” he said. “*It’s a destination*. And I'm afraid you've already arrived.”

No words were spoken beyond that intimidating promise, but at my core, I understood. The car departed, assumingly back to the restaurant I can no longer locate, and I was left with just my wife and my thoughts.

It's been a few months now, but I still feel it, the knowledge of a task unfulfilled. As though I'm simply procrastinating against the inevitable.

I know what I ate that day, not simply the forbidden meat, but the soul contained within that meat as well. And I know that one day, it will be my turn to feed someone else.

Someone unsuspecting, and innocent, and painstakingly normal. When I close my eyes at night, and accept how this life of mine will end, I can only hope I'll make a satisfying meal.
