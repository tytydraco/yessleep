By the front kitchen door sits a shotgun. And every morning, rain or shine, I take it for a walk.

I’ll leave the house and check on the chickens, counting them to make sure one of them hasn’t been stolen in the night by Hairy. Then I’ll walk through the barn. Sometimes, if I’m feeling nice, I’ll bring Hephaestus a carrot. The horse’s “good morning” is rarely more than a snort. After I know all the farm animals made it through the night, I’ll go back to the front of the house and stand on the porch. I’ll double check that the shotgun is loaded. And I’ll wait.

For ten minutes I’ll stand and watch the winding dirt road that leads up to the farmhouse. I know exactly what I’m waiting for, and I hope it never comes.

I live alone here, and I haven’t paid a cent on this farmhouse since I became the sole owner. It’s never had a mortgage, and even if it did, I would’ve long outlived it. But in some county courtroom somewhere, loads of unpaid property tax has to be piling up. One day, I know someone who wants to take this place away from me will come walking up my road. And I’ll have to kill them.

Before I start to sound like a psychopath hellbent on tasting the blood of the innocent, it’s not something I want to do—not by any means. But when that day comes, I’ll have to. This place is all I have left.

If I don’t see anyone, I’ll go feed the animals. Then I’ll head back inside, kick off my boots, and start on breakfast. It’s usually bacon and eggs, unless the Landlady brings me some of those cereal bars at the end of the month. Then I make sure I leave a plate on the table for Aunt Jean, even though I never see her eat it.

This morning was different. Because I didn’t make it past the chickens.

The coop has been in my yard for as long as I can remember, and inside are always at least seven hens, and sometimes a few chicks. The hens themselves change, because it’s hard to keep Hairy from stealing them in the night. Really, it’s almost impossible to prevent any of the many disasters that may befall a chicken on this farm, but boy do I keep trying.

My routine count that day only gave me six hens and three chicks. Immediately, I could tell who was missing.

The girls were fluttering and fussing in a way they definitely wouldn’t have been if their matriarch was around. Beelzebub, a mean old bitch missing an eye (and my favorite by far), was nowhere to be found.

I tried not to panic and immediately failed. Without her, there was a chicken power vacuum. Chicken society would fall apart. Pretty soon, I’d be hearing things like ‘power to the poultry!’ and “peck the establishment!”

I couldn’t think about my routine anymore. I had to find her.

The barn was quiet, and all the other animals were in their rightful place, except Sally. That silly old goat was on the ceiling again (that’s right, she likes to hang on the ceiling, not the roof, don’t ask), but it felt wrong to ruin her fun. Let her stick it to Old Man Gravity if she wanted to.

Hephaestus decided that he could show off just as well and sneezed all over me. It wasn’t the first time I’d have to wash horse snot out of my pajamas, and it wouldn’t be the last.

“Well then. Good morning, Heph. Have you seen Beelzebub anywhere?”

He gave me a snort that said even if he knew, he wouldn’t tell me. Not even for a carrot.

“Fuck you too then. You’re two weeks and a fart in the wrong direction away from being glue.”

He whinnied at me, but I wasn’t listening to his sass anymore. I searched high and low in the barn, but to no avail.

If Hairy took my favorite chicken, I was going to take his favorite limb.

I made a mental checklist of all the places I needed to look, and then I started making my way down it. I started with checking the coop again, just in case the hens were practicing common stage magic like last time. Then I did a good sweep of the roof of the farmhouse.

Next, I walked along the tree line as close as I dared, and then I checked the well.

“Hey, Anna, do you happen to have Beelzebub down there?”

As usual, Anna Well’s only response was to scream up at me. Anna Well showed up not long after my mom left, and she’s been an endearing sort of nuisance ever since. She doesn’t always scream nothing. Sometimes it’s song lyrics. Sometimes it’s poetry. One time I even heard her shouting the quadratic formula.

I’ve never seen her, but I sure have heard her.

“AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!”

“I’m going to take that as a no. Thanks anyway.”

Next I went around to the front of the house and took a look underneath. Then I remembered that there are bad things under the house, and I should never look under there again.

Aunt Jean watched me from the window. Maybe she would know where Beelzebub went!

I ran into the house and found Aunt Jean in her upstairs room like usual, which was weird considering she was at the downstairs window only a minute or two ago.

“Hey Aunt Jean, have you seen Beelzebub anywhere?”

She just sat in her rocking chair and smiled at me.

“Oh wow, you’ve got some extra teeth today don’t you, Aunt Jean?”

She smiled at me wider and rocked back and forth. The creaking always made me a little drowsy. Laying in the dark and listening to it from the next room worked wonders on the nights I had trouble falling asleep.

“Looks good on you. If you happen to see Beez, could you let me know?”

If Aunt Jean had spoken, I imagined her telling something about how chickens were nature’s troublemakers, but that I’d find her.

As I turned to leave, I hoped she was right.

I spent the whole day searching high and low. I checked every place a chicken could feasibly be. I scoured the attic, the storm cellar, the refrigerator, even under all the beds. She wasn’t in my truck, or sitting in the perpetual warm spot on my four-wheeler. She wasn’t in the shower or out on either of the balconies. I had a solid feeling about the crank washing machine, but no luck. Not even an inch of the house and the land it was on was left unseen. I didn’t even stop to eat.

By the time the sun was sinking, there was only one place that she could be that I hadn’t checked: the cornfields.

I have a few issues with the cornfields, which is an interesting dilemma to have when you’re a corn farmer. For one, the dust during the hotter months turn them into Allergy City. There’s also a lot of corn spiders, not that I have a huge problem with them. They’re not very mean, and honestly fascinating. But once they start trying to climb on me, then all bets are off. Especially the ones I find every so often that are about baseball-sized.

But the biggest problem is the Pigman.

Deep in the cornfield closest to my house, from sunset until just before sunrise, he stands and watches. He’s tall with tan skin turned rotted gray in places. His arms and legs are as thick as oak branches, and he leaves bloody bare footprints in between the rows. In his dead hand, he holds an iron slaughter hammer. It’s still stained with old blood, just like the tattered overalls he wears. I call him the Pigman because instead of the type of head any decent, good-natured zombie would have, he has the head of a pig. Not like his face is piggish, but it’s as if someone stuffed a pig’s head onto a human’s. One of these days, I know he’ll come out of that cornfield. I know he’ll come for me, and that scares me more than I’d like to admit. There’s no one else here to miss me besides the animals.

I crept out to the edge of the stalks. He turned to face the intruder of his domain, locking those oily black eyes on me. I returned his accusing stare.

“You took my fucking chicken, didn’t you?!”

There was no telltale clucking from within the field, but I couldn’t be sure he didn’t stuff Beelzebub into a weird porcine pocket dimension or something. The Pigman just stared at me.

“Give her back!”

Nothing. Not even a twitch.

“Please?!”

The Pigman tilted his head back and let out a warped squeal that made me just a little nauseous.

“Fine! Keep her! See if I give a damn!”

I turned and went back to the house. I had a few other courses of action I could take. Calling the nearest neighbors, but it was doubtful she would’ve wandered onto someone else’s property. Hopping on my four-wheeler and searching farther out, but venturing away too far after dark had come with some interesting consequences last time. Making a missing person’s poster… a missing chicken’s poster?

I went with the last option, doing my best to capture Beelzebub’s likeness with my terrible drawing skills. Once I had put as much information as I could about her on there, I took a quick ride to the end of my road and stapled it to the power pole. That was all that could be done about it until tomorrow. The only thing that had been fed that day was the animals, and I was starting to feel dizzy.

I’d planned on cooking the trout I’d gotten from the last time the Landlady visited, but the most I could manage was heating up leftovers. Aunt Jean ate the microwaved pork roast I left out for her just the same.

Usually, I could find something to occupy my time before bed. Despite the time-consuming job of being a farmer, I had a few hobbies. Several of them weren’t actually dangerous and didn’t involve hay. On a clear night like this, the best place to be was reading on the rickety little balcony I have to climb out of my window to get on.

But I was too exhausted and miserable. At that point, I just wanted to go to sleep and forget that I existed for the next six hours. Or at least some time to lay down and stare at the ceiling.

After showering, I slipped into bed. It was a hot night, and the air conditioning had been on the fritz for the past week. I knew the Landlady would come and take care of it within the next day or two, but until then I was sleeping in little more than a pair of boxers. I used to have an admittedly unwise habit of sleeping in my binder, until it went missing. It only reappeared when I agreed out loud to whatever might be listening that I’d take it off to sleep. I had a sneaking suspicion the thief might’ve been Aunt Jean, but I couldn’t say for sure.

I don’t remember when I fell asleep, but I knew when I woke up. Worse, I knew *why* I woke up.

Someone was bumblefucking around the chicken coop, and I had a pretty good guess as to who.

I took the stairs down two at a time, not stopping for anything except my shotgun. Before I felt my feet leave the porch, I was already around the back at the chicken coop. Just like I expected, Hairy somehow already had a chicken out of it.

This is as good of a time as any to talk a little bit about Hairy Houdini.

I could name at least four variations of Bigfoot in the Southeast off the top of my head, but Hairy… is not one of them. All those people that believe the legendary ape-man is just a misidentified bear— Hairy would be their wet nightmare. Standing at a little over eight feet tall, the bear-man has opposable thumbs, a wicked temper, and walks around like a person on a casual stroll. He earned his nickname because almost every other night, he comes and tries to steal a hen. I jerry-rigged that door good, in the hopes to keep predators out and the chickens in. And it worked— all except for Hairy. There’s no way he should be able to get in there, and yet…

“FREEZE! DROP THAT HEN!”

Hairy opened his big, slobbery, flesh-covered snout and let out a roar. His blue, human eyes glowed in the darkness, and I stared him down and roared right back. Then I fired a warning shot.

“Next one goes right through your weird bear hand! See if you can nab a chicken then!”

Hairy roared again, stomping his massive feet like a child who couldn’t have the candy they wanted. Then he dropped the hen and ran back off into the forest, swinging his arms like a jogger.

I picked up the hen, and was disappointed to find that it was not Beelzebub. It was just Henley, the newest addition to the flock. She clucked in what I assume was either gratitude or annoyance as I stuffed her back into the coop. I did another half-hearted search around the perimeter of the house, then the night breeze picked up to a steady wind and brought clouds and the promise of an early morning rainstorm. Figuring Hairy wouldn’t be back for the rest of the night at least, and Beelzebub was a lost cause by now, I went back to bed. If I had remembered what it felt like to *not* feel lonely, I would’ve felt lonely then.

Except I didn’t exactly get back to bed. I made it about two steps into the kitchen before I noticed another chicken, standing in the doorway to the living room. There were three things that were different about this one, though. Number one, it had black feathers, which none of my chickens did. It was definitely not mine. Two, it had bright red eyes, like someone had stuck burning coals into its face. And three, it came up to about chest height.

I tried to come up with something profound to say to my unwanted guest, but all I could get out was a confused “what?”

The mega-chicken’s beak dropped open and instead of the squawks I was used to first thing in the morning, it let out a wheeze like an old woman taking her last breath. I’d heard some pretty weird chicken noises in my time, but that wasn’t one of them.

“Look, I don’t know what you are or what you’re doing here, but it’s time to go, buddy. It is not far enough in the AM for this shit. Pack it up.”

I guess the guy wasn’t a big fan of the attitude. It charged across the kitchen at me and headbutted me to the floor with surprising strength. I’d dealt with a lot of weird shit on this farm, but this was pushing it. And don’t get me wrong, I was scared. My heart was pounding and my hands were ice cold, but the annoyance was way more pressing. I just wanted to go back to sleep.

The mega-chicken stabbed a talon down, and I rolled under it just in time. Well, almost. I felt a wicked burning in my side and the upswell of blood from the new scratches on my hip. I didn’t waste time leaping up and running right back out the kitchen door. Mega-chicken followed after me, screaming something like “ruin and rot are all you’ve got” and “rolling stones will break your bones.” Giant evil chicken who spoke in rhymes. Great. I wasn’t about to try and make any sense of it. If this thing had taken Beez, I had a snowball’s chance in hell of ever seeing her again.

I stumbled on the uneven ground of the dirt road, and went down hard when my ankle buckled. The megachicken fell on me in a flurry of feathers, and its neck swiveled all the way around like the Eggorcist. Then it kept going, corkscrewing like it was made of taffy until it had gained at least four extra feet. Maybe I should’ve been begging for my life, but all I could think was just how stupid it was going to be to die like this.

Mega-chicken wrapped the talon that still had my blood on it around my head and began to squeeze. Just when I thought this was lights out for me, there was a whistle in the air. Then a silver arrow pierced through the chicken’s head. It let out a raspy groan, then fell limp on top of me. Slimy, acrid blood dribbled out onto my face, and I tried my best not to puke.

With all my might, I pushed it off and stood just in time to see a figure with glowing eyes in the distance, armed with a drawn bow made of dark wood. It was the second time since living here that I’d seen the Landlady. In mere moments, she’d disappeared with a swish of her cloak. I didn’t even have time to thank her.

With her gone, it was just me, the moon, and the giant chicken corpse. I decided that it was a problem for tomorrow, and started walking back to the house. I passed out face down on my bed as soon as I was close enough to make a crash landing. Save for the vague bubbling sensation of hydrogen peroxide on my hip, I was dead to the world.

I overslept my alarm the next morning by about twenty minutes and woke up to a gentle shake on my shoulder. Aunt Jean was standing right above my bed, smiling. She had less teeth than usual today. She had no teeth at all, in fact. Her mouth was just a black void.

“Oh, sorry Aunt Jean. Hairy got into the coop again last night, then there was this chicken god thing, then the Landlady dropped by, and I had trouble getting back to sleep.”

She just watched me with that strange smile that old ladies often have. I reached down and touched my tender side, feeling the bandages there. The dried blood was washed off my face, too. That could’ve only been her doing.

“Just give me a little time, I’ll have breakfast ready within the hour, I promise.”

If Aunt Jean had ever spoken, I could’ve imagined her saying something like “don’t rush on my account, chickadee.” Then she walked backward out of the room, her wide eyes never leaving me.

I jumped up, threw on my boots and a shirt, and did my usual rounds. There was still no sign of Beelzebub or the KFC value meal that had died all over me last night, and I’d done all but given up entirely. As I stood on the porch and watched the dirt road, I finally let myself cry about it. I couldn’t cry for every chicken; I lose them frequently enough, and life has to go on. But Beelzebub was special. She’d been with me the longest, and I loved her honesty about life. She’d never met a hand she couldn’t peck.

I wiped furiously at my eyes, hoping fate wouldn’t choose this day to come. There was no doubt my aim would be off.

I waited an extra few minutes before heading back inside to start breakfast. I’d just poked my head into the fridge when there was a knock at the front door. The sound of it made me jump; I couldn’t remember the last time I’d actually heard someone knocking. The idea of another person on the farm was scarier than anything else that lived out here combined. Other people were always bad news. Other people always brought problems.

I crept to the door; shotgun gripped tight in my shaking hands. I pressed my ear to the wood for a moment, heard nothing, then whipped it open.

If someone had been there, they were gone now. But there was some*thing* left behind. A large brown package sat on the front door mat, with small holes poked messily around the tape sealing it closed.

The mailbox at the end of my long road was leaning on the dead-end sign and was home to a rather impressive wasps’ nest. I hadn’t gotten so much as a scrap of junk mail in years. The last time I’d ever received anything was a small package on my sixteenth birthday. Inside was a silver Zippo that was always in my pocket from then on, and an unexpected letter from someone I hadn’t heard from in a long time.

The label for the box sitting on my porch had no return address and was covered in way too many stamps. The sending address simply said, “to Portia Hadley.” Portia was scribbled out with a clearly dying Sharpie, and Newport was written in big blue letters.

I didn’t know who this mystery delivery man was, nor did I necessarily want to know. But at least they had the decency not to deadname me. That’s more consideration than I get from most of the people in town.

I sat down my gun and took the package inside, splitting open the tape with a few good tugs. There was a flutter of feathers, and then Beelzebub looked up at me and clucked.

“Oh my god! Beezy!”

As I dropped the box, the wrinkled old prune jumped into my arms. She looked no worse for wear, except for the extra eye right above where her left one used to be. But I wasn’t about to fault her for a little accidental mutation in transit. She was alive and pecking, and that was good enough.

“Where’ve you been, girl? Not that I was worried at all. I knew you’d make it back here. You’re a tough old gal.”

She just fluttered her wings and crooned loudly. I could only assume this was a “what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas” type of deal.

“Well, you’re just in time for breakfast. Come on.”

Instead of the usual bacon and eggs, I made fruit salad that morning. For the first time in a long while, I had a guest at the table. Beelzebub sat on the stack of old phone books and pecked at her apples and strawberries. I left out a plate for Aunt Jean too, knowing at some point I would blink, and the plate would be empty.

“You’re a real devil for going missing like that, you know Beez?”

She squawked, which I took to be a long diatribe about how a name can innately change a person and I gave her the identity she has now. But she was a chicken, so of course it devolved into her talking about seed.

“Yeah, you’re probably right about that one.”

The rain that had been on its way all morning finally broke out over the fields. It was going to be a long, muddy day.

That’s all the story I have to tell for now. Sure, I could probably think of something else, but the shitty old desktop computer I have likes to type maybe two words a minute. And that’s when it’s not overheating.

Maybe something will happen that’s worth typing about. Maybe it won’t. I’ll still type something, regardless.
