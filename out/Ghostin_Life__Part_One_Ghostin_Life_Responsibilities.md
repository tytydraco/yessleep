I was slumped on the toilet when I saw it.

Had an elbow pinned on my knee and all; sat like The Thinker statue if he were holding up a phone and doing the opposite of thinking… doom scrolling. Given how long I was in this cramped Harry Potter Cupboard of a bathroom with warm poop particles floating about, I was surprised I hadn’t started oxidizing too. 

Anyway, where was I, uhh… Oh right: while scrolling through TikTok to fill the void in my stomach, I stumbled across this video that, at first, I assumed was a retired preacher guilt tripping me into pausing by claiming ‘it’s not what Jesus would have wanted’. There was a passionate intensity to the way this old man spoke. Combined with the saliva foaming in the corners of his yapping mouth, having his hands steepled, and the video being on mute, it looked like he was spreading awareness for rabies. In that excessive TikTok way.

Sure caught my attention though. I wondered what bro was on about. But the sound on his video got muted.

I opened and scrolled through the comment section, his eyes and wrinkled sweat-slicked forehead still glaring at me from above.

The comments were, mostly, so supportive, so, naturally, I was supportive as well. Not sure what the ‘message’ was though. None of them gave me a clue or an opinion to cling onto. I even went on for a bit longer. But it was pretty much a comment section you’d expect to see under a Facebook post; elders using hella heart and thumbs up emojis. There were only a few comments saying: ‘#NormalizeAdultoween’. Whatever that meant.

After scrolling for a while with no pleasure, I snapped out of it and reality hit me worse than post-nut clarity. I was fixed in a posture that would make Quasimodo feel normal. So, I immediately straightened up. Which probably wasn’t the best idea since that made the numbness in my legs register. Taking a deep breath to grimace only succeeded in bringing the bathroom’s odor to my attention. It smelled like the dad from Friday had just used it.

I gagged and coughed my lungs out. *Where was I? Uhh.. Oh yeah. Right.* 

I unlocked my phone and slumped into a Thinker pose once more. Determined to find out what the guy had said. Which was pretty easy since I just clicked on his little profile icon and saw the same yapping video was spam posted about ten times. I clicked on the latest one. The caption under this was: “TikTok will not silence our movement! They will not violate our first amendment!!”

*Woah, this dude is super determined, confident too. I dig it.*

I replayed the video, giving him my undivided attention, even with copyrighted dubstep music blaring over his voice.

“Ladies and Gents of TikTok. Wouldn’t it be nice, for once, to ditch our duty as adults, parents, or whatever else is holding *you* back from fun?” As he said ‘you’ he pointed at the camera like Uncle Sam, looked more accurately like Grunkle Stan. I found myself nodding subconsciously.

“Well, we don’t have to full on ‘ditch them’, per se, just wanted to get your attention. But it would be nice, needed even, to enjoy yourselves. It would be nice to ease your mind of its burden. Folk, I tell ya it would be nice to go through life, for one night, as we did in our younger, care-free days. It’ll be nice to have fun!”

*Woah…* I thought, my eyes turning to star emojis. *He has such a way with words.*

“I’m here to tell you folk, it’s possible. We only need to normalize adults having fun. We need to normalize adults dressing up and going out trick-or-treating for themselves! And I don’t mean just accompanying your children; I mean putting the children second. Hell, we did it for Disney, why not for Halloween?” The video was just about to end, so he yapped out the following as fast as a TV commercial disclaimer: “Please, like, and share with that copy link trick, and, if you kind folk wouldn’t mind, comment #NormalizeAdultoween; and have a merry Halloween. Also, don’t forget about that meetup!”

*No way…* I thought all that stuff was out the window as soon as you turned twenty. You mean I could still go out and have fun and forget, for a while, about having to bust my ass off day-after-day only to barely get by with today’s economy? *Awesome!* Maybe being a Gen-Zer in America wasn’t too bad after all. With chills rippling throughout my body, I commented: #NormalizeAdultoween. 

And in just a few minutes, notifications popped up, snapping me out of my doom scrolling; something that was about as easy as yanking a baby bottle away from a hungry child. My comment got flooded with likes and replies. All of which were old people emojis… But I finally understood now. I understood why they chose to comment those emojis. It made me feel warm and loved. For once in my life.

And now I felt I was actually a part of something greater than myself. That was… fulfilling.

Because of that, when I scrolled down to a comment saying this meet-up they were having was in Los Angeles, I wanted in. *An Adultoween meet-up today on Halloween in Hollywood at some cemetery!* Which was about five or so hours away from me. Down south.

*Hmm, if I leave right now, I could make it in time. But would that be wise?* I tapped on my chin, calculating the expenses and what my bank account could spare. Math was difficult though. I scrolled a bit because I thought maybe the answer would come to me that way.

Sure enough, it did. A tarot card video popped up with a woman saying: “This is your sign.”

*Fuck it.* *She’s right*. This was worth it. Maybe this was even my purpose. *Everyone finds their purpose in Los Angeles! I don’t know why I didn’t think of it sooner, and it’s literally not too far away*. *Time to get ready!*

I wiped my butt in a haste, burst out of the bathroom, then looked around my studio apartment for DIY costume ideas. It only took a quick glance to span and scour my entire apartment though. The living room quadrupled as a kitchen, dining area, and bedroom. But it looked bigger than it was because of the lack of furniture and how social-distanced everything was. Including myself…

I caught myself staring off into nothing in particular as if a flashback sequence would ensue, then quickly shook my head cartoon-style. *It doesn’t matter. Not anymore.*

I continued my search for a costume. It was either dressing as a self-help guru, or Tyler Durden, because that's all I could think of at the time. I ended up settling on Tyler. The man was my childhood idol with his spiky hair, infamous red leather jacket, and unlimited confidence. It was fairly easy to put together since I just needed a ton of gel to spike my black shaggy hair. And the confidence… Well, you know, I was pretty confident already.

I dressed, and while standing in front of my bathroom mirror, part of me realized I looked like Tyler Durably put a Dent in my confidence. That is, if my confidence were standing on the opposite side of that dent, because, you know, on the other side it’d be a bulge instead of a dent, which was a good thing… which is what I was going for with that saying.

Uhh, whatever, I got to packing, making sure I had everything I needed inside my satchel. *Karen, check, phone, check, wallet, check. And, yeah, I think that’s about it.*

“Looking fresh,” I told myself in the bathroom mirror, followed by a wink and finger guns. Then I left. 

**\*\*\***

*So… I’m in Los Angeles now,* I thought while being in Los Angeles after having driven fiveish hours.

Most of the trip consisted of: my ears popping from height differences, my bladder asking ‘are we there yet?’, long stretches of fields, me blasting my favorite TikTok music, and me listening to monotonous AI narrations of suspiciously AI sounding Creepypasta stories about sentient AIs being in horror situations involving humans as antagonists as a way to spread propaganda that AI wasn’t too bad. 

I hated AI. Also hated the fact there was so much traffic. I had arrived as the night was at its sunniest. Sundown. Which was around 6:30pm. While *Thick of It* blared through my speakers. I knew I arrived when my car came to a complete stop on the highway, and the heat I’d been avoiding with a rolled down window and speed started to catch up to me. Luckily, it was getting dark soon.

I was on I-5 I think? I didn’t know how highways worked, that was the GPS’s job. But I did faintly recall watching a YouTube Short that explained it. *Ehh, who cares.*

I cared more about making it on time. But now I was stationary. Which I could never do for more than a few minutes at a time. Unless I was online. Online wouldn’t work though. My data was tripping. So, my knee started involuntarily fidgeting. And I made up scenarios in my mind to pass the time. One of which involved getting out and starting a musical in the traffic. Another: abandoning my car and running the rest of the way. Both of those I had seen in a movie. Movies are dope. But I prefer shows. Anime specifically. Something about seeing those motivated main characters chasing their goals relentlessly really spoke to me. Yelled, really. Like Luffy. And if Luffy were here he’d just fling himself across the traffic. But he was not here. I was. The difference between me and him was like the sudden transition to an ugly and detailed closeup in SpongeBob. Anyway, besides that, there were some violent scenarios playing in my mind too. Some shit straight out of GTA V. I ignored those with nail biting and scrolling through the weather and gallery app while driving; if you could call inching forward every few seconds and avoiding eye contact with the orange empty gas light like encountering an ex-girlfriend in public after she dumped you but you claimed it was mutual and remembering with a grimace how in those last moments you spilled your heart out to her—if you could call all that and fidgeting and scrolling through forgotten memories on the Gallery app, while your eyes darted between the car in front of you, the empty gas light, and your phone, ‘driving’.

Notifications swarmed into my phone, signaling that my data was back. And the music started up again. Tranquilizing me.

**\*\*\***

*Woahhh!* I thought, while glancing around at my woah-worthy surroundings in Hollywood boulevard after having put up with traffic for an unbearable amount of time that I couldn’t be bothered to keep track of.

*I am definitely keeping track of this though! Woahhh!*

Most people get clickbaited, you know, going in expecting to see famous people everywhere, not just conceited wannabes, or expecting streets to be clean, not grimy, but I got exactly what I wanted. It was just like GTA V online! But better. There were no annoying ass DeLoreans flying around. But there *was* fighting. As if on cue, I looked right and saw two people throwing hands… and now arms and legs, in front of a designer store while others passed by. Said ‘others’ were influencers, tourists, and your average American joe (sentient GTA characters).

Except, unlike GTA, there were a lot more homeless people, and worse: people who think they’re heroes for recording said homeless people and posting it for the world to see, pocketing their phones with a satisfied expression like they had selflessly, single-handedly, solved America’s housing crisis. Sort of pissed me off because I was pretty much one missed paycheck away from having to plop up my own tent along sidewalks in the side streets, like many I had seen on the way here. Not only would I have to worry about cash, but the paparazzi invading my privacy as well, claiming like annoying prank channels that they could technically record on public property.

But, to be fair, Los Angeles looked like the best place in the world to be homeless. Beautiful weather. Even on Halloween.

On cue, loose autumn leaves swirled across the sky in front of my car, surely picturing themselves as the ‘plastic bag’ in that Firework song. As I frequently did.

I kept driving, eyes morphing into hearts. A shit ton of palm trees flanked the street, their tips greeting me with a sway as I passed. I was now approaching the Chinese Theater. Pretty cool how they built a real-life version of it inspired by GTA. Just in front of it, there were eloteros on the Walk of Fame, making my mouth water Scooby Doo style. *No, Abel. You, sir, have no time to spare.*

Next to those eloteros, I spotted an influencer in the wild. Bro was wearing glasses and a baseball hat, dancing in front of a ring light and getting mad at people who walked in front of the camera like surly gym dudes. The people who flinched at the influencer looked like tourists. I assumed so because they were practically begging for cultural defibrillators. One of them—an elderly lady donning a sun hat and safari outfit—was staring shell-shocked at a shirtless tweaker who yelled at passing cars (like mine just now). I honked to say what’s up. The tweaker yelled and waved in return. Bro was just vibing. I’ve always wondered what they saw; the tweakers, not the tourists. But I should’ve probably wondered about the street in front of my car huh?

I looked ahead. It was pretty boring though; just crowded taillights. There were a few supercars looking like they were taken straight out of GTA. And random dirt bikes swerved through the gaps in the traffic, roaring and whooshing air as they passed our cars\*.\* Overhead, there hung Halloween banners extending from palm tree to palm tree across the street in a zigzagging pattern. 

I distracted myself from the road once again. Looking to my left at the shops behind their black terrazzo sidewalk-lawn. The shops followed this order: shops open for business, shops that were boarded up and graffitied, shops closed for the day with storefront security gates, and souvenir shops.

That pattern repeated itself all the way down the rest of Hollywood boulevard. At least I thought so. I couldn’t know for sure since I stopped paying attention and started scrolling. Eyes darting from my phone to the car in front of me. Sometimes I wouldn’t even look and relied on the red taillights burning my face.

After a while of driving, I eventually turned down to a side street that led to Santa Monica boulevard, and parked my car with mismatched door panels just down the street from Hollywood Forever Cemetery. The Adultoween movement would sooner catch me dead than riding in that junk.

I parked in the space in front of a 24-hour laundromat, with more shops like AutoZone and Cricket extending left and right. It was snuggled in an old strip mall that flanked Santa Monica boulevard. *Maybe we can hang out inside the laundromat after we’re done trick-or-treating! Old people love that, right?*

I hopped out of my car without my satchel, making sure to lock it, then let out a big shaky stretch with an: “Ahhh, that hit the spot.”

Looking around, I spotted the white Hollywood sign nestled on a tall hill in the distance. Barely visible. I had to line up in the middle of an intersection so that the straight road pushed aside buildings and greenery like opening a curtain, allowing me to see it. The way it glared at me and watched over the city Big Brother style made me gulp. But the cars honking at me to hurry and finish crossing probably contributed more to that gulp.

Anywho, I strolled down the concrete sidewalk, mindlessly blending in with a small crowd. Said crowd was like a jet stream of old people dressed in costumes all heading where I was heading; past the strip mall, past the trimmed hedges of a so-called \*'\*Masonic Lodge', and taking a left turn to enter the cemetery, where palm trees erected on either side of the entrance, along with a lush road verge. *Wait, old people… Dressed up…*

The Adultoween movement! Sure enough we were all heading towards the closed black gate bordering the cemetery. 

My mind pictured us from an outside perspective sauntering on towards the gate, our own WWE theme song blaring from somewhere. I even brushed some dust off my shoulders… which made the old lady next to me—who wore a Miraculous Ladybug costume—sneeze up a storm.

“O-Oh, shoot, sorry!” I stammered.

We paused by the security booth with an arrowhead terracotta roof, thirty or so deep, looking about. I expected to at least see someone my age in this crowd—twenty—but none of them seemed to be younger than forty. Like the old man who stood beside me, wearing a superman costume that if I told you was his grandson’s you’d think I was lying and instead believe was borrowed from his great grandson.

Everyone seemed to be coming to the same conclusion: Where the hell was this TikToker? He never said where he’d specifically be once arriving. Plus, the cemetery was closed this late. So I looked around a little too frantically. *Please don’t tell me he flaked on us*. Too many people flaked on me already. I didn’t want that list to grow. 

Behind the gate, graves rested on luxurious-looking striped grass. Tons of palm trees loomed overhead. And I spotted a pretty cool black Rolls Royce hearse. That sight didn’t matter though. Because the elderly people began muttering amongst themselves, growing antsy. 

*I should take initiative. I am dressed as Tyler Durden after all,* I thought, and was about to act on it. But a tall lanky dude I would’ve mistaken for a palm tree, had it not been for the Baby Shark costume he wore, sauntered into view from who knows where. Probably from the bushes flanking the driveway leading to the cemetery. 

*The TikToker!* He “ahem”ed once we saw him, his shark tail wagging with every movement he made as if in a constant state of twerking.

“Howdy, ladies and gents.”

“Hi!” I squealed… then let out an awkward, resonating cough because no one else but me joined in.

The TikToker waved and walked past us as we parted, then rested an arm, dramatically, over the cemetery’s gate. “Guess we’re too late,” he sighed, turning around to face us. “Story of our lives, ain’t it, folk?”

There were murmured agreements. 

“Well, let’s get this show on the road.” He dug into his pocket and pulled out some crumbled sheets of paper. “We are gathered here today… to, uh…” he looked down at his notes, and pulled another out of his pocket as a replacement.

*Oh we’re doing this here in the middle of the entrance?* I thought, looking around awkwardly. Everyone else was locked in. So I figured I might as well be too. I gave the TikToker my undivided, unequationed, attention.

He continued, “Sorry, wrong speech. Ahem, folk! Society needs to understand that we… we should be free to have fun, right?”

A few muttered ‘right’s sounded from my left and right. I joined in sheep-like, “Right.”

“Right, so, uh, you deserve to have fun!”

“Right,” a few of us said.

“Right, so… fun is fun.”

“Right,” only I said.

“Right, so, uh… you guys are here for the actual movement, not just for the candies I promised, right?”

“Right,” a few of us said. 

“Right. Uh…” He looked left and right. “I’ll tell y’all what, let’s have a guest speaker tell us how this movement changed their lives! Who volunteers?” He pointed at the only engaging members of the crowd—me, the Miraculous elderly Ladybug, the SuperGreatGrandad, and me again. “You,” he said, “come on up here!”

“I… Uh… Me?” I pointed at the SuperGreatGrandad while pulling at my suddenly tight collar. “Or him?”

“Yes, you! Come on up here!”

“You as in me? Or you as in him?”

“You.”

“Oh…” I gulped, and the crowd parted as if I were their old friend Moses. People on either side began clapping and shedding tears of joy; those ‘people’ being the only two engaging members besides myself. The rest just stood there; seemingly jealous that a young man like me was chosen. But it still made me feel at home, and even boosted my confidence. So I sprinted towards the TikToker and spun around with my arms raised as if it were a WWE entrance into a ring…

I was met with blank expressions though. 

“Get a load of this guy, eh?” The TikToker pulled me into a side hug like a drunk uncle at a family get together. “This young man is a huge milestone for our movement. The voice of the youth matters! More so than ours!" The crowd—rather, just those two real ones—cheered in reply, warming me up a little. “Voice your opinions on the matter. What is it you want?”

“I… uh. I don't…” I looked ahead at those two old, warm, and loving faces that actually cared. And a warm feeling radiated throughout my body, reminding me faintly of the faintly good memories I had of my parents. “I want this,” I murmured.

“Atta boy! Haters will say we peaked in highschool or we’re too old to have fun, like some comments on the videos I posted. To that I say this, folk: why should age determine whether or not we are allowed to enjoy life? It’s just a number!”

Some random raspy voice from the crowd chimed in, “Yeah! I’ve *been* saying that! I could've used y'all at my court hearing.” 

The Adultoween crowd looked around, hesitant to cheer. 

“Folk, kindly direct your attention towards me. We will march door-to-door, demanding they treat us fairly. We will get our candy. Our voices will be heard. We will be seen!” We all cheered. “Follow me! We will get our candy!”

He led us down the sidewalk while cheering: “Normalize adults having fun!” repeatedly like another one of many advertisements—billboards, sidewalk signs—that jittered about.

I was surprised nobody told us to shut up given how loud we were. But then again, as we kept marching, determined, we spotted at least five other groups of people aside from us; each with their own movement, each chanting, some even wielding megaphones. For the second time that day I felt at home.

**\*\*\***

“All thirty or so of you are here, at my house, cutting little kids in line, to do… what?”

“To normalize adults having fun!” I cheered, my voice echoing down the woman’s driveway like a fart in a silent classroom. 

The TikToker turned back to face me and muttered, “She heard me the first time.” His baby shark tail wagged from the movement, and given that I stood directly behind him… it was sort of awkward.

He crept closer, up onto the porch, and said to the woman standing at the door: “Technically we didn’t cut. They just walked slower. Besides, you can spare a few candy bars… right?

She hid the bowl of large candy bars behind her. “No, I cannot. Have your ‘fun’ elsewhere, these are reserved for appropriately aged trick-or-treaters.” And she was about to shut the door, but the TikToker lodged his foot inside to stop it.

“Please,” he whispered, “just do us this one favor and I promise I’ll take them all home. You’re the tenth house that has turned us down so far.” 

“I… wonder… why,” she said, gritting her teeth and fighting to close the door.

“I know right? Can’t they understand the good we’re doing?” 

“You’re… doing… the most!” She shut the door in his face and the light on her porch turned off, drowning us in that almost dark but not really dark darkness; or I guess 'moonlight'.

“Welp,” he sighed, spinning around to address the thirty of us, and the children we cut in front of, who now stood in the sidelines of the driveway where trimmed hedges served as fences. The kids seemed to be enjoying this brain rot interaction as much as I was. About half of them looked like they religiously watched Speed and Kai. Probably because they were dressed as them for Halloween. 

The TikToker continued after a dramatic pause. “She is right about me doing the most; the most for you and your rights to have fun!”

“We’re not having fun. This just sucks,” said one of the thirty old people. There were some murmured agreements. That I didn’t join in on. The nerve of them.

“Look—” the TikToker steepled his hands— “sometimes life has to keep sucking to get to our climax, ya know?”

“Excuse you? There are kids here!” 

“Right, uh, excuse me.” He cleared his throat. “I’ll go with this analogy: Sometimes life is like a book that begins bad, but gets better after two hundred pages—”

“Why wouldn’t we buy another book that begins ‘good’?” said one of the kids.

“Or just watch the movie adaptation?” another added.

“Or just watch clips on TikTok?” yet another added.

“Or just have AI summarize it for us?” added another in an ‘ermm, actually' nerd voice. It was a whole math equation by now.

“Because…” He put a hand on his salt and pepper chin… “damn, you’re right. But you’re not a part of this.”

The door opened behind the TikToker. “You’re still here? Get the *hell* off my property before I call the police.”

“Excuse you?” gasped the TikToker. The two engaging members and I joined in, gasping dramatically. The TikToker pointed at the sidelines of her driveway. “Can’t you see there are kids here?”

“Oh… I didn’t know–”

“Of course you didn’t.” He shook his head. “The nerve of some people.” 

I chuckled, actually enjoying myself for once. I needed this. Whatever ‘this’ was. It sort of felt like I was physically in one of those corny ‘standing up to a bully’-esque movie scenes shared on TikTok in multiple sped up parts with an AI narration that gets annoying after a while. But that’s just America I guess.

Anyway, the TikToker hopped off the woman’s porch, squeezing through the Adultoween crowd. “Follow me, folk! Let’s head on over to one last house!”

When he had reached the sidewalk, he turned around and found that only I followed. Everyone else, including Miraculous elderly Ladybug and SuperGreatGranddad were either exhausted or heading home. He tried pleading with them, but nothing; they actually had lives to resume in the morning.

Soon enough the leader and I were the only ones left. We stood under the shade of a tree with swaying leaves, or I mean, it would be shade if it were daytime, but it’s nighttime, so it’s nightshade, I guess? *Nightshade… That would make for an awesome sidekick name.* Speaking of which, as I stared at his side profile, I felt there was a sort of bond here; the beginning of a beautiful friendship like the aftermath of Casablanca.

Maybe he could even mentor me, teach me all the things my dad never did. That would be awesome. I pictured him and I as mentor and mentee in fragments as if it were a trailer for an upcoming movie.

He was about to leave before I stopped him. Behind him, the woman’s blanca casa stood symbolically, almost bringing tears to my eye.

“Y-You think you could, uh, you know, take me to one more house?” I asked.

“Really devoted to the movement, eh?” 

“Yeah…”

“Wish I could, but my kids have school in the morning. Gotta make sure they get some sleep.”

“Oh… k-kids?” The mentor and mentee scene fragments in my mind exploded into shrapnel. “You never mentioned that…”

“Yeah, those little buggers are home alone. Just snuck out and told them I’d return with candy, but *somebody* turned us down!” He directed that louder ‘somebody’ towards the open window in the second story of the woman’s white house. “Guess I’ll stop by 7-11 on the way home.” He sighed

I scratched the back of my head. “I gotcha… haha, those kids, am I right?”

“Yup, sometimes I wish I could just leave them. But, you know, ‘consequences’.” He air quoted.

I stared off into blank space, recalling my own parents, and echoed under my breath, “Consequences… Leave them…”

“Now you’re talking! I’ll tell ya what.”

“Huh?” I snapped out of it.

He pulled out a business card and handed it to me. There was a mini pixelated picture of him posing as if presenting us to the Mystery Shack, and a number underneath. “Give me a call sometime. Besides Adultoween, I started up many movements to milk money from TikTok. Like AdultPotterHeads, DisneyAdults, oh, and I'm also a mechanic.”

“Cool, cool, I’ll give you some calls! …Or, I mean, a call. Maybe a ‘from time to time’ sort of thing… Or just whenever I need mechanic work because, ha… ha… it’ll be a bit odd to call you out of the blue. Uh, anyway.”

I looked up from the card, realizing he was already halfway down the sloping street. My head and shoulders drooped. *Fuck this. Fuck parents. They’re all the same.* 

After a few minutes of standing there, arms crossed like a toddler, shifting my weight from one leg to another because the sidewalk was on an incline and these socks and sandals weren’t grippy enough, I thought… *Well*… And looked left and right. *What now?*

It was getting late so appropriately aged trick-or-treaters and porch lights were becoming less frequent. Figured I could knock on a few more houses since I was already up in the Hollywood hills, super far from my car, and had nothing else to do tonight. Plus, I wanted to distract myself from my thoughts. 

I pocketed the card and walked up the inclining street.

The next mansion I approached, neighboring the white one we got turned away from, was beige colored with floor-to-ceiling windows glaring at me like scolding eyes. The driveway split off to the front door and continued down to a ten-car garage that looked like a gaping mouth ready to devour trick-or-treaters, housing nothing but red cars inside which resembled a tongue. Actually, it looked just like a normal mansion with normal windows, but that’s boring.

Though, something about the sheer size of it was scarier than the actual Halloween decorations all over the driveway and lawn. *Capitalism is pretty scary.*

Scarecrows, carved pumpkins, and huge inflatable skeletons flanked the driveway, spooking little kids as they walked by. In their moment of shock, I cut in front of them, then knocked on the door; a lesson I learned from that TikToking prick of a father, just like my real prick of a father only I didn’t learn lessons from him because he left like a coward.

As my mind raced and throbbed with daddy-issue-anger, the door cracked open. I looked up in slow motion. And my eyes widened as I recognized the man who answered.

*Guy Geroux! Holy fuck!* He was an indie Hollywood writer; one that wrote and directed many of my favorite movies like *The Rise of the Air Purifiers in a Dystopian World that is like a Desert on Arrakis*. He got a lot of hate for his long titles, but I defended him behind a screen. And now I was seeing him in the flesh! A little too much flesh admittedly… He was dressed in a Spiderman costume that was tight around his body in all the wrong places.

“Little too old to be trick-or-treating, aren’t ya?” He chuckled majestically, putting out a weird-looking bowl for me to pick candy from, in slow motion, on some David Hasselhoff type shit. The bowl had an enchanted Minecraft glow to it, with weird runes engraved on the outer side.

But the worst part… was that there wasn’t even candy in this bowl. He was one of those types; the people who handed out healthy alternatives to candy. I wasn’t complaining though. 

*Wait, I still haven’t replied… Stop admiring.* “I… I’m, uh, I’m not that old, sir. I’m twenty. One year behind twenty-one, like, you know, *twenty-one*, the Vine meme, haha…” *Shit, stop rambling. And why’d I say that of all things?* “No, I mean, uh, you know, we should normalize adults having fun.”

“Uh-huh…” said Guy, looking at me with a raised gray eyebrow. He sort of looked like Henry Winkler.

“I, uh, love your work!” *Shit. Another blunder. He probably hears that all the time, and I gotta stand out to him.* “Just kidding, haha, it sucks!”

He withdrew the bowl of candy, and slowly backstepped into his house.

“No, I mean, it sucks in a good way! Like…” *Think! Think of an analogy! What would the TikToker say? Hmm… Got it.* “It sucks like a blowjob! In a good way!”

“Oh! You should’ve led with that!” He stepped back out. “Wow, you’re the first person who has ever said that about my work…”

“I-I am?” 

“Yes! And you’re also the first person I’ve said, ‘*Fuck you!*’ to!”

He was still smiling but that “fuck you” was super aggressive, so I didn’t know if it was a joke or what. Plus, Guy was like the kindest guy ever. I doubt he meant it.

I let out a forced laugh to fill the awkward silence.

But he closed the door, and the fanning air smacked me across the face.

I blew it. I had a chance to talk with the creator of my favorite show and I fucking blew it like the opposite of a blowjob, which is a badjob... *What? What am I even thinking? Fuck me, I don’t even make sense. No, don’t fuck me, uh… shit.* 

How I could be that awkward even inside my own mind, I don’t know. What I did know, now that I turned around, was that there was a crowd of shell-shocked parents and snickering kids who all heard our interaction. I could’ve sworn I made out a few recording phones too. So, I did the only thing I could do…

I turned back around. His beige-colored porch luckily had another exit to the side, connecting to the garage. I could avoid the crowd of angry parents and… *huh?*

As I was walking down the side of his porch, I spotted a vintage-looking bong. It had the design of a China vase with a cool looking translucent dragon wrapping around the cylinder. Like the bowl, this bong had an enchanted Minecraft glow to it. It was practically begging for me to grab it, throbbing. And I did embarrass myself horribly, so, maybe this was the gift I deserved from the universe for being born so awkward. It wouldn’t technically be considered stealing, right?

*No, hell no, forget it, stealing is bad.*

**\*\*\***

*…Stealing is bad for normal people, but I’m not normal, so it’s okay.*

I had sauntered down the sloping and winding streets of the Hollywood hills and made my way all the way back to Santa Monica Blvd, nearing Hollywood Forever Cemetery, the bong bulging out of my red leather jacket.

Yes, I stole it. I know, I know, down talk me all you want, it can’t be any worse than the down talk my mind gave me on the way down. Plus, it was just some stupid bong. *Oh no, what’s the Hollywood writer gonna do, call the grammar police? Wait...*

*Shit, what if Guy calls the actual police? I didn’t think of that.*

*Shit. Shit, should I turn back now and return it?* I paused in the middle of an intersection to think, the traffic lights across from me on either side displaying the white stick figure with a countdown. *Time’s ticking. I gotta think harder! Uh…* I looked left where I had come down from, then right to the cemetery. *Was I literally walking to my death? Fuck… hmm…* I stroked my patchy-haired chin. And then some cars started honking. The white walking symbol blinked more rapidly. Urging me to make a choice. I couldn’t consult my For You Page for this choice. There wasn’t nearly enough time.

*Fuck it. It’s just some dumb bong anyway. The TikToker wouldn’t care either.* I hurried to cross the intersection. Soon after, the impatient cars sped by the road, severing any chance of turning back. Unless I waited. But nah. *Forget that.*

After more walking, I was finally by the cemetery’s lush road verge with those two palm trees guarding the entrance.

*This should be a safe place.* I pulled out the glowing bong. The water inside looked like cool blue Gatorade. With a consistency of syrup. The sloshing liquid lagged when I shook the bong. And the outer enchanted glow also rippled from the movement, only with a faster reaction time as if it had lower ping. It was such an odd visual. Sort of looked like those double-layered Disney cups with liquid and glitter floating about, trapped in the interior.

*This shit better give me a good high at the very least, then it would have some use*, I thought. *I could use it to gain confidence with the ladies…* Okay… yeah that sounded better in my mind’s pre-mind.

Anyway, using the handy-dandy pink lighter I always kept in my jacket’s pocket, I lit the weed already packed in the bowl and inhaled deeply. It tasted like… I clicked my tongue to make sure… it tasted like ass; not ass-ass, just ass, as in bad. That shit made me cough worse than hitting a fake cart.

After a bit of coughing, and passersby ignoring me because they were probably so used to the sight, my vision started rippling like the enchanted glow, only for it to clear just as soon as it came. *Huh?* I thought. *What was that?* It sort of looked like a shitty transition in a school presentation.

I focused on one of two palm trees to my right-hand side, but the cemetery and everything surrounding it was pushed miles away like a dolly zoom effect from the movies. It made my head hurt… or was that from the bong? Shit, I didn’t know. I focused on the security booth, and again everything surrounding *it* ran away. Everything surrounding something I was focusing on looked like jumping into hyperspace in Star Wars. And it was disorienting to say the least. I needed to throw up. Vomit clawed its burning hands up my throat, scaling up and up and… back down once I stifled it. But there was still that uncomfortable burning sensation that no amount of swallowing can relieve. I needed water worse than SpongeBob when he was in Sandy’s house.

My eyes kept darting about. The visual hallucination—or whatever was going on—made me feel as if I was trying to focus on several monitors simultaneously out of fear that some animatronic would FNAF jumpscare at me. 

What did stay stationary though, clear as day, were lights. Light from light posts traveled down in wonky waves. Headlights blurred past in the street, leaving behind multiple snail-like slime trails of light. And the worst was the light emitted by glowing apparitions behind the prison-like fence of the cemetery. I jolted back on spotting them, nearly jumping out of my skin like Bruce leaving Hulk’s body.

Seeing those apparitions was what made my legs give. They Bambi-ed, wobbling for a bit. Then the next thing I knew, I had face-planted onto the cold concrete, vision exploding into stars temporarily.

I rolled over on my back, groaning like a dad who was out drinking all night and woke up to an annoying iPhone alarm with a throbbing hangover. Then I kept rolling until the road verge grass was cushioning me. My face felt all fucked up; swollen, scratched, blood slithering down it.

The bong I’ve been gripping onto slipped from my hands, plopping down to lay beside me as if we were a married couple who had just finished arguing but still needed to pretend they loved one another for the child who was in the other room behind paper-thin walls listening to everything. Me.

*This can’t get any worse,* I thought. Then, of course, ‘this’ got worse.

I opened my eyes and saw a glowing ghost hovering above me. *Okay, no. No. Not real. I’m definitely tripping.* The way it looked at me from this angle had me feeling like I tried to ask Deebo for my bike back.

“How’s it going?” the humanoid ghost asked. Its facial features were blurred through my hazy eyes.

My mouth flopped open. Swollen lips making me feel like I had participated in the Kylie Jenner challenge. No words came out though. They couldn’t. As much as I tried. *This is not real. Not real.* I shut my eyes, and by then, with all the pain aching in my face, I just accepted my fate, letting my head fall back.

“...Looks like it’s going to shit if this is who I’m stuck with,” it answered its own question.

It was still there. The ghost was still fucking there. I opened my eyes and let out a controversial Darth Vader scream.
