The forest wasn’t on any map. Caleb had scoured every dusty atlas he could find in the county library, tracing the jagged lines of rivers and highways, but none of them led to that place. Yet there it was, just past the old cemetery on the outskirts of Dunwich, where the pines stood taller than any trees had a right to be, their needled tops scraping the low-hanging clouds.

It had been whispered about for years, the stuff of campfire tales and drunken confessions. The locals called it the Gloamwood—a name that rolled off tongues in hushed, wary tones. “Ain’t nothing good in there,” old Mr. Haskell had told Caleb at the general store one rainy afternoon, his milky eyes narrowing beneath his frayed cap. “People go in, sure as sunrise, but they don’t come back the same… if they come back at all.”

But Caleb was seventeen and restless. He wasn’t afraid of spooky stories or grizzled old men with yellowed teeth. Life in Dunwich was as dull as dishwater, and the idea of an uncharted forest just beyond his reach was too tantalizing to resist.

The entrance was easy to miss. A narrow path, almost swallowed by moss and undergrowth, wound its way into the shadows. Caleb hesitated for a moment, the hairs on the back of his neck prickling, but then he pressed forward, the thrill of the unknown tugging him deeper into the Gloamwood.

The air changed almost immediately. It was heavier here, thick with the scent of damp earth and something sweeter, almost cloying, like overripe fruit. The sunlight dimmed, replaced by a greenish glow that seemed to emanate from the trees themselves. Their bark shimmered faintly, as if laced with veins of liquid gold. Strange flowers with petals like silk and thorns like glass sprouted from the forest floor, their colors shifting when Caleb moved past them.

Then came the whispers.

At first, Caleb thought it was just the wind threading through the trees, but the sounds were too deliberate, too… human. They spoke in a language he didn’t understand, words that curled and twisted in his mind like smoke. He shook his head, trying to clear it, but the whispers grew louder, mingling with the soft crunch of his boots on the mossy path. A branch snapped behind him, sharp and sudden, and he spun around, his breath hitching. The shadows seemed to ripple, something large and hunched just out of sight. Caleb’s pulse hammered in his ears, drowning out everything but the growing sense that he was being watched.

That’s when he saw her.

She was sitting on a fallen log, her bare feet dangling above the ground, pale as the moon. Her hair was dark and wild, spilling over her shoulders like ink. She wore a tattered dress that might’ve been white once, though now it was stained with mud and something darker. Her eyes locked onto Caleb, and he froze. They weren’t like any eyes he’d ever seen. They were silver, not just the color but the actual sheen of metal, reflecting the faint glow of the forest around them.

“You shouldn’t be here,” she said, her voice low and musical, carrying an edge of warning.

Caleb found his voice, though it came out hoarse. “I didn’t mean to… I was just curious.”

Her lips curved into a faint smile that didn’t reach her eyes. “Curiosity is dangerous here. The Gloamwood has a way of keeping those it likes.”

“And if it doesn’t like you?” Caleb asked, his throat dry.

The smile vanished. “Then it spits you out… in pieces.”

Something rustled in the bushes behind him, louder this time, like heavy footsteps crunching the underbrush. Caleb whipped around, heart pounding, but saw nothing. When he turned back, the girl was standing now, impossibly close, her silver eyes burning into his. The metallic scent of her clung to the air, sharp and unnatural. Her smile twisted, revealing teeth that were too long, too sharp.

“You should run,” she whispered, but her tone was mocking now, almost hungry.

The whispers grew louder, more insistent, and Caleb realized with a jolt that they were coming from the trees themselves. Faces began to emerge in the bark—twisted, anguished faces with hollow eyes and mouths frozen mid-scream. One of them opened its mouth, and a low, guttural moan escaped, sending a chill racing down Caleb’s spine.

He turned to run, but his legs wouldn’t move. The air grew colder, and the golden veins in the bark began to pulse, casting flickering shadows that seemed to dance and leer at him. A branch lashed out from the shadows, narrowly missing his face, and he stumbled backward.

The girl laughed, a sound like breaking glass. She stepped closer, her silver eyes glowing brighter. “You wanted to see the Gloamwood, didn’t you? It sees you now.”

Caleb’s voice broke in a strangled cry as the faces in the trees began to shift and stretch, their mouths moving in silent, agonized screams. Something sharp scraped across his arm, and he looked down to see a thin line of gold bleeding from his skin. It burned, and he cried out, his knees buckling.

The girl crouched in front of him, her head tilting like a curious predator. “You might survive,” she said softly, her breath cold against his cheek. “But it’ll take something from you first.”

Suddenly, the forest blurred and swirled like a painting caught in a storm. Caleb felt himself falling, though his feet never left the ground. A deafening roar filled his ears, and then… silence.

When the world settled, the Gloamwood was gone. Caleb found himself standing at the edge of the cemetery, the sun dipping low on the horizon. The whispers had stopped, and the air felt normal again, light and breathable. But his hands were shaking, and when he looked down, he saw a faint smear of gold on his skin where the girl had touched him.

He never spoke of the Gloamwood again, but on quiet nights, when the wind was still, he swore he could hear the whispers calling his name, tempting him back to the forest that wasn’t on any map.
