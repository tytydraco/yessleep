Jesus, it’s like one step forward and two steps back for everything in life lately. Thought things were going well, finally found a new job, a new place to rent, and getting my life back together. 

NOPE. 

So last week was the first night in the new place. I was up for most of the night unpacking and just generally nervous for the first day at my new job. This place wasn’t too bad, all things considered. I was expecting it to be more run down considering how low the rent was, but for a two-bedroom outside Atlanta, it was way more nice than I expected.

It was probably around one in the morning. I had tried lying down to sleep for a while but ended up just tossing and turning. The heat was unbearable, and I didn’t want to already run up the electric bill before I even got my first check from work. My mind was just racing, getting over everything that had happened in the past few weeks with relocating and basically starting my life over. 

Finally decided to step out on the porch for a smoke. Grabbed the little one-hitter I already had packed to go off the dresser, threw a t-shirt on, and headed out onto the front porch. The small light flickered on as I hit the sauna of Georgia summer. Humidity immediately made sweat form on my arms with nowhere to go, almost dousing me in just seconds. God, why didn’t I relocate north?

Looking up and down the street it was a little surprising. Every house in the neighborhood was relatively nice, with even a couple of McMansions popping up here and there. The only thing that really seemed out of place was the cemetery down the road, maybe about seventy-five graves in it. From what the landlord said it was an old funeral plot from before Atlanta started expanding out. For some reason, the city decided not to move it at the request of the family and the original owners. Hell, I grew up in the rural south so having random graveyards around backroads neighborhoods wasn’t anything new.

Except now something looked different over there. There were lights floating around among the graves, but not quite like flashlights. It looked more like glowsticks drifting through the headstones, with just a faint contained light coming from them. I shrugged it off and pulled out my lighter, probably just some kids fucking around on a dare. None of my concerns. 

Until I saw the people walking down the street from further down. I could barely make out faint lights, flickering, ghostly flames under the dark sky. Whoever was carrying them was almost unseeable, dressed in dark clothing that blended into the asphalt. They weren’t alone, though.

I’m not sure how long I held my breath, but as the parade came closer to the cemetery more figures materialized from the darkness. They were too far away for me to make out, and god knows my glasses prescription is out of date, but everyone looked like they had their heads bowed in mourning. I could tell they weren’t moving naturally though, almost like they were just sliding right over the asphalt. Suddenly there was a noise that broke the total silence, like wood dragging across concrete. Turns out, I wasn’t far off.

A wagon came into view, with a wooden coffin on top. I almost laughed, seeing the old-styled coffin-like Dracula would sleep in on his day off. Except right now I was frozen in fear, still mystified by the procession of mourners slowly turning into the graveyard. Eventually, they all filed in, standing among the headstones as the coffin was brought forward, stopping right in front of one huge massive headstone right in the middle. 

Once the wagon stopped dragging I could  hear the other noise finally. Someone was banging against wood, muffled screams coming through faintly. Terrified crying continued, the sound of thumps against sturdy wood growing louder. There was someone in the coffin, and some of the mourners were now carrying it toward the massive headstone. As they set it down right side up against the grave, one stepped forward. All I could hear was the faint cry of help coming from within. I had dropped my lighter at this point, the unlit pipe still in my hand. 

One of the mourners stepped forward, opening up the coffin from the side. A younger woman burst out, hands up ready to fight for her life. Before she even had a chance to figure out what was going on though, two more stepped forward to hold her.

I could see her clearly against all the other figures, but this far away it was hard to make out any features. She had long, bright pink and green hair, and dark skin, and was short compared to the others. Only one more bloodcurdling scream was all she could muster before suddenly she was gone, as she fell down into one of the graves suddenly. I couldn’t even comprehend it before a dog barking distracted me, suddenly pulling me back into reality. 

It was cold, and freezing even in the July heat. Nothing felt right, with the air in my lungs growing sparse. Looking back up, the cemetery was totally empty. Not a damn thing there but still air, nothing moving as the wind started blowing down the street. I was frozen to my damn core. Don’t think I fell asleep until early in the morning hours, with only minutes before my alarm went off for work. 

I still don’t know what’s happening here, though. Every night I’ve noticed the same thing, though now I just watch out of my window. This is the first I’ve even told anyone because it just feels like I’m being paranoid. Hell, I would think I was wrong if there wasn’t a picture of a missing girl hanging all over the MARTA station nearby. Even without being able to see her up close, I could still recognize that hairstyle though, and everything about her with height and skin color matched up. I saw the girl go missing, but what the hell do I do? Nobody is going to believe me if I report that she got dragged into a cemetery and disappeared, right?

Besides I just fucking moved here. If they don’t write me off as fucking batshit then they’ll probably just try to pin it on me and wrap the case up. God… just one fucking day of peace would be [nice](https://linktr.ee/googlyeyes93).
