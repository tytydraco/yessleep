It's taken me a while to start writing this. You don't know me, but my name is Adrian. I just got out of the hospital, and my right hand is still broken, but I need to warn everyone. Whatever this place is, it needs to be forgotten. Just the faintest memory is a death sentence. I barely survived.

All of this started spiraling out of control about two months ago, while I was helping my mom move boxes out of storage. I'll try to recall it all as best I can, as it happened. But please forgive me if the grammar is off or some events don't make total sense. It's all still very raw...

Just a regular Tuesday. Had the day off from work, so I planned on just relaxing with my wife. Unfortunately, my mom had other plans. She called me while we were watching old episodes of *King of the Hill.*

"Hey, Mom, what's up?"

She responded with heavy breath and a strained voice. "Hey, honey. I don't mean to bother you, but I'm trying to move out some old boxes from the garage to sell, and your father isn't here to help. Could you come down and help me take down the heavier things?"

I sighed and hid my groan. I know better than to let my mom hear any kind of disdain when she asks me to help her. That's how I get a 45-minute-long guilt trip. So, sacrificing my current pleasure, I told my mom with an overacted enthusiasm, "Yeah, of course I can. When do you want me over?"

Of course, I was there within 20 minutes, helping my mom lift these, maybe 50-pound boxes max.

While we were going through, I grabbed an old shoebox with a piece of duct tape and writing on it:

*"Adrian's Treasure! (HANDS OFF DAD) 2000 04/11"*

I popped it open and began looking through. It was things I had expected, like old toys, cool rocks, and a laminated Pokémon card of a shiny Hitmonlee. Don't know why I liked him so much—probably because of *Karate Kid.*

But what really caught my attention was a small gold coin underneath a lanyard with all the Ninja Turtles on it. I had good taste. Picking up the coin, I quickly realized it was actually a token for some arcade. The name on the front of the token said *"Last Level!"* in retro-style lettering. The back had a symbol on it: an odd upside-down triangle with a circle in the middle. But it was off-centered and to the left of the coin, kind of like someone messed up pressing it into the token. Maybe even like it was etched in by a knife.

But I never remembered this arcade. I was probably really young. If I made this in 2000, I was only ten years old, but I still remember some things at that age—specifically important things like birthdays and playing my new N64 with *GoldenEye 007.* So it felt kind of odd not remembering this place, since it counted as one of my treasures.

Turning to my mom, who was taking one of her very spontaneous lemonade and Facebook breaks since I got there, I held out the token.

"Hey, do you remember ever taking me to some place called the Last Level Arcade? I can't remember ever going."

She turned and leaned forward, adjusting her glasses. Sometimes I forget she's getting older. She was a smaller woman with brown hair that had faint streaks of white in it. But she had a fiery Italian spirit straight from the old country. She looked at it longer than I expected and responded with an unenthusiastic shrug.

"Not sure. We might've been to one in New-Ridge before moving, but I don't remember. Maybe ask your dad when he's home from Clint's."

That's odd. Sure, my mom wasn't as young as I remember, but there's no way she wouldn't remember something like that. She's got the memory of an elephant for the smallest of things I don't even remember as an adult. So something like going to an arcade—or even having an arcade in our hometown—should be far from something she'd forget.

But I knew better than to press her on it. If she said she didn't remember, then that's the truth.

About an hour later, my dad got home from Clint's. Stepping through the door with a sigh of relief and a large popping stretch that followed with a satisfied groan. He was tall like me, fully gray hair but still full and well groomed. He didn't notice me initially while I was in the kitchen. But when he did, his face lit up—always such a happy man, especially when I came in for surprise visits.

"Well, look who it is. Thought I'd be sleeping with the worms before you gave us a visit," he stated with a hefty, deep-chested chuckle. "Ah, I'm just pulling your leg, son. It's always good to see ya. So, what's with the visit?"

Before I spoke, my mom called from the kitchen.

"Don't be teasing him, Arnold! He helped me move the boxes you were supposed to take a week ago!"

My dad met my eyes and spun his index finger in tandem with his eyes next to his head before gesturing me to follow him into the smoking room on the side of the house. A man cave of sorts, filled with hard liquor and enough cigars to burn a hole in the ozone layer, the size of Mount Logan.

He sat down, gesturing me to sit in the La-Z-Boy adjacent to his, and he lit up a cigar.

"Alright, spit it out," he said before glancing my way with a raised eyebrow. "I know that look in your eye, son, when you've got something you wanna ask."

I chuckled. Of course he knew. "I found something while looking through those old boxes with Mum. Wanted to know if you knew about it."

I then reached for the pocket of my flannel, popping the button before sliding out the gold coin and holding it out to him.

My father is many things. An ex-soldier and longtime cop. I've never seen him flinch at some of the most horrific shit. So when the color left his face at the sight of this token, it was... uncomfortable. Like a faint glimpse of an entirely different person peeked out from behind my own father's eyes.

"Where'd you find that?"

I paused at his question.

"I told you it was in this old box. Are you ok? Is something the matter, Dad?"

I watched, puzzled, as my father shook his head and put out his practically fresh cigar before putting a hand on his now noticeably sweat-soaked forehead.

"I-I don't know... I don't know why, but that coin—it's... get rid of it."

My eyes widened, puzzled. He was clearly confused and said he didn't know what the coin was. So why was he like this?

"Dad, do you know what this i—"

"GET THE FUCK RID OF IT!"

His sudden shift to anger and fear rattled me out of my sentence, and I froze, staring like a deer in headlights.

We met eyes, and he took a deep breath. Likely noticing my shock at his outburst, he calmly stated, "I'm going to sleep, son. I don't know what that coin is, but... there's something in it. Something wrong. I can't... I don't know how to explain it. Just... don't look where you don't belong, ok? Some things are meant to be forgotten."

And that's how the conversation ended. After he stepped out, leaving his barely smoked cigar in the ashtray, he looked perfectly fine. No sideways glance or indication the conversation even happened.

So after the dinner of chicken dumplings and hot, fresh, homemade apple pie, I went home. Arms full of leftovers and a mind racing with thoughts. Too many to even list. The most prominent being how the token ended up in my coat pocket when I got home...

So of course I took my father's advice. His response clearly warranted some substantial concern. For about two weeks, the token just sat in the drawer of my desk without any mind to it. I even forgot about my father's outburst that evening. The anger and shock in his expression faded away as just stress or his PTSD acting up.

But that ignorant bliss was far from permanent. Because that's when the nightmares started. Initially they were plain—hell, even too foggy and dull to remember. Usually it was a hallway. A long, dark hallway with black carpet that had an intricate design of spaceships, stars, and planets. There weren't any lights either, at least not in the traditional sense. Long strips of interchanging colors lined the seams of the four corners of the endless hall, bouncing between different patterns in almost a strobe-like effect but more fluent and deliberately patterned.

I wandered the endless halls for what felt like hours. The smell of fresh pizza radiated through with such intensity it was almost nauseating. And the only sound was the distant blinking and hum of arcade cabinets. But no matter how long or how hard I searched for its source, the noise felt as if it was always at the same distance.

The nightmares stayed like this for about four days—just endless searching—until one night it was different. Over the week of these dreams, that sound of arcade blinking's and zaps was slowly met with the sound of laughter and talking. Day after day, more voices joined the faint sounds until they were equal in volume. Then that night came.

After a long day at work, talking with my wife at dinner about her recent mural she painted for a local bakery—a project she was finally finishing after over three weeks of daily and continuous effort—I was always proud of her dedication and creativity. Glad it never seeped out as we got older.

Eventually we both had settled ourselves in the comforting sheets and let our minds be drug into sleep.

There I was again, standing in those halls. The corridors were twisting and turning as usual, but this time the lights—they weren't flashing their usual colors. Just a pale white lit up the four corners of the corridors. I also noticed the lack of noise. The machines and voices that were once in the background and generally disregarded by my wandering mind were now barren and silent.

I felt nervous. More uncomfortable than I'd ever been. Up until now, I had only considered these as odd dreams with some hidden meaning. Some bullshit about my inner self you'd Google on an astrology website and eventually find out about some trauma you don't actually have.

I continued to wander. Step after step the carpet beneath my feet felt doughy, harder and harder to plant the next foot.

The corridors looked like they were twisting, wrapping around themselves and swallowing malleable wood and varnish. Like a snake swallowing its own damn tail. And god the smell. Once a pungent pizza now reeking of burnt sugar and copper. Black mold and water logged rot. I would have puked if I could have.

Then the noise came. First it was those laughs and blinks, the same as what I heard many nights before but it didn't stay the same. The cacophony of laughter and beeps grew in volume. What was once discernable sound now was a amalgamation of noises that wouldn't fit a sound no matter how desperately I searched.

Then they began to scream.

It was so sudden and fast, ripping my mind in two directions as I didn't even get to fully contemplate the lack of noise before I was overwhelmed by it. And it wasn't in the distance or faint. The screaming was all around me—in my ears, in my mind, leaking from the coiling walls. Mostly incoherent, But what was heard could only be begging, mixed in with the sound of smashing glass and violently aggressive shouting from someone far older but more unintelligible.

"MOMMY PLEASE, MOMMY HELP!"

and

"I DON'T WANNA PLAY ANYMORE! MY FINGERS HURT!"

I fell to the carpet that felt wet beneath my face, coating my forehead in a slick oil. My hands desperately clasped my ears in a feverish and worthless attempt to block the noise that was already in my mind.

Then it stopped.

Slowly opening my eyes to see the red-slicked carpet and alleviating my hands' clasp over my ears, I stared down the blood-soaked hall. Black silhouettes littered it, endlessly staring into my being. Even without faces I feel the desperate agonizing hope pouring over my blood soaked face. But the sound of a choppy and mechanical malicious chuckle echoing through the halls shot me awake.

Shooting up from my bed in a breathless, sweaty state, I rushed out of the sheets at a manic pace, startling Carrie as I leaned over our sink in the bathroom, splashing ice-cold water onto my face and breathing harder than I ever have.

Obviously, Carrie came quickly, shocked and terrified at my sudden, breathless awakening. We sat in the shower together, cool water pouring over us as I told her everything—the nightmare, my mother and father's odd behavior, and finally the token. It all started with this token, and I still knew nothing about it.

"They were so loud... They were begging for whatever was hurting them to stop. Oh god, it felt so real..." I said breathlessly as she nestled her face into the side of my neck, gently brushing the stubble on my jaw.

"It was a nightmare, Adrian. Just breathe. We can look more into it tomorrow. Just try and stay calm, ok?" Carrie said, kissing my cheek.

She was so gentle and caring. I was rarely this worked up over anything, but whenever I was, she'd always be there—to sit with me in the shower, in my comfort space, and reassure me. One of the many reasons I fell in love with her back then. Even though I'm surprised she settled with a guy like me, I'll always be grateful for her.

The rest of that week was the same. That nightmare kept coming to me, kept rattling me. I became stressed and could barely sleep. If I didn't work from home, I probably would've had to call in. I definitely got a few of my commissions finished late.

But it didn't matter. Those images wouldn't leave my head—when I brushed my teeth, when I ate breakfast, hell, even when I was driving. I tried everything—pills, sleep therapy, even just sleeping on my couch—but it wouldn't stop.

And god, for the longest time I didn't even think about that token until I was looking for eyedrops and just stumbled upon it again in my drawer. I'm not a very superstitious person, but even I was desperate for some solution to this. So I put it outside in my mailbox, under some old magazines that the previous owner must've left inside.

And my night was fine. No dreams, no images, nothing.

After telling Carrie, she said maybe it was my mind tricking itself. That having the token in my back thoughts must have made my brain conjure some terrifying imagery about some endless arcade I've never been to.

I still wish she was right...

I'll post this part for now. Not sure when the next will come. I've been taking quite a few painkillers, and my hand is barely functional. If anyone cares—if anyone values the lives of their own, of their CHILDREN—please read this.

Please tell as many people as you can. And if anyone has any questions. Anything that you want to know that could help, please ask. I'll answer to the best of my abilities.

Forget the Last Level...
