I met Stella at a Starbucks. I’m not much of a coffee drinker, but I’d had to pee something fierce, and ducked in to find a line of three guys in front of the only restroom. “Fuck,” I muttered, rocking on my heels. A curly haired girl in glasses watched me from behind her macbook. 

“Wow, looks like you need to go pretty bad, huh?” She closed her eyes and one by one, the line broke up as they left the shop, some walking, some running. 

“What the?” One of the guys had even dropped his backpack. 

“Lucky you, I guess. You have to go, so go.” She returned to her laptop. 

“Oh thank Jesus,” After I went in and unleashed my torrent of piss, I went back out to find her. “What happened back there?”


“Pink polo heard his car alarm. Fauxhawk saw an old lady fall down. Blue backpack there saw a velociraptor.” She pointed at the two guys who’d come back looking all confused, and the guy’s backpack. 


“A velociraptor?” 


“It’s the dinosaur from Jurassic-”

“I know what a velociraptor is, why’d he see it?” 

“Because you looked way too cute to be that miserable, and because anything is infinitely more entertaining than memorizing the Krebs cycle.” She closed her macbook and looked at me. My neck got hot. 


“Well shit, I don’t know how you did that, but can I get you a coffee or something? That was pretty cool.” 

That day, I learned that her name was Stella, what a macchiato was, that she could do weird shit, and she was cool as fuck. She’d close her eyes, think about something, and anyone she was near would see it. 

I offered her a ride to her dorm, which, in hindsight, sounded creepy, but she had superpowers, so I figured she could handle herself. On the way back, she made a slow driver think a cop was pulling them over, and we enjoyed the big ol open road ahead of us. I pulled over to the side of the hill by her dorm and we sat looking over the city. 

“So it’s almost midnight. Could you make the sun rise? I mean, make me think the sun’s rising?” I tore open a box of natty and handed her a can. 

“Easily. And more. But I won’t.” She cracked the can, chugged it, and reached for another one. I just about fell in love with her right then and there. 

“Look, your powers are yours. I’m not saying you hafta use them in a way. But I mean, you’re pretty awesome. And you’re hanging with me. So, not to toot my own horn, but my guess is you might like me. Why not show off a little? It’s not like they’re a secret.” We sat real quiet for a while, except for me slurping my beer. 

“What, and you’d just sit here all mesmerized while I stare off into the darkness?” 

“I dunno, beats us both sitting in the dark of my car drinking warm beer. Don’t you get tired of, like, everything?” 

“I’m not getting tired of you anytime soon.” She leaned over and we smooched. Okay it was more like a little peck. She kissed me. On the cheek. It was nice. I took her back. 

Anyway, that was the first day I met Stella, so you can see why I got her number after, and hung out loads, and asked her to be my girlfriend. And it was great, I’d pick her up in between shifts and take her downtown and she’d buy like ten frozen pizzas so she’d have something to eat between classes. I’d crash at her place and wash down one of the pizzas with a couple beers. She liked horror movies, and I got her a Ghostface mask for her birthday which tickled her pink. 

And then her mom answered one of those spam calls and emptied her bank account, and the money dried up for her to keep going to college, so she dropped out. And to add more shit onto the shit pile, she didn’t exactly approve of me, something about “having no future”. I mean she was probably right, but it still hurt, and besides, we liked each other. So I didn’t see Stella for a few weeks, which sucked, until I got a text asking me to go to a hotel room. 

Shit, I never drove over so fast, I must’ve broken like fifteen traffic laws. It was a fancy place in the middle of town, which was a little surprising, given her lack of money. They had a guy standing there in front of the front door, a guy standing there in front of the bathroom, a guy standing there in front of some random wooden box they just propped up in the hallway. Lots of guys standing around. Anyway, I got over to her room, which was a really nice one, and after an intense makeout session and some fun, it was time for the worst conversation of my life. 

“So you’re probably wondering.” Damn, she looked so pretty when she was hiding something. Or maybe I just hadn’t seen her in so long. 

“The fancy hotel? Your momma?” I reached over and touched her shoulder, but she shrank back.

“Yeah. She’s… happy.” She looked a little worried. 

“Did you?” 


“She thinks everything is going great, and she’s part of this big happy loving family. She thinks I went back to college, and that I’ll graduate with honors in a few months.” She smiled while she said this but her voice shook like she was about to cry. 

“Ah. What happens then?” 


“I’m still figuring that out.” 


“How long can your illusions even last, anyway?” 

“I’m still figuring that out.” 


“How’d you get this hotel room?” 

“It’s not mine. The guy who’s room this is was a real creep who thinks the FBI are after him.” She started picking at the skin on her fingernails. 

“So he ran?” 

“He’s… in the closet.” My heart pounded in my chest. 

“Shit. So he was spying on us?” 

“No, he thought his life was over, so he killed himself.” She squeezed me tight and cried into my shoulder. 

“Stella, what the fuck?” I pushed her away and headed for the closet. “You killed someone? Did you kill your mom too?” 


She stopped crying. Now she sounded mad. “What? Everything I said to you has been the truth.” 

“You didn’t tell me you killed someone until I got here, until after we fucked. That doesn’t sound entirely truthful to me.” It was my turn to be mad. “Stella, this is really bad.” 

She slid towards me. I slid back. “I’m going to check the closet, maybe he just ate pills or something, maybe we can save him.” 

She grabbed my hand. “Jacob, I was going to ask you to run away with me. I had it all planned out. But you- you just pushed me away, and now you’re arguing with me when I needed you the most!” 

I slid off the bed and swatted her hand away, making a beeline for the closet door. She shouted at my back. 

“You’re going to slip into a perfect paradise. You won’t want for anything anymore. You can leave your boring pizza delivery job behind. You can leave me behind. Go ahead, enjoy your fake world!” 

“Stella, we can fix this, just let me help!” I threw open the door. And the entire room melted into sand. I was alone, on a beach at sunrise by a resort, like you see in the movie posters. 

“Goodbye, Jacob. I’m sorry.” 

Long story short, the hotel was even nicer than the one in the real world. It had every food I could ever want, cooked perfectly. I’d spend my days walking down the beach, exploring this weird new world full of beautiful people, delicious food, and breathtaking sunrises. It was paradise, and then I woke up in a psych ward ten years later. The last week has been a blur, what the doctors are calling a medical miracle. I’ve been picking up the pieces of my life and after considering the options, Stella, if you’re still out there, I just woke up from paradise. I have the same phone number. Could you put me back in?
