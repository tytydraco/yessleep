Hello everyone! This is June Lornelle from The Hillston Gazette and I found this old notebook and whoever wrote it was either crazy or… I don't know it’s really weird. My little brother who’s on these forum things said I should talk to those here about it. I suppose to start, the notebook is one of those black and white composition notebooks that just says “Therapy Journal” on the front. Sounds normal right? Well, it gets *weird* and I'm not sure what I just read. Read for yourselves and see what you guys think.

 So I was told to buy one of these because its good to have something to track your thoughts and feelings in. Something like that. So I suppose I should start by saying everything's gone to shit and I'm starting therapy for it. My girlfriend left me for her ex, my car is totaled, and my rent is overdue. Oh yea, also my boss just called me a deadbeat and fired me. I worked there for 6 years and did everything right. I always did what I could to help those suited jackasses in their little offices, but me? I mopped and swept and wiped and cleaned everything for them! Hence the therapy, I even found a therapist already. I found her in a newspaper ad after my insurance had given me $1400 for the wreck and figured why the hell not? Her name is Dr. Anna Fruna . The Ad showed a small picture of what looked to be a woman but the printer or whatever for the newspaper must’ve malfunctioned as the image had been horribly blurred. Underneath it said “Are you happy?” and listed a number. I hung on the word “Happy” for a moment before I called and set up an appointment with the secretary. She wouldn't give me a name which I thought was a little weird but didn't think twice about it. 

 The appointment which was set for tomorrow (which was really quick in my opinion). Buy yea, the appointment is set and i have a bottle of jack to get me to blissful sleep. I suppose I'll write tomorrow after the appointment.

 Ya know what? So what?! that weird lady walked out and *made* me swerve. I didn’t kill her so what's it matter. Like the lady was literally still up and walking around after I made the *obvious* decision to swerve so as not to hit her. And yet her broken arm was my fault as I barely walked out with 3 broken ribs and the police say, “it's your fault for not *paying attention*” Like what the hell? And then I get 1400$ and a get well card? Whatever, I'll talk to that therapist tomorrow and see what she says. I doubt it'll be worth it though. Also, it may be just be the alcohol but looking at the picture of this therapist lady, I can almost make out a smile but the blurring almost makes it look like she's…drooling? Ah well, this lil notebook ain't too bad, I'll have to thank Ben for giving me the idea.

 God my head, I’m drinking coffee to try to help but damn is it slow going. It’ll have to do, just to have something in my stomach for now. I have to get ready for that appointment and I did remember seeing that drooling smile last night, looking again it's just the same old blurry smudged photo. Anyways, I'm gonna get ready for this thing.

Session notes

  \-Can’t anyone ask how you're doing? 

  \-My parent's death = cynicism? 

  \-Blah blah blah, she’s going on about her family or something or other.

 Okay what the actual hell is wrong with that lady. The session was getting dry and quite boring to be honest. Don’t get me wrong, we talked for the first 40 minutes and it seemed to be how I expected. The whole “so what led you to seek therapy” and “Oh? Tell me more about that”. Things went on like this for about 40 minutes (I kept looking at a wall clock she had in her office.) but then she started on about her family and I feel bad for getting bored. I really do. But it’s like the moment she started speaking of her family I was a kid again, listening to an adult conversation where I have no idea what 75% of the words meant. Then something took me out of my stupor. 

I heard something wet drip on paper. I snapped my head down thinking \*I\* had drooled or something but then i looked back up to see her quickly wipe her mouth. She clearly noticed because she said “Oop, sorry that happens sometimes.” But when she spoke, I swear she sounded so happy. Not embarrassed or dissuaded by her biological slip up but happy. She then asked something that in that tone just sounded wrong.

“Are you happy?”

Why, just why would you even ask that. I just told this lady how my life was falling apart at the seams and how my parents had died when I was kid and her one question after her own family rantings was “*Are you happy?”* ?! What the hell!!! Of COURSE I’M NOT HAPPY LADY. 

She asked again in that ecstatic tone “Are you? Are you happy Michael?”

My face cringed in abject disgust and said “No Dr. Fruna, No i’m not.”

Her face dropped as she rose her head from behind that large Notepad that I just realized she had been trying to seemingly hide behind. “Thats no good Michael, I’ll need to change that” The tone had shifted, almost angry now. 

“I-I guess so Doc, I’ll be countin on ya.” I said trying to hold the nerves from my voice. 

I got up to leave pointing to the clock. “Sorry, I just realized I had a job interview I have to be at now *heh*” I said, trying to leave without being disrespectful. She was hurriedly writing something on the notepad as she tore it out and handed it to me. It was an address, 446 Messer St. Confused, I looked at her. 

 “Come here for our next session, okay? It’s my family's home and I’d like to have our session there. Tomorrow should be good, yes? I will say it’s quite comfortable, I'll have food and drink there so make sure to come hungry!” 

At this I realized how weird i was being, “Are you happy” isn't necessarily a weird question is it? She probably sounded like that so as not to sound pitying or too passive. “Sounds good Doc! See you tomorrow.” And I swear as I left, I heard that same drip sound behind the closing door. *Drip drip drip*  3 drips before the door closes, no longer allowing any sound to escape. I didn't realize when I was in there just how quiet it was. I guess if a patient yells or cries those in the hallways wouldn't want to hear. I walked out waving at the squat brown-haired girl at the desk and opening the front door I realized I hadn't paid much attention to the building as I walked in before. It's a plain 2 story concrete box with tall slits for windows. The door’s a plain wooden door with a large pane of glass in the top half.

I don’t know what I got from that but I suppose it felt good to talk about my parents at least. They've been gone for so long now I can barely remember what they looked like, just vague shapes with feelings attached to them. I just called Ben on a payphone and he said he’s down to hit the bar. The therapy was a lot cheaper than I thought it'd be so I can spare to buy a few rounds. Besides, I want to talk to Ben to see if his experience with therapy was similar.

 I'm at the bar, Ben’s not showing up. Gonna get started without him. It's a good thing i got this notebook though, it kinda feels nice to just talk my thoughts out like this.

What the fuck man, I just saw Ben walk by the bar with those suit dicks laughing. I have half a mind to go out there but this Budweiser smells so much like dad… reminds me of when I snuck a drink of his beer and had to spit it out immediately it was so gross. Funny how things like that change. I miss my Mom and Dad…

Oct 5th, 1991

 I’m about to leave for today's appointment. Kind of feels weird to go to this lady's family home for what I assume will be a deep interrogation of my childhood. However, before I leave for that something weird happened last night I want to get written down and maybe I'll feel less crazy about the whole thing. On my walk home I had to stop for a moment because my heavy breathing started reminding me of my broken ribs. It was after about 2 minutes of standing in front of a darkened alley that I heard footsteps in front of me. I must’ve been drunkenly wobbling because I could've sworn I had left room for people to walk past me on the sidewalk but he ended up bumping into me. I couldn't see much of the man, but he was tall and thin. His thin stature made me more confident in my stocky build as I hollered out. 

 “Hey jackass! Did you not see me?”

  He continued walking when he replied calmly without turning “we’ll keep a better eye out, sorry.”

I almost had said something about how it was just him, but he was even further now and I didn't feel like yelling out that loud and getting a public disturbance charge. So I walked home and realized my door was unlocked. I had thought my apartment had been broken into but nothing was missing. My non-importants were packed and ready for when my settlement ran out and couldn't pay rent any longer and nothing was missing. All I ended up finding was a thin handprint on my window. I couldn't tell if it was on the inside or outside but thought to call the cops nonetheless. I had to go downstairs to use the lobby payphone but doing so I called the cops, and they showed 20 minutes later obviously seeing that I was wasted. By the time we got upstairs and got to the window, I saw it had disappeared but there was something else as we walked in. I could've sworn I closed the door behind me. I must've been way more wasted than I thought because I blurted “Shitfaced” loudly, making the younger of the two policemen jump. 

“Excuse me?” said the older cop. Guy must’ve been a Lethal Weapon fan ‘cause he sounded like he was doing a Murtaugh impression.

“Oh damn, sorry man. I just realized how messed up I am.” I responded slurring sheepishly.

The cop chuckled saying he’d been there a time or two but not to make a habit of it. I chuckled back, assuring I wouldn't make the same mistake again. As the cops left and I locked my door I walked back to the window where the now missing handprint was and decided I needed to sleep for tomorrow's session.

And that was that. I still think it was all weird but I mean then again, I was *really* drunk. I'm gonna put my shoes on and head to this address. I'll keep my thoughts recorded but I don't know how much I'll get to put down seeing as apparently we'll be eating too.

Hey guys, June here. Just wanted to jump in and say I’m transcribing these entries from handwriting and so it may take awhile to get the whole thing put on here. Between that, the research and the primary story I was assigned. “Local man saves dog from coyote.” takes up my free time so make sure to keep an eye out for that in next week's print of The Hillston Gazette.
