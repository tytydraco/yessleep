My best friend's cry was ear-piercing. My head was reeling; it took me a moment to process [what had happened](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13m8e9w/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_something/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). The change in surroundings had been too fast, too unexpected. The sunlight disappearing was the first thing I truly registered. There were walls around us now, plain, white walls, and while we were still standing on a staircase, it was a different one. Solid. Gray and white. Nettie's fingers had tightened around my wrist like a vice, unintentionally sending pain shooting up my lower arm. "What the fuck?" she breathed, terror having seeped into her tone. "What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck…"

*This couldn't be happening. Not with her.*

"I—I'm sorry," I pressed out, choking on the lump in my throat. "It's me, I keep doing this, I don't know how—"

"What are you talking about? Wh-where are we?" 

"I don't know."

"This has happened to you before? Why haven't you told me?"

"Yes! Yes. Twice. I never did it on purpose! I have no idea where I end up or why," I stammered, palming my forehead and wiping off the cold sweat that had formed upon it. "I didn't want to drag you into it."

"Okay." I could hear the restraint in her voice when Nettie placed her hands on both my shoulders, gaze locking with mine. "It'll be okay." 

"I don't know how to get us back!"

"We'll figure it out. You've made it every time so far. Think about it. You and I, we have a one hundred percent track record of making it out of bad situations, don't we?" Her eyes were misty and her brows trembled, but her smile was unwavering.

"Technically, yes," I admitted.

"Good. Then let's go."

"Where?"

"Well, here's where you get to choose, Evangeline. Up the stairs or down?"

I tipped my head back. Something about going up appeared to me to be a more positive, hopeful prospect. Nettie linked arms with me, like she'd often used to back when I'd just arrived here, and thus, we began our ascent. We kept climbing and climbing, but no matter how many steps we brought behind us, new ones seemed to steadily pop up in front. We could never so much as see the topmost end of the staircase, it simply went on and on and on. The dim, flickering light that illuminated our path never changed, even though we couldn't spot its source. Neither did the darkness below. After a while, my best friend came to a halt, turned to face me and said, "I think we aren't going anywhere."

It did, indeed, seem that way. 

"This place is giving me the creeps," she continued. "Aside from the obvious, that is, how we ended up here in the first place. I just think we shouldn't be here, it feels very wrong. Ever heard of liminal spaces? That's what this is like, if you ask me." She shuddered, making a small *whff*-sound. "Should we try going down instead? It doesn't look all that inviting, but it might be worth a shot."

I agreed and we started descending. It was difficult to tell when or if we passed the point on which we'd first appeared—everything looked the same. The light was much lower, though, and the darkness certainly didn't bode well. 

"So, the other times," my savior human began conversationally, "where were you? And what happened to lead up to it? Perhaps there's a pattern."

"I was wedged in a tube slide playing hide-and-seek with your cousin," I recalled. "And before I knew it, I'd suddenly been transported to a beach of sorts. Then it was over and I dropped back out of the slide. That was the first time. The second time… I was swimming. At the pool."

"You learned to swim?"

"I attempted to. Anyways, I was trapped in an enormous scape made entirely of pool halls, and I had to fight a jellyfish monster before I made it back."

"All by yourself? Oh, baby, you must have been so scared."

My lips twitched. Omitting is not the same as lying, is it? "I was alright," I said. "By the way, what did Kit and you do after I left yesterday?"

"What? Nothing! I mean—yes."

"Nettie?"

"Yes! I'm sorry, I, uh, I thought I'd misheard you. Kit and I, we just talked mostly. Then we had some wine, watched TV, then I went home… nothing special. Quiet evening, but I needed it. Sometimes you… you need those. That reminds me, where did you spend the night? I feel horrible for borderline chasing you out."

This time, I really would have to lie. I'm afraid I'm not particularly good at that. "At home of course. I came back late. You must have been gone already, you didn't see me."

Nettie was suddenly looking at me very strangely. Suspiciously, almost. "Must have," she muttered. 

I merely shrugged. Then it hit me; why would she ask me in the first place? And what reason would she have not to believe me if she'd returned to her house? Even if she hadn't, I couldn't see the reason for her not admitting she stayed over. I would have had no problem with it; after all, I used to sleep in her first bedroom for several years. I was about to ask her about it, but she beat me to breaking the silence. 

"We've been going down for quite a while now," she remarked. "Look around; still nothing. This is concerning."

"I know." Staring down at the ever-darkening space below us made my pulse speed up. For a split second, I thought I could spot something *shifting* there, like a blacker shadow switching positions. I squinted at it, but whatever I thought I'd seen appeared not to be there anymore. Nettie pulled me a little closer to her side as we continued our descent, and I thought I could hear her swallow dryly. 

We proceeded, step by step, into the unknown. Soon enough, we couldn't see anything at all anymore. My best friend was growing increasingly anxious and I couldn't blame her—not with the only sound being the steady tapping of our soles against the stairs and the black veil swallowing all the light. Until another noise reached our ears, one that immediately caused us to stop in our tracks. 

Breathing.

Low, ragged, laborious, coming from somewhere up ahead. Or further down, rather. 

Nettie stifled a whimper deep in her throat. My jaws parted almost upon instinct and I felt my teeth elongating, sharpening, gliding outward past my open lips to rest against my chin. I was grateful for the darkness, then—this new physical development of mine was not one I wanted my best friend to witness yet. The fangs were sure to strike her as distinctly more monstrous than the tentacles she was familiar with. 

The breathing continued, growing louder even though we weren't moving towards it. In fact, we'd been standing still as statues, rooted to the spot. When Nettie took a step backwards, climbing up the stair right behind us, she dragged me along with her. Not once did we look back, not once did we turn our backs at the obscure source of the sound. Once again, I almost considered the lack of light to be fortunate. Perhaps it was better for us not to see what was waiting there beneath us. Perhaps it would spare Nettie Peterson some sleepless nights after all this was over.

Step by tentative step, we walked backwards up the staircase, right back the way we'd come from. Neither of us dared to actually look into the direction we were going. We were too fixated on that heavy, nerve-wrecking breathing, and there was a silent understanding between us that we would only turn around once we were wholly in the light again. I silently prayed my mouth would go back to normal before then. The sound faded into the distance, growing lower as we walked. Nettie's breathing slowed, and I felt her grip on my arm relax ever so slightly. 

"Good, okay," she uttered, more to herself than me.

"Are you alright?" I asked softly, stopping for a moment. 

"I'm—"

She was interrupted by a sharp, rattling intake of breath ringing out from right behind us, directly beside our ears. 

Nettie let out a blood-curdling scream that echoed throughout the staircase. I whirled around, not thinking, and sent us both stumbling. Our surroundings shrouded in darkness, we could see nothing as we fell. It was a plunge into nothingness, into a maw-like depth. I instinctively tried to pull my savior human on top of me so as to cushion her impact, but there was only a split second before the world turned bright. 

The tumble we'd braced ourselves for came. I held onto Nettie for dear life as we rolled down the flight of stairs, only I could tell it wasn't the same one we'd ascended moments prior. The iron steps dug into our skin, leaving grated marks and scrapes. My ears were ringing with the metal clanging that accompanied our fall. When we'd finally reached the bottom, I looked up to see my suspicion confirmed. We were back by the fire escape behind the warehouse. I clasped my hand over my mouth—the fangs had retracted. Good. There was a throbbing ache in my head but I didn't have time to consider the daze I was in. Nettie Peterson had already pulled me to my feet and was dragging me along by the arm, back into the direction of the street.

"That freak's seen us, remember?" she hissed through the hand that was covering her face. My stomach jolted when I spotted the blood dripping down from between her fingers. I tried to fall into step beside her, but she was admittedly a little hard to keep up with. She threw a glance over her shoulder, her eyes hard. I didn't dare look back, fully trusting myself to my savior human's guidance as she steered us further away. 

"Are they following?" I gasped.

"They're not," she grunted, but she did end up pulling me into a small side street. Letting go of my wrist, she fumbled a handkerchief out of her pocket and pressed it to her bleeding nose. 

I winced at the sight. "It's not broken, is it?"

"No. That'd hurt more. I'm fine. What about you?"

I rolled my head and flexed my arms experimentally. "I think I'm alright."

"You sure?" She raised her hand to gently wipe at a scratch on my face. "The second you start to feel off, please let me know. You gotta be careful with tumbles like that; you could be concussed and not even… well. Just let me know." She smiled. 

"I will. I'm sorry, this… this is all my fault. I shouldn't have gone back there," I mumbled. "And the changing places-thing—"

"Baby girl," Nettie interrupted me, pocketing the stained tissue. "If I ever think anything's your fault, there'll be no uncertainty about it. We're both alive and safe. We'll go home now, we'll clean ourselves up, have a nice cold drink and *then* we can try and sort this out."

"Didn't you have plans for today or something?"

"Not anymore, I don't. Come on."

We went back to her house where we took turns in the bathroom. She then gave me a top and sweatpants of hers to wear and we ended up sitting down in the garden to talk. It was still as neatly chaotic as I remembered—dozens of wildly different flowers, trees and shrubs somehow coexisting in perfect harmony. Like mismatched neighbors who'd become unlikely friends. It was nice to unwind together, in comfortable clothes that weren't drenched in sweat and stained with blood. Soaking in the sunlight, Nettie tipped her head back and closed her eyes. "Summer's finally coming around. Can't believe it, but here we are. If you think the plants look good now, just wait a couple weeks."

"I know how lovely it gets around here," I told her. "Haven't forgotten."

"What else haven't you forgotten?" she leaned forward, a playful smirk on her lips. "How you threw up all over the kitchen table when I let you try coffee for the first time?"

"Ah."

She snickered. "Or how you were always chewing on everything?"

"I was teething! I wasn't used to having human teeth!"

"Christ Almighty, but you bit through my telephone cord like a bunny!"

"I'm sorry! Like I said five years ago."

Nettie Peterson let out a bright laugh. "Oh, it was about time I got rid of the old landline anyways. I wasn't even using it anymore. I only kept it around for nostalgic reasons."

"I never troubled you, did I? I mean, I know I did, but—"

"Never more than I could handle," she interrupted me. "Besides, I enjoyed your company then as much as ever. Despite the little mishaps here and there."

"And what about you?"

"What about me?"

"How have you been? Lately? Or always. In general."

My best friend raised a brow at me. "Is that an open invitation to talk about myself?"

"That invitation's been standing for five years, you just don't make use of it very much," I answered. "I don't even know if you're aware of it sometimes."

"I am, honey. Always have been. But I don't want to—"

"Muddle my human experience by unburdening your sorrows unto me? I think we've gone over this. And it doesn't have to be just when you're not feeling well. I'd be happy hearing more of the mundane stuff, too."

"Okay, well… you know most of the things that've been going on. Honestly though, it's the little things that get me down sometimes. I went out of town to see my aunt two weeks ago… you know, Eli's mom. And she just made this comment that kind of stuck with me, about how she envies me working with kids because it's such an easy job." She let go of a sharp breath, rolling her shoulders. "Of course I didn't say anything *to her* but *goddamn,* that got my teeth grinding. Sorry. When did I start cursing so often?"

"I don't fucking care."

Nettie Peterson burst out laughing. "Love that straight face!" she sputtered. "I love you, I love you so damn much, you strange little girl!"

I hadn't been before, but that got me smiling. "Well, I love you, too. You know that. I've seen what you do first-hand, and I never once thought it was easy."

"The thing is, children aren't the most appreciative creatures in the world. My coworkers are always stressed out as well; makes it difficult to get on with them sometimes. It simply hurts getting remarks like that. I guess that's been eating at me for a while. Might be why I sorta broke down yesterday. Maybe I just have thin skin." She let out a soft sigh. 

"Even if you do, I understand."

"Of course. Eva, I don't know why I thought you wouldn't." She drew herself up, draping her arm over the backrest of her seat. "This was my mother's spot. She always used to sit here. The very same chair, too."

I hummed pensively. "I never met your parents."

"Uh… you do know what it means that I *inherited* this house, right?" 

I pulled a face. "Right! I do. I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking."

"It's cool. It's been such a long time. Anyways, we should talk about what happened earlier, shouldn't we."

"I already told you everything there's to—"

"Not *we* as in *the two of us.* We as in us and the others. Eli and Kit were there, too, that one time. They could have something to say that'll help us." She reached out to squeeze my shoulder. "Let's all meet up at the diner soon and discuss things. We'll figure this out."
