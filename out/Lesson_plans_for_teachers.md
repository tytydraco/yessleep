There was a girl lost in a thickly growing forest. 
Lake water surrounding a plane was in view, and she was scared of what might be approaching her. Footsteps led from the pilot’s seat to about halfway to her, then pivoted off into the right. 
Nervous, she walked backwards with her sight on the plane, the footsteps, then to the right where they led into the same trees she saw all around her. A cat’s yowl had made her jump, and she then realized if there was a cat, houses and people were nearby! Relieved, she quietly made her way toward the sound, and found nothing but more trees.
 Curious as to what might’ve made the noise, she looked around a little, and realized it was not a housecat, but one that lived on its own. She couldn’t decide if the footprints or the yowl seemed more dangerous, but sat down to rest. Her heart was beating as if she had run four marathons, and her shoulders and chin shrunk into herself as she thought about her situation. 

She thought about the words said before she pressed buttons and jerked the steering stick that crashed the plane. It was exhilarating and the most powerful thing she had ever done, although when she thought about it more, seemed a bit sad. 
When she was eating a bag of chips on the ride, her teacher was explaining about the way planes were able to stay in the air. “The plane was created from an idea a pair of brothers had, from a dream maybe...”, he mused. “I wish I were there to ask how they thought to even try it back then, but if not, we wouldn’t even have cars today, would we?” After some time, he said “Lana, you're going to grow up to be so beautiful. As beautiful as this plane can fly, and the colors of the forest.” 
She heard the strange, yet nice words and thanked him. “I’m flying our way into a place where we can be happy forever. Don’t tell anyone when we land, alright? People can’t know how much I love you.”, and laughed as he then gave her another bag of onion chips.
He also explained he was looking for someone to marry, but was looking for someone who didn’t have a family, because he could never make a woman truly happy and that would upset them. But he would like to try to make his own family instead.
 Lana stopped eating and started to feel weird about what he said, and how he said those words.
 She started to eat again. It was hard to chew and enjoy the chips, as he was looking at her occasionally, but with a look as if he knew something she didn’t. 
“Why are you telling me about this? This doesn’t sound like a lesson in planes, but yourself.”, She was worried he wouldn’t turn the plane and actually land somewhere else.

“As well as I'm flying our plane, our new life will be as wondrous. I can’t wait to see how we will grow.” 
NO, she thought, and started yelling at him to go back to the field and screamed she was not curious about planes anymore. “I have a family! They’re going to miss me and you're going to turn around and go back NOW!”, and took hold of the stick. 
His eyes grew huge and he tried to push her back to the seat, but she then pressed all the buttons she could, which made him push buttons too. 
She then jerked the stick, causing the plane to tilt and dive toward the green forest below. 
Being stuck is nothing new, she thought. But this is definitely different from other situations.
