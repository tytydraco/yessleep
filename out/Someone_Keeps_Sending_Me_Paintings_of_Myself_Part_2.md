If you have any suggestions on how to proceed,  please let me know. The packages keep showing up and the paintings inside are getting more invasive.

When I woke up this morning, James and I tried to figure out what we should do.

"I mean, we could tell the police." He suggested.

"And tell them what exactly?" I snapped. There were a lot of thoughts and emotions swirling around my head, so I was pretty irritable.

"I don't know. That someone is stalking you?"

"It's so much stranger than that, though. Both times I've got the paintings before the events they depict have happened. It's, like, supernatural."

"Okay? So we tell the ghostbusters instead." His response to stress was almost always humor.

"This is serious, James! Someone or something is watching me. And we don't have either of the paintings anymore so we've got no evidence even if we were to go to the police."

"Alright, alright. Well, the first one was left at the door, so why don't we get you a Ring? Then, if they try to leave another one, we can see who or what it is."

A very simple solution. A doorbell camera. But I had no better ideas, so off we went to Best Buy. Neither one of us is particularly techie, so it took us a while to figure out how to connect it to my phone and laptop, but by noon we had everything set up and ready to go.

James went out front and made a scene, flapping his arms and running in circles on my front porch. Sure enough, a little chime emanated from my phone to alert me that there was motion on the camera. I was satisfied for the time being.

He came back inside, but froze before entering the kitchen.

"What?" I asked. He just pointed behind me. Sitting on my back porch was a box. I leapt up and ran to James, both of us staring at the parcel on the other side of my sliding glass door.

"That wasn't there when I went outside." He mumbled.

My skin crawled. I had been only a few feet away from whatever was taunting me with these strange paintings. We slowly approached the door, scanning my backyard to see if the deliverer was still out there. Empty. James slid open the door and grabbed the box, quickly closing and locking the door behind him.

He slid the newest painting out of its cardboard confines. Same style, but this time it was unmistakably me. However, it was heavily distorted, like someone had taken a close up picture of my face with a fish eye lens.

"Freaky." Was all James could manage.

We sat at the kitchen table, just staring at the painting. Then I had a strange idea. I thought it could maybe give us some insight into these bizarre works of art. Jame's sister worked at the local art museum. I remembered her telling us about someone trying to sell the museum a piece that turned out to be a fake. They found this out by running tests on some of the flakes of the paint used in the composition.

I called Becca and asked if she could test some paint for us. I left out all the details of the situation to avoid looking crazy and she agreed. After returning to Best Buy to get a Ring for the back door, we dropped off the paint sample I had scraped off of the most recent *gift.*

"Alright, it'll take a few hours for the results. I'll give you a call when they're done." Becca said with a smile.

James and I returned home and set up the other camera on my back porch. Then we started watching a movie in my room to take our minds off all this strange shit. James was half asleep and I was scouring the internet to see if I could find anything that could help explain what was going on. At around seven my phone rang.

"Hey, Hannah. Where did you say you got this painting again?" Becca asked.

"A garage sale." I lied.

"Well you should probably bring it into the museum. It could be worth a fortune."

"Uhh. Why?"

"That paint is old. Like ancient. Same kind of stuff the Etruscans used on their sarcophagi. But it might be even older than that! Part of the compound is actually human blood, which was a practice from before there were written languages. You really have to send me a picture of this paining! I can't believe someone just had that sitting in a garage collecting dust." She laughed.

"Haha yeah I will. Thanks for your help." I hung up. James was staring at me waiting to hear what I'd learned. Then my phone chimed. Something was on one of my porches.

James opened my laptop and brought up the feed. Another box lay propped against my front door. Nothing else in sight.

"Hang on, let me pull up the recording." He said. After a few seconds, the timeline of the camera's history popped up on screen. We both stared in silence, his jaw agape and mine clenched shut. The very first frame that the Ring had captured was my face after I mounted it on the wall. My face, distorted and bent. My face, that was painted on the canvas sitting on my kitchen table.

It felt like we stared for an eternity, then I remembered what we were doing.

"Skip ahead."

James snapped back to his senses and dragged the cursor to the timestamp of when the ring alarm went off. One second, there was an empty porch, then the screen shimmered like there had been some sort of interference, and then the package was there. Like it had appeared out of thin air.

"Maybe we just shouldn't open it." James whispered. Most of me agreed with him. But part of me didn't.

"I feel like the only way we are going to learn more about whatever the fuck is going on is by putting the pieces of this twisted puzzle together. And there is a piece sitting on the porch."

James just sighed in response. We got up and went down stairs. James grabbed the baseball bat I keep near the front door. I doubted we would need it, but it seemed to make him feel a little better. I opened the door and the package flopped onto the floor with a slight thud. I grabbed it and brought it back into the kitchen. The other painting was gone. James started to freak out.

"What the fuck, Hannah. We have to get out of here. Just come stay at my place for Christ's sake. Someone was in here and took the painting. They might STILL be here." He said, his eyes darting around the room.

"Okay. Okay. We can go. Let's just look first." I said as I slid the box open.

Same composition as always. Messy border, hauntingly realistic center. The scene was dark, with only two light sources adding color to the painting.

The first was a television on the left and the other was a laptop on the right. The laptop illuminated my face as I sat in bed, James next to me half asleep.

Horizontal bars ran the length of the painting from top to bottom. I knew, both by the orientation of the bed and television and the thickness of the horizontal lines, that the perspective of the painting was as if the painter had been sitting inside my closet.

I'm at James' now, typing this up and desperately trying to think of what to do. I might just have to move out of my house. Hell, I might have to leave town. But even if I do, part of me expects that the paintings and *the painter* will have no trouble tracking me down.
