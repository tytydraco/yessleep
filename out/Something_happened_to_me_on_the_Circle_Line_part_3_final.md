“I’m so sorry, you startled me.” Is what I started to say, but my voice died in my throat when the light fell on them. They were only lit up for a few seconds before we both moved away, them rushing off into the darkness, me jumping back, trying to hold onto my phone, but their face… what I saw of their face… I only saw it for a second, and I was panicking, so I don’t know if I saw it right, or if I’m remembering it correctly, but their face looked… *dead*. At least, that’s the reaction I had at the time, and the only way I can think to describe it. I’ve never seen a real dead person, but the face looked like how I imagine one, stiff and motionless with ashen skin and glassy, sunken eyes 

My hands are shaky and sweaty but I do my best to cling on to my phone as I run. I don’t even know how much running is going to help; the train is big, but it’s not *that* big, and there’s nowhere really to hide and it doesn’t seem like it’s going to be stopping anytime soon. But what else was I going to do after seeing that face?

I run until I reach the front of the train. I fall into the corner and slide down the wall, crumpling into a ball. 

Somehow, the most prominent thought in my mind as I sit there is that I won’t see Jess, and she’s probably going to think I’m a thoughtless asshole and a bad friend and I don’t care about her. I don’t know why that thought was so clear and all-consuming at that moment. I just know that I felt this deep sense of isolation, from Jess and from everyone. 

I open up my message app and write something to Jess, or try to, it’s probably  indecipherable through the nervous typos- *I’m sorry, Jess, I don’t think I’m going to make it* 

The text doesn’t go through, of course. I’m on a racing train, underground. But even though I know it’s pointless, I send another text- *I’m lost. I got on the wrong train and I don’t know where I’m going or when it’s going to stop.*

*I don’t know IF it’s going to stop.* 

*I’m sorry.* 

*I was really really looking forward to seeing you again. I missed you and I was so excited to see you today but I don’t think I’m going to be able to and I’m sorry.* 

Little red Xs pop up alongside every single text as I send it.

I scroll up past my failed messages to find the last message she sent “Okay! See you then :\]” she always does her smiley faces with a little square bracket like that. 

Scrolling up a little further, I see the last time we exchanged messages before that, from about two weeks ago, me sending her some art I thought she’d like, and her sending me some silly memes in return. Above that, a month ago, an exchange I’d forgotten, me mentioning offhand that I’d had kind of a shitty day, and her responding with a message of support, telling me she was there for me. 

Nothing earlier loads, but something about the messages I can see is… well, I suppose it’s comforting, the reminders that we care, even though it’s been a long time. I scroll up and down through all the messages I can see, reading them over and over and over. Eventually, I stop crying, and I’m able to breathe normally again. Maybe it was my imagination, but it felt like the train was slowing down along with my breath. I closed my eyes and took deep breaths, trying to calm myself down, holding my phone against my chest. The warmth of it was comforting. 

And when I opened my eyes again, the lights flickered back on. 

The train was still empty, but at least there was light again, and it seemed to be moving along at a more manageable pace. 

After a little while, it got to St. Pancras. I got off, shaken and uncertain, but glad to be safely at the station. Jess was waiting for me at one of the cafes. I was so, so happy to see her. I didn’t tell her about what happened. Half because I thought it would be weird and I just wanted to catch up and talk to her about normal things. Half because I wasn’t sure it really happened. 

I’m still not sure it really happened. 

If anyone’s experienced anything remotely like this, please tell me. I need to know I’m not alone.
