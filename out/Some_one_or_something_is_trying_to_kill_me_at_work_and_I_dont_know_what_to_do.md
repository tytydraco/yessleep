I don't post to reddit. I normally don't post to  social media for that matter. I have a problem though and don't know what to do.

 I am a 22 year old male who has worked the same job for six years. I started part-time at a butcher shop after school hours. I now work full time as one of the few full time employees. Looking back, there have been many red flags, but none quite like yesterday.

  For a little context about the place, it is a small family owned shop out in the countryside.  It's about a 30 minute drive for me to get there in the mornings, and over an hour to the nearest Walmart. 

Anyway,  over the years I've noticed small things. Doors lock when no one is around, I get locked in freezers by accident,  and things move when I'm by myself. Worse things have happened though, a saw once started itself,  and a quarter of a cow fell one me. Both were  considered accidents, neither time I got hurt. A while back I was laughing and joking with coworkers,  I brought up an old coworker's name only to be met with confusion. They claimed they hadn't worked with said guy. All this pails in comparison to what happened yesterday.


 I was working alone, cleaning up the processing room. (The processing room is where we have the grinder, saw, cutting boards, and stuffer) Everyone,  including my boss had left the building. This was strange for many reasons,  but at the very least I wasn't normally expected to clean by myself. 

As I was cleaning the cutting board I glanced out the window. I could see a tree that wasn't there before just on the edge of the fog. It seemed like a tall stump with only two branches at the top of it. How odd. Suddenly a knive dropped from it's rack and landed beside my hand, just cutting the edge of my finger. I grasped my hand and made my way to the break room. The wound wasn't bad but I didn't want to finish washing up with an open wound. As I finished cleaning and wrapping my wound I heard the door bell ring.

When I checked our store front there wasn't a soul to be seen. (Later I realized maybe it didn't have one) The door bell is a motion sensor that is placed at the front door. Then it hit me. It's five forty. We closed ten minutes ago. The door is locked. 
"That's odd" I breath to myself. 

I could hear movement in the back. My boss would often pop back in to see if things were going alright. 
"James, is that...... you?" I ask the void. 
No response. I check my work to find things were  moved,  but no culprit. I check the parking lot. No cars besides mine. The tree stump thing was missing again. 

I rushed to get things finished,  but was interrupted by the door bell again. Again,  nothing. Back to work. Again, the door bell, this time with knocking.  Again,  nothing. From that point forward I decided to ignore the door so I could finish my work quickly,  then fix the door.


When I was done, I walked back to the front only to find hoof prints leading away from the door. I tracked them back to my station in the processing room.
I didn't know what to think. How did an animal get through a locked door? Maybe just a prank? The worst was yet to be. 

In the break room,  written in blood was a message. "DEAD IN TWO WEEKS" I don't know what that was referring to, whether it was for me or someone else, I didn't care. I was out of that shop as soon as I could. I forgot to clock out, and lock the employee exit. I didn't know who left that, but after being alone for hours, and after the other strange things, I'm not risking it. 


As a speed down the road I noticed eight monoliths, the tops not visible through the fog. They where surrounding the road. Not blocking me, but they definitely weren't there before or this even this morning. 

What do I do? Should I tell my boss? Should I contact the police? Please, if you have any ideas or experience with this sort of thing, please help me.
