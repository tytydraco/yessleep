Ever feel familiar when you enter a random room when exploring a per se hotel, house, office building, etc, well that's what i felt when i found the hidden room under our new house. Hi I'm Andrei (16m) and i have 2 siblings(I'm the eldest), i live in an East Asian country where the food is exotic and the parents have the qualities of a pushy and judgy Asian and an aggressive and alcoholic Spaniard. 

My new house that my mother bought was a 10min drive from our old home so it was no problem going there for a fiesta celebration every year, but the reason we bought a new one(house) was because of the storm that hit East Asia back in 2016 which blew a hole in our roof, flooded the living room and damaged the front windshield of our car, and my mom realized that our old house won't hold another storm surge so she already planned in buying a new house, she said i has a second floor, 2 bathrooms and 3 bedrooms, the next day and that's where we settled.

Both of my parents kept expanding and renovating parts of the house to make it feel exotic and nice to our guest's eyes, they added another kitchen, a place for our dogs to place, a laundry area, another sink 

On my 15th birthday I had dream of the hooded man living under our house, sometimes i would envision it at random times, and my parents got concerned so did my teachers and classmates that they would see me blackout at random times to the point that they would suspend me for a week and get me mental and psychological help but it didn't work and I'd still kept on dreaming and visioning the hooded man so they all got tired and just let it happen.

This went on for weeks if not months, and within those several months, i've been getting texts from my classmates about a new YouTuber blowing up since January, when i looked him up all his content was about art and gaming, just like any other popular animator/gamer.

When i saw his character it was exactly the same character that i have been dreaming to create someday after I'm done from college and start my own YouTube career, it had an angel on the left shoulder a demon on the right and a symbiote companion covering the right side of his face, but i guess he got to that idea first.

In his streaming all he wore was a red and black hoodie and an oni mask and he was playing Warzone 2 and he was playing it like a pro, getting dubs left and right, making trick shots in many ways no other player can do, there was one trick shot that he did where he'd 360 no scope someone from a heli 150m away. 

Within those months of watching him my blackouts got less frequent and my dreams of the hooded man got less frequent, he would wear a different hoodie and mask within every stream that he makes every 3 days a week and he would make animations every 4 days, but within the middle of June i got a new vision and dream, it would be me waking up in tube and then a secret passage way along with a 6 digit string of numbers being 012807, and this time it would happen every weekend and sometimes 3 times a week.

On October 28 2024, the dream that i had got so vivid that i thought it was real, it showed the front yard of our house, sometimes it would be the dining area(which is close to our living room), and just around it would be the hooded man punching in a code(012807) and a trapdoor would open and before he could enter it he would look back and give a little smile like he knew i was watching him, and i would wake up sweating and be on a different part of the house, it would be on the couch, the table, the laundry area, or even in the kitchen, guess i gotta investigate this on my own since my parents and the others won't even believe me, I'll have to wait till their asleep.
