  “This is officer Baxter reporting to sgt Hans, I’m on site sir I’ll tell you if I find anything” I say into my radio

“10-4 Bax, I doubt you’ll find anything this Clint guy just seems insane but as usually keep me posted”

“Yes sir heading inside now”

Stepping out of my 2012 black Tahoe I adjust my gun belt and walk inside 

Stepping over the white outlines on the floor I search the house up and down but come up empty handed

“Sir from the looks of it, it seems the same as that night, no signs of any animal inside the premises”

“Just keep looking you know how these suits are Bax, if we miss anything and they find it we’ll never hear the end of it”

“10-4, gonna search the outside” 

Stepping back outside I search around the house and hear what sounds like a raccoon in the trash can

“Sir I hear something in the trash can gonna open it probably just a raccoon”

“Alright Bax keep me posted”

Slowly approaching the lid I see a stick on the ground, picking it up I use it to safety lift the garbage lid to see a fluffy white bunny leap out

“Umm sir?, it’s a bunny”

“A bunny? In the trash?… alright I guess call animal control and then you can head home”

“Animal control will take forever and most likely just put it down sir, permission to keep it?, Sarah would love it”

“Yea go ahead Bax you know I can’t say no to my granddaughter”

“I’ll make sure to tell her you helped Hans” I say laughing to myself 

Picking the bunny up I’m surprised by its calm nature and wonder if it’s been domesticated before

After about in hour of buying the basic necessities for a bunny (according to google) I head home just in time to see Sarah getting off her bus

“Daddy!” Her little voice yells as she runs towards me 

“Hey Sarah, I got a surprise” I tell her as she clings to be 

“Is it a cat” she says practically jumping with excitement 

I reach into my car and grab the bunny, “close” I say revealing the Bunny as Sarah screams in excitement practically snatching it from me like it’s a stuffed animal

“Be careful okay?, bunny’s are fragile”

“Okay dad ima give him a tour of the house”
I hear her say as she goes around describing each part of the yard and house to the Bunny like it understands

Grabbing the rest of the bunny supplies I head inside and set a spot up in the kitchen for the bunny to eat and a spot for her to lay in Sarah’s room 

On Saturday the bunny and Sarah were almost inseparable all day they spent the day together watching cartoons or brushing it’s hair to be honest I didn’t know a bunny would be so entertaining to her it just kinda sits there but she’s happy so I’m happy, nothing strange ever happened besides a weird incident last night where Sarah insisted on sleeping with me because the bunny was as Sarah put it 

“Staring dad it just keeps staring at me while I sleep”

“It’s okay it’s probably just as confused as you are trying to figure out what you’re doing” I said reassuringly 

“Okay” she said softly as she drifted into sleep instantly the way only a child could

In the morning her grandpa and grandma came over for a cookout, we ate and laughed telling Hans about the things Sarah and the bunny have been doing while his wife Mrs.Hans watched Sarah

I grabbed us a beer as we sat and talked about dumb things like the fact the Easter bunny lays eggs and a little about ongoing cases and the trial of Clint who had recently been pronounced guilty and sentenced to 20-life.

About 2 hours later we hear a crash in the house, shifting are heads towards the door we jump out of our chairs and rush inside to see the bunny chewing through the side of Mrs.Hans neck as she screams, grabbing
the bunny I tried to pull it off which makes it digs it’s teeth in deeper causing Hans to yell in anger as he grabs his gun putting it directly on the bunny to prevent it from hitting his wife and fires the gun

Holding our ears from the deafening echo Hans rushes forward to put pressure on his wife’s neck, I rush to look for the bunny to see it laying on the ground 10ft away

“Call an ambulance” Hans screams as I rush to the phone dialing 911 and tell them about what occurred 

Setting the phone down I yell to Hans “they’re 10 minutes out, she’s going to be okay”

“Okay okay get Sarah out of here she doesn’t need to see this” Hans says as I realize Sarah’s been crying by the door this whole time

“Sarah baby go to your room it’s gonna be okay” I say most likely sounding more fearful then reassuring 

She starts to walk towards her room when I walk to Hans 
“How does this happen, I mean the bunny never showed any hostility then randomly decides to dig in to someones throat? It just doesn’t make sense” I say 

“I… I don’t know, out of all my years on the force I’ve never seen a rabid bunny before” Hans says tears in his eyes as he keeps pressure on his wife’s neck

Looking over at the wife It hits me
“Hey Hans, did you ever see the bunny ble” 

Just then we hear a blood curdling scream come from my daughter room, rushing over I jump over Mr and Mrs Hans and kick the door open only to see a red covered bunny tearing it’s way through Sarah’s stomach

I grab the bunny slamming it into the wall and shooting it 5,6,7 more times not even noticing the ringing in my ears this time , rushing to Sarah I cry as I hold her lifeless body in my hands

Then the room starts to fill with a dense smoke

Looking at the bunny I hear bones cracking as it seems to shake and vibrate becoming a bigger and bigger mass growing longer now orangish fur as it begins to resemble an injured bobcat or lynx or something then leaps passed me breaking threw the window and running off as I try to shoot it only to hear my gun click over and over

About 2-3 minutes later the ambulance arrives but wasn’t able to save either victims 

This although I didn’t know it at the time became the second of many “animal” attacks in our town, but I know it wasn’t an animal so I’m putting up flyers with my story all over town and online so hopefully people will listen and stop trusting the news when it says some stupid shit like a bear attack

Hans drunk himself to death about a week later given the fact he already had a bad liver from previous alcoholism 10 years ago

And I well I just buried all 3 of them yesterday, please anybody near Groveland if you’re reading this ignore the strays.
