It was a basic ring, nothing special, made of dull metal. No diamonds, no inscriptions – just a few flecks of rust splattered around the band. It was made to be worn on a thin finger, a bony finger, a withering hand. I knew that the ring wouldn’t fit me, that it would sit at the bottom of a box under my bed – but I still had to take it. 

I wanted to go to sleep that night knowing that I had that ring, that it belonged to me now. I wanted to take it out over the coming years and watch as the rust spread until the ring was a dark bronze, until it was sharp to touch. I wanted to have that ring when the woman it belonged to was long gone, when her body melted into the ground.

When I was 11, my dad left my mom. He left whilst I was at school, and whilst she was at work. So whilst mum was teaching children the difference between nouns and verbs, and whilst I was struggling to get to grips with algebra, dad cleared the house. 

He’d always had a ‘my money’ attitude. He was a high earner, brought home big dollars, so everything belonged to him. So I think he probably thought it was his right to take everything with him when he left. And I really do mean everything. I mean three moving vans worth of everything. 

The television, all mom’s favourite pots and pans, all of the photo albums – even ones he’d have no reason to want, like photos of my mum’s dead grandma. Furniture, sofas and armchairs and dining tables (and the dining table itself). He took it all, left us with nothing but polished floors, and locked the door behind him.

I can remember mom’s face when we first stepped into the house, when she first realised how empty dad had left her. I can remember how she dropped to her knees, like the overly dramatic star of some soap opera – and I can remember her burying her head into my shoulder.

And through the rage, I can remember wondering how dad must have felt. How powerful. With a van packed full of everything that made us a family, driving towards a new life. Don’t get me wrong – I hated him. But I knew that he must have felt like a king, like nothing in this world could stop him.

\*

We went to stay with my nan, and I waited a week until I took the first item of my collection. It was a pen from my teacher’s desk, nothing special, plastic ballpoint. I stored it in a shoebox under my bed, next to a stack of grandad’s old comic books. 

I still have that shoebox now, and I still have that pen. It’s Item 1 of my collection of 619. It now shares its shoebox with Item 23 (the right arm of a wrestling figure that used to belong to my cousin, Joe) and Item 186 (a teen magazine that I stole from the waiting room of a dentist’s). 

My whole collection is under my bed, in shoe boxes and plastic takeout containers and suitcases. And the ring was going to be my 620th item – my new prized possession, for a day at least.

\*

The truth is that the ring belonged to my mum. When dad cleared out the house, he took everything – but he couldn’t take away the jewellery that my mum was wearing. He couldn’t take her bracelet, or her earrings. He couldn’t take her wedding ring, and he couldn’t take Item 620 either.

It had been a gift from her dad, something he’d brought back home with him from the war in Vietnam. And he’d never told her where he got it from, only that it belonged to mum now. And that she must always wear it, must never take it off, must treasure it forever. As a child, she’d worn it on her finger. As an adult, she’d worn it on a chain around her neck. When she’d started her treatment, it had returned to her finger again.

I remember that first night, after dad had cleared the house, before we went to nan’s, sat on some airbeds in the living room. Mom had taken the ring off of her necklace, was showing it to me. It was still a dulled grey back then, but it hadn’t started to rust yet. She even let me hold it.

‘Grandad said I had to keep this ring,’ mom said, ‘because it was a part of him.’

‘Grandad’s always saying weird stuff,’ I told her. The ring fit on my index finger back then. I can remember it sliding all the way down, until it pressed against my knuckle.

‘I think he was telling the truth, Jamie,’ she said. Then she gripped her thumb and her index around the ring, pulled it gently off of my finger. It was dark in the living room. I couldn’t really see mum’s face, just her eyes. But those eyes were full of tears.

\*

I took the ring on mom’s last night. She was a thin wreck, a skeleton wrapped in a giant hospital gown, a balding head with grey hair that was soaked to her forehead, a tube sticking out of her nose. The sound of her breathing was hidden beneath the beating of her ECG machine.

It's important to say that I’m a bad person, but I’m also a good son. I took the ring while she was sleeping, took it off of her finger, just like she’d taken it off of mine when I was just a kid. And I tucked it into the pocket of my jeans. 

But then I held her hand. I sang hymns to her, told her stories about our life together, about my stepdad, Geoff. I kissed her cheek, told her how much I loved her. I thanked her for staying with me when dad left, for not giving up on me when I was kicked out of school, for staying by me when I went to prison. For the beautiful letters she wrote.

When she began to rattle, when the ECG flatlined, I stayed with her. I wouldn’t let her go. She was the one thing I couldn’t add to my collection, the one thing I couldn’t hold on to, the one thing I’d have to give up. But I held onto her until there was nothing left to claim, until I knew she was fully gone.

It took the touch of a young girl to free me from my mom. I assumed she was a nurse, but I only really saw her small hands. They were covered in dirt and dried blood, but for some reason, I didn’t find that strange. Those small hands were strong – they pried me from my mother’s grip. And then other nurses, other doctors, were in the room, and the young girl was running towards the door. I saw the back of her head, the knots of her hair, full of leaves and twigs, before she was gone.

On the drive home, I took the ring out of my pocket and rested it on my lap. I remembered what mom had told me. ‘Grandad said I had to keep this ring.’ I remembered the tears in her eyes. ‘Because it was a part of him,’ she had said. And as she’d slipped the ring onto her finger, I’d almost thought – for a moment – that I could see him. That tall old man, stood behind her, with his hand resting on her shoulder.

\*

That night, I put the ring into the shoebox next to Item 1, and then I added it to my inventory. It’s important to note (and I know I keep saying that, but there are so many important things to note in a ghost story like the one I’m telling you) that I couldn’t sleep that night. I laid awake in bed, above that shoebox, and I watched the ceiling. I don’t need to tell you what I thought about. 

But when the sun began to rise, painted my bedroom walls pink with light, I finally got out of bed, got onto my hands and knees, and reached for that shoebox. I pulled it out from under the bed, dropped it onto my desk and slowly pulled off the lid. I saw Item 1, and Item 186, and Item 329 (a doorknob), and Item 444 (a number 4 candle from a birthday cake) – but I couldn’t see Item 620.

So I tipped out the contents of the box, properly searched through it. I was starting to panic. But the ring was nowhere to be found. Perhaps I’d put it into the wrong shoebox – no, I searched through them all and found 12 other rings, but none of them were mom’s. Perhaps I’d left them in the pocket of my jeans – no, I just found my car keys.

The ring was gone, but I was determined to find it. I searched my bedroom thoroughly, checked my kitchen, checked under the sofas in my living room. I checked the car, then even drove up to the hospital. But the ring was nowhere to be found. The ring was gone.

And although I couldn’t quite say why, I was starting to feel a deep sense of dread. I guess it was because I knew I’d put that ring into the shoebox the night before, that I’d remembered the very moment I’d done it, the very moment I’d nestled it into its new home next to the ballpoint pen. And I’d spent the whole night lying above it, knowing it was beneath me.

I’d never lost an item from my collection before – but the most important item I’d ever taken was now missing. So where had it gone? Or who had taken it?

\*

I slept that night, after a busy day of searching. And after endless phone calls from mom’s friends, and an hour-long chat with Geoff’s daughter, Maria. And all of the calls that you have to make the day after your mom dies. And after a call with my ex-wife, who told me that my son would like to come to the funeral. I slept that night, but I didn’t sleep well.

I dreamt that I was hidden amongst tall grass, my heart racing a thousand miles an hour, my clothes stuck to my skin with sweat, the rest of my skin covered in a thin layer of dirt. I was waiting for something, or someone. In the distance, I could hear gunfire – I could hear men and women screaming.

I awoke to the sound of my bedroom door closing. My bedroom was pitch-black, curtains closed, couldn’t see a thing. But my window was open, so I thought it must have been a breeze. Only, the door hadn’t slammed, like a strong gust of wind had forced it shut.

It had creaked to a close. Gently.

I couldn’t go back to sleep, so I got out of bed and pulled the curtains open. Now a thin ray of moonlight illuminated my bedroom, and I could see my desk. I’d left the shoebox on the desk with the lid off. I could see Item 1, Item 186, Item 329, Item 444 – and I could also see Item 620. Sat next to the pen, just where I’d left it. That dull metal ring, half-hidden in shadow. Someone had put it there.

\*

Another day of going through the motions, of remembering mom’s dying rattle, the long screeching flatline as she left me – another day of talking to the priest at mom’s local church, of visiting the crematorium, of listening to Joe talk about nothing down the phone – of eating food that tasted good and shouldn’t have tasted good because mom hadn’t made it – of showering because I had to, because I had to keep living, to keep going through the motions, because mom couldn’t keep going through the motions – of getting angry when I saw an old woman walking past the house on the way to the store, because why was she allowed to be alive, why was her heart allowed to beat, when my mom’s heart was being stored in a mortuary?

I left the shoebox on my bedroom desk with the lid off. Every moment I could, between all of the busyness, I checked on Item 620. I thought about how dad must have felt, driving away with a van filled with everything that had ever mattered to mom, and I felt glad that he hadn’t been able to take this from her.

\*

That night, I returned the long grass. Heart pumping, sticky clothes, dirty skin, gunfire in the distance, men and women screaming – and I was holding a gun. An assault rifle. My hands were shaking, but my finger was pressed against the trigger. In the distance, I heard footsteps. Running. And then the running wasn’t distant. It was coming closer, closer, closer –

The door creaked shut, and I woke up to darkness again. I knew I was alone, knew my bedroom was empty, but I also knew that my ring would no longer be in the shoebox. I was too scared to switch on the light, so I waited until the sun rose. 

I found Item 620 at the foot of my bed, sat on top of a blanket. It was rustier than it had been the night before, new speckles of red eating up the grey surface.

\*

Another day. I put Item 620 back into the shoebox. Cooked breakfast, ate half of it, threw the rest away. Picked hymns for mom’s funeral (‘How Great Thou Art’ was her favourite), asked mom’s best friend to make sandwiches. Answered even more phone calls than I could count. Learnt how to respond to ‘I’m so sorry’ without wanting to tell the other person to drop dead.

But cousin Joe didn’t call. I was expecting him to. He’d told me that he would call yesterday. I even tried to call him, but it went straight to answerphone. I sent him a few texts, sent him a picture of us as kids to try and bait a response, but nothing. Messaged him on WhatsApp – two blue ticks to show that he’d read them, but he didn’t get back to me.

If I’m being honest, that really pissed me off – because I’d messaged Joe when his mom had died. So I tried calling Maria. Tried texting her, tried messaging her. Nothing. At the lowest point of my life, they’d abandoned me.

I had too much to drink that night, sat in my deckchair, waiting for the sun to go down. And that’s when I saw her. Only for a second, for half of a heartbeat, for the length of a thought – such a quick glimpse that I didn’t quite believe it.

Stood in the middle of my lawn, dead still, arms at her side, a little girl. Covered in mud and soil, leaves and twigs twisted into her hair. Eyes unblinking, hands covered in dry blood. She wore shorts and a shirt that was made out of straw, with a patch above her stomach stained red. She wasn’t wearing any shoes. She was looking right at me, the young girl from the waiting room, and then she was gone.

I’m not going to lie. I pissed myself.

\*

I tried to call Joe again, tried Maria. Still nothing. So I made sure that I locked the door, checked three or four times, went to bed with a knife at arm’s reach. I didn’t want to go to bed, didn’t want to sleep, but I was just so tired. I couldn’t resist, even though I knew what I was about to dream of.

Suddenly I was back in the grass, heart thumping, men and women screaming, the sun cooking me, and I had that gun in my arms, that assault rifle, and those pattering footsteps were getting closer, bare skin on grass. Closer, closer, closer. So my finger pressed the trigger and –

A weight on my chest. An unbelievable heaviness. I was lying on my back – I can still remember it now. Every moment of it.

Hot breath against my face, as if something was hovering right above me. But all-consuming darkness. And a hard hand pressed against my chest, crushing into my ribs with so much force that I thought they might break.

Then, suddenly, complete silence. The weight disappeared. A long breath, my arms and legs paralysed, then – *creaaaakkkkk.* The door closed, the room was empty. I could move again.

I moved my right arm, just an inch at first – just to make sure that this was real, that this wasn’t a dream, that I was still alive. Then I brought my hand up to where I’d felt the weight pressing into me, where I’d felt *him.* 

And I found it. Item 620. Sat on my chest, above my heart.

\*

I would have called the police, if it wasn’t for my collection. I know that’s unreasonable – stupid, even – but I didn’t want them to take it from me. But I was terrified – spent the rest of the night wide awake, watching movies, clutching my knife in my hand. Praying that this was all over. Wishing that I could go back to that moment in the hospital, the moment I took that ring from mom’s finger and stole her father from her. 

\*

The next morning, I put Item 620 back into the shoebox. I didn’t hear from Joe or Maria. Instead, I heard from Helena. I didn’t know that Helena existed until the phone rang, but she’d known about me for almost ten years. She was in her fifties, and she said that she was married to my dad. She known about me and mom. She’d known about the empty house, about the three vans, about those stolen photo albums.

And she’d called me because she couldn’t hold back the bad news. She had to tell me, to get that weight off of my chest. She’d had my phone number all this time, found it on my Facebook, but never had a reason to call me until now. 

Helena and dad had been side by side, watching a movie. Then dad had complained about a weight on his chest, a searing pain pressing into him. He’d tried to move, but his arms and legs had been frozen. When he stopped breathing, Helena performed CPR. She performed it for 35 minutes whilst she waited for the first aid responders to arrive. But dad had died in her bed – died of a major heart attack.

The king of our home, the money maker and the house breaker, was finally gone. I thanked Helena for calling me, and she told me that I would be welcome to go to dad’s funeral, if I wanted to. As long as I promised to not kick up a fuss. I thought that was fair.

I didn’t want to mourn dad, not whilst mom’s death was so fresh, not after everything he’d done to us. Not whilst Joe and Maria refused to pick up their phones. Not whilst that ring sat in my home – something I was too afraid to get rid of. But I did mourn him, because just like dad had left mum with her jewellery, dad had left me with one thing that I would always carry with me – his absence. And now even that was gone.

\*

I saw the young girl three times that day. I saw her when I hung up the phone after talking to Helena. She was stood in front of the window, staring into the house. Her eyes unblinking, set on me – her bloodied hands pressed against the glass. Then I saw her in my bathroom mirror, over my shoulder, as I brushed my teeth. I’d come to accept her at this point, to accept that I deserved this. So when I saw her in the corner of my bedroom as I prepared to go to sleep, I wished her goodnight.

And then I was back in the long grass, and my finger had pressed that trigger, and the world was thick with smoke and fire – and I heard her scream. One long scream, and then the soft thud of a body dropping to the ground. There were leaves and twigs tangled in her hair, and she wore a shirt made of straw – 

And it shouldn’t have been her! Wasn’t supposed to have been. And oh shit, there was nothing I could do to fix it. Nothing to stop that oozing wound. And she was so silent now, still breathing but wordless. She lifted up her right hand, and I saw that she was wearing the ring. Slightly too big for her. 

She slid it off of her hand, muttered a few words that I couldn’t understand, and passed it over to me. It was slick with blood, speckled with it, as if the ring was covered in blood. I rubbed it against my shirt, and all I could say was sorry. So sorry. This shouldn’t have happened. I’m so sorry. And she rattled and – 

*Creaaaakkkkk.* The door closed. But the room wasn’t empty. I’d left the curtains open, moonlight illuminated the room, and I couldn’t see anything – but I knew he was here. There was a long moment of silence, and then – 

*Thud.* A heavily booted footstep, near the door. *Thud.* Another footstep, closer now. *Thud.* Another. Even nearer. I couldn’t move, couldn’t do anything.

But I could hear him moving. *Thud.* And now I could see through the darkness, could see *something.* Piercing white eyes, like the eyes of my mother the night we’d sat on those airbeds – but they were tearless. Solid black pupils, unblinking. Coming closer and closer and closer.

*Thud.* And now I could see his face. Long and thin, with a stubbled chin. The face of a man in his twenties who had seen too much. Pale and wrinkled, peeling lips. A smear of blood on his cheek. And a helmet on his head. *Thud, thud, thud.* Walking faster now, towards me. My grandad. Holding something in his hand –

The ring.

I wanted to fight back, or to run, or to just do something. But I still couldn’t breathe. And now I could feel his foul breath on my face, his solid hand pressed against my chest. His eyes stared into mine, a deep pit of nothing.

And suddenly I could move again, but I wasn’t in control. I lifted up my right arm, my right hand, and he took it. 

Then I was back in the long grass. Alone. Covered in dirt and sweat and blood, my gun at my feet, the ring in my hand. I tried to put it onto my finger, but it didn’t fit. So I put it into a pocket. I’m so sorry, I said.

\*

This morning was the first morning in a while that I woke up with the sun – the first morning that I woke up from a deep sleep. But I woke up with a hand covered in dried blood, my fingers throbbing – a sudden burst of excruciating pain.

I won’t be too graphic in my description here, but if I were to tell you that Item 620, that tiny ring, had been forced onto my index finger, had been forced all the way down so that it touched my knuckle – well, I’m sure your imagination could do the work.

I tried to call Joe and Maria today, even tried Helena – nothing. No response. I went to hospital, half expected to see the young girl, but I haven’t seen her today either. 

It’s mom’s funeral tomorrow, and I don’t want to go to sleep. I want to burn my collection to the ground – I don’t want to return to his dreams. I don’t want to return to the long grass. I don’t want to feel his breath against my face, his hand pressed against my chest. I wish I could give mom her ring back. That ring was a part of him, but I don’t want to keep him.
