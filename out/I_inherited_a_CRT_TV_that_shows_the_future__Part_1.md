My boyfriend was very strange. He would sometimes say stuff like "I can record audios if I place my finger on my belly button" or "you know, the moon landing was actually fake, because there is no longer a moon since 1941 when we blew it up during WW2". I'd just shrug it off since he was so loving and kind. The last weird thing he ever told me is that he had bought an old CRT TV that could show the future.



He passed away 2 months ago. We had been together for a year and eight months, and the shock still hasn't subsided. I've been trying to keep myself busy, but it's hard. No matter how weird he was, I truly loved him.

The other day, his mother sent me some of his old stuff that she had no use for anymore. She said it was all things he had acquired during the time we were dating, and that it should be mine. She already had his childhood stuff. I accepted it, reluctantly. I understood what she felt, but the least I needed right know was things to remember him by. 

I received two boxes, one small and one large. In the small box there were a bunch of weird books on extraterrestrial life and electronic equipment, some comic books, a pair of aviator goggles, and a half eaten pack of bubblegum. On the large one, a 16 inch CRT TV. I didn't really know what to do with these things, so I just kept them stashed on top of my wardrobe.

Not much happened after that, at least until about two weeks ago. I remembered the story about the TV being able to show the future. Although I had ignored it, chalking it up to one more of my boyfriend's weird stories, I eventually thought that this was the first time I could actually check if he was telling the truth. Aside from that, I'll be honest, I was a bit excited. In a frenzy, I removed the TV from the box and put it on a dresser I had across from my bed. There it stood, the shiny screen, a curved mirror reflecting its surroundings like a convex camera. I stared at it for a while, admiring the effect. Then, I focused on my own reflection. A dark shadow, with almost indistinguishable features. I could hardly make out two eyes on the dark amorphous round shape. I tried to stare deeply into my own eyes at the screen, but was filled with unease when I did it. A chill ran down my spine, and I averted my gaze. I decided to clean my house and try to forget about the subject.

Still, the idea didn't leave my head, and I decided I had to check if the story was true. One night, I finally gathered the courage and tried to connect the plug to the socket on the wall behind the dresser, but to my shock (no pun intended), it wouldn't fit. The plug must have been an older model. I took a picture of it and went to a hardware store on the way to my job the next day. I asked one of the salesmen there for an adapter and he promptly helped me to find one. I couldn't really contain my excitement and I was jittery all day at work, despite not actually believing my boyfriend's story. It was a mixture of equal parts excitement and dread, a powerful combination. I was like a child who listens to a rumor about a videogame they have and can't wait to get home and test it. 

After I left work, I rushed straight home. The excitement was slowly being substituted by a somber thought: What if it was real? What if the TV really did show the future? Would I be willing to accept what it showed me, even if it wasn't good? And if it was bad, could I do anything to prevent it from coming true? I tried to avoid thinking about it any further. When I got home, I rushed straight to my bedroom, plug adapter already in hand. The TV stared ominously at me, the black screen reflecting my bed diffusely. I hesitated. Thinking once more about how silly my boyfriends' stories generally were, I decided to take the plunge. There was just no way this was real. 

I couldn't have been more wrong.
