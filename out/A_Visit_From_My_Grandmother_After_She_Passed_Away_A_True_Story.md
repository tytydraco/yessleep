My connection with my grandmother was always something special, something beyond the ordinary. She was the person who raised me, who was there for every important moment in my life. As I grew older and began my own journey, I moved out and followed my path. Yet, my grandmother never ceased to be a central figure to me, a constant presence in my heart.

Years passed, and one day I received the news that no one is ever truly prepared to hear: my grandmother had passed away. The sadness that enveloped me was something I had never experienced before. It was an emptiness, a dark void that seemed impossible to fill. It was the first time I felt the real weight of loss, and the pain was almost unbearable.

Three days after she passed away, on an ordinary night, I was lying in bed, in that state between sleep and wakefulness, where reality and dreams seem to blur. I felt a strange uneasiness, as if something was out of place. I began to have visions of a place that felt disturbing, an odd, dark environment. It unsettled me deeply, but at the same time, I knew I was awake, fully aware of what was happening around me.

Suddenly, I felt a presence in the room. Still lying down, I turned my head slightly and saw someone standing beside the bed. The figure was draped in a sheet that covered their entire head. My heart raced, a mix of fear and curiosity washed over me. The sheet then slowly slipped off, revealing my grandmother's face. But there was something different about her. Her face was younger, almost as I remembered from when I was a child. And there was a glow to her appearance, something that radiated peace.

For a few moments, she stood there, looking at me, as if time had stopped. Those seconds felt like an eternity. And then, she vanished. But the experience didn’t end there. I felt the bed sink beside me, as if someone had sat down. Although I was facing away, I knew it was her. It was as if my grandmother was right there with me, present in a way that defied all logic.

At that moment, I felt her arms around me, in a hug I so desperately needed. Without hesitation, I asked her the two questions that were burning inside me. "Are you okay?" I asked, my voice trembling. She answered yes, with a softness that brought me immediate relief. "Do you remember me?" This was the question that tormented me the most, as before she passed, my grandmother had been dealing with Alzheimer’s, and the thought that she might not remember me was painful. But to my surprise, she answered yes, she remembered me.

Although I have the impression that we talked more, my memory doesn’t hold the details. Only those two questions, those two answers, remain vivid in my mind. Everything was so clear, so real, that I am absolutely certain it wasn’t a dream. I was awake, conscious, and I knew exactly what was happening.

After that night, something changed within me. The sadness that once felt like an unbearable weight gave way to a sweet longing. It was no longer pain but a serene certainty that my grandmother continued to exist, somehow, somewhere else. Since then, I carry with me this peace, this certainty that the love we shared transcends any barrier, even death itself.
