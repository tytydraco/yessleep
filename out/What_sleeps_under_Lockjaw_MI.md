Let me start this by saying Emily and I were not what you would consider friends. We met our freshman year of high school but besides traveling in the same social circles, we never really connected. After we graduated, she ended up at a university on the other side of the state and we all stopped hearing from her. We assumed she had moved on and so we did the same. That was until, to my surprise, a text lit up my phone screen a week ago. 

All it said was, “Wanna go on an adventure?”

Now, Emily had the reputation that an adventure for her would be a Star Wars movie marathon with popcorn. While there is nothing wrong with that, it felt strange that she would be texting me of all people. At first, I thought she was probably going to some nerdy convention or concert and wanted me there so other guys would leave her alone. What I didn’t expect was what she told me next.

The text was straight to the point, “Urban exploring? Good spot by me. You in?”

Like most people, I’ve watched videos on social media of guys parkouring through old factories and flying drones through broken windows. In one of the few conversations Emily and I had together, I vaguely remember mentioning interest in it. But now I was a little hesitant. I only had one year left until graduation and so far I’ve steered clear of the Law. The last thing I needed was to start my new life off with a stain on my record.

Then again, this would be one of my last times to act like a kid. One of my last times to let free, without the weight of adulthood and responsibilities. So, after some back and forth, I gave in.

“Yeah sure, where we headed?”

Emily responded almost immediately.

“Lockjaw, MI.”

A quick Google search showed it was an old automotive town that now gave the Rust Belt its name. For a lack of better words, it was a shit hole in the middle of nowhere.

I only had classes Monday to Thursday, so once that Friday rolled around, I loaded up my beat-up old Honda Civic and made the nearly 4-hour drive north. I wish I could say I was at least a little hesitant about the whole idea. Sadly, I was too excited for a little taste of adventure and excitement to care what came next. Little did I know what I was signing up for.

Our meet-up location was an old, dingy motel that shared a parking lot with a WaffleHouse one county over from Lockjaw. Emily was already there, leaning against her car in all black, when I arrived at around 11 pm.

“Why, hello there stranger,” she said with a smile.

“Hey,” I said getting out of my car.

“You ready?”

“Ready as I’ll ever be. What’s the plan?”

“Oh, you know, breaking, entering, that sort of deal.”

“Wait what?”

“I’m kidding,” she punched my shoulder, “place we’re going has been shut down for decades.”

“Had me a little concerned there for a second. Where are we going?”

“Somewhere cool. But first, you eat yet?” She asked.

We ended up in a booth at the WaffleHouse. Emily had a massive backpack that took up nearly half her bench. When she opened it to pull out a map, I saw she had several large books in there.

“So, see this?” She asked, laying the map out on the grease-pocked table.

It was a map of Lockjaw. It was an old map, probably from the 50s or 60s, but a map all the same. Her finger rested on an intersection on the outskirts of town.

“Yeah, what about it?” I asked.

“That’s where we’re going.”

“Why there?”

“It's an old hospital. During the day there’s like 3 or 4 squad cars patrolling, but at night there’s only 1.”

“I don’t know how I feel about going into an old hospital.”

“Oh come on. Do it for me? Please!” She begged.

I wasn’t sold. I should have threatened to go home if we didn’t change our location. There were plenty of abandoned auto factories that would have been great. But this is where I admit my foolishness. While there was no romantic history between Emily and me, I was still hoping for at least a little action over that weekend. In my childish mind, I rationalized the best way to make that happen was by keeping her impressed and happy. Boy, what a fool I was.

“Fine,” I relinquished, “But I set the rules.”

“Ok,” She chirped.

“I say when we leave and where we go and don’t go.”

She paused and considered my proposal before answering.

“That’s fine.”

We talked for a little longer over some pieces of crispy bacon. Emily insisted that we would have to wait until the early hours of the morning because that was when there were fewer cops. It made me antsy having to wait, but it was nice talking to Emily. She’d changed since I last saw her. Her blonde hair now had a streak of red and she took great joy in showing me the tattoo sleeve on her left arm. Seeing her point out each spider, goat head, and pentagram was weird, only to be reminded that she was still a nerd as she eagerly switched the topic to her archival work at her university. 

Eventually, Emily deemed it time and we left the WaffleHouse at around 2:35 AM. It would take us about 30 minutes to get to the hospital and we would have until 6 AM to explore before more cops came back. I was anxious as soon as we hit the road, but Emily’s bubbly and excited personality put me at ease. Looking back, she grew more enthusiastic with every mile marker we passed. By the time we got to the intersection outside the hospital, I had caught her energetic bug, that was until the headlights slid across a sign at the entrance of the hospital and my stomach crashed.

MORRISON LOCKJAW MENTAL HOSPITAL

“What the hell, Emily? I thought you said this was a hospital, not some loony bin!” I hissed.

“Oh relax would you? It's the same thing,” She waved away my concerns.

“No seriously, Emily. I don’t think I can do this.”

“Oh come on. You scared some ghosts are gonna come get ya? It's just a building.”

I didn’t have any reason to be scared. But then again humans have a collective fear of the dark when in reality the world is the same in the dark as in the light. That’s how I justified it at least, crazy what you can make yourself believe when there’s sex on the line.

We pulled off onto the side of the road about a half mile past the sign. The hospital was surrounded by a forest with multiple overgrown walking trails which made it easy to sneak right past the one cop in the parking lot. Getting access to the building was equally as easy. Emily led me around the back to a shattered window on the first floor. She crawled in using an empty trashcan as a step stool while I just hopped through.

I was full of adrenaline by this point and the boy-like wonder of exploration was taking over. The hallways were a creepy mix of peeling pastels and littered floors. Several walls were covered in graffiti with the spray cans lying underneath their artwork. I tried a couple only to find they were empty. 

There were several rooms where I peeked my head in through open doors and broken observation windows. Some were normal doctors' offices, with overturned desks and old beat-up couches. Others were more sinister; in the middle of one room sat a gurney covered in mysterious stains. In another,  with a red pentagram graffitied on one of the walls, there was a list full of crossed-out names. At the top read *Potential Suspects* only for suspects to be scribbled over by the word sacrifices.

I was having fun exploring when Emily walked up to me and grabbed my hand.

“You know, I always thought you were pretty cute,” She whispered into my ear. 

I pulled back stunned. She bounced her eyebrows and bit her lip. Slowly, she pulled her hand free and while keeping perfect eye contact disappeared into an adjacent hallway.

I like to think I am a very controlled person who doesn’t let emotions get the best of him. But I won’t lie, my heart was skipping a few beats. I was probably standing there for a solid minute before I regained control of my senses. A few more moments after that, I began pursuing her. The hallway ended in a flight of stairs, one going up and the other down. Naturally, I assumed she went up until after a few steps, I heard her calling from below.

“Down here silly,” she giggled.

I paused. So far I had enjoyed this adventure, however, I was not going down into that basement no matter what. 

“Hey Emily, remember our rule,” I called out down into the darkness.

She didn’t respond.

“Hey. I’m not going down there.”

“Don’t be such a stick in the mud. I thought you’d be cool.”

“You agreed to the rules.”

“Rules never said anything about this,” She said. 

The next thing I knew, her jacket flew from the darkness and came to rest at the foot of the stairs. The monkey part of my brain took over and I slowly began to work my way down into the basement. Alarm bells were ringing, there was just no one to hear them.

The stairs emptied into a long, dark, narrow corridor. The air felt icy cold and stale with distinct hints of antiseptics and vomit. At the end of the hall, I could see flickering lights coming from an open room. A trail of clothes led from the base of the stairs to the opening. A shoe, a sock, pants, a blouse. I crept down the hall, so distracted I didn’t even read the signs on each door. *Archives. Morgue. Test Room 6. Suspect Holding Chamber.*

I reached the the open door and paused outside, I don’t know what I was thinking but I quickly jumped into the room ready to scoop her up. She wasn’t there. The hospital room looked like any other. A gurney with restraints sat in the middle, against one wall sat a deep and wide metal sink, and adjacent was a large medical device that I could only assume its original purpose. But what was strange were the dozens upon dozens of red candles that covered the floor. Each candle was burning atop the melted corpses of their forebears. There was barely enough space to step into the room. 

“Emily?” I called out as I stepped deeper into the room.

The candles could have just been mood-setters, I told myself. I am such an idiot.

Emily’s books, the ones she had been carrying in her backpack, sat open on the gurney in the middle of the room. I carefully stepped over to the gurney to see what was written in them. Using a nearby candle for light, it became clear very quickly that I wouldn’t be able to read them. Every page of these massive tomes was filled with what I could only assume to be Latin. There was one phrase I did recognize, however. Firelight danced across the page as I read. Carefully written beneath a massive illustration of an inhuman beast were the words: *Pandemonium Regnat Rozonoth Erigit*.

The illustrated beast above was the stuff of nightmares. The body of a centipede, impossibly long and winding, covered in an uncountable number of eyes with legs like human arms. It was wreathed in darkness and flames. 

I slowly flipped the page. The words remained illegible except for a couple of very colorful sticky notes. While several of them possessed nothing more than drawings of runes, a few had written words. They said things like “*Ender of flame*” or “*Finality*”. I found one sticky note that was being used to bookmark a specific page. I flipped to it.

The page was full of sticky notes, each one a mad rambling or drawing. Underneath I could just barely see the page. It was a set of illustrations showing people bringing pigs, chickens, and people in chains to a burning figure. There were a few sticky notes that stuck out to me. They read as such, “*Bound in blood*” and “*A promised offering.*”

I slammed the book shut. To say it had killed the mood would be an understatement.

“Very funny Emily,” I called out, “Very scary. Haha, good prank.”

There was no response.

“Come on, Emily. You can come out now. I don’t know what I did but I’m sorry.”

Silence.

“Emily?”

I looked around and that was when I noticed something I hadn’t seen when I first walked into the room. Behind the large medical device, there was a section with no candles. It was pitch black. An inky darkness seemed to ooze from that corner. Not due to the lack of light, no, this darkness seemed to repel it. Every time I blinked it seemed to grow. I had enough of Emily’s stupid games; I was getting out of there. I started towards the door, looking back only after I had reached the hallway. I shouldn’t have stopped.

Something hit me from behind with full force sending me sprawling out onto the floor.  Before I could react I heard the door slide shut and reverberate with a heavy click. I shot up and began pounding on the door’s window.

“EMILY! EMILY GET ME OUT OF HERE!” I shouted.

The only response I got was a crazed cackling.

I turned around. Even though my fall had snuffed out several candles, there were still dozens of them flickering away. Then one went out. Then another. Slowly, one by one a trail of candles extinguished, originating from the dark corner. I stepped back until I was pinned in the corner. Tears rolled down my cheeks before I even knew I was crying. Another candle went out. Then another. 

The cackling echoed through the hallway even louder than before. It was morphing into something more deranged, more inhuman. The candles up to the gurney had gone out by now. I was done for. This was the end. 

Suddenly, the door clicked and rolled open. I fell back into the hallway. A flashlight was immediately trained on my face with a Taser gun right below it.

“Well, well, well,” the voice holding the flashlight said, “looks like we got ourselves a trespasser.”

It was a cop.

I jumped up and grabbed him by the collar.

“We gotta go! We gotta go!” I must have seemed like one of the hospital's former patients at that moment.

“Don’t worry,” the cop said, grabbing my wrist and pinning it behind my back, “you're gonna go straight to county.”

He began leading me towards the stairs. A wave of relief washed over me. I didn’t care about anything else at that moment besides just getting out of there.

“NO!” A scream echoed from behind us.

We both turned to see Emily standing there in her underwear at the end of the hallway. It was only now that I could see her right arm. It was covered in a lattice cross patch of scars and fresh wounds. In her left hand, she held a large, ornate knife.

“Jesus, what did you do to her?” The cop asked me.

“I-I-I-I,” I stammered.

“Shut the fuck up,” he hissed at me handcuffing one of my wrists to the stair’s railing.

“No no no don’t trust her!” I screamed.

“I said shut it!” the cop shouted before walking towards her, “Ma’am, I’m with the police. I am here to help.”

By the time the officer was halfway down the corridor, the candle closest to the open door went out. What happened next occurred in the flash of a second. The officer flew into the wall. This wasn’t like in the movies where he would get up afterward. It was like he was hit by an invisible train. His body crashed into the wall, I could hear his bones snapping and his skin and muscles bursting. He stayed there for a second before the crumpled remains of his body slid to the floor. 

I couldn’t breathe. My vision went blurry. In one blink Emily was there and in the next, she wasn’t. I don’t know how but she ended up in front of me, looking down with soulless eyes. Blood dripped from her fingertips. Her gaze shifted from me, to the cuffs, and then to the knife in her hand. 

“Hey, hey, hey. Wait,” I put my free hand up, scooting as far back as I could, “let’s talk about this. We can talk.”

She stood over me. Then she turned. I vaguely remember her walking over to the remains of the cop, grabbing his belt, and dragging him back into the candle room. Her face was an emotionless rock as she did. She paid no attention to me, probably accepting the fact that I couldn’t go anywhere. 

When she disappeared into the candle room, I began messing with the cuff on my wrist. The end locked to my wrist was too tight to slip out of, but the end clamped to the railing had some wiggle room. I wish I could say I acted with grace when freeing myself, but most of my efforts were relegated to yanking it and beating my hand. I don’t know why I deserved this, if I even deserve this. Sobbing didn’t do anything but I couldn’t control it anymore.

A shrill, blood-curdling scream echoed from the candle room. 

“Please! Please!” I heard Emily begging between tears, screams, and the sounds of breaking bones and fleshy pops. 

Somehow that drew my attention back to the moment. I reached around for anything that would help me out of these cuffs. My hand landed on a piece of rusty rebar. That would do. 

The gap between the railing and the cuff was enough for me to jam it through and begin pushing. It didn’t give out at first, but with each pained scream that pierced the air from the candle room, I put more and more desperate force into each push. Eventually, the cuff gave a metallic snap. I scrambled up the stairs not sparing a look back as I rushed through the hospital. 

The front door was closest to the stairs and was the first place I ran to. I slid and slammed into the doors, yanking on their handles only to find they were padlocked. I moved to testing the windows. My hope drained further with each one I tried. Every single window was boarded up with heavy plywood. My last hope would be the shattered window we entered through on the other side of the hospital, if I could find it that was.

After a few minutes of searching, I stopped to catch my breath. The hospital was dark and silent, there was not even the sound of wind blowing through the building. I was about to start searching again when I heard the faintest noise echo through the building.

*Thoom*.

At first, I didn’t think too much about it but I stopped and listened.

*Thoom.*

There it was again. It was slightly louder and caused the floor to shake.

*Thoom.*

*Thoom.*

*Thoom. Thoom. Thoom.*

*Thoom, Thoom, THOOM, THOOM!*

I crashed through the hospital, my eyes set on the window we had climbed through. The ground shook increasingly violently with every step. I heard screaming somewhere behind me, and slowly it morphed into a deranged cackle.

It was gaining on me, I could feel it. Then it came into view. The window.

I put what little strength I had left into that final sprint, making it just through the window as whatever that thing was in the basement slammed violently into the wall causing it to crack. Screaming and cackling echoed through the night as I made it back to my car. Tires screeched on the pavement as I peeled out as fast as possible. I didn’t stop as I drove out of town, almost hitting the *“Welcome to Lockjaw”* sign as I did.

That was last night. I am now several counties over and I plan to keep going. That demon, whatever it was, I feel it's still following me. Every time I let myself relax, thinking I am far enough away, I swear I can hear that cackling riding on the wind. I feel eyes on the back of my neck. Frankly, I don’t know what to do from here. I heard over the radio that the hospital went up in flames almost immediately after I escaped. Is there any escape now? Do I keep running? Do I just end it now and let it catch me? 

What few answers I have only lead to more questions. I know that Emily never meant for me to walk out of that hospital. I know she meant to leave me for the demon. The “why” is what I can not figure out. Why she did it, why it took her, why it chases me.

In truth, I don’t know why I am journaling here. Maybe it's so I feel less alone. Maybe it’s because I want some record of what happened last night in Lockjaw, MI. Believe me, if you wish, whether you do or don’t, I don’t care. Just know what we found in Lockjaw, MI is still out there. And after it is done with me, who knows where it’ll go.
