Nothing seems like a greater deterrent to dating than success. I don’t know what it is about this generation of men, but it feels like the more accomplished I get, the more I seem to attract the riff-raff. Years of winning medals for the swim team in college brought enough publicity to keep the good ones away while attracting those who fed off my fame like vampires. It’s not that I didn’t know this would happen. My mother always warned me. Traditional men don’t want someone submissive, they want someone independent that they can break. 

And I knew I would never fall for it. At least that’s what I thought, until I met Richard.   
  
He had this softness about him that I didn’t quite expect. His charm, passion, and fake feminism drew me in like a sucker. Maybe all those years in a dating desert gave me an unquenchable thirst, a longing. Or maybe anyone would have fallen prey to him. There was, after all, something otherworldly about him. 

It started with a book. I left my copy of “All about love” behind in my favorite coffee shop. When I came to retrieve it, his hand met mine.  
  
“Excuse me.” I glanced at the handsome stranger.   
  
“Ah, you found my book.” He smiled.

  
“Uh, that’s my book.” I showed him the front page with a dramatic flourish. My name was as legible as chicken scratch.

  
“So it is.” He mused.   
  
“You read bell hooks?” I asked.  
  
“Shouldn’t everyone?” He raised an eyebrow.   
  
I faltered for a second. Don’t fall for it. This has to be his schtick or something.   


“Did you forget your matcha latte and canvas tote as well?”  
  
“I think if more men spent time actually trying to become the men they pretend to be, women wouldn’t need to be so cautious of them.” His words felt like honey and I, the hungry bear, fell for his trap.   
  
He was entirely too handsome and it made me incredibly nervous. I fiddled with my metal lighter as we spoke. I swung the lid open and closed. The repetition and sound helped relieve some of my stress.  
  
“Do you smoke?” He asked, with clear apprehension on his face.  
  
“Ah, not anymore. I just carry this for…luck I guess.” My mom had given it to me before she died. It was the only thing I had left from her.  
  
He looked relieved. “Oh good. I have very delicate lungs. I don’t do very well around smoke.” 

“Noted.” I nodded. “I’m Charlie by the way.”  
  
“Richard but you can call me-”

“Dick?” I stifled a laugh.   
  
His smile was infectious. “I was going to say Richie, but honestly you can call me anything you’d like.”  
  
“Including Dick?”  
  
“Maybe *almost* anything.”   
  


A simple moment in time set in motion a wildfire of passion. The dates, late night phone calls, naughty encounters, and delivered flowers swept me up like nothing had before. He was both the perfect gentleman and the perfect savage. He satisfied me in every way I wanted.   
  
Except for a gnawing voice at the back of my head. It seemed too calculated, too real. Almost as though he was programmed as the lead character in my otome game. He seemed to know my every move before I even made it. I was so far gone, drunk on his attention, I didn’t even notice the small ways he was chipping away at my life. Until, one day, he invited me on a trip.   
  
“I’ve never been on a cruise before.” I confessed.   
  
“That makes it even more exciting. I get to see you experience everything for the first time.” He was too convincing. I wish I had put up more of a fight or at least listened to that raw unease in my gut every time I thought about it.   
  
It was not your standard, commercial cruise of three thousand guests. Other than the crew, only thirteen total of us boarded. A very intimate arrangement. The ship itself was about a fourth the size of a typical cruise ship, with all the suites being at least two thousand square feet each. Every unit was equipped with its own outdoor hot tub and veranda. I let my imagination consider all the possible things we could do in that private hot tub, overlooking the ocean.   
  
After we boarded and left the harbor, Richard led me to my room, where I would be staying by myself. I felt like I had my own mini apartment. At first I thought Richard would be sharing the room with me, but he insisted I feel like a princess on this trip. He said his room would be next door if I needed anything.   
  
“Distance makes the heart grow fonder, my love.” At this point he’d grow accustomed to kissing my hand so I didn’t think much of it at the time.   
  
“I guess.” 



“Let me know when you’ve settled in. I can’t wait for you to meet the other guests.”



What I expected was to meet work acquaintances, people he played pickle ball with, or his neighbors. Nothing could have prepared me for the truth.   
  
I met Richard in the ballroom wearing the dress he’d picked out for me. It was gold and made of thousands of tiny pieces of metal, likely connected together by hand. The fabric made a lovely rustle as I walked and felt deliciously cool on my skin. He greeted me warmly and took a moment to behold my appearance.   
  
“You’re more beautiful than a galaxy. And believe me, I would know.” He kissed my cheek gently.   
  
“Thank you.”  
  
“Come.” He led me to join the rest of the group. “Let me introduce you to my collection.”  
  
My heart sank at his words and my eyes looked on in horror. Twelve women, various beauties of different backgrounds and body types stood before me, all wearing the same dress as me.  
  
“Your…*collection?*” I spat in disbelief. 



“Now, now. Don’t be that way. I chose you because you are exceptional. Just like every one of these ladies.” He beckoned to them and they flocked like obedient pets, surrounding him, and doting on him.   
  
“I thought you loved me.”   
  


“I do.” He insisted. “Just like I love them.” He walked around slowly kissing the hand of each woman. The gesture disgusted me, my own hand burning at the realization.  
  
“The thing about flowers” he mused, “Is that they wilt too soon to truly enjoy their beauty. If you let me, I can show you a way you will never wilt. Captured in perfection forever.” He smiled and slowly outstretched his arms to me. “Come Charlotte. I promise the procedure will be painless.”  
  
“Come” His woman army echoed mindlessly.  
  


“Oh hell no.” I immediately bolted back to my room. Richard was close behind, followed by his entourage in heels.   
  
“Please stop, you’re only making this more difficult for yourself.” He seemed so calm and it angered me more. “There’s nowhere to go. We are in the middle of the ocean.”  
  
“Shut up!” I removed one of my heels and threw it at his face. He caught it with insane precision and closed the gap between us.   
  
I felt his hand snatch my left ankle and my face suddenly met the deck. Dazed but pumped on adrenaline, I removed my other heel and jammed it into his face. He let out a gurgling scream. I wiggled back and forth till I freed myself from his almost superhuman grip. I ignored the crunching sound and searing pain. My only goal was survival.   
  
As I limped away, his doting army surrounded him to try to tend to his wounds, letting out unearthly calls of distress.   
  
After I reached my room, I bolted the door, and searched for the orange life vest. Richard and the women pounded on the door furiously. I knew it wouldn’t hold for very long.  
  
Suddenly a glimmer of metal caught my eye. My lucky lighter lay ceremoniously on the bed where I had left it. “Sensitive lungs eh?” I ripped open the mini bar and started emptying them all on the bed. With one rip of my lighter I set a coffee filter aflame. Dropping onto the bed, it ignited quickly and grew. I rushed out to the veranda with the life vest and shut the door on the flames spreading behind me.



As I climbed on the metal railing, my left ankle buckled with pain. I knew there was a chance I wouldn’t generate enough force to clear the decks below. You’ve got this Charlie. You’ve got this. With all the force I could muster, I dove from the deck towards the ocean water. 



They say traditional men want someone independent they can break and he did break me. That bastard broke my ankle in two places. What he didn’t count on was how flammable his ship was. I watched it burn down as I swam back towards my freedom.
