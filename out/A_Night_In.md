"Hi mom, what's up?"  
"Hi sweetie. Listen, I'm coming home a little later but I forgot the house key. Would you mind staying up?" I chuckle. Typical mom.  
"No, no problem. I'm going to have a game night anyway. Any idea when you'll be home?"  
"We're just out of the spa and going for a late dinner at the restaurant. You know how these things go. Won't be before midnight, I'm afraid."  
"Alright, I'll leave the backdoor unlocked just in case, okay?"  
"You're a darling."  
"So you're having a nice time, at least?"  
"Oh yes, we're really enjoying ourselves."  
"Good."  
"Alright sweetie. Enjoy your evening. There's some cold beers in the basement fridge, by the way."  
"Cool, thanks mom. Later." The line clicks and the call gets disconnected.

I'm not surprised. Every time mom and Val have a spa day at the resort a few towns over, I don't see her again until morning. But then, they so rarely get a chance to see each other these days, so I'm just happy mom gets to spend some time with her best friend. I go downstairs, grab some beers from the fridge in the basement and some snacks in the kitchen. It's started raining outside now. I can hear the drops softly pattering on the skylight in the kitchen. The forecast this morning has announced a downpour tonight so I figured it would be a perfect gaming night. I love the sound of rain, it soothes me.

Upstairs in my room, I fire up the old Playstation and before I know it, I find myself in Skyrim. I could play this game forever. There is something about the atmosphere, the first person view, the calm music that is so cozy. It feels like coming home and lulls me into a trance like state of serenity.

I wake up agonizingly slowly. First I become aware of my breathing, then my heavy body and limbs, I feel the dizziness in my head, taste the sleep in my mouth before I can finally open my eyes. It's completely dark all around me. I blink a few times before I can make out the silhouettes of my room's furniture. I hear a hazy sound outside my window that I slowly realize is the rain. It's really coming down now. And then suddenly it hits me: mom. Fuck!

I sit up and look for my phone on my bed. When I unlock the display, my stomach sinks. 02:14 AM. 12 missed calls. 7 text messages, 2 from mom, 5 from my voicemail. A glance at the upper right corner of my display reveals that my phone is still on mute. I gulp and open mom's messages.

*"What are you doing???"* 12:36 AM.

*"I checked into a motel. We'll talk about this in the morning. -Mom"* 01:21 AM.

Oh shit. I quickly dial the number of my voicemail and hold my phone to my ear.

*"Welcome to voicemail. You have -five- new messages. First new message, received Saturday, September 8th at 11:23 PM:*  
"Hi sweetie. It's mom." From the sound of it, calling from her car. I can hear the rain hitting her windshield and the softly squeaking sounds of the windshield wipers. "I'm just leaving the resort, be home in about an hour. Hope you haven't fallen asleep already. Anyway, see you in a bit!" -**click**\-

*Second new message, received Sunday, September 9th at 12:28 AM:*  
"Hey sweetie, it's mom. I'm home. Where are you? Tsk, tsk, tsk." I hear some clicking like she's pushing the doorbell button. Then silence. She knocks on the door. All the while I can hear the rain all around her. "I can see the light in the living room is still on. Come on, honey. Pick up, pick up, pick up." Silence, rain, more knocking, more rain, then a sigh. "Uhm... right, I'll go through the garden, hope you haven't forgotten to unlock the backdoor." -**click**\-

My mind races to last evening. Did I unlock the backdoor? I could swear I did but then clearly that is not the case since mom couldn't get in. I go over the evening in my mind but the more I try to remember, the more the memories slip away.

*Third new message, received Sunday, September 9th at 12:33 AM*, my voicemail continues without mercy.  
I hear loud knocking followed by the sound of a door handle that is repeatedly pushed down and released. "Jesus, Andrew, what are you doing?!" Mom sounds angry now. "Let me in, for crying out loud. It's cold and raining and I'm tired." Knocking, rain, the door handle, knocking, banging, rain. "If this is a joke, it's not funny. Pick up the phone, Andrew!" Silence. Rain. Knocking. Rain. Kicking. Rain. A frustrated growl. "Goddammit, Andrew!" -**click**\-.

Well, there's my answer concerning the backdoor, I suppose.

*Fourth new message, received Sunday, September 9th at 12:34 AM:*  
Banging on the door. The door handle is being furiously pushed down and released. But this time the sound is different. The sounds are more clear, the rain sounds like a loud patter on a window. A muted growl is heard. "Goddammit, Andrew!" That's mom's voice but it sounds muffled, like the rain. My stomach sinks and my heart skips a beat. This recording is clearly from inside the house. "Andrew, what are you doing?! If this is some kind of prank it's not funny!" Silence. Banging. Kicking. Rain. "I can see you behind that curtain, Andrew! Cut it out, now!"

I can't hear the rest of the message. My hand stiffens, my jaw clenches, my entire body is frozen and my breathing stops as my gaze slowly wanders to my half open door, peering into the darkness outside.

Silence. Rain. Silence.
