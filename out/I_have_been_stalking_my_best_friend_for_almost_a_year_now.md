I have been watching over my best friend for months now. At first, she was not aware that I stalk her. I have watched her eat, sleep, and even shower. I always walk behind her and sleep under her bed. For the first few months, she was scared of her stalker. She even went to the police for her safety. But after investigation, they could not find her stalker. Obviously they cannot find me. 

After months of practice, I have learned how to be invisible. I can move without making a sound. I can hide in the shadows like they are my own. I can make things move in the house without even making an entrance.

My obsession with my best friend began when she became pregnant with her child. I started following her. I woke up in her room every morning and my watch began. After months of being with her when I got to know she was having a baby girl, I got even more obsessed. 

When she was in her second trimester, my best friend was diagnosed with cancer. Doctors had to operate her womb, but fortunately the baby was safe. She has been going through chemotherapy since then. She used to be a beautiful bright girl, but now, I see her baggy eyes and bald head and a baby bump on a fragile body. She is barely alive. Her family is always there to support her. But no one can support her more than I do. 

Last month, she was in the grocery store with her mother. A guy in the store started to follow them to the parking lot. The guy didn't notice me. As she and her mother got inside their car, the guy went to his own car and started driving behind them. Little did he know that I sneaked on his hind seats. 

I knew he had some horrible intentions when I saw the duct tape and saw beside me. I thought to myself, "I have to react now, else it will be too late". So I took the saw and started chopping his head. The car crashed onto a tree, and it fell over the roof of the car. Instantly, he was crushed under the weight, but nothing happened to me. Nothing can happen to me as I already died in a car crash a year back. 

I watch over my best friend and even she knows it now. I had promised to be her guardian angel when I first met her. I kept my promise. I made a deal with the angels that I'll stay here until the baby is born and my best friend is fully recovered. 

Today, a healthy baby girl was born. Bestie named her after me. She knew that would be the highest form of honour that she could give me. The girl looks exactly like her. Bestie looks better than before. I can even see a few strands of hair growing on her head. 
Today is the day I will leave my astral self and say goodbye. Today is my one year death anniversary and my niece's birthday. I will always be protecting them no matter where, no matter when. I will always stalk her forever.
