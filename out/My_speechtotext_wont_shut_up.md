I opened the door with a trembling hand, kicked off my shoes the moment I stepped in, and tossed my messenger bag onto the couch. I wandered aimlessly into the kitchen.
“What a day!” I blurted, opening the fridge to find a lonely sausage sitting next to some leftovers I had no intention of eating.

“Tsk.” I snarled, grabbing the sausage and slapping it onto a plate before sliding it into the dirty microwave for a minute. Don’t judge me—I was starving.

I started unbuttoning my shirt, unbuckled my belt, and stripped off my clothes, leaving them scattered across the floor. Now in just a tank top and boxers—finally, some relief.
I slumped onto the dining chair, glanced toward the phone stand on the table, and began looking for my phone—then remembered it was still in my pants.

“Oh shit, I hope it didn’t crack,” I muttered, scrambling to dig through the pile on the floor. Eventually, I found it.

“Hey Annie, play 1000 Ways to Die videos!” I shouted into the mic.

*"1000 Ways to Die, playing.”*

“Sike! I thought you were dead!” I laughed at myself, placing the phone on its stand. I grabbed the sausage and started eating while the videos played.



Later, lying in bed, I whispered, “Hey Annie, set an alarm for 5:30 A.M.”

No response.

“Hey An—” I was cut off when the screen flickered. “Damn it, don’t tell me you're breaking down now!”

*"Setting an alarm for 5:30 A.M.”*

“Great, I tho—”

*"AaaAaaHhh... hE...”*

What the fuck?

I rubbed my eyes and forced my heavy lids open. It was 1 A.M. already. I needed sleep or risk another earful from the ‘gods of the corporate world.’ I looked at my phone again—the words I thought I saw were gone.
Stress? Sleep deprivation? Just my mind playing tricks?
I shook my head, chuckled, and told myself I needed sleep. But just as I was about to set the phone down, a new word appeared.

*“Help.”*



“How much would it cost to fix this?” I asked, placing the phone in front of a chubby guy with a full beard. “Can you fix it before 7 P.M.?” It was the end of the month. My upcoming bills were paid but the next ones won't stop, and then this crap happened. Why can’t this phone understand I’m living paycheck to paycheck?

“What’s the problem, bro?” he asked, brushing chip crumbs off his hands onto his shorts. He took my phone and looked it over.
“Well, I think it’s a software issue. My speech-to-text keeps activating on its own. Look at these screenshots—it’s been going on all day. I can’t type or use most functions. Even my music player’s glitchy because of it.”

He opened my gallery and scrolled through the screenshots.

*“Hskajucjskauchcjs aaaaa…”*
*“Elp!”*
*“Helo.”*
*“Aaaaanckciskckcj.”*
*“WAaAke.”*

“Bro… what the fuck is this?” he said, furrowing his brows; looking at me. “I don’t know! That’s why I brought it here! It started last night. I might’ve broken it when I tossed my pants—forgot my phone was still inside.”

“What an idiot,” he muttered, shaking his head.
“Hey! I heard that!” I snapped.
“Did you try turning off the speech-to-text feature?” he asked, rummaging through his tools.
“Yeah, it stopped briefly. But it kept asking for mic permissions. I kinda need that feature for work.”


“Migo, your mic might be grounded—could be picking up random sounds.”
“How much?”
“Hundred bucks. Just for you,” he said with the dumbest, yellowish smile.




I slouched on the couch, setting my phone back on the stand. “Don’t disappoint me now. You just got fixed,” I said, pointing at the phone.

“Hey Annie, play 1000 Ways to Di—”

*“HAhhaaaHAHAaHaha!”*

“WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?!”

*“GigGl…”*

“WHAT?!” I shouted, grabbing my phone and hurling it across the room.

It’s been days since this started. Sleepless nights, no music, no videos—not even an alarm. The phone’s basically useless except for that cursed speech-to-text. I can’t afford a new one, not even a secondhand piece of junk. Low pay, stacked bills... I’ve been waking up every hour just to avoid being late for work.

I picked up the phone and stared at it, cracked corner and all.

“You holding up, little fuck? Think you’ll last another month, huh?” I growled, inspecting the dents.
“What about your speaker? That still works?! This is the only device I have!” I yelled, spit landing on the screen. I jammed the volume up—at least that still worked.

“Now Annie, play Born to Die!”

*“WHY DON’T YOU?!”*

“WHAT THE FUCK!” I screamed as the phone suddenly blared a noise.

“HEY ANNIE! STOP FUCKING WITH ME!”

*“Hehehehe… HiHiihIhi…”*

*“Help. Told you…”*

I froze as the words appeared, each spoken in that robotic voice.

*“YOU CAN READ AND HEAR BUT CANNOT SEE!!”*

*“HELP. HELP. THAT’S WHAT.”*

“Stupid fucking phone!” I yelled, fists clenched. I didn’t know whether to be angry, scared, or just broken. What can’t I see?

*“HaHhAahA look at your face!”*

*“Stupid stupid stupidDdddD.”*

*“Have you tried doing anything better with your life?”*

“What the hell do you mean?! Who are you?! STOP HACKING MY PHONE!”

*“Hack? HaHahAh... What’s the word…”*

And then—the power went out.
Complete darkness.
I gripped my phone and checked the time. 2:57 A.M.

*“Have YoU trieD doIng it?”*

“STOP!!” I sobbed, voice cracking, every ounce of emotion pouring out. “Just stop... stop messing with my phone…” I whispered, jabbing at the torch icon.

*“No duDe…”*

Defeated, I set the phone down on the floor beside me, leaned against the wall, and stared. Waiting for whatever would appear next.

*“Have you tried doing it, Luis?”*

I didn’t respond. I was done. Just let me sleep. Let it be payday already so I can get a new phone. Maybe even eat something warm for once.

*“Told yOu. Do ITtt…”*

“Haha… Do what?” I let out a smirk and closed my eyes, letting my head fall back against the wall.

*“Have you tried looking at the other side?”*
The voice echoed across the room.
I opened my eyes slowly, turned my head—

And there *it* was.

A solid black, hairy face and body, grinning wide. Its jagged teeth stretched from ear to ear. The stench of rot filled the air. Its breath, warm and rancid, brushed against my cheek.




*"A man was found dead in his apartment. We apologize for the graphic details—he was missing the entire left side of his face, including his tongue. The cause remains unknown as the investigation continues".*

“Any evidence that might explain this?” a young officer asked.
"Not yet. Just this… glitching phone.”


*“HavE yoU tRied doInGgG....”*


*I whispered through the mic, voice cracking through my throat*
