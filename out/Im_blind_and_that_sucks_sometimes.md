I was not born blind. I used to see the bright colours of flowers, decorate my room with things I thought looked cute. Now slowly my vision is disappearing. The doctors told me I can still see 10% right now and that means mainly shapes. When it’s dark I cannot see anything.   

My father works in healthcare as a nurse and my mom is a 911 operator, which means long hours for them and me spending time alone in our house. It is not a large house, but it is not tiny either. I know every corner of the house and move around the house as if I’m not visually impaired.   

When I was around the age of 21 (I am not 23) I was diagnosed with glaucoma. It took around a year for me to go almost completely blind but I have learned to live with it. I work in education and I am still able to teach all of the 7 year old kids in my class. They ask me lots of questions and I don’t mind answering them at all. If anything I enjoy answering those curious little minds. 
  
The following happened in summer break, my parents were both working a late night shift and I was hanging out with my friend, Tiara. Usually when she comes over, she stays for a long time. She is like the only person I can tolerate for more then 24 hours. If you know, you know.   

We both finished watching (listening) our favorite series both tired from binge watching and a few tears left on our cheek because of the sad ending of it. Shortly after, she left and I went to clean up. I left the remaining popcorn for me to eat as I put on a podcast to listen to, while loading the dishwasher. I heard a chime from my phone, and VoiceOver started reading the message Tiara sent: ‘I’m home! Goodnight and thanks for the fun day’. I smiled and my podcast continued.  
 
The podcast talked about strange disappearances a few towns over, labeling it as a cold case. I huffed, as the disappearances are still happening thus I do not think the case is that cold yet. I turned off the kitchen lights and moved my way through the hallway towards the living room and I let myself fall back onto the comfy couch, reaching for the bowl of popcorn, when my phone chimed again. VoiceOver read the message that came from the security app.   

***‘Person detected backyard.’*** The voice said.  I frowned my brows. Is Tiara back? Or maybe it is a squirrel. Most of the times the system things those are persons too.   

I waved it off as being a squirrel, and went back to listening my podcast while shoving handfuls of popcorn in my mouth.   

About 2 minutes later my phone chimed again, and again the voice said that there was a person detected in the backyard. I turned my podcast off and listened, hoping I would hear footsteps or anything. I asked Siri my battery percentage, and when he mentioned it is 40% I was slightly relieved. Phone in my hand, I made my way to the back glass window, listening closely, but not being able to see anything in the pitch dark. The lights of the living room reflecting.  
 
I leaned my ear against the glass, hoping to hear anything. That was I heard a soft breath hitting the glass. I gasped and jumped back. I must be imagining things. The phone chimed again, the voice mentioning a person in the backyard again. I felt a chill run down my spine.   

I tried to look, hoping I might see something, someone. For the first time since my blindness, I cursed my lack of sight. I cupped my hands against the glass, looking.   
Someone was looking straight back at me. The reflection of the living room lights lit up the whites of his eyes. I screamed and fell back down. I grabbed my phone, calling 911 immediately. The door wriggled and I heard my breathing quicken.   

‘911, what’s the address of your emergency?’ A soft female voice I recognised as my mothers. I tried to be calm, I honestly tried, but as soon as I heard my mothers voice I was hysterical.   

‘Mom there is someone in the backyard, trying to break into the house.’ My voice was shaking and I felt tears streaming down my face. There was a few seconds of silence, which honestly felt like minutes.
  
‘Honey, I got the police send to our place, can you hide?’ She asks in a calm voice.   
‘Yes, Yes I try.’ I swallowed the lump in my throat and got up. The lights cut off. Shit.   

‘Mom-‘ I cried, now completely blind and scared for my life.   
‘What happened honey keep talking.’ She said, I heard panic in her voice but she tried to hide it. I reached for my air pods and after seconds of panicked searching I found them. I put one in my ear and put my phone down the front of my pants. Now I had my hands free to feel around. It was like I completely forgot what our house looked like.   

‘The light turned off, I can’t see anything mommy.’ I said. I remember trying to open my eyes, in hope that I could see more if I opened them wide enough.
   
‘Okay honey, where were you last?’ She asks.   

‘Living room.’ I replied softly.   

‘Okay,’ I heard the ticking of her keyboard, noting everything down I said. ‘Try to reach a wall, and feel your way to the doorway. Take an immediate right and go up the stairs.’ I frantically feel around, feeling the wooden door frame and pulling myself around the corner. I felt for the stairs, and once I felt them, I rushed upstairs. That’s when I remembered I did not lock the front door after Tiara left the house. 

Fuck.   

‘Mom, I have to lock the front door.’ I said, panic in my voice as I said it.  

‘Honey, don’t, just hide the police will be there in 7 minutes.’ She said. But I did not listen. I have to lock the front door.   

I turned around and rushed down the stairs, knowing where I was and adrenaline kicking in, I was faster than ever before. My phone chimed, the app’s robotic voice was a horror in my ear.
   
***Person detected front door***  
 
I walked to the side of the doorframe, feeling around for the doorbell system and pressing the little microphone button.   

‘please leave me alone.’ I said in a shaky voice. 
  
‘What are you doing honey? Go upstairs please.’ My mom said in a panic. 
  
‘Please leave me alone!’ I screamed with a hoarse voice.   

‘Why?’ I heard man’s voice was clear as day through the speakers. Surprise caught me as I had not expected this person to talk back.   

‘There’s nothing here for you to steal. Please go away.’ I said.   

‘Honey lock the door!’ My mom yelled in my ear.   

‘Who says I want to steal something?’ I heard the grin on the mans face as he spoke. I locked the doors, and activated the alarm. A quick ‘done’ left my mouth.   

‘Good, now go upstairs.’ My mom said hastily.   

I took a breath of relief and I turned around, ready to hide upstairs, when the man’s voice came through again.   

‘The question remains though,’ He stopped talking, and I stopped walking. ‘Did you just lock me in or out?’
