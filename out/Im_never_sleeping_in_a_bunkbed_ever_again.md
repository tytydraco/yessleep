I'm Steph, I'm a graduating student of medicine so as our final requirement we had to internship at assigned hospitals. Sometimes the hospitals were nearby my house but mostly they were far away. So i didn't have a choice, but to rent a space for a little while. This practical while, I was assigned to a place I had never been before. 

I called my friend Nicki to ask where she was assigned, and fortunately for us, she had the same scheduled place and dates as me. So we agreed to rent a room together and become roommates. 

We found a suitable boarding house, it was clean plus just one bus stop away from the hospital. So it was really convenient. 

Everything was fine until one evening. I was really tired after work so I decided to get some McDonald's nearby. After that I went back to our room. To unwind after a long day. My bed was the top bunk and Nicki slept on the lower bunk. 

While I was laying on my bed I was texting Nicki when she'd be home. Since we really hadn't seen eachother at the hospital lately. And as I was waiting for her to reply, I was just scrolling aimlessly on TikTok for a few minutes. When I heard the door open. 

Now the door was locked, but I didn't really think about it or pay much attention to it since Nicki had a spare key. Also I was watching a funny video, so I didn't even think to look up to see what's going on. Then I felt the bunkbed move a little, so I figured that she probably got into her bed too. 

After watching my funny video. I put down my phone and turned to her to asked; 

"Where have you been?" She said that she went to the grocery store to buy food for our breakfast for the coming days. We had our normal girly chit chat like always, but then it was time to go to sleep and she asked me to turn off the lights. The switch was besides the door so it was about 5 meters away from the bed. I was tired and groggy and too tired and lazy to get up and shut it off. 

I said; "You're closer than me, why don't you shut it off?"' But her voice got weaker, and she said; "I can't my head is aching, I want to sleep." So I got up frustrated and I was like, I'll just shut it off. And I glanced over at her, and the bed was empty. 

I moved my eyes around the room quickly, thinking that I must be seeing things. She was just there, in her bed. I walked around the room to see if she was playing a park on me or bluffing. I even checked our bathroom but it was empty. 

My hands started to shake and I couldn't move. I was so shocked and scared. Because who had I been talking to this entire time? Their voice was the same as Nicki's and I even felt a presence. 

Then all of a sudden, my phone rang. And it was Nicki. 

"Sorry Steph, I wasn't able to reply to you earlier because I was really busy at the hospital. I'm here at McDonald's near the building so I'll just wait here." Nicki said. 

I quickly hung up the phone and just ran out of the house with my pajamas on and I was barefoot. I didn't even care who was staring at me. I was so frantic and scared. Who was that talking to me in the bedroom? I don't have a third eye or something but I think that I just talked to a ghost, or dome entity. 

After that incident I always wait for Nicki to return. But this wasn't the first strange experience that I had. 

A few weeks earlier, I had this nightmare about that I was hiking on a snowy biome. It was a tall mountain in my dream, there was this drug or virus called Turbo, it made you go crazy and you wanted other people to get it too. 

I was himing this mountain with Nicki. And we found a building close to the top. We smiled as we thought that we had found a place to sleep. But oh we couldn't be more wrong. 

As I opened the door I screamed and hugged Nicki, when we saw an alien-like creature. The creature then grabbed my by my arm. 

"Inject her with Turbo." It said. I looked around and saw that there were people behind me. The creature threw me to the ground and left the room. I screamed and kicked as I heard Nicki trying to reason with this creature. I was held down by these other people in the room. When suddenly, the door swung open and I saw Nicki enter the room. She hugged me and I saw her holding a neelde with blue liquid. I kicked Nicki and pushed her, but she was to strong for me. Also did I fail to mention that she looked different. She was pale and skinny, almost like a zombie. 

I soon started to feel sick. Nicki grabbed me and held me down. I remember feeling woozy. And I felt the pain of the drug being injected in to my body. 

I screamed as I woke up, I looked down to check upon Nicki, who was still asleep. This dream kept occuring over and over. Until yesterday. 

But the weird thing about this is that I have a scar where Nicki stabbed the needle in my skin. 

And what if Nicki had secretly been injecting the Turbo into the people in the hospital?
