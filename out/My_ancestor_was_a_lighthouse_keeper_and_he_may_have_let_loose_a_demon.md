I always wanted an excuse to return home. As a child, my grandfather would tell me childhood tales of our long lost home, stories of skipping school and secret meetings at the old fort, of the long summer nights spent together under the midnight sun, of the sweeping beam of the lighthouse in the darkest of winter nights, and I couldn’t help but romanticise that old fishing village I’ve never set foot in. I spent days as a young boy, dreaming of one day returning to my old town, praying for an opportunity to visit those sprawling islets. And that lighthouse- It’s an understatement to say I was obsessed with that lighthouse. It featured prominently in all my drawings as a child, and would end up being the wallpaper of any device my family purchased until I was 10 years old. 

Ah shit, I can see I’ve been rambling again. For a bit of context, I am a history student currently studying in the University of Helsinki. My family has lived in Finland for 70 years, but we consider our real home to be a small town called Vardø, a fishing settlement located at the very very edge of Norway’s borders, so extremely north that the sun shines long into the night during the summer. The town is further east than Saint Petersburg, Kyiv, and Istanbul, and I’ve heard my grandparents describe it as “the edge of the world”.  My grandfather fled from norway as a child during the german invasion, and settled in Finland, eventually marrying a norwegian girl and starting a life anew.  

The reason I bring this up is because a few weeks ago, as part of my final year thesis, I had the opportunity to visit Vardø, wanting to do my thesis on my family’s history, and, living in some kind of detective fantasy, I began tracing my family’s history there from before the war. I visited my grandfather’s last remaining childhood friends, many of them bound to wheelchairs or stuck with walking canes. I spent long hours at the town hall, combing through every letter or correspondence with my family’s surname attached to it, and gradually began putting a family tree together. 

I realise as I’m writing this that you probably don't care about most of what I’ve just said, after all you probably are looking for the supernatural or occult, not some guy’s rants on how he filled in his family tree, but looking back I wish this was just another one of those boring “inspiring” stories you hear every other middle school student tell during their class project presentation about their family. For I’m afraid I came across something which I can't really write a credible thesis about, so I’ve decided to ask you all what to make of it.

I wouldn’t want to waste your time any longer, so I’ll be brief: during my time in Vardø, I came across an unsent letter written by one of my distant ancestors in 1807, during the waning years of the Denmark-Norway political union. The information given in this account has not been supported by any other secondary or primary source, because of which I can’t exactly publish this as a university paper. So, after some translating and tidying up, here it is.

November 25th, 1807

As I write this today, I am still unsure who to address this letter to. It was the suggestion of our town priest, Father Isberg, who instructed me to make a record of these recent incidents after I told him so in confession. I hope this letter shall one day find its way to one of the officials of the court, or to an officer of the Royal armed forces or national guard, so as to finally launch an investigation into the events which transpired in our town. 

Some introduction may be necessary for the reader. My name is Abraham Greseth, and I have lived in Vardø for my entire life. Our town is far to the north, and at the edge of the world, most of the world’s events do not bother us. The war in Europe and the attack on Copenhagen at most got tongues wagging, but neither affected us in any serious way. I myself, during the summer months ply my trade as a fisherman, combing the seas of the north. During the winter months however, I am the keeper of the Vardø lighthouse. 

In his sermons, Father Isberg repeatedly has said that our town is at the edge of the world. As one of the northernmost towns of Europe, and perhaps even the world, he has said beyond our islets, beyond the frigid seas of the north, lies a dimension barren of god and goodness. My own father, the previous keeper of the lighthouse, told me when I was but a boy that during the dark winter nights, in the absence of the midnight sun, it is our light that keeps those horrors at bay, and it is the duty of the keeper to ensure no such demon should creep its way into the land of man. I view the role of keeper with a sacred disposition, and for long I have kept watch over these frigid waters in the darkest of nights.

It was one of those nights of pitch darkness, that he showed up at my doorstep. I was manning the lighthouse as usual, cranking the clockwork that kept the mirrorset turning, at around some hours past midnight, when I heard a loud thumping noise at the door. Assuming it to be some curious animal, I looked down from above and was surprised to see the faint shape of a man knocking vigorously at the door. I grabbed my coat and made my way down to the door to open it and let him in, for my first thought was this fellow must have walked a long distance to get here, having crossed the high piles of snow that separated the lighthouse from the town itself, and he must be thoroughly exhausted from doing so. I opened the door to be greeted by a man dressed in a grey greatcoat. I could see traces of a red uniform underneath the coat, and he wore a tall shako that was covered in snow. A thick scarf remained wrapped around his neck, covering his face up to the top of his nose. 

He seemed to be a soldier, for we have quite a few soldiers in Vardø, mostly stationed in the star fortress they call Vardohus fortress. I myself have been to the fortress several times, going at least twice a month for a quick chess match with its commanding officer, Captain Stahle. We knew most of the soldiers there by face, but I could not recognize this fellow due to the scarf. It was however a time of war, and soldiers were frequently being rotated into and out of the fortress, so I did not think much of it. 

 

He seemed as though he was about to collapse on the doorframe itself, so I ushered him into my quarters, which is a walking distance from the lighthouse. As I lay him on the bed, he closed his eyes and fell unconscious. I inspected his body to be sure of no physical injuries, and I found to my horror that his thumb, forefinger, and ring finger of his right hand had been torn off, with blood still clinging to the stumps. As I bandaged his hand, I tried to remove his headgear to check for any head injuries, only to find it wouldn’t budge. I sat dumbfounded, as I tried to find the buckle for the chinstrap, only to realise it had none. The chinstrap had been fused to the man’s chin, as if it was part of his body. Dumbfounded, I tried to remove his scarf, only to find that it too could not be moved. Not knowing what to do, I decided to leave the man there, and return to my duties in the lighthouse. Locking the door as I left my quarters, I couldn’t help but think about what had just shown up at my doorstep. What was it this man had gone through?

That morning, I returned to find the man had woken up, and removed his scarf and headpiece. At the moment I was confused, and wondered how he could so easily remove his headpiece when I had tried to do so the previous night, but I chalked it up to late night hallucinations. I could now see this soldier was a young boy, barely into his twenties. Locks of brown hair fell across his face.  The man did not speak, but merely looked in my direction as I hung up my coat. 

“You sure do bring up a lot of questions my lad, but you may rest here until you are healthy enough to return to your post.”, I said as I sat in front of the dressing table. I could see him staring at me through the mirror, his beady black eyes focussed on my face. Looking in the mirror, I could see my own hair was messy and dishevelled, much like his was, so I combed it, all the while keeping an eye on him through the mirror. 

He seemed too weak to move, and blankly stared at me through the mirror as I combed my hair. It was as though his gaze was noting down every detail of my face. I checked my teeth, before getting up to prepare breakfast, all the while my guest lay frozen in my bed. While cooking, I thought how strange it was, that despite having walked all that distance from the fort, through piles of dense snow while wind whipped in his face, the soldier was not even shivering, not even showing the faintest sign of being affected by the cold. 

Upon returning from my routine fishing trip, I prepared a bowl of soup, and poured some for the man and myself. For some time, we sipped in silence, until at last, he spoke up. 

“It crossed from hell itself.”

It was my turn to stare blankly at my guest, as his opening words left me dumbfounded. He stared blankly into the soup, spinning his spoon inside without taking a single sip. My curious expression must have compelled him to share more.

“We were supposed to leave this wretched island. They told us that Copenhagen had been attacked, that the entire army of Denmark and Norway was being gathered at the dannevirke, in preparation for an invasion. Our captain told us to prepare the cannons for transport, that soon we would leave Vardø, and a messenger would come to alert us once the transfer ship arrived. Two days ago, the sentry spotted a man coming on foot towards the gates and sounded the bell. The captain assumed it was the messenger, so he told us to lay down our arms, and open the gate.”

“I still don’t understand what happened next. I glimpsed the man just as he entered. He seemed normal at first, then his eyes suddenly turned black, and his mouth opened up like a bear. He let loose a scream that sounded like the wind howling during the blizzard, and his limbs began to grow, like branches from a tree. Its mouth expanded, revealing a hollow emptiness inside of it, it was missing its teeth. I remember the captain’s face lost all colour, as his shivering hand raised his sword, then boom, with one lightning fast stroke of his arm, the creature had sliced off his head, and a thick red fountain erupted from his neck, tainting the snow around him.”

My legs shook as he spoke. The bowl made a continuous ringing sound as my spoon shivered against its wall. It was clear, this captain he was referring to was my own good friend, Captain Stahle. My legs shook, as I could only imagine the fate my friend had suffered, his terrified expression as he lifted his sabre, scared shitless, facing this abomination from hell. I couldn't help but think that as the lighthouse keeper, I had failed in my duty. I had unknowingly allowed a monstrosity from beyond the rays of the light to enter the earth, and my friend had already paid for my mistake. The man went on:

“It was then the rest of us overwhelmed our own shock, and formed ranks around the monster, as we were trained to do so. One man fired his musket, and so did we, but even the fire from 21 men was not enough to pacify this beast. The balls embedded themselves in the creature's skin, causing holes but drawing no blood. It wailed, like the banshee of the celts, and pushed its arm into one man’s mouth, impaling him as though he was on a stake. “

“I dropped my musket and I ran. I ran like there was no tomorrow. I ran despite the dying screams of my fellows. I ran despite the horrendous wail the creature let loose, that resonated within my legs, and ran sweat down my neck. I pushed and pushed, on and on and I saw the light you shine every night, and made my way here.”

“I really ask you to board me on the next naval ship to arrive in the area, I must report to the nearest officer about this tale. This creature cannot be allowed to live, else it will ravage through norge, and desecrate our people. Please, you must help me sir.”

I realised then that this was the only way to atone for my lapse in judgement. I thought I must fix my mistake that allowed this abomination into our realm, and helping him was the least I could have done. So that night, as I worked the clockwork of the lighthouse, I rang the emergency bell, hoping that a nearby vessel would hear it and respond. It took some time, but eventually I heard a resounding ring from far away, and glimpsed a small light moving on the sea.

As the stranger and I waited on the docks, the cold air warped around my face. Snow brushed past my eyes as I waited there, with this man, who had now put on his full uniform, with his scarf on. We waited for what seemed like hours, until at last, a Danish naval ship pulled into view. It weighed anchor some distance from the port, and a rowboat came to the docks. The sailor introduced his ship as the “Prinds Christian Frederik”, and he took the soldier with him back to the rowboat. 

As he left, the soldier looked back at me, and smiled, revealing his teeth. There was something unsettling about his teeth, they seemed longer across than they were down, and were smudged into his mouth like a child fixing a jigsaw puzzle. I smiled blankly at him, unsure of what to make of this, and waved goodbye. He waved back with his right hand, and the boat pulled away. It was after he left, that I realised his right hand had all of his fingers attached.

I stayed at home for a few days. I grieved over Captain Stahle, and what that poor man had done to deserve his punishment. I wallowed in guilt over the garrison of the fort, each man of which had probably suffered terrible, horrific deaths. I blamed myself, for I had allowed the demon to cross from the frontiers of the edge of the earth, that I was not alert enough to notice, and not brave enough to face it head on. It was some time before I convinced myself to head to the church to talk to Father Isberg, and make sense of what I had heard. 

As I walked through town, I faintly heard the town crier shout the latest headlines over a crowd. It was the usual news about napoleon, england, and the situation in Europe, but one statement caught me off guard:

“The good ship, Prinds Christian Frederik, has been lost at sea with all hands. All able bodied citizens with a boat are requested to report to the district magistrate to be organised into search parties”

As I entered the chapel, Father Isberg gave me a frightful article of news. “Did you hear about the fort garrison? We found all 22 men butchered horrifically, torn apart limb to limb. I did the last rites myself, the scene was horrendous.”

I asked him the details of which, and he told me that most of them were barely recognizable, their faces mutilated to such an extent that many could not be recognized. 

“But the worst of them all was the Captain. We could make him out due to his uniform, and I truly do pity what he went through in the end. I pray to the lord daily to ensure him his rightful place in heaven.”

He paused, contemplating how to break the news to me, before saying,

“His mouth. Every single tooth was ripped from his mouth before he died.”
