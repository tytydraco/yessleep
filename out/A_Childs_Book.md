   Hello My Name is, base on my Username Name, Wrenz and I have this small story. Now I actually found this beneath a bridge at our local Park, I found it after I dropped wallet while taking a selfie that I was going to send to my friends. Now this story looked very old, it being tattered, torn, soaked, or missing a few pages. Now I'm gonna Blurred out or not just write down any important stuff like their full name, address, etc. Now there were missing pages or more, I went out looking for them,  I found some few but the rest are gone. There are words i cant uderstand with it being having dirt and dust and that, so ill just add blanks____ to signify words that I cant show becuase it reveals to many stuff about their location and name, or words I cant undertand or bits that are torn.

Title: An Old Comic In The Trash

It was a story about 4 brothers trying to save the world by an evil force, but the 4 of them constantly argues and envied one onother I told my friends about it they were not interested, well some did, it looked unfinished _______, I can tell by some parts where it wasn't colored, and it just ends during the fight scene. I brought it home to finish it, it was dirty so I cleaned it. I was thinking of finishing it, but i realized I have homework to do, so kept it in my drawer.

Title: My crush on Aurora

While I was in class, my teacher introduce to us a new student, her name is Aurora______________. She was a pretty girl, she has some pick tails, I believe is that what they are called. Many didn't care at much, some actually made her they're friend. She isn't really that smart in school, now she isn't the dumbest in our class, but she's not really that smart. Many of the smart student was told by our teacher to help or tutor her, it worked but not that much, her grades got boosted up to 12%. I casually talked to her, never truly expressing my feeling to her, but I'm still 11 and I'm still too young to actually be in a relationship. But that's all I've got to offer.

Log 5-8 were missing, these were pages I couldn't find no Matter I tried but the only thing or word I got from Log 8 was this

Title: Ready the Light

- lights were colorful, shining in our front door, Dad wasn't really the best at making a good looking Christmas Tree, my mom was the_________ one, before she, well I don't want to be reminded but, Rest In Peace. 

"At by this point I only found the first few pages of this "book" that I've found, it ended at Log 9, besides some few missing Logs, but thats far as it could go and this is the only the only pages I could find under the bridge really. Now, before I end this, I want to clarify that I find it interesting that years and years ago, around 2005-2006, a woman took her own life on that same bridge where I found this book. I'll try to find more pages or information about this, and I'll update you. I hope you find this interesting too."
