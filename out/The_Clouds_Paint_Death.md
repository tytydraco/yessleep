“Natures Rorschach Test” is what Ellie would call them. The phenomenon that many young couples experience- those picturesque picnic dates where you lay back, gaze at the sky, and debate over what each cloud shape could mean. Ellie and I were no different, except we would always try to outdo the other with outlandish ideas in hopes of making the other laugh so hard they’d cry. During our sophomore year of high school, we spent nearly every day of summer at the beach, and without fail, Ellie would always kick off a cloud watching session, as if it were a ritual we couldn’t resist.

One day, near the beginning of  August, we decided to go to the beach for what would be the last time before school began. That morning, I noticed Ellie seemed a little off, at the time I chalked it up to first day-of-school jitters. I decided this time it was my turn to kick off our little cloud ritual, describing the first thing that came to my mind as I peered into the sky.

“I- oh babe I swear to God Mr. Clean is in a fist fight with a dinosaur up there, you gotta look!”

I managed to get a little smirk out of her as she raised her eyes to the sky narrowing in on whatever cloud that artistically spoke to her the most. Her smirk slowly faded, giving way to an expression of discomfort as her eyes scanned the sky. She broke the silence a few seconds later-

“The clouds paint death.”

"What, Ell-?" I started to question, but she sighed and turned her gaze back on me.

"What time are you picking me up tomorrow for school?" she asked, shifting the subject.

“Uh probably 7:20… everything alright?”

She gave a small nod and a smile, reassuring me that everything was fine, but those words, "The clouds paint death" still lingered in my mind. They lingered with me that night as I watched lightning dance through clouds off the coastline. They lingered a couple weeks later when Ellie was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. They lingered two months later, when her body was lowered into the earth. On the day of the funeral, I remember looking up to a clear blue sky, not a cloud in sight- like some sick cosmic joke.

It took a few years, but eventually, I started to see exactly what I think Ellie saw in the clouds that day. I wasn’t actively looking for it, but one day, as I was walking to my university classes, my eye was caught by a peculiar shape in the sky. A cloud that once would’ve sparked an outlandish joke now took a more sinister form in my mind. I saw what looked like a bus… a bus with its front tire crushing the head of a figure beneath it, the shape hauntingly clear against the otherwise blank sky.

I brushed it off and continued my 15-minute walk to my first class of the day, only to stop abruptly at an intersection as I nearly collided with a biker who shot past me in the bike lane. I watched as the biker carried down past the second intersection where the next pedestrian was not as quick to react, sending the biker over the front of his bike and onto the busy road. He probably didn’t have a second to process what happened before an oncoming university bus painted the asphalt with his brains. The red-stained road acted as a grim stage, mirroring the scene painted above in the clouds.

It wasn’t just people in my vicinity either, years after the bus incident I had the misfortune of looking at the sky to a bright blue canvas depicting a plane crashing into the sea. 2 days later Flight 180 from Los Angeles never made it to Hawaii, its Blackbox was discovered a week later fished from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.

I don’t know how many more deaths it took but eventually I became permanently glued to the ground, my gaze always fixed below the horizon. Death still happened around me, sure, but I no longer felt like I was playing any part in these poor people’s demise. My therapist suggested I combat my paranoia through writing, hoping that by giving rational form to these scenarios, I might come to realize that the clouds aren’t prophetic.

 I’m typing this post on one of those picturesque days that Ellie and I would have spent hours getting lost in the clouds and each other’s jokes. But as I look up now, I can almost see it again, "the clouds paint death" I just hope it’s not a sign for you.
