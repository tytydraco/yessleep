  

As I'm writing this account I'm hoping that someone, anyone, just reads it and says something. Anything! Just comment hi or fuck you or really anything! I just wanna know that there is someone out there; that there is a sign of life still out there….

Everything was normal before it all went south. I had gone to bed by 1am that night. It was quite ordinary for me to stay up late. I live in an apartment with my parents and my sister. They all go to bed pretty early, around 10ish so I’m the only one who’s awake till late at night. Anyways, I remember waking up at around 3 in the morning. I woke up sleepily and checked my phone for the time hoping it wasn’t 7am already. The time read 3:22. I rejoiced. I dragged my feet as I walked towards the washroom keeping my head hung down. I have to cross my parents’ bedroom door on the way to the bathroom. On my way back I noticed their door was open. Huh. They usually have it closed. Their bed is right in front of the door too. I looked inside and saw their bed was empty. Weird but nothing completely out of the blue. Except I couldn’t find them anywhere in the house. It’s an apartment. I didn’t have to look much. They were nowhere in the house. I felt uneasy. Had something happened? Was there an emergency? And if there was why didn’t they inform me before leaving?

I strode over to my room to wake my sister up hoping she might know something or maybe they had informed her. She sleeps with me. I switched on the light and was about to call out her name when I stopped. Our bed was empty too. It was dark when I had left the room so must not have noticed earlier. She wasn’t there and she was certainly not in the house. Where’d they all go? I got my phone and rang their number. No one picked up. Not one single time did anyone pick up. I had put the phone on loudspeaker and the outgoing ring was the only sound that filled the atmosphere. The entire house was eerily silent. Not even the steady drip of water from the faucet was heard. It’s as if the house was waiting quietly for someone to pick up and tear apart the silence with their voice. But no one picked up. I was getting impatient and angry at this point. How could they just leave in the middle of the night without informing me or picking up my calls?! That was just irresponsible on their part. How bad could this emergency be?! That is if it were an emergency….

So I waited. I was sat on the couch in the living room with my hands crossed across my chest waiting. 30 minutes went by. One hour. Still no calls and no texts. I was genuinely worried. I paced the living room anxiously for the better part of the hours. Did something really bad happen? Are they alright? I just wanted them home. Another hour went by and still no contact with them. It was 5:30 now. The first streaks of light must have strewn across the calm morning sky by now. The pleasant chirping of birds must have started by now. 

Except I didn’t hear any birds. It was as silent as it was at 3.That was weird. I walked over to the balcony door and pulled the curtains aside. Complete darkness greeted me. I opened the door and walked out. It wasn’t the winters. It should have been light by now. The sky should have been of a light blue hue instead of the pitch black void that it was. I couldn’t even see the moon. No stars at all. I panicked. Something very wrong was going on. A part of me felt like I must be asleep and just in the midst of a nightmare. It certainly felt like a dream. The place was a familiar one but not quite the real one. I pinched myself really hard and it hurt. I tried to count the fingers on my hands and to my horror I could see and count them perfectly. Which meant that I was very much awake and this was very much happening.

“what the FUCK”, I whispered. For someone reason I felt scared to break the silence. I didn’t want to speak loudly. When I had accepted that fact, I looked over at the other apartments. The lights were off except for a few lights that the neighbours keep on throughout the night. It was as if they were still sleeping. I peeked over towards the gate of the building complex. I couldn’t see the watchman out sitting on his chair. Could be in his cabin but I was now having a tough time believing that. The streets were empty. Completely empty. 15 minutes went by and not a single vehicle drove across. Something was definitely wrong. I went inside got dressed and stepped out of my house and walked over to my neighbour’s door. I rang the doorbell and waited. Once, twice.  no one came.

No no no!! I hurried over to another door and rang their doorbell once before starting to bang on their door. No response. Dread shrouded me as I climbed the staircase to the upper floor taking two steps at a time. The same process followed. I rang their doorbell and banged on the door and then panicked as I got no response. It was still quiet. More than it normally is. More than I’d like. The silence was deafening. The atmosphere felt thick and static. As if nothing was moving. As if the air particles themselves have stopped moving. 

I slumped by the wall. I couldn’t even fathom what the hell was going on. I wrapped my arms around my head and sat there trying to make sense of what was happening. I took deep breaths in order to calm down and started thinking. I thought about exactly what had happened before I had gone to sleep. I was up late reading stuff on the internet. First it was the cheesy wattpad love stories. Then I had come across creepypastas. Funny how I ended up on that side of the internet. A particular creepypasta had intrigued me. It spoke of a parallel universe. Kind of dystopian. That interested me. I was then up for an hour reading articles on the parallel universe theory and the research that was being done on the topic. Could it be……Nahh that was impossible right. I mean maybe not impossible but not feasible either. Right?

Just then elevator door dinged open. I was startled. What followed sucked the breath right out of my living body and made my heart skip several beats. Just as the doors opened a man ran out of the elevator door screaming followed by what looked like an animal but wasn’t. It was horrendous. The creature had a wolflike face but the body of an ape. It was of a crimson colour and its paws had the sharpest claws I had ever seen. Not that I had seen many. The abomination made a sound that sounded like a metal screech. My entire body convulsed momentarily when I heard that hellish scream. He was apparently chasing the man who looked terrified. His clothes were ripped and blood was dripping from several parts of his body. And then suddenly they were whipped away. Gone. A white chasm had opened mid air and engulfed them away. Just like that and silence reigned once again. Where the chasm had opened, there were blur streaks of line like a glitch in a computer screen would look like. 

I was trembling at this point. I got up shakily and walked down to my floor. My legs were jelly and it was near impossible to climb down the stairs without the support of the railing. 

I went in my house and tried to sleep hoping it would all be normal when I wake up. The thing is I can’t sleep. Go figure. So here I am typing this all out. Hoping someone knows something and can explain. Or at the very least, there is someone out there… 

I’ll update more if I can.
