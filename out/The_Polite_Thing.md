The first time it happened, one would have thought it was probably just a coincidence.

But when people went missing all the time—not dramatically, not with sirens or any crime scene tape—they simply just… stopped being there.

In apartment 6B across from mine lived Mr. Kendricks, who mostly worked night shifts as a cab driver. One week he was there, and the next he wasn’t. His belongings sat untouched inside, his car still parked in the garage. But the man himself had simply vanished.

The apartments emptied quietly. Names vanished from the intercom. Mailboxes overflowed until the superintendent taped them shut, leaving them that way until another new tenant eventually took the place.

You learned not to ask.

At least, that is the way I saw it when I stepped into the building for the first time a few weeks back, looking for a place to stay—somewhere cheap, quiet, and unconcerned with questions.

I live on the sixth floor of this narrow apartment block, built sometime in the late ’80s.

The hallways are long and under-lit, with that faint, institutional smell of cleaning fluid failing to cover something older. It is the kind of place where people nod at each other, exchange pleasantries, then disappear behind doors and never knock on anyone else’s again.

I remember vividly the very first time I set foot inside the building. A strange odor drifted through the air without warning, slipping into my nostrils and raising the hair along my arms all at once.

It never entirely went away. Any time I lingered in the hallway longer than necessary—fumbling for keys, juggling groceries, checking the mail, or half-listening on the phone—it would seep into the air from nowhere. I would withdraw at once, slipping back inside and locking the door without quite knowing why.

But the strangest thing about this place, though… was that… everyone here is polite. And I see it materialize daily in real time.

That should have been the first warning sign, though I didn’t know it yet.

Mrs. D’Souza recently moved into 6B, the very apartment abruptly vacated by Kendricks. Being an old widow, she usually kept to herself, though she liked to take solitary walks along the corridor every day. But within a week of coming here, she began to greet everyone with the same phrase every morning.

“Good morning, dear. Hope you’re doing well.”

She always said it with a smile too wide for her small face. Always the same words. Always in the same spot near the stairs.

The next was Mr. Collins from 6A, another recent tenant. Always hustling and in a hurry to get to work. He only ever slowed down if he was on a business call—and even then, it was because the cell reception was spotty in the building.

Being who he was, he would often rush into the elevator ahead of others, closing the doors quickly if it meant arriving sooner. But he too eventually changed, to the point that he now held the elevator door for people, even when it meant missing it himself. He would also apologize if someone else bumped into him.

I noticed the pattern slowly, the way your brain resists connecting dots that form something impossible.

The missing people weren’t random.

They were polite. In fact, painfully so—polite to the point where it made you uncomfortable, like they were following rules only they could hear.

But the more I thought about it, I gathered that almost everybody I recognized in the building more or less behaved the same way.

However, I only realized something was truly wrong the night I almost died.

I’d stayed late at work and missed the last bus. By the time I walked back home, rain had begun to pour, and it was nearly eleven when I reached the building.

Inside, it was quiet, like it usually is—only the faint bleed of televisions through the walls, the low hum of fluorescent lights, an occasional distant cough, while the rain continued to batter outside.

The elevator wasn’t working—again—so I took the stairs.

That’s when I heard the voice.

“Excuse me.”

It came from behind me, halfway down the stairwell. Soft. Apologetic. Almost embarrassed.

I turned.

A man stood there, short and heavy, his silhouette almost wholly swallowed by shadow. I couldn’t make out his face, but I could tell he was smiling. You can hear a smile sometimes, even when you can’t see it.

“I’m sorry to bother you,” he said, stepping up one stair. “But could you tell me which floor this is?”

Something about the way he spoke made my skin prickle. Every word was carefully enunciated, like he was reading from a written script.

“It’s the fourth,” I said automatically. “Sorry, the lights—”

“Thank you so much,” he interrupted. “You’re very kind.”

Another step closer.

The air felt heavier, and then I immediately sensed it, that odour suddenly wafting through the air.

 “That’s very polite of you,” he continued. “People aren’t always polite anymore.”

I laughed nervously. “Yeah, well. You know how it is,” I replied—and as I spoke, I pulled in a lungful of the smell.

It surged upward, blooming behind my eyes. My vision wavered for a moment, slipping in and out of focus, the hair along my arms rising, as a slight tightness began to seize my chest.

I instinctively took a step upward.

So did he.

He tilted his head. His face slid briefly into the light, and I saw too much teeth. Not sharp- just too many, packed closely together, stretching further back than a human mouth should.

“You don’t have to be scared,” he said gently. “I appreciate good manners, Mr. Webb.”

My stomach dropped at the sound of my name.

“How do you—” I stopped myself.

“I know the names of everyone who lives here,” he said. “It would be rude not to, wouldn’t it?”

His smile widened.

“But I’d like to know you better, Mr. Webb. I’ve been waiting to meet you ever since.”

He extended his hand. In the dim light, it seemed to lengthen toward me, and as it did, he climbed another step.

I stepped back instead. The smell surged—stronger than ever—flooding my lungs, settling deep in my chest. My heart began to pound uneasily that it hurt.

“Oh,” he added softly, stopping for the first time. “You’re allowed to refuse once.”

His smile stretched wider.

“After that, it becomes impolite.”

He extended his hand again—and took another step closer.

I tried to knock his hand away, but he moved in quickly to clasp his fingers around mine, using both his hands in a vice-like grip.

A wave of nausea slammed into me as the lights overhead began to flicker violently, stuttering in rapid bursts.

Pain ripped through my arm and spread outward, my nerves lighting up all at once. Every cell in my body felt like it was burning, as though something had reached inside me and struck a match.

My heart went feral, slamming against my ribs so hard it stole my breath, until my legs gave out beneath me. I dropped to my knees, gasping, my vision tunnelling.

“I knew there was something odd about you the moment you arrived, boy,” he whispered, his breath warm, his voice trembling with anticipation. “Let’s crack it open and see what it is, shall we?”

And then the lights went out, leaving the stairwell in complete darkness- the pin-drop silence broken only by the steady patter of rain, now growing more and more distant with each passing second.

*‘Obey, Mr. Webb. Yield. Be polite and just nod, and this will be over soon. I promise.’*

The words didn’t come from outside me anymore. They pressed in from within.

And the darkness suddenly peeled open like a wound.

Beneath it lay a corridor I hadn’t seen in years—long, narrow, smelling of old wood and damp stone. An orphanage. Cold tiles bit into my skin as I saw a twelve-year-old boy crumpled on the floor, stripped to his underwear, arms wrapped around himself, shaking. His face was streaked with tears, his eyes fixed upward in mute terror.

A large figure loomed over him.

The belt came down.

The sound cracked through the corridor—and through me. The boy flinched, bracing before the pain even landed, already knowing what came next. Somewhere down the hall, other children watched from their doorways, their whispers turning into nervous giggles.

The shame burned hotter than the pain as I watched the warden pace casually back and forth, belt in hand, cracking it like a whip every few steps.

The warden lunged again, the belt arcing toward him—but this time the boy caught it. His small hands locked around the leather, knuckles whitening as the warden shouted and yanked, promising worse. The boy didn’t cry. Didn’t look away. His tears had stopped; his gaze hadn’t. He held on, perfectly still, defiant.

And then the stairwell slammed back into place.

The darkness. The smell. My knees on concrete. His hands were still clasped around mine—warm, tight—as if he’d felt it too.

“Not bad, Mr. Webb. Not bad at all. Got a little spunk in you, after all,” he said.

Then, softer: “But you can’t leave me hanging halfway, can you now?”

He leaned in, his grip tightening. “It would be terribly rude to quit at this juncture—especially when things are just starting to get interesting. Don’t you think?”

The nausea hit all at once. My heart battered against my ribs, each beat louder than the last.

My head felt like it would split open as I fought hard to keep control.

“*Yield,*” the voice hissed inside my skull, soft but everywhere at once. “*Give up, young man. Stop struggling. Let me in.”*

I fought to keep control, clinging to myself as the thing pressed harder, probing, prying, trying to slip past thought and memory alike. My heart hammered so violently it felt swollen, wrong—each beat threatening to burst my chest open.

“This is the moment,” he murmured, his voice warm against my ear. “In a polite world, consent is everything. In fact it is the only rule that matters, Mr. Webb. Yield, and it will stop hurting. Yield, and I will bring you peace like you have never known.”

My vision tunneled. Darkness crept in at the edges. I understood, with a cold certainty, that I was reaching the end of what my body could endure—that I would either collapse dead on the stairs or be forced to give in.

Then out of nowhere a thunder came.

It tore through the building like a gunshot, close enough to rattle concrete.

The grip vanished instantly. A flash of lightning flooded the stairwell, and in that brief, violent light I saw the thing recoil, hands flying up to its head, its face twisted in raw, animal terror.

Then another thunderclap followed— more brutal and louder than the last one—shaking the walls. He staggered, clutching at his ears as if the sound were tearing straight through him, his form flickering and unraveling, screaming without sound.

And then he was gone.

I collapsed against the steps, gasping, the smell finally fading, the rain still pouring outside as if nothing had happened at all.

I dragged myself up two flights of stairs, barely made it to my room, and passed out on the floor.

When I awoke the next morning it felt as though sleep had never come. My body felt leaden, my thoughts sluggish, and when I looked down at my hand, my stomach clenched. The center of my palm had darkened overnight, stained a deep, bruised hue, as though something had pressed into my skin and sunk beneath it.

But my first instinct was flight. Leave. Pack what little I could and put as much distance between myself and the building as possible. Every nerve screamed that this place was dangerous. But the urge faded almost as soon as it surfaced, replaced by something quieter, heavier—a stubborn resolve to see it through.

So I returned to my routine while keeping a watchful eye. I kept my head down, my steps quick, my presence minimal. Still, something had changed.

The politeness was gone. And this was directed exclusively at me.

Mrs D’Souza who smiled and nodded at everyone, would now shut the door the moment she saw me. Others did the same—turning away, stepping aside, behaving as though the space I occupied was empty. Even Mr. Collins avoided my eyes, slipping into the lift and closing it before I could reach it. By week’s end, he even shoved me aside as I tried to enter.

This was all his doing, alright.

He'd been slithering around, whispering in their ears. Normally, the introvert in me would have simply shrugged this off - but this was different. This raised the stakes.

The entire building had turned against me, quietly and deliberately. And for someone who survives on keeping a low profile, I was garnering unnecessary attention my way.

But one thing was certain. I knew I was foremost on his mind now, and it was only a matter of time before he made another go at me.

Sure enough, the following day, a letter waited beneath my door. I opened it and began reading.

 

Dear Mr. Webb,

I hope this finds you well and rested.

I must begin by apologizing for how our last encounter ended. Leaving so abruptly was unbecoming of me and, upon reflection, rather rude. It is difficult to admit, but I must confess the incident has left me deeply embarrassed.

I was genuinely enjoying our conversation—having the opportunity to enquire after you and to get to know you better—until an unexpected intrusion disrupted matters.

That was never my wish.

First impressions matter a great deal, and I fear I allowed mine to be… inelegant.

If you would permit it, I would very much like the opportunity to make amends.

Perhaps we might share a cup of tea and a quiet conversation?

I find such rituals help smooth over misunderstandings. You would be most welcome at my place, should you feel comfortable enough to visit.

That said, I understand if you feel hesitant.

If the familiarity of your own surroundings offers greater comfort, I would be more than willing to come to you instead—but only with your consent, of course. I would never impose without a proper invitation.

If neither option suits you, I understand entirely; fate may yet align our paths another day. Timing is everything, after all.

Should you wish to respond, simply write your decision on this letter and push it beneath your door.

Until then, I wish you calm thoughts and steady hands.

Yours sincerely,

**Mr. A.J. Polite**

 

I wrote back, accepting his invitation, and received a reply within hours outlining the details of our meeting.

A couple of days later, around 11 p.m., I headed to the elevator and pressed **B**, on my way to the basement for tea with Mr. Polite. The doors parted, revealing the building's underbelly—my first time down here since moving in.

The basement was dim and cavernous, washed in the dull glow of fluorescent lights. Pipes snaked along the ceiling like exposed veins, slipping into unseen corners. The concrete was slick with moisture, and the air tasted of metal, mildew, and old leaks – and of course him.

My attention immediately snapped to a corner at the soft whistle of a kettle.

There, Mr. Polite had set up his space: a small hearth with a fireplace, a narrow pantry, a single cot, a compact stove with the kettle boiling, and an ancient oven that seemed far older than the building itself.

At the center of it all stood Mr. Polite, beaming, apron tied neatly around his waist, oven mitts in hand.

“Welcome to my humble abode, Mr. Webb. I’m genuinely glad you could come… though I confess, a part of me wasn’t entirely sure you would.” Mr. Polite bowed gently as I approached.

His eyes immediately flicked to the package in my hands. “Is that for me?” he asked, holding a mittened hand to his chest.

I nodded and handed over the neatly wrapped package. He accepted it graciously with both hands.

“A small token of thanks for your kind invitation,” I said. “I thought it would be… impolite to arrive empty-handed.”

Polite laughed softly, “Nonsense, Mr. Webb! No one would think it rude. But I do appreciate your thoughtfulness all the same.”

As he places it on a side stand, a mischievous curiosity lit his eyes. “Shall I open it now?” he asked.

“Only after I leave,” I replied. He inclined his head in acknowledgement.

“Very well,” he said. “Please, make yourself comfortable.”

He gestured to the table set for two, the chair at the center gleaming after meticulous cleaning.

“Sit, relax. Tea is ready, and there are some freshly baked scones turning golden in the oven.”

Mr. Polite gently set the plate of scones on the table and poured two steaming cups of tea—one for each of us—before settling into the chair across from me.

This was the first time I got a clear look at him, and he was uglier than I had imagined. His proportions were wrong: a frog-like head atop a penguin’s bulk, with thin strands of hair stretched over his bald crown.

Yet it was the odor that truly repelled me— like old cloth soaked in time and left to dry in a place without light.

As we drank, he chatted easily about inconsequential things: how he'd come to live here, his daily habits, the slow changes time wrought on the building.

I mostly listened, saying little.

Each time I lifted my cup, I noticed his eyes flick briefly to my palm, where the bruising still lingered even after a week. His voice grew livelier as he steered the conversation toward the building’s residents: Mrs. D’Souza, Mr. Collins, and the others.

He spoke of their troubles—their private pains and the ordinary cruelties of daily life—and of how, in his own quiet way, he had eased their burdens, earning their devotion in return. He even suggested he could do the same for me. *It would benefit you in the long run,* he hinted, while I merely nodded in acknowledgment.

A few minutes later, it was time to leave.

Mr. Polite rose, signalling the end with measured courtesy, and extended his hand in a formal shake.

I returned his handshake, and for the first time, nothing untoward happened.

No beads of sweat formed on my brow, my heart continued to beat steadily, and the nausea – the oppressive clinging odor hadn’t yet over taken my senses. My head didn’t feel like it was splitting open and I felt reasonably fine.

A flash of confusion crossed Mr. Polite’s face. Instinctively, he locked both hands around my palm. He lingered there, staring down at my bruised skin, brow furrowing as if trying to look for some hidden reason.

After a moment that stretched far too long, he reluctantly released my hand, smile straining to hold as his mind raced visibly, scrambling to make sense.

Mr. Polite took a small, unconscious step back. Both our gazes drifted to the package on the side stand. His body stiffened for a brief moment of caution—then, just as quickly, his composure returned.

The smile came back in full measure as he turned toward me.

“Mr Webb, I know you suggested I wait until later,” he said, nodding toward the package, “but I find my curiosity has gotten the better of me. Would you mind?”

“Sure,” I replied. “Go ahead.”

Mr. Polite picked up the package. Before opening it, he paused, eyeing it intently. He slipped a hand into his pocket, retrieved earplugs, and wedged them into both ears—all while never once glancing my way.

But as the paper came away, he recoiled. The package hit the floor, its contents spilling out.

 “What *is* this?” he demanded, shocked.

“A human heart,” I said. “Taken from Mr Collins.”

Polite's face drained of color, those frog-eyes bulging wider. He clawed at the plugs, yanking them free as if burned.

“What have you *done*?” he rasped, voice cracking for the first time from its polite veneer.

The heart glistened even under the dim fluorescent lights, small droplets of blood slowly spotting the floor.

“Mr Collins left you a message” , I said as I tossed a key fob at him. “Go ahead press it.”

He hesitated—then pressed the fob.

Click!

For a brief moment nothing happened. Then the faint sound of rain seeped into the basement, growing louder with every passing second. His gaze immediately snapped to the severed heart on the floor- and it began to twitch, slowly at first, throbbing, and then rising and falling as if something clawed to escape from within.

As he leaned closer, the rain’s roar intensified. Fissures quickly spread across the heart’s surface, and with a sudden, deafening clap of thunder, a black metallic sphere covered in tiny spikes shot out, rolling across the floor.

Mr Polite jumped, crashing down beside it, clutching his ears. He scrambled for the fallen earplugs, jamming them back in—but they were useless.

Every bounce sent sharp, thunderous sound waves reverberating through the basement. He staggered to his feet and chased after the ball as it ricocheted wildly across the floor, never fully settling. Each time it slowed, another explosive crack burst from its core, launching it back into motion.

With each thunderous burst, it shed its outer layer like a snake’s skin, steadily shrinking in size while amplifying the roar that bounced off the walls.

Polite desperately lunged at it and finally managed to catch it, but it detonated in his hands, blistering his skin before skittering free once more.

He collapsed to the floor, writhing and clutching his ears in agony. For a brief moment, his eyes met mine as I sat in the chair, watching, while the ball shrieked its final waves before he passed out.

When Polite finally woke up, he realized he was in my apartment. His hands and legs were cuffed to the table, his mouth gagged. His eyes bulged in panic the moment they found me.

He thrashed uselessly, muffled grunts spilling out as I stepped closer and set my kit down in front of him.

I unzipped it slowly and spread some of its contents across the table: a hammer, a surgical scalpel, a bone saw, a handheld power drill, and an old black leather belt, all laid out with deliberate care.

I took a shallow bowl filled with a purple solution and submerged both my hands. The skin-tight gloves I wore began to loosen, the material puckering and peeling as though the solution rejected them. I worked them off with care, fingertip by fingertip, until they finally slipped free.

I dried my hands with a cloth and finally looked up at him.

“So Mr Polite,” I said. “Any final wishes?”

He thrashed against the restraints, shaking his head in frantic denial, muffled sounds forcing their way past the gag.

“Don’t be silly,” I replied.

I picked up the old, weathered belt and stepped closer to him. In one practiced motion, I looped it around his neck and drew it tight, winding the leather around my palm until his head was fixed firmly in place. I then gently climbed aboard the table, placing my knee on his neck, and then with my outstretched hand I leaned forward to meet his open palm.

**A young boy stands alone by the lakeside at night. Lost in thought, he stares at the moonlit water, a severed head dangling from his hand. He tosses it into the lake before slowly making his way back home.**
