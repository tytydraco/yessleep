I’ve lived in the mountainous region of southern West Virginia my entire life, my family lived in a tiny town about 45 minutes south of Charleston by the name of Whitesville. (we no longer live there, and yes I’m aware of the famous family that lives there) Every year right at the change of the seasons my grandmother would have me go with her to take offerings to invisible creatures she’s only explained to me as sprites. I’ve only seen them once and now that I have, I wouldn’t refer to them with a name that has such a kind connotation. The winter of 1998 was particularly bad early on, my grandmother had issues with her knees and was unable to take the offering due to our recent snowfall. 

Since the timing of the offerings were so important she insisted that I did it myself, at the time it wasn’t a big deal since these loaves of bread and sweets that she had left would always sit there for a few days before getting taken by what I assumed were animals. I found out very quickly my assumption was wrong and I wish I had taken it more seriously to this day. I grabbed the bread and homemade sweets and headed for our three spots, one was at the mouth of a creek. The second spot was an opening used by deer and other animals in the tree line of a small forest near us, and the final spot was at the base of a mountain at the edge of town. I walked to the creek first then the forest and placed the offerings, but it was getting cold and dark so instead of walking to the mountain’s offering location I hopped in my side by side and rode it there. Even after my grandma specifically told me to walk.

I got out of the vehicle and walked the 50 or so feet to the offering plate and glanced up the mountain as I set down the food. When I looked up I saw my grandma standing on a cliff facing away from me speaking softly to something in her hands. I called out to her and she didn’t move so assuming she hadn’t heard me I hiked up the small but steep trail to get to her. I continued to call out to her as I hiked but never got an answer, finally I reach the cliff edge she was on and touched her shoulder to get her attention. As soon as my finger touched her I noticed that all of the noises around us stopped. The wind stoped blowing, the birds stoped, the snow was no longer crunching under my feet. The snow wasn’t even cold any more, before I could realize what was happening i say

“What are you doing out here”

She continued to mutter at something in her hands that I couldn’t quite see, I tried to speak again but the sound was muffled like hearing my own voice coming from a separate room. I tried to turn her around but she didn’t budge, it was like trying to turn a stone pillar. Just as cold too, there was no warmth to her. I tried to speak again and no sound came out at all, suddenly the birds all started to caw at once. A gust of wind nearly knocked me down and the snow was colder than ever, it felt like snow had seeped in through my boots to hug my feet. I hear a voice come from all directions, it sounded like her but wasn’t. A combination of the gusts of wind and the chirping birds created a noise that sounded like her saying the sentence

“You broke the pact”

I freaked out, I ran back down the trail as fast as I could. I jumped into the side by side and looked to the cliff side where that thing that looked like her stood. It was now facing me and I could finally see it was holding a small pool of blood and a still beating heart  in its hands. I looked up to where its face should’ve been and to my horror saw a constantly shifting mass of rock and gravel folding into itself. There was another powerful gust of wind that I was forced to shield my face from by looking down, a few seconds later I looked back up and she was running at me on all fours. I stepped on the gas and hauled ass back to the house, I had no idea what to do but I knew my grandmother would. I looked back checking occasionally to make sure that thing was no longer following me and saw that I was finally in the clear just before I pulled up to our front door. I ran inside to ask her what to do, but she was nowhere to be found. A fresh still steaming cup of coffee was on the end table next to her chair and her shoes were still by the door. We never found her, and I never saw that “sprite” again. A few days later I packed a bag and stayed with a friend up north near the Ripley area, I’ve never set foot in that particular holler since and never will.
