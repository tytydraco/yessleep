*Note: This sequel is from another perspective*

Hello Reddit, I'm sure y'all have heard about the legend of The Unicorn in Cedar Grove, to the point where tourists are flocking here to try and find it. I'm here to tell you, don't do it. Do not go looking for the unicorn!

So about a month ago, there was a string of murders around the Forest Reserve, and a Sheriff's Deputy claimed that a unicorn was responsible. He posted everything he knew on this site.

However, weeks went by without any murders, until not too long ago, when a man at Essex County Hospital was murdered by a "strange horse-like creature," according to a Doctor on the scene. The Hospital was closed down, and one of the doctors posted what had happened on this site.

After that, government men came into town and more and more murders have been popping up, further and further away from The Forest Reserve.

I am a Wildlife Expert, and from what I learned, the creature only attacks if it's seen, and it just wants to be left alone. However, if it's venturing outside of its established habitat, the Forest Reserve, I theorize that it considers the entire town its habitat, becoming a sort of invasive species, which seems odd since it's just one creature, but recently I've found some disturbing information. There's more coming.

I made a horrible decision to venture into the forest reserve and look for the beast, but I found an unusual cave in the northernmost area of the woods. Inside, a circle on the ground made from sticks, stones, and a sparkly red liquid. In the center, a small piece of human flesh.

As I investigated the crudely manufactured thing, I heard large clomping footsteps enter the cave, prompting me to hide.

The creature sounded as if it entered the cave and dropped a small piece of flesh beside the other flesh in the circle. I only got a glimpse of the majestic mule before I shut my eyes and cowered behind a rock.

I heard a sound I could only describe as magic, then the crying of what sounded like a baby pig, or a horse.

I ran out of there as fast as I could and drove straight home. I hid in my basement for hours, waiting for that unicorn or whatever to find me. It never came, hopefully, because I never really saw it, just a glimpse. However, if it's venturing outside the forest and going after people who saw it, then it could be coming after me.

Tomorrow, I'm leaving Cedar Grove. I think the unicorn is expanding outside the forest to establish territory for others coming. If anyone is reading this, stay away from Cedar Grove. No one knows how to kill the unicorn or unicorns, so we can only run. And-

Oh god, I hear something outside. I don't have a lot of time. Just stay away from Cedar Grove ooo h6mknjmubeerhuyh7kfi8ewauykaewioefwauilafweuifwaeuiewfauilefawuiefwauieafwuieaw90q5uklg;rj
