I had an alarm for 4am so I could wake up and take my antibiotic at 4:30. I was advised to take it with food. I don't wanna go out of my room and go downstairs for food so I had a banana cue from last night. After munching the soft insides of it I proceed to take up my medication. Then since it is still early I decided to go back to sleep. I turn off my lights and dive to bed. Fudge. A loud thud. I hit my forehead on the headboard top rail. I knew my vision was affected as I looked into the blinking lights of my router and found it very blurry. I checked my smart watch to confirm it. Damn. I could not read the time. I lay in bed hurting my head thinking how hard adulting is. I fell asleep. 

The last dream I remember was we were on the top of a mountain, outside of a beautiful architecture. The view of the horizon was such a sight to see. Countless stars and it was just so beautiful.  Somebody was like "excuse people, we'll have to shoot for a video". I excuse myself, went to explore and found a snake! That startled me so I hopped as carefully and fast as I could back to where everyone was.

I must have woken up 'cause I'm back on my bed facing in the right direction of the bedside and all I could see is a snake partially standing up from my leg. I froze and realized that must have been the reason for the snake on my dream. I blinked twice to confirm and it really is a snake in the size of an inch in diameter, the back of its head was facing me and there was two yellow dots in it. I tried to move my leg carefully to shoo it away and I'm struggling to do so. I'm struggling to stay fully awake and react rightfully. I think a glitch just happened 'cause I knew I just moved my legs but in a blink of an eye my body is still in the same position as it was. The snake must have moved down. I don't know how much time it took to go down but I can hear the rustling of the litter sand bag as the snake passes into it. I think I've finally won the battle and manage to be awake "awake". I partially rise up from my bed trying to analyze what the F just happened. I was hoping it to be a dream. I glanced at the left side of my bed and there my two cats were peacefully sleeping. The snake was nowhere to be seen. I must have been hallucinating. 

Now my cats are awake and Thor, one of my cat, went down to bed to drink water and there was no sign of the snake. 

And then there's me, contemplating things with a very obvious bump on my head.
