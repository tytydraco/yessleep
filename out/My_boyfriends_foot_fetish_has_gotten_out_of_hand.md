When Robby told me that he was into feet, I tried to be understanding. Believe me, I did. But I won’t lie. I always found his attraction to them a bit strange. 

Robby was never an overly sexual man. It wasn’t until three months into our relationship that it even came up. I don’t think he ever intended to tell me. Not with words, at least. I only found out because of what he did in my sleep one night. 

\*\*\*

My eyes shot open, hazy vision dissipating as the darkness of my room gradually grew clearer. In my tired state, my first thought was to roll over and go back to sleep - until I the covers jostled near the foot of the bed. 

My heart jackhammered in my chest as I turned to Robby’s pillow, expecting to find him sound asleep. But that’s not what I saw. Robby’s side of the bed was empty. 

I shot up, my eyes wide as dinner plates. Right as I did, I felt it - a hand caressing my left foot. 

“Robby? What are you doing to my feet?” 

My fear had melted away, and by that point, I was more perplexed than anything. The sheets writhed, and I heard panicked rustling as Robby struggled to fight his way from beneath the covers. 

“Uh… I was asleep?” he offered, his head poking meekly from under the blankets. 

I crossed my arms, despite the smile tugging at the corner of my lips. “Nice try, mister. You’ve got some explaining to do.” 

\*\*\*

And that’s how I found out that my boyfriend is into feet. 

I’d be lying if I said that I didn’t think Robby’s revelation was a little bit odd. Yes, I told him that I didn’t, but I was just trying to be a supportive girlfriend. Even so, I determined that it wasn’t a deal breaker. Robby liked feet? So what? That just meant free foot massages, right? 

Wrong. 

Everything was fine until three nights later. Work had taken its toll on me, and unlike most people my age, instead of hitting the bars, I went to bed early. Robby didn’t join me right away. He’d opted to stay up a bit later watching Transformers. 

As I drifted off to sleep, I thought everything was fine. Little did I know, that night would mark the beginning of a much bigger issue. 

For the second time that week, I awoke suddenly from a deep slumber. But unlike the previous night, I could instantly tell that something was wrong. 

A searing pain jolted through my toes, shooting up my leg. It felt as if someone had jammed my big toe into a hydraulic press. “Ow, what the hell!” I shouted, reflexively kicking out. 

I heard a muffled groan from beneath the blankets. Robby. 

This time, I wasn’t feeling as forgiving about being woken up by my boyfriend playing footsie in the middle of the night. 

“*Robby*,” I growled, turning on the lamp. 

“Yes?” he squeaked, emerging from beneath the covers. He stared at me like a wounded puppy. 

“What has gotten into you? I thought we agreed that you wouldn’t wake me up like this anymore.” 

He couldn’t bring himself to look me in the eye. “I’m sorry. I just… had an itch that I couldn’t ignore. It won’t happen again.” 

“Whatever. We are going to have a *serious* talk about this in the morning.” 

He didn’t even say anything. He just slunk back to his place beside me, more dejected than I’d ever seen him. 

\*\*\*

Robby and I did have that talk the following morning, and he admitted to being in the wrong. He repeatedly assured me that it was a one time thing, and that going forward he’d ask for permission every single time. That helped to put my mind at ease. But even so, my gut told me that something was off. Like Robby was hiding a dirty secret that he didn’t want me to know about. 

The next night we were together, we stayed at his house. When he went to take a shower, I decided to snoop. I didn’t know what Robby was keeping from me, but I was curious to see what I could find.  

Yeah, yeah, I know. I shouldn’t have done that. I’m fully aware that it was an invasion of his privacy, but what I discovered has made all of it feel justified. 

When rummaging through Robby’s bedside drawer, I found what appeared to be a journal. Bingo. That was exactly the kind of thing I needed. I wasn’t expecting much, but when I flipped it open and read the title of the first page, my blood turned to ice. 

*Skinning Skylar. Experiment Log.* 

Surely that didn’t mean what I thought it did. It couldn’t… right? I continued to read. I had to know. 

*5/4/25* 

*I applied only a dollop of the numbing agent tonight. No luck. She caught me in the act. I’ll try again tomorrow if I can.*

5/6/25

*The lick test succeeded. She didn’t notice. Next time I’m going to give her a bite.* 

5/7/25

*I bit down hard on her foot four times tonight. She woke up, but she only felt it in her toes, I think, based on her reaction. I can’t be sure, though. Note - apply more numbing serum next time.* 

I had to pause what I was reading. I nearly vomited all over Robby’s bed. Whatever sick experiment he was running, I wanted no part of it. Though I really didn’t want to, I forced myself to continue, solely to find out how much danger I was in. 

What I read next will haunt me for the rest of my life. 

5/10/25

*Tonight is the night. I’m going to try cutting her foot open with a scalpel. I think I have a good idea of how much of the numbing agent to use now. I’m going to inject her with the heavy stuff too, for good measure. If everything goes smoothly, I’ll be one of the first men to skin a human alive in modern times. I don’t anticipate that she’ll live for more than three hours afterward. I’ll update when I can.* 

“Skylar? Why do you have that?” Robby’s face was white as a ghost. He stood in the doorway, hair still wet. The water dripping onto the tile served as the only sound in the silence that ensued. 

“I… what is this?” 

Robby stomped over to me, panic scrawled across his features. “It’s mine, that’s what it is,” he snapped, snatching the journal from my hands. “How much did you read?” 

I didn’t answer. My brain had already resorted to fight or flight mode. 

I scooped up my phone from the bed and leapt off the other side, darting toward the bathroom. Robby was standing between me and the exit, leaving that as my only option. 

He tried to catch my arm as I passed, but he was too slow. I locked the door behind me, and I instantly heard him pounding on the other side, begging for me to let him explain. 

I didn’t listen. I immediately called the cops. 

The entire time, Robby pleaded with me to come out. He swore up and down that the notebook was just a sick fantasy. That he’d never act on his impulses. 

His words meant nothing to me. I’d seen enough. 

\*\*\*

The police couldn’t do anything. Go figure. Robby would have needed to hurt me for them to take action, and the chances of getting him thrown in the slammer for biting my foot a few nights prior were practically zero. 

So, I did the only thing I could do. I left him, blocked his number and tried to move on with my life the best I could. It wasn’t easy, but after a month, I was starting to heal. 

Until I found the letter on my kitchen counter. 

I was petrified when I saw it lying there. No one else had access to my house - I had the only spare key, and I lived alone. 

With trembling hands, I picked up the note, fear raking at my insides. What was written on that scrap of paper has me terrified for my life. 

*Dearest Skylar,*

*I’ve decided that I need a bit more practice in order to conduct my experiments on a live subject. Your lifeless corpse should do just fine.* 

*I’ll see you* [soon :)](https://www.reddit.com/user/HorrorJunkie123/)
