My parents' home is on the right side of the street with little old but charming family houses and green backyards, I can't be nothing but happy here; and here I am locked in my room with wet, salty cheeks, waiting for my parents to go to bed so I can sneak out, even though I am technically and physically an adult, I don't have to sneak out. I have a heavy, soft spot the size of a fist inside of my chest, I don't know why, maybe it is late and all I need is to clear my head by going for a walk—enter the other side of the street to my one-bedroom, un-isolated apartment that I barely sleep in, barely ever go out to collect the month-old mails from and my one pineapple plant? It's dead. Definitely.

My dad had popcorns, came in and asked me if I wanted some, now the whole house smells like salt and butter. The tv light is shimmering in the living room as I sneak past it. I feel like I can't breathe in here. I feel like I could choke on the fat, unhealthy layers of my thoughts.

I'm in my running shoes, black hoodie and thin cowboy jacket, probably too thin because the evenings tend to be chilly here no matter the season, and for a moment I realize that I look as shady as I act, slowly closing and locking the front door behind me as to not get caught, and I don't know what comes first: being shady or looking the part.

250 meters.

That's the distance from their house to my apartment complex.

250 meters from safety and conformity to the looney part of town. The ghetto and the erratic and unhinged people with tragic pasts who have social workers turning up. Like I used to but that wasn't part of the deal for my apartment; I rent it cheap and since I'm a student (eternally so), it works. Mine's on the first floor of a crooked building, it smells old and unventilated like a loft.

As I walk up the outside stairs breathing in fresh air before facing the thick wall of dusty air in my apartment, rapid footsteps hit the asphalt behind me. I turn around in a quick attempt to face the unknown. But I am met with a pitch black, empty street lit up in small circles by dim streetlights.

“Hello?“ I whimper. *Whimper?* I can do better than that.

Alerted, I turn my fists into hard knuckles and scan everywhere around me. There is nothing to see. Yet I  heard what must have been human footsteps.

Probably a shy neighbour who is up late like myself. There are lots of introverts here, lots of people minding their own business despite keeping a quiet, distanced track of everybody else's. Kind of like vultures preying. I don't think they'll bring harm on their own but they know when others are weak and vulnerable.

“Whatever," I whisper and take the next few steps to unlock the door.

Then I see him: Another slim, hooded, shadowy figure with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth, face covered in darkness, he is running low across the parking lot which faces the opposite side of the staircase I am looking down upon him from. He has not noticed me, and he does not look like he wants to be seen. He pulls the handle on an expensive-looking, old vintage car; it doesn't open. I stand frozen, quiet, observing him as he taps the roof of the car, follows it all the way around to the passenger side.

What is he doing? I think he is trying to see if he can enter the car. Attempting to steal it; no way that's his.

I grab my phone, which has the brightness turned on to 100%, and it lights up my face. Panicked, I duck behind the staircase and turn it down. I begin to film, trying to see if I can capture what the man is doing despite how dark it is. I lift the phone up, and I get a grainy look at the shadowy figure pull on the other door handles, tap on the roof again—why? Discreetly, I lift myself up to get a better look.

He's gone.

For a moment, I feel my heart stuck in my throat. He saw me. He totally saw me, and now he's confronting me. I scan everywhere around me, there's no one. Maybe he's hiding somewhere so he can jump me when I leave. Maybe he knows me, he knows I am not from around here and I am going to leave again.

I open my apartment door, rush in and lock it behind me, hiding in the darkness so that if he is outside, he can't see that I'm in here, follow me around. I sneak to the window, which reveals the empty parking lot and the old vintage car, waiting for him to pop up again. As I sit there anxiously, my eyes darting from the parking lot to my tainted glass door, half expecting his shadow to show up.

He doesn't. Another 5 minutes go by, 20. By the 30th minute, I get tired. If he was there, if he was doing something truly suspicious and saw me, he wouldn't wait for that long to confront me. Would he?

I cautiously exit the apartment, quick glances scanning the environment, before I sneak down the stairs and I run back home. I run back home to the right side of the street, where I am safe.
