This is my last-ditch, last resort cry for help. When I tell people, they don't believe me and some of the doctors I've been to have laughed at me. I've been to several doctors, in different states, all to try to get some kind of reasoning for why my friend is so sick. But nothing. So I thought I'd tell you guys about it since no one else seems to believe me, any advice in the comments appreciated!

So my friend, Ally, is a really big foodie. We live together, and she loves to cook and always tries new things (some of them are a little far for me, but what do I know lol). She's even been to a lot of different countries to try new and exciting foods, I'm so jealous of her haha. It was a few weeks ago when she went to a town a few states over to try something called Kuru. She wouldn't tell me what it was, but kept saying that it was 'a forbidden fruit' and it was really expensive and rare. I was happy for her but also really worried at the same time. Apparently this trip was going to take at least 6 months, and she wasn't allowed to contact me the whole time. But I believed in her and I love her, so I just said how excited I was and that I hoped she had a good time!

When she came back from her trip, I was so excited for her to tell me all about it, she's usually so chatty and bubbly and loves to talk to me about all of the new things she's tried on her trips, but this time, she opened the front door, gave me this weird look, like she'd never seen me before, and went straight to her room and slammed the door.

She stayed in there for a few weeks, she didn't shower, and I'm pretty sure she didn't eat- but if I ever stayed up late at night, I would hear her door open, what sounded like she was dragging something heavy and wet on the ground, down the stairs, and out of the door. She'd come back about an hour later, drop something really heavy on the floor, and bang around for a bit before stomping back upstairs to her room with that same dragging sound.

I didn't want to invade her privacy so I didn't ask her about it or anything. I tried knocking but there's no response. Lately, when I go to take the trash out, there's this horrible, horrible smell where the garbage cans are and a lot more, very full, trash bags than normal. They seem to be soggy? Maybe a racoon died somewhere near it- that would explain the smell. I haven't been putting them out, so it might be Ally's leftover food she doesn't eat since she eats so late now. I managed to go close enough to the bags before, though, without fainting- the liquid dripping out of them is a dark brown- one of the bags split open and i’m pretty sure she might be buying like whole pigs or something because it’s honestly hard to describe what i saw in those bags without passing out.

I'm also worried about how late she goes out at night to do whatever it is she does. There have been reports of people going missing in our area and I hope that she's safe wherever she goes out.

When she was out one night, I managed to work up the courage to go and look at her room because she didn't close the door behind her when she left. It was a mess in there. Stains and thick, congealed liquids covered her floor and her walls, scratches all over the door and her bed was broken. Everything that was on her desk and her bookshelf was flung on the floor and broken and the door to her bathroom was locked shut. I don't know what she does In here now, but to be honest, I don't want to know.

I remember standing in, looking in through that doorway at the inside of her wrecked room for what seemed like hours. It was quite late at this time, about 2 in the morning- i think in my morbid curiosity i’d forgotten that Ally does, usually, come back from what she does at night and slumps back up the stairs to her room. I felt a cold shiver shoot down my spine as heard the grim, slick dragging sounds coming in through the door downstairs before ending abruptly with a wet thud. I froze: in my mind i was screaming, but all that came out was a soft whimper. She knew i was up here. My eyes were trained on the inside of her room. I didn’t dare look behind me. The damp thump, thump, thump of Ally’s feet up the stairs played in duet with my staccato heartbeat as a cold bead of sweat dropped down my back. I felt a presence loom over me- something much taller and much, much more intimidating. I squeezed my eyes shut. It wasn’t real. If i turned around Ally would laugh at me and tell me how silly i was. I felt a whoosh of warm, dank air as whatever was behind me inhaled deeply before grabbing me by my arm- digging deep into my flesh, and leaving me with a shallow gash that bled another stain into the floor. She shoved me aside roughly onto the ground- I wasn’t conscious for much longer, but i heard Ally weep quietly, looming over me, before scuttling back into her room, slamming the door behind her.

I’ve nursed my arm- it left a nasty bruise, she grabbed on to me tight- and stewed over what happened for the past few days. I don’t leave my room very much anymore after that.

Ever since then, I think that she knows that I know that she knows that I looked in her room. I'm beginning to think that she left the door open on purpose. Sometimes I can feel her watching me through the door if i ever dare to walk past it. This is not the Ally that I know anymore. Please, does anyone know a condition or a disease that would explain this and if it can be treated? She's acting so strangely and I'm getting scared of her. I woke up one night to her banging on my door and screaming and laughing at me before scuttling back to her room and slamming her door shut. All she does now is scream and scream, this ear-splitting piercing scream that makes my ears ring. The brown, congealed stains have grown to be all over the carpet outside of her room and has gathered mostly outside of my door.

I can hear her wailing and breathing heavily outside of my door, slowly scratching her nails down it. It sounds like she’s calling out to me. Taunting me. I know she’s very very sick, i don’t know what to do. She would never hurt me on purpose.

I think she's waiting for me.
