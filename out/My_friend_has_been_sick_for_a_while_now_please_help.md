This is my last-ditch, last resort cry for help. When I tell people, they don't believe me and some of the doctors I've been to have laughed at me. I've been to several doctors, in different states, all to try to get some kind of reasoning for why my friend is so sick. But nothing. So I thought I'd tell you guys about it since no one else seems to believe me, any advice in the comments appreciated!

So my friend, Ally, is a really big foodie. We live together, and she loves to cook and always tries new things (some of them are a little far for me, but what do I know lol). She's even been to a lot of different countries to try new and exciting foods, I'm so jealous of her haha. It was a few weeks ago when she went to a town a few states over to try something called Kuru. She wouldn't tell me what it was, but kept saying that it was 'a forbidden fruit' and it was really expensive and rare. I was happy for her but also really worried at the same time. Apparently this trip was going to take at least 6 months, and she wasn't allowed to contact me the whole time. But I believed in her and I love her, so I just said how excited I was and that I hoped she had a good time!

When she came back from her trip, I was so excited for her to tell me all about it, she's usually so chatty and bubbly and loves to talk to me about all of the new things she's tried on her trips, but this time, she opened the front door, gave me this weird look, like she'd never seen me before, and went straight to her room and slammed the door. 

She stayed in there for a few weeks, she didn't shower, and I'm pretty sure she didn't eat- but if I ever stayed up late at night, I would hear her door open, what sounded like she was dragging something heavy and wet on the ground, down the stairs, and out of the door. She'd come back about an hour later, drop something really heavy on the floor, and bang around for a bit before stomping back upstairs to her room with that same dragging sound. 

I didn't want to invade her privacy so I didn't ask her about it or anything. I tried knocking but there's no response. Lately, when I go to take the trash out, there's this horrible, horrible smell where the garbage cans are and a lot more, very full, trash bags than normal. They seem to be soggy? I haven't been putting them out, so it might be Ally's leftover food she doesn't eat since she eats so late now. 

I'm also worried about how late she goes out at night to do whatever it is she does. There have been reports of people going missing in our area and I hope that she's safe wherever she goes out. 

When she was out one night, I managed to work up the courage to go and look at her room because she didn't close the door behind her when she left. It was a mess in there. Stains and thick, congealed liquids covered her floor and her walls, scratches all over the door and her bed was broken. Everything that was on her desk and her bookshelf was flung on the floor and broken and the door to her bathroom was locked shut. I don't know what she does In here now, but to be honest, I don't want to know.

Ever since then, I think that she knows that I know that she knows that I looked in her room. I'm beginning to think that she left the door open on purpose. Sometimes I can feel her watching me through the door. This is not the Ally that I know anymore. Please, does anyone know a condition or a disease that would explain this and if it can be treated? She's acting so strangely and I'm getting scared of her. I woke up one night to her banging on my door and screaming and laughing at me before scuttling back to her room and slamming her door shut. The stains have grown to be all over the carpet outside of her room and has gathered mostly outside of my door. 

I think she's waiting for me.
