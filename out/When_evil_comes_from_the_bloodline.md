At 14 years old, I lived in a vast three-story house with my family. It belonged to my grandmother, whom we affectionately called Tita. The second floor was our home: my mother, my aunt Carla, and I. On the third floor lived my uncle Mario with his wife Renata, his stepson, and the twins Nicolás and Sofía.

Sofía, my cousin, was two years younger than me and had health problems since birth. Renata, insisting on being treated only by her trusted doctor, put the twins at risk. She… she had waited a long time to give birth. Sofía, born second, suffered prolonged hypoxia (a lack of oxygen in her system), which led to epilepsy. She was on medication, and until then, her life had been relatively calm.

One morning, like so many others, I went with my mother to let Nico and Sofía know that the school bus had arrived. On the third floor, Nicolás was having breakfast while Renata was showering, and my uncle was in the kitchen. Sofía was still in her room. Suddenly, a crashing sound shattered the air: glass breaking. My mother ran to Sofía’s room, thinking she was having a seizure. But before she could enter, my cousin came out running, with a bloodied piece of glass in her hand. A red liquid dripped behind her, forming a trail with every step she took.

Renata, the mother of the twins, screamed. The adults found her in the bathroom. I didn’t see what happened; I only heard the screams and chaos. My mother asked me to take Nicolas to the bus and to leave the scene. I obeyed; at that moment, I was the “older” or “protective” figure for Nico. When I returned that afternoon, my aunt Carla told me the truth: Sofía had broken a mirror and taken a shard to attack her mother. She… she had taken a piece of glass in her hand and pressed it so tightly that she cut herself… all to… attack her mother. I still don’t know how the adults, our parents, aunts, and uncles, had the courage to tell us, only the older children, what was happening. How do you explain that to a child?

In the following days, Renata began to disappear more often. According to Tita, she was seeking help, convinced that what was happening to Sofía was not just physical or mental; she was blaming something beyond our comprehension. Meanwhile, my mother and I took care of Sofía. We soon noticed that Sofía would lose herself in her gaze, staring at some invisible point. If she managed to go to that place… things would happen.

One night, my mother was in Renata’s kitchen, making dinner. Since she was busy, she asked me to look after Sofía, to… distract her. I don’t know if you can grasp what my mother was asking of me. It’s true that I’m the oldest, but… that doesn’t mean what was happening to my cousin didn’t freeze my blood. I accepted, after all, I loved Sofía, and my mother couldn’t handle everything.

I found her in the living room trying to do her homework. While we spoke, her expression changed. She shifted from a happy girl telling me about her day into an absent, neutral figure, like a mannequin. Then, she turned her face to look at the end of the hallway, where only darkness lay, the same place where she ran to attack her mother with a piece of glass the first time.

\- “Sofi?” I called nervously.

She didn’t respond. She stood up impulsively and began running toward the hallway. I only managed to shout for my mom to help and ran after her, grabbing her. My mother arrived just as I managed to stop her, holding her with all my strength. But Sofía, small and thin, had superhuman strength. I managed to hold her until my mother helped calm her down and took her to bed.

From then on, the episodes became more violent. Sofía frequently attacked Renata. One afternoon, my mother ended up with a twisted finger trying to restrain her. It was unthinkable that an 11 or 12-year-old girl could exert such force and injure an adult woman. In our house, the tension was unbearable. Nicolás slept with fear or simply didn’t sleep at all, saying that Sofía watched him at night. They shared a room, and apparently, at some point, Sofía would sit up abruptly and stare at her brother. At first, he thought it was a joke: “Come on, sister, stop it… sleep.” But nothing worked. He even tried throwing pillows at a distance to get Sofía to stop staring at him. In the end, he could only wait, nervously hoping the moment would pass quickly, covering his entire body and praying for the night to end.

Sofía didn’t remember anything that happened the next day; she believed Nico was just trying to prank her. Renata told him not to tell his sister about her condition to avoid worsening her… state.

The situation reached a climax one night. I heard a noise near the entrance to our floor. Remember, I lived on the second floor with my Tita, my mother, and my aunt Carla, while Renata and her family lived on the third floor. My room was closest to the entrance, so I must have been the one to notice the noise.

\- “Lala, can you open the door?”

It was Sofía. I recognized her voice, but something stopped me. In any other situation, I would have opened the door, but now… I felt I shouldn’t.

\- “Sofi, what are you doing there?” I asked.

She didn’t respond. She only repeated: “Lala, can you open the door?”

\- “Sofi, go to sleep. We have to go to school tomorrow.”

\- “Lala, can you open the door?” she said again, this time with a more monotonous, emotionless tone.

I thought something was wrong with Sofía, so I decided to go get my mom. When I came back, my mother opened the door with me behind her, looking over her shoulder. I was terrified—more than scared; it was distrust. There was no one there. The hallway connecting our entrance door to the stairs to the third floor was dark, but something was visible… my mother didn’t notice. She told me to go to sleep and left.

At that moment, I thought maybe I was imagining things… but there was something in the darkness. I could see something at the end of the hallway, right next to the stairs. I squinted my eyes and moved closer to the thing. Suddenly, Sofía stood up and ran toward me. I reacted immediately, spinning on my feet, entering, and slamming the door shut. It was a large metallic door, so the sound of the slam woke up my family. But it wasn’t just the door’s sound; it was mixed with the noise of something banging against it… Sofía.

My mother ran in, asking what happened. As best I could, I told her I saw it. My mother asked my aunt Carla to call Renata or Mario to inform them about what happened with Sofía. My mother wanted to open the door, but I was too scared… I didn’t want her to open it. It wasn’t good. I clung to my mother with fear while she approached the door. When she opened it… there was nothing. How was that possible? With that slam, I expected Sofía to be lying on the floor, unconscious.

Then, Aunt Carla arrived. Renata and Uncle Mario had spoken with her… Sofía… Sofía was asleep in her bed. According to them, she hadn’t left her room since she had “gone to sleep.” My aunt looked at me with disapproval, but my mother knew… she knew I wasn’t lying. Maybe she was a little confused, but I wasn’t lying. Something was happening.

The next day, while my mother was telling Renata about what had happened, Renata confessed something that had been happening to her even before Sofi's first incident. Renata would wake up with bruises and scratches she couldn’t explain… along with the violent attacks from Sofi, this led her to decide to go to the neighborhood church. That was the place she had been going to every day, almost every afternoon until late at night. At that moment, I thought it couldn’t be true. If it were, Sofi should already be fine, right?

I don’t know what made me follow Renata one of those afternoons. My mother had sent me to buy some things for dinner, and I… took a little detour. We arrived at the church. I was clearly keeping a safe distance, but I managed to see how Renata was greeted by the priest. They exchanged greetings, and she handed him something wrapped in cloth. I remember Renata pulling it out of her purse. She removed a kind of red cord, like red threads that were tied and holding whatever the cloth was covering.

It was the priest who moved one side of the cloth. I was a bit far from them, hidden behind one of the wooden chairs in the temple. However, I managed to see… something that looked like a lock of hair, right in the center of the cloth. I looked around. There was no one else in the church besides Renata, the priest, and me, hidden away. When I looked back, I saw the priest leading Renata toward the interior of something. There was a door where church supplies were supposedly kept, and I assumed they were going into that place.

I decided to wait a bit, but they didn’t come out in the next ten minutes, and I had to return home with the groceries for dinner. I didn’t tell my mother about what I saw. I didn’t think it was appropriate—what if she scolded me for spying on the priest?

I suppose that among all the adults in the family, they decided to bring the priest home. They gathered around him and told him about what had been happening in our family. Meanwhile, I had to keep an eye on all my little cousins. Some were playing, and Alex was talking to Sofi about something. My mind was split between my “duties” and my curiosity about the conversation the adults were having with the priest in the living room on our floor, the second floor. I don’t know when Sofi walked up beside me and headed for the room where the meeting was taking place. All I know is that when I looked back at where Alex and Sofi were… she was gone. Alex just pointed to the door she had exited, and I ran after her.

Sofi appeared in the room while the priest was performing a blessing. I only saw the expression of terror and surprise on the faces of most adults when they saw Sofi’s face. I was behind her, so I wasn’t a direct witness, but apparently, her eyes were white, as if her irises were turned inward. Then she fell to the floor, convulsing like never before. What came out of her mouth wasn’t her voice but something guttural and inhuman. My mother and Renata tried to contain Sofi’s convulsions. My Aunt Carla had the phone in hand, calling for emergency services. My Uncle Mario, Sofi’s father, just stood there, like a stone statue, watching the chaos unfold. I ran to my Tita to help her return to her room, and from there, I went to calm down my little cousins. I didn’t know what the hell was happening.

The priest continued praying, “As if that would help,” I thought, worried and angry at the priest’s behavior. Exhausted, the priest, the same one who had received the lock of hair, declared that the evil tormenting Sofi had a “blood origin” and then looked at Renata. She only managed to lower her gaze and burst into tears.

I don’t know if everyone understood what I did, but for me, Renata had done something—something involving Sofi, something connected to what I had witnessed that afternoon in the church… but I didn’t say anything. Since that day, everything changed in our family. Sofi was taken to specialists and continued with spiritual visits but never returned to being the same. Although she no longer suffered violent attacks, something in her had been extinguished, lost.

They decided to move into an apartment far from the family home, and over time, we all eventually moved away...

Over the years, the memory of those episodes remained buried but never completely disappeared. Recently, while speaking with my mother and my aunt Carla, I decided to bring the topic back up. Something inside me told me that I didn’t know the full truth. They exchanged a nervous glance before nodding, as if they had been expecting this moment for a long time.

\- “It’s time for you to know,” said my mother in a solemn tone.

What followed left me breathless.

Renata had not always been my uncle Mario's wife. Before him, she was married to a policeman named Jorge, with whom she had a son, William. According to my mother, Jorge was a violent man who controlled every aspect of Renata's life. It was during those years that Renata began doing things that no one in the family fully understood.

One day, Renata told them she had attended a “fire ritual.” The ceremony involved a circle of flames being drawn around her while a healer murmured words in an unknown language. Although she never explained the purpose, she hinted that it was to “protect herself.” My mother and my aunt speculated that it was something related to her ex-husband and that she had resorted to such extremes during her marriage with Jorge. Renata's behavior became even stranger after the death of her father. During the funeral, she and her sister walked three times over their father's grave—exactly three times—an act she never explained but that left everyone uneasy.

Then came the advice she gave to a family acquaintance whose son was addicted to drugs. Renata suggested something disturbing: preparing a meal with sewer rat babies, assuring him that "the dirtier they were, the better." According to the acquaintance, the ritual was to "appease the rebellious spirit of the young man." The acquaintance later told this to my aunt with a worried tone, saying that the woman “did very strange things, and it was better not to get involved with her.” By then, my uncle Mario had already married Renata civilly, and my aunt couldn’t intervene in her son’s life, even though she tried to warn others.

My mother and aunt also spoke about William, Renata's eldest son, who displayed troubling behaviors. From a young age, he showed a tendency toward violence, especially against defenseless animals. The family discovered, on multiple occasions, skins of rabbits, cats, and dogs stretched out and drying in the sun—William’s doing. The horror reached a climax when Sofía was 8 years old. Katy, Sofía's pet, had a litter of puppies. But one morning, all the puppies were found dead. My aunt said that William had killed them, seemingly pushing the tank into a wall instead of helping them when some got trapped behind it.

The most terrifying incident involved a kitten William had. The kitten became pregnant and gave birth to four babies. A few days later, they found it covered in blood, with traces in its mouth and paws. Apparently, it had devoured its own kittens.

My aunt Carla ended with a warning:

\- “The animals behaved strangely around William... and, years later, around Sofía too.”

Hearing all of this, I realized that what I experienced with Sofía wasn’t an isolated case but part of something deeper, darker, and more twisted that had been brewing over the years. Then, I remembered what the priest had said: “The evil tormenting Sofi had a blood origin.” Even today, I still wonder if everything I lived through was real, if Sofía’s experiences were a result of an illness or something else. And until now, I had remained silent about what I saw, about what Renata had done to Sofi, hiding as an “observer.”

But I truly always felt guilty, an accomplice. Maybe, if I had spoken up, if... Sofi would still be with us.
