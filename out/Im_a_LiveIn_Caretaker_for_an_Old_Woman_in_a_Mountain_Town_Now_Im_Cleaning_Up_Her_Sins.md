I never had a problem with old people. I actually liked being around them. They had that kind of experience — that quiet, heavy wisdom — that only decades of life can give. Maybe that’s why I started doing this job in the first place.
I wanted to do something good. To work for people who’d already worked their whole lives, who’d built the world around them, and who deserved not to be left alone in the end.
I got a job with a company that sent caretakers to elderly people who lived by themselves.
Usually, I was just a visitor — I’d check in on a few old folks during the day, ask if they needed groceries or medicine, maybe do some cleaning or help with little things around the house. Simple work. Quiet work.

They were happy with me, though.
So one day, the company offered me something different — a live-in position in a sleepy little town. An old woman who’d been alone for years needed a full-time caretaker. A local benefactor was paying for everything, since the woman had recently ended up in a wheelchair.
I hesitated. I didn’t really want to leave the city, or my tiny rented apartment, or my usual rhythm of life. But in the end, I thought… why not?
A little change of scenery. A break from the noise. Some peace and trees. I already liked the work — doing it in a quiet place sounded like a bonus.

That’s how I ended up in Mirebrook, a tiny village tucked between the woods and the mountains. The sun was bright that day, the breeze soft and warm, and I stood in front of a small green house whose porch swing creaked slowly in the wind.


“Come in!” called a hoarse, metallic voice just as I knocked.


The little green door creaked open, and I stepped inside, dragging my suitcase behind me.


“Hello!” I called out. “I’m the new caretaker. David.”


No answer — only a faint clatter from somewhere deeper in the house.
It was neat, but old. The walls were lined with black-and-white photos, the shelves cluttered with carved figurines, yellowed trinkets, and things that looked a hundred years old.
I took a few steps toward the noise, and then the beaded curtain to the kitchen parted — a wheelchair rolled through. With one strong push, the chair slid forward, and for a moment I questioned if the woman sitting in it even needed it.


“David?” she asked. Her voice was both kind and commanding.


I nodded and reached out my hand. Her grip was shockingly strong — like being caught in a bear trap.


“Mara,” she said shortly. “Call me Baba Mara.”


I smiled politely, but her face didn’t move. Her wrinkled, yellow-gray eyes studied me — sharp, measuring.


“You help, yes?” she asked dryly.


“Yes, ma’am,” I said, trying to sound friendly.


“Da. David,” she repeated, like testing the sound. “Good hands. Strong hands.”


I just nodded again. You get used to old folks saying strange things.


“Dobre, David.” She pronounced my name in that strange Slavic way, then turned the chair and rolled back toward the kitchen. “Upstairs, second door on right. Then come. Help me.”


The wheels of her chair squeaked rhythmically against the old floorboards as she vanished down the hall.

I carried my bag upstairs, dropped it on the bed. I’d unpack later, once she was asleep. For now, she’d asked for help — so I went back down.

The kitchen was… everything you’d expect from an old lady’s kitchen. Spacious, lived-in, filled with shelves of jars and old tools. Big enough for Mara to move easily around in her chair. She sat at the counter, chopping something with a large, shiny knife.
As soon as I walked in, she glanced at me — then quickly slammed the lid shut on a small brown wooden box sitting on the counter.

I couldn’t help but smirk. Old people could be like children sometimes. When they were hiding something, they did it in the most obvious ways.


“How can I help?” I asked, stepping closer.


The air was heavy with the smell of herbs and spices — sharp, but pleasant.


“Da, da…” she muttered, half to herself. “David, you drive?”


“Uh… drive? Like a car? Yeah, I do.”


Without another word, she turned away from the counter and wheeled herself to the back door. A little cat-shaped key holder hung on the wall beside it, covered in dozens of keys.
Mara grabbed one and thrust it into my hand with surprising force.

I blinked at her, caught off guard.
I’d assumed she’d be frail, helpless — the kind of woman still coming to terms with being stuck in a wheelchair. But no. Even like this, she moved with complete control, like she owned every inch of the place.


“Where are we going?” I asked, studying the car key.


“Mara show you,” she said simply. “Help me outside. To car.”


And she started rolling toward the living room.


“Mara!” I called after her. “Don’t you need that little wooden box?”


“Nye!” she barked — the first real anger I’d heard in her voice. “You no touch that. Not your business.”


Then she pushed open the front door and rolled out into the sunlight, leaving me standing there alone — staring at that closed little box on the counter.



Mara’s ancient Subaru Outback creaked its way down Mirebrook’s narrow streets. For such a small town, it was surprisingly lively even in the late morning. As we drove, everyone seemed to recognize Mara — and probably her twenty-year-old car, too. People waved from sidewalks, some called out friendly hellos at stoplights.
The whole place felt cheerful — almost cozy — and for a moment, I thought maybe I’d made the right choice coming here.


“Mara, where are we going exactly?” I asked after a while, watching as the houses thinned and the road led out of town.


“To man,” she said quietly, her voice flat, mechanical. “Next village. I help him… then… after that, Mara end up in chair. Must see… how he is.”


Then she went silent. For the first time, her stony face cracked a little. Something flickered behind her eyes — fear, regret, maybe both.
We drove on in silence for a few minutes. I tried to make small talk, but she only answered in short, clipped sentences.

From what she did tell me, I pieced together fragments of her life. She had escaped from somewhere in the old Soviet Union — didn’t even remember when she was born.
Her parents had stayed behind, and she never saw them again. Still, everyone in Mirebrook seemed to love her. Respect her. She’d helped so many people here in one way or another.


We never even reached the “next village.”
After ten minutes, Mara told me to turn onto a muddy dirt road far beyond the edge of town.
At the end of it sat a junk-filled lot, the kind of place that looked more like a landfill than private property. Rusted metal, broken furniture, shattered dishes scattered across the ground. And in the center — an old, decaying RV, half-eaten by time and weather. Its windows were gone, its frame dented and collapsing in on itself.


“Uh… we’re here?” I asked, clearing my throat.


“Da, David,” she grumbled, staring out the windshield. “Here. You go in. I cannot walk.”


My stomach tightened. A cold knot formed in my throat as I stared at the trailer. Something about it made every instinct in me scream no.


---


I stood before the RV’s filthy door, not wanting to knock.
I’d seen enough places like this to know who usually lived in them — junkies, drifters, the kind of people you avoided.
Mara had insisted it was safe.


“Sick man,” she’d said on the drive. “I help before. He good man… just lost way.”


I took a deep breath and tapped on the grimy mesh door.
Nothing. No bark, no voice, not even a shuffle inside. Just silence.

I knocked again, harder this time. Still nothing.


“Go in, boy!” Mara shouted from the car, her voice carrying through the still air. “Don’t be chicken!”


I forced a stupid smile at her teasing.


“Yeah, sure,” I muttered. “What the hell am I doing?”


Then I pressed down the rickety handle.
The door swung open — and a wave of stench hit me so hard I nearly gagged on the spot.
Rot. Decay. The wet, sour smell of something long dead. Flies burst out from the crack as I stumbled back, covering my nose, trying to swat them away.
Inside was filth. Broken furniture, soggy carpet, everything coated in grime. Rain had poured in through the shattered roof vent; water pooled on the floor in dark, oily puddles.


“Mara, this is disgusting!” I shouted over my shoulder. “What the hell is this place?”


I glanced toward the car. Her face had gone pale — white as paper. For the first time, she looked afraid.


“David!” she barked suddenly, her voice raw, commanding. “You go in! Bring me what Tom has! Don’t touch it with hands! Wrap it — quick, quick!”


I don’t know why, but I obeyed. Maybe it was her tone — something about it left no room for argument. I stepped inside the trailer.

The smell was unbearable. The buzzing of flies drowned out every other sound. The carpet squelched beneath my shoes.
And then I saw it. The source of the stench.

A man lay sprawled on the bed at the back of the trailer. His body swollen, skin split and glistening in the dim light. His face — puffed, purple — stared up at the ceiling, eyes wide open.
My stomach turned over. I barely made it out the door before I vomited into the dirt.


—


I sat in the car beside Mara.
My whole body was shaking. My mind felt empty, looping only one image — the rotting corpse on that bed.

Earlier, she’d sent me back inside the trailer. She’d yelled at me — like a drill sergeant barking orders at a terrified recruit. And I couldn’t tell which scared me more — her, or what I’d just seen in there.
But I went back.

Using a filthy towel, I pried something out of the dead man’s stiff hand. I barely dared to look at it, but from what I saw, it looked like a small square of metal, like a spinning top, trapped inside a steel cage.
The moment I handed it to Mara, she seemed to relax completely. That thing — that was what she’d been so worried about? She wrapped it up carefully and stuffed it under the seat, as if she’d just recovered treasure.

I just sat there, trembling like jelly. The stench clung to my clothes, the taste of vomit burned my throat. Mara, meanwhile, acted as though nothing had happened. She pulled out her old push-button cell phone and calmly called the police.
They arrived quickly. They knew Mara — and they knew the man, Tom.
She talked to them while I just stared blankly out the window, my brain buzzing.
I’d never seen a dead body before.
The image of it, the bloated skin, the half-eaten flesh, the way the air inside the trailer felt alive with decay — it crawled under my skin and stayed there.
It scared me. And somewhere deep down, it unsettled something else too, something I couldn’t name.


“David,” Mara said softly after a while. Her voice sounded different — gentle, almost grandmotherly. “I know… this hard for you. But Tom… Tom was drug man. Addict.”


I just stared at her, dazed. It was like two people lived inside her. The harsh, commanding woman from before was gone, replaced by a calm, caring old lady.


“This…” she nodded toward the towel-wrapped thing at my feet, “this help him quit.
Give him better addiction. Safer one. But I was sick. Surgery. I not go check him. I only wanted help.”


I nodded slowly. It sounded like it made sense — or maybe I just wanted to believe it. Her voice had that warm, soothing rhythm that made you stop thinking.


“I understand,” I said quietly.


“Good boy,” she whispered, and with her bony, powerful hand she patted my shoulder.
Like a grandmother proud of a child who’d done what he was told. “Now we go home, David,” she said at last. I make you something good to eat.”


---


By the time we got back, dusk had turned her little green house almost golden.
I sat in the kitchen on a small chair while the warm, yellow light filled the room. Mara bustled around like a mother hen — chopping, stirring, moving faster than I thought she could. The smell was rich and strange, like some kind of meat pie I couldn’t place, but it was… comforting.
Now she was loading dishes into the washer, humming under her breath. I offered to help — more than once — but she waved me off.


“You had enough test for one day,” she said.


For a while, I just sat and watched her. In that light, her face looked both young and ancient.
There was a glint in her eyes — like someone who’d seen too much, and still kept going.


“Mara…” I finally said, my voice low. “What was that thing? The one I took from the trailer?”


She didn’t answer right away. Just gave me a sidelong look — sharp and knowing — the kind that made words die in your throat.

When we got back earlier, she’d rolled straight into the little side room off the living room,
the box clutched tightly in her lap. She’d locked the door behind her and stayed inside maybe ten minutes. I’d just sat there on the floral couch, too drained to move.
Now, as I asked again, she seemed to weigh her answer.


“David,” she said at last, her tone slow and measured. “What you take from there… you never tell. Not to anyone. That thing… it is most wonderful thing in world. For little while. But if you use wrong… if you greedy… it take much from you.”


Her words were simple, but they landed heavy. Her voice had cooled again — not angry, just distant. It was clear she felt something about what happened, but Mara wasn’t the crying type. She was the bury-it-deep type.
I didn’t push her. I just nodded and let the silence stretch between us.

That night, before going to bed, a single thought circled my mind:
Tomorrow, I quit. I don’t care about the pay, or the peace, or the pretty view. If my first day ends with a corpse — what the hell’s coming next?


That night was awful.

I thought Mara’s magical dinner would help me forget what I’d seen, but it didn’t. Every time I closed my eyes in that cold little room, the dead man came back. The way he lay there, spread out on the bed. The way I’d had to pull that thing from his hand — like even in death he refused to let go.

I woke early.
The coffee maker was some old yellow relic that took me five minutes to figure out, but eventually it sputtered to life. I sipped the bitter, lukewarm coffee and thought about leaving.
This whole thing had been a mistake. Mara didn’t need me — and I didn’t need this.
If my first day ended with a corpse, what the hell was waiting for me next?


“David, you already up?”


Her voice startled me. Mara rolled silently into the kitchen — not even the wheels of her chair made a sound.


“Oh—uh, yeah,” I stammered. “I’m up. And… I need to talk to you, Mara.”


Her face darkened — not angry, exactly, but watchful. Like she already knew what I was going to say, and had decided she wouldn’t answer.


“We talk later, David,” she said gently. “Now you drive me shopping.”


The request caught me off guard. After yesterday, it felt strangely normal — almost comforting. Like this strange, herb-scented, secretive woman was just an old lady who wanted breakfast and company.


---


At the grocery store, everyone greeted her. People waved, smiled, called her name. One woman complimented her scarf, another asked about her surgery. Everyone had a story — how Mara had helped them once, with herbs, ointments, tea. She was like the town’s grandmother, its quiet healer.

For a moment, I almost forgot the trailer, the corpse, the box. For a moment, I believed this was just a nice, sleepy place full of nice people.
Then an older woman approached us. She smiled warmly and said,


“Mara, how’s Kate doing?”


The air froze.
Mara didn’t answer. She just paid for the groceries and wheeled herself out the door without a word.

The clerk stared after her. I hurried to the parking lot, catching up just as she was pulling herself into the car. She practically ripped the keys from my hand.


“Go, David,” she said flatly.


Her tone was cold again, sharp, commanding. And I knew — something was wrong.

We drove in silence.

I could feel her wanting to explode, to shout and curse, but she held it in. I didn’t dare ask who Kate was, or why the question had upset her so much. I didn’t even know what I wanted anymore. Half of me wanted to run back to my safe, quiet city life. The other half kept whispering that maybe this was just a bad start — that maybe tomorrow would be better.
Then she snapped.


“Bozhe moy, Davíd! Ty vëdёsh’, kak sonnaya kuritsa! Davaj, davaj! Bystree, idi!”


“What?” I asked, frowning in confusion.


“Drive!” she barked. “Faster, David! We must get home!”


Her anger hit me like a wave. I could feel it infecting me — my hands tightening on the wheel, the red lights, the slow cars, all of it clawing at my nerves.


“Mara,” I said finally. “What is this? What’s going on? Who the hell is Kate?”


“Chyort skazhi menya, proklyataya staraya baba!” she shouted suddenly — the foreign words sharp and guttural. Then, more clearly: “Do not ask, David! Just drive!”

I swallowed hard. Whatever this was, it had her terrified.


When we got back, she didn’t wait for me. She climbed out of the car on her own, moving with surprising strength. Didn’t let me help. Didn’t speak. I followed, tense, unloading the groceries.
By the time I stepped inside, she was already rolling back out, a large brown leather bag in her lap, her chair moving faster than I thought possible.


“David, leave that shit!” she snapped. “We have more important thing now!”


“Mara?” I called after her as she reached the door. “What’s going on? Where are you going?”


“I tell you soon, David!” she shouted back, already pulling herself into the car. “Now hurry! Maybe… maybe not too late.”


We were sitting in the car again, parked in front of another house. This time on the outer edge of Mirebrook — the part where even the birds seemed quieter, where the wind blew slower, heavier.

The house itself looked perfect. Two stories, a well-kept yard, flowers by the porch — the kind of home people dream about. But Mara just sat there, staring ahead. She’d hardly spoken the whole drive, mumbling to herself in that strange language I still couldn’t understand. I caught myself sighing, tension pressing in on me.
Something about the house felt wrong. I couldn’t say why, but I prayed I wouldn’t find what I found yesterday. Though, deep down, I knew I was ready for anything by now.


“David,” Mara said suddenly. “We go in together. You help me out.”


I nodded silently. Oddly, I was relieved. At least this time, I wouldn’t be facing whatever it was alone.
She looked weaker than before — fragile, like the air itself was weighing her down. I wheeled her up the short path to the front door. She gestured with one hand for me to ring the bell.
My hand trembled as I pressed the little button. The chime echoed through the house — too loud, painfully loud against the silence. But nothing happened.
No footsteps. No answer.


“I am too late…” Mara whispered. “My fault.”


“What happened, Mara?” I asked softly, resting a hand on her shoulder when I saw the sorrow on her face.


She looked up at me. And for the first time, I saw real pain in her eyes — not the cold, empty kind I’d seen before, but something raw. She wasn’t mourning a mistake. She was mourning a person.


“Don’t blame yourself, Mara,” I said gently. “Come on, let’s check inside.”


I reached for the doorknob and pushed.


To my surprise, the house was spotless. Clean, organized — even the air smelled fresh.
The furniture looked polished, untouched. It was like someone had cleaned just that morning. But no one was there. The house was empty — and oppressively silent.


“Hello?” I called. “Anyone home?”


No response.
Mara sat in her chair clutching that brown leather bag she’d brought along. I turned toward her, forcing a faint smile, trying to lighten the mood. But her face didn’t move.
Then the silence cracked.

A sharp, echoing cry filled the air — a baby’s cry. High-pitched. Desperate. Coming from somewhere inside the house.


“What the hell…” I whispered, stepping back.


“David,” Mara said quickly. Her voice was tight. “Whatever we find… you do exactly what I say. Understand?”


“What is this?” I stammered. “Mara, what—”


“Say you understand!” she snapped.


I nodded, my pulse pounding in my ears. I didn’t understand any of it, but I trusted that Mara — somehow — did. Then, with a sudden burst of strength, she pushed off the armrests of her chair and rolled past me faster than I thought possible.


“Find where baby is crying,” she ordered, already turning toward the nearest door.


The crying grew louder. It came from a small white door off the living room — probably a guest room.
Mara stopped in front of it. She stared at the floor, silent. The crying was right behind that door now — louder, more desperate.


“Mara?” I whispered. “What’s in there? Shouldn’t we help the baby?”


She hesitated, searching for words. Then she lifted her head, and her eyes went cold again.
That commanding stare returned, the same one that made me obey without thinking.


“We go in,” she said. “You do everything I say. No questions.”


I nodded automatically. It was like my will wasn’t my own anymore.
Mara turned the handle. The door creaked open.
And we stepped into a nightmare.


The guest room looked perfect. The bed was made, the walls bright white, everything neatly arranged — except for one thing.
From the ceiling hung a woman.

Her body was gray and shriveled, patches of hair missing from her scalp. She was naked, her ribs jutting out like knives beneath her skin. Her eyes were sunken, her mouth a dark, toothless void. Boils and open sores covered her body — some still oozing dark fluid that dripped onto the floor. But that wasn’t the worst part.

On the floor beneath her, beside a fallen chair, lay a baby.
A newborn girl. Alive. Slick with blood, crying so hard her tiny chest shook.
I couldn’t move .Every muscle locked. My stomach churned, and I felt my throat close. Mara rolled closer, her voice trembling.


“David… I sorry you must see this too.” She looked up at me then, her face pale, her eyes wet with something close to guilt.  “But now… no time. You help me.”


I don’t even know what really happened after that.
My hands were filthy, but I gripped the steering wheel so hard it hurt — like it was the only thing keeping me tied to reality.
The baby lay on the passenger seat beside me, wrapped in a clean white sheet. I drove with one hand and rocked her gently with the other. It wasn’t safe — but I wasn’t myself anymore either.
Mara had ordered me, back in the house. No explanations, no arguments. Her voice carried this awful weight — every word sank deep inside my head until I couldn’t resist her.

The woman — Kate, as it turned out — had hanged herself. I had to cut her down.
Mara had opened her brown leather bag, sprinkled some kind of brown powder over the body, and then pressed a small round metal talisman under Kate’s tongue. After that, she turned to me and gave her commands — cold and clear.


Drive south. Cross three towns. In the fourth, there would be a church. Leave the baby at its gate.

If anyone asked, say I’d found her in the forest. No questions. No hesitation. Mara just grumbled and urged me to go now. 
So here I was, on the highway, carrying a newborn born of a corpse, heading toward some nameless city to abandon her at a church.
My head buzzed. Two days. Two dead bodies. No one would ever believe me.
I spotted the church spire long before I reached it.
And that was when the realization hit me — what I was actually doing.

I pulled into the small parking lot. The engine sputtered and died, leaving only the sound of my ragged breathing. The sun was sinking, turning the world orange-red. I sat there holding the little bundle, rocking it slowly. The blood had dried on her skin, but the smell lingered — faint and metallic.

Then someone appeared by my window. I nearly screamed. But it was just a priest. I rolled the window down.


“Good evening, son,” he said kindly. “Are you all right? You came in quite fast.”


“Yeah… yes, I just— I have a problem,” I stammered.


His eyes drifted to the bundle in my arms. They widened. His face tightened. I could see the thoughts racing through his head — what did this man do?


“Father…” I began. “I—I found her. In the woods. I was hiking and… she was there. On a rock.”


The priest didn’t speak. His expression said he didn’t believe me — but he wasn’t accusing me either. He just studied me, then asked quietly:


“Son… what do you plan to do with this child?”


“I… I want to give her to you,” I said finally, and held the bundle out through the window.


The baby started crying. The air was cold and sharp, yet her tiny voice filled the space completely. The priest took a deep breath, then sighed, weary and human.


“Son, I can’t take care of a newborn,” he said gently. “Take her to the hospital… or the police.”


“Please, Father…” I whispered. “Please, just take her.”


For a few long seconds, he only looked at me — really looked. Then he reached out and took the baby.
And in that instant, it felt like a mountain lifted off my chest. He held the little girl carefully, looked down at her, then back at me. His eyes were dark, unreadable — but not judging.
He said nothing. I started the engine and drove off as fast as I could.

The sun had already dropped behind the hills. The horizon burned red — like drying blood. And I drove back toward Mirebrook.


---


By the time I reached Kate’s house, the street was packed. Police cars, flashing lights, paramedics. Mara was there, talking to an officer, while two medics lifted a black body bag into the ambulance.
I didn’t get out. I just parked across the street, in front of an empty house. A few neighbors stood around whispering, but otherwise the whole street was silent.
I rolled down the window, trying to catch what the police were saying, but I didn’t need to hear it. I knew. Mara was lying to them.

I didn’t have to wait long. One of the officers wheeled her over to my car and left us alone. Mara looked at me, her face calm again.


“You did what I asked?” she whispered, smiling politely at the officer as he walked away.


“Yes,” I said hoarsely. “She’s where you said. At the church.”


“Good.” Mara nodded. “Then it is done. You didn’t tell anyone where she was born, da?”


I shook my head. Got out to help her into the passenger seat. We sat there in silence for a moment. Then I finally asked,


“What’s going on, Mara? What happened to Kate?”


Mara sighed deeply. Her hands trembled in her lap.

“David… is hard to say,” she sighed. “Kate… she was sick. Depressed. It start when she find out she is pregnant. She not want baby. She not even want… man.”


She fell silent. I stared at her, trying to process what she was saying. It felt like I’d stepped into a place where everyone hid something — especially the one person I was supposed to trust.


“Kate is my sin,” Mara said finally. “Boże wybacz…” Her voice broke. She lowered her eyes. “I not go to her. I promise, but I not go.”


“What did you promise, Mara?” I asked softly.


She looked up at me. The usual steel in her eyes was gone. All that remained was exhaustion — and guilt.


“With baby,” she whispered. “She should not be born. I was to help… so she never know she was pregnant.”


I froze.


“Oh my God…” I breathed.


“God has nothing to do with that girl,” Mara said flatly. Her tone was colder than ever. “That child… is my sin.”

—


When I came down to the kitchen that morning, Mara was already there. Something sweet was baking — warm, comforting smells filled the tiny house.


“Good morning, David,” she said kindly.


“Morning, Mara,” I answered, rubbing the sleep from my eyes.


 I sat at the counter and just watched her move. Two days had been enough to learn one thing: Mara would ask if she wanted help. If I offered before that, she’d just get irritated.
For a while, the only sound was the soft hiss of the pan. Then, without turning around, she spoke.


“David, I know you want to quit.” Her tone was calm, matter-of-fact. “But please, stay one more day. Help me.”


I couldn’t answer right away. Part of me froze — how the hell did she know? Then it hit me: what sane person wouldn’t want to leave after all this?


“Fine, Mara,” I said at last. “I’ll stay. Just for today. But only on one condition — if I don’t see another corpse.”


She smiled — not mockingly, but softly, tiredly. Probably not the kind of first week she’d imagined for me either.
After a pause, as she set the pan aside, I spoke again.


“Mara… can I ask you something? Who are you, really?”


She turned toward me slowly. Her eyes looked dark and warm at the same time, like deep water in candlelight.


“Vedunya,” she said simply.


I repeated the word under my breath, rolling it around on my tongue.


“And… what does that mean?”


Mara chuckled — not loudly, but with a kind of weary wisdom.


“You know what it means, little son,” she said, giving me a playful wink. “Now set table. We eat.”


After breakfast, I did the dishes. Mara said she had something to take care of and locked herself in one of the rooms. When she came back, she was at the kitchen door.


“David, come,” she called, gesturing. “Need your help.”


I followed her through the living room, down the narrow hallway that led to the basement and bathroom. Without a word, she opened the basement door. That’s when I noticed the small brown wooden box sitting in her lap — the same one I’d seen on the day we met.
Then she leaned forward and shouted into the darkness below:


“Come up!”


My blood froze. Come up? What the hell was supposed to come up?
I didn’t even want to imagine what she kept down there. Then I heard it — soft, light footsteps on the stairs.
Childlike.
And sure enough, at the bottom of the steps, a small boy appeared.


“Mara, Jesus Christ!” I hissed. “You keep kids locked in your basement?!”


“Ah, shush, David!” she snapped, irritated. “Not child. You’ll see.”


The boy reached the top of the stairs. And for once, I believed her. That thing might have looked eight years old — but it wasn’t a child.
He was completely hairless. No eyebrows, no lashes, not even peach fuzz. His skin was pale and smooth, his eyes glowed faintly yellow, his mouth hung open just a little — and inside, no teeth. He just stood there, motionless, blank, like a puppet waiting for a command.


“Mara, what the hell is this?” I whispered harshly. “Who is this kid?”


“Told you, not kid,” Mara replied coolly, already wheeling herself back toward the kitchen.


I followed — and so did the boy, silent as a shadow.


“Stop, Mara!” I snapped. “What’s going on? You keep something locked in your basement? This is insane!”


She stopped by the counter.


“David, this… not human,” she said evenly. “I do nothing to it. But we must do something. It cannot stay with people.”


I just shook my head, nerves fraying. Another madness. Another nightmare.


“This is bullshit!” I yelled. “You can’t keep a kid locked up! This is beyond wrong!”


Mara’s hand shot out.
She grabbed a knife from the counter — faster than I could react, and drove it straight into the boy’s chest.
All the way in.
I gasped, stumbling back, staring in disbelief. The boy didn’t fall. Didn’t bleed. Didn’t even flinch.


—


I was sitting in that damned car again. This time, I was alone — or… almost.
On the back seat sat that strange, hairless boy. Perfectly still.
He didn’t speak, didn’t blink — just stared ahead with an empty, glassy look.
And when my eyes met his in the mirror, it felt like something was staring back from deep inside that emptiness.

That morning, Mara had made me promise to go. She’d said, 


“He cannot stay with people.”


I’d tried to argue — told her this was insane, that none of this made sense — but her voice settled into my skull like a command. And I couldn’t say no.
She’d handed me the small wooden box too. Told me to take the boy deep into the forest, leave him there, and bury the box in the ground at that same spot.


“He stay there. That is where he belong,” she said.


It didn’t sound hard. Just… wrong. Unnaturally wrong.
The drive was long. Every minute that passed, the tension in me built higher. The boy sat silently behind me. Sometimes I wasn’t even sure he was breathing. I didn’t dare look in the rearview mirror.

Then — a truck horn. Loud. Piercing. Like an alarm inside a dream.
I panicked, jerked the wheel — I’d drifted into the opposite lane. The tires screamed. The car fishtailed. I yanked it back just in time.
Stopped.
My heart hammered so hard it hurt.
For a few seconds, I just sat there, gasping. Then I saw the little wooden box on the passenger-side floor.


“Shit…” I muttered, pulling over to the side.


I leaned down to grab it. The lid had popped open. And a weird, greenish-purple dust covered the mat, no, not dust. Ash. Fine, metallic-smelling ash, like burnt flesh.
The box was empty.

Then — everything went dark.
Like someone had flipped a switch in my head. My vision tunneled. The sound drained out of the world. And I was gone. No thoughts, no fear — just blackness.


Then suddenly, the lights came back on. My sight cleared. The sounds rushed in.
The engine was still idling, rumbling softly. I wasn’t moving. The car was parked at the edge of the forest, the headlights cutting into the fog between the trees.
It was fully dark now. The beams of light sliced through the mist, painting the trunks a ghostly white. 
Where the hell am I? flashed through my mind, then I remembered. The boy.

I whipped around. And I didn’t know which would be worse — if he was still there, or if he wasn’t.
The back seat was empty. The door hung wide open.

I jumped out of the car. Looked around.
Nothing. No sound. No movement. No footprints in the mud. Like he had simply… evaporated.
I raked a hand through my hair, trembling. A knot of fear and guilt twisted inside me. I’d lost what Mara had entrusted to me, and yet, part of me felt relief.
Then another thought hit. That thing was out here somewhere.
Loose.


“Goddammit…” I hissed under my breath.


I shut off the engine but left the headlights on, just to have a little light. And then, for some reason I still can’t explain, I went into the woods.
Maybe it was duty. Maybe curiosity. Or maybe Mara’s voice still echoing in my mind, whispering commands I couldn’t ignore.
I didn’t have to go far. After a few dozen steps, between the trees, I saw something crouched on the ground. Still. Animal-like.
I lifted my phone and turned on the flashlight. And God, I wish I hadn’t.

It was the boy. That gray shirt, that bald head, those glowing yellow eyes. He was shoving something furry into his mouth. Whole. His jaw was stretched impossibly wide, like a snake swallowing a rabbit. His face twisted and spasmed as his throat bulged and popped. I heard the tiny bones crack between his teethless gums.

My stomach lurched. My legs went weak. Every instinct screamed: run.

I don’t remember getting back to the car. Just the squeal of the tires as I tore out of the forest. The stench of burning rubber. And my shaking hands on the wheel as I sped back toward Mirebrook.

The door slammed so hard it rattled the windows. I was back in Mara’s house — furious, terrified, done.
Mara rolled out from the kitchen, startled. The old wheelchair screeched across the floor.


“David, what happened?” she asked, tense, frightened.


I didn’t answer. I was already on the stairs, heading for my room. I shoved clothes into my bag, not even caring what I grabbed — I was leaving. Tonight.


“David!” she called again. “What happened? You left the package?”


No reply. I zipped the bag shut and stormed downstairs.
Mara was waiting near the bottom, her face tight with anger — but it wasn’t me she was angry at. It was the thing I’d lost.


“David!” she barked. “You left boy, da? With box?”


“Leave me the hell alone!” I shouted. “No, I didn’t leave him! That… thing escaped!
It got into my head — or I don’t know what it did! I don’t care anymore!”


I tried to push past her, but she grabbed my wrist. Her grip was shockingly strong — it hurt.


“Let go!” I yelled, jerking free. “I’m done, Mara! Three days, and all I’ve seen is death and madness! You’re crazy — and this whole goddamn place is cursed!”


I stormed to the door, grabbed the handle — and froze.


“David, you go nowhere,” Mara said calmly. Her voice was low, cold, final. “You stay. You fix what you break. I not say again.”


I don’t know what happened to me then. The fury just… vanished. The heat in my chest went out like a blown candle.
I stood there, my hand still on the door. A strange calm came over me — hollow and heavy.

I let go of the handle. My body moved on its own. I turned, climbed the stairs again,
threw the bag into the corner, and slammed the door like a sulking teenager.


“Then I’m not going anywhere,” I muttered to the empty room.


And just like that, the thought of leaving… disappeared.
