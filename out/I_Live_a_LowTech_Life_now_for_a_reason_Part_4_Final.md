The sound of people quietly talking to one another was what began to draw me out of unconsciousness. I couldn’t tell how many people were speaking, but I could faintly tell, as my senses returned to me, that I was hearing both men and women speaking. I opened my eyes, finding I was lying on my back and staring up at the starry sky. It was still night time, though whether it was still the same night, or another, I couldn’t tell. What I *could* tell, however, was that I wasn’t near the farmhouse anymore. Large trees rose up on all sides of me, meaning I had to be in the forest I’d seen beyond the edge of the property. I also could tell my hands were bound with something. I couldn’t tell if it were tape or anything else, but I couldn’t force apart my arms from down near my waist.

“Well, look who’s finally awake” I heard the same deep man’s voice I had in my car say, carrying almost the same friendly tone one would have when talking over drinks with a group of friends. “Well, don’t be rude, guys; help the man up!” I heard footsteps rapidly approaching me, then felt arms grab me under the shoulders roughly, hauling me to my feet. A massive spotlight snapped on, almost blasting me directly in the face and blinding me. I closed my eyes and turned away from it. “You’ll have to forgive the light, Jared” I heard the man say, “But there are some of our group who would rather you not know what they look like” He chuckled. “Even though the chances of you making it out alive are slim to none” I felt a chill at his words. He continued. “However, *I* have no such qualms letting you see me” After a second, I heard more footsteps approaching me. They walked around the other side of me, away from the light. “Well? Come on now and open your eyes, then!”

I opened my eyes, blinking away at the huge light, which cast everything it hit, including myself, in long, dark shadows. It also cast on a man, the one who’d chloroformed me and brought me here. And I recognized him. “You have *got* to be fucking kidding” I said, causing first him, than the many others behind me to begin laughing. It was the FedEx driver, the one who’d brought me that first package two or three months ago. He stood, flashing me the same smile he’d had when he asked me to sign that day. I cursed myself internally for not thinking of him as a suspect, when I’d been paranoid of almost everyone else. His black hair blew slightly in the crisp night breeze. “Nope, I’m not kidding you, Jared” he said, his eyes twinkling. I took a step towards him, feeling a mixture of fear and rage surge through me. “WHAT the fuck do you people want with me!” I screamed, “Why are you doing this?! Why me?!”

Everyone, including the man began to laugh even harder; I heard a woman struggling to breathe behind me from laughing so hard. Once the man had gotten ahold of himself, he took a single long stride before me, and I realized for the first time how tall he really was. I hadn’t been able to judge his height through the door that day, and had been distracted, but I could see that he was at least a head taller than I was. And I’m not exactly on the shorter side. His dark eyes almost looked like coals in the glare of the spotlight, and his smile had turned sadistic. “Why *not* you?” he asked, causing any retort I’d prepared in my mind to die away. Whatever I’d expected him to say, it hadn’t been *that*. He continued. “You’re looking for a motive, aren’t you, Jared. You want to, almost desperately so, have me tell you that there was some wrong you committed against me, or anyone behind the light. You want there to be something, some wrong you can’t remember, that you might be able to right, as some way to bargain out of this” He tilted his head, letting out a snort. “Am I wrong?”

I didn’t reply. The truth was, it was *exactly* what I’d been hoping for him to say. The sound of an owl or hawk screeching in the woods made me almost jump, causing some of the people behind me to chuckle, until the man raised his hand, causing them to fall silent. He looked at me with a mixture of what almost seemed like sympathy, and a sinister glee. “The truth of the matter is, my poor man” he began, “is that there *is* no reason. There’s no motive. None at all” A truly wicked grin now spread across his face. “Not beyond just wanting to have someone to play around with for our own entertainment” My shoulders dropped, along with my jaw. *They*’*re….just doing this for their own sick amusement?* I found my voice. “So, you just randomly picked me to fuck with before…what, now killing me?” I said in a shaky voice. He laughed again. “Well…you weren’t a random selection” he started, then gestured for someone behind the lights. I heard footsteps approaching us. “One of our group suggested you to us, and frankly, Jared, I’m glad he did. You’re the most fun we’ve had in a while” The footsteps moved around me, and a figure came to stand next to the man.

“Hey, Jared” I felt my blood turn to ice at both the voice, and the face. “….Vivien?” I breathed out as I stared at her. She flashed me a grin, throwing an arm around the shoulders of the man, and let out a giggle. “Oh, my god, do I wish you could see your own face right now” she managed out, “You look like you just saw the twist ending to *The Sixth Sense* for the first time or something” I just kept staring at her as the man leaned his head down to kiss her. I’d honestly expected Davyn to be the one to appear out of the darkness, but…not her. Pain seemed to reach around and clutch at my heart as I realized the one person I’d decided to trust the most, had been the one to betray me. I simply shook my head and turned away, staring out at the woods. “Oh, don’t be like that, Jared” I heard her say, using that same warm tone I’d gotten used to for years, “I like you, and think you’re a cool guy, but, when I mentioned you to my husband”, she leaned in close to the man, “he insisted you be our next little plaything. And what he says goes” She let out another giggle.

He leaned in close to her. “You think we should drop the final bomb on him before we start our game?” he asked her. After a moment, she nodded enthusiastically, laughing. He looked back at the group of people. “Hey, would you like to come out here and greet our guest?” he called to someone. I heard more footsteps approaching. In my head, I already knew who they would be. *Both Vivien AND Davyn are part of this group. They both were in on it*. A third figure stepped next to them, and any of those thoughts flew away like an eagle on a thermal. For the longest time, I could only stare, my mouth now fully open. Finally, I let out a strangled cry. “YOU?!”

Detective Monkhouse flashed me a huge grin. “You betcha, sport” he said simply, then turned to look at the man. *So it hadn’t been a voice manipulating program or anything. It was truly him*. The fact that a cop was part of this sick, twisted group of people filled me with a despair I didn’t know I had. He quickly added one thing. “You’ll have to forgive me for deleting and getting rid of all the evidence in your case, along with clearing out the party spoiling feds. Orders from the boss here” He thumbed at the man. “Oh, I’m sorry, I should say the evidence was *misplaced* and lost” he chuckled. Now the man finally spoke. “So, I can imagine you want to know what we’re going to do with you now, Jared” He unhooked himself from Vivien and moved towards me, stopping about five feet away. “Well, the thing is, after we have our fun messing about with our mark, it’s no fun to just stop and let them walk away. Not for us, anyways. That’s why Frank here”, he gestured to the detective, “Gave us the idea about five years ago to have a grand finale”

Monkhouse grinned. The man continued. “So, what’s going to happen now, is this. You’re approximately thirty miles from the town you went into last night. The farmhouse would be the first thing you come across. We’re going to cut you free from your bonds, and give you a three minute head start” The detective moved in, and I resisted the urge to strike out at him. There was no doubt that at least one or more of these people were armed, and I didn’t want to get a bullet in the back. He pulled a knife from his belt, and reached out, grabbing my bound wrists and slicing the duct tape from them before quickly stepping back. “Once your three minutes are up, we are going to come after you, using all the technology that this society has grown a false sense of security around. If we catch you, well…” he trailed off, raising a finger to his throat and drawing it across his throat like a knife. “*But*, if you can make it to the farmhouse, and your car, you can go free” He held up two fingers. “Scout’s honor” he said mockingly, causing everyone to laugh.

“Of course, nobody’s made it out yet” Vivien said, her voice taking on a sinister tone I’d never heard before. “That’s true” the man began, before slapping his forehead. “Damn it, why did I almost forget?! You’re going to have a partner with you on this” He let out a whistle, and a second later, a figure landed roughly on the ground next to me, moaning softly. I turned to look at him. *Davyn…* My coworker and friend lay in a heap on the grass. It was clear the group had gone to work on him; dried blood and old bruises covered his face. *They must’ve gotten him when he had gone to the Chinese restaurant that day*, I thought. I quickly moved and knelt down next to him. He looked up at me with dazed eyes. “..Jared…” he moaned out softly. I felt a new sense of rage tear through me, almost overwhelming the fear I’d had. As I knelt, my coat I still had on jostled in the breeze, and I felt something gently tap my chest. Something that hadn’t been taken from me when I’d been unconscious. Something nobody, not the man or anyone else had found. As I was hunched over, I had the perfect opportunity to slowly reach into the jacket, and begin to pull it out.

“So” the man said, raising both his hands as he stood next to his two friends, the two people I’d trusted most, “It’s time to begin” He leaned forward, grinning at me, and put on a mocking tone, trying to sound like a judge. “Does the soon to be dead have any last words they’d like to say?” At this, the entire group let out the biggest laugh I heard them make yet. They found the whole fucked up situation entertaining and amusing beyond measure. It made me feel sick to my stomach. I slowly helped Davyn to his feet. The man didn’t hesitate; he’d seen what I now held, and it had snapped him fully awake. “Actually, yes, I do have something to say” I said loudly, causing everyone to fall silent as they waited for me to speak.

“Say cheese, assholes!” I screamed, then raised the digital camera and slammed down my finger on the shutter button. A bright flash of light caused the man, Vivien and Detective Monkhouse to raise their hands to their face as I snapped their picture. “RUN!” I screamed at Davyn, and together, the two of us used the moment of confusion to begin sprinting towards the trees. Behind me, I heard the man scream out, all trace of sadistic humor gone from his voice. He sounded enraged, not having been prepared for my move. “Fuck the three minute window, get them before they get away and ruin everything!” The flurry of movement was heard, and I thought I heard the slamming of car doors. I didn’t pay attention, though. I was too focused on running as fast as I could in the direction. Davyn paced me; I could see him out of the corner of my eye running alongside. The trees closed in around us, and we entered the forest.

After a minute, we stopped to catch our breath; the sounds of our pursuers muted and faded in the distance. “What…the hell…do we do?” Davyn managed out between huge gulps of air. I fought for breath as well. “We just keep going in that direction” I pointed. “I think, he was telling the truth about going there. He doesn’t expect us to make it, that’s why he taunted us with it. It’s part of their game” I shook my head to clear my thoughts. “We’ve got to make it to the farmhouse and my car” I held up the camera. “And we’ve got to get *this* to the authorities. Ones that can put the word out about the detective”

I began to speak again, but I was interrupted by a buzzing sound whipping through the trees. We both looked around. A blinding flash of light made me raise my hands. “Duck!” I heard Davyn yell, and I listened, letting my legs give out under me and drop to my knees. A moment later, a drone flew only inches above our heads. I was yanked to my feet. “Go, before it comes around!” my friend yelled, and we both began running again. The sound of the drone began to approach us again, and we ducked, moving sideways away. It flew by a few seconds later, heading straight ahead. We kept running. After a few minutes, we stumbled from the trees onto what looked like a disused logging road. I was about to suggest to follow it when I saw headlights cut through the darkness. “Hide!” I hissed, and both of us ducked into a bush. A minute later, a Tesla Model X, one raised slightly on lifted suspension, with off road tires and roof mounted lights banishing away the dark, whirred softly past our hiding spot. It disappeared down the road, and we both looked at each other. “No roads” he whispered, and I nodded in agreement. That’s when the whirring sound came from behind us.

We both turned to find a drone, a different one this time, hovering behind us about ten feet away. I could see the camera focusing on us, but there was something mounted below it I couldn’t tell. Apparently, Davyn did, though, because I saw his face go pale before he was yanking me away from the bush, screaming for me to move. A moment later, I understood why, as a line of flame shot out from what had to be a custom flamethrower, setting the bush on fire. *They’d meant to burn us alive!*, my mind screamed at me. But I couldn’t stop to think. We ran, deeper into the forest as we finally began to hear the sounds of people yelling. I heard angry shouts, but I also heard excited yells and laughter as they crashed and drove and ran through the woods in pursuit of us. They were relishing in the chase as if they were high tech hunters on the trail of deer or birds.

As I ran, my mind stupidly shot back to a phrase from a book I’d read in school, one which sickeningly seemed to fit. *Man is the most dangerous game*. If it’d been any other situation, I might’ve found it amusing in a twisted way, someone making a work of fiction into reality, but there was no time for it. All of a sudden, a loud, blaring horn began to sound. I shot a look to my right and saw we’d ran straight through laser motion sensors they must’ve put up. The sounds of our hunters seemed to intensify, and I heard at least two drones, if not more buzzing in our direction. “Move!” I shouted, shoving Davyn forward. We crashed through a thicket, the thorns tearing at our clothes and skin. I felt branches and bushes smash me in the face in the dark, and I prayed neither of us would run into a tree. *Or anymore motion sensors*.

“Look, there!” Davyn panted out, pointing. Ahead of us was what looked like some old buildings. I held a hope for a moment that it was a place that was still in use, but as we broke the tree line, it was dashed away. We had stumbled into what was obviously once an old logging camp. The abandoned machinery and older style of the buildings, combined with the moss and mold I could see growing on the outside in the moonlight, showed that it hadn’t been used in decades. That was when a muted sound came from behind us. I almost thought I recognized it. It came again, and a cloud of dirt kicked up in my face as we were again blinded by a bright light. Another drone had found us. And this one was armed like the last. The sound of what I now knew was a muted gunshot spat out, and I felt slivers of bark smash into my face as it ricocheted of the tree next to my head. “Run for the buildings!” I screamed, and we both booked it for the darkened structures.

We were halfway across the dirt road when I felt a searing pain tear into my left calf muscle. I fell to the ground, rolling for a way. In the gloom, I reached down towards the pain. I gasped, both at the pain, and the feeling of something warm trickling steadily out from my leg. *I’ve been shot!* I could hear the sounds of the group getting closer; what had to be a vehicle’s lights appeared at least two miles or so down the end of the road leading in and out of the camp. Then I was being lifted to my feet. Davyn threw my arm over his shoulder, and as much as I could, we both moved quickly for the nearest building. The light came from behind us again, and I heard the muted sound of the silencer as we were shot at a few more times. Bullets tore into the dirt at our feet and lodged in the wood of the building, just barely missing us. And then, we were inside. Davyn slammed the door, and in the dark, I heard him lock it.

I stumbled across the room, leaning on the wall for support. “Here!” I called softly as I found a set of steps going down to what had to be some sort of basement. I felt him reach me, and one at a time, we slowly moved downstairs. As we reached what felt like a dirt floor, we heard our hunters reach the camp. Many shouts and orders came, and we heard the sounds of tires as what had to be electric cars or trucks flew past the building we hid in. Then, after a small squeal, a voice came over on a megaphone. “Little pigs, little pigs, come on out, little pigs!” It was the leader. There were a few moments of silence, then he spoke again. “Look, you managed to surprise us with that move, and I’m going to make sure next time everything’s out of our next contestant’s pockets, but I commend your thinking. You’ve got one over on us. And you have something which puts you with a bit of an advantage. So, I’ll make a deal with you. If you come out, and give me the camera, we’ll just let you go, okay?”

There was a small inset window on the far corner of the room, and I saw the beam of a flashlight pass over it. In that split second, I saw Davyn looking at me. He shook his head at me, almost frantically. I shook my head back, and the light moved away. We both knew that the man was lying through his damn teeth. There was no way he’d let us go. *The second he got that camera in his hands, we’d both be dead*, I thought. There was silence for a few more moments, and then I heard someone else speak through the megaphone. “He’s telling the truth, Jared” I heard Vivien’s voice call, “All we want is the camera, and I promise you, I’ll make sure he lets you live” Neither of us made a move.

Suddenly, the man’s voice came back through the megaphone. “Fine, have it your way” he laughed. “You know we’ll find you sooner or later. We have all night” His voice became deadly serious, and I knew it’d been him who’d called me up those times with the voice changer. “And when we catch you, we’re going to take our time finishing you off” And with that, he clicked off. The yells and calls of men and women resumed. I limped my way over in the blackness to where I knew Davyn was. Hitting the wall with my shoulder, I slid down onto the dirt floor. “We have to think of something to do, man” I whispered to him, “If we stay here too long, they’ll find us. It can’t be much farther to the farmhouse from here. We need a plan”

I heard him grunt in the dark. “We do” he finally said. “And I have one” There was a cracking sound, and suddenly a soft, green glow came from next to me. Davyn had found an old chemical light and cracked it, bringing it to life. In the soft glow, he looked at me. “What’s your plan?” I asked him. *I knew the guy was smart, nobody gets as high in the company as we do without brains!* But the answer I got wasn’t what I expected. “The plan is, I run in one direction, taking all their attention, while you run for the farm” I gaped at him. “Are you fucking nuts?!” I hissed, “We’re not doing that, it’d be a suicide mission!” He smiled a bit at me, then winced in what looked like pain. “I know” he said, then seemed to sag a little.

“…Davyn…?” I whispered slowly. I saw finally that he was clutching his stomach. He looked at me, then moved his hand away. I gasped as I saw the blood soaking the lower front of his shirt. I snapped my head up to look him in the face. He gave me another pained smile. “I got hit when I went back to help you up. The bullet went right through me” He coughed, and I saw a small trickle of blood come from his mouth. I kept my voice low, but gentle. “There has to be another way. We both need to get out of here” He gave me a hard look. “Jared, there *is* no other way, and you know it” He looked down at the blood. “And I don’t have much longer” His eyes met mine. They were hard, resigned. “We’re not both getting out of this” he said weakly, “But you can, at least. You *need* to get out of here. You need to tell someone the truth. To get that picture to them” He raised his chin high, trying to act tough, but I could see a little fear behind that resignation. “Let me do this”

I wanted to argue, even as I heard the buzzing of more drones overhead and more shouting. But I knew he was right. As much as I wished there was any other way. I still hated it, still felt guilty. Tears welled in my eyes. It was my fault Davyn had gotten into this. Still, I nodded. “Okay” I finally whispered. I saw him nod, and then he began to push himself to his feet. I reached down and helped him, letting him lean on me for a moment. He looked at me, then nodded and began to walk, slowly, towards the stairs. He stopped near them, seeing something on the ground and leaning down to pick it up. He looked back at me. “Tell Molly, I love her, man” he whispered quietly. I didn’t know what else to say, so I just nodded again. He held my gaze a moment longer, then nodded back and slowly began ascending the stairs.

I was left alone, my thoughts and emotions both buzzing. I wanted to chase after Davyn, but, again, I knew he was right. A few moments later, I heard someone shout. “There they go! I see the camera!” The entire camp suddenly became awash with noise and activity. I stood near the small basement window, and I could see multiple shadowy figures, at least twenty or thirty, dashing out of the other buildings. “Don’t let them get away!” That had been Detective Monkhouse’s voice, and my body filled with rage hearing it. Still, I kept silent. A moment later, a truck, what looked like one of those electric Rivian pickups skidded to a halt next to a figure, what I could see was the detective. I could see Vivian sitting in the passenger seat, and I knew that meant the man, the leader, had to be behind the wheel. There was the sound of a door slamming, and the truck, silent except for the soft whir of the batteries and tires, shot forward.

The sounds of the group slowly faded away. *Now’s the chance!* Forcing myself to put more pressure on my injured leg, making me want to scream, I crossed to the stairs. Stopping, I looked down at what my friend had picked up. It almost made me want to burst into tears. It was a small brick, almost the same size and shape as the camera in my pocket. I ascended the stairs as fast as I could, unlocking the front door and stepping out. I could hear the group still moving away from me, and I gave a silent prayer that the blood loss would take Davyn before they got to him. The air around me had again fallen silent, save for the usual sounds of the woods. I didn’t wait long; I moved down the stairs, then began to half run, half limp in the direction opposite where they’d gone, towards where the man had said the farmhouse would be. The terror kept my adrenaline pumping, which allowed me to ignore the bullet wound somewhat. As I ran, I kept looking over my shoulder, sure I would see the bright lights of their vehicles, or the whir of their drones. But I never did.

It felt like an eternity I ran, trees and bushes smashing into my face and body. A few times I fell onto my face in a heap, the pain in my leg almost too much. But finally, I burst through the edge of the trees. I looked around, seeing that the moon was still high in the night sky. Then, I began to openly weep as I saw the darkened shape of a farmhouse looming up. Feeling woozy from the blood loss and stress I’d put on my shot leg, I forced myself to keep going. The Crown Vic was gone, but the old Ford, *my* beautiful old Ford still sat in the driveway. I let out a soft, strained laugh. *The fucker hadn’t been lying. He’d been THAT certain nobody would make it*. Reaching the car, I pulled the driver’s door open and collapsed into the seat. Like a godsend, the keys still dangled in the ignition, and I wrenched on them, the old engine coming to life with a cough. As I put the car into reverse, I stared one last time at the woods. “Godspeed, Davyn” I whispered softly, then tore out of the driveway.

It’s been almost a year since I burst from that tree line and tore away from that farmhouse. Once I got onto the main road, I drove until I came to the first town, where I went straight to the police. I can only imagine how I must’ve looked, crashing the Ford into a parking meter before smashing through the front doors of the small police station, with my clothes torn and dirty, and a bullet wound in my leg. The police rushed to my aid, and after summoning an ambulance, I told them my story, insisting that they get in touch with higher authorities right away. Thankfully, they didn’t just write me off as a nut job or crackhead running from a drug deal gone bad, and did just that. By the next morning, the small town of a few thousand was awash with flashing lights as members of a very high agency, one which I don’t dare outright name, but I can assume you can take a good guess, flocked in.

I was questioned about my experience. I saw the head honcho’s face light up with excitement when I showed him my camera, which he took, looking at the photo I snapped. “We’ve been after this group for years now” he said. It turns out, these people are a lot worse than I’d already thought. Apparently, they’d been taunting, emotionally tormenting, and finally kidnapping and killing people for close to fifteen years now. Many of their members were black hat hackers, able to get into just about any piece of modern technology and twist it to their benefit or use, and they would use the money stolen from their victims to keep funding themselves. I shuddered when they told me the number of people who’d fallen victim to them already. I was simply the first to ever get away. It also turned out, they’d had their suspicions about Detective Monkhouse when he began trying to get them off the case, claiming it was a local matter and out of their jurisdiction.

“So, you’ll be able to get them all now?” I said hopefully as they spoke about printing out a picture. But the man simply shook his head, almost sadly. “I don’t know if we will” he admitted, seeing my shocked expression. As he explained, it turned out they were good at changing their identities, using stolen and forged IDs and social security cards, along with changing their physical appearances, to stay out of the clutches of the authorities. “There is one bit of good news, though” he said. “You’ll likely never see or hear from them again. It’d be too risky for them to make a move on you now”

Still, they said they’d put me into the witness protection program, giving me a new identity to start over. Before they did, however, I asked for one favor. I honored Davyn’s final request, and called Molly. Thankfully, they let me. She wept fiercely when I told her the little I could, and especially when I passed on his last message, but thanked me before hanging up.

They never found Davyn’s body. They found a large pool of blood out in the woods, one which a DNA test confirmed was his, but nothing else. I pray he’s at peace, and long gone from this world, not…with them. They were also right about never catching them. Vivien and Detective Monkhouse fled, never returning to the city. The last I heard, they’re still tracking the group, and they’re still doing what they did to me, to others, something which chills me to the bone. They also, I found, hushed it up, never letting it get out to the national news. The excuse they came up with was that an unfortunate victim had wandered across the path of a drug deal, causing the chaos. Since it’s such a common occurrence in the US these days, nobody thought to question it. They didn’t want word to get out and cause a panic, or have people suddenly dump out all their modern devices in a mass panic.

As for me? I never saw or heard any trace of them again, something I thank God for. The fed had been right; I must’ve become too high profile to dare make a move on. I’m now living across the country, thousands of miles away from there with a new name, and I say a silent thank you to Davyn every day for it. Even if I could say where, I wouldn’t. All I will say is, I did decide to live a quiet, remote life with my new identity, on a farm. I feel a happy sense of peace out here. But, I’ll never own any modern pieces of technology again. No Smart TVs, No Smart Phones, No modern computers, nothing. I collect older technology, CRT TVs with VHS and DVDs for entertainment, using a free antenna for the news. All my appliances are from the 80s or before, and I don’t own any cell phone, only having a landline in my house. All my neighbors are either of older age than me, or simply prefer a low-tech existence, which I honestly love. I don’t think I could deal with getting gifted some modern piece of tech now. The town nearest to me, thankfully, is still stuck in the 90s at least, without many, if any cameras around. I feel safe moving about town. That’s where I am now, writing this from a computer in the local library.

I’m posting this, because, as much as I understand the authorities’ wishes to not send the public into a mass panic, you need to know. I know many of you won’t believe me, but I need to warn you regardless. Those people are out there. They’re finding new victims to have their sadistic, horrifying game with. And I don’t want it to be you. The world is so dependent and addicted to technology now. You might be as well. I understand that, it’s the way the world is at this point. But please, still, be careful. Be careful, and be wary of all the cameras and microphones you allow into your home, with nary a care in the world. Be careful of the privacy you give up for the sake of convenience.

Because you never know who may be listening. Or who may be watching.
