I was born in a Christian doomsday cult "Cherubim Guard". Being born in a cult made my childhood very different from everybody else. To start with, I never knew my parents. It did not bother me because it was the same case for all children in the cult. Elders told us that we - kids, were sent from the heavens. And God sent us for a reason to Earth - we had to lead the fight against armies of hell when Armageddon eventually happens. Like every other doomsday cult "Cherubim Guard" believe that end is coming soon and our time is limited. Our cult did not plan to surrender so easily because they had us - archangels. I and six other boys were taught that we are reincarnations of biblical archangels. From the moment we learn to walk we were trained as soldiers. We learned how to shoot, fight and survive. I was held in the biggest regard and under the highest pressure because my name is Michael and it was my duty to lead other boys.

Eventually, stockpiling weapons and explosives caught the eye of the government and they deemed us a dangerous organization. One day, without warning, police stormed our compound. Believing that these were the promised end of the days, cult members started fighting back. Many people that I loved died that day and in the end, those who survived were arrested. I and the other kids were taken by child protective services. We were separated and put into foster care. My new family welcomed me with open arms. With their love and years of therapy, I managed to integrate into society.

I thought that my cult life stayed in the past, but in the last weeks, I started having nightmares. In my dream, I see cities engulfed in fire and demonic creatures running on the streets. I tried to ignore them, but something strange happened last night. I was going home after work and I saw two guys harassing a woman. I decided to intervene. When I approached them commanding men to stop bothering the woman, they all turned to me. What I saw shocked me, all three of them looked like they were wearing half-translucent masks of human faces. Underneath the mask, I looked at red-skinned faces with eyes dark like charcoal, missing noses, huge mouths with shark-like teeth, and split tongues. I was paralyzed, I could not move, I could not breathe. The creatures laughed and said in chorus:

"You will not stop me this time, brother!"

Then they turned and just left. I stayed in that place frozen for solid fifteen minutes. I am in complete disarray, I don't understand what happened. Was it all hallucination? But I never had hallucinations before. This encounter brought back all my childhood memories. What if the end is coming? I must find my elders - what I saw is too much to ignore. But first, I need to go to a doctor to check the weird bumps on my shoulder blades.
