it’s been days. most of us here in the library are terrified to even open the door, but we’ve run out of food. the screams and groans have quieted down, but the outside still has that weird green fog. we know we’re safe in here, but what about out there? i can see the science teacher as i’m writing this, her face looks almost melted. her skin is green and there blisters all over her. and, of course, the cherry on top, a dark green, almost black, slime is coming out of her mouth. she was my least favorite teacher, but god i feel terrible. 

what if when one of us goes out there we turn into one of those things? what if the library is the only safe place in this school? 

there’s seven of us here in the library, for some reason we never told each other our names. nobody asked anyone else, i guess they’re all hoping we’ll get out of this soon so we won’t need to ever see each other again, but the growing hunger is telling us all different. for the moment, the bathrooms across the hall work so we’ve had plenty of water. and none of us have tried the cafeteria, it’s across the school. but i just might go out there myself soon, im fucking starving. 

it’s only been a few hours since i last wrote, we had some sort of ‘meeting’ in the office near the library doors. one of the boys had apparently assigned himself our ‘leader’, trying to take charge. he said it’d be best if we finally introduced ourselves. i don’t know about the rest of these people, but i for sure told them a fake name. though, i’ve always loved the name. i told them my name was romy. then the rest of them said their ‘names.’ there was leader boy, josh. then his best friend zayn, zayn’s girlfriend avina, cage - someone i’d talked to once in one of my classes, never knew his name though, a really tall dude named travis, and a girl i recognized from a different class, she was on the track team too, her name was leena.

after we all introduced ourselves josh said that tomorrow, him and two other people should go to the cafeteria to look for food. i was all in for it, i even said i would go if nobody else wanted too. he told me i was ‘too fragile’. probably because i look anorexic, but damn dude taht was rude. zayn and travis had offered to go, and the conversation ended there. josh excused us, saying that we could all go back to where we all slept. 

now i’m in my little corner room made out of shelves, about to open the bag of cheez-Its that’s been sitting in my bookbag for two weeks now. god, if anyone else is reading this please tell me - are you okay? how is it where you are? has the fog come in yet?
