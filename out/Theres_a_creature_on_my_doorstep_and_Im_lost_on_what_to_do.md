This story will be long and I apologise in advance, you're welcome to skip to the end to get the crux of it all. I know what it is, ive read nosleep enough, the one thing all the stories leave out though is what to do when you find yourself a target of one. Maybe someone can help, at this point I don't even know if I'd have the energy to fight it anyway. Regardless, I'll begin.

It started 3 months ago. I'm a night shift worker, standard in these stories I know, whatever pays the bills I guess. I was on my way home, less than 100 metres from my driveway when something darted across the road in front of my car, the front corner of my passenger side smashing into it.

This creature was incredibly long, impossibly long to be honest and running on all fours, deformed and pitch black in appearance. I exited my car, my brain trying to rationalise it telling myself I've just hit some breed of dog. The force of the hit sent it into the tall hedges that line the entrance to my suburb, and as I approached, there was a god awful smell, like decaying flesh. My mind ran with possibilities as to how it could already smell like death, maybe the dog was already injured, maybe it had some sort of festering wound and thats why it looked so odd when I got a brief glimpse of it. I wish I was right...

Before I located the animal, I heard a man's voice...well...something like a man's voice, only a little off, coming from the tall hedges. He was crying for help, in a very distorted way, like someone recorded a man crying for help and had it on repeat, awkward and stunted. I stop dead in my tracks, as I said, I've read nosleep enough. I knew damn well that what I had hit was not a person, and now I knew it wasn't a dog either. My brain stopped rationalising and I instantly knew something wasn't right. As I was backing up towards my car, something caught my eyes towards the top of the hedges, which were roughly 2 metres tall, slightly taller. 

They were eyes.

"What the fuck..." escaped my lips.

Reflecting the streetlights, I saw 2 distinct eyes, swaying and blinking. That was enough for me. I dove into my car and shot off as fast as the old gal would take me. I didn't want to go home, my fiance and unborn child were there. The creature didn't follow as I drove away. I drove around my entire suburb, every street, until the intricately designed loop took me back out of the only exit my suburb has. It wasn't there, it wasn't anywhere. I drove around for the next hour throughout my little town, hoping the creature was bored or had been distracted and had left the area.

Eventually I got a message from my fiance, she'd woken up and realised I wasn't home yet, and after checking life360 and seeing the erratic loop I'd been driving in, wanted to check on me and see if I was okay. I told her I'd explain it to her when I got home and that I was physically okay. I decided to head home and to my relief, as I crawled up the entrance, the thing was nowhere to be seen.

I got home and told my partner everything. No secrets. She doesn't believe in the paranormal, but she doesn't not believe it either. She was spooked, but her rational brain was stronger than mine. She chalked it up to me being tired, listening to too many paranormal podcasts and having an over-active imagination. She put my mind at ease like she always does, no matter how worked up I am, god I love her. After telling me to get ready for bed and come for cuddles, I started evening myself out and did so. I settled into bed, cuddling her from behind and wrapping my hand around the little bump on her belly. I pushed the thought out of my mind and started to drift off when I heard something from my ensuite window along the side of my house. A misplaced comment that didn't belong outside a window at 5am. 

"What the fuck"...whispered in my own frightened voice.

I shot up out of bed and before my feet hit the ground, there was a blood curdling screech that seemed to come from everywhere, impossibly loud and inhumanly high pitched. My fiance sprang up, screaming and almost immediately crying as a result of the shock, confused and scared. I grabbed a knife I had tucked Into the side of my mattress and as suddenly as it began, it was over. No footsteps or cracks of leaves and twigs, no rattle of something climbing or crashing through the fence. No evidence that anything was in motion outside. This didn't calm my mind, this shot two thoughts through my head. This thing is either supernaturally quiet...or it's still there, waiting for me to investigate. I'll back down when it's just me on the side of a road, no reason to risk myself, but when my reason for living is sobbing in bed next to me, I'm a different man. I was outside and at the same window within 15 seconds. Nothing. No foot print, no markings, not a damn thing.

I went back inside and comforted my partner, telling her nothing was there. I took a page from her book, telling her we were both on edge from my incident hours earlier, believer or not, you're loved one describing a paranormal event can shake you and it was probably just a possum or some kind of bird screeching it's lungs out next to the window, our mindsets exacerbating the situation. She nodded as she tucked into me, but I could tell my attempt hadn't worked. She was terrified and rightly so. She doesn't follow folklore, but I do.

A long, disfigured, dog-like creature. Capable of standing on 2 legs like a man. Capable of mimicking voices. Terrifying and inhuman.

It was a skinwalker.

That was 3 months ago. Right now it's on my doorstep. My rear doorstep. Less than a metre away from me as I sit on the lounge writing this. Separated by mesh, glass and a curtain. "You need to help me" it echoes. Another phrase it learned from me. If im still here by the morning, I'll fill yall in on that. For now, I'll do what I do every night it visits us, arm myself and wait for it to attack. The cops won't come anymore, guess I've "cried wolf" too many times now. My partner has just made me a coffee with a side of sandwich to help me stay awake for yet another sleepless night. Wish me luck and I'll hopefully post more tomorrow.
