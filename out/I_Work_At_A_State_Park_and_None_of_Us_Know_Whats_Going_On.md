“Get down to the docks with that harpoon right now!” Yelled my boss over the radio. 

I was sweating profusely; rummaging through the old tool shed. It took me long enough just to pry the rusty doors open let alone find that stupid harpoon in all of that mess.

“What the …. is taking ..long!” My boss came in over the radio, the sounds of static, screaming, and rushing water chopping up his words like onions. 

I was throwing things at that point. 
“Where is this harpoon!” I yelled to no one. I kept throwing things, a large pile of rusty equipment beginning to form a rather impressive mountain just outside. 

“Ahhhgggggggggghhhhhhhhhhh” I heard over the radio. 

And then, as if divinely illuminated to me, I saw it. The harpoon. A long, rusted, heavy piece of metal, wrapped at the bottom with what I could only describe as pirate rope. I lunged for it, tripping over God knows what as I did. My life flashed before my eyes as I watched myself stumbling towards the harpoon.
 
WHAM!

 I smacked my face hard against the wall, millimeters away from the edge of the harpoon. I grabbed it, and ran back out of the shed, passed the mountain of rusty equipment, ran down the access trail, across a parking lot, and finally down to the boat docks, where I could, upon entering the area, see the carnage left in that thing’s wake. Most of the docks were splintered to tiny bits. I saw my boss standing on a bridge that crossed to the other side of that narrow part of the lake. I ran up to him, holding the harpoon at the ready. 

“You're far too late Jimmy”
 
I could see it was true as he pointed toward the edge of the outcove where it opened back up into the main body of the lake, I saw smoke, I saw the boat sinking beneath the waves, and I saw that giant, horrible tentacle, dragging it down. 


“Did it ever…uh…come all the way up?”

“No, four tentacles is all we could see.”

“Did you get those guys off that boat?”

“No.” My boss said, his head drooping a little.

Just then the sounds of two men gasping for breath and crying for help broke the stale silence that the creature had left in the void above the surface. My boss and I ran to the end of the docks, grabbed the life rings that we kept hung up on a post nearby, and helped bring the men ashore.

“What…what…was that?” One of the men said, now standing safely on the shore. 

“No idea,” my boss said. “You boys alright?”

“I think so.” Said the other man. 

“That you all’s truck there?” I said pointing to the only vehicle in the parking lot.

“Who else’s would it be Einstein?” Said the other man. 

I just helped save a man’s life, and still he felt the need to talk down to me. It’s something about this ranger uniform. I might as well walk around with a big “kick me” sign on. The two walked to their truck, swearing and yelling about who’s fault it was the whole way, they drove off, and just like that, the park was quiet again. 

Back near the Rangers cabin my boss eye’d up the massive stack of old rusty tools that I had built just outside the shed. 

“Clean that up Jimmy. We’ve got appearances to keep up.” 

On my way out to throw everything back into the shed I gestured to indicate the cluttered station around us. My boss just raised a finger pointing to the mound of glorified trash we called tools sitting in the yard. I let out a sigh, and left to do my job. 



	
My name is James, and I work at Richard L. Hornberry State Park. The park consists of a 20,000 acre lake, the lake is also called Richard L. Hornberry, but, like the park, everyone just calls it Hornberry. At this point no one even knows who Richard L. Hornberry was, I mean maybe some local historian, or surviving relative, but the general public, and the park staff, have no clue, nor do we care. We are too busy with other things.
Surrounding the lake is about 1500 acres of woods. 

The woods are separated into sections, this helps make navigating the park easier, but dividing it up couldn’t have been much of a difficult task whatsoever. It is already pretty sectioned off via geography, or geology, or both I guess. On the north side of the lake there is coniferous forest. A few thousand pine trees and cedars stretch from the shore of the lake all the way to the northernmost boundary of the park. The southern part of the park is just called the Swamps, because…it’s a swamp. It is full of cyprus trees and hanging moss and all that other swamp stuff. To the west of the lake you’ve just got a large wooded area, coniferous and deciduous, but mainly deciduous. I think the only reason there are any pines or cedars over in that part is because seeds get blown over there from the north. It has plenty of steep ridges with big flat tops, and valleys. On the east side the woods are similar to the west side but there are rock formations there. There is one main cliffline but there are lots of boulders that over the millions of years have fallen down and created some cool little grottos. In the middle of the lake there is an island. Officially it’s called Hornberry’s Point but everyone calls it Ricky’s Roof, I’ll explain why in a minute. 

In that northern pine forest there's a little single acre pond just called The Trout Pond. No cool nicknames I’m sorry. If you couldn’t guess that is where we stock the trout. The rest of the lake is stocked with walleye, striped bass, largemouth bass, crappie, bluegill, channel catfish, and I think some blue catfish. I am a ranger here and I work alongside four other rangers, their names are, Aaron, Jordan, Richard (no relation to Hornberry), and Ellen. We all work under our boss Phil, but we all just call him Boss.
 
When I took on the job I was a bright eyed happy-go-lucky college grad, ready to sink into the world of park management and wilderness restoration. Simpler times. The National Park Service sent me here and this is where I have to stay, until they send me somewhere else, but I don’t think that will be happening any time soon. 

The local’s all say that the park is haunted. But they don’t work here. It’s not that it’s haunted, I mean sure it is that, but it’s something more than that. You know how all those old sixties sci-fi shows talked about places just beyond reality? Like how technically, lore wise, everything you see on The Twilight Zone, happens in this fictional plain of reality called “the Twilight Zone.” Or the people in the story were, “behind the veil,” “one step beyond,” or hanging out in the “outer limits.” The way the show explained the anomalous and bizarre things that occurred in each episode was that the characters had stepped into a different reality. Well that’s what it’s like here. While those daytime television characters of decades past might have only taken a step, or gone on a trip, into their respective anomalous zone, I work in mine. 

Weekenders might have an odd experience, hear a few sounds, or see something in the water or whatever. Day trippers might just get an odd feeling that boils up all day and eventually boils over on them into something you might call the heeby jeebys. They’ll leave, talk about it with their buddies, hear all the local legends about the place, think they are dumb and then move on with their lives. Generally speaking these folks, who make up the majority of the park visitors, can get out unscathed, and with a relatively good campfire story to tell, in some other park of course. It’s the ones that try to do a week long trip, or get lost, that usually suffer the worst fates the park has to offer. 

I spend most of my day responding to calls like, “the flock of crows up in the Pines won’t stop saying this hiker's dead wife’s name,” or “the squirrel pile is getting too big and it’s starting to freak people out.” The Squirrel Pile as we rangers call it is exactly what it sounds like. There’s this place over by the cliffs where squirrel bodies just pile up. Squirrels routinely jump to their deaths in the exact same spot on the cliff line and no one really knows how to explain it. No one really knows how to explain anything that goes on around here. You learn eventually just not to question things. It’s not that we aren’t allowed to ask questions, it’s that nobody knows the answer, nobody knows why this park is like this, or why nowhere else has these problems. 

Theories have been spun around for years apparently. Old Indian burial ground, that’s a classic. Large iron deposits on the east side of the lake, this is meant to explain why compasses don’t work here but it doesn’t check out. It would be one thing if compasses just didn’t work in the park, but it’s the fact that they usually do work that makes the place so dangerous. 

Sometimes the strange things that happen here are just that. Strange occurrences, nothing really tangible necessarily. People say that if you’re out on the lake you can hear women singing, or screaming; all the best fisherman say which of the two you hear depends on how many fish you’ve caught. There’s also a fog that moves around the park. It never dissipates, just moves to a different area. In fact, one of our jobs as rangers is to go out in the morning and catalogue where  the fog is on that day. Usually it hangs out in the swamps, but lot’s of times you’ll find it in the cliffs, or on the water. If the fog gets to the Pines the whole park has to go on lockdown. I haven’t been here long enough to find out why though, Phil says I don’t want to know. But we track the fog's movements and we’ve got a sign at the front of the park with exchangeable place name cards to warn visitors where the fog might be. 

Welcome to Richard L. Hornberry State Park: Today The Fog is in [         ]. 

But it almost always stays in the swamps or out on the lake. 

Then of course there are the various creatures that people see from time to time. If the same creature is reported enough we add it to the catalogue and name it. In the swamps there’s supposedly a fifty foot alligator. Which of course is ridiculous, I’ve seen it myself and it can’t be a foot over forty. His name is Gary and occasionally if one of those talking crows gets a little too personal with one of us rangers we will go down and feed it to Gary. The only other creature that has a name is of course the lake monster. His name is Ricky. Ricky looks a lot like the Loch Ness monster, he’s a bit of a rip off to be honest. But Ricky has become the park’s mascot of sorts. We’ve got little cartoon drawings of him everywhere and signs, even some stuffed animal toys. There’s a big cartoon of him on a wooden cut out on every beach that says “Don’t swim alone kids!” The sign used to read, “If you swim alone, Ricky will swim with you” but that sign unfortunately had the opposite effect of the one intended. “The Incident of 97” Phil calls it. I don’t know, like I said I’m aware of the birds and the forty foot alligator, and of course the squirrel pile, but really I don’t know about the whole Ricky thing. Get real am I right?

While I haven’t seen Ricky per se I know what I saw this morning, I know I saw a tentacle dragging a boat to the bottom of the lake. I really don’t know what to think of that. Ricky is like a plesiosaur or something, those don’t have tentacles. I don’t know. 

My first year here it took me a very long time to get used to all of the weird stuff. I can remember gasping in horror at my first sighting of The Squirrel Pile, feeling overwhelmed when my compass just stopped working in the middle of a hike, and how uneasy I felt when I first
heard that uncanny singing out on the lake. Now though, two years in, all that stuff is just daily routine. 

“Yes I’m aware of the pile of squirrels. No, there’s nothing we can do about.” I answer phone calls like that all the time. 

“No I don’t know how the crows know your daughter’s name, I’m very sorry for your loss.” Classic crow move. They say ominous stuff all the time but their party trick is dead relatives. 

Anyway, I thought I would keep an online journal of sorts. One of my coworkers suggested it to me. Ellen. I think I might do just about anything Ellen wanted me to. Just about. Ellen. Yeah. 

As I was saying I think I’m gonna keep updating this blog or whatever you want to call it, are blogs even a thing anymore? Since the events that make up my day to day are so strange I thought that this little subreddit might be the best place for it. 

Until next time
James.
