It was a bright crimson red. The knob was a tarnished bronze. It didn't make sense, it was installed into the wall in such a way you should be able to see from the outside but couldn't. It was ominous, almost begging to be opened. 

I left the attic. Convinced myself I never noticed the door before. How often do I really go up there anyway? 

It wasn't till late that there was knocking throughout the house. No one was at the front door but the knocking continued. It came from above me. 

The baseball bat my father I used to play with was clutched close to my chest. The rickety ladder flexed with my weight as my head popped up over the lip of the hatch. The knocking didn't stop. The door towered in the dark over cardboard boxes filled with forgotten memories, and furniture bought but still hungered to be used. 

It was then that the knob of the door twisted. I sprung up. Went for the door. Prayed it was locked. It wasn't. The door opened a crack. Enough for a bright red light to shine out. Threw my entire body against the door to slam it shut. The thin line between myself and it was about to be ripped wide open. I pushed. It pushed back harder. 

My feet begin to slip out from under me. "Go away!" I screamed. My shoulders buckled and my head slammed against the door as it swung open. 

Flat on the ground. I reached for my bat in a desperate attempt to defend myself from whatever walked out.

The door was gone. Only myself, the attic, and the tight grip on my shoulder.

"Thank you" A soft whisper in my ears before deafening silence. Its hands gripped tight around my throat. My vision blurred and my head was about to explode like a balloon overfilled with helium. Pop. Pop. I struggled against their grip, trying to kick behind me. It was like fighting a brick wall.

Ten year old me and my dad on our way back home. My PSP and warm bag of McDonald's fries in my lap. Uncle Cracker played over the radio, as my dad silently sang along.

“You alright, do I have ketchup on my face?” He said, catching me staring at him. He looked so alive, so real.

“I- I’d..” His smile was very gentle and short lived, it twisted into a crooked grin, His teeth sharpened. 

“Thank you, Jimmy” in a low tone before springing up with hands going for my throat. I screamed, finding myself on the floor of the attic. The door was gone and my throat hoarse.

Even three weeks later, the hand prints are still around my throat like a tattoo that will never go away. Wherever I go, a faint knocking still follows me around. I can’t sleep, not anywhere.

Tell me what I can do? I want to just live my life so any advice is welcomed.
