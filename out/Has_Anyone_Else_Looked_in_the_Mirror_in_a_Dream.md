Last night, I had a dream... well, more of a nightmare. I will refrain from adding context of the dream, because I know you are all here to know what I saw in the mirror. In the mirror, I saw myself, but looking back, it was not me. Not quite at least. Looking back at me, wasalmost me, but there were a few obvious and notable details that were different from the real me.

First off, I was missing all my teeth. That, although sounding creepy, was not actually creepy. It matched up perfectly with the context of the nightmare. My teeth in that nightmare were falling out from some weird plant. Importantly, I looked the same age as I am. But, my eyes. The left eye was blue, exactly like both my eyes in real life, but my right eye was green. Also, my hair was the same length as it should have been, and just as straight as it should have been, but... it was... ginger hair. I am a brunette. Another difference I noticed is that my scar, from the second time I cracked my skull, which happened 7 years ago... was on the left side of my face, when it should have been on the right side of my face. Other than that, the scar was completely identical.  Oh, I must not forget to mention, I did not have normal ears.  My ears were just small holes in the side of my head, more resemblant of gills, except only one on each side.  Finally, I did not have eyebrows.  In their place, I had scars.  The scars appeared to be from fire burns, as if my eyebrows in the dream had been burnt off, yet there was no other signs of scarring on my face, which makes it creepy for what story happened to the eyebrows of the version of me in my dream.  Nothing preceding that in the dream suggested anything of how I would have had those scars, and weirdly, no one else in the dream had missing eyebrows.

When I woke up, I immediately looked in the mirror. Not out of impulse, but because my wardrobe is a mirror.  I was horrified by what I saw.  My face looked exactly like the one I saw in my dream, rather than the one I look at in the mirror every day. The only difference from the face I saw in my dream was... I still had my teeth. I remembered in the dream that the date was Thursday, 27th October, 2067. I checked the date. It said Friday, 28th October, 2067, yet in both the dream and my awakened reality, I looked about 14, in 2067. I am currently 14, on this date, Friday, 29th September, 2023. I would have been 58! Yet I looked 14, in 2067!

Whatever you do, I must warn you. When you are dreaming, whatever it is that you do within the dream, please, for your own sake and the sake's of those around you, do not, ever, look in the mirror.  At least not until you are certain that you are awake and seeing the real you.
