Day 1.

I started journaling. Not because I wanted to, but because I read some productivity guru talking about "morning pages" — three pages, longhand, first thing after waking up. It was supposed to unlock creativity or mental clarity or whatever. I don’t know. I just figured I’d try it because my life felt like it was running in circles, and maybe writing things down would help.



Day 2.

Something weird happened. I woke up, reached for my notebook, and found an entry already written. \*\*In my handwriting.\*\* It said:



 "You're going to check your phone first before writing today. You always do. You'll tell yourself it's 'just for a second' but you'll scroll for an hour, then feel guilty and rush through this entry like it's homework. Also, you won’t exercise today, even though you swore you would. Again."



I felt sick reading it. Because that \*was\* my plan. I was literally reaching for my phone when I saw it. My fingers hovered over the screen. I put the phone down. I wrote in the journal instead. It freaked me out, sure, but I reasoned that I must’ve written it last night and forgotten. Some weird note to myself.



Day 3.

Another pre-written entry. More predictions:



"You'll waste an hour debating whether this is supernatural or just dissociation. You won’t consider the possibility that your entire life is like this—pre-scripted, predictable, robotic. And once you finish thinking about it, you'll still check your phone first thing."



I grabbed my phone.



Day 5.

The entries are getting more aggressive.



"You think this is about the journal. It’s not. This is about \*\*you\*\*. You live the same day over and over again. You talk about wanting change, but you’re just running a script. You’d rather believe in ghosts than believe in your own subconscious patterns."



I slammed the journal shut. I told myself I wouldn’t read it tomorrow. But the thought lingered: \*What if it's right?\*



Day 7.

The journal knew something specific today.



"You’ll see her at the grocery store. The girl you still think about sometimes. You’ll replay old conversations, imagine scenarios where things went differently. You’ll do this instead of actually speaking to her. And then you’ll go home and write about how ‘life is unfair.’"



That one pissed me off. Because it happened.



Day 10.

I tried to outsmart the journal. I stayed up all night, waiting, watching. Nothing happened. I went to sleep at 6 AM, woke up at 9.



New entry:



"Nice try. But you’re still trapped in the loop. You still won’t talk to her. You still won’t change. You still won’t work on that thing you keep saying you want to do. You think you’re awake, but you’re sleepwalking."



I decided right then: I was going to break the pattern.



Day 12.

I ignored the journal. Didn’t open it. Didn’t write. I felt a quiet sense of victory, like I had taken control.



Day 13.

Curiosity got the better of me. I opened the journal.



 "Skipping the journal doesn’t change anything if you’re still following the same script. You're still making excuses. You think ignoring me is the same as proving me wrong. It isn't."



I snapped it shut.



Day 15.

I’m done fighting it. I’m changing everything. No more routines. No more predictions. No more being the same person every day.



I grab my pen, open the journal.



There’s already a new entry.



"No, you won’t."
