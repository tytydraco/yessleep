Hi nosleep, I'm Johno. In my younger years I had an experience I can only describe as paranormal and non euclidian? Like a glitch in the matrix that is still messing with me to this day. I've had restless nightmares about it, I can't forget any of the details despite it being so long ago, and I have a deep rooted fear of shopping centers that now effects my daily life.

If anyone here is Australian, and knows of or has been to the Narandjirri shopping centre, have you had a similar experience? How do I make it stop?

This story takes place in December of 2010, I’m 20 as of writing. The Aldis my mum shopped at was at the edge of the food court and directly in front of a small play area for young children. For a local centre, the play area was absolutely fantastic. Spiralling tunnels of every color, rickety rocking bridges you wandered across on the balls of your feet. Vivid plastic games that never had a second player. It went two levels high and a winding slide from its peak could deliver you back down to the open arms of your loving mum. 



Every day I came with mum to Narandjirri, each time I bolted into the playspace. I roamed its plastic corridors and braved the slide. Every day my mother waited for me at its mouth. 

Until Sunday. 

  


I finished my voyage to the slides end, but was not met with my mother’s open arms that day. I was met with nothing. The shutter doors of Aldi had rolled closed, the lights of the butcher were dim, the air was still from the silence. The piercing stare of the Virgin Mary was the only gaze that met mine. I still see how the amber light that now filled the room lit her face. It cast a shadow on her that intensified her stare and darkened the baby Jesus’ face to a point where the wax looked warped and inhuman. 

I was afraid, so I retreated back into the play-area, subverted from calling my mothers name by the waiting faces of the figures in the nativity scene.

I crawled to the back corner, refixing my gaze on the nativity scene through the thin fabric mesh. 

The back wall was not that fabric meshy texture, it was solid bright green plastic. That kind that playgrounds had that seemed to manifest bruises from even the mildest contact. I felt my back press against it as my breathing began accelerating. This was at the time, the most afraid I had been in my entire life. I struggled to pull my gaze from the eyes of Mary. The gradual fading of the amber light only made her pull on my eyes more intense, as the shadows crept below her lip and hair the nativity scene became drenched in pitch darkness, the only light now a dying service light between my fortress and the gate of Aldi.

I felt hot sweat begin to prick at me below my shirt as a slight scratch of my underarm devolved into a panicked fit of clawing at my back and thighs. The moments of direct setting sunlight through the skylights of the food court had made the absence of air conditioning even more intense, and the cool night air did not show itself nearly as swiftly as the sun set or the centre secluded. The mind of a 5 year old, and my memory now is not reliable, but I am assured that no matter how absurd or impossible, in the mere moments I was in the slide, the store had closed and dusk had come.



The sun had fully set now, but it only felt as if a few minutes had passed since I exited the slide, my only light the service light and my only security the plastic walls of the play space. The service light dimly lit the edges of Mary's face. I saw no purity, no motherly love in her gaze.

I scraped my gaze down towards the manger. There was no baby Jesus anymore.



A cool fear ran its icy fingers down my moist spine as I whipped my gaze from Mary to my surroundings. My flurries of breath were now echoing in the reaches of the court. Fear had locked the doorless exit of the fortress, an invisible wall now keeping me from running out into the deserted food court, towards glass gates leading to the starless night. Or was instinct keeping me inside? The events that had transpired were impossible, nightmarish. 

Logic was no longer a factor in my naive mind as I looked towards the lip of the slide to my right. The slide had brought me to this twisted world, the slide would let me out. I began to crawl towards the platforms that took me to the next storey, but I was not met with the slides open maw. Instead, it was almost an identical replication of floor one, except there was no entry. As I crawled, panic made it feel as if the walls tightened around me.

What was once a comfortable standing height for my small figure was now a near crouch squat-run. My new posture made the platform feel longer as the sweat on my knees made me stick to the PVC floors as I crawled to the next set of platforms. I dragged myself up the now tighter squeeze. 



I still, in perfect detail, can recall the airy hopelessness that grew from within me as I perked my head up to see the new third level. A sort of weightlessness that washed over me, I couldn’t feel the beads of sweat coldly ride down my sides, my breathing went still as I sucked in as much air as my little lungs let me. Warm urine saturated my shorts. The hall was impossibly long, and had never existed until now. 

The coldness became a chill once again and my weight returned beckoned by the sound of two sets of slapping on the sweat laced vinyl floors. The slapping got louder as I heard it move towards where the platforms to the second floor were. It came from below. For now, but with each slap it was as if momentum built and it got faster. 

The vinyl burned my skin as friction resisted my scrambling knees. I hurried as fast as I possibly could as the slapping crawled up to the third level. 

Wax on leather.



As I crawl-ran I noticed the outside surroundings of the food court moved with me, the flickering service light occasionally soaking me in a terrifying darkness. That’s when I heard it. Its slaps were now as loud as a yell as they rose to the same level.

I heard the slaps splash in the pool of my urine as wet denim chafed my thighs. Pure unbridled dread made every noise, the slapping, the whir of the emergency light, the rubbery screeches of skin on vinyl it all reverberated through each wall of my skull as I felt the impact of the slaps vibrate in the tips of my toes. 

I threw myself up to the fourth level and felt vomit well to my throat and choke me as every noise subsided. The service light flickered one final time before suffocating me in complete isolated darkness. I could only taste my vomit as I heard my viscera slap against the lower vinyl platforms and drip back down to the third storey. I blindly waved my hands to find a wall to guide myself with as I continued forward. My chin was sticky with vomit, my thighs were chafed, my knees stung with friction burn, my socks were soaked in urine and my vomit. I wept as I continued forward in an awkward half crawl that only seemed to lower as I felt the PVC roof lower and pluck my hairs from the drag. 

I was stunned as I felt cold hard plastic smack against my sticky forehead, and tears began to stream down my face as I sobbed uncontrollably. It was the hard plastic of the slide. I felt the cylindrical opening and despite being in pitch darkness, closed my eyes in the hopes I would wake up from this nightmare. 



As I slid I heard the slapping, as loud and as close as ever as the impact went from wet pvc to humid plastic, the slide stuck to my legs slowing me down as I scooched and bopped myself forward. The arc of the slide was levelling, getting flatter and flatter, but I saw no daylight. I was still in the slide. 

I screamed and it reverberated back into my ears as I felt a white hot pain pierce into my back. I desperately shuffled forward on what was now just a flat tunnel. Screaming and begging for my mother. I felt the back of my shirt get damp as I wriggled and writhed, the slapping deafening and behind me keeping pace with me, until the slapping stopped and I felt my stomach press against my lungs as the slide dropped, the skin of my calves seared as I felt my skin writhe against the hot slide. The force intensified and I began uncontrollably bouncing, my head rebounding left and right as the cylinder tightened around me. I choked on my scream as I realised I could hear another scream beside me. As I continued to plummet the screams became an incoherent symphony of emotions unreadable to a 5 year old boy.



A part of me is still in that slide, that playground. Still screaming and falling. I never remembered leaving the slide. I remember exiting the playground but how is a mystery. 

My eyes never met the nativity scene as I walked away clutching my mothers hand, I never looked back to the play area or my rickety bridge. I held my mothers soft hands and never returned to Narandjirri Shopping Centre.
