Like a lot of people, I drive to get from my job to my home and back. I tend to see cars, trees, birds, the usual. The occasional deer even so I never really thought anything was wrong but that was until I get home. I as walk up the stairs to my room, I realize I saw a deer. A memory flashes into my head of seeing just a lone deer alongside a road just grazing on some grass but it feels like I just saw. I guess I saw it on my way home today? The memory seems weird though, just popping up now.

The next day I drive to work and keep an eye out for deer. If there was one yesterday, there may be more today. The area around my home tends to get a lot of deer coming through the more the year goes on. My mom always seems to see some each day despite the fact I only see some like once every two weeks. I get in and get ready in the back to start cooking like normal.

A couple hours in, I get the same sensation again that I just saw a deer. Unlike yesterday, where I chalked it up to me just remembering it because the stairway carpet is somewhat the same color of a deers fur when the stairway gets dark, I am currently cutting tomato's and nothing of that color is in sight. I look up through the order window or whatever people call it to see if a deer was in the parking lot in the windows across the lobby but I saw nothing. The memory was of a deer in a field this time which makes no sense. Unlike yesterday, the deer is not grazing but appears to be looking off to the side. 

Dwelling on it really made it har to focus and I got a couple orders wrong. I left at around 8 since it was one of my shorter days and went home. I did not get any more memories but I did see a trio of deer in our backyard. It ain't like a field but it aint small either. Plenty of space. The deer fled as I pulled up the driveway. When I parked, there were none left. As I fell asleep, I had a dream. Nothing crazy and surprisingly not deer related, I think. It was just me walking through a field, into a house similar to mine and staring at a bed. Not much else and definitely not the weirdest yet.

I woke up the next day and got ready but as I got in my car, I noticed that there was a deer in the yard. Just standing there by itself and surprisingly did not flee as I turned on my car. I backed up and left not thinking much of it besides that it might be an unfortunate deer with that wasting disease if it did not run. Today felt different though, especially since I kept seeing a bunch more lonesome deer walking around. I guess this must be what my mother is like some days, just constantly seeing deer. I even thought one got hit because I drove past one in the middle of the road, just standing there when a car passed me going the other way. Looking back, I saw the car did not swerve but the deer was now alongside the road, thankfully appearing unharmed.

As I got to work, I asked my boss if they have seen all the deer that have been wandering around but surprisingly, they have not. I guess my luck must be like my mother's if I am seeing all these deer now. Annoyingly though, it is distracting to see deer walking in the parking lot, especially since i am working the register today.

Leaving for home, there is another deer, this time standing next to my car. As I approach, it bolts running across the road and nearly getting hit by a car that does not break or honk. Really did not care about hitting that deer I guess. I get home and decide to go lay down since my head feels like it is swimming. At some point I must have passed out because I awoke to find it dark and it looked like something was standing next to my bed. I turn on my phones flashlight to see the face of a deer staring at me in bed. I call for my mom but she either is still not home or is sound asleep. I try and look away from the deer but I still see it. It's in front of me still. I turn my head again, still there. I try and get up but I feel it ram it's head into my gut, sending me back onto my bed. I blink and it get closer. 

I close my eyes and open them, hoping it's a bad dream but as I open my eyes, all I see is that deer In my face, unblinking. And all I feel, is my chest as the hooves press down more like it cracking my ribcage as it begins to jump up and down. And my head throbs in pain like never before. If this is a nightmare, I know now that I will never wake up because I no longer see anything but a deer, I think nothing but about this deer, and I feel nothing but the pain in my chest as a deer is sitting on my heart.
