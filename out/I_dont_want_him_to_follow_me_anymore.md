My dad is a strict religious man who only wants the best from his family. He was ridiculed at 5ft 9inches he was considered very short for a "real man", even though he was stunning platinum blonde hair with bright blue eyes and intellectual ability to match he was the catch for the church girls. My mum however was not a church girl in fact she was the opposite she had dark curly hair and wild green eyes she was a proud Wicca and a sinner in my father's family's eyes.

They met young in college I think my dad thought he could change her to become a great Christian woman like his family said he needed but my mother she was headstrong always independent even after she had me.

I look like her you know dark curly hair with green eyes, I've seen pictures. I'm not as spontaneous as my mother was I like things to be organised like my dad I guess, but I don't really know I never really knew my mother she died when I was 6 from an o.d 

I was 9 when it started he brought me this plush bunny and told me that I will be the woman of the house one day.

I was so excited until I understood what that meant for me, I didn't know until I was 12 and had my first period, that's when he entered my room and told me it was time to be the woman of the house and his wife, a week later he entered more then my room.

By the time I was 16 I had missed so many days of school because of broken bones and bruising I wasn't sure I would graduate.

By then I'd had enough, I stayed home from school stated I wanted to be home with my daddy, he was more then happy for me to be with him, that means playtime. I waited in my red top and jeans and a plush bunny like always, only this time was different. 

I had a drink prepared for him one of Vermont and gin and a special ingredient. As I sat in my lingerie waiting he drank fast so it didn't take long for the water hemlock to take effect.

My very blonde hair blue eyed children received a quick death, it wasn't there fault thier dad was a scoundrel. And the ones that didn't have some illness because of the incest the others had a mental illness. In the end it didn't matter they all look like him, he follows me.

I was as surprised as you when I didn't get charged as an adult I got charged as a minor even at 21 they sent me to a mental facility. It doesn't matter he follows where I am.

Rich was nice to me at starshine, gave me extra jelly and extra drawing time. He even sat and talked with me, which was fine until I saw him again, I had to stop him I control what happens now.

This rich had a key to my freedom, so I left and took the money and fake Id for a girl that looks like me, guess this rich had things I could use they all do. 

So here I am with my new passport a ticket to a non extradition country, I will be free of him finally. But I must make sure this blonde haired blue eyed 8 yr old doesn't follow me first. Because he always follows
