The first time it happened, I thought it was just a bad dream.

I woke up in my bed, drenched in sweat, heart racing. The room was dark except for a sliver of moonlight slipping through the blinds. Something felt off. The air was thick, stifling, like I was being smothered by an invisible weight. I reached for my phone, but it wasn’t on my nightstand.

“Hello?” I called out, though I wasn’t sure who I expected to answer. The silence was deafening.

Then I heard it—a faint creak, like footsteps on old wood, coming from the hallway. My breath caught in my throat. I told myself it was the house settling or the wind, but deep down, I knew better.

I sat up, legs trembling as I swung them over the side of the bed. The floor was cold beneath my feet. I crept toward the door, every instinct screaming at me to stay put. As I opened it, the hallway stretched out before me, impossibly long and dimly lit by a flickering bulb.

“Who’s there?” My voice barely rose above a whisper.

A shadow darted at the edge of my vision. My pulse thundered in my ears as I followed it, each step heavier than the last. I turned a corner and saw it—a figure standing at the end of the hallway. It was tall and shrouded in darkness, its features obscured. But its eyes—oh, God, its eyes—glowed like dying embers.

It moved toward me without a sound. My body locked up, frozen in place. As it drew closer, I tried to scream, but no sound came out. Its hand—if you could call it that—reached out for me, long and skeletal, and the moment it touched my chest, I felt an icy grip seize my heart.

I woke up gasping, clutching my chest. I was back in my bed, the room exactly as it had been before. Relief flooded through me as I realized it was just a nightmare. But then I heard the creak again.

“No,” I whispered, shaking my head. “No, no, no.”

I opened the door, and there it was—the same impossibly long hallway, the flickering bulb, the oppressive silence. I wanted to turn back, to stay in my room and hide, but something pulled me forward. I followed the same shadow, saw the same figure, felt the same icy grip.

And then I woke up again.

This time, I didn’t waste a second. I jumped out of bed, ran to the door, and yanked it open, hoping to find something—anything—different. But the hallway was still there, stretching endlessly into darkness.

It didn’t matter what I tried. Hiding under the covers, locking the door, screaming for help—none of it worked. Every time I "woke up," I was right back where I started, trapped in this endless loop. And the figure... it was always waiting for me.

One night—or day? I had no way of knowing anymore—I decided to face it. I stood in the hallway, trembling but determined. “What do you want?” I shouted, my voice echoing off the walls.

The figure stopped, just a few feet away, its glowing eyes boring into mine. For the first time, it spoke, its voice a guttural whisper that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once.

“You cannot wake... because you are already awake.”

I felt the floor give way beneath me, and I was falling, plunging into a darkness so complete it felt like drowning.

And then I woke up.

But this time, something was different. The room was darker than before, the shadows longer and deeper. And on my nightstand, where my phone should have been, sat a single object: a key, old and rusted.

I don’t know what it unlocks, but I’m terrified to find out. Because the creak in the hallway is louder now, and the footsteps are closer.

This time, I don’t think I’ll wake up again.
