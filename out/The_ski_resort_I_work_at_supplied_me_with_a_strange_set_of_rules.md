Hi Reddit,  
My name is Emma, and I don’t even know how to start this. If this post makes it out there, I need you to believe me. I need someone to believe me. I’m writing this from the supply closet in the basement of Ridgeview Ski Resort, Don't try to look it up, please don't make the same mistake as I.  
God I'm stupid I don't even know why I stayed after day one perhaps because of the good pay..

Here’s how it all started.

Two weeks ago, I got a job at this ski resort. The pay was good, and I thought it would be a fun, picturesque way to spend the winter, surrounded by snow-covered mountains and fresh air. The idea of being in a cozy lodge, watching the snow fall outside while the guests enjoyed their stay, seemed perfect. It was the kind of job you think about when you're trying to escape the grind of city life, and everything about it felt like a dream. My first day was typical: I met the team, got my uniform, went through the usual onboarding stuff. The whole thing felt like a normal first day at a new job—nothing unusual, nothing out of the ordinary.

But that all changed at the end of the day.

Pete, the manager, a wiry guy with a sharp, calculating gaze, called me into his office just before I was about to leave. He’s one of those people who gives off a strange vibe, the kind of person who makes you feel like you’re always being watched. He handed me a laminated sheet of paper without saying a word, his fingers stiff and cold as he passed it over. I noticed his eyes, dark and unreadable, never left mine.

“These are the rules,” he said, his voice flat, almost too serious. “Follow them to the letter, or you won’t last here.”

At first, I thought it was some kind of weird hazing, a test to see if I was taking the job seriously. It’s not unusual for a new employee to be given a set of strange instructions or odd tasks. But something in Pete’s tone made me pause. He wasn’t joking. There was no warmth in his words, no sign of humor in his eyes. It felt... wrong, like he was telling me something I wasn’t supposed to hear.

I took the paper from him, my fingers brushing against the cold laminate, trying to brush it off. “Rules are no problem,” I said, forcing a smile, hoping to lighten the mood. But Pete didn’t smile. His eyes remained cold, piercing, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was somehow being warned about something I had no understanding of yet.

As I walked away, holding that sheet of paper, I couldn’t help but glance at it. I didn’t know it at the time, but that was the moment everything started to change. Something told me that I should’ve paid more attention to those rules.

The list looked like this:

1. Do not whistle while working, especially after sunset.
2. If you see a child alone on the slopes, do not approach them. Report it immediately and leave the area.
3. Never turn off the lights in the staff lodge, even if you’re the last one there.
4. If you hear music coming from an empty cabin, do not investigate. Notify Pete immediately.
5. Do not use the ski lift alone after 9:00 PM. If you find yourself on it, do not look down.
6. Avoid mirrors in the staff bathrooms after midnight.
7. If a guest asks you for directions to "the old lodge," pretend you didn’t hear them and walk away.
8. Do not take photos of the forest or the mountain at dusk.
9. If you find a pair of skis standing upright in the snow with no one around, leave the area as quickly as possible.
10. Never, under any circumstances, speak about the “white shadow” to anyone.

The first few days were uneventful. I stayed inside after sunset, ignored any strange noises, and avoided the mirrors in the staff lodge after midnight. It was easy enough to follow the rules… until it wasn’t.

The first rule I broke was #1.

It was my third night, and I was clearing snow off the lodge steps while humming absentmindedly. The cold bit at my fingers, and my breath puffed in front of me in tiny clouds. Without realizing it, I started to whistle a tune—something cheerful to distract me from the freezing air. It wasn’t until the third or fourth note that I noticed the change.

The wind stopped.

Not just slowed or died down, but *stopped*. The air became unnaturally still, and it felt like the entire mountain was holding its breath. My own whistle cut off abruptly as I looked around, heart pounding. That’s when I heard it.

A low, guttural whistle echoed back, coming from somewhere deep in the forest. It wasn’t a mimic of my tune; it was jagged and wrong, like the sound was being dragged out of something that wasn’t meant to whistle. I froze, my breath caught in my chest, as the sound grew louder, closer. The trees at the edge of the forest seemed darker now, their branches twisting unnaturally, reaching toward me.

Then something moved. A shadow, tall and spindly, darting between the trunks too fast for me to make out. My legs felt like lead, but I forced myself to move, stumbling back up the steps and into the lodge. I slammed the door behind me and locked it, leaning against it as I tried to catch my breath.

Inside, the lodge was silent. Too silent. The usual creaks and groans of the old building were absent, and I could hear my heartbeat pounding in my ears. I peeked out the window, my breath fogging the glass. For a moment, I thought I saw a figure standing at the edge of the tree line, but when I blinked, it was gone.

The rest of the night, I stayed huddled by the fireplace, every light in the lodge turned on. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was watching me, circling just out of sight. The windows… they felt like eyes, and every so often, I’d catch a flicker of movement in the corner of my vision. Too fast to be human. Too deliberate to be the wind.

A few days later, I was working the western slopes when I spotted something unusual. It was one of those rare, eerily silent moments on the mountain. The wind had died down, and even the usual rustle of trees was absent, as if the whole area was holding its breath. That’s when I saw her: a small child sitting alone on the side of the slope, knees drawn up to her chest. Her old-fashioned ski outfit stood out immediately—it looked like something out of a vintage photograph, the kind you’d see in the lodge’s historical display cases. The colors were faded, the fabric oddly pristine, as though untouched by time or snow.

She didn’t seem cold, despite the chill in the air. Her pale face was tilted down, but her eyes… something about them was wrong. They weren’t crying or red from the cold. No, they seemed dull, almost lifeless, but at the same time… alert? Watching? It’s hard to explain, but they made my skin crawl. She wasn’t moving, just sitting there, perfectly still like she was waiting for something—or someone.

Instinctively, I almost called out to her. My first thought was that she might be lost or hurt. But as I opened my mouth, a cold dread settled over me, freezing the words in my throat. My gut twisted as Rule #2 flashed in my mind: *Don’t engage with anyone who shouldn’t be there.*

I fumbled for my radio, my hands shaking slightly as I adjusted the dial. "Pete?" My voice came out quieter than I intended. "There’s a kid on the western slope, sitting by herself. Looks… off. Old gear, pale face. What do I do?"

Pete’s response was immediate and sharp. "Leave. Right now. Don’t look at her. Don’t talk to her. Just go."

The urgency in his voice sent a shiver down my spine. Without another word, I turned my skis downhill and started gliding away as fast as I could without losing control. Every nerve in my body screamed to look back, to confirm she was still there… or gone. But I didn’t. I focused on the path ahead, each movement deliberate, keeping my breathing steady despite the pounding of my heart.

And yet, I could *feel* her. That cold, intense gaze boring into my back like icy needles. It was as if her eyes were tethered to me, tracking my every move. My legs burned as I pushed myself harder, willing the slope to stretch further, faster, to get away from whatever I’d just seen.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, I reached the base of the slope and dared to glance over my shoulder. The spot where she’d been was empty. No sign of the child, no disturbed snow, no tracks leading away. Just undisturbed white, pristine and eerily quiet.

I stood there for a moment, catching my breath, the radio still clutched in my hand. "Pete," I said, my voice trembling slightly. "She’s gone."

There was a long pause before Pete responded. When he did, his voice was low and steady, but there was an edge to it. "Good. Stick to the main trails for the rest of your shift. And remember the rules. Always."

The next one I broke was #3.

It was late, and I’d been the last one in the staff lodge again. Exhausted, I flipped off the lights as I left, forgetting the rule entirely. For a moment, the darkness was absolute, heavy like a physical presence pressing against me. Then, I felt it—a weight, like something was standing inches behind me. My breath hitched, and a chill crawled up my spine, so sharp and sudden it almost stole my balance.

I froze, every instinct screaming at me to run, but my body wouldn’t move. My ears strained against the silence, desperate to catch a sound—any sound—but there was nothing. The stillness was deafening, amplifying the pounding of my heart. Slowly, I forced my legs to move, bolting for the exit as panic clawed at the edges of my mind. My fingers fumbled with the keys, slippery with sweat despite the cold. My hands were trembling so badly it took three tries to get the key into the lock.

As soon as I got outside, the lights inside flickered back on by themselves. The sudden brightness poured through the lodge’s windows, throwing everything inside into sharp relief. At first glance, it seemed normal—empty, still—but as my gaze lingered, I noticed something. A shadow, impossibly long and spindly, seemed to ripple against the far wall before it slipped out of sight into the deeper darkness.

I staggered back, the door swinging shut behind me with a dull thud. My breath came in shallow gasps as I turned and walked quickly, almost stumbling, toward my car. I didn’t stop moving until I was halfway across the lot, where I finally dared to glance back.

The lodge stood there, silent and still, its lights steady as though nothing had happened. But I knew better now. I knew to never forget the rules again.  
The worst was when I broke Rule #4.

It was late last night, and I was finishing up in the lounge after a long shift. The flickering of the fire and the hum of the lights were the only sounds in the otherwise quiet lodge. As I was gathering my things, I heard faint music drifting in from outside, a soft, eerie melody that seemed to float through the air. At first, I thought it was just the wind playing tricks on me, but the closer I listened, the clearer it became. The sound was coming from Cabin 3 — and I knew that cabin was unoccupied.

Curiosity gnawed at me. I knew I should ignore it. After all, everyone who worked here knew Rule #4: Never enter an unoccupied cabin, no matter what. It was the most sacred of rules, one passed down from older co-workers, one that have been around for a while. There were stories, of course, rumors about strange happenings in the cabins that no one could explain. But they were just stories trying to scare the newbies, weren’t they?

I tried to convince myself to let it go, to leave well enough alone. But the music…it pulled me in. I couldn't resist. So, against my better judgment, I grabbed my jacket and headed outside, the cold night air nipping at my skin.

As I approached Cabin 3, the door was ajar, and the music grew louder, almost as if it were beckoning me. I hesitated for a moment, but my feet moved forward, drawn by some unseen force. The door creaked as I pushed it open further. Inside, the air was stale, but not as musty as I expected for a cabin that had been abandoned. The only light came from the dim glow of the moon filtering through the windows, casting long shadows across the wooden floor.

At first, I didn’t see anything unusual. The room was empty, the furniture covered in dust sheets, the fireplace cold and unused. But then I noticed the record player in the corner, a vintage model that looked out of place among the abandoned furniture. The needle was stuck on a warped vinyl, spinning in slow, uneven circles. The music it produced was haunting, beautiful, but utterly wrong. Each note felt dissonant, like it was trying to reach something but couldn’t.

I stood there, rooted to the spot, the melody filling the space around me, twisting the air. It was a sound that seeped into your bones, making your skin crawl, but also pulling you deeper. I didn’t know why I was still standing there, but I couldn’t tear myself away. Something about the music felt familiar, like I’d heard it before, but from a lifetime ago.

Then, as I turned to leave, the door slammed shut behind me with a violent thud, startling me so much I almost jumped out of my skin. My heart began to race, my breath quickening as I fumbled with the handle. The door wouldn’t budge. Panic surged through me, and I yanked harder, but the door remained closed, as though something — or someone — was holding it shut from the other side. The music hadn’t stopped. If anything, it had grown louder, more insistent, almost mocking.

I don’t remember exactly how I got out. One moment, I was frantically pulling at the door, and the next, I was standing in the dark, cold night again, gasping for breath. My mind was a blur. I didn’t even remember the walk back to the lodge, but somehow, I found myself at the front door, my hand still trembling as I knocked.

Pete was waiting for me when I stepped inside. He didn’t say a word. He didn’t need to. His gaze was enough — that look of disappointment, like he already knew what I’d done. Like he could see the mistake I’d made before I even had the chance to say anything. His eyes didn’t hold anger, only this deep, quiet understanding of how foolish I’d been. And then, just like that, he turned and walked away without a word.

The air in the lodge felt heavy, thicker than it had before. As I stood there, the music from Cabin 3 still echoing in my mind, I realized just how badly I’d broken Rule #4. And how, in doing so, I might have just sealed my fate.

That night I almost broke Rule #5, too.

The ski lift is the fastest way to get back to the cabins after a late shift, especially when the snow is thick and the air is biting cold. I’d been considering it all evening as I glanced at the clock on the wall: 9:12 PM. I was tired, and the idea of a quick ride up seemed almost too tempting to pass up. But then I hesitated. It wasn’t the safest option. I knew I should hike instead. So, with a sigh, I pulled on my gloves and grabbed my bag, setting out on the trail.

The path was quieter than usual, the snow crunching softly beneath my boots. Halfway up, though, something made me stop. I looked up, and that's when I saw it: the ski lift moving, its creaky sound breaking the stillness of the night. No one was supposed to be on it that late. It was far too late for anyone to be up there, especially alone.

Yet, there was a figure—a pale blur—sitting in one of the chairs. It didn’t move like a person. It was unnaturally still, almost as if the figure were searching for something. Or someone. The way it shifted and swayed in the chair, its head turning slowly as though scanning the dark, made my heart race. It didn’t look human, not fully. There was something off about it, like a shadow more than a person, a distortion in the night.

My breath caught in my throat as I stared at it, frozen in place. It was moving slowly but deliberately, as if it knew exactly what it was doing. I could feel my pulse quicken. I’m sure it would have seen me if I’d taken the lift. It would’ve been impossible to miss me, and I wasn’t sure what would’ve happened if it had.

Instead, I kept my eyes on it for as long as I dared, then turned away, my legs trembling as I continued up the trail. The lift kept moving in the corner of my vision, but I didn’t look back again. Something told me that if I did, it would be the last time I’d feel safe in that place.

Then came Rule #6.

It was just past midnight, and I’d just finished a long shift. My body ached, my mind was numb, and all I wanted was to wash up and unwind. The staff bathroom was the only place open at that hour, so I made my way down the dimly lit hallway, the fluorescent lights buzzing faintly overhead. It was eerily quiet, too quiet for that time of night, and the familiar creaks and groans of the old lodge felt unsettling as I entered the bathroom.

I knew better than to look directly into the mirrors, though. Rule #6 was clear about that. It was one of those things that everyone learned quickly when they started working here. There were whispers, of course—stories about what happened to those who stared too long at their own reflection, about the things that didn’t reflect back. But I’d always assumed they were just old superstitions. After all, mirrors are just mirrors, right?

I kept my head down, focused on the sink as I turned on the faucet, the cold water splashing over my hands and face. I closed my eyes for a moment, letting the chill of the water soothe my flushed skin, and then I caught a glimpse of movement out of the corner of my eye.

At first, I thought it was just my own reflection, moving with me as I adjusted my posture. But then I noticed something was wrong. My reflection wasn’t following me. It stayed there, frozen, unnaturally still, while I continued to move around the sink, my hands trembling as I wiped my face.

I froze. The reflection didn’t blink, didn’t shift. It just stood there, staring back at me. But it wasn’t *me*. I could tell right away that something was off. Its eyes weren’t the same—too wide, too empty. And then, the corners of its mouth twitched, slowly curling into a grin that was far too wide to be natural. It spread like it was stretching something that wasn’t meant to be stretched, a grotesque smile that seemed to pull at its face, distorting the skin. The teeth—there were too many of them, jagged and sharp, too sharp for a human mouth. I felt a wave of nausea rise in my stomach.

My heart skipped a beat as I realized something else. The reflection wasn’t just smiling; it was mocking me. It wasn’t moving with me anymore. It was *watching* me. The grin stretched wider still, impossibly wide, as if it were about to split the reflection’s face in half. I could feel my own smile beginning to falter, but I couldn’t stop it. The more I tried to force my expression back to normal, the wider its smile grew.

Panic surged through me. I stumbled backward, the sound of my boots scraping against the floor far too loud in the silence of the bathroom. I wanted to scream, but my throat was dry, and all I could manage was a strangled gasp. My eyes flicked frantically to the door, and in that moment, I realized I was no longer alone in that room. The reflection in the mirror was watching me, its head tilted to one side, as though considering its next move.

It didn’t just smile now. It *grinned*—like it had all the time in the world. The grin deepened, the teeth seeming to elongate into something monstrous. I could feel my own jaw aching, my face tightening in a futile attempt to resist. But I couldn't stop it. I couldn't look away. And for a moment, it felt like I wasn’t *me* anymore—like the reflection had taken me over completely.

The laughter came next.

It started as a low chuckle, soft and sinister, and then it grew louder. It was my voice, or at least, it *sounded* like it was my voice, but it was warped, twisted into something wrong. The laughter echoed in the small room, reverberating off the cold tiles, and the reflection’s eyes gleamed with something hungry, something far darker than any human could hold.

I couldn’t breathe. My hands were shaking so violently now that the water splashed across the counter, droplets catching the dim light. The reflection’s laughter morphed into something far worse—a low, guttural sound that made my skin crawl, a laugh that didn’t belong in a human throat.

And then, just as suddenly as it had all begun, everything stopped. The laughter died. The grin remained. But it wasn’t moving anymore. My reflection was still, as though it was waiting, watching.

I could barely think. I just knew I needed to get out of there. I didn’t dare look back as I stumbled toward the door, the air thick and oppressive in my lungs. I pulled it open and nearly fell out into the hallway, my heart pounding in my chest like a drum.

I don’t know how long I stood there, gasping for breath, trying to shake the image from my mind. But when I finally forced myself to look back, I could still see the bathroom door slightly ajar, the mirror just beyond it, waiting.

I never went back in. Not once. And from that night on, I made sure to never break Rule #6 again. Not even for a second.

That brings me to now. It’s 3:22 AM, and I’m hiding in the basement supply closet because I couldn’t make it anywhere else. Something began following me after I didn't seem to notice the skis standing upright quickly enough. Something is outside the door. I can hear it breathing, a wet, rattling sound that makes my stomach churn. It’s been scratching at the door for the past ten minutes, long, desperate clawing like something is trying to rip its way in. It sounds like it’s getting closer, the scraping growing louder with each pass. My pulse is racing, and my skin feels like it's crawling. I can barely breathe, trying to stay as silent as possible, but my heart is thumping so loudly that I’m terrified it’ll hear it too.

I don’t know what to do. I can’t stay in here forever. But I can’t leave either. The door’s not strong enough to hold whatever that thing is for long, and I don’t know what’ll happen if it gets in. I don’t know if I can survive whatever's out there. My phone battery is at 12%, and I’m too afraid to move too much, even to plug it in. My hands are shaking so badly that I can barely hold it steady enough to type.

I’m posting this here, on Reddit, because I don’t know where else to turn. I’ve seen strange things before, but nothing like this. I can’t tell anyone here what’s going on. No one would believe me. But maybe, just maybe, someone on here knows what’s happening or can help me figure out what to do. Please, if you’ve heard of anything like this, if you know what this thing is, please let me know. Anything. I need help.

I’ll keep posting as long as I can, but my battery is draining fast, and I’m afraid that when it’s gone, so will be my chance to get this message out. I just hope someone reads this before it’s too late.
