Before I dive into the main part of my story, I want to mention that I'm struggling with writing. This is my second attempt, and I hope you enjoy it. I apologize in advance for any errors I may make; I’ll review it multiple times before posting.

My story begins when I was 23 and had just moved out of my house after my girlfriend cheated on me, though that isn’t the main focus here. I work in a digital field, coding complex programs that can control robots and perform tasks beyond my current knowledge.

With nothing but my clothes and the items in my bag, I set off to an apartment that I had seen advertised for cheap rent with nice housing. I didn't care about the rules; I simply needed a place to stay. A small job as a cleaner at a local store didn’t pay well, so I had limited options. After arriving and interviewing with a tall, lean man, he gave me a set of rules to follow. I didn't read it carefully; I skimmed through, only noticing a few words like "don't smoke in certain areas”—normal rules to me. So, I signed it, took my keys, and went up to my room.

Room number 347, 7th floor, left side, no problem. I go to my room and get set up. Nothing interesting the normal, connect to the WiFi and get cosy. Now I was set up I lived happily for a while and was surprised with the low rent for a bedroom bathroom kitchen and balcony for 100 dollars every half month weird payment why not 200 every month I digress I work from home and I set my laptop up and began to code typing away and rarely blinking being lost in a sea of code.

Time is easily lost while engulfed in work, and in a blink, it went from 7 pm to 2 am. I saved my hours of work and hit the hay. This was the usual for months, and I even got to be friends with the neighbour well one he was called Tom and I'm Harry. We occasionally came together and had a beer, maybe watched a movie, and played some good old games. Nothing new was too old school for that.

Now, it starts around a Tuesday night. I was coding, and I was trying to make a code capable of duplication of items I typed. So, for example, if I type into the orange box, an image of an orange will appear, and each time I do, another one will appear. Basic, I know, but I wanted to put It into a 3d printer and make some figures and make an income from my passion, not cleaning a gas station. 

Now here's where I messed up. I had my laptop ready for a test, and I plugged it into a 4D printer, hoping for a figure-off a random person I designed to appear, but what happened was so much worse.

When I pressed duplicate in my work uniform, I was going to let it run while I worked. It whirled, twirled, and groaned like an electrical heart. Then it stopped. The room went dark, and the building went dark. Power was gone, but the 3d printer's small screen still let out a fluorescent glow. 

What was in the centre of the 3d printer was a portal, and I was confused, human temptation got to me, and I poked it.

That's all I saw. Then I was in my apartment in my uniform for work, and no more portal power was back. Did I go back in time? What happened was worse way worse.

To save you time, what I didn't know at this time is that it coded the computer to make what it wanted, and it replicated Earth, but it wasn't the same anymore. As I opened my door to go to work, the walls were stained red, and the floors were cracked. I thought nothing of it other than a paint job or design and went on.

When I got to the door, ready to go to work through the glass, I saw them. Humans, but different; have exposed hearts and pulsing sacks on their heads, a tongue capable of decapitation. They were hungry; I could see it on their faces. I looked around and saw that they had killed each other, and some were feasting on their kind remains. I, at this time, had no idea where I was. All I knew was that that portal took me to a new realm. I stood there admiring them, not by choice; I was bound to the very red flood I stood on, and then I looked down. It wasn't a paint job it was blood. 

Then they saw me they rotated their heads at such an angle it looked to be detached then they sprinted towards me I didn't move not until they were near the doors up the stairs 7th floor on the left repeated in my head making sure I went to my room where it's safe I thought I would touch that portal and leave be free from this sick and twisted hell of a place escape.

I made it unharmed, and I didn't just touch. I swiped the portal, grasping it in my hand, and squeezed it tight like a kid scared of monsters under the bed at night.

It burst in my hand and...

I was back. I thought outside my door were normal People living normally but the blood from the floor was still on my shoe and when I went to check the time it was 12. 30 minutes before my work started so I went to the balcony for a breather, and there I saw them. The creatures were there, and they merged with our reality, our earth. But there are people for them to feed on.


I'll do a part two as I'm worried I might pass the word count hope you like part one of many also thanks Grammarly for the help
