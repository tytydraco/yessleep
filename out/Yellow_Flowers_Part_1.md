**\[=----Prologue----=\]**

  
  
Rodney P. Lomax was a murderer. Everyone knew it. He killed fellow Confederate officer Matthew Voit in his sleep on May 5th, 1864. A point-blank shot, straight into the forehead. Lomax, of course, denied this. He claimed that Voit was a coward, and, rather than face battle in the upcoming days, chose to take his own life. The revolver that fired the fatal shot was Voit’s own, a .36-caliber Colt Navy, found clutched in the dead man’s hand. But everyone knew.

Rumors spread like wildfire among the troops of the 12th Virginia Infantry, encamped near Spotsylvania Courthouse. In the days before the shooting, hushed whispers carried tales of Voit having seduced Lomax’s fiancée, Eliza Harper, the night before their wedding in the summer of 1860. The scandal had been buried when the war broke out, but wounds like that don't just go away. They fester beneath the surface, waiting to boil over.

Lomax and Voit, both lieutenants, had been assigned to share a tent during the recent encampment, making it no difficult task for Lomax to stage the scene in the dead of night. After the initial panic of the gunshot—mistaken briefly for a Union raid—had subsided, the camp remained restless. The air had been thick with anticipation of a brutal clash with Federal forces, yet, despite this, the men could talk of little else but the cold-blooded act that had shattered their fragile camaraderie.

The commanding officer, Colonel Jeremiah Tate, faced an impossible dilemma. The evidence was circumstantial at best: Voit’s revolver, the lack of witnesses, and Rodney Lomax’s eerily calm insistence on his innocence. Tate, a grizzled veteran of the Mexican War who prized discipline above all, knew his men were watching. The soldiers of the 12th Virginia were already frayed, their morale battered by months of relentless marches, declining rations, and the grinding attrition of the Overland Campaign. To let a suspected murderer walk free risked mutiny or desertion; to punish without proof could fracture the unit further or invite scrutiny from higher command, like General Richard H. Anderson, who demanded order in the Army of Northern Virginia. Tate’s options were limited. A court-martial, as prescribed by the Confederate Articles of War, required clear evidence and a convened panel—luxuries impossible on the eve of battle. With General Ulysses S. Grant’s forces closing in, Tate ordered Lomax confined to a supply wagon under guard, his wrists bound with rope.

The men grumbled, many of their eyes glaring in Lomax’s direction with a mix of fear and disgust. Some believed that Voit’s ghost would haunt the camp, and each man wondered if justice for Lomax would wait—or if it would come at the end of a bayonet or bullet. Whether it be Union, or Confederate.

By dawn, the matter took yet another turn. As the regiment formed ranks to march toward the battlefield, Lomax’s guards reported he’d been attacked in the night. Someone had slipped past them, leaving Lomax bruised with a busted lip and blackened eye. No one confessed, and the guards swore they’d seen nothing.

Tate, outwardly furious but pressed for time, ordered Lomax to march with the unit, reasoning that keeping the lieutenant under his watch would prevent further vigilantism. This decision started a whole new wave of rumors to spread among the ranks as they trudged through the Virginia mud toward Spotsylvania’s entrenchments. Some speculated Tate himself had orchestrated the “attack” to justify keeping Lomax in the fight. Lomax, after all, was the regiment’s finest marksman, a sharpshooter whose skill had proven invaluable at Chancellorsville and the Wilderness. Unbeknownst to the soldiers, however, the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, which loomed just ahead, would somehow be deadlier than either of those engagements, etching its name in history as one of the bloodiest of the entire war, with the “Bloody Angle” claiming thousands and thousands of lives in a relentless, rain-soaked slaughter.

Against all odds, Lomax survived the battle, his expert shooting managing to save dozens of his comrades during the brutal fighting along the Mule Shoe salient on May 12th, 1864. His courage under fire earned grudging respect from some, and word of his guilt began to fade amid the chaos of survival. Colonel Tate, preoccupied with the regiment’s decimated ranks, never convened a court-martial.

In the days following the battle, as the army licked its wounds and prepared to move south, Lomax seized his chance. On the night of May 15th, he slipped away from camp, cutting through the dense Virginia woods under cover of darkness. His desertion was discovered at dawn, but with Union forces once again pressing and the regiment in disarray, pursuit was impossible. Lomax vanished without a trace.

Back in Staunton, his wife, Eliza Harper Lomax, was found to have left her home not long after, her whereabouts unknown. Some said she’d fled to join her husband; others, especially those in Eliza's family, believed she’d been abducted or murdered by Lomax.

The men of the 12th Virginia spoke softly but often of Rodney P. Lomax in the following months, his name becoming a mix of legend and curse. No one ever learned what became of him, and the mystery of Matthew Voit’s death faded into the war’s endless litany of loss.

Voit's body was eventually exhumed and reburied in what would become a historic Confederate cemetery within walking distance of the courthouse. And it was there, at the site of his grave, in the spring of 2018, that my life was set down a path that would lead to horrors I could not have ever even dreamt of imagining. The saying goes that dead men tell no tales... but as I would soon discover, Rodney P. Lomax was no dead man.



**\[=----Part 1----=\]**

  
  
In March of 2018, I found myself standing at the edge of a Confederate cemetery near Spotsylvania Courthouse, my dirty Timberland boots sinking slightly into the damp Virginia soil. The ground was just beginning to birth some of the yellow springtime flowers I could never seem to identify, and the air carried the faint sweetness of blooming dogwoods.

I was 20, a lanky, awkward Catholic kid who’d been homeschooled his whole life, raised on books and faith in a family that had uprooted from Texas to Virginia a decade earlier. I’d visited the graveyard on a whim, tagging along with my parish’s young adult group after John-Paul Kingston, the first real friend I had made after joining the group, suggested a “history hike” to explore local Civil War sites. The cemetery was to be our final stop. The others that were present—Karen Archer, Grace Voit, Dave O’Donnell, Robby Solomon and Kathryn White—were scattered nearby, their voices a low hum as they read inscriptions or snapped photos. But my eyes were fixed on one weathered marker:

*Matthew Voit, Lt., 12th Va. Inf., d. May 5, 1864.*

I didn’t know then that Voit’s name would haunt me, or that his grave would be the start of a thread tying me to a past that was determined to resurrect itself. I was too caught up in my own head, my thoughts drifting to Grace Voit, the blonde-haired descendant of the dead man beneath my feet. She was everything I thought I wanted—poised, beautiful, with a smile that made my chest ache. I’d been infatuated with her since the first young adult meeting. I wasn't worthy of her, I thought. Love truly is a blindfold.

I crouched down before the gravestone, brushing my fingers against the worn carving of Matthew Voit's name. The granite felt almost warm to me despite the cool spring air, and I imagined, for a moment, that I could feel something pulsing from deep within the earth. That is, until I realized it was just my own beating heart, likely due to the pressure of standing so close to Grace. She was only a few feet away, positioned beside a rusted iron fence with her sunglasses perched atop her head like a silver crown. She was laughing at something Robby had said. The sound of it made my throat tighten. How I wished I could have been the reason for her laughter.

Being homeschooled through high-school, and opting to not attend college, I had virtually no romantic experience with women. I had had virtually no friends either, but the St. Brigid Catholic young adult group was responsible for changing that. I had joined the group in the fall of 2016, after hearing about it from Fr. Williams, my parish priest, an enthusiastic man of 40. I felt at the time that joining the group and hanging out almost every weekend had been the best decision I had ever made, and in hindsight, if not for Grace Voit, I suppose it could have been.

However, it wouldn't be entirely fair to place all the blame for what happened on Grace, I too carry the weight of guilt for many reckless decisions in the months that followed. Young and infatuated—or so I believed—I would later find myself haunted by regret, wishing I had never joined them at the cemetery that day.

I stayed kneeling at the grave longer than any normal human being would have. Karen Archer plopped down beside me a few moments later, her combat boots crunching into the dirt.

"You're acting like you're waiting for the guy to sit up and shake your hand," she muttered, pulling her hoodie tighter around her, the frayed black sleeves bunching at her wrists as she hunched slightly against the breeze.

Karen's red-dyed hair, vibrant like coals beneath ash, fluttered across her pale cheeks in the wind, half-obscuring the kohl-lined eyes that always seemed to carry too much emotion for someone trying so hard to act indifferent. She wore a faded band tee under the hoodie—some obscure post-punk group I couldn’t name—and her jeans were torn at one knee, not from fashion but from wear. There was something unapologetically real about her, the kind of rawness I didn’t know how to understand or appreciate then. Her sarcasm was a shield, I think, and her loud laugh a cover for some deeper silence she didn’t want to hear. She always seemed to approach me to talk, and while I enjoyed her company, I honestly just didn’t see her as a woman then—not really. To me, she was just Karen. A friend. The one who always showed up, even when no one asked her to.  
  
She pushed her pink-gold rimmed glasses up her nose a bit further as I pondered a response.

"Seriously, though… you okay?" She asked.

I nodded absently, not taking my eyes off the carved name. “Yeah. Just… weird, I guess. Being this close to someone who was murdered. Like, really murdered. Either that or took his own life, I suppose. You ever think about how people just—stop existing? On earth, anyway.”

Karen leaned back, plucking a twig from the ground and twirling it between her fingers. “Yeah. Pretty often, actually. Usually when I’m up at two in the morning trying not to spiral into existential dread. It's really fun.”

I huffed a laugh, still distracted. “You know there are local legends about what happened to Matthew's killer, right?”

Karen nodded slowly, before reciting:

"Rodney P. Lomax, don't look back,

He buried his sin and made a pact.

'Don't let me die till the rebs have won.'

Now he wanders the woods with loaded gun.

My dad used to regurgitate that to me and my brothers when we were little. Usually to try to creep us out when we wanted to go for walks at night."

"Really?" I raised an eyebrow, "I hadn't heard that rhyme before. Just the more basic folk tales."

"Well yes, I've also heard that he abandoned the war and went home and killed his wife... So, yeah, sounds like a great guy."

"That’s what I've heard too, though apparently in some versions of the story he kidnapped her and forced her to flee with him. I don't know, I haven't really looked much into it yet."

"Yet?" Karen fixed me with a quizzical look. "Why do you care?”

I shrugged. “There's just... something about stories like that that I find kind of fascinating. Grace said she’s related to him, you know?” I added, nodding towards Voit’s tomb.

Karen’s gaze sharpened slightly. “Yeah, I know.”

I looked up then, finally meeting her eyes. “What?”

“Nothing.” Her voice was flat, but her knuckles whitened on the twig. “Just don’t go playing ghost hunter, alright? You’ll scare off the girls.”

“Not like I’ve got a line of them waiting,” I murmured, wryly.

Karen furrowed her eyebrows. “That’s not true.”

I didn’t catch her meaning then. Or maybe I just didn’t want to. I had eyes only for Grace."Look, a Nest Ball." Karen said suddenly, with a childish grin, displaying the now balled up twig she had been clutching.

"Huh?" I replied, staring blankly for a moment, failing to catch the reference to Pokémon, one of our common interests.

Before Karen could answer, Grace called over. “Hey! You guys coming? There are some old cannons by the far fence.” I stood quickly, brushing the dirt from my jeans, a little too eager to get her attention. Karen stayed sitting a moment longer, watching me go.

The rest of the afternoon was a blur—sunlight through tall trees, Dave pointing out rifle pits, Kathryn and John-Paul discussing the turmoil of their wedding preparations, and Karen, trailing behind, seemingly lost in thought. But I kept drifting back to the grave, and the name: Voit. Grace barely looked at it. She was too busy laughing at Robby’s jokes, tossing her hair in that practiced way. Still, every so often, she’d glance at me, just enough to keep me off-balance. It was stupid. I recognize that now. But I thought that if I could solve the mystery of Matthew Voit's death, or at least bring some forgotten information to light, Grace might actually take interest in me. And in some way, I suppose I was right, though not in the way I believed at the time.

Ghost stories and murder mysteries had always been an interest of mine. I couldn't really call it an obsession, just because I hadn't exactly been allowed to look much into that kind of thing as a kid. I loved my parents, but they were the definition of overprotective. They were deeply religious, but then again I was religious as well, so I appreciated that aspect of them to some extent. That did not prevent the occasional clash between us, however, as they viewed such innocuous media as Pokémon, Minecraft and Lord of the Rings as pushing the limit of what they would allow. I was not given unsupervised internet access until I was at least sixteen, and I did not own a personal cell phone until I was nineteen, and my mom and dad finally realized I'd need a way to communicate with them when driving the beat up Honda I had bought off my older sister. 

Still, I got by watching the occasional late-night re-run of Columbo or the Twilight Zone, and now, having a real-life unsolved murder mystery wrapped in a veil of ghostly paper at my fingertips, well, I couldn't help but admit that there was a part of me that was genuinely curious about what I could uncover. I tried to gaslight myself into believing that that was the sole reason for my interest, simply because acknowledging the truth would only further distract me with more longing thoughts of Grace. But deep-down, I knew the true motivation for my actions.

The cemetery was not large. A couple of acres at best. It had been established about a year after the war had ended, by some local women who were distressed at the lack of care that many of the dead had been given. After some effort, they had been able to pressure the US government into providing land as well as headstones, but obtaining the latter was a slow process which continued into the late 1920s. Only around 700 of the thousands of dead were able to be reinterred, due to time and unrecognizability. There were a few unmarked headstones, but a majority listed the name and rank of the deceased fighters. A large monument of a confederate soldier stood atop a high pillar in the center of the area, with a tall chain link fence surrounding the perimeter. 

Matthew Voit's stone was located towards the back of the cemetery, under the sprawling branches of a large, ancient looking cedar. I wondered if that tree could have been there during the days of the conflict. A wondering which I made aloud as the group made its way back to the spot where we had parked our vehicles.

Robby Solomon, the twenty-four year old forest ranger, glanced at the tree briefly before replying "Eastern red cedars can live anywhere from a hundred to about five hundred years, so it's possible, for sure... Wood-n't you like to know?" He added, grinning, as he received a playful slap on the arm from Kathryn.

When I first met Robby, I described him to my mom as the textbook definition of a 1980's "karate kid." He drove a large, white van that was adorned with several fading decals themed around the local martial arts studio from which he had inherited the vehicle. He used to sport a classic 80's-looking blonde mullet, but his park ranger training had necessitated a haircut. He never missed a beat though, and had opted to instead put his hair care efforts into growing something of a handlebar mustache, a blonde strip across his upper lip, which, depending on the angle, either gave him the look of a charming Southern gentleman or a minor league pitcher from 1987. 

Robby was the kind of guy who told bad jokes with such sincerity that you couldn’t help but laugh, even when you groaned first. He’d once taught a group of us how to identify different types of moss and fungi on a hike, narrating the entire lesson in a David Attenborough impression. It was hard not to like him. He was tall, and on the skinny side, but the word most used to describe him was 'dependable.' He had been the original founder of the St. Brigid young adult group, or rather, the one who had originally approached Fr. Williams in order to ask permission for us to gather in the parish hall. We often all traveled in his van when going on group trips, including that cool spring day. 

Everyone but me had carpooled to the cemetery. I lived closer to the site than everyone else did, so it made more sense to ride on my own, rather than having to travel all the way back to the church before returning home. Still, it meant I was a bit sad to have to say goodbye to everyone early... especially Grace.

My relationship with Grace was practically non-existent at that point in time. I wasn't even sure that she knew my name off the top of her head. But as she climbed into the front passenger seat of Robby’s van that day, I distinctly recall that she waved at me. Something that my lovesick self held onto like a life raft. As I shook hands with the other guys and Karen, her wave was all I could think about.

The sun hung low as I drove home. I had always hated Daylight Savings, but something made me feel glad that I wasn't driving home in total darkness. The poem Karen had recited echoed in my mind. "Rodney P. Lomax, don't look back..." Don't look back? I wondered if those words were directed at Lomax, or a warning to those who heard the rhyme. Instinctively, and despite myself, I looked behind at that moment, glancing into my rear view mirror. There was nothing, obviously, and I chuckled quietly, making sure to turn on the radio so as to avoid driving the rest of the way in silence.

Just as the sun dipped below the horizon, I pulled into my parents' driveway, the porch light flickering in an odd rhythm. I internally slapped myself for forgetting to change the bulb, despite my mom's constant reminders, yet I made no effort to remember this time either.

I sat in my Honda for a moment longer, enjoying the warmth of the car's heater running, when my phone buzzed in my pocket—a text from Karen, which read simply, "Did you make it home safe?"

Something about her concern touched me, though at the time I brushed it off. I replied with a quick "Yes, thanks," before gathering my things and heading inside.

My mom was in the kitchen, her hands deep in bread dough, flour dusting her forearms like a second skin. She smiled when I entered, but her eyes narrowed slightly, the way they always did when she sensed something off about me.

"You look like you've seen a ghost," she said, ever able to read me like a book, while wiping her hands on her apron.

I shrugged, dropping my keys into the Mickey Mouse-themed ceramic bowl by the fridge. "Just exhausted," I lied, the truth feeling too embarrassing to admit.

My parents were kind, but their overprotective nature made it difficult for me to want to share things with them. This was mostly out of fear that their caring ways would incline them to try to stop me from doing what I had set my mind on. I had also never expressed with them anything regarding my infatuation with Grace, and I was thankful that I didn't have to now, as my mom didn't press further; unusual for her. She seemed too caught up in her juggling act of dinner prep and a text conversation with my dad to pay me much heed.

I hung my jacket on the coat rack in the front hall and then retreated to my upstairs bedroom to boot up my laptop.

My room was small, but cozy. With a window on the front-facing side and a closet on the wall opposite to it. Various posters that had been hung a decade ago plastered much of the wall, leaving very little space with which to view the fading sky-blue drywall underneath. My bed sat in the opposite corner of the entryway. The Mario Kart comforter and Pokémon pillow cases indicated the fact that the bed's occupant had in fact grown up in the early 2000's, and perhaps was not yet ready to fully let go of that childhood. The room featured no overhead lighting, and was instead illuminated by a single, free-standing lamp near the doorway. I flicked the lamp's light switch as I entered, catching a glimpse of my mom's pet cat waking from a slumber on my bed. It darted out of the room, without so much as a glance towards me. I rolled my eyes at this lack of affection and began clearing the clutter off the wooden desk I had against the wall at the foot of my bed.

Beneath the mess of Pokémon cards, receipts and notebooks lay my laptop. It was an old thing, a hand-me-down from my father, chunky and unreliable, but it connected to the internet well enough. After what felt like an eternity waiting for it to power on, it finally loaded my desktop and browser, and I was able to begin running Google searches.

The first thing I typed into my Firefox browser was "Rodney Lomax Civil War." I didn't get a single result for that prompt. Apparently, the story was more local than I realized. I changed the search prompt to "Rodney Lomax 12th Virginia" and got a few hits this time. A couple of local history blogs that made cursory mentions of the event and a muster roll documentation site, but these failed to provide any new information. I did come across one result that piqued my interest. A museum website that contained an accounting of officers from the 12th Virginia Infantry. The document had been created in 1867 at the request of the Virginia Historical Society, and to my nervous excitement, included a mention of Rodney Lomax:

*Lieutenant Rodney P. Lomax, Company C: Regimental sharpshooter, distinguished at Chancellorsville and the Wilderness. Deserted May 15, 1864. Last seen fleeing into woods near Spotsylvania. Whereabouts unknown; rumored to have perished or fled west.*

It wasn't much, but it was enough to keep me on the hook. I searched the document for mention of Matthew Voit as well, but his entry was far more brief, with no mention of murder or suicide:

*Lieutenant Matthew Voit, Company C: Able officer, skilled in drill. Died May 5, 1864, near Spotsylvania Court House.*

I saved the links to my bookmarked pages before typing "Matthew Voit Confederate" into the search bar. To my surprise, several results appeared. Most were genealogy forums which seemed to contain little of relevance, but one link caught my eye: "The Death Record: A Comprehensive Account of Confederate Casualties During the Overland Campaign" by Dr. Eleanor Crenshaw. The local university library database listed it as available for checkout. I made a mental note to visit there first thing Monday morning, then continued scrolling through the search results.

Next I came across a Civil War blog that hadn't been touched since 2003, with a transcription of a letter from a Colonel Jeremiah Tate, to Major General Richard H. Anderson, written shortly after the battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse. The letter briefly mentioned Voit’s death as part of a broader report on the regiment’s casualties:

*From: Colonel Jeremiah Tate, 12th Virginia Infantry*

*Near Spotsylvania Court House, Virginia*

*May 16, 1864*

*To: Major General Richard H. Anderson,*

*Commanding, First Corps, Army of Northern Virginia*

*Sir,*

… \[preceding sections have been omitted for brevity, addressing battle losses and logistics\]

*I must also report the earlier death of Lieutenant Matthew Voit on May 5, found in his tent with a self-inflicted gunshot to the forehead from his .36-caliber Colt Navy revolver. The scene, inspected by myself and Surgeon Caldwell, showed no signs of struggle, the weapon still in Voit’s hand. His tentmate, Lieutenant Lomax, reported waking to the shot and finding Voit deceased. Given Voit’s recent withdrawn demeanor, I judge this a suicide, likely spurred by the strain of our campaign’s relentless pace.*

*No court-martial was convened due to the immediate demands of entrenching against General Grant’s advance. The 12th Virginia, already worn by the Wilderness and battered further in the recent fighting at the Mule Shoe, could ill afford the disruption of an inquiry. Scattered rumors among the men, hinting at foul play by Lomax, lack evidence and stem from camp gossip. Lomax’s valor in the late battle, saving numerous comrades, further dispels such notions. With the regiment’s ranks decimated and Federal forces still pressing, I deemed the matter closed, prioritizing our defense. Voit’s body awaits proper burial per regulations.*

… \[subsequent sections omitted, addressing further regimental matters\]

*Your obedient servant,*

*Jeremiah Tate*

*Colonel, 12th Virginia Infantry*

I sighed and ran a hand through my dirty-brown hair as I considered the contents of the letter and the consequences it would have on my case for Lomax being a heartless murderer. The text made it quite clear that Colonel Tate was certain in the fact that Voit had taken his own life. Was the whole murder story really just nothing more than a local myth, corrupted by time? That was certainly possible, I admitted to myself, and yet... something seemed off about that letter, like it was missing something. I drummed my fingers along the desk for a moment as I sat deep in thought. 

Then it hit me. Of course! The letter contained no mention of Lomax’s desertion that had taken place the day before. I double-checked the date on the Historical Society document, and sure enough, it confirmed that Lomax had deserted on May 15th. Why would Colonel Tate neglect to mention this in a letter he wrote a day later, and instead seemingly defend Lomax’s integrity? Maybe I was overthinking it, but regardless, it gave me reason to continue grasping onto the murderer angle. If Tate had covered-up Lomax’s desertion, why couldn't he have also covered up a murder?

I turned up little else with searches related to Voit. My mom was kind enough to bring me my dinner upstairs, since she was under the impression that I was worn out. I was grateful, but barely touched my food as I was too caught in my own web of investigation. Eventually, I figured that I had exhausted most further keywords to search without anything worthwhile having popped up, until I realized that I could search the Courthouse cemetery itself. I typed "Spotsylvania Courthouse Cemetery" and hit enter. I discovered immediately that it was going to be way too difficult to filter through every single result for that, so I narrowed it down to "Spotsylvania Courthouse Cemetery Voit." There were no results for that prompt, so instead I tried the same, but with Lomax’s name instead. Still nothing. I sighed, and in desperation typed "Spotsylvania Courthouse Cemetery Ghost" and again hit the enter key. I was completely flabbergasted when a single, solitary reddit post appeared from user user Groundhoggit2 on June 8th, 2011, titled: 

*Has anyone else seen the chained man?*

What the hell?
