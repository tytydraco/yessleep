When you’re holding a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

My brother, Jordan, was holding a coin that let him hurt anyone he wanted, completely anonymously, in a way that could never be tracked back to him.

At first, he’d only visit the well once a week, throwing the coin inside and calling out a name. The next day, one of the eighth-grade boys who bullied him would show up on crutches or with a black eye. The accidents were different every time. Minor slips on the ice, or just tripping over something small and unseen. Jordan didn’t really have a say over exactly how they got hurt. He just gave the well the coin and a name.

Several of the boys claimed that they’d been pushed by some invisible force, something that smelled of animal musk and rotted flesh. Of course, those claims only blended into the hundred other ghost stories we told each other.

Of course, I knew the truth. As the weeks went by, I witnessed the thing a dozen times or more. Not because it was after me (though I sometimes feared Jordan would get mad and pick me as his next target) but because I was often there when it returned the coin.

The thing from the well preferred to come at night, shortly after its mission was completed. It had grown less dramatic now. Rather than blowing our windows open, it seemed capable of seeping inside slowly through a small crack, carefully placing the coin under Jordan’s pillow or by the foot of his bed. Though it seemed to have a body, it was perfectly malleable, able to squeeze its large bulk into a paper thin sheet.

Sometimes, depending on when Jordan used his wish, the thing would come out in the day.

Once, I was out in the empty school hallway on my way to take a piss when I felt a cold draft blowing through the halls. The thing tried to keep its footsteps quiet, but I heard them anyway, a steady tapping growing closer as I stood frozen.

I heard its breath, a quiet but labored sound, like someone desperate for oxygen but incapable of getting enough. I had heard stories of old wells spreading death to everyone who drank them thanks to an animal falling into the water, its rot spreading before people realized, too late, that the poison was there.

I had come to imagine the thing as many animals, all drowned in the darkness, their rotted ghosts sewn together.

For a moment, the thing drew close, stopping to sniff me, and my hand went instinctively to the coin in my pocket. I had never used it, of course. I’d been to scared to even visit the well. But I couldn’t deny the way it called to me. I knew one day, I wouldn’t be able to resist.

The thing snorted softly, its breath all stench. Then it strode invisibly past me and over to Jordan’s locker. Then I heard the telltale clink of something small and metal dropping inside.

During the next break, I waited for Jordan to open his locker. When he did, he found the coin there, still dripping wet, and he shoved it quickly into the pocket of his coat.

Over time, Jordan’s visits to the well became more frequent. Sometimes, he’d try to use it twice a day, once on the way to school in the morning, and again at night. By then, some of the bullies were on their second or third round of punishment.

Toby Knox, who’d once flung Jordan’s backpack on the roof of a schoolbus, sliced open his fingers on a jar that broke in his hand. Later, he bloodied his lip falling face-first into a drinking fountain. Finally, he sprained his knee, slipping on ice. Bad luck, people said. At least at first.

Other bullies experienced similar accidents. A large icicle fell on Aaron Schnell’s back. A calm dog got suddenly riled up and attacked Frank Wu. Gus Feliz slipped on ice three days in a row.

I didn’t feel bad for any of those guys. They’d been making my brother’s life hell for years, mocking his threadbare t-shirts and worn shoes. When my dad shaved our heads every couple of months, they called Jordan a cancer patient.

It wasn’t just Jordan they bullied, but he was their favorite target. Still, they probably would have never realized he was behind the accidents if he hadn’t said something.

It was in the locker room after gym. It was the only class my brother and I shared. Jordan was on the way out of the shower when Frank Wu body-checked him into the wall. Jordan wasn’t seriously hurt, but he was definitely pissed.

“One for a trick…” Jordan muttered under his breath.

“What they fuck did you just say, Jordy?” asked Frank. He was tall and fat, towering over Jordan.

“Just, better watch out. You’ve been having a lot of accidents lately.”

Frank took a step back. I could tell he was thrown off in a way I hadn’t seen before.

“You better hope I don’t have another one, or I’ll know who to blame.”

Frank might have done something then and there. He would have been happy to beat my naked brother to a pulp. But just then, Mr. McClintock walked in and told everyone to hurry the fuck up and get dressed.

“You shouldn’t have said anything,” I mentioned on the way home after school. We’d run halfway home, making sure to avoid Frank and his friends. “Not people will talk. They’ll know it’s you.”

“Good,” said Jordan. “Maybe then they’ll be smart enough to stay away from me.”

He thought for a second.

“We’ve got to make a statement,” he said. “Something bigger. *Two for a spill.* You got your coin on you?”

I hesitated.

“No,” I said after a second.

“You always pause before you lie,” he said. “Come on. Follow me.” He gestured over to the broken road heading into the forest.

“No way,” I said. “Fuck no.”

He thought for a second.

“If Frank just slips on another frozen puddle, he’s going to come to school and kick my ass,” he said. “We need to do some real damage. Teach him to stop fucking with me, permanently.”

“How bad would he get hurt?” I asked. “If we both throw our coins?”

“I don’t know,” he said. “Probably pretty bad. Enough to make a statement.”

I rubbed the coin in my pocket. I didn’t want to hurt anyone, not even Frank Wu, who definitely deserved it. The coin felt warm in my hand. Almost too hot, like it needed to be cooled, thrown in the icy depths of the black water.

“Please,” said Jordan, trying to meet my eyes with his. “Please. If we don’t do this, I don’t know what he’ll do to me. Right now, he’s probably at home thinking he should have kicked my ass on the spot. For all I know, he’ll jump me on the way to school tomorrow, knock a couple of my teeth out.”

“Jordan…” I didn’t know exactly what to say.

“Do you remember that time you left the TV on overnight, and dad came into our room screaming? Do you remember?”

“You told him it was you,” I said quietly. Of course I remembered. My dad had hit Jordan three times hard in the back as he sat balled under his covers.

“Please,” said Jordan again. “I need this.”

“Okay,” I said, holding the burning coin in my hand. [“Let’s go.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/)
