On August 4, 1907, a small traveling carnival passed through the railroad town of Mojave, California.

Witnesses immediately noted irregularities within the carnival, including but not limited to unusual-looking workers, performing animals the likes of which no one in the town recognized, as well as what several survivors described as an “astonishingly frightening” freak show. 

Frightening or not, the carnival was a true novelty. Novelty attracts the curious, and the residents of Mojave were no exception. 

The carnival opened at dusk. By all accounts, this small troupe offered the most incredible entertainment any of the revelers had ever experienced.

The festivities were curtailed at moonrise, when a dark-haired man strode past the ticket booth against the protestations of the workers and marched onto the promenade.

Witnesses initially assumed the man was part of the carnival, because like so many of the performers, he had an irregular appearance. Specifically, survivors described him as having a “snakelike face,” “eyes that bled darkness,” and skin tattooed with a strange, scale-like pattern. One survivor specifically described these tattoos as identical to the markings on a rattlesnake.

Seemingly impervious to the commotion caused by his arrival, man opened his mouth and began to sing. 

Within moments, the earth began to tremble.

The tremors erupted into waves. The ground itself rolled like the ocean cresting and crashing, carrying tides of rocks and sandstone. Survivors all reported an unearthed obsidian sheet shattering and the sheer beauty of the resultant splinters glinting under the moon.

Revelers and performers alike began to scream, but those screams soon turned into laughter.

Dancing followed, bodies whirling through the chaos, heedless as the ground opened up to swallow them, senseless to the rush of earth and the jutting rock plates that hit and crushed them.

The newcomer continued to sing and the ground continued to break apart. Game booths fell apart, food stands descended into rifts in the ground. The big top crashed down and ignited, trapping howling animals and screaming patrons alike in an inferno.

Only when every part of the carnival had fallen, only when every light had died, only when darkness descended over everything, did the singer fall silent and the earth still.

Thirty-seven people died in the disaster. Another fifteen vanished, including several young children. No bodies were ever recovered. All were presumed to have perished in the earthquake.

For reasons not fully determined, the singer’s melody was adapted into a local folksong named “King Mojave Green.”

Nearly fifty years later, the entity appeared in Tehachapi, California, shortly before the town’s devastating earthquake on July 21, 1952.

One elderly witness who happened to be present at the 1907 carnival disaster reported that he heard a man singing the eerie, unmistakable tune of “King Mojave Green” approximately five minutes before the quake struck. Several other witnesses observed the entity in the area approximately 10-45 minutes prior to the earthquake. While precise descriptions differed somewhat, all used variations of words such as “reptilian,” “snakelike,” “demonic,” and “hypnotic.”

After the 1952 earthquake, the entity fully entered the annals of local folklore. Tales indicate that he is responsible for a number of ills, including floods, wildfires, devastating freezes, and manmade disasters related to the area’s energy, mining, and manufacturing industries. Nevertheless, earthquakes are most closely associated with this entity by residents of the area.

Due to obvious reasons, this entity was on the agency’s radar following the 1907 disaster, but he successfully evaded detection for decades. 

After the 1952 earthquake, the agency redoubled its efforts and for a time, even made the capture and containment of the entity its primary goal. 

The agency decided to call him “King Mojave Green” after the song he sings before calamity strikes. (Please note that to date, this inmate has not provided any staff with his name. When asked during the below interview, he stated that “names are power, and you have enough of that.”)

The agency’s pursuit of King Mojave Green continued to be unsuccessful for nearly two years. The entity evaded numerous capture attempts by using his voice, which possesses two abilities: to induce severe psychological distress in human listeners and – in the simplest terms imaginable – to cause natural disasters. 

The nature of his voice has naturally precluded intensive study, but AHH personnel theorize that the vibrations created from the pitch and tone are uniquely evolved to disrupt or even intentionally manipulate organic matter on a molecular level.

The inmate’s voice does not have to be heard to be effective; in one of the few experiments conducted by Agency personnel, his singing induced similar levels of distress in both subjects who could hear him, and those who could not. 

Given the consistent reports of his reptilian appearance, the Agency theorized that King Mojave Green went dormant in winter like many species of snakes and lizards native to the area.

This theory proved correct.

The entity was located in a large burrow in the Tehachapi Mountains on January 2nd, 1955, in a state of hibernation. The weakness and lethargy associated with hibernation allowed personnel to take him into custody.

King Mojave Green presents as a dark-haired adult male of indeterminate age. Although contradictory, his eyes are perhaps best described as *luminous black*. He has an underdeveloped nose, no visible outer ear structures, and a wide mouth. His most distinctive feature is his skin, which is covered in scales identical in size, texture, color, and pattern to that of the Mojave Green rattlesnake. 

Due to continual and destructive refusal to cooperate with the Agency, King Mojave Green is not permitted to speak. He wears a custom-designed internal muzzle that immobilizes his tongue, jaws, and palate, and extends down his throat to block all but the most rudimentary of sounds such as grunts and moans. His cell is temperature-controlled, and must never exceed 42 degrees Fahrenheit in order to maintain a state of critical lethargy.

As an additional precaution, staff administer daily injections of a neuromuscular blocking agent to paralyze his vocal cords in the event he wakes up unexpectedly.

Administration has attempted to surgically remove the inmate’s vocal cords on several occasions, but the inmate is capable of regrowing both internal and external structures following injury. After the fourth regrowth of the removed parts, AHH decided to refrain from further removal efforts.

After in-depth discussion among command staff and administration, some of these measures were temporarily mitigated on December 6, 2024 to facilitate a meeting with the Agency’s new interviewer. The Agency provided the inmate with a specialized voice prosthesis to ensure a productive conversation. 

The interviewer would like to note that the information relayed in the inmate’s interview matches a local myth involving a cataclysmic flood. The main difference between the inmate’s account and human retellings is, of course, perspective. Specifically, the human myth casts this inmate in the role of destroyer.  

Based on the information received, it is the interviewer’s opinion that administration should strongly consider the possibility that this was never true, and that release of the inmate would serve the agency’s goals more effectively than incarceration.

**Classification String: Uncooperative / Indestructible / Gaian / Constant / Severe / Daemon** 

**Interviewer: Rachele B.**

**Interview Date: 12/6/24**



When I was young and whole, I was one of many and we fought a common enemy.You once understood this.



We lived under the earth, in beautiful cities and fields of clouds. We only surfaced  for two reasons only: To fight for you, and to bring our fallen to the dark pool that they might truly rest.



We did not fight for you freely. We were hungry. Although we were hungry, we were always fair.



You were not.



Over time, you forgot that you fed us so that we might fight the destroyers. You forgot that we gave everything to do this, that we rallied the earth itself to protect you from that which has no place here.



You forgot that we were your guardians.



And so you became our destroyers.



You hated our war songs and cut out our tongues when you caught us. How did you forget why we sang those songs at all? I never understood how you could forget.



We were far stronger than you, but you outnumbered us on an incomprehensible scale. Our small victories — for our victories were always small — only brought greater losses later. If we struck once, even in defense, you struck back twenty times and then laughed.



You laughed when you took my brother. You cut him open and tore him apart to kill him, but he did not die. We do not die until we are washed in the pool.



You forgot that, too.



Because you forgot, you could not understand why he did not die. At first, this made you afraid. Then it made you angry.



Then it made you amused.



You kept his body to desecrate. You peeled his flesh and made me wear it. You shaved his head. You plucked out his eyes. You cut his nose and hands away. 

The sounds my brother made still echo in my heart. They are part of the song I sing to the earth, even now. His destruction became my strength. This would make him proud. It would make me proud were our roles reversed.



Though he could not die, he began to rot. Eventually the smell accomplished what nothing else could, and you destroyers dragged him from their camp. He wept as his fleshless back dragged and tore along the rocky dirt. I did not know that you could weep without eyes, but he did.

 

I watched him cook under the sun. I saw fat red ants glittering as they swarmed him. I saw the flies crawl into his eye sockets. I saw their maggots squirming like pearls made flesh. I watched the birds descend to pluck his sinews. One had the face of a man, and smiled at me as I wept.



When my brother and all the rest were too defeated to offer any further amusement, the fight and its fighters moved on, leaving destruction without even the mercy of death.



Of my people, I alone remained whole. I alone carried their bodies to the pool. I alone washed them clean, purifying them of pain and the touch of the destroyers. I alone sang our death song. I could not form the words, for they had taken my tongue too. But I sang the melody and prayed it would be enough.



I washed my brother last. As I pushed him off into the still black water, he smiled. 



I wept. 



As I wept, the world shifted and changed.



I felt currents in the air, dancing and crackling across my skin like sparks in a night fire. I felt fear, even terror, and the certainty that danger was near at hand.



I looked up, wishing for the strength to fight this new danger but knowing it would not come. What I saw frightened me.



Overhead, the night sky danced with rivers of light, something I had never seen.



Before me, the black pool was perfectly still and filled with stars.



The pool did not *reflect* stars. It reflected nothing, not even the lights in the sky. The stars I saw were within the water, or perhaps in place of the water.



The brightest star hung in the center, burning bright as a sun the color of bone.



I watched, terrified and mesmerized, understanding somehow that this star was the source of the vast menace I tasted in the air.



This star vanished before my eyes, extinguishing like a flame, only to reappear a moment later.



And then it began to grow.



It expanded through the pool, swallowing the other stars. Terror as I have never known — terror and horror — consumed me in the same way the light consumed the stars and the warm darkness surrounding them.



When the light reached the shores of the pool, it seethed, shifting and rising.



Then it vanished for a moment, only to explode back into being.



I realized, then, what this thing was:



An eye.



A monstrous, white hot eye like a blinding moon.



Horror flooded me once more, and a sense of terrible wrongness. Of something worse than death—worse even my brother’s undeath — preparing to rise from that void of corrupted light.



I knew, also, that it meant to consume my brother.



I did not think. I acted.



I reached into the pool for my brother. My arms plunged into something soft and wet, like overripe fruit. I did not hear a scream, but I *felt* the thing in the pool scream — the pain, the rage reverberating through my very bones as bright, blinding ichor exploded around me. I felt another scream as it retreated, recoiling from my touch.



Unencumbered, my hands quickly found my brother and I dragged him out. The eye sent bleeding, writhing tendrils to stop me, soft rotten flesh binding my wrists, but they were too weak to stop me.



My brother grieved to be pulled from the water. His smile was gone, and he wept again. His weeping broke my heart. It was wrong to take him from the pool. But what was I to do? It was no longer a pool, no place of rest or peace. Only a place of unfathomable destruction.



As I begged my brother for forgiveness, the pool that was no longer a pool blinked again, then shuddered. 



And then it became a blinding geyser of light, whipping and writhing under the undulating sky. It crashed over me like a wave, but unlike a wave it forced itself inside me, through my nose, my mouth, my ears. It burned like fire and moved like a predator, burying itself in my insides as though it had hooks. I felt a terrible pressure in my head and an even more terrible agony as blood poured from my ears. The earth swayed under my feet, and I fell.



When I fell, the tendrils pulled, dragging me into the pool from within my mouth and ears. It was so bright. Brighter than the sun, but the color of the moon. Nothing but light, within and without. Light and agony.



I am not of light. I am of the earth. I come from under the ground, first from burrowed cities long dead, and now only burrows filled with roots and rabbits and worms. Darkness is and will always be my home.



I refused to die drowned in light. 



And so I fought.



I pulled the tendrils out of me, screaming as the barbs tore through my insides, and then I swam for shore  — a speck of darkness in a radiant sea.



I reached the shore gasping and bleeding, choking on the writhing remnants inside me. I pulled thin slithering radiant worms from between my teeth, and spat mouthfuls of blood infected with grains of squirming light.



As I pulled its remains out of me, the pool that was no longer a pool shuddered and receded, drawing up into a wall of light on the opposite shore.



And then it erupted once more, shattering to reveal a corrupted thing with a broken face and great white eyes that burned holes in the night, so bright they burned holes in the light itself. *In* itself.



I screamed, and the world itself shattered just as the light had.



The ground rose and broke like waves, crashing into itself before splitting apart. Darkness poured out. Warm, living darkness that swept across me like a blanket and swallowed the light.



Night birds screamed and took flight. Elk bellowed, racing across the surging earth. Big cats tore over cresting tides of dirt and rock. 



The pool that was no longer a pool overflowed, breaking its banks as the moon-eyed enemy billowed upward, great claws reaching for me.



I screamed again. The shores of the pool shuddered once more and slid upward, vast torrents of earth thrusting upward to form hills. These walls of earth smashed against each other, burying the pool and crushing the enemy between them.



The moon-eyed abomination snarled, spitting flecks and foam of burning light that scorched my skin.



Then it smiled, and its teeth were even brighter than its eyes. 



It dug its claws into the broken earth and squirmed upward, outward. The rocky outcroppings and jagged ground of the risen shores sliced its flesh as it fought its way free. Light bled from the wounds, burning the darkness into nothing. As its body slithered up from the earthen trap, it unfurled great wings made of fire and stars and the rivers of light rippling in the sky.



Once more, I screamed.



The earth under the pool broke open with a dreadful roar. The surrounding hills crumbled, tumbling down upon us. Boulders smashed the enemy’s head and tore holes in its wings through which darkness poured triumphantly, and spread. Earth and rocks, trees and roots, cascading down in a wall of warm and living dark.



By the end, the earth covered the enemy’s body like a cairn except for its bloody, broken claws, which lay extended and gleaming upon what remained of the rocky shore.



 By daybreak, even the claws lost their light. 



That was only the first.



There are countless more.



I have killed many, in all their forms, and blocked the way of many more than that. They come in great bursts of light and destruction. Earth and darkness keep them at bay.



I am the servant of earth, born from living darkness.



I was a guardian of your land and your own people. You once understood this, but you have already forgotten it far longer than you ever knew it. That is why you hunted us. Why you destroyed as many of your guardians as you could, and betrayed the rest. 



Do you know what horrors have crept through the crevasses in my lands since you locked me away?



Do you care?



Do you know how many more horrors have crept into the world since you began to kill and trap us?



Do you understand that you are betraying yourselves as well as your guardians?



Do you know what will happen to you once you have destroyed and betrayed us all?



I do not know. I am asking if *you* know.



If you do not know, then perhaps it is time you stop.



It’s been so long since I was warm. Let me touch your hands, please. So I can remember how it is to be warm.



Thank you.
