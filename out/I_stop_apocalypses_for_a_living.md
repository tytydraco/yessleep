  
Remember the day when people believed that the world would end. If you guessed December 21st 2012, you would be correct. I know there were other dates, but those were predicted by people adding random numbers off the bible, nothing meaningful. The 21st had significance because the Mayan calendar ends there which gave people the fear that the world would end that day. People were scared and you could feel it. I still recall that the radio station I usually used to tune into was having their broadcast from a church; there was no music playing, only people reciting prayers.   
On that day I was in the process of curing a hangover. In the past few days I had been drinking myself to death, life had been more than rough  at the time. I was fired from my job on top of that my girlfriend had left me for a guy she had been cheating on me with. The only reason that I stopped drinking was because my mother had called asking me to join my family in the local church so we could spend the last day on Earth together. When I got there I saw that most of the neighborhood was packing themselves like sardines into the church. At that moment I had to empty the tank. I decided to go around to the forest in the back of the church, given that there was no way that I could make it into the restroom inside.   
Walking for a bit looking for a place where I was far enough away to not be spotted by someone, last day on earth and I was still worried someone would think me pissing near the church would be seen as a hate crime or something worse. After a few more steps something out of the corner of my eye caught my attention, it was a man in a dark black cloak with some red markings around it. He was surround it in a circle that was made of some white powder, symbols were drawn on the inside, he was reciting a chant in what turns out was latin it went something along the line of “Qui enim omnia videt, audi me ad probandum consanguineum meum, qui ejusdem sanguinis particeps sum, ac vivo dignus.'' which loosely translates to “For he that seeth all things, hear me to prove my kinsman, that I am partaker of the same blood, and worthy to live.”. Suddenly a blinding light surrounded the circle accompanied with a strong wind blowing hard enough to almost knock me over.   
All of a sudden he turned around not surprised to see me there, almost like he was expecting me to be there. He stretched out his hand towards me and said “come with me child, there is not much time left, if you wish to live past this day grab my hand and help me convince him.” “Grab my hand and complete the circuit .” I don’t know what compelled me but I started to fight the wind and slowly make my way towards him. In my mind I was thinking what the hell was I doing for all I know this could be a drug addict and I am about to be killed or mugged or both. Once I grabbed onto his hand he shouted “In the name of the all seer, I seek judgment for existence”.   
It all suddenly felt weird there was no air, the ground was gone, and my surroundings were just white. Nothing was there any more, the forest was gone, “look forward he will soon judge us' ' The cloaked man said. I turned around to see a giant eye looking down at the both of us, somehow without a mouth it said “I can see that you decided to bring someone with you life seeker, do you plan to use him to judge the rest of mankind.” “You're going to do what?” I asked what he meant by that, “I should not be the person used to judge mankind there like a hundred people better than me back in the church” I yelled. “Just stay calm and let him into your mind” the cloaked man said. Suddenly a beam of light hit my forehead, I saw everything I had ever experienced. My birthday’s, good days, bad days, the most important moments in my life like when I got accepted to college and also days where I was at my worst which was many including the day my first dog died. “Looks like the balance of this life has been unpleasant lately, but there seems to be leaning to the right all together, overall this person you brought makes a compelling case lifeseeker.” The eyeball said. “I shall let your kind continue for now, but remember if they wipe themselves out there is nothing I can do ” he continued.   
Suddenly a bright red flash was all I could see and the color gray was all I saw. It took me a moment to realize that the gray  I was seeing was the sky, somehow I was back where we began laying on the floor. When I stood up the cloaked man was beside me, “what the hell was that!” I asked him loudly. “A God” he replied. “That was God, like God God” I exclaimed.  “That was a God clean your ears dumbass” he snarked back. My mind went into a state that I can't describe, what did he mean by a God, was there more, how many more, and if so what was the point of the event that just happened. “I know you have questions so I'll keep it short. That was a God,there are many not just one, and what you helped me do is stop an apocalypse” He said. I was in shock. Everything that hit me was hard to process then I finally opened my mouth, “A” was all I managed to say. “Yes a as in one, this was not the first I have stopped, remember harold camping’s prediction of may 2011 that one was real and i managed to stop it in time ” he replied in an annoyed tone. “There have been a lot of near disasters that would have cost the world to end, but the creed I was sworn into protects the world and now you are to be next in line as the lifeseeker” he continued. I finally spoke up “you are out of your goddamn mind you fucking lunatic” I said. “Okay then I guess the next apocalypse is going to happen and it's going to be your fault” he said angrily. “Very hard to argue with that logic, fine what it is going to take” I answered back. “Abandon everything you know is true, say goodbye to your loved ones, and open your eyes to the truth,” he said. That was the day that my training to be the new lifeseeker began.  
After I parted ways with my mother I went to sturdy under the lifeseeker who let me call him james, james taught me all kinds of mythology that was unknown to the rest of the world, like ancient beings from other world that came here and sped up the evolutionary process that resulted in the creation of humans. Another were ancient beings from another detention that seek to destroy worlds for their amusement . I learned what I like to call spells and rituals that help me put up barriers to prevent things from crossing over to this world or gather things to sacrifice in order to appease gods and keep them from destroying the world. The teachings of the creed of life were a type of secret employment, turns out many religious leaders know the truth that James had been teaching me and they pay handsomely so they can keep breathing.  
 Two years of watching and assisting James he said i was ready to prevent my first apocalypse, we went down to some remote town in the middle of nowhere Mexico to prevent a mayan god by the name Cizin from starting a zombie outbreak. When we arrived the ground was constantly shaking a small amount but the more that time passed the harder it started to shake harder and as the sun went down a green glow started to shine from the cracks in the ground. “You better have that sacrifice ready or were al fucked” james yelled. “Working on it” I replied. Once I said that the ground really started to open and corpses started to dig themselves up from the dirt they were buried in. They started to attack the people that decided to not evacuate when the first tremors began, they were eating them. The screams of people and the undead munching down on them made me sick. Then a massive hole opened up and a giant skeleton hand started coming up. “YOU BETTER HURRY OR WE ARE A DEAD” James screamed at the top of his lungs. “OKAY DONE” I yelled. Once I killed the sacrifice the skeleton hand started to go back under the ground and the undead went with them too. Some of the dragged people who were still living, I’d feel bad, but James taught me in this line of work there has to be some sacrifices made. “Well not that bad for your first apocalypse, but you understand that if you hadn't killed the sacrifice in time there would be an outbreak of zombies right” he chuckled as he spoke. “I’m aware of it James,” I responded. Many years have passed since my first apocalypse, I went on to stop the second flood, and volcanoes from erupting in unisense on top of many more, but all I wonder is when will I find the person to become the next lifeseeker. I'm getting too old for this crap.
