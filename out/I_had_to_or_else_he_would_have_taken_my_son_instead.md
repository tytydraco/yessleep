This is an experience of my late grand dad Percy. My late grand dad naver told me this story in person but my uncle, my grand dad's first born son narrated this experience because apparently my uncle's life was at stake. 

My grand dad used to work in the railway department and as a privilege he was given accommodation in the department married quarters for the whole family for a duration of five years. The experience that I am about to note down occurred during this stay of the family at the departmental married quarters in the 1960s. My grand dad was a really fit sportsman who used to played rugby and then transitioned into body building and martial arts. Grand dad Percy was in his 40s and my Uncle was about 6 or 7 years of age and he was the only child in the family at the time. 

Being a sportsman and a martial artist, it obviously implies that my grand dad was a man full of confidene, had a very outspoken personality and was relatively fearless. Grand mother of course was the calm and quiet housewife who managed the house hold and kept things smooth and was the typical housewife of the 60s but with strong willpower and love for the family.

Things had gone past smooth and a few months had passed by while the family settled in the married quarter. The back yard of the married quarter opened up into a small swath of woodland begining with a line of banana trees popping out and taking up most of the space in the line of sight with their leaves about 50 feet from the house. The front of the married quarter opened up onto the carpeted road leading straight to the railway station and in the 60s, the area was not that densely populated with houses placed around 50 meters apart and during the night when sun sets, people settle into their homes and had nothing much to do apart from having dinner and going to sleep. 

My grand dad used to love having a smoke sitting at the porch in the back yard and enjoyed the cool breeze flowing from the woodland every night before going to bed and used to tuck my uncle in and go to sleep. My grand dad did not entertain alcohol in his system being a lifelong fitness enthuist and a sportsman but had the occassional drink or two with his buddies. 

As the family grew ever more comfortable with their stay in the maaried quarter, my grand dad used to notice that a wild bore used to appear from behind the line of the banana leaves and look straight at the house staying still for a few minutes. My grand dad had not noticed any wild animal roaming around in the woods during the day and even the railway department to whom the married quarter belonged had not informed my grand dad about any potential wild life that may be a threat to the family. The woods was supposed to be void of wild life and a single wild bore habitually appearing at night and just stare at the house was rather odd. But my grand dad shrugged it off thinking that maybe it was out there to pick on the bananas falling from the trees and had not told anyone.

The sighting of the wild bore became a routine appearance for my grand dad even showing it to my uncle and my grand mother as well but what the wild bore did when it appeared from out the tree line deeply disturbed my grand mother since what it did was nothing else but stare at the house. My grand dad had even tried to chase it away by throwing rocks at it but it seemed to be unphased and of course there are no firearms allowed in the country so the option of shooting at the bore was out of the question. No matter what my grand dad threw at the bore, exactly around the time of sun set when everything becomes engulfed in the darkness of the night sky, the wild bore would not miss its queue to show up and stare at the house. 

A few weeks had gone past and my grand dad noticed a change in the routine of the wild bore. The wild bore would show up, retreat to the woods and then the banana trees towards the which the wild bore retreated would stat shaking violently while everything else stayed still. My grand dad would notice a dark silhouette of a tall and well built human behind the banana trees. My grand dad used to call out to the dark silhouette to ask if some one was there and when pointing flash lights at the site would reveal nothing. With the appearance of the silhouette, the entry of the wild bore stopped all together and during the holidays, my grand dad cut out most of the banana trees and cleared the line of sight but again on the night my grand dad described the encounter between the entity,  my grand dad had seen the dark silhouette standing right where the bananana trees were and had gone after it alone. 

Because my grand dad was late to come to bed, grand mother and my uncle had gone out to the back door porch and had witnessed my grand dad punching and kicking the air as if he was fighting something unseen shouting out loud "You will not take them, its either you or me". Afraid to the bone and unable to think of what to do next, my grand mother had run out to the railway station with my uncle to get the help of the security staff and when my grand mother and uncle had returned with a night guard, my grand dad was lying flat on his face with a mark of a black palm on his back with his shirt torn as if he was mangled by a wild dog. My grand dad was rushed to the near by medical center and when he awoke he immediately asked for his son (my uncle) and had told him to never go to the back yard alone even during the day. 

My grand dad when recovered, handed over the married quarter immediately and left with the whole family. According to my grand dad, he had encountered a demonic entity known in Sri Lanka as "Maha Sona"  who was considered a renowned warrior during the age of great kings who after his glory days got plunged into a life of sin and depravity which got him killed by one of his fellow warriors who slew "Maha Sona" by decapitating his head and burning it. But due to the immense power and prestige the warrior's name bosted, a witch had resurrected the fallen warrior by replacing the decapitated head with a head of a bear. The demon is infamous for riding a wild bore into battle with forces of the light and loves bathing in the blood of the innocent. The signature kill blow of the demon is the palm strike to the back of the head which luckily my grand dad had dodged and it had hit him on his back. 

My grand dad who was furious when he saw the black silhouette standing near the place where the banana trees stood, had gone out to see for himself what the silhouette really was and when he got close, the demonic entity had revealed himself to my grand dad and demanded the blood of my uncle who was a mere child at the time. My grand dad had fought bravely against this demonic entity denying the entity his son. My grand dad had now passed away but he got himself a tattoo of the demonic entity on his back just as the fol tales describe the demon. That was how brave he was.
