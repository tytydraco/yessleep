Has anyone ever had the EXACT SAME hallucination as the person they were tripping with? 

Let me tell you what you need to know first. I’m Aaron, and I’ve been on bullshit house arrest for about a month now. I live with my aunt and uncle in a boring ass suburban town and there’s been fuck all to do lately. I was tired of beating my meat and watching Hulu so I started spying on my next door neighbor. Yes like in that shitty Shia Labeouf movie. 

I’ve never bothered to learn his first name but everyone in the neighborhood calls him Mr. Talbot. He moved to the area only about a year ago. No wife. No kids. 

My aunt spoke to him a few times around when he first moved. She said he used to work for the movies or something and that he was nice. You know…the kind of nice you use when someone is so forgettable that you have nothing else to say about them. 

I’ve never had a conversation with the guy. Only exchanged the occasional wave or head nod. And to be honest I don’t know what I expected from a 50-something year old loner who barely leaves the house. But everyone has their secrets right? 

After a few weeks of spying on him, I really only learned where he keeps the spare key to his backdoor, that he changed the chlorine in his hot tub yesterday morning, and that he waters his back garden every other day around dusk.

But after what I witnessed tonight…I think Mr. Talbot is more interesting than he’s letting on. 

My aunt and uncle are on a cruise until next week so my friend Charlie came over. Charlie is short for Charlotte. She lives a few houses down and before anyone asks, NO it’s not like that. We’ve been like brother and sister since I moved in with my aunt and uncle when I was 8. Plus she’s gay. 

It was supposed to be a chill night. Charlie brought over a few grams of shrooms and we were going to trip for the first time in months. I’m not the biggest psychedelic guy because I tend to get in my head. Even before my probation, I cut back on weed because I kept having panic attacks. But shrooms are pretty much the only thing that doesn’t pop on a drug test and we were only supposed to do a low dose. 

At first, we only took maybe 2 grams each. But after an hour, we didn’t feel shit. Charlie figured we just didn’t take enough so we took more and after about 30 minutes…

Holy Shit. I took way TOO MUCH. It was like I was on the deck of a crab boat. The entire world was swaying. And if you’ve ever tripped absolute sack before you know the feeling of not really knowing what’s real life. I started panicking. Convinced we were stuck in one of those old rubber hose cartoons so Charlie thought it’d be a good idea to lie on the front lawn and watch the stars. 

I’m just realizing now that it’s a full moon tonight…

It worked at first and I started to calm down. Then I noticed that all of Mr. Talbot’s blinds were shut. I thought he had caught onto me and was going to call my probation officer and tell him that I was on drugs. 

“Just focus on the sky,” Charlie said. 

That’s what she tells me whenever I get nervous and start having a panic attack. It worked this time and I was fine for awhile as the shrooms started to wear off.

Around 10:30 I think, we noticed a Lyft pull up in front of Mr. Talbot’s house and drop off some chick. She was probably a few years older than us. Pretty hot and was rolling that kind of suitcase you bring on a plane. Mr. Talbot usually doesn’t have guests so I kept watching.  

He answered the door with a big smile and they hugged and went inside. I didn’t think too much of it after that and figured she was his niece or something visiting for a few days since there’s a big concert in the city this weekend. 

An hour or so later, Charlie and I were watching music videos in my room when we heard a girl’s scream that sounded like it came from next door. We ran to my bedroom window and looked over to Mr. Talbot’s. His niece was standing in the middle of the backyard. Barefoot. Wearing this weird red dress sorta thing. Charlie said it's called a corset. 

The girl was slowly backing away from the house toward the hot tub at the far side of the backyard. Her eyes were fixed on the backdoor and she looked really scared.  

“Hello? Is someone there?” 

I think that’s what she said but it was hard to hear over the music so I had Charlie mute the TV.

The girl’s eyes stayed glued to the backdoor.

“What’s she looking at?” Charlie asked nonchalantly. 

I didn’t know why but my heart immediately started racing. Like I went into fight or flight mode. *Was she in danger?* 

I could feel myself starting to panic again and Charlie must’ve sensed it too because she put her hand on my shoulder. 

*Just focus on the sky*. 

We watched the girl hurry over to the hot tub. Her head on a swivel. Constantly checking behind her. 

“Is someone following her?” I asked. But Charlie didn’t say anything. Just kept watching.

The girl quickly climbed up the hot tub steps and stopped at the top. That’s when she…started…taking off her clothes…?

*What the fuck*. 

Even though I didn’t understand what was going on, it still seemed like a weird fucking time for her to start stripping down to her skivvies.

But as long as Charlie was calm I thought things would be fine. In all the years I’ve known her I don’t think I’ve ever seen her freak out once. 

I looked back at the girl. Her eyes widened before she jumped into the water and scurried toward the far corner of the hot tub. 

Suddenly Charlie gasped. I turned to her and saw that she was covering her mouth with her hands. 

“What?” I asked. Then I followed her gaze to Mr. Talbot’s backdoor…

And there it was. 

I swear my brain short-circuited when I first saw it. 

Fur. 

That was the first thing I was able to process. White, wispy fur that covered this…THING from head to toe. 

Then…the claws. 

These curved, black claws. As long as candlesticks. 

The teeth. 

Sharp. Jagged. Jutting out from this ugly, snarling mouth. 

It was some kind of animal. A wolf I thought at first. But it was standing upright. A bear. A white bear? A polar bear! But that doesn’t make any sense. We don’t have any of those in this part of the country. 

Then I noticed something else…

THE COCK! Holy Shit. It was like a foot long. And soft too. Just dangling there between its legs. 

I rubbed my eyes and tried to remind myself that I was still tripping. That whatever was going on was probably completely normal. Except…I wasn’t tripping. Not anymore. At least I don’t think so. I swear the shrooms had worn off at that point. But what I was seeing didn’t make any goddamn sense. 

Before I could really process anything, Charlie whispered…

“Is that a fucking werewolf?”

Whatever it was, it stood in the doorway of the backdoor for a few seconds. Just looking at the girl in the hot tub. She stared back. Frozen. With fear in her eyes. 

After a moment, the werewolf slowly approached her. Walking upright. Until it stopped at the edge of the hot tub. 

The girl stayed in the far corner. 

“Please don’t hurt me daddy,” she said to it. 

I looked at Charlie confused. Did I hear that right? Did she just call this thing…daddy?

IDK maybe that isn’t what she said. Again it was very faint.

The werewolf just stayed at the edge of the hot tub. Not moving. Still just staring at the girl. 

After a minute or two she started slowly approaching the thing, shuffling through the water with the back of her hand raised. Like you do when you go to pet a dog. She held out her hand in front of it for a moment. 

The thing moved its head slightly toward her hand. And the girl jerked her arm back. 

The werewolf remained like a statue. Eyes never moving from the girl. After a few seconds, she tried again. Holding her hand out in front of the werewolf’s snout. It seemed to sniff her hand for a second then lowered its head toward her chest. 

The girl then began fucking CARESSING the werewolf’s head. Like you would a pet. And I guess that gave her the courage to hug the fucking thing. 

She pressed her wet half naked body against it and rested her head against its chest so it kinda looked like they were slow-dancing. 

“Aaron, are you seeing this too?” Charlie asked. 

“A werewolf dancing with some chick like they’re at prom?” I said without looking at her.

“Yeah.” 

My eyes stayed on the werewolf as it nestled its snout between the girl’s neck and shoulder. 

When SUDDENLY the girl pulled away and rushed back to the far corner of the hot tub, splashing water everywhere. The werewolf stood in place SHAKING. Steadying itself against the rim of the hot tub. It started making these loud GRUNTS. Like it was in pain.

Whatever was happening, it ended after idk maybe 30 seconds. The werewolf seemed to regain its composure and stood upright at the edge of the hot tub, locking eyes with the girl again. Its dong was now ROCK HARD. Like a baby’s arm pointing. 

After a moment the girl approached again. Hand raised. Just like before. 

One step. Two steps. Three. Her hand inched closer and closer to the werewolf's snout until she was almost touching it. 

But this time…it didn’t sniff her. It just stood there. Motionless. Staring. 

The girl’s arm began to shake. And as she tried to move back SUDDENLY the werewolf LUNGED at her. Locking its jaws around her collarbone. 

The girl shrieked in pain and pounded on the werewolf’s back with her fists. 

“GRANDMA! GRANDMA!” she screamed. 

*What the fuck. Is this thing her fucking grandma? But it’s got a cock!*

The werewolf wrapped its arms around the girl and ripped her out of the hot tub. She tumbled down the steps and onto the concrete patio. 

“GRANDMA!!!” she screamed as she tried to crawl away. 

Every hair on my body stood up like I had been electrocuted. 

The werewolf snatched her by the ankle and dragged her toward the house. 

“STOP! PLEASE! she screamed, clawing at the ground. She kicked her legs, trying to escape but it wasn’t enough. The werewolf tried to drag her through the backdoor but she latched onto the doorframe with her arms. 

She screamed at the top of her lungs. Straining. And I swear. She saw me. Watching. In the window. 

Our eyes locked. For a split second. I swear. And the look she gave me. It was…familiar.

But before I could even think about where I’d seen it…she was gone. Vanished. Her body dragged inside. 

The night sunk into an eerie silence. Charlie and I didn’t say anything for a while. We just stood there until the crickets started chirping. Like nothing had happened. 

*Had anything happened?*

“Should we call the police?” Charlie finally asked. 

“And tell them what?” I said. 

“I don’t know. What we saw.”

*What we saw*. The words seemed so ridiculous. I mean what did we see? Beauty and the Beast GONE WRONG?! How the fuck are we supposed to explain this? I mean how do we even describe the suspect?!

*Mythological creature. Muscular build. Fat cock.*

Charlie grabbed her phone from my bed. “What the fuck are you doing?!” I yelled at her. 

“Calling the police,” she said. 

“Are you fucking nuts?” I shouted. I was panicking again and tried to rip Charlie’s phone out of her hand but she shoved me hard into my bookcase. 

“I’m on probation! I can’t be involved in some crazy tweak 911 call! You know what will happen to me!” I pleaded. 

Charlie looked up from her phone at me. 

“We have to be hallucinating. That’s it. We’re hallucinating. We have to be! What we saw made no fucking sense,” I said. I was freaking out. Pacing around the room. Pulling my hair. All that shit. 

“Just focus on the sky Aaron,” Charlie said. 

“HOW THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO DO THAT CHARLIE?! WE’RE INSIDE!” 

Charlie slid her phone into her pocket and put both hands on my shoulders.

“Aaron, calm down,” she said. “You’re probably right, okay? Maybe this was all a second wave trip or something. Everything will be fine.”

I asked Charlie to recount what she saw. Every single detail. And her story was the exact same as mine. EXACT SAME. 

“We hallucinated the same thing?” I asked her.

“Probably just a bad trip,” Charlie said, closing the blinds to my bedroom window.

“We just need to sleep it off,” she added and helped me into bed.

I turned away from her and closed my eyes. But all I could see was the look on that girl’s face. This almost blank look. Like she knew she was going to die…PLUS the image of the werewolf’s fucking boner.

I tossed and turned for a bit. I don’t know exactly how long. Once I heard Charlie snoring on the air mattress, I snuck out of bed and tiptoed over to my window to look next door.

It was dark. But in the moonlight, I could tell something was wrong with the water in the hot tub…

It was RED. 

I tried taking some pictures but none of them came out well. My phone's zoom doesn't go that far and it's too dark for the camera to pick up anything clearly. But I'm absolutely certain about what I saw.

I don’t know what else to do now. 

Can someone help explain this?

Two people can't have the exact same hallucination right?

**What we saw had to have been real**. 

Right?

Will update tomorrow.
