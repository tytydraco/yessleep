I kept running but the road was covered in darkness , All street lights were destroyed making anything far away barely visible. I did not know how far I was or how long it would take to find Dave. 


Suddenly there was a scream , But it wasn't from my front. I looked to the right , That's where the scream came from. I noticed footprints on the soil , about 3 of them . The UNF guys must've gone that way , I started sprinting away from the road towards the trees.


It was a forest , A lot of trees were in the way. You could hear the sound of insects , branches breaking and leaves crunching with every step. The only light there was the moon's light, I kept running with only the moon as my guide.


I finally saw some broken trees , "Dave must be around here" I thought. I started walking , Following the path made by the broken trees. They weren't just plucked out of the soil , It was like a huge hammer went through them at the same time.


"Stop right there" a voice said.


I looked to my left where the voice came from , There was a figure standing there. It was now getting closer.


"Put your hands up or I'll blow your brains out" It said.


As the figure got closer , I realised it was a man holding a pistol. I put my hands up.


"I volunteered to stand guard cause I didn't think anyone would come here , But here you are" he said.


Seems like he didn't know who I was , I could use that to my advantage. 


"Well who are you guys and what do you want?" I asked.


"Why the hell should I tell you?" he replied , Now pointing the gun to my head.


"Consider it a dead man's last wish" I replied. 


"Well can't dishonour that" he said as he took a step back.


"We are the Unnatural Fanatics. We worship unnatural and the OU. My boss seems to be here to tame that monster or whatever that is , She calls it 'an unnatural human, the perfect creature'. The thing seemed to go that way so she went after it." He said as he pointed towards the path of broken trees.


"Any other last words?" he said as he took a step closer.


"Well thanks.....and sorry about this." I said as I punched him on his stomach using my left arm.


He went flying backwards by the force of my punch and crashed into a tree. He didn't die but did go unconscious.


I again started walking towards the direction of the broken trees. Suddenly there was a scream from the direction which Dave went towards , I started running towards it.


I finally saw Dave , But I wasn't exactly happy. Dave had impaled a man using one of his now 6 arms. There was a hole in the man , Through which blood was pouring out. His eyes were dripping red which met the river of blood flowing from his mouth. His intestines were visible as they hung from the hole in his body.


I noticed a woman standing in front of Dave at a closer distance than me. It took some adjusting of my eyes to clearly see her , But when I did.....I realised who she was. It was Britney Ralts , The missing girl whose investigation dragged me into this mess. The worst part about this was that....She seemed excited seeing that man get impaled.


"Oh magnificent! You have exceeded my expectations , You're so much better than I thought! I want you.....I will have you." She said.


She took out a knife and cut off her arm. No way......She was doing the ritual.


"DON'T DO IT" I yelled at her 


She threw her severed arm in the air completely ignoring me.


"Custodi me et esto mihi custos. Hic contractus manebit donec unus ex nobis pereat" She chanted loudly.
