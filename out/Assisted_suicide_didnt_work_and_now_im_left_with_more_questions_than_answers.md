I was tired. Of everything. Of my minimum wage job that paid for absolutely nothing, of the constant bills that added up, of seeing my friends do better than me, of the constant unhappiness consuming me. I wanted a way out, of course. I thought of maybe leaving the country and starting a new life. But I was way too poor for that. Maybe trying to find a girlfriend? That didn’t work. Maybe going to the gym to distract myself? That didn’t work either. So I thought the best option out, was suicide. I tried to overdose but clearly, I didn’t take enough pills because I woke up the next day delirious and feeling like shit. I was too scared to try the other methods, because I’m a wuss, so I gave up on that. 

The only thing in my life that gave me happiness was alcohol, and I was beginning to spend the little money I had on it. 

Last week, as I was bored out of my mind, a text message popped up on my phone. 

“You’ve been selected for an Assisted suicide free of charge! Come to this address: ___ _____ !”

Me, being a dumbass decided to go to the address. I searched for the address on Google Maps. A photo of a clinic named “Smile!”  Popped up. It didn’t have any reviews, and it was only a 10-minute walk. Seems legit. So I got up from my bed, left my house, and strolled through the streets, smiling to myself. I could finally, get a way out. I got a few weird stares.  I happily followed the directions, practically skipping each path Google Maps took me. Until I found myself standing in front of the clinic that looked exactly like the photo. I walked inside, and a guy with long curly hair wearing a suit was sitting at a desk. He smiled at me and I showed him the text I had got. 

“Oh, you’re Dave? Follow me!” He said cheerfully. 

I was confused. “How do you know my name?” I asked. 

“Don’t worry! It doesn’t matter. Nothing matters.” 

I decided not to question him further and followed him. The clinic was pretty clean and the smell of medicine filled my nose. I liked that smell. He led me into a room with a singular chair and a cupboard full of syringes. 

“Sit down,” he said. 

I sat down. The chair was pretty uncomfortable but I tried to not think much of it. 

“Now before I do this, are you sure you want to go through with this? There’s no going back, remember.” 

“I’m more ready than ever.”

With that, he rummaged through the cupboard of syringes and took a syringe full of purple liquid out. He smiled to himself. I couldn’t tell if it was sincere or not. It just didn’t look right …

“Close your eyes, okay? This will hurt a little.”

I closed my eyes and winced a little as the syringe pierced my skin. I could feel the cold liquid enter my bloodstream, and it somehow felt calming. 

“All done. Now just keep your eyes closed and relax,” he said. 

I felt calmer than ever as I kept my eyes closed. My breathing became slower, and I felt my heart slowing. The melodic sound of a piano played in my mind as I drifted off into the afterlife….

…Or so I thought. My eyes open and I’m met with a hallway with a bunch of doors. I get up from the floor and look at my surroundings, in complete confusion. Before I can even register what’s happened I see a figure open one of the doors and slowly walk up to me. I almost screamed, frozen in place with fear. Something, that looked human, but had no face, and had claws for hands pointed straight at me. It towered over me, its imposing nature sending chills down my spine. 

“What is this… who are you?? What am I doing here???”

I didn’t get a response…Its long claw just pointed at me, as if I was an intruder. As if i didn’t belong in this place. Then something else opened a door and walked up to me. It was a human..? At least it looked human. A man who was wearing sunglasses and a long black cloak. 

“You’re not supposed to be here.” He said seriously. “How did you even get here in the first place?”

I tried to keep my composure, even though I was 2 seconds away from trying to run away in fear.  “Uh..assisted suicide..”

“You went to the wrong world. I need to kill you.”￼

I look at the man, even more perplexed than before. The wrong…world???

“What do you mea—“

Before I could finish my sentence, the thing without the face and the long claw which was still pointing at me wrapped its claws around my neck. I could feel the stabbing pain of its claws around my neck getting tighter and tighter, digging into my skin, giving me no access to air. I tried to gasp for air, tears beginning to stream down my face. Once again, I began to hear that same melodic piano as my head started spinning and I could see a bright light… and for some reason, I felt genuine dread. 

Then darkness clouded my vision. 

My eyes opened once again, and I was back in the chair, in the clinic. I could still feel the throbbing pain in my neck, a reminder of how I got back here in the first place. I got up from the chair in a panic and looked around frantically, dazed and terrified. 

“What is this place? What the fuck did you do to me? Where was I? WHO ARE YOU?”

The same man with the long curly hair who wore a suit, looking at the syringe with now nothing in it looked at me, raised an eyebrow then simply chuckled. “You were supposed to die, but I’m guessing you went to that place huh.”

“What do you mean?? Can you please explain??”

“Come back next week!” He said, dodging my question. 

“Can you please explain??”

“Come back next week!”

I sighed and got up from the chair, left the clinic, and walked back home as questions danced around my head and my neck still hurting like a bitch. When I made it back home, I just started sobbing. I don’t know why, but I just needed to have a good cry. Because I didn’t know what the fuck I just experienced. And I still don’t. 


Now, as I’m writing this story, I just want to know: is there more than one world out there? Has this happened to anyone else?
