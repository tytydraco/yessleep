Over the last few years or so I haven't been out much, at all really. My social life basically shut down. A few acquaintances, the people that you see every so often around town and share a few pointless words with.

*'Hows the family?', 'Are you still working there?', 'Good to see you'.* Just pointless banter and small talk.

Last week something different happened, I got invited to a dinner.

Freida, she said her name was, a friend of an acquaintance, Jung. Last week while I was at the market downtown I ran into them. Both of them had like some kind of weird 'aura' about them. Hard to describe but it was  like everything in this world was going well for them. Almost like these people were living in a whole different set of rules or society... I know it sounds crazy.

But anyways, at the market, this girl Frieda invited us over for dinner. I thought why not just do something out of the ordinary. It's not like she was a complete stranger, friend of a 'friend', why not have a dinner at her place?

So I got to her apartment around six and she buzzed me in. This was the nice part of town, marble fountain outside, metallic trim, expensive cars everywhere. Another 'successful' person I thought, really trying not to be jealous.

So I get to her apartment and the floor is eerily quiet, almost like, literally no one lives there. So when she opens the door and let's me in I'm all awkward, and try and make a corny joke about it like *'wow, you got this whole floor to yourself or something?'* (yeah I know it's a lame joke) to break the ice or whatever, idk, like I said I haven't been social for a while.

But what was weird was she looked at me and said 'why yes I do...' and sort of chuckled it off. You know how you can sort of tell when someone is joking or telling the truth, well I got the feel that she was actually serious.

Okay, maybe she's loaded?

So she put on this jazz record and offered something to drink. We were talking for a while and I actually started to relax a bit. The other acquaintance Jung was supposed to show up but he cancelled last minute. At first it was a little weird, well I'm socially inept or whatever but it was fine.

So after a while she showed me around a little and started to prep the food. Clearly she did have money, the apartment was *nice*, designer furniture, classy artwork, the works. I sort of felt out of place to be honest.

She started cooking and I went to the washroom and that's when things started to go, uh, awry. Now look, I know this is going to sound absolutely batshit insane but I'm serious about this.

When I got into the washroom I saw this beautiful painting. It was mesmerizing. Now the subject was nothing out of the ordinary, just some village but the technique was incredible. I looked closely at the name of the painter and it was signed with nothing other than a large 'F'.

Now this is where you'll need a tinfoil hat, cause I'm about to start connecting red strings all over the board and it's not gonna make sense but I'm telling you... just trust me okay.

So I go back to the kitchen and Frieda isn't there. I call out, and there's nothing but silence. Then I start thinking about how there was no noise on the floor and sort of get weirded out. Like I don't even know this person at all really... then she seemingly appeared out of nowhere behind me.

It actually was strange how silent she was.

I tried to make conversation.

"That's a brilliant painting you have in the washroom." I said

"Oh? Do you like it?' she said inquisitively.

"Yeah, it's so mundane but somehow brilliant at the same time. Who is it by? There was only an 'F' in the corner"

*'It's my work, I painted it'* she said deadpan while chopping away.

'Y-you painted it?' I said stunned, the work was exceptional, surely she was joking. It was clearly a print of one of the European 'masters'. *Great*... another bullshitter, I thought.

'No word of a lie, that is my painting.' she said still deadpan. I could swear her focus was intensified as she was cutting. The chop sound echoing rhythmically.

"You must but joking. That has to be a print. You paint? No one who paints like that would be working as a chef! Come on, it looks like it was painted a hundred years ago...' I was saying the words but really, I almost didn't believe it myself, because I got no sense she was lying at all.

*"What can I say?'* as if she was posing the question to herself literally.

*'I painted it."* she said as if it was final, then a subtle smirk.

Was that disdain?

'Right... wow, that's incredible' I said uncomfortably.

This was no ordinary painting. Why lie about something like that? The vibe was just weird now.

Did she really paint it?

She put a plate in front of me, the steam rising rapidly. 'Bon apetit' she said in perfect french. The dish looked incredible, some type of vegetable cream. In spite of the awkwardness that had just transpired I began to eat.

My mouth fell open. The dish looked incredible, but the taste was... *it was horrendous*. Almost rancid, like artichokes that had gone off. Compost. I struggled not to gag. The creamy texture only worsened the pungent bite.

"Not to your palette?" she said amused, her accent taunting me.

*"I'm sorry... no"* I said embarrassed covering my mouth as I strained, trying not to cough.

"I'm really sorry' I said tears forming in the outer corners of my eyes. The smell had been no indication of the horrible taste.

*That's when I really started to look around the room.*

As if the pungent taste of the dish had almost woken me up. I started to notice how bizarre some of the decor really was. I brazenly began to walk around inspecting the items in her apartment closely.

A bust... 'Freidrich Heimer II' I said confused. 'You have a bust of Freidrich Heimer the second?' my tone almost weary. Some part of my brain was working in overdrive; an irrational paranoia after the encounter with the bitter dish. *'It must have been poison...'* a voice said in the back of my head.

"I try to keep myself inspired" she said emotionless

"Freidrich Heimer II keeps you inspired... but why?" I said confused

"Like I said... I try to keep, *my self*... inspired" she said reiterating.

Keep herself inspired... *what*? I looked at the bust and back at here. Was I losing my mind or did she look like him in some bizarre way. I pinched my eyes, my forehead now damp. I had to get going, it was definitely awkward now, at least for me at that point.

I looked around some more. A shelf filled with memorabilia from some vlogger I had never heard of "Fred-ay!". A platinum plaque congratulating 'Fred-ay!' on his accomplishments.

*How on earth did she get this?*

"Wow... big fan I said" trying not to sound judgemental. "The plaque even... replica? Must have cost a fortune." I said trying to force a smile.

"They sent it to me. Why would I pay for it?" she said laughing as if it was the stupidest thing she had heard.

"To... you... they sent it to you?" I said confused "You paint like the renaissance, a 5 star chef, and you've worked for a famous vlogger?" She really was a bullshitter...

"You could say that" she said coldly as she danced her fingers along the chefs blade.

I looked at a book on the coffee table. 'Fredrickton...' I said a lump forming in my throat.

'Oh yes, one of my favourites. Rough start we had there..." she was now carving into the counter top with the tip of the blade ever so gently...

I felt like I was in the Twilight Zone, Was I was getting dizzy? Maybe I wasn't paranoid after all? Was my temperature rising? I had to sit down. I looked at the table beside me.

Another book that looked ancient 'Classical Poems of *Friedrick Durrple*'... everything in this room was connected to either a 'Fred' or 'Freida'. I was bewildered, it was incredibly strange. Why did she have all of this?

*Obsessed with her own name???*

"Oh those were the days... people were more trusting back then. In general at least" it sounded like she was recounting personal experience and not giving her opinion on a bygone age.

"Some of my best work" she gripped the blade, now in her hand, she had walked around the island in the kitchen and was slowly walking toward the living room.

"Your work..." I said in a daze almost

"I've lived a full life... what can I say?" she said as she flipped the blade expertly through her fingers.

I really was starting to feel sick. This didn't make any sense. I was really going to pass out. This didn't happen in real life I thought... I never go out, and the first night I do, it's to a deranged persons house?

I fell to the floor, sweating profusely. I was losing consciousness.

"Are you ready to...'

"Die?" she said as she slowly lifted the blade.

'No...' was all I could muster, my throat dry. Slowly her face began to contort grotesquely, round and pale, her eyes large and beady, pitch black. Her mouth formed into an impossible Cheshire grin, donning pointed teeth. I tried to scream but it was like I couldn't make a sound. I was starting to pass out.

Then I just, woke up.

The sun was just starting to rise. A large bus pulled up and honked. I waved him off, half asleep. What just happened? How did I get here.

Frieda...

I recoiled as the memory returned. I put my head in my hands. This made no sense... I began to scroll through my phone. That was no dream. To my surprise her number was there, but the messages were gone. I began to pat myself down in search of my wallet.

It was gone.

I knew where I was, a few blocks from home. I would walk, it wasn't far. I could hardly comprehend what had happened. I passed the market where Jung would frequent. I could ask him I thought, if he knew about his friend and her 'condition'.

I haven't seen him since.

I slowly dragged myself home, I was only a few buildings away when I heard a voice, rough and old.

"You dropped something" he said spitting through his broken teeth and stained beard.

I glanced scrupulously... it was my wallet. I know with out a doubt I hadn't dropped it.

I felt a lump in my throat, I slowly looked over the man. My eyes drawn to the red lettering on the patch sewn into his jacket and then to his cold eyes.

"FRED"

I felt my self go limp, I almost threw up. Suddenly the man disappeared behind the corner and into the alleyway.

"WAIT!" I yelled my voice coarse and dry. I tried to run after him.

When I turned the corner there was no one.

I got in and sat down, completely defeated at the events that just occurred. I opened my wallet, everything was in it's place, but there, in one of the card slots was a plain white business card sticking out slightly.

I slowly pulled it from the slot, written in blood were just two words.

*"BE CAREFUL"*

I don't believe in aliens, but whatever that *thing* was, it's isn't human...

*I think they feed off fear.*
