When I was a child, maybe six or seven years old, I remember my parents taking me to an art gallery. I think that’s where my love for it truly started.

We looked at the exhibits, one by one, walked through the quiet, almost silent halls, and stopped in front of every painting, where Dad read to me its description and told me a few facts he knew himself.

Either about the style or, sometimes, the artists themselves.

It was on that day that I began to wonder how people could take something they had seen, put it down onto a canvas, and then somehow breathe life into it.

That’s what makes art great, at least to me.

When you look at it and you can almost feel the atmosphere inside the picture.

It doesn’t matter what's on the canvas either. Great battles, where the sound of the trampling hooves of the cavalry charging into the fray seems almost woven into the colors.

Paintings of flowers or fields where you get the feeling that you could smell the air on that afternoon hundreds of years ago if you just look at it the right way.

Portraits of people who seem to stare right at you, having silent conversations with you about their innermost thoughts.

I just love it. This is what art is to me. What touches me, on a level nothing else can. I can and have spent hours looking at a painting, trying to feel the brush strokes and the emotions the artist wanted to convey. While I might call it a hobby, others claim it’s an obsession.

But on that day at the museum, I caught my first glimpse of the thing that didn’t just touch me but seemed to shift something inside my childlike brain. One could almost say it rewired my entire personality.

I found what I think of as the ultimate form of art, and it had its own corner there.

Statues.

Marble ones, to be specific.

The first time I saw them, I felt my heart fluttering and this strange tightness in my chest. If I loved the paintings, then those things took my breath away.

I could see it, the hours a sculptor spent, not just cutting the stone, but freeing the form of the figure inside from the massive block. Skin that looked almost too real, muscles beneath, that could be tense or soft, faces that stared out into eternity...

Sometimes, when I visit exhibitions like that, I still get the shivers.

It is perfection. Absolute, unreachable, flawless art.

Something people should strive to replicate, but oh so few are able to even grasp the deep meaning behind it.

I tried it myself, of course.

After begging my parents, they paid for an introductory class, but the only thing I found there was disappointment.

The teacher, a lovely woman, had no skill at all. She didn’t understand, didn’t get it...

I was frustrated, and even though back then I claimed it was because I wasn’t taught by a real master, I now think it just wasn’t meant to be.

There is something I am missing, to become an artist. A skill that sets all the great ones apart from us mortals. Some kind of divine spark only one in a billion can even dream of having.

I resigned myself to a normal life from then on.

Studying at school, nurturing relationships with other people, even following in my father’s footsteps career-wise...

But, even though I didn’t have the spark of creation, as I like to call it, it didn’t mean I could escape those dreams.

No matter when or where, I always felt that strange pull, this wonder that kept reaching out to me, sucking me in, whenever I let my mind wander.

All I wanted to do, was to create one masterpiece.

I would give up my own life, my soul, my future... heck, I would offer the lives of all the people I’ve ever known, just to do that.

Nothing else matters that much to me.

At least, that was what I thought back then. Before I found my true purpose.

It all happened one night, during a dream.

I still remember it so vividly, since it changed me and started me on this road I find myself on now.

As so many times before, I was walking through a beautiful garden in my dream, looking at roses that seemed to have come out of a painting, bushes that swirled in strange colors, and, the main attraction, marble statues.

They were of people I knew. Family and friends, captured in what might seem like mundane actions, but now preserved for eternity.

I used to be so jealous of them. They were immortal, standing on their pedestals, staring into nothingness, unbothered by the tumultuous world around them...

Only in this dream, everything changed.

As I made my way through the garden and looked at each and every one of them, I came upon a little corner I had never seen before.

My heart started fluttering and as I raised my eyes, I saw the biggest, most beautiful statue I had ever seen.

It was of my father, standing there, his arms wide open, looking out over it all, as if he was the guardian of that place.

I felt shivers as I saw him, then cold sweat, when I realized what was so strange about the statue.

His eyes were moving.

Slowly, almost glacially, they wandered from side to side, then stopped when they spotted me, and on his face, I found a knowing smile.

In my shock, I didn’t even realize that there was now a second pedestal next to him.

One with my name on it.

The statue of my father held its smile as I climbed up next to it and suddenly felt the purest bliss I ever had.

That was when I woke up, and that was also when I realized my true purpose in life.

This perfection I once wanted to create was in me all along!

Sadly, or luckily, this change didn’t happen instantly, but I could feel it nonetheless.

Over the next day, I lost all sensation in my toes, and as I pulled off my socks to touch them, they felt cold.

As cold as marble.

Since then, every night I dream of the garden again, but now, different people are walking down there, looking up at me in wonder, as I stand there, on my pedestal, embracing eternity. And every morning when I wake up, another part of me has turned lifeless... perfect.

For now, my skin doesn’t feel as hard as marble, but I am sure that will change soon as well. This is a process, after all.

One week after that fateful dream, I couldn’t move my foot at all, and then a month later, my whole left leg and right arm were completely stiff.

I can feel it already. The coldness of marble, deep in my flesh.

It’s been three months since that dream, and I am sitting here, in front of my laptop, having typed out my will already, and found some time to talk to you guys as well.

My friends tell me that I am sick, but I don’t think so. I am about to be free and beautiful. Eternal.

The stone takes me, one cell at a time.

I can hardly move more than a finger now and breathing is becoming difficult.

Maybe one of my lungs has already turned as well.

Marvelous.

It is everything I have ever dreamed of and more.

I can feel it.

My heart rate is going down steadily.

Soon it will stop.

And with its last beat, I will finally open the door to [eternity.](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiodrama/comments/10hqkpe/haunted_tales_a_horror_anthology_podcast/)
