My name is Taylor, and I am a detective working for a federal agency in the US. Obviously, I shouldn't be writing this, so I'm going to have to change the names of people and places, but something really weird is going on, and I feel like this needs to be out there *somewhere*, in case something happens to me, to my boss and colleagues, to all of us, really. I'm getting ahead of myself, let me start at the beginning...

I'm based in Kona, HI. I'm from Alaska originally, so I usually live in AK or HI and work on regional projects there, and fly out when I'm needed in the lower 48 (the continental US for the uninitiated). On December 28, 2023, my boss's boss, a woman named Katelyn, who is based in Los Angeles, called for a Zoom meeting with me, my boss Harvey, and fellow agents Aaron, based in Seattle, Monty, based in Denver, and Melanee, based in Phoenix. She told us that flights were being arranged as we spoke for us all to fly into LA on January 2, as there was a "potentially grisly" case going on out in the desert. Again, I don't want to be too specific about where, but it's in the southwestern part of the US.

After telling us we'd be flying out on the 2nd, she briefed us on the case -- people have been disappearing from this small, southwestern US town. A retired federal agent happens to live in the town and works as a security guard in his retirement, and he started looking into things. It was slow going at first, but then he thought he discovered something big, something out of a movie. Nearly everyone who had disappeared could be linked back to a truck stop cafe, all of the people had been there in the days before their disappearances, and with some of the people, it was the last place that they were seen. Less than a year prior, a big company had bought out the gas station and quicky mart that is attached to the cafe. The company bought it from the original owner, who took the substantial earnings from the sale and moved to Gulf Shores, AL. This left the cafe empty, and the big company who bought the truck stop leased the cafe a few months later to two guys who were new in town.

They reopened the cafe quietly, and nothing changed for a few months. Then, the parent company started catching wind of some Yelp reviews about their truck stop/quicky mart/cafe -- five stars across the board. The reviews poured in, it was like every single person who stopped there wrote a stellar five star review about the place, and every single one was about the cafe. "The best cheeseburger I've ever had in my LIFE. The meat is like something otherworldly, the cheese is like American cheese mixed with crack cocaine, and the fries have a flavor like each one was lovingly pan-fried in the finest French butter one by one before making their way to my mouth. I want to quit my job and move to \[redacted\] just so I can have that meal every day of my life" one of the reviews read. The parent company was ecstatic, clearly their move to buy the place had been a good one. 

They started advertising more heavily, putting up billboards for 100 miles in each direction about the truck stop, even including some of the more absurd reviews in them. "Mike from IL thinks our country fried steak could make even his ex-wife smile!" "Parents who claim they have the pickiest eater in the world stunned when little Timmy ate an entire plate of our *liver and onions!*" The ads worked, bringing more people into the little town, and more and more people raved about the food online. This all happened last year, and in the summer was when people began to notice the disappearances. Because it was summer, which is a busy season for this town anyway, and with the increased traffic from tourists and truckers wanting to try out the cafe they kept seeing ads about, no one noticed the disappearances at first, or thought much of them if they did notice. The first people to disappear were people passing through the town, individual people making long cross country or state drives alone, disappearing somewhere along the way. Sad and tragic, but it happens.

When the first person went missing from the town itself is when Walter, the retired agent turned security guard, started investigating. He had been seeing reports in the paper about missing persons along the roads that led in and out of the town, but that wasn't so unusual. He still noted it though, recognizing it as something he may need to remember later. Then, when Jennifer McGraw went missing, he launched a full on (private) investigation. Jennifer was a girl in her mid-20s who had been renting an apartment a little off of the highway for a little over a year. She was a hippy type, taking a gap year between undergrad and grad school to "live quietly in small town USA". And one day she just vanished, no trace of her. She was last seen on her apartment's security cameras walking across the parking lot, seemingly straight into the road, and that's where the trail ends. There's another gas station/quicky mart right across from that apartment complex, and it seemed to be where Jennifer was headed, but she never showed up on their security cameras. She had nothing with her, either, just the clothes she was wearing (a long skirt and short-sleeved top), and the sandals on her feet. No purse, no jacket, nothing. Gone.

The police were called once Jennifer's building manager realized she hadn't been to the apartment in days and had left her cat Pebbles inside. The cat was meowing and scratching at the door, so finally the manager opened the door and realized the cat was out of food and water. She fixed that, and then set about looking for Jennifer, and when it became apparent that no one had seen her in days, and a call to Jennifer's relatives out of state confirmed that they hadn't heard from her either, the police were called in. Everyone who knew Jennifer said that she would never have just left, taking *nothing* with her. At a minimum, she wouldn't have just left Pebbles to die. But she was an adult, and there was no reason to suspect foul play, and after a few weeks the cops stopped looking. Walt didn't, though.

Fortunately, he has a couple connections at the local police department who gave him access to the case materials, and once he started looking into the disappearances it didn't take too long for him to realize that all of the disappearances that had occurred in the past six months within a 50 mile radius were people who had been to the truck stop, specifically the cafe. So he turned his investigation to it, and found a lot more than he'd bargained for.

Walt had eaten at the cafe plenty of times, and it was just as good as everyone on the internet said it was. Somehow, typical diner fare like cheeseburgers, chicken strips, breakfast sausage, and club sandwiches just tasted so much *better* there. When he realized the connection, Walt felt sick to his stomach. There was something sinister about the missing people being connected to a cafe that somehow has the best food anyone has ever tasted. He threw up, thinking about all of the times he had eaten there, and then he picked up the phone, called the cafe, and asked if they did catering orders. He said that he was having family in town and wanted them to get to taste all of the best food from the popular cafe. One of the two owners said sure, they could do that, so Walt ordered one of everything on the menu, to pick up the next day. 

That night, he tried to find out as much information at he could about the two owners, but could find nothing. They had said they were brothers from the east coast, John and James MacDonald. It was really no surprise that he couldn't find them, given such little, generic information. They looked generic too, white guys of average build and height, brown hair, brown eyes. No social media profiles to speak of. Walt searched all night, but couldn't find a trace of them. The next day, he went and picked up and paid for his massive order, put it in the trunk of his car so he wouldn't have to smell it, and then instead of driving home to his small house on the edge of town, he got on the interstate and drove three hours to the Biological Sciences department of a well known US university where his old friend, Dr. Paul Jonas, was waiting. 

Walt had filled Paul in on everything, and he hadn't had to tell him his suspicions by the end of it. Paul runs the entire Biological Sciences department at this college, and he had agreed to test all of the food, particularly the meat. He said it would take a couple of days for the full tests to come back, and Walt decided to stay nearby, preferring not to go back to the small town just yet. If his suspicions were correct, he didn't feel safe in the town, so he got a hotel in the big city where the college is located. The night after he had dropped the food off with Paul, Walt was just dozing off in front of the TV in his hotel room when his cell phone rang. It was Paul, and the preliminary results were in.

"Just tell me," Walt said grimly. "Is it... What we thought? Is the meat... Human?" Paul's voice sounded shaky and agitated when he responded.

"No, it's not human. I ran the tests three times each to be sure." Walt furrowed his brow upon hearing this, it was surely good news, so why did Paul still sound upset?

"Well shit... That's a relief," Walt said carefully. "Is it something else... Bad? Don't tell me they're killing all the neighborhood cats for their recipes or something?" 

"No... No. It's just... Walt, I don't know what kind of meat it is," Paul said haltingly. 

"What? What do you mean?" 

"It's not human, but it's not what it should be, either. It's not beef or pork or chicken, or duck or turkey or even seafood. It's not a meat substitute, like tofu or Beyond or Impossible Meat or anything like that. And it's not cat, dog, it's... It's *nothing* that we have a record of, anywhere. On Earth."

"...what? Are you saying it's extraterrestrial??" 

"No, I'm just saying that I don't know what it is. Nothing about it indicates that it's something that is from the oceans, or any body of water. By all indications, it's a land... Creature. And whatever it is, the other food is fried in the fat, that's why even items with no meat, like the fries, get such good reviews. I'm going to be honest with you, Walt, I've never seen anything like this in my forty plus years in this field. I don't even know who to tell you to call about it." But Walt knew. He called the unit chief at our headquarters and after reviewing all of the tests, they called Katelyn in LA, who assembled our team to figure out what the fuck is going on. 

I wasn't even sure if I believed it, when they told us all of this. It sounded too hokey to be real. Even initially, when everyone thought the meat was people, that sounded like a way too overdone horror trope. But I was intrigued, nonetheless, because I knew we wouldn't be called in if the departments hadn't done their homework. I knew that this was real, we had samples of this weird meat, and no one could figure out what it was, but at the beginning I still believed that there was a reasonable explanation. I mean, how could they have tested for *every* animal/meat on Earth? Maybe it was Komodo dragon meat or something, that would be weird, and illegal, and very expensive, but it was more plausible than the meat being of extraterrestrial origin. Now, I'm not so sure.

I'm writing this because of what happened last night. We've been in the little town over a month, essentially in hiding, spying on the cafe. The only person publicly walking around in the town is Monty, who is the youngest of us all. He is also Hispanic, and has been pretending that he doesn't speak English well. He has heavily implied to the townspeople that he is an illegal immigrant from Mexico, just passing through, and he tried to get a job at the cafe, but the owners wouldn't hire him. Only a couple people work there, and we don't know if the owners knew them before or what. But the owners of the cafe don't have control over the truck stop/quicky mart, so Monty got himself hired there, and has been working on infiltrating the cafe. He has told us that he hears sounds that almost 100% confirm that the cafe has a large basement that sprawls out beneath it. He's gone into the crawlspace of the quicky mart and tried to get through to the other side, but there's no openings, so he is slowly and carefully working on cutting a hole in the wall to get to the cafe side. He has to be very sneaky about this so as not to arouse suspicion from either proprietor. 

He said that he hears strange sounds coming from the basement under the cafe pretty much all the time, but he can't place what the sounds are. He said that once in a while he hears what sounds like muffled human voices talking, but usually he just hears an odd kind of white noise-esque shuffling sound, almost like people talking but warped or garbled. Since Monty is the only one publicly out and about in the town, a large apartment is rented in his name, where we're all staying. Aaron and I mostly do surveillance, we have high powered scopes that let us see the truck stop and the cafe, day and night. So far, we hadn't seen anything noteworthy, until last night. Monty had gotten home from his shift at the quicky mart and was in the shower. Katelyn and Melanee were going over the DNA sequencing of the meat for the hundredth time, Harvey was on his laptop typing up a report, and Aaron and I were at the window, looking through our scopes at the cafe.

Suddenly, a big box truck rumbled into the back parking lot, parked, and out hopped both of the MacDonald brothers. We hadn't seen this truck before. They backed the truck up to the building, which is lined with thick, thorny bushes all along the back. And then they did something incredible, they each went to one end of the back of the building, grabbed the farthest bush on each end, and picked it up. The entire line of huge bushes came up easily, exposing an old fashioned cellar door in the ground attached to the side of the building. The bushes were fake. Aaron and I got the others' attention, this was finally getting interesting. We all watched, and Katelyn got out the fancy camera and started recording. 

"Make sure you guys are ready to go, we might be following that truck," Katelyn said. We watched as the MacDonald brothers flipped open the cellar doors, and then James went down the stairs while John got the back doors of the box truck open. Then, people began filing out of the basement. We're not sure who the people were, none of them have been reported missing, but I suspect they will be soon, given what happened next. They walked calmly, single file out of the cellar and into the box truck, there were five people in total, all appeared to be adults, though one of them had Dwarfism so was smaller, but she still looked like an adult. 

"What the fuck?" Monty murmured. John closed the door of the box truck behind them, and then the two brothers got back into the cab.

"Let's go," Katelyn said, and we all grabbed our guns and binoculars and ran for the car. It's a black truck with tinted windows, and we kept the lights off. We sped down the road to catch up with the box truck, and then when we did, we hung way back from it. The truck got on the interstate, but didn't stay there long, turning off on a gravel road on the edge of the little town that leads to some farms. Katelyn stopped the truck and watched the box truck go down the road, you can see for miles on this road and she didn't want to stay too close behind. The box truck stopped on the edge of a big cornfield, so Katelyn cut the engine and we got out to follow them on foot. We stayed on the edges of the field, and they were none the wiser. We watched as they opened the back doors of the box truck and directed the people into the corn field. We followed, as carefully and quietly as we could. The people, John and James included, stopped at a little clearing, and waited.

We were in the large stalks surrounding the clearing, ready to move in if they attempted to harm the people, but no one was doing anything, they were just standing there. Then, out of the corn on the opposite side of the clearing, two... Beings came into view. The walked upright like humans, and were about the same size as adult human males, but they were *not* human. They each carried three large boxes in their arms. One of the beings opened it's mouth and a bizarre, inhuman noise came out, almost like TV static. This noise continued for a moment, and then stopped, and no one said anything for a moment. Then, a robotic sounding voice said: "Hello MacDonald siblings. Your order, pre-butchered this time, as requested. Ten of ours for five of yours." The MacDonald brothers nodded, and then John replied: "Yes, perfect. Here is the payment, five adults, alive as requested." Again, they all paused, and then a robotic sounding replication of the strange white noise sound emitted from somewhere. It wasn't hard to figure out that there was some kind of translation device in use. Katelyn signaled for us to wait, don't do anything yet. One of the beings approached the woman with Dwarfism and held it's hand(?) over her head.

"Child?" It asked, the translation coming through the same as before. The MacDonald brothers exchanged a glance and smirked.

"No," James said. "She's an adult. She has a genetic condition, very rare, very special." The two things seemed excited about this and spoke back and forth in their white noise language, but this time, no translation came, and John and James didn't seem to care. We gaped at the grim scene, but we still did nothing, because none of the people were doing anything either.

The people who were apparently the payment to these *things* could hear this whole conversation, and they did not react, they didn't seem to care. And then the beings and the five people just walked off into the cornfield and disappeared, they just went with them without a second thought. John and James turned back then too and hurried back to their truck with the boxes, and that's when Katelyn, who had gotten the whole thing on video, signaled for us to go after the people. We rushed in and out of the corn, looking for the people and the other beings, but we found nothing. There was no plausible way they could have gone far, or been able to hide from all of us, but they had vanished, as if into thin air.

Nothing much notable happened. John and James went back to the cafe and put the boxes in the cellar, then locked it up and put the fake bushes back on top of it, and then went home to their apartment. We've of course searched their apartment since we've been here too, and found nothing notable, they are masters of covering their tracks. Everything they're doing, and everything they know, is in that cellar, we are sure of it now. But we have to move carefully, otherwise they might flee, or worse, kill themselves and die with this horrifically important information. Plus, if they have a way of contacting those things, that could be catastrophic for us too, we have no idea what they are or what they're capable of. 

So that's where we are now. Like I said, this is all of course supposed to be strictly confidential, but I've never seen anything like this. People think that when you work for government agencies, you see things like this all the time, like there's all kinds of aliens and black magic all around us and we just know about it and everybody keeps it a secret, but that's not true. There are some government secrets, sure, but nothing like this, none of us, Katelyn included, have ever seen *anything* like this. So I shouldn't be telling you. But who's to say we'll even be here much longer anyway? They can't punish me if I'm dead, if those things get me, us. We are continuing the investigation, of course, so I'll update if we learn more, but after last night I needed there to be a public record of this, even if it's kind of hidden on the internet. It's here, and someone will see it, someone can find it if anything crazy happens. I hope it doesn't. I hope we find out that we were all drugged last night or something and hallucinated the whole thing, and that the stupid delicious meat is just some new kind of Impossible Burger or some shit. But I don't think so. 

I'll update whoever is reading this soon, I hope.
