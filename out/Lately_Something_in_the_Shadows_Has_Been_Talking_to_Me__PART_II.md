Uncle Kent. A new piece of the puzzle I never knew existed. At the local library, I dug through yellowing phone books until I found a Kent [redacted]. After several attempts, someone picked up. But instead of a greeting, I got silence. Dead air and static.

"Hello?" My voice sounded so small in the quiet. "Uncle... Kent?"

I was about to hang up, cursing myself for chasing ghosts, when something changed. Breathing. Soft, but definitely there.

"Who is this?" The voice was sandpaper-rough. "I don't got no nephew."

"I'm Shawn. Diane's son. Your sister's kid."

"My sister," he said, each word sharp as broken glass, "was murdered. Her son vanished. I don't take kindly to cruel jokes."

"They found me. Dad never told you, but they found me. I'm Shawn."

"Now I know you're lying." His voice turned to ice. "That wasn't her boy's name."

"Please!" Desperation made my voice crack. "I need your help. It's about Mom."

The line went so quiet I thought he'd hung up. Then, rapid-fire, he rattled off an address and the line went dead. My hands shook as I scribbled down the numbers, wondering what I'd just set in motion.

His cabin squatted in the depths of the woods. The drive there felt longer than usual, shadows from the trees creating strange patterns across my windshield. When I finally reached his door, the sound of multiple locks disengaging echoed like gunshots in the quiet forest. A single bloodshot eye appeared in the crack, Kent's eye. Then the door swung wide.

"You’re Shawn?"

"Yeah, that's me."

He retreated into his house, leaving the door open in silent invitation. I stepped into what looked like a museum of nightmares. Specimens decorated every surface, a yellowed human brain floating in cloudy formaldehyde, animal bones dangling from the ceiling like macabre wind chimes. The bones swayed slightly, though there was no breeze.

“Neat decorations.”

Kent's smile was brief and hollow as he settled into his ancient leather chair, gesturing for me to take the couch. "Yeah, I'm always finding new trinkets and stuff. Lately coyotes keep tryna' attack the chickens, so now their bones decorate my house. But hey, what’d you come to see me about imposter?”

The words stuck in my throat like tar. How do you tell someone you think the darkness itself is hunting you? "It's complicated. I'm honestly not really sure. I don't even know how to-" My hands scrubbed across my face, as if I could wipe away the fear. Finally, it all spilled out – the doors, the missing objects, the voice that wasn't a voice.

Kent listened with unsettling intensity, his fingers twitching against the armrests. When I finished, the silence stretched like a rubber band about to snap.

"There's a couple different myths and tales where creatures control shadows," he finally said, his voice taking on a professor's tone. "Daevas – shadow demons that serve as death's instruments. Tariaksuq – half-human, half-moose beings that melt into darkness when observed. Nalusa Falaya, Shayds, Jinns..." He leaned forward, eyes fever-bright. "But they don't just appear. They're invited. Manifested. Have you done anything to invite a malevolent force into your home?"

“No, it all started with the memory of my mom. I don’t know why, but it seems important.”

"Well Maxine was interested in occult things like me, but she didn’t like just scratching the surface of haunted items and possessions. No she looked further into other worldly things, tales that mortals really shouldn’t tamper with.”

"What do you mean other worldly things?”

“It sounds to me like she summoned some sort of devourer.” 

“Devourer?”

“That’s the only word that comes to mind. It’s not something that exists in religious books or cryptid tales. No this something entirely different, something that existed much before we did, before this planet even existed.”

“Kent please elaborate, this doesn’t make any sense.”

“Okay well for one devourer isn’t an official name, that’s my original tagline. But there’s this theory that me and your mom got really obsessed with for some time, her so more than me, for me it was just a cool idea. I think it was a lot more for her though… We stumbled across this study, that in between space and time, in this space of nothing, had to exist something. Whether it be energy or a creature that’s existed since before the beginning of time. It’s always there, always listening, watching. There’s supposedly a way to open a rift between our worlds, inviting it to the psychical realm.”

“So I invited the embodiment of nothing into my home?”

“I’m not sure, I honestly thought it was all crazy talk. Didn’t sound real. It’s possible though.”

"What do I do? If I move, it'll follow. It's probably here right now..." The moment the words left my mouth, the bone chimes above us began to sway and click against each other. No windows were open. No doors. No wind.

"It probably wasn't until you said that..." Kent's voice had dropped to a whisper.

"This isn't fucking funny! Whatever this 'thing' is, it's tormenting me. It won't leave me alone."

He sighed and began rummaging through various shelves and boxes. "Relax. Nothing has really happened yet. I understand it's scary, but that's why it's getting worse. You can't let it feed on your fear. Stay positive. Find some humor in it."

"You can't be serious. I have a demon or something in my house and your suggestion is to just be positive?"

"Shawn, I think it's feeding off your fear. You came to me for help. This is what I have to offer." He pressed several purple crystals into my palm, along with a gnarled bundle of sage. "Amethyst, to ward off negative thoughts. Sage, for protection and peace."

The bones continued their gentle dance above us, and somewhere in the shadows of Kent's cabin, I saw something flicker in the corner of my eye, at first I thought it was an illusion or I saw something wrong but no. 

It stretched eight feet into the air, a mockery of human form that made my stomach turn. I'd seen glimpses before, shadows and whispers, but never like this, never so horrifyingly real. Its limbs were like dead branches in winter, impossibly thin and ready to snap. The skin, if you could call it that, was a patchwork of void and midnight; areas of pure, polished blackness interrupted by sections where reality itself seemed to tear away. 

Where eyes should have been, two points of white had been carved into the darkness, like stars shining through holes punched in the fabric of night. I couldn't tell if it had ears or just empty sockets boring into its skull. And there it stood, raising one grotesque hand in greeting. Those fingers—Christ, those fingers. They sprouted from tiny palms like spider legs, stretching endlessly.

"There! Look!" I jabbed my finger toward the horror, but Kent saw nothing when he turned, just another dark corner in another dark room. He kept talking about positive energy and mental fortitude, about how I could push this thing out of my life if I just believed hard enough. But as I left his house that night, I watched my own shadow betray me. When light spilled from Kent's doorway, my shadow jerked away like a startled animal, slithering into the woods with a life all its own.

On the ride home, I let my mind wander where Kent would have warned me not to go. The thing was becoming physical now, was that the point of no return? Or was that thought itself the trigger, the belief that would cement its existence? Had it been hiding in my shadow all along, watching, waiting? The questions piled up like autumn leaves, and then a dangerous thought drifted through my mind: if it could manifest physically, maybe I could talk to it. Maybe I could finally get some answers.

But no, that was exactly the kind of thinking that would make things worse. I clung to Kent's advice instead: crystals, incense, positive thoughts. And somehow, remarkably, it worked. The darkness receded, and for a while, I was free. We also had created a rule, ‘Do NOT, under any circumstances, create a fear relating to this demon.’ It sounds complicated I guess but it just meant don’t think about it. Somehow, all of that worked.

We’re still not caught up to the present day but I’ll have to end this section here, sorry it’s so short but I promise I’ll keep updating, thank you to anyone who’s been following so far and if you have any advice, please, let me know, I don’t want to get ahead of myself but this story is far from over.
