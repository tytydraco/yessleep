Last night was not what I had hoped.

I drifted to sleep, blindly hoping that I would wake up having freed myself of the terror. Instead, I found myself back in the cemetery. Again, the dream took on a new form.

*I am there, staring at the swelling black curtains, only inches away from me. After hours of agonizing fear I feel the invisible hand wrap around my throat once again. It squeezes tightly—my breathing turns desperate. Through choked breaths, I plead to be let go but the hand does not concede. My throat collapses all over again, slowly and dutifully submitting to the hand’s strength. I cough violently, feeling as though I will hack up my organs if it goes on for a moment longer. As I beg with half-formed words, the darkness becomes more alive than ever before.*

*The buzzing sound grows tremendously loud; the noise, formerly indistinct, now takes shape. The vibrations of the hidden insects become a conduit for something much more human—humming the theme song of Little House on the Prairie. Nostalgia curdles in my stomach as the melody begins to drift subtly off-pitch, paired with an almost imperceptible increase of the tempo. Layered on top of the buzzing and humming, a voice forms from the dark, delivering jumbled phrases, as if a broken tape recorder is spitting out disjointed words—a cheap mimicry of human speech.*



*“For eternity… I don’t want—want—want—want to leave, I don’t. I DON’T. NO, NO, NO–For eternity? Come in here, buddy—I, what? What? Turn it back on, please. I need it back.”*



*The chopped-up mutterings come from a deep male voice—nearly indistinguishable from my father’s.*

*The disembodied voice switches tone; I hear a female voice, far more coherently replicated than the previous imitation.*



*“Hello? Joseph, can you please take a sho—oh! Sorry boys, I didn’t realize you were asleep—it’s early, but Angie misses you both, so get up…”*



*Again I hear the stammering, staticky voice of my father.*



*“She’s coming really soon—look up at the treeeeees, aren’t they soooooooooooooooooooo tall?”*



*Synapses fire in recognition of that phrase. Where do I remember that from? The wretched voice continues to distort his words, half-howling while maintaining a sinisterly coy delivery. The words come to me as though invisible lips were pressing to my ear.*



*“Look up… please—JJ, WHERE ARE YOUUUUUUUU? I WANT TO SEE YOUUUU? I’M UP IN MY BEDROOM, I MISSS— I… I miss you, I really do…”*



*I hear his voice much more clearly, just before it returns to incoherent babbling. I lose track of it, swallowed whole by the raging storm of creatures waiting to pounce.*

*I look up to the tops of the trees, swaying my broken neck. I stare in awe of their height until, suddenly, the curtains fall.*

*A swarm of insects rushes forth. The air is now unbelievably humid, far more capable of ushering forth the putrid stench of rot–it’s so thick that I can taste it, almost as dew drops on my tongue. I try to shut my mouth, but–for the first time–I feel a second hand. Settling two fingertips on my face, one on either side of my jaw, it squeezes tighter and tighter. Suddenly it rips downward, dislocating my jaw with a sound that seemed closer to a crack of thunder.*

*Now hung open, I could no longer fight the stench nor the insects. Feeling my throat fill with tiny, squirming bugs, I give in. After a near eternity, all sounds halt and I open my eyes to see a figure in front of me, slowly emerging as the insects disperse in every direction.*

*In complete silence, like an old movie scene, I see the bugs, now filling the sky–my head bobs back. In a momentary glimpse I am only able to notice a pair of eyes, wide open and entirely unmoving—the plastic eyes of a doll, loosely nestled within deep sockets. As my limp neck bounces back, I stare down at the dirty and battered arms of suit jacket bridging the gap between the figure and myself. With one final tilt of my head, I see white liquid, foaming from between a pair of chapped lips—contorted into a smile. Shadows obscure nearly every other detail, but the figure seems to be ready.*

*Before it can emerge I choke out one last cough, spewing a chunk of saliva-covered insects with it–entirely depleted of air, I black out.*

*--*

When I woke up I was relieved to feel that my throat was no more bruised than it had been the past few nights, though a horrendous, bitter taste overwhelmed it that I can only compare to arsenic nasal drip. I went to the sink to wash my mouth, then noticed that I could not hear the running water–the buzzing still rang in my ears. Gently, and without any inclination as to why I was doing it, I began to wrap my hands around my throat. The tender skin ached as I squeezed down; my subconscious unable to protect me from choking myself–I wasn’t even sure if I was the one moving my hands. The shower curtain in my childhood bathroom had been gone for years, replaced by a glass door, which was actually quite a relief to me as it got rid of that monster’s hiding spot.

Then, I hear the window slide up, cautiously I guide my eyes over, the only thing I still have control of.

The face of the man from my nightmare cartoonishly pops through the window; its expression made of gleering eyes and a half-witted smile. My hands grow tighter around my neck–my trachea threatens to crumble at any moment.

Involuntarily I turn, only slightly, towards the window. Now, rather than being able to see it in the mirror, it is several feet to my back left, only slightly accessible in the corner of my vision. I fail entirely as I strain to turn my head and gain clear sight of the watchful eyes.  The image in the corner of my view is nothing more than a blur, but I can make out its grotesque movement as I stand, entirely still and suffocating to death. These thoughts feel relatively unimportant, though, as I see the creature slide down, through the window and out of sight. I can hear its suit buttons clatter against the floor tiles, growing closer.

After so many run-ins with these impossible situations, I was capable of deciphering dreams from reality; unfortunately, I knew I was awake. Despite my every wish, I knew what was coming and prayed that my lack of genuine rest had sent me into a hallucination.

If I am able to move, my body would collapse in reaction to the next feeling; my back, muscles–tight in anticipation of the being behind me–become immediately flaccid as I felt a wet, scratchy face press timidly against my lower back. Patiently, it slides up my spine, careful not to come any closer than necessary, only letting the prickly hairs deliver a fluid onto my back–I’m forced to imagine it was pouring from between gritted teeth and an unbearable smile. When it reaches the top of my spine my tears begin to pour; its crusted lips brush against the nape of my neck, scratching as they find their way up to my ear. Upon arrival, the figure holds its mouth at such a distance so that the flaky skin would only tickle my earlobes. The lips part like a dam opening the floodgates–ushering forward a humid breath that dampens my cheek and earlobe. The breath carries forth an equally unpleasant smell, one I have come to know quite well. Even through my collapsing throat it is enough to make me wretch. I hear a shaky whisper–its trembling was a consequence of stifling laughter;

*“Yooooooouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu…Don’t you get curious sometimes? Ever wonder how it felt for him?” Breathily, now, as if it were excited, “Try it, you know you want to…I’ve been trying to show you how good it feels. JJ, I think you’ll really, really like it…it was good enough for him to forget about you, wasn’t it? Rememberrrrrr, JJ. I’ll let you see my face if you–”*

The figure lets out several low, raspy, crackling coughs; immediately following this he begins to release a childlike giggle in my ear, the sound bubbles and screeches like an overflowing pot of boiling water as it grows more emphatic. The desperate, wheezing laughter begins to morph into the drone of millions of flies. They desperately pour from his throat, filling up the bathroom. As my vision becomes clouded, the bathroom shrinks into a few patches of light that will soon be filled by flies. As I hold onto the last bit of light my hands release slightly, now only barely aggravating my fuschia bruises. A wave of relief rushes over me, yet I remain unable to move my own body.

Presumably in reaction to my new-found freedom, the monster’s hands begin to shift towards my stomach. As if imitating a spider’s jumpy movement, the monster taps its fingers like legs, crawling up the sides of my stomach, through my armpits, up my neck and under my ears–and then it reaches my face. 

The fingers–with their horrid, unkempt nails and calloused skin–smell sickly-sweet. Rotten.

They linger against my cheeks for a moment before brushing away my tears. Comfortingly, the hands rustle my hair, then guided my head gently towards the mirror. I can only make out its hollowed, sunken doll eyes before I feel the hand begin to push the back of my head. 

With a slow but incredibly assertive force the hand pushes my head towards the mirror. My forehead reaches it first, the hand now pressing forward with the patient, damning strength of a hydraulic press. The flies are so densely packed by now that they cushion my forehead’s contact against the mirror, but my fleshy pillow of insect bodies is quickly pulverized under the pressure, leaving behind an impressive amount of bodily fluid to drip down my face. As it continues to push me onward, the hand grips so tightly it feels as though my brain is swelling far beyond the capacity of its shell.

I begin to shiver uncontrollably; the hand seems to suck the warmth from me. In the haze I started to feel the glass press into my skin, splintering under the pressure. Slowly, and with absolutely no hope to change the situation, I realize that this is where I will die. Cursed, likely from my birth, my hands have been bound to leave me defenseless against this monster–my legs have been forced to walk towards this inevitable fate. 

The moments before my head shatters through the mirror and my throat splits open against the glass are agonizing–the splintering of the glass worsens dramatically with each second. The hand takes as long as it can to draw out my demise.

Time drags as each crack in the glass finds its way into my skin, peeling apart my face and burrowing deeper. My eyes are next–splinters begin to scrape away at my eyelids, but the mirror is at its breaking point–I pray that I’ll be lucky enough to only suffer cuts on my eyelids before death. Instead, a number of broken shards slide from my brow, lubricated by my blood, and fall into the sockets. In an instant the barrier between the internals of my eye and the outside world is violated. It was a simple realization; a soft pop in each eye, and then the feeling of liquid rushing forth. 

When stabbed anywhere else one does not feel the absence of space–only the severe pain of the wound–but this is different. The searing pain seems to reach past my eyeballs, grinding against the bone of my eye sockets. Worse though, is the feeling of emptiness, maybe best compared to the acute awareness of the empty space left when a tooth falls out–one does not have to touch the area to realize there is a hole in their flesh, the feeling is constantly there. 



*And then, snap.*



My skull finds its way through the mirror–my neck is thrust into the shattered remains along the frame, almost entirely severed. It takes a moment for me to realize that I remain somehow, regrettably, alive. Upon having this realization I feel my hair yanked backwards. Then a familiar sensation arrives–my head flops sideways, as if only attached by a rubber band. Through the swarm of flies’ violent noise I hear its voice again, hissing:



*“I just want you to have what you need, why not let go? Are you that much of a fucking pussy? You know you want to, so grow a pair, you waste of cum. Let. the. Fuck. go.”*



Satisfied with its message, it disappeared, dropping me to the floor. My body became my own again and I, without hesitation, reached up to feel my eyes–they were still there, fully intact. At my side lay a shard of glass, draped in red. In the remains of the mirror–to my shock, it really was broken–I saw a skin-deep cut parallel to my hairline, with countless other gashes across my entire face. I grabbed the bloodied piece with my right hand, immediately flinching upon gripping it–carved into palm were cuts as well; perfectly, they matched the edges of the shard, a self-inflicted wound.

A million thoughts rushed through my head; more than anything, I was eager to dismiss this as another of my hallucinations, or rather, a psychotic break. I would have had every reason to do so–no matter how real they feel, I have proven myself incredibly capable of weaving dreams and reality so effectively that I could never really differentiate, but I was bothered by an entirely different revelation. Fighting from the deep recesses of my mind, the thought occurred; did *it* really have to kill me with its own hands? Has it ever even tried? It was clear to me that there was something more–the loss of a parent is a tragedy, but how could it lead to *this*? There were two possibilities; either I was truly, irrevocably insane, or the beast of my dreams was fully capable of controlling my body, and was using it to lead me to my death. The former would explain everything, only failing on a few minor accounts; primarily, the origin of my madness. As a child I was troubled, but I moved on. And, not to forget, those markings on my throat–how could bruises from hands so giant be self-inflicted? 

I had to find out what “it” was and how it ever came to be. I could not have imagined how terrible the answer would be, even though the answers were so clear all along.



*I denied it, I had to.*

\--

  
Before I even realized what I was doing I had begun driving to the cemetery, this would be my first time back since that day that has plagued my life. My legs moved themselves, walking me down the same path that I had so many years ago. My hand felt the tightening grip of my mother’s; I heard the echoes of my baby sister’s cries and laughter; I stared at the many aged gravestones, although far more were now softened–nothing more than markers for long-forgotten loved ones who selfishly left the world behind.

When I got to his plot, I didn’t even glance at his gravestone. Instead, I stared at that same coastal sky, obscured by what I had to believe were the exact same foreboding clouds. Maybe it was the fact that the scene was identical, but it was only now that I realized that exactly eighteen years had passed since the invisible hand began to beckon me into the gaps between the trees. In that moment, though, the pines looked far smaller than I remembered. Their curtains had fallen revealing a truth so obvious that I began to laugh–the woods simply went on.



I thought; “Of course, I always knew that they were just woods, and that the trees were just trees. Somehow I had convinced myself that there had to be more, but there could never have been unbelievably dark curtains draped between the trees, or any unknown, desperate creatures, or a ridiculous invisible hand.”



And for a brief moment I felt truly comforted in that belief, but then I wondered if it was even possible for my subconscious to have led me back here, on the same exact day; or for the weather to perfectly match my memory. Maybe I suffered psychosomatic symptoms as a child, but what about the blood on my head, or the buzzing that continued to echo in my ears. As I looked back towards the trees, I questioned if I had simply imagined them as being smaller–at the very same instant, they began to stretch towards the sky in front of me, and the woods beyond slowly dissipated into tangled, moving shadows. The sound of buzzing grew oppressively loud, and my breath became shallow.



I cried out, “YOU’RE NOT REAL, YOU CAN’T BE. HE’S DEAD SO JUST LET ME GO–” but I stopped myself, overcome by the thought: 



*Why did my voice have to sound so much like his?*



I thought back to the time without dreams, to the many years of calm, uninterrupted sleep. I wished desperately to return to that time. Unwittingly, I had begun squeezing my eyes shut so tightly it hurt. 



When I opened them I saw my fathers face–the same sunken, hollow expression that I had seen buried in his shadowy room–now dimly lit in the blackness below the trees. His eyes flickered up towards me, fighting to stay open. 



He smiled. 



I smiled back.



I asked him why he left; his face softened, now a look of loving concern.



I heard his voice, gently assuring me,



*“You already know why, don’t you? I love you, JJ, for eternity. Now please come closer, I want to see your face. I need to hold you.”*



I begged him to leave the woods, to come to me.

Abruptly, the figure jolted forward. His spindly arms preceded him–I watched as the stretched appendages jumped between physical states like two reels of film projected on top of one another. In one, its arms slowly coiled up and unfurled–snapping the bones and grinding them against each other. In the other, his forearms jutted to unfeasible angles, far beyond the limits of the elbows. The sound of bones cracking filled the air, but they were not simply breaking–they were adjusting themselves. 

Before revealing anymore of itself, the entity decided on a form that was suitable; the splintered realities aligned as the arms snapped into place, now they hung limply at his sides, spindly and unwieldy. At the ends of its newly formed arms, fingers jittered back and forth on distended hands, entirely too large for even his body. His eyes, though… they were human. They were Dad’s.



*“JJ?”* his shadowy smile grew larger.



*“You look so handsome, just like your old man…”* his voice was cooing, warm. It carried the same raspy, calming inflection I knew so well–the voice I longed to hear again.



*“Please… let me get a closer look, you know my eyes were never the best without my specs. I just–I really missed you.”*



I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, “Dad? Dad, what is wrong with you? Are you okay? How are you even here?”



*“What, you think I wouldn’t say goodbye? To my boy, my baby? You–you think I didn’t know I’d be here? I never really left, I couldn’t leave you behind. My boy… just come here, how many times do I have to ask?”* Uttering the last few words, his smile dimmed.



“Daddy, I can’t–why can’t you just come closer? You aren’t acting right. I missed you, too–” my voice sounded so young, so frightened.



The first tear fell from my eye, stinging the cuts that covered my face. In the pain came memories of those impossible hands, the years of suffering they inflicted on me. For a brief, pathetic moment I believed him–in spite of everything, I wanted to. 



I drew back, and in exchange he took a step forward–seemingly aware of my new found distrust.

I began to make out his face more clearly: a bubbling, white liquid dripped down his chin from a familiar smile, softening his scruffy five o’clock shadow. 



*“Do you remember how much I love you? Why don’t you just–JJ are you listening? Can you hear me? Can you just, please, listen to me for one goddamn second?”*



I took another step back, and again, he came closer. My body reacted, my hands covering the bruised skin of my throat.



*“I am telling you. You–LISTEN–you need to come here, right now.”*



I revolted, his fingers were no longer twitching–they reached, curling and uncurling, as if feeling for something. As if waiting for a turn.



*“I am DONE playing this game with you. I have waited, and waited, and–YOU KEPT ME AROUND, WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?”* As he barked at me, his voice began to falter–it would briefly slip into a register far deeper than my father’s, crackling from his hoarse throat.



Whimpering, I released the few words I could muster, “Please, *please*–just leave me alone. For once in my life I want to sleep, I want to forget about you.”



*“Oh booooohooo, how tragic. Why don’t you take a single second to think back? Was Daddy so special? He left you, you goddamn pansy. He didn’t give a single fuck about you, not enough to even leave you with a few words, you’re nothing, a nobody to everybody, but especially to your father. You don’t know a single thing about yourself or him, you’re still hiding from reality. If accepting the truth is so awful, why not just end your life? Is it really my job to make you accept that putting a stop to your miserable, pathetic existence is the only good thing you could ever do?”* 



His eyes were glassy and unblinking, even as the insects from my dreams began pouring from behind his eyeballs in writhing droves. With them came the stench. It was thick, sour. Not rot–something far worse. 



My stomach knotted, my vision blurred. What the hell was this smell? Why won’t it leave me alone for once in my life, for a single moment? I hated it, I fucking despised every moment of my life and I wanted to die, so why wouldn’t I? It gave me plenty of chances, it practically did the job for me–I hated that it was right. Yet I wanted to live, so badly–I must have. If I was really ready, wouldn’t I have walked to the woods? My twisted stomach began to boil–how many years could I handle wasting like this? Didn’t I deserve happiness too, or at least a goodbye? 



“DON’T YOU THINK I WANT TO DIE?” The words escaped me before I was even aware they were there.



It paused. Then let out a soft chuckle.



*“Oh, sweetheart,”* it said wryly, “*That’s all I’ve ever wanted to hear*.”



Something deep inside me snapped. “WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE? IF I’M SO WORTHLESS, WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT EVEN I DON’T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOU?” 



I took a breath, “I… I don’t. I don’t need you. You’re not him and you could never be. Not even close.”



*“A little touchy, huh? I want you to do something for me, if you don't mind. Try and remember what made him sooooooo great. You don’t miss your father, you fucking crave him. It's sick, you disgusting, shriveled fuck. I can still see it in your eyes, everytime you think of him you get so excited.”* He grinned, clearly pleased to see me react*. "*He wouldn’t give a shit about a little-pricked fuck like you.”



Vomit began to fill my throat; what was this *thing*? Its desperate attempts to degrade me–to make me feel worthless–stung, only for the fact that they came from *his* mouth.



*“Oh I’m just teasing, you fairy–and don’t think I don’t hear you in there–convincing yourself that it doesn’t bother you. I have heard your every thought for the past eighteen years. Do you even realize how constantly you think about him? You’re a broken record–either you let the fucking guy go, or you give up–he’s not coming back, and certainly not for you. Eighteen years, JJ–eighteen pointless years obsessing about a guy who didn’t think twice about you. Do you know why he didn’t leave you that letter? It wasn’t because you were unlucky, or because he wasn’t capable of loving you–your little obsession grossed him out, it made him resent you. Constantly begging for his attention–really, what else could he have felt? What kind of ten year old needs to sleep with Daddy every night? That is who you are, and who you will always be.”*



I stood, paralyzed, unable to distinguish between my feelings and that thing’s. I had known for a long time that the only real thing Dad left with me was a hollow heart, his parting gift. It really would have made me happier to leave the world behind, to fly away.



*“I–I can’t fucking stand it anymore and I know you can’t either–JJ, I SEE WHAT GOES ON IN THERE. EVERY FEAR. EVERY INSECURITY. THEY ARE ACKNOWLEDGMENTS OF THE TRUTH, SO STOP HIDING–FUCK–JUST FUCKING END IT BEFORE I–WHAT IS WROOOOONG WITH YOU?”* his voice no longer wavered; it had totally abandoned its imitation. It didn’t crackle–it screeched, desperately. Voices layered on top of voices, echoing and changing and crying:



*“YOU–WE–Heyyyy bud, when did you come in? WHY ARE YOuu–DON’T YOU SMELLL IT, YOU GREEDY FUCK? THAT’S ALL THAT’S LEFT OF GOOOOOOOOD OLDDD DADDDYYYY–SHUT THE FUCK UP, YOU, YOU–”*



The voices collapsed into one–for a fleeting moment, I heard my mother,



*“It’s fine if you want to stay here, my love–”*



And then, its face lurched towards me, its neck stretching far across the graveyard. I came face to face with the monster. Its was contorted with anger;



*“Do NOT think you can get away. You are a useless, self-obsessed, copycat who’s ‘Daddy’ hated him–that’s why he left, JJ, because he couldn’t stand you. Do your family a favor, make up for their loss by fucking. killing. yourself.”*



I couldn’t hear another word. Bearing witness to this horrific figure in full for the first time, the memory of the smell began to pester at me. I pushed away these thoughts as quickly as they came, but they were unrelenting. 



*When did I smell it for the first time?*



I saw *it* more clearly; beneath his disturbing facade was an unmistakable expression, a memory locked in the most unreachable part of my mind.



*Why did I have to recognize his face so clearly, so many years later?*



No–the memory may have been suppressed, but it was not locked. I could never truly hold it at bay; the imagery proliferated in my subconscious at every turn. Refusing to accept the nature of what happened back then, I disguised it in every possible way, desperate for any reality that denied my own.



“Wow, you think you figured it out, don’t you? Little JJ finally stopped living in denial–I’m so glad. Maybe this will finally push you over the edge… I’ll see you soon, freak.”



I had no choice, not anymore. I remembered now.

\--

Eighteen years ago, in early spring, my mother brought my baby sister to our aunt’s house for a night. After I refused to go along, my mother went to talk to my Dad, but standing at the bottom of the stairs, I heard sigh deeply and calmly ask him something to no response. When she came back, eyes now watery, she patiently said;



“It's fine if you want to stay here, my love, but please, if you need anything go next door, they have Auntie’s number. If I get a call I’ll come right home to–”



“Why wouldn’t I just go to Dad?” I asked, interjecting.



“JJ, your father needs more sleep than other people, let him rest for now, okay? I’ll be back soon.”



I told her I wouldn’t need anything, and they left.



It didn’t take long for me to need something, though, maybe just a few hours. What I needed was something that neither my Mom or neighbors could ever give me; I needed Dad.



I knocked on the bedroom door.



“Dad… you promised me we could watch a scary movie next time it was just us two. Wake up,” I slammed open the door, giggling while I shouted, “WAKE UP! IT'S TOO EARLY FOR SLEEP!”

And then I smelled the stench, one that has been stuck on the inside of my nose for my entire life. My brain could never truly forget it, although it tried so hard to. For eighteen years I convinced myself that this was the smell he *always* took up in his episodes, though I knew, I had to have known, somewhere deep down that I was lying to myself.

\--



When I was ten and a half years old, I found him.



I denied it then, tucked away from the world in the quiet of his room.



I understand it, finally.



He did not just pass away, he *left* us.



And I found him, although it took many years to realize what I had seen.

\--

There he was. The old wood-paneled television that my mother gifted him for their anniversary flickered against the dark. Its static made a piercing, ceaseless hum, filling the room. I called out, asking once, twice, “Dad, how can you sleep with that noise?” but he didn’t hear me.



The faint light of the television reached across the room, brushing his face with a shifting, electric glow. In the shadows, his cheeks looked hollow and his eyes sunken.



But they were open. His lips showed a gentle, melancholic smile.



I figured the light from outside would do the trick, so I set out to open the curtains. For some reason, though, I couldn’t do it. I hadn’t realized, but my hands were shaking and I was weeping, unable to hear my own whimpers over the television’s buzzing, now growing impossibly loud in my ears.



The moments that followed are the most vivid in my memories now. I took a step back, and then another. I thought about “Pa” from Little House on the Prairie, Dad’s favorite character. We spent much of our time watching the show, pretending to be a part of the cast. I knew that from my acting experience that Pa wouldn’t be nearly as scared as I was. I thought about the smile on Dad’s face whenever I pretended to be Pa, and I lurched forward to open the curtains.



The light rushed into the room, but so did the flies who found their way in through a crack in the window, lured by the odor. I began to sob uncontrollably. Unable to turn around–to bear seeing something that I, at least subconsciously, knew was behind me–I kept on waiting to hear Dad’s voice. I reached my hand out slowly, turning the television off. Losing track of time, the same phrases ran through my head at an unbelievable pace; my subconscious was desperate to rationalize the situation and I had no intention of stopping it. Over and over, all I could think was: “He must be really sick to sleep like this.” Despite my false confidence, I couldn’t muster the bravery to turn around.



I’m not sure how much time passed, but eventually I heard him wake up. 



I snapped my head around, thinking that his unintelligible noise meant we could go to the movies, or at least eat dinner. He coughed, or rather, *choked*. Despite the awful noise he emitted, his wet, hacking cough didn’t seem to be that bad–his body was almost entirely unflinching. And then he coughed again, this time I noticed another oddity; his eyes weren’t closing as he coughed. I saw something at the corner of his lips. Another moment passed, and a final cough. With it came a rush of white substance; his mouth was foaming up with some liquid that I found revolting and confusing.



Quickly I jumped up next to him, wailing, I begged:



“Daddy, please wake up! Look, you got sick on yourself. Please wake up–please. I-I can help you clean up.”



Using my sleeve I got the foaming liquid off his mouth and cheeks. I distinctly remember being so fearful when it came out of him, yet when I went to wipe it up there was no hesitation. In fact, I was suddenly calm. My eyes began to well up again but this time the tears fell upon a gentle, hesitant smile. It felt nice to help him, I guess.



The light faded as I laid next to him, going back and forth between begging him to wake up through sobs and silently, wordlessly, asking him to hold me. This went on for hours, until my throat became hoarse and my body was exhausted. I tucked my back against his scrawny chest, sinking into the bed with him. The moment I pulled his arm around me my body decided it couldn’t sustain me for another moment–for the last time, I fell asleep in Dad’s embrace. 



When I woke up, I first noticed the sun peaking out over the treetops. I realized how warm it felt. Almost immediately afterwards, my notice of Dad’s icy skin interrupted any pleasant delusions. Sitting up, I looked over to his bedside table, and saw several bottles of sleeping pills. Next to them sat an envelope. Inscribed, in his favorite pen, were the words;

*To JJ, my pride, my future, and my best friend. I love you, and I will for eternity. If I ever go, please stay here.*

*--*

When I was ten and a half years old, my father laid in his bed, took as many pills as he could swallow, and passed away.



When my mother found us wrapped up in bed it actually took her a moment to realize. She had been, understandably, put off by the smell but then again, some things are just too horrific to accept–I know that more than anyone. Her brain, even just for that brief moment, had to deny the implication of me, curled up in his arms; especially to avoid confronting the fact that it wouldn’t have happened if she were home. Unknowingly, her eyes avoided looking into the face of my father; in fact, they were entirely closed as she smiled at what appeared to be an affectionate embrace.

\--

Eighteen years later, I stood under a cloudy sky in a cemetery in Maine–hallucinating visions of the last night I spent with him; the creature that he became. Shifting my vision towards his grave, I think I can now see what he meant in his poem to Angie. My fingers ran across the aging words:

*“In our youth we fly…*

*I have come to much prefer the nest.”*

Dad was not able to live a normal life, not as a child or a young man, not even when his heart had been “filled.” Despite preferring the nest, the bird flew into the sun. Here, hand resting upon this lovely stone, I wondered how good the flight must have felt.

The fall breeze traversed the folds of my pajamas, forcing itself against my most vulnerable points.  In response, my brain began to conjure the words of my favorite work in Dad’s collection of poetry. It was untitled and had been written urgently on an unfolded pregnancy test package with an expiration date in the year of my birth. His penmanship was different, too–there was a suggestion of excitement in the bouncy lettering;

*She twirled the fresh curls in her finger,* 

*flashing a toothy grin as the waitress circled with a fresh pot of bitter “Colombian” coffee.*



*Her smile lingered.*

*On each tooth I saw a different reality,*

*One with magical spells,* 

*or one where humans were roughly 15 feet tall…*

*In one we were Adam and Eve,*

*and in another there was only one difference; I had an extra toe.*

*Some had alien invasions, dictatorships, or whatever else I could imagine.*



*Only one thing was always there; all of our potential worlds revealed an image of two Moons above our heads.*

*I would stretch my neck to stare up at them,*

*whirling and circling each other in the most beautiful dance.*

*Each basking in the other’s glow.*



*I looked up into her eyes and saw the same beautiful Moons.*

*I asked her;*

*“Do you know how the Moon came to be?”*



*I never got an answer, she just kept on smiling*

  


The tragedy of the Moon, a broken fragment of the Earth that it longs to rejoin, began to overwhelm my thoughts as I suffered through the wind’s penetrating, bitter gnawing against my skin. I wondered how he wrote so much of my life story, our life story, in just a few lines of a poem. A life spent floating in his orbit had prevented me from ever becoming more than a memento of his legacy–a body made from a chunk of his own, unable to ever even replicate his image. It has come time to break my orbit, for our waltz to change.

Right now, I bet his wings are begging to rest as he heads into the Sun. His whole life he searched for its warmth, always too far to reach.

While he travels, hoping only to be embraced by that celestial body, I will still be waiting here, remembering his fading heat as I fell asleep on our last night together. I hope you find it, Dad. Maybe, for the first time, the warmth that escaped from your skin your whole life will be replenished.

Uncertain what to do now, I laid down next to his grave, hoping that at the very least my body heat would reach him through the dirt. As the wind raged, harder and harder, I somehow felt entirely comfortable. I began to feel as if my body was sinking into the ground, and as my eyes gently shut, I began to dream.



*I open my eyes to see the Earth, plunged in a dark void–the unending blackness only interrupted by countless stars in the backdrop. My hands raise involuntarily, reaching out in front of me. I examine them as they desperately grasp towards the Earth.* 



*These hands are not mine, I think, they’re far too small. Inquisitively, I look at the body I’m attached to–it’s no different.* 



*A smile grows across my face as I realize I’m wearing my favorite t-shirt, a gift from my Dad. In bold font, the words “Redwood National Park” hover above a print of the tallest trees in the world. He bought it for me on a trip we took together shortly after my parents found out they were having another child. My eyes take in the ground below; somehow I’m on the Moon.*



*I blink–when I open my eyes I’m on the Earth, now looking back at where I just stood. My hands begin to wave; first at the Moon, and then at a lonesome bird overhead.*



My hand continued to wave until I felt someone grab my shoulder, shaking me. Looking back, I saw my mother, crying. I could feel the nurturing heat from the Sun soaking into my skin; softly, my eyes opened as I left behind my first new dream since childhood.



“Hi..” I muttered, still dazed. I realized I was crying.



“I saw what happened in the bathroom… come home, please.”



I cast a glance toward the tree line. Through my teary eyes, I couldn’t tell if the figure that still stood there was real.



I once again see her facial expressions from that first visit to the cemetery–the rage, the hurt, the loneliness–and I now remember the look she gave me when I read the quote in my father’s voice–she was terrified. I wondered if she had ever planned to give me that letter, only to decide against it when she realized why my likeness to my father scared him so much. Unfortunately for all of us, I found Angie’s first and kept it hidden, driving myself into the belief that I was the only one forgotten.



There is no doubt in my mind that the words I have been searching for are sealed inside that dusty envelope. Maybe I’ll read it one day–I’m sure Mom will give it to me if I ask–but today, I think my memories are enough to tell me all that I need.

\--

Dad… I forgive you, so please, go to that warmth that you need. Keep searching higher and higher, far away from here. You deserve to find whatever it was that was taken from you, fill your heart up as much as you can.



Part of me will always be here, sealed away– a child, terrified by the pines, hearing the static of your old television, falling asleep in your limp arms. Today, as I stood six feet above you but millions of miles away, I realized I don’t mind that so much. Honestly, I just wish you could see the sun emerging from the clouds above Mom and me. As it does, the light cascades between the trees, revealing the deep, unexplored woods–they have always been there waiting for me. Those dark, impenetrable curtains are finally wide open, and the Sun is shining so brightly. I can still see the imitation of you, its twisted face barely peeking at me from behind a tree. I wonder how long it will be before it beckons me back into the dark.
