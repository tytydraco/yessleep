The scream tore through the forest, raw and jagged, cutting through the suffocating stillness like a knife. It wasn’t just fear—it was something primal, desperate, the kind of sound that left a mark on your soul.

“Sarah!” Josh yelled, his voice cracking as he ran toward the sound. The rest of us stood frozen, the trees pressing in around us like a living wall.

I wanted to call out, to tell him to stop, but my throat felt locked, the words trapped behind a rising tide of panic. My eyes darted toward Nate, hoping for some kind of plan, but he was pale and trembling, his hand clutching the knife he’d pulled from his pack.

Then we heard it again.

“Help me…”

The voice was faint, fractured, but unmistakably Sarah’s. It came from somewhere deep in the forest, where the shadows swallowed everything. But something was wrong.

“That’s not her,” Nate whispered, his voice barely audible.

Josh didn’t stop. He disappeared into the dark, the underbrush snapping and crunching in his wake.

I took a step forward, every instinct screaming at me to stay put. “Josh, wait!”

The forest didn’t answer, but something else did. A low, guttural growl rumbled through the trees, followed by a wet, tearing sound that made my stomach turn.

And then silence.

A heavy, suffocating silence that wrapped around us like a shroud.

Three hours earlier, we hadn’t even known the side trail existed.

We were laughing, carefree, our biggest concern being whether we’d brought enough water for the loop. The forest felt alive in the way that forests do—birds chirping, leaves rustling, sunlight filtering through the canopy in golden streams.

Josh spotted the trail first. It wasn’t really a trail, more like a faint gap between the trees, the undergrowth trampled just enough to suggest that someone—or something—had passed through recently.

“Shortcut,” he said, grinning as he gestured toward it. “This’ll get us back to the car faster.”

I hesitated, staring into the shadowy thicket. Something about it felt wrong, though I couldn’t explain why. The others didn’t share my unease.

“C’mon,” Sarah said, brushing past me with her phone in hand, already snapping pictures of the moss-covered trees. “What’s the worst that could happen?”

Looking back, I wish I’d stopped them. I wish I’d turned around and taken the main trail back to safety. But instead, I followed, my gut twisting as we stepped into the unknown.

It didn’t take long for the forest to change.

“It’ll shave an hour off the loop,” Josh said, peering into the shadowy thicket. “Trust me.”

“We’re not supposed to leave the main trail,” I countered, though my voice lacked conviction. Something about the path felt… wrong. It wasn’t overgrown, exactly, but it didn’t look like anyone had used it in a while either.

By the time I decided to protest, the others were already moving. Even quiet Nate, who usually sided with me, gave me a shrug and trudged after them. I hesitated, standing there alone, staring into the trees. There was an odd stillness to them, a silence that felt too thick for a forest in late afternoon. But the others were laughing, calling for me, and I didn’t want to be the killjoy.

The first twenty minutes were uneventful, if slightly eerie. The trees grew denser as we walked, the air cooler. Josh kept trying to convince us we were making good time, though my watch disagreed.

“See? Piece of cake,” he said, pointing to a clearing up ahead. “We’re probably almost—”

He stopped mid-sentence. I followed his gaze, frowning. The clearing wasn’t a clearing at all—it was a strange depression in the ground, as if something heavy had lain there recently. The grass was flattened in concentric rings, with jagged claw-like tears in the earth.

“Bear, maybe?” Nate suggested, but his voice was too light, like he didn’t believe it.

Josh laughed nervously. “Yeah, probably just a bear.”

We skirted the edge of the depression, none of us willing to step closer. A few minutes later, the forest began to feel… wrong. I couldn’t put my finger on it at first. The trees all looked the same, their trunks oddly uniform, and the trail—if you could still call it that—seemed to shift subtly underfoot.

And then the smell hit us.

It was faint at first, a metallic tang that made my stomach churn. Sarah gagged. “Ugh, what is that?”

The smell grew stronger as we pressed on, even though the others pretended not to notice. I could feel it clawing at the back of my throat, thick and coppery, like rust and rotting meat.

That’s when I heard it: a sharp crack, like a branch snapping somewhere to our left.

“Did you hear that?” I whispered. My voice sounded too loud in the stillness.

Josh shook his head. “It’s probably just an animal.”

But Sarah grabbed my arm, her fingers digging in. “No, that didn’t sound right,” she hissed. Her face was pale, her eyes wide.

We froze, listening. The silence was oppressive now, pressing in on all sides. Then came another sound, closer this time—a low, guttural noise that sent shivers racing down my spine. It wasn’t a growl. It wasn’t anything I could recognize.

“Let’s keep moving,” Nate said, his voice trembling.

We picked up the pace, but the sounds didn’t stop. Branches rustled, twigs snapped. Whatever was out there, it was following us.

I glanced over my shoulder, my heart hammering. For a split second, I thought I saw movement—something tall and thin weaving between the trees. But when I blinked, it was gone.

“Josh,” I said, my voice cracking. “Are we even going the right way?”

“I think so,” he muttered, but the confidence was gone.

We stumbled into another clearing, this one worse than the first. The ground was littered with bones—animal, I told myself, though some looked worryingly large. In the center of the clearing was something else: a tattered piece of fabric, stained dark and half-buried in the dirt.

Sarah screamed.

Before I could stop her, she bolted back into the trees.

“Wait!” I shouted, but she was already gone.

The three of us stood there, paralyzed, until we heard her scream again—this time farther away, muffled, and abruptly cut off.

And then… we heard it.

A voice.

It came from the trees, soft and plaintive. “Help… please… I’m hurt…”

It sounded like Sarah.

But it wasn’t.

Josh didn’t wait. He took off after the voice, crashing through the underbrush like a wild animal.

“Josh, stop!” I yelled, but he didn’t even glance back. Nate and I hesitated for a moment, staring at each other with wide eyes, before the silence swallowed us whole again. We couldn’t just leave him—or Sarah. My legs moved before my brain caught up, dragging me forward into the dense, suffocating forest.

Nate followed close behind, his breath coming in shallow gasps. “That didn’t sound right,” he whispered as we ran, his words tumbling out like they were choking him. “That wasn’t her.”

I didn’t want to admit he might be right.

The voice came again, weaker now, quivering. “Please… help me.”

It sounded exactly like Sarah, but there was something off about it, like a recording played on a warped tape. The pitch wavered just slightly, too high, too low, stretching and compressing in ways a human voice shouldn’t.

Josh’s frantic calls overlapped with it. “Sarah! Where are you? Keep talking, we’re coming!”

He was ahead of us, his figure barely visible through the thick trees, moving faster than seemed possible. The forest felt wrong, even more so now, as if the trees were leaning in closer, their skeletal branches reaching for us. The trail we’d been on was gone, replaced by uneven ground littered with rocks and gnarled roots that caught at our feet.

Then we saw him.

Josh was standing still in a small clearing, his back to us. The air was different here—heavier, suffocating. A faint mist clung to the ground, curling around his legs like pale, searching fingers.

“Josh?” I called, my voice trembling. He didn’t move.

Nate grabbed my arm, his grip iron-tight. “Don’t,” he whispered.

“Josh!” I called again, louder this time. My voice cracked, echoing unnaturally through the trees.

He turned, finally, and my stomach plummeted. His face was pale, almost gray, his eyes glassy and wide. His lips moved, but no sound came out at first. Then he whispered, “She’s here.”

I followed his gaze and froze.

At the edge of the clearing stood Sarah—or something that looked like her. Her clothes were torn, and her hair hung in matted strands over her face. But her posture was wrong, stiff and unnatural, like a puppet on strings. Her head twitched slightly to one side, too fast, and then again, snapping back with a wet, crunching sound.

“Sarah?” I took a step forward, though every instinct in my body screamed at me to run.

“Help me,” she said, her voice thin and broken. But her lips didn’t move.

Josh took a step toward her. “It’s okay, we’re here,” he said, his voice trembling.

“No!” Nate barked, pulling me back. “That’s not her. Look at her feet.”

I looked down and felt my blood run cold.

Her feet weren’t touching the ground.

Josh didn’t seem to notice—or didn’t care. He kept moving forward, drawn to her like a moth to a flame. “Josh, stop!” I shouted, but it was too late.

She moved suddenly, impossibly fast, closing the distance between them in a single, fluid motion. Her head snapped to the side again, and I caught a glimpse of something glinting in the dim light—teeth, sharp and jagged, far too large for her mouth.

Josh screamed.

It was a sound I’ll never forget, raw and primal, filled with a terror that didn’t belong in this world. He stumbled backward, clutching his arm, and we saw the blood—a dark, glistening stream that poured through his fingers.

“Run!” Nate yelled, grabbing my hand and yanking me back into the trees. Josh’s screams faded behind us, replaced by wet, tearing sounds that turned my stomach. I wanted to look back, but I couldn’t.

We ran blindly, tripping over roots and crashing through branches, the forest a blur around us. The air felt thicker with every step, each breath a struggle. The smell was back now, stronger than ever, clogging my throat and making my eyes water.

And then the voice came again.

“Don’t leave me…”

It wasn’t Sarah this time.

It was Josh.

The voice—that thing using Josh’s voice—was getting closer. It sounded wounded, pitiful, but still carrying that same warped edge as before. Nate and I didn’t slow down. We didn’t speak. I think we both knew instinctively that if we stopped, we wouldn’t start again.

The trees grew darker, more tightly packed, as if the forest itself were trying to funnel us somewhere. The uneven ground clawed at our feet, and Nate tripped, nearly taking me down with him. I hauled him up, both of us breathing hard, and we pressed on until the forest abruptly opened into another clearing.

It was wrong, all wrong.

The space was circular, too perfect to be natural, and the trees surrounding it leaned inward, their branches tangling overhead to form a grotesque canopy. The ground was bare dirt, scorched black in some places, and in the center stood a twisted wooden structure—a crude effigy of some kind. It looked vaguely human but grotesquely stretched, its limbs branching off unnaturally like antlers.

But that wasn’t the worst part.

The air here… it hummed. Not audibly, but in a way that resonated deep in my bones, a sickening vibration that made my teeth ache and my vision blur. I staggered back, grabbing Nate’s arm for balance.

“Do you feel that?” I whispered, though my voice sounded muffled, as if the clearing had swallowed the sound.

Nate nodded, his face pale, his eyes fixed on the effigy. “We need to go,” he said, his voice low and urgent. “Now.”

We turned to leave, but the forest behind us was gone.

Or rather, it had changed. The trees were no longer the tall, straight pines we’d been running through. These were older, gnarled things, their trunks impossibly thick and their branches twisted into unnatural shapes. The path we’d come from had disappeared, replaced by dense thickets that seemed to shift and writhe when I wasn’t looking directly at them.

Nate took a shaky step forward, but I grabbed his arm. “Wait,” I whispered.

That’s when I saw it.

Between the trees, just at the edge of the clearing, something was watching us. It was barely visible, a shadow darker than the surrounding darkness, but its eyes… its eyes burned like embers, glowing faintly in the dim light. They didn’t blink.

I squeezed Nate’s arm, my nails digging into his skin. “Do you see—”

“Yeah,” he cut me off, his voice trembling. “I see it.”

We both stood frozen, unable to move, as the thing shifted slightly, its shape becoming more defined. It was tall, impossibly tall, its limbs unnaturally long and angular. It didn’t move like a person—it flowed, its joints bending in ways that made my stomach churn.

The humming in the air grew louder, sharper, like it was coming from the creature itself. My vision blurred, and I felt a sudden, intense pressure in my head, like my skull was being squeezed. Nate let out a choked sound and stumbled back, clutching his temples.

The creature stepped closer, its movements slow and deliberate, and that’s when I noticed it. It was holding something.

A scrap of fabric, torn and bloodstained.

Sarah’s jacket.

I felt bile rise in my throat, but I couldn’t look away. The creature raised its free hand and pointed at us—long, spindly fingers that ended in claws—and the humming stopped. The silence was deafening, and then, from deep within the forest, we heard it: a low, guttural call, like a distorted imitation of a wolf’s howl.

“Run,” Nate whispered, his voice barely audible.

We bolted, diving into the twisted forest without any sense of direction. The air was thick and heavy, each breath a struggle, but we didn’t stop. The forest seemed alive, branches reaching for us, roots rising to trip us. The howls grew louder, echoing from all sides now, and I realized with dawning horror that they weren’t coming from just one creature.

There were more.

Every shadow seemed to move, every sound twisted into something unnatural. Nate grabbed my hand, pulling me forward as I stumbled over a root, and we burst through another thicket into an open space.

This time, it wasn’t a clearing. It was the edge of a ravine, a sheer drop into blackness that seemed to go on forever. We skidded to a stop, teetering dangerously close to the edge.

“Now what?” I gasped, looking frantically for another way out. But the forest was closing in behind us, the howls growing louder, closer.

Nate turned to me, his face pale but determined. “We fight it,” he said, pulling a hunting knife from his pack. I hadn’t even known he had it.

“Fight what?” I demanded, panic bubbling over. “We don’t even know what it is!”

He didn’t answer. His eyes were fixed on the forest, and that’s when I saw them—dozens of glowing eyes, moving through the trees, too many to count. The creatures were closing in, their distorted shapes weaving between the trunks like smoke.

And then, from somewhere deep inside me, something shifted. A strange clarity settled over me, cold and sharp. I picked up a heavy branch from the ground, my hands trembling but steady enough to hold it.

If this was the end, we weren’t going down without a fight.

Nate’s knuckles were white as he gripped the knife, his breath coming fast and shallow. I held the branch in front of me like it could actually do something against… whatever this was. The glowing eyes moved closer, their light reflecting off something slick and wet. The creatures—if you could even call them that—emerged from the shadows, revealing themselves in the dim, unnatural glow of the ravine’s edge.

They weren’t uniform in shape. Some were tall and impossibly thin, their elongated limbs ending in razor-sharp claws. Others were smaller, hunched, their backs bristling with spines that jutted out at grotesque angles. Their skin—or whatever passed for skin—was mottled and raw, as if it had been flayed and poorly stitched back together. Worst of all were their faces—or lack thereof. What should have been features were hollow indentations, smeared shadows, or pulsing masses of flesh.

The humming sound returned, louder than ever, vibrating through the ground and into my chest. It wasn’t just noise—it was pressure, burrowing into my skull and making my vision warp. My grip on the branch faltered, my arms trembling as if the sound was sapping my strength.

Nate took a step forward, raising the knife. His voice was a hoarse whisper. “Stay back.”

The nearest creature tilted its head, as if curious, then opened its mouth. There was no sound, but I could feel it, a palpable wave of dread washing over me. Its mouth was a yawning chasm of jagged teeth, shifting and rearranging themselves like something alive.

Another one moved forward, faster than I could follow, its spindly limbs scuttling like a spider’s. It lunged at Nate, and he swung the knife wildly, catching it across the torso. A thick, black ichor sprayed from the wound, hitting the ground with a hiss and filling the air with the stench of burning hair. The creature shrieked—an ear-piercing, unnatural sound that didn’t stop when it should have. The others responded, their guttural cries merging into a deafening cacophony.

“Run!” I shouted, grabbing Nate’s arm and pulling him back from the advancing swarm. But there was nowhere to run. Behind us was the sheer drop of the ravine, and the creatures were closing in on every side.

My mind raced, every instinct screaming at me to do something, but what could I do? The humming grew sharper, more invasive, until I thought my skull might crack under the pressure. And then, as if responding to some unseen signal, the creatures stopped.

Every one of them froze, their heads turning in unison toward the center of the clearing.

I followed their gaze, and my stomach dropped.

The ground beneath the effigy was shifting. The blackened earth cracked and bulged as something pushed its way to the surface. Long, spindly fingers—no, roots—broke through the soil, writhing like they were alive. The effigy itself began to twist and contort, its wooden limbs splintering as something massive and wrong forced its way out from within.

It wasn’t just one creature—it was all of them. Dozens of limbs and faces and bodies fused together in a writhing, pulsating mass that defied reason. Eyes blinked open along its surface, too many to count, each one staring directly at us. The air grew colder, the pressure more intense, as if the thing was sucking the life out of the forest itself.

The creatures around us began to kneel, their twisted forms bowing toward the abomination in reverence. I wanted to scream, to run, to do anything, but my legs were locked in place, my body paralyzed by the sheer wrongness of what I was seeing.

Nate grabbed my arm, his voice barely audible over the sound of the humming and the shifting earth. “We have to jump.”

“What?” I turned to him, my voice shaking. “Are you insane?”

He pointed to the ravine. “It’s either that, or… this.”

The thing in the clearing let out a deep, resonant growl that vibrated through my bones. One of its massive, root-like limbs reached toward us, stretching impossibly far.

I didn’t think. I couldn’t. I grabbed Nate’s hand, and together, we leapt into the darkness.

For a moment, there was nothing but the rush of air and the pounding of my heart. Then we hit water—icy, bone-chilling water that knocked the breath from my lungs. The current was strong, dragging us along like ragdolls. I fought to the surface, gasping for air, and caught a glimpse of Nate ahead of me, struggling to keep his head above the water.

The ravine walls were high, the trees above a jagged silhouette against the faint light of the moon. The creatures didn’t follow. Whatever horror we’d left behind seemed bound to the forest, unwilling—or unable—to chase us into the depths.

We floated for what felt like hours before the current slowed, depositing us onto a rocky shore. I crawled onto the slick stones, coughing and shivering, and collapsed beside Nate. For a long time, neither of us spoke.

Finally, he broke the silence. “What the hell was that?”

I shook my head, unable to answer. The memory of the thing in the clearing—the way it moved, the way it looked at us—was burned into my mind. But worse than that was the feeling, the certainty, that it wasn’t over.

We’d escaped the forest, but something told me we hadn’t left it behind.

Not entirely.
