[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oi2nx2/my_father_died_he_may_not_have_been_who_i_thought)

The weeks following my father's death were hard. For the first couple of days, I tried to go to work and to talk to the few friends that Adam and I had from college, but as time passed, I slowly succumbed to the lethargic grief that I had managed to keep from giving into for that first week or so.

The crushing depression I fell into wasn't even due to my father's passing, not in full at least, which made me feel even worse, but because of what had happened after that. I still had no idea why all of that with the ravens had happened, and after a week or so I was no closer to finding out. I needed answers to all of it; why had ravens suddenly decided I was the greatest enemy their species had ever known? What was that book and why had a storm suddenly formed right above my head when I'd touched it, and why did it beat in time with my heart? Why had my father had it? Why had he never told me? What had actually killed him? I didn't believe the medical examiner's conclusion of blunt force trauma from a traffic accident, not for a second so how had my old man actually died? So many questions swirled around my head that I found it difficult to sleep at night.

I eventually stopped going to work, around the time that the depression got too heavy to bear when out in public. That was around the same time that the ravens started harassing me again. I didn't even have to have the book on me, which is what I had initially assumed was the cause of that particular phenomenon, for the ravens to attack on sight. After showing up to work a few times with zero capacity for human emotion and bloody, torn clothes from being attacked by my avian arch-enemies, I stopped leaving the house entirely.

That was when I started reading the book, late at night the same day I'd decided to stop leaving the house, and as soon as I did, I felt stupid for not doing so earlier. The contents of that book have told me more than I had ever thought possible to learn, and at the same time have left me wondering how much I really know even now, having read through the leather-bound tome multiple times over and committed certain passages to memory. It surely taught me how little I ever really knew about my father, about the kind of man he was, if he was even a man at all by the time he'd finally died.

I will share with you the opening pages of the book that referred to itself as the Hanged Man's grimoire. I have done some shortening for brevity's sake, but I am not, to my knowledge, leaving out any of the important details that helped me realise just what I had gotten myself involved in when inheriting the tome.

*So long ago that none now recall,*

*there once was a boy named Raven Eyes.*

*His eyes, windows to the soul, were dark;*

*like raven's feathers, they killed the light.*

*They thought him a curse, soulless, evil,*

*so they banished him to die alone.*

*For near-on a decade, those folks thrived.*

*They thought they were free of Raven Eyes.*

*But when that boy, now grown, returned,*

*he brought with him his blazing hatred.*

*Hate for all that had cursed his name,*

*hate for all that had left him to die,*

*hate for all that smiled when he could not.*

*Raven Eyes displayed his holy book,*

*the bible for a foreigner's god;*

*written within were arcane secrets*

*which spoke of things without names or souls.*

*The One-Eyed Sage was one such thing,*

*a figure of power so immense*

*that mere comprehension of his truth*

*drove mortal men to utter madness.*

*Raven Eyes used the magic bestowed*

*upon him as this strange god's preacher*

*to lash out at the ones who hurt him*

*when he had been but a boy of nine.*

*He burned his former home to cinders,*

*sparing none but a single woman*

*who became the wife of Raven Eyes*

*when her unwilling husband wielded*

*magic to enthrall and enslave her.*

*As years passed by, Raven Eyes' new bride*

*bore him nine sons in three sets of three.*

*Raven Eyes taught his spawn, all nine boys,*

*to share his worship of nameless things,*

*and for this act of cultivation,*

*the One-Eyed Sage thanked Raven Eyes*

*with knowledge too foul for mortal minds.*

*That very night, Raven Eyes performed*

*a ritual to grant him power;*

*from each of his spawn he took an eye*

*and consumed the donations of flesh.*

*When this was done, the boys were hanged*

*upon the branches of the Great Tree,*

*which their father's victims had worshipped.*

*Raven Eyes made his wife do for him*

*what he had done for their nine children*

*and hang him upon the tallest branch*

*of the Great Tree so that his black soul*

*could ascend to godhood with his sons*

*by his side as his angelic kin.*

*At the moment of Raven Eyes' death,*

*the Great Tree flashed into holy fire*

*and from his spell was his slave wife freed.*

*From the ashes of her family*

*the Raven's Wife pulled the holy book*

*that had enabled her husband's crimes.*

*Unburnt was the One-Eyed Sage's bible,*

*guarded from harm by divine power.*

*Amid the ashes, the widow vowed*

*to keep the Hanged Man's holy text*

*and protect those who would be wronged*

*should its powers fall into the hands*

*of another man with raven eyes.*

That tale was the thing a reader of the grimoire would first see upon opening the book. The story was unfamiliar to me, but I had a reaction to it in my mind, as if something deep within me knew with certainty that it held importance even as my conscious logic attempted to reject it as mere fiction, or possibly even folklore; it had the sound of myth, so I tried to reduce it to that, but my mind kept coming back to the fact I could never truly reconcile in my heart. My father had had this book in his possession for some time before his death. This occult item had been owned by my staunch sceptic of a dad. Why? My father had only ever cared about one thing for his entire life: facts, and the logic that connected them. Even more than me, that was the one thing he valued. So *why* had he owned this book of fairy tales?

The more I investigated, the less sense anything made. The only thing I could do was keep reading the book, hoping that there would be answers on one of its hundreds of pages. I had the time, since I was no longer working. Thanks to my inherited money, that wasn't nearly as immense a problem as it might have been otherwise. As long as I wasn't reckless with that money, I would be comfortable for quite a while even without working. That did nothing for the toll that locking myself in my room and reading and re-reading the grimoire took on my mind.

The book was filled with all sorts of religious, occult, and arcane writings. Scribed in handwriting that conformed to no particular language, resembling no script or alphabet I recognised but which I innately understood, the Hanged Man's grimoire told of powers so old and immense that simply thinking of some of them made my skull throb. The few whose natures were not harmful to my human mind still had no proper names attributed to them, and instead had aliases and titles, nicknames, that seemingly allowed them to be written of without incurring the negative consequences of using a true name. The One-Eyed Sage, as in the story, was one such power, but there were others. He Who Watches, The Lady of the Waters, The Storm King, The Liar in the Flames, and more. I didn't truly understand a lot of what the book had to say about those things, those Old Powers that it described but never truly named. I didn't feel very mad yet, so I kept reading.

The other thing of which the grimoire spoke at length was what it referred to as 'the Craft'. Spells, charms, hexes, curses, miracles, magic; whatever you like to call the act of making spontaneous phenomena occur through arcane means, the book was a sort of instruction manual for how to do it, as well as a bestiary or historical-mythological guide to different creatures and entities. The further into the grimoire I read, the more I learned about how to banish unwelcome spirits and how to conjure fire from nothing and how to enthrall the weak-minded. That was by far the larger part of what the grimoire had to offer in terms of knowledge.

Magic. This was where it lost me. Before, when reading about the Old Powers it claimed were fact, I had been intrigued and perhaps a little bit afraid of what it had all meant for my father, but I knew that magic wasn't real. I hoped that magic wasn't real, despite what I had asked Adam when begging him to help me unravel the mystery of my father's demise. This *Craft* was utter nonsense, something the father I thought I had known would have been ashamed to be caught dead with. Why had he had such drivel in his home? By the time that I finished reading the last page and closed the book to stare at the silver gilding of the tree with its ravens perched upon its branches, I was thinking hard. Why? It occurred to me again that the more I learned, the less I understood.

It couldn't be that the magic the book spoke of was real. The Old Powers were fairy tales and the Craft was superstition. It had to be that. The unfamiliar, intuitive script and language of the grimoire was simply a trick of the eyes and it was really a form of English that was designed to trick the reader. The whole thing was a work of fiction! But if that was the case, what of the ravens? What of the storm? What of the house, flashing into flame the second a spark formed? What of my father, with his disturbing black-marked skin and implausible wounds given that the story was that he'd died in a traffic accident?

I had asked Adam that idiotic question in a moment of weakness. Magic was not real. It couldn't be real. I thought in that moment that if magic was real, then everything I knew about anything was false. I couldn't face that. So I rejected it.

Hiding the book under my bed, I emerged from my room after what had to my mind been about five or six hours of reading. It was a thick tome, but a relatively quick read, or so it felt like. It could only have been four or so in the morning. Adam wouldn't have been awake yet. Moving into the living room, my body felt light and my head felt fuzzy, and I knew that I was feeling the effects of sleep-deprivation, but I didn't actually mind. It took my mind off things for a few pleasant moments. When I stepped out of my closed-up room and had to blink spots out of my eyes as sunlight streamed in through the windows, Adam stared at me like I had done something wrong as he sat on the couch, the television show he'd been watching forgotten as he glared at me. I froze and utterly failed to comprehend what was happening. As I stood there and stared at him, Adam took the initiative and broke the silence.

"Finally, you've emerged from hibernation," he said flatly, though there was an edge of unease to it. "You finally get hungry?"

"What?" I rasped through my shock, and found that my voice was quiet and hoarse, and that my throat and mouth were devoid of moisture. It suddenly hit me how awful I felt. As if focusing on something other than that book had broken some sort of trance, I came back to my senses and coughed roughly as my dry, swollen tongue blocked the air I had tried to get into my burning lungs. I blinked rapidly, my temples pounding hard every time the light from the sun outside hit my eyes. My knees shook and my hands trembled, but I had enough strength to stand. As I leaned against the wall, I wondered how in the world I had ended up like this.

"For real, are you good?" Adam asked as he leapt to his feet seeing the state I was in. "Do you need anything?"

I strained to ask for a glass of water, and tried to sip from the one he brought me in order to regain my ability to speak, but I ended up downing the whole glass in one long swallow. When I begged for more, Adam instead gave me a whole bottle full of water and had to refill it three times before I was done. As I collapsed onto the couch and he scrambled to prepare some food for me, I explained that I had spent the night reading the book I'd brought home from my father's old place, which had been destroyed by ravens and lightning and fire. Adam then ruined my mood even further by letting me know that I hadn't actually spent the night reading the grimoire.

"Dude. I haven't seen you leave your room for three days."

That sent me spiralling into panic and doubt. Three days. I had spoken to Adam to let him know about my decision to take time off work just the night before, but he swore that he had even tried knocking on my locked door and looking in on my room from the street, but hadn't heard or seen even movement or signs that I was inside the room in three days. The only thing that had stopped him from breaking down the door was the knowledge that my father had just died a little over a week ago at that point, and his respect for my need to be grieve in whatever way I needed to. I let him know as I ate a hastily assembled sandwich that I was actually, shockingly, okay about my father's passing, and that it was everything else going on around it that had me worried, and he was relieved at that. One question was still on my mind, though.

He remembered talking to me about my troubles with work, but for him, that hadn't happened last night, but three nights ago. It was all a confusing mess. I didn't say it, as I didn't even want to believe in it myself, but my mind did go to the grimoire. Was that book responsible for the time I'd lost somehow? I remembered every page exactly, but there was nothing to do with time in the book. I caught myself thinking as if the powers the book claimed to have were real, and forced myself to come up with an alternative explanation. I remembered the conversation we'd had the day everything had happened with the ravens and the storm and my father's death, after I'd asked Adam if he believed in magic.

"No," Adam had said with a tense laugh. "Who really believes in magic these days?"

"Right." I had repeated the word a few times, almost succumbing to mania in my panicked state. "No one believes in magic. Because it's not real."

"I mean," he had said abruptly, as if just remembering something. "I was religious as a kid, but if you count that as believing in magic, then most people would."

That memory came back to me then as I sat on the couch and plunged into despair and panic.

*From the ashes of her family*

*the Raven's Wife pulled the holy book*

*that had enabled her husband's crimes.*

The Hanged Man's grimoire, the book called itself on the title page inside the front cover. That story, the strange poem that read like folklore, there was no way my mind could wrap around the idea that it was the origin of the book itself. There was no way that under my bed was a bible that belonged to a religion so old that none now remember the story of its creation. There was simply no way.

"I'm going to sell the book," I said faintly as I found the strength to stand.

Adam paused in his bustling around the place trying to make accommodations for my frail, weak body that had begun to succumb to dehydration and malnourishment during those three empty days. "No way! Isn't that the one thing you actually got from your dad? You should keep it."

I didn't want it. I couldn't say why without revealing how scared I was that the things in the book were real, without making myself look like a fool, but I told him that I didn't want it. "It's nothing to me."

"If you're sure," Adam said warily. "You should think on it, though. You'll have to wait, anyway."

"And why are you the one deciding that?" I asked as I shuffled over toward the kitchen so I could get some more water for myself.

"Look at you, man!" Adam sighed and gestured at my weak body with both hands that then fell to his sides. "You're barely standing up right now. I don't know why you ended up this way, but there's only one way you're going to get better, and that's by resting. Drink, eat, sleep, and if you still want to sell the book in a week, sell it. But rest first."

I tried to fight Adam, though not because I thought he was wrong, or because I didn't want to rest and eat. I wanted those things so desperately that I felt like I would die if I didn't pass out right that second. I fought because I was scared, but I couldn't even admit that to myself, much less to him. I was scared of the book and what it would do to me next if I kept it any longer. The thing had survived rain, so dumping it outside to erode from exposure wouldn't destroy it, and if the story was true — I prayed to God for the first time in my life for certainty that it wasn't true — then fire wouldn't kill it either. I needed to be rid of it, and selling it was the only way I knew how to accomplish that end.

Reluctantly, I agreed to Adam's plan. I had just enough energy to clean myself and change clothes before collapsing into bed; I only noticed how badly I smelled when I took off the shirt that clung to my skin due to the grim and sweat and grease that had built upon my skin over three days of sitting in one place. I fell asleep, soothed into unconsciousness by the thumping rhythm of my own heart projected back at me from under the bed, where I had placed that Hanged Man's grimoire to sit until I was ready to banish it from my life.

The muffled sound of breaking glass and splintering wood roused me from my death-like slumber some hours later. I exploded into awareness; all my senses were buzzing with sensitivity, so much so that the Hanged Man’s grimoire sounded like the pounding of a fist against the floorboards under my bed as it pulsed with the tempo of adrenaline. My weak limbs flailed as I shot out of bed and stood on unsteady legs. Through the quickly fading haze of sleep, I heard voices out in the hall between my bedroom and Adam’s. I couldn’t discern specific words, but it was immediately obvious that there was more than one voice. Adrenaline pushed me into action, lightning in my veins urging me to act. I had no clue what I was supposed to do yet, but I knew that something had to be done.

Pressing my ear to my bedroom door, I held my breath and listened. There were at least two distinct voices, though there may have been three people out in the living room and two of them just sounded similar enough to blend together through the muffle of the door and wall between me and them. I tried to think of ways to possibly scare a group of home invaders off, but Adam and I had no gun between us nor any other kind of weapon in our rooms; the only weapon in our apartment would have been the knives in the kitchen, and I’d have to move past them to get to those if they had positioned themselves where I thought they had based on their voices. I was cornered.

A terrible thought came to me as I silently backed away from the door and took another look at my options. The rhythmic throbbing of the book of dark secrets hidden underneath my bed was louder in my ears than the thunder that had hammered at the world when lightning had struck down at me and obliterated my father’s home, shattering silence and drowning out voices. The grimoire had shown me ways of causing harm. If I needed a weapon to scare off a home invader, or perhaps defend myself if that didn’t work, then all I had to do was turn to a page that would tell me how to make a weapon out of nothing but my own will. I stared at my mattress as if I could see right through it to the book underneath. Following the book’s instructions, I could conjure fire from my hands or choke a man of his breath without ever laying a finger on him. I remembered how to do it. According to the book, I couldn’t do anything unless I was in physical contact with the grimoire, but I remembered how.

I could have done it.

*Could* I have? A thrill ran through me at the mere thought of it. I don’t remember if it was anticipation or dread. It didn’t matter; I was out of time to think.

My bedroom door was blasted off its hinges without sound nor impact for warning, and my blood ran cold as I leapt out of its way and dove over onto the other side of my bed, off of which the door — which had been broken across he middle so that it bent at an acute angle — bounced off the mattress and came to rest on the floor where I had stood a moment before. The figure I saw standing in my open doorway was entirely black, as it wore the shadows of night itself as a cloak that conformed precisely to the shape of their body. Gender was indiscernible, but whoever — whatever — had blown my door off was tall and wide, and would give me no easy passage if things became violent.

I had no choice. Sinking to my knees and sweeping a hand across the floor under my bed, I kept my eyes on the shadowed intruder as my hand slid onto the front cover of the Hanged Man’s grimoire. With the adrenaline flooding through me like magma igniting every nerve ending in my body, that silver gilding was so burning cold that I was surprised my fingers didn’t shatter instantly. As soon as my skin touched the book, the heartbeat coming from the grimoire pounded in my head, and I knew that I could have done it if I wished to. Rising back to my feet and dragging the grimoire up to my chest with my arm around it, the black shape shrouded in darkness shifted toward me abruptly, and there was no more room for *could*.

My body felt as though a faint breeze might have been able to blow it away as my arm floated up into view. It was as if another brain than mine controlled my limbs as I recalled in my mind’s eye the page that explained how to do what I thought of on a dime. A painful shivering wracked my body as I grew colder in an instant; according to the grimoire, this Craft it detailed was built upon a fundamental rule that all permutations of its magic adhered to — give and take, push and pull, sacrifice and reward. The Law of Invocation, it was called. In theory, anything could be sacrificed for any reward, but the grimoire recommended certain sacrifices for certain rewards, as there was an aspect of proportionality to the Law. Following the grimoire’s instructions, I invoked the magic of the Hanged Man through the conduit of his holy book and donated my own body heat in exchange for fire.

The thing stepping into my room was illuminated for a fraction of a second by the white fire that bathed the room in its radiant glow. It was as if my buzzing senses, previously brought to their limits by adrenaline, were pushed a hundred times further for that instant, as if the light forced me to see what I had cast it upon.

Tall, muscular and threatening in build, the person, if it was a person, wore flowing black clothes that resembled robes more than casual wear. Its face was obscured by some material that gleamed in the fire’s light, leather or something akin to it. That face covering swooped down over the head in a thick wedge of black that arced down to form a glinting beak. Two circular panes of some reflective material flashed in the sudden light and glared at me silently as the hulking form of the shadow lurched away from me and brought its arms up in a distinctly fearful manner, as if to shield itself from what was to come. A thick braid of brown cord, winding around itself again and again, swung as the shadow’s attempt to flee caused it to swing around its neck.

That moment, that half-second of time frozen before me in a tableau of clashing light and shadow, was destroyed completely by the torrent of holy flame that exploded out of a point in the air and follow the vague arc my arm had made in rising. That tidal wave of sterile fire blinded me to anything else, and I closed my eyes as my entire body went numb for a time and I collapsed onto my back as I lost feeling in my limbs from the cold that stabbed at me from within. Without the bodily warmth that I had donated in order to conjure that flame out of thin air, I was left a shivering mess on the floor of my room as the corner where the door and intruder had once been burned.

What pushed me to action again was my lungs beginning to burn as I breathed in the oily smoke that began to fill the room as the walls and floor and ceiling were swallowed and eaten away at by the pale flames that began to spread unchecked. When I stood, there was no sign of the intruder, nor any of their fellows. The heat biting at my skin and the cold hollowing me out inside were both amplified by the thrill of physiological stress and arcane powers suffusing my body and mind in synchronisation with one another. Every feeling was simply *more*, and so it was that much harder to drag myself to my feet and open up the window to throw myself out of it, which I did and then promptly landed far too roughly on my back on the fire escape right outside. I laid on the hard, cold metal for a moment as I emptied my lungs of smoke and took in clean air, until the ache in my chest when I inhaled began to fade and I forced my feet to take my weight again and closed the window behind me.

With my physical weakness and newfound hypothermia, it was a Herculean effort to drag myself and the book across the fire escape and leap over to the ladder and landing that stood outside the window to Adam’s bedroom. I heard nothing but the pounding of the book’s heartbeat, not even my own, as I threw the book over and launched myself after it. My numb fingers almost slipped from around the painfully cold metal, but I hauled myself onto the metal grate within the bars that almost didn’t stop me from falling three stories to my death anyway. I threw the window open and shouted into the dark room, which was barely lit by the moonlight streaming in around my head as I peered in.

Adam flailed under his blankets for a moment as he shot awake, and I began to get my shivering under control as my body warmed little by little from simple exertion, though not nearly as quickly as I would’ve liked. He looked over at me with sluggish eyes and I waved him over to me. I shouldn’t have shouted, that might’ve given my location away. I didn’t know who or what was after me, or why, but I had a vague idea, and I wouldn’t let them hurt me or my best friend, and I wouldn’t let them take the book, if that’s truly what these people — these things? — wanted. After reading the book, I wasn’t sure what to believe anymore, wasn’t sure what I *wanted* to believe, but I wasn’t going to let that uncertainty get Adam killed. I beckoned him over to the window and even though I couldn’t hear him over the thumping of the book against my chest as I held it close in the bend of my elbow, his lips moved in a manner as if to ask, *What are you doing?*

If I had been of clearer mind, I might’ve hesitated to tell him truly, but with the energies flooding my body and the fear flooding my mind, I spoke without thinking. “The book is magic. Something’s coming for me. I made fire with my mind.” Saying it out loud for the first time finally jarred me out of the mental fog I’d been in since waking, and I sagged against the cold metal railings of the fire escape as I breathed hard, though my breathlessness had nothing to do with the cold or my fatigue. “The book *is* magic. Magic is real.”

Adam stared at me as we shivered — which for me was a simple t-shirt and boxer brief, and Adam wasn’t wearing much more than that — though my trembling was much worse as my shoulders shook with silent, wheezing laughter that echoed in the empty, dark street. The book fell away from me and impacted heavily on the metal grate keeping me from falling to my demise, and ice flashed through me as if I’d conjured another fireball, though I now recognise that as the sensation of the grimoire’s magic leaving me when I lost contact with it. As I reeled from that, I saw out of the corner of my eye smoke blacker than the night sky above leaking out of my closed bedroom window through its thin seam. I pointed at it with a nearly limp hand and Adam leaned out of the window to look. His jaw dropped and made a noise of outrage and shock, which I could hear without the book hammering against the inside of my skull.

Adam’s face was a roiling sea of anxiety and uncertainty as he looked down at me and gripped the windowsill hard. “If you’re messing with me right now, it’s not funny, dude.”

“Not messing with you,” I said as I gathered up the book in my hands. With concentration, I could hear what Adam said next.

“Then what the hell are we supposed to do?” Adam shouted, his frantic voice echoing into the night.

I couldn’t even attempt to quiet Adam before his own bedroom door was blown off its hinges by a force that caved it in at the middle. He turned to stare as I thrust my hand forward between the window’s frame and Adam’s body, an instant before a gliding shadow poured itself into the room as if its form was insubstantial, fluid. Adam screamed and staggered back against the window so that he tumbled out onto the fire escape beside me, but it was cramped with the both of us there, so I was pushed aside even as I held my hand out to prepare to conjure another fireball if I must.

The shadow was much slimmer than the one I had killed, almost feminine in its graceful agility as it seemed to float over the floor of Adam’s room as gas floats over liquid. Liquid shadow clung to and dripped from its lanky body so that a cape of darkness fluttered behind and around it in a breeze that didn’t touch us. Its face protruded into a pointed beak as well, which took on a gleam as it moved into the moonlight that faintly lit the pitch black of the night. This new shadow’s cape of darkness and its beak were blacker even than what I saw when I blinked tears out of my eyes as Adam and I backed against the railing of the fire escape.

It spoke as it approached the window from the far side of the room. The sound did not carry over air; it was like the grimoire’s heartbeat, it existed entirely within my mind, and its harsh, whispered words, spoken in a language I did not know and couldn’t innately comprehend, stung behind my eyes and between my ears as I tried to understand. That voice sent goosebumps erupting all over my body, and as Adam screamed at my side, I hesitated. I could have conjured up another fireball, but I was still freezing cold and shivering violently from the last time. Would I survive another? The last thing I wanted to do was find out.

“Run!” I shouted and threw the book down the fire escape to the landing one floor below, which impacted loudly and caused a number of birds to scatter into the sky after being woken from their slumber. Shoving Adam down the ladder, I leapt down after him and landed just as hard as the book had.

We looked up and waited just long enough for us to see smoky shadows leaking out of the open window, and we paused just long enough for me to groan over the idiocy of not closing the window at least, before we repeated our descent down a level of the fire escape twice more touching down on solid ground at the bottom and running out onto the street for visibility’s sake. Adam and I staggered into the middle of the road and stared back at the fire escape as liquid shadow flowed down the ladder and through the gaps in the landings as smoke flowed out of the two windows facing the street three floors above the ground. A faint light cut through the smoke, flickering between orange and white. The two of us began cursing under our breaths as we fought for air after the abrupt sprint. That was our home, and it was going up in flames … and it was my fault.

The shadow reformed into the shape of a black-cloaked person wearing that beaked mask as it found solid footing. It strode with its fluid grace into the street out of the shadows of the alley between our apartment building and its neighbour, and the details of its form became visible in all of its elongated, frail slimness. It moved with agility and strength it should not have had given the thinness of its limbs. My hands closed on the book as I searched my mind for any solution to the problem we were facing, and Adam grasped my shoulder hard as he tried to pull me away and flee. There had to be a way to kill this second shadow. But what of the third? Had there ever even been a third, or had I made that up in my sleep-induced confusion? I didn’t want to kill myself then and there, but I didn’t know if I had a choice, or if there was a way to kill these things other than fire. We were trapped.

As Adam and I stared at this shadow person approaching us with its psychic whispers beginning to stab at our brains from within, I recalled the Law of Invocation. The grimoire was very clear. Anything could be sacrificed for any return. Some things were more effective and reliable to sacrifice for specific desired effects, but if I wished, I technically could have sacrificed my tongue or a finger for knowledge of the future or an eye for unmatched skill at yodelling. As I remembered that clause of the Law, I held my hand out and stared not at the shadow, which I could see between my fingers, but at my fingers themselves, evaluating them, judging which I thought I could live without and which I thought I might need. The shadow halved the distance between us and it before I had the courage to choose.

As my hand shook in the air in front of me, the street was illuminated in a flash as if by lightning. The index finger on my right hand was consumed by white flame that banished shadows and rendered the black humanoid bare of its swirling, amorphous cloak, leaving its frail form bare in the blinding light. Waves of hot and cold shot up my arm as my finger crumbled away and was eaten away by holy fire that streaked forward and struck the dark stalker in the face. I cradled my hand, missing its index finger and pouring hot, bright red blood onto my shirt, to my chest as Adam and I watched the dark figure’s body flash into white flame in an instant like paper and vanish just as quickly.

I clenched my bleeding hand into a fist a few times to get a feel for its new shape, and felt an empty cold began to seep up my arm as the blood gushing from the burnt stump of my knuckle became frightening in its volume.

“Come on!” Adam said, his iron grip on my shoulder snapping me out of the pain and fear that had held me in place.

Adam led the way and I forced myself to follow as we fled our burning apartment building and disappeared into the night. In its totality, that incident had a duration of less than five minutes, but those five minutes changed everything. We couldn’t talk while we ran, so we moved through the streets in silence. There was an unspoken understanding between us; we couldn’t go to anyone about this, this was something that was between us and us alone. Who would help? Who would even hear us out? I wasn’t particularly enthusiastic about the idea of telling a cop or doctor about how I had been attacked by shadow demons and had burned my apartment down in self-defence.

I didn’t want to be institutionalised and lose the book. Don’t misunderstand — I wasn’t scared of losing my ability to learn more from it. Somehow, every one of the grimoire’s pages was clear in my mind; it must have been part of the magic of the book to imprint it so completely on my memory. Rather, I remembered as we ran part of the story at the very front of the holy text, the one that I believed in enough at this point to trust it to inform my decision-making.

*Amid the ashes, the widow vowed*

*to keep the Hanged Man's holy text*

*and protect those who would be wronged*

*should its powers fall into the hands*

*of another man with raven eyes.*

Was this why that character — it was keeping me as sane as I thought I could be in such a situation to still behave as though the story was just that — had chosen to keep the grimoire in her possession despite her horrible experiences with it? Had the wife of the Hanged Man, the deified Raven Eyes, chosen to safeguard the book for the same reason that formed in my head as my best friend and I ran through the streets of our hometown that suddenly felt hostile and unfamiliar under the pale, ghostly light of the moon? I felt a deep sense of unease at the thought of losing the book. Not because I felt attached to the grimoire itself, though I thought I might have liked investigating the powers it granted me in any other situation than the one I happened to be caught in.

Fear unlike any I had ever known before filled the entirety of my being when I considered the sheer chaos and death that a person could unleash upon the world if the Hanged Man’s grimoire was placed in the hands of a person any worse than I. This fear didn’t come from any sort of pride or egoism about my own immense goodness. It came from the knowledge that even as I ran for my life and feared what I had done with the powers of the grimoire, I knew that I would use its powers again, because I had been filled with such unparalleled ecstasy wielding the Old Powers that I feared what a man with darker inclinations than myself might be compelled to do to chase that thrill.

We made it to Adam’s cousin’s place right around sunrise. In our hurry to flee, we didn’t take either of our cell phones, so we hadn’t been able to call ahead, but Adam’s cousin, a woman just a year older than the two of us who I’d known almost as long as I’d known Adam himself, took us in without question seeing that we were both freezing our asses off in our pyjamas. We slept on the floor that morning, but that was more than good enough for us after the night we’d had. We slept the day away and even when Adam woke, as I was later told, I slept the next few days as well, recovering my strength after losing seventy-two hours to the grimoire. What more would I lose by the time this was done? Would this ever be done? Those were the thoughts and questions that fuelled my nightmares over the next week.

Unfortunately for both myself and, most importantly I think, Adam, the worst for both of us was still yet to come.
