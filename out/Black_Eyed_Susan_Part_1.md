Fame is a fickle thing. It’s not often that the most talented or most impressive person in their field becomes the most famous. For every famous person, there’s a hundred with a bigger resume who never got the recognition. The same, morbidly, is true of serial killers. You’d think the biggest ones would be the worst ones. Why would they be the most famous – or infamous – if they weren’t the baddest? But then you look harder, and you realize you were only scratching the surface.

 

Depravity runs deep. Evil’s roots spread wide. Everywhere that people exist, bad people exist too. They always have and they always will. Some are loud, and some are quiet. Sometimes it’s the ones that don’t get talked about, the ones under the radar, that are the worst. The ones working in the shadows.

 

Black Eyed Susan was the moniker of a serial killer in and around my hometown of Willow Bay, Nova Scotia. You can guess why they were not all that well-known - because where the hell is Willow Bay, Nova Scotia?

 

For those unaware: Nova Scotia is a maritime province on the east coast of Canada; and Willow Bay is a quaint little coastal town on the lower west side. It sits within a larger area in Nova Scotia called Annapolis Valley, which is locally referred to as just “The Valley.” It’s beautiful and scenic, full of vast prairies and beaches. You can see the stars year-round. There’s good, fresh air; lots of friendly people. There’s an apple festival, it’s great.

 

The Valley is a place where people like to settle down. Many retirees and families will come to escape city life and live out their days peacefully. Many others are born here and just can’t imagine leaving. It’s the kind of place where you don’t think evil can exist.

 

Sure, it’s a little more “old school” and religious than other places. A little bit backwoods here and there. Hunting rifles are commonplace, teeth are less so. There’s violence and cruelty just like anywhere else. Many a drunken fight or a schoolyard hazing, there were rough types and creeps, but we didn’t get “Evil.” We didn’t get kidnappers or mass shooters; definitely not serial killers. Except for Black Eyed Susan. That was a name we all knew about.

 

Growing up it was just a name. The name of an old local boogeyman. We never really learned or bothered to look much into the real story. We’d pick up bits and pieces, but parents tended to avoid mentioning it. All we really had were the fantastical legends conjured up by teenagers to scare their younger siblings. It spread around the schoolyard like wildfire.

 

The real story, such as it was, was this: His victims were all young women, aged 15 to 18 – and yes I said “his.” The words “For Black Eyed Susan” would be found carved somewhere on all of his crime scenes, and the papers ran with it before they knew his real identity. He was found responsible for 6 murders over the course of 10 years, but had been suspected in the disappearances of at least 8 others throughout the Valley.

 

His methods were bizarre and seldom written about; much was left up to speculation about what his victims actually endured while in his captivity. Those who went missing would be gone for months and, when found, would only have been recently deceased. They would be found artistically displayed, often in Christ-like poses hung up and coiled within trees, vines, and flowers. Sometimes flowers would be found within the bodies themselves. It’s unclear whether they were placed there, or if he had actually somehow planted them inside the body. Their eyes would be missing, as would their brain and most other vital organs. They appeared to be removed surgically, post mortem. Their blood was also drained.

 

He turned himself in and confessed to the confirmed murders in 2004; his real name revealed to be Darren Barbeau. He refused to comment on any of the other disappearances that he was implicated in. Within his first week in prison, he suffered a brain aneurysm and died. He was 62.

 

That’s the profile of Black Eyed Susan. Those are the facts. Darren Barbeau was a sick, vile, and truly evil man who destroyed many lives and caused untold pain to the community for many years, and he died before he was able to truly face justice what he did.

 

Unfortunately, that is only the beginning of the story.

 

What he really did to these girls, what it was all for, and the things I saw when I became involved paint an even darker and more impossible picture. One that defies comprehension, sanity, and everything I used to believe to be reality. One that I am still struggling to put together... I’ll start at the beginning.

 

The three of us grew up in the early 2000s. Black Eyed Susan was gone by the time we were six. I don’t remember much of life while he was still around. I can only speculate on the fears and anxieties of the adults in our life.

 

We were inseparable. I met Emily in grade 4 and we instantly became best friends, then around grade 5 we sort of adopted Heather. We had other friends on the side here and there, but it was really just the three of us from that point on. We hung out almost every day, we talked about everything, we laughed together, and we cried together. Em made the three of us friendship bracelets with all our names. We were sisters.

 

I wanted to call us the Hell Sisters because of our names – Heather, Emily, and Lila – but Emily’s dad was a pastor so that never went public. I’d like to say we got into mischief, but that was mostly all me. Em and Heather were the good kids – though they could not be more different.

 

Heather was tough. Heather was the one who finished the fights that I started. Her hair was an impossible orange mess from day one and could not be fixed. Her skin would be completely ghostly white if it wasn’t almost constantly burnt. She was a country girl through and through. Her parents owned a farm and they put her to work since she was a fetus, but she never complained. She tended to keep to herself a lot. She had no friends when Em and I came along, but we loved her immediately. We did stop going to her house though, because her parents would try to get us to help out around the farm and we simply could not handle it.

 

Em was a dainty little thing. She was the blonde princess that every uptight Christian parent dreams of. Her father took great care to mold her into that image, and I took great pride in being a horrible influence on her. She was well-mannered, obedient, and ridiculously sheltered; but I can’t say they didn’t do anything right because she was truly the sweetest girl on the planet. It was almost annoying how positive and lovely she was, but I couldn’t help but absolutely adore her. I was eternally compelled to protect her, and so was Heather.

 

As for me… I wasn’t tough like Heather, and I wasn’t sweet like Em, but I was the one who could take all the shit. When we got in trouble, Em and Heather would get scared, so I would take it. When kids would make fun of us, Em and Heather would cry, so I would take it. I didn’t care, and nothing could hurt me… At least that’s the image I wanted to project.

 

We were explorers as kids. We loved to go out on little adventures, and find all the weird places out in the middle of nowhere. Our parents let us. Like I said, it was old school. Just be home in time for dinner, et cetera. It also helps that we often lied about how far we would go.

 

The explorer phase didn’t last terribly long, however. Just a few years, until we were about twelve. I wanted it to last longer but we had to put an end to it one day. That day is where our story begins.

 

“It’s too far, Lila! It would be dark before we even got there.” Em said.

 

“I have to be back for my chores before sundown.” Heather added.

 

“Stop being pussies, guys! I got it all worked out. Stacy’s brother can give us a ride to Lightbody Ranch and from there it’s an hour’s walk, tops.” I assured them with utmost confidence.

 

“My dad would NOT be happy if he found out I went up there. Or that I got in a car with a stranger.” Em combatted.

 

“Your dad is never happy!”

 

“What’s this about you sucking off strangers in cars?” yelled a familiar voice from behind us. The boy who thought he was so clever was named Mitch Fraser. The only kid in 6th Grade more foul mouthed than me, and a true tyrant.

 

“I expect that from Street Trash, but not from you Emily.” Mitch added as he approached, flanked by his little posse of Dale and Bennett.

 

“Fuck off Mitch.” These words were pre-programmed in me by now.

 

“I’m not talking to you, Trash. I’m trying to have a conversation with Emily.”

 

“Gross.” Em muttered.

 

“Gross? I’m not the one sucking dicks in cars. But that’s what you get when you hang out with emo skanks like Lila Kelly.”

 

“Don’t talk about her like that!” Heather shouted. I kept telling them not to get angry. Not to yell, or cry. I knew even back then, that would just encourage them. But they couldn’t help it, bless their hearts.

 

“Hey, the lesbian can talk!” Dale added. I guarantee he had no idea what that word meant, he just liked to parrot everything Mitch said. Also joke’s on him, that turned out to be me.

 

Heather went silent, as did Em. I just stood there seething with rage. I wanted to punch him in his stupid fat face, but I’ve been down that road before. While it was awesome, it didn’t end well.

 

“Alright, guys, alright. Let’s leave them to it. Clearly they have BIG plans. Where are you losers off to this time anyway?” Mitch asked, with a palpable smugness.

 

“Like I’d tell you. Go jerk eachother off.” I responded. Admittedly, I also didn’t know what that meant.

 

“Maybe this will be the time Black Eyed Susan gets them.” Dale piped up again.

 

Mitch’s eyes lit up “Yeah! You know what my brother told me? He said he doesn’t just kill you. He said he holds you hostage and feeds you to his plants.”

 

I shook my head. “That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard. How do you feed someone to plants? Plants don’t eat.”

 

“He waters his plants with your blood. And then when he’s done with you, he turns you into fertilizer – but still alive!” He explained, really trying to add creepiness to his voice.

 

“You’re making that up!” Em yelled. She frightened easily. Despite how many times I told her it was all bullshit, she would still get shaken by these tales – and these kids knew it.

 

“Tell your brother to be more creative next time, dipshit.” I shouted.

 

“Fuck you. I hope you enjoy being plant food.” Mitch and his pals walked away laughing. He really did seem proud of that exit line.

 

“It’s not true. They’re dumb.” Em said, clearly seeking reassurance.

 

“Of course not. Stop worrying about what those idiots say, alright? They just wanna scare us. That guy died a long time ago anyway so it doesn’t matter. Now focus up, let’s get through last period, then we’ll go see Stacy’s brother and do this thing.”

 

The bell rang and we went inside. Two more long, boring hours later and we were on our way. Stacy’s brother Dom was 16, had a license, and was always trying to hang out with us for some reason. He did occasionally have his uses, like today. He drove us in his dad’s old pickup over to Lightbody Ranch, and agreed to pick us back up at 8. From there, we headed north.

 

“I don’t know about that guy…” Heather said.

 

“Who, Dom? He’s alright I think.” I replied with that childlike naivety. “But if he’s weird, we’ll just kill him.”

 

“Can we not talk about killing so much right now?” Em interjected. “Why are we even going to this place? It’s so creepy.”

 

“Heather found it, ask her.”

 

“I just said it looked cool, I didn’t say I wanted to GO there.” Heather explained.

 

“It does look cool. A place that’s always foggy? That’s awesome. We had to come see it.” I said, attempting to raise the excitement level.

 

“But what about killers?” Em asked.

 

“Why would there be a killer out in the middle of nowhere in the fog? There’s no one to even kill, and you wouldn’t be able to see who you’re killing. Think about it.” I said with the soundest logic.

 

Our walk went on, and the fog came into view. An endless wall of it, concealing the faint shadowy spires of dozens of trees. A gorgeous, eerie sight. Em got more and more nervous as we approached, but Heather began to match my excitement.

 

“Whoa this looks so cool!” Heather said.

 

“That’s insane! How is there that much fog?” I added.

 

“My dad said something about a cold current meeting a warm stream.” Heather explained.

 

“I don’t know what that means.”

 

“It’s beautiful.” Heather said, ignoring my stupidity. “Let’s go.”

 

“Oh god.” Em lamented.

 

“I’ll hold your hand, Em.” I offered. Em gave me an exaggerated death glare and silently extended her hand. I took it and the three of us walked inside.

 

It was stunning. The desaturated greys that hung like a veil over the trees created an ethereal effect that somehow perfectly complimented the bright autumn colours of the dead leaves littering the ground. It was like something both enchanted and haunted.

 

“Okay guys it’s really hard to see in here. Let’s not go in any further. Let’s just stay here.” Em said, being the voice of reason.

 

“Yeah, you’re right Em. I don’t wanna get lost.” Heather agreed.

 

I let out an audible groan, “Fine. Good idea.”

 

So we sat in a circle, our backs to trees, just taking and taking in the sights. Em eventually mellowed out and agreed it was beautiful in here. The sun began to set which only made it more gorgeous.

 

“I’d love to just disappear in here, you know?” Heather said, sounding deep in thought.

 

“What do you mean by that?” I asked, genuinely puzzled.

 

“Just… I don’t know. Get away from it all. Nobody would ever bother us. Nobody would even find us. We could just… live.”

 

“That sounds like it would get boring though.” I responded.

 

“I get that, Heather.” Em answered.

 

We sat in silence for a few minutes. I really did try to understand the appeal of what Heather said, but I wasn’t there yet.

 

The sun set quickly and the rich, deep blues of the night sky added another layer of beauty to the forest. Unfortunately, it was almost time to go. Heather and I lamented that fact, but Em was ready to get out of there. She was the first to stand up, but as she did, she let out a small shriek.

 

I jumped, and looked over to see her staring off into the fog.

 

“What is it, Em?”

 

Em responded in a hushed and shaky voice, not averting her eyes, “Who is that?”

 

A shiver crept up my spine. No one was supposed to be here. I looked where Em was looking. Initially, I couldn’t see anything but my eyes began to adjust… There was a faint silhouette of a figure lurking amongst the trees and the blue/grey haze. A long ways away, if it were any further we wouldn’t be able to see it at all. It was a human shaped figure… Only, it wasn’t moving and its arms were outstretched to either side – completely horizontal. It almost looked to me like someone mocking the crucifixion. But it… couldn’t be a person. It just didn’t make sense.

 

“I think that’s just a tree or something.” I said, squinting into the dark.

 

“It looks like a person.” Heather added.

 

“Yeah.” Em agreed. Both of their voices were so shaky now, but I was skeptical.

 

“No, guys, that can’t be a person. They’re not moving, their arms are out all weird. Why would someone just stand there like that? It’s just a trick of the shadows.” I rationalized, not entirely confident in my words.

 

The longer we stared, the more its lack of movement unnerved me; but also the more it confirmed in my eyes that it couldn’t be a real person.

 

“Maybe it’s a… statue?” Heather posited.

 

“I’m gonna go look.” I said.

 

“What!?” Em exclaimed, trying very hard to remain as quiet as possible.

 

“No! What’s wrong with you!?” Heather said, bewildered.

 

“Guys! Chill! It’s not a person, and I’m not gonna go right up to it. I’m just gonna walk a few steps forward until I can make out what it is. Just a few feet.”

 

“Let’s just go!” Em pleaded.

 

“Don’t be stupid!” Heather added, not mincing words.

 

“Just a few feet. Nothing’s gonna happen. You guys are so dramatic.”

 

I began to walk ahead, despite their objections. I was scared, but confident enough by this point. The figure grew in my vision as I got closer. The grey of its silhouette got darker and darker. Its features began to clarify. Definitely human shaped, but its head was misshapen. Not a statue, as it was clearly wearing clothes of some kind, but they were unusually loose and baggy.

 

I ended up walking a few steps further than I intended. I heard Heather and Em quietly shouting for me to come back but I had to know. I could make out vague details now. A few steps further and I could finally see… The misshapen head was actually a burlap sack, and it looked like there might have been some kind of smiley face on it. It was…

 

“It’s a fucking scarecrow!” I shouted.

 

“Really?” asked Em, a palpable relief in her voice.

 

“Yep. Just a scarecrow.” I said, laughing as I turned around and walked back to my friends. “I told you guys it wasn’t a person.”

 

“Why is there a scarecrow in the middle of a forest?” Heather questioned.

 

“Who knows… That was funny though.”

 

“No it wasn’t. Can we go now?” Em again pleaded.

 

I let out another chuckle and nodded. We were about ready to leave, but then, from just a few feet away in the opposite direction of the scarecrow…

 

“Little flowers...” A deep, male voice softly called out to us. We all shot to attention. All of us, too shocked to scream.

 

“What was that!?” Em whispered. We all looked around frantically in every direction. Nothing. We couldn’t see anything past the fog and the deep blue darkness. I couldn’t see the scarecrow anymore either. Why couldn’t I see it anymore? I reached out, grabbing Em and Heather’s shoulders and pulling them towards me. They grabbed onto me in return.

 

“What the fuck? What the fuck??” I whispered.

 

“We have to go! Now!” Heather commanded, matching our attempted whispers.

 

“Which way did we come in?” Em asked.

 

“That way!” Heather said, pointing to her left.

 

Before we started making a run for it, we heard the distinct sound of a twig snapping… Dangerously close to us. This time we did scream, and we ran.

 

Fortunately, Heather was right and we ran out of that place fast. Past the trees, and past the fog, into the plain open field. But we did not stop running until we reached Lightbody Ranch.

 

We collapsed in a heap when we finally got close enough to safety. All of us, in tears.

 

“I’m never doing anything like that again, Lila! Never again!” Em snapped. I had never seen her like this before.

 

“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry guys. I don’t know what that was.” I shouted through heavy breaths. Heather didn’t say a word, she just cried.

 

We didn’t tell anybody about that night, but we agreed to stop exploring. The next few days were a little tense. I felt awful about making them go up there with me. They forgave me, because they’re the best, but I didn’t forgive myself. What I saw and what I heard replayed over and over in my mind for several nights. I can only imagine it did the same for them too.

 

After a while, though, we were able to laugh about it in our own ways. The fear lingered beneath the surface, but we felt safe enough in our town in the daylight. I noticed small changes in my friends ever since that day. Em got a little more skittish, and she didn’t want to go outside as much. Heather did the opposite. I think a part of her enjoyed the adrenaline. As for me, I think I was a bit less of a brat after that. I stopped pressuring them into doing the stupid shit I wanted to do. I didn’t want to be that person anymore.

 

As more years passed, more things changed in us. As things do. Boys began to be part of our lives. Well - their lives, and my life by proxy. Em got herself a boyfriend at 15 – practically an arranged marriage by her dad. Didn’t go far, but it was a good excuse for dad to get his precious daughter away from her lower class heathen friends as much as possible.

 

Heather was a different story. That Dom guy stayed in our lives, much to our annoyance at first. But then he and Heather got close. Heather was 16 now and we were all going through the madness of that age in our own ways. She didn’t get any attention from boys growing up, since they would all call her… you know… So when this cute older guy started working his charm on her at that vulnerable age, it worked. Em and I tried to act supportive as her friends, but even as young and stupid as we were, we knew it wasn’t right. It was too fast, he was too old and too… much, and we were worried. When Em and I began to bring up our concerns over this new relationship is when tension began. She didn’t want to hear it, and he began feeling threatened.

 

She saw more of him and less of us. Less of everyone, actually. At some point she began staying with him full time. God knows what he was filling her head with, because every time we did see her, she was less and less of the girl we knew. She would blow up at us. She would be vile towards us. This went on for 8 months and we tried, we all tried to get her back, but everything we did pushed her closer to him. So many nights ended in heartache.

 

Eventually it all blew up. He took something a little too far and enough was enough. She got out, and Em was right there when she did.

 

But I wasn’t… I should have been, and it is the greatest regret of my life that I didn’t just go over there and hug her and tell her I loved her. I just… couldn’t. I was still mad. Not mad at her, just mad at everything. I looked at Heather and all I could see were the countless nights of Em crying in my arms.

 

We all tried to be friends again. On the surface it seemed like we were, but it wasn’t the same. We were damaged. Em was the only one really trying to keep us together. I wanted to try, for her, but I was too disconnected. The next few weeks we drifted further and further apart.

 

I will always remember the morning of April 22nd, 2015. Em called me out of the blue at 10am while I was skipping school. Her voice was shaking and frantic, and she was yelling “They can’t find Heather. Heather’s gone. Heather’s gone.” Over and over.

 

Dom was the prime suspect in the eyes of police, and certainly in the eyes of me. But there was no evidence. No evidence of any foul play whatsoever, in fact. So, people started saying she did it herself… She just “ran away.”

 

I eventually accepted that. As much as it hurt, it unfortunately made sense. She was always one to isolate when things were bad… She went through so much. She may have felt like she didn’t have anyone, and that was my fault. I let her down. That thought tore me apart.

 

Em never accepted it. She refused to believe that Heather would just run away. So, we continued to search. Even after everyone else stopped. If I didn’t go with Em, she would have gone out on her own, and I couldn’t bear the thought of that.

 

We set out to turn every stone in the Valley, much against our families’ wishes. I never had a problem disobeying, but to see Em so vehemently and directly oppose her parents’ orders scared the crap out of me.

 

We began our searches, tying ribbons to trees to mark our location when we got far out into the wilderness. Those first few days it would be me who would cry, not Em. The guilt bore a hole in me, but Em was my rock. That was the thing about Em. She was a very delicate girl, she cried a lot, but the second someone else needed her to be strong – she was iron. She always had a way of comforting people too, especially me.

 

Once our parents accepted that we wouldn’t stop searching, they were at least able to persuade us to be back home by nightfall, and to not go into the areas without cell reception.

 

One night we disobeyed both of those requests.

 

Somewhere in the northern section, beyond Lightbody Ranch, amidst the hills and the prairies, was a forest that was always foggy. We always had it in the back of our minds that maybe she went back there. We were told that the area was searched already, but if she didn’t want to be found, it would be easy not to be. So, we had to go there. We had to go back.

 

END OF PART 1
