The mist here creates a heavy fog every single day ‘till about 3:00pm but it comes back by dusk. Can’t see more than 5 feet ahead of you. Mr. Wyre once told me that the Beasts create the fog so they can move around town freely without detection. But Mr. Wyre also lives in a nest by the library and does meth under a blanket. Mom says the mist is because of all the flooding which feels needlessly naive. Mr Wyre might not have it one hundred percent right but he understands what’s important: Nothing about this place is natural, so why should the rules be? 

In those few hours a day where the fog lifts, everything becomes shockingly clear. Like getting your first pair of glasses, not even realizing how bad your vision was. I admire the old brick buildings, some abandoned, others littered with stressed out workers. I watch the crawling sunset over the crescent shaped bay vanish back into the mist like everything else. I lean down to grab my backpack, disturbing its rest against the tree. 

“Dante?” A voice calls out from the way I came. Shit. “It’s Landon. Please don’t run.” 

It takes every bone in my body not to. Sweat drips down the back of my neck as Landon catches up to me. 

‘“I said not to follow me.” I snarl , splashing my boot in a grainy puddle. 

“Well I said not to run. We’ll call it even.” The tall skinny white boy catches his breath before continuing, “Where are you even gonna go? Camping in the woods for the rest of your life?”

“Mr. Wyre’s been here longer than any of us and he makes do.” 

“Yeah, well Mr. Wyre has a court-ordered ban from the cemetery.” Landon snarkily responds. 

“She’s furious at me, dude. I got nowhere to go even if I wanted to.”

“I’ll talk to Shelby, have you on the couch for–” 

“No, you won’t. I’ve got enough problems already.” 

“Fine,” He’s quick to fold on that possibility but excitedly moves closer to me.  “Let me put you up for a night in the Visitant. You shouldn’t be outside tonight.

As the last of the sunlight collapses behind layers of clouds, the mist returns in full force. It whispers in the wind alongside me and Landon. For the first fifteen minutes of our walk, I listen to the cars tearing through puddles on the side of the road and think about the last time I spent a night at the Visitant. I was nine or ten and our power had gone out. Dad took us there for a few nights while it got sorted. An impromptu getaway became the best few days of my childhood. I spent all day in the indoor water park, cycling through all three big slides. There was a hotel breakfast with a waffle maker and cartoons available on the tv in my room. It feels wrong now, after everything that’s happened. I look down, imagining everyone staring at me as I walk through the revolving door into the dimly lit lobby. Landon goes to the front desk, to get my room sorted. I find the nearest table and collapse backwards into the chair. 

I hear someone approaching behind me and I instinctively apologize to Landon, realizing how ridiculous I’ve probably come across. Before I can get a thought in, someone else entirely takes the seat across from me. 

“I thought I recognized you.” She puts up her curly light brown hair and smiles warmly. “Good to see you, D.” 

“Katie?” I ask, my stomach dropping. I can’t tell if I’m more excited or surprised. 

“How’s it going? How’s your mom?” 

“What… She’s fine– why are you here? The Reap is… tomorrow. I thought I might never see you again." 

“Yeah, well, family.”  She closes that conversation down fast and redirects, “why are you at a hotel?” She ponders softly.

“I ran away.” I admit. “Or I tried to. I tried to get somewhere… anywhere. I ended up just getting lost. My stepbrother found me and is sponsoring my stay, at least for tonight. He’s over there at the front desk.” I point him out, wondering what is taking so long. He’s far away, but Landon looks distressed. 

“Because of the Reap?” 

“No. Well actually yeah, sort of. I mean, it’s everything. You got out. You’re out there… somewhere… living your life away from all this shit, away from Burningtown. It’s gotta be better out there.”

“I don’t know. Maybe. I’m back, aren’t I?” 

“For how long?” 

“Well, hopefully just through tomorrow. If, you know, things turn to shit, I’ll have to extend my stay.” She explains angrily.. My eyes widen. 

“Lily’s an offer…” I realize. She stares down in silence. She didn’t need a reminder. “I’ll be praying for you.”

“Thanks, D. I gotta get some rest but I’ll see you tomorrow. Nice to run into you.”

“Yeah, you too Katie. Have a good night.” 

Well, I definitely fucked that one up.  Landon returns in a huff, muttering under his breath. He flaunts a fake smile when his eyes meet mine.

“They’re not taking anyone in tonight. New town law apparently, nothing they can do. Obviously they’re trying to stomp any tourism around the Reap but there’s probably hundreds of completely empty rooms up there! It’s absolutely ridiculous. We’re residents. Taxpayers”

“It’s fine, man. Thank you for trying. I’ll find a place to hole up. Did you see Katie’s here?” 

“Kate Hodges? Your ex?”

“Yeah she’s staying here in the hotel.” 

“Well how did she get a damn room?” 

“Her little sister is being offered in the Reap.” 

“Oh, shit. And she came back to… witness it?”

“Yeah,” I sigh. “Or say goodbye probably, I guess. I don’t know.” 

“Terrible fate, that.” He finally takes a seat in the chair she’d just been in a moment ago, and lowers the tone of his voice to its normal volume. “I get why you ran, Dante. With the Reap being tomorrow… Must bring back unpleasant memories of your dad. But the only way out of Burningtown is with their permission. You know that.” 

“Mom’s not gonna let me stay at home.” 

“I know, so you’ll come stay with me and Shelby." 

“Great. She’s gonna have a new reason to hate me.” 

“You’re family, Dante. We’re not leaving you in the dark tonight, of all nights.” 


“Is it safe to walk home right now? The fog is–” 

“We can’t stay here. The receptionist threatened to call the cops… It’ll be fine. It’s just like any other night.” 

And so we walk into the misty darkness. Steady rain showers my hair and thunder crackles down from the mountain in the center of town.  The streetlights do little to illuminate our path. The fog doesn’t break. I look down the sidewalk and  hear a loud bang, followed by a defiant yell. Landon and I are both quick to jump into action. We make our way toward the alley where the sounds came from. I stop quickly when I can finally see the wild sight ahead of me. 

A body is fully skinned, revealing bones and organs with several baseball sized bites along its left side. A pile of their skin that has been rolled and stretched into a rope, neatly placed beside the body like soft serve ice cream. The stench is unlike anything I could even imagine. There are hints of rust and rot atop the overwhelming smell of the eviscerated body. I screech, I gag, I cry, and eventually I run. I run as far as I can in the opposite direction. I hear Landon shouting after me beyond the thick layers of silver mist. 

 Landon’s face appears in the fog before the rest of him churns through. But when I turn to look around, three others. They’re wearing gas masks and ponchos, carrying with them what appears to be a firehose. The shorter one in the back puts their hand on my shoulder and removes her mask. 

“Katie?” 

“Hello again, D.” She calmly exclaims while Landon backs away into a brick wall. “It’s okay, we aren’t gonna hurt you.” She says to him, but notices his gaze locked somewhere else. About fifty stories high, the mist swirls rapidly around a dozen Beasts encircling our position. Their leathery wet skin crunches as they very slowly float down around us. Katie puts her mask back on and latches onto the hose. “Everything’s gonna be alright.” She explains as the gurgling hum the Beasts emit grows louder, grows closer, blocking out the stars.  I count ten, maybe eleven of them.

Landon still hasn’t moved from the wall despite aggressive motioning from Katie and I. He just stands there, hands against the bricks, murmuring to himself as he watches the Beasts continue to descend.  They halt before hitting the ground, levitating a few feet above it, putting them at eye level. One of them wanders off from their tightening circle, focusing its attention on Landon. I hear Katie and one of the other gas masked people curse quietly, realizing they’re already too late.

They hold me back while it happens. They rip his skin off slowly, starting with his legs. In one moment of sober clarity, he makes eye contact with me. I see the terror behind his eyes and scream until I can’t hear anything. But I see him mouth the words,

“Tell… Shelby.” They crack his spine as they make their way up his body, morphing in and out of being creatures with discernible, animal-like qualities  and being one transcendent cheese grater for Landon’s body.

This is all my fault. I’m so sorry. I should’ve known. I should’ve known. God knows I should’ve known.
