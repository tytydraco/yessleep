I have written dozens, if not hundreds, of horror stories on the **nosleep** forum. Every night, I sit in front of my computer screen, typing cold words on the keyboard, creating nightmares from the darkest ideas in my head. I enjoy the feeling when my readers send messages saying they can’t sleep after reading my posts. But this time, everything has gone too far.

The story began simply, as always. I thought of a new idea—a **nosleep** writer discovering that what he writes starts to come true. I wrote every detail with the familiar confidence and passion. My main character, David, is a part-time writer living in a cramped apartment in the suburbs. David takes pride in his writing skills, but real life isn’t what he expected. No one besides his friends on the forum knows about him.

I began writing about the strange events David starts to experience. Odd noises at night, dark shadows flickering at the corner of his eye, and the cold feeling when he’s alone in the apartment. Things gradually worsened as David realized that the things he wrote in his story were beginning to become real.

But then, just as I finished the post and hit "publish," everything in my room suddenly went dark. The room lights flickered a few times before going out completely. I felt a cold draft running down my spine. I tried to calm myself, thinking it was just a coincidence, but the unease continued to rise.

And then, the knocking began.

The knocking wasn’t loud, just a gentle sound, as if someone was tapping with their fingertips. I lived alone, and no one would come to visit me at this hour. My heart began to race, and I couldn’t stop thinking about the story I had just written. In it, David also hears a similar knock at night, and when he opens the door, no one is standing there.

I stood frozen in front of the door. The knocking continued, steady and persistent. I didn’t want to open the door, but curiosity, mixed with a sense of dread, urged me to move closer.

I gently turned the doorknob, cracking it open just a little. Outside was a dark hallway, empty. I shut my eyes, breathing a sigh of relief, reassuring myself that it was just a trick of the imagination.

But then I saw it—a small streak of blood, right in front of the door.

Blood. The streak led across the floor, directly into my apartment. I suddenly realized that this was the scene I had written in my story, when David discovered the blood leading to the bedroom.

I slammed the door shut, trying to convince myself that it was just a coincidence, just a bizarre occurrence. But the truth was becoming increasingly undeniable.

Everything I wrote was becoming real.

I rushed back to my room, turned on my computer, my hands trembling as I tried to delete the post. But when I pressed the "delete" button, the screen suddenly flickered, and then a line of text appeared on the screen, typing itself as if someone was controlling it:

**“This story isn’t over. You can’t escape it.”**

I jumped back from the keyboard. No way. Was I hallucinating? Fear engulfed me, my heart racing faster with each beat. For a moment, I glanced back at the room door, and I suddenly realized the blood had vanished.

I sat down in my chair, trying to take a deep breath, but my heart continued to race. Maybe I needed to rest, I told myself, but I couldn’t deny that everything had unfolded like a terrifying dream—a dream I couldn’t escape from.

That night, I couldn’t sleep at all. I heard strange noises, whispers echoing from afar, and then the knocking came again. But this time, I didn’t dare to open the door. I curled up in the corner of the room, clutching my phone tightly, my eyes glued to the door. I didn’t know what to do, and I didn’t know what would happen next.

The next day, when I woke up, I discovered something even more horrifying. On the living room wall, right beside the door, was a line of text etched into the white paint. The letters were neat and sharp, as if someone had deliberately written them.

**“Everything is just beginning.”**

My hands trembled as I touched the writing, and I realized that the story had spiraled beyond my control. It was no longer just a story; it was reality—a reality I couldn’t change or escape.

The following days became an endless nightmare. I realized that every time I edited or added anything to the story, similar events would occur soon after in real life. Strange noises, bizarre figures, the feeling of being watched—all worsened each day.

I tried to delete the post numerous times, but it was futile. Even when I attempted not to think about the story anymore, the strange phenomena wouldn’t stop. I lost sleep, my nerves frayed, and gradually, I could no longer distinguish reality from fiction. I realized I was no longer the one writing this story; it was the story that was writing my fate.

And then, one night, when I had no strength left to resist or run, I heard the knocking one last time. I knew it wasn’t a hallucination; it wasn’t my imagination. I approached the door, my heart pounding, and opened it.

In the hallway, no one was there, but on the ground, a small book lay right in front of the door. I picked it up, and when I opened it, I realized it was a diary—David’s diary, the character I had created.

The pages were blank, but the last line appeared clearly:

**“The story is over. And now, you will be the next.”**


I stood frozen before the words in the diary, my whole body numb, unable to believe my eyes. How could this be? I was the one who wrote this story; everything was just my imagination. But now, every word I wrote was turning into reality, pulling me into an endless vortex of fear and despair.

The days that followed became a series of unending nightmares. My apartment felt haunted; every dark corner seemed to harbor something lurking, waiting. I didn’t dare look in the mirror, didn’t dare go outside at night, and I even feared my own shadow. I was no longer myself. The story I wrote consumed me, turning me into a puppet in the very world I had created.

One evening, when fear had peaked, I decided to end it all. I sat in front of my computer, my hands trembling but determined. I would write an ending for this story, a permanent conclusion to escape the nightmare. I would write about David’s death, the main character, and with that, everything would come to an end. No more strange occurrences, no more terrifying noises. I would close this door myself.

But as my fingers touched the keyboard, the screen suddenly went dark. The whole room fell into darkness. My heart felt like it was about to stop, and before I could do anything, my room door swung open, accompanied by a cold gust of air rushing in.

I stood up, trying to see into the darkness, but I couldn’t see anything. Then I heard it—the slow, steady footsteps approaching me. The footsteps were not mine; they belonged to someone else, or... something else.

I felt its presence right behind me. The cold, heavy air enveloped me. A soft voice whispered, like a breath in my ear:

**“No one escapes their own story.”**

I spun around, but there was nothing. The room was empty, just me and the night. But I knew, I was no longer alone. The story had become reality, and I—just like David—was no longer the author. I was merely a character in the very story I had written.

I tried to run, but all my efforts were in vain. The door, the windows, everything was locked tight. I was trapped, and my story continued to write itself, line by line...

The next morning, when the police broke down the door to my apartment, they found only an empty room. No signs of life, just a computer screen still glowing, displaying one final message:

**“The story is over. And the last character... has vanished.”**


And then, there was only silence...
