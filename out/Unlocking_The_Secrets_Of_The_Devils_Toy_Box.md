 In 2014, a new and peculiar addition was reportedly introduced to draw in curious thrill-seekers. Disguised as an unassuming, dilapidated shack, this structure concealed a truly bizarre interior. Within its walls, visitors were confronted with a room entirely lined with mirrors, strategically positioned to reflect endlessly upon one another.

  
The origins and original intent behind this curious installation remain unclear, but the lore suggests it was inspired by the unsettling imagery of the Clive Barker "Hellraiser" films. Inexplicable and unsettling occurrences allegedly began to plague the site, leading it to earn the ominous moniker of "The Devil's Toy Box."

 Visitors have reported experiencing nausea, headaches, trembling, dizziness, muscle pain, visual and auditory hallucinations, and even seizures.

The longest recorded stay was by a 52-year-old father of three named Roger Heltz, who managed to endure for an astounding four minutes and thirty-seven seconds.

  
 However, his experience left him in a morose, nearly vegetative state, unable to speak. This chilling detail has only added to the mystique and unease surrounding the Devil's Toy Box.

  
The origins and purpose of this peculiar installation remain shrouded in mystery. Some speculate it was inspired by the unsettling imagery of the "Hellraiser" films, while others believe it may have been an ill-conceived attempt to create a unique haunted attraction.

  
 Regardless of its initial intent, the Devil's Toy Box has evolved into a captivating and disturbing urban legend, one that continues to draw the curious and the brave, eager to uncover the truth behind its haunting effects.
