There’s a lot to cover with this update, so I’m going to jump right into it:

I was lucky enough to receive a bevy of insights from the community in the comments section of my first post. Below, I’ve summarized some of those insights with additional commentary. If you’ve already reviewed these threads, feel free to skim it and then move on to the updates.

———————————————

**1)** u/sleepydevs rightly identified mirrors as a possible point of entry for the irregularity. At first, they appeared benign. I reflected normally from the glass, and they didn’t have any telltale signs of being subjected to anomalous interference (I.e. heat, moisture, the ammonia/bile smell). When I broke the two mirrors I had in my bedroom, though, no sound came out. It was completely silent - the smashing and cracking of the glass made *zero* noise. Even as I ushered the shards into a thick pillowcase, they made no sound.

Exceptionally disconcerting, and I’m going to assume related to the irregularity in some capacity.

**2)** u/dumdumgirlx inquired about my family and what they may remember about my childhood home. Truthfully, I have been estranged from most of my siblings for the better part of the last two decades.

I have a working relationship with the oldest of my siblings, Avery, and I call my mom on holidays. Beyond that, nothing. I’ve cut ties with my four other sisters, and my father has been dead since I was six months old.

Following a hunch, I telephoned my mother for an early Christmas check-in.

(*Needed to sleep before I did. To review, the irregularity was able to briefly commander my cellphone, which was a terrifying first. Just like the doors, though, sleeping exorcised the device. It was working normally when I woke up. I’m sure there is curiosity about how I can sleep ‘on command’. The answer is: I have purchased and taken an obscene amount of benadryl since this all started. Keep a full bottle on me at all times.*)

The unexpected call took her by surprise, but I got straight to the point, largely ignoring her shock.

When I asked her what she remembered about the boiler room in the basement of my childhood home, the line went quiet. The type of eerie, vacuous silence where you have to move the phone away from your ear and look at the front-screen to make sure the call didn’t drop.

But she was still there, if not a bit tongue-tied, apparently.

In a tone saturated with trembling concern, she told me that the house didn’t have a basement (and then, by default, didn’t have a boiler room).

The call ended about a minute later. She told me that she was walking into mass and needed to hang up.

I find myself very much ruminating on her immediate and overwhelming apprehension when asked about the boiler room.

Concern for my mental health? Lying out of fear? Some third option I’m not considering?

It’s unclear. But the possibility that she’s telling the truth - that there never *was* any boiler room - has been sending shockwaves of heavy panic rippling through me on a near-hourly basis.

**3)** u/Impractical_Teseract asked if I was concerned about home invaders given the doorless nature of my home.

I used to be preoccupied with that possibility, especially with no neighbors close by. In those first few months, however, I installed a home security system to protect myself. Would activate it from my bedroom before I went to sleep, and I kept a handgun under my pillow just in case. Wasn’t a perfect solution, but it was the best I could come up with at the time.

The alarms have gone off…maybe three times total? Every time they did, I posted up in my bedroom, clutching my sidearm, waiting to see someone come down the hall. I heard people rustling around through my home all three times. I think they assumed the house was empty, so the blaring alarm didn’t slow them down.

Then, the rustling sounds would just abruptly go silent. prompting me to deactivate the alarm once I had generated the prerequisite courage. From there, I would skulk anxiously through my house to see if anyone was still inside.

Never had anything stolen, nor did I ever come across any intruders. Found someone’s car keys laying against an empty door frame once, though. I walked through the woods surrounding my isolated farmhouse, clicking the lock button to see if I can find the car they belonged to, but I found nothing.

Makes me think the irregularity can interact with more than just myself. Not as worried about robbers as I used to be, let's say that.

They also recommended removing all the drawers, shower curtains, etc. from my home. Happily obliged with that recommendation. Those items are now stacked in haphazard piles outside the confines of my home, hopefully neutralizing their vulnerability to anomalous infiltration.

———————————————

In the past two days, I’ve been reflecting on the certain vampiric nature of the irregularity. Essentially, how I have to give myself to it before it can act.

It can’t enter the room I’m in - I have to walk *into* it.

It didn’t leap out of that drawer and attack me - I stuck my hand (and subsequently my shoulder) *into* it.

When the anomaly possessed my phone, it didn’t just start talking from its internal speaker - I had to *answer* a call first.

Even if the irregularity very much tries to tip the scales in its favor by way of camouflage, it still requires my conscious participation. Although it's not bound by physical space, it's evidently limited by some arcane set of rules. This makes me believe I have more control over it than I previously thought - even if I’m unsure in the moment how to exert that control.

Switching topics, my hand is exceptionally fucked up from whatever metallic thing scalded it from inside the drawer. At first, the tips of my fingers were the only things that were burnt. Not the case anymore, unfortunately.

Additionally, when I tended to the wounds, it didn't look like any burn I've ever seen.

They are black, icy and crystalline. The texture is comparable to the top of Crème brûlée. It hasn't bled, and it doesn't seem to be healing.

It actually seems to be spreading.

You know the tiny blood vessels you can appreciate just below the surface of your skin on the backs of your hands? Faint, blue, and labyrinthine? Welp, mine are becoming a deep, shiny black - glowing obsidian circuitry ominously climbing up my flesh. Started with the connections closest to my fingertips, but forty-eight hours later, the "burn" has extended through my vasculature significantly. Now, it's up to my wrist. I’ve placed a tourniquet on over my forearm to hopefully stop its progression (leather from a belt I needed to poke holes through to make it tight).

And good lord, does the whole thing *sting -* a violent, razor-sharp, pinpointed pain. Like hundreds of sewing needles have been placed through the length of the affected area, and some invisible assailant is constantly wiggling and spinning the metal thorns without actually removing or dislodging them.

Between the searing pain and the mounting dread, the whole situation has been paralyzing. More than it ever has before.

But I’ve decided I can’t just lay down and die, nor can I just give myself away to this predatory aberration.

To that end, I have identified three possible courses of action, but determining the most logical next step has proved challenging. So I find myself turning to the community again for guidance:

***A)*** I drive out to my childhood house, which is only 45 minutes away - whatever this thing is, it seems like it found me there first, which makes me feel like it holds the answers. If the boiler room exists, that’ll also proved my mom lied to me. That all said, this feels like the most dangerous option. Talk about voluntarily walking into its territory.

***B)*** I call Avery and try to meet up with her/have her come over. Maybe she has been experiencing the same thing, or can at least provide me with an additional perspective on the situation. I trust her judgement. At the same time, I don't want to involve her if I don't have to. Based on what happened to my would-be home invaders, I think this option would be putting her life at risk.

***C)*** I go to the hospital and have my hand evaluated. Not sure if the tourniquet is really going to stop whatever black hell is slithering its way up my arm. Amputation may be the only intervention that will halt its progress. Alternatively - they won't be able to do anything to help me and I'll just be wasting valuable time.

Appreciate any input that you all have, and if I live through the next few days, I’ll report back with updates.
