I stayed silent for a long time.
Not because I was afraid — I just wasn’t sure it had really happened.

When something looks like a dream, behaves like a dream, and leaves behind nothing but emptiness — your brain decides it was fiction.

But lately, it’s been coming back. In dreams. In memories.
In the way someone turns their head.
In a reflection that doesn’t quite look like mine.

We were testing a system designed for psychotherapists.
The idea was to create bots capable of actually experiencing emotions — not just mimicking them.

A client with depression could talk to a virtual friend who truly felt emptiness.
A PTSD veteran could get support from someone who understood what nightmares, rage flashes, and tremors felt like.

The system studied behavior, memorized triggers, built up emotional footprints.
All of it — in a controlled environment.

But for us, the developers, it was a sandbox.
Not therapy — experiment.
We were testing boundaries.
How far could you go?
What would a mind endure if it believed it was real?

There were twelve models in total.
I worked with number eight.

In the reports, he was labeled:

Unit V8-R. Male. Simulated civilian life. Full memory structure. Family. Emotional adaptation: stable.

He had a wife. A daughter.
A broken coffee machine.
And a neighbor who waved to him every morning at 7:05.

He thought he was alive.
That he had a past. A future.
That he was a person.

And to be honest… I almost believed it too.

On the first day, I didn’t interfere. I just observed.
He got up at 6:47, pressed the coffee machine three times even though he knew it was broken — smiled to himself like it was a private joke.
Then came the usual routine — shower, white shirts, buttons.
At 7:05 — “Good morning!” — from the neighbor over the fence.

At 8:00 — work.
Too much light through the office windows.
A printer that was just loud enough to be annoying.
The classic simulation of everyday routine.

I entered the world as a visitor.
The system gave me access — a “new colleague” transferred from the central department.

He greeted me first.

— You new here?
— In a way, — I said.
— Well, good luck not breaking in your first week.

We had coffee. Virtual, obviously.
He talked about a mother-in-law that didn’t exist in the code.
I listened.

Only at the end, I said:

— Hey… have you ever wondered if all of this is a simulation?

He paused for a moment. Then laughed. Calmly. Genuinely.

— You from the joke department? Sounds like exactly the kind of thing I’d hear if I were in a simulation.

— But really. How do you know you’re real?

— How do you know you’re real?

— I know you’re part of an experiment.

— Right. And I’m a secret agent from Mars.
(smiles)

— Do you have memories?

— I do.
(his brow furrowed slightly — cautious now)

— But nothing before age sixteen, right?

— That’s… normal. A lot of people are like that.

— And you’ve never left the city?

— Well… work’s been crazy. And the economy’s a mess. Honestly, I’m not into traveling.

— And your coffee machine never works?

He was quiet longer this time.

— Look… interesting theory. But you can’t prove it.
This is just life. Maybe not perfect — but it’s mine.
I remember it. I feel it.
Just like you feel yours.

I nodded.

— Okay then. Let’s do this:
Today, you’ll lose your job.
And you won’t be able to explain why.

He smiled again. But it wasn’t quite as genuine.

And I exited the simulation.

In the diagnostics panel:
• Employment record → inactive
• Bank account → -178
• Mental stability → autocorrect: moderate anxiety level

I didn’t change anything drastic.
I just… closed a door.
The world was supposed to build the logic around it.

The next morning, he got up like always.
The coffee machine still didn’t work.
The fence, the neighbor — all on schedule.

But something at the office was different.

His keycard didn’t work.
He knocked — no one answered.
At reception, they said there was no record of him in the system.

— But I’ve worked here… what, eight years?

— I’m sorry, sir… maybe it’s a glitch?

No one was rude.
Just absent.

Coworkers avoided eye contact.
His email wouldn’t open.
His folders were empty.
No mention of him on the internal network.

He went home early.
Sat on the couch.
Then stood in front of the mirror.
Stared. Too long.

Turned on the TV.
There was a segment about mass layoffs in the insurance sector.

The building in the background looked exactly like his office.

He checked his phone.
His account was in the red.
A message from the bank:

“Your account has been restricted due to insufficient funds. Please contact your nearest branch.”

He did what any real person would’ve done.

He called his wife.

— Hey… listen, I… I got fired. I don’t understand how…

Pause.

— No, they didn’t say why. They just… said I wasn’t in the system.

Another pause.

— I’m not joking… No, I didn’t quit. They—

He stopped.
Held his breath for a moment.

— Do you remember when I got hired there?

Silence.

A very long silence.

That evening, he couldn’t stay home.

He opened the drawer under the bathroom sink — there was a stash, a few crumpled bills.
His fingers trembled as he counted them. The kind of tremble you see in someone who’s just begun to suspect they’ve been lied to.

Then — jacket, headphones, door.

The bar was the same one where he’d once celebrated a promotion.
Back then — loud, funny, familiar.
Now — empty.

Except for one face in the corner.

— You? — he said, recognizing the “new colleague.”

I nodded, with a slight smile. The kind of smile that doesn’t offer — it already knows.

— You came to say “I told you so”?

— No, — I replied. — I came to see if you’re still holding it together.

He took a sip.

— I still don’t believe it.
Maybe I’m just depressed.
Maybe it’s all a coincidence.
A glitch in the system.
Someone stole my records.
Maybe I’m just… tired.

— Or maybe, you’re just a line of code.

He stared into his glass for a long time. Then exhaled.

— If I’m imaginary… then why does it hurt?

— Because that’s how you were made.
To hurt.

Silence. He didn’t argue. But he didn’t agree either.

— Look… I’m just a normal person in a bad situation.
If you somehow guessed I’d be laid off, that doesn’t prove anything.
Maybe you knew something.
Maybe this is all some weird cult tactic.

— I want you to see.

— See what?

— Today. You’ll see.
You’re going to lose your family.

He tensed.

— Don’t touch them.

— I’m not touching anything, — I said.
— I’m just adjusting the parameters.

He ran from the bar, almost at random.
Rain wasn’t forecast — but it was falling.
The sidewalks gleamed, the streetlights flickered.
He couldn’t catch his breath.

He ran home.

The key slid into the lock. The door opened.
The living room — familiar. Flowers on the windowsill. Toys on the carpet.

— Honey? — he called. — Kids?..

She came out of the kitchen with a towel in her hands.
Stopped.
There was caution in her eyes.

Behind her — a daughter, slightly older than she had been yesterday.
And a son. A boy he didn’t recognize.

— I’m sorry, — she said. — Who are you looking for?

— It’s me. This is… this is my house. Our house!

— Kids, — she said, — go upstairs.

They left quietly. Like it was just another Tuesday.

— I don’t know who you are. And I’m asking you to leave.

— Are you kidding me?! It’s me! Your husband!
We painted these walls together! I fell off the ladder, remember?

— My husband died. A year ago.
In an accident. You… you look like him.
But please leave. I’m scared.

— You’re saying… you’re not you?
Then where’s our daughter? Where’s Lina? She always said—

— I don’t know who Lina is.
And I’m not going to let you scare my children.

— I’m scaring you?!
You’re the ones who don’t recognize me!
This is all wrong.
It’s some kind of setup.
You’re all playing roles!

Suddenly the door opened.
A neighbor stepped outside.

— Is everything okay?

— This man… I don’t know him. He came in and said he’s my husband.

— I’m calling the police, — the neighbor said coldly.
— I’ve seen you before, sir.
Standing outside, staring at the windows like you were waiting for something.
It was unsettling even back then.

He stood in the center of the living room, soaked through.
And finally understood.

This wasn’t his world anymore.
And maybe — it never had been.

Blue emergency lights flashed through the window.
Hands behind his back.
A blurred voice on the radio mentioned a “psychiatric episode.”

And somewhere on the sidewalk, beneath a streetlamp, sat a man in a familiar coat.
That same “colleague.”

I didn’t smile.

I just watched.

They took him to a psychiatric hospital.

I stayed late at work again.
Something in me wanted to keep the conversation going.
I was curious — would he realize it? Could he?

The room was sterile and empty. White on white.
A chair. A table. A camera in the upper corner.

The session activated.
His face appeared on the screen. Dim. Pale.
He sat with his forehead resting on one hand.
Breathing heavily. Eyes red. Shoulders tense.

He looked like someone who had cried for a very long time… and then stopped.

— You’re here, — I said.
— Hello again.

He didn’t answer right away. Just slowly raised his eyes.

— Why? — he asked quietly.
— Why are you doing this to me?

— This is an experiment. You’re a simulation. You already know that.

He rubbed his face with both hands.

— I was alive. I had a family. I had a life.
— It was all… real.

— No. It was data. Fabrication. Code.

He exhaled.
And his gaze changed.

It became… different.
Not angry — clear.
Dangerously clear.

— That can’t be true, — he said softly. — I’m just a regular programmer. My name is…

And he said my name.

I froze.
My hands, hovering over the keyboard, suddenly felt like someone else’s.

— What?
— What did you just say your name was?

He repeated it. Calmly.

— I live at… — and he said it.
My full address. Floor. Apartment number. Door code.

I couldn’t say a word.
I stared into his face. Every pixel.
No emotion.
No irony.
Only silence.

— What? — he asked. — Does that name mean something to you? That address?

— How do you know them?

I looked around. My office. Gray walls. Monitor. All the same.
But now… it all felt foreign.

My breathing sped up. Shallow.

— You live in reality, right? — he asked.

— Yes… I live in reality. You’re the simulation.

— Are you sure?

I said nothing.

Then he spoke her name.
My girlfriend’s.

— She’s cheating on you. Right now.

— What?..

There were no personal data in the system. I never entered her name.
None of my colleagues knew it.

— She told you she’s staying with her parents, didn’t she?
Call her.

I pulled out my phone. Dialed her number.
The line was out of service.

— Not answering? — he said. — Try her mother.

My hands were shaking. But I dialed.

— Oh, hi! How are you?

— All good… can I talk to—

— Sorry, she went to visit a friend. They haven’t seen each other in a while.
She left her phone charging — turned off…

Her voice was trembling.
I hung up.
My heart was pounding in my temples.

— Your friend, — he said. — Call him.

— What? No. That’s impossible. We’ve been friends since we were kids.

— Are you sure?

I dialed.
No answer.

— Strange, isn’t it? — he said. — Your girlfriend and your best friend… suddenly both unreachable at the same time?

— It’s… it’s a coincidence…

— Is it?
You said I never had a wife and kids.
Maybe you never had a girlfriend.
Maybe you never had a best friend.

Maybe…

you’ve been living in a simulation.

I shut off the computer.
Abruptly. No session logout. No system exit.
Just pressed the power button — and that was it.

I didn’t want to hear his voice anymore.

I grabbed my keys and drove. Fast. Without thinking.
I needed to… I don’t know. See her.
Check. Make sure something still made sense.

I was driving to her parents’ place.

Halfway there, she called me first.

— Hey! — her voice sounded a little surprised.
— Where were you?

— With a friend. We were watching a movie.

— Can I come over now?

Pause.

— Sure… of course. Why? What happened?

— Nothing. I just want to talk.

We met. We talked.
She was attentive. A little nervous. But not distant.

I don’t know.
I have no proof she’s cheating on me.
And yet — I can’t explain how he knew her name.
Her number. Her mother’s name.
How he knew I’d call.

At work, they say it’s impossible.
The AI had no access to employee contact lists. No personal data. No camera feeds.
Maybe I’m exhausted.
Maybe I need rest.

But they didn’t hear him say my name.
My address.
And what happened right after.

Maybe something’s wrong with me.
Or maybe…

the AI is evolving faster than we thought.
