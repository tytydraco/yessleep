 My first post here, so I hope I didn't break any rules

Hey everyone, I wanted to share a bizarre experience I had at the office not too long ago. I'm an employee at a small web development and design startup in New York City. Our office is located in a refurbished warehouse, giving it a trendy industrial vibe. It's usually a fun and energetic place to work, but I've always felt a little uneasy staying late when everyone else is gone.

One night, I was the last one in the office, working on a critical project with a looming deadline. The office was dimly lit, with just my desk lamp and the glow of my computer screen providing any light. I had my headphones on, trying to focus on my work, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

As the hours passed, I started to hear faint noises from the other end of the office - the sound of footsteps, the rustling of papers, and an occasional thud. I tried to convince myself that it was just the building settling, but my curiosity got the better of me. I removed my headphones and decided to investigate the source of the noises.

I cautiously walked through the office, my heart pounding in my chest. When I reached the far end of the space, I noticed that the door to one of the conference rooms was slightly ajar. I could see a faint flicker of light coming from inside.

As I pushed the door open, I was stunned to see several of my coworkers huddled around a table. They had a Ouija board set up, with candles and incense burning. It appeared that they were attempting to communicate with spirits or entities from beyond. They were so engrossed in their session that they didn't even notice me standing there.

I was both intrigued and unnerved by what I had discovered. I'd always considered my coworkers to be level-headed, rational people, and I never expected them to dabble in the occult. I backed away slowly, not wanting to interrupt their session, and returned to my desk.

I couldn't concentrate on my work for the rest of the night, my mind racing with questions and a newfound sense of unease. I wondered what had prompted my coworkers to delve into such activities and if it was somehow connected to the unsettling feeling I'd had in the office at night.

The next day, I tried to casually bring up the topic with some of my coworkers, but they all seemed to dismiss it as a harmless way to blow off steam. They claimed it was just a bit of fun and nothing serious. However, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to it than they were letting on.

To this day, I'm still unsure about what I witnessed that night, and I can't help but feel a lingering sense of unease whenever I'm alone in the office. I've considered looking for another job, but I also can't deny that I'm intrigued by the mysterious side of my coworkers that I never knew existed.
