A few months ago, I moved into a quaint little house on the outskirts of town. It’s one of those old places with creaky floors and a history that you can almost feel in the air. I’d been looking for a quiet place to work on my writing, and this house seemed perfect. Little did I know, it would come with its own set of eerie experiences.

The first sign that something was off happened on a quiet night. I was sitting at my desk, typing away, when my phone rang. The number on the screen was my own. I stared at it in disbelief, expecting it to be some sort of prank or glitch. I hesitated but answered anyway.

“Hello?”

There was silence on the other end. I was about to hang up when I heard a faint, whispering voice. It wasn’t clear enough to make out words, but it was definitely there. The call lasted only a minute before it disconnected on its own. I brushed it off as a fluke—maybe a misdial or a bad connection.

The next few days were uneventful, but the calls kept coming. At first, it was just a couple of times a week. Then it started happening every night. Always at midnight. Always from my own number. Each time, I’d answer, and each time, the same eerie whispering would follow. I tried blocking the number, but it didn’t help. The calls continued, sometimes multiple times a night.

I decided to dig into the history of the house, hoping to find some explanation. The previous owner was an elderly woman who had passed away in her sleep, and that was all I could find. I even asked around the neighborhood, but no one knew anything unusual about the place.

One night, I got fed up. I decided to stay up and wait for the call. Midnight came, and my phone rang. I answered it immediately, and this time, I demanded to know who was calling me.

The whispering was more intense than usual. It felt like it was coming from all around me. I heard what sounded like a muffled scream before the line went dead. I was shaken, but I tried to stay calm. I thought about calling the police but decided against it. After all, there was no tangible evidence of anything wrong.

That night, I went to bed early, hoping that if I ignored the problem, it might go away. I fell asleep on the couch in my living room, exhausted. I woke up to the sound of my phone ringing. It was just past midnight. My phone was lying next to me on the coffee table. I picked it up, and to my horror, the screen displayed an image of myself sleeping on the couch—taken from an angle that I hadn’t seen before.

I bolted upright, heart racing. I checked my surroundings, but there was no one there. My phone’s camera roll showed nothing out of the ordinary, just the usual photos I had taken.

But then, the phone rang again. This time, the caller ID showed my own number, but the call was from inside the house. My heart pounded in my chest as I answered.

“Hello?”

A distorted voice on the other end said, “I’ve been waiting for you.”

I glanced around the room, and that’s when I noticed something chilling. The house, which I thought was empty, had shadows moving against the walls. They were not just shadows but silhouettes of people—dark, featureless figures, as if they were watching me.

The line went dead. I tried calling back, but my phone wouldn’t connect. Desperate, I grabbed my flashlight and searched the house. Every room was empty, but the oppressive feeling grew stronger.

In the dead of night, I heard footsteps echoing through the house, getting louder and closer. I followed the sounds, my flashlight shaking in my hand. They led me to the basement door—a place I had never dared to explore. I opened the door, and the stench of decay hit me.

The basement was filled with old furniture, dust-covered boxes, and forgotten relics. But in the corner, I found an old, cracked mirror. Its surface was smeared, and as I wiped it clean, I saw something that made my blood run cold: a message scrawled in what looked like red ink.

“YOU ARE MINE.”

Suddenly, the basement lights flickered, and the temperature dropped. My phone buzzed in my hand. I looked at the screen, and the message was horrifying: a live feed of me standing in the basement, but with something standing behind me.

I spun around, but there was nothing there. The darkness seemed to pulse with a life of its own. I bolted out of the basement and fled the house, never looking back. I stayed with friends and tried to forget the nightmare.

Weeks later, I got a message from a blocked number. It was a photo of my new place, taken from outside, with the caption, “I’m waiting for you.”

I moved again, but every time I get a new phone, the same thing happens: the calls start coming in, always at midnight, from my own number. I’ve learned that some places carry more than just memories—they hold something else, waiting for its next victim. And no matter where I go, I’m never truly alone.
