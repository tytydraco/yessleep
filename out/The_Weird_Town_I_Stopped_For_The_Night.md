Ok, It has been 3 days since I returned home and as of writing this, I am still trying to understand what just happened in that town. For context, I just arrived back home after a 18 hour trip from Chicago to Pasadena, and this thing happened in the middle of Kansas.

I'm going to start from the beginning so you all can understand what just happened that made me this exasperated. I just wanted to tell you this story even though you'll think this is not real or something a lunatic will make up. I just need a place to share this weird event that happened a couple of nights ago, and let this entire thing off my chest.

This story starts when I was midway through driving in the middle of a small highway that runs in two lanes through the state of Kansas just several miles south of I-70. I actually went to Chicago to visit my family back home after what felt like a year of not seeing my family back home, and now I'm heading back home and getting back to work after the next week.

When I looked at the GPS, I saw that the I-70 is heading towards Colorado, specifically at Denver and the Rockies. I thought that it would take me ages just to return back south, or maybe this route would lead me to Utah instead of actually going to Nevada. I decided to take this small highway that bypasses Denver and cut through to Albuquerque instead. After all, it will take me hours to go South once I'm in Colorado. It was a straight shot back to LA, or at least, close to it for the most part.

When I was in the middle of this quiet highway, my eyes began to slowly droop. My eyes slowly try to shut itself as I drive the straight highway. The road was completely flat during my time driving in Kansas, and it was nothing but fields after fields and occasionally some rolling hills and passing cars. So yeah, this was the pretty boring part of the drive; and this part is making my eyes drop. With nothing interesting in sight for this evening drive. It was at this moment I told myself that I needed to find a place to stop for the night, I was just way too tired to actually drive straight on these Kansas highways that never ends.

I drove for I think a couple more minutes before I saw a sign. It was a town named "Burton". It was only around 12 miles from where the sign was, it was pretty close. So, I decided to follow the directions on the highway sign, expecting it might be a small town or even a decently sized city; maybe, I can probably walk around when I wake up before I leave.

Eventually, around 6:34 PM, I arrived. The horizon filled with the lights of the city ahead of me. It's about time for me to take a pause on my long journey and check in for a place to stay for the night.

As I arrived, I began to see the glow of lights ahead. Grocery stores, restaurants, and even a roadside casino on the side of the highway. There was a Holiday Inn by the highway, but I don't think I can waste my money on one of those places. One time I checked in there, I nearly lost a lot of money just trying to check in one time on a different night when I was heading to Vegas. I learned my lesson to finally not take it at face value 

I also found a roadside motel within this highway. I drove by next to it and I saw the parking lot inside of it. The entire parking lot was filled with construction vehicles; some looked like they drove all the way from Missouri judging by the plates. Pickups, big trucks, and some heavy equipment, it seems the place is rented out by some construction crew; it sure is a lot of them. I tried to check in when I arrived at the reception desk in the hotel, and I got an apology as the place was full for the night. 

I continued driving deeper into the town. The highway slowly turned into a smaller main road that spans for just 4 lanes. Burton seemed to be a typical American suburb, nothing crazy, and nothing spectacular. Rows of houses laid down in a grid, occasional business on the side, which means it's easier to retrace my steps if I got lost somehow.

Driving through the main road, the main road apparently led me to downtown, and something caught my eye. The road was closed, and not just roadwork, there were road blocks spanning for several blocks that prevented people from entering that area of the town. 

And it's not just an entire construction either, the local police parked directly behind the barricade, which meant they were blocking something here. The next couple of blocks ahead of it were several trailers, and a sea of cars parked directly within the road ahead. Ok, is there some sort of parade I did not hear about in the GPS? Whatever, it seems to have to find a way somewhere.

I took a slight detour and drove on some of the town's inner roads, minding the sound I make, now approaching the different parts of the town. Eventually, I came across a small motel just before the downtown of this city; Finally, something that isn't completely full. I drove by the parking lot that led directly towards the rooms and parked just by one of the rooms. I took a deep breath and finally stepped out of the truck. I was greeted by the cold breeze of the autumn night blowing towards my face. The weight of the fresh air entering my nostrils as I took a breath after hours of sitting in my truck is just something. 

I began walking towards the reception area of this motel. The hotel is your typical roadside motel with rooms on the ground floor and parking directly in front of the doors. I entered the building before the road, and I was greeted by the receptionist, busy tidying something on his counter.

"Um... Hello?" I muttered a soft greeting, trying to get his attention.

He turned around and looked at me. The man looked like in his early 20s. A young man with a pale complexion. His eyes looked a bit glassy; not from drinking however, but from exhaustion. He briefly glanced at me with a blank look in his eyes, as if I disturbed his work.

"Oh hello there. Welcome to Burton Roadside Inn, where everyone experience the best night. How can I help you?”

His greeting sounded really flat. I don't know what to say about it, honestly, I don't know what to expect really. He takes a good look at me. His eyes run top to bottom, as if he's trying to analyze me or something, or probably he didn't expect me to just walk by and suddenly call to check in. He eventually looked at me directly and I spoke.

"I need a room for the night, is there anything available for the night?" I asked curtly, trying not to sound pushy

The receptionist didn't say a single word as he nodded. He turned around and began reaching for the locker, containing room keys inside. He reached for one at the bottom, shut the locker, and passed me the keys of the room I was staying in: Room 101.

"Your room is at Room 101, supper will be served at 7:00 PM later" He said blankly. "The cafeteria is by the side" he continued as he pointed to the open cafeteria on the opposite side of my room.

"Ok, I'll keep that in mind, thanks"

I grabbed the keys and turned around. I suppose he’s not going to ask if I'm going to pay for tonight's rest but, whatever, I can do it tomorrow. I began to make my way to the room, walking towards the general direction of the rooms themselves. I then asked myself “Did I just not paid this man a single dime?”. I brushed it off, I suppose the room is free now, or maybe I have to pay tomorrow instead.

Before I got there, there was a bulletin board that caught my eye. I decided to take a look at the massive board stuck by the wall. There was a small garage sale on someone's home, a pamphlet on a care home hiring for workers, or just a plain joke pamphlet stuck to it like "If you see this, you are gay". But then there was one big poster that I noticed, or rather, I failed to notice. It was a poster, a big, brown paper highlighting an event that was about to happen at 12 midnight. 12 midnight? What community event would happen at that time that for some reason, this town celebrates? I read the poster and here's what it says

"On Oct 12, It is time for a new year of festivities to celebrate another year of service with the Lady Of The Night. At the time of 12 Midnight, we invited you to attend the annual ceremony in the City Square in Downtown. Go ahead and come on over, we are happy to meet you all to celebrate the night of another year of service."

I continued reading it, and looked down

"There will be:
- Foods
- Services
- Darkness"

After all of that text, all that's left is their logo; a purple ring surrounding a black circle. 

This poster reads like this is some sort of weird activity. What kind of annual celebration would have a festivity that happened during the night? I know towns across America have some weird traditions at times, but this right here takes the cake. I have never seen a ceremony happening dead at night that isn't some house party by some frat boys. I decided to just move on and leave the board, I am getting too tired for this shit.

I entered my room and I was greeted with a surprisingly tidy room. Inside was a king size bed, assuming you're bringing a child, your girlfriend, or perhaps someone you liked for a one night stand, but it's a pretty large bed. Next to it is a lampshade that is too dim for my liking, but hey, it's better than nothing. There's no TV though, which is a shame, but then again, I just wanted a cheap motel to rest in, I suppose it's not needed. The rest of the room are filled with furniture such as cabinets, a closet, and a coat hanger, not bad I guess.

I laid down my bag at the corner and I immediately crashed down the bed. "Finally" I thought to myself. After hours of just driving, I can finally get myself a good night's sleep for the night and maybe, just maybe, I can wake up early and get back onto the road to finally finish the long stretch. That however, will not be easy, my stomach began to grumble in need. I think it was time for me to eat for once, after all, I haven't even eaten a single thing after I stopped by Springfield way back in Illinois. 

I got up and left my room, locking the door along the way. I walked towards the open cafeteria the receptionist pointed towards. I entered the cafeteria, it was a pretty decent sized place to eat with half a dozen tables for me to sit and the counter is on the other end, facing towards the door.

There were only a handful of people eating on their tables. One family sitting next to the entrance and a random old man sitting in between the door and the counter. It seems to be a quiet night here, there's barely anyone in here to talk to. I eventually approached the counter, a server was busy on her phone before she took a brief glimpse up and noticed me standing.

"Can I help you?" The server said in a bored tone. She put her phone in the pocket

"Can I get some strips and some fries?" I said. "And a can of Coke"

"Uh huh..." She murmured, typing on the POS machine "Anything else?"

I said no and eventually paid it upfront. Is everyone in this motel bored or just dead inside? I watched as she nodded at the cooks just behind the partition and immediately, they began to cook my food. She handed me the spoon and fork and I sat at a table and sat there.

As I glance on my surroundings. I noticed that someone was staring at me. I saw a faint shiny glimmer of someone's eye locked towards me behind a window. I saw the eye locked in directly towards me behind the glass, before eventually, the glimmer disappeared into the night. Things are getting more and more interesting it seems.

I began eating, the strips tasted fine, and the fries were just bland; to be expected in a small cafeteria of a small town in the middle of Kansas after all. Everything that has happened so far is just... Interesting to say the least, I don't know if I should be having goosebumps on what is up with the people in this place, or I'm just getting too tired and acting like a crazy idiot thinking everyone is onto me. I finished all of my food, surprisingly ate all of it in less than 15 minutes and left the cafeteria, and went back to my room.

I entered the shower, hopped into its tiled floors and turned the lever on and water began to pour down the showerhead. Thankfully, I decided to actually grab myself some shampoo, as the shampoo bottle they have was empty, it was going to be annoying if there wasn't one. When I finished my shower, my skin finally felt smoother and not drenched in whatever sweat I got myself, especially earlier where I found myself grabbing a different wheel on my rear passenger after it blew up while I was driving on the interstate in Missouri.

I wrapped myself in my tower and walked out of the bathroom. I opened my bag and fetched my clothes inside. It's just a simple black t-shirt with a logo of ACDC, a pretty neat shirt I bought from a thrift store, and then some basic shorts. I donned my shirt and shorts and immediately laid down at my bed. My mind began to wander, my breath quiet as a whisper, I began to shut my eyes for the night, hoping that finally, I can get back on the road early. Although, I'm still not exactly sure what exactly is happening with me. I got so tired driving down the road that I forgot what exactly I was dealing with earlier. Did I forget something? Whatever, I guess I need to sleep it off.

It's not even 4 hours later before I woke up at the sound of knocking at my door. My eyes reluctantly open, still trying to suddenly jolt myself awake from that slumber. I am desperately trying to fully go to sleep for several more hours. I then looked at the doorway and noticed a figure standing by the windows of my room. It stood there for a moment, standing still for what seemed to be minutes. Eventually, he began to walk off, the lights outside pouring once more. I got out of bed, and looked at the front door. I noticed something on the floor, a note written on a piece of paper slid under the door.

I picked the note up and began to try and read it, but it was dark for my eyes to immediately read it. I turned the lampshade on and began reading it.

"Hello stranger, I believe you are inside for a respite. If you are awake for this night, perhaps you can steal yourself to step outside and witness what our High Priestess has offered to us for this night. The ceremony is in the town square if you are interested. Thank you, and may the darkness protect you".

What is this exactly? What sort of emo goth person would write something this pretentious? Is this a prank on me? Am I being awoken by some random person trying to mess with me? I stepped outside and began looking outside to the person that dropped this note. I glanced left and right, however, there was no one there that could've dropped this. What there was however, is other people who stopped by for the night, also receiving this message as well. A man in his forties stepped outside the same time as I did and began to glance towards my direction just as I did for the possible culprit. He then saw me with the same confused expression 

"Hey, do you know who dropped this thing?" He asked, his eyes looking at me

"I don't know," I said. I raised my hand and showed him the note; "I have one too"

"Really? Strange, what does it say?" 

I then read verbatim what the note says.

"Is that right? He quipped 

“Here's what mine said. 'If you are awake for the night, you are blessed to be part of the Harvest for this night's celebration. At midnight, there is a celebration that will happen at the town's square. You can bring your wife with you if you are interested. Thank you, and bless the Lady of the Night"

I was flabbergasted, so now I'm not exactly the only person whoever these people dropped their notes. I watched as others in this motel opened their doors with the same confused face as mine, almost everyone in this motel got a knock, and even got a note from their hands.

"So I'm not the only one?" I muttered quietly

"Well, well, looks like I'm not the only one awoken by the dead. What's going on here in this place exactly?" The man asked, not looking around him, clearly beginning to feel a tinge of terror in his body.

I have a bad feeling something is about to unfold in this place. I don't want to stick around and find out what it is. I already get chills when someone or some group knocks outside our doors but to slide a note under our doors, saying we should attend some sort of activity at the town square of Burton? I also noticed that all of the staff that was sitting around in the reception area in the front desk are no longer there. I'm contemplating the idea of leaving after that stunt alone.

I decided that I shouldn't stick around and find out. I rushed back inside my room and began to pack my bags as quickly as I laid down at my bed. I packed everything I had, and it  doesn't matter if it looks like shit afterwards, I don't want to know what these people I don't see are planning. I began to race back to my truck, placing all of my belongings inside in a rush straight to my backseat.

"You're leaving?" The man asked with a confused look. It seems as if he is considering the idea.

"Yeah, I don't want to know what this is about" I blurted out without looking at him.

I hurried back inside my truck, and began to twist the ignition. The engine fired back to life as I put my truck to reverse back and slowly but surely drove out of the parking lot of this motel. I forgot to pay the room for the motel, but whatever, I don't want to stick around and find out. Before I drove off, I saw 2 people wearing what seemed to be a white masks. Both seemed to lack any feature, but nonetheless, a mask, standing just by the entrance of the motel. They both looked at me, silently. They both did not move a single inch out of their spot, almost as if they were just observing me, observing everyone in the motel. 

I drove towards the direction of the next highway, although, this one, I have to drive through the downtown area of this place, the same place where the town square would be before I reach the highway and return back to my drive. Due to the roadblocks the local police placed blocking anyone coming from the residential roads from entering, I have no choice but to drive at the exact route the town wanted to lead me to. The road led me directly to the downtown of the town.

Just as what the poster said attached on the motel’s bulletin board, there was an event going on in this town. More than a dozens of cars parked on the side of the road, people are heading straight towards the square where I noticed something odd as I tried to pass by. Hanging on the poles of each street lights itself, a banner with a symbol on it. It is a purple ring that surrounds a black circle. I remember this was the same symbol that is on that poster that I read hours ago all the way back at the motel. This has to be that event that is happening in this place.

The people walking towards the square are all wearing this white, featureless mask; men, women and even children are outside in the middle of midnight, all wearing this white mask. I tried to pass by the growing crowd of people just blocks before the actual city square, squeezing all of the space I got from the sea of parked cars parked at the side of the road. I squeezed through the sea or people walking by and eventually, I saw the actual square itself.

Although I was expecting a city square with a statue on it, which is very common just by the US East when I drove by places such as Point Pleasant in Virginia during my short trip to the Appalachia. This one however, has an open field, with bricked ground that signals the age of the town. Within this open field is a decently sized stage placed just by the front of the clocktower. I tried to get a better view of the stage but the amount of people pouring in did not stop. More and more people wearing masks began to walk towards the center, eventually even stopping walking altogether in front of my truck.

I wanted to honk at the people in front of me, but I have a feeling these guys will not take it kindly for me, probably even disturbing whatever this is. Did I mention this earlier? I cracked my window just a bit as I drove by the crowd so air could get through, and I heard barely any words spoken by people, only the footsteps they made. An event this large for some reason, not a single person spoke a word as they walked by, not even a murmur, whisper, or even just any breathy words. I  slowly squeezed my truck through the crowd, but it was no use, people are actually now standing in front of me, all staring towards the stage. I began to peer towards the clock of my truck, it was exactly 12:00 Midnight. Damn, it's the same time whatever this poster said, at least, that's what I remembered before I slept. Whatever this is, it's going to begin right now.

As I looked ahead, I began to watch the stage, now being filled with people on top of the platform. I couldn't get a good view of what exactly I saw, but I caught a slight glimpse of people in full black robes, you know those cliché robes that for some reason every single cult wears when they want to look spooky. 

I watched what seemed to be like 5 people standing by the stage, all collecting themselves on top of the stage. As the event seemed to start, a pale person stood directly at the center. I wondered what exactly I stumbled into? But at the same time, I don't exactly want to find out what I just got myself into; I think I got into something big, whatever this Harvest is, this ain't it. I attempt to drive slowly through the crowd. But they don't seem to move at all, even when my engines are running directly next to them. After what seems to be an eternity, the person on the stage eventually spoke.

"Thank you all for attending our annual Harvest of the Night. It's a pleasure for all of our townspeople to attend the celebration of our 

I heard what the lady said alright, It's something I've not witnessed before, and whatever it was, gave me goosebumps. I'm now stuck in the middle of a worship of whatever this is, and people just won't goddamn move at least for me. I feel like I'm trapped, forced to listen to whoever this ghostly woman is about to say next.

"Tonight folks, we will witness the arrival of our Chosen for this night's celebration. Our mistress will have a word of wisdom to share for our children within this sanctum…”

I only heard just as some of the masked people began to look towards me, not all, but some.

“It is wise for all of us to show our Mother Superior the respect she deserves. For she will arrive soon”.

As the words of this woman resonate within my truck, the desire to just leave is getting stronger and stronger. I don't like sitting in here, watching whoever this chosen would be.

"We have an interloper here!" One of the masked men said.

With a single shout from a man, suddenly, every single person in the entire square looked in my general direction. I don't see any of their faces with those masks, but I know these people are not pleased at my presence at all. This is it, I need to make a decision, I have to definitely leave this square right now. With so many people standing in front of me, I don't know if I should ram them off the road or just nudge them slowly. I have no choice, it's do it or don't, and I am doing it. 

“We have a new blood in our town,” one man said.

“What shall we do to this man?” A woman on a different side of my truck asked.

“We will bring them upon the sanctuary of our Lady”, one bickered.

I looked at the stage once more. The pale woman began to pay more attention to the commotion that was beginning to grow around me. The chants continued; it was nothing short of horrifying to hear it in a circle. To think I managed to get myself stuck with these lunatics will never leave my memory forever. Then, breaking the chants, the pale woman spoke

“We have a visitor! It appears Our Lady did answer our calls. Children! Bring the guest to me!” The Pale woman commanded.

Before I even began my plan for escape, one of the people began to whip out an entire machete, and I saw a glimmer of the blade as it swung towards me. Crack, my truck's windshield immediately shattered, spraying debris on the dashboard. Soon, more and more came out with some sort of weapon; a stick, a bat, and a knife, one of them even swung their own handbag to the windows of my truck, creating a loud thud on my truck that honestly frightened me more than anything. I began to mash the gas, but I watched as more and more people began to swarm my truck, feeling more and more boxed in with these people.

"Join us"

"The Mistress wants you” 

“We will offer you to the Dark Lady”

“Our mother told us you are worthy”.

All of these chants uttered by these crazy lunatics blocking my way. Before long, I thought my truck was going to be smashed by them, dragged me out of my truck, and brought to whoever their leader was in this place. The thought of it made me shudder to the core. I continued to mash the gas, trying not to run someone over because it might create a mountain of people that even my wheels couldn't spin on the pavement anymore and leave me stuck. People continued to smash my windows, trying as hard as they could to break the windows. I found myself a frightened mess trying to continue to nudge them to move out with the gas pedals.

After what seemed like an eternity of trying to move, I looked at my rear view mirror and saw a glimpse of flashing red and blue lights just in the distance. The police are here, and these people immediately looked at the police car behind me. It seems the cop stepped out of his car, and then began to walk backwards as these people slowly close in towards him. While I kind of hear the cop shout some commands towards the people in front of him,I couldn't hear what he said after. The cop is definitely not going to save me with these people. A decent amount of people around my truck began to slowly walk towards the police while the others still stood by the truck. 

At that point however, the truck managed to break through the crowd by a little, not before however, caught a glimpse of a man wearing some sort of ornamental armor, you know, the one with steel plates that looked like it was some sort of medieval age warrior or something like that. That one however wore a metallic helmet, with a mask that shaped like a face, and there's a crescent shape running along its back.

“You will join us,” the man in the armor said in a breathy voice.

The man swung his sword and hit my truck's pillar, and it actually smashed pretty good along my windshield and the pillar, even managed to get it stuck there in place. That didn't stop me from actually mashing the gas pedal to the metal, finally pushing forwards through the thinning crowd. 

As I finally drove forwards, a person jumped on my truck’s hood and hanged for his dear life as I sped through the town. He yelled many things, mostly culty stuff like “You will not leave this place, join us or die” and many colorful words. It did not take long for him to finally let go of his hand on my hood and fell down the pavement. Finally, I am gone from this place.

The speed of my escape was nothing short of breathtaking. The roaring engine of my truck sent me all the way to the city limits of this place. As I drove past the sign that led me to the highway, I briefly caught a glimpse of 4 masked people, 2 in the same ornamental armor and some in robes. All 4 just stood there, and watched me leave. I finally hopped back onto the highway I was meant to take the next day, but the dire situation certainly told me to just get on with it before I die. The entire experience was something I thought I would never make it out alive. The thought of being alone sent shivers down my spine and made me ask so many questions of whether or not I'll leave that place, but for now, all I thought about was drive, drive, and drive.

I eventually stopped at a nearby rest stop. It seems not a single soul is there at the moment, so I took my time to calm down. I stepped out of the truck and tried to make sense of everything. Burton, by the looks of it, has this ritual that they conduct annually, but to what end I wonder? For now, I have no clue. I walked around my truck and assessed the damage. The sword that got stuck on my pillar would be the damage sustained, well shit this is going to be pricey, at least I have a warranty. I tried to yank the sword out. It took a lot of convincing and it finally did after one hard yank. It's an insanely heavy sword, pretty large too, taller than I am. I placed it on my truck's bed, luckily it has a bed cover, so it's no issue hiding it from unwanted attention. After finding out there was nothing else damaged on my truck, I hopped back in and continued the remaining drive, praying I don't get pulled over along the way.

As of writing this on my couch in California, I am still wondering what this town is supposed to be exactly, or rather, what exactly is going on in that place. I tried to look up what exactly is the town of Burton, and I found their official website, the one where their city hall announces something, and by the looks of it, nothing is out of the ordinary. I even peeked on some of the groups I saw in social media sites, and all of it, nothing is out of the ordinary. Posts like garage sales, random stuff, or just people doing buy and sell, nothing about that place screams a town filled with weird people or cultists. 

Speaking of cult, I tried to find out what denomination they worship there. I tried to find anything that remotely resembles a church that conducts worship in darkness. For all I know, it could actually just be some super edgy people that just decided to attend some sick event that only happens in Burton, but I'm sure it is much larger than try-hards. I don't think it's small though, the entire town seemed to be involved. 

The results came out with nothing, no words about anything about that event, hell, I couldn't even find anything important that leads me to that angle, maybe it was a hoax? What sticks to me the most isn't the fact they did this at night, but their iconography, a purple ring surrounding a black circle, what cult would have a logo like that. I don't think even a typical Protestant church would have a logo like that.

There was also the matter of the cop that I briefly saw that flashed his lights before I left the scene. I peeked on some of the local news and even news around the state. While Burton never reported this situation, I did hear about it on a different news channel in Kansas. There was a Kansas Highway Patrol officer whose name I will not mention, that was reported missing the next day after I left that town. The report said he went missing at the town of Burton, and The report said:

“He was last seen travelling towards the town of Burton around 2:34 AM on Sept 12. He was wearing a Kansas Highway Patrol uniform and his car is still at large. If you have any information or if you believe you saw his vehicle or said person, contact 785-296-8262”

So, the man who pulled up was a Kansas Highway Patrol officer, and not a local cop. This man actually went missing when I last saw him pulled up on that town square. As it turns out, the cop prodidn’t make it out alive during his encounter with these people, and whatever happened to him, no one has heard from him since. I honestly feel horrible about what happened to him. To tell you guys the truth, I don't know exactly how I would deal with an entire town filled with cultists charging towards you, I don't truly know what kind of people would attack a cop and actually make him vanish.

As for the sword that got stuck on my pillar outside my truck, yes, I have it with me. Seeing this sword in person, I have never seen a sword that is longer than my height. I have to drag it inside my garage due to how heavy it is, just like earlier. I looked it up and there's swords longer than your usual sword, like a Greatsword, those things are longer than even your own height.

The sword is also filled with engravings on the metal, something like elaborate runes are etched on the blade itself, which means it must be something special. I suppose whoever handled that earlier is pretty strong to swing that towards my truck to the point it snapped the pillar in half and my windshield a complete spiderweb of cracks. I wonder if this was a bad idea though? Perhaps they can find this again? That would be the most painfully tiring thing to do ever, all for a sword.

I managed to book an appointment at a body shop to get that thing fixed. The issue though is I don't exactly know how to explain it to him, it's a goddamn miracle I managed to drive all the way to California with a broken pillar and windshield.

Thinking about it now, I cannot believe I managed to leave that town alive. I don't know if I'm not the only one who stumbled on this town all by themselves. Perhaps there is maybe one person who travelled just like me who stopped by the town, and just saw a nice town, not thinking this town would be their last place on earth. I just imagined like say, a delivery driver who just wanted to deliver their stuff to their homes, then he got greeted by weirdos. Hell, there is probably some stuff I forgot happened, like, did my truck actually got keyed that same night? I could've sworn I never saw that scratch before I left Chicago. Everything is just a blur at this point.

Anyway, I'm just glad I am here writing all of this to you all. Honestly, I thought I was not getting out of there alive after what just happened 3 days ago, I don't know if I'm lucky or I'm just glad someone actually came that day. I'll try and see if I can find anything else noteworthy, perhaps there are others here who also travelled in Burton before other than poor me. If you have anything to share, please, let me know. It might be helpful to others who did travel there and provide them some idea on what's happening in that town.
