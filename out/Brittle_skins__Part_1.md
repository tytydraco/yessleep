I still remember how the uncanny white hospital ceiling light swung gently over me as the doctor told me I was “lucky to be alive.” The word lucky cut me so deeply after all that I had seen and I had to fight to stop my face from crunching and contorting into a scowl. A half-hearted “thank you” was all I could muster towards the doctor, not even moving to meet his eyes as the pain was too great.

 Of course, I didn’t tell him what had really happened, the horrors I had seen. Because even as a 19 year old I knew that anything I said about it would mean my bedroom became nothing but a simple cell with padded walls. Adults could not fathom in their wildest fantasies the hellscape I had walked. If you had told me of it a month before I awoke in the hospital, I could not have fathomed it. 

It was the end of summer, early August. Since me and my friends all worked full-time now, we got together as the sun began to set to try and recapture the feeling of all those times we went swimming after school. The way the rich, orange rays skipped over the water in glorious beams should be a beautiful memory to me but now it just turns my stomach to even write about. I still can’t get to grips with the fact that I once swam in that water so joyously. 

We splashed, floated and reminisced for what felt like hours. So much so that the distant and vanishing sun began to give way to an eerie twilight. Richie, my friend who just never knew when to call it quits, grimaced at the lot of us as he taunted “Fully grown adults and you’ve spent all evening avoiding the high ledge, pathetic.”

 I wasted no time in splashing the group clown and beginning to climb out of the water, rising to the challenge. “Wow..” my oldest friend Tom began behind me. “All it takes is one girl to be around and now he’s Rambo.” 

He was talking about Anya. She was the only girl in our group and we had all gotten together as a result of a school project where she was shoe-horned in about 2 years ago. We all got on like a house on fire, misfits with “legendary dynamic” as Richie always claimed, miming an air guitar as he would say it. Richie, Tom and I all agreed after a while she was a great addition and no one would try and move to her, for the sake of the group.

I’ll admit though, in this instance Tom was right and I wanted to impress her. Not wanting to give him and his shit-eating grin the satisfaction I ignored him and turned to Anya. “I don’t know what you mean, she’s jumping too.” She also began to smirk as she came back quick as she always was “Awh, do you boys need me to hold your hands?” The group erupted into laughter and we all eventually found ourselves atop the ledge. 

“Go on then, poof” Tom shoved Richie playfully and the two began to rough-house behind us. Anya looked up at me with her brown eyes like pools of deep, dark honey and I did everything I could to wipe the undoubtably stupid smile off my face as I looked at her. “If you want to show-off, you’re missing your chance.” She teased me a lot over the years but this time was different as our shared gaze was unblinking, unbroken. The fragility of that moment was shattered as I felt Tom fix his gaze on me like prey, Richie’s neck under his shoulder and I saw his shit-eating grin make its glorious return.

Before anything else could be said or done, I jumped to preserve that happy moment. Little did i know it would be my last happy moment. This is the part where I’m lost for words. The doctor tells me I hit my head on the rocks as I came down. The bloodied, moist bandage on the back of my head tells me the same. But all I can remember for the life of me is my feet leaving the rocky platform and the world being consumed by blackness and apathy. 

The next thing I felt was cold, unbearable cold. The kind that makes you want to stuff your fingers into the fleshy gaps of your ribs just to keep the warmth and feeling in them. My head lay undamaged in dry, ashy soil but my body lay in what was the remnants of the now empty lake. The small puddle was ice cold and shallow, only enough to cover my shorts and torso in some sick cruel joke.  I had only experienced a hangover once or twice in my life by then, the feeling was incredibly akin to that. The morning after 10-12 cans of beer would probably encapsulate my headache in that moment perfectly. 

My body, as I mentioned, was strangely unbroken and as I rose to my feet the first thing that struck me was the light. Blue luminescence all around me, almost like broad daylight being provided by the moon. That was the most haunting oddity, the moon. Unlike any piece of nature I’d ever seen, the moon was perfect and smooth like a ping pong ball radiating powerful light. The high rock walls all around me perplexed me for a second as the eerie nature of my surroundings made me forget my dire situation.

The dehydrated lake I now stood in was, no doubt, the same one my friends and I had been playing in what felt like seconds earlier. A stiff lump began to rise in my throat as confusion slowly turned to suffocating anxiety, fuelling my desire to try climb out. 

I fixed my freezing cold fingers to the wall and they soon began to weep with glistening blood as I strained the skin, bone and muscle with my bodyweight. The more I climbed and re arranged my grips, the more my skin would give way in small areas all around my fingers and hands. Sharp rocks tore through my epidermis as if it was no more than cheap cling film. My blood ran through me like flaming electricity as I began to near the top, fighting off every itching urge to look down at the drop. 

Finally, I had pulled myself over the top and jammed my still oozing, crimson-stained extremities under my armpits. I felt the warm and widespread droplets press against the cold skin of my upper ribcage and began to look around, tears welling in my eyes. I tried to get my bearings but the more I looked around, the more I began to realise how lost I was. 

In place of the small and vibrantly coloured trees that sat behind the lake I knew, the whole area was now overrun with twisted unnatural dark blue trunks that jutted out of the ground in horrifying misshapen fashion. Instead of lush green leaves to top them, sagging ribbons of beige and sickly reds hung there instead, often in a clumpy, cyst-like fashion. The deeply upsetting, fleshy nature of the vegetation made me retch as if the air in my lungs had turned to cement. 

My eyes began to sting and seep salty tears and I could feel my organs all bulging inside me as I retched like I was some kind of hellish accordion being played by evil forces. Yet with all that going on I still heard it. The sound bounced off the glossy, hideous tree trunks and hyper vigilance overtook me in an instant. I could faintly make out the rhythmic thumping of someone, something, walking towards me from the unfamiliar forest. 

I scraped the endlessly welling tears away from my eyes, desperate to disprove the existence of what I saw. It was like a deer. I say that because that’s the closest thing its figure vaguely resembled as it approached me but its features told me a much more horrifying and mind-bending answer. 

It had hairless and bony legs that strained and stretched the discoloured skin around them with every step, they reminded me of raw, infected chicken. To say it was vascular was wrong. As far as I could tell it had no veins, just horrific purple bruising scattered all over its bony torso as if its flesh was giving way to whatever was inside. Some parts resembled veins but as the nightmare neared me I realised what  they were. Long, thin, slightly pulsing pink and blue worms moving around under the surface of the bruised and stretched skin, like they were searching for any bit of flesh to naw on from the skeletal creature as they starved inside it. 

The face, or lack there of, is what will truly stay with me until the end of my life. I saw it from every terrible angle as the beast seemingly scanned its surroundings, unaware of me. Held up by a thin and equally strained looking neck was a concave, fleshy mass. No discernible features other than the dark pit with  sparse wiry looking hair jutting out it at the centre. Around this endless looking hole were pale white ridges at random points, clean and undamaged. It was as if they were crafted from porcelain, all smooth shaped and getting smaller and smaller as you neared the centre. 

A petrified, pathetic yelp escaped me as I scrambled to my feet. The noise I made in doing so made me realise what the creatures horrific head truly was when its neck made a fleshy, wet crack as it turned in an instant towards me. It was an ear.

It was like invisible roots had sprung from the ground and wrapped round my feet, I was entirely frozen but desperate to move. As the monstrous forest dweller barrelled towards me I saw no indication of recognition or direction in it, just blind rage and predatory instinct taking over. As the distance closed in a matter of seconds, I stumbled into the shadowy abyss between the twisted tree trunks. I did so clumsily, and as jagged and unforgiving branches clawed at my head and back I heard the rhythmic thumping of its feet on the ground get angrier and more resolute the more noise I made. 

My own footsteps began to match the charging monsters in a torturous melody, the sound of its four pounding legs on the dry ground slowly drowning out the noise my pathetic retreat made. 

In my frantic and clumsy panic, I was caught short by a lone root in the shadowy abyss and came crashing to the floor with a thud that shook my entire body. Pain shot up through my leg and a coppery taste began to form in my mouth as my teeth slammed shut on my tongue like a piece of fabric caught in a car door. Blood gargled slightly at the back of my throat as I let out an injured groan that I could not fight. 

I rolled onto my back and saw my hellish pursuer now towering over me on its hind legs, dead silent. Time seemed to freeze as I gazed into the deep, hair filled hole at the centre of the beasts horrific head. The moment shattered like glass as a wine-red and pulsating tongue began to emerge from the darkness of the large, uncanny ear. It was covered in what looked like small wrinkles and slight discolourations with a horrible brown wax gathering in clumps over the length of the thing. 

Blood began to drip from my gaping mouth and I had completely forgotten my pain as pure adrenaline had overtaken me entirely. The foul and unnatural tongue swayed slightly in the pale moonlight, unsure where its now completely silent prey was. Chunks of fleshy mass and wax began to drip from it like small birds falling dead from the sky. 


My spine shivered and my back cramped in the cold night but the horrible warmth radiating off the now nearing tongue was no comfort. As my eyes adjusted I realised it was not a fleshy mass looking to taste me, it was a limb extending from the deers head made up entirely of the haunting parasitic worms that seemed to plague its skin. I quickly came to realise this awful snake like collection of worms was only held together by the wax and blood that thickened in the creatures body. These horrid paste-like fluids mixed into a dirt brown in some areas where blackened and dried worms would be sliding off the tongue like melting butter. 

My hand fumbled around in the cold dirt next to me and I felt my dried and sticky blood gluing the crumbles of soil on the ground to my skin. As my hand closed around a thick branch, tingling and powerful electric thumped through me as I swung directly at the creatures head.
 
A sickening crack like thunder hit the air. 

At first I thought my arm had broken when the gut-wrenching pain shot through it as the branch connected but stopped immediately. The creatures pale head was rock solid. With the branch now shattered at my feet, I had no defence left but to nurse my aching shoulder and I began to cry as the only sound in the forest now was the moist smacking of worms, crawling towards me in dark piles like volcanic sand. I closed my eyes and weeped, my voice raspy through the metallic and oily blood that was still drowning me. 

GRAAHHHHHH

A human-sounding and rage-filled war cry pulled me to my senses from behind. I began to buck and roll and pull at anything near me to get away. When I snapped open my eyes to help put as much distance between me and the creature as possible, I saw my filthy and bloody hands now covered in worms like they were wasps gathering on a nest. The scarring insects tried to force their narrow bodies into the cuts that were now clotted over on my hands from the climb.

Dragging my hands forcefully down the plasticky and ridged face of a nearby tree, I saw the small army of lipstick red parasites fall away and turned my attention to what was going on behind me. 

It was Richie and Anya. Their bathing suits were caked in mud to much a more severe degree than mine and I had never seen the pair so ferocious and enraged. Richie had been the one to let loose the loud and furious shout as I lay on the ground. Now, he stood forcing a sizeable stick into the awful ear’s gaping cavern and it squelched and began to pour worms, the stick going in further and further.

 Anya pulled me up by the arm, clawing painfully at my skin the get the last of the worms out from my wounds. She and Richie kept screaming piercing and awful screams at the creature and as my sense came back to me, I joined them. Worms began to burst and twist with horrible black fluid as the stick forced against the legions of them fleeing from the monsters head. The more worms that escaped its body, the smaller and frailer the beast became. 

Eventually, its four haunting and weak looking legs snapped as they gave way ,almost in unison, like they were held up by the worms. As the creature hit the ground, twitching and cringing, I expelled all the last contents of my stomach and I felt a hand hold my back. 

“It’s okay, it’s dead” flat and emotionless, Richie assured me.

My attention turned to my friends and I found myself bursting with questions but lost for words. 

“We thought you were dead.” Anya wrapped her arms around me as she choked out the sentence through tears

“Did you two not wake up in the lake?” Was the first thing that popped to mind. 

Richie squinted his eyes at me in obvious, almost seemingly enraged disbelief. “No, we did. That was at least 24 hours ago”
