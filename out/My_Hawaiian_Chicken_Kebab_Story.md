I never thought grilling would save my daughter's life...

Yet here I am, reflecting on an event that took place two weeks ago. My wife and I were hosting a dinner party in our backyard. Our guest list was small. Some neighbors, a few friends, and a couple coworkers.

The evening had settled in comfortably, wrapping our backyard in a warm, amber glow from the string lights overhead. Music drifted softly through the air, and the gentle hum of conversation mixed with the clinking of glasses and bursts of laughter. My wife, Claire, was chatting with some friends by the patio table, her smile bright and effortless. I stood by the grill, turning my Hawaiian chicken kebabs, the sweet smell of a tangy glaze mingling with the smoky scent of the grill.

Our daughter, Lily, had been running around earlier, excited by the guests. She loved it when we hosted parties. All the adults giving her attention, sneaking her brownies, cookies, and who knows what else. But now, as I watched her move around the yard, something seemed... off. She wasn’t running or playing anymore. She seemed sluggish, her steps dragging slightly as she made her way to the drink table.

I turned my attention back to the grill, but a nagging feeling settled in my chest.

I kept glancing at her, the way she moved from group to group, her eyes searching for something. Finally, she approached me, her small hand tugging at my shirt.

"Daddy," she said, her voice quiet, almost a whisper. "Do we have anything else to eat? Henry's asking."

I frowned, crouching down to her level. "What do you mean, sweetheart? Did Henry say he wanted something in particular?"

She nodded, her eyes not quite meeting mine. Her skin looked pale, and there was a tiredness there that made my heart twist. "He said he was still... hungry. I told him I'd ask you."

I glanced over her shoulder, scanning the yard. Henry was standing near the edge of the garden, away from the others. He caught my eye and gave me a small, polite smile before turning back to look at the trees, as if admiring the view. There was nothing particularly strange about him. He was a friend of Claire's from work, someone she insisted we invite. He'd shown up with a bottle of wine and a charming laugh, fitting in easily with the rest of our friends. But now, as I watched him, something cold settled in my stomach.

"Lily, sweetheart," I said slowly, "what exactly did Henry say to you?"

She blinked, her brow furrowing like she was trying to remember. "He said I was sweet," she mumbled. "And... and that he was still a little hungry. He asked if I could help."

My mouth went dry. I glanced over at Claire, but she was still deep in conversation, unaware. I stood up, my eyes fixed on Henry. He was watching us now, his head tilted slightly, his lips curved into a faint smile. It wasn’t friendly. It was knowing. I forced a smile, trying to keep my voice calm.

"Okay, sweetheart. Go back to Henry and tell him I'll bring over some fresh kebabs in just a minute, alright?"

She hesitated for a moment before nodding and making her way back across the yard. I watched her as she approached Henry, and saw the way he leaned down to speak to her, his hand resting lightly on her shoulder. He glanced back at me, his smile never faltering, then led Lily around the corner, out of sight.

My stomach twisted.

Something was very wrong. I grabbed the tray of Hawaiian chicken kebabs, the wooden skewers sticking out like little spears, and hustled across the yard. My heart pounded as I moved, my eyes fixed on the darkened corner where they had disappeared.

As I rounded the corner, I saw them. Henry was crouched down, his face inches from Lily's neck, his eyes closed, his lips parted. There was a strange, almost intimate stillness to the scene that made my blood run cold. Without thinking, I dropped the tray, the kebabs scattering across the grass.

"Hey!" I shouted, my voice cracking.

Henry's head snapped up, his eyes flashing red in the dim light. He bared his fangs, his face twisting into something monstrous. He lunged at me, faster than I could react, knocking me backward. I hit the ground hard, the breath knocked out of me.

Claire, who must have heard the commotion, appeared just as Henry loomed over me, her face a mask of shock and fear. "Get away from him!" she screamed, her voice breaking, but Henry barely spared her a glance.

I struggled beneath him, the cold weight of his body pressing me down. I was so scared that if he killed me, Claire would be next.

His eyes, now glowing a deep, menacing red, locked onto mine. "You should've just let me have her," he hissed, his voice no longer charming but filled with malice.

I caught sight of one of the fallen skewers, just within arm's reach.

With a desperate grunt, I lunged for it, my fingers closing around the wooden stick. As Henry's fangs descended toward my neck, I drove the skewer upward, plunging it into his chest, the chicken, bell peppers, and pineapple spraying all over the yard.

Henry recoiled, a look of shock and rage crossing his face.

I scrambled to my feet, grabbing more skewers, my adrenaline pumping. He lunged at me again, but I was ready. I stabbed him once, twice. Each time driving the skewer deep into his chest. He let out a horrible, guttural growl, his form flickering and weakening. I stabbed him four more times, until he finally crumpled to the ground, his body dissolving into ash before my eyes.

Claire rushed forward, tears streaming down her face.

"Are you okay?" she asked, her voice trembling as she helped me up.

I nodded, pulling her into a shaky embrace. My eyes went to Lily, who stood trembling, her eyes wide and frightened. I dropped the skewers and pulled her into my arms, holding her close.

"It’s okay, sweetheart," I whispered, my voice shaking. "He’s gone. He can’t hurt you anymore."

Henry's ashes stirred slightly, and for a moment I thought it was over. But a whisper seemed to rise from them, Henry's voice echoing faintly in the darkness. "When you invite one of us... you invite us all." The ashes scattered in the wind, and a cold shiver ran down my spine.

The night air felt colder now, the laughter and music from the party distant and surreal. I glanced back at the yard, where the guests were still oblivious, unaware of the danger that had just been averted.

I picked Lily up, carrying her toward the house. "Let’s go inside, okay? We’re done with the party for tonight." She nodded against my shoulder, her sobs quieting.

"I'll send everyone home," Claire said to me as she walked beside us.

Her face still pale, her eyes darting around the yard, worried about another surprise. I knew one thing for certain. Henry was gone, but his warning lingered.

I will never forget what had happened. And I will never let my guard down again.
