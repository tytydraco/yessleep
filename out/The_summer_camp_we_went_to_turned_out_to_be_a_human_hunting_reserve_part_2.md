*------*

I didn't think. I acted first. My body went into overdrive with adrenaline and instinct.

Jacob and I bolted for the nearest building—the dining hall. I ignored the screams and roars around us, all I was concerned about was surviving.

After we reached the building, I yanked the door open and shoved Jacob inside.

Once we were in, I slammed the damn door shut with all my strength, the wood groaning under the impact. My hands shook so badly that it took three tries to lock it, my breath coming in short, panicked gasps.

"Jacob, help me!" I barked, already dragging one of the heavy-ass tables across the floor. The screech of the wood against the tiles made my teeth clench, but I didn’t stop.

We shoved the table against the door, and I didn’t stop there. Grabbing a couple of chairs, I stacked them on top, wedging them as tightly as possible. It wasn’t perfect, but it was all we had.

Jacob just stood there, trembling, clutching his bag like it was some kind of shield. His wide, terrified eyes flicked to me, silently begging for reassurance I couldn’t give.

Hesitantly, I peeked outside through the blinds—big mistake.

My eyes were being violated by what I was watching.

*I could never forget it for as long as I lived, no matter how much I wanted to forget.*

I froze in place, feeling like all the blood in my body left me. I couldn't breathe, my lungs froze and my knees felt like wet paper, it felt like I was getting pulled deeper and deeper down a pit. I was certain that the world had ended.

They were being ripped apart.

Screams—high-pitched, gut-wrenching wails—rattled the air. The campers… they didn’t stand a chance. Those things, they were hunting them, *us,* like we were animals.

What the fuck are they? Werewolves?

"Mama! Mama!" One of the kids screamed, her cries for help slowly turned into piercing shrieks of anguish. Two of those monsters grabbed her, each taking an arm, and played tug of war with her body. Her screams twisted into something even worse, something raw, as they pulled harder.

Blood sprayed everywhere, painting the grass red. They played with the pieces like they were toys before one of them started eating.

Another kid tried fighting back. He threw rocks and grabbed a canoe paddle. One of those monsters just walked up to him on their hind legs, towering over him by two feet. It grabbed him by the throat, lifted him like he weighed nothing, then used its remaining hand and gutted him alive.

I wanted to scream, cry, anything. But I couldn't. My stomach nearly gave out. I felt helpless. My body shook violently and my spine had left.

Jacob tugged at my hand, I snapped out of it.

"C'mon!" I took his hand and we headed for the kitchen. Maybe we could hide until this nightmare was over. It didn't feel real. I couldn't be. Maybe it was all some sick dream.

We both froze when we heard a smash coming from outside. Jacob started to tear up and shake like a leaf. I put a finger against my lips, gesturing to stay quiet as I pulled him down behind the counter. A few more rattles, then a loud crash, making me flinch. There goes our barricade.

"Mommy! Mommy! They're here! I can sniff 'em!"

Oh, God, no. That voice—it sounded like a child’s, but wrong. Twisted. Like someone had taken an innocent voice and run it through a shitty audio filter from hell.

"You mean, the boy that you ordered?"

"Mhmm! Mhmm! They're in here, Mommy! And he's with someone too!" He sounded too excited.

Fuck.

Thinking quickly, my eyes darted around the kitchen looking for anything useful. I quietly rummaged underneath through drawers and shelves, eventually, I found a gallon of ethanol under the sink, I grabbed it and looked for anything else.

Aha! Bleach, ammonia, oil, butane—yeah, this can work.

I grabbed a stainless steel pot and every cleaning product I could find. Pouring all of them into the pot, I mixed them all together before shoving the pot into the oven along with the canister of butane.

They were getting closer. The sound of claws scraping against the wooden floor outside the door encouraged me to act faster.

I grabbed a box of matches, a large Tupperware, and a kitchen knife. I poured what was left of the alcohol into the tupperware and tiptoed toward the door and hid nearby.

Jacob protested. He shook his head rapidly and begged for me to come back. I gestured for him to be quiet again as the voices got near.

"Little pigs? Little pigs? Won't you come out?" The older distorted voice called out, sing-song.

"Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin!\~" The 'kid' chirped mockingly. They both laughed like it was the funniest thing in the world. The kid's voice was giddy, almost too excited—It was high-pitched, but it had that same wrongness.

My heart beat at Mach 20 as I waited.

A snuffling sound. Wet. Hungry. Something was sniffing just inches away from the door.

I held my breath. Every second felt like an eternity. My hands trembled as I knelt there, waiting for an opportunity. What was I thinking? This was a huge gamble.

The door creaked. A large hand, covered in fur, and huge claws covered in blood, slipped inside and flicked on the light switch. It pulled back, then a huge snout pushed past the door and sniffed the air.

I almost hesitated. It felt like my soul left my body again.

"There you are\~," the werewolf said in a sing-song voice.

Despite its canine face, its features twisted to mimic that of a human grin without changing.

Up close, I finally got a good look at it under the flickering light and holy shit. I thought my eyes were gonna bleed for staring at it for so long.

It looked like a werewolf from that old Van Helsing movie that was made back in the 2000s. Except this one was short and lanky. Its body was covered in this dark, greenish fur that looked all matted.

Its voice sounded like that of a little kid, yet unlike the others outside, it stood as tall as me. It brandished its claws in front of my face. My legs shook violently as it moved closer to me.

With a yell, I swung the Tupperware forward, throwing all of the ethanol, soaking it from head to toe.

"What the?"

Quickly lighting a match, I tossed it at the werewolf.

Instantly, it bursts into flames. 

Jacob winced and covered his ears. The screams sounded like nails scraping against a chalkboard combined with a malfunctioning tornado siren. It thrashed around wildly, causing fire to spread around the kitchen, it violently rammed itself against the walls, floor, and sink, trying to put out the flames.

"Oh, my God! Darling!"

"Mommy! Daddy! Help me!"

“Darling, no! Mommy’s here! Hold on!”

A cold wave of horror washed over me as I heard the shattering of glass and wood outside the kitchen.

No. No. No.

Without hesitation, I sprinted over to the oven and flipped the dial to max. I grabbed Jacob's arm and kicked open the back door.

We ran through trees like insanity on two feet. I didn't need to turn around and look to know that the kitchen exploded. That should keep them distracted for a bit. With the rest of them busy feasting on the other campers, it should buy us some time to reach the lake and get on a boat.

I ignored the agonized wails of campers rumbling across the sky. The cries for help. The sound of bones crunching and flesh tearing.

Yet we didn't stop running.

If we ran into someone still alive, fine. They’d be bait, whether they knew it or not.

*I'm horrible for that, I know. It makes me fucking sick to my stomach remembering that I considered that. What kind of person uses other people as bait?*

*But that night I was operating solely on pure survival instinct. It wasn't about being a good person—it was about not dying.*

*I had to keep myself and Jacob safe, that was all that mattered.*

"Emma, I'm tired."

Jacob gasped, nearly falling to his knees. I quickly scooped him up and carried him while running.

The lake was near, I could see it. The moonlight reflecting off the water's surface sparked a glimmer of hope within me. We hit the beach, and there they were. Boats. Thank God.

I settled Jacob down on the pier and threw myself at ropes tying the nearest boat down. I started undoing them as fast as possible. I hissed in frustration, my hands were shaking so badly I couldn't get a good grip, making things harder.

Thankfully, it didn't take long. I finally managed to untie the damn knot. 

"Jacob, c'mon! Let's get out of here!"

He ran over to me, I picked him up, placed him on the boat, and grabbed a paddle.

"Little pig."

It took a second for my brain to register the searing hot agony exploding from my shoulder, spreading to the rest of my body. 

My world was spinning, and my vision doubled when my head slammed against the hard wooden pole. I didn't realize I was screaming until my lungs ran out of air.

Something warm and wet trickled down my face. It dripped into my left eye, turning the world red. It wasn’t until I tasted the metallic tang on my lips that I realized it was my blood. I lay there on the ground crying loudly as I writhed like a worm.

My hand shot to my shoulder.

Oh God. Oh God, no.

My fingers brushed something raw, something wet. My stomach lurched when I felt the exposed flesh. My shoulder—it wasn’t just bleeding. It was *gone.*

"Emma! Emma!"

With a scream, I forced myself up. My blood ran cold.

Jacob tried to run. Five more of those monsters swarmed him like a pack of rabid dogs, pinning him to the ground. He thrashed and kicked, but they were too big, too heavy. My brother's screams were torture for my ears.

"Jacob! No! Let him go! P-Please!" I begged as I tried to crawl towards him.

No. That wasn't possible.

The same werewolf that I set on fire in the kitchen was looking down on me, pure fury reflecting from its eyes.

Crippling pain shot through my chest as its foot slammed against my stomach. The sound of my ribs snapping echoed in my head like gunshots. 

Next thing I knew, I felt the cool wind on my back, my eyes facing up glimpsing at the stars. For a moment, gravity didn't have a hold on me.

Then a deafening splash. The lake swallowed me whole. The cool water wrapped around me in a vice grip.

The pain was too much, I couldn't move. My vision started to fade to black as I felt myself sinking deeper and deeper.
