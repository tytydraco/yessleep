The hike was tomorrow. The rest would meet us in the morning. For now, the sky was dark. Just me and Scarlet, my best friend's girlfriend, were here at the campsite. We carpooled a day early. Her boyfriend and another girl were "the rest."

She retired to her tent, which was separate from mine, while I stayed out by the fire. More of an ember now. I didn't want to sleep yet. I liked the way the tips of the trees held up the sky. The flap of the nylon tent in the breeze. How the nearby brook whispered to the rocks. I even liked the way our empty beer bottles laid in the dirt.

Eventually, I went to bed only to be quietly woken up hours later by Scarlet. Without a word spoken, I understood. We made love then she went back to her tent.

I'm not sure why I do things. I knew this would happen.

The next day, Hank — her boyfriend, my best friend — arrived with Annie. No one suspected a thing and it was time for the hike.

We walked seemingly forever. Long enough to run out of things to say and new things to notice. The birdsongs kept us company though. They floated on the air and gently landed on us. The air carried something else though.

A strange noise coming from the north. Hank heard it first and said it sounded like a whimper, or maybe a wheezing. It was hard to tell and, to be honest, I didn't hear anything at first. But I believed they did.

I followed them through a few thickets before I finally heard it. It was definitely human. A woman, actually. But it sounded almost like a wounded animal. Whatever it was, it was nearby.

We crested a small hill and looked down onto the other side: a weeping woman. She was wearing a tattered hospital gown with flip-flops — I got really stuck on the flip-flops — and was seated on a rock at the mouth of a dark cave.  Her arms were buried in her hands.

Hank went up to her first. "Excuse me, miss, are you okay? Do you need help?" She lifted her head, startled enough to stop crying. One of her eyes were green. The other, blue. Both were wild.

She fought back another wave of tears, but couldn't get herself to speak, so Scarlet chimed in, "Why don't we get you out of here? Somewhere safe. Did you come here with anyone?"

The weeping woman said, "I can't leave."

"Sure you can," said Scarlet. "How about we--"

"I CAN'T LEAVE!" the weeping woman shouted loudly enough to drive off the nearby birds.

Which made me realize something: there were no birdsongs. In fact, there were no sounds. No rustling leaves, no insects, no nothing. The silence was thick and viscous.

The weeping woman reigned herself in, "I'm sorry. But I just can't leave."

"Can you tell us what's happened? Are you hurt?" asked Hank.

"I'm fine, I just--" she took a deep breath, "something's in the cave." I looked at the cave, it was dark. I couldn't see more than a few feet into it. I liked it.

"What's in the cave?" I asked.

"I went in there. I saw it, I know I did. Only every time I come out, I can't remember what it was," she explained while fighting back a brand new wave of tears.

I saw the confusion fill the eyes of my friends just as I'm sure they saw it fill mine.

The weeping woman went on, "But I can't shake this feeling that it's important. Please, can you tell me what's in the cave? Please?"

The confusion quickly turned to fear as it typically does.

Annie broke the silence, "I'll go in."

"What? No?" Hank protested.

"It's just a cave. If it were an animal, it would have attacked her. I'll just go in a few feet, then she can see it's nothing and we can go. Aren't you guys curious?"

Yes, we were. Hank protested a little more, but Annie's mind was made up. She was going in that cave, and I was glad she was. I think we all were.

Annie took off her backpack and started walking in. When she reached the front, she stopped and tried to see inside. It was no use. It was too dark. She looked at us, then back into the cave. A moment of hesitation, but only a moment.

After a few more steps, Annie was swallowed by the cave's shadowy maw. Her footsteps grew fainter and fainter and fainter. Then they were gone.

We waited a few seconds, which quickly turned into minutes as they're wont to do. The weeping woman kept weeping.

Scarlet started panicking, "I don't like this, she shouldn't have gone in. We should have left." She cupped her mouth, "Annie!"

Hank got brave. "I'm going in," he said. Suddenly, we could hear Annie's footsteps emanating from the cave.

"Annie!" She emerged. I noticed her hand was in her jacket pocket and she looked pale. She had Seen something. "Are you okay?!" asked Hank.

"Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. It's fine." She didn't seem too fine. The weeping woman wasted no time, "What's in there?"

Annie paused and looked us each in the eye.

"It's weird. No matter how hard I try, I can't seem to remember."

"What *do* you remember?" asked the weeping woman.

It was like Annie didn't realize she remembered something. "I can only remember what it's not."

"What it's not?" I asked. "What does that mean?"

Annie said, "I don't know. It's not a liquid. It's not a square either."

Hank and Scarlet  asked the necessary follow-ups — was it a person? An animal? "No."

Then I thought of something I was almost too scared to ask. "Is it alive?"

"I don't remember."

"What's with your hand?" asked Hank. Annie pulled it out and we saw that branches and vines were growing out of it. We knew it was growing *out* of her because the way they split her skin.

"What the fuck?!" Scarlet screamed. By this point, I knew we should leave. But I also knew we weren't going to. Annie's branch hand didn't hurt her, and she didn't have any answers.

We all knew what was coming next, we just weren't sure who would do it. To my surprise, Scarlet stepped up, she was going in next. Hank tried to plead with her, he even tried getting us to leave.

"We're going now," he said.

"Then leave," said the weeping woman.

"I will." But he couldn't. He literally couldn't. The weeping woman chuckled.

Scarlet disappeared into the cave and we waited in total silence. This one took a little longer, but sure enough she came out. Something was trickling from her eyes: blood.

Scarlet's eyes matched the weeping woman's now: one blue, one green. They didn't hurt; she made that clear.

"What was in there?" asked the weeping woman.

"I can't remember what it is, but I remember what it showed me."

"Fire. Endless fire. Flesh. Sinew. Hair," the weeping woman said. Scarlet could only nod.

"Fuck this, I'm going in," said Hank. None of us bothered protesting.

A few minutes after descended, I had an idea. I asked Annie, "You can't remember what it is, right? Then that means whatever you can't remember is what it is."

It took her a few seconds to understand, but it wasn't right. "That's too vague though. I don't remember what I had for breakfast yesterday, but I know it's not that. It can't be everything I don't remember."

A dead end.

Soon enough, Hank came out. I wasn't sure it was Hank at first, though. Mainly because of the large antlers  growing from his head — large, impressive, holy, fully developed. They were beautiful if I'm being honest. Sticky blood matted the hair underneath them.

None of us were really shocked by the antlers at this point, we just wanted to know what he saw.

"I can't remember what it is, but I remember what it told me: 'So it was, and so it will always be.' That over and over again. It's stuck in my head on repeat." Hank sat down and felt his antlers.

I knew it was my turn now. They knew it too. Even if I wasn't curious about the cave's interior, I couldn't compel myself away. I had to go into the cave, and I had to forget what I saw.

I approached. At the barrier between the afternoon sunlight and the cave's oppressive shadow, I stopped and looked at my friends. At the weeping woman. And I wished we never started this hike. I went into the cave.

This is where it gets a little fuzzy, so bear with me.

I can't tell you what was in the cave because I don't remember.  I *can* tell you what it's named. But I won't, and there's a reason for that.

A few minutes — seconds, maybe, days? — I came out of the cave. I remember falling to my knees and vomiting wet twigs and leaves. When I collected myself, I turned to my friends. They didn't have to ask.

"I know it's name," I said.

"What's it's name?"

I only got halfway through: "ⲒⲀⲖⲦⲀ--"

"Wait, no!" I remember the weeping woman shout! But it was too late. The ground beneath our feet rumbled. It felt good.

I could hear the birds chirping again — they got louder and louder and louder. Too loud . My friends collapsed and covered their ears. It was overwhelming, yet still, it felt good. And bad. I don't know how to explain. I guess it felt like a deep tissue massage, or the pleasurable pinch of a cigarette in your lungs, or that sliver of pride and importance you find in grief.

A noise came from the cave; it sounded like a massive person struggling to inhale.

Then everything went black. Suddenly, I was in an unfamiliar city. It was beautiful.

I liked the way the tips of buildings held up the blue sky. The flap of trash in the breeze. The cherry of a discarded cigarette. How the gutter water whispered to the concrete.

I didn't know it yet, but I'd never see my friends again, or they'd never see me again, it's hard to tell which. No one had ever heard of them wherever I was. Wherever I am.

But as I laid there, enjoying the sounds and the sights, somewhere — not here, but somewhere — there was a sewer opening in a wall. It's covered in graffiti and sealed off with metal bars. I can feel it.

It's dark. As dark as a cave.
