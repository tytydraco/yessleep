Two days ago, I woke up to the sound of something crawling inside the walls. The noise was bone-chilling. I won’t lie…I was scared out of my mind. I pressed my ear against the wall and could only hear the same slow, dragging sound, like something slithering inch by inch through the dark.

My heart was pounding harder and harder. I put in my earplugs and played some music at a low volume, hoping to drown it out and get some sleep. It didn’t work. I couldn’t sleep—just the thought of that thing kept me awake.

I moved into this cheap, small apartment a week ago. After the divorce, I couldn’t afford much, so I settled for this place. It was surprisingly decent for how little it cost... but now I’m starting to realize why it was so cheap.

Yesterday, I called the landlord to try to sort this out. The sound was driving me insane and worse, it was making me genuinely afraid.

“Mr. Bregger, there’s something crawling inside the walls. I can’t sleep. Could you please send someone to take care of it?”

“Oh, don’t worry, it’s just rats. Nothing to be scared of,” he said, his voice was calm but I wasn’t fooled. He was too calm.

“Even if they’re rats, I’m not exactly thrilled. I don’t like rats or anything like that, really.” It’s not a phobia, but just the thought of those filthy animals crawling around makes my skin crawl.

“Don’t worry,” he repeated. “They don’t do any harm, and they’re inside the walls, you won’t even see them. It only lasts a day or two. The other tenants said the same thing, and then it stopped. You won’t hear anything after that.”

He was trying to reassure me, but I could already tell this was a dead end. There was no point in arguing.

Right after the call, I promised myself, if this didn’t stop in the next couple of days, there would be a serious problem. And if Mr. Bregger didn’t fix it, I would make sure he regretted it.

But the more time passed, the more I was convinced that those weren’t rats. The sounds had a rhythm. A pattern. Almost like… a conversation.

I was terrified. On the edge of panic. But something kept me from running away: curiosity. I had to know what was inside the walls. And I knew deep down—whatever it was, it couldn’t be rats.

During the day, I pressed my ear to the wall again, hoping to catch the sounds and understand what I was dealing with. But nothing. The silence was even worse. And when the sounds finally came back, they filled me with something worse than fear…dread. The more I listened, the more anxious I became. The noise made my whole body tense, like every nerve knew something was wrong.

Then I realized... it didn’t sound like crawling anymore. It was something else. Familiar somehow. Now that I was really paying attention, it sounded like words. Whispered in some rough, guttural voice. In a language I didn’t recognize.

That’s when I knew…something was talking inside the walls.

I decided to record the sounds with my phone. I listened to the recordings over and over again, paying close attention but nothing. Just the same static and scratching. I connected my phone to my laptop and downloaded a free audio editor. I tried everything I could think of.

I sped up the playback—nothing. Slowed it down—still nothing. I used every enhancement tool I could find to clean up the noise, but again, nothing helped.

I was just about to give up when one last idea crossed my mind: what if I reversed the audio? What came out of the speakers made my blood run cold.

A distorted voice, over and over, whispering: “Run. He will kill you.”

My whole body froze. I couldn’t breathe. Panic, fear, dread…everything hit me at once. I wanted to run without looking back, get as far away as I could. So many strange things had happened in the past forty-eight hours…and this? This pushed it over the edge.

But I didn’t run. I did something else.

\*\*\*

This morning, first thing, I went to a hardware store and bought a sledgehammer. When I got back to the apartment, I didn’t hesitate. I needed to know what was behind that wall.

I swung the hammer as hard as I could. Blow after blow, I kept going until the wall began to crumble. And then, from one of the holes I made, something came out.

A human arm.

I screamed, loud enough to wake the entire building. I couldn’t move. I was frozen in place for five whole minutes. The longest five minutes of my life. My spine felt like ice, my face soaked in cold sweat.

Slowly, I stepped closer. It was unmistakably human. And unmistakably decomposing.

The smell hit me. My stomach turned. I nearly threw up, but I shut my eyes and forced myself to breathe slowly. It was close. Way too close.

I dropped the sledgehammer. Didn’t even think. I bolted for the door. I wasn’t taking clothes, wasn’t packing a thing. I just needed to get out—now. As far from this place as possible. Never come back.

But when I opened the door to leave, he was standing there. Mr. Bregger. Right in front of me, hand raised, about to knock.

“Oh! I was just about to check in on the rat situation,” he said, smiling warmly—too warmly.

“Ah… yeah. They’ve stopped. Everything’s fine now,” I stammered, trying to hide the terror in my voice. I kept the door half-closed, trying to block his view inside so he wouldn’t see the demolished wall.

All I wanted was for him to leave so I could escape. But of course, things only got worse from there.

The sound from the wall started up again—loud, echoing through the apartment. But somehow... he didn’t react at all. It was like he couldn’t hear it.

“Let me take a look,” he said kindly. “Maybe I can help. Other tenants before you have complained about noises too.”

“There’s no need, the sounds stopped since yesterday. But… thanks,” I said, trying hard to act like everything was fine even though the noise in the walls was getting louder by the second. All I wanted was for him to leave. Right then. Right there.

“Well, I came all the way over… at least let me have a look,” he said, suspicious now. “Come on, let me in.”

Before I could stop him, Bregger shoved the door open and stepped into the tiny apartment.

When his eyes landed on the destroyed wall and the arm sticking out, he froze. Just stood there, staring. I didn’t say a word.

“So… you found them,” he muttered. His voice was low, almost sorrowful, like he didn’t want to believe what he was seeing.

“What?” I asked, confused. I had no idea what he meant.

“You found the other tenants of this apartment,” he said, turning to face me. “Every damn one of you complains about the noises in the walls. And I’ve never heard a thing. I even lived here for a week once—dead silence. But you people… always hearing things…”

That’s when it hit me. Bregger killed the previous tenants. He murdered them… and hid their bodies inside the walls.

“You… you killed them…” The words barely came out. I was in shock. I couldn’t believe what I was standing in front of.

“Yeah. And now I’ll have to kill you too.”

Before I could react, he lunged at me and wrapped his hands around my throat.

We both crashed to the floor. Fists. Kicks. Elbows. Choking. Anything we could throw, we did. The fight was pure chaos—fifteen minutes of hell, though it felt like only five. The adrenaline, the fear… it warped time itself.

I’d never thrown a punch in my life. But today…today I fought like a man possessed. Like my life depended on it. Because it did.

The fight ended when I managed to grab the sledgehammer. I swung it with everything I had. It smashed into his head. His skull exploded like a watermelon.

My hands wouldn’t stop shaking. I’d never killed anyone before. The feeling was horrible. Sickening. The only thing that kept me from completely falling apart was knowing I’d killed a monster. A serial killer. That thought, that I’d stopped him, was the only comfort I had. And even that didn’t feel like enough.

Then…the sound stopped. Just like that. Silence.

I realized then that those sounds were the voices of his victims. They were warning me. Telling me to run. Begging me to escape. I don’t know how that’s possible, or why only I could hear them.

I’m writing this while I wait for the police. I don’t know what’s going to happen to me—whether they’ll arrest me or believe me.

But one thing I do know: No matter what they say on the news, no matter what the headlines scream…you’re the only ones who now know the truth about what really happened here.
