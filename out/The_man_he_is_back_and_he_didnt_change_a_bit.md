For context, I live in Hampton, Virginia and am currently 63 years old. Ever since i was a kid i have been very religious and never really believed in ghosts/anything of that sort. 

Around 40 years ago, when i was 19 or 20, every now and then i would wake up at midnight to a strange feeling like that of being stared at. I didn't give it much thought and went back to sleep even though my gut always told me something was very wrong. 

On one particularly dark full moon night, i had a dream. It was not just any regular nightmare. It was long and inside, I knew it was real. It even felt like the dream WAS my real life in fact i still remember each and every detail about it like what i was wearing on my Mothers birthday, Where i partied on my graduation day who my wife was, her name, age etc. The dream was ahead of the real time and all the people in the dream like my family, friends were people who actually existed whom i would get to know later on in my real life.

After i got married in the dream, i started to notice weird things and started journaling everything out of the blue. My journals were like someone's who had been into journaling for years. I countinued to write journals for multiple years after getting married. So anyways, little weird things started taking place like crockery falling off the rack, my keys changing position slightly. My wife didn't give much thought but i sure felt something wrong. Eventually i started noticing someone or should i say something.

Wherever i went, be it a supermarket, My office, even my neighbourhood sometimes, I would see the same man atleast once a day. He was in his early 20s, very handsome. Usually one would not notice every person around them wherever they go but this man was different, the aura i felt around him, i cant explain till date. I might sound stupid for saying this but he felt strangely cold and DEAD. One winter, due to christmas the city was very crouded so i decided to take a alternate path.

The path was a very dense and eerie forest. My car was surrounded by mist and fog and it was hard to see around. Suddenly my car ran out of fuel and stopped. The strange thing was that i had got my fuel tank refilled on the same morning. It was definitely set up. 

I got out of my car to check if i had any spare fuel but i didnt. Just as i was about to call my wife to come and pick me up, I saw him. It was the same man. I felt his strange cold aura again but this time it was stronger, way stronger. 

I had a very strong adrenaline rush and every instinct in my body told me to run as fast as i could so i did. I couldn't breath and run as fast because of the weather. As i felt my lungs go cold i decided to stop and I wish i hadn't. 

As i turned back to see if the man was there, i felt the cold wind brush against me and he was in front of me. He was there, i knew it. I felt the cold aura again this time even stronger. I was too shocked and scared to move. I knew the thing in front of my was not human. Somehow i managed to slowly turn towards him and see his face, It was staring into my soul. I knew i couldn't run. My only option was to fight. 

As i moved my wrist, the man let out a primal scream and gripped my hands with extraordinary strength. In fact the thing was so strong my wrist bones had shattered just by his grip. I didn't feel much due to the cold and countinued screaming. The thing swiftly moved his neck and pierced my skin with his unhumanly sharp teeth. 

That was when i woke up. I usually forgot everything about my dreams as soon as i woke up but this time, i didn't. I was full of sweat and my clothes were visibly wet. I was very relieved that it was all just a dream or so i thought. After catching my breath i woke up, brushed my teeth and showered. As i came out, i saw a few books on my desk. They were unmistakably my journals. 

"This cant be true" i prayed. I swiftly opened the book with my hands trembling like a 90 year olds. It was the same journal with the same text, same story. It felt like i was in the dream once again. I decided not to tell this to anyone as no one would believe me. For a few days i couldn't live normally and all i thought about was the journals. After my school, i moved to Hampton and decided to leave my journals in my old home. 

After i moved, the strange dreams and the feeling of being watched had stopped. The town i had moved to was the same town in which my collage from the dream was. Every other collage had rejected me except for that collage. I met the same people and even my wife from the dreams in my collage. Thankfully nothing went like it did in the dreams. I met and wed a beautiful women and lived a happy life.

Fast forward to today, 40 years after the dream. I still think about the dream but rarely. 2 days ago i decided to visit Richmond again and ended up in a crowded market very close to my old neighbourhood. 

After these years, i didnt expect to be scared or see anything strange but i was wrong, very wrong. I was casually looking around and watching how things have changed while waiting for my wife to bring the food outside the mcdonalds, I saw it. My whole body went pale. It was the same man from the dream 40 years ago. He was staring at me. I felt his cold aura once again. His creepy grin gave me chills. He did not age a day. HIs clothes, his hair, his beard everything was the same as it was in the dream 40 years ago. I immediately went into mcdonalds, held my wife's hand and drove to Hampton as fast as i could.

I have not been able to sleep for 2 days and at this point, I dont even know if my life is real, I dont know if i am still 19 or if i ever woke up from the dream. Hell, i dont even know if i am alive.
