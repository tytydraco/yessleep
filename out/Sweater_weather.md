I live on the other end of Washington state. As annoying as it is you know exactly what I mean by that. I live near Spokane, WA. Eastside. You have to love the outdoors if you live here. Outside the city it's pretty rural. We have some exceptionally beautiful state parks and conservation areas. Hiking, camping, horseback riding, snowboarding, anything outdoorsy we have. I highly recommend taking part in some outdoor activities if you're ever here to visit. However, I don't recommend Riverside State Park. 

I went hiking there a few months ago and I had the strongest feeling of being watched I've ever experienced. I couldn't shake it. I only got about a mile in from the trailhead before I turned around. Something wasn't right and I wasn't sticking around to figure out what. But the feeling grew, and I'm a little embarrased to admit when I heard a noise in the underbrush I broke into a jog, and then a run. It was probably just a squirrel, it didn't sound large, but I was freaked out anyway. I reached the parking area and jumped into my car. I looked back towards the trail and there was nothing, but I still couldn't shake the feeling of being watched so I drove away. By the time I was a few yards down the feeling evaporated. I haven't felt it since, but I've never gone back there. 

And that's not really a scary story, but it's my story, and gives you some context. I don't want to admit I was that chickenshit on a very easy hike, not more than a few minutes from civilization, but I ask friends sometimes if they had ever had a bad feeling about Riverside State Park. Usually they'd ask what I was talking about, and I'd shrug and laugh and say, “I dunno, weird vibes,” and the conversation would move on. 

But yesterday, I was down at the bar with one of my buddies, Alan. He's more of a drinking buddy than a hiking buddy, but he is a good outdoorsman. I think he just prefers to drink with friends and hike alone. I asked him about Riverside State Park. He didn't ask what I meant, just gave me a long level look and said, “Have you?”

And normally I think I would have shrugged it off, but there was something about the way he said it, or maybe because I was a couple beers in, but I related to him my story as I explained it to you. “It's probably nothing, right? I just got spooked for some reason,” I said after I finished. 

He said, “Sometimes instinct is the only thing we have that can protect us. If it doesn't feel right, trust your gut. Respect it. If I get a feeling about a place, I pack up and go, doesn't matter if it's the middle of the night. Better to feel a little foolish tomorrow than be dead and feel nothing at all.”

It was a surprisingly grim take from a normally cheerful guy.

Of course I had to pry a little. Packed up in the dark? How often does he get weird vibes? 

He didn't like all the questions so he answered my original one about Riverside State Park instead. He still goes sometimes, but he stays alert and he doesn’t camp there.

His story is as follows, as best as I can remember.

\* \* \* 

I've been lots of times. I was doing my usual loop towards the equestrian area and I got this weird feeling like I was being watched. There is always the possibility you run into a bear. Or worse, a man (I'm kidding, I'm kidding). So I put my arms out and tried to walk as tall as possible and started humming a tune to myself. I'm about as hairy as a bear so I figured the humming meant it wouldn't mistake me for one and try to say hello. Haha. 

I still felt a pricking at the back of my neck, though, and I glanced back a few times but there was nothing. If anything the feeling grew.

I walked on a little farther and I saw a tree had fallen across the trail up ahead. It was leaning against another tree so the angle was pretty steep and the area over the trail was about at head height. If you were going to pass you'd duck under it, not climb over it. 

I stopped dead, heart racing, the way you do when you see when someone startles you. I saw a person lying facedown on the log, head pointed down towards the roots and feet up towards the canopy, which was a weird position to be in even if you were screwing around. It was too high up to be someone trying to climb over, they would have had to climb up the tree from off the side of the trail and then turn around and lay down on it. Their leg was twisted at a strange angle. What the hell were they doing? Was it a dead body?

After a second though my brain actually processed what it was seeing. I laughed because I realized someone must have thrown their sweater up there for some reason. Unexpected, but not scary. There was an arm and a hood visible. There was a branch jutting out from the tree where a leg would be, so the whole thing had the general shape of a person if you squinted.

I stopped for a second and put my hands on my knees, laughing and letting my heart slow down. 

Until I heard a sound coming from the tree. I looked up and the sweater was moving. Not like…not like cloth moving in the wind. Like, had arms and was moving.

I realized the feeling of being watched had never really gone away. In fact it was more intense than ever. I didn't like what was going on one bit. So I turned and started running. I didn't know what the sweater thing was, but I wasn't sticking around to find out. After a moment, I heard a thump behind me, way too loud to be a sweater falling. Way too loud. I didn't look. I just ran. I was pounding the ground with my feet, my heart was thudding in my chest, and I was gasping for air. But over all the racket I was making I could hear it behind me from time to time. Whipping a branch in its path, knocking a loose stone out of place.

I have pretty good reflexes I think because I left it a fair ways behind me when I bolted. But… it was gaining. I could tell. I was trying to pump my legs faster, throw myself forwards with every step, but there's only so much a person can do. Luckily the trails there are pretty clear and the area I was in didn't have any really treacherous stretches of tree roots that would sprain an ankle instantly at the speed I was going. But still, even at my top speed, it was gaining on me little by little.

I kept running. It was a harrowing couple of minutes. I could feel myself slowing as the adrenaline wore off. I was barely thinking but I regretted not having a weapon. I couldn't stop to pick up a stick. All I had besides my fanny pack was my windbreaker tied around my waist.

So I did the only thing I could do. I waited until the thing got closer. Close enough that I couldn't miss. And I pulled my windbreaker off and threw it at the thing's head. I don't know what I was expecting. To blind it, I guess. Distract it. It was a stupid plan. 

But the stupidest part is it worked. It stopped. I don't know what it was doing, I just turned around and ran. Ran as hard and as fast as I could. It was tough though because I was winded. 

I scared the shit out of a guy. I came barreling down the trail as he was coming up it. I screamed “Turn around, we gotta go, we gotta go,” and he turned and ran with me.

I slowed to jog at this point. I didn't hear it behind me and I was breathing hard.

“You see… anything… behind me?” I wheezed. 

“No,” the guy said, trotting along beside me. “What is it? A mountain lion?”

I just pumped my arms harder. I had a track coach in school who said that helps with running but I think he was full of shit because it didn't help at all. We ran until we got to the camping area, at which point I collapsed. I figured with this many people around I'd be safe. One of them would have a gun or, you know. They say you only have to outrun the slowest person in a group. I'm kidding. But seeing all the people made me feel normal. Like I had re-entered reality. 

The guy wandered off, and I lay flat on my back in the grass in a meadow catching my breath. I did overhear a weird conversation. A young mother was leading her kid along. The kid didn't want to go, but the mom said, “It's about to rain, we need to pack up all our stuff.”

I was staring up at the sky and it was perfectly clear. There wasn’t any rain forecasted either, I had checked before I came. I rolled my head to the side to get a view of the camp and there was a lot of activity. A lot of peole taking down tents. Not many setting up. It was unusual for the time of day and the time of year. If I had to guess, I kind of think everyone there felt spooked. 

The guy came back. He had begged a bottle of water off somebody and gave it to me. 

“Thanks, man,” I said. I downed half the bottle in one go.

“Weird vibe around here,” the guy said.

“Yeah.”

“What… what was out there?”

“I don't know,” I said. “But it scared the hell out of me.

He nodded as if that made sense. “Should we call someone?”

“I don't think so… I don't have much to tell them, really.”

I didn't even want to tell this guy, who had seen me in my fear and fury, and was at the camp now, that I'm pretty sure I was chased by an animate sweatshirt. I mean it sounded fucking ridiculous. At a police station it would sound even worse.

I haven't told anyone about it until now.

\* \* \* 

“Oh,” I said. We nursed our beers in silence. 

After a minute I asked, “So when you threw the sweater at it, you turned all the way around?”

“Yep.” He sighed. 

“So you saw it?”

“Yep.”

“What…what was it? I mean it couldn't have just been a sweater since it sounds like this thing had legs.”

“I don't know,” Alan said.

“Well, what did it look like?”

“I don't know,” he repeated. “When I try to remember it, all I remember is that goddamn sweater. Black, hood strings, front pocket. Totally nondescript sweatshirt but I remember it perfectly. When I try to remember who or what was wearing it… my memory gets fuzzy and it's hard to focus. I don't think it was… human. Or I guess I mean… earthly. I mean I don't think it was an alien, I just think… it's not a thing a person is supposed to see. Or maybe it's not a thing a person can see. I don't know why it picked a goddamn sweater.”

“To blend in?” I suggested, and we had a good laugh.

“I'll tell you what though, I think it's still out there, and I think somebody knows. They're closing the park this year and into next. Certain areas and certain times. I bet it's related.”

“Would you ever go back?” I asked.

“Oh, sure, I've been back a few times.”

“Really?”

“I mean, most of the time it's fine. If there are weird vibes I turn around and go home. Or to a different trail. Haven't run into anything since.”

“You're a braver person than me,” I said.

“I don't know about that,” Alan said. “I get pretty nervous sometimes, out of the blue. I never used to. Think I need to see a shrink about my anxiety?”

“Nah,” I said. “You seem fine to me.”

I gave Alan a lift home. There wasn't much to say after that story. As we drove in silence I started to get that feeling again. In the dark enclosed space of the car, with the streetlights flashing by few and far between, I kept imagining if a figure was behind us in the back seat. I kept flicking my eyes to the rear view mirror to make sure there was nothing there. I turned on the radio. We chatted a bit and then I was pulling up to his house. He got out and I watched him go inside. I caught a flutter of motion as I was pulling away. His neighbor had left a windbreaker draped over their porch railing. It was neon colored and caught the light as it stirred slightly in the wind.
