I’ve been lying here so long I’ve forgotten what it’s like to stand. I have no desire to, frankly. It’s a hassle, and I don’t need it anymore. Everything I have is within reach; I don’t even need to turn over or shift my weight. I only need to call for it, and it’s placed in my hand. 



It’s comfortable. I really don’t feel anything bad. Nobody has said anything about it in so long I wonder if they stopped seeing it. The smell used to be overwhelming, but we’ve all adapted to it. My mother used to gag when she walked in, but now she barely blinks. We spray the flies as soon as they come, so it’s harmless. In the odd instance when I flex a muscle, the smell intensifies, and then it’s quickly ignored. It’s funny how so many things can be willed out of existence. We all became much happier the moment we stopped trying to understand it. There are only so many circles your mind can run in until you stop. 



I’m still breathing. That’s the only thing that matters to them right now. 



I’ve come to the conclusion that the law of natural selection works slowly in modern civilization, but it tinkers away all the same. Some people are just not meant to live and grow. If no one died before their time, the world would be packed shoulder-to-shoulder, and we would become one united wall of useless flesh. I admire people who recognize their roles early in life. Many people are just meant to die young. I wish I’d realized that sooner. Still, natural selection is having its way with me. I don’t have to lift a finger; I’ll just keep living until I’m done. It’s the most comfortable way to go. 



Dad was pretty mad a week into it, but he gave up in disgust when he got close enough to rip me out of the sheets. Mom was crying, begging him not to hurt me. I cried the same tears. I didn’t know what was going on; I just knew it would hurt if he pulled me out of bed. It was agonizing when he sat on the foot of my bed to tuck me in. He sat up quickly when he realized the sheets were damp. 



“Have you been fucking pissing the bed? What the hell, Katie!”



I blinked vacantly at him. I didn’t really remember. 



The sheets are always wet, wet with the same sheen on my skin. It’s piss, it’s shit, it’s sweat, it’s flesh. Mom comes in every night to kiss me goodnight, pressing her lips to my forehead. She pets my face with a mournful smile, stroking my skin. Her fingers on my cheek draw out a dull, rough sound, like stroking cloth. I don’t know where the sheets end and I begin. We’re comfortable, composed of the same material. Cloth, skin, vomit, pillow fluff, blood. Sometimes I think my bed dreams instead of me. Maybe my brain has melted into it, too. We’re switching places, caught in the middle, bound as one. I hear the occasional low rumble beneath me when I haven’t eaten for long. I know that’s my stomach, stretched out and filling the mattress, growling as it hangs beneath my silken thighs. Mom can hear it from downstairs, and she brings me a nice, warm meal. She sets the hot plate at the foot of the bed, and I flinch as it scorches my skin.

Friends have sent their best regards. I talk to them on the phone every day. I never run out of phone battery because it stays plugged in next to me, my bed, at all times. It’s convenient. A modern corded phone that I can watch movies and play games on. Dad hates being powerless. He’ll stand in the doorway and watch me, occasionally asking if I’m ready to get up. 



“No.” I say. And he cries with so much rage in his eyes. I know why. I felt the same as him a year ago when this all started, but I’m comfortable. Not happy, comfortable. 



It’s really, really easy to die willingly, even if you don’t want to pull the trigger. You can take your time. You don’t have to die today; you just have to decide you will die. It can take months, years, or decades, but it’s by your hand. It takes a lot of the pressure off of suicide. You don’t have to die now, but you don’t have to live either. 



I can feel my breathing getting slower by the day. The mattress rises and falls with each endless inhale and exhale. I press a palm to my thigh, squeezing it, and my fingers make a pale indent that takes several seconds to fill out. I’m so soft, comfortable. That’s what people say whenever I send selfies. I guess some men are so desperate for a tit in their hand that they don’t care if it’s memory foam. I’m cute. I’m soft. I can send a nude photo from the comfort of my own endless body, and that is enough for both parties. I don’t need to change. People stopped caring when they realized I didn’t. Desperation to help is only as strong as the willingness of the supposed victim. 



I’m typing this out while watching a movie in a second window. My time is probably approaching soon. I wonder how they’ll move my body when it’s over. Will they take apart the bed, splitting it down the middle while my entrails and years’ rotten waste gush out of the springs and fluff? Will the paramedics pass out from the smell my rotting body has accumulated over the years? Will the story break out, and will people laugh at how worthless human beings like me should have tried harder? I wonder if I’ll go viral. I don’t care much for the people who will mourn me. Probably because I’m tired of the useless 'warm regards' and 'get well soon' cards I’m sent. I know that even my parents will breathe a sigh of relief when the last of me is scooped up into body bags. I’m not bitter, I’m not relieved, I’m not much of anything. I’ll be the same dead as I was alive. 



Comfortable.
