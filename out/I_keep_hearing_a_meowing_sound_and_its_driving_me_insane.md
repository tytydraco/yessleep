Hello, my names Matthew elliows 
I'm not too sure why I'm writing this down, I ain't much of a writer to be honest so not exactly sure what I'm doing so here goes nothing,
About 2 hours ago, I started hearing a small meowing noise, at first I thought it was my cat, maybe he was hungry? But he ended up being asleep on the sofa so I got confused and started questing where it was coming from
I eventually just brushed it off as either Mt neighbours or hell maybe a cat was outside my house and it was aggressively loud 
Either way I'll keep ya'll posted

Update: so it's been a day now, pretty sure it's gotten louder and crap..
It's kinda freaking me out a bit 
It's still not to much of a stretch that maybe it's just my neighbours or a cat outside I don't know, there has to be a explanation
Right?

Update 2: so it's been a few hours more it definitely got louder so I don't know what the hell to do? 
Am I going crazy or something??
Guess my friend was right, I do spend wayyy to much time around my cat, to the point I've started imaging his meowing constantly- 
Ima try seeing if it's my neighbours and then check around my house a few times I'll update later on.

Update 3: so my neighbours don't have any pets.
And I checked my house 5 times and it's just gotten louder, what the hell is happening??
I'm gunna try see a doctor about it or a therapist idk just someone, it's starting to creep me out a bit, this ain't normal right? 
I don't think it is anyway I also asked my girlfriend while she was over if she could hear anything, she didn't hear it at all so yeah, maybe I am going crazy???

Update 4: it's been a week. 
Why is it all so loud? 
It's like it's meowing right into my ears I can't sleep anymore 
It's like airhorns go off whenever I close my eyes for a second 
Why won't it let me sleep??
I looked into therapy my girlfriend is concerned about me and my hearing, she thinks I'm losing my hearing or something, I haven't told her yet.
How would I even tell her? 
"Hey ash, I keep hearing meowing in my ears constantly and I'm going crazy because of it!"
But anyways, I'll update you all in another week or so? 
Maybe..

Update 5: it's been 3 weeks since the meowing started. 
Therapy isn't helping, doctors aren't helping 
So I've decided to go to a spiritualist, maybe I've  been cursed or some shit? 
Only problem is who? And why I love cats and I love people, but this is torcher what did I do wrong? 
WHY ME?

update 6: it's been a month. 
It's so loud I'm surprised my ears aren't bleeding, I can't do this much longer 
What do I do? Nothing has helped.
I can't go outside. 
I'll just stay inside trying to drown the noise out.
It seems better to get neighbours complaining then have nothing to drown in out, if only for a moment. 
God please just make me deaf.
I'd do anything to make it stop
Please, please make it stop

Update 7: my name is Matthew elliows
I'm 24
And this will be my last update before I find a way to deafen myself 
I can't live like this much longer.
It's been about 6 weeks now, I haven't gone out I've just been getting delivery, I work from home so it was easy.
But I ended up snapping at my cat
I killed my cat with a fork to the throat.
Oh god the blood, why was it so bloody.
I'm so sorry lori you were a good kitty it wasn't your fault, it wasn't your fault kitty.
I'll be back with my last update after this
I pray to God this will save me my Sanity 
God please let this work, I beg of you.. 

Last update: it worked! 
It hurts like he'll but I can't hear it anymore 
God its over, thank the lord its over I couldn't of survived any longer if it'd of kept going
It was worth it, I'm going to start crying the sweet sweet sound of silence, 
Wait.
I can't hear 
Why can I hear?
I can hear the meowing..
No nonononononoNoNoNONONO
NO I WONT LET YOU TAKE ME BACK 
NO I WONY GO 
That's it.
I'll have to stab myself. 
Goodbye cruel world, goodbye people 
Let it be over I can't do it anymore, I CANT DO IT ANYMORE
