“We shouldn’t be out here after dark.” Beau said, looking around us with anxiety already wavering in his voice. The sun was beginning to sink over the treetops, casting long shadows from the branches above. “Something lives in these woods.”

”That’s a bunch of bullshit.” I told him, casting my rod back into the stream. The Fall air had a little bite to it, wind whistling through the trees with a shrill tone as it went. “There’s nothing out here other than snakes and squirrels. Just get the fire started.”

”That’s not true! Micky saw a fox one time!” Beau shouted back, gathering more sticks together for the small fire he was building. There hadn’t been a bite all day in the stream, so we weren’t going to have anything to cook on it unless something came up quick. “They say the Mushroomhead wanders out here at night.”

”The hell is that?” I asked again, pulling my line back in before casting out once more. 

“The Mushroomhead! They say he was some old war vet that lived along the stream. Got all messed up from the trainyard dumping chemicals in it.” He answered back, grabbing piles of dead leaves and shoving them under the pile of twigs and broken branches he had made. The flint and steel of his firestarter sparked, steadily catching the pile and beginning to smolder. “Apparently he’s pretty territorial.”

”You gotta stop reading those comics.” I said, feeling a tug on my line as it floated down stream. I pulled, despreately trying to pull the line in, hoping there was at least something edible on the end. Instead, my rod was snatched from my hands, flying into the water and zipping off downstream, around a small bend in the way. “Dammit! My rod! I’ll be right back!”

”Be quick…” Beau said behind me. The shoreline of the stream was rocky, with dead leaves crunching under foot as I plodded through, desperately trying to find my fishing rod in the dimming light. The shadows cast from the trees made it hard to pick out what was happening, but eventually I could see the bright yellow plastic of the rod plop out of the stream, being pulled by something into the trees ahead.

”Hello!” I shouted, wondering if some animal had grabbed it. As I approached where it lay on the ground, it jumped forward again, pulled by an unseen force. I jumped forward, seizing at it before it could be pulled once more. “Gotcha!”

Before I could tell what was happening, something came running out of the woods at me, bellowing with a guttural roar as it did. It was on two legs, though humanoid was giving it a lot of credit. Where the head should be was just… a giant dome, like a mushroom top right over its shoulders. The top looked burned, stretched and cut over jagged bone with sparse hair growing in patches.

I stabbed it with the rod, feeling my heart race as I left it behind, instead running away screaming for my life as the thing began chasing after me. My feet slipped and slid on the wet leaves on the streambed, desperately trying to get away as it gained on my heels. 

“Beau! Beau! Run!” I shouted ahead as I went around the bend in the stream. He was still standing over the fire, blowing on the embers as it was just starting to catch on the twigs and branches. I looked behind me as my legs kept pumping me further, seeing the Mushroomhead still right on my heels, a mouth full of rotting, jagged teeth looming against the pale, shriveled skin. “Dammit, GO!!”

I saw him look up and lose every last bit of color he had in the setting sun. Before I knew it, I was on his heels, leaping over the fire and kicking up ashes behind me, desperately hoping it would scare the Mushroomhead off. 

I honestly don’t know if it worked or not, because I didn’t look back again until we had cleared the tree line and were back onto our street, houses lining either side as the sun set, casting thin shadows from the street signs. Beau was bent over at the knees, desperately trying to catch his breath as I fell to the sidewalk, hands holding my chest.

I still haven’t told mom I lost my fishing rod. Doubt she would believe me if I told her the truth, but there’s no way I’m about to ask her for money to buy another one. Not like I’m fishing in the stream anymore, anyway.

I swear when I look outside though, I can see the treeline, and something is just… right there. Right beyond the edge of the light, watching me… I’m not going back out in the woods again. Beau said he feels the same thing, even on the other side of the [street](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/AlcqwrRlAp).
