“Attention, teachers and students, recess is canceled today due to crows, that is all.”

There was a collective awww from the students but that wasn't what had gotten my attention.

Had the principal just said Crows? Like the birds, I asked myself as I told my third graders we would play Heads Up Seven Up. As they got set up to play the game, I picked up the phone and called a friend of mine in the other class. Kayla had been helping me integrate into the flow of Jefferson Moore Elementary since I'd arrived here at the start of the year, and I could hear the smile on her face as she answered the phone.

“Mrs. Swearington's Class,”

“Crows?” I asked without preamble, “Did I hear that right?”

“You did. The school has a code for Crows and you should definitely follow it.”

I was quiet for a moment, trying to find a good response to that, until she said my name like she might have lost me.

“I mean, are crows different in Ohio? Cause we had crows in Maine too and we didn't close down the playground for them.”

She was quiet for a moment and I could hear the sound of a very heated argument going on over what I assumed was a game of heads up seven up. Great minds thought alike, it seemed.

“Crows here are a little different. I can't really talk about it right now. Meet me after school for drinks and I'll fill you in. Don't worry, though. Crow days only usually last a couple of days.”

“A couple of days?” I said in disbelief, but that was when someone started crying and Kayla said she had to go.

She hung up and I was left with more questions than answers.

It wasn't that much of an inconvenience, I supposed. My kids, despite being eight and nine, were pretty well-behaved. I had very few fights, very little beyond the usual drama that surrounded little kids, and most of them were good friends who helped each other. My own game of heads up seven up was full of more laughing than arguments, and as recess ended, we started Math and worked toward lunch. Good kids or not, it was still going to be a long day without recess. Even the best-behaved kids get stir-crazy when they can't blow off steam on the playground. Luckily, we had Gym today so they could get their zoomies out in the fully enclosed gym building instead. We walked across the school, me leading the line as we headed for the gymnasium, and I couldn't help but glance at the playground as we walked past.

Even as an adult, I thought the new playground looked pretty cool. They had replaced all the old metal equipment with colorful plastic and it made me wish I could take my tie and my sensible shoes off and just go play with them for a while. There were five large, colorful structures, teeter totters, slides a plenty, a four-square court, some of those spring animals, a big sandbox, a basketball court, and lots of shady places to sit and visit with friends. It was an amazingly inviting place, but today it looked like something out of a Stephen King novel. 

The crows had taken over every inch of the playground, and they lay thick upon the land. They watched us as we passed, looking affronted to see people so close. I understood now, it was a little intimidating to see that many crows assembled. They called a group of crows a murder, and the name made sense now. They looked capable of anything as they sat there glaring at us. They looked capable of hurting even me in such numbers, and I turned my back on them with a real effort.

They were still there when the bell rang to release students for the day, and I noticed that no one went anywhere near the playground as they headed for home or the bus.

Kayla shot me a text as I was walking to my car to let me know that she'd had to go home with stomach problems, but that she would meet with me soon to let me know the story behind the crows.

“Just don't do anything dumb in the meantime. I don't want you to get in over your head ;).”

I rolled my eyes at her text but decided I would toe the line until I had more information. I had to admit that something about that group of crows had spooked me, and I suddenly didn't like the idea of just going out there and scaring them off. I didn't know how they would react, and I wasn't in a big hurry to find out. I had joked that we had crows where I was from, but I didn't think I had ever seen crows like this. 

I must have been thinking about them as I lay down to sleep because I dreamed about them that night.

I was walking onto the playground, the crows sitting around me and staring in disapproval. Everything beyond the playground was in mist like I was standing in a fog bank, and the deeper I went into the playground, the more crows there seemed to be. In the center of the playground was a merry-go-round, the old metal ones that often injured the children who went to play on them. Standing in the center of it was a man, slowly rotating with the motion of the thing. He had his back to me, and I saw that he wore a coal-black coat with a high, dark mantle. His top hat was lined with feathers and shiny trinkets, and his boots were black and thick. He was rotating slowly, the old engine of destruction squealing as it turned ever so slowly. The crows were looking at him, their beady eyes drawn to him, and as he spun, I became afraid. I didn't think I wanted this man to look at me. I thought that if he looked at me something terrible might happen, but I was powerless to look away. He just spun like a ballerina in a music box, and as he came around, I saw one glittering eye before I woke up in a cold sweat.

There was another warning about the crows during the morning announcements, but it was hardly needed. We had all seen them as they perched on the playground equipment as we came to school that day. I was working the pickup line that morning, and the reactions of the children weren't what drew my attention. The children were disappointed but understanding. No, it was the reaction of the adults as they caught sight of the crows. There were some transplants, like me, who looked at it like an oddity, but it was the local parents that really caught my eye. They looked at the playground like a source of childhood trauma and many of them made sure to tell their children not to go to the playground under any circumstances.

“Keep a close eye on her,” one mother said to me as her kindergartner walked inside, her pink coat making her stand out amongst the sea of children, “I had hoped they wouldn't come back this year. Damn him,” she whispered and then looked at me like she had said too much before driving off in a controlled hurry.

We settled in for today's lessons, but you could tell that the mood was muted. They didn't have gym to look forward to today, the extracurricular was Music, and they knew that there would be no real outside activity today. I hated it for them, and when I called Kayla at about ten thirty, my texts going unseen, I was in for another surprise. The woman who answered said that Ms. Swearington was out today, and might be out for the rest of the week.

“Poor dear. She caught that bug that's going around. I hope she didn't leave it behind when she was here yesterday, I hear it's nasty.”

I didn't even have lunch with my friend to look forward to, it seemed, and I settled in for a long day.

As the class played hide and seek during indoor recess, I noticed that one of my students was still at her desk. Lisa was coloring up a storm, really putting swirls on her paper, and I came up to check what she was drawing. She looked absolutely focused on what she was doing, showing no interest in the other students or their games. It was odd to see that kind of focus in a kid her age, and she jumped a little when I came up behind her and tapped her shoulder.

“Whatcha,” I started, but when I looked at the page it took my breath away.

She had drawn the playground from my dream perfectly, complete with the man in the dark cloak and top hat. He was standing on the merry-go-round, arms extended to the sky, and the crows were flying all around him. The picture was way too detailed for someone her age, much too good for someone not even in middle school, and when she looked back at me, she asked if I had seen him.

“Who?” I asked though I knew who she meant.

“The Crow Count,” she said, matter-of-factly as if it was something that everyone knew.

“I haven't,” I lied, picking up the picture and getting a better look, “Who is he?”

“Mommy says not to talk about him,” Lisa said, looking guilty as if realizing she shouldn't have been drawing him either.

“I won't tell,” I said as I put the page back on her desk, “is he a friend of yours?”

“No,” Lisa said and she sounded afraid of the idea that someone might think he was friends with her, “The Crow Count isn't anyone's friend. He brings the crows here, at least that's what Mommy told me. She said I must never go into a big group of crows or the Crow Count will take me away with the murder.”

Hearing someone so young say these things made me cold all over again, but I just patted her arm and said that was very interesting. It was the most normal thing in the world to her, apparently, and I didn't want to draw attention to the fact that this was my first time hearing about it. I left her to her coloring, telling my students they had about five minutes left for indoor recess before going back to my desk. I Googled Crow Count and Crows in Ohio, but I didn't get much. Crows in Ohio brought up memes, because of course it did, but Crow Count brought up only a single entry. It was an old Germanic legend about a ruler of crows who sometimes took children to feed his flock or young girls to be his bride. Neither were ever seen again, but it was the excuse for telling children to avoid large groups of crows, something associated with battlefields and death. 

The depiction, something taken from an old storybook, was very familiar.

A courtly fellow in a tall hat with feathers and a dark cloak.

I clicked off o fit, feeling my stomach tie itself in a knot, and began geography. 

I was still thinking about it at the end of the day as the bell rang and everyone headed for home. The playground was still full of crows, and it was hard not to imagine that I could see someone on the playground among them. Could that be the hatted gentleman, the Crow Count? I didn't dare look too long, but I was beginning to get a little tired of this. Two days with no outdoor recess was beginning to take a toll on my students. I didn't know what we'd do if this went on much longer, but it appeared we'd never find out.   

After a night spent dreaming about crows and the man in the tall hat, I arrived at school to find a group of adults standing around the outskirts of the playground. The crows were giving them an unhappy look, looking like bouncers preparing to kick them out, and I approached the group to see what was going on. The teachers looked at me guiltily, not seeming to be sure what to say, until Mr. Simmonson, the fifth-grade English Teacher, stepped up and said one of his students had gone in there.

“Samantha Parks was walking across the track, heading for her first class, when she stopped and looked at the playground. It was like something had entranced her, and she walked slowly away from the track and headed into the playground.”

“Has anyone gone in after her?” I said, afraid the birds might hurt her.

The others shook their heads and I felt a rage bubble in me as I dropped my bag and walked toward the playground.

Crows or no crows, I was going to let a student get injured without trying to help them.

Mr. Simmonson caught my arm as I tried to go in, “He won't like it if you disturb him.” he whispered, looking ashamed as he said it.

“Who?” I asked, squaring my shoulders and looking at him darkly, “The Crow Count?”

He looked surprised that I knew the name, but when he let me go, I walked straight onto the playground and away from the pack of cowards.

The crows watched me, hostility in their beady eyes, but they made no move to attack me as I walked among them. It was exactly like my dream. The crows covered everything, their numbers having risen in the three days they had been here. Their murder was huge, the equipment looking like a giant crow as they sat on every empty surface. It was a mass of wings and feathers and beady black eyes, and I walked within that heaving black sea of avians.

I came to the center far too soon.

He was standing on a merry-go-round, the metal battered and the paint faded and chipped. It looked as if it had been moved through time, and he stood in the middle of it as it turned ever so slowly. The crows guarded him, leaning closer as if making ready to charge me if I tried to attack him, and he seemed utterly at ease. He was dressed in the same black hat with feathers around the brim, the same black cloak, dark as a raven wing, and the same leather boots that looked like they had walked across the ages to be here. He looked like he could have known Vlad Tepes, could have watched an original Shakespeare play, could have wielded a knife as it slew Caesar. He was ageless, an engine of destruction as much as the one he stood upon, and as he turned, I saw the girl kneeling on the hot top. 

She was tall for ten, looking like a woman more than a child, and when I took a step toward her, the man spoke.

“Do not touch what belongs to the crows.”

I stopped, despite myself, and as I looked up I finally got a look at him. His face was young, his hair a perfect salt and pepper, and his features were sharp and angular. He looked like a painting in a museum, a man out of time, and as he came fully around he looked like nothing so much as a demon in human form. His eyes, however, were what drew me the most. They sparkled, the cornea like the faucets of the gem. No wonder the crows followed him. His eyes were something they would desire above all other things, and I wondered if they would take them from him when his life finally came to an end.

Somehow, despite being captivated by this strange man, I found the courage to speak. 

“She does not belong to you. She is of this school, and under its protection, under MY protection.”

The man sneered, “You would dare tell me what treasures I may take? This is my domain, and I take what I want.”

“Not today,” I said, and the girl shook off whatever spell she had been under and began to hyperventilate.

“Where...where...where am I?” she asked and I tried my best to calm her down.

That seemed to be what the crows were waiting for. They flew at us suddenly, buffeting the two of us with their wings and raking at us with their claws. Crows may not seem very formidable, but they're bigger than you think, and there were so many of them that all I could do was pick a direction and run. As long as it was away from the Crow Count, I didn't give a damn where it went. I pushed the girl in front of me, leading her through the throng of crows and getting pretty cut up in the process. I heard her scream as I covered her with my body, putting a hand over my face as I tried to save my eyes. We were running blind, bumping into things and rebounding back before we chose a different way. I felt like we would never make it out, that the crows would bury us under their mass or just carry us away. I didn't think I'd ever see my class, my students, or anything ever again, and that was when I stumbled out of the cloud and out of the playground.

I lay on the ground, covering myself, but the crows were gone. I was breathing heavily, reaching for the girl to reassure her, but she wasn't there. I looked around, trying to find her, but she was just gone. Where was she? Had she escaped? What had...but that was when I heard a massive push of wings and the raised voice of the murder. 

As I looked up, they all took flight at once, ascending into the sky in a great wave of black wings. In the middle of the cloud, held between the claws of many, many crows, were a pair of people that were soon lost amongst the cloud. One in a tall hat and cloak and another in the uniform our students wear. All I could do was watch them go, the tears coming as the murder took flight and left our playground behind.

The other teachers came up then, helping me to my feet as they took me to the office.

The principal was expecting me, and she told me to take a seat as the nurse came in to treat the multiple cuts and abrasions.

“I'm sorry you had to learn about it this way. It's why we don't often hire outsiders, they don't understand, and it gets many of them killed, or worse.”

I had a thousand questions, but I was in shock, and I could not vocalize any of them.

“The Crow Count is a part of the town's history. He's something that has always existed and always will. He comes, he takes, he leaves. In the years he does not take, we celebrate. In the years when he does, we mourn. That's why we have the Crow Warnings, why we teach our kids to be on their guard, and why the parents are so fearful. We know he will take if we give him the chance. There is nothing we can do about it. The Crow Count is old and clever, and nothing will stop him. Best to accept it, he never takes more than we can afford.”

I wondered if the parents I saw consoling each other as I went to leave would agree that it had been a price they could afford.

I'm sitting in my apartment now, and I'm three sheets to the wind.

I don't know if I can keep teaching here, knowing that the Crow Count will be back again, but I don't know what else I would do. I love the job and I love the kids, and if I can keep them safe, then don't I owe it to them to stay? Also, I want to know more about this thing. I want to know what it's here and how it came to be here.

Also, I want to know why it takes them and what it does with them once it has them.

Above all else, I want to know how we can stop this from happening, and stop the crows from stealing what is most precious to us.
