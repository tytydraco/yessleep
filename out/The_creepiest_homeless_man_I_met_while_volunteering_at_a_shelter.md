This story occurred several years back. My aunt managed a homeless shelter in the Las Vegas area and every so often they were short staffed, so I would volunteer regularly to help when needed.

As part of my volunteer work, I interacted directly with members the homeless community, and as one might imagine, there was quite the cast of diverse characters that would surface. We had our share of “regulars” who were the familiar faces, but being in Las Vegas, we also had many folks just traveling through. We never turned anyone away who needed help, and we never cast judgement on any human being no matter what their story.

Despite so many rough folks coming through, there is one man that always stayed with me. One night while I was doing the usual volunteering, a homeless man entered seeking assistance. He looked really beat down, he smelled really bad, had long greasy hair and soulless dark brown eyes. But he was wearing alligator skin boots and wearing what I believe was a Rolex watch (or similarly expensive watch) and he was also carrying latest iPhone. This is quite unusual because most people we come across have already pawned or sold their valuable items to help make ends meet. Also, appearance-wise, he definitely stood out from a crowd and was like nobody I had ever seen before.

We chatted for a little bit and this man was so unusual. He told me that he was a famous activist who travels the country fighting powerful battles. He told me he has works with celebrities and Grammy winners. He told me a lot of other things, but one thing I remember specifically is he mentioned he partnered with Erin Brockovich on some sort of activist crusade. This was extremely odd, most people who visit our shelter are straightforward with what they need, but this man just kept talking and talking about his “accomplishments” despite nobody asking.

Everything about this man was unusual, from his appearance to his story. He is far from a "typical" visitor. He was also extraordinarily confident and well-spoken. So much so that it gave me the creeps. His charisma came across as very dark and twisted.

Our interaction was brief, and we were able to get him the assistance he needed. Before parting ways, he asked for my personal contact information so he could send me more information about his activism work. Without batting an eye I responded with a lie: "I'm sorry, volunteers aren't allowed to give out any contact information to visitors, it's a new policy the shelter has." I don't know what came over me. This response was very uncharacteristic of me, as I'm a terrible liar and people often get anything they want from me. We parted ways and I never saw him again.

After he left, I Googled his name, and good Lord. He is not an activist by any stretch of the imagination. I discovered a trail of police reports, court records, and a dozen restraining orders. He is a very prolific homeless cyber predator that travels the country using his cell phone to stalk and harass anyone and everyone. The theory is he is a wandering psychopath who lures people in, then gets some sort of sadistic pleasure from destroying their lives. He's even stalked a filmmaker for 10+ years that [the filmmaker made a full-length documentary about the guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kbkysPTnHc).

I am so glad I listened to my instincts. I hope to never cross paths with this man again.
