We needed a lot of money, fast. I told Colin and Genevieve that our only hope was to help each other. I figured our best bet was another video and another crowdfunding campaign. After all, Genevieve was a genius when it came to social media (if nothing else). 

So we came up with a plan. We set up a new KrowdFundMe and called it “Save Genevieve”. 

Then the three of us went to the local homeless shelter in town. There, Genevieve recorded a new “inspirational” video where she claimed to have a rare, fatal condition and needed money for an expensive treatment—which, to be fair, was sort of true.

“The only way I can get get out of bed in the morning,” said Genevieve, her eyes full of tears, “is by giving back.” Then she handed out hundred dollar bills to all the people staying at the shelter.

It was gross and exploitative. But Genevieve had the magic touch when it came to this stuff. You don’t get 200,000 Instagram followers without knowing what people want to see. Sure enough, this video started to spread, just like the first one. And concerned people started to donate to the “Save Genevieve” KrowdFundMe. 

Colin and I did try to find Tristan. We hoped to somehow change his mind, convince him to do the right thing. But he wasn’t at his apartment. He wasn’t picking up his phone. It seemed he’d just vanished. We watched the news and checked social media, halfway wondering if we’d learn that Abel Fryst had gotten to him first 

I did find an old  article from ten years earlier—a feel-good story from a local paper about a soldier, Staff Sergeant Abel Fryst, who was returning to to his wife and baby daughter in North Carolina after overseas deployment. 

It was hard to imagine the man in that story being the same one we’d met by the side of the road. A little bad luck and Abel’s life into tipped into the abyss. That’s how it is for so many of us.

Luckily, the “Save Genevieve” KrowdFundMe was going strong. The total passed $156,400, which was enough money to save one of us. But we were in this together. And at this rate it was it was looking like we might all be spared. 

But this was the moment when some clever online sleuth put together that the guy in Genevieve’s first video was the same one who froze to death near her college campus. And the truth—that Genevieve and her friends stiffed the guy, a veteran no less!— started to spread online. They even folded Emily’s death into the narrative. Obviously she couldn’t live with the guilt of what we’d done.

Suddenly, instead of inspirational heroes, we were all monsters. This is when the death threats started rolling. First it was social media. Then email. Then phone calls from anonymous numbers in the middle of the night telling us to kill ourselves. 

Of course, people began to immediately cancel their “Save Genevieve” donations. Before any of us could withdraw any money, the total dipped back down below $156K. It looked like it was heading to zero. 

This is when Genevieve panicked. She said she was going for a walk. Instead she stepped out into the night. She went straight to the parking lot, got in her car, and drove out of town.

Her plan was to run, to leave Colin and me behind to die. But you can’t outrun the bad things you’ve done. You can’t outrun Abel Fryst. 

Around 2 AM, they found her car in the woods a few miles outside of town, burning by the side of the road. The police report said there were tire marks on the pavement, like she’d seen someone or something in the road and tried to swerve. 

Her vehicle hit a tree at 60 miles an hour, they said. Genevieve was flung through the windshield and—here they couldn’t quite explain the physics—somehow she’d ended up on top of the car, her corpse burning like a Viking funeral pyre. The impact had cleanly severed her head from her body. Improbably, it had landed on her lap. 

Colin and I were completely terrified now. I checked the “Payback” KrowdFundMe and saw that it was  at $156,400 of $782,000. One of the two “You Live” rewards had been claimed. It had to be Tristan. The motherfucker was alive after all. 

The next day we managed to track Tristan down. Turns out he’d been hiding at a fancy hotel in the next town over, instead of his apartment. We asked him, again, for our share of the money and he just shook his head and stared at the floor.

He told us he’d blown it all. Dumb purchases. Sports betting. Online poker. Crypto. He used the last of it to make that $156K donation and save his own skin. 

I was furious. But Colin was even angrier at the betrayal. But somehow I stopped him from doing anything rash.  

Tristan didn’t matter now because the money was gone. Colin and I were fucked. We somehow needed to come up with another $620,000 to pay back what was taken. 

Another crowdfunding video was out of the question; we were despised online. People were already posting about how happy they were that celebrating Genevieve was dead. 

Colin was starting to unravel. He was drunk all the time now. He thought every shadow, every creak of the floorboards, was Abel Fryst come to hack him to pieces. After Genevieve’s death, he was too scared to set foot outside.

But I talked him down. Tried to get him to think rationally. There was still one “You Live” reward left. If we worked together, maybe we could somehow come up with $156,400. At least, one of us could be be saved. 

“But the other person’s still gonna owe $470,000”, said Colin. “That person’s dead for sure.”

“We’ll cross that bridge when they come to it,” I said. 

I didn’t have have the answer but I hoped I’d think of something. Selfishness is what got us into this situation, I wanted to believe that selflessness would get us out. 

Colin took a swig of bourbon and wiped his eyes as he told me I should claim the last “You Live” Reward. 

“That’s the smart move ,” he said. “You’re the strong one. I’m weak. I’m losing it. I’m… I’m not going to make it to the end.”

He broke down again. And deep down I knew he was right. He was weak. Which is why I knew we had to save him first. 

&#x200B;

So the first thing we did was max out Colin’s credit cards (Mine, of course, were maxed out long ago). Next I coached him on the right things to say to take out a quickie high interest personal loan. This would be the first of several he’d apply for. 

Together we risked a trip to local pawn shop where Colin and I sold everything of value that we owned: Colin’s guitar. My aunt Helen’s engagement ring, both our school computers. Everything. 

With my help, Colin tapped out every resource at his disposal. He swallowed his pride and begged every friend and every relative. Some agreed to lend him the money. Others told him never to call again.

Colin even convinced his mom and dad to sell the restaurant that they’d they'd owned for the last 30 years.

We did all of this and this and it wasn’t enough. Colin was still $4,000 short of the $156,400 he needed. Mentally, he was a wreck now. Constantly drunk to the point of incoherence. Crying all the time. Yelling at things I couldn’t see. Colin was sure he was going to die any second now. 

But I had one trick left, one as yet untapped revenue stream. I accepted a TaskRabbit gig from a woman I often did odd jobs for. She was a professor’s widow who lived alone in a big, old house on Freeman Road. She was a kind woman who always told me I reminded her of her daughter. 

While she left me alone in an upstairs bedroom to install a new electrical outlet, I rifled through her jewelry box and snatched a handful of the most expensive-looking pieces. 

Though what I’d stolen was probably worth five times as as much, I was only able to get $4200 for it at the pawn shop. Still, it was enough. We had the money. 

We opened the Payback Krowdfundme page. In the donation amount field, Colin typed in $156,400. More money than I’d ever seen in my life. Colin he took a deep breath. 

“You sure?” he asked.

I nodded. And I held his hand as he clicked the “Donate” button and claimed the final “You Live” reward. 

We’d done it. We’d saved his life. Tears started to streem from Colin’s eyes as we kissed.

With a horrendous crash, the door to Colin’s apartment exploded inward. It had been shattered by a blow from Abel Fryst’s entrenching tool. He strode into the room and swung at me. The blow left a wide gash across my forehead. If I hadn’t dodged out out of the way 

I rolled across the bed as another blow from the tool cleaved the headboard clean in two. Colin tried to hold him back but Abel’s strength was as irresistable as rolling glacier. He shoved Colin to the ground with his off-hand, and came at me. 

I squeezed out the window and onto the fire escape. Colin’s apartment was on the the second story so, instead of climbing down, I jumped. I tried to roll as I hit the snowy courtyard below, praying I wouldn’t break my legs or my neck. 

Nothing broken. But I’d sprained my ankle badly. Still I was up on my feet in a moment, half-hobbling, half-sprinting, barefoot, through the darkened streets. 

My lungs burned with cold winter air. But I didn’t stop to catch my breath until I made it to the little footbridge that crossed the river that runs through town. 

I turned to look over my shoulder. Of course, I saw him. 

In the glare of a distant streetlight, he trudged forward, cold, relentless, unforgiving. The entrenching tool gleamed in his hand. 

With my twisted ankle, I couldn’t outrun him. But maybe I could still get away? I took a deep breath and I flung myself over the railing and into the freezing river thirty feet below. 

The last thing I remembered was seeing Abel Fryst on the bridge. He watched as I was swept downriver and sank under the icy, black water.
