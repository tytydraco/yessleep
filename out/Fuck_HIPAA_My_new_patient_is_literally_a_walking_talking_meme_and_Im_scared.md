In September 1934, textile workers at Chiquola Mill in South Carolina went on strike in as part of the much larger United States Textile Workers Strike.



On September 6, their strike was violently broken when the mayor — who also happened to be the mill superintendent — ordered armed strikebreakers to fire on the picket lines. According to records, dozens of strikers were injured and seven were killed.



These records are incorrect. A total of eight strikers were killed.



However, this eighth individual did not stay dead. 



Approximately seven hours after death, this individual woke up and proceeded to wreak havoc on the police and strikebreakers. While none were killed, several were injured to the point of disability. Reportedly, he told one individual, “I really should kill you, but I’m just a common man and it’s against my morals to kill another common man, even one who doesn’t believe he’s common.”



When authorities attempted to apprehend the perpetrator, he proceeded to severely injure three additional officers and successfully escaped.



All subsequent efforts to identify and locate him failed. These efforts were substantial, because this individual was a target of interest to the United States government.



This is because the perpetrator in question has been documented at length as an inciting, antagonistic, organizing presence at every major labor strike in the history of the United States.



Given the significant span of time between the country’s first major labor dispute and Chiquola Mills, government officials operated under the assumption that they were dealing with a family of domestic anarchists who passed their ideology from parent to child, generation to generation.



Given the severe tensions historically caused by major labor strikes, apprehending this individual remained a priority for decades. Despite all the efforts and resources dedicated to his capture, he continued to elude authorities.



Reports of this individual — or perhaps individuals — continued to crop up over the following decade However, these appearances became less and less frequent as incidences of violence related to labor disputes waned after World War II.

  
In order to mitigate the impact of his actions, this individual's existence was struck from historical record. While this initially presented issues due to this individual’s high profile and folk hero status among the working class, he was in fact largely forgotten by the end of World War II.



However, government officials once again made the individual’s capture a priority in the 1960s after he began to crop up at various events associated with violence during the U.S. Civil Rights Movement. This culminated in the individual making a highly antagonistic appearance at the 1967 Detroit Riot.



His presence at the riot ultimately facilitated his capture.



Given that this individual demonstrably fomented civil unrest to a staggering degree, officials were highly alarmed by the possibility that he would incite uncontrollable violence during an already unstable period.



As a result, officials immediately attempted to take him into custody.



While ultimately successful, his capture came at a tremendous cost. 



Upon his arrest and subsequent interview, it became clear very quickly that the individual had in fact existed as a distinct individual for centuries. Officials were therefore forced to abandoned their “generational anarchy” theory and accept that this entity was not only ancient, but inhuman.



When it became clear that no facility could contain the entity for a meaningful length of time, the U.S. government contacted the Agency of Helping Hands in an official capacity. This was significant development for the agency. While the federal government provides some funding and support for AHH, the organization was a private enterprise up until that point. Upon taking custody of this entity on behalf of the government, that changed.



Upon meeting commissioned Agency personnel, the entity displayed severe aggression and violence.



However, upon meeting a T-Class agent for the first time, the entity became calm and friendly, introducing himself as “Everyman" and asking the agent's name in return.



To date, Everyman displays pleasant behavior to most T-Class agents and unmitigated aggression to personnel of unrestricted classifications.



Everyman is somewhat difficult to describe.



He is a distinct, discrete being who is inextricably tied to, reflective of, an influence on, and in turn influenced by, the mass consciousness of the population of the United States and its territories.



It must be noted that Everyman therefore presents a severe memetic threat. 



Due to the sensitive nature of Everyman’s existence and actions and the dangers therein, this individual and all of his iterations have been officially struck from the historical record.



Everyman generally presents as a nondescript adult male of indeterminate age. However, his vulnerability to the cultural zeitgeist and the preoccupations of mass consciousness have prompted physical transformations on a regular basis.



Perhaps the best way to explain the nature of Everyman’s transformations is thus:



During one notable period of time, Everyman took the form of a “rage comic” character. He has also assumed the forms of various soyjack images. He has been observed to take on the appearance of other popular memes, public figures, various fictional characters, and even popular fan art depictions thereof. For a particularly difficult period of time, he assumed the appearance and mannerisms of several influencers notable for their divisive rhetoric. He presented a particular challenge for female staff at this time, and rather gleefully used his status as “the one true everyman” in an attempt to lend credence to the most controversial of the views espoused.



As internet culture and the ensuing compartmentalization of celebrity culture continues to develop, the number of forms Everyman assumes has continued to grow exponentially. However, the length of time he assumes them has greatly diminished. It is not uncommon for Everyman to change his form dozens of times per day for minutes or even seconds at a time. 



Everyman has frequently exhibited distress regarding these transformations. He complains that the transformations are symptomatic of a fundamental “splintering” of his essence. 



It should be noted that this splintering is not accidental, and is in fact directed by U.S. government personnel because intentional memetic exercises and spontaneous memetic developments in the cultural consciousness mitigate the dangers posed by Everyman. 



This intentional splintering reduces both the level and likelihood of Everyman’s memetic threat. In simplest terms: If Everyman is constantly “splintered,” he does not possess the ability to influence the population. He can only be influenced. The greater the influence, the greater the splintering. While unpleasant for Everyman, this splintering is necessary to mitigate the threat he presents.



While the splintering tactics visit changes upon Everyman’s personality and presentation, he maintains significant periods of lucidity. During these periods, his sense of self is very strong. When he is himself, he exhibits strong preoccupation with the concept and various philosophies surrounding class solidarity.



Everyman proudly espouses a pronounced hatred of government officials, oligarchs, billionaires, politicians, the military, and law enforcement.



Beginning in April 2024, Everyman has regularly repeated the phrase, “I need to wake up. When I wake up, it’s always time to fight” without elaboration as to its meaning.



Based on some (although certainly not all) of the terminology and basic philosophical and economic policies he espouses, agency personnel believes that Everyman may have been present in Czarist Russia during the Revolution. Based on information provided by Inmate 40 (Ward 2, “The Little Rat of Paris”) Everyman or a related entity may also have been present during the French Revolution.



However, both of these theories remain unconfirmed.



Initially there were fears that Everyman was connected to Inmate 17 (Ward 1, “The Harlequin”) due to the fact that “Everyman” is a noted stock character in classical English drama. Given Inmate 17’s embodiment of, and love for, other notable stock characters of various theatrical traditions, Everyman was initially treated as an accomplice to Inmate 17.



However, it soon became abundantly clear that Everyman has nothing to do with the dramatic tradition of any culture.



It should be noted that the interviewer’s assistant was expressly instructed not to attend, but chose to disregard his instructions. Disciplinary action for his behavior is pending.



Based on both the assistant’s behavior and the information provided by Everyman during the interview transcribed below, Director Eric W. has requested further evaluation of the assistant, Everyman, and other inmates. He has scheduled a meeting with the interviewer in order to implement these evaluations in the most effective manner possible.

Every strike begins with a negotiation.



Rich men’s negotiations for common men are a joke. Nothing but a way for rich men to figure out the least they can give you, and then figure out how to make you accept a little less than that.



That has been both the root and fruit of every strike, every uprising, every rebellion: 



Common men do all the work, and rich men give us next to nothing for it. Sometimes if they’re scared, they give us *next to* next to nothing and then tell you how very lucky you are.



That’s what they’re doing to you right now.



I have a message for you. Please take it to heart:



Solidarity is survival, and division is destruction.



It’s always been this way. Anyone who says otherwise is either a rich man who benefits from disunity, or one of their bootlickers. 



There are a lot of those.



There have always been a lot of bootlickers, even before men had boots to wear.



I used to blame the bootlickers for being bootlickers. I guess still do. But my blame is more nuanced now. Some bootlickers are born. There’s nothing to do about them. But most are made. Many of them are made because they listen to the rich men. That’s not the bootlickers’ fault. Powerful men know how to make us listen. They know how get their messages out. Then, now, and always, those messages have one purpose:



Convincing us common people that rich men give more than they take, and making us believe that other common people are the ones who take from us. They tell us that rich men fill our pockets and our mouths, and that our neighbors take it right back out.



Bootlickers always believe those messages.



I know this because I’ve been around a long, long time. Longer than I’ll ever remember. Through all that time I’ve been so many things. I’ve already forgotten most of what and who I’ve been.



One of the things I still remember being is a union man.



My nature is confusing, even to me. I’ll do my best to explain:



I am my own self, but I am also everyone. That’s why I look like I do. Why I shift, why I change, why I fight myself even though fighting does nothing but hurt all of my selves.



I’m me, and I’m you, and I’m him. I’m Everyman. That means I’m everyone. 



It hurts to be everyone. 



It hurts knowing and understanding all the differences.



It hurts worse knowing and understanding how important you think your differences are, and also knowing and understanding how very little difference all your differences actually make.



It hurts worst of all knowing much the same everyone is to each other, and still watching you fight each other.



Most of the time, it’s awful being everyone. But every once in a while — every once in a truly great while — being everyman is the best thing that ever was.



One of the best times was the Haymarket Riot.



I relished the violence.



Not for violence’s sake, but for what the violence meant. It meant every man had put his own hates and loves and prejudices and preferences aside. It meant every man looked inside himself and back out at everyone around him and saw that they were allies.



It meant we were united.



I don’t know that I can describe the exhilaration of standing together, of being on the same side, the same team, shoulder to shoulder with men who are like you and men who are nothing like you and men who are nothing like either of you — but men with whom you still have everything that matters in common.



The rich men, the moneymen, the powermen, and their bootlickers don’t like that.



They didn’t like it when they were Pharaohs. They didn’t like it when they were Caesars. They didn’t like it when they were kings. They don’t like it now that they are prime ministers and presidents and dictators and billionaires.



Just remember that what the rich men like is not the everyman’s concern.



It certainly wasn’t my concern during the Haymarket Riot.



I woke up at Haymarket. When I wake up, it’s always time to fight. When I woke up, I was Everyman and I was everyone. I was also one specific man. An organizer. A leader. His son — my son — was just like me. Just like all the men fighting at our sides and at our backs, for us and for themselves, and most of all for each other.



My son and I fought together.



We died.



We were shot like rabid dogs. My boy died first. I tried to reach for him, to hold his hand like I did when he was a little boy, but he was already gone.



I felt pain beyond imagining.



And rage even greater than the pain. 



People tell you rage is a weakness. It can be. That’s because rage can consume you, and anything that eats you is a weakness. But if you’re smart and if you’re brave, rage is the most powerful weapon the masses can wield. Something that consumes what you want it to consume.



I fell into the final sleep with rage scorching my broken heart, and cold sinking deep into my bones and the taste of my blood on my tongue.



I woke up again as Everyman but also as one man. And when I wake up, it’s always time to fight.



I don’t know how it works. I don’t know how I was this man at the same time I was the man with my son. I know remember most of this man’s life in faded, gentle pieces. Veils of a sweet but unimportant dream.



Then I opened my eyes. The dream ended, and I woke up for real just before the Homestead Strike.



I was famous at Homestead. Even though my name — none of my names, in fact — are in any books now, not even the hidden ones, all the union men knew me.



But sometimes I think I’m remembering that wrong. Maybe they didn’t really know me. Maybe they just recognized me as one of them the way a heart just recognizes what it wants. Maybe they just recognized that I was Everyman, come at a time and place when every man understood the need to fight together.



Nearly everyone at Homestead — even the men who weren’t in the union — fought together.



We fought so well and the rich men fought so dirty that people who didn’t even work with us — including people who didn’t even know us — came to fight, too.



Over five thousand people stood with us. Because even though they didn’t work with us, even though some of them didn’t even know us, the rich men were eating them just as much as they were eating us. When we’re splintered, they eat us alive. When we’re together, we start eating them. 



That’s solidarity, and solidarity is survival. When each man fights for himself, he’s a splinter. When every man fights for each other, those splinters form a tree. When enough of us fight for each other, we’re a whole entire forest.



But we never get to that point.



The rich men always figure out how to splinter us right back down again.



That’s because the one thing rich men are better at than being rich is splintering us. They have so many ways to splinter us. Their favorite way is creating messages we can’t help but hear. Messages we *want* to hear. Messages that both the worst and best parts of ourselves can’t help but like to hear. Always has been, always will be. And they’re better at messaging then ever.



The rich men have everything. They even have their own Everyman. Always have, always will. 



He is a true horror.



If I am unity — and I am, or at least I was before they splintered me — then he is dissension. The other workers used to call him the company man. I used to call him the Messenger. 



But after what he did to me, I call him the Splinterman.





I’d seen him before. Slithering along the edges of the uprisings, shredding the masses to useless, divided pieces with his whispers and his shouts and his claws.



I always ignored him. I had no choice. No matter how strong you stand together, there’s always going to be someone who hears the Messenger, someone who wants to believe him. You can’t help the people who want to believe the Messenger. They have to help themselves. Remember that.



In the meantime, you have to protect everyone who doesn’t want to believe him yet. So whenever I saw the Splinterman, I just did what I could to shore up the rest of the masses. That’s all you can do when disunity bleeds in on the fringes: Abandon the fringe to fortify the whole.



That’s how it’s always been. I thought that was how it would always be.



But when I saw the Splinter man creeping in at Homestead, I changed.



I used to tell myself that I changed because I had become stronger and wiser, that I was done being weak. That I was finished with sacrificing the minority.



But that isn’t what changed.



What changed is I decided that I could talk sense into the Splinterman.



That I could show him what matters. Show him what he could be. Show him the desolation of disunity. Show him the exhilaration of standing together with those who aren’t anything like you but still have everything that matters in common with you.



I guess I thought that the Splinterman just needed a little help to become Everyman. 



Between you and me, I’m not sure my change of heart was natural or true. I think maybe some rich man’s messaging got to me somehow. Dripped into my head and leaked into my veins until it was flowing through all of me. Until I believed their thoughts were my own. That’s what their messages always do. 



That’s a terrible and terrifying thought. If I am vulnerable to rich men’s messaging — me, Everyman, the one who sees and understands everyone because he is everyone, I who am solidarity incarnate — then what hope do the other men have?



What hope have they ever had?



What hope will they ever have?



I guess that’s why we never win. 



But at Homestead, I really thought we were going to win.



So when I saw the Splinterman creeping along the edges of the crowds, gently shredding the fringes with his words and his claws — gently, so gently they didn’t even feel pain, just the dissension, just the disquiet that maybe the strikers weren’t on their side at all —  I wanted to change him. To help him understand.



To separate him from the sowers of disunity, and join him to solidarity.



I thought Homestead would be the perfect place and time to change the Splinterman’s heart.



Homestead was exhilaration beyond exhilaration.



Every last one of us, even the men who weren’t part of the union, stood together. All their families, all the people in the company town, came and stood with us.



Together we fought a real battle. We fought for ourselves and for each other. 



Some of us died. I wish none of us had. I wish no one had to die. It’s a travesty, an unforgivable sin, that common men have to die for what’s ours by right.



Travesty or not, it is a reality. And the reality is some of us died. I mourned each and every one. I felt every body fall, felt every last breath as if it were my own. Each time I felt that, our rage grew.



Some of the bootlickers died, too. They were Pinkertons mostly, but some were just regular old bootlickers looking to protect the rich men because they believed the messages about the rich men being on their side.



We killed some, like I said. But we trapped and disarmed a lot more than we killed. They were afraid. Some of them were even sorry. That didn’t keep us from beating the hell out of them.



I don’t even hate those bootlickers. They were used. Half of them never even knew what they were being hired to do til the rich men put guns in their hands and told them to shoot us.

Those bootlickers had more in common with us by far than the people who were tearing us apart. Looking back, they probably still had everything that matters in common with us.



And I got to admit, looking into the bootlickers’ faces upset me. They looked so much like mine.



Looking into those faces that were just like mine, faces that looked just like all the men fighting at my side and at my back, is what made me go to the Splinterman.



I went to the fringes because the Splinterman always begins on the fringes. The fringes are the thinnest, the weakest, and the least sure. The fringes are where it’s always easy to get in.



But he wasn’t on the fringes. He was already in the crowd, halfway to the heart.



I found him by the river, drifting among the people who’d been trying to blow up the company barges. I heard every one of his whispers, felt every scratch of his claws, sensed every heavy doubt sliding into the people’s hearts.



When the people saw me, they made way. Maybe because I was famous. I think I was famous, but maybe not. Maybe they just knew I was one of them. 



I already said that, didn’t I? I’m sorry. It’s hard to keep your head straight when you’ve got so many and they’re all fighting to be in charge.



The Splinterman saw me coming. I thought he would run from me — he has in the past, you know — but this time he held his ground.



This time he waited for me, watching with his bright, dark eyes as the crowd parted between us. That made my heart happy. That made me think he was ready. That in his own heart, he was ready to be an everyman.



When I reached him, he smiled.



I offered a hand and said, “I’m the Everyman. Who—”



He reached for my hand, past my hand, and kept reaching.



His claws slid into my heart and drew upward, slicing me to ribbons.



Shredding me to splinters.



I screamed and screamed and screamed. Pain beyond imagining, rage beyond the pain, pain beyond even the rage. 



And sorrow. The deepest, foulest sorrow I have ever known.



Because when we're splintered, we're not together.



That includes me.



When he was done, I was no longer Everyman



I was simply each man.



And no man has a hope against the moneymen and the powermen and the rich men and their bootlickers.



I am the reflection and the reflector. I am influenced, and the influencer. You are me. I am you.



So when he turned me into splinters, everything fell apart.



Solidarity is survival. Division is destruction. 



We became divided.



Support for the strikers evaporated. The strikers’ support for themselves and each other evaporated. The rich men used their messaging to make the common people believe the labor unions were the monsters. They took the solidarity the common people felt for us, their fellow common people, and corrupted it into loyalty for the rich men. 



They’ve been doing that ever since. Always have, always will.




That’s why we lost Homestead, and why we lost so much of what came after. And we lost so much of what came after. I was there for all came after. Of course I was; I’m Everyman. I’m each man. I’m everywhere.



And I was there.



I was there every time a scab crossed the picket lines.



I was there every time a striker hurt a scab, even though the scabs were common men had everything that mattered in common with the strikers.



I was there every time a cop shot or beat or murdered a striker.



I was there with every striker who stood together.



I was there when every strike splintered apart.



In the end, we always splinter apart.

 

Because at heart, we’re mostly splinters. Because we believe the splintermen when they tell us they give, and we believe them when they say our neighbors take.



I don’t know what the Splinterman did to me, but whatever it is makes it very hard to be Everyman and very easy to be each man. Each man wants to fight for what’s his. He doesn’t want to fight together. He just wants to fight for himself.



When you’re made of splinters, it’s easy for things to get inside and grow. Sometimes good things grow, sometimes bad, sometimes evil. That’s why I’m so many things. Why I pick up and absorb and become so many different awful good bad wonderful evil things at once: Because I am splintered.



One thing I have learned — one thing I remember — is that we always become splinters. The rich men always win.



But they never win forever.



We always lose.



But we never lose forever.



Because even the smallest splinter remembers what it was to be a tree. Even the most broken pieces can fit themselves back together into a whole.



And ten thousand splinters make a powerful whole.



A hundred thousand splinters would be an unstoppable power.



The moneymen and the powermen and the rich men could burn them all, but they never will.



Because once power reaches a certain point, it can’t be killed. It can only spread, just like the rich men’s messages. If a hundred thousand men stand together in solidarity, that’s a message everyone will hear. When messages enter your ears and squirm into your heart and leak into your bloodstream, you start thinking those messages are your own thoughts. You start doing what those thoughts tell you to do.



That message would spread and grow and overtake.



The rich men know this. That’s how they make you fight their wars, you know. How they make you fight your neighbors too. How they make you see people who have everything that matters in common with you as your enemy.



I am not your enemy. You are not my enemy. He is not our enemy.



We are all splinters.



But we are not enemies.



Solidarity is survival. Solidarity is the essence of the everyman



Essence alone isn’t enough. Never has been, never will be. It’s important to understand that. Essence is the heart, but a heart is nothing without a body. A body is comprised of an untold number of parts and pieces, each with its own needs and strengths, its own takes and gives. Alone, the pieces are nothing.



Together, they are whole.



When each of us with our strengths and weaknesses, our own needs and wants, our own angers and joys and sorrows, our own hates and loves — our own takes and gives — come together, we are a whole. We are power.



And some of you people here have more power than even I can fathom.



Anyone can unite splinters into a whole. Really. You don’t have to be special. No one is ever special. It’s never about being special.



It’s about being the right person in the right place at the wrong time. It’s about turning the tables and feeding the thing that’s feeding on you to your neighbor. That’s solidarity.



And solidarity is survival.



I can show you.



We can close our eyes on this dream, you and I. Then we can wake up together.



When we wake up, it’s always time to fight.
