I was dreaming.

Ever since I was a child, I sometimes realize, mid-dream, that I’m dreaming.
This was one of those times.

For reasons I couldn’t explain, I found myself alone on a dim, deserted train platform.
The lights were low—sickly sodium bulbs that made everything look washed out.
I thought to myself: what a gloomy dream.

Then a voice came over the loudspeaker.
A flat, lifeless male voice, as if someone had emptied a human of warmth and left only tone.

“The train will arrive shortly.
If you board that train… you will face something terrifying.”

Not long after, a train arrived.
It wasn’t a proper train. It looked exactly like a child’s amusement-park toy—rounded, small, wrong.
Pale men and women sat in rigid rows like dolls, their faces blank, their hands folded, motionless.

I told myself it was a dream and that I could wake whenever I wanted.
Whenever I knew I was dreaming, I usually woke myself.
So I tested it. I boarded.

I sat three rows from the back.
The carriage smelled faintly of oil and old candy—an impossible, nostalgic smell that made my stomach twist.
Warm, stagnant air drifted through the car; it was so vivid I began to doubt it was only a dream.

“Departing now…”

The voice spoke again.
The train lurched forward.

My heart pounded—equal parts fear and a pulled curiosity that felt like a knife.

We plunged into a tunnel. The walls were bathed in a strange purple light—like the ghost of a carnival ride I used to hate as a kid.
I told myself: it’s memory. Nothing else.

Then the voice announced, slow and clinical:

“Next stop… Ikizukuri… Ikizukuri.”

Ikizukuri—alive-slicing. The word was a punch to the gut.

From the back of the carriage came a scream.
I turned.

Four tiny figures—small, filthy, dressed in rags—swarmed the man in the last seat.
They moved with a frantic, insect-like speed. Their knives flashed cold and precise.

They cut him open—slicing as if filleting fish.
The smell hit me: copper and rot. He screamed. Organs were pulled, one by one, and laid out like grotesque offerings.

A woman with long hair sat directly behind me. Pale as the train’s paint. Motionless, expressionless, staring straight ahead as if watching a play.
Her calm made the scene worse. She didn’t react. She did not blink.

I froze. This was beyond imagination. For the first time in one of my lucid dreams, I wondered if lucid meant anything at all.

When I looked back again, he was gone—replaced by a heap of red-black flesh. The woman remained, blank as before.

The voice came again, colder, mechanical:

“Next stop… Gouging… Gouging.”

Two of the little figures appeared and, with jagged spoons, began to gouge the woman’s eyes.
Her still face contorted into a scream so close behind me I felt the pressure in my ears.
Eyes dangled. Warm liquid filled the air and my throat tightened.

I hunched forward, trembling. I couldn’t—wouldn’t—watch more.

And by the order of things… I realized I was next.

I fought to wake myself, to clamp down on that thin, fragile thread of lucidity I always relied on.
But a horrible curiosity kept me pinned. I wanted to hear what they would announce about me.
I wanted to know the word.

The voice came once more:

“Next stop… Minced Meat… Minced Meat.”

I felt my blood go cold.
Panic surged like a wave. I squeezed my eyes shut and forced the chant: Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

Usually, that was enough.

A mechanical whir began—far off at first, then unmistakably present.
One of the small creatures climbed into my lap. It held a strange machine—cold metal, teeth and plates—and brought it close to my face.

The whir grew louder. My body felt blown by wind. My palms were wet. I thought: this is the end.

Then, silence.

I opened my eyes.

…

I had escaped.

I was drenched in sweat. Tears burned my cheeks. I staggered to the kitchen and drank until my chest unclenched.
It had felt so real—so impossibly, terrifyingly real—but after all, surely… only a dream.

The next day, I told friends. They laughed. To them, it was only a dream.

Four years later—college, a part-time job, a life that smelled of coffee and deadlines—I had almost buried it.
Then, one night, the memory came back like a hand around my throat.

“Next stop… Gouging… Gouging.”

The image flashed: the woman, eyes being ripped out.

I panicked. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.
But this time, waking was harder. The chant wouldn’t let me go.

“Next stop… Minced Meat… Minced Meat.”
