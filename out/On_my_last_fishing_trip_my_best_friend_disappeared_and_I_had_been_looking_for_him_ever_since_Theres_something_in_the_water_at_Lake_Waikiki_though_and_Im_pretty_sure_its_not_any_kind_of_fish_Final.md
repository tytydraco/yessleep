I almost didn't even realize I'd made it all the way to the lake itself until I was damn near *in* the water. I began unpacking my bag and putting on my gear. Devin stood behind me, standing still. I looked behind me and asked him, "Well, you gonna come with or--" I stopped when I realized that he wasn't looking at me, but past me.

Frowning, I turned around and my heart just about froze dead. There, in the trees on the other side of the lake, were the orbs, the eyes. "The hell is that?" asked Devin. Once again, I was clamming up.

The eyes had themselves embedded once again inside my head. They seared their place in my brain, just like they had all those years ago. Now, though, it was worse, knowing now good and damn well that I wasn't just seeing things. They weren't "just the melatonin gummies", like Tanner was trying to get me to believe back then. No, they were real and they were right in fucking front of me, and this time, I wasn't the only one that saw them. They had Devin just as starstruck now, too.

I tried squinting to get a better look at them, maybe get a chance to see what those eyes *belonged to*, but I couldn't see anything. Devin moved to the edge of the lake where I was and leaned out to get a better look himself. The orbs didn't move, remaining motionless where they were, glaring at the two of us.

My legs began to shake. I was now caught between the instinct to book it back to the car and get out of there as fast as I could, and the urge to want to swim over to it for a closer look. This only amplified when I watched another pair of eyes pop out behind the ones watching us. Then another, and another, until there were about four or five pairs of glowing eyes staring at us from the other side.

The first pair was the first to finally move, slowly coming forward and descending into the lake. I still couldn't see anything of its body before it fully submerged in the lake, the same with the others as they all began to follow suit. Out of the corner of my eye, I watched Devin hastily throw his gear on.

"Wh-What're you doing?" I asked, still shaking, not taking my eyes away from the other side of the lake.

"I'm gonna go in." My eyes just about shot like bullets out of my skull.

"You're gonna do *what?!"* He fixed his goggles onto his head. "Y-You're not serious!"

"Why not?" I gestured to the other bank, stammering.

"Di-Did you *not* just see them? Those things?"

"Yeah, and I want to see what they are."

"And *I'm* the insane one?! For God's sake, Devin, those things, for all I know, are responsible for what happened to--"

"Which means all the more reason to see what they even are, isn't it?" I looked at him like he was trying to get me to believe that the moon was made of cheese. "You always used to talk about finding your friend, find what happened to him, right?"

"Yeah, but..." I paused for a second, trying to figure out what I was supposed to say to this. He was right, sure, but I wasn't trying to get *myself* perished in the same way in the process. He was in the process of fixing the air hose to his mouth when I saw the eyes again, now staring back up at me through the water. Ten burning orange dots, embedded deep within deep, dark circles just below the lake's surface.

As freakish as they were, I couldn't take my eyes off of them, either. Because of this, I ended up losing track of Devin, meaning until I actually heard the splash from the lake, I didn't know Devin had dove in.  When I looked, all I could see were ripples in the water, then he was gone. I looked as close into the lake as I could without falling in myself. Nothing.

The eyes were gone now, too. All I could see was the dark, murky depths of the lake, just like last time, just like... Like...

I started panic dressing, fixing my gear to go in after him. I'd already lost one friend to Lake Waikiki, I'd be damned if I was going to lose another, not without it taking me as well. Every second that passed getting my gear on, I imagined Devin looking the exact same way I kept dreaming of Tanner. I imagined him being picked apart, devoured by those things, whatever the hell they are.

I managed to finagle the goggles onto my face before I dove in headfirst. The instant my body broke the surface of the water, I wished that I would've taken my time fixing my gear because, in my haste, I realized that I hadn't fixed my flashlight to my goggles. I was now blinder than a bat, plunging headlong into a fathomless abyss with no way of seeing what or where the hell I'm going.

The water was warm, yet at the same time still cold enough to actually cause me to break out into goosebumps. It was cold enough to actually turn my skin purple, something that strangely stuck out in contrast to the rest of the lake around me. I didn't even realize how deep I'd gone, either, until I'd actually looked up and saw the little glint of the sun peering down into the lake-- literally the *only* goddamned source of light for endless miles down here-- looking like a little orange-ish dot up above me, a speck of light, fighting tooth and fucking claw to keep from being snuffed out by the darkness.

At least... I *thought* it was the sun.

It wasn't until I realized that, unlike the sun, there were *two* specks staring down at me. Of course, just like on land, I couldn't see any sort of body, any head, arms, legs, anything like that. Just the two glaring orbs, which were now growing larger and larger, coming closer and closer. As they came, I could feel the air tighten, even through my oxygen mask. Somehow, whatever this fuckin' thing was was devouring any oxygen within the lake's depths. Funny enough, I guess, it was right then that I noticed there weren't any bubbles or anything-- *OR ANY FISH!*

Now I was seeing exactly why.

I floated there, slowly suffocating. I clawed desperately at the water, hoping to pull myself to the surface, but it was no use. I couldn't move myself any further upward or downward. There was something keeping me suspended there in the water all jellyfish-like. It wasn't long before I was starting to fade out, losing as much air as I was.

Suddenly, with the thing being right on top of me like it was, I began to see something illuminating in the darkness. Sets of eyes; hundreds, thousands of them, began opening up around the set in front of me, examining me. They were everywhere, surrounding me, smothering me within the abyss. I wanted to close my eyes, but just like a moment ago above the water, I couldn't make myself turn away here, either.

I started to squirm, gasping now from lack of oxygen. The thing's multitudinous eyes glowed brighter and brighter. Eventually, the body of the thing was finally revealed. To call it a "body" is quite a stretch of the truth, though, with it being more like one gigantic, amorphous black mass in (sort of) the general shape of a man that was covered every inch in glowing orange eyes, all of them blinking and twitching all around me.

The longer I observed them, the more I realized that they all had different pupils. Each and every one of them had different colored irises, different shaped ones. Hell, some of them weren't even *human* eyes, but ones of animals and/or reptiles. Some of them I *still* couldn't even recognize as those, either. *What the hell are you?!* I could hear myself screaming at the top of my lungs in my head at this thing. To my utter shock, no, to my *horror*, I actually heard some sort of response, at least that's what I viewed it as.

***"Ego sum creatura, omnium principium."***

I heard this get bellowed at me, ringing throughout my head like it was a tunnel and these words had just been screamed at me from the other end. Though I had no idea of its translation, I instantly picked up on the fact that it was Latin. ***"Finis venit, nam creatio inquinata renovanda est."***

*What the hell does that mean, where is this comng from?!* My head snapped all around me. In all directions, all that was visible was this shapeless "man's" eyes, all focused on me, eyeing me up and down, sizing me up. I couldn't move, I couldn't run. I couldn't breathe.

I couldn't escape!

My body became so nearly weightless, I almost thought I was in space or something like that. What I mean by this is, you know how you usually feel when in the water like your body is a brick or a lead weight? Usually your body's a lot denser underwater, right? Well, that wasn't the case here with me. No, I essentially had no fucking organs, no bones, nothing. I was a hollow scrap of meat, defying gravity in the middle of the depths of Lake Waikiki.

Finally, I heard, bellowing, ***"Finis nunc vobiscum est."*** The shape started then to stretch itself apart. Doing this, it formed itself into multiple spreads of long, gangly tentacles, each studded with each and every type of eye I'd mentioned before. They squirmed about on all sides of me. I watched them then start circling me, closing in on me, trying to devour me.

As it did this, those words from a second ago boomed again in my head. The difference with this time was that, deep within my ears, I could hear the softest voice telling me this: *"The End is with you now."* The eyes were all around me now and when I watched them begin to smother me, I felt more and more like I was being stretched apart, like my body was a rubber band, no filling, no organs, nothing, just rubber being strained until it reached its snapping point.

It didn't hurt exactly, but rather, more like I was losing the ability to *feel* pain-- or *anything at all!* My vision quickly turned into a giant cloud. The next to go after that was tactile perception, noticing when I tried touching across my body, namely my eyes when I began panicking, trying to figure out what the fuck happened to my sight, that I couldn't feel anything from my hands either.  Then I realized, too, that I couldn't even feel the water all across my body, either.

I was hollow, not even numb, just... just *hollow*. Empty.

I was being erased!

Before too much longer, I wasn't aware of anything. My sight was gone, not even a cloud anymore, I couldn't feel, couldn't hear, couldn't smell, nothing. The world was black and the only thing I had that indicated that I was even alive, that I even *existed* still, was the screaming, crying, petrified thoughts stirring in my head. The thought that this was it, that I was gonna die-- no, worse, that I wouldn't even *exist* anymore! I would be nothing, not even a thought in the back of anyone's mind.

I thought about home, back in the city where I'd moved. I thought of the time I'd spent plotting coming back here. I thought of Devin, my new friend who's life I'd just costed, all because I couldn't let Tanner go. Now, I lost them, both of them, and I'd lose myself, too. My life, erased. Everything I've lived for; a fat fucking zero sum.

Eventually, even these thoughts began fleeing me the way ants do when their hill's been kicked up. There was nothing left now. I wasn't alive. I wasn't a person. I wasn't...

*"Dave!"*

I didn't hear it at first. It was so small, I couldn't tell if it was an actual sound or the last fleeting thought in my mind before I'd finally succumb to my fate.

*"Dave!"*

It was louder this time, clearer. Familiar...

*"Dave!"*

*Too familiar...*

"Dave!" I shook awake this time, being jolted awake by... By...

By *Tanner!*

True to life, Tanner was standing there, shaking the hell out of me, grinning as wide as he always had. I gasped, shooting bolt upright. He laughed and asked, "You went fer quite the swim there, didn't ya?" Gasping, I swung my head all around, slowly coming to the realization that I was back on the bank of Lake Waikiki. He sent several hard pats on the back, each one taking the few ounces of air I had managed to choke in right out of me.

"There, there, let it all out, Davey." I turned to look at him.

"D-Davey?" I wheezed. I shook him off of me and scurried away from him like he was diseased. Already I knew something wasn't right. I wasn't sure of it yet, couldn't narrow it down just yet, but I knew there was something that just wasn't right.

"What's the matter, somethin' down there spook ya?"

"W-wha-where am I?"

He barked a laugh and replied, "Oh, an' now he's askin' where he i--"

"Tanner, where the hell am I?" His eyes went wide, crossing at me.

"Tanner? You just call me "Tanner", who the hell's that?" Now my heart began pounding.

"You're-You're name... Tanner Gibson..." His eyebrows raised even higher. "Dude, s-stop fucking with me, please."

"Davey... Buddy, I--"

"Stop it! My name's Ian, you know that, what the fu--" I stopped, seeing his face abruptly change from the carefree smirk I always remembered from him to one of serious alarm. The way he looked at me in that moment, you'd have thought I was asking him to dance around Lake Waikiki in the moonlight, naked, after sacrificing a goat. I knew then that he wasn't making this up, any of it.

"Dave, I think you need to see the doctor." He took me by my hand and began leading me out of the trail and back to the truck. Dumbfounded, to put it in the only word that comes to mind for me right now, as I was, I didn't really bother trying to protest or resist. I went with him to the hospital, where I, the best I knew how anyway, explained the situation, the way I knew it at least; My best friend, almost 30 years ago, vanished in the lake. I went to look for him, years later, with a friend, and nearly ended up the same way myself, but somehow ended up here, now, wherever this place and/or time is, really.

Look, there's too many questions, next to none of which I have even the remotest goddamn clue as to the answer to, but this much I do know. First, I know for a fact, this *isn't* my world. I don't know how else to say it other than that. So much looks, feels, and *is* familiar to me, but its not mine, if you understand what I mean. I don't really know how or why, but I know that what I woke up to from the lake, but it isn't my home.

I haven't found Devin, either-- or anybody that *looks* like him, claiming another name from him. If he *is* still out there, somewhere, somehow, I wonder where and if he's going through the same shock I am. I know one more thing: All of this has something to do with whatever in God's fucking name that thing beneath Lake Waikiki is. I can't prove it, not materially, but I know that this was all its doing. I am writing this because A, its the only thing I can think to do to try and make sure my memory of home, my *real* home, doesn't fade away forever.

I don't yet know how, or *if*, I can get back to where I'm actually from, but I'm going to try. I'm scared to, though. I wouldn't have been in this situation at all if I'd just let it all go, if I'd just forgotten. Because I tried to change what wasn't mine to change, because I'd tried to rectify what wasn't my fault, now I'm forced to live with this, something that *is* my fault.

The only thing I have now that reminds me that I'm not fucking crazy, that I'm NOT in the real world, *my* world anymore, is the photo he and I took the day he disappeared, standing in front of his truck with the words "Tanner's big rig" on the side of it, facing the camera. It was a running gag between the two of us as we'd joked about being truckers. See, the Tanner here (or "Eddie", as he's apparently known as here) *DIDN'T* have this on *his* truck.

I'm lost and I don't know if there's a way back. I tried to find what happened to my best friend, only to realize why I shouldn't have. There's something beneath [Lake Waikiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1397zx1/on_my_last_fishing_trip_my_best_friend/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and its not a fish...
