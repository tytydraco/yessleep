so I've found something and i need help or advice so i heard that this place might be the best for that. (Apparently you guys are the pros on this stuff)

When i was young my family moved to a semi small town. The type were everyone knows everyone and tales spread faster than the plague. All these towns Have there own local tals and myths and this place was no different. The tale was about a forest south of the town. How " no one comes back if you go far enough into it. " kind of deal. But i think it might be true in this case...

So one day i just randomly thought about this "story". Its now been about 13 years since i heard it last time. i don't know why it Came to mind but it did. So i told it to a friend of mine and he suggested i post it here so here we go.

So just south of the town is this thick forest. Like its almost impossible to enter kind of thick. But the trees are talking at night. That part i know is true as i heard it my self... Not words, more of a low mumbling. Defenetly sounds human enough too be creepy. 10 years before i moved too the town three boys walked into the forest. But only one returned. He's story is that deep into the forest they got lost. They walked for what seemed like miles But when It eventually got darker, they stumbled upon this staircase. Going straight down below the ground. Two of the boys walked down the stairs. Some talking was heard but there was tree voices. Then four, Then five, then none. He said that the voices Cut out out of nowhere and then it got pitch black (not surprising since it always gets darker in thick forests) then he ran back. And just kept running until he got out of the forest. For him it had been just a couple hours. 8 tops but it had been days. Four days to be exact. When they searched for the other boys nothing was found. Not even as much as a broken branch. No basement... 
After that we were never allowed to go beyond the southern border of the town (not that anyone dared too do so anyway) but the trees were still talking, birds still singing, the forest seemed to be untouched by the events. Like it never happened. The surviving boy was moving from the town the next week so now there is no trace of it ever happening. Except the rule and a sign " no turning back " hanging from a lonely tree just outside of the forest border...

It could be just a story, made up by childrens mind and old legends but for some reason. I believe it. And im not the legend believer type. Nor do i believe in ghost or the supernatural at all. Could just be three boys playing in the woods and two went missing but i dont think that. Even tho everyone else buys that it just seems like more than that too me. Maybe there is something too this story maybe there truly is a basement in the woods... Waiting for its next victim. Its next meal...
