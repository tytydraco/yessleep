The slow ticking of the clock pulled me out of the depths of sleep. With every passing second, the sound grew louder. Then I felt a weird pressure on my right ear and some dampness under my hands. Suddenly, my eyes opened. Yeah, my eyes opened, and I realized I was sitting inside the classroom. Damn, I had actually fallen asleep right in the middle of the class. And now, when I look outside, it’s already dark. I can literally see the moon. That means the whole class is long gone. I...

I was the only one asleep in the whole school. To kinda confirm my suspicion, I looked back at the clock. That’s what woke me up in the first place, and when I looked, the clock showed 10:00. The first thing I did was exactly what any guy would do when he’s suddenly under pressure—I reached into my pocket for my phone. But as soon as I put my hand in, I realized my phone was missing. A million questions ran through my mind. How could I have slept for so long? And even if I was asleep...


So, my friends and teachers didn’t wake me up? Whenever I don’t get my phone, I start checking my bag, my desk, everywhere. Then it suddenly hits me—why was I even here? Actually, I was using my phone at school, and my teacher caught me. After that, as a punishment, I was kept here after school to do some cleaning. Now, my phone’s in the principal’s office, and maybe that’s why neither my friends nor the teachers woke me up when I fell asleep.
After cleaning the classroom, I was supposed to go home, but I think I took a little break while cleaning because I was already really tired. And because of that tiredness, I ended up falling asleep. But still, man, I can’t understand why no one woke me up. I got up from my old creaky chair and walked toward the door, thinking maybe they locked me in. Ahead was a long empty hallway, something I always remembered during the day — usually filled with students running around and shouting. And suddenly, I saw something shiny near the door...

Look, a bunch of keys. They belonged to my physics teacher. I can recognize that whole keyring from a distance. I don’t get why the physics teacher didn’t leave in their car today. Did they take the bus? Because their car key was definitely on that bunch. Well, I’m gonna try each key, one by one, and see if any of them open the main door, but none of them work. Alright, Plan B: there’s an emergency exit at the back hall of the gym. I’m thinking that’s the one I should use.

Remember that feeling when you’re home alone watching a horror movie and suddenly you need to use the bathroom? You have to go, but it’s dark. And somewhere in your mind, you’re thinking, what if something comes out of the dark? What if someone’s watching me? Then you tell yourself, nah, I’ll wait a bit, I’ll go later, I’ll go later. And you keep putting it off—not because you don’t need to go, but because you’re scared inside.


I was feeling exactly the same way. The road was super long, and I could only see one step ahead. If it weren’t for the ceiling lights or the moonlight, I wouldn’t have seen even that. It felt like some stupid, hated trial. Only, instead of a forest, it was a school here. Well, I didn’t have much of a choice. I couldn’t just wait here until morning. I slipped the keys into my pocket—maybe they’d come in handy later—and then headed toward the gym. As I was passing by the science lab, there wasn’t anyone there...
Stuff was scattered everywhere. It looked like someone had just dumped everything around. Boxes were lying all over the place. Drawers were left open. Seeing that gave me a weird feeling—like maybe someone had broken in. Wait a minute. Did a robbery actually happen here? And is the thief still around, or did they take off? Or worse, what if they blame me for the whole thing? All these bad thoughts were running through my mind, but not for long, because then something happened that made me...


All my attention shifted there. When I closed the door, I saw a shadowy figure in the glass reflection. The man was standing at the very end of the hallway, holding something sharp in his hand, completely still. There was a small flickering light just beneath him, and looking at him sent a strange chill through me. When I took a deep breath with that presence around, my bones literally shook. Instead of freezing, my flight response kicked in hard, and I ran away from there immediately. As fast as I could...

I was running as fast as I could. Taking a sharp turn near the lockers on the other side of the school wing, I slipped in a panic and lost my balance. At first, I thought I had slipped because of water. I lost my balance in a really weird way—I mean, my foot just slipped. But when I looked closely, it wasn’t water. It was actually blood. There was blood spilled everywhere, and right in the middle of it was a signboard that said, "Caution: Slippery Floor." Terrified, I screamed out loud and started stomping my feet hard.

I started hitting. Because of that, the red-colored pool that had formed started spreading even more. I just couldn't understand what was happening. I couldn’t just freeze there. I had to get out of there. At first, I couldn’t even get up. I kept shouting. But somewhere inside me, the will to live gathered the courage, and I got up. Then it hit me—I didn’t have any keys to get out, nor did I have my phone. But yeah, I did have the key to my locker.

I take off my shoes right there so I don’t leave any footprints wherever I go next. Because my shoes were already soaked in blood. Then I look for my locker. Well, I find my locker number. After that, I open the locker, step inside, and shut the locker behind me. It was so quiet there, I can’t even explain. Even if I moved a little, the sound would echo through the whole school. That’s how quiet it was. Then, I see a shadow slowly coming closer. I... I...

I shut everything down completely. I locked it myself so I couldn’t say a word, so no sound could come out. Whatever he was—shadow, killer, whatever—he was standing right there in front of me. There were tiny cracks in my lockers through which I could see him. I’m telling the truth here. I didn’t move an inch because if I did, the killer would’ve known I was right in the locker next to him. I stood there like a statue. I was soaking wet. I’ve never felt fear like that in my entire life, not even close to what I felt that day. After that, the killer...


What’s he doing? He has a bag, and he puts it down right on the blood that’s spilled on the ground. Then, looking at that blood, he starts leaning towards it. Like, he’s actually bending down toward the blood on the ground. That was the first time I really got a good look at him. He looked about my age, maybe 18 or 19—thin and pretty tall. He was wearing black formal shoes and dark pants. He had a leather belt around his waist with a long case hanging from it. There were some test tubes filled with green liquid and an oxygen filter. On top of that, he was wearing a shirt.
He was wearing a light grey full-sleeve shirt, and on his face was a transparent inhalation mask that fogged up with every breath. Protective goggles covered his eyes, and behind them, his red eyes with purple circles around them were slowly visible. The guy looked really young, but his skin was in terrible shape. It was covered with rashes, swelling, and scratches. Seeing him could make anyone feel uneasy. Then I looked at his hands. He was wearing blue rubber gloves, and in his hand, he held a hunting knife.

He was pressing down on it really hard. But this wasn’t just any ordinary knife. There was a syringe attached to the handle—the same kind of liquid that was on his belt. It was clamped with a metal ring, and a thin tube ran right along the edge of the blade. It looked like some kind of biological weapon straight out of a movie. The sad part is, this wasn’t a movie—it was standing in front of me, ready to be my death. I swear, it reminded me of someone, but I was so scared I couldn’t even remember who.

He was just standing there. Suddenly, his voice cuts through the silence, and he says, "Someone was running down the hallway. Can't people even read? It clearly says 'Caution: Slippery Floor' right here. Why do you think I put this sign up? How can anyone be this illiterate? Do you even go to school, or are you just here to mess around? But hey, if you did run here, at least use your brain a little. At least wipe off your tracks before hiding in the locker. That boy..."


As soon as he speaks, he suddenly shoves his knife into one of the lockers behind him, twists it, and pulls the locker door open. Then I see there’s a student hiding inside. The guy grabs her and throws her straight onto the floor, coughing really hard while doing it. He keeps coughing over and over. Seeing this, I’m shocked to realize there are more students hiding here, just like me. I was probably too scared to notice before. But that girl, that girl was just like me.
I forgot to take off my shoes, so they left footprints all the way to the locker room. Now she’d been caught, lying on the floor right in front of me. I’m not gonna lie, I wanted to be a hero right then—just rush out of the locker, go straight to that guy, you know, beat him up and save the girl. But then I thought, there’s no way I could take him down. That thought pushed me back, especially since he had that weird weapon in his hand. So, I decided to just stay quiet and keep lying in my locker.

No matter what happens, I’ll only pray for that girl. I don’t even know how I can help her. She was really shaken up and kept saying, "Please, please don’t hurt me. Let me go. Please, I just want to go back to my family." She was crying so hard. Then the guy, seeing her like that, widened his eyes and said, "I don’t think your family would want such a disappointment. In fact, they’d probably be happier if you never went back to them." Hearing that, she started crying even more.
He goes on to say, "Hey, don’t worry. I already told your family that you’re having a sleepover with us tonight. Now tell me, what were you doing at school so late? And yeah, don’t lie. I’m allergic to liars." The girl, stammering, like she’s trying to think of an answer, says that she had teased a classmate. As a punishment, she was also made to clean the classroom, just like me. Well, as soon as the boy hears this, he says...


Actually, I haven’t completed my degree. I didn’t finish it, but there’s something I want to teach you. I want to tell you that coincidence is a bitch. Just think about it. If you hadn’t messed with your classmate today, maybe you wouldn’t be here. And if I hadn’t decided to rob your school today, I wouldn’t be here either. I was sitting inside the locker, watching this twisted movie—about a guy who was torturing his victim. I know it would’ve been way easier for him to just kill him.
But he wasn’t killing him. He was making him suffer. To be honest, I didn’t even want to watch anymore. Still, I kept watching, like a fool hoping maybe something good would happen. The boy starts coughing again, coughing and saying, “To be honest…” If I wasn’t so sadistic, I would’ve just taken what I wanted and left. But the truth is, I enjoy watching people cry, suffer, run for their lives, beg for mercy. I can’t help it. This is just how I am. I never wanted to become like this.

Honestly, I wanted to be a good person, someone who gets along well with others. To respect them, keep them happy. But that’s so boring. Who wants to do that? Why even bother? I actually want to see people suffer. I want to awaken that fear inside them that’s been asleep since childhood, something they probably never even felt before. And seeing that side of them, it excites me. Once I’ve seen that side of you, I feel like there’s nothing left for me to discover. I’ll have to do what I have to do. And...

As soon as he said that, he grabbed a knife in his hand. Before the girl could finish her last words, the killer plunged the knife straight into her chest. She let out one final scream, and then he kept stabbing her repeatedly. All I could hear was the sick, wet sound of flesh tearing and her laughter, piercing my ears. After stabbing her one last time, he pressed a syringe he had hidden behind him, releasing a blue liquid that spread all over the girl’s skin. After a while, she got up and stared right at him. It felt like...


It was like he was praising himself for what he had done. The girl wasn’t dead yet. She was still breathing. You could still hear her faint screams. But whatever liquid he had used was making her faint from the pain. Red blisters had broken out all over her body, and she started scratching herself hard. Until her skin got raw, and then a small stream of white foam started coming out of her mouth, like she had rabies. Then she took her last breath, which made him even more satisfied, turning him into an even bigger killer.

I was already pretty satisfied, and that killer started laughing. Honestly, at that moment, I was so scared I can't even explain. The only thing that mattered to me then was how to get out of that school no matter what. The killer slipped his knife into his pocket, looked around here and there, and then said, "Alright, that's enough." After that, he started walking away. I waited a few more minutes to make sure he was far enough. Then, I carefully opened the locker door. I tried my best.

Don’t look at that mutilated student. She was still trembling a bit because of muscle contractions. I wasn’t even looking in her direction because I didn’t want to see her condition. I didn’t want that image burned into my mind. I looked straight ahead, seeing everything clearly, and then I ran towards the bathroom and hid somewhere around there. I could’ve grabbed a fire extinguisher from the cafeteria, busted open the main doors, and at least used it as a weapon, but I knew she was still...


He must be wandering around there, blocking my way. I can’t go that way. I’ll have to take the gym route because I had taken off my shoes. So, the sound of my footsteps was really quiet. Because of that, I could hear any movement around me way clearer—where he was walking, what he was doing. I was figuring out exactly where he was. It turned into this kind of cat-and-mouse game between us. I tiptoed toward the door, my ears scanning like radar for any danger.

I was ready to leave a mark. Finally, when I saw our basketball team's poster on the wall, I let out a sigh of relief. I stepped into a big, empty gym. But the silence was broken by a rhythmic dripping sound. And it wasn’t just water—it was blood. As I looked up, something you don’t usually see in a gym caught my eye. There was a round, hoop-like ring hanging like a pendulum, swinging back and forth. People usually hang or climb on it to do their drills. But this thing was swinging like a pendulum, and on it was a human body. The body was completely torn apart. Its hands...

He was cut up. His chest was completely torn open. His whole chest was ripped apart, and the same white saliva was coming out of his mouth that was coming from that girl’s mouth. Drops of blood were dripping from the torn chest. It was a boy’s body, and when I saw his face, I can’t even describe how it looked—it was like someone had poured hot oil from a griddle all over his face. That’s how it looked. Then I looked at him carefully, and at first, I thought it was a boy, but when

I looked at his shoes, and whatever it was, I realized he wasn’t just some guy—he was actually my physics teacher. The same teacher whose keys I’d been carrying around everywhere. It was him. I took a step back to brace myself, either to try and make sense of what I’d just seen or to prepare for a lifetime of trauma. Tears were streaming so hard from my eyes, I felt like I might just burst. My heart was pounding like crazy, and adrenaline was rushing through my veins like a waterfall. My stomach was flipping over like I was on a roller coaster.

The place was shut down. Time seemed to stand still, and I was just standing there. Completely surrounded by fear. I wanted to scream for help. I hoped someone would come and get me out of there, but I knew no help was coming. This wasn’t some petty thief or a guy taking revenge just because he failed a paper. This was a totally disturbed, psychopathic person. Psychopaths live off other people’s pain. They torture others like they mean nothing to them at all.
No. It doesn't matter at all. And now, whether I liked it or not, I was stuck with that psychopath. I was looking at my teacher. A feeling stirred inside me that I thought didn’t even exist within me—a feeling of pity. I felt like crying when I saw my teacher. This was the person I hated the most in the world because he was the one who caught me cheating on the exam. That morning, it was him who caught me using my phone during the exam. And yet, here I was, looking at him in this state...

I was feeling really awful. I didn’t even want this for my worst enemy. That’s exactly how I was feeling when suddenly a voice came through. It was coming intermittently from an old speaker mounted on a pole. It brought me right back into that whole situation. At first, I thought maybe it was some glitch, a short circuit or something. But in that moment, I had this strange feeling that the announcement was made on purpose. “Dear students, I want to tell you something. I promise you that if anyone

Sure, I’ll definitely punish him. I want to call James Wilson to the principal’s office so I can sit down with him face to face and teach him some discipline. And if he refuses, I’ll just grab a knife and carve all the rules and warnings into his back. By the way, I should mention that all the students in the school are dead. So, thanks for your attention. Hearing this, every fiber of my body started trembling. Honestly, I wanted to kill myself right then because I didn’t understand... if someone like that...

If he gets his hands on me, dying would be way better because what he does, and how he does it, is pure hell. It’s torture. I didn’t want to feel that. I kept telling myself I was just sleeping in class. I even got punished for it. This is all just a bad dream. I’ll wake up any minute now. The nightmare will be over. But to be honest, none of that was true. When he makes the announcement and calls me to the principal’s office, I realize he’s been watching me for a long time. By now, he probably knows everything. Who am I?

What's my name? Where do I live? Who are my parents? But what's the use of all that right now? The only thing that matters at this moment is staying alive. I had one last option—to reach that exit gate. So, I start running, and I keep running until I get close to the exit gate. But when I see it, the last bit of hope inside me completely fades away. I see that the exit gate is locked up tight with tons of padlocks. It's bound with a really thick chain, and now what I...

I had planned to get out through the exit gate, but that plan was completely blown. I couldn’t get out. I was stuck. There was nothing I could do. It felt like my brain just shut down. I kept telling myself, “Think, think, think, James, you can do something. You’ve never really used your brain before, but today you have to. You have to think. You have to survive.” I started slapping myself. I was doing everything I could to wake my mind up, to get some ideas, to survive, to stay alive. And...

Then I remember I don’t have my phone. I can’t call the police, but I can call the fire department—if the EPS, that is the electronic fire system, is still active. And the best part is, our school didn’t have those super loud alarms that scream so loud even the killer could hear them. Those alarms go straight to the fire department’s office. I run straight there. There’s this red button, you know, the fire department one. I run right up to it and start looking for it. And then, I...
