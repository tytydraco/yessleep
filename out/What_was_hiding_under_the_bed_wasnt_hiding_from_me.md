Before you read this, check underneath your bed.

Something might be hiding there.

Today, I woke up somewhere between midnight and the witching hour.

It was not a gentle awakening. It was instant. Dark unconsciousness then immediate sentience. The kind of waking up you do when you fall from a great height in a dream, or you hear a loud noise that your body hears before your mind does. Adrenaline forces your eyelids open with all the ceremony of a slap in the face, and you thrash upright trying to get your bearings. 

I prefer nightmares. They remain contained to the realm of the unconscious. Laying awake in the dark, trying to comfort your paranoid mind with useless platitudes. That’s real.

When I woke, my heart jumped to my throat and I was filled with a flood of directionless energy. I jerked my head from side to side, my primitive instincts struggling to get a lay of the land. It was dark in my room. My eyes adjusted by degrees and I saw my dresser in the corner, my closet door, and my dirty clothes strewn about the floor. They all made for strange shapes in the darkness. They warbled and shifted like heat illusions. I had to convince myself they weren’t living things, slithering in malformed shapes ever closer to the bed.

I took a deep breath. “It’s your imagination,” I told myself. “Just your mind playing tricks.”

I checked my phone and saw the time. 2am. Great. I had wanted to get up early so I could cram for a test. That was not happening anymore.

I tried to slow down my brain. I did all the usual treatments. I took deep breaths, trying to not think of how terrible it would be if the closet door opened on its own accord. Or if something rose up from the pile of laundry. Or a face peeked through the gap in the curtains. I recited a mantra to myself: “I am alone. I am alone, I am alone, I am alone.”

“I am alone.”

“Am I alone?”

I shook my head to knock the thoughts loose. I was going to go crazy if I kept worrying about all the different nooks and crannies that could conceal the body of a person. I forced my eyes closed. I imagined peaceful things. Baby cats, my pet snake. I replayed an episode of *Seinfeld* in my head, the one where George pretends to be a marine biologist.

No good. I couldn’t rid myself of that panicky feeling. The one that made me want to throw back my covers and double check the lock on the door.

Behind my closed lids, my brain treated me to a quasi-vision. I imagined someone approaching my apartment from the outside. Finding the dead bolt out of place, they slowly turned the knob on the front door. They swung it open with a profane gentleness. I saw that shadow figure step into my apartment, and turn towards my bedroom–-

My eyelids jerked open. Fuck that. I’d just have to wait this out. I pulled up my phone again and started scrolling, hoping that something would hold my attention. Nothing worked. I considered just getting up and starting my day early, but all thought stopped when I saw something flicker from the corner of my eye.

A sliver of movement. The barest flash of color. Coming from the mirror on my closet. 

I turned to look at it. My heart started throwing itself against the walls of my rib cage. I told myself I just caught a weird reflection from my phone. My mind was messing with me.

But still I searched the mirror.

My eyes started at the top, and slid down the length of it. I saw my reflection, me with my phone, my fist gripping the blankets. I saw my mattress, my rumpled sheets, my box spring.

When I got to the floor, I stopped. I stared, fixated.

Underneath the bed, there was a face.

A face staring at me.

We are far too harsh on deer for freezing up when they see headlights. After seeing the face, I couldn’t move. It wasn’t any magical power, it was pure adrenaline, seizing up my muscles. The mirror was reflecting at least half of the underbed area. Most of the details were murky because of how dark it was, but I’ll never forget what I did see.

The face was human. Imagine that one guy you see on your street corner, the guy who holds the cardboard sign that explains how times are hard and he needs a few more dollars. The unkempt beard, the flyaway hair. The kind of guy that might make you cross the street if you saw him coming.

Except he wasn’t on the street corner, he was underneath my bed. He was stock still, and looking directly back at me with wide and shining eyes.

I caught my breath. It took a long time to get my mind in working order. Too long. I tried to figure out what to do. I needed to call the police, but I had to get out of the room first. The man underneath the bed would hear me if I spoke. It was quiet, and my words would give away my intention. 

I thought about yelling at him to leave, but that was quickly ruled out. I am not a strong person, and I didn’t like my chances if things turned physical. He could have a knife, a gun, or something else sharp and ready to tear at my flesh. Even his fingernails could be used as weapons. I could already see their cragged and yellow shape digging into my neck.

I sat in the bed for a haunting minute, trying to keep calm and go over my options. 

I decided on a risky course of action.

I turned over, pretending to be asleep again. I’m not sure how long I waited with my back turned to the mirror. My imagination mutinied, showing me every way I was a fool. I saw the hairy man emerging from under the bed. He slithered out like a snake, raising up so that his head almost brushed the ceiling. He raised his hand high, and then stabbed an improvised weapon into my body, my blood flowing like a river. I felt myself wince at each nonexistent thrust.

I endured these false premonitions, gritting my teeth against them. Once enough time had passed, I put the next phase of my plan into action.

I turned over, pretending to awaken again. I checked my phone, acting as if nothing was wrong. With a side eye, I checked the mirror. The man was still under the bed, his hairy brow pulled up on his forehead, his eyes wide and silver in the bluish light reflected from my screen. I swallowed, and steeled myself for the next step.

I threw off my covers, and put my right foot on the ground.

I was as nonchalant as possible. I was not someone who was going out of the room to sprint to the street and call the police. I was just a restless sleeper, a stressed college student waking up for a midnight piss. When no hand came out to grab my foot, I let the left leg follow my right. The old and dirty carpet felt cool and damp underneath my bare feet as it soaked up my sweat.

I got up from the bed, and began walking to the door.

One step. Two steps. 

Halfway there.

I glanced to my right, and saw myself in the mirror, passing the man hiding underneath the bed. His eyes were following me. I caught a whiff of stale sweat and rancid food.

I held my breath. My heart beat drowned out every other sound in my ears, a frantic and out of control drum-beat.

I was four steps from the door.

Then three.

Then two.

I could run now, I reasoned. I’d open, then slam the door shut. By the time the man got out from under the bed, I’d be out on the street. I already had a hand on my phone, ready to dial those life-saving three numbers.

I reached out for the door handle.

Then the man underneath my bed grabbed me.

His arm extended out like a snake and seized my ankle. I felt his nails, long and sharp. I let out the breath I was holding and yelled in fright. The man under my bed was surprisingly strong. With one arm, he pulled me to the floor. I collapsed as my leg was swept from under me. My head slammed to the ground and everything flashed. I saw stars. I felt him pull me towards him. I tried to fight, I tried to get away, but I saw the bed close over top of me like the lid to a coffin.

I felt something sharp and jagged press into my throat. It felt like broken glass. A bottle maybe.

When my mind stopped reeling, I opened my eyes and saw the hairy man, inches away from my face.

He raised one hand up, and put a finger to his lips.

Shhh.

I didn’t move or make a sound. I could only think about how easily he could rip my throat out. I was paralyzed with fear, imagining all the horrifying things this person was going to do to me. Tears ran down my face.

I heard a knock at the front door.

Relief. Salvation. God was real. The words I heard next, muffled and distant, assured it.

“Police. Open up.”

I opened my mouth to yell, but the hairy man shoved his fist into my mouth.

The taste was terrible. Feces and dog urine. The smell was somehow worse. Tears came to my eyes, and I couldn’t breathe. I struggled against him, but the hairy man only shoved his fist deeper. I bit down and he winced. He didn’t retract his hand. I heard the knock at the door again, and the police officer on the other side raised his voice “Police. Is anyone in there?”

The hairy man jabbed the bottle against my throat again. He shook his head, and mouthed words to me. After a few attempts, I got the message “Shut up. Or I kill you.”

I shut up.

The knocking stopped. I heard the police officer walk away. My own survival was slipping through my fingers. I resigned myself to death. I waited for the bottle to break the skin, break my arteries and veins. No doubt the hairy man would keep me alive for a while, doing all sorts of depraved and violent things to me. 

But before I could think of a full list of horrors, my racing brain was stopped dead by a knocking noise coming from my wall.

The wall I shared with the empty apartment next to mine.

I knew that the door to that apartment was locked. The landlord had a problem with squatters and had changed the locks only a month ago. The walls were thin.  I hadn’t heard the police break down the door or shatter one of the windows. How were they in there?

The knocking continued.

It was quiet at first, slow and rhythmic. After the first sequence there was silence. Then it began again, slightly louder. More urgent. I heard the policeman from before, his voice muffled through the drywall and insulation. 

“Hey, everything alright in there?”

The hairy man withdrew his hand from my mouth. I didn’t try yelling again. I had that feeling, the one that had burrowed through my body before while lying in the dark. That sharp metallic feeling of unseen yet imminent danger, like iron in your nose.

The hairy man was bleeding from where my teeth had sunk into his flesh. With his finger, he wrote two words, using his own dark blood as ink.

*Not human.*

My stomach dropped. I crawled deeper under my bed. I heard my own breathing and muffled the sound with my hand. I didn’t know what was on the other side of that wall, but I knew I didn’t want it to hear me. I didn’t want to let it know I was in here.

It went quiet for a moment, and then a new voice called out.

“You in there?”

Goosepimples, all over my body like some dead disease. I knew that voice.

It was my brother.

My brother who lives four states away and with whom I had not spoken in over a year.

I looked at the hairy man. He put his finger to his lips again and shook his head.

Whoever, or whatever, was on the other side of the wall kept knocking. They knocked from one end, all the way to the other, changing positions every few moments. They spoke for a while in my brother’s voice, asking if anyone was there and if I was okay. When I didn’t respond to it, they began to cycle through people like some demented impressionist. Some I recognized, some I didn’t. I heard my mothers voice, my fathers. My chemistry teacher, my best friend. My ex-girlfriend from high school. They weren’t exact recreations. There was an edge underneath all of them, a tension, like all their words were being said through gritted teeth. With each voice, the urge to scream became stronger. Not because I thought it would bring some sort of rescue, but because if I didn’t let out the fear pooling inside of me, I would go insane.

I felt the hairy man’s hand close over my mouth. This time I was grateful for it. I couldn’t control myself. We held each other in a strange and awkward embrace, trying our best not to listen to the voices coming from the other side of the wall.

After a moment, the knocking stopped. We lay underneath the bed in the stillness. For a long time, we heard nothing. I could feel the hairy man relax.

I leaned closer to him. I spoke so softly, I wouldn’t have known what I was saying if the words weren’t echoing in my own head. “Is…is it gone?”

A knocking came from my bedroom window.

The man’s hand seized my mouth, but it wasn’t needed. I couldn’t have spoken even if I wanted to. My throat had seized up in fear and it was hard to breathe. Whoever was on the other side hit the glass so hard, I thought the glass would shatter. It didn’t. There was another moment of silence.

A streetlamp outside was positioned so it glared a beam of light through my window. It created a long rectangle of illumination onto the ground. As I watched it, I saw a silhouette step into the lit area. It was tall, thin, hunched. Its head was misshapen. Its fingers were spindly. Its limbs moved as if many jointed.

I heard a deep and guttural voice I did not recognize speak through the window.

“Are you there, David?”

I felt the hairy man tense. I waited for whatever was on the other side of the window to come crashing in, to seize us both, to take us away to whatever hell it had planned. 

We waited for an hour, watching that shadow on the floor, stifling our breathing.

Then, slowly, the shadow moved to the edge of the light, blotting it out for a moment, and then it was gone.

It was around 5am before the hairy man, David, let go of me.  He pulled himself out from under the mattress. He examined his bleeding hand, then tore some cloth from his tattered clothes. He wrapped his wound with the makeshift bandage.

I watched him, still not daring to leave my hiding spot.

David stared down at me. He nodded. “Thanks.”

Thirty minutes later, when the sun was just over the horizon, he left.

That was this morning.

I’m getting out of this place. I can’t stay here anymore knowing that whatever was at my window is still wandering the streets. Before he left, David told me a few things. I can’t call the police. I need to get out of here. I’m moving out of state today. I need to hide, find a solitary place where no one can find me.

Whatever was outside the window last night won’t leave me alone after this. It’ll know my name, and it’ll know my scent. It will come for me.

David told me to write this. There’s more of those things out there. They lurk in dark places. He said we need to let people know. Lives are at stake.

Please, if you didn’t do it before, do it now. Check under your bed.
