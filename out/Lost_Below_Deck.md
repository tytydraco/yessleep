The steel hull of the USS Ardent creaked and groaned as it sliced through the pitch-black waters of the Pacific. I had been assigned to this carrier only a few weeks ago, fresh from training, and still adjusting to the labyrinthine maze of corridors, stairwells, and bulkheads that made up our floating city.

It was late, long past the usual hum of activity. Most of the crew were asleep, save for a few night shift personnel. My bunk was cramped, and the incessant hum of the engines below made it impossible to sleep. I decided to head to the galley for some coffee, figuring the walk might help clear my mind.

The carrier at night was a different beast. Shadows stretched unnaturally under the dim red emergency lights that lined the halls. The sound of footsteps echoed in ways that felt off, as if the ship itself was mimicking me.

I took a wrong turn near the lower decks, where the storage and maintenance rooms were located. It wasn’t unusual to get lost—there were dozens of identical passageways—but something felt wrong this time. The air was heavier here, stale and metallic.

As I walked further, the sound of the engines became muffled, replaced by a strange clicking noise. It wasn’t mechanical; it sounded...organic. I froze, straining to hear over my own breath.

“Who’s there?” I called out, my voice bouncing eerily off the steel walls.

No response. Just more clicking, closer now.

I turned and hurried back the way I’d come, but the corridor didn’t look familiar anymore. My heart began to race. Every door I passed was sealed shut, their small porthole windows blacked out.

The clicking grew louder, interspersed with faint whispers that I couldn’t make out. It sounded like multiple voices speaking at once, overlapping in an unintelligible drone.

“Hello?” I called again, louder this time. The whispers stopped.

And then, I heard it—a sharp, metallic clang behind me. I spun around, but the corridor was empty. My pulse thundered in my ears.

I didn’t wait to see what was coming. I bolted down the hallway, not caring where it led, just needing to get away. The whispers started again, louder and more insistent, like a chorus of voices all around me.

I stumbled into a stairwell and slammed the door behind me. The voices stopped abruptly, leaving only the sound of my ragged breathing. I leaned against the cold steel wall, trying to calm down.

That’s when I saw it.

At the bottom of the stairwell, partially obscured by shadows, something moved. It wasn’t a person. It was too large, too misshapen. A mass of limbs and something glinting in the dim light—teeth, maybe?

It started to climb. Slowly at first, then faster.

I didn’t wait to find out what it was. I sprinted up the stairs, taking them two at a time, my boots clanging against the metal. The creature’s movements grew louder, a sickening mix of wet squelches and metallic scraping.

I burst through the first door I found and slammed it shut behind me, locking it tight. I was back in a main corridor, the hum of the engines finally audible again.

I ran until I found another sailor, barely able to speak as I tried to explain what had happened. He looked at me like I was crazy, but he humored me, walking back with me to check it out.

When we got there, the stairwell was empty. No strange creature, no voices. Just the cold, empty steel of the ship.

He laughed it off, told me I’d been working too hard and needed sleep. But as he walked away, I noticed something on the floor—a single wet handprint smeared across the metal.

I never went back to the lower decks after that. But sometimes, late at night, I still hear the whispers.
