I don’t do heights. Not in the way that most people get excited about them, anyway. The higher I go, the more the air feels like it’s mocking me, like I’m supposed to be thrilled about this shit. I’m just waiting for gravity to come in and remind me who’s boss. But, of course, my younger brother—who thinks he’s got everything figured out—decides we’re flying somewhere. And not just any flight, but one that’s gonna keep us in the air long enough for me to lose my mind completely.

I’m all for getting out of the house, but planes? That’s a different kind of nightmare. I’d rather take a train, a bus, hell, I’d even walk there if it meant avoiding being crammed into a metal box with a bunch of strangers who all seem way too comfortable with the fact they’re flying hundreds of miles above the ground.

And there he is, beside me, practically vibrating with excitement like he’s about to win a prize for being the most obnoxious person on the planet.

“Bro, you’re just gonna sit there and act like you’re not about to experience the best view of your life?” he says, flashing that grin like he’s found the answer to the meaning of life.

I glance at him, deadpan. “Look, the only view I’m gonna get is whatever the hell’s on the seat in front of me. The back of someone’s head, probably. But sure, let’s pretend this is some kind of life-changing experience.”

He snorts. “Man, you’re being dramatic. It’s just a plane ride.”

I raise an eyebrow. “Yeah, and a prison sentence is just ‘some time away from home.’ You’re telling me that’s not at least a little bit of a nightmare?”

He laughs, but I can tell he’s not really taking me seriously. And I’m not surprised. He’s one of those people who thinks everything’s an adventure, even if it’s just a trip to the grocery store.

Just then, I feel someone’s eyes on me, sharp and unsettling. I turn, and there’s this woman—early thirties, maybe—staring at me like I’m some kind of walking disaster waiting to happen. It’s that look you get when people can tell you’re about to make a scene, and they’re just waiting for it to unfold. Like she’s mentally taking bets on how quickly I’ll snap.

I squint at her, then turn back to my brother, who’s just about to say something when I interrupt.

“Do I look like I’m about to do something ridiculous?”

He looks at me like I’m insane. “Bro, what are you—”

I cut him off with a subtle nod toward the woman. “She’s looking at me like I just stole her lunch money. The hell is her problem?”

My brother follows my gaze and starts laughing his ass off. “Damn, dude. What are you gonna do, ask her if she wants a photo? ‘Cause you’re definitely giving off ‘I’m about to lose it’ vibes.”

I meet the woman’s gaze again, letting the silence hang for a second before I turn back to my brother, my voice smooth and steady. “The fuck you looking at?”

The woman blinks, clearly caught off guard, and quickly looks away, like she’s trying to pretend she wasn’t just caught giving me a judgmental side-eye. I can’t help but feel a small victory in that.

My brother’s still chuckling, shaking his head. “Bro, you’re something else.”

“People need to mind their business,” I mutter, already regretting being in a place where everyone’s got an opinion about my existence. “Look, I’m not saying I’m gonna flip out on this flight… but if I do, it’s not gonna be her problem.”





The airport smelled like wet carpet and microwave grease. That fake-clean scent they pump into every terminal so you don’t think too hard about how many bodies passed through the same space. People sat in rows like worn-out mannequins, necks bent, eyes glazed. Everyone waiting, no one there.

Me? I was just trying not to throw up from the nerves.

I leaned against the wall near Gate 17, arms crossed, pretending to be unbothered. My younger brother, meanwhile, was bouncing on the balls of his feet like we were heading to Six Flags.

“Man, you look like you’re about to get executed,” he said, tossing a half-eaten granola bar into the trash. “You sure you don’t wanna just hug the pilot for comfort before we board?”

I gave him a sideways look. “Shut up.”

He laughed. “C’mon, bro. It’s just a plane. You act like we’re flying Spirit and the engine’s held on with duct tape.”

I didn’t laugh. Just adjusted my backpack strap and scanned the terminal.

Something was off.

Not in the oh no, horror movie music way. Just…the air felt wrong. Like the lighting was too consistent. Too even. Like someone forgot to program variation into this moment. A kid dropped his juice box ten feet away and just stared at it. Didn’t cry. Didn’t move. Just stared like he didn’t know what it was anymore.

My brother nudged me.

“You hearing voices or something?” he said. “You look…gone.”

I blinked.

“No. Just tired.”

He stared at me a second too long. Then clapped me on the back. “You need a nap. Maybe a girlfriend. Or therapy.”

“Therapy sounds better,” I muttered.

We walked toward the gate. The line was crawling forward now. Just a single agent scanning boarding passes with a mechanical smile. One guy ahead of us—sweaty, probably mid-forties—kept turning around like he forgot something. Checked his phone. Pocketed it. Pulled it back out. Checked it again. Like his brain was buffering.

I looked up for no reason. Just felt like I had to.

That’s when I saw it.

Above the gate—where the usual flight info should’ve been—there was a screen. Old-school, slightly flickering, like it belonged in a hospital waiting room in 1997.

It said:

“THAT’S NOT YOUR BROTHER.”

Plain. Red text. Monospace. No animation.

My lungs didn’t work for a second.

Then the screen blinked—and it was back to normal.
Flight 287 — Boarding Now.

I didn’t say anything.

Not because I didn’t want to. But because my mouth suddenly felt like it wasn’t mine. Like the air around me got thicker, like I’d stepped into something meant for someone else.

He turned back to me again, mid-laugh from some joke I missed. “Yo, you good? You keep zoning out.”

I forced a breath. “Yeah. I’m fine.”

“Yeah? ‘Cause your eyes say you just saw death in 4K.”

I looked at him.

That smile. Those eyes.

It was him. It had to be. I mean—how could it not be?

Still, I walked onto the plane two steps behind him.

Like I was following a stranger wearing my brother’s skin.
