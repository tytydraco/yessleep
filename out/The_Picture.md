“Beth! You gotta see this!” Ryan shouted from across the cramped antique shop.

We were the only customers, on a rainy Tuesday morning, and the store was deathly silent. Ryan’s voice seemed to echo down the too-small isles. 

I smiled apologetically to the woman behind the counter, who looked like an antique herself. She glared at me over her plastic tortoise-shell glasses, disapproval turning down the corners of her mouth.

I headed toward Ryan, sliding sideways down the length of the shop, trying not to bump or jostle anything. Nothing I passed was priced less than $50, and signs were posted every four feet, in bright red letters, ‘You Break, You Buy!’. 

As I squeaked past an intricately carved (and very fragile) oriental privacy-screen, I saw Ryan bouncing on the balls of his feet in a rare open space. He was staring at a painting halfway up the wall, covered in cobwebs and dust; the gold-leaf on the frame cracked and faded.

“Did you find a lost Van Gogh, or something?” I laughed. He turned to me with a huge smile and pointed to the painting.

“Look! Look at her!” He started bouncing again. I hadn’t heard him sound so excited on one of our treasure hunts, since he discovered that old violin in the last consignment shop. From the state of the painting, I doubted we’d get much money for it. I looked from the painting to him and back, confused. Why was he so excited, then?

“It’s you!” He stood still, waiting for a reaction. I walked over and stood next to him to get a better view.

Under the years of grime, the image of a girl in a black Renaissance-style dress sat on the edge of a cliff, her feet dangling over the edge. She stared down into the black abyss, the wind whipping her hair back, fluttering her red velvet cloak around her shoulders. Only the top of her forehead was visible. How was this supposed to be me?

“I suppose if I squint, she kind of looks like me”. I scrunched up my eyes and stepped closer to the painting, not trying to hide my smile. I chuckled as I turned around, but he wasn’t laughing. 
 
“No, it’s you. Remember that Halloween 3 years ago? You wore that same dress. And she looks just like you!” He was adamant. 

“Ryan,” I said patiently. “I agree that the dress is similar to the one I wore – it was 5 years ago, by the way – but you can’t even see her face. How does she look like me?” I turned to the painting and froze. My stomach dropped and a sensation of cold spread out from my chest. I couldn’t look away. I began to tremble.

Her head was tilted up and a small, crooked smile was on her lips. Deep blue eyes, stared out at the viewer. No, not the viewer. At me. And I knew those eyes. I saw them every morning in the bathroom mirror. They were my eyes, in my face. She even had the same small beauty mark over her eyebrow. There was something different, though. The longer I stared at her, the more obvious it was. The smile, the slight tilt to her head –

She was insane. 

Then I heard her. She was calling to me with my voice. Pleading. I tried to deny her, deny what was happening, but I couldn’t. I needed to reach her, to save her, to find a way. Time slowed and I felt like I was floating. I was barely aware of walking up to the painting and stretching out my hand. My fingers lightly brushed the bottom of the frame and it slowly started falling forward as my knees gave out and I dropped to the floor. I felt something heavy land on me and heard a faint shout. As my vision clouded over, all I could see were her eyes and all I could hear was her voice. Laughing.

I don’t know how long I was out. My head felt fuzzy. As the events in the antique shop came back to me, my senses came back as well, but slowly. At first, all I could feel was that I was sitting. The ground was rough and uneven. Sharp stones dug into me, but I couldn’t shift or move at all. There was a pressure on and around me, holding me in place.

My hearing came back next. There was the sound of wind. It was soft at first, but grew into a constant howling all around me. I didn’t understand. My mind wouldn’t let me understand. Not yet, anyway. 
 
With my head down, I opened my eyes. Below me was a huge crack in the earth. I couldn’t see the bottom, just shadows growing darker the further down it went. My heart skipped a beat. I don’t think there was a bottom. I squeezed my eyes shut again. Then I heard a voice, carried on the wind. I couldn’t quite make out the words, but I knew who it was. Ryan. 

I opened my eyes and looked up, trying to find him. If I had a piece of reality to help ground me, I could find my way back. Instead, I saw a window, floating over the abyss. I saw him through the window, our living room behind him. I saw his lips move, but only caught a few words.

“Told you she…perfect fit…find of a lifetime…” He smiled and looked to his right. His lips continued to move, but I couldn’t hear anything he said. I shouted to him, but the wind carried my voice away. He couldn’t hear me. Tears filled my eyes as I struggled to move, to wave my arms, or do something to get his attention. I still couldn’t move, held in place by bonds I couldn’t see. He took a step back and spread his arms wide. The wind died down for just a moment, and I heard him talking to someone I couldn’t see.

“Well, what do you think, Beth?” Then a figure walked into frame, slide under his arm and turned toward me. 

It was her. 

I stared, eyes wide, heart racing. She wore the same twisted smile and looked at me with the same deep blue eyes. I screamed, tears streaming down my cheeks. She tilted her head to the side and her smile widened. Then she laughed.

That was when I felt my mind fracture. It started as a small crack, then three, then ten. And as I looked into those eyes, the cracks spread further, branching out again and again. Then it shattered. 

I started laughing, too.
