 1. Please assume that God has the ability to read people's lives very quickly and detaily: karma

The Holy Spirit who accompanied Jesus had the power to read people’s karma. With this ability the holy spirit could keep track of where the bread and fishes were from the people passing by that could feed 5,000 people. This also can be inferred that God uses information of all humans to open his specific goals. In this way God could have fortell the future of enemies, the betrade of Judah etc in the bible. This miracle : 5 loaves and 2 fish was happened by God of Israel and holy spirits through standing Jesus who was a living man so that many people could have faith in Christy. 

2. The reality of angels and gods 

When Israel God (the king of all religions) gives the Holy Spirit to a human from each nation they become the God after that person dies.  God is the King of sky who can stand angels and share abilities to each angels. Jejus is the second king with all abilities accepted except the power of sharing abilities. Angels are not picked among the naturally dead people but are killed by air pressure- one side blocking and one side flowing hard in the parts critical that leads to instantaneous death: the brain vains. All angels are chosen from humans to please gods using their bodies and charms- and they are chosen from very poor families but love families each other so that after being stood as a god they stay and do sexual plaything while being treathening their familes. Their families are being threathened in optic nerves - becoming blind instantly. 

The part that the assumptions of God can kill people is implied in the bible verses. 

3. ln Job verses, the Old Testament conversation between God and Satan, "I allow you touching only his possessions, but not his life" we can see that the Satan had the ability to deal people’s lives.  Moreover, many saints were born through Jejus in the New Testament. Therefore it can be seen that the gods, who already had the ability to harm people, completed the doctrine by appointing one person in front of many people. This was because God from Israel requires a justification after killing people and standing them up as a god and insisting them to be their sex doll clowns that bring joyfulness while threathening their family's lives.

1. Eternal Life- the life of gods and angels 

The gods and angels live along until the earth ends. At first they had used their abilities to help humans. But as you can see the part god and demon was talking, they were not goodness from old testament. It is impossible for gods and holy spirits to be goodness because of many years passing by. 

5. Some of the angels’ abilities- you can anaylze bible with these assumptions 

visual hallucinations - also capable of color

auditory Hallucinations - multiple sounds possible

touching hallucinations - sex appeal feelings

tasting Hwanmi - Appetite and the other way 

smell Hallucinations - smell of food, etc.

Move Soul - Used to create human spirits to become an angel 

Visibility of the soul - Human body can be seen even when wearing clothes

Air pressure - Air pressure makes blood circulate in people's blood vessels, so facial paralysis and crippled people can be corrected.  

Reading the karma detaily with fast speed- A person's entire life can be read very quickly, and the gods catch and open the way for parts that people do not remember (God's power)

Making human spirits to angel- Raising a soul, making it into a Spirit, then folding it into a little angel

Covering- the ability to be present in front of people and saying in front of people

Confusion: the ability to disturb people’s mind and action in order to lead to the way that God has planned
