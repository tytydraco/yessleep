I wake up to the sound of my alarm blaring at 6:30 AM, just like every other miserable morning. But today, something’s off. Not in a major, reality-shattering way—just… off. My phone is fully charged even though I forgot to plug it in last night. My clothes are already laid out on the chair by my bed, neatly folded. And when I stumble into the bathroom, still half-asleep, the mirror is spotless.

Which is weird, because I distinctly remember smudging it up last night while brushing my teeth.

I tell myself I must’ve wiped it down without thinking and move on. I don’t have time to dwell on minor inconsistencies—especially when I’m already late for work.

The next few days follow the same unsettling pattern. My keys, which I always lose, are right where I need them. My bank account, which should’ve been overdrawn, suddenly has just enough to cover rent. The coffee machine starts brewing before I even touch it.

I should be relieved. But I’m not.

Because every morning, when I step in front of the mirror, something feels wrong. My reflection doesn’t move out of sync—not yet—but there’s a tension in the way it stares back. An expectation.

I don’t acknowledge it. I refuse to.

Then, the messages started.

The first one appears on my bathroom mirror after a hot shower: “I KNOW YOU SEE ME.” Written in the condensation, the letters drip like they’ve been carved out of the fog.

I wiped it away.

The next day, another message: *“WHY WON’T YOU ANSWER?”*

And another: “I CAN HELP.”

I start brushing my teeth without looking at the mirror at all. If I don’t react, if I don’t give it what it wants, maybe it’ll get bored and leave me alone.

Spoiler: it doesn’t.

The messages stop being limited to my bathroom. I see them in car windows, on the glass doors at work, even faintly traced into the reflection of my phone screen. Smudges appear on my mirrors—handprints, but not mine. Sometimes the reflection lags for half a second too long, just enough to make my stomach drop before I force myself to ignore it.

But it’s getting harder to ignore.

The reflection watches me now, its gaze heavier than before. When I glance at it too quickly, I think I see its expression shift—just slightly, just enough to unsettle. The corners of its mouth twitch, its eyes flicker with something I can’t name. Something I don’t want to name.

Then, one night, I snap.

I’m exhausted, running on caffeine fumes, and just barely managed to avoid getting fired that day. I step into the bathroom and—of course—there’s another message waiting for me.

“PLEASE.”

That’s it. Just one word, desperate and insistent.

My chest tightens. It’s not just a message. It’s a plea.

I don’t know what comes over me, but I grab the nearest towel and furiously wipe the mirror. “No. I don’t know what you want, but I don’t have time for this.”

For the first time since this started, my reflection doesn’t match me.

It just stands there, staring. And then, slowly, it smiles.

The light flickers.

And in that split second of darkness, I swear to god, I hear something whisper:

*“Now we’re getting somewhere.”*
